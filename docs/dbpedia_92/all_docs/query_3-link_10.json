        "text": "Desperate Teenage Lovedolls (David Markey, 1984)\n\nIn order to get in the mood to write about Desperate Teenage Lovedolls (word on the street is, the film was originally titled \"Desperate Teenage Runaways,\" but Kim Fowley, former manager of The Runaways, threatened to sue), I've been listening to \"Survive\" by The Bags on repeat (and by \"repeat,\" I mean two times in a row). Okay, before you say, \"aren't you special,\" the song is featured in the movie; just in case you were wondering why I was randomly namedropping this classic slab of L.A. punk rock. In all honesty, what I'm really trying to do is summon my inner punk. And, yes, I have an inner punk; his name is Steve, he likes the Suburban Lawns, eats nothing but Doritos® Fromage Mordant, wants to perform cunnilingus on Sharon Mitchell in the worst possible way, and spends most of his time sniffing glue underneath the Santa Monica Pier. The reason you initially doubted whether or not I had an inner punk was probably because I rarely ever need to tap into him. In fact, the only time I ever seem to require his services is when I'm watching Repo Man; which is something I try to do at least once year (\"Ordinary fucking people. I hate 'em\"). In other words, Steve's not a big part of my life. However, I needed him desperately (no pun intended) when it came time to watch this micro-budget tribute to the L.A. punk scene (the only punk scene I subscribe to). And after listening to \"Survive\" by The Bags multiple times, I feel like I'm ready to delve into this gritty, shot on super-8, cult, trash, camp masterpiece.\n\nIt's a good thing I did, because I was immediately put off by the lack of synthesizers on the soundtrack; I kept telling myself: \"Relax, man. Not every film can have synthesizers.\" Nevertheless, the film does use the music of SPK to punch up the drug trip gone awry scene. And, as most people know, SPK are one of the few bands that can be truly call themselves \"industrial\" (most so-called \"industrial\" bands make house music with distorted vocals slapped over top of it - not that there's anything wrong with that).\n\nReminding me of Ladies and Gentlemen - The Fabulous Stains, Breaking Glass, and Smithereens (films that sport ambitious female characters who crave fame and fortune, but quickly find out that both are not all that they're cracked up to be), Desperate Teenage Lovedolls, written and directed by David Markey (founder of the punk zine We Got Power! - I'm a wealth of information today), tells the tale of The Lovedolls, an all-girl punk band who become unwitting victim's of their own success.\n\nWhen two long lost friends, the leggy Kitty Carryall (Jennifer Schwartz) and the exceedingly brunette Bunny Tremelo (Hilary Rubens), reunite at a bus station in Venice, California, they both agree that now is the perfect time to put The Lovedolls back together.\n\nEven though it's still early, I'm having no trouble whatsoever picturing the members of Sleater-Kinney and Bikini Kill watching Desperate Teenage Lovedolls on their respective tour buses.\n\nThe third member of The Lovedolls, it turns out, is locked up in a mental hospital. Which, surprisingly, isn't going to be that big a problem, as Alexandra (Kim Pilkington) is planning her escape as we speak. Smashing her guitar over the head of her doctor (Jordan Schwartz), Alexandra makes a run for it.\n\nMeanwhile, out in suburbia (our trip to the burbs is accompanied by a cheeky music cue taken directly from The Brady Bunch), Kitty, who is wearing a kick ass green sweater dress (if you don't think sweater dresses can kick ass - well, they totally can), and Bunny are rehearsing. When Kitty's mom (Jordan Schwartz) starts hassling her, Bunny decides to bail. Chilling in her room, showing off her amazing legs (which are tastefully encased in a pair of light purple pantyhose), Kitty is shocked to find Alexandra hiding under some blankets.\n\nAfter telling her mom to \"go fuck herself,\" Kitty and Alexandra leave in a huff. Well, actually, Kitty does the majority of the huffing during their exit. What I should said was, after hurling a series of fuck-based insults in the general direction of her mother, Kitty, along with Alexandra, leaves in a huff. I guess that's better. Either way, Kitty is now a teenage runaway.\n\nWhile hitchhiking with Alexandra, you'll notice that Kitty is now wearing black pantyhose. Granted, you'll have pause the movie in order to properly appreciate the magnitude of the hosiery change. But trust me, her light purple pantyhose have been replaced by a pair of jet black pantyhose.\n\nIf you don't believe me, watch the outtakes. In them, you'll come across an extended version of the hitchhiking scene. And in this extended version you will clearly see that the shapely stems jutting out from the bottom half of Jennifer Schwartz's kick ass green sweater dress have been lovingly re-poured into a pair of super-tight, jet black pantyhose. To make matters even more titillating, there's a run in her hose (a long run that starts on her left thigh and goes all the way down to her knee).\n\nYou think that's titillating? Wait until you see the part where Jennifer Schwartz tells Kim Pilkingston to stop wasting her time using her thumbs to hitch a ride and proceeds to lift up the bottom of her kick ass green sweater dress to reveal even more pantyhose-ensnared leg. They're going to be mopping you off the floor.\n\nAnd get this, she actually says, \"The thumb trick doesn't work, but the pantyhose does,\" while hiking up her kick ass green sweater dress. Now, the only reason I think of as to why this scene didn't make it into the final version of the film was because of bad pantyhose continuity. Like I said, Kitty Carryall is wearing light purple pantyhose when she leaves in that huff I mentioned earlier, and seconds later, she is wearing jet black pantyhose. People who leave in huffs don't usually have time to change their pantyhose. If she had left in say, a casual and relaxed manner, then I would have bought the pantyhose change. But not in a huff. It doesn't pass pantyhose muster.\n\nWhich is a shame, really. Because there's nothing sexier than a leggy woman, or in this case, a leggy teenage runaway, who knows how to harness the power of her shapely stems.\n\nMost people when talking about Desperate Teenage Lovedolls seem to go on and on about the controversial scene where Kim Pilkington shoots heroin...for realz. Yet, here I am, rambling, semi-coherently, about, what is basically, a deleted scene. Oh, well.\n\nAs expected, Alexandra's drug habit prevents her from becoming a Lovedoll (you're supposed to develop a debilitating drug habit after you become famous, not before). Nonetheless, that doesn't stop Kitty, who hits the streets in search of a new drummer. Running into Patch Kelly (Janet Housden) while putting up flyers, Kitty asks her to join the band. Of course, not before thanking her for killing her mother. Here's a sample of the dialogue heard during Kitty and Patch's first meeting: Kitty Carryall: \"Thanks for killing my mother.\" Patch Kelly: \"No problem.\"\n\nAfter stealing a guitar from some homeless guy in an afro wig, The Lovedolls soon find themselves on the road to superstardom. Only problem being, their manager, Johnny Tremaine (the amazing Steve McDonald from Redd Kross), is a bit of a scumbag (he rapes Bunny, puts Boy George on hold, and thinks a Beatles reunion with Kevin DuBrow from Quiet Riot as John Lennon's replacement is a good idea). And, oh, yeah, there's this all-girl gang called the She-Devils who are still pissed over the fact that Kitty killed their leader, Tanya Hearst (Tracy Marshak-Nash), with a switchblade during a violent confrontation on a Venice beach.\n\nYou could tell that Kitty and Bunny had finally \"made it\" just by looking at colour of their tights (colourful tights = success). Lounging around their mansion in Brentwood, Kitty, whose legs are fashionably sheathed in purple tights, and Bunny, who's rocking a pair of pink tights, have a contented air about them. However, as anyone who has ever watched a movie like this before knows, it all could fall apart at any moment. Meaning, the hottest band on the planet could be washed up in a matter of months. Scratch that, they could be washed up in a matter of days.\n\nDespite its extreme low budget (the film purportedly cost around 350 dollars to make), Desperate Teenage Lovedolls manages to overcome its financial difficulties by fully embracing the D.I.Y. spirit of the L.A. punk scene. Boasting a campy edge (Steve McDonald's drug trip while wearing blue spandex trousers and his talk back while watching Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway are pure camp) and moments of violence (at least seven people are murdered in this film), the film isn't your typical tale of a couple of gals who go from the gutters of Venice to glamour of Beverly Hills. Uh-uh, it earns its status as a cult classic through sheer moxie and hard work.\n\nvideo uploaded by Dave Markey\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nLovedolls Superstar (David Markey, 1986)\n\nHow do you go about making a sequel to an underground classic when most of the principal characters from the original were murdered? Well, according to David Markey, the writer-director-producer-editor of Lovedolls Superstar, his epic follow up to Desperate Teenage Lovedolls, all you need is a long lost hippie twin brother, a Ritz-cracker eating socialite bent on revenge, a demented Lovedolls super-fan, a brunette ghost, and you should be good to go. When I use to word \"epic\" to describe this film, I ain't kidding around. Sure, it contains all the drug use, violence, gore, music, and, not to mention, the multiple shots of Jennifer Schwartz's surprisingly shapely legs sheathed in colourful tights we've come to expect from The Lovedolls franchise. But this chapter seems determined to outdo its predecessor. First things first, they definitely had more money to work with this time around. Granted, it's still not a lot, especially when compared to other low budget movies. But that being said, all you have to do is take one look at the artists who contribute songs to the soundtrack (Sonic Youth, Meat Puppets, Dead Kennedys) to realize there's something different in the air. Mocking the music industry (a record company executive is brutally murdered by a mob in a scene straight out of an Italian cannibal movie), crazy religious cults, Bruce Springsteen/Rick Springfield, flower children, feminist television hosts, and celebrity culture, the film, while retaining the campy tone that made part one so enjoyable, has a developed a bit of a satirical edge since we last tuned in.\n\nWhile all those topics and subjects are ridiculed to maximum effect, it's crazy religious cults that get skewered the most in the early going. You won't believe this, but Patch Kelly (Janet Housden) is now \"Patch Christ,\" the not-so charismatic leader of a group of mindless followers. I know, you're asking yourself, who's this Patch Kelly/Patch Christ person? If you recall, she was the drummer of The Lovedolls who killed Kitty Carryall's mother; Kitty Carryall (the sexy Jennifer Schwartz) is, of course, the charismatic leader of The Lovedolls who fell on hard times at the end of Desperate Teenage Lovedolls. Anyway, most people will agree that Patch Kelly wasn't much a factor in the first film; okay, to be blunt, she was barely in it.\n\nShe might not have been memorable in the first flick, but Patch Kelly/Patch Christ is the reason Kitty Carryall is able to extricate herself from the Venice day spa she is currently wallowing in. And, no, being in a \"Venice day spa\" isn't as nice as it sounds; Kitty Carryall was ankle deep in sewer water when Patch and her gang of thieving juvenile delinquents happen upon her (she was giving herself an e. coli mud facial).\n\nMade up of ex-fans of The Lovedolls, the cult steal, and sometimes kill, for Patch Kelly, who can pretty much make them do anything her heart desires. After hearing The Lovedolls on the radio, Kitty, who has since taken a shower (I dug the pink ribbon she wore in her hair to signify her newfound cleanliness), and Patch decide to put the band back together. Only problem being, they don't have a guitar player. If you recall, Bunny Tremelo (Hilary Rubens) met with an \"unfortunate accident\" at the end of Desperate Teenage Lovedolls.\n\nWhile wandering the streets of Hollywood, Kitty and Patch bump into Alexandria (Kim Pilkington), the blonde junkie whose heroin habit hampered her attempt to become a rock star in the first film; remember kids, if you're going to develop a trendy heroin habit, wait until your rich and famous first. Working as a hooker with her red beret-wearing friend Shabu (Cheri Land), under the watchful eye of their pimp, Slick (Jordan Schwartz), Kitty and Patch convince Alexandria to drop the \"trashy whore\" routine and join the band as their guitar player.\n\nJust because Johnny Tremaine (their former manager) and Tanya Hearst (leader of the She-Devils) aren't around anymore to hassle The Lovedolls, doesn't mean that outside forces are not conspiring against them. You wouldn't think it by looking at him, but Johnny Tremaine's twin brother Rainbow (Steve McDonald) is about to become The Lovedolls' primary nemesis. Living on a New Mexico commune called \"The Freedom School\" with a bunch of hippies (including Vickie Peterson from The Bangles), Rainbow decides to visit L.A. to see what his brother is up to (he has no idea he's dead).\n\nActually, Rainbow Tremaine is pretty harmless compared to what Patricia Anne Cloverfield (Tracy Marshak-Nash, a.k.a. Tracy Lea) has in store for The Lovedolls. Landing at LAX, Patricia, we soon find out, is Tanya Heart's mother. And if you're wondering why Patricia, who is sitting crossed-legged, suddenly stops eating her Ritz crackers, it's because she just found out her daughter was killed by The Lovedolls.\n\nIf that wasn't enough trouble for The Lovedolls, we're introduced to Carl Celery (Jeffrey McDonald), an obsessed fan of the group. If he's so into The Lovedolls, he should join their cult. Why should he? When Kitty Carryall visits him and instructs him to murder Bruce Springsteen. Don't worry, Kitty Carryall is not really making appearances in his squalid hellhole masquerading as a home, Carl is delusional.\n\nLet's recap: The upstart band have not one, not two, but three antagonists to deal with in this chapter of The Lovedolls saga. And it would seem that Bruce Springsteen has an antagonist as well.\n\nIt's a good thing The Lovedolls have a cult to back them up this time around. And they come in handy almost immediately when The Lovedolls go up against a sleazy (which should go without saying) record exec named Slim Crowley (Bob Moss). Instead of simply leaving his office after being rejected (he basically calls them has-beens), The Lovedolls sick their cult on him. That doesn't sound so bad. He was roughed up in the parking lot to the music of Sonic Youth, big deal. Roughed up? They stomp his guts out and drink his blood. So, yeah. You better cancel his ten o'clock with Madonna, he ain't gonna make it.\n\nAfter only being in L.A. five seconds, Rainbow Tremaine (he should get together with Rainbow Harvest from Mirror Mirror fame - you know, because they have the same first name) is already feeling the effects of the city's corrupting influence (the flowers in this town are soaked in pesticide and the granola is chock-full of artificial flavours). And not only that, a newspaper boy (Robert Wecker) informs Rainbow that his brother is dead, and tells him that The Lovedolls were the one's responsible. Meanwhile, Patricia Anne Cloverfield has bought herself a gun and has formed an alliance with Matt (Mike Glass), Tanya's boyfriend, and Switchblade Suzy (Annette Zilinskas), a disgruntled She-Devil.\n\nPossessed by the spirit of Gene Simmons, Carl Celery, wearing the appropriate makeup, shows up at a Bruce Springsteen concert carrying the gun given to him by Kitty Carryall. Hey, check out the Courtney Cox (Modi Frank) wannabe in the front row (she sort of looks like Bunny Tremelo). At any rate, as Bruce (Jordan Schwartz) is finishing up an lyrically altered version of \"Dancing in the Dark,\" Carl rushes the stage.\n\nSpeaking of people who sort of look like Bunny Tremelo, the ghost of Bunny Tremelo (complete with Linda Blair from The Exorcist sleepwear) appears in Kitty Carryall's bedroom. Warning her about the dark forces that are out to get her, the ghost of Bunny Tremelo gives Kitty the skinny on all the threats that are currently manifesting themselves against her.\n\nWhether she takes heed or not is anyone's guess. In the meantime, Kitty and Patch appear on Women On Women, a feminist talk show hosted by Gloria Biaz (Carmel Moran). The great thing about this sequence, besides the fact that Kitty and Patch fail to live up to Gloria's idea of what a feminist should look like, was Kitty Carryall's crossed legs sheathed in red tights. In addition to looking fabulous on her, the red tights are good indication that The Lovedolls are well on their way. Remember what I said in my review of Desperate Teenage Lovedolls? You don't? Well, let me repeat it: Colourful tights = success. You could also add: Crimped hair = success to the equation, as the more successful The Lovedolls become, the more crimps seem to appear in Kitty Carryall's hair.\n\nIn the coming scenes, Jennifer Schwartz can be seen in blue, footless tights (she wears them during her confrontation with Mrs. Cloverfield), a one piece bathing suit with Argentine theme (it reminded me of the flag of Argentina) with matching blue shades (she wears both during her pool side confrontation with Carl Celery), and a purple feather boa (which she wears during The Lovedolls show at the forum).\n\nYou'll notice I didn't mention Kitty Carryall's confrontation with Rainbow Tremaine during my Kitty Carryall fashion round up. Well, let me just say two words: Suicidal Tendencies. Oh, and my favourite Rainbow-ism uttered during this period was: \"I have become semi-rebellious!\" And it's no wonder, the city of Los Angeles. is no place for wide-eyed idealists, it warps your soul.\n\nJust like the first film, Lovedolls Superstar was shot on super-8. However, the sequel has a more polished sheen to it. Yet, the film has somehow managed to retain its gritty aesthetic. Depicting Hollywood as the cesspool that it probably is, Dave Markey (best known for, I guess, directing 1991: The Year Punk Broke) has made farcical romp that ridicules the city, while, at same time, celebrates its many quirks. My only complaint would be that Kitty Carryall doesn't get a love interest in either film. Call me a romantic sap, but I wanna see Kitty's luscious thigh's gingerly groped by a tattooed gentlemen caller whilst in the throes of consensual, Patti Smith-approved passion.\n\nvideo uploaded by Dave Markey\n\n↧\n\nGentlemen Broncos (Jared Hess, 2009)\n\nThe woefully untalented want to exploit you, the exceedingly powerful want to violate you. Or is it the other way around? Whatever. Is there any end to the degradation the creatively blessed must endure in order to get their voices heard in a world controlled by mindless vulgarians and their child-molesting allies? If it's not one thing, it's something else. And if it is in fact something else, when will something completely different come along and show us what something else looks like? Art. What is it? And what makes it so darned artistic? These, and many other non-erroneous questions, are answered in Gentlemen Broncos, a film by a bunch of people who live and work in and around an area known as the Utah-Idaho Conglomeratic Atmospheric Territory, a.k.a. U.I.C.A.T., or Ewww-eee Kaht, as it's pronounced on the mean streets of suburban Boise (its de facto capital). Even though the land the territory sits on is millions of years old, that doesn't mean Jared Hess (human deadpan dispensary) is over his head. Sure, he's only been alive in the U.I.C.A.T. for a fraction of that time, but that doesn't mean he hasn't been carefully observing the sheer ridiculousness of the regions current inhabitants. An unopened love letter to fashion and science fiction, the qu...Don't do it! Do what? Use the q-word in correlation to Gentlemen Broncos. What are you talking about? I've always been respectful to the LGBT population. Not queer, you uncoordinated fanny bandit. I'm talking about \"quirky.\" So, using quirky to describe a Jared Hess film is a no-no? A huge no-no. I mean, you had an interesting take on the film going and you had to go and ruin it by using the q-word. Well, you called me an uncoordinated fanny bandit. Yeah, but I was trying to be edgy. Kinda like those unjustifiably disaffected teens who post pictures of SS officers and car accident photos on their tumblrs.\n\nOn their tumb-what? Never mind. Anyway, while I loved Napoleon Dynamite, for some strange, or maybe, not-so strange, reason I skipped Nacho Libre (Jack Black as a Mexican monk/Luchador trying to save an orphanage rubs me the wrong way). Well, I'm happy to report that Jared Hess and the house that dang built are back doing what they do best. What that is exactly has yet to come to me. But I'm sure sometime over the next five or six hundred paragraphs I'll be able to succinctly state what it was that made this vomit-laden, hand cream-stained film stand out from the crowd.\n\nKicking things off with a cool opening credits sequence, one where the cast and crew are represented by the covers of various sci-fi paperbacks (if you watch the film a second time, you'll notice the covers are all pretty apt), we're quickly shown the makeshift cover of \"Yeast Lords,\" the sci-fi novel that will alter the course of the lives of a small group of quir...I mean, eccentric characters who call Saltair, Utah home (it says here that Carnival of Souls was shot in Saltair).\n\nBoasting a picture of a weaponized deer as its cover, the book is the work of Benjamin Purvis (Michael Angarano), a gifted teen who lives with his mother Judith (Jennifer Coolidge), a fashion designer, in their dome-shaped house. Invited to attend something called \"Cletus Festival,\" a writer's camp for young writers–it's the best writer's camp in the state according to Todd Keefe (Josh Pais)–Benjamin starts his journey of self-discovery by getting on a bus; but not before being told by his mother, \"Remember who you are and what you stand for.\" You should think about this line a bit when it's uttered, as it sums up this film's message in a nutshell.\n\nOn top of being budding writers, it would seem that all the kids on the bus are homeschoolers; which is...yeah, a thing, I guess. School at home, eh? Who would have thunk it?\n\nThe moment we've all been waiting for is...I'm sorry, I meant to say, the moment I've been waiting for is about to occur. And here it comes. Yes! We have Halley Feiffer! Boom! Exploding onto the screen like an angelic mist, Halley Feiff...Whoa, hold on. Who the fuck is Halley Feiffer? The hell? I can't believe you just interrupted my flow like that. Well, I'm not going to let you start blathering incoherently about some actress we've never heard of without giving us some clues as to where she fits into the Gentlemen Broncos universe.\n\nFine. As he's about to start eating his lunch at the Kozy Cafe, Benjamin is introduced to a vision of loveliness named Tabatha Jenkins (Halley Feiffer), a fellow author who specializes in French mysteries. Even the name, Tabatha Jenkins, sets my heart on fire. And why wouldn't it? I mean, \"Tabatha\" is alluring and exotic. Yet, \"Jenkins\" contains just the right amount of Welshness. Huh? You see, a Welsh name like, \"Jones\" doesn't contain enough Welshness, while \"Llewellyn\" contains too much...Welshness, that is.\n\nGesturing toward her lady area with a sheepish brand of self-assurance, Tabatha Jenkins asks Benjamin if she can borrow some money to buy some tampons. Are you sure she asked to \"borrow\" some money to buy some tampons? Oh, I'm sure.\n\nHow about Tabatha Jenkins' sheepish lady area gesture, did that really happen? You better believe it did. Hot Diggity! I think I'm falling in love with Tabatha Jenkins as well. Like you, I find tampons to be titillating to the max. Oh, and just in case you're wondering, a tampon is a plug of soft material that is inserted into the vagina to absorb menstrual blood. They should make a male tampon, because I just creamed my jeans.\n\nJumping Jehosaphat!!! Tabatha Jenkins didn't buy some tampons. She and her filmmaker pal Lonnie (Héctor Jiménez) bought snacks instead. I don't understand. She says they were out of tampons. But I'm not buying that. After all, Utah's state motto isn't the Tampon State for nothing (check their license plates if you don't believe me). Just kidding, the state's motto is \"Industry.\" Which, actually, in a strange sort of way, is still tampon-esque, if you think about it. According to Medical News Today, the feminine hygiene product market is worth billions of dollars every year.\n\nIf hearing Tabatha Jenkins say the word \"tampons\" wasn't hot enough for ya, you should see her when she gets an impromptu hand massage from Benjamin while her orally endowed dandy fop of a friend breathes on her exquisite neck. It's downright orgasmic. Are you sure this film was made by Mormons? I know, right?\n\nOnce settled in at Cletus Fest, Tabatha Jenkins comes over to Benjamin's room to hang, or, to use her words, \"get to know you better.\" (Even the way she stood in the doorway of his room was erotic.) Telling him that he won't get anywhere as an author unless he let's people beside his mom read his work, Benjamin reluctantly allows Tabatha Jenkins to read Yeast Lords, the epic tale of Bronco (Sam Rockwell) and his equally epic struggle reclaim one of his gonads, which has been stolen by Lord Daysius (Edgar Oliver), an evil mad scientist who commands an army of cyclopses.\n\nAs she starts to read Benjamin's manuscript on his bed, we're quickly ushered into the sci-fi world of Yeast Lords. Strapped to a table in a lab, the hirsute Bronco is bemoaning the loss of one of his gonads. Stolen by Dennis (who is also played by Edgar Oliver from Oddities), one of Lord Daysius' clones, Broncos' gonad is apparently going to be used to breed a new race of super-soldiers. Breaking free thanks to his pet Lynx, Korlaxx, Broncos grabs the jars that may or may not contain his missing gonad, and then...well, Tabatha Jenkins stops reading at this point.\n\nPlayed with pompous perfection, right down to the bluetooth earpiece (which he never uses), the mom jeans and bizarre accent, by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords), sci-fi author/artist (the man draws a mean cyborg harpy) Dr. Ronald Chevalier is Benjamin's hero. At Cletus Fest to be a judge (the winning manuscript will be sold in select bookstores nationwide) and teach a class on suffixes (\"The Power of the Suffix\"), Dr. Chevelier reads \"Yeast Lords\" after spotting it on the floor of his hotel room.\n\nWhy was it on the floor, you ask? Well, his publisher had just rejected his latest book (some claptrap about a moon foetus), so he threw all the manuscripts on the floor in a fit of rage. While all the manuscripts had bland notebook covers, the one with the battle stag on the cover caught his eye. Picking it up, we're sucked back into the world of Yeast Lords where Bronco is trying to sew his junk back on. Approached by a bald woman named Vanaya (Suzanne May), Bronco is, at first, weary of the top heavy cue ball. However, after smelling her breath (it smells like homemade licorice), Bronco agrees to let her and her brother Kanaya (Johnny Hoops) tag along.\n\nJust as Bronco, Vanaya, and Kanaya are about to lay siege to Lord Daysius' primary yeast factory, Dr. Chevalier stops reading. The look on his face says it all. Two people, besides his mother, have now read parts of Yeast Lords, and it's safe to say both think it's fucking awesome. While Tabatha Jenkins and Lonnie Donaho buy the film rights to Yeast Lords, Dr. Chevalier straight-up plagiarizes it. Using his talent with suffixes, Dr. Chevalier simply changes Bronco to Brutus, and proceeds to call the book his own.\n\nIf you thought Sam Rockwell was great as Bronco, you should see him as Brutus. Replacing his long beard with a neatly trimmed blonde mustache, Dr. Chevalier's version of Sam Rockwell is preening ninny who hates cyclopses. Actually, I think Brutus hates surveillance does just as much as he hates cyclopses.\n\nIt should go without saying, but I thought Halley Feiffer did a terrific job as Tabatha Jenkins, the complex woman who takes a liking to Benjamin, or, I should say, takes a liking to Benjamin's book. Don't worry, she realizes the error of her ways by the time the comeuppance is being handed out. At any rate, I recommend that you pay special attention to the trailer that appears before the screening of Lonnie Donoho's ultra-low budget version of Yeast Lords, as it gives you a taste of Halley Feiffer's range as a performer. In the trailer, for a film about a ranch hand, Logan (Michael Angarano), who is pursued romantically by Daisy (Halley Feiffer), the sister of his fiance, Halley rides a horse, wears a scrunchie face while submerged in a hot tub, ingests pills in a nightgown, and reclines on a sports car in what some might construed as an excessively leggy manner; I would never construed that, but I can see how some people might view it as excessive.\n\nAs she finished doing all these things, I decided right then and there that if Halley Feiffer isn't in a movie, I ain't watching it. Of course, this only applies to movies made after the year 2000.\n\nSure, things start to go off the rails once Mike White shows up in a blonde wig (he plays Dusty, Benjamin's guardian angel), but the film's message about staying true to yourself remains loud and clear. Altering the content of his book (which was written as a tribute to his father), Benjamin eventually stands up against the forces that are trying to exploit him; and he does so while wearing one of the pieces from his mother's nightgown collection, \"Decent Beginnings.\" Filled with scatological humour (snake poop, dog poop), vomit (Tabatha Jenkins swallows puke while wearing a fur vest at one point and Bronco uses pink, fire hose-quality projectile vomit to defeat a battle stag), Gentlemen Broncos is profoundly stupid, yet at the same time, a wonderfully entertaining and heartfelt movie.\n\n↧\n\nOffice Killer (Cindy Sherman, 1997)\n\nHave you ever wondered where all those energetic young people carrying backpacks are going when you see them walking around during the early morning hours? If you have, let me fill you in. They're headed to these large buildings filled with hallways that are lined with little metal boxes (if they want, I suppose they can put their backpacks inside these little metal boxes). What they actually do once inside these asbestos-filled buildings is anybody's guess. But after four years, some of them head over to another building to do a, I guess, variation of the same thing they did in the building they just left. Oh, and like the previous building, they usually spend about four years there. Why, you ask, did they spend such a huge chunk of their lives cloistered away in these unsightly structures? Well, to the best of my knowledge, they did it in order earn the opportunity sit in buildings that contain something called an \"office.\" However, unlike the other buildings, where you're allowed to leave during the time of year when the weather is warm, you're stuck inside this ghastly place for the rest of your life. That is, if you don't end up being murdered by a mousy co-worker or get fired for staring lustfully at Molly Ringwald's legs for a longer than normal period of time; which, according to the guidelines that dictate office behaviour, can be no longer than two seconds. Two seconds?!? You can't possibly expect the bank where I keep the majority of my spank-related images to be able to work with just lousy two seconds worth of visual stimuli? It's an erection nonstarter. Besides, when you say, \"staring lustfully at Molly Ringwald's legs,\" you're speaking metaphorically, right? Right? Hello? I'm sorry, I was just thinking about the question. No, it's not a metaphor. The film is Office Killer, and it's the place for fans of mid-90s Molly Ringwald to get their sultry redheaded kicks.\n\nIf you have always wanted to see a film where Carol Kane, Molly Ringwald, and Jeanne Tripplehorn act nasty to one another in an office environment (and who hasn't?), Office Killer is definitely the movie for you. Well, truth be told, I think Molly Ringwald provides most of the cattiness. And I would say that Jeanne Tripplehorn is mostly responsible for giving the project the clothes-adjusting awkwardness it desperately needs. What about Carol Kane? She does the shy murderess who's trying to figure out e-mail thing. Either way, they all end up bringing some much needed camp to the table.\n\nOh, and if you're wondering what \"clothes-adjusting awkwardness\" is, it's those subtle moments in the film when Jeanne Tripplehorn tries to adjust the fit of her ill-fitting office attire.\n\nHoly crap! I can't believe I just mentioned the word \"camp\" without it being adjacent to Barbara Sukowa, who plays Virginia Wingate, a.k.a. \"The Nicotine Queen,\" a.k.a. \"The Asthmatic Bitch,\" the editor-in-chief of Constant Consumer magazine. While sitting in her office, Virginia, who is being annoyed by Nora (Jeanne Tripplehorn), gives us our first taste of camp when she opens her mouth and begins to laugh. I know, that doesn't sound very campy. But you should have seen her. No-one laughs while holding a cigarette like Barbara Sukowa does. It also helps that she has long, black fingernails, likes to wear leather blazers, and is covered with about ten pounds worth of gaudy gold jewelry.\n\nThe office is thrown into chaos when a serial killer starts to...Just kidding, downsizing is the first thing to strike fear into the hearts of the employees of Constant Consumer, and it's Nora's job to hand out the letters telling certain workers that their hours have been reduced. You know the letter is going to be trouble just by looking at the way it starts: \"Dear Colleague.\" To make matters worse, a new computer system is being introduced to the office, which is being installed by Daniel Birch (Michael Imperioli), a computer expert; when I think of computer experts, I think of Michael Imperioli. Am I implying that an Italian-American can't be a computer expert? No, I'm implying that Michael Imperioli can't be one. In other words, I didn't buy him for a second as the office's resident Steve Wozniak.\n\nEww, see what you what you made me do? I just name-dropped Steve Wozniak. How pedestrian. Quick, start typing words about Molly Ringwald's first scene. Like I said, Molly Ringwald brings some much needed cattiness to the proceedings, and displays this cattiness right from the get-go by mocking Jeanne Tripplehorn's pink, two-sizes too big suit. To be fair, though, Jeanne Tripplehorn does make fun of Molly Ringwald's eye shadow first. Nonetheless, Molly's insult was totally justified (she's right, her suit is awful), while Jeanne's dig was way out of bounds (Molly's eye makeup is sublimely applied).\n\nYou can't really see what Molly Ringwald's Kim Poole is wearing in her opening scene. But later on you can definitely see that that she has on this sparkly silver-grey number. Sprawled out in a leg-friendly manner on a desk as Jeanne Tripplehorn and Michael Imperioli played with the office's new laptops, Molly Ringwald establishes early on that she and her many saucy headbands mean business.\n\nAfter accidentally electrocuting her sleazy boss, Gary Michaels (David Thornton- Mr. Cyndi Lauper), office drone Doreen Douglas (Carol Kane), who, unlike Kim Poole, needs a few pointers about proper makeup application, decides to take him home with her instead of calling the police. Don't worry, that's not a spoiler, it's obvious that Doreen is the \"office killer.\" Unfortunately, Kim Poole is the only one in the office who suspects there's something not right about this Doreen person. And while everyone loves to watch Kim strut around the office in her short skirts and black pantyhose, she's not exactly the most trustworthy (she's an ambitious go-getter who tells it like it is). This lack of trust causes a bit of a problem when Kim Poole tries to sound the alarm.\n\nBesides, who's gonna buy that a waifish woman with irregular eyebrows, one who takes care of her disabled mother (Alice Drummond), is the one bumping off employees? To add insult to injury, Jeanne Tripplehorn and her frighteningly imprecise bangs befriends Doreen. Which makes Molly Ringwald come off as a bully. When, in truth, she's the film's plucky heroine.\n\nMy favourite Molly Ringwald outfit is the grey skirt/black pantyhose/white pumps/tropical-themed top ensemble she wears during the bulk of the film's meaty middle section.\n\nThe runner-up being her post-I just got fired look. For someone who was recently fired, and, on top of that, nearly strangled to death in a dark stairwell, Kim Poole is looking pretty stylish, and, dare I say, relaxed, lounging in her skimpy, purple and blue paint splatter dress.\n\nWhile I admire Molly Ringwald's attempt re-invent herself as an actress by playing the office skank in a slasher film directed by famed photographer Cindy Sherman, it's the underrated Carol Kane who steals the show with her demented portrayal of an undervalued employee who keeps dead girl scouts in her basement.\n\nWhen they show that Doreen had in fact murdered the girl scouts who came to her door to sell cookies, I let out a \"yes!\" Not because I was glad they were dead. On the contrary, I think all little girls deserve to grow up to live long and productive lives. But because the film had the guts to \"go there.\"\n\nNow, of course, some might say it's easier to play demented as supposed to skanky (Molly Ringwald), or even bang-heavy (Jeanne Tripplehorn), but I thought Carol Kane did an excellent job balancing her character's demented side with her more mousy tendencies.\n\nExpertly photographed–and it should be given the level of the talent behind camera (including Todd Haynes)–Office Killer, while lacking the gore most horror fans crave, should be celebrated. Why? How often do you come across a film that star Carol Kane, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and a mid-90s era Molly Ringwald? That's right, not very often. So, yeah, the film should be celebrated. Just don't go into it thinking it's going to be a splatter-fest. The only splatter you'll find in this movie, is the paint on my second favourite Molly Ringwald outfit. If you're a horror fan who prefers camp to gore, and fashion to spine-tingling thrills, check this flick out immediately.\n\n↧\n\nBaby Blood (Alain Robak, 1990)\n\nIn a perfect world, every movie would be about parasitic, worm-like creatures who live inside the vaginas of gap-toothed French women with killer curves. But alas, the world is not perfect. However, when a film comes along that does feature bloodthirsty demon slugs and the roomy gashes they call home, you should jump on that cinematic grenade without even thinking. Sure, they will end up turning your insides into chop suey, but your spirit will thank you for having done so. Don't believe me? Just ask my spirit, it just watched Baby Blood (a.k.a. The Evil Within and Look Who's Talking 3: The Quickening), and it's been thanking me non-stop for the past two days straight. Speaking of insides blowing up, after viewing this film–which was directed by, what's it say here, Alain Robak, okay, Alain Robak–I've come to the sensible conclusion that arterial spray is the only true art form in existence. If you're wondering how I came to this conclusion, you need look no further than the soon to be bloodstained surfaces that litter in this fist pump-inducing film. Each person on the planet has enough blood coursing through their veins to create a masterwork. All you have to do is stand next something flat, a wall should suffice, open up your jugular with a sharp object (a knife seems to do the trick), and watch as the crimson splatter becomes a mind-altering work of art right before your dying eyes. A quick warning: You only get one chance to make an impression this way, so make it count, because you'll be long dead before the reviews of your blood painting start pouring in. In fact, you'll probably be dead before you hit the ground.\n\nJust like snowflakes, each arterial spray is unique. Depending on the manner you're cut, you could see a lot blood come out all at once, or you could see it come in short, controlled bursts. Also, diet plays a key role in the quantity and trajectory of your blood spray. If, say, you have a high fibre diet, you should expect a veritable gusher of blood (it's raining blood! hallelujah!). If, however, you eat nothing but sugary and fatty foods, your blood shower will be drizzly and sporadic at best.\n\nWhat I think I'm trying to say in my own awkward sort of way is that there's a lot of blood in this film. And why wouldn't there be? Funny you–who is actually me–should say that, as I was just thinking to myself as I watched the first victim crawl on his belly after being stabbed, where's the blood? Now, I'm not the kind of person who craves their movies to be filled with gore. But I do appreciate it when stabbing victims in movies bleed blood after being stabbed. It's just the way I was raised.\n\nNevertheless, after he was finished crawling in agony, and our \"pregnant\" protagonist decides to feed her chatty vagina monster his red nectar, I saw a torrent of blood that was beyond a gusher, it was a blood monsoon.\n\nEven though I was fully on board with the film and its kooky premise the moment the creature burst its way out of an agitated circus leopard and entered the vagina of a shapely, gap-toothed woman with tempestuous thighs, it wasn't until our gap-toothed (les dents du bonheur) heroin was drenched in eight pints of blood that I really started to nod to myself with an obnoxious brand of self-satisfied glee.\n\nScratch that. I was on board the moment we get a close up shot of Yanka's panties.\n\nAnyway, a new leopard has just been delivered to the Cirque de Lohman, a travelling circus currently performing somewhere in northern France, and you don't have to be an animal expert to figure out that its presence is agitating the other animals.\n\nThe woman attached to Yanka's panties, by the way, is a circus performer named, strangely enough, Yanka (Emmanuelle Escourrou), who lives in a trailer with Lohman (Christian Sinniger), the \"Lohman\" in Cirque de Lohman. Their relationship is a tad rocky; he's extremely jealous and she's been impregnated by a million year-old worm demon. No, actually, she's not pregnant yet. But she will be soon. After the leopard explodes, something slithers out of the cage and decides that Yanka's vagina would make a great new home.\n\nNoticing a slight weight increase the following morning (she weighs herself everyday), Yanka heads over to the local clinic to get tested. The shots of Emanuelle Escourrou walking, her thick thighs making mincemeat out of the puny French asphalt, from the clinic, her equally thick mane of brunette hair blowing in the wind, are exceptional.\n\nPacking a few things in a suitcase and grabbing a fist full of cash, Yanka hops aboard a train. Tracking her down to some squalid hellhole on the outskirts of town, Lohman confronts Yanka. Big mistake. Stabbing him the stomach, Yanka goes to finish him off, but she can't do it. As she cowers naked (her red robe fell off during the initial stabbing) in the other room, we get our first taste of the voice. That's right, the thing growing inside Yanka's uterus speaks. However, unlike Aylmer from Brain Damage, only Yanka can hear him. And what the vagina monster is saying at the moment mostly has to do with feeding it blood.\n\nVoiced by Gary Oldman, the vagina monster says, \"I want the blood of the man you killed. I need it to grow.\" I loved the way the vagina monster kept saying, \"slit his throat\" over and over again. After much coaxing, we're treated to a scene that can be pretty much summed this way: Stab. Spray. Scream. And repeat.\n\nYou'll notice that I call the thing living inside Yanka's vagina a \"monster.\" Well, even though he says several times that he is in fact not a monster, I can't think of any other word to describe him. I mean, he forces gorgeous, gap-toothed, curvy women to stab men so that he may feed on their blood. And, in my book, that's pretty monster-like. Yeah, I know, you just want to be born. But do so many people have to die in order for that to happen? Humans kill over 100 million sharks each year. Are humans monsters?\n\nThe vagina creature tells Yanka to leave the slum (it's unsafe), but not before she tries to drown herself. After being dumped at a gas station by a lothario-esque trucker (he decides to trade in one shapely, gap-toothed brunette for two German ladies who both look like amateur porn stars), Yanka eventually gets a job as a waitress.\n\nI like to call this period of Baby Blood: The Shapely Trimester. Using her man-puddle-creating curves to wrangle potential meals for her unborn demon child, Yanka sets her sights on Richard (Jean-François Gallotte), a frequent patron at the diner she works. Even though he's supposed to be going steady with a stylish (I dug her new wave-friendly outfits) cashier named Rosette (Roselyne Geslot), Richard can't help but be transfixed by Yanka's voluptuousness.\n\nWhen Yanka's belly gets too big, she puts aside her sex appeal, and gets a job as taxi driver. Taking out bespectacled joggers, Andy Kindler clones, kindly old women (the only death in the movie that involves a woman and no arterial spray), guys who give blood at mobile blood banks, and paramedics, Yanka is determined to bring her baby to term. In her mind, she might as well get it over with. Considering the amount of crap she's had to put up with over the last nine months, it only makes sense for her to want it to go smoothly. Whether she feels the same way after its born is another story all together.\n\nChanneling Isabelle Adjani from Possession, the alluring, gap-toothed Emmanuelle Escourrou is fearless as Yanka, the plucky soon-to-be mom who kills for her unborn demon child. Giving one of the best blood-face performances in film history, Emmanuelle sets the bar pretty high for all those who want to come off as convincing while covered in six pints of blood.\n\nOh, and when I refer to Emmanuelle as \"gap-toothed,\" I don't mean to imply that it's a negative. On the contrary, Emmanuelle's gap is one of the film's strongest attributes (the gap is used to great effect during the journey that takes us inside Yanka, as the camera zooms through her gap). The same goes for her shapeliness. You hardly ever see a woman who looks like Emmanuelle in so-called mainstream movies. Which is a shame, because Emmanuelle is the kind of woman most honest heterosexuals are drawn to. Yet, the powers that be seem to think they prefer malnourished boy-mannequins.\n\nIf you're like me, and you're a fan unruly vaginas and the shapely women who wield them, and you have a soft spot for arterial spray, and think gap-toothed chicks are the bee's knees, you need to see Baby Blood. It's French. It's disgusting. And, most importantly, it's awesome.\n\nuploaded by Superamak\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nAll the Colours of the Dark (Sergio Martino, 1972)\n\nIf a movie causes you to check your body for Satanic tattoos after it's over, you know it's doing something right. Hey, you know what they say? Post-consumption bodily self-inspection is the cornerstone of fine art. I'm also curious to know how many pairs of black, almost knee-high boots were sold after All the Colours of the Dark (a.k.a. They're Coming to Get You) hit the faces of the boot-loving populace back in the early 1970s. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if they [the boot manufactures] had a booth set up in the theatre lobby. And why not? I mean, who wouldn't want to emulate the stylish sophistication Edwige Fenech exudes throughout this giallo thriller with supernatural overtones? Sure, some of us can only dream of being a chic brunette with a blemish-free T-zone and a pair of legs that are creamy enough to be poured into the blackest, almost knee-high boots money can buy, but that's where Italian cinema comes in. Designed to plug up the gaping holes that litter our pathetic, non-boot-adorned lives, writer-director Sergio Martino (Torso) has created a fantastical world jam-packed with the kind of images that will make you swoon like a baby that was just secreted from the wart-laden slip 'n slide that is your average witch's birth canal. Funny, I didn't know witch babies liked movies that featured Satanic rituals, freaky dream sequences, blue-eyed dagger enthusiasts, and angelic women with dark hair who writhe a lot? They should, but they don't. Then again, I was speaking metaphorically. Actually, the film is pretty sparse when it comes to scenes that involve Satanists doing what Satanists do best, and that is, of course, worshiping Satan. And, come to think of it, the film seemed to be lacking in the freaky dream sequence department. But as far as blue-eyed dagger enthusiasts and angelic brunettes go, this is the film to see to get your fill of both.\n\nEven though I thought his eyebrows could use a bit of a trim, Ivan Rassimov makes his presence felt almost immediately as...well, he's credited as \"Mark Cogan,\" but I like to call him the blue-eyed dagger enthusiast. Why is that, you ask? Well, for starters, his eyes are blue. And secondly, he's always carrying a dagger in a manner that struck me as enthusiastic. Which got me a thinking. If you put those two distinct character traits together, you get: Blue-eyed dagger enthusiast.\n\nI don't think I have to explain why I called Edwige Fenech's character an angelic woman with dark hair. Don't forget, an angelic woman who also writhes a lot. Yeah, yeah, who writhes a lot. If you want me to explain why, I'll be more than happy to. Hmmm, judging by your frantic head shaking, I'll take that as a no. Your loss.\n\nDon't be fooled by the serenity that greets us right off the bat (the opening credits are an unbroken shot of a pastoral pond), because things are are about to get sick, brainsick, that is.\n\nSuddenly, a clock appears out of nowhere. A crazed old woman with bad teeth screams (for added creepiness, she's dressed like a little girl). A naked pregnant woman with a large black afro lies on a table ready to give birth. Then we're shown a close up of a pair icy blue eyes, followed by some quick shots of a dagger in motion. What's going on? I haven't the slightest idea. But when all is said and done, everyone, including a naked brunette lying on a bed, are covered in stab wounds. Transported to a country road at night, the sequence ends after a car crashes into a tree. The second the car is about to hit the tree, Jane Harrison (Edwige Fenech) wakes up in her London flat and wanders in a daze towards her London bathroom.\n\nJust like Winona Ryder's character in Heathers, Jane showers with her clothes on when she's stressed out. And just like Winona Ryder, Edwige Fenech is so gorgeous, it's scary. As you watch Edwige Fenech in the early going of All the Colours of the Dark, you can't help but think: How is it physically possible for someone to be this attractive. I mean, it's unreal. Anyway, her boyfriend, what's this guys name? Oh, yeah, Richard (George Hilton), shows up just in time to comfort her by caressing her naked body and feeding her vitamins.\n\nNeither seem to work, however, as Jane has the stab dream again. Leaving her flat (a cool art deco apartment complex), Jane is accompanied by her sister Barbara (Nieves Navarro), who, by the way, is the exact same height as Edwige Fenech, to see Dr. Burton (George Rigaud), a shrink; despite Richard's objections (he thinks they're all a bunch of quacks).\n\nGuess who Jane sees in the waiting room? She sees Ivan Rassimov's blue-eyed dagger enthusiast, that's who. On top of being enthusiastic about daggers, it would seen that he also enjoys lurking and stalking. Wait a minute, did you say he enjoys lurking and stalking? Yes, I think I did. You won't believe this, but I have \"enjoys lurking and stalking\" listed on my Match.com profile. Except, I have it listed as \"stalking and lurking,\" not \"lurking and stalking.\"\n\nOf course, Dr. Burton doesn't believe Jane when she tries to tell him that she saw the blue-eyed dagger enthusiast who enjoys lurking and stalking, and stalking and lurking, in the waiting room. But don't worry, Barbara corroborates Jane's story that there was in deed a blue-eyed dagger enthusiast sitting in the waiting room at one point. You should have seen me the moment when Barbara backs up Jane's story, I was all like: In your face, Dr. Burton! You should spend less time leering at Edwige Fenech's fetching knees, and more time listening to your patients problems.\n\nThough, I have to admit. If you're going to leer at a woman's knees, you can't beat the knees attached to Edwige Fenech. I mean, c'mon. They're fantastic.\n\nAfter being told by Dr. Burton that she is \"quite sane,\" Jane heads down to the subway. Sitting crossed-legged, the exposed leg skin languishing between the bottom of her skirt and the top of her boots no doubt causing many trouser-related irregularities to occur in the London underground that day, Jane can't help but overhear an asinine conversation being conducted by a typical English family. When her car eventually empties out, Jane notices that she and a man in a tan trench coat are the only ones left. No worries, right? Wrong. It's the blue-eyed dagger enthusiast. And every time the lights flicker, he seems to get closer. Realizing that it's only a matter of time before he is sitting on her not yet damp lap, Jane makes a run for it.\n\nIt might seem weird now, but back in the early 1970s lot's of people were joining Satanic cults on a whim. And Jane is no different. When she arrives home after being harassed by the blue-eyed dagger enthusiast, Jane meets Mary (Marina Malfatti), her blonde upstairs neighbour. The two hit it off immediately. While walking through the park, Mary suggests to Jane that she should join the Satanic cult she belongs to–you know, to clear her head. Like I said, nowadays, no-one wants to join a Satanic cult, but Jane seems open to the idea.\n\nIn fact, she's so open, she agrees to attend today's meeting. But first, she's got to get attacked by the blue-eyed dagger enthusiast; it's in her contract. When the attack, complete with crazy editing and the kick ass music of Bruno Nicolai, is over, it's ritual time, baby! You can tell just by looking at him that Mr. McBrian (Julián Ugarte) is the leader of this particular Satanic cult. How could I tell? Well, for starters, check out his beard. And secondly, the long fingernails and the gaudy, eyeball-centric jewelry are dead giveaways.\n\nWhile watching her drink fresh fox blood, and be inundated with many kisses, I think it's safe to say that Jane is now in league with Satan. Will this new allegiance help quell Jane's nightmares? Who's to say? It doesn't, however, mean that the blue-eyed dagger enthusiast is ever going to leave her alone.\n\nQuick question: Why is Lisa Leonardicredited as \"Girl with dog\"? Yeah, she's walking a dog. But don't you think \"Girl with killer gams\" would have been more appropriate?\n\nRepeatedly told that, \"you belong to us,\" Jane soon finds out that Satanic cults are easier to join, than they are to unjoin. And not to mention the eyeball triangle tattoo that all the Satanics get is a pain in the ass to remove, especially if you get one on your ass. Dripping style (short skirts and killer production design) and replete with trippy thrills (if you're going to be chased around London by a creepy dude with piercing blue eyes, you can't beat Ivan Rassimov, he rocks), All the Colours of the Dark is so chic it hurts. Great locations, awesome soundtrack, yeah, yeah, there could have been more gore, but Sergio Martino makes stalking seem cool again; not that it ever went out of fashion. A gorgeous leading lady and an effective villain make this Italian giallo worth a look-see.\n\nuploaded by braniki1\n\nSpecial thanks to ido for recommending this chichi film.\n\n.\n\n↧\n\nIn the Folds of the Flesh (Sergio Bergonzelli, 1970)\n\nIs anyone mentally sound in the cloistered world of In the Folds of the Flesh? I, for one, hope everyone is completely meshuganah. But then again, I prefer to watch movies where a large percentage of the cast are playing characters that have been recently diagnosed as clinically insane. Strangely enough, the only people who seem to have their mental shit together in this movie are the seemingly unending concourse of creeps and lowlifes who show up at the door of the only family on the block who have a room set aside solely for the disposal of dead bodies. Come for the incest and squawking vultures, stay for mid-rape decapitations and sickly subterranean acid baths. In fact, if everyone wasn't so stylish, I would have probably ran straight for the nearest exit the second the crazy chick in the blonde wig started to freak out when I tried to touch her \"hair.\" If you must know why I tried to touch it, I guess I was just curious to know how soft it was. One guy paid the ultimate price for touching her \"hair,\" as his head is no longer sitting atop the area where human heads normally sit. That's right, it was forcibly removed seconds after he pulled her wig off and proceeded to do the \"I've got Falesse's hair\" victory dance (I'll explain who Falesse is in a minute). Then again, what do you expect from a guy who wears an orange turtleneck sweater in the middle of the day? My sentiments exactly. Speaking of gaudy clothing, like I said, everyone in this film who is not a creep or a lowlife is stylish, and the best example of this stylishness are the shirts worn by Emilio Gutiérrez Caba. Making my eyes bleed a syrupy, chic-like substance every time they appeared on-screen, the shirts worn by this sick twist were off the charts in terms of busyness. At times he looks like he should be selling bongs in Haight-Ashbury, while other times he looked like he should be playing bass in the Zombies, especially when he's wearing that turtle green Nehru shirt-jacket. Wait, if this particular garment is \"turtle green,\" shouldn't he be playing bass in the Turtles? I'd appreciate it if you didn't contradict me in front of everyone like that. Whatever.\n\nEither way, you're both wrong. You see, the Turtles dressed like slobs (at least they did in the pictures I've seen), and the Zombies usually wore beatwear (natty suits with skinny ties). No, what I think you're looking for as far as allusions go is Strawberry Alarm Clock, as I can totally see the shirts Emilio Gutiérrez Caba wears throughout In the Folds of the Flesh (a.k.a Nelle Pieghe della Carne) being worn by the \"Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow\" band at the height of their...pillowiness.\n\nAll right, now that we've cleared that up. Is it okay if I go ahead and try to decipher the convoluted head trip/fashion show/pseudo-giallo that is this movie? Are you talking to me? If so, than, yeah. Go for it!\n\nFirst off, who keeps vultures as pets? This family's taste in pets is almost as quirky as their fashion sense. *snap* At any rate, don't ask me happens what goes on during the film's pre-opening credits body burying montage, 'cause I have no idea what Lucille (Eleonora Rossi Drago), the brunette alpha-milf who seems to be the one in charge when it comes to disposing the myriad dead bodies that seem to always need burying at this palatial villa located on the outskirts of a fever dream.\n\nTold via flashback, Lucille is digging a hole for yet another decapitated man, when, all of a sudden, a fugitive from justice named Pascal (Fernando Sancho) wanders onto her property while trying to evade capture. Noticing a sexy woman burying something in the woods, Pascal stops to watch as she dumps what looks like the body of a male human in the hole she just dug. Eventually caught by the police, Pascal gives Lucille the stink-eye as he is being lead away in handcuffs. Even though Pascal doesn't tell the cops what he saw, you know he'll be back to cause trouble.\n\nWho knew it would take thirteen years. But that's exactly what occurs, as we flash-forward thirteen years to find Lucille, looking the same as she did when we first met her, doing what she does best. No, not burying headless bodies. Gardening in black clothing.\n\nUnexpectedly, it's Michel, not Pascal, who's the first to pay Lucille a visit. A man with some sort of connection to the family, Michel meets Lucille, who, like I said, is a sexy brunette, her son Collin (Emilio Gutiérrez Caba), and her daughter Falesse (Pier Angeli). While they're getting acquainted, Michel's German Shepherd is getting all up in the beaky grills of Kiki and Kyoko, Lucille's pet vultures. Seriously, who keeps vultures as pets?\n\nWhile Pier Angeli makes an electrifying first appearance (she's wearing a yellow fur number), I was disappointed by what Emilio Gutiérrez Caba had on in his debut scene as an adult (we see him briefly as a child during the film's opening sequence). Never fear fans of outre fashion, Emilio is seen wearing that turtle green, Nehru-style shirt jacket (with a bling-friendly gold necklace) that I mentioned earlier once the action moves inside.\n\nAs I was admiring the cut of his shirt jacket (actually, I think it's more of a jacket, than it is a shirt, but really, who cares?), I couldn't help notice that Collin was mock devouring one of Falesse's feet. Aren't they supposed to be brother and sister? Maybe I'm being prudish, but I don't think siblings should mock devour anything. Nevertheless, I dug Collin's look, and the slinky polka-dot number Falesse has since changed into.\n\nSpoiler alert. Is that correct way to do it? Just say, \"spoiler alert\"? Should I write in all caps? Whatever. I've never seen anyone strangle a dog to death before. And I must say, it's pretty messed up. However, to the surprise of virtually no-one, Falesse stabs Michel while he's wearing the world's gaudiest bathrobe. Why she did it, I'm not sure. Nonetheless, the sight of Pier Angeli hovering over Michel's dead body holding a dagger in her hand was kinda awesome.\n\nAnother man named Alex, a friend of Michel's, wearing an orange turtleneck, shows up the following morning. I wonder what's going to happen to him? Get real, you know exactly what's going to happen to him. While we're being real, let's be frank as well. If you're a man and you happen to wander onto the property belonging to Lucille, the queen of the ice milfs, there's a good chance your genitals will be soaking in a giant vat of acid when all is said and done.\n\nIt should be pointed out that Pier Angeli wears a yellow top with a yellow neck scarf (check out the matching yellow pumps) and a leopard-print vest and skirt. If that sounds like the greatest ensemble ever to be assembled in an Italo-Spanish co-production, one that opens with a Sigmund Freud quote, you're right, it absolutely is.\n\nEven though Alex is a \"parasite,\" Collin's words, not mine, I liked the way he owned his parasitic nature. Telling Falesse straight up that he plans on seducing her, the way his says, \"I'm no amateur... I've got technique\" made my skin crawl. But in an odd way, I admired his confidence.\n\nWhile entertaining Alex for dinner, Falesse has since changed into a belly revealing all-black number (one that includes black nylons). But it's Collin who steals the show with his puffy shirt covered in swirling waves of orange and red. As I watched him touch his sister in a manner that could best be described as \"inappropriate,\" I had this sudden urge to listen to some King Crimson on my aging hi-fi. Yeah. In fact, I want to wear this particular shirt while listening to \"Moonchild\" sitting cross-legged in the vicinity of a babbling brook.\n\nNote to self: If I'm ever in bed with Falesse, make sure to keep an eye on her at all times. She will cut your head off when you're not looking. But most importantly, don't touch her hair; only her father can touch her hair. Okay, if you do end up touching her hair, which is actually a wig. Whatever you do, don't pull it off. If you start doing a dance while holding her wig that is clearly designed to ridicule her, then you're just asking to have your head cut off.\n\nMental illness was obviously viewed differently in 1970. All you have to do is take one look at the brief looney bin montage that appears at the film's midway point to figure this out. Despite the fact that most of the women are merely misunderstood lesbians with wild imaginations (in other words, completely sane), this short segment, on top of giving us concrete proof that there is in deed life beyond the walls of the villa, acts as an excellent showcase for costume designer Giuseppe Cesare Monello, the real hero in the In the Folds of the Flesh universe.\n\nMisunderstood lesbian #1: Snowflake Girl. Outfit: An orange cardigan paired with a saucy black beret. Ideal location for a first date: An ice rink. Misunderstood lesbian #2: Paperdoll Girl. Outfit: Brown and gold floral blouse. Ideal location for a first date: An arts and crafts trade show.\n\nMisunderstood lesbian #3: Toga Girl. Outfit: A purple and orange toga. Ideal location for a first date: The Danforth. Misunderstood lesbian #4:Nana Mouskouri Girl. Outfit: Glasses and a black dress with black boots. Ideal location for a first date: Duh, The Danforth. Misunderstood lesbian #5: Laughing Girl. Outfit: A brown sweater. Ideal location for a first date: The movies.\n\nMisunderstood lesbian #6: Doll Girl. Outfit: A floral dress that features at least three types of blue. Ideal location for a first date: Toys \"R\" Us. Misunderstood lesbian #7:Lili Taylor Girl. Outfit: A red cardigan over a black turtleneck. Ideal location for a first date: I'm going to say, something Lili Taylor-related (Mini-golf with a John Cusack type). Misunderstood lesbian #8: Glove Girl a.k.a. Eurotrash Maureen McCormick (María Rosa Sclauzero). Outfit: Pastel-coloured dresses and white gloves. Ideal location for a first date: Church or Brady Fest '95.\n\nWhen Pascal, the brutish fugitive from thirteen years ago, finally does show up at the villa, it's been sufficiently established that all male visitors are doomed to have their heads chopped off. In other words, it's Pascal, not Lucille, Falesse (nicknamed \"Chickadee\" by Pascal), and Collin (Pascal simply calls him \"Brat\"), who we should be worried about. Only problem being, all the men who seem to show up are basically scumbags. Nonetheless, as Pascal's blackmail scheme gets underway, we learn more about this family's demented past. Sexual abuse, tartan skirts, vultures, swings, mobsters, cynanide baths, shoot outs, and Nazis, they're all trotted out for our psychosexual amusement. If you like your camp high, your fashion bold, and your women batshit crazy, you should definitely check out In the Folds of the Flesh; I give it five busy shirts out of twenty-five, and eleven gaudy bathrobes out of forty-two.\n\nuploaded by StrangeVice1\n\n↧\n\nYou Killed Me First (Richard Kern, 1985)\n\nI'd like to start off by saying, Happy Canadian Thanksgiving! Of course, on this side of the imaginary line that separates the U.S.A. and Canada, it's simply called \"Thanksgiving,\" but I like to emphasize the holiday's nationalistic component whenever addressing an international audience; hello to my equally imaginary friends in Mordovia and Transnistria. While I realize it's technically not Thanksgiving today, that doesn't mean we can't pretend it is. Besides, I'm not going to let some kitschy wall calendar dictate my behaviour. As everyone knows, I despise award shows (they're vulgar and crass), loathe political speeches (they're filled with insincere nonsense vocalized by non-practicing child molesters), and can't stand calendars (they're...well, they're just plain stupid). Greetings. The reason I'm currently spewing semi-nonsensical vitriol is because I'm trying to reconnect with my inner disaffected teen. Why am I doing this, you ask? Isn't it obvious? Having just watched You Killed Me First from start to finish for the very first time, I would like to get into the mindset of Elizabeth (Lung Leg), or, I should say, \"Cassandra,\" the sullen teen at the centre of this Richard Kern-directed slice/slab/piece of so-called \"transgressive cinema.\" If you thought it was easy for me to identify with Cassandra, you would be wrong. Sure, I saw a lot of myself in Lung Leg's portrayal of alienated youth; hanging around my room all day listening to Wiseblood's \"Motorslug,\" destroying my clothes (i.e. making them \"cooler\"), and acting like a total brat at the dinner table. But I'm not that person anymore. What's shocking is, how much I identified with Karen Finley as Cassandra's mother. It's true, I mostly envied the fact that David Wojnarowicz (Cassandra's dad) got to plow into Karen Finley's vagina with his penis on a regular basis (whether that \"basis\" was semi-regular or not is still open to debate). Yet, part of me empathized with her motherly distress.\n\nWill wonders never cease? I just remembered the reason I started off on that tangent about Thanksgiving: You Killed Me First begins and ends on Thanksgiving. Yeah, yeah, they don't actually mention the t-word, but it's clear, judging by the large turkey on the table, that it's Thanksgiving. Anyway, what we see in-between these dinner scenes is some of the best teen angst ever to be captured on film.\n\nSpeaking of teen angst, remember how sad you felt when you heard that My So-Called Life had been cancelled? No? Well, I do. And the acerbic tone Richard Kern strikes in this film is the direction I would have liked to have seen My So-Called Life take if Angela Chase and the gang had made it to season two. Come to think of it, My So-Called Life and You Killed Me First already have a lot in common. Just replace Claire Danes' flannel-heavy get-up with a torn Scrapping Foetus Off The Wheel t-shirt, and you're already two-thirds of the way there.\n\n\"Lately, I can't even look at my mother without wanting to stab her repeatedly.\" ~ Angela Chase\n\nUpon further inspection, it would seem that the Thanksgiving dinner from Hell that opens You Killed Me First is the same dinner that closes the film. How do I know this? Well, for one thing, all the actors are wearing the same clothes. And secondly, what occurs after Lung Leg's incoherent rant is an extended flashback sequence that tries to explain how we ended up in this sticky diaphragm of a situation.\n\nSitting down for turkey dinner on Thanksgiving, mom (Karen Finley) and dad (David Wojnarowicz) seem worried about their daughter Elizabeth (Lung Leg), who is constantly dropping her fork on the floor. On the other hand, their other daughter, Deborah (Jessica Craig-Martin) is a model of Ronald Reagan-approved docility. Asking her if she washed her hands, Elizabeth answers by saying, \"fuck no.\" I like this chick already. When the topic shifts to Elizabeth's boyfriend, her father starts throwing around words such as \"scum\" and \"slime.\"\n\nJust as her mom is about to lose it (the lovely Karen Finley rocks when it comes to losing it at the dinner table), Lung Leg launches into this long tirade. Her piercing eyes filled anger, Lung Leg tells her parents how much she really hates them. As she's about to finish her diatribe, we go back to a, now, I don't want to say \"happier time,\" let's just say, a different time. Doing what most teenage girls did in 1985, Elizabeth plays with her puppets while listening to industrial music.\n\nIt's when Elizabeth introduces her shady-looking boyfriend to her parents that we learn that she wants to, from now on, to be called \"Cassandra.\"\n\nYou gotta love the scene where Karen Finley gives Lung Leg a haircut. Telling Elizabeth that she's giving her \"the wind swept look,\" the kind you see in \"Mademoiselle Magazine.\" She also calls it \"the new wave look,\" and compares it to the hairdo Liza Minnelli sported at the time. Of course, Elizabeth/Cassandra does not approve of this. Which, I have to admit, I didn't quite understand. I mean, who doesn't want to look like Liza Minnelli?!?\n\nThings continue to go downhill when Karen Finley buys Lung Leg a sweater at the local shopping centre. As expected, Lung Leg is horrified by this shitty garment. But get this, Karen tells her that she bought the cheapest one because she knew that she would probably end up ripping it up and writing \"fucker anarchy\" all over it. Awesome, eh? I wouldn't have guessed it, but Karen Finley is a cool mom.\n\nNow, normally this is where I would declare the hair cutting and sweater buying scenes to be my favourite parts of the movie. But I can't do that. Not when there's a scene in the film where Karen Finley wears black stockings while being fucked from behind.\n\nAfter a series of scenes that involve praying (Karen Finley in a pink dress), mock gun play (foreshadowing, baby), dead bunny rabbits, puking puppets, and art criticism (Karen Finley in a red dress), we're back where we started, the dinner table.\n\nSpoiler alert: Shouting, \"My name is Cassandra! You killed me first!\" Lung Leg shoots Karen Finley in the head. This may sound like hyperbole, but I'm declaring Karen Finley's death in You Killed Me First to be the best movie death in film history. Why? The way she screams (which is complimented by some subtle arterial spray), pauses for a second, then violently rocks back and forth a couple of times (she almost falls out of her chair), before finally expiring was inspirational; I get goosebumps and half-moist just thinking about it. Call me a sick twist, but I could watch Karen Finley's death scene in You Killed Me First over and over again.\n\n↧\n\n99 Women (Jess Franco, 1969)\n\nTiming it so that when the new prisoners (a.k.a. \"the new fish\") are brought in, it's the first thing they see, Rosalba Neri makes sure they get an eyeful of her reclining in her black stay-up stockings. It's obvious that Zoe (Rosalba Neri) knows exactly what she's doing. Fiddling with the tops of her stockings the same way a car mechanic fiddles with an engine, Rosalba Neri has powerful stems, and it's clear from the get-go that she isn't afraid to wield them in a manner that will help her curry favour with others. When incarcerated in a prison located on an island off the coast of Panama, some people use their wits to survive, others use brute force. Well, I got news for you, honey, Rosalba Neri, a.k.a. Prisoner #76, uses her gams. You would be surprised how much one can get done when you own a shapely pair of Italian legs. Who needs cigarettes when you've got legs for miles. If you think it's strange that I've mentioned Rosalba Neri four, wait, make that, five times, even though I have yet to mention the name of the film, you clearly have no idea who you're dealing with. To not open with a bit on Rosalba Neri's stocking-encased legs as they appear in 99 Women, the Jess Franco (R.I.P.) movie that became the blueprint for almost every women in prison flick that followed it, would be an act of pure dishonesty. Staring me square in the face at all times, to not comment on the full-court leg show Rosalba Neri puts on in this film would be a tell tale sign that I have completely lost my mind. And, as you can plainly see, judging by the content of some of the words I've assembled so far, my mind is not even close to being lost. In fact, you could say, my mind is sharper than its ever been. And to think, I have Rosalba Neri, and her scrumptious calves, her smooth thighs, her pert feet, and, not to mention, her sturdy knees, to thank for keeping my mind in tip-top shape.\n\nAfter Bruno Nicolai's \"The Day I Was Born\" has finished being awesome on the soundtrack, and the new prisoners have been processed, Rosalba Neri's Zoe greets Helga, a.k.a. Prisoner #97 (Elisa Montés), who shows up dressed like a Las Vegas showgirl, Natalie Mendoza, a.k.a. Prisoner #98 (Luciana Paluzzi), a heroin addict in a red sweater, and Marie, a.k.a. Prisoner #99 (Maria Rohm), a naive blonde, by taunting them with her sturdy, black stocking-covered legs.\n\nHer legs dangling seductively from a drab, oversize, blueish work shirt, Rosalba Neri tells them, \"Welcome to the club,\" while boasting a catty smile. Adjusting the makeshift ties that keep her stockings up as the new fish find their bunks, it's obvious that Rosalba Neri enjoys her stockings just as much as I enjoy writing about them.\n\nYou have to wonder, though, why does Rosalba Neri get to wear stockings? I mean, Helga enters the prison, which has been nicknamed \"The Castle of Death,\" wearing a pair of showgirl issue fishnet pantyhose, yet you don't see her wearing them after she's been processed. Her legs are just as unadorned as everyone else who is not named Rosalba Neri. Why is that? What is so special about Rosalba Neri? You kidding, right? Oh, I know, she's gorgeous beyond belief. Yeah, but, Thelma Diaz (Mercedes McCambridge), the prison's sappho-aligned superintendent, doesn't seem like she's the kind of person who would allow such rules to be violated. And it's obvious that this prison has a strict dress code.\n\nIn fact, violating the dress code is the sort of thing that would land you in one of the prison's infamous \"punishment cells.\"\n\nAre Thelma Diaz and Rosalba Neri's character super-secret lovers? Maybe. The superintendent does seem to go easy on her. No, think about it. Even though Rosalba Neri is caught fighting on several occasions, I don't ever recall seeing her in one of the punishment cells. Good point. But did it ever occur to you that Thelma just wants, like any sane individual, to see Rosalba Neri's wheels sheathed black nylons around the clock?\n\nAfter all, Rosalba Neri was the hottest stripper in the underground lesbian bar scene. In other words, dykes dig her. Interesting. What's interesting? Nothing. No, c'mon. Tell us. Okay, I couldn't help but notice that you used the past tense when describing Rosalba Neri's time as a stripper. Right. Well, for one thing, she's currently in prison. But even if she wasn't, in prison, that is, I don't think she would doing much stripping at bars that cater to discerning lesbians. You see, we learn, via flashback, that Rosalba Neri worked at as a stripper at an underground lesbian bar. You already mentioned that. Oh, yeah. The woman who hires her, a sophisticated lesbian named Grace, is pissed that Rosalba Neri plans to marry her boyfriend.\n\nAngry that Rosalba Neri is about to waste her hotness, and, not to mention, her first-rate stems, on some heterosexual man with a penis, Grace confronts her with a gun.\n\nAs we soon find out, Rosalba Neri is not someone to be trifled with. A struggle ensues, and, after one thing leads to another, the gun goes off, and just like that, Rosalba Neri finds herself in a drab work shirt with the number seventy-six written on it.\n\nThe great thing about the Rosalba Neri flashback sequence is that it's quite lengthy (it fleshes her character out more than all the other cast members combined), and it wonderfully showcases her beauty in a non-prison environment. Seriously, if you thought Rosalba Neri looked good in a drab work shirt and black hold-up stockings, you should see the candlelight stripetease number she performs for a small gathering of lesbians; it's out of sight.\n\nIf I wasn't convinced that Rosalba Neri was leggy cognizant before the stocking flaunting scene, the scene where she shows Marie her leg in a boastful fashion sealed the deal for me. Recovering from the injuries she suffered in a fight (one that Helga totally started) in the prison's infirmary, Rosabla Neri, who seems to have hurt her left leg during the melee, hovers menacingly over Marie, who is crying in her bed.\n\nTelling her, well, telling her first to, \"shut up,\" Rosalba Neri then says, \"You hurt my leg. My beautiful leg.\" And as she is saying the second part, she extends the damaged gam (revealing the full force of its gammage) and mock gestures towards it like it were a new car waiting to be won on The Price Is Right.\n\nIt should go without saying, but Rosalba Neri's ostentatious leg display in the infirmary scene is probably one of the greatest leg moments in film history. And the fact she is still wearing a stocking on her uninjured leg makes it even greater.\n\nStruggle, straddle. Straddle, struggle. Light jazz. Rinse and repeat.\n\nIn a veiled attempt to make this look like a legitimate movie review, here's bit about the film's plot: The prison's stern superintendent, Thelma Diaz, is being evaluated by an idealistic woman named Leonie Carroll (Maria Schell), a young up-and-comer in the cut-throat world of women's corrections. Dismayed by Thelma's harsh treatment of the prisoners, Miss Carroll tries to placate her harshness with a softer, more humane approach to incarceration. While these two butt heads with one another over their respective rehabilitation techniques, the island's governor, Governor Santos (Herbert Lom), is mainly concerned with satisfying his carnal lust.\n\nTo the surprise of virtually no-one, Miss Carroll's kid gloves approach fails miserably, as Marie, Helga, and Rosalie (Valentina Godoy), a short-haired redhead with a wonderfully round bum, flee into the jungle when no-one is looking. And why was no-one looking, you ask? Ask Miss Carroll. It was her bright idea to take the guards off night watch. In her mind, the prisoners won't want to escape if you treat them with respect. Anyway, I started to lose interest once the film turned into a jungle fugitive flick. I mean, if you're not going to bring Rosalba Neri along, what's the point? Exactly. There isn't one. No Neri, no watchy. It's that simple.\n\nLacking the graphic violence of its cinematic cousins, such as Bare Behind Bars, Women's Prison Massacre, and Jess Franco's own Barbed Wire Dolls, 99 Women has quality acting (Mercedes McCambridge and Herbert Lom are both excellent) and old school titillation (two words: Rosalba Neri) on its side, as the film trades over the top gore for thrills of a more subtle nature.\n\nDon't be alarmed, though, the film still packs quite the wallop, as they say. It's got a cruel warden, a piggish governor who dresses like a German World War I officer, a naive new girl who doesn't know the ropes, cat fights (no shower fights, or shower scenes, for that matter, but one of the girl brawls is water-based), and one helluva dyke bar flashback. Employing words that are slightly different than the one's I just used, it's got all the ingredients any reasonable person could possibly need to make one delectable women in prison treat.\n\nuploaded by Surfink1963\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHeavy Metal Parking Lot (1986)\n\nWhile it might look like an insignificant slab of concrete to some, the parking lot in Heavy Metal Parking Lot is no mere slab...of concrete. No fucking way, man. When dotted with a bunch of inebriated devotees of British heavy metal band Judas Priest, the ground percolates with anthropological significance. It's Saturday May 31, 1986, and we're immediately ushered into the parking lot of The Capital Centre in Largo, Maryland, U.S.A. Why we're in this place at this particular time isn't quite clear yet. But over the course of the next fifteen or so minutes, you will wish you had been there when all is said and done. It doesn't matter if you like heavy metal, the honesty depicted in this film will blow your mind. Unfortunately, over the course of the last, oh, let's say, twenty-five years, I've been exposed to a shitload of insincere nonsense. And even though I try my best to avoid being infected by the unending deluge of disingenuous pap that is our current cultural landscape, tiny bits still manage collide with my cerebral cortex. Well, after watching this inexplicable document of a seemingly innocuous event, I think I can safely say that my faith in humanity has been restored. Oozing–yeah, that's right, I said, \"oozing\"–tiny dew-shaped droplets of uncut authenticity from every square inch of their probably clogged pores, the young people who appear in this tribute to life, love and getting wasted are a shining beacon to all those out there wallowing in a pre-dug pit of their own self-pity. Banding together to hear loud guitar-based noise, filmmakers John Heyn and Jeff Krulik manage to capture these strange creatures in their natural habitat. Which, like I said, if you can believe it or not, is the parking lot of The Capital Centre, where a Judas Priest concert, with special guests Dokken, is about to take place.\n\nOh, and my use of the term \"natural habitat\" is in no way meant to be degrading. The kids in this film are not animals, they're human beings. And, I must say, they're some of the most genuine human beings ever to be captured on film.\n\nActually, the reason I used the expression \"natural habitat\" was because of all the zebra-print I saw in this film. The zebra's natural habitat are the temperate grasslands of Africa, and their black and white stripes help them allude predators. In other words, they use their stripes as camouflage. Your average heavy metal fan, on the other hand, uses zebra-print to get noticed. However, instead of trying to avoid being devoured by, let's say, a lion, the headbanger fitted with zebra-print markings wants to be devoured. And since lions aren't indigenous to Maryland parking lots, the only devouring going on here will most likely involve pockmarked penises plowing ever-so-gently into voracious vaginas.\n\nThey came, they saw, they stood around a bit, they got fucked up, they became legends: The Top Ten Heavy Metal Parking Lot Characters.. Whoa, whoa! Hold on there, buddy. Ten?!? I ain't listing ten characters from a seventeen minute movie. Break that shit down a tad and I'll get back to ya.\n\nOkay, how about this. List the top five Heavy Metal Parking Lot characters. In other words, characters who are just plain awesome. And then, when you're done doing that, list the top five metal babes that appear throughout the film. Yeah, I can do that. Woo-hoo! Yeah! Judas Priest!!!!!\n\nThe Top Five Heavy Metal Parking Lot Characters: #1 -- Zebraman. Who else would it be? Take away Zebraman, and your film...Ahh, you know what? I don't even want to think about it. Just the mere thought of Heavy Metal Parking Lot without Zebraman gives me the willies. Who is Zebraman, you ask? Great question. Even though I disagree with almost everything he says during his time onscreen, Zebraman expresses himself in such an eloquent manner, that you too will think that all that punk shit sucks and that Madonna is in fact a dick by the time he's finished his Jack Daniels-assisted diatribe.\n\n#2 -- David Helvey. \"I'm David Helvey. I'm twenty years old. I'm ready to rock.\" And with those words, the blonde man in the aviator shades makes his presence felt almost immediately. Standing by his car with his \"ladyfriend\" Dawn (in a stylish zebra-print top), and two other chicks, David Helvey's love for Judas Priest is unwavering.\n\n#3 -- Graham. You know, like, gram of dope. Shirtless and confused, Graham, while not as succinct as Zebraman, puts forth his ideas in a way that's endearing, yet at the same time profound. Oh, and \"Joints Across America\" is a brilliant idea.\n\n#4 -- Timmy's Friend. Every film, whether it be Xanadu or The Apple, needs a showstopper, and Heavy Metal Parking gets its when one of the directors asks \"Timmy's Friend\" to tell them the long story pertaining to how she and her friends managed to obtain backstage passes. What comes out of her mouth will shock and amaze those who have been wallowing in irony for most of their adult lives. When Timmy's Friend, who would have made the metal babe list had her speech not been so stirring, gets to the heart of Timmy's tale, I nearly dropped my bong (don't worry, it wouldn't have broke, as my wall-to-wall shag carpeting would have surely cushioned its fall).\n\n#5 -- Glen Burnie. At first, I thought her name was \"Glen Burnie,\" but apparently that's the name of the place she's from. Anyway, even though the \"Hell yeah\" chick from Glen Burnie, MD has an inordinate of amount of inappropriate questions thrown in her general direction (\"inappropriate\" because no-one that fucked up should be forced to think on their feet like that), I thought she handled herself with a subtle grace. Woooo! Judas Priest rules!!!!\n\nThe Top Five Metal Babes in Heavy Metal Parking Lot: #1 -- Leg Scab Girl. Without being asked, Leg Scab Girl lifts up her white dress to show the cameraman her sex-related leg scab. \"Sex-related\"?!? Yeah, it would seem that Leg Scab Girl banged her knee while engaging in rough coitus with her headbanger boyfriend in, what I assume was, a large, heavy metal-friendly automobile. And while she's showing us her leg scab, she warns the members of the audience to \"don't ever 'get it' in a car.\"\n\n#2 -- Exceedingly Attractive Dokken Fan. When the camera crew ask a group of intoxicated young people who they're there to see, they all yell \"Judas Priest\" in that overly excited fashion that I have, unfortunately, become accustomed to. However, a voice of reason pops her gorgeous head into the frame, leans toward the microphone, and, in a calm and rational manner, says, \"Dokken,\" the rarely mentioned opening act. A levelheaded contrarian at heart, E.A.D.F, who seems to be channeling tennis star Gabriela Sabatini and Italian pop sensation Sabrina Salerno simultaneously, proves in one fell swoop that not all metal babes are drunken morons.\n\n#3 -- Kelly: The Heavy Metal Virgin. It might be the cheerful blonde's first heavy metal concert, but that doesn't mean you can bump into her while she's trying to relay an important message to the audience. I liked the way she says, \"please,\" when telling an unwashed headbanger to get away from her. Oh, and she's rocking a pair of white suspenders like nobody's business.\n\n#4 -- Trippin' Jack Daniels Girl. Well, first of all, she knows Zebraman. And secondly, well, she's a metal babe goddess. Why is she called \"Trippin' Jack Daniels Girl\"? Well, according to Zebraman, she's doing just that, trippin' on Jack Daniels, and, in his whiskey-soaked mind, \"It all rules... all that shit rules.\"\n\n#5 -- Leggy Hatchback Girl. When it comes to lounging in an excessively leggy manner in the back of hatchbacks, no-one, I repeat, no-one, can top the leggy shenanigans being put out there by the Leggy Hatcback Girl in Heavy Metal Parking Lot. You would be a fool to even try.\n\nAs most people are want to do after they watch Heavy Metal Parking Lot, I started wracking my brain trying to think of all the other parking lot-style movies you could make. Sadly, I kept hitting a brick wall. The reason? Bands like, Zoviet France, Gina X Performance, and even Skinny Puppy don't play shows at venues that have large parking lots. And speaking personally, I don't think I ever attended a show that had parking, let alone an entire parking lot. Nevertheless, I still wouldn't mind seeing something like, A Flock of Seagulls Parking Lot or Missing Persons Parking Lot. You know, just for the clothes and hair alone.\n\nvideo uploaded by HMPL\n\n↧\n\nWomen Behind Bars (Jess Franco, 1975)\n\nThe first, and hopefully the last, women in prison film ever to be narrated by the general manager of an insurance company, Women Behind Bars (a.k.a. Des diamants pour l'enfer) is her to enlighten, horrify, titillate and entertain that thankfully small segment of the population who like to watch movies that feature women who are forcibly confined to a single location for extended period of time. And, of course, as everyone knows, the location best suited to show ladies in this state is a hellish correctional facility on the outskirts of a syphilitic nightmare; one that is preferable run by a corrupt sadist or a lustful lesbian. While I would much rather the warden to be the latter (according to my sources, lustful lesbians are the cat's pajamas), I'd be willing to watch just about anyone degrade female inmates over the course of a sleazy undertaking such as this. Which just goes to show you that maybe I've gotten to a point where I've endured way too many of these flicks; so much so that I can't even seem to muster the energy to protest the fact this film, which is, of course, directed by Jess Franco (Faceless), doesn't even have a lumpy butch lesbian as its villain. But for some strange reason, I can't seem to stop. The allure of the incarcerated female is stronger than ever. You could call it a sickness, but the only problem with that is, I don't feel sick. If you wanna know the real reason why I keep coming back to this morally repugnant genre, all you have to do is look into the eyes of actress Lina Romay, the frequent star of Jess Franco's WIP output, and I'm sure you'll come to the exact same conclusion I did. What do you mean you didn't come that conclusion?!? Stare longer, dammit! Whether you come to it or not, if you peer deep into Lina's dark eyes for hours on end like I have, you will find all sorts of unexpected riches. And this film showcases those riches in a manner that was both profound and exhilarating.\n\nNow, I've seen Lina Romay with long black hair (Lorna The Exorcist), I've seen her with short black hair (Ilsa, The Wicked Warden - \"Lick my culo!\"), and I've even seen her sport a blonde bob (Macumba Sexual), but the black bob hairstyle she dons during the period when she made Women Behind Bars has to be my all-time favourite Lina Romay look. The reason the black bob is my preferred Lina hairdo is that it frames her angelic face perfectly. Whereas the long hairstyle makes her look naive, the short do is a tad too boyish, and the blonde bob is just plain awkward, the black bob gives her a sophisticated aura; which is something she desperately needs if she expects to survive a session of genital electrocution in the prison's notorious punishment cell.\n\nIt's the 15th of May, 1975, and a group of thieves have just made off with a suitcase of uncut diamonds that were locked in a safe on a Chinese junk (owned by Rufus Hackerman, a wealthy businessman) floating in the harbour of an unnamed city in South America (the beautiful city of Nice, France subs for this unnamed city). After the lead thief, Perry Mendoza (Raymond Hardy), dispatches his accomplices (he shoots them on a rocky beach), he meets his girlfriend, Shirley Fields (Lina Romay) in the basement of a closed casino. When Perry discovers the suitcase is empty, Shirley pulls out a gun and kills him. Immediately after she does this Shirley places a phone call to the police, and confesses to Perry's murder.\n\nHowever, the reason she states for killing him has nothing to do with diamonds. No, she tells them it was strictly a crime of passion. Receiving a sentence of six years in prison, Shirley is sent to a prison run by Colonel Carlos (Ronald Weiss), a bearded fella in a black Nero jacket with hardly any charisma; how someone so unappealing ended up becoming the warden of an all ladies correctional facility is beyond my comprehension. Anyway, if you thought Shirley's trip to the big house happened rather quickly, that's because I skipped over the part where Milton Warden (Roger Darton), the general manager of an international insurance company, arrives in town and gets a hotel room. Oh, sure, his scenes are semi-important as far as moving the plot forward went. But in terms of entertainment value goes, he's a bit of a dud when it comes to, well, just about everything.\n\nEven though they both take place in a woman's prison and share some the same cast members, that's where the similarities between Barbed Wire Dolls and Women Behind Bars end. Boasting an unnecessarily complex narrative structure (the former had none whatsoever), the latter overwhelms the viewer with its storytelling devices, that you often get the impression that you're watching a real movie at times; a sensation, I'll admit, that has become somewhat foreign to me.\n\nSpeaking of similarities, you'll notice that Lina Romay is wearing the exact outfit she wore when she arrived at the prison in Barbed Wire Dolls; a pair of tight peach-colured trousers with a matching vest. The only difference here being, she shows a little more cleavage and doesn't enter the prison alone. Well, she doesn't enter the prison right away, she first arrives at Colonel Carlos's lavish villa. Along with an ethnically diverse trio of fellow inmates, a black chick named Laurel (six month sentence), a Latino gal named Rosa (two year sentence), and a Filipino woman in mirror shades named Maria (life in prison). Whoa, life in prison?!? I wonder what she could have done that justify her getting such a stiff sentence; Shirley murdered her boyfriend and she only got six years.\n\nI liked conversation between Colonel Carlos and Shirley Fields that occurs after he dismisses the other girls, as it's obvious that he knows she's up to something. You see, he's not buying this whole \"crime of passion\" nonsense. He thinks Shirley knows the location of the missing diamonds (they were never recovered) and is determined to find out where they are. The same goes for Bill (Jess Franco), a shady associate of Rufus Hackerman working alongside Milton, the insurance guy. At any rate, the exchange - Colonel Carlos: \"I'm afraid you seem a bit racist.\" Shirley: \"Only idiots are racist\" - is, in my mind, legendary.\n\nUnable to win her over with cigarettes, Colonel Carlos sends Shirley to her cell along with the other new fish. And you know what that means? That's right, it's time to see what our shapely inmates will be wearing over the course of this surprisingly tame entreprise. As most of you know, my all-time favourite WiP ensemble were the one's worn by the ladies in Bruno Mattei's Women's Prison Massacre (a drab gray shirt dress paired with charcoal gray hold-up stockings). Okay, so, were the outfits worn by the Women Behind Bars cast able to usurp Ursula Flores and co.? What are you kidding? Nothing will top the drearily dull allure of a bunch of ambiguously European women in charcoal gray hold-up stockings. That being said, the prison uniforms featured in this movie were still pretty impressive. Check this shit out: Each inmate is a given a black shirt dress and a pair of chunky platform heels, and that's it.\n\nOh, and, yeah, you heard right, platform heels. Go back and peruse all the pieces I've written on women in prison movies, and I guarantee the words \"platform heels\" aren't mentioned once. Okay, maybe I can't exactly \"guarantee\" that, but there's a good chance they have never been mentioned.\n\nIt's at this point in the film when Colonel Carlos decides to unleash a WiP classic, and that is, the stoolie. Telling a prisoner named Martine (Martine Stedil), while she lies seductively on his bed (her inexplicable tan lines from a bikini she doesn't have lighting up the room like a Christmas tree), that it would be in her best interest to spy on Shirley. I was mildly amused by how Colonel Carlos attempts to butter his snitch up by informing her that he \"prefers cute little blondes with sexy asses,\" as it came off as desperate and sad.\n\nWhen the Filipino serving a life sentence says, \"stoolies make me want to puke,\" you know Martine is going to have work cut out for her, as the ethnically diverse inmates who were processed with Shirley make it clear that they intend to protect her from the forces that wish to harm her. But if there's anyone who can convince Shirley to spill the proverbial beans, it's Martine and her sexy ass; and, not to mention, a pack of cigarettes. As you would expect, cigarettes are the prison's primary currency, and the best way to make friends.\n\n"
