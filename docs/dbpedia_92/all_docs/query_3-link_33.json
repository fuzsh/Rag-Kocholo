To do so, voters must visit one of the Early Voting sites assigned to the city or township they live in. All sites are open from the second Saturday through the Sunday immediately prior to every major election, including on the weekends. Wondering where and when you can vote early? Look up your voter record and early voting site information at Michigan.gov/Vote WATCH CANDIDATE FORUMS League of Women Voters - Washtenaw County organized and recorded all-candidate forums for the August Primary races, including the Board of Commissioners. my.lwv.org/michigan/washtenaw-county SAFER COMMUNITIES START WITH SUPPORTING PEOPLE, NOT POLICING THEM. Kat Layton’s approach to public safety goes beyond traditional policing models. With 44% of jailed individuals reporting at least one mental health condition, and jails disproportionately affecting people of color, we need systems that don't criminalize people of color, the poor, unhoused, or mentally ill. By investing in community programs that address the root causes of crime, like mental health services, harm reduction, affordable housing, and education, we can create safer and more resilient communities without relying on police. ACTION ITEMS KAT INTENDS TO FULFILL Realign Millage Funding: Determine the true allocation of funds from the Mental Health & Public Safety Millage and redirect spending to support its original purpose, addressing underfunded programs focused on root issues. Work towards prioritizing support services over law enforcement funding. Unarmed & Non-Police Crisis Response: Leverage county funding for an data-driven, unarmed crisis response program without police involvement, while working towards providing pre-arrest diversion and deflection programs. 24/7 Shelter and Resource Center: Establish a year-round warming and cooling center for our unhoused neighbors in collaboration with the county and community organizations, with the long-term goal of developing an emergency overnight shelter.

Groundcover News, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded in April 2010 as a means to empower lowincome persons to make the transitions from homeless to housed, and from jobless to employed. Vendors purchase each copy of our regular editions of Groundcover News at our office for 50 cents. This money goes towards production costs. Vendors work selling the paper on the street for $2, keeping all income and tips from each sale.

That immigrant was me. Since then, I spent many years working and now I don’t owe anything to anyone. Now I feel sick at 65 years, with no family, and the only thing I have is my job selling papers. I have no free time and own nothing; everything is given to me for free by the American government, thanks to the federal laws in this country. Still this is a racist country because of ICE. Now it’s even worse. I lost my Section 8 title because the waitlist closed and now have no more prospects for housing. If I was living in another state, and the police caught me sleeping outside, I would need to pay a $250 fine. Everyday, new, more discriminatory laws are passed. That’s why I don’t like this country anymore. Hace 44 años, en Estados Unidos, un desgraciado de la policía estatal en el estado de Indiana en el condado de Valparaíso usó el control de imigración y un ilegal perdió todos sus derechos al firmar una deportación voluntaria. Ese ilegal era yo. Después, he pasado muchos años trabajando y no tengo que darle cuenta a nadie. Ahora me siento enfermo con 65 años de edad, sin familia, y lo único que tengo es mi trabajo de vendedor de periódicos. No tengo un día libre y sin nada, todo me lo da grátis el gobierno americano. Gracias a las leyes federales de este país. Sin embargo, este es un país racista. Ahora es mucho peor. Ya no tengo mi vale de Sección 8 porque la lista de espera se cerró y así no tengo más vivienda. Si yo viviera en otro estado y la policía me atrapara durmiendo en la calle, tendría que pagar una multa de 250 dólares. A cada día, nueves leyes más discriminatorias son aprobadas. Por eso no me gusta más este país. GROUNDCOVER NEWS 3 I'll miss June and July June and July are two of my favorite months to celebrate holidays. In June, there’s Juneteenth celebrating how God and Jesus helped people be free. People also barbecue and have good food and get togethers for Juneteenth. I also like to celebrate Christmas any month I can, including the summer months. June and July are two good months to barbecue and have celebrations and have fun. I also like to send cards and get and give Christmas presents in June and July too. I like to go to places where my friends are, like Growing Hope and FedUp Ministries in Ypsilanti. I like to hang around downtown Ypsilanti and go to the church where my friends are. I like going to Bethlehem DENISE SHEARER Groundcover vendor No. 485 United Church of Christ where Groundcover is and a lot of my friends are there, too. I like to celebrate the holidays by doing artwork for my friends, too. The Ann Arbor Art Fair is in July So long, Joe! WAYNE S. Groundcover vendor No. 615 In this time of political turmoil, it is refreshing to see that there are still people around who will put their personal wants aside and will do what's best for the people! Yeah, remember us? Now with his example and heartfelt and every July I get happy and excited and try my best to make it there. The Art Fair has any type of artwork you want to see. I like the nonprofit booths where you can get things for free. I like to get food from the Art Fair and just walk around and look at the beautiful scenery and maybe see some of my friends, or maybe make some new friends if I can. One of my favorite things to do is get something cold to drink because most of the time it be so hot. The Art Fair is very fun and beautiful and relaxing. There’s a lot of interesting people and artwork. Those are the ways I like to celebrate June and July. decision we have a true patriot who showed us he didn't just talk the talk, but walked the walk. Now it is time for us to come together. We have a moment in time where we can change the narrative, where we can run political campaigns on our accomplishments, not on our opponents' failures. It's time for us to take a quick breath and take a good look at both candidates, not have them just attack one another. A time to find who has the integrity to have the light shine on them and not come up wanting. So we are saying goodbye to a person who has spent most of his adult life serving the people: Joe Biden. It would be so easy to take pot shots at both parties. I’ll follow the President of the United States — Joe Biden's — lead and see if this novel idea of doing what's best for the people resonates and catches on!\n\n4 GROUNDCOVER NEWS VOTING I remember the first time I voted and became a part of the democratic process … but why? Black Men here in the United States of America, a lot of us feel our vote doesn't matter or won’t have no-real effect on our situation here in America; in short, we are totally detached and have no faith in the democratic process. But it is projected that there will be 34.4 million eligible Black voters by election time in November 2024. Black voter turnout rates are projected to be higher than Hispanics and Asians. The first time I voted was when Barack Obama first won the presidency in 2008. The reason I voted for him was simply because of his skin color. Not because he was a Democrat or his ideas and values were in line with my own; I never thought about what type of policies he might administer. How naive I was then. Now, seventeen years later, I am much wiser. Still, I have to mention his skin color caught my attention and put me in the game of the democratic process. During Barack Obama’s presidency I started becoming detached and decided not to participate in the 2012 election.Then Trump came along in 2016 and swept the nation by storm, with it at times. This upcoming election I will be casting my vote and hope others will do the same. I met a brother in the downtown Ann Arbor area named Todd Wilson, the Michigan lead organizer and consultant of Black Men Vote. As we talked, he let me know that MIKE JONES Groundcover vendor No. 113 catching everybody's attention. He turned ordinary news stations into political entertainment narcotics; people became hooked on Trump news. Now, I must mention that Trump news got me back into the game of the process of democracy again. Both Obama and Trump caught the attention of the masses, including those people who would have never paid attention to politics. Sometimes it takes extreme figures and/or situations to get people's attention and to get them involved. Ever since 2016, I have been back in the game, being a part of the democratic process, even though I struggle Frank White, known as former President Barack Obama’s top fundraiser, started BMV in January 2024. BMV is currently partnered with “Shop Talk,” the flagship of the campaign currently operating in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. The goal is to get 55-60 barbershops, beauty salons and barber schools involved with helping to get Black Men registered and participating in the democratic process.” As he continued, he informed why he decided to get involved and engage in Black Men voter mobilization and voter registration. “Because I noticed a voter deficit, if we look at the polls, our voter turnout rate was the lowest nationally; only 12 percent of Black registered voters came out to vote in the last Michigan Primary election. Shop Talk is geared towards changing that trajectory, by mobilizing Black Men to get them engaged or reengaged into the JULY 26, 2024 Black Men Vote mobilizes voters in barber shops democratic process. As men, we are looked-up to in the household and in our communities. People watch us; therefore, we can lead by example, and we can change the trajectory, when it comes to our vote as a whole, in our community. Black Men being involved allows for Black Men to be more informed on issues, and allows us as Black Men to have a voice in the political arena on issues that matter to us.” Then I asked him about the types of responses that have been received since the start of BMV. He said, “Voter mobilization; people are really getting behind it and getting involved. We also look to partner with various organizations and with state and local governments soon; things have been going well.” I had one last question for Todd: How can people register to vote and get involved with BMV? He said, “If you want to get more information on Black Men Vote, you can go to our website blackmenvote.org and you can register to vote on our website and also get valuable information needed for the upcoming election.” So, there you have it folks, exercise your right and vote! Three City of Ypsilanti ballot initiatives to look for during November election LINDSAY CALKA Publisher Ypsilanti Ballot Initiative Group (Ypsi BIG) is a newly formed group of organizers in Ypsilanti that has nearly collected 900 signatures on three separate ballot petitions aimed at amending the Ypsilanti City Charter. The group includes members from Ypsilanti Tenants Union, What’s Left Ypsi, Eastern Michigan University, and former members of Defend Affordable Ypsi. Ypsi BIG began planning for the petitioning process early in 2024, drawing inspiration from an unsuccessful effort by Defend Affordable Ypsi in 2020, which attempted to instate rent control through a ballot petition process. Ypsi BIG surveyed a number of local grassroots organizations, considering over 10 possible charter amendments before deciding on three. A ballot initiative is a proposed law — in this case, a change to the City Charter — initiated by the electorate instead of by those in elected office. In order to get the proposed legislation on the ballot, a certain number of signatures must be collected and approved by a deadline. In addition to the standard tactic of door knocking and street canvassing at public events such as Ypsi Pride, First Fridays and Juneteenth, Ypsi BIG marketed the ballot initiatives on social media and directed interested signers to show up at a central location — Vertex Cafe, Sundays 1-4 p.m. — throughout June and July. Due to their efforts, close to 900 Ypsilanti residents have signed in favor of these changes and if the remainder of the signatures are collected and approved by the City Clerk by July 30, the measures will be up for general vote in the November 5 election. Read up on what each of the initiatives aim to do so you can make an informed decision on election day. 1. Public Control of Police Budget: Requires that any changes to the Ypsilanti Police Department budget be voted on as a stand-alone issue by the general public during a regular November election. 2. Non-partisan Local Elections: Would eliminate partisan voting for Mayor and City Council positions, Show up to Vertex Cafe Sunday, July 28 1-4 p.m. to sign and support the initiatives! which would mean that straight-ticket voting would not apply to those seats. This would also eliminate City Council and mayoral primary elections, which would effectively create more competitive races in November. 3. Tenant Rights: Would result in three big changes: 1) A ban on rental application fees, 2) A requirement for landlords to follow a Right of First Refusal law, and 3) A requirement for landlords to register all of their properties with the City on an accessible online database. There would be substantial financial penalties for landlords should they not follow this, and holding them accountable will be the job of City Council. Right of First Refusal mandates that landlords, if selling their rental properties, first offer to sell the property at market rate to the tenant(s) who live there. If you are interested in supporting the campaign for these initiatives, contact Ypsi BIG by visiting their website www.linktr.ee/ypsibig or messaging on Instagram @ypsi.big JULY 26, 2024 MAKING CHANGE Where is the revolution? KEN PARKS Groundcover vendor No. 490 It is often said, “You can kill the revolutionary but you can’t kill the revolution.” On the 4th of July, independence is tainted with a military flavor that usually promotes the military-industrial-financial complex that Eisenhower warned us about. Freedom of expression is limited by the idolatry of flag worship. Fireworks are a magical display that distract from the bombs that are regularly falling on someone in the world. The aspiration for freedom is born with the first breath of every baby. The potential for love and creativity which we recognize in a newborn is the human heritage we all embody. The real question may be, “Where is your inner child?” NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) did a study on genius, creativity and imagination and discovered that nearly all fiveyear-olds scored high. The rate declined with age and was down to 2% for adults. Google can teach us a lot but it is up to us to work with what we have. This means recognizing the plight of our inner child and doing the healing so that inner child and adult learn to communicate. I proposed a workshop at Crazy Wisdom with Joya D’Cruz on this theme and hope to have an announcement soon. Joya was mentored by Eugene Gendlin who wrote “Focusing,” an important book on mental health. Facing reality is a revolutionary act and can inspire you to become an active participant in your life. The dialectic of theory and practice is a lively one as the rhythm of joy appears. Today, July 1, is the anniversary of the jazz standard “Take Five,” the 5/4 rhythm that brightens our life. Search that when you are ready for a treat! Maybe we will play it on October 8 as the theme of my 82nd birthday. I was born just before the baby boomers who once said “Don’t trust anyone over 30.” There is some form of youth rebellion with every generation and the Gray Panthers slogan “Youth and Age Together” is one to remember. We can empower each other to follow through until the job is done. We will know when peace and justice replace compliance with the chain of command. Martha Reeves and the Vandellas sang about it, “Dancing In The Street.” Another treat at your fingertips. We have a long history of victories that seem to crumble just as we want to rest on our laurels. After the war in Vietnam, the ruling class broke the so-called Vietnam Syndrome with Ken Parks at the Ann Arbor Coalition Against the War Art Fair Booth. war in Granada and then Panama. The School of the Americas became known as the School of the Assassins and renamed itself to continue the wars of counterinsurgency. Read soaw.org for updates as the popular struggles continue in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in particular. The most recent victory in the global struggle for freedom is the release of Julian Assange. The popular movement in Australia gained enough momentum that politicians took notice and acted to release him after five years of prison which came on the heels of his controversial arrest at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he was in asylum for seven years. The bravery and persistence of Assange and his family and the struggle for freedom of the press is now legendary. Let’s follow through and support the whistleblowers in our midst. Water protectors — from Standing Rock in North Dakota to the Carrizo Comecrudo tribe of Texas, the original people of the Rio Grande — are active in exposing the extractive war on the environment. As Juan B. Mancias says, “Water is meant to unite, not divide.” I ordered a t-shirt with a striking photo of him and that quote. You can get one at the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas website. I am guilty of being active in both religion and politics, the two taboos of bourgeois culture. This French origin word refers to the capitalist class and sometimes middle class as people adjust to the geopolitical order of our time in history. The French and American Revolutions consolidated the end of feudalism and the deepening of the capitalist revolution which is ripening for the next step towards freedom. This is the responsibility we share as we learn that reality is a seamless whole, that awareness is the next step in our evolution to genuine revolution. James Boggs and Grace Lee Boggs are legendary in Detroit and beyond for their life of theory and practice that you can visit in the book “Evolution and Revolution in the 20th Century.” When your life’s purpose becomes a shared purpose with others, the power that arises is formidable. If your intention is to benefit all beings without exception, countless world systems will arise. When inner space and outer space come together, infinity takes a dive into the Clear Light of the Void. This is the moment when masters of mindful awareness will be welcomed into your inner circle of significant beings. Suffering becomes a force to seek the cure. When we discover that reality is a workable situation, the revolution of unconditional love will erase all the conceptual prisons that have enslaved us from beginningless time. Unimpeded awareness becomes a victory celebration. Imagine that! I must mention that July 26 is celebrated in Cuba as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. Although the attack on the Moncada barracks was a failure, it marked the beginning of open resistance to the Batista dictatorship. I regularly ask my Cuban family “Where is the revolution?” and the response is always “Where is it?” We have unfinished revolutions in many places. Awareness with dignity and confidence will help us weave many local fabrics into a beautiful global quilt. “The Invention of Wings” is a wonderful book on quilts and freedom. The historic friendship of a slavemaster’s daughter and a slave girl is the inspiration for this book by Sue Monk Kidd, who many know from “The Secret Life of Bees.” This world is an amazing place when your curiosity comes out of the closet. The revolution begins here. Since no one can do everything, it is good to tune in to whatever speaks to you and know that anything you do is interrelated and that everyday life is the main stage. Daily mindful awareness practice is my recommendation on where to start. Your inner child is ready to play the game of life. Just as the sun rises everyday, raise yourself to a daily practice of engaged living. The revolution lives in your heart. GROUNDCOVER NEWS 5\n\n6 GROUNDCOVER NEWS AUGUST PRIMARY Who will be the new sheriff in town? JIM CLARK Groundcover vendor No. 139 County Sheriff’s Departments are charged with the same things police officers are — investigating crimes and arresting criminals. Little regard is given by law enforcement for the circumstances under which crimes are committed or the state-of-life the “criminals” are in. Law is blind. So it doesn’t care if your parents abused you and now you perpetuate crimes of abuse. It doesn’t care if you fell to peer pressure and now are addicted to something. Law doesn’t care if you have mental illness or are simply a person built to live outside of norms. The point of the law does not seem to be to protect and serve as much as it is to arrest and punish. Washtenaw County is about to elect a new sheriff. This means almost nothing to abolitionists and anti-capitalists; however, it is worth paying attention to who will be holding this position of power. As a young activist, I was told that I could work within the system to change it from the inside. I have tried this and have seen others try it. It rarely works. Real change is not going to come from within this system; it will only come from complete deconstruction of the system. However, there is some sentiment within the ranks of law enforcement towards abolition. I interviewed each candidate to learn where they stand on abolition, reallocating public funds to mental health care, and on community-led actions to solve homelessness. Here are the takes from the candidates: What Interested You in Police Work? Alyshia Dyer: “I grew up extremely low-income in Ypsilanti, raised by a single parent, and had a lot of childhood trauma. I ran away from home a lot and at one point was falsely arrested and treated badly by the police. These experiences motivated me to get into law enforcement to be a more compassionate officer who really cared about people in our community. I also wanted to change things in law enforcement that I knew were harming people I cared about.” After completing her bachelor’s degree at Eastern Michigan University, Dyer earned advanced degrees from Gerald R. Ford School of Policy and the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan. She served as a road patrol deputy and a marine deputy at the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s office for nearly a decade. Derrick Jackson: “Originally I was JULY 26, 2024 Alyshia Dyer: Ypsilanti native who wants to end over-policing. just interested in systems work, like doing things in my neighborhood that could make the lives of people who were living in the community better. I left direct service social work because every day I would help a young person but there was always another family coming back who needed more help.” Jackson took on a job at the County Clerk's office where he met Jerry Clayton, Washtenaw County Sheriff. As Jackson tells the story, “I went into work at the Clerk's office where I met this guy [Jerry Clayton] who had this crazy idea about doing social work through a police agency. Honestly that's what pulled me into it. I didn't grow up wanting to be a police officer. It was literally this idea of doing social work and police work together.” Ken Magee: “I was a young and rambunctious person who had a good family but was running the neighborhood being mischievous, always pushing the envelope. I was never a bully. Instead, I stuck up for the kids who were getting bullied. In high school, my mentors encouraged me to channel my rambunctiousness into police work.” Two of Magee's mentors were Keith Hafner and Ed Sells, owners of Keith Hafner’s Karate in downtown Ann Arbor. There he met FBI agents. “This led to exploring a career in police work,” Ken recalled. “Numerous cops have the same story as me.” Magee graduated first in his police academy and was class president. Being very competitive, his chief challenger is always himself. He excels in all he does — martial arts, police work and writing. Magee has written four books about University of Michigan football. His law enforcement tenure includes involvement with the Drug Enforcement Administration and, as Magee puts it, “facing down some of the most dangerous criminals on the planet.” Derrick Jackson: Bringing social work to police work by restoring communities. On Abolition Dyer: “I’m never going to call myself an abolitionist because it’s hypocritical to do that and run for a position like sheriff. I will say I have read about this extensively, and what it means to me is recognizing that many of our systems were originally designed around harmful practices. Sheriffs, for example, historically were born out of slave patrols in the South and helped promote mass incarceration. Present-day, we try to push back on these roots, but there are still realities in the design of law enforcement that cause harm, even when the people working inside the system don’t intentionally mean to cause harm. I believe in reducing harm in this space as sheriff so that we are working towards new strategies to create safer communities. We also have to be more honest from a police administration standpoint about how over-policing has contributed to violence. I know so many young people who got zero support until they got into trouble. Then the support was very punitive. It didn’t help. “Abolitionists I know and have talked to, at the end of the day, believe in a Ken Magee: Former DEA agent who \"thinks outside the badge.\" better world where everyday people aren’t being extorted, oppressed and harmed by systems that are supposed to protect us. Some of the principles, including investing more upstream and investing more in solutions for safety, hit home for me as someone who grew up in an area where opportunity is defined by zip code. My goal as sheriff is to make sure we are responding adequately to calls for service but also doing so in the least harmful way possible and ensuring we are doing our part to invest in root-cause solutions to better public safety. We need more deflection and diversion, and we need more restorative justice to offer healing for when victims of crime want to go a different route.” Jackson: “I think …” He paused and then started again. “Listen, we're all trying to work towards abolition. How do we actually get there? It would be great if we didn't have deaths or homicides or serious assaults, right? There's a lot of social ills out there. And I think as a social worker, I have these ideals of what we would be like as a society if kids weren't picking up guns and see SHERIFF next page  JULY 26, 2024 ARTS CONTEST GROUNDCOVER NEWS 7 Vote for your favorite mixed media piece and view submissions to the other three categories online at linktr.ee/groundcovernews Voting closes August 5!

I work so that those mothers don't have to wake up and hear me telling them that their son had been murdered. So I would love to see that stuff [abolition] in the future. I think it's just about how we get there.” Magee: “The prison system is not the responsibility of the sheriff, as the sheriff is in charge of the jail. I believe a jail and a prison both have their own respective purpose. However, any incarceration system can be improved to facilitate the ultimate goal of rehabilitation. Example, literacy, teaching the trades, advancing education, all part of the rehabilitation process. The abolition of the incarceration system is not something I believe in, but continually assessing the desired outcomes and what research and analysis presents.” On Alternatives to Policing Dyer: “Beyond policing, we need to address the root causes of crime and focus on creating safe, supportive and stable communities. We also have to admit the effect over-policing has had on our community, disproportionately affecting Black residents in Washtenaw County. We must tackle the high racial disparities in our legal system, particularly involving youth. Investments at the neighborhood level, providing better support for young people, and addressing social determinants of health are crucial for building safe communities in addition to minimizing the harm caused by our local legal system. Criminalizing low-level offenses by using heavy-handed traffic enforcement tactics only exacerbates problems, especially for young people, and we must adopt more supportive and restorative approaches. “We will do our job as law enforcement to tackle more serious crimes but what we won’t do is criminalize whole neighborhoods by stopping people for petty reasons that aren’t related to safety concerns. We also need to make more evidence-based investments at the neighborhood level to increase safety, especially to reduce traffic fatalities. This is why I also heavily support traffic calming infrastructure.” (Author's note: I’m including the second paragraph because while I believe in a non-police society, there will still be a need for people to pay attention to safety issues. Like kittens, humans are frequently guilty of petty stupidity. As a result, we will need fire departments when a candle gets knocked over by a cat, or air lifts for the hiker who slipped and fell down a hole. We don’t need police, but we all need a little help from time to time.) Jackson: “I think we're trying to eliminate social ills in unhealthy communities, in general. I think that's what social work is about, right? It's about helping people not just deal with the crisis, but help them move from crisis to self-sustainability, to live healthy and thriving lives. Any neighborhood that is safe, is also well. And so police and social work go together because you can't have safe communities unless you have well communities. So that's literally how I think these two things really go together. “But I also think, if we were serious, even abolitionists, if we were really serious, we would be investing in communities that have been disinvested in for generations. Where I grew up, where I raised my family, those communities intentionally have been disinvested from. So if we're serious about it, it isn't only about these policy tweaks to policing. We've got to invest in our communities in very different ways.” Magee: “Great question! Outside of policing [there are] literacy projects.” Magee explains there is a connection between criminal behavior and literacy. “Opportunities can be provided for people who are returning citizens, such as housing, and employment, but these are outside of [the sheriff’s] function. “What would it take to abolish the police and have a society that polices itself should have happened two centuries ago. I don't see it. I believe that there will always be predators. Individuals violate the law for their own benefit.” Magee's approach to improving policing is by “thinking outside the badge,” not the box. Magee says this means “maintaining your true values to law enforcement. To protect and serve. It’s not just about reducing crime, it’s about the police force voicing our concerns about what we feel would make us safe and protected.” On Community-led Emergency Shelter Dyer: “I am committed to being a strong advocate for self-led community emergency shelters. As sheriff, I will work to ensure these shelters are safe and that we prevent over-policing in these spaces. My experience as a deputy has shown me the harsh reality of people turning themselves in on old warrants during winter months just to stay warm. We must do better by supporting investments in shelter and providing the necessary resources to keep people safe and housed. We also need to do better in our jail so when see SHERIFF page 11 \n\n10 GROUNDCOVER NEWS POETRY “Kidnapped from her West African home in 1762 and sold into slavery, Phillis Wheatley grew up to become the first popular African American poet. She was also the first African American and the first slave to publish a book of poems.” — Britannica Kids website The story of Phillis Wheatley is one which appeals to both the younger and the older generation. She was a trailblazer. When we talk about early Black literary achievements, her contributions and her excellence loom large. This is our fourth and last article about early Black writers and poets of America. The author plans to encourage more discussion and dialogues on this topic at some bookstores and coffee houses in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. Stay tuned for some announcements and community invitations. Biography of Phillis Wheatley Historians do not have the exact birthday for Phillis Wheatley. Many have suggested that she was seven or eight when she was abducted and sold into slavery in 1761. She was a young girl when the slave ship brought her to the shores of Boston. A wealthy tailor, John Wheatley, purchased the little girl to be a servant to his wife, Suzanna. Soon, Suzanna and John noticed Phillis had reading and writing abilities. Suzanna and her young daughter, Mary, started to teach young Phillis English, grammar, religion, Greek, Latin and English literature. Within two years, Phillis could read and write clearly in English. She also demonstrated proficiency in Latin. She mastered the styles and techniques of popular poets by the time she turned 14. A Britannica Kids online article said that as a teenager of 14, Phillis had a poem published in the Newport Mercury Newspaper of Rhode Island. Later, other poems by Phillis appeared in Boston publications. Phillis’s poems were influenced by the words of poets John Milton, Thomas Gray and Alexander Pope. Britannica Kids observes that in 1770, her “An Elegiac Poem, on the Death of the Celebrated Divine … George Whitefield’ was published first in a locally-produced pamphlet and then in newspapers throughout British America and England.” Britannica kids continued, “...the poem’s wide distribution brought her recognition as the ‘extraordinary poetical genius of New England.’ Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon and a WILL SHAKESPEARE Groundcover vendor No. 258 friend of Whitefield, invited the young poet to England and sought a publisher for her works.” According to Poets.org, Phillis traveled to London, England, in 1771, accompanied by Nathaniel Wheatley, son of John and Suzanna Wheatley. She had put together a collection of her poems into a book, “Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral.” In London, she was well-received. The book of 39 poems was published in London and she dedicated it to Countess Selina Hastings. While in London, she met with some dignitaries, including William Legge, second earl of Dartmouth, the abolitionist Granville Sharpe and Benjamin Franklin. She was unable to meet the countess who invited her to England, because when Suzanna became ill in 1773, Phillis hurried back to Boston to help her recover. Poets.org noted: “In 1776, Wheatley wrote a letter and a poem in support of George Washington, who replied with an invitation to visit him ...” Phillis was freed from slavery before Suzanna’s death in 1774. After John Wheatley died, Phillis tried to support herself as a seamstress and a poet. Phillis married a free Black man known as John Peters in 1778. He was a grocer and a lawyer. The couple had three children. Mr. Peters abandoned Phillis and her children. To provide for her kids, Phillis became a maid in a boardinghouse. Two of her children died while she experienced poverty. Britannica kids noted, “On December 5, 1784, Wheatley and her third child died within hours of each other. They were buried together in an unmarked grave.” A very sad tragedy! Historians tell us that Phillis continued to write poems until her last day on earth. However, she was unable to find publishers for her books of poems. About 50 years after her death, in 1834, “Memoirs of Phillis Wheatley” was published. Another book, titled “Letters of Phillis Wheatley, the Negro-slave of Boston,” was published in 1864. Britannica Kids noted that abolitionists refer to Phillis Wheatley’s On Being Brought from Africa to America 'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land, Taught my benighted soul to understand That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too: Once I redemption neither sought nor knew. Some view our sable race with scornful eye, \"Their colour is a diabolic die.\" Remember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain, May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train. writing as a refutation of society’s claim in the 18th and 19th centuries that “African Americans were intellectually inferior to Whites.” Many legacies Wheatley left an impressive legacy of brave and thoughtful African American women writers. It took several decades in the 1800s before Frances Ellen Watkins Harper became the first African American woman to publish a short story. Harper was both an abolitionist and a suffragette. Other Black women writers and women rights activists displayed their talents in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. Women writers who were inspired by Wheatley’s sense of empowerment and excellence include Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Zora Neale-Hurston, Shirley Graham DuBois, Lorraine Hansberry, Toni Morrison, Audrey Lorde, Angela Davis, Maya Angelou, Amanda Garman, Nikole Hannah Jones and Isabel Wilkerson, to mention a few. Harvard scholar and historian Henry Louis Gates paid tribute to Phillis Wheatley in his recent books, “The Black Box” and “The Trial of Phillis Wheatley.” In the latter book, Dr. Gates said, “In 1773, the slave Phillis Wheatley literally wrote her way to freedom. The first person of African descent to publish a book of poems in English, she was emancipated by her owners in recognition of her literary achievement. For a time, Wheatley was the most famous Black person in the West. But Thomas Jefferson, unlike his contemporaries Ben Franklin and George Washignton, refused to acknowledge her gift as a writer — a repudiation that eventually inspired generations of Black writers to build an extraordinary body of literature in their efforts to prove him wrong.” JULY 26, 2024 Phillis Wheately: a pioneer of Black literary excellence PUZZLE SOLUTIONS JULY 26, 2024 POETRY Of poets poor, of poets richer PHILIP SPINK Groundcover vendor No. 630 I like the poetry of the poor, Often the most.

This will reduce recidivism. “In addition to all this, as sheriff, I will work with local and statewide partners to support enacting rent control to keep rent affordable, and will support more housing investments especially for people leaving our jail. My whole platform can be found at Dyer2024.com.” Jackson: (was unavailable to answer) Magee: “Being homeless is not a crime. Law enforcement is asked to respond to the issues the unhoused are victimized by — such as getting mugged or committing crime / being victim of a crime due to mental health concerns. I cannot stress the importance of this enough. But the Sheriff's Office wouldn’t [oversee it], but if [a community-led shelter] would reduce police calls, victimization and actual crime, then I agree to that.” On Defunding Law Enforcement Dyer: “Yes, I believe that diverting some funding from policing to community mental health care is essential. The Sheriff's Office currently receives $6-7 million annually from the Community Mental Health and Public Safety Millage, in addition to their already large budget. They used some of this money to buy rifles and upgrade their infrastructure. My goal is to use flexible funding to prioritize investments in mental health services, substance use treatment, housing and preventive measures. As a therapist, licensed social worker, and former police officer, I understand the importance of increasing access to mental health treatment. Police officers are not equipped to handle mental health crises, and expanding community mental health support and alternative responder programs will better serve our community's needs. This also allows law enforcement to focus on emergency 911 calls for service that need immediate attention for safety reasons. It shouldn’t be the case that in Wash-tenaw County people can’t get preventative mental health support. These gaps have real consequences on families and our whole community.” Jackson: (was not available to reply) Ken: [Long pause] \"I do not believe we should divert [police] funding to community mental health, but should provide training to officers to respond to mental health emergencies.” Magee believes that after taking away crime (that is caused by mental illness and acts of survival) there are still predators. “I believe we need a strong police presence to prevent crime,” Magee said. Magee is an advocate of restorative justice — with principles and limitations. He believes restorative justice should not apply to sex crimes and domestic violence.\n\n2 GROUNDCOVER NEWS OPINION JULY 12, 2024 Hear Me Out: the SCOTUS Grants Pass v. Johnson decision is a declaration of war People experiencing homelessness survive by sleeping in tents and alleys and bushes. Sleep and safe shelter are second to food and water, which means homeless people are literally barely hanging on to their lives. And now the United States Supreme Court has said it is okay to further punish people for trying to survive homelessness. In the case City of Grants Pass, Ore. v. Johnson, the Supreme Court was asked to determine if punishing homeless people for trespassing is cruel and unusual, per the U.S. Constitution. This June, they decided it is not: the Constitution does not protect the homeless from arrest or financial penalties — even though our economic JIM CLARK Groundcover vendor No. 139 and penal system put them there. Our lives as Americans are 100% built around and governed by our economic system. For those close to the bottom, the grind is getting some kind of job then entering an endless cycle of going to work and paying bills. The bills include some of the very things that support life — food and shelter specifically. Without these things, survival is impossible. The life-support things are commodified, so the only access you have to them is with money. Meaning if you don’t work in the system, you don’t get to live in the system. America is a pay-to-play country, and by play we mean survive. In America, you must be part of the economic system or you will die a slow death. Americans die every day from malnutrition, exposure to the elements, critical mental illnesses and from the violence of surviving on the street. And now, additionally, being homeless is a criminal act in America. The prevailing attitude towards people experiencing homelessness in our country is that it was their fault, due to some moral failing like “laziness,” and they could get out of their situation if they wanted to do so. The fact of the matter is, every homeless person I’ve met wants to get out of poverty. What people don’t realize is how hard that is in a capitalist system. In our system, one has to compete to survive. But the playing field is not even. To begin, most people need a cell phone and a car to get a job. Both cost money. You also need to be able to interview and prove you can make it to work. You also need to be clean see GRANTS PASS page 4  PROVIDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELFDETERMINED INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY POVERTY, PRODUCING A STREET NEWSPAPER THAT GIVES A PLATFORM TO UNDERREPRESENTED VOICES IN WASHTENAW COUNTY, PROMOTING AN ACTION TO BUILD A JUST, CARING AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY.

While joining in the festivities, this reporter had the chance to talk with Funeral Director Kelsey Tingley.

Corey was in charge and I found him to be a young man who was very excited about the festivities. He was going from place to place making sure things were running smoothly. He said he was glad to be working for an organization that was just as excited about this event as he was. Last but not least was the entertainment put together by an up-and-comer on the Ann Arbor entertainment scene, DJ Freeze, who entertained the crowd with his masterful performance at the turntable and mixer.

She had been paying her fees in full and on time. She never violated any guest rules or did anything else to break her contract with Extended Stay. It was after requesting her tax exemption — which she is legally owed and had received in the past — that the hotel decided to terminate Lit’s contract and ability to continue reservations. Without telling Lit why she was being kicked out and refusing to communicate further with her, the hotel management then called the police to physically remove her. The police instead suggested a seven-day eviction notice that the hotel staff posted on her door. The hotel’s site manager disabled Lit’s keys. She decided to stay in the room and mobilize community support via her social media followers and Washtenaw Camp Outreach (WCO) to put pressure on the hotel. Lit had three demands: that the management come to the table and give her answers, pay her legally owed tax rebate, and allow her to continue reservations at the same rate she had paid previously. Most importantly, she said, “I stayed to begin the discussion about human rights for everyone, not just me.” Over five days, community members put on a mass pressure campaign, making nearly 100 complaints through the hotel’s website and phone line. Finally WCO — in talks with Lit — hand-delivered a letter to the hotel on Friday June 7. In the letter WCO stated Lit’s demands and made an ultimatum: if the hotel management did not contact Lit to communicate in good faith by the following Monday morning, WCO and solidarity organizations would be hosting a press conference outside the hotel about the situation on that same afternoon. This final push to pressure the hotel was successful — initially. The next day, Saturday June 8, the hotel’s general manager Amber King called Lit; she agreed to all three of Lit’s demands and lifted the eviction. With the help of generous community contributions Lit was also able to pay for the days she hadn’t been able to leave the hotel to make money. This concession turned out to be short lived. In the next booking period, despite Amber King’s promise, the hotel charged Lit for the taxes — over $50 more than it would have been with the exemption. Lit refuses to pay her reservation fee until the hotel honors the tax rebate. On June 17 the front desk handed her another seven-day eviction notice. This time they did not disable her keys, so Lit is still able to leave her room. She has since not been able to contact Amber King, and King has not reached out to Lit. The only point of contact has been at the front desk, who is directly going against the word of the general manager. Lit is trying to take her case to the courts on a formal eviction basis. Michigan law does not make it clear when an extended stay hotel guest becomes a tenant, so a legal eviction case would likely be complicated and not necessarily fruitful. Lit Kurtz is facing eviction from Extended Stay. The law and its cruelty allows private establishments like Extended Stay and other hotels to bend contracts and kick people out without reason. However, both Lit and WCO recognize that this is a violation of human rights, starting with the seven-day notice. Seven days is not nearly enough time for anyone to find and make arrangements to move to another safe location after having established long-term residency. Some reviews on Extended Stay’s Facebook page reveal that this is not the first eviction to take place on their property. It will likely not be the last. The short pressure campaign with WCO led to a temporary but material win for Lit. But if this case is resolved, the real victory, in her own words, would be “for my human right to stay housed.” She says the fight is just getting started.  GRANTS PASS from page 2 and presentable when you go to work. Some people can pull themselves up, but it still doesn’t happen overnight and it doesn’t happen without a safe, reliable place to sleep. There is a stark parallel between being homeless and being displaced by war. In war, people are forced to leave their homes by a military system either because soldiers force them at gunpoint, or because their homes were destroyed by weapons of war. In America, people are forced to leave their homes by a capitalist system either by cops forcing them to leave at gunpoint, or just having their tents and belongings destroyed by a bulldozer. In war, people who are displaced are seen as an enemy, in America, the homeless are considered a nuisance, a word not as strong as “enemy” but equally dehumanizing. In war, refugees end up sleeping in tents; in America the homeless do as well, but now that can be disrupted at gunpoint. If you think “gunpoint” is too strong I must remind you, cops carry guns, are not afraid to use them, and have a license to kill. In other words, they are soldiers charged with “protecting and serving” capitalist interests. America has demonstrated a certain hatred towards the homeless. It is seen in other nations that practice genocide. One earmark of genocide is forcing people out of their homes and into the streets where their chances of dying increase. This is the exact same thing the U.S. Supreme Court just did! The reality is that punishing humans for trying to survive is a hate crime. Pay attention to anyone who supports such treatment. The hate is visceral. You can hear it, you can taste it. People who have never wanted for anything stand in judgment of the homeless, find them unworthy and deserving of being exterminated. This is what they mean when they say “the solution to homelessness is a bus ticket out of town.” Or jail. Or death. They don’t care, just get them out of their backyard. What this decision allows for is sinister. Any town, county, state or federal entity can declare homelessness a form of vagrancy and disorderly conduct. This means a person can be picked up for sitting on a bench too long. If you think that doesn’t happen, you’re deluded. It happens every day and now there is no defense you can make against it. If you happen to have a warrant, you can end up in prison, and guess what? Many states still allow chattel slavery. People are owned by the penal system and forced labor is not considered cruel and unusual. But it doesn’t stop with the homeless. The sayings “one paycheck away from losing housing” or “one car breakdown away from losing a job” describe real situations. The working poor (including myself when I had a job but nowhere to live) have never been so at risk from becoming refugees of war. If you lost that job because the car broke down and now you don’t have that check to pay rent, your chances of becoming homeless are near 100%. You may end up sleeping on the street; literally, this is how it happens. Then people can be fined for trespassing and punished by incarceration. This is business as usual in America. The Supreme Court of the United States has created an atmosphere so similar to genocidal nations that their decision could be taken as a declaration of war against the homeless. The poor must take it that way. Americans have kicked the last refuge out from under our feet. We must unite against this passive-aggressive attack. Wake up. The rich have always despised the poor, have always seen us as disposable cattle, and have always resented having to pay us to produce the wealth they enjoy. Technology replaces wage slaves everyday. Now they want to incarcerate us. And guess what? Prisons are so poorly managed that you may contract a disease or simply be killed by a fellow inmate. Homelessness can be a death sentence if it leads to prison. Since it is now illegal to be homeless anywhere, catching charges for trespassing on federal land can result in a felony punishable by prison according to our Constitution. The song “Talkin’ ‘bout a Revolution” by Tracy Chapman has a line that goes “poor people gonna rise up and get their share. Poor people gonna rise up and take what’s theirs.” It is time. JULY 12, 2024 SPORTS SAWC invites Darren McCarty to speak at annual fundraiser Darren McCarty, a former professional hockey player for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League, was the keynote speaker at \"Almost Home,\" June 24 at Barton Hills Country Club in Ann Arbor. \"Almost Home\" is a Shelter Association of Washtenaw County fundraiser to support the homeless community. Cazzie Avery, a former shelter client now housed, also was a guest speaker as advertised on the SAWC website. A Groundcover News press credential request was turned down. McCarty did not respond to email. McCarty is best known for fighting Colorado Avalanche right wing Claude Lemieux, March 26, 1997, in retaliation for Lemieux's hit from behind on Kris Draper in the 1996 playoffs. In the real world, both Lemieux and McCarty would have been charged with assault. The illegal hit, which broke Draper's jaw, orbital bone, cheekbone and nose, and caused a concussion, was not fatal or career-ending but easily could have been. The Wings went on to win the Stanley Cup as the best team in the NHL, one of four for McCarty and Draper, best friends. McCarty was best man at Draper's wedding. Along the way, McCarty said he became addicted to gambling, alcohol, marijuana, Ecstasy and cocaine, as reported by Deadline Detroit. He lost $6.2 million and filed for bankruptcy according to ESPN. McCarty was put in the NHL substance abuse program four times. McCarty remained employed until four events in succession in 2007: he suffered a sports hernia injury, Calgary did not re-sign him, he failed an NHL drug screen resulting in a ban from the NHL until he was drug-free. Draper, still a Red Wing, was also part-owner of the Flint Generals of the International Hockey League, Draper signed his friend in January 2008 and paved his way to return to the Red Wings in March. In a 1995 interview, the late Steve Howe, 48, said many professional athletes use cocaine for energy because of the travel and physical demands. Howe, a left-handed relief pitcher for Major League Baseball and U-M, was banned for life from baseball in 1992 for drug use, including seven times for cocaine. He threw between 90-96 miles-per-hour. Unlike the general public, McCarty was never imprisoned for cocaine use, purchases or trafficking. Howe stayed overnight once awaiting JANE REILLY Groundcover vendor No. 611 believes medical marijuana saved his life and uses it for pain. He now earns a living through speaking engagements and selling marijuana. Still, elite employers avoid hiring candidates who choose these options, legal or not. Cannabis may have closed more doors for McCarty than it opened. \"Darren is a wonderful example of arraignment in 1991, according to the Los Angeles Times wire service. A plea deal reducing the felony to a misdemeanor resulted in the MLB lifetime ban. Felony cocaine conviction means five years imprisonment in Montana where Howe moved and four in Michigan. Howe, from Clarkston, was reinstated in 1993 because of the MLB Players Association, possibly in an attempt to save his life. Individual teams, MLB and the NHL made money from the work of Howe and still do from McCarty. The Professional Women's Hockey League just finished its first season in history. It played 24 regular season games, with either three or four days between games. It also has specific checking rules to eliminate dangerous hits of stationary players and hits away from the puck. The same NHL rule is rarely enforced. The NHL players take multiple strides before checking. The NHL plays 82 regular season games, of which two a month are consecutive. The remainder have either two or three days in between. More rest between games and enforcing the checking rules means less exhaustion, fewer injuries, eliminates the need for cocaine and lessens the need for painkillers. It also means less money. McCarty now has his own cannabis brand, named after himself. He someone who has constantly reinvented himself,\" SAWC Development Director Sarah Paspal-Jasinski wrote via email. \"Every time he gets knocked down, he gets back up. As a substance abuse survivor, Darren has explored many paths since he left hockey. He has boxed, golfed, become a public speaker, and an entrepreneur. This makes him relatable and an ideal guest speaker for our organization. He understands the experiences of those we serve who are experiencing homelessness and recognizes how circumstances and decisions in life can bring you down. However, Darren's journey exemplifies that you can always rise again and reinvent yourself.\" At \"Almost Home,\" guests had the opportunity to: purchase $100 raffle tickets to gamble for a one in 52 chance to win $2,600, purchase as many $30 tickets as were available for wine pulls (choosing a mystery bottle of various prices), compete against each other in a silent auction and learn about becoming \"a sophisticated stoner,\" as McCarty referred to himself in The Detroit Free Press. Encouraging gambling, drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, all legal addictive behaviors prohibited at the Delonis Center, ensures job security for Delonis staff. Like all the Delonis clients, McCarty is being helped by SAWC. It is keeping both itself and McCarty employed.

This article is kind of an open article for Christians — and whoever else wants to come along. In the ageless, timeless Book it is declared: “Let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.” (Gen 14.d-g, GNV) Like any widely observable and somewhat rare Heavenly phenomenon, the Great American Eclipse (April 8, 2024) came and went, and with it the typical doomsdayers and spin prognosticators seeking to capture it to their ends. If we consult The Maker of The Eclipse, however, we might just find HIS timeless, priceless message. It was widely advertised that the trajectory of the 2024 Eclipse that passed through North America included seven cities that are named Nineveh. There is also an eighth city of Ninevah that the Great American Eclipse passed through in Canada. Often in The Bible we find repeating names of people and places when GOD wants to emphasize certain indications and meanings from those names. Also, various Christian scholars throughout the ages (and in modern time, most notably D. James Kennedy, “The Gospel In The Stars”) have noted that stars, constellations and planetary signs are interspersed throughout The Bible. The scales of Libra make their appearance in The Book of Daniel (Daniel 5:27). WARNING! A Kingdom wanting for justice — will soon have it meted out. The Symbol of Libra also appears in Revelation with one of the four apocalyptic horsemen carrying it and crying out, “A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and oil, and wine hurt [you] not,” (Rev 6:5), signifying economic hardship and/or famine. The Virgin of Virgo has an extra-special picture for us to wonder at; the Deliverer-Child birthed to Her, and the old cataclysmic battle from \"The Dragon\" against Her and This Child (Rev 12), enraged and doing all he can, however he can — to seek their demise (Rev 12:34, 6-7-17). Holy Scripture indicates eclipses as special attesting indications from GOD (Joshua 10.12, Isaiah 13.10, Acts 2.20) and we find a special eclipse or an eclipse-like effect occurring during the three hours CHRIST was atoning for our sins on HIS Cross (Luke 23:44-45). But it was to Jonah (Matt 12:39, 16:4) that CHRIST referred when people requested of HIM “a sign.” So what is the sign and message of Jonah? And what BLESSING is there if we receive its impact? Why will we not want to miss this special message, even after the Eclipse itself has come and gone? When Jonah was being RESCUED, he JULY 12, 2024 Jonah and the Great American Eclipse: are we yet missing it? declared, “They that wait upon lying vanities, forsake their own mercy”’ (Jonah 2:8, GNV). What if we observe Heavenly Signs and Earthly Wonders — and never really meet with and worship The GOD WHO made them? Why would we want to appreciate spectacular effects and not connect with the special, awesome PERSON from WHOM these proceed (see John 6:26 and Jeremiah 29:13)? Let’s step back in time; Jonah was one of GOD’s Prophets, though unlike most of the prophets, Jonah was sent to a “heathen” people — to Nineveh — to warn them that they might repent, turn to GOD and not face judgment. The Assyrian Kingdom that Nineveh was the capital of, and to which Jonah was sent, was expanding greatly. Meanwhile, Jeroboam II was a wicked King who was reigning over the Nation of Israel, with its capital Jerusalem. It’s like GOD was saying, “OK, the Nation of Israel through which I’ve been seeking to get my message of grace out to everyone in the whole earth isn’t cooperating; so, I’ll send SOMEONE (Isaiah 49:6-7, Luke 2:32) directly to these other people — starting at Nineveh.” Jonah didn’t want to obey GOD and tell this other group of people, this other nation, about GOD’s Mercy and Love they would experience if they would but turn to HIM (Jonah 4:2). Some of that seems to be nationalistic superiority; Jonah certainly was missing GOD’s plan and Heart (as in Luke 9:54-55). There also was likely understandable fear! “What will occur if that rival nation continues its expansion? Can GOD be trusted?” It would also be really embarrassing for Jonah and the Nation of Israel that GOD had been pleading to be HIS witness to everyone! In the whole earth, if Nineveh and not Jerusalem was repenting. However, even now the “religious Jerusalem” (See Rom 9:6 and Rev 21:2) isn’t repenting. Yet GOD will get HIS message of mercy to everyone somehow; and HE will not forsake his own nor any of HIS promises. We fallen and finite humans want “the Wrong Thing.” Instead of really caring about people and see JONAH page 11  JULY 12, 2024 PUZZLES 1 13 17 20 23 29 32 33 37 40 43 46 51 52 55 56 57 60 63 58 61 64 38 41 44 47 53 59 62 65 45 48 54 49 50 42 34 24 18 21 25 30 22 26 27 28 31 35 39 36 2 4 5 6 7 GROUNDCOVER NEWS CROSSWORD from the International Network of Street Papers 3 8 14 15 16 19 9 10 11 12 9 Groundcover Vendor Code While Groundcover is a non-profit, and paper vendors are self-employed contractors, we still have expectations of how vendors should conduct themselves while selling and representing the paper.

It’s one of the many things that make the city lively and fun. My friend Ben recently received a commission to do an amazing mural at Washtenaw Dairy. There was a 10 by 40 foot mural called “Best Boy Blue” of a staggering and under-recognized genius that went up in Graffiti Alley last month. Graffiti is a voice of underserved people that expresses concerns about society, remembers lost loved ones, or shows affection for bodily functions and components, to name a few. Originally seen as a form of vandalism, graffiti has evolved into a recognized art form that shapes the visual and cultural landscape of neighborhoods worldwide. This evolution challenges conventional perceptions and highlights graffiti's role in fostering creativity and community engagement. Beyond aesthetics, graffiti plays a crucial role in shaping neighborhood identity. It serves as a visual representation of cultural diversity, historical narratives, and community values, thereby fostering a collective memory among residents. This cultural richness distinguishes neighborhoods and enhances their appeal as vibrant, livable spaces. However, the increasing popularity of graffiti has also sparked debates about gentrification and urban development. Real estate developers and businesses sometimes appropriate graffiti to enhance property values or attract affluent residents, displacing long-time residents and erasing the authentic character of neighborhoods. In recent years, graffiti has become a prominent medium for social justice movements. Artists use walls as canvases to memorialize victims of racial injustice, challenge systemic racism, and advocate for social change. These murals serve as poignant reminders of ongoing struggles and rallying points for community solidarity. Anthony McCormick, a local housing justice advocate, said, “Destroying a mural is equivalent to silencing a community. These voices that once cried out for recognition now fade into the background.” Recognizing public art’s potential as a vehicle for education and community engagement, schools and organizations increasingly incorporate graffiti workshops and mural projects into their curricula. These initiatives not only teach artistic skills but also foster civic responsibility and cultural awareness among participants. By involving residents in the creation of public art, communities build social cohesion and strengthen bonds across ROBBIE FEBRUARY Groundcover contributor Huron Street bridge after BLM mural was taken down. JULY 12, 2024 diverse demographics. In neighborhoods with rich cultural histories, graffiti serves as a means of preserving traditions and memories. Artists draw inspiration from local folklore, ancestral practices, and community narratives to create murals that celebrate diversity and challenge stereotypes. Graffiti thus becomes a living archive that documents stories and experiences, ensuring that cultural heritage continues to resonate within contemporary urban settings. Despite its cultural value, graffiti faces regulatory challenges and legal scrutiny in many municipalities. Advocates argue for policies that recognize graffiti as a legitimate art form while addressing concerns about property damage. By fostering dialogue between artists, policymakers, and community members, cities can develop inclusive strategies that promote responsible graffiti practices and support artistic freedom. Ann Arbor shame One culturally significant piece has existed on the Huron Street railroad bridge — a hangout near the Delonis Center — for a few years. This piece of art recognized those that were killed by police, specifically people of color; it celebrated their lives and called for change. This art was significant and this art had meaning but it was removed. Replacing art of those killed in police action with “flower-washed” tissue box art disrespects the community whose collective struggle it represents. In May 2024, Ann Arbor unveiled a new mural adorning that same bridge, signaling a transformational moment for the city's downtown area. The mural's vibrant colors and flowery theme were intended to beautify the area and create a sense of pride and shared identity among local residents; but some feel differently. One local resident and artist stepped away from the excellent job they were doing managing FedUp Food Ministries to speak with me. Cortney Labbe said, “They intended to include Delonis Center residents in the project. I am not sure they did so. I’m surprised that covering up a significant Black Lives Matter mural didn’t raise any concerns during planning.” Ripping out and replacing significant art to meet upper middle class aesthetics will not create the future that Ann Arborites want. According to newspaper reports, the corporate artists and their supporters, “The Murals That Bridge,” raised over $150,000 for this and a similar amount for other overpass mural projects. That is more than 15% of the budget for The Shelter Association of Washtenaw County. SAWC claims to serve more than 1200 people annually. Therefore, this effort to turn the Huron Street Bridge BLM mural into a Kleenex advertisement is a waste of funds that could otherwise house, feed and support nearly 200 at-risk individuals in our community for a year. It demonstrates a lack of understanding of art, human kindness and fiscal responsibility. If we continue to feed the cultural racism masquerading as quasi-philanthropic acts, our community will continue to fracture around borders. socioeconomic JULY 12, 2024 CONTINUED  JAMES from page 7 drawing what moves me. If someone wants an image of tribal art, I'm willing to go for it. Many also use this for tattoos or just hang it on a wall. Believe it or not, I have two commissions I’m currently working on. I hope to get more as the summer progresses. “I'm looking at the possibility of going into art school and getting a bachelor's degree in graphic design and starting some computer graphics classes as well. \"The art form I now practice is called abstract tribal art. Abstract is shapeless and formless, influenced by indigenous tribes across the world, along with the influence of lovecraft, steampunk, cyberpunk, bubblegum, pacific rim, Battle Angel and Dragon Ball Z.” Conclusion As a low income artist it can be hard to get art supplies and work. So I give a small shout to the world to help with James’ work. If you wish to show interest or even commission a piece of work from James, please contact Groundcover (page 2), or you can often find James near the downtown Ann Arbor library on the corner of Fifth Street and GROUNDCOVER NEWS 11 Liberty selling Groundcover News. You can also help James out by giving him any of the following: • mechanical pencils • fine point sharpies • sketchbooks (medium sized) • Prismacolor fine point pens • small sketchbook for ideas  JONAH from page 8 animals, we want esteem, trendy causes, right doctrine and liturgy, clubby, churchy culture. The message Jonah ultimately points us to however, is CHRIST’S Cross and HIS Resurrection. Here we find encouragement and hope for humanity. The Book of Jonah points to CHRIST via symbol-types; for example, prophetically prefiguring depictions that parallel HIS PERSON, sufferings, death, resurrection and redeeming mission. Just a few of these are; The \"Word\" (John 1:1) that comes to Jonah (Jonah 1:1) to The Assyrian King (Jonah 3:6) and The Word that is proclaimed (Jonah 3.4, 7-9). Jonah as the strange, out-of-realm “FOREIGNER,” and the “guilty” one who must be sacrificed for others’ absolution and freedom (Jonah 1.:, 11-12). The REDEEMER, the SUFFERING ONE; and one who is utterly forsaken (Jonah 2.4, Matt 27:46) all prefigure and point to CHRIST’S PERSON. Almost all of Jonah Chapter 2 is replete with descriptions paralleling CHRIST’S sufferings and death, and temporary banishment to Hell. From 2:3 for example, “Weeds were wrapped around my head” even specifically prefigures the horror of the Crown of Thorns CHRIST would receive. Jonah was spared death; however the language indicating death pangs and death following and along with grueling sufferings, are intertwined throughout Jonah Chapter 2. We find descriptors such as, “Out of the belly of hell,” (Jonah 2:2), and “The waters compassed me about unto the soul: the depth closed me round about …” (Jonah 2:5a-b) , and “For [you had] cast me into the bottom in the midst of the sea, and the floods compassed me about: all [YOUR] surges, and all [YOUR] waves passed over me.” (Jonah 2:3) for example. CHRIST’S RESURRECTION is vividly and poetically afore depicted as, “I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me forever; yet [have YOU] brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my GOD” (Jonah 2:6) Also, other various allusions prophetically indicating CHRIST are presented via Jonah’s Redeeming Mission, a parallel/contrast of the Redeemer asleep in the bottom of a boat during a storm that has other passengers troubled, and casting of lots that occurs, just as it will/ did for CHRIST’S last garments. Each of these pointers thus, is towards CHRIST; just like the Voice present at HIS baptism that Calls Out; “This is MY BELOVED SON; HEAR HIM!” This message is therefore inviting us to believe on JESUS and be saved (Mark 1:15, John 14:6) transformed to be like JESUS (Rom 13:14) — and as much as we will (Matt 13:8). Also then, CHRIST’S people and church are supposed-to-be being “salt and light” on this Earth, bringing GOD’S mercies to as many people as possible who will receive HIM. We are also supposed-to-be not only GOD’s Voice calling people out from the ways of this fallen, sinful world, but also exactly to GOD’s Ways of LOVE and MERCY (Matt 12:7, John 13:34). This includes not only acknowledging the ONE, TRUE and LIVING GOD; but also exactly in HIS SPIRIT to minister to practical needs and empower to “a leg up” — just as the First Century Christians actually did! (Acts 2:44-47, Acts 4:34-35) It’s not enough to simply wish people good (Jas 2:16 a-c , I John 3:17) ; we must actively be bringing GOD’S mercies via meeting practical needs, and opening jobs and opportunities. We must do this for everyone. Including the outcasts, the non-in-crowd, those who for whatever reasons have practical needs for life openings and resources. Whatever blessings I have, I therefore have the responsibility to seek the blessing of others. At this time in Christian history, there has been much saying correct teachings about who CHRIST is, and the salvation from our sin HE offers — though astonishingly then not actually being as JESUS in this World— to have and lead the way for social conscience, to give gladly what we truly can to stop our arrogance of blame for practical needs and invite people to the level ground at the foot of CHRIST’S Cross. To humbly seek to live in and offer CHRIST’S transformational LOVE to a world in need! Exactly this includes offering job openings, life calling opportunities, providing resources and means, empowering shoulder to shoulder. This fallen, sinful world only has counterfeits! This is also why it’s so important that GOD’s conduit for modern-day — the actual, believing Christian Church — return to being “on-mission” with GOD and HIS mercies for people and animals and for this World that HE created and HIMSELF suffered and died for (John 3:16-17). It’s easier and more “culturally comfortable” to cognitively believe — as even demons do! (Jas 2:19) — all the right facts, doctrine. The actual, liberating Gospel of Jesus however, calls us to real heart transformation and life (II Cor 5:17). The Christian contemporary band Casting Crowns has a line in a song that says, “What if we put down our signs, crossed over the lines, and loved like [HE] did?” “Churchianity” calls us to counterfeit; THE HOLY SPIRIT calls us to really live the values of JESUS — to be HIS Hands and Feet (I John 4:17)— in all aspects of our lives. THE HOLY SPIRIT wants “a cup of cold water” (Matt 10.42) to be given in JESUS’ name. When CHRIST’S people don’t do this, others counterfeit. Jonah’s message includes the irony that if those of us who “believe-on-JESUS” are refusing our mission — GOD in HIS mercies will nonetheless one way or the other send out and offer HIS mercies. As GOD deals with people in The Book of Jonah, we find HE is completely trustworthy. HIS ways are goodness, truth, mercy. HE will never leave us nor forsake us (Heb 13:5). Following HIM leads us only to good for ourselves and others — though sometimes in this fallen, sinful world also with some sufferings and persecutions. There is a 1990s song by Christian singers FFH called “Big Fish” that certainly can be a fun reminder about Jonah and GOD’s Message to and through him, and thankfully over our own failings. A sad thing regarding Jonah is that after he was delivered and no longer in danger: 1) He allowed himself to forget the tender touch of GOD’S LOVE that he had experienced SO powerfully and particularly while he was being rescued (Jonah 2:6-10); 2) Jonah did not continue to defer to GOD when his own limited understandings were challenging what GOD exp. 01/31/2025 was actually telling him and CALLING him to do (Jonah 4:1-4). As we look forward, will we ourselves receive JESUS and truly share HIM with others? The gourd plant (also symbolizing CHRIST) that comforted Jonah and then was mercilessly eaten by a worm exposed Jonah’s return to hypocritical, non-care for people and animals (Jonah 4:2, 11). This observation helps us realize our own utter callousness to CHRIST, people, animals, and plants. In light of CHRIST’S horrible sufferings and death to atone for us, after GOD stretched out HIS arms on a cross — WHAT ARE WE DOING? Are we living HIS LOVE? Being HIS Hands and Feet? For shame! If we don’t seek our every breath and moment — given back in praise and gratitude to HIM. FATHER, help us look to YOU, and not miss the BLESSED sign of Jonah; to point us to CHRIST JESUS and the LOVE HE has for us EACH and ALL, and wants us to have for each other. AMEN.\n\n2 GROUNDCOVER NEWS GROUNDCOVER free community EVENTS ANN ARBOR JAYCEES ANNUAL FOURTH OF JULY PARADE Thursday, July 4, 10 a.m. The parade route starts at E. William St. and S.
