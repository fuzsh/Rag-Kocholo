        "text": "EVERY generation gets the rock documentary it deserves. As he followed the young Bob Dylan in 1965, D. A. Pennebaker captured a singer-songwriter in transition from boyish folkie to wary, druggy and dandified rebel in “Don’t Look Back.” Martin Scorsese’s “Last Waltz” found the Band, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell and Mr. Dylan under the influence of money and the effects of a long ’60s hangover. The ’80s brought Penelope Spheeris’s “Decline of Western Civilization Part Two: The Metal Years,” a sort of real-life “Spinal Tap.” With the long-delayed DVD release this month of David Markey’s Sonic Youth tour documentary, “1991: The Year Punk Broke,” Generation X, characteristically tardy, finally gets its shot.\n\nAs the Sonic Youth guitarist Lee Ranaldo put it, “It’s kind of outlining the birth of Lollapalooza Nation before it happened.”\n\nSonic Youth is the star, but the film is filled with about two dozen other up-and-coming musicians at the time, most of them smartly mumbling or squinting with suspicion. As definitive as “1991: The Year Punk Broke” is, it might have remained a footnote if one of those musicians wasn’t a pre-fame Kurt Cobain. His presence elevates the footage from documentary to both fetish item and cautionary tale.\n\nEven the title is something of a joke, first uttered by Mr. Markey, a director in Los Angeles who had flown to London with Nirvana that August. (“Those guys had just been up all night shooting the video for ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit,’ and I think Kurt had clashed with the director.”) As Mr. Markey recovered from jet lag with members of Sonic Youth at a hotel in Ireland, they watched Mötley Crüe on MTV playing a cover of “Anarchy in the U.K.” by the Sex Pistols. “And I just said, ‘1991 is the year punk broke,’ ” Mr. Markey recalled. “They kind of snickered, and from there we all started saying it to each other.”\n\nProudly self-marginalizing, the notion of punk ever breaking out seemed absurd. “Sonic Youth had already witnessed the commercial failure of the Replacements and Hüsker Dü,” Mr. Markey said, in a telephone interview. But Sonic Youth was opening arena shows for Neil Young earlier in the year, and most of the other bands on the circuit — like Dinosaur Jr., Mudhoney, Babes in Toyland and Gumball — were also playing to the largest audiences of their careers. Sonic Youth’s noise rock had found a home on a major label, DGC, and the group had convinced Nirvana to sign as well. Still, the musicians anticipated nothing more than a slightly easier ride after touring by van in the ’80s.\n\n“I guess we never expected that just around the corner there was this other level of success for a band that came out of our scene,” Mr. Ranaldo said.\n\nPart of the fascination with “1991: The Year Punk Broke” is that we know the seismic changes about to happen to the musicians. “It’s almost like watching the moment before a car crash,” Mr. Young said. Cobain, just three years from his death at the age of 27, hardly seems destined or doomed. He spends most of his time mugging for the camera with the energy of a child at a rollicking birthday party.\n\nThose who know the Nirvana story only as a cautionary tale of drugs, angst and death, or others who’ve come to dismiss Sonic Youth as too cool, will be shocked by the goofy high comedy of nearly every backstage moment. The film’s working title was “Tooth or Hair,” a play on the Madonna tour film, “Truth or Dare,” released theatrically that May. “Sonic Youth’s fascination with Madonna was well into its fourth or fifth year at that point,” Mr. Markey noted, referring in part to an album that Sonic Youth and Mike Watt, the former Minutemen bassist, had released under the name Ciccone Youth in 1988. Now for Mr. Markey’s camera Sonic Youth’s singer and bassist, Kim Gordon, and Cobain were recreating a notorious moment between Madonna and Kevin Costner.\n\nMr. Markey’s cheap, D.I.Y. approach and single Super 8 camera had endeared him to his younger subjects. His 1984 cult musical, “Desperate Teenage Lovedolls,” and his association with Sonic Youth (he’d directed the video for the band’s track “Mildred Pierce,” starring a young Sofia Coppola) were also useful calling cards. “We knew he’d made ‘Desperate Teenage Lovedolls’ — that film is great,” Nirvana’s bassist, Krist Novoselic, said, adding that the soundtrack featured Black Flag, Redd Kross and other Nirvana favorites.\n\nWhile Mr. Markey edited about nine hours of footage in a makeshift Hollywood studio in early 1992, “Nevermind” pushed its way up the Billboard charts. Self-conscious about exploiting his new friends or disrespecting the film’s intended stars, the members of Sonic Youth, Mr. Markey was careful not to include too much of the Nirvana live footage in the final film, which relied on the backstage mugging instead (much of it by Sonic Youth’s singer-guitarist Thurston Moore).\n\nWhen Lori Barbero, then the drummer for Babes in Toyland, saw the film, she couldn’t believe her antics were there on the big screen. “I forgot I told a joke and stuck a finger up Mark Arm’s nose,” she said, referring to the lead singer of Mudhoney.\n\nBut she also found it heart wrenching, especially a brief appearance of a smiling Joe Cole, a onetime roadie for Black Flag who was killed at the end of 1991. (He is the subject of Sonic Youth’s tribute song “100%.”) When Cobain committed suicide in 1994, the film took on even more of a difficult, bittersweet tone. “The cable news networks were showing my movie footage,” Mr. Markey said, “and some of them were getting it wrong. They were showing footage of Thurston and saying it was Kurt.”\n\nWhile available on VHS, “1991: The Year Punk Broke” fell victim to the legal battle over the Nirvana estate through much of the last decade and a half and was never released on DVD, until this month. “It was just music business back-and-forth,” Mr. Markey said. In the intervening years, Mr. Markey put together a 40-minute sister film titled “(This Is Known as) The Blues Scale” (after an onstage remark by Cobain) that included some of the unused Nirvana material. It was intended for a 2004 DVD edition of “1991,” but as the wrangling continued, that release date came and went as well. “People began e-mailing me and saying, ‘When is it coming out?’ ” Mr. Markey said. “As the years wore on, I just grew more skeptical myself. Will it ever see the light of day?”\n\nTwo milestones finally helped pull the film out of the legal quicksand. Sonic Youth began digitally transferring its archives with an eye toward its 30th anniversary, and Universal Records (which owns DGC and is behind the DVD) began planning a series of releases and events leading up to “Nevermind”’s 20th anniversary, also this month. Of all the “Nevermind”-related fanfare this month the giddiness and lack of narrative of “1991: The Year Punk Broke” may do the most to add texture to the legacy and allow a new generation to make Nirvana its own.\n\n“When you watch us play those songs on film, they are pretty much how they sound on the record,” Mr. Novoselic said. “We were a good band. We weren’t just a schtick.”"
