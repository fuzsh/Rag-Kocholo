        "text": "The older I get, the more apocryphal this list seems. I saw a lot of bands, but I don’t remember seeing some of the bands on this very dumb list I made for MySpace. I look back at making this list, and I think about what I was doing with my first real experience being way-too-online. Anyway, I don’t want this to disappear, however embarrassing it feels to read now. I love music, there I said it. I like lists.

Better understanding how algorithms work, these lists weren’t a terrible idea. Now there are websites that cater to the collector of titles, and names, but back in the day, I was just hoping to make some new, like minded friends. This hasn’t been updated, it’s (oh my god) fifteen years old. Again, you dear reader are beautiful and nice and smart and I love you (please forgive me for this spot of inane vanity)."
