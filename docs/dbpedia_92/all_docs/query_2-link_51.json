Following the demise of his first band, the Czars, Grant left music entirely for over five years, only to achieve greater success as a solo artist (his acclaimed 2015 solo LP Grey Tickles, Black Pressure went top five in the UK). Born in Michigan to a devoutly religious family, Grant has lived in Iceland full time since 2011, the same year he was diagnosed HIV-positive. Grant’s most recent album, Love Is Magic, is now available via Partisan Records."
