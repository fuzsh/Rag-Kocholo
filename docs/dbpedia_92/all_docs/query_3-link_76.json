It means exactly going 55 mph because Sammy Hagar had a record called “I Can’t Drive 55.” He had the red line through the 55, so we did it without the red line because we thought, “This guy is taking chances driving but his music is the tamest shit ever!” So we thought we’d go real crazy with the music and then drive real safe (laughs). It was like, nobody got it."
