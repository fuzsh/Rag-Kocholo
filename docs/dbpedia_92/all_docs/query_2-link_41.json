        "text": "VIA PRESS RELEASE | The filmmakers behind Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story share a trailer of the documentary that coincides with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign to help finish the film.\n\nIn 1978, in the Southern California beach suburb of Hawthorne, the same town that was home to The Beach Boys, two brothers Jeff and Steven McDonald aged 15 and 11 respectively, started a band called The Tourists. The first time The Tourists played in front of anyone was at Black Flag’s legendary rehearsal space, The Church in Hermosa Beach. The older band gave The Tourists not only their seal of approval but a new name—Red Cross. The spelling was later changed to Redd Kross after the high school-age brothers received a cease and desist order from the International Red Cross.\n\nThe film is directed by Andrew Reich an Emmy Award-winning television comedy writer/showrunner, best known as an Executive Producer on Friends. He has written and produced television pilots featuring stars such as Zac Efron, Candice Bergen, and Zachary Levi. Born Innocent is produced by Julian Cautherley an Emmy-Award winning filmmaker whose projects have participated at Sundance, Berlin, South By Southwest, and TriBeca Film Festivals and have twice been shortlisted for an Academy Award.\n\nThe documentary has already filmed interviews with Jeff and Steve and Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Buzz Osbourne and Dale Crover (The Melvins), and original Red Cross member Greg Hetson (Bad Religion, Circle Jerks). With the help of the Kickstarter campaign the filmmakers will interview many other musicians and artists influenced by the seminal Redd Kross.\n\nThe high school-age McDonalds received a letter from the International Red Cross threatening legal action if they continued to use the name “Red Cross.” Jeff’s response was to change their name to “Redd Kross” in an homage to comedian Redd Foxx. With their new name, Redd Kross continued to evolve their sound. Their Neurotica record would prove to be one of the crucial influences on the Grunge scene in Seattle that changed music in the 1990’s.\n\nRedd Kross played a show at the Tacoma Ballroom in 1987 that was attended by the future members of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. They proved that a band could have a heavy guitar attack and still have great pop melodies, an approach that Nirvana would take to world domination.\n\nWhen pop music caught up to what they were doing and grunge was on the rise, Redd Kross pivoted again, making a sugary bubblegum record for their major label debut, Third Eye, which sported a nude Sofia Coppola on the cover. And while they had previously starred in the cult classics Desperate Teenage Lovedolls and Lovedolls Superstar, the ’90s saw them star in their first studio movie. Before there was The Brady Bunch Movie, there was The Spirit of 76, a ’70s nostalgia movie that saw Jeff and Steve starring alongside David Cassidy, Leif Garrett, and Devo.\n\nTheir next evolution had them perfecting a beefy power pop sound, with their records Phaseshifter and Show World. This was the phase that garnered them fans from Robert Plant to Joe Elliott of Def Leppard to Dave Davies of The Kinks.\n\nWe already have hours of interviews filmed with Jeff and Steve McDonald. We have also interviewed Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) Buzz Osbourne and Dale Crover (The Melvins), and original Red Cross member Greg Hetson (Bad Religion, Circle Jerks). With your support we hope to film additional interviews with most if not all of the following fans of the band and key figures in the Redd Kross story:\n\nKeith Morris (Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Off!)\n\nCharlotte Caffey (The Go-Go’s)\n\nRodney Bingenheimer (KROQ)\n\nMike Watt (The Minutemen)\n\nChuck Dukowski (Black Flag)\n\nPat Smear (The Germs, Nirvana)\n\nBelinda Carlisle (The Go-Go’s)\n\nKim Gordon (Sonic Youth)\n\nJonathan Poneman (Sub Pop Records)\n\nMark Arm (Mudhoney)\n\nKim Thayil (Soundgarden)\n\nJeff Ament (Pearl Jam)\n\nA.C. Newman (The New Pornographers)\n\nAnna Waronker (That Dog)\n\nDave Markey (Director, Desperate Teenage Lovedolls and The Year That Punk Broke)\n\nJordan Schwartz (We Got Power fanzine)\n\nJohn Doe (X)\n\nMilo Aukerman (The Descendents)\n\nLee Burger (Burger Records)\n\nAnthony Keidis (Red Hot Chili Peppers)\n\nFlea (Red Hot Chili Peppers)\n\nMac McCaughan (Superchunk, Merge Records)\n\nRaymond Pettibon (artist)\n\nJack White (White Stripes)\n\nGibby Haynes (Butthole Surfers)\n\nSteven Malkmus (Pavement)\n\nJ. Mascis (Dinosaur Jr.)\n\nGreg Dulli (Afghan Whigs)\n\nMark Lanegan (Screaming Trees)\n\nJack Antonoff (fun.)\n\nRon and Russell Mael (Sparks)\n\nWe will also film interviews with current or former Redd Kross band members: Brian Reitzell, Robert Hecker, Gere Fennelly, Dez Cadena, Janet Housden, Roy McDonald, Ron Reyes, Jack Irons, Jason Shapiro, and Dale Crover."
