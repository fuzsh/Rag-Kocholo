        "text": "This low budget film from the Los Angeles mid-80's post-punk (what ever happened to THAT phrase?) underground has more going for it than most big money Hollywood films from that era. Why? It's ingenious inventiveness for one. You would never know it was shot on Super-8 and cast from Southern California's punk scene. It's on-the-money tearing apart of sacred cows for another. Whether it's \"rockstars\" or record label executives; religious leaders, or pimps. No one is spared! There may not be high production value (although it looks a hell of a lot better than it's predecessor \"Desperate Teenage Lovedolls\"), it's the ideas and clever execution that shine through and transcend what one would expect. Damningly hilarious parodies of everything from feminism to (surprise) hardcore punk. Also Funny send-ups of \"Billy Jack\" and Bruce Springsteen's / Brian Depalma directed \"Dancing In the Dark\" video.) It is also ahead of it's time, witness the political monologue delivered by none other than the President himself (Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys. ) 60's icon (and tie to \"Psyche-Out\"), Sky Saxon of the Seeds appears, as does Walking-Like-An-Egyptian Bangle Victoria Peterson. I get the feeling Quentin Tarantino saw these films as a young 'un, as the dialogue comes from the same 70's pop culture vernacular. Written by Dave Markey, Jennifer Schwartz, Jeff McDonald, & Steve McDonald (the latter two of Redd Kross, who provide much of the great soundtrack.) Director Dave Markey also created the Nirvana vehicle, 1991 The Year Punk Broke."
