Background information Birth Name Steven Shane McDonald Born 24 May 1967 Occupation Musician, Actor, Producer Genres Alternative Rock, Garage Rock, Pop, Hardcore Punk, Sludge Metal, Grunge Instrument(s) Bass, Vocals Years active 1978 - Present Labels Gasatanka, Giant, Atlantic, Mercury, Merge, VICE, Ipecac, Amphetamine Reptile Associated acts Melvins, OFF!, Redd Kross Website Instagram\n\nSteven Shane McDonald (born May 24, 1967) is an American rock musician, active as a musician since the age of eleven. McDonald is best known as the bass guitarist in the Los Angeles alternative rock/power pop band Redd Kross, along with several adjacent projects in the 1980s into the 2000s. McDonald has appeared in numerous film projects with his older brother Jeff McDonald, including the 1984 film Desperate Teenage Lovedolls and its sequel Lovedolls Superstar; and the 1990 film Spirit of '76. To date Redd Kross have released seven studio albums and three extended plays.\n\nMcDonald would join the hardcore punk supergroup OFF! in 2010 and remain active with the band until 2021, performing on three studio albums and several EPs.\n\nCurrently, along with Redd Kross, McDonald has since been the bassist for Melvins since 2015. Along with becoming one of the longest tenured bassists of the band, he has performed on several releases including six studio albums and several EPs.\n\nBiography[]\n\nRedd Kross (1980 - Present)[]\n\nIn April 1979, the band had their first practice in the living room of original drummer, John Stielow's parent's living room. The first song they played was 'Annette's Got the Hits'. Other songs such as 'Cover Band', 'S&M Party' and 'I Hate My School' were also played that same first practice. They eventually changed the band name to Red Cross, which was allegedly inspired by the masturbation scene in the film The Exorcist. They soon began working on their 1980 debut self-titled EP. The band's first gig was opening for Black Flag in 1979.[1]\n\nEventually, Hetson left to join the Circle Jerks (and later Bad Religion) and Reyes left for Black Flag. They appeared on the Posh Boy compilation The Siren, and then to complete the lineup on their first full-length album, Born Innocent, they assembled a revolving door of musicians including original drummer John Stielow. Full of the brothers' pop culture obsessions, Born Innocent featured odes to Linda Blair (who starred in a television movie of the same name), a cover of \"Look on Up from the Bottom\" by the Carrie Nations from Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, and Charles Manson (whose song \"Cease to Exist\" they covered). The album also contains nods to Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Tatum O'Neal, and Lita Ford. Not long after the release of the album, the group was threatened with a lawsuit from the International Red Cross and changed the spelling of their name to Redd Kross, allegedly being inspired by Redd Foxx.\n\nIn 1984, Redd Kross returned with drummer Dave Peterson to record Teen Babes from Monsanto, an album featuring covers by Kiss, David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, and The Shangri-Las. In 1984, lead guitarist Robert Hecker joined the band, as they embarked on tour in support of Teen Babes from Monsanto. In that same year, they were featured on the soundtrack of Desperate Teenage Lovedolls with their cover of the Brady Bunch Kids' \"It's a Sunshine Day\". Jeff and Steve appear in the movie, along with Robert in the sequel Lovedolls Superstar which the brothers co-wrote with Dave Markey and Jennifer Schwartz. Both movies are available now on DVD. In 1985, drummer Roy McDonald (later of The Muffs and formerly of The Things, and no relation to the brothers) joined the band. In 1987, Redd Kross released Neurotica, an album reportedly influenced by Saturday morning cartoons and breakfast cereal (one of the songs was called \"Frosted Flake\"). Although the album itself was successful, the band's label, Big Time Records folded. The band continued to tour during these years however, and in 1988, drummer Victor Indrizzo joined the band.\n\nOn February 20, 1990, Redd Kross appeared on Episode 2 of the cult Public-access television show \"Decoupage\" with Summer Caprice. In 1990, Redd Kross signed with Atlantic Records, releasing Third Eye, and appeared with David Cassidy in the film Spirit of '76, and issued several singles, including \"Annie's Gone\", which had some mild success on college radio. Former Red Hot Chili Peppers / future Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons joined for the Third Eye tours, and appears in the promotional video for \"Annie's Gone\", which saw some light rotation on MTV. Brian Reitzell succeeded Irons as drummer in the band, and appears in the promotional video for \"1976\". In 1991, Robert Hecker took leave from the band.\n\nThe album Phaseshifter was released in 1993, with new band members Eddie Kurdziel, Gere Fennelly, and Brian Reitzell. The videos for \"Jimmy's Fantasy\" and \"Lady In The Front Row\" were both shown on MTV's 120 Minutes. They toured on Phaseshifter for over a year, headlining their own shows as well as tours supporting The Lemonheads and The Spin Doctors in late 1993 and Stone Temple Pilots in 1994. In 1995, Jeff and his wife, Charlotte Caffey (from The Go-Go's), had a daughter named Astrid (who presently fronts her own band The Side Eyes). In 1997, Redd Kross released Show World, produced by Chris Shaw (who also produced albums for Weezer and Soul Asylum) and toured supporting The Presidents of the United States of America. The band took an indefinite hiatus after the Show World tour, and their future was uncertain after the untimely death of guitarist Eddie Kurdziel on June 6, 1999.\n\nOn July 1, 2006, Redd Kross returned to the live stage after almost a decade's absence. The Neurotica-era line up of Jeff McDonald, Steven McDonald, Robert Hecker and Roy McDonald performed a career-spanning set at the REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney/Cal Arts Theater) at Disney Hall in Los Angeles. The band has subsequently gone on to play at the Azkena Festival in Spain, the Detour Festival in Los Angeles, give a performance of their entire first EP in honor of Rodney Bingenheimer's being awarded a star on Hollywood Boulevard, and a set consisting of the entire Born Innocent album opening for Sonic Youth (who performed Daydream Nation) at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. They toured Spain and England in January, 2007. They have played a number of one-off shows including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. In 2008 they played the Coachella Festival in Coachella, California; ATP vs Pitchfork festival in Sussex, England; and NXNE Festival in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nIn 2010, Redd Kross headlined the Turbo Rock Festival in Spain. In 2011, they headlined the POP Montreal Festival. Redd Kross toured Australia as part of the Hoodoo Gurus' 30th Anniversary on the \"Dig It Up\" Festival concert series. Jason Shapiro of the band Celebrity Skin played guitar, sitting in for Robert Hecker on these dates. Shapiro currently records and tours as the band's lead guitarist. Researching the Blues was released on Merge Records on August 7, 2012. They also put out a split single and performing with the Melvins on December 31, 2012, on Amphetamine Reptile Records. The band returned to Australia in March 2013, touring with Dinosaur Jr. In June 2015, their EP Teen Babes From Monsanto was reissued as a limited edition (250) full-length 12-inch vinyl record; it sold out in 24 hours.\n\nDale Crover is currently the touring drummer of the band during their 2017 tours supporting The Melvins. As of November 2017, Crover joined the band full-time and is Redd Kross' drummer. August 23, 2019 saw the release of the seventh album titled Beyond the Door on Merge Records. The albums included eight new songs and covers of \"The Party\" from Blake Edwards 1968 film of the same name written by Henry Mancini and a version of Sparks 90's dance hit, \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'\". The album featured appearances from Buzz Osborne, Gere Fennelly, and Josh Klinghoffer, and composing credits for Anna Waronker and Kim Shattuck. Also in 2019, Emmy Award-winning television comedy writer Andrew Reich, best known as an Executive Producer on Friends, was directing a documentary on the band called Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story.\n\nOFF! (2010 - 2021)[]\n\nOFF! was formed in Los Angeles, California in late 2009 by Circle Jerks/Black Flag singer Keith Morris, Burning Brides frontman Dimitri Coats, Redd Kross bassist Steven Shane McDonald, and Rocket From The Crypt/Hot Snakes/Earthless drummer Mario Rubalcaba. The idea to form the band came after Coats had worked as producer on a Circle Jerks album which fell apart.[2] During that time, Coats and Morris had written several songs together which they used to start this new band. Notably the band would be performing all new material and no songs by either The Circle Jerks or Black Flag.[3]\n\nThe group made its live debut at the 2010 South By Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas. Off!'s first Los Angeles show featured an original art installation by Raymond Pettibon at a downtown warehouse space.[4][5] Notably in 2010 OFF! would play sporadic shows, notably at FYF Fest, FunFunFun Fest, Amoeba Records and Generation Records, the latter recorded for a live 7\".[6]\n\nRecording songs in the Spring, the first release by OFF! is a 7\" vinyl EP called 1st EP, which debuted on 13 October 2010. That EP, along with three more EPs, would comprise the band's debut album, First Four EPs. First Four EPs would be released circa 14 December 2010 on CD, Cassette and as a four 7\" box set, all of which featuring artwork by Raymond Pettibon. Music videos for all four songs of the first EP would be composed to further promote the band. First Four EPs would attain critical acclaim from several publications from the likes of Pitchfork (8.5/10),[7] and Punknews (4.5/5)[8] to name a few, many critics citing the album as a fresh breath of air in the hardcore punk genre.\n\nOFF! would tour extensively throughout 2011 to support First Four EPs, beginning with short tours surrounding marquee appearances at SXSW, Coachella and NXNE among a string of dates with Henry Rolling and Dinosaur Jr. The band would tour Europe and Australia for the first time to further support the record. A Record Store Day exclusive 7\" entitled Live at Generation Records would be released in the Spring while Southern Lord Records would release a 7\" single in Compared To What on 3 May 2011.[9]\n\nWith enough material written for a new album, OFF! would record at Kingsize Soundlabs from 16 - 18 February 2012.[10][11] The eponymous OFF! would see release on 8 May 2012[12] to critical acclaim,[13][14][15] followed by extensive touring with the likes of Trash Talk, Refused, Negative Approach and Power Trip among marquee appearances at SXSW, FunFunFun Fest and The Power of The Riff. Several videos were filmed to promote the album, two of which featuring actor Jack Black.[16]\n\nNotably OFF! would tour Australia in early 2013 as part of Big Day Out, along with several dates supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers to some backlash, to which Morris would clarify in an interview that \"I’ve known Anthony since the beginning of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony and Flea are my friends and if I want to go out and play shows with some of my friends, I’m going to. I’ve been playing music for over 33 years, and I have some friends that are in extremely large bands. We could go out night after night and play to people who know who we are, and that’s all fan-fucking-tastic, but part of our job is to take it up a couple of notches. Those people may hate us, but maybe they’ll love us. There’s only one way to find out and that’s to do it.\" Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers has been one of Morris' friends for over 30 years (Morris at one point in the '80s filled in for Kiedis, who was off scoring drugs and missed his band's show) and is a huge fan and supporter of Off!. At every date on the Chili Peppers I'm with You World Tour, Kiedis has worn an Off! hat to promote the band. He has also sported the hat in some of the band's music videos.[17]\n\nA West Coast tour following Big Day Out would be planned that February with Negative Approach but would be canceled when Keith Morris would slip into a diabetic coma.[18] The band however would eventually bounce back for their first tour of South America later that year. Work would begin on a third studio album.\n\nRecording would begin on a third studio album between December 2013 and January 2014. The band recorded 19 songs at their rehearsal space to analog tape, leaving three off of the album.[19][20] Two of the songs would make up an exclusive Record Store Day 7\" in Learn To Obey.[21] The first song from this album, \"Void You Out\", was premiered by Rolling Stone on 22 January 2014.[22] A video for \"Hypnotized\" would also be released, starring David Yow (Scratch Acid, The Jesus Lizard). Premiering on The Billboard #67,[23] Wasted Years would see release on 8 April 2014 to generally positive reviews,[24][25][26] attaining a 74/100 score on Metacritic.[27]\n\nTo support Wasted Years OFF! would tour North America, followed by marquee appearances at Punk Rock Bowling, Burger Boogaloo and the band's first shows in Japan[28][29] and Mexico.[30] The band would notably tour that August with Dale Crover (Melvins) filling in on drums.[31] Crover would state that the time spent with the band would lead to Steven McDonald joining The Melvins in 2016 and in turn, Crover joining Redd Kross in 2018.[32]\n\nOFF! would tour in 2015 alongside Bad Religion, followed by an extensive European tour to further support Wasted Years.[33] The band performed more sporadic shows over the next few years as the respective members of the band remained busy with other projects, along with Keith Morris releasing a memoir in 2016.[34]\n\nOn 1 April 2019 OFF! would announce for an April Fools Day gag that Keith Morris was now the President of Kickstarter.[35] The same day a proper announcement would come for Watermelon, a sci-fi rockumentary depicting the band's breakup and reformation as time-traveling, crime-fighting superheroes with the band's fourth album serving as the soundtrack.[36] The band would announce that the film and album would be funded through Kickstarter, with a $175,000 goal featuring bonuses such as exclusive Raymond Pettibon prints and a concert filming in Los Angeles as part of the film's production, planned for 2020.[37][38] However the crowdfunding campaign would only reach roughly $151,000, falling short of the crowdfunded goal.[39]\n\nIn June of 2021 it would be announced that the band has a new rhythm section and plans to record the fourth studio album in July 2021, along with the Watermelon movie during the Circle Jerks tour. On 7 July 2021 OFF! would unveil their cover of \"Holier Than Thou\" by Metallica for the 53-band tribute album The Metallica Blacklist, along with a music video for the song starring David Yow. Along with this news the band would reveal a new rhythm section in bassist Autry Fulbright II (ex-...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead) and drummer Justin Brown (sideman for Thundercat, Esperanza Spalding). Lastly, the band would also sign with Fat Possum Records to re-issue their back catalog, along with continuing work on the fourth album and feature film.[40] In an interview with Stereogum, Keith Morris would explain the depatures of both Rubalcaba and McDonald, nothing that McDonald was fired due to friction between him and Dimitri Coats.[41][42]\n\nMelvins (2015 - Present)[]\n\nMcDonald would join Melvins in 2015 after meeting Dale Crover with OFF! and reconnecting with him. They will also be releasing Basses Loaded on June 3, 2016[43] which will feature a rotating cast of bass players including regulars Dale Crover (With Mike Dillard), Jared Warren (With Coady Willis), Jeff Pinkus and Trevor Dunn as well as Steven McDonald (of Redd Kross), and Krist Novoselic (of Nirvana). [44]\n\nIn 2016, The Melvins announced a tour (Savage Imperial Death March) with Melt-Banana and Napalm Death with Steven McDonald as their current bass player, along with a tour of Europe and a second tour of the United States in August/September with Helms Alee as direct support. The band would close 2016 with a string of shows alongside Redd Kross and OFF! (With Steven McDonald handling triple bass duties). The band would start 2017 with two shows opening for Sleep, Boner Records announcing re-issues of the solo EPs (With alternate art editions in the works via Amphetamine Reptile Records and a brand new solo EP in the works) and two more Melvins albums in the works.\n\nThe Melvins have two forthcoming studio albums in the works: One of which being a concept double album with McDonald on bass and the other being a studio album with Pinkus and McDonald on bass. On 6 April 2017 the band announced a 23-track double album entitled A Walk With Love and Death to be released on Ipecac on 7 July 2017. Featuring Steven McDonald on bass and a host of guests, The disc entitled \"Death\" will be a conventional Melvins album while \"Love\" will be the soundtrack score to a Jesse Nieminen directed, self-produced short.[45] An 80+ date North American tour would be announced alongside Spotlights and later a headlining spot at Desertfest Belgium. Some weeks later a full tour of Europe and Australia with Redd Kross was announced for the months of October and November, with Crover and McDonald performing with both bands.\n\nOn 12 February 2018, The Melvins would announce a brand new studio album released on 20 April entitled Pinkus Abortion Technician with a USA tour spanning through May and then July and August to follow.[46] A tour of Europe for that October and November was later announced as well. For the 2018 live shows the band would utilize both bassists. The Melvins would tour frequently in 2019, along with releasing several extended plays through Amphetamine Reptile Records.\n\nIn 21 July 2021 Melvins would announce a two-disc, four LP acoustic album entitled Five Legged Dog, featuring acoustic re-imaginings of songs spanning the band's whole career along with covers previously un-recorded by the band, a total of thirty-six tracks. Five Legged Dog would be set to be released on 15 October 2021 on digital and CD and in 2022 on vinyl.[47]\n\nOn 23 September 2021 it would be announced that The Melvins would tour with Corrosion of Conformity and Ministry in the Spring of 2022. The band would release a new EP entitled Lord of The Flies that January, with two songs set for the band's next album along with two covers. Notably one of the covers would be that of the Soundgarden song \"Spoonman\", featuring Matt Cameron (Soundgarden) as a guest second drummer. The band would record more material in the Summer of 2022, with Roy Mayorga (Ministry, Amebix, Stone Sour) as a guest. In July 2022 the band's next album Bad Mood Rising would be announced via AmRep, with an early August limited release via that label and a proper release later that month.\n\nIn 2023 Melvins would celebrate their fortieth anniversary. The first release the band would put out would be The Devil You Knew, The Devil You Know, a compilation LP that has the original Six Songs from 1986 along with re-recordings of all six songs in 2023. Following a West coast tour with Mr. Bungle, The Melvins would tour Europe for the first time since 2018 and also announce a tour with Boris entitled Twins of Evil. On this tour Boris would be performing Heavy Rocks in it's entirety while Melvins would be performing Bullhead and other songs.[48] McDonald also played on a collaborative release with Helms Alee entitled Controlling Data For a Better Feeling Future.\n\nOther Endeavors[]\n\nAs the Tater Totz, the McDonalds teamed with Pat Fear of White Flag and Michael Quercio from The Three O'Clock and released Alien Sleestaks from Brazil, the title a tribute to the series Land of the Lost. Another cover collection, it included songs originally by Queen and Yoko Ono, and featured a cover of The Beatles' \"I've Just Seen a Face\" with lead vocals by guest Danny Bonaduce. The second Tater Totz album, Sgt. Shonen's Exploding Plastic Eastman Band Request Mono! Stereo, was released in 1989, and included Cherie Currie of The Runaways, and Pat Smear. A third Tater Totz album was released called Tater Comes Alive. A side project, Anarchy 6 had two releases, Hardcore Lives! and a cassette-only album Live Like a Suicidal, and was featured in Lovedolls Superstar.\n\nSteve McDonald fronted the hardcore punk parody band Anarchy 6, which included three members from Sin 34, Mike Glass (guitar), Phil Newman (bass), and Dave Markey (drums). Using the pseudonyms Chemical Warfare (McDonald), Spike Geek (Glass), HC Skinner (Marmon), and Mark Davey (Markey), they released the studio album Hardcore Lives! in 1988, and a live album with cover songs Live Like a Suicide 1990.\n\nThe McDonald brothers collaborated with Astrid McDonald (Jeff's daughter with Charlotte Caffey, guitarist for The Go-Go's) and Anna Waronker (Steve's wife, frontwoman of That Dog) on a side project. Performing as Ze Malibu Kids, they released the album Sound It Out in 2002.\n\nMcDonald produced an album by The Format, Dog Problems, on which he played bass and sang backup vocals on a few tracks. He later produced, engineered, and mixed fun.'s debut album, Aim and Ignite, as well as performing as a bassist and backup vocalist on some of the songs. He was also one of the various band members on the original Tenacious D album, along with Dave Grohl; keyboardist Page McConnell of Phish; guitarist Warren Fitzgerald with band frontmen Jack Black and Kyle Gass. He appeared with Tenacious D on MADtv playing \"Lee\" and \"Tribute\". McDonald also featured briefly on bass in Kyle Gass' side-project Trainwreck in 2002 and 2003, under the pseudonym \"Slim Watkins\", before being succeeded by John Spiker.\n\nIn the summer of 2002 he became so excited about The White Stripes' new album, White Blood Cells, that he recorded bass lines to two songs of the typically bass-less duo's work. The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly and other outlets reported on it and due to overwhelming demand he added bass to all of the songs, posted the new creation online, and allowed people to download the tracks for free. He called it an art project named Redd Blood Cells which reached a peak of 60,000 downloads in a single day, causing the server to crash from the traffic.\n\nIn 2006, MacDonald joined Sparks on tour in support of their album Hello Young Lovers.\n\nBands[]\n\nRedd Kross - Bass, Vocals (1979 - 1997, 2004 - Present)\n\nTater Totz - Bass, Vocals (1987 - ?)\n\nAnarchy 6 - Bass (1987 - ?)\n\nRevolution 409 - Bass, Vocals (1988)\n\nZe Malibu Kids - Bass, Vocals (early 2000s)\n\nSparks - Bass (2006 - ?)\n\nOFF! - Bass (2010 - 2021)\n\nMelvins - Bass, Vocals (2015 - Present)\n\nDale Crover Band - Bass, Vocals (2016 - Present)\n\nSelected Discography[]\n\nWith Redd Kross[]\n\nRed Cross (EP) (1980, Posh Boy)\n\nBorn Innocent (Studio Album) (1982, Smoke 7 / Frontier)\n\nTeen Babes From Monsanto (EP) (1984, Gasatanka)\n\nNeurotica (Studio Album) (1987, Big Time)\n\nThird Eye (Studio Album) (1990, Atlantic)\n\n2500 Redd Kross Fans Can't Be Wrong (EP) (1993, Sympathy For The Record Industry)\n\nPhaseshifter (Studio Album) (1993, This Way Up)\n\nShow World (Studio Album) (1997, Mercury; This Way Up)\n\nResearching The Blues (Studio Album) (2012, Merge)\n\nBeyond The Door (Studio Album) (2019, Merge)\n\nWith Tater Totz[]\n\nAlien Sleestacks From Brazil (Unfinished Music Volume 3) (Studio Album) (1988, Giant Records; Gasatanka)\n\nMono!
