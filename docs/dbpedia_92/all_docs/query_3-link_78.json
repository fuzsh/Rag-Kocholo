Loesser’s form, in Where’s Charley? and Guys and Dolls, was musical comedy. But he wrote his next piece, The Most Happy Fella, as an opera. True, much of it conformed to the practices of musical comedy, for example in the hoot-and-holler dance number “Big D” and the use of spoken dialogue. However, the romantic portions of the score were extremely lyrical, even ecstatic, and some of the ensemble writing surpassed even the standards of operetta. Then, too, the overture was no song medley but a prelude of leitmotifs, so volatile that it jumps from Allegro giocoso (“joyous”) to Moderato e misterioso to Largamente (“grandiose”) to Allegro and so on every few measures, as if only the most expansive composition could prepare the public—not merely to see a show but to listen to it. Then the curtain rose on a restaurant at closing time. The music is marked Dolente (“pained”), but it is actually rather noncommittal in tone, strangely unevocative after, say, Oklahoma!’s tiny tone poem of dawn on the prairie or Wonderful Town’s orchestral tweaking of a thirties piano riff. But then a vamp breaks in, Pesante (“Heavy”), in brisk 4/4: grumpy and resentful, the very sound of endless trudging under the weight of laden trays. A waitress takes stage for the evening’s first vocal, “Ooh! My Feet!,” sarcastic and almost bitter yet, in its gamy honesty, likable. This is Cleo, the sidekick of the heroine, Amy (who is called “Rosabella” till one spoken line before the show’s finale). A customer Amy can’t recall has left a note and a bit of jewelry for her—object: matrimony—and, after a longish musical scene with Cleo made of dialogue and arioso mixed together, Amy gets the Heroine’s Wanting Song, “Somebody, Somewhere.” It aches with vulnerability, not only in the lyrics but also in the hesitantly soaring music. Partway through it, Amy moves downstage, the traveler curtain closes behind her, and stagehands rush in to clear the restaurant set for the show’s first full-stage location and the title song. Now we meet ( ix )\n\n( x )\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmy’s secret admirer, Tony, who is not the shy young man she has imagined but a much older specimen, ebullient and generous at Tempo di Tarentella but, we sadly realize, too unattractive physically for a love plot. Thus, three songs into the narrative, we are caught up in a worrisome conflict, not least because Amy and Tony have been musically presented to us as appealing personalities. The next number, “Standing on the Corner,” brings out the musical-comedy Loesser and introduces Cleo’s incipient mate, Herman. “Saturday,” he sings, disarmingly, “and I’m so broke”: so he and his buddies hang out and cruise instead of dating. The number is almost pure pop, easy listening in its close-harmony quartet—but Herman’s solo sections give us, once again, a character in the tune as well as in the words: affable and eternally optimistic, a soft target for the others to pick on. As two girls pass by, Herman and Clem pointedly look them over, and Clem then tells Herman, “Yours was awful!” A plot point: Amy has sent Tony her picture, and he must send his in return. She won’t like what she sees, he fears, and now Loesser sings his fifth principal to us—Joe, Tony’s foreman, a friendly hunk with, nevertheless, “something cold and possibly brutal,” as Loesser warns in the stage directions, “behind the smile in his eyes.” Tony is going to send Amy Joe’s picture, turning his courtship into a fraud—but we don’t know that yet. All Loesser gives us is “Joey, Joey, Joey,” Joe’s own particular Wanting Song, scored with slithery, unstable harp and celesta runs. The music is sensitive yet dominating: beautiful and disturbing, like Joe himself. And so Loesser concludes his chain of establishing numbers. Now we know everyone in the story, what he or she needs or is capable of. This is what the American musical had been working up to for some one hundred years, and all its artistry dwells in the historian’s key buzz term “integrated”: the union of story and score. Once a mere collection of songs and now a pride of fully developed numbers supported by incidental music, intros and development sections, and musical scenes mixed of speech and song, the score not only tells but probes the story, above all unveiling its characters. As we’ll see, there were integrated American shows around the turn of the twentieth century—Robin Hood, El Capitan, The Prince of Pilsen, The Red Mill. Yet the business model continued to tolerate specialty material to spotlight performers and extramural interpolations to humiliate the evening’s designated authors. Even Show Boat, more or less officially America’s first great musical, in 1927, includes specialties and interpolations. Still, when Show Boat was integrated it was very integrated, and the practice of integration was already catching on. The Student Prince and The Desert Song, directly preceding Show Boat, are absolutely integrated shows . . . in their scores. For the historian recognizes other aspects of integration—of dance as a thematic and psychological\n\nIntroduction\n\n( xi )\n\ninstrument, experimental in the 1930s and fully executed in Oklahoma! in 1943; of production style, introduced in Allegro and Love Life in the late 1940s and revisited in Cabaret and Company a generation later. Much of this may seem like ancient history to some readers. But I was there for a good deal of it, and I vividly remember certain bits of staging that one cannot glean from surviving documents. When very young, I memorized a show’s score through its cast recording and became so intimate with its continuity that I could so to say photograph the stage action in my mind when I saw the play itself. I still remember being startled when the original Most Happy Fella Cleo, Susan Johnson, sang, about her littlest toe, “the big son-of-a-bitch hurts the most!,” because on the disc she left out the no-no term. Years later, interviewing Agnes de Mille for a book on Rodgers and Hammerstein, I found her wary—her relationship with them soured on Allegro—but I won her confidence by recounting, second by second, the opening sequence of one of her later shows, Goldilocks: how the curtain rose on a theatre exterior that then broke into halves sailing off into the right and left wings to reveal the Boys and Girls paired off and, upstage, Elaine Stritch sitting on a moon. Mollified (actually, I think she was a little shocked), de Mille grew voluble. So there is more to “research” than ransacking the archives. As other interviews for the Rodgers and Hammerstein book revealed, one quickly learns who Knows Stuff and who is carving a graven image of himself or has no memory function. The dowager empress Dorothy Rodgers didn’t know stuff: her relationship with her husband’s career comprised no more than attending the premieres with him. But Stephen Sondheim knew plenty; better, he knew Oscar Hammerstein. John Fearnley, a Rodgers and Hammerstein production associate, was rich in recollection about putting on and even writing the shows. Jamie Hammerstein, Oscar’s younger son, assisted on and thus knew much about Flower Drum Song. But more: he revealed that his father complained that, in the 1930s and 1940s, organizations were constantly springing up, recruiting Names for their advisory board. These outfits invariably claimed to be politically progressive, but many were communist fronts and even those that weren’t were simply drains on Oscar’s concentration time for his work. It was the reason he wrote Allegro—to show how life in the Great World lures a man away from his purpose on earth. Such insights from those who were in one way or another part of the history obviously help fill out the chronicle. Further, Ted Chapin of the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization gave me access to material relating to the early composition of such works as Show Boat and The King and I; seeing what the authors rejected brings one closer to what they discovered about a show as they felt their way into it.\n\n( xii )\n\nIntroduction\n\nI should mention as well the unique figure of the gay mentor, who in my case were former chorus boys and stage managers who carried with them a treasury of anecdotes and recollections and were glad of a new audience for them. My descriptions of shows that precede my own theatregoing owe everything to them, for, make no mistake, the chorus people have a larger perspective on a show than the leading players do, distracted as they are by the demands of their parts. And no one knows a show like its stage manager. Elaine Steinbeck, for example, had a story about Oklahoma! Eventually John Steinbeck’s wife, she was in 1943 Elaine Anderson, one of Oklahoma!’s stage managers; the story finds her at a Saturday rehearsal when, for the first time, director Rouben Mamoulian and choreographer Agnes de Mille decided to “put Act One together.” In those days, musicals were cast with separate singing and dancing choruses, to be combined on stage to appear more or less versatile, though in fact the singers sang (and moved a little) and the dancers danced (and lip-synched or so). They rehearsed separately, the singers and principals with the director and the dancers with the choreographer, each squad unaware of what the other squad would be doing. Of course, at some point early on, the two “halves” of the production would be brought together, and this was the day. Keep in mind that, while Oklahoma! proved to be a unique and influential piece after it opened, at this point the cast thought of it simply as an unusual show (because of its frontier setting and dialect) with wonderful songs. De Mille’s dancers scarcely even knew what the plot was about. So, when Will Parker followed the “Kansas City” vocal by showing off the new two-step—“the waltz is through,” he announces. “Ketch on to it?”— and the watching cowboys joined in, the cast saw something more than a dance. Oklahoma! looks in on a community in transition, its tribal folkways to be suppressed in favor of statehood and membership in an ethnically diverse nation. The Oklahomans’ world will change, and “Kansas City” illustrates this as much in dance as in song. A bit later came the heroine’s feminist anthem, “Many a New Day,” and its follow-up dance, a mixture of caprice and tenderness, expressing in movement what lyrics and music cannot. As Mamoulian and de Mille ran the rehearsal, Elaine noticed how astonished the performers had become. What marvelous experiment had they fallen into? Oklahoma! was more than unusual: enlightening. Even at this early stage, in a bare room to an upright piano, it was unmistakable that Oklahoma! was going to make fabulous theatrical history. Hammerstein was in the country that weekend, but Rodgers was in town, at home, and Elaine ran to a telephone, rang him up, and said, “You better get down here quick.”\n\nw\n\nPA R T ON E\n\nThe First Age\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nw\n\nCHAPTER \n\nSource Material\n\nT\n\nhe first musical was The Beggar’s Opera, produced in the theatre at Lincoln’s Inn Fields in London, in 1728. To give the work modern billing, its book and lyrics were by John Gay and its music was by Johann Christian Pepusch. Or, more precisely, either Gay or Pepusch selected sixty-nine popular airs of the day and Gay fitted to them new words to express his characters’ thoughts, to develop atmosphere, or even to advance plot action. Perhaps because the script continuously slips in and out of mostly very short vocals, Gay at first wanted the actors to sing without accompaniment, but in the end Pepusch gave them instrumental backing, becoming the first orchestrator in the musical’s history. Or was The Beggar’s Opera the very first? It was certainly the first lasting success in its form, ballad opera. There had been light musical-theatre pieces before 1728, but not till ballad opera can we speak of works like unto what we think of as a musical: an enacted story bearing some relationship with our daily life and “lifted” by songs that belong to the story. Gay’s intention was to satirize the Italian opera that had monopolized the interest of London’s trend setters. This mode of the moment, the opera seria of the émigré George Frideric Handel, treated the amorous and political intrigues of nobles in exotic places: crusaders, sorceresses, the high hats of Greek mythology. John Gay’s “opera” reversed the terms. In place of heroes: criminals. In place of arias in Italian: ditties in English. Opera seria delighted in the rivalry of princes: Gay’s protagonist is Macheath, a bandit, and his rival is the underworld boss Peachum (a pun on “Peach ’em,” meaning “Turn the felons in for the forty-pounds-a-head reward”).\n\n()\n\n()\n\nThe First Age\n\nRiffraff! Opera seria featured triangle love plots, again among the courtly; Gay offered Peachum’s daughter, Polly, and the daughter of the keeper of Newgate Prison, Lucy Lockit—both wives of Macheath, who has at least six that we know of. To the tune of “Oh, London Is a Fine Town,” Gay wrote “Our Polly Is a Sad Slut!,” and, when the two women meet in confrontation, “Good-morrow, gossip Joan” turns into Polly’s “Why how now, Madam Flirt,” to which Lucy replies, “Why, how now, saucy Jade; Sure the Wench is Tipsy!” Theatre historian Simon Trussler likens The Beggar’s Opera to a print by Hogarth: “so rich in incident, interpolation, and low-life impropriety as to upset conventional expectations of dramatic art, but . . . thought-provoking in its simultaneous likeness and unlikeness to life.” Above all, The Beggar’s Opera is a remarkably consistent work; as we’ll see, many musicals before, say, the 1890s were if anything superb in their lack of consistency, especially in America. Minutes before The Beggar’s Opera’s final curtain, with Macheath about to be hanged, two members of the company come forth to debate this dire conclusion in a piece determined to be popular: PLAYER: The Catastrophe is manifestly wrong, for an Opera must end happily. BEGGAR: Your Objection, Sir, is very just; and is easily remov’d . . . in this kind of Drama [i.e., in Handelian opera], ’tis no matter how absurdly things are brought about. —So—you Rabble there—run and cry a Reprieve. . . . PLAYER: All this we must do, to comply with the Taste of the Town. The Beggar’s Opera tickled London, to put it mildly. It played 62 performances in its first season, unprecedented for the age, and all but commanded imitation. Benjamin Britten scholar Eric Walter White noted that “at least 120 ballad operas were produced during the period 1728–38.” But ballad opera began to evolve. Inevitably, musicians would realize personal cachet in composing rather than arranging and in constructing musical scenes instead of a chain of songlets. This leads us to the so-called Savoy Operas of Arthur Sullivan and W. S. Gilbert, which appeared over a quarter of a century, from 1871 to 1896.* These comprise, almost inarguably, the most influential suite of musicals the English-speaking world was to know for seventy years, till the age\n\n* “Savoy” denotes the theatre built for their production, in 1881.\n\nS O U R C E M AT E R I A L\n\n\n\nof Rodgers and Hammerstein and, after, Sondheim-Prince. One notes traces of The Beggar’s Opera in Gilbert and Sullivan, in the satiric tone and the close relationship between script and score. Further, the music in both really suits the characters. Just as Polly and Mrs. Peachum duet, in “O Polly, You Might Have Toy’d and Kist,” in tones of mother and daughter, the one forgiving and the other beseeching, so does, for instance, Sullivan’s setting of the Mikado’s “My Object All Sublime” mark him as ponderously implacable. Yes, it’s in the words. But the number’s relentlessly marching rhythm intensifies their meaning, with a jumpy little vamp that suggests how eagerly this ogre looks forward to his next grisly exaction of justice. Thus, the composer is a dramatist, even if The Beggar’s Opera’s “composer” was a miscellany of prefabricated melodies. At that, it is worth pointing out that Gay’s lyrics are very much in character for his various principals, an amazing achievement considering that the profession of lyricist for the popular stage did not truly exist till Gay invented it. Opera had librettists, of course—poets more often than not. But keying popular music into character songs started with The Beggar’s Opera; even Gilbert didn’t specify his characters’ lyrics as keenly as Gay did his. True, Gilbert’s wit is a summoning concept in the musical’s history; in his own way, he has never been outdone. Still, many of his people sound like each other—or, rather, they all sound like Gilbert. Nevertheless, the Savoy titles are highly evolved from ballad opera, most particularly in grander musical structures. They usually start with a chorus featuring one or the other gender—HMS Pinafore’s men in “We Sail the Ocean Blue” or Patience’s “Twenty Love-sick Maidens We”—then build through the first act to a bustling finale full of many distinct parts. Further, the chorus work is crucial to the action, whether gondoliers, bridesmaids, or even ghosts. The vocal demands on nearly all the principals are well-nigh operatic, whereas actors can fake their way through some of The Beggar’s Opera’s roles, even Macheath, which has been played by such non-musical actors as Michael Redgrave and (on film) Laurence Olivier. In 1871—again, the very year in which Gilbert and Sullivan launched their partnership, with the now mostly lost Thespis—Gilbert made an English translation of Jacques Offenbach’s Les Brigands (The Bandits, 1869). It was not performed (either in London or New York) until 1889, but it suggests an early link between English “comic opera” and Offenbach’s form, which he dubbed “opéra bouffe,” a French translation of the Italian opera buffa (literally, “comic opera”). However, opéra bouffe is nothing like opera buffa. Nor is it like French opéra comique, a genre that varied in style from era to era but was never in any real sense comic. “It is impossible,” says critic Martin Cooper, “to find any English translation [for] the term opéra comique.\n\n()\n\nThe First Age\n\n‘Comic opera’ suggests something quite different.” Indeed, a popular confusion mistakes the French comédie as meaning “comedy” only, when it in fact means “drama” generally.* The difference between opera and opéra comique is not that one is serious and the other comic but that opéra is purely musical and opéra comique a dramatic work with music.† Yes, opéra comique, depending on the era, might include a comic part, usually the Ridiculous Servant. In André Grétry’s “beauty and the beast” piece Zémire et Azor (1771), the menial Ali dithers in fear or nods off when he is needed, and that may have been amusing enough for the age—but his music is just like that of everyone else in the work, devoid of comic character. Later, in the early 1800s, an outstanding opéra comique like La Dame Blanche emphasizes the sentimental and mysterious, but still there is no comic content. And yet, after John Gay’s deliriously wicked jesting in ballad opera, is there nothing in French music theatre before Offenbach that can truly be called funny? Fun is the soul of musical comedy—and there is an Exhibit A, Jean-Philippe Rameau’s comédie-ballet Platée (1745). Here, at least, is an overtly absurd plotline: a benighted though harmless swamp monster believes herself beloved of Jupiter. In the fashion of bygone times, the work has a lot of fun at the expense of this mythical cocktail waitress to the stars, and ends by flattening her self-esteem as if she were a villain. Rameau, an extremely resourceful composer, does place some musical silliness here and there, such as animal sounds, from frogs to donkeys. Even so, not till our own times, in a 2002 staging by Laurent Pelly at the Paris Opéra, could Platée emerge as a funny piece, at that entirely through Pelly’s ingenious interpretations of ancient operatic usages. Setting the action entirely in a theatre-within-the-theatre, Pelly crazed everyone up: Mercure was all silver, from shoes to hair glitter, and the diva La Folie wore a gown made of music sheets. In her solo showpiece, she enjoyed a particular note of such round and golden tone that she signaled the conductor, Marc Minkowski,\n\n* Thus the name of the French National Theatre, the Comédiie-Française, not a house of comedy per se. This usage applies to Romance languages in general. In Italian, the chief of a theatre troupe is the capocomico, and Dante’s Divina Commedia is not a jokebook, but a poetic “drama” about the afterlife. † The famous difference between the two—that opéra has recitative (in effect, “sung” dialogue) and opéra comique speech between the numbers—is a generic technicality of no importance. Opéra had the more glamorous voices, with characters drawn from the leadership class, striving for glory. Opéra comique, for less imposing voices, dealt with middle-class or peasant characters striving for love. Thus, Gounod’s Faust, originally an opéra comique (1859), was revised as a grand opera (1869)—for a number of reasons but, really, because its subject, drawn from one of Western Civilization’s most exalted classics, was too vast for the smaller form.\n\nS O U R C E M AT E R I A L\n\n\n\nnot to interfere even as he tapped his watch (though he did blow her a kiss when it was over). Or: Act Three couldn’t begin till a frog, sitting in a stage box, signaled Minkowski to get going. All this creates a marvelous show without the slightest editing of what Rameau wrote. Still, it derives from Pelly’s imaginative responses to the music and not from the music itself. Platée as written is droll, just as The Beggar’s Opera is scathing in the thrust-and-parry style of Restoration comedy and Gilbert and Sullivan is occasionally biting but more often simply whimsical. But Offenbach is zany: in his music. For the first time, the uproarious and sexy and even transgressive attitudes that identify the musical throughout its various ages move into the voices and pit—yodeling, crazy “wrong” notes, tone-deaf bands, vocal evocations of a train trip, a blizzard, kissing. Any composer would call up a military march when warriors tread the stage; Offenbach was the first to concoct goofy ones. Above all, it was Offenbach who instituted pastiche composition and the quoting of other composers as essential to the very sound of a musical. He loved Spanish characters, because Spaniards sing boleros, and of course Germans supply the yodeling. If no Germans are handy, anyone can yodel, as the tenor Paris does in La Belle Hélène (1864), to evoke a Bacchic air as he abducts Helen. In Offenbach’s upside-down world, the two leads in Orphée et Euridice (1858) torture each other sadomasochistically. They gleefully reveal adulterous liaisons—and, boy, does she hate his music. “Mercy!” she cries, when he launches his “latest concerto”—and, he gloats, “It lasts an hour and a quarter.” And he proceeds to fiddle it: a sugary, droopy thing, pretty if you like to hear salon music and grotesque if you’d rather die— which, of course, Euridice eventually does. Thus Offenbach overturns the rules for decorum and beauty in art and for, above all, a reverence for the classics. “No more nectar!” the gods cry in the same work, during a Mt. Olympus uprising. “This regime is boring!” When Jupiter’s thunder fails to faze them, he asks, “What about morality?” Morality? From him? One by one, Diana, Venus, and Cupid review his erotic capers in music that has the uncanny sound of children blackmailing a grownup. With its mincing little steps and hip-swivelling after-phrase, it is infantile yet knowing, the wagging finger of your comeuppance. There simply hadn’t been music like this before. Now, isn’t this Simon Trussler’s aforementioned “simultaneous likeness and unlikeness to life”? It’s the transformation of believable human behavior into exaggeration and fantasy. And that will prove to be the sine qua non of the American musical in its Golden Age—Of Thee I Sing, Du Barry Was a Lady, On the Town, Finian’s Rainbow, Guys and Dolls, Hello, Dolly!..\n\n()\n\nThe First Age\n\nOffenbach’s use of pastiche was especially influential, giving the American musical a variety of texture and a wealth of “meanings” not found in comparable genres of other cultures. It keeps the musical fresh, mischievous, adaptable. When Victor Herbert defines his Italian heroine (naughty) Marietta with the ebullient “Italian Street Song,” or when John Kander gives Chicago’s prison matron a Sophie Tucker number in “When You’re Good To Mama,” they expand their soundscape while referencing memes that help the audience place the character more or less instantly. We get it: Marietta has brought to the French America of New Orleans the zest of Italian life; the matron is tolerant of the appetites of the human condition, especially her own. Pastiche takes many forms. Sometimes the music toys with a spoofy citation, as when George M. Cohan quotes “Yankee Doodle” in “The Yankee Doodle Boy”; when Cole Porter unveils another of his parody country-western numbers (as in “Friendship”); when The Pajama Game sets a scene in a place called Hernando’s Hideaway just so it can program a Latin number because Latin numbers were trending at the time; or when orchestrator Jonathan Tunick studs A Little Night Music’s “A Weekend in the Country” with a quotation of the first seven notes of Richard Strauss’ Der Rosenkavalier: the most romantic of operas gracing the most romantic of musicals. And note how vigorously My Fair Lady pursues this use of styles to capture Edwardian England. The clash of social orders that informs the action is given voice when Doolittle’s “With a Little Bit Of Luck” and “Get Me To the Church On Time” brawl with the impeccably ducal languor of the “Ascot Gavotte” and the sheer whirling richness of the “Embassy Waltz.” Doolittle is music hall, rough and rash: honest. The fine folk sing en masque but dance with abandon, as if they can be honest only in a ballroom, where no outsider can see. Then too, “The Rain in Spain” executes a musical pun in a Tempo di Habanera that breaks into a jota for the ensuing dance, for the age’s social cautions are so rife that Eliza and her two protectors can bond only in music so “foreign” that it protects them from their own intimacy. Similarly, the narrative about the interfering Zoltan Karpathy in “You Did It” rings in Lisztian Hungarian Rhapsody, right down to a spiccato violin solo and outright quotation, isolating Karpathy as not a Hungarian but a schemer, a villain, a creature outside the community of musicals, where opposites like Eliza and Henry Higgins meet cute, wage war, and fall in love. This musical imagery extends to even a quotation of “London Bridge Is Falling Down,” in the strange little buskers’ dance that opens the show. Why? To sound out the show’s title: “My fair lady!” Gilbert and Sullivan had no rivals; is the same true of Offenbach? There was—to a very limited extent—one, Florimond Ronger. Working\n\nS O U R C E M AT E R I A L\n\n\n\nmononymously as Hervé, this composer-librettist-performer launched his career a bit before Offenbach, who in any case had emigrated from Cologne, Germany, at the age of fourteen in 1833 and thus had some assimilating to do before he could compete in the French music world. Hervé’s huge list of works begins in 1842, but Offenbach quickly overtook him, especially once he gave up one-acts for full-length works, some of which comprise the very center of the French repertory in the musical: Barbe-Bleue (Bluebeard, 1866), La Vie Parisienne (Parisian Life, 1866), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867), La Périchole (1868), the aforementioned Les Brigands, La Fille du Tambour-Major (The Drum-Major’s Daughter, 1879), as well as the two just cited. In the end, Hervé became an Offenbach imitator himself, for his rudimentary compositional style was not able to host his sense of humor: Hervé’s fun lay entirely in his words. His history spoof Chillpéric (1868) even bears Offenbach’s unique generic designation as an opéra bouffe and appropriates Offenbach’s typical parodies of grand opera, especially its most dogged convention, the Grand Duo (here for King Chilpéric and his light of love, Frédégonde, both out of authentic sixth-century chronicle), with its restless changes of tempo culminating in a Big Tune. (Hervé sets it to an Offenbachian cancan.) Hervé’s Le Petit Faust (1869), a spoof of Goethe, borrows Offenbachian casting, with its “ténor comique” as Faust, its “Trial” (after the so to say “talksinging” comedian Antoine Trial), as Valentin, and its trousered soprano, a “chanteuse légère,” as the Devil. It’s not that Hervé’s music is completely artless; his Faust’s second-act prelude contains a tiny concerto for flute and orchestra, and the act then opens in a clever mockup of Gounod’s Faust’s Kermesse choruses. Nevertheless, Hervé was no Offenbach, and no one else has been to this day. Most important, Offenbach’s genius forced him to extend the boundaries of opéra bouffe. At various times, he wrote on the grand scale, including one out-and-out opera in the fashionable vein of the nature-and-magic adventure, Die Rheinnixen (The Fairies of the Rhine, 1864), for Vienna. However, his masterpiece, unfinished at his death (at the age of sixty-one, in 1880), was a kind of exalted opéra bouffe, satiric, touching, and eerie all at once: Les Contes d’Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann, 1881). Ostensibly a review of a poet’s doomed loves, the work in fact demonstrates the artist’s isolation in a world run by occult, disruptive forces. It was too intimate to be a grand opera, too crazy and experimental to be an opéra comique, and too romantic to be an opéra bouffe: an unprecedentedly rich work, billed as an opéra fantastique. Because Hoffmann was thrown together after Offenbach’s death in a corrupt and simplified version, and because much of Hoffmann’s most glorious music was lost till relatively recently, we are finally realizing that it is not only one\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nof the unique inventions but also the exhibition piece in how the popular lyric stage—the musical—is infinitely protean, inspiring its practitioners to effect genre breakouts. They expand their musical structures, twist the fun show into the serious show without losing the fun, reinvent the purpose of the musical: Show Boat, Cabaret, Follies. And note that all three of these paradigmatic classics deal heavily in pastiche or quotation, from Show Boat’s black spiritual through Cabaret’s “suggestion without imitation” of Weimar Berlin to Follies’ retrospective of the Songs They Don’t Write Any More. Call it the audacity of talent. When Gilbert and Sullivan and Offenbach simultaneously take hold of American stages in the back third of the nineteenth century, their influence on the musical becomes, quite simply, tremendous. We know this because it was only after exposure to the European musical that the American form began to favor full-length story scores: the very basis of the musical as we know it today. Before the European invasion, the American musical comprised primitive forms enjoying relatively little artistic development—the minstrel show, for instance, dominant in the nineteenth century’s middle third and moribund in most theatre capitals by the 1890s (though minstrel troupes toured successfully into the early 1900s). George M. Cohan twice tried to revive the form on Broadway, in 1908 and 1909. Both tries failed—yet Ziegfeld Follies of 1919 featured a star-filled tab minstrel show for its first-act finale that proved the highlight of everyone’s favorite Follies, and the trope of actors made up in blackface, hymning the supposed joys of plantation life, sneaked into Hollywood musicals in the 1930s and 1940s. The stage, too, has never quite given it up: in the finale of Kurt Weill and Alan Jay Lerner’s Love Life, in Charlemagne’s war council in Pippin, even providing the staging concept for the recent Kander and Ebb show The Scottsboro Boys. These sometimes scathing resuscitations use minstrelsy intellectually; in the 1800s, it was simply a way of creating musicals without full-scale stories. These were variety shows, made of songs, dances, and jokes united by subject matter—black life and love in the southland—and performed by not only whites but (till the 1870s) by men only. Thomas D. Rice is credited with the inspiration for the iconic black character in a song-and-dance medium. Yet it was Dan Emmett, the composer of the first more-or-less hit songs in this field (including “Blue Tail Fly” and the very anthem of minstrelsy, “Dixie”) who directed in 1843 the first quartet billed as the Virginia Minstrels: the first minstrel show. “If Rice was father of the American minstrel,” says historian Julian Mates, “then Emmett was father of the American minstrel show.” The quartet expanded, and the “burnt cork” makeup and outlandish costuming of colorful “finery” or tailcoats with shirt collars hitting the ears became essential. From a single act, the minstrel show grew to three. The\n\nS O U R C E M AT E R I A L\n\n  \n\nFirst Part, as it was called, remained the key event: a semi-circle of men backing up, at center stage, the Interlocutor and, at the sides, the two endmen. These were Mr. Bones (playing two semi-attached bone-like substances producing a castanet crackle) and Mr. Tambo (on the tambourine). “Gentlemen,” cried the Interlocutor at the start, “be seated!” He then announced the numbers and worked the jokes with the endmen, all in stagesouthern dialect, repeating the set-up lines so the public wouldn’t miss the punchline. The jokes were traditional, often virtually pointless. On an early Victor 78 treating a miniature First Part, Mr. Tambo tells of an uncle so mean he won’t feed his chickens. “Won’t feed the chickens?” the Interlocutor repeats. Yes, and one poor hen was reduced to eating sawdust and shavings at the saw mill. “Sawdust and shavings?” the Interlocutor cries, because apparently the audience hasn’t yet turned on their hearing aids. Yes, and then she laid a dozen eggs. And when they hatched, “Eleven of them had wooden legs and the other was a woodchuck!” Which is immediately followed by hideous yawk-yawk laughter from everyone on stage and percussive punctuation from the Messrs. Tambo and Bones. The Second Part, known as the “olio,” was a variety show made of anything from song and dance spots to crazy novelty acts by the entertainment industry’s outliers—playing tunes on glassware filled with contrasting levels of water, say, or barnyard imitations. One thing the public could count on was the “stump speech,” modeled on the politician’s pompous rhetoric but filled with doubletalk, allusions to everything from the Bible to the latest scandal, and aimless fill-in phrases such as “due to de obvimous fact dat,” which merrily led from one topic to another without a blip of continuity. “Usually given by one of the endmen,” says minstrelsy historian Robert C. Toll, the stump speech “was a discourse as much on the infinite possibilities for malaprops [sic] as the chosen subject.” These flights of eloquent gibberish were rendered with acrobatic flash, often culminating in the speaker’s crashing off the podium to the floor. Toll pinpoints a modern practitioner of this lost art in the actor and recurring Johnny Carson television talk-show guest “Professor” Irwin Corey, so a few of my readers may actually have seen the very last of the stump speakers, albeit without the blackface makeup and fake southern dialect. The Third Part brought forth a playlet supporting more song spots, reserved in particular for the Old Favorites, perhaps “My Dusky Rose,” a ballad fit for close harmony; a sentimental piece such as Stephen Foster’s “Old Folks At Home”; or a fast choral number like “Climb Up, Ye Chillun,\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nClimb.” Sometimes the Third Part offered a spoof of some literary or dramatic work (especially Uncle Tom’s Cabin), anticipating the form of burlesque, which itself led (under the tutelage of Gilbert and Sullivan and Offenbach) to American musical comedy. This places minstrelsy’s Third Part as one of the musical’s founding outfits. Thus, an entertainment machine was run on just a few moving parts, and as time went on, rival companies outdid one another, particularly in size. John H. Haverly, the manager who dominated the minstrel scene in the 1880s with over a dozen different troupes touring the nation, introduced the monster minstrel show in Haverly’s Mastodon Minstrels. Here was where a deathless show-biz advertising idiom was introduced, in Haverly’s “40, Count ’Em, 40!”: the number of his “stars.” “The minstrel show was the backbone of American popular entertainment for over half a century,” says Julian Mates. Further, it was at first the only American form that really was a musical—that is, it blended singing and “acting” into a relatively unified whole. As to its influence, it is very likely that it was the minstrel show that first disseminated ragtime—in the late 1880s and 1890s—when ragtime could otherwise be heard only in saloons and dives. Were there American story musicals in these very early years? Historians cite a surprising number of them, such as The Archers (1776), on the William Tell saga; or The Seven Sisters (1860). The former intrigues for its timely revolutionary subject, as the Swiss Tell defies the Austrian Gesler with Colonial fire—and its librettist-lyricist,* William Dunlap, was a prolific playwright and the first major historian of the American stage. But The Archers’ music, by Benjamin Carr, is almost entirely lost; it’s difficult to assess the work. As for The Seven Sisters, it is not clear whether it even had a score beyond dance music and choruses. At that, most of the shows named as musicals in the mid-nineteenth century were really plays with a smattering of song and dance. Virtually\n\n* The word “libretto” is ambiguous; does it denote only “the book” or “the book and the lyrics together”? Originally, the libretto was the verbal content of an opera. By extension, it meant, as in Webster’s Third International Dictionary, “the text of a work of musical theater”—in other words, the book and lyrics together. Some users make a distinction: the libretto, to them, is dialogue only. Taking My Fair Lady’s “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly?” as an example, the refrain’s spoken cue line, “Where’ya bound for this spring, Eliza? Biarritz?,” is part of the libretto, and its sung reply, “All I want is a room somewhere,” is part of something else. This seems to me awkward and diffuse, but it has long since become standard usage: the libretto is the book of a musical, to be considered separately from the lyrics of a musical. Thus, Alan Jay Lerner, who wrote all of My Fair Lady’s words, is not the show’s librettist but its librettist-lyricist. While we’re at it, the “score” refers to the music and lyrics together, not the music alone.\n\nS O U R C E M AT E R I A L\n\n  \n\nevery theatre had an orchestra—this remained the norm through the 1920s—because one reason why people went to theatres in the first place was to hear music. As long as the band was available, why not add to its accustomed duties in playing before and after the show and during the intervals? Why not let performers air their musical specialties? Why not, indeed, hire musical performers for this very purpose in the first place? A Glance at New York in 1848 and New York As It Is, both in 1848, are often mentioned as proto-musicals, partly because their most important figure, F. S. Chanfrau’s celebrated portrayal of Mose the Fire B’hoy, anticipates the heavily Irish character of early Broadway musicmaking, by Harrigan and Hart, George M. Cohan, and Chauncey Olcott among many others. Note the spelling of Mose’s sobriquet: this uncouth little devil, a burst of vernacular realism that thrilled his real-life counterparts in the peanut gallery, belongs to one of the city’s volunteer fire brigades, and “B’hoy” records the Irish-immigrant pronunciation of “boy.” Yet these two Mose shows—there were others in the series—contained only seven ditties each. A very typical musical show of this era is The Naiad Queen; or, The Mysteries of the Lurlie Berg! (1841), another of those-nature and-magic tales, billed as “a mythological and romantic drama.” The authors, W. E. Burton and a composer called simply Mr. Woolf, are unknown to fame, but the star, in the title role, was Charlotte Cushman, an opera singer who lost her voice and re-employed herself as America’s first prominent actress. The Naiad Queen’s program lists only three vocal numbers, but there were eight dances, including “Military Evolutions” (uniformed women showing off a marching drill, a stock item in musicals till the 1920s) and a corps of nymphs in “Beautiful Scarf Movement.” In other words, this is a mating of drama and dance, not a musical as we use the term. It reminds one of the Old Vic’s spectacular staging of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1954, with actors and dancers: Robert Helpmann and Moira Shearer were Oberon and Titania, Stanley Holloway was Bottom, and the company landed at the Metropolitan Opera, for extra prestige. But it wasn’t a musical. If it had been, the characters would have been singing on and off throughout the action; obviously, they weren’t. Either they were speaking Shakespeare or dancing to (and singing a tiny bit of) Mendelssohn. And that brings us to what is generally thought of as the first American musical, The Black Crook (1866), which wasn’t the first anything and wasn’t even a musical. Nevertheless, the history has to start somewhere, and The Black Crook was a smash hit of such vast proportion that it serves as a marker, a first bullet-point in the catalogue of precedents. And of course there is the wonderful legend of how a visiting European ballet troupe was to play the Academy of Music when the theatre burned down, forcing the\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\ndancers to join forces with a crazy melodrama in a rival theatre, Niblo’s Garden, and an alchemy of horror thriller and beauteous display mixes up the “first musical.” Lately, some historians have debunked the tale as a fantasy, but they’re wrong. What legend tells is almost exactly what happened. My authority is a very short book published many years after the event, The Naked Truth: An Inside History of The Black Crook. The author, Joseph Whitton, isn’t clear on his role in the production, saying only that he had “a connection to the financial department of Niblo’s Garden.” From his close view of the saga, Whitton would seem to have been the box-office manager— but also a confidant of William Wheatley, who ran Niblo’s Garden. As Whitton fills out the bare bones of the legend, managers Henry C. Jarrett and Harry Palmer had gone to Europe some time in early 1866 to hire “the most accomplished artistes and the prettiest women . . . from the leading theatres of London, Paris, Berlin, and Milan.” Here Whitton corrects the legend slightly, for Jarrett and Palmer hired not just ballet people but actors and singers. Whitton cites among others Millie Cavendish of Drury Lane, George Atkins of Sadler’s Wells, Rose Morton and Mary Wells of the Lyceum Theatre, contralto Annie Kemp, “pantomimist” Hernandez Fuller (recte, according to The Black Crook’s program, Hernandez Foster). Obviously, Jarrett and Palmer had more than just ballet in mind, and when they returned to New York, in the summer of 1866, they approached William Wheatley with an offer—this is Whitton again—“to join them in the production of a spectacular drama [at Niblo’s Garden], in which their Ballet would be introduced.” Wheatley agreed—and he had the drama, yet another of those natureand-magic stories, this one very reminiscent of Carl Maria von Weber’s opera Der Freischütz, about a nice guy, a nice girl, and a bad guy in league with hell and featuring a scene in which the devil himself is conjured up in spooky ritual. This was The Black Crook, a play by Charles M. Barras. Jarrett and Palmer resented Barras’ exorbitant terms, and they suggested a revision of The Naiad Queen. However, Wheatley seems to have wanted a novelty, and by the time he talked Jarrett and Palmer around, all three men must have sensed that they were in on something not just new but big, because they spent $10,000 to buy out the contract of the Ravel family, French acrobats-cum-dancers who had been headlining in America for a generation, and whose engagement at Niblo’s Garden had six weeks left to run. With a huge company imported from Europe at great expense (and already on salary), it was imperative to free Wheatley’s stage for rehearsals and, especially, to work out the special effects with which the three partners expected The Black Crook to distinguish itself. Ten thousand dollars was a stupendous amount in 1866. The Black Crook itself, loaded as it was with sets, costumes, and “transformation” scenes (in\n\nS O U R C E M AT E R I A L\n\n  \n\nwhich one locale more or less dissolved into another before one’s eyes), only cost $55,000 altogether.* A colossus in every way, the show lasted over five hours on opening night, September 12, 1866, and ran for 474 performances, which had never happened before. Broadway had not yet become the absolute focus of American theatre, and long runs were generated over the course of a multi-city tour, not in a single venue. To keep a theatre with a seating capacity of 1,762 open with a single work for, in this case, sixteen months was unheard of, especially as The Black Crook was really one more entry in the now longish line of phantasmal plays-with-ballet. However, Wheatley, Jarrett, and Palmer did innovate, in three ways: their show was indeed quite a spectacle; their show had popular elements that suggest a primeval form of musical comedy; and their show was sexy. It was those ballet girls. All one saw, really, was the outline of their legs in flesh-colored tights under their skirts. Still, in 1866, that’ll do it. “Nothing in any other Christian country, or in modern times, has approached the indecent and demoralizing exhibition at Wheatley’s theatre,” the New York Herald thundered. “There [were] similar places and scenes in Pompeii just as that city was buried beneath the eruption of Vesuvius.” So everybody immediately bought tickets. In fact, Joseph Whitton believes that the Herald’s publisher, James Gordon Bennett, was deliberately provoking guilty-pleasure ticket buying to thank Wheatley for having taken Bennett’s side in his feud with P. T. Barnum. Whether that’s true or not, The Black Crook did become a hit at least partly through notoriety, enlivening many a Sunday sermon and becoming the topic that, to the ladies’ delighted alarm, could scarcely be broached in mixed company. Indeed, this bashing of The Black Crook by censors and soul savers marks it as roguish, rebellious, and culturally subversive—the very qualities that the American musical was to seize as its own, as we’ll presently see. Interestingly, Whitton does not mention the burning of the Academy of Music, the event that forced the merging of the ballet-and-acting troupe with The Black Crook in the first place. Still, Jarrett and Palmer had to have had a contract with the Academy, because they could not possibly have gone to the trouble of contracting talent in four European countries and hauling them back to America without having secured a place to play in when they returned. They obviously didn’t have one with Niblo’s Garden till they proposed partnering up with Wheatley—so it must have been with the Academy, the only other New York theatre with a stage large enough to suit their ambitions. The probable timeline supports this speculation, for * For some reason, the press reported the capitalization as $50,000, and the figure has dogged the annals ever since. Whitton insists it was the higher number.\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nin order to pack in the ocean voyage to Europe, visit four cities, take in the shows to audition the talent, and then shepherd the new company back across the sea, Jarrett and Palmer must have been gone a good three months—before which they would have signed their contract with the Academy of Music and during the first weeks of which the Academy suffered its conflagration. But what of The Black Crook itself? Why isn’t it a musical even when it anticipates aspects of the musical? For one thing, it had very few vocal numbers, at least in 1866. But, remember, Jarrett and Palmer had sought out not only dancers but specialists of the light musical stage, for instance the aforementioned Millie Cavendish, who played the heroine’s servant, Carline. This part, of the genre known to British play production as the Singing Chambermaid, could be counted on for a merry song regardless of the plot particulars. Indeed, amid all the dastardly intrigue of The Black Crook’s several bad guys and the ethereal wonders of the fairy kingdom, Carline (and her vis-à-vis, Greppo, lackey of the black crook himself, Hertzog) supplied a saucy undertone. Certainly, Barras’ script needed it, as witness the posturing diction. The setting is the Hartz Mountains in 1600, and we begin outside Dame Barbara’s cottage. Rodolphe enters, claps his hands three times, and the lovers meet: AMINA: (looking out a second-floor window) Surely I heard his wellknown signal. Hist, who’s there? RODOLPHE: Tis I, Rodolphe! Rodolphe, a painter, has been trying to raise money by selling his art, but has had no luck. AMINA: (aside) Poor, dear Rodolphe, he knows not the worst—the heaviest blow is yet to come. That’s because Barbara, Amina’s foster-mother, has promised her to evil Count Wolfenstein. After Barbara shoos Rodolphe away, the local girls enter, among them Carline, who gets to deliver what may be the first Unbelievably Contrived Number Cue in the musical’s history: CARLINE: But come, while ’Mina is making ready, let’s rehearse our Festival Dance. It’s as good a reason as any. Carline’s activity sheet includes also making fun of Barbara:\n\nS O U R C E M AT E R I A L\n\n  \n\nBARBARA: Then you—you think me graceful, eh? CARLINE: (to audience) As a hippopotamus. On their London visit, Jarrett and Palmer presumably caught Millie Cavendish at Drury Lane singing “You Naughty, Naughty Men,” which she had commissioned from composer George Bicknell and lyricist Theodore Kennick for her exclusive use. When Cavendish came across the Atlantic, she packed the song, a primitive little carol rattling along on almost nonstop eighth notes (but observe the extremely ahead-of-its-time enjambment in the last two lines): You may talk of love and sighing, Say for us you’re nearly dying, All the while you know you’re trying To deceive, you naughty, naughty men. Barbara plays comedy, too, with Von Puffengruntz, Wolfenstein’s valet. It is not too early in the musical’s saga for there to be a homely woman trying to trap a pompous man into marriage, a convention for the next three generations. In a bit of foolery, Dragonfin—a monster in the service of Stalacta, the Queen of the Golden Realm—rises up through a trap door between Barbara and Von Puffengruntz. (Dragonfin was played by Hernandez Foster, singled out a few pages ago as one of the recruits on the English leg of the European talent search.) The two mortals are self-consciously looking away, and when Von Puffengruntz tries to take Barbara’s hand, he unknowingly gets Dragonfin, who shakes with silent laughter. VON PUFFENGRUNTZ: Poor frightened thing, how she trembles. Then he looks at the hand he is holding. Hmm. That doesn’t seem ladylike, does it? Von Puffengruntz’s gaze slowly travels up the arm till he spies Dragonfin’s face, panics, and races off—all in mime. Barbara, mouing and preening beside Dragonfin, has no idea what has happened: BARBARA: (flirtatiously) You’ll promise not to tread on the Fraulein von Skragneck’s bunion? (Aside) Poor fellow, joy has made him speechless. It may well be that Millie Cavendish’s song and the comedy spots were The Black Crook’s secret weapons—the folderol that helped some of the public get through the hours of ballet, no to mention Barras’ Sturm und\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nDrang dialogue. “Trash,” the critics called it. “Rubbish.” The plot was as coarse and rowdy as a Spielberg dinosaur. Nevertheless, the show was the biggest hit in theatre history; and such a precedent demands a follow-up. Not a sequel, but a second experiment of comparable nature—a Carousel (after Oklahoma!), a Camelot (after My Fair Lady). So Jarrett and Palmer put on a “second” Black Crook at Niblo’s Garden in 1868 as The White Fawn, with a script by James Mortimer. In this “fairy burlesque spectacular extravaganza,” King Dingdong imprisons his daughter, Princess Graceful, in a tower from which she escapes into the arms of Prince Leander (a trouser role, in the style of the day, played by Lucy Egerton). The Black Crook’s satanic intrigue was set aside for the purer atmosphere of Storybookland, yet the same combination of melodrama, ballet, and elaborate decor ruled the stage. This time, however, there were more than just a few songs, including early examples of what would prove one of the musical’s most useful expedients, the establishing number. Think of “Why Can’t the English?,” “I Put My Hand In,” “The Worst Pies in London.” The White Fawn offered the analogous, if risibly obvious, “I’m King Dingdong” and “Prince Leander Is My Name.”* Lasting 176 performances, The White Fawn was a smash hit, hut no phenomenon. Nor did the title itself develop any reverberation. Among melodrama-dance spectacles, it was The Black Crook that the public demanded, in revival tours that kept beefing up the vocal menu to compete with the full-fledged musicals of the 1880s and 1890s. In the end, The Black Crook became the summoning title for the era, just as, later, My Fair Lady would; the defining work of the time, event theatre, the piece that playgoers had to collect and others at least know about. Then, too, coming right after the end of the Civil War, The Black Crook stood at the entrance to the new economic and social epoch in American life, the day of robber barons and railroad wealth and upward mobility within both the middle and fashionable classes. The show thus marks the start of the musical’s First Age, from 1866 to 1899, when primitive genres were elaborated or retired and when European imports dazzled the public with their integration of song and story. This is where the saga really begins.\n\n* Offenbach and Gilbert and Sullivan are filled with establishing numbers. Think of “I’m Called Little Buttercup” or, in its own strange way, the song of the mechanical doll in The Tales of Hoffmann, which is not only her establishing song but virtually her entire part. However, at the time of The White Fawn, Offenbach was only just being heard in America, and Gilbert and Sullivan hadn’t even met. An outstanding precedent for the establishing number can be found in Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute), in Papageno’s entrance number, a virtual calling card: “The bird catcher am I . . . ”\n\nw\n\nCHAPTER \n\nThe Age of Burlesque\n\nT\n\nhere is something worth examining in that billing of The White Fawn as a “fairy burlesque spectacular extravaganza.” The last word, properly reserved for shows on the grand scale, became so misapplied by managers boosting their pokey little productions that the word lost all meaning. The White Fawn was also, we note, a burlesque—and this word needs discussion. Although burlesque was the very distant forerunner of the degraded art of strippers and low comics that we visit in the last scenes of Gypsy, it took a long time and a lot of devolution to get there. In the early 1900s, for instance, burlesque was simply a variety show featuring performers of the lowest rank and emphasizing young women in only slightly revealing outfits. A burlesque theatre was the neighborhood show shop, about as far from what “Broadway” meant as a cocktail napkin is from an illuminated medieval manuscript. However, before that, in the time of The White Fawn, burlesque was a spoof of a literary or dramatic work with mostly women performers—cast, every manager claimed, for beauty if not talent—in a script delineated in rhymed couplets, its humor concentrating on puns. And this brings us to the queen of early burlesque and America’s first musical star, the English Lydia Thompson, actor-manager of the celebrated “British Blondes.” Thompson’s troupe made their American debut in New York at Wood’s Museum* in 1868 with Ixion!; or, The Man At the Wheel, Ixion being a fabled Greek king who boasted of having seduced Hera and took his punishment bound to a revolving wheel. Thompson played the role, and, as so often in * Many early American theatres were housed in buildings denoted as “museums” to deflect puritanical criticism with the trappings of an educational experience—artifact displays, lecture series, and the like. (  )\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nWestern art, Greek and Roman names for the gods were carelessly intermingled; characters included Bacchus and Ganymede but also Jupiter (Zeus). Generally, in burlesque, the fun centered on modernizing ancient times or exotic places with the peeves and delights of the public’s daily life. This gave an original flavor to the scripts, and each season brought novel topics to reference. The scores, however, were the usual grab bag of preexisting music, sometimes tricked out with new lyrics. Raids on the classics were popular as well: Ixion! included an orchestral medley from Verdi’s Il Trovatore, just fifteen years old at the time. Thompson enjoyed a long career, and in due course her offerings grew musically more expansive. Robinson Crusoe (1877), with Thompson again in the name role, contained numbers listed in the program as “Concerted Piece,” “Quartette à la Marionette,” and “Grand Ensemble.” But the comedy, as before, was slick and daring for the day. In 1869, a Chicago newspaper editor accused Thompson of using the stage “for the exhibition of coarse women and the use of disreputable language unrelieved by any wit or humor,” and Thompson retaliated by horsewhipping him outside his house. Burlesque historian Robert C. Allen calls Thompson “the figurative mother of Sophie Tucker and Mae West”—that is, of independent women who tested the legal limits of bourgeois protocols about gender. “From Ixion [sic] on,” says Allen, “burlesque implicitly raised troubling questions about how a woman should be ‘allowed’ to act on stage . . . and about the relationship of women onstage to women in the outside, ‘real’ world.” Not all burlesques were subversive. Most simply threw everything they had at a designated target as a schoolboy heaves a snowball at a banker’s top hat. In 1844, Michael William Balfe’s opera The Bohemian Girl played the Park Theatre; a year later came The Bohea Man’s Girl—the burlesque, of course. Virtually all theatregoers had seen tragedian Edwin Forrest’s perennial vehicle Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags (1829); now they could enjoy Met-AMora; or, The Last of the Pollywogs (1848). Longfellow and Shakespeare took their turns, in Hiawatha; or, Ardent Spirits and Laughing Waters (1856), which drew largely on Italian opera for its music; and Shylock: A Jerusalem Hearty Joke (1853). In an 1857 revision, Shylock; or, The Merchant of Venice Preserved, the score borrowed the big tune from Auber’s opéra comique Fra Diavolo, known in its English translation as “On Yonder Rock Reclining.” Here its first line was “In yonder house is dining . . .” There were even topical burlesques, as in King Cotton; or, The Exiled Prince (1862), “a new, national, quizzical, local, farcical, musical, dramatical burlesque extravaganza in one act, nine scenes, suitable to the times.” The characters ran from Jefferson Davis the First, King of Cotton, to Ponce de Leon, the scene was laid in Secessia, and the numbers included a chorus of Federals, “Oh, Jeff Davis, Have We Caught You!”\n\nT H E A G E OF B U R L E S Q U E\n\n  \n\nMost early burlesques were one-acts; King Cotton was preceded by a scene from Shakespeare and followed by a farce. By the 1870s, however, burlesque had been graduated to full-length works, some with original scores. And here, at last, we find the first American musical (at any rate, the first famous one): Edward Everett Rice and J. Cheever Goodwin’s Evangeline; or, The Belle of Acadia (1874). Once again, Longfellow provided the subject matter, his tragic poem of 1847 on the forced emigration from their homeland of the lovers Evangeline and Gabriel. Separated, the two travel the American continent in search of each other; in one ghoulishly tender sequence, Evangeline and her party camp in hiding on the Mississippi shore while an unknowing Gabriel sails past them. After years, while nursing the sick in an almshouse, Evangeline recognizes Gabriel. Sleeping, he utters her name and dies. “This is the forest primeval” is Evangeline’s first line, and at the end Longfellow returns to the image, telling how some of the exiles have returned to Acadia, repeating the sad story of the two sundered sweethearts: While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring ocean Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest. One immediately sees the possibilities: the heroine’s picaresque can take her anywhere the audience would enjoy seeing her, such as the far west and even Africa, and, as Longfellow gave her a cow, why not put two men into a cow suit to caper about as (so billed) the Heifer? Gabriel has a mother, Catherine, played by a man in drag, and, for that touch of novelty, the authors added in the Lone Fisherman, “a patient and singularly taciturn toiler of the sea,” the program explained, “with a natural tendency to hook whatever comes within reach.” Turning up in scene after scene in contradiction of geographical logic, ever gazing out to sea through his telescope, the Lone Fisherman became much better known than any character in The Black Crook or Lydia Thompson’s shows. James S. Maffitt, himself an author and actor-manager, succeeded to the role sometime during its twenty-five-year history, as did George K. Fortescue to that of Catherine; both virtually based their careers on this one work. Further, it became a proving ground for future stars: Henry E. Dixey and Francis Wilson broke in their curriculum vitae as halves of the Heifer in the late 1870s. By then, Rice and Goodwin were billing their show as an “opera bouffe,” with an expanded score now running to some thirty numbers, though these weren’t necessarily programmed in every performance. The music is unimpressive: “Thinking, Love, Of Thee,” the heroine’s first number, gets\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nthrough an entire refrain on little more than four chords. Yet some of Evangeline’s song titles suggest a story score, especially the ensembles and, obviously, Evangeline’s very apropos “Where Art Thou Now, My Beloved?,” sung during her African visit. We should note as well “I’m in Lofe Mit a Shveet Leedle Girl,” the German-dialect song of one Captain Dietrich, “a ‘Dutch’ mercenary in the British ranks, who shows no mercy, being a mercy-nary cuss.” He’s a minor character, but it’s a major point: the musical in general was to stereotype Europeans as stock figures—especially as immigrants in America—playing on their accents and malapropisms for humor. In Evangeline’s day, they were Scandinavians and Germans. (“Dutch” is simply a corruption of deutsch [“German”]). Later, Irish, Italian, black, and Jewish stereotypes emerged. Although the intention was to create fun at a minority group’s expense, the long-range effect was, paradoxically, to socialize and assimilate alien peoples through familiarity. Stereotyping precedes sensitive portrayal, which engenders equality and a share of political power. Writing in a totally different context, H. G. Wells called this “let[ting] daylight into the temples.” Bizarre as it may sound, such sophisticated works as Fiddler on the Roof and Parade are founded on the cultural penetration of the Dutchcomic team of Weber and Fields, who will be along shortly. Unlike the musical’s other founding titles, Evangeline played only one long run in New York, lasting half a year on a visit in 1885. This show was a national favorite. But another such broke The Black Crook’s record and then, in revival, enjoyed another gigantic run, yet faded away so completely that, unlike Evangeline and even The Black Crook, it left absolutely nothing behind. We can call it the most obscure smash hit in the musical’s history: Humpty Dumpty (1868). The main reason is that its genre died out very, very suddenly just when Evangeline was enjoying a vogue and The Black Crook was still doggedly touring. Humpty Dumpty was a pantomime, an irritatingly confusing term whose history starts in Italian commedia dell’arte, moves to France and thence to England, where pantomime is still an annual Christmastime event. However, modern pantomime resembles nineteenth-century pantomime in only the storybook subjects and the eclectic music using pre-existing materials. From ancient burlesque, it adopts the Principal Boy and the Drag Dame we met up with in Evangeline’s Gabriel and Catherine. Otherwise, today’s English pantomimes are unique only for their traditional audience participation, especially in warning actors when something dangerous threatens (such as a spider coming down behind an innocent) and arguing with, for instance, Cinderella’s step-sisters, who insist, “Oh, yes, it is” to the public’s shouted “Oh, no, it isn’t!” till the step-sisters throw a picturesque tantrum.\n\nT H E A G E OF B U R L E S Q U E\n\n  \n\nHumpty Dumpty was nothing like that, but it’s difficult to say exactly what it was. An episodic mixture of fantasy and the everyday and filled with exhibition sequences from roller skating and circus acts to ballet and an exploding steamboat, the show centered on the reportedly matchless abilities of its star, George L. Fox. His title role had nothing to do with sitting on a wall and all the king’s horses; the scenes took place in a “Vale of Fertility” and “The Retreat of the Silver Sprites” but also “Humpty’s Grocery” and “Lunch Room Down Town.” As always in old pantomime, the show started like other musicals, then underwent a magical bit in which a fairy transformed the leads into commedia figures who played the rest of their parts in dumb show (except when they sang). Hernandez Foster, The Black Crook’s silent comic monster Dragonfin, would have been right at home in Humpty Dumpty. Virtually all show biz at this time was a performer’s medium, but pantomime was especially so. One might even call it George L. Fox’s medium, because, after dementia drove him from the stage, pantomime instantly collapsed. The Humpty of the first national tour, Tony Denier, kept the show going here and there. Still, without Fox’s drawing power, there was no reason to create any new works in this line. Then, too, pantomime, like the ballet spectacles, was expensive to capitalize. Burlesque was tidier and thus attractive to managers—and in the 1870s, farce offered the stingiest form of musical yet. Farce didn’t even need to produce a score: the manager hired a small company, each to contribute his or her specialty, like a band of Millie Cavendishes. In her case, it was “You Naughty, Naughty Men” dropping in on The Black Crook, but it might be any song or two, a dance, an acrobatics display, a recitation. The musical farce was a play containing a talent show. Reciting was Nate Salsbury’s specialty, and Salsbury, as actor-manager and playwright, is called the creator of the American farce musical. He provides us with another of our landmark titles, The Brook (1879), a single act expanded to two in 1881 and a cheapskate manager’s dream of a show: just two sets, no chorus, and five lead roles taken by, as historian Gerald Bordman puts it, “shouters and buffoons.” Billed as Salsbury’s Troubadors, they did largely hold together as a unit through not only The Brook’s years of touring but on to Three of a Kind! (1883) and The Humming Bird (1887). Salsbury was in the shows, though as author he wrote only The Brook. “Pic-nic grounds for a dinner in the woods” was the set description in the original program: the party arrives, finds that all the food has been contaminated during the trip, and opens a chest to discover not the hoped-for watermelons but . . . theatrical costumes! Well, on with the motley, and, after performing, the party packs up and sets off for home.\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nInsistently heralded as “farce comedies,” these were in fact musicals with hodgepodge scores—a new topical number on, say, the dos and don’ts of train travel, or the patter trio from Gilbert and Sullivan’s Ruddigore that ended up also in Thoroughly Modern Millie over a century later, or a “Plantation Song” called “Swinging on a Gospel Gate.” Farces became the rage, and if Nate Salsbury was their father, Charles H. Hoyt became their master. Hoyt had a gimmick: his titles began with the indefinite article: A Bunch Of Keys (1883), A Parlor Match (1884), A Black Sheep (1896), A Day and a Night in New York (1898). Manager Florenz Ziegfeld’s first Broadway production was a revival of A Parlor Match, in 1896, with the original stars, Charles Evan Evans and William F. Hoey. The latter played a crazy tramp who “haunts” a house and sang a hit interpolation, “The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo,” the kind of number for which the word “rollicking” might have been invented. Monte Carlo has nothing to do with being a tramp or haunting a house, but farce was the player piano of musical comedy, always open to a hot number of any kind. Ziegfeld really intended his Parlor Match as the debut venue for his first musical-comedy star, “étoile de Paris” Anna Held, who appeared as one of the spirits in a séance scene to sing the somewhat less than spiritual “Come and Play With Me,” along with encores at the public’s demand. Ziegfeld invented the use of PR as the engine that drives stardom, and while Evans and Hoey were the show’s leads, Mlle. Held was the reason the audience was there, keyed up by Ziegfeld’s drumming bulletins on the enticingly hedonistic abandon of Held’s lifestyle, eventually to include a mysterious jewel robbery and a daily enjoyment of—innocents, please leave the room—milk baths! Yes! To pleasure the skin and revel in the guiltless freedom of the appetitive existence. The method was headlines, the content was sin, the reaction was mass curiosity, and the result was sensation. Even so, farce’s outstanding hit was a different Hoyt title, A Trip To Chinatown (1891), billed as “An idyll of San Francisco” and, at 657 consecutive performances in New York alone, our biggest success yet. It can also to be credited with the musical’s first gigantic song hit, the “Memories” of its day, Charles K. Harris’ “After the Ball,” a nostalgic piece interpolated sometime during the run. It tells of an old bachelor who broke off his engagement with his life’s love because he—wrongly—thought her faithless. A story ballad, “After the Ball” runs on a structure in which each of three verses advances the narrative while the repeated chorus remains the same—a static nineteenth-century format that the twentieth-century musical would retire. In fact, the old story ballad became so antique that Show Boat used this very number to place a scene chronologically. When it is announced as “an old favorite,” the audience instantly understands that\n\nT H E A G E OF B U R L E S Q U E\n\n  \n\nthe scene recalls a time when story ballads were still sung—when heroines like Magnolia Ravenal would appear in an evening gown with a feathered fan to transform cabaret into the Story Hour. A Trip To Chinatown’s plot is almost painfully simple. The setting is San Francisco. In Act One, some young people plan to attend a ball while alibiing to curmudgeonly Uncle Ben that they’re merely going to take in the sights of Chinatown. Oh, it’s perfectly innocent. Mrs. Guyer, a widow (a favorite character in musicals, always assumed to be ahead of the curve in worldly matters) will chaperone. But Uncle Ben has designs on the widow. Act Two is set in a chic restaurant, where Uncle Ben awaits the widow in vain and does shtick comedy with an uncooperative waiter while, unbeknown to him, the young people enjoy themselves in the next room. (Nobody gets to the ball, which, in any case, is raided by the police.) Uncle Ben’s bill is a hundred dollars, but he has lost his wallet . . . and here many a historian chimes in with how much A Trip To Chinatown anticipates the Harmonia Gardens restaurant scene in Hello, Dolly!. Indeed it does: the old curmudgeon who has lost his money, the young people he knows but can’t see (and one of them, in both shows, is his niece), the widow. Even more interesting is how much of the stock humor that the musical would still be using well into the twentieth century was already in play in the 1890s—the crazy names, for example, a notable feature some fifty years later in On the Town, with its Lucy Schmeeler and Claire De Loon. The leader of Chinatown’s young crowd is Rashleigh Gay, his best friend is Wilder Daly, Uncle Ben’s hypochondriac friend is Welland Strong, the waiter is Slavin Paine, and of course Mrs. Guyer is so named because a widow knows how to “guy” (fool) the men. (She also gets into male disguise at one point.) Or take this exchange, whose play on the word “taste” is standard musical-comedy fun even today. In the restaurant, the supposedly moribund Welland Strong is asked to order for the young people’s party: WELLAND: I fear the taste of a dying man may not exactly suit your fancies. WILDER: I don’t know. I never tasted one. Chinatown’s core numbers (before the huge New York run and years of touring added various interpolations), composed mainly by Percy Gaunt to Hoyt’s lyrics, were wholly unintegrated. At regular intervals, someone would simply cue up a song, as when, at the restaurant, Rashleigh’s girl friend, Flirt, cries out, “Say, everybody! Tony [Uncle Ben’s niece] knows the song the orchestra’s playing. I want you all to listen.” Or consider the rampup to “The Pretty Widow”:\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nRASHLEIGH: The widow’s more fun than any girl I know. Say, Wilder, I don’t believe a woman is ever at her best till she becomes a widow. WILDER: The boys all seem to think she’s in her prime, anyway. That’s a great song Billy Barker wrote and dedicated to her. And the two then dig in: Do you know her? Have you met her? If so, you’ll ne’er forget her, The pretty little widow with the laughing eyes of brown. It’s a slim score, too, for the show had far more book than music. Even so, A Trip To Chinatown counted hit tunes besides “After the Ball.” “Reuben and Cynthia” and the clodhopping waltz “(On) The Bowery,” popular long after their day, are ridiculously simplistic. But a minstrel number entirely by Gaunt, “Push Dem Clouds Away”—a description of the heavenly life— bears a disarming naiveté. The young people and Mrs. Guyer introduce it in Act One: Old Gabriel’s horn will toot and roar, When you push dem clouds away! There’ll be no dudes around the stage door, When you push dem clouds away! Discussions of musical farce seek its truest source but also its expressive summit in the work of Harrigan and Hart, though Edward Harrigan, the actor-manager-playwright of the concern, generally termed each work as a “local comedy” or “local play.” The “local” was not used lightly, for the series of shows that Harrigan and his acting partner, Tony Hart, presented from just before to just after the 1880s was obsessed with New York immigrant life. Here was a counter to Dutch comedy in something larger: Irish stereotypes at once broad and nuanced, for the fun of it, but also to taste of life as lived. E. J. Kahn, Harrigan and Hart’s biographer, tells us that the company would appear not in costumes but in clothes bought right off the backs of Irish immigrants as they stepped out of Castle Garden, the immigration processing station, and that the Garden itself was set on Harrigan’s stage more than once. “Good old Ned!” the crowd would cry at a line that struck them with the wonder of self-recognition. Some historians want to date the founding of the American musical from Harrigan and Hart simply\n\nT H E A G E OF B U R L E S Q U E\n\n  \n\nbecause here the musical discovered its unique content, in a sociology of New York’s evolving ethnicity: The Mulligan Guards’ Ball (1879); The Mulligans’ Silver Wedding (1880); Cordelia’s Aspirations (1883), which are social; McNooney’s Visit (1887), which leads him to be mistaken for a burglar; Reilly and the Four Hundred (1890), another mixup between the Irish and Society. The playwright Dion Boucicault, famed for unusually realistic melodramas often set in Ireland, told Harrigan, “You have done for the Irish in New York what I have done for the Irish in Ireland.” The Harrigan and Hart enterprise was like a family. Some of the company were married—had, in fact, met on the job—and they held together over the years like a stock company, at least until Tony Hart brought his Yoko Ono onto the scene. The new Mrs. Hart nourished acting ambitions, and ultimately Hart broke up with Harrigan and struck off on his own, unsuccessfully. The two men’s era lasted less than a generation even with a lock audience, for there was just so much to be got out of a single milieu— even a single family, Dan and Cordelia Mulligan and their brood. No other major writer or writing team pursued so limited an agenda, but no others had to: when Harrigan stepped out of type for Mordecai Lyons (1882), as a Jewish pawnbroker, his public balked. Further, as so often in the First Age, the Harrigan and Hart shows weren’t really musicals. Some had a handful of tunes, others only a few more than that—and the songs were atmosphere pieces, not character numbers. For all its banality, the Evangeline score tries to give voice to its characters at very certain turns in the plot, whereas the Harrigan and Hart songs, composed by Dave Braham to Harrigan’s verses, are all of a “boys and girls together” type: “The Mulligan Guard,” as Dan’s militia turns out on parade; “The Babies On Our Block,” “The Widow Nolan’s Goat,” “Maggie Murphy’s Home,” where “A bedroom and a parlor is all we call our own.” In fact, there was very little genuine music theatre in America until Gilbert and Sullivan and Offenbach showed theatregoers what a musical really was, with greatest impact in the late 1870s and early 1880s. Offenbach had been heard from as early as 1867, when La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein played New York for an astonishing 156 performances in the original French. In fact, the public enjoyed Offenbach partly because few understood what his characters were actually saying; later, when they heard what the randy Grand Duchess, the adulterous Helen and Paris, and that sexual racketeer Zeus were up to in English translation, there was outcry. Gilbert and Sullivan are circumspect about fleshly pleasure. More to the point, Sullivan utterly overtook the sophomoric sounds of the native forms and Gilbert was everyone’s first taste of wit in the libretto. Such was the appeal of HMS Pinafore in its premiere season of 1878–1879 that it didn’t\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\njust make a hit on Broadway: it saturated the theatre district in multiple showings. Besides a run of 175 performances at its main home, the Standard Theatre, it enjoyed good stays also at the Broadway and Fifth Avenue Theatres and in two different productions at the Lyceum, a German version, short runs at the Olympic and Wallack’s, a staging by a black troupe at the Globe, a double-teaming of adult and children’s casts at Haverly’s Lyceum (after which the adults departed and the kids took over for 57 performances), and, naturally, a burlesque version, by the San Francisco Minstrels, His-Mud-Scow Pinafore, a big deal at 92 performances at Niblo’s Garden. Theatregoers went Gilbert-and-Sullivan mad, and each next Savoy title nourished their love of this very new form of musical, smart and sly and musically persuasive. Then, too, unlike the faerie of The Black Crook and the dizzy contortions of burlesque, the Savoy style offered satires on sociopolitical themes. They were, to use a concept of the 1960s, “relevant.” Many shows made topical references: here was a full-fledged topical conversation. Gilbert and Sullivan’s Patience, named for a milkmaid torn between two trendy poets, seemed to be a spoof of Oscar Wilde, who was even then—in 1881—making his Personal Appearance in America under the management of Richard D’Oyly Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan’s manager in both England and the United States. As Wilde’s biographer Richard Ellmann puts it, “Carte expected Patience to give a fillip to Wilde’s lectures, and the lectures to give a fillip to Patience.” Patience is really a spoof of trendiness per se, not of Wilde—but the presumed Wildean character (actually a composite of artsy public figures), Reginald Bunthorne, has a line about walking down Piccadilly “with a poppy or a lily in your medieval hand.” And didn’t Wilde do just that? “To have done it was nothing,” Wilde eventually remarked, “but to make people think one had done it was a triumph.” Still, isn’t there a strong sense of Wilde in his late-in-the-second-act confrontation with his rival, one Archibald Grosvenor, when Bunthorne is about to pronounce a curse?: GROSVENOR: Oh, reflect! You had a mother once. BUNTHORNE: Never! GROSVENOR: Then you had an aunt. Whereupon Bunthorne goes completely to pieces. Then as now, the most popular Savoy title was The Mikado, first given here in 1885, initiating a cycle of American musicals set in the East: The Begum (1887), Wang (1891), Panjandrum (1893), The Rainmaker of Syria (1893), Tabasco (1894). The appeal to writers was easy to understand: exotic\n\nT H E A G E OF B U R L E S Q U E\n\n  \n\ncustoms gave them instant comedy material. Wang, by Evangeline’s primary librettist, J. Cheever Goodwin (who was now working with composer Woolson Morse), anticipated the plot premise of The Merry Widow, as all intrigue to secure a widow’s fortune . . . in Siam. But “Ask the Man in the Moon” told where the show really took place, with references to “the L roads” (New York’s elevated railways) and “the Washington Arch.” Again, the scores were infantile, so while such shows were very successful, the historical momentum lay with European models with their integrated scores and truevoiced singers: comic opera was the term for them now. Consider the 1880–1881 season. There were helpings of Harrigan and Hart; yet another revision of Evangeline and revivals of The Black Crook, Humpty Dumpty, and The Brook; a burlesque of Carmen; and Fritz in Ireland, the latest entry in a series focusing on yet another immigrant group that began with Fritz, Our Cousin German (1870), starring J. K. Emmet. These and a few trifles constituted the American shows, and, of them all, only Evangeline was truly a musical, with its evening’s worth of songs, at least some of which were embedded in the action so tellingly that without them the work would implode. This was something that comic opera supplied as a rule. In a mere two years after the appearance of HMS Pinafore, the story show with its story score had colonized Broadway. Thus, Gilbert and Sullivan were represented by more of Pinafore and, to boot, The Pirates of Penzance (which inspired two burlesques), and there were no fewer than fourteen productions of continental pieces. These counted new works and revivals, about half in the original and half in translation: Offenbach, Lecocq, von Suppé, Genée, Strauss. Planquette and Audran enjoyed double mountings of their Les Cloches de Corneville and La Mascotte (respectively), in both French and English. Then, near the start of the following season, the Casino Theatre opened— the first American playhouse built specifically for musicals. Dominating the southeast corner of Broadway and Thirty-Ninth Street, well north of the theatre district of the day, the structure combined a facade of Venetian Gothic with a Moorish tower at the corner matching the interior’s decor, something like a seraglio seating 1,300. The very size of the place emphasized the proportions of comic opera, not so much in spectacle as in the importance of the chorus and the expanded orchestra. The Casino was a palace of comic opera, an acknowledgment that a major form deserved a major showplace. But first, just to make this difficult for us, burlesque threw a last party with one of the biggest hits of the era, setting a new long-run record at 603 performances: Adonis (1884). A spoof of the Pygmalion and Galatea legend, Adonis starred Henry E. Dixey as a statue come to life, entrancing so many would-be lovers that he seeks relief\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nby turning back into marble. The score was the usual ragbag of old music with new words, though Edward E. Rice did some fresh composing. William F. Gill wrote the script in a breathless, anything-for-a-laugh style that at times goes into free-associative gabble. Here’s Adonis crazing around with Rosetta, described in the program as “The happy possessor of a clear conscience and a soprano voice” and played by Amelia Summerville, a specialist in physically abundant young women: ADONIS: (rushing on and falling into Rosetta’s arms) I am hemmed in by my pursuers . . . But fear not, Rosetta, I will never be taken alive. Rather than that I would eat pies of your making and die of indigestion. Rosetta wants Adonis to save himself through masquerade. ROSETTA: My wardrobe is extensive. ADONIS: (noting her waistline) It would have to be. Only Humpty Dumpty had so promoted the talents of its star, for Adonis was devoted to the trim and handsome but endlessly sassy Dixey—and to some twenty disguises that he slipped into and out of, to his imitations of everyone from a Harrigan and Hart type to the English Shakespearean Henry Irving, and not least to Dixey’s kicky dancing. Dixey and his fellow leads took the show to London, a most unusual event for an American musical, and the star seldom strayed from his signature role for the next twenty years. On one of Dixey’s last New York appearances, in 1884 at the Casino, his famous “fadeout” curtain in which he reassumed his original pose as the statue was followed by a unique exhibition by the bodybuilder Sandow, a real-life Adonis. The young Florenz Ziegfeld was in the Casino that night; noticing how animated the audience became as Sandow flexed, preened, and went into his unique standing back-flip, Ziegfeld decided to manage Sandow as a show-biz attraction. This eventually led Ziegfeld to the aforementioned revival of A Parlor Match and, ultimately, to a producing career in the musical outranking in influence that of all other nonwriters except Hal Prince. Adonis marked the end of old-fashioned burlesque, which soon devolved into a girls-and-comics revue format in rundown neighborhood venues and, later, into the tawdry stripper shows that most Americans think of when they hear the word “burlesque.” European comic opera was sweeping the American musical stage, and now comes the first enduring American comic opera, a potboiler for some fifty years and occasionally staged today,\n\nT H E A G E OF B U R L E S Q U E\n\n  \n\nas a niche ceremony by companies as devoted to the Old Ways as Druids were in the days of Camelot. This is Reginald De Koven’s Robin Hood (1891), written for a touring stock troupe, the Boston Ideal Opera Company. The Bostonians (as they were commonly called and eventually renamed) were formed right at the start of comic opera’s heyday, for a production of HMS Pinafore, and they define the genre’s vocal demands in their repertory, which included both comic operas and such “lighter” outright operas as L’Elisir d’Amore, Le Nozze di Figaro, and Martha (all in English). Indeed, much of Robin Hood sounds like opera when it doesn’t sound like Johann Strauss. A men’s sextet in Act Two, “Oh, See the Lambkins Play!,” starts as a sturdy glee and then breaks into a sprightly waltz with “Ho! then for jollity, fun and frivolity” that would feel right at home in Die Fledermaus’ party scene. That isn’t an homage: the soundscape of Strauss, Lecocq, and their colleagues created the palette with which American comic opera loved to paint: it brought relief from the dowdy tinkle of Evangeline and its like. Burlesque and farce had the fun; comic opera had the prestige. The Europetrained De Koven was the compleat musician, orchestrating his scores himself and composing genuine operas, The Canterbury Pilgrims (for the Met) and Rip Van Winkle (for Chicago). Critics thought him no more than workmanlike, but Robin Hood, at least, has tang, and it even got one last hearing on Broadway as late as 1944, albeit in a poor staging that banished the piece thereafter to the twilight of minor venues. Robin Hood’s libretto, by Harry B. Smith, offers no surprises to those even dimly familiar with Maid Marian, the Sheriff of Nottingham (the comic role, for the Bostonians’ Henry Clay Barnabee), the ample Friar Tuck (who leads the show’s second most popular number, “Song of Brown October Ale”), the romantic Allan-a-Dale (a trouser role, with the show’s most popular number, “Oh, Promise Me,” interpolated for the Bostonians’ pet mezzo, Jessie Bartlett Davis), Little John, Will Scarlett, and of course the bandit nobleman title role himself. Oddly, the Bostonians weren’t keen on the piece at first, throwing the premiere together out of odds and ends. In his memoirs, Smith tells us the production cost $109.50, and the Robin Hood, Edwin Hoff, played in his Il Trovatore Manrico suit. Nevertheless, the music caught on, the Bostonians put it into heavy rotation on their tours, and much of it served as a model for other writers in the field. The opening fair scene, with its introduction of various groups and individuals, each in a different musical setting, anticipates comparable openings in a number of evolved forms, from Naughty Marietta and Show Boat through Strike Up the Band and Allegro to Wonderful Town and Li’l Abner. Further, the lengthy first-act finale in which plot zigzags drive\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nthe music—again in contrasting musical paragraphs—appears to enter the American musical’s vocabulary at this time. The three-act Robin Hood has two such, so dramatically effective that the finaletto, as it was called, became all but de rigueur in even the least ambitious of musicals into the 1930s. Most important, De Koven gave Robin Hood consistency of tone. There are only a few very pointed touches of pastiche, yet it all somehow suggests “England at the time of Richard I.” While antiquing away with horn calls and marches, De Koven created something the American musical may not have had before, atmosphere. There were more successful comic operas at the time, but none remained as popular for as long as Robin Hood did. Its music even entered demographic knowledge far beyond that of the average theatregoer when “Oh, Promise Me” became the wedding hymn of choice for some three generations. This gives us a hint of the musical’s growing power to assert control of the national songbook, and to enjoy cultural impact far greater than that of any other theatrical form in any other Western country.\n\nw\n\nCHAPTER \n\nAt the Turn of the Century\n\nA\n\ns the First Age drew near its end, much of the generic jumble we have been witness to was cleared away. That loony-kazoony genre known as pantomime vanished, along with dancing plays like The Black Crook. European comic opera inspired a body of American comic opera, meanwhile making the author team of composer and librettist-lyricist significant as never before: because an intimate relationship between script and score had become elemental in the making of musicals. However, where in all this was musical comedy, comic opera’s vernacular counterpart? It had arrived, quite suddenly, in the early 1880s, as a spruced-up burlesque imitating Gilbert and Sullivan. Cinderella At School (1881), written entirely by Wang’s composer, then known as Henry Woolson Morse, and based on T. W. Robertson’s play School, is the first work I can trace to bill itself as a “musical comedy,” though the term did not catch on till the early 1900s. From the opening chorus, “Green Are the Waving Branches,” to the last solo, after a regatta, “Columbia Won the Race Today,” Cinderella At School utilized a story score with some thirty numbers while juggling two sweetheart couples and a bad guy, Dr. Syntax. The future Adonis, Henry E. Dixey, played him during Cinderella At School’s second season, when the role of the Schoolmistress was recast, in a touch of burlesque, as a man in drag—Evangeline’s George K. Fortescue. Yet another important performer, De Wolf Hopper, who had played the title role in Wang, played also the title role in a complete rewriting of the show as Dr. Syntax (1894), when it was billed as a “comic opera.” Thus, the very identity of what were becoming the two chief forms— musical comedy and comic opera—was a slippery one. Was musical comedy something like burlesque but further modernized? A lowdown comic\n\n(  )\n\n(  )\n\nThe First Age\n\nopera? At times, it seemed to be anything with a few vaudevillians and a voiceless soubrette who was charming her way to the top. Perhaps The Belle Of New York (1897) is instructive: billed as a “musical comedy,” it became famous as one, to the point of embodying the type. Was this because of the raffish characters from the Bowery and Chinatown? The modest vocal demands? Or simply the very ordinariness of the plot, about a Salvation Army lass (Edna May) involved with a dissolute society boy (Harry Davenport) in danger of being disinherited by a grouchy papa? Harry Davenport is our first performer readers may be acquainted with, for his long career took him to Grandpa Smith in MGM’s Meet Me In St. Louis. However, it was eighteen-year-old Edna May in The Belle’s title part who became a song-and-dance star, for the show, unappreciated on Broadway, was taken to London and had a sensation, making May the belle of the West End. As the only genuinely refined character among the principals, she of course would sing soprano, her voice to ring out on high at the usual first-act finale. Most of her colleagues got songs of limited range, presumably to allow producer George Lederer to hire entertainers rather than legit singers; David Warfield, a lead character billed as the “polite lunatic” Karl von Pumpernick, appeared only in book scenes. Revived in London six times into the 1940s, The Belle Of New York caught on in the United States entirely on the road and with amateur groups, though the Shuberts mounted a revision as The Whirl of New York in 1921 that did reasonably well at 124 performances. The Belle’s score did produce a few standards, not least the heroine’s first number (after a surprisingly late entrance in the last third of Act One), “They All Follow Me.” Framed as a revivalist’s march and egged on by tambourine, the song is the confession of a soul-saver too pretty to be effective. She conquers not souls but hearts: CHORUS: Follow on! Follow on! When the light of faith you see. VIOLET: But they never proceed to follow that light, But always follow me! If on sheer reputation alone, The Belle of New York is a landmark title. Its authors, on the other hand, are known to archivists only: composer Gustave Kerker and librettist C. M. S. McLellan, who worked at this time as Hugh Morton. The pair wrote eight shows together around the turn of the century, a typical Broadway collaboration in that Kerker came from Germany and McLellan was British: this was the era of partnerships between continental composers and English or American wordsmiths. Another such duo was Gustav Luders (from Bremen) and Frank Pixley (from Richfield, Ohio), who generally worked in established formats"
