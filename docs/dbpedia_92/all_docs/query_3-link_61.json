ISSN 2082-8578. ◄◄ In connection with the measures taken to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Poland, from March 2020 the activity of cultural centres was periodically frozen. From the very beginning it caused challenges of various natures, especially financial ones. The inability to organise commercial events has forced many institutions to look for alternative sources of income. Above all, however, the epidemic called into question the possibility of carrying out the statutory activities of cultural institutions. This paper discusses new contexts of this activity, which boiled down to cancelling or suspending events and classes, transferring activities to the Internet, undertaking interactive communication with recipients, reorganising intramural work, and finally actively joining the fight against coronavirus. The stage of lifting the restrictions caused by the epidemic made it possible to gradually resume the activities of the cultural institutions, and the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage has published guidelines for their further operation. The experiences of the first period of the epidemic may be a lesson for the future that could be used by those responsible for cultural institutions.\n\nThe article analyzes the features of organizing and holding art festivals under the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that are relevant to the present. The significant role of digitalization and virtualization of works of art in the above processes is revealed. External challenges stimulated the search for new forms of organizing artistic events, as happened, for example, with The Virtual Collaborative Series, which became a temporary adapted version of the named annual event. We believe that a significant role in the process of searching for new communication strategies was played by technologies that make it possible to overcome spatial restrictions in the context of communication during a pandemic, in particular, we are talking about platforms for direct communication in the presence mode, etc.\n\nIn the last months a pandemic has changed the daily life of billions of people Among the efforts to reduce the impact of the disease, social distancing has had huge consequences and raised may concerns, from the inadequacy of contemporary urban design to the social inequality of national and regional lockdown This paper focuses on the consequences that this experience is having on the design of urban public and private areas Everybody admits that our cities are going to change but, beside the first quick adaptation to social distancing, it is unclear how to rethink today&#39;s urban areas We start from our previous work on the classification of architectural rules and on the study of how creativity is expressed via architectural rules, to discuss the principles and social aspects of newly proposed designs The motivation for this analysis is to investigate and raise awareness of the consequences of changes in social practices: given that we are in need for new structures and service ...\n\nThe globally experienced suspension of cultural life brought about by the COVID-19 crisis has been duly acknowledged and discussed in a growing number of publications, reports, and online seminars, most often in terms of the impact of COVID-19 on the music/culture industry. Despite the worsening pandemic situation in Switzerland and elsewhere during the autumn of 2020, I happened to be conducting field research in the city of St. Gallen (in north-eastern Switzerland) where the authorities opted for a ‘liberal’ handling of the health crisis. As a result, the city’s live music venue ‘Palace’, where I was doing my fieldwork observations, remained open to the public as late as mid-December 2020, albeit with shortened opening hours and with a dancing ban. This allowed me to gain first-hand fieldwork experience during the pandemic’s significant constraints on social behaviour. The present article accordingly addresses the ethical dilemmas that I encountered when operating in this ‘grey zone’ of field research, while also documenting the challenges and adjustments that the Palace venue had to undergo during pandemic times from the perspectives of producers, musicians, and audiences alike. The article specifically focuses on grasping and analysing changes in the experience of the Palace’s sociality and spatiality under social distancing rules. Ultimately, this work provides a different angle on the existing body of music-cultural research, which largely focuses on the cancellations and transformations of music events into virtual gatherings.\n\nTo face the COVID19 pandemic, cities have taken short term actions. Streets have been closed to traffic during weekends to enable temporary playgrounds or car lanes have been transformed into bike lanes or used to enlarge sidewalks following tactical urbanism practices. Time has appeared as a main factor in the management of public space (defining timeslots to exit to the street or trying to avoid peak hours in public transportation by extending the starting and ending working times). Technologies have been key, enabling online work, virtual gatherings and creative activities, as well as developing applications for better tracing the disease or enforcing the lockdown regulations. But what will be the lasting effects of these measures in the long-term transformations of cities? This commentary was written in May 2020, in the middle of a total lockdown in Barcelona. It is based on the events, reflections and public opinion reactions at this precise moment in this particular place. It ...\n\nWith the COVID-19 global pandemic, several governments across the world instated curfews, quarantines and various other forms of social restrictions such as stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. These measures not only severely affected artists and culture professionals as arts and culture facilities were closed to the public, but they also impacted the link between the arts and the local communities. Urban Sketchers (USk) is a movement engaging a global community of artists and amateurs who gather in local communities to practice drawing on location. As an international movement, its influence has spread across several countries and cities, contributing to formal and informal gatherings to capture the dialogues and interactions with the community and its relations with the community space. This paper examines the notions of globality and locality in their relations to the artistic expressions in the physical and virtual space. It also reflects on the expanded field of community arts under the context of social restrictions.\n\nThis essay discusses a deep malaise of contemporary architecture, made more obvious by experiencing COVID-19 lockdowns for several months. Evidence-based arguments urge society to improve human health and well-being by re-considering the design of interior and exterior spaces. So far, predictions of how design will “improve” after COVID-19 just continue business-as-usual, ignoring accumulated evidence. Yet, the negative emotional experience of families cooped up during the pandemic reveals the failure of the standard approach to designing spaces. An architecture that adapts to human biology and psychology starts with the relatively new understanding of people interacting unconsciously with their environment and broadens it. A traditional design toolkit, augmented by the latest technology, can generate healing spaces as judged by their ability to enhance users’ subjective well-being. We recommend implementing specific design innovations to achieve this goal—replacing industrial-minim...\n\nOn 8-13 February 2020 City Space Architecture, the publisher of The Journal of Public Space, participated in the 10th World Urban Forum in Abu Dhabi as an exhibitor, and in collaboration with 16 global institutions promoted the exhibition &#39;PUBLIC SPACE IS VITAL FOR AN EQUITABLE URBAN FUTURE&#39;. On April 7, while about 40% of global population was under coronavirus lockdown, City Space Architecture and the School of Architecture at The Chinese University of Hong Kong jointly announced the online initiative &#39;2020: A Year without Public Space under the COVID-19 Pandemic&#39; through The Journal of Public Space: after one month of consultation, by email and through online meetings, with academic scholars and colleagues from different geographical locations, we, public space scholars and activists, felt the urgency to build social and health resilience by establishing an open environment for discussion and learning, while taking advantage of technology and virtual platforms tha..."
