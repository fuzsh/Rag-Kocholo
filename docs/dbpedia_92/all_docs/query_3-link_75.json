        "text": "Nevada Heat (Matt Cimber, 1982)\n\nA clash of styles if I've ever seen one–and believe me, I have seen some doozies over the years–Nevada Heat (a.k.a. Fake-Out) pits the flamboyant gayness of Bob Mackie (\"the sultan of sequins, the rajah of rhinestones,\" as his bio states) and the needs and wants of millions upon millions of discerning, women in prison movie-loving heterosexual men and their lesbian allies up against Telly Savalas' crippling gambling addiction. Who do you think won out in the end? Let me give you a hint: He's bald, he doesn't give a flying fuck, and he has a habit of ending his sentences with the word \"baby.\" That's right, Telly Savalas. He doesn't care about the length of the slit on Pia Zadora's sequin-adorned Bob Mackie original, nor does he care about the structural integrity of the erection/wetness you plan on unfurling/oozing while trying to imagine what the atmospheric conditions must have been like inside Pia Zadora's prison issue leotard as she thrust her dainty crotch to-and-fro in the gymnasium tucked away inside the South Nevada Correctional Facility, Telly's in Las Vegas and he's got some gambling to do. In fact, you're lucky you got any scenes at all that didn't involve Telly Savalas blowing his immense wad at the craps table. Hell, I think I even saw him drop five hundred smackaroos on a total strangers roll of the dice. Enough about that follically challenged, degenerate gambler, this cinematic endeavour, co-written and directed by Matt Cimber, is, make no mistake, a Pia Zadora film. My eyeballs crave a steady diet of Pia Zadora, and that's what they get in Nevada Heat, not only one of the premiere films in the extensive canon of Pia Zadora masterpieces, but a film that boasts one of the best car/foot chases ever to involve a transwoman wielding an uzi and a pistol-packing member of the Arnaz dynasty.\n\nI won't lie, my life would be a hundred times better if it had some Pia Zadora in it. Someone, not me, of course, should clone Pia Zadora in a laboratory in Switzerland–you know, like a Shetland pony. Except, inside of shedding fur, she would give me a handjob every Thursday. Are you sure you want to be telling everyone this? Why not? My feelings about Pia Zadora are well documented. Yeah, but going on and on about the gingham shirt she wore in The Lonely Lady or babbling incessantly about her scrunchies in Voyage of the Rock Aliens is one thing. You're on the cusp of crossing that line that separates playfully creepy from mentally defective creepy.\n\nOn the cusp, eh? Well, thanks for the warning. I'll take what you said under advisement. In meantime, I've got a Pia Zadora film to review.\n\nShould all films open with Pia Zadora, smashingly sheathed in a Bob Mackie designed stunner of an outfit, singing \"Those Eyes\" in a Las Vegas nightclub? Of course not. But I think most people will agree that every Pia Zadora film should open this way. And in terms of delivering the Pia Zadora singing \"Those Eyes\" in a Las Vegas nightclub goods, Nevada Heat delivers. Excuse me, but doesn't the film actually open with a casino boss being shot in the parking lot by an elderly woman wielding a shotgun? Man, why did you have go and say that? I mean, I had this thing going about how Pia Zadora films should open with Pia Zadora singing in a nightclub. Why don't you just pretend the scene with the casino boss being shot never happened? Excellent idea.\n\nThrowing the audience, a half-awake throng of degenerate gamblers, mobsters, and cocaine freaks, a thoughtful gaze, Bobbie Warren (Pia Zadora), nightclub singer/gangster's moll/full-time cutie pie, begins to sing \"Those Eyes.\" And, as most of you know, the song starts off sort of slow. But it gets gradually faster as the song progresses. The sequin-adorned songtress signifies to the saps in the audience that the song's tempo is about to increase by doing this twitchy thing with her right leg. As the sparkly strands of garish dress material crash violently against her crotch and upper thighs as a direct result of her spastic movements, which include, spinning, humping, shaking, and kicking, we can't help notice that Telly Savalas is lurking about backstage.\n\nDid you say, Telly Savalas? This can't be good. And you know what? It isn't. Slapping a pair of handcuffs on her the moment she's finished singing her closing number, Telly, whose character's name, by the way, is Thurston, Lt. Thurston, takes her way. What could have Pia Zadora, I mean, Bobbie Warren have done to warrant being arrested by Telly Savalas? It's not what Bobbie did, it's what her mobster boyfriend did. You see, the state believes Bobbie knows something about a murder her boyfriend is alleged to have carried out, and they want her to testify against him. And since Bobbie won't testify against him, the state of Nevada decides to throw her surprisingly shapely ass into, you guessed it, the South Nevada Correctional Facility for contempt of court.\n\nAnswer me this, fans of Pia Zadora, fashion, and continuity: How come Pia Zadora is wearing a brown jacket with a western motif when she's in the warden's office, yet when she's being taken to her cell moments later, she is clearly wearing a dark tube top? And, no, I don't think she was wearing the tube top underneath the jacket. Colour me flummoxed as all get out.\n\nFashion confusion aside, I felt bad for Pia Zadora when she enters her cell for the first time, as her aura oozes sadness.\n\nWe jump forward three months in Bobbie's sentence to find that she has quickly become the prison's star aerobics instructor. Would I have liked to have seen how Bobbie Warren went from being mopey and sad to thrusting and heaving her leotard-ensnared crotch in front of a bunch of butch female inmates? You bet I would. But I also have to accept the fact that Nevada Heat isn't a women in prison film. Anyway, watching Pia Zadora stretch and kick in her leotard made me want to grab her and put her in my pocket. Which I hear is the most common reaction to the sight of Pia Zadora doing aerobics in a prison setting.\n\nDespite her enthusiasm, it's obvious that Bobbie is starting to lose her fellow inmates. Even though she tells them to hurl their crotches in various directions (\"front, back, right, left\"), most of them are too busy fighting amongst themselves to listen to her instructions. And to make matters worse, some of the inmates confront Bobbie later on in the shower. You mean to tell me that Nevada Heat has an aerobics sequence and a shower scene? Are you sure this isn't a women in prison film?\n\nBeing sexually assaulted by a smattering of rough-looking chicks is apparently what pushes Bobbie over the edge. Sure, her mobster boyfriend has tried to make her stay in the pokey as comfortable as possible (her cell looks like a successful pimp's living room), but she wants out. Isn't she worried about her mobster boyfriend? I mean, it's obvious, judging by the amount of stuff he's sent her, that he wants her to stay in prison. Yeah, but the incident in the shower seemed to rattle her. While part of me doesn't want her to leave, (Pia Zadora + Incarceration + Aerobics = Cinematic Gold), I totally understand her decision.\n\nYou can tell Bobbie was really traumatized by her time in prison just by listening to her talk during the car ride home–and by \"home,\" I mean the Riviera Hotel and Casino. Why, what does she say? Well, for starters, she mentions the desire to take a bath twice. In fact, you'll notice she mentions wanting to take a bath quite a few times over the course of the film. At first, I thought it was just a character quirk that writer-director Matt Cimber added to give Bobbie some extra pizazz. Now, you wouldn't think Pia Zadora would need any \"extra pizazz,\" she's fucking Pia Zadora. You got that right. No, actually, the bathing-centric character trait pays off at the end of the film in a way that will blow your mind.\n\nAccompanying Bobbie to the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas is Lt. Telly Savalas and some square detective named Clint Morgan (Desi Arnaz, Jr.), who have been assigned to protect her until she takes the stand. Of course, Bobbie thinks all this hubbub is totally unnecessary. In her mind, her mobster boyfriend wouldn't hurt her. Oh yeah, then how come two shady-looking fellas carrying a suspicious-looking briefcase have booked the room directly across from yours? Unfortunately, Bobbie doesn't seem to notice them. And why should she? Fresh out of prison, Pia Zadora has got places to go and things to see. Not so fast, Missy. After being allowed to play one round of Keno (a game Telly calls a \"tourist trap\"), Bobbie is confined to her hotel room. Boo!\n\nWhile brushing her hair (you can tell she's upset by the frustrated nature of her brush strokes), Bobbie tells Clint that she wants to take a bath. On the one hand, the reason she mentions wanting to take a bath is, like I said, a subtle reminder for the audience to remember that she prefers baths. Yet, she also mentions it in order to shake Clint's resolve. Think about it, you're a man stuck in a hotel room looking after a bath mad Pia Zadora. Are you telling me that your mind is not going start imagining what Pia Zadora's soft, pruny undercarriage is gonna taste like after its been soaking in soapy water for ten, maybe twenty minutes? If your mind doesn't imagine that, then I'm afraid there's no hope for you. I'm sorry.\n\nWhen the bath thing doesn't work, Bobbie plays the jailbait card while a waiter is bringing a tray of wine to their room. Given her size, Pia Zadora can pretend to be fourteen years-old at the drop of a hat. And does so in order to make Clint look like a pervert in front of the aforementioned waiter. While it might seem like an asinine thing to do, it does lay the groundwork for Clint to decide to take Bobbie dress shopping.\n\nOf course, they can't get much with twenty dollars, so Bobbie suggests they go to the blackjack table to win some quick cash to buy a new dress (all her old clothes still smell like prison). It would seem that her system for winning involves saying the word \"blackjack\" over and over again. And, hey, it seems to work, much to the chagrin of Buddy Lester, the other player at Pia and Clints's table, who can't seem to catch a break.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm dying to know what kind of dress Bobbie is going to purchase with all that blackjack money. In fact, the whole dress subplot is the film's most suspenseful. Why's that, you ask? Isn't it obvious? She's got to get past Larry Storch. And, as most people know, Larry Storch is not someone you get past so easily.\n\nPlaying Ted King, the manager of Michelle (G. Wesley Stevens), an up and coming actress, Larry Storch injects some much needed life into the proceedings with his seedy portrayal of a clownish man in a checkered jacket. You would think it would be Telly's job to inject life into this things, but he seems too busy gambling and grabbing the asses of unsuspecting casino waitresses.\n\nDon't worry I haven't forgotten about Pia Zadora's new dress. It's a low cut pink number with a mild slit down the side, and she looks stunning in it. As you might expect, the film's focus shifts away from the dress, as the infamous scene where a man on foot chases a car containing Larry Storch and a transwoman firing an uzi from the passenger side window takes precedence. I don't think I've ever seen a man chase a car on foot before. And I'll admit, I did make me forget about Pia Zadora for a few seconds. Which is the highest praise something that is non-Pia Zadora-related can get in this crazy, Pia-obsessed world.\n\nvideo uploaded by AussieRoadshow\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMassacre in Dinosaur Valley (Michele Massimo Tarantini, 1985)\n\nAs I sit down to type words pertaining to my impromptu screening of Massacre in Dinosaur Valley, the Brazil-set jungle adventure film directed by an Italian, Michele Massimo Tarantini of Women in Fury fame, and starring an American, Michael something, the word \"upskirt\" is bouncing around inside my head like a superball. The reason being, I want to make sure that I remember it as I go forward with the word typing. It plays, as you will soon find out, a vital role when it comes to the film's overall distribution of enjoyment and other enjoyment-related products. You're joking, right? How could anyone forget to mention the word \"upskirt\"? I know, you'll probably come across millions of essays and dissertations that tackle this film that don't even bother to mention the film's flagrant upskirt abuse. But you have to remember, the people who wrote those articles are not normal. I, on the other hand, ooze normalcy. And not only that, I am able to spot upskirt abuse with my eyes closed. Upskirt abuse: What is it? And how does one spot it? Well, the former is easy, as it simply refers to the view you get when you look up a woman's skirt, or a man's skirt, or a skirt on a transwoman, for that matter (everyone wears skirts nowadays). Hence, the slapping together of the words \"up,\" meaning something that is up as supposed to down, and \"skirt,\" which is, to quote Lattis from The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, a kind of \"inverted cloth funnel.\" Okay, that solves the upskirt part of the equation. But what about the abuse? When does that occur? Discounting videos that are designed to cater directly to the upskirt community, I'd say upskirt abuse occurs somewhere around the third upskirt. Just the third? I thought you were gonna say, oh, something like, the sixth or the seventh. Oh, no. No, No, No. One upskirt is just that, one upskirt. Enjoy the view. Two upskirts is, well, that's probably an accident (or an \"upskirtccident\" as it isn't called). When you spot the third upskirt, you know something is up (no pun intended).\n\nSomewhere out there a deeply flummoxed Michael Sopkiw (the American I alluded to earlier) is probably wondering to himself: Why on earth is this guy talking so much about upskirts? I mean, I wield a shotgun and have sex with Brazilian women, and not even in that order. Patience, Mr. Sopkiw, patience. I'll get to you in a moment. And besides, can't you see that I'm trying to make a point (one that could be viewed as salient) about the amount of upskirt abuse that takes place in this film.\n\nOkay, where was I? Oh, yes. Something is definitely up when you spot a third upskirt. I'm curious, actually, I'm dying to know, how many upskirts are in Massacre in Dinosaur Valley? Are you sitting down? Oh, and before you sit down, make sure to cross your legs. You wouldn't want some pervert to catch a glimpse of your freshly laundered panties, now would you? But seriously, are you sitting down? All right, I counted a total of eleven upskirts. Eleven?!? You heard me, eleven. It's not even funny. Eleven. Are you sure about that? Let me see, one, two, three, four...yep, eleven.\n\nHow many upskirt shots does Star Wars have? I'll tell you how many: Zero. Okay. And how many upskirt shots does Massacre in Dinosaur Valley have? Say it with me: eleven. Yeah, but Princess Leia wears a gold bikini in the Return of the Jedi. Really? Well, how 'bout this, eleven.\n\nSomeone who, surprisingly, doesn't have a single upskirt moment in this film is Suzane Carvalho, the lead actress from Michele Massimo Tarantini's Women in Fury. Why's that? It's a simple matter of physics, really? Yeah, but you're a complete dumbass who knows nothing about physics. That's true. I am a dumbass. But I'm smart enough to know that even the most resourceful pervert is going to have trouble getting the upward view he or she desires when the subject's legs are in a post-crossed state. Sure, you could wait for them to be un-crossed. But look at you, you're sitting behind the subject. How are you supposed to get a glimpse of her panties from that angle? You can't. Unless you have partner who is willing to hold a mirror, you're not seeing any panties on this day.\n\nAnyway, Eva Ibañez (the name of Suzane's character), the daughter of famed paleontologist Pedro Ibañez (Leonidas Bayer), who is sitting next to her on a hot, overcrowded bus traveling through rural Brazil, is minding her own business, when, all of a sudden, she notices that two passengers sitting behind her are scoping her legs, which, like I said, are firmly crossed. Realizing that they won't be catching a sneak of peek at her soaking wet crotch, thanks to her employment of the leg cross method of sitting and their overall proximity, she lets out a sly smirk.\n\nArriving at the hotel with her box intact, Eva and her father eventually go to their room. They would have had separate rooms were it not for Robbie (Roberto Roney), a fashion photographer, and his models Belinda (Susan Hahn), a vision in a blue dress, and the sultry Monica (Gloria Cristal), who ended up taking one of their rooms (they had reserved two rooms). Also arriving at the hotel is Kevin Hall (Michael Sopkiw), an American bone hunter (he collects dinosaur bones), who shows up on the back of a banana truck.\n\nWho else is in this movie? Oh, yeah, a bickering couple, Betty Heinz (Marta Anderson, Bare Behind Bars), who looks like a demented Marilyn Monroe impersonator, and Captain Johnny (Milton Rodríguez), a grizzled veteran of the Second Indochina War, who we meet at a cock fight. A cock fight? Don't tell me, both birds die horrible deaths. Actually, the birds seemed fine. On the whole, I was surprised by the lack of animal cruelty in this film. Kudos to Mr. Tarantini for not killing animals in order to tell his story.\n\nHey, man, not killing animals is great and all, but what about those upskirts you were talking about earlier? Oh yeah, the upskirts. Well, five or six upskirts occur during a fashion shoot by the side of the road. Wow, five or six. In just one scene? That's right. Though, technically, you're going to have to watch the deleted scenes to see one of the film's best upskirt shots. It involves the gorgeous Susan Hahn–but then again, ninety percent of film's upskirt moments involve Susan Hahn–getting into the car, and it's a thing of beauty. I don't usually watch deleted scenes, but something compelled me to do so in this case. At any rate, a flurry of upskirts take place during the roadside photo shoot, as local models dressed a tribespeople poke at Belinda (black panties) and Monica (white panties) with their spears. And in doing so, create a...yep, flurry of upskirts (which amounts to something like, oh, let's say, five separate upskirts).\n\nUpskirt six belongs to Monica. Now this is her last upskirt, so make sure you take the time to enjoy it. The situation surrounding its implementation is actually quite comical, as a drunk (Paul Sky) at the aforementioned cock fight grabs the bottom of Monica's dress and proceeds to lift it up with an untoward hiking motion. Taking exception with this bit of public molestation (the drunk is slobbering all over her miracle of Brazilian booty engineering), Kevin Hall steps in and throws the drunk into some tables. Only problem being, his decision to take exception with the drunk's lewd conduct has caused the drunk's musclebound brothers (Paolo Pacelli and Norton Kays) to take exception with Kevin's exception. Don't feel sorry for Kevin, though. Sure, the drunk's musclebound brothers beat the crap out of him, but was their misguided heroism rewarded with sexual intercourse with a Brazilian model at the end of the day? I don't think so.\n\nAs a result of machinations I don't feel like getting into, Kevin, Captain Johnny, Betty, Robbie, Belinda, Monica, Eva Ibañez, Professor Pedro, and their French pilot all hop abroad a plane to a remote corner of the jungle. Okay, I understand why Kevin and Professor Pedro want to go to \"Dinosaur Valley,\" but why are the rest of them going? How 'bout this: Who gives a shit? That works for me. Crammed into the small plane like a bunch of sardines, the travelers busy themselves with various activities: Kevin eats a banana, Belinda and Monica brush their hair, and Eva and Betty exchange nasty looks.\n\nSuddenly, the plane hits a patch of turbulence and starts to hurl toward the earth. As the dinky aircraft bounces around in the sky, so do the passengers. And no one more so than Belinda, who steps up to the upskirt plate to knock upskirt #7 and upskirt #8 out of the park (wee, I just used a baseball metaphor, woo-hoo! yay!). Struggling to remain in her seat, Belinda thrashes about like a rag doll, and in doing so, gives us two peeks up her light peach dress.\n\nAfter they crash land, the survivors debate whether or not to stay with the plane. Having served three tours in 'Nam, Captain Johnny announces that he's in command, and that they're leaving. Trekking through the jungle to sound of techno pop, the survivors follow Captain Johnny, who says he's leading them to a river (don't blink or you might just miss upskirt #8 - Belinda flashes some internal skirt material while walking over a giant log). I'm telling you, this Johnny fella doesn't know what he's talking about it. I mean...Quiet. It looks like Belinda is having trouble with her shoes. Yes! It would seem that her heels are slowing her down. Say what you will about Captain Johnny's leadership skills, he sure knows how to cobble on the fly.\n\nSitting her down on a log, Captain Johnny grabs Belinda's shoe and proceeds to slice off the heel with his trusty machete.\n\nInstructing her to take off her other shoe (it only makes sense to alter both of them), Belinda lifts up her leg and slips it off her foot. In doing so, she sets in motion the events that will lead to upskirt #10.\n\nThe sight of her white panties pressing tightly against her sweaty undercarriage causes Captain Johnny temporarily lose focus on the task at hand. Noticing that Johnny is starting to lose focus, Betty says, \"Enjoying the view, Johnny boy?\" Oh, that Betty. Her emasculation skills are first-rate.\n\nAfter cutting her heels down to size, the group continue through the jungle, where they come across a bunch of heads on sticks, encounter snakes, leaches and piranhas, and engage in an epic power struggle; well, Kevin and Johnny engage in an epic power struggle, the rest just sort of watch from the sidelines.\n\nSaving the best for last, upskirt eleven, that's right, eleven, occurs when the group comes across a pool of fresh water. Diving into the water with a reckless form of abandon, the survivors splash around for awhile before eventually taking a much needed rest. Uninterested in decorum, Belinda sits in a manner that allows the world to see how her panties are holding up. And by \"world,\" I mean Johnny, who gets a second dose of Belinda's succulent drawers (lucky bastard).\n\nWas I sad when Belinda was finally forced to remove her weatherbeaten light peach dress and her put through the ringer white panties? You could say that. However, I thought Susan Hahn's innate gorgeousness, no matter what she was, or, in most cases, wasn't wearing, managed to shine through the humid haze that is Massacre in Dinosaur Valley. Reminding me of Naomi Watts, Susan Hahn must have been a real trooper, as she is captured, re-captured, groped by a frizzy-haired lesbian, chased through the jungle, rescued by Michael Sopkiw (a shotgun wielding badass if I ever saw one), almost sacrificed to a dinosaur god, shot at by a slave trader with a beer gut (Andy Silas), and has her panties are leered at multiple times by a piggish Vietnam vet, and, not to mention, Carlito (Jonas Dalbecchi), a tubby fuck who drives the models to and from their photo shoots. Speaking of Carlito, make sure to check out the aforementioned deleted scenes on the Shriek Show DVD, as they help flesh out the characters, especially Carlito, a little more.\n\nuploaded by SuperDavidgc\n\n↧\n\nNinja III: The Domination (Sam Firstenberg, 1984)\n\nWhat would you say is the best way to impress a white person in tan slacks? Oh, man, that's a tough one. Judging by the easily entertained rabble who attend NBA games on a regular basis, the forcible placement of a ball through a metal ring, or, as it's known on the street, a \"hoop,\" seems to impress them. Yeah, they do love to watch tall black men dunk basketballs. But don't you think crushing a golf ball with your bare hands would impress them even more? Think about it. That little white ball, in a way, represents their testicles. So, in turn, you're crushing their reproductive dreams. Also, the game of golf is a subtle metaphor for evils of white supremacy. I mean, who else but white people could justify such an egregious waste of land? You just blew my mind. Seriously, when the ninja assassin at the beginning of Ninja III: The Domination crushes a golf ball with his hand before dispatching one of his target's body guards, I thought he was merely showing off–you know, look what I can do. But now I realize that he was making a point about the waning influence of white people on the global stage. Okay, smart guy. How about the scene where the assassin crushes a red billiards ball with their bare hands? How do you explain that? That's easy. Since the ninja assassin's spirit has been recently transferred to the body of a white woman, they're obviously making a profound statement about the dangers of multiculturalism. What the fuck?!? I know, I know, you're going say, \"think about it.\" Well, yeah, think about it. What colour are billiards balls? Uh, um. Exactly, they're a mixture of all sorts of different colours. In other words, I rest my case.\n\nAll this talk about crushing balls is making me thirsty. Are you sure that's it as far as balls go in this film? Let me see, the crushing of the golf ball represents white supremacy and the crushing of the billiards ball represents multiculturism, so are they're any other balls? Interesting question. Actually, no it's not. As it's just those balls that are crushed. Thank heavens. Because I don't know how much longer I can refrain from mentioning the excruciating tightness of Lucinda's Dickey's leotard.\n\nYou mean to tell me that you've been blathering on and on about various types of balls being crushed when you could have been waxing semi-poetically about the sight of Lucinda Dickey playing Bouncer (an arcade game from the '80s) in white legwarmers? Is that what you're telling me? I'm afraid so. Then you my friend should be asham...Wait a second, you know what? I'm going to take it easy on you this time. Just promise me that you'll use the phrase \"mouth-watering\" to describe Lucinda Dickey's spandex-ensnared crotch in the not-so distant future. Why would I use the term \"mouth-watering\" to describe her, what did you call it? Oh yeah, \"spandex-ensnared crotch,\" in a review about this film? Isn't it about ninjas and junk? Oh, you'll see. Okay, if you say so. Anyway, sure, I promise to use phrase \"mouth-watering\" in conjunction with a crotch that's been inexplicably ensnared in spandex.\n\nWhen one of the first things you see onscreen are the words \"A Golan-Globus Production\" you know you're for a cinematic treat. However, it was the credit \"Synthesizer Score by Udi Harpaz and Misha Segal\" that got me all in a tizzy. Do I know who Udi and Misha are? Of course not. No, it was the phrase \"synthesizer score\" that set my tizzy in motion, as I've never seen a movie where the music is listed that way. And since I love synthesizer scores, I was dying to hear what Udi and Misha had to offer as far as...you know, synthesizer scores go.\n\nAs the dawn breaks in the desert, a golfer and a ninja were about to collide with one another; a collision that will have a profound affect on the well-being of countless individuals across the greater Phoenix area. The golfer, surrounded by body guards, and accompanied by his wife, is about to tee off, when suddenly, a ninja appears from the bushes. Picking up the errant ball the golfer's body guards were trying to locate, the ninja shows it to one of the body guards before crushing it with his hand. Dispatching the body guards with an alarming ease, the ninja then moves toward the golfer in a menacing fashion. After thwarting his pathetic attempt to flee in a golf cart, the ninja kills the golfer and his wife with his trusty sword.\n\nThe ninja's plan of attack was a flawless example of how to properly to kill a golfer (it was stealthy perfection, if you ask me). On the other hand, his escape plan needs a little work. Minutes after taking out the golfer, the Municipal Golf Course is swarming with cops. Killing about thirty of them, including three aboard a helicopter (this is one spry ninja), the ninja (David Chung) is finally surrounded by five cops wielding guns. Blasting him with everything they've got, the cops riddle the ninja with bullets. Yet, after the dust clears, the ninja is nowhere to be found.\n\nWhere did the ninja go? Oh, wait a minute, there he is. Staggering through the shrubbery, the ninja stumbles across Christie (Lucinda Dickey), a telephone repairwoman. Well, actually, it's Christie who stumbles upon the injured ninja. On top of being a telephone repairwoman (the kind that climb up and down poles), Christie is a member of the Give a Ninja a Helping Hand Foundation, a non-profit organization set up to help ninjas in need. And judging by the way he's staggering, this is one ninja who could use a helping hand. Of course, ninjas aren't the easiest people to help, so when Christie tries to assist the wounded ninja (who must have been shot over a hundred times), he's a tad standoffish.\n\nRealizing that the shapely telephone repairwoman standing before him is trying to help, the ninja offers Christie his sword. After mumbling something in Japanese, the ninja dies. As she's holding the ninja's sword, Christie starts to see visions of the cops who shot the ninja. Which, as most people would agree, is not something that should be happening; in that, they're not her memories, they're the ninjas. Or are they?\n\nAfter being questioned at police headquarters, Christie is harassed by a cop named Billy Secord (Jordan Bennett). Hitting on her in an aggressive manner, Christie finally puts her foot down and tells him that she doesn't date cops (you tell him, sister). I don't know 'bout you, but I really dislike this Secord fella. There's something about him that makes my skin crawl.\n\nClimbing telephone poles all day and coming to the aid of wounded ninjas is hard work. So, can you blame Christie for wanting to unwind a bit? I didn't. And what better way to do so than to play video games in aerobics gear. As the camera pans down Lucinda Dickey's frame, her mouth-watering crotch laughing in the face of the tight layer of spandex currently inundating the smooth nooks and crannies of its forked housing, as she played \"Bouncer,\" a sense of relief washes over me. Why so? Well, I had no interest in watching an action-packed ninja film that shunned Lucinda's Dickey's spandex-ensnared pussy area. Which is what I thought this film, directed by Sam Firstenberg, was going to be; yet another ninja film that fails to cater to any of my freakishly specific needs and requirements. But like I said, those fears were quickly cast aside once we enter Christie's killer pad.\n\nAn inordinate amount of praise has to go to production designer Elliot Ellentuck and set decorator Dian Perryman for the work they did in creating Lucinda Dickey's loft in Ninja III: The Domination, as her place is filled with dozens of unique pieces. Items in Christie's loft that caught my fancy: the industrial spool coffee table, the flight suit by the door, the wind turbine roof vent atop her fridge, the Patrick Nagel poster, the neon signs, the light pink Japanese-style blinds, the vintage lucite table, and, of course, the video arcade game.\n\nYou would think that working for Metro Telephone and helping wayward ninjas would eat up most of Christie's time. Think again. A buttery concourse of dimple-free crotches are thrust in our faces as we enter the gym where Christie works as an aerobics instructor. Barking exercise-based language at her students, Christie oozes fitness from every pore. As the lyrically apt \"Body Shop\" by Dave Powell is doing its best to induce us to sweat on the soundtrack, we can't help but notice that Officer Secord has decided to take Christie's class.\n\nWhen the class is over, Christie notices four or five thugs harassing one of Christie's female students in the alleyway behind the gym. It would seem that she likes to help out non-ninjas as well, as Christie comes to the woman's aide. If you're thinking to yourself that Christie is no match for these guys. Don't worry, Christie makes short work of them. But get this, Officer Secord was watching as she almost got manhandled by five musclebound gym members. That's right, he just stood there. And to make matters worse, Officer Secord tells Christie that he could have her arrested for assault. What the...If anyone should be arrested, it's you. Um, hello? Dereliction of duty much? I don't care if you were off duty. What kind of man sits idly by and watches an aerobics instructor (one whose tightly packaged crotch brings so much joy to so many) get almost beaten up by a bunch of roided up neanderthals? I'll tell you what kind, the asshole kind.\n\nDespite what I just said, Christie takes Officer Secord back to her stylish pad and has him drink V8 off her neck. I'm curious, did this untoward display cause use to lose any respect for Christie? Not really. I mean, sure, I don't like Officer Secord. But maybe there's more to him than meets the eye. He could, after all, have a nice cock. Yeah, but nice cock or no nice cock, did you see his shoulders? I know, he looks like an ape. And what's with the sleeveless shirts? Seriously. Someone with shoulders like that should never wear anything that doesn't come with sleeves.\n\nIf you thought Christie's apartment looked awesome before, wait until you see it when its been bathed in a thick layer of ninja mist. Oh, and don't bother checking my spelling, I said, ninja mist. You know, the mist caused by the spirit of a dead ninja? Anyway, the spirit of the dead ninja from the opening scene wants to live on through the body of, you guessed it, Christie, and does so through his sword.\n\nBeckoning her from her closet, the dead ninja's sword floats around the room for awhile, until finally resting in Christie's hands. And since dead ninjas are famous for holding grudges, Christie must avenge the dead ninja by killing the cops responsible for his death, because she is now...ninja! She even knows where to find the dead ninja's super-secret stash of ninja goodies. Though, I don't remember seeing a black one-piece bathing suit in the super-secret ninja stash (Christie uses its thigh-accentuating tightness to kill one of the cops and a couple of floozies at a local health spa).\n\nDoes this mean Christie is going to kill Officer Secord? After all, he was one of the cops present when the dead ninja was killed. You bet it does. Woo-hoo! That being said, you just know that Officer Secord is going to be the one who stands in the way of her actualization as a ninja. And wouldn't you know it, he's taking her to see James Hong to get a ninjorcism (it's like an exorcism for ninjas) as we speak.\n\nWhich reminds me. Check this out, as Christie is taking her one way trip to Lindablairsville (Population: \"Your mother sucks cocks in Hell!\"), she utters the line, \"You fool! Nothing can stop me! I am the nin...ja!\" Pretty standard stuff as far as ninjorcisms go, right? Yeah, but get this, Officer Secord then says, \"Ninja? I wanna know what that is.\" Hold the phone, what kind of person doesn't know what a ninja is? Granted, things would be different if it was, say, oh, 1934 (a ninja-less hellhole not replete with ninjas). But this is 1984, and ninjas are fucking everywhere.\n\nIf given the choice between watching Lucinda Dickey work out to new wave music in nothing but white panties and a pink t-shirt, or, say, watching Sho Kosugi (a ninja with an eye-patch) kick orderlies in the face, I will always choose the former. But thankfully, Ninja III: The Domination dispenses both in a manner that I found both tolerable and acceptable. It's true, some of the fight scenes were repetitive, especially the final showdown. But the film's bizarre The Exorcist meets Heavenly Bodies temperament was enough to allow me to look past its cliches, and enjoy it as the dumb action movie that it truly is.\n\nCan you believe that Officer Secord? What's a ninja? Hee-hee. What an asshat. An asshat who is currently lapping up the figurative contents swirling around Lucinda Dickey's mouth-watering crotch. I hate you, Officer Secord. You hairy-shouldered bastard.\n\nvideo uploaded by gonebats\n\n↧\n\nSkinner (Ivan Nagy, 1993)\n\nIf the sight of Ted Raimi, brother of Drag Me to Hell director Sam Raimi, running around a vacant lot to industrial music wearing the skin of another man wasn't messed up enough. The makes of Skinner, the only film in existence to feature Traci Lords' little seen Carl McCoy impression, have decided to up the ante a couple octaves by having Ted Raimi run around a vacant lot to industrial music while wearing the skin of a black man. Taking \"blackface\" to whole new level of creepy and awkward, Ted Raimi totally wears a suit made entirely from the skin of a black man. It's true, he does wear the skin of white women as well. But there's something really disturbing about the sight of a white man wearing the skin of a black man. The fact that he acts out what he interrupts as \"black mannerisms\" is what makes the scene even more disturbing. What's so disturbing about that, you ask? You're joking, right? Sure, wearing other people's skin is sick and twisted, but people, especially white people, act out the mannerisms of other races and cultures all the time. Anytime you hear a white man say the word \"yo\" while wearing a baseball hat that's been purposefully positioned to sit atop his head in an irregular manner, they're just imitating what they saw a black man do on television. Wow, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound creepy and awkward at all. Exactly. What Ted Raimi's character is doing is he's just taking cultural co-option one step further. Forget about wearing their clothes, adopting their mannerisms, or even burrowing their language, the evolution of white people will involve skin theft. Mark my words, human skin will be a major commodity in the not-so distant future.\n\nI don't mean to be rude, but I didn't understand a word you just said. Yeah, I can see that; after all, it's pretty ridiculous as far as theories go. Actually, my lack of understanding had nothing to do with your theory; which, looking back at it, is, like you said, pretty ridiculous. No, I lost the plot somewhere around the time you uttered the line, \"Traci Lords' little seen Carl McCoy impression.\" In fact, that's exactly when I started to tune out. Why's that? Are you for real? You don't mention Traci Lords and Carl McCoy in the same sentence and expect people to simple shrug their shoulders and go about their business.\n\nDo people even know who Traci Lords and Carl McCoy are? Okay, now you're stating to annoy me. Sorry about that. But seriously, do people know who Carl McCoy is? Probably not. However, I bet Traci Lords knows who he is. While watching MTV some time in the early 1990s, Traci happened upon a music video for a band called the Fields of the Nephilim. And while watching the video (for, I'm guessing, the song \"Moonchild\"), Traci thought to herself: Man, my pussy is sore. And, after getting an ice pack from the freezer, she thought to herself again: If I ever get the chance to play a woman who desperately wants to exact revenge on a serial killer who tried to steal her skin, I'm going to use Carl McCoy, their charismatic frontman, as my inspiration.\n\nStanding in the middle of a stream, Traci Lords raises her head and mutters the line, \"He'll come back here...he's a creature of habit.\" You'll notice as she raises her head to say that line that Traci Lords is wearing the perfect hat for dramatic head raising. A black hat with a wide brim, one that is adorned with netting, Traci's hat practically screams Fields of the Nephilim. While her hat is screaming, \"Out of mind / A righteous dream\" (the lyrics to the aforementioned \"Moonchild\"), Traci's body language is giving off a decidedly Stevie Nicks vibe. Okay, so Traci's hat is Carl McCoy of the Fields of the Nephilim, and her body language is Stevie Nicks. Is that it? Let me see. Oh, and the way Traci's hair fell over her face reminded of Veronica Lake's famous peekaboo hairstyle.\n\nIt's obvious that Traci Lords is harbouring a grudge against someone. Who that someone isn't so clear. Though, I have a feeling it might be Ted Raimi, who we see wandering the very same stream we saw Traci Lords doing her Carl McCoy/Stevie Nicks/Veronica Lake impression. Wearing a pair of black Converse sneakers and carrying a bag of knives, Ted Raimi's Dennis Skinner seems to have a thing for water. Water?!? That's what I said. Anyway, as he's walking through the stream, the music of Contagion (\"Scratch!\") can be heard on the soundtrack. An industrial band who were sort of big in the early 1990s, Contagion (who I saw open for Front Line Assembly when they were called Bioharzard PCB) provide the right amount of eerie synth sounds for the film's plethora of lurking scenes.\n\nSince he can't wander around in the water forever, Dennis Skinner shows up at Ricki Lake's house, with his big bag of knives, to inquire about the room for rent. Desperate to rent out their spare room, Ricki, I mean, Terry Tate, convinces Dennis to take the room, despite the fact that her husband, Geoff (David Warshofsky), is away being a trucker; I wonder how Geoff's going to react when he finds out that Ted Raimi is sleeping in the room down the hall?\n\nShe might look at home standing in the middle of a stream, but Traci Lords needs some place dry to spend the night as well. Given that Ricki Lake's room off the market, Traci, I mean, Miss Heidi, decides to get a room at a sleazy hotel. After grabbing the key from Eddie (Richard Schiff), the hotel's equally sleazy desk clerk (he likes industrial music and playing solitaire with nudie-cutie playing cards), Heidi limps to her room. Carrying a briefcase filled with syringes, Heidi takes the newspaper she just picked up and proceeds to cover the room's mirror with the pages; I guess she doesn't like to look at herself.\n\nThe newspaper Traci's character picks up, by the way, was the only real proof that the outside world exists in this film. Taking place in a universe that seemed otherworldly at times, the characters appear, in some ways, to be the only people on earth. Whether this was done on purpose or not is irrelevant, as the effect it creates is rather disquieting. Whenever I see extras in films I always wonder who are they are, and, in some cases, make up elaborate backstories for them. In Skinner, however, there are no extras, the film's realm belongs to the characters and to them alone. My favourite realm is the graffiti-laden concrete river bed that Dennis Skinner likes to wander in his spare time.\n\nReplete with prostitutes, the graffiti-laden (the artists who tagged the walls have long since died as a result of drug overdoses) concrete river bed is a veritable candy store. Except, instead of candy, this store mostly stocks stocking-clad sex workers. Asking a hooker wearing a white mini-skirt and black fishnets if she's \"for sale,\" Dennis Skinner and the brunette prostitute head off to conduct their business in a more secluded area (though, you can't get more secluded than a graffiti-laden concrete river bed).\n\nOh, and by \"their business\" I mean, flaying. In other words, someone is going to get flayed tonight. Don't you mean \"laid\"? No, no, \"flay.\" You see, this Dennis fella is a serial killer, one who removes the skin of his victims, sews the pieces together, and wears them like a suit. That's gross. Yeah, I guess it is. But as far as graphic footage of this act goes, we're spared from seeing any of the grisly details, for now. A quick shot of a knife slicing into flesh and a bloodcurdling scream is all we get for the brunette in the white mini-skirt.\n\nAs you would expect, Geoff isn't too pleased to find that a creepier-than-usual Ted Raimi has moved into his house. This causes to Geoff to rebuff Ricki Lake's sexual advances; are you insane, man? Look at her! She's wearing nothing but an oversize white t-shirt. Speaking of impromptu nightclothes, Traci Lords is currently writhing, Lina Romay-style, on her bed. In an earlier scene, we see that Traci's legs and arms are covered in bumpy lesions; hence her decision to wear knee-high boots and opera gloves at all times. When she's not writhing or injecting herself with drugs, Traci is either starring angrily at a picture of Dennis Skinner she carries around with her or wading ankle deep in a nearby stream.\n\nThe reason Heidi is always hanging out down by the water is because she knows Dennis Skinner will show up there sooner of later, as he seems drawn to water.\n\nI don't know what it is about the graffiti-laden concrete river bed that attracts prostitutes, but Dennis Skinner stumbles upon yet another one while wandering around down there. Unlike his previous encounter, this prostitute approaches Dennis (she seemingly appears out of nowhere), asking him if he's \"looking for a girl\"? Wearing a pink dress and black stockings, the prostitute gives Dennis the lowdown on the service she provides and their respective costs. Rattling through the usual choices, Dennis' eyes light up when she says, \"kinky is extra.\" Curious, Dennis asks, \"How much is extra\"? To which she responds, \"Depends on how kinky.\" I know, this is awesome stuff.\n\nYou think that's awesome, eh? Check out what happens next. Just as the prostitute, who is slightly older than your average streetwalker, is about to take her stockings off, Dennis says, \"No! Don't take those off.\"\n\nI get teary eyed just thinking about how correct Dennis was to prevent the prostitute from removing her stockings. The reason I brought up the fact that this particular prostitute more advanced in years was because I thought, given the amount of experience she's had on the street, that she would be smart enough to not allow Ted Raimi to tie her up. I know, she stated that kinky was one of her specialties. But still, you don't let Ted Raimi tie you up; no good can come from it. I mean, weren't you a tad alarmed by the fact that he brought his own rope?\n\nWell, it's too late now, as Dennis Skinner has just emerged from the bathroom wearing the skin that used to be attached to the body of one of her hooker peers. And, like I said, no good can come from this.\n\nAfter finishing his nightly allotment of creepily lurking in the moonlight without the aid of a shirt, Dennis Skinner searches the graffiti-laden concrete river bed for another prostitute. When he does find one, a blonde in a tight pink dress and black stockings, Heidi is waiting for him. While her sting operation doesn't go quite as planned, Dennis Skinner now knows that Heidi is gunning for him. However, that doesn't stop him from removing the prostitute in pink's skin. And unlike his previous encounters, her flaying in shown in graphic detail. Talking aloud while removing the hooker's back skin, Dennis Skinner gives us a little insight into the inner workings of his warped mind.\n\nIn case you're wondering why the skinned hooker's pimps aren't out there protecting their product from a crazed, water-obsessed Ted Raimi, the prostitutes do eventually seem to get wise and avoid the graffiti-laden concrete river bed. Nevertheless, that doesn't seem to stop a seemingly random cavalcade of attractive women from entering the flaying fray, as a brunette in a floral dress is unceremoniously dumped there by her boyfriend.\n\nOozing–no scratch that. Percolating–nah, I don't like that either. Drenched–that will do for now–in enough foreboding atmosphere to keep even the most jaded of slasher fans happy, director Ivan Nagy (ex-boyfriend of Heidi Fleiss) has created a wonderfully ominous world filled with dark nooks and shadowy crannies. Which is pretty amazing when you think about it, as the film has basically just three locations: Ricki Lake's house, Traci Lords' hotel room, and Ted Raimi's graffiti-laden playground on the wrong side of the tracks. It just goes to show that you don't need lots of money to make an effective horror film. All you really need is Ricki Lake (whose character seems to dress like a twelve year-old girl, one who is constantly forced to go church), Traci Lords (who gives a brave performance as the damaged Heidi - \"brave\" because her bread and butter - her smoking hot bod - has been blemished on purpose), Ted Raimi (a man who does creepy right), and an unending concourse of stocking-clad prostitutes and dumped girlfriends (Blaire Baron, Roberta Eaton, Christina Engelhardt, Frederika Kesten and Sara Lee Froton). Get them and the film will pretty much direct itself. It also helps to have one of your actors channeling Carl McCoy, Stevie Nicks, and Veronica Lake simultaneously.\n\nvideo uploaded by monkeyfarminc\n\n↧\n\nSatan Was a Lady (Doris Wishman, 1975)\n\nIf you don't think the sight of an exceedingly voluptuous Annie Sprinkle getting a glass of water for her sister's fiance is the height of drama, then you might want to think twice about watching Satan Was a Lady, the Doris Wishman-directed psycho-sexual thrill ride/ugly couch showcase that begs the question: Actually, the question it begs is currently not available. We ask that you please bear with us. However, if the sight of a, yeah, yeah, an exceedingly voluptuous Annie Sprinkle getting a glass of water for some guy–let's keep this thing moving–does appeal to you, then you my friend are in for a real treat. You mean to tell me there's a film out there that features an exceedingly voluptuous Annie Sprinkle getting a glass a water for a man who's about to marry her sister? I don't know. All this talk of retrieving water while being exceedingly voluptuous sounds a little too good to be true, if you know what I mean. I don't, know what you mean, that is. But I can tell you this, an exceedingly voluptuous Annie Sprinkle does in fact do exactly what I says she does in this quiet meditation on greed, sex and gaudy furniture. And not only that, but Bobby Astyr mock consumes Annie Sprinkle's pulsating pussy for five whole minutes. While I like the idea of a man sopping up the consecrated wetness congealing in the vicinity of a clean-shaven cooter, especially in 1975, a time when vaginal baldness was a bit an an anomaly, I wanna hear more about this glass of water. Are you fucking with me? The only reason I mentioned any of that business involving Annie Sprinkle (whose voluptuousness is never in doubt in this film) and the glass of water she fetches for her sister's fiance is because I'm an idiot. Or, to put it another way, I like the idea of someone taking the time to write words about a seemingly innocuous scene in a film filled with hirsute ball sacks and damp hatchet wounds.\n\nNow, the act of you, who is really me, telling me, who is really you, that you wanna hear more about the infamous glass of water scene in Satan Was a Lady is the definition of enabling. It's true, I am messing with you to a certain degree. But then again, that's what I...Hey, wait a minute. I just noticed that you put the word \"infamous\" before the words \"glass of water scene.\" How come? Well, thanks to my incessant blathering about the glass of water scene, the glass of water scene has now become, you guessed it, infamous. Truth be told, anyone can do it. Just watch a movie, preferably one that no one has heard of. Then after it's over, just type a bunch of words–you can arrange them in a manner you wish–about any scene that tickles your fancy, and, boom, you have laid the groundwork for making a movie scene infamous.\n\nSince the sight of Annie Sprinkle's curvaceous frame stomping oh-so erotically from the living room to the kitchen to get a glass of water occurs later the film, I suppose, in the meantime, I'm going to have to talk about the events that lead up to its infamous retrieval.\n\nOpening your film with a scene that features a man removing a woman's stockings is, from my perspective, the best and worst way you can begin your movie. On the one hand, you've got legs sheathed in tan stockings in your face right from the get-go. Unfortunately, the guy pawing at the woman in the tan stockings decides to remove them. If you imagine real hard, you can almost hear the perverts in the audience groaning with displeasure by this act of untoward unsheathing. What perverts? You know, the guys and gals who went to see this film when it played on 42nd Street throughout the mid-to-late 1970s.\n\nOh, how I would have loved to have attended the premiere of Satan Was a Lady back when it opened in New York City in 1975; the atmosphere must have been electric.\n\nAnyway, getting to back to the tan stockings. After they're removed, Victor (Tony Richards) lifts Claudia (Bree Anthony), the woman who was wearing tan stockings, off the sleazy rug she's currently resting on, and proceeds to put her body in a position that will be more conducive for sexual congress. Telling him, \"This is wrong, Victor,\" Claudia is somewhat reluctant to allow him to penetrate her with his penis (she thinks they should wait until they're married). It's obvious that Claudia has had a change of heart regarding the whole penetration situation, as Victor's penis is clearly plowing into her birth canal utilizing a series of sharply implemented jabbing motions.\n\nJust as I was beginning to tire of being immersed in the untamed undergrowth that is Victor's palustrine scrotal no-man's land, Claudia's sister Terry (Annie Sprinkle) appears in the doorway. How did you know she Claudia's sister? Excellent question. As Terry stares at her fornicating sister, employing a facial expression that can best be described as exasperated contempt, she thinks to herself, \"My little sister Claudia. My sick little sister.\"\n\nCall me perceptive, but I think the reason Terry didn't wait until Victor ejaculated sperm all over Claudia's stomach (she left during the cowgirl stage of their sex act) was because she has the hots for Victor as well.\n\nQuirky fun-fact: The voice used to verbally express Terry and Claudia's thoughts is provided by none other than Doris Wishman herself.\n\nFrustrated by what she just witnessed, Terry sits on a putrid-looking couch, crosses her legs, and begins to admire to floral patterns that pepper her bluish skirt. Only problem with that is, her mother, Ada (Sandy Foxx), is crouching by the television, which is located between two equally putrid-looking chairs. Why is that a problem, exactly? Well, you see, Terry's mother is constantly nagging her about her unladylike behaviour. And, as you might expect, this annoys Terry like you wouldn't believe. Leaving the room in a bit of a huff, Terry decides to make a phone call.\n\nIf you thought the sight of Annie Sprinkle fetching a glass of water was compelling, you should see her dial a touch-tone telephone. Hubba-hubba.\n\nCalling up Bobby (Bobby Astyr) on said touch-tone telephone, Terry arranges a meeting. If you thought Terry wanted to meet Bobby in order to discuss macrame, you would be wrong. Noticing that she is admiring the bondage gear hanging above his bed, Bobby suggests that she strap herself in.\n\nWilling, to use her words, \"to try anything once,\" Terry is suddenly naked on his bed with her wrists and ankles bound with leather restraints.\n\nSpread eagle, Terry finds the smoothness of her shaved pussy at the mercy of Bobby's inquisitive tongue. Gaining in ripeness with every lick, Terry quivers with delight as Bobby dines on her pinkish maw. It's only a matter of time before Bobby's penis is saying hello to Terry's throbbing box, and, to no one's surprise, it enters its slippery housing with an eel-like ease.\n\nMeanwhile, Claudia is wandering around in the park. The sex scenes are great and all. But there's something wonderfully off-kilter about the film's non-sex-related ones. The phone call scene, the brief exchange between Terry and Ada, and Claudia's stroll in the park are all marked by an idiosyncratic awkwardness that I can't help but lap up with a spoon.\n\nStanding by a chain link fence, Claudia suspects that \"something strange is going on,\" and wonders if she should tell her mother that she and Victor are getting married. While Claudia's commitment to her fiance is unwavering, Victor clearly isn't, as committed, that is. What do you think Victor's doing while she's ruminating in the park? That's right, he's placing his boy thing between Terry's ample breasts.\n\nIf I had to point out a single flaw in Satan Was a Lady, it would have to be the fact that no-one has sex with Sandy Foxx. You mean the actress who played Ada, Terry and Claudia's mother? Yeah, her. She's got a tight little body on her and she knows exactly how to drive men crazy. Don't believe me? Check out the way the she crosses her black pantyhose-adorned legs. Her sitting technique will reduce your pathetic genitals to a mound of shapeless goo. Anyway, I guess I'll just have to take solace in the scenes that feature Sandy stirring the contents of a cooking pot, crouching in a grey skirt, and the one where she tells Terry to put some clothes and to \"act like a lady,\" as there all we get as far as Sandy Foxx-based titillation goes.\n\nThe sisterly bound between Terry and Claudia is obviously a fractured one. All you need to do is take one look at them sitting on that war crime of a couch together and you will fully understand the tenuous nature of their relationship. In all honesty, I was somewhat surprised I was able to pick up on the tension. I mean, the fact that Annie Sprinkle is wearing a pink, frilly, Little Bo Peep-style prom dress was kind of distracting, as my mind was inundated with thoughts such as: Why is she wearing that? And: Who dresses like that around the house? To which Terry would probably reply, \"Leave me alone.\"\n\nWith two slabs of hearty vaginal cornmeal already on his plate, you wouldn't think that Victor would be able to handle three vaginas at once. Think again, Skippy. Not only does he juggle three women simultaneously, one of them is played by the sophisticated C.J. Laing, a woman who literally oozes a Sharon Mitchell-approved brand of spunk appeal. As Terry and Claudia are not chatting with one another on that guacamole stain masquerading as a couch, Victor is busy inserting his cock inside C.J. Laing's warm, wet and inviting pussy. Despite their obvious drunkenness, Victor and C.J. manage to execute a series of well-timed thrusts. Though, it should be noted that when it came time to for C.J. to carry out her thrusting end of the bargain, I couldn't help but notice that the close up shots of her pussy were replaced with what looked like Bree Anthony's pussy. How do I know this? It's simple, really. While Bree's pussy is shaved, C.J. is rocking a full bush, and the pussy in the scene between Victor and C.J. is clearly shaved.\n\nWhen the film's jaw-dropping climax is about to get underway, Victor, Claudia, Ada and Terry all gather together in the living room. And, yes, that putrid couch and those ghastly chairs are front and centre to witness the greatest twist ending in cinematic history. Appearance-wise, you wouldn't think something \"jaw-dropping\" was about to happen. But trust me, some weird shit is about to go down. It all starts when Victor asks Terry to get him a glass of cold water. I won't say anything else, as I don't want to ruin the surprise. Which is a shame, because I was looking forward to heaping a fair amount of misguided praise on Alex Mann, who shows up during the finale as a doctor, a doctor who wears a red blazer (he's constantly adjusting the sleeves) and sounds like a mobster.\n\nIt just dawned me, by bringing up the fact that Sandy Foxx doesn't appear in a sex scene, and, not to mention, letting the cat out of the bag in regard to the C.J./Bree pussy switcheroo, I'm in danger of making this film sound like a piece of crap filled with nothing but errors and goofs. When, in reality, the exact opposite is true. A genuine camp classic if I ever saw one, Satan Was a Lady, with its odd shifts in tone, its dedication to long, protracted shots of inanimate objects, and, of course, its tawdry approach to interior design, this film will satisfy the hunger that lies within all those who love their pornography to include elements of horror and melodrama. If watching Annie Sprinkle lounge around in nothing but black stockings and a matching corset is more your thing, then you'll love the film, too. I'm just saying, there's something peculiar about this film, and that's the main reason to seek it out.\n\nvideo uploaded by permateen\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCome With Me My Love (Doris Wishman, 1976)\n\nI didn't know guys with hairy taints performed cunnilingus in 1925. But according to Come With Me My Love (a.k.a. The Haunted Pussy), it was being dolled out like copious amounts of cotton candy. Which reminds me, it's not everyday that you see an erotic horror film that includes a prologue that takes place in the 1920s. But then again, Doris Wishman isn't your everyday kind of filmmaker. She sees things from a decidedly cockeyed point-of-view, and this film is proof of that. A supernatural thriller interspersed with scenes involving sexual intercourse with ghosts, the film is an epic tale about lust, jealously, desire, and revenge. And just like her previous masterpiece (and I use the word \"masterpiece\" sheepishly with a dash of sincerity), Satan Was a Lady, this film, featuring the groundbreaking cinematography of C. Davis Smith, takes place entirely inside a modest apartment building located near the park. However, its premise is bold and daring. Covering the topic of life after death in a thoughtful and intelligent manner, the film begs the question: Do the curtains match the drapes? If you have ever had the pleasure of watching a Doris Wishman film, then you know that's a loaded question. The chances the curtains would match anything, let alone the drapes, is highly unlikely. You see, Miss Wishman likes play around with our perception of what constitutes tasteful interior design. Pushing the limits of home decor to the outer reaches of gaudiness, this film will test the integrity of your eyeballs. But don't worry erection/wetness fans, the film is also filled with the kind of mid-70s-style fucking and sucking that will keep the contents of your respective crotches on their crotchety toes. Just thought I'd throw that out there just in case anyone was worrying that the film was exclusively an exercise in tawdry feng shui.\n\nThere are three separate events that occur before the ghost of a spurned husband from the 1920s can begin to have sex with a drugged woman that looks exactly like his dead wife. First, the curtains begin to ripple as the result of an eerie breeze. Second, we can't help but notice that the sky looks like it's on fire. And last but not least, the blurry shape of mustached man suddenly appears in front of a wall covered with garish red and white wallpaper. And judging by the number of times the dead guy from the twenties has sexual relations with the 1970s version of dead wife's doppelgänger, we're going to see a whole lot of that wallpaper.\n\nWelcome to Kenmare City. Where? You know, Kenmare City. Actually, to be honest, I've never heard of Kenmare City. It says here that there's Kenmare in North Dakota. But nothing about a Kenmare City. Here's an idea, maybe Doris Wishman simply made it up. Anyway, it's 1925, and Randolph (Jeffery Hurst) is creeping up the stairs; the black and white picture quality is grainy to give the film a 1920s feel. Opening the door to his apartment, he stumbles upon his wife (Ursula Austin) canoodling in the buff with a guy (Terry Austin) who is supposedly Randolph's best friend. They don't see him standing there, so they continue to canoodle. After awhile their canoodling morphs into the realm of oral sex. Oral sex?!? In the 1920s?!? Blow jobs I can see, as men have always liked to have their cocks orally serviced. But cunnilingus?!? I'm telling you, I just can't picture it happening back then. Really? You can't picture men going down on women during the so-called roaring twenties? Okay, maybe you're right. Forget everything I just said about oral sex and 1920s.\n\nVisibly annoyed, okay, more like, enraged, Randolph interrupts them, pulls out a gun (maybe he didn't \"stumble upon\" them, after all), announces his displeasure, and proceeds to shoot his best friend in the chest. You would think that this would be the moment when Randolph's wife would start to scream (she just watched the guy whose face was just all up in her pussy shot to death). But no, she throws her wedding ring off in disgust and basically tells Randolph to go fuck himself. As she did that, I thought to myself, yeah, you go, girl. After shooting her in the head, Randolph turns the gun on himself.\n\nWelcome to Kenmare City... Hey, man, didn't you already say that? Can't a brother finish a sentence? I'm sorry, go ahead. Welcome to Kenmare City, it's 1976, and Abby (Ursula Austin) is walking up the stairs to her new apartment. Dressed like Little Edie from Grey Gardens and carrying the world's reddest suitcase, Abby enters her new digs, which we get a brief tour of thanks to a spinning camera shot.\n\nMeanwhile, at another apartment building, a guyed named Patrick (Robert Kerman) and a blonde woman, oh, let's call her, Beatrice (Nancy Dare), are engaged in the 69 position, when Lola (Vanessa Del Rio) shows up. Asking if them if she can join them, Robert Kerman pulls his face out of Beatrice's ass and replies, \"Sure, come on over.\" I don't know what these people have to do with the plot. Nevertheless, they provide the bulk of the non-ghost sex in this movie. Oh, I remember, Abby knows Lola somehow, and she calls her every now and then. It doesn't quite justify they're presence, but at least they're loosely connected to the story.\n\nSince Abby can't call Lola on her phone (the one in her apartment isn't hooked up yet), she uses her neigbour's phone instead. And you know what that means? That's right, it's time for Annie Sprinkle to make her shapely presence felt. Yay! I love Annie Sprinkle! Oozing a naive exuberance, Annie plays Tess Albertino, Abby's helpful next-door neighbour, like her life depended on it. She does what? Yeah, she has urgency about her that practically screamed quiet desperation. If you say so.\n\nMaybe it's the new apartment (the carpet is blood red) or maybe it's the eerie creaking noises, but either way, Abby is having trouble sleeping. Suddenly, a bottle of sleeping pills magically appear on her nightstand. Doing what any normal person would do, Abby takes one of the mysterious pills, removes her sea green nightie and goes to bed. What occurs next is a sight we're going to be quite familiar with by the time this film is over, and that is: Curtains, sky, wind, wallpaper, and ghost. When you see these five things show up in this order (the \"wind\" is usually represented by the sight of Abby's hair being jostled by a stiff breeze), you know you're about to see something truly out of this world. Or more specifically, tiny droplets of ghost jizz sloshing around on Abby's naturally flat stomach with nowhere to go.\n\nEmerging from the red wallpaper, Randolph's ghost walks up to Abby's bed and begins to grope her flesh. Besides the fact that he came out of the wallpaper, how do you know he's a ghost? Well, for starters, Doris Wishman shows us what's being in reflected in Abby's mirror. And what do we don't see? We don't see two people engaging in a raucous bought of mid-1970s-style sexual intercourse, we only see Abby, who, according to her mirror, appears to be hugging/humping no-one. The sight of Abby having sex with the air is hands down the film's most haunting image.\n\nWandering in the dark with only a candle guide her way (the lights in her apartment stopped working for some strange reason), Abby is trying to find the fusebox. What she finds instead is Tess' Movie Date (Levi Richards), who startles her by grabbing her arm. Taking him back to her apartment, Abby offers to get Tess' Movie Date a drink. She makes it all but four feet, when Tess' Movie Date grabs her again (this Tess' Movie Date guy, he's one grabby motherfucker), and steers Abby the direction of her bedroom where they engage in, you guessed it, a raucous bought of mid-1970s-style sexual intercourse.\n\nIf you're wondering what Tess doing during all this. Wonder no more, because I'm totally about to tell you...for some inexplicable reason. Waiting in her apartment for Tess' Movie Date to show up, Tess, who looks sexy in a slinky black dress, taps her fingers on her hips and paces back and forth like a caged animal. Call me someone who is one gourd sort of a six pack, but I'd rather watch Annie Sprinkle act frustrated in a gaudily furnished apartment, than watch Levi Richard's unkempt ball sack bounce around inside Ursula Austin's mouth.\n\nShe might not kill with her cunt, but terrible things seem to happen to all those who enter its gaping expanse. Case in point, Tess' Movie Date leaves Abby's apartment the following morning, and goes home. While Abby did a pretty good job washing his genitals, you should really take a bath, you know, just to be on the safe side. Only problem is, your radio is sitting on the edge of your bath tub. Meaning, you're practically inviting a jealous ghost, one who is none too pleased that you just had sex with a woman who looks exactly like his dead wife from 1920s, to push the radio in the water. Oh, Tess' Movie Date, when will you ever learn?\n\nAm I crazy, or does the 69 position really bring out the luster in Ursula Austin's thighs? What's that? You're saying I am crazy?!? Interesting. And here I thought I was being perfectly sane. At any rate, the curtains, the wind, the sky, the wallpaper, and the ghost return, as Abby is visited yet again by Randolph's phantom cock.\n\nOh, and don't feel sorry for Tess. Sure, she was stood up by Tess' Movie Date, but she has plenty of suitors who want to rake her proverbial cornfield. Inviting a slab of brainless man-candy (Roger Caine) over to fuck her on a drawer, Tess gets the ripe dicking she deserves. Even though the wallpaper nearly steals the scene, nothing beats the sight of Annie Sprinkle in black stockings, chunky black shoes, and a black garter belt. Nothing, I tell you. Nothing!\n\nIn the film's most bizarre sequence, Abby wanders the park during a blizzard. If the weather wasn't bad enough, some ponce starts throwing snowballs at her. What? Yeah, snowballs. Three to be exact. You're being inundated with paranormal penis on a nightly basis, so you go to the park to clear your head. When you get there, this asshole decides use you as target practice. That's some fucked up shit, if you don't mind my saying so. To make matters worse, when she gets home, a wedding ring suddenly appears on her finger. And, of course, she can't seem to remove it.\n\nThe curtains, the wind, the sky, the wallpaper, and the ghost appear four more times before all is said and done, as more hairy balls are gargled and more people end up dead. With Ernie Hudson nowhere in sight, will Abby be able to resist the horny ghost who lives inside her wallpaper? Who's to say, but Come With Me My Love is Doris Wishman at her most sinister. An erotic horror classic for the ages, the film is a must-see for fans of hairy taints, hairy balls, hairy vaginas, let's just say, hairy everything. Though, Annie Sprinkle's pussy is surprisingly hairless, and... Let me start over. If you like a pinch of horror with your porn, then you will want to go see Come With Me My Love. If this film is not currently playing at your local erotic theatre, make sure you tell the manager that you want them to screen Come With Me My Love.\n\n↧\n\nNaked Killer (Clarence Ford, 1992)\n\nIf you don't have a fetish for women's gloves. May I ask, why the hell not? Seriously, what's wrong with you? They're gloves. What's not to like? I tell you what, I'm going to leave the room for a second, and when I get back, I wanna see a fully-developed fetish for women's gloves sitting on my proverbial desk. If not, then, well, this isn't gonna work at all. See you in, oh, let's say, ten seconds. Okay, I'm back. Do you get sexually aroused by the sight of an attractive woman who is wearing gloves? I'll interpret your sheepish silence to mean, yes, you have in fact acquired a fetish for dainty hands sheathed in gloves. I won't lie, it's good to have you on board. How you were able to obtain the attributes necessary to convincingly exhibit the wide array of symptoms that come front-loaded with this particular fetish so quickly is nothing short of a miracle. Nevertheless, now we can proceed to talk about Naked Killer (a.k.a. Chik loh go yeung) in a calm and rational manner. Just kidding, nothing I've ever done could ever be construed as \"calm\" or \"rational.\" We're going to analyze the hyper-stylized fashions that are worn throughout this violent, Category III film about lethal lesbians and genital distress in early 1990s Hong Kong using the most exaggerated language possible. You don't have to ask yourself, but I'm going to make you ask anyway, when the female assassin that is eventually going to kill us all comes knocking at your door, what kind of gloves do want her to be wearing when she pulls the trigger on the gun aimed at your precious genitals? (\"Precious\" because they're the genitals you use to masturbate and occasionally use to have sex with.) Since you're not saying anything (this sheepish schtick is yours is starting to get tiresome), I'll step forward and say that I want my junk blown off with a gun that is fired by a hand that is encased in a glove that doesn't stray too far past the wrist, that is, of course, tight, very tight, and feminine. And as for the colour? Put me down for tiger print.\n\nI'm surprised you didn't want to be castrated by a gun that was being wielded by a hands that were wearing fingerless gloves or even opera gloves, as they're usually the type of glove in your glove fetish wheelhouse. What can I say? No fooling, what can I say? I'm at a lose for words. No, wait. I just got some. What can I say? I'm sucker for animal print. And, the last time I checked, a tiger is an animal.\n\nEloquent as always, but what about the pantyhose?!? There's pantyhose in this film? Again, just kidding. I always notice pantyhose, and like the gloves, Naked Killer (赤裸羔羊) is stuffed with the sheer stuff your eyeballs crave.\n\nIn fact, a couple of shapely legs poured into a pair of fishnet pantyhose and a pair of gloved hands working a compact disc player are some the first images thrown at us in the bizarre mishmash of genres. Let's see if I can recall the sequence of the images that greet us during the film's ultra-stylish opening montage. There were definitely three women in silver masquerade masks. What else? Oh yeah, a string of pearls, red curtains, legs in fishnet pantyhose kicking up a storm, a woman performing a hair flip, a lesbian kiss, some topless stabbing, and, yeah, that's all I remember. Either way, as far as first impressions go, Naked Killer is pushing all the right buttons.\n\nThe correct buttons continue to be pushed as we follow a woman in red walking the rain-soaked streets of Hong Kong after dark. Apparently being pursued by a man wearing fingerless gloves, the woman, whose face is partially obscured by a red and yellow hat, fumbles with her keys, but eventually enters her apartment safe and sound (seconds later, her black glove-adorned hands can be seen putting on a CD). But wait, are we sure that it's her apartment. What?!? Yeah, it would seem that guy in the fingerless gloves is the one who is danger tonight. Finding a naked woman, one who will soon be known to us as Princess (Carrie Ng), taking a shower in his bathroom, the man is about to ask what she is doing in there, I mean, it's his shower, when, all of a sudden, she shoots his kneecaps out with a gun, smashes his head with a dumbbell, and shoots him in the balls.\n\nEven though the scene where the cops investigate the scene of the crime failed to push any of the buttons I alluded to earlier, it does introduce us Tinam (Simon Yam), a cop on the edge. Actually, I don't think Tinam was on the edge. Oh, sure, he's definitely near an edge, all right. I just don't think he's on the edge. Anyway, still traumatized by the fact that he accidentally shot and killed his brother some time last year, Tinam is thrown off the case after insisting that the killer of the guy with the fingerless gloves and the killer behind a series of other murders that involved testicular perforation were carried out by a female assassin; his commanding officer thinks his theory is pure poppycock.\n\nIt's true, we saw her during the film's opening montage, but the hair salon scene is our first chance to see the gorgeous Chingmy Yau up close. Getting her hair done, Chingmy, who plays Kitty, takes exception with the way a male customer treats her black fishnet pantyhose-wearing friend (he kicks her in the stomach), and shows her displeasure by thrusting the pointy end of a pair of scissors into his crotch multiple times. Whether her frenzied stabbing motions managed to snag any Hong Kong cock is unclear. But either way, this Kitty chick is not someone to be trifled with. Of course, Tinam just happened to be getting a haircut when all this went down.\n\nRunning after Kitty, who is wearing black boots, black shorts (the kind that help foster legginess), and a red blouse, Tinam tries to persuade her to press against charges against the stomach kicking guy. As you might expect, this conversation doesn't go exactly as planned, as Tinam almost vomits and loses his pager. Finding his pager, Kitty uses it to track down Tinam, and shows up at his work (wearing fishnet pantyhose). Telling his commanding officer how helpful he was in doing something that was...obviously helpful, Tinam finds himself back on the case; he was briefly assigned to the forces anti-porn squad.\n\nThe next thing you know, Tinam is dry humping Kitty against a parked car. On a date together, Kitty, who is wearing red booty-gripping short shorts with black thigh-high boots, and Tinam seem to getting along swimmingly. And why wouldn't they? Her thighs are spectacular! And he, well, he's got that whole Chow Yun-Fat in A Better Tomorrow thing going for him. Unfortunately, Kitty's stepmother's lover murders her father. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me double check that. No, that's right. At any rate, angry over the fact some yuppie scumbag killed her father, Kitty shows up at the offices of Bee (Ken Lo) wielding two guns. (Who looks like Chow Yun-Fat now?) She may look like Chow Yun-Fat, but her aim isn't as true. After being kicked in the cunt multiple times by Bee, Kitty eventually gets the better of him, blasting him to kingdom come.\n\nStumbling out the office, her cunt no doubt black and blue from the stomping it just received, Kitty must now contend with Bee's henchmen. And since this is film was made in Hong Kong, the number of henchmen is off the charts. In no condition to battle hundreds of henchmen, Kitty looks like a goner.\n\nOr is she? Hello, I'm Sister Cindy. And I'm 50! That's right, 50! I'm 50 years-old. And I can kick...and stretch...and kick! And I'm here to help. And boy, does she ever. Taking care of the henchmen that had Kitty cornered in the building's parking garage with a milfy aplomb, Sister Cindy (Wai Yu), the tight grip of her age appropriate pantyhose pressing tightly against her resilient labia like an elastic band, ushers the amateur assassin to safety.\n\nWaking up in nothing but a sports bra and panties, Kitty doesn't know it yet, but she's on the fast track to becoming a professional assassin. I don't know, I guess Sister Cindy, a professional assassin herself, saw potential in Kitty when she happened upon her misguided attempt to take out her father's killer. Giving her a new identity, Sister Cindy starts to train Kitty to be a hit woman. At first, Sister Cindy has her practice on the limitless supply of child rapists she keeps locked in her basement. And then she teaches her an important lesson. \"It doesn't matter whether your tits are big or small.\" In other words, a woman doesn't need a weapon when she has her body. This causes Kitty to wonder if she's being trained to be a killer or a prostitute.\n\nWhat about Kitty and Tinam? Oh yeah. I completely forgot about them. How will Kitty's new lifestyle effect their relationship? It pretty much kills it, no pun intended. Which is sad, when you think about it, as I thought Kitty and Tinam had a good thing going. Nonetheless, that doesn't mean Tinam is going to give up on Kitty, or whatever she is calling herself now. Their love is too strong to be destroyed by a middle-aged hit woman who uses her shapely legs to get men to let their guard down or a deadly lesbian assassin who wears tiger print gloves and smokes fat cigars.\n\nYou really get a sense of the influence Basic Instinct had on this film during the scene where Kitty, who is pretending to be Vivian Shang, crosses her legs while being questioned by police. It's true, people cross their legs in movies all the time. But there was something extra deliberate about this particular leg cross. It was almost as if Kitty/Vivian was trying to say to the world, Hey, look at me. I'm crossing my legs. I'm crossing my legs. Which, I'll admit, was totally justified, as it's a pretty awesome leg cross.\n\nFighting with Sister Cindy, who wants her to kill Tinam, and doing battle with Princess (a former student of Sister Cindy), who wants to fuck her, it's clear that Kitty is in one sticky pickle of a situation. And, not to mention, she has to contend with the jealous glares emanating from Baby (Madoka Sugawara), Princess' adorable apprentice. How adorable is Baby, you ask? Well, she wears pink stockings over black pantyhose at one point. Wow, you're right. That is adorable.\n\nBlending high octane Hong Kong-style action with eroticism, Naked Killer should technically be the blueprint for every movie in existence. That's not to say that the film is perfect. Take for instance, the club scene. Look, I love early '90s rave culture as much as the next guy, but even I was slightly embarrassed by the scene where Kitty and Sister Cindy go to a nightclub to kill a Japanese gangster (the whole thing is too cheesy for words). But other than that, the film's sexy babes in nylons to chaotic shootouts ratio was surprisingly well-balanced. And I don't think I have to mention how impressed I was by the amount of gloves seen throughout this movie.\n\nYou can tell a lot about a person by the way they describe the plot of Naked Killer. If they put an emphasis on the action, they're usually straight men between the ages of 13-105. If they seemed obsessed with the film's erotic flavour, they're usually straight men between the ages of 13-105. If they go on bizarre tangents about gloves and hosiery, they're, well, they're usually me. I give Naked Killer five taupe opera gloves out of five.\n\nuploaded by HongKongActionFilms\n\n↧\n\nRed to Kill (Billy Tang, 1994)\n\nIf you mess with Ming-Ming, Yum-Yum will fuck-fuck your shit up. I'll admit, when I first came up with that line, I was beaming with pride. Poking gentle, non-racist fun at the repetitive nature of the lead character's name, I thought to myself: Now that's how you kick off a review for a brutal rape revenge flick. Then it suddenly dawned on me, Rob Schneider had already beaten me to the punch. You see, in the Rob Schneider vehicle, The Hot Chick, the incomparable Jodi Long says, \"Ling Ling, don't forget your bling bling,\" to her jewelry-forgetting, bi-racial daughter. As you'd expect, my heart sank the moment I recalled this line's existence–a line, by the way, that is probably one of the most memorable lines to be uttered in a movie so far this century. I mean, not only does the line have two words that are repeated, \"ling\" and \"bling,\" but both words rhyme. In hindsight, I should have went on that pre-planned tangent about Ming-Ming's red panties; which I still might do, as red panties are in my wheelhouse. However, I don't regret my misguided fling with that whole Ming-Ming-Ling-Ling thing. It just goes to show that nobody should underestimate the comedic genius that was Rob Schneider circa 2002. Enough about my grammatical angst, let's talk about Red to Kill, yet another nasty slice of Category III goodness/cinematic unpleasantness to land squarely on my non-existent desk with a resounding thud. As with the majority of Category III films that have crossed paths with my eyeballs so far, this particular film, directed by Billy Tang, is filled with the sex, the violence, and the inappropriate humour I've come to expect from early '90s Hong Kong cinema. In other words, it's your typical Category III film.\n\nWhoa! Hold on there, buddy. Where do you get off calling Category III films \"typical.\" I'm sorry, but I don't like this jaded version of you. Yeah, you're right. That did come off as a tad jaded. Don't worry, it won't happen again. Let me try to muster some of my trademark wide-eyed enthusiasm. But remember, not too much enthusiasm. Why's that? Oh yeah, the film is about raping tards. Fuck yeah, \"raping tards.\" Now that's the kind of un-PC language I like to hear. Yeah, but that's what the film's about. It doesn't matter. I liked the blunt manner in which you stated it. Anyway, there's nothing \"typical\" about Red to Kill, it's an in-your-face horror film about a mentally challenged woman who is tormented by a psychopath who goes all Roy Batty at the end of Blade Runner (\"Six! Seven! Go to Hell or go to Heaven!\") whenever he sees a woman wearing the colour red. Similar to the way a bull gets agitated by a matador's cape, the sick fuck at the centre of the cinematic bullring wants to gore women in red not with his horns, but with his erect penis.\n\nThe film's opening scene prepares us for the brutality to come, as a woman in red is raped by a musclebound assailant whose face is obscured. While the victim's unconscious body twitches as a direct result of the rapist's unasked for thrusts, a mother jumps to her death, taking her young son with her on another floor. In the case of the latter incident, Ka Lok Cheung (Money Lo), a woman who works for the welfare department, tries to stop the woman from jumping, but her attempt obviously failed.\n\nRape, murder, suicide, I'm only five minutes into this thing and I'm already depressed. Don't worry, Ming-Ming (Lily Chung), the mildly retarded girl who can turn the world on with her mildly retarded smile, is about to make her first appearance. And if there's anyone who can cheer you up, it's Ming-Ming! Oh, great. It seems the only reason Miss Cheung is going to see Ming-Ming is to tell her that her dad is dead. And get this, she breaks the bad news to her just as Ming-Ming is about to feed her fish. Poor Ming-Ming.\n\nSince there's no-one to take care of her, Ming-Ming is sent to stay at the very same building where rapes and murder suicides are a nightly occurrence. Introduced to the kindly Mr. Chan (Ben Ng), a man who helps run a sort of retardation retreat for wayward tards, Ming-Ming soon learns that she will be packing balls for the Kowloon Ball Factory. While she puts on a brave face, Ming-Ming doesn't really want to work with balls. No, what Ming-Ming really wants to do is dance. And since she can't dance, Ming-Ming runs away. Finding her at hiding in her old apartment, Miss Cheung convinces Ming-Ming to return to the retardation retreat/ball packing factory by promising her to help train to be a dancer.\n\nHer dream is to qualify to compete in a dance competition being held in Belgium. And if anyone dares stand in her way of realizing that dream, I'm going to throw the world's biggest hissy fit.\n\nPacking balls and practicing her dances moves, Ming-Ming seems to be adjusting well to her new surroundings. Sure, a chubby pervert comes close to feeling her up in the ball room, but Ming-Ming is so innocent and pure that she doesn't even realize that she almost got molested. Do you think the chubby pervert is one raping the women in red? Nah, this guy is all flab, the rapist in question is ripped. Besides, the chubby pervert just wants to squeeze Ming-Ming's perky melons.\n\nIn order to remind us that there is in fact a rapist out there, a woman in red is attacked on the stairs. It could have been Miss Cheung (she was wearing a red t-shirt), but the woman who was actually attacked came along just in time. Thankfully, this attack isn't shown in graphic detail. Like I said, it's just thrown in there as a gentle reminder.\n\nEven though she's only been there a week or so, all the other tards love Ming-Ming. And why wouldn't they? She's Ming-Ming: the epitome of adorable.\n\nPleased by the progress Ming-Ming has made as a dancer, Miss Cheung can be seen beaming with pride. While Ming-Ming is right to thank Miss Cheung for helping her, it's Miss Cheung who should be thanking Ming-Ming, as Ming-Ming enriches the lives of everyone she comes in contact with.\n\nWhile I'm happy as a clambake gone awry by Ming-Ming's turnaround, the film insists on showing us a dark figure stalking the halls of the building to eerie synthesizer music. This cannot bode well for Ming-Ming. At any rate, remember that chubby pervert? Well, he's beaten by a mob, a tard-fearing mob, who accuse him of trying to rape a little girl, one who just happened to being wearing all red. However, we all know he's not the rapist. Again, this cannot bode well for Ming-Ming. Hello, this is your captain speaking. We should be landing in Saskatoon in about four hours. In meantime, please enjoy our in-flight movie: Red to Kill, a Hong Kong thriller about a sexy special needs woman who is tormented by a musclebound rapist. Oh, and just reminder. When you see Ming-Ming, the lovable retard with the legs of a dancer, wearing red panties, this will not bode well for her.\n\nWhy, Ming-Ming, why? What compelled you to wear red panties on the same day you decided to roll around on the floor (rolling on the floor, by the way, is one of the leading causes of accidental red pantie exposure) in front of a rapist whose raping ways are triggered by retards and non-retards in red clothing? Sure, they [the red panties] went with your outfit, but your outfit was...Ahhh, Ming-Ming!!! You stupid tub of unfrozen...Whoa, back off, buddy. No one talks about Ming-Ming that way. Not on my watch. Your watch?!? Your watch is my watch. Oh yeah. Whatever, man. It sounds like you're blaming Ming-Ming. And I should inform you that blaming the victims of rape for being raped is not even close to being cool. In fact, it's downright heinous.\n\nWhat kind of retard wears red panties around a rapist who rapes women who don the colour red? Well, first of all, she doesn't know he's a rapist. And second, the rapist's proclivity for reddish clothing is not a well known fact. In other words, I don't want to hear anymore of this nonsense about it being Ming-Ming's fault. You of all people should know that Ming-Ming is the personification of human goodness; her face should be added to Mount Rushmore.\n\nSo, does Ming-Ming get raped or not? Uh, I'd rather not say. Okay, this is awkward. Tell us a little something about the trial? What trial? The trial of Ming-Ming's rapist. Yeah, you know, nah. It's too painful. All right, how 'bout the pube-shaving scene? You're joking, right? I'm not describing that. Let me see. Oh, I got it. Do you know the part where Miss Cheung tries to lure the rapist into a trap by tempting him with a red dress complete with red opera gloves? Yes. Well, could you possibly go on a nonsensical tangent about that? Nonsensical, eh? I think I can swing that.\n\nSitting at the bar of a local tavern, the musclebound rapist is enjoying a post-mistrial pint of lager when, all of a sudden, a woman in red orders a bloody mary. The woman ordering the bloody mary has her back turned, so the rapist has no idea who this woman in red is. However, that all changes the moment she does turn to around to reveal that she is Ming-Ming's number one fan, Miss Cheung. As you would expect, the rapist is not amused by this ruse. Nevertheless, he can't help but be turned on by the way the red dress hugs Miss Cheung's Cantonese curves. Toying with the rapist, Miss Cheung employs a subtle leg cross to get his juices flowing. The leg cross becomes not-so subtle upon further inspection, as Miss Cheung's legs are clearly sheathed in pantyhose that sparkle. Pantyhose can sparkle? You bet it can. And Miss Cheung hopes that her glimmering, shimmering, twinkling hose will send the rapist over the edge.\n\nEven though he resists her initial attempt to entrap him, the rapist does end the evening by shoving an entire tray of ice cubes down the front of his underpants. Baby steps, as they say. At any rate, talking about Money Lo and her glittery tights was good therapy for me, as it briefly allowed me to forget the painful horrors that this film puts out there on a regular basis. Oh, Ming-Ming.\n\n↧\n\nFlesh Eating Mothers (James Aviles Martin, 1988)\n\nI'm kicking myself. And, no, not because I just spent the last twenty or so years languishing in a pathetic state of having not seen Flesh Eating Mothers, but because I just spent the last twenty or so minutes trying to figure what kind of drum machine composer Hayley Moss used to create this film's awesome score. What's so bad about that? I mean, I'm sure lots of people are curious to know what kind of drum machine was used in this film. You're joking, right? They don't care about that. The reason they're here is find out more about that cow print skirt worn by one of the flesh eating mothers. And, get this, I'm not even 100% sure the skirt was cow print. If you listen really carefully you can hear people gasping the world over as I typed that last line. It probably went a little something like this, \"I'm not even 100% sure the skirt was cow print.\" Now, quick, imagine a loud gasp being uttered by ten million people simultaneously right after the words \"cow print.\" Pretty great, eh? Anyway, it looks like... Just a second, you mean to tell me you just spent the last twenty or so years not watching Flesh Eating Mothers? It looks that way. Man, you're so fucking lame. I'm sorry, but there's no other way to put it. Yeah, I'm lame, can I continue? No, you're fucking lame; there's a difference. Okay, I'm fucking lame. Let's move on; there's a skirt print that's yet to be classified. In the grand tradition of Frankenhooker, Psychos In Love, Street Trash, and Slime City (i.e. American horror movies that don't suck ass), Flesh Eating Mothers, directed by James Aviles Martin, is the flesh eating movie that milf lovers have been waiting for. Well, most real milf lovers probably saw the film some time in the late '80s. You, on the other hand, didn't see until some twenty or so years later.\n\nIn fact, if I came up to you in, oh, let's say, 1998, and asked you if you had seen Flesh Eating Mothers, you would have stared at me with one of those looks of bewilderment you like to bandy about whenever you're challenged by a superior intellect. Forget about 1998, the same exact thing would have happened in 1995, 1996, 2000, 2002, 2006, and, hell, even in 2010. Yikes! I may be fucking lame, but at least I'm not a fucking asshole.\n\nNow, where was I? I think you were busy being big baby. Just kidding, you rule. I've always wanted see a movie where a couple of crazed flesh eating mothers work together to tear apart a stray cat in order to feed on its entrails. And you know what? Flesh Eating Mothers provided me with that and then some.\n\nAfter a brief prologue that involves the town's police commissioner, Commissioner Dixon (Ken Eaton), losing an arm and shooting his wife, Elisa (Lori Gustafson), in the face while hunting in the woods, we're treated to a catchy little ditty by Sherri Lamar that promotes the greatness of the suburbs. Boasting lyrics such as \"trash is carted away weekly in suburbia,\" and \"nothing can go wrong in suburbia,\" the song plays over the image of what looks like a child's drawing; one that, like the song, seems to go out of its way to depict the suburbs as some kind of blemish-free utopia.\n\nYou better get used to the sight of Roddy Douglas (Louis Homyak) lying in bed with one milf-tastic woman after another, because that's what he does for a living. Wait a second, that didn't come out right. I didn't mean to imply that it's Roddy job to have hot, throbbing, bed sheet ruining sexual intercourse with the town's milf population. No, what I should have said was that Roddy seems quite adept when it comes to convincing the town's milfy contingent to have sex with him. When we first meet Roddy, he's putting the finishing touches on the well-worn vagina that belongs to Booty Bernett (Grace Pettijohn), a woman whose vaginal wall was in desperate need of a new coat of...don't you dare finish that thought.\n\nI liked the way Flesh Eating Mothers introduces us to its characters at the beginning of the film. It's true, most films use this technique as well, but Flesh Eating Mothers is, nonetheless, doing an excellent job of introducing its characters. Don't believe me? Well then, check this out: Rinaldi Vivaldo (Neal Rosen), a tough kid confined to his room (it looks like he's grounded) is promptly introduced to us. Nice to me you, Rinaldi.\n\nSticking with the prompt introduction theme, we're suddenly introduced to Officer McDormick (Mickey Ross), who shows up at his ex-wife's house to deliver his child support cheque. Quirky fun-fact: Fans of Goodfellas will probably recognize Officer McDormick's ex-wife as Mrs. Carbone (Marie Michaels). Unfortunately, there isn't word on the street that Martin Scorsese cast Marie based solely on her leggy performance as Officer McDormick's ex-wife in Flesh Eating Mothers.\n\nI don't know about you, but I think it's time we met more of the film's teens. Walking to school, best friends, Linda Douglas (Donatella Hecht) and Joyce Shepard (Valorie Hubbard), bump into Jeff Nathan (Robert Lee Oliver), thanks to a football that was tossed in his general direction by a troublemaker. Since Linda bears the brunt of Jeff's bump, she immediately calls him a spaz. And just like that, three more characters are on board.\n\nWhen Linda gets home, we discover that Roddy, the milf enthusiast, is her dad. Do you think Linda's mom, Sylvia Douglas (Katherine Mayfield), knows about her husband's milf obsession? I don't know. But you gotta love Roddy's \"Hands Across America\" t-shirt. You just gotta.\n\nWhen we meet the Nolan brothers, Timmy (Terry Hayes) and Johnny (Douglas James), the latter is punching the former in the face in full view of Mrs. Nolan (Ginger Anselmo), their structurally interesting mother. I thought the matter of fact way Johnny punched Timmy in the face perfectly encapsulated the film's darkly comedic tone. To makes things even more absurd, the pummeling is stopped by the sound of an ice cream truck, as the two combatants jump to their feet to ask their \"mommy\" for ice cream money.\n\nI also liked how excited they seemed to get when they first hear the ice cream truck, as it's the complete opposite to the way I react when I hear the monotonous din of an ice cream truck's cloying ditty; annoyance mixed with anger are the only flavours I'm interested in when I hear that jingle. \"If I had a rocket launcher...\"\n\nYou know who also likes ice cream? Linda and Joyce, that's "
