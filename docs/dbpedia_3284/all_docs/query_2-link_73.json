        "text": "Spider-Man 4 still hasn't been officially announced, but that's no reason to worry about the return of Tom Holland as Spider-Man.\n\nIn July 2024, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige confirmed that he was working on it with long-time Spider-Man producer Amy Pascal. \"We have writers who are going to be delivering us a draft relatively soon,\" he added.\n\nThe fourth movie will likely see a change behind the scenes though as Feige said that Jon Watts – who directed the first three movies – has \"lots of things going on right now\".\n\nAfter Spider-Man: No Way Home became one of the biggest movies of all time, it always seemed very likely that it wasn't the end.\n\nSony wants to make more Spidey movies with Holland and he wants to return. Nobody is rushing into it for the sake of it though. In April 2024, Holland confirmed that they were developing the story to get it right.\n\nIt means that whatever rumours you hear about Spider-Man 4 – which feel like they're coming every week – are just that... rumours.\n\nBut while we wait for any official news, here's everything you need to know about Spider-Man 4.\n\nSpider-Man 4 potential release date: When will Spider-Man 4 be out in cinemas?\n\nSpider-Man 4 might be in development at Sony and Marvel, but it doesn't yet have a release date confirmed as of August 2024.\n\nThere had previously been two years between each Spider-Man movie in the MCU, but obviously we didn't get Spider-Man 4 in December 2023, so we've settled in for a longer wait.\n\nSony does have a release date for an untitled Spider-Man Universe movie on June 27, 2025 so that's a possible date for the return of Tom Holland's webslinger.\n\nHowever, it feels too tight of a turnaround, especially since Holland was busy on the West End stage with Romeo & Juliet until early August 2024. It doesn't rule out filming starting this year, but we wouldn't blame him if he needed a bit of a breather.\n\nAll we can do is watch this space, and we'll update when there's any developments.\n\nSpider-Man 4 cast: Will Tom Holland return as Spider-Man?\n\nInitially, Tom Holland was a bit cagey about his future as Peter Parker, understandably.\n\nAfter the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home, he said: \"Maybe it is time for me to move on. I have to take Peter Parker into account as well, because he is an important part of my life,\" and added: \"If I'm playing Spider-Man after I'm 30, I've done something wrong.\"\n\nHowever, he then clarified those quotes, saying: \"I don't know what the future of Spider-Man looks like. I don't know whether I'm going to be a part of it. Spider-Man will always live on in me, and I know that [producer] Amy [Pascal] and the studio are keen to figure out what the next chapter of Spider-Man looks like.\n\n\"If that happens to be with me, then that's very exciting but, you know, if it's time for me to walk away then I'll do so proudly.\"\n\nHe added in December 2023 that a fourth movie won't be made for the \"sake of making another one\".\n\n\"It will have to be worth the while of the character,\" Holland outlined. \"But that said, if we can figure that out, I would be a fool not to put the suit back on again because I owe everything to Spider-Man.\"\n\nThere's always the possibility that Holland could move into more of a mentor role for a new Spider-Man (Miles Morales, perhaps), but there are no teasers for that in No Way Home so we can only speculate for now.\n\nWe'd imagine that Zendaya and Jacob Batalon would return as MJ and Ned, respectively, but by the end of No Way Home, neither remembers Peter is Spider-Man.\n\nThat could mean MJ and Ned won't be in a potential fourth movie, although we're just speculating for now. Talking in April 2024, Batalon had no idea whether he'd be returning or not.\n\n\"I don't know what any future holds for any of them in that world. I just feel like if things happen, they happen. I hope so. I definitely hope so. It's sad that he has no friends anymore,\" he told ComicBook.com.\n\nHappy Hogan (Jon Favreau) doesn't know Peter now either, but he does know Spider-Man, so he could be back again.\n\nOne person who definitely won't be in it is Marisa Tomei, as Aunt May is tragically killed by the Green Goblin. The multiverse does offer the possibility of an alternate Aunt May (like the alternate Spider-Men), but we feel this won't be done.\n\nIt's also unlikely that Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire would return, again, to their roles, given that their brief but meaningful appearance in No Way Home is rectified as the plot reseals the multiverse up.\n\nHowever, they do now have official MCU names as \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\" (Maguire) and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" (Garfield), so who's to say they couldn't swing by the MCU again?\n\nGarfield would certainly be up for another team-up movie as long as the story called for it: \"It would have to be something very unique, very special and serving to an audience and in service of the character.\"\n\nKirsten Dunst wasn't asked to come back as Mary-Jane Watson for No Way Home, but has always been open that she \"would have\" reprised the role. Could we see that in a new movie? Let's hope so.\n\nCould we see Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom in the fourth movie? He does appear in the No Way Home credits scene but is taken back to his own universe. (More on him later.)\n\nSpider-Man 4 plot: Does No Way Home set up Spider-Man 4?\n\nShort answer: not really. The climax effectively wraps up the trilogy and sets a blank slate for the future. The possibilities for that new movie are endless.\n\nA potential fourth movie can do whatever it likes, whether that's having Peter train up a new Spider-Man, a standalone adventure where he faces a new villain, or something else entirely.\n\n\"At the end of the movie we just made, you see Spider-Man make a momentous decision, one that you've never seen him make before. It's a sacrifice. And that gives us a lot to work with for the next film,\" Pascal teased to .\n\nOne potential option is to deliver a long-awaited battle between Spider-Man and Venom on the big screen. As we saw in the Venom 2 credits scene, Eddie Brock and Venom are transported to the MCU.\n\nIt's because of the botched spell that Doctor Strange casts, but he rectifies it at the end which means Eddie and Venom are taken back to their universe. A piece of the Venom symbiote is left behind though, so it could take over somebody in the MCU.\n\nThe first trailer for Venom 3 (also known as Venom: The Last Dance) features a nod to the ending of No Way Home, but it doesn't reveal if there will be further connections between the Venom saga and the MCU.\n\nThat movie has also been confirmed to be the final Venom movie, but whether that also means the final appearance for Tom Hardy as Venom remains to be seen.\n\nNo Way Home also made a fun nod to Ned's villainous turn as Hobgoblin in the comics.\n\nWe think it's unlikely we'll see it play out on screen, but stranger things have happened in the MCU.\n\nSpider-Man 4 trailer: Any Spider-Man 4 footage yet?\n\nOf course not! Filming hasn't even started on Spider-Man 4, so you'll have to make do with No Way Home rewatches for now."
