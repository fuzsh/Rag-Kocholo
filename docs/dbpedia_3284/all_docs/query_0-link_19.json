        "text": "This post isn‚Äôt about writing books, but it is about writing‚Äîa couple different kinds of writing, in fact.\n\nThat said, it has less to do with writing than it does with our willingness to adapt and change and never being afraid to chase our dreams.\n\nWhen I was thirteen, I read my first ‚Äúadult‚Äù book, which was serialized in a magazine, called SOMEBODY OWES ME MONEY by Donald Westlake. Reading that book, a comedy murder mystery about a cab driver named Chet who simply wants to collect his nine hundred dollar bet, only to find his bookie stabbed to death, was a revelation to me. And I can say with certainty that it is the reason I became a novelist.\n\nBut I wasn‚Äôt always a novelist. In fact, I didn‚Äôt even start writing my real first novel until I was in my late forties (a considerable distance from thirteen), although I had written and published a handful of short stories. Before that, I was a screenwriter, and not a particularly successful one at that. I won the Nicholl award with my first script and turned around and sold it to Showtime shortly thereafter, but it was the first and last movie script I sold and I wound up writing for animated shows like Spider-Man Unlimited.\n\nAll of that started when I was well into adulthood, at the age of thirty-five. Before that I had been struggling to make it as a musician, first as a performer‚ÄîI suffered too much from stage fright to make that happen‚Äîand then as a songwriter. I came very close to selling a few songs, was often praised for my music, but never was able to quite get over the hump. And then I felt I was too old to make it in the biz, so I fell back on my second love, writing, and wrote that first script I mentioned above.\n\nI‚Äôm now approaching sixy-one, and can happily say that I‚Äôve become a semi-successful novelist who has made some decent money and even seen one of his books make it to the small screen. I‚Äôve talked about that before, I‚Äôm sure, so I won‚Äôt bore you with it now.\n\nBut at nearly sixty-one, despite my ‚Äúsuccess,‚Äù I‚Äôve found myself feeling unfulfilled by only writing novels, and the lifelong musician (and screenwriter) in me has been yearning to do something different. Something I‚Äôve never done before, but have been thinking about for many, many years.\n\nSo for the past several months I‚Äôve chased an old dream. What, you might ask is that?\n\nI‚Äôve written a musical.\n\nYes, that‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs an ‚Äúintimate‚Äù musical called Cradle Song, centering around a fractured family that desperately needs to heal.\n\nAnd I went crazy and not only wrote the ‚Äúbook‚Äù (play script), but also the music and lyrics for the thing.\n\nI‚Äôm told that this isn‚Äôt often done by one person, but, hey, I‚Äôm always up for a challenge. So I did it and it‚Äôs done and I can go to my grave knowing that I have fulfilled at least part of a dream. The other part, of course, would be seeing the play get produced. But that‚Äôs pretty much out of my hands.\n\nSo why am I telling you this, you ask?\n\nAll of this rambling is merely my way of saying that no matter how old you are, you should never deny yourself of the chance to fulfill a dream. To turn in a different direction and fly.\n\nAnd if you want to be a writer (or a singer or a painter or a fill-in-the-blank) at eighty-seven but have never gotten around to doing it, don‚Äôt for godsakes let your age stop you. Don‚Äôt let anything stop you.\n\nThe world is full of people who love to tell us no. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that. You‚Äôre too old. Too young. Too white. Too black. Too fat. Too thin. Too female. Too‚Ä¶‚Äù whatever.\n\nDon‚Äôt listen to them. If you have a passion, follow it. And don‚Äôt worry about the naysayers and the rules. Just do it, as they say in the TV commercial.\n\nNothing and no one can stop you if you let your passion be your guide.\n\nIf anyone is interested in what I‚Äôve been doing to fulfill my passion for the last few months, check out http://cradlesongmusical.com. And, of course, if any of you are play producers, feel free to use the contact page‚Ä¶ üòâ\n\nQuestion: what dream would you like to fulfill that you haven‚Äôt yet chased after?"
