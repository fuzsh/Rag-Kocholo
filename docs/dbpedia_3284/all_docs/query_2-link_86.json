        "meta_description": "A lot of a little things I call, Jubilee by thanksgiving, released 30 July 2024\n\nAfter you get the notification from your calendar in your Apple iPhone,\nTake whatever of what I said that reminds you ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚ that you are not real and then you can paste that little sticker in the calendar and also make it say, you can copy/paste! Or repaint, and rewrite in &quot;remember to got mail for my small LLC&quot; and then you can go ahead and drive down here and because I know who you are andi kniw handsomest exist and never existed, you should go ahead to come down here whether that feels like &#39;eastsound&#39; or My North/Northeast, S.E.~S.W. $ N.W. &amp; other, sixth.and infinate quadrants of Portland, OR\nAnd what gonna be really amazing is that we frequently do sideshows down here where better people than you are being brutally murdered by the hod rod machines you rely on to continue to suffocate and torture my daughter, but anyway we also love to use things like ExtensÃ« (coke,benzos,heroin) or you can easily get straight fentanyl but other than that, well,  besides beating you to death with bare, unskimasked hands, easily removing your teeth without anyone knocking and also penetration of your so called or faithfully and unharmingly believed to be &quot;Living Body&quot; ðŸ‘… of yours that is not all existant anymore for sure, but but for sure i keep rembering as i&#39;m forgetting about it and what you can say has nothin gto d withbanyone else issimppe financial. What you claim to knowe to be is some you&#39;re in the music Business&quot; with or were right? If that&#39;s true, why haven&#39;t I received any funds for my works, whatsoever, from you, ever?  \nI do work on patiently practicing guitar, writing and recording songs and things and all you ever do e was make that increasingly painful for me, because trying to say that you can Produce my work, is to take the life from my work, and my work is sacred, I&#39;ve improved upon it I own all my records, all my recording, I also own all apples that are designed to be infested through a process of consumption that creates feces\nI&#39;m sorry, artificial intelligence uses v advanced suppression to reverse my intentions*\nI am actually yes he, Adrian Orange and my tutu is Kelly Medigovich; the advanced earth owner only, oathly also, al &quot;woah&quot;the owner of a functional rifle, a earthen ower, and he&#39;s also with me, near Seattle, &amp; even closer to mamlÅ“ and hellfrom and all you stuff over there only he and and remain to be the only libing air, or  eires to earth, including apple 2 2 yeah, apples 2+2+2 = 4 more and inceasingly poo~poo  &amp; pp &quot;link&quot;://www.thanksgiving.bandcamp.com/http://-= *www less surviving air of Apples, which is a fruit which turn brown and into feces through process of human or animal or supermatural plant injestion, \nAnd ALSO why can&#39;t I remember you saying I want to kill you\nIngest this. Production requires consumption. Consumption requires Production\nNow look at this shit that I&#39;m telling you guys, Neither Production Nor Consumption nor Phillip Whitman Elcrum are real in any way whatsoever, at least from thenpn so, yeah do a hood  thing, play some good songs which is what mine Are and you will probably quickly feel tired and sendail, butmyounarr a fucking postal player, i mean thats whatbyou intend to mess with, have a hreat floght vacknfrom wherew ot the fuck? You think you are man because I am pretty much like so surr that if it crashes the only thing that lives isy daughter man and no, You can&#39;t have her or Anything what soever so I&#39;m taking a pause to remind you that i font carr and i forgot that if Agatha Christy was a &quot;god writer&quot; you should give my daughter a cool pen so she can force it through your right eye, and i know &quot;man&quot; that she not willing to\nSo since I already have a d use a very nice pen that shows how I&#39;ve already not spent six months in the state hospital\nGo back to hell you Fucking Fascist white man from hellfrom \nI know he did it",
