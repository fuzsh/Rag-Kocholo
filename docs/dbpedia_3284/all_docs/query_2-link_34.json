        "text": "If you’ve been reading Spider-Man Unlimited Infinity Comic #39 and #40, you’ll know writer Scott Aukerman and artist Federico Sabbatini have put Spider-Man through the paces. He fought Vulture, and now he’s up against a real bruiser. He’s trying to get his date game on but keeps running into these bad guys.\n\nIn chapter #40, a potential romantic superhero partner enters the scene, though, and after running through some name ideas like Spider-Lass, chapter #42 reveals she’s now going by a new name.\n\nWhat’s that name? Web-Head!\n\nThe new name came about after Spider-Man was knocked out, and she showed off some particularly useful powers. Web-Head has two powers worth noting that have not yet been revealed until this week’s issue. Those powers include a “Hypno-Blast” and a “Spider-Sault.” Yes, the puns run deep with this series.\n\nWhat do you think of the name Web-Head? Will it stick, and will Web-Head show up in any future issues, maybe another Secret Wars? Let us know in the comments."
