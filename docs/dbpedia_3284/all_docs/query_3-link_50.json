        "text": "Writer Scott Aukerman has been pushing Spider-Man to date in the Marvel Unlimited comic series, and it looks like a superhero Spider-Man-looking character may be next in his sights. In the first two issues of his story, Spider-Man Unlimited Infinity Comic #39 and #40, Spider-Man has had bad luck with a date due to villains getting in the way, but it appears a new character has dropped into his lap that could be his next love interest.\n\nIntroduced in today’s Spider-Man Unlimited Infinity Comic #41, the character sports a purple costume and wears a spider on her chest. But what’s her name? As it turns out, she’s new to this and doesn’t have one, but she is enamored by Spider-Man.\n\nListen to the latest episode of our weekly comics podcast!\n\nGiven Spider-Man’s terrible ability to make jokes his suggested superhero names for her don’t go over well.\n\nBut what are her powers? So far, it appears she has a spider-sense, fighting abilities and…\n\nThe ability to shoot spikes or goo at her enemies via spider arms! Given Federico Sabbatini’s cool design and the unique position she is in to save Spider-Man, it won’t be long before she’s fighting in the Spider-Verse I’m sure. That is, unless Aukerman kills her, the ruffian!"
