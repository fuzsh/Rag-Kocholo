        "text": "Why?\n\nSpider-man Unlimited comes to mind because of the first two issues being the beginning and end of Maximum Carnage story. Those two issues were from volume one. The rest of the series has no big interest outside of some early Tony Daniel and Mike Deodato Jr Spider-man covers.\n\nSpider-man Unlimited vol. 2\n\nHow many of you remember this short lived show called Spider-man Unlimited? Did you know they did a shorter comic series to?\n\nSpider-man Unlimited vol.3 and X-men Unlimited vol. 2\n\nTwo series I never really stopped to look at before. Spider-man Unlimited and X-men Unlimited brought different artists and writers for each issue. Many of the artists I love did a cover or story in one of these books. If not their first work it was some of their earliest. These are books with no value, but have some awesome covers.\n\nWrap Up\n\nI love series where new artists and writers get a chance to work. I don’t feel like that happens much today. As I have interviewed more and more artists from different eras of comics it’s nice to find out where they got their start. Nowadays it feels like an artist has to sell themselves on IG to get noticed by a smaller publisher and then decide if they want to work for the big two. I don’t see many of these self-contained story series anymore. Many will start as a digital comic and if well received they can become a paper comic. To all the crazy store variant chasers out there who are not interested in the stories. Check out the beautiful covers that can be found for cover or less, rather than dropping $20-$40 on a store exclusive. If you like rare these books had small print runs by the end of the series there were only 16k being printed.\n\nMy checklist of writers and artists i typically buy that are in these books."
