        "text": "There are a lot of superheroes in this issue, as Flash Barry Allen leads the young Flashes in a race across the world to tackle multiple incursions of extradimensional menaces.\n\nBut my big hero is his wife, Iris Allen.\n\nYes, it’s Amanda Waller, ubiquitous in current DC books, and equally annoying in every one. Here she’s getting heavy with a podcast host who’s invited Iris on to defend superheroes in the wake of Waller’s attempts to turn the public against them.\n\nOK, Iris doesn’t persuade Waller to stop picking on podcasters, but at least she’s showing the old bat that people can see through her power-building nonsense. When former members of the (ridiculously) disbanded Justice League are allowing the Wall to strip the Hall of Justice of their souvenirs and weapons, it’s time someone stepped up.\n\nMr Terrific, Wally West’s boss, does protest via hologram when she raids TerrificTech – he’s on JSA business this month – but as an ordinary person getting in Waller’s face, Iris is my MVP.\n\nMind, after issues of being in a funk, Barry is on amazing form, separately teaming-up with a quarter of individual speedsters at once.\n\nActually, not all the young metas he’s working with this time are connected to the Speed Force… Jules Joirdain, the tragically named Circuit Breaker, uses his connection to the Still Force – it’s a thing – to, hmm, do stuff. Anyway, Jules is trying hard in mad circumstances and making a difference\n\nPoor Barry, though, is having to concentrate incredibly hard to stay focused enough to pretty much be in four places at once; things get a tad easier when he has Jesse Quick, Kid Flash and the Flash of China in the same location, but still, he’s so frazzled that he’s getting under everyone’s feet.\n\nMeanwhile, in Keystone City, Wally West’s pal and colleague the Pied Piper, reformed supervillain Hartley Rathaway, calls at his home to tell him about Waller’s heavy handed visit to TerrificTech. He’s not there – son Jai reckons he’s with the Titans – but there is someone around who might be able to help.\n\nWally isn’t with the Titans, he’s in that weird garden gallery he’s been getting sucked into since his powers started working in new ways. He’s in the final panel of this issue, and not in a good way.\n\nWife Linda isn’t seen at all, she’s having a lie-down as she deals with the suspicious depression that’s descended on her. Still, the absence of our leads doesn’t stop this issue being a fascinating chapter in Simon Spurrier’s tale of ‘cosmic horror’. Barry’s efforts to dial down the chaos levels, Iris’ confrontation with Waller, the continuing hints that Inspector Pilgrim is a future/alternate Jai… it all makes for an absorbing read. Spurrier even finds room for (what I think is) a good-natured pop at critics who say his run is a little too intellectual.\n\nThe idea that reality is breaking down due to speedsters using their abilities is brought up once more, but I don’t believe that, not with all the interfering aliens with annoying speech patterns we’ve seen pop up. They’re not here this time, which is a relief, but we do get the Flash Rogues we’ve been waiting for since a last page cameo a couple of issues ago. Intriguingly, they look to include a shadowy Pied Piper type who may or may not be blowing Mr Mind.\n\nWe also get some tremendous visuals, courtesy of Ramon Perez and Vasco Georgiev – there’s a real sense of chaos breaking into the world of Earth-0, and sense of speed as Barry and co run right at it. We see but the legs of a giant spider but have no doubt, I’m going to have nightmares tonight. The storytelling is spot-on, and the determination and frustration of Barry is well portrayed.\n\nThe tones and textures of Sofie Dodgson and Matt Herms are excellent from beginning to end, adding to the sense of otherworldly menace, while Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou’s lettering is a pleasure throughout.\n\nAs for the striking cover, it’s the work of Ramon Perez.\n\nI enjoyed this issue enormously, for the way it shows heroism in the face of different forms of madness and malevolence. Simon Spurrier artfully weaves the Waller nonsense into his story without things being derailed – hopefully we won’t see Waller again in this storyline, which continues in the upcoming Flash Annual. And if things wrap up there, all the better!"
