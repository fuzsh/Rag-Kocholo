        "text": "Stan Lee, the American legendary comic book writer started in 1942 as an editorial assistant for Timely Comics, during which time he met John Romita. The Manhattan-born Lee wrote, art-directed and edited most of Marvelâ€™s series, becoming one of the most important figures in the creation of the Marvel Universe.\n\nJohn Romita Sr., the celebrated comics artist began drawing The Amazing Spider-Man in 1966, served as an art director at Marvel for two decades and was later inducted in the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2002, followed by the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame in 2020. An instrumental part in the creation of multiple Marvel characters, the late great John Romita Sr. was best known for his realistic, naturalist and fluid art style."
