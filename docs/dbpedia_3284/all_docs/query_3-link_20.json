It was later resurrected in 1999 as a sort of twisted Spider-Man: The Animated Series/Fox TV spin-off Spider- Man Unlimited (Vol. 2) that lasted only five issues before also being canceled.\n\nThe series was again resurrected in 2004 Spider-Man Unlimited (Vol. 3), which is currently an on-going title presenting a pair of Spidey stories each issue."
