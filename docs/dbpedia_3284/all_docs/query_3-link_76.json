        "text": "I found a fan-made ending to Spider-Man Unlimited animated show from 1999 on YouTube that not only works in its own right as the finale to the series (23 years after the show was abruptly cancelled on a cliffhanger) with no holds barred approach to the narrative beats but also finds a way to put a brilliant spin & adapt such iconic Spidey storylines as Venom(specifically the end of ASM #299with MJ's first horrific encounter with Venom), Kraven's Last Hunt, Maximum Carnage & Life Story\n\nCheck it out, it's mind-blowingly good & the world should see this for sure. Feels like it was made as a labor of love for Spider-Man as a character across both the animation & comics mediums:\n\nFelt like it was my duty to share this with everyone."
