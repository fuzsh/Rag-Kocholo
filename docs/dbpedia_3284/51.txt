Writer Scott Aukerman has been pushing Spider-Man to date in the Marvel Unlimited comic series, and it looks like a superhero Spider-Man-looking character may be next in his sights. In the first two issues of his story, Spider-Man Unlimited Infinity Comic #39 and #40, Spider-Man has had bad luck with a date due to villains getting in the way, but it appears a new character has dropped into his lap that could be his next love interest.

Introduced in today’s Spider-Man Unlimited Infinity Comic #41, the character sports a purple costume and wears a spider on her chest. But what’s her name? As it turns out, she’s new to this and doesn’t have one, but she is enamored by Spider-Man.
