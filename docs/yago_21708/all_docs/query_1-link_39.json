And he can prove it at any court.. from April 7th, 1502\n\nDoes blood matter that much? If someone has the ability to restore the Empire that person should rule it.\n\nYes, I agree.\n\nBut since nobody knows if that will ever happen, let alone in which decade, century, or millennium, nor what future person might restore the \"Byzantine\" empire, all we could do would be to guess that it might be someone named, for example, Ottfrid Demuth in 2514, or Wang Li in 5452, or Chandra Singh in 4645, or any of an infinite number of possible names and dates.\n\nBesides, as you may remember there were often one or more co emperors along with the ruling emperor. So if the eastern Roman Empire is restored in the future it might have a ruling emperor (more or less equivalent to an American President or a British Prime Minister) and one or more reigning co emperors (more or less equivalent to modern symbolic monarchs) who will be the heirs of one or more past dynasties.\n\nAnd since it might be inconvenient to have a hundred or so co emperors being the rival heirs of two dozen imperial dynasties, it might be a good idea to identify as many heirs as possible in case someone ever wants to form an Association of Claimants to the Roman Empire, one of its functions being encouraging intermarriage between heirs and thus the combination of many rival claims into fewer ones.\n\nHere is another descent from the Palaiologos Dynasty, going through more famous persons.\n\nIt begins with the Margrave of Montferrat in Italy, William V the Old, reigning from 1136 to 1191. Four of his five sons sought fame and glory in the east, becoming a Byzantine caesar, a count, and two kings.\n\nBoniface I (c. 1150-1207), leader of the fourth Crusade in 1204, was expected to be chosen Latin Emperor, but instead founded the Kingdom of Thessalonica. By his first wife he had had William VI (c.1173-1226) Margrave of Montferrat, and by his second wife he had Demetrius (c.1205-1230), second King of Thessalonica. King Demetrius's kingdom was conquered by the forces of Epirus in 1224 and Demetrius willed his kingdom to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in 1230. In 1239 Emperor Fredreick invested Boniface II of Montferrat with the Kingdom, making Boniface the Titular king of Thessalonica (TKT).\n\nThe succession to the Margravate of Montferrat was usually by male preference primogeniture or agnatic primogeniture. If a margrave died without surviving sons but with surviving daughters, the succession would go to his brother or other closest relative in the male line instead of to his daughters. It could only pass through female lines if the entire male dynasty became extinct.\n\n1) William VI (c.1173-1226)\n\n2) Boniface II (1202-1253/55) son. (TKT).\n\n3) William VII (c. 1240-1292) son. (TKT).\n\n4) John I (c. 1275-1305) son. (TKT). The dynasty became extinct with him.\n\nEmperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1239-1332) married Anna of Hungary (c. 1260-1281) and had co emperor Michael IX (1277-1320), ancestor of Constantine XI and Thomas Palaiologos. Andronikos II married Yolanda/Irene of Montferrat (c.1274-1317), sister of John I, and when he died in 1305 Andronikos claimed to unite the titular Kingdom of Thessalonica with the \"Byzantine\" Empire. Andronikos and Yolanda/Irene had several sons. Despot John Palaiologos (c.1286-1308) was the oldest but was not sent to Italy, Bartholomaios the second son died young, and so the third son Theodore Palaiologos (c.1290-1338)) was sent to become Margrave of Montferrat.\n\nTheodore could have claimed that Andronikos was only King of Thessalonika by right of his wife (jure uxoris) during her lifetime, or at most during Andronikos's lifetime and that Theodore became the rightful king of Thessalonica in 1317 or 1332.\n\n1) Theodore I Palaiologos (c.1290-1338). Nephew.\n\n2) John II (1321-1372). Son.\n\n3) Secondotto (c.1360-1378). Son.\n\n4) John II (c.1362-1381).

Brother.\n\nWar of the Mantuan Succession (1627-1631).\n\nMantua was acquired by Charles I (1580-1637) Duke of Mantua, Duke of Rethel and Nevers. Cousin. Son of Louis Gonzaga (1539-1595) Duke of Nevers and Rethel, younger son of Frederigo II Gonzaga and Margherita Palaeologina.\n\n20) Charles I (1580-1637) Duke of Mantua.

Last Gonzaga of Mantua.\n\nFerdinand Charles sided with France in the war of the Spanish Succession and was declared a traitor and his duchies were confiscated. Ferdinand Charles's nearest relative and heir was Duke Leopold (1679-1729) of Lorraine. Leopold was the son of Duke Charles V of Lorraine and Eleanor of Austria (1653-1697) who married first King Michael I of Poland and had no children.\n\nEleanor of Austria was the daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III and his third wife Eleanora Gonzaga (1630-1686) daughter of Charles Gonzaga (1609-1631) the grandfather of Ferdinand Charles.\n\n23) Duke Leopold (1679-1729) of Lorraine.

Franz Ferdinand made an unequal marriage with Countess Sophie Chotek in 1900 and their children were barred from inheriting the Austrian throne, being merely princes and Dukes of Hohenberg.\n\nIf the rule against unequal marriages is accepted in the case of succession to the Palaiologos Margraves of Montferrat in Italy and the Kingdom of Thessalonica, the heirs after Emperor Franz Josef would be:\n\n30) Charles I (1887-1922) Emperor of Austria.

Son.\n\n32) Karl Von Habsburg (born 1961) Son.\n\nThis has been the list of heirs of Theodore I Palaiologos by male only (or agnatic) primogeniture. but if the more familiar to English speakers rule of male preference primogeniture is followed, in which a daughter can inherit if her father has no sons, a somewhat different list of heirs can be traced.\n\n1) Theodore I Palaiologos (c.1290-1338)\n\n2) John II (1321-1372).

Son.\n\nSo Karl Von Habsburg, Georg Duke of Hohenberg, and Guillaume, Prince of Windisch-Graetz are the three possible heirs of Austrian Emperor Franz Josef. According to the succession laws of the Austrian Empire Karl von Habsburg is the heir to the Austrian Empire, but those succession laws have little say about inheriting the rights to long forgotten realms and claims. So any of those three could claim to be the heir of the Palaiologos Dynasty, or at least the Montferrat branch. And perhaps decide to change their family name to Habsburg-Palaeologus or something.\n\nI will start with a pure genealogical claim.\n\nEmperor Constantine XI (1405-1453) had no children.\n\nHis younger brothers Demitrios (c. 1407-1470) and Thomas (c.1409-1465) Palaiologos ruled as Despots in the Morea. They quarreled too much to chose either of them as the next emperor, and in 1460 the Ottomans conquered the Morea.\n\nDemetrios lived in the Ottoman empire and his daughter Helena Palaiologina (1442-1470) may have entered the harem of Sultan Mehmed II, but it has been said Mehmed feared she might poison him and didn't take her.\n\nThomas Palaiologos moved to Rome after the fall of the Morea and was recognized as the rightful Emperor. His elder son Andreas (1453-1502) succeeded as titular Emperor and died without any known children, though some legitimate or illegitimate ones have been alleged. The younger brother Manuel Palaiologos (1455-1512) eventually returned to Constantinople and sold his rights to the throne to Sultan Mehmed II. His older son John died young, and his younger son Andreas became a Muslim.\n\nThomas Palaiologos had a younger daughter Zoe/Sophia Palaiologina (c.1440/1449-1503 who famously married Ivan III the Great, Grand Prince of Moscow in 1472. Their last known descendant as Maria Vladimirovna of Starista (c. 1550-1610) wife of King Magnus of Livonia (1540-1583).\n\nBut the older daughter of Thomas Palaiologos was Helena Palaiologina (1431-1473) who married Lazar Brankovic, Despot of Serbia, in 1446. Their eldest daughter Jelena/Maria (c.1447-1500) married King Stephen Tomasevic of Bosnia in 1459 but had no known children. Their youngest daughter Jerina married Gjon Kastrioti II (1456-1502), the son of Skanderbeg, who became Duke of San Pietro in Galatina in 1485.\n\nThe middle daughter of Helena and Lazar, Milica Brankovic (died 1464) married Leonardo III Tocco in 1463. Their son Carlo III Tocco (1464-1518) was the titular ruler of Epirus (Arta) and Zakynthos. Carlo III was the father of Leonard IV Tocco, father of Franceso di Tocco, Lord of Refrancore (died 1598), father of Leonardo V di Tocco, Despot of Arta, Prince of Acaja (1591-1641), father of Antonio di Tocco, Prince of Acaja (died 1678), father of Carlo di Tocco, 3rd Prince of Montemiletto (died 1701), father of Leonardo di Tocco, count of Monataperto (1698-1776), father of Restaino di Tocco Cantalmo-Stuart, 5th Prince of Montemiletto (1730-1796), father of Carlo 6th Prince of Montemiletto (1756-1824), father of Francesco, 7th Prince of Montemiletto (1790-1877), father of Carlo, 8th Prince of Montemiletto (1827-1888), the last of the lineage.\n\nCarlo di Tocco Cantelmo Stuart, 6th prince of Montemiletto, * 1756 | Geneall.net\n\nWilliam Miller, in The Latins in the Levant: the history of Frankish Greece (1204-1566) 1908, pages 452-455, and 485-489 mentions the Palaiologous and Tocco heirs of the \"Byzantine\" Empire. He says the Toccos claimed the Despotate of Arta but eventually started to claim the Principality of Achaia instead:\n\nhttps://archive.org/stream/latinsinlevanta00millgoog#page/n519/mode/2up\n\nCarlo Capece Galeota (1824-1908), Duke of Regina, etc., Prince of Montemiletto and Achaia, etc. was the son of Francesco (1783-1838), Duke of Regina, etc, and Maddalena di Tocco Cantalmo Stuart, daughter of Carlo, 6th Prince of Montemiletto. His daughter Maria Maddalena (1859-1933) married Giuseppi Carelli.\n\nFamiglia Capece Galeota\n\nCarlo, 6th Prince of Montemiletto, had a daughter Teresa (1781-1832) who married Guiseppi Serra, 5th Duke of Cassano (1771-1837), and they were parents of Luigi Serra, 6th Duke of Cassano (1810-1883), father of Francesco Serra, 7th Duke of Cassano (1843-1917), father of Guiseppi Serra, 8th duke of Cassano (1867-1918) who died childless and was succeeded by his brother Luigi Serra, 9th Duke of Cassano (1868-1935), father of Francesco Serra, 10th Duke of Cassano (1914-1998), father of Luigi Serra, 11th Duke of Cassano (born 1939).\n\nLuigi Serra duke of Cassano, marquess of Rivadebro e Serra, * 1939 | Geneall.net\n\nAlternate history.com has a thread \"Recent male line descendants of Byzantine dynasties\" that has a post by January First-of-May dated March 30, 2014 giving the succession of Tocco and Serra heirs. But the Capece Galeota heirs from 1888-1933 are omitted.\n\nRecent male line descendants of Byzantine dynasties | Alternate History Discussion\n\nSchwennicke, Detlev (1978–1995), Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten, Neue Folge (\"European Family Trees: Family Trees for the History of European States, New Series\"), Marburg, Germany: J. A. Stargardt - does have pages with the Tocco family tree. As I remember a number of daughters married other families of the Neapolitan nobility. The online index puts the Tocco family in Volume III, tables 594-596.\n\nT - Vittorio Klostermann ? Philosophie, Recht, Literatur, Bibliothek\n\nSo as far as I can tell, at the present time Luigi Serra, 11th Duke of Cassano (born 1939), is the rightful heir by genealogy of Thomas Palaiologos, who was accepted in Western Europe as the titular \"Byzantine\" Emperor in exile.\n\nGreat post indeed. Thank you for your time. If you have any knowledge on the Byzantine nobles in the Ottoman era, I would love to hear.\n\nDidn't a brother or nephew of Constantine XI \"sell\" his claim to king Charles VIII of France?\n\nConstantine XI's brother Thomas Palaiologos, co despot of the Morea until the Turkish conquest in 1460, moved to Rome and was recognized in the west as the rightful Emperor until his death in 1465. His son Andreas Palaiologos (1453-1502) inherited his claim to the empire.\n\nAndreas is said to have sold his right to the Empire to King Charles VIII of France in 1494 and again to King Ferdinand II of Aragon, etc., in 1502. I don't know how legal those transactions were.\n\nCharles VIII (1470-1498) died without surviving children. Only two of his siblings lived to adulthood. Although Joan (1464-1505) was briefly queen of france, and became a saint, she didn't have any children. Anne (1461-1522) married but outlived her children.\n\nKing Charles VII (1403-1461), grandfather of Charles VIII, had only two children with descendants to the present day. The elder of those two daughters was Yolande (1434-1478) wife of Duke Amadeus IX of Savoy. their elder daughter with descendants to this day, Anne of savoy (1455-1480) married the future King Frederick IV of Sicily-Naples and had a daughter Charlotte (1479/80-1506). Charlotte married Guy XVI, count of Laval, and had daughter Anne (1505-1554)\n\n1) King Charles VII (1470-1498) of France. Bought claim in 1494.\n\n2) Anne (1461-1522) Duchess of Bourbon.

Son.\n\nPrince Charles-Antoine Lamoral of Ligne-La Tremoille can not only claim to be the heir to Charles VIII's claim to the \"Byzantine\" empire, but he is also the heir to Charlotte's claim to the throne of her father Frederick IV.\n\nFrederick IV's title was:\n\nFredericus Dei Gratia Rex Sicilie, Hierusalem etc.\n\n+\n\n\"Frederick by the Grace of God King of Sicily, Jerusalem, etc.\" Naples.
