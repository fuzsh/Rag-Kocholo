        "text": "Caption\n\nThe popularity of Carlo Emmanuele III in England, as indicated by the number of portraits of him formerly in English collections, is striking. It must partly have been due to his martial valour, and partly to his having been Englandâ€™s ally in Europe. Charles Emmanuel III succeeded his father Victor Amadeus (Vittorio Amedeo II) (1661-1732). He married three times and was succeeded by the eldest surviving son of his second marriage, King Victor Amadeus II (Vittorio Amedeo III) (1726-1796), whose portrait is also at Ickworth. He was a born soldier and took a distinguished part in the War of the Polish Succession. The head is taken from the full-length by Clementina, with the Battle of Guastalla of 1734 in the background, in the Gallery at Turin, which was at one time attributed to Van Loo. This painting was almost certainly acquired by George William Hervey, 2nd Earl of Bristol (1721-1775) when envoy at Turin, 1755-58.\n\nSummary\n\nOil painting on canvas, King Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy, King of Sardinia (1701-1772) by Maria Giovanna Clementi (1690-1761) and Studio, circa 1755-1758 (after an earlier orginal). A half-length portrait turned slightly to the left, gazing at the spectator, fair complexion powdered wig, wearing ermine and crimson cloak, jewelled chain and Order of the Annunciation, a sceptre held in his right hand, a royal crown placed to the left of him.\n\nProvenance\n\nAlmost certainly acquired by George William Hervey, 2nd Earl of Bristol (1721-1775) when envoy at Turin, 1755-58, and, possibly with NT 851712 and NT 851713, especially copied for him; thence by inheritance and descent until the death of Frederick, 4th Marquess of Bristol (1863-1951), when valued for probate; accepted, with the house and part of the estate, by HM Treasury in lieu of death duties in 1956, and transferred to the National Trust.\n\nCredit line\n\nIckworth, The Bristol Collection (acquired through the National Land Fund and transferred to The National Trust in 1956)\n\nMakers and roles\n\nMaria Giovanna Clementi, called La Clementina (1690-1761) and Studio, artist\n\nReferences\n\nFarrer 1908 Edmund Farrer, Portraits in Suffolk Houses (West), 1908, no. 17, p.202\n\nView more details"
