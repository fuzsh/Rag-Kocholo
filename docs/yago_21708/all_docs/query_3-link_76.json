The marriage was never consummated: while travelling to meet his bride, the Archduke fell seriously ill and died in Innsbruck twelve days after the marriage.\n\nSecond marriage\n\nHedwig's second marriage, in Sulzbach on 9 April 1668, was with Duke Julius Francis of Saxe-Lauenburg (1641–1689). Her father had a memorial stone erected in the Sulzbach parish church to commemorate the event.[1] Hedwig had been assured an annual income of 20000guilders at her first marriage; Julius Francis made a deal with the imperial court, in which Hedwig would receive a lump sum instead.\n\nDeath\n\nHedwig died in 1681 and was buried in the White Castle at Ostrov (German: Schlackenwerth).\n\nIssue\n\nHedwig from her second marriage had the following children:\n\nAnna Maria Theresia (1670–1671)\n\nAnna Maria Franziska (1672–1741)\n\nmarried firstly in 1690 Count Palatine Philip William of Neuburg (1668–1693)\n\nmarried secondly 1697 Grand Duke Gian Gastone de' Medici of Tuscany (1671–1737)\n\nSybille (1675–1733)\n\nmarried in 1690 Margrave Louis William of Baden-Baden (1655–1707)\n\nReferences and sources"
