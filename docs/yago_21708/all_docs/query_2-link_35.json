Popes Paul II (1464-1471); Sixtus IV (1471-1484); Julius II (1503-1513) and Clement VII (1523-1534) all bear witness that this is the same in which our Lord was wrapped.'\n\n1768 - Giovanni Bernardo Vigo (1719-1805), professor of rhetoric at Turin University publishes De Sindone evangelica dedicated to Duke Charles Emmanuel III\n\n1769 16 June - Private showing of the Shroud for Emperor Joseph II of Hapsburg-Lorraine. The Shroud is then displayed from the balcony of the Royal Chapel for large crowd gathered in the Cathedral below\n\n1773 - Death of Duke Charles Emmanuel III\n\n1775 - Reign of Duke Victor Amadeus III.\n\n15 October - The marriage of Piedmont Prince Charles Emmanuel (IV) with Princess Marie Clotilde of France is marked by a showing of the Shroud with same ceremonial as used in 1750\n\n1778 - The genealogist Guichenon describes the Shroud as a 'preservative against all kinds of accidents'\n\n1789 25 April - Marriage of Prince Victor Emmanuel (I) with Princess Maria Teresa of Austria\n\n1792 - Revolutionaries of the French Revolution break into the French royal relic collection in the Sainte Chapelle, Paris. The chapel's 'fragment du S.Suaire' is destroyed, along with its 'sainte toelle' and other objects with possible Shroud links.\n\n1796 - Accession of Charles Emmanuel IV of Savoy\n\n1798 9 December - Forced to leave Turin and withdraw to Sardinia, Charles Emmanuel IV venerates the Shroud with the rest of the royal family before their departure\n\n1802 - Abdication of Charles Emmanuel IV as King of Sardinia\n\n1804 13 November - Private showing of the Shroud for the visit to Turin of Pope Pius VII, who is virtually a prisoner en route from Rome to Paris to crown Napoleon, who has insisted that he be crowned by none other than the pope. According to Sanna Solaro '...The Pope knelt down to venerate it [the Shroud], then examined it in every part, kissing it with tender devotion.' Seven cardinals, eight bishops and many other notables were present.\n\n1814 20 May - Solemn showing of the Shroud to mark the return of the royal family, in the person of Victor Emmanuel I. This is the first full public showing of the Shroud since 1775.\n\n1815 21 May - Pope Pius VII's second presiding over an exposition of the Shroud, this time marking his return to Italy after Napoleon's defeat. He personally displays it from the balcony of the Palazzo Madama. On the Shroud being returned to its casket the latter is sealed with the papal and royal seals\n\n1822 4 January - Showing of the Shroud to mark the start of the reign of Charles Felix, following the abdication of his brother Victor Emmanuel I. This is held out first in the Royal Chapel, in the presence of the royal family, then displayed from the Chapel balustrade for the benefit of the ordinary populace in the Cathedral below.\n\n1842 4 May - Showing of the Shroud to mark the marriage of Crown Prince Victor Emmanuel (II) with Maria Adelaide, Archduchess of Austria. The making of a daguerrotype of the Shroud on this occasion is considered but rejected. Among the crowds on this occasion is Don Bosco, founder of the Salesian order, then only 27\n\n1868 24-27 April - During the brief archbishopric of Alessandro Riccardi dei Conti di Netro, one marked by exceptional pastoral care, the Shroud is shown in this year to mark the marriage of Prince Umberto of Savoy with Princess Margaret. Instead of a brief holding up of the cloth in the cathedral or from a balcony of the Palazzo Madama as had happened in 1815 and 1842, the Shroud is properly displayed on a board on the cathedral high altar for four days. Don Bosco again attends, accompanied by boys from his Oratory.\n\n28 April - Working on her knees, the 25 year old Princess Clotilde of Savoy (1843-1911), daughter of Victor Emmanuel II and wife of Prince Gerolamo Napoleon, changes the Shroud's former lining cloth of black silk that had been sewn on by Bl. Sebastian Valfre back in 1694, replacing this with one of crimson taffeta. An official record of this, with sample of the former black silk lining, is preserved in Turin. On this same occasion Princess Clotilde removes a thread that 110 years later will be considered, and rejected, for radiocarbon dating. On this same date the Shroud is 'scrupulosamente' measured by Monsignor Gastaldi, then bishop of Aluzzo, and later archbishop of Turin, and found (wrongly) to be 410cm. x 140 cm.\n\n1898 25 May - Beginning of eight day exposition of the Shroud on the occasion of Italy's fiftieth anniversary as a kingdom ruled by the House of Savoy . Because Gastaldi measured the Shroud incorrectly in 1868, the frame in which it is displayed is made too short and too wide. To compensate for his miscalculation of the length, both ends of the cloth are therefore folded under. Secondo Pia takes two trial photographs of the Shroud using short exposures with 21 x 27 cm plates. These reproduce poorly because of uneven lighting. Although the Shroud is displayed on this day without glass, for the rest of the exposition protective plate glass is ordered at the insistence of Princess Clotilde\n\n28 May - Second, official photographing of the Shroud by Secondo Pia, this time with two large 50 x 60 cm plates, one of 14 minute exposure, the second of 12 minutes, as well as some smaller plates. Turin Cathedral's head of security, Lieutenant Felice Fino, and Father Sanno Salaro, both keen amateur photographers, also take photographs.\n\nMidnight - Pia begins developing the negatives, discovering that the image becomes 'photographic' when the light values are reversed.\n\n2 June - The Shroud is returned to its casket in the Royal Chapel\n\n13 June - First press account of Pia's discovery in Genoa's Il Cittadino\n\n14 June - The story of Pia's discovery is told in the national newspaper Corriere Nazionale"
