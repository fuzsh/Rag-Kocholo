        "text": "Script error: No such module \"SDcat\".\n\nThis is a list of notable women, either famous themselves or closely associated with someone well known, who suffered maternal death as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO):\n\n\"the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.\"\n\nNote that this wording includes abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, and ectopic pregnancy. Generally, there is a distinction between a direct maternal death that is the result of a complication of the pregnancy, delivery, or management of the two, and an indirect maternal death that is a pregnancy-related death in a woman with a pre-existing or newly developed health problem unrelated to pregnancy. Fatalities during but unrelated to a pregnancy are termed accidental, incidental, or non-obstetrical maternal deaths.\n\nHowever, the WHO definition is only one of many; other definitions may include accidental and incidental causes. Cases with \"incidental causes\" include deaths secondary to violence against women that may be related to the pregnancy and be affected by the socioeconomic and cultural environment. Also, it has been reported Template:By whomthat about 10% of maternal deaths may occur late, that is after 42 days after a termination or delivery; thus, some definitions extend the period of observation to one year after the end of gestation.\n\nWomen by country[]\n\nAngola[]\n\nIvone Mufuca (2016), handball player\n\nAustralia[]\n\nLouisa Jones (1829), settler of the Swan River colony and first European woman to die in Western Australia.\n\nElizabeth Jane Hunter (1857), maternal aunt of Gustave Slapoffski (she died in England)\n\nHattie Shepparde (1874), first wife of Henry Hallam\n\nDaphne Akhurst (1933), five time consecutive winner of women's singles title at the Australian Championships from 1925 to 1930.\n\nDoreen Harrison (1953), mother of serial killer Catherine Birnie.\n\nRona Glynn (1965)\n\nAustria[]\n\nJoanna of Austria (1578), Grand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nAnna of Austria, Queen of Spain (1580)\n\nMargaret of Austria (1611), Queen of Spain and Portugal\n\nMaria Anna of Spain (1646), youngest daughter of King Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria, who also died in childbirth\n\nMaria Leopoldine of Austria (1649), Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia\n\nMaria Antonia of Austria (1692), first wife of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria\n\nMaria Anna of Austria (1744)\n\nElisabeth of Württemberg (1790), Archduchess of Austria\n\nPrincess Hermine of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym (1817), Archduchess of Austria\n\nthe first wife of Johann Georg Hiedler (1824)\n\nMaria Leopoldina of Austria (1826), Empress of Brazil and Queen of Portugal\n\nChristine Ponthieure de Berlaere (1837), first wife of Louis Antoine Debrauz de Saldapenna\n\nAdelaide of Austria (1855), first wife of Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, future King of Italy\n\nKaroline Kohn (1888), mother of Käthe Braun-Prager\n\nAnna Schapire (1911), writer and translator, and first wife of Otto Neurath\n\nNora Kinsky (1923), mother of Countess Georgina von Wilczek\n\nArchduchess Helena of Austria (1924)\n\nBettina Strauss (1942), sister of Leo Strauss and second wife of Paul Kraus\n\nBelarus[]\n\nSophia Olelkovich Radziwill (1612)\n\nThe mother of Ivan Kulesh (1986)\n\nBelgium[]\n\nFernande de Cartier de Marchienne (1903), mother of Marguerite Yourcenar\n\nBohemia[]\n\nJudith of Bohemia (1086), Duchess of Poland\n\nJudith of Habsburg (1297), Queen of Bohemia\n\nMargaret of Bohemia (1322), daughter of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Judith of Habsburg, who also died in childbirth\n\nAgnes of Bohemia, Duchess of Jawor (1337)\n\nKunigunde of Sternberg (1449), days after she delivered twins, Catherine of Poděbrady (who later died of childbirth) and Sidonie\n\nCatherine of Poděbrady (1464), Bohemian princess, Queen of Hungary\n\nAnne of Foix-Candale (1506), Bohemian princess, Queen of Hungary, mother of Anne of Bohemia and Hungary, who later died in childbirth.\n\nApollonia of Poděbrady (1529)\n\nthe mother of Georg Handsch (1529)\n\nAnna of Bohemia and Hungary (1547), Bohemian Princess died while giving birth to Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, who later died in childbirth\n\nJuliane Reichardt (1783), pianist\n\nBolivia[]\n\nthe mother of Domitila Chúngara (1946)\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina[]\n\nBarbara del Balzo (1459), second wife of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača\n\nBrazil[]\n\nAna Guilhermina Borges (1891), wife of Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves\n\nFrancisca Chagas Pessoa (1895), first wife of Epitácio Pessoa\n\nMaria de Lurdes da Silva (1971), first wife of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva\n\nthe biological mother of Maria Eliane Jesus Mascarenhas (1976)\n\nRony Kuhn de Souza (1979), first wife of Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza and mother of Prince Pedro Thiago of Orléans-Braganza\n\nBulgaria[]\n\nPrincess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma (1899), mother of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria.\n\nBurma[]\n\nMwei Daw (1368), principal queen of King Binnya U of Martaban–Hanthawaddy, and the mother of King Razadarit.\n\nShin Myo Myat (1520s), mother of King Bayinnaung of Toungoo Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar), and wet nurse of King Tabinshwehti.\n\nHsinbyume (1812), first wife of Bagyidaw.\n\nByzantine Empire[]\n\nAelia Eudoxia (404), Empress consort of the Byzantine Emperor Arcadius\n\nTzitzak (750), first wife of Byzantine Emperor Constantine V\n\nEudokia Baïana (901), third wife of Leo VI the Wise.\n\nIrene Angelina (1208), Widow of Roger III of Sicily and Widow of Philip of Swabia, who died 2 months before her.\n\nCaterina Gattilusio (1464)\n\nCambodia[]\n\nSisowath Monikessan (1946), one of the wives of Norodom Sihanouk\n\nVichara Dany (1976), actress\n\nSaom Vansodany (1977), actress\n\nChang My-Huoy (1978), only wife of Haing S.
