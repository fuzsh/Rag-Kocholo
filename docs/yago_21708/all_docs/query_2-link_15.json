The main problem is would he become Emperor after Charles VI? I suppose he stands as good a chance as Francis Stephen did. Long term I suppose it bodes well for the Austrian position in Italy. Though the variables involving Lorraine, Tuscany and how the Habsburg succession is actually handled could easily upset things.\n\nI'm assuming you mean as his third wife.
