Her first London performance was as Nina in The Carnival of Naples (1830) which was followed by performances as Ophelia from Hamlet in which she was considered excellent, Rosalind, and Lady Teazle. She was the original Helen in The Hunchback (1832).

Traditionally, the grant was believed to have been granted in reperation for the death of her mother Matilda, who was left to starve to death at Corfe Castle, in Dorset (1211).\n\nOriginally Margaretâs community was of the Order of the Hospital of St John, but when she discovered that this required the sisters to travel abroad, she managed to have the order changed to the Augustinian rule. A lengthy dispute followed, but eventually Margaret prevailed, and she pleaded female ignorance as the reason for the original mistake. Widowed in 1241, Margaret was still living fourteen years later. She appears in the historical novel Lady of Hay (1986) by Barbara Erskine.\n\nLacy, Maud de - (c1225 - 1304)\n\nAnglo-Norman heiress\n\nMaud de Lacy was the daughter of Gilbert de Lacy, of Ewyas Lacy in Hereford, and his wife Lady Isabel le Bigod, the daughter of Hugh le Bigod, Earl of Norfolk. Through her father Maud was a descendant of Matilda de Braose, who was left to starve to death at Corfe Castle in Dorset by King John (1211).\n\nMaud was married firstly to Piers of Geneva, the elder son of Umberto, Count of Geneva (1195 - 1219), and his wife Agnes of Savoy, the sister of Tommaso II, Count of Savoy. Piers' death (1249) left Maud a childless widow.\n\nMaud was remarried secondly (c1251) to Sir Geoffrey de Joinville (c1226 - 1314), Seigneur de Vaucoleurs, the son of Simon de Joinville (died c1233), the Seneschal of Champagne, to whom she bore five sons including Sir Piers de Geneville (c1255 - 1292), of Ludlow Salop, and Wallerstone in Hereford, who left issue, and Gautier de Joinville (c1257 - 1303), who inherited the seigneurie of Vaucoleurs in France, and was killed in the Flemish wars.\n\nMaud's second husband received the barony of Geneville in England from King Edward I (1299), Geneville being the English pronunciation of the name Joinville. Her two elder sons Geoffrey and Piers pursued careers in England. Dame Maud de Geneville died (April 1, 1304). Her granddaughter Maud de Geneville (born 1291), named in her honour, became a nun with her sister Beatrice at Aconbury.\n\nLa Dame aux CameliasÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Plessis, Alphonsine\n\nLadd, Anna Coleman â (1878 â 1939)\n\nAmerican sculptor\n\nAnna Coleman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (July 15, 1878) and became the wife of Maynard Ladd.

Despite this background, her extraordinary beauty and equestrian skills caused her to be married (c1779) Sir John Lade (1759 â 1838), the friend and crony of George, Prince of Wales (IV).\n\nA skilled horsewoman, Lady Lade regularly attended the Windsor hunt. Though snubbed by the nobility, the Prince of Wales admired her skills with the horses. She once challenged a rival lady to drive a four in hand eight miles across Newmarket Heath for a wager of five hundred guineas, but her rival wisely declined. The Ladeâs entertained their own fashionable rakish crowd at their own house at Cantâs Hill, and at Brighton. Lady Lade prevailed upon the Prince to dance publicly with her, in order to facilitate her acceptance by upper society (1789). However, stiff resistance led by several prominent society ladies including the Duchess of Rutland, successfully prevented Letitia achieving her aim. Lady Lade died (May 5, 1825) at Egham.\n\nLa DeanaÂ Â Â see Â Â Aybar o Rodriguez, Manuela\n\nLadell, Ellen â (fl. 1856 â 1886)\n\nBritish painter\n\nEllen was the wife of the painter Edward Ladell, and specialized in flower studies and still-lifes of fruit.

She was married (c540 BC) to the Egyptian king, Amasis II, after he had failed in an attempt with the Libyans to conquer Kyrene and been defeated in battle near the spring of Theste.\n\nHerodotus recorded that the marriage long remained unconsummated, the king accusing Ladice of bewtiching him to impotence. These accusations were laid to rest when the king was finally able to sleep with her as her husband, after Ladice made tearful prayers at the the shrine of the goddess Aphrodite. In gratitude the queen sent a statue of the goddess to her temple on Kyrene.\n\nWhen her husband was taken prisoner after his defeat by the Persian king, Cambyses, Queen Ladice received the conqueror at Sais. The Persian treated her with great consideration, sending her back safely to her parents. Amasisâs son and successor, Psamtik III (c560 â 525 BC), was Ladiceâs stepson.\n\nLadies of Llangollen, theÂ Â Â Â see Â Â Â Butler, Lady EleanorÂ Â andÂ Â Ponsonby, Mary\n\nLadynina, Marina Alexievna - (1908 - 2003)\n\nRussian film actress\n\nMarina Ladynina was born (June 24, 1908) in Tyombino.

She married (c134 BC) Quintus Mucius Scaevola, consul (117 BC), also a famous orator. Her husband taught Cicero, who admired Laelia and compared her favourably with her father. She was also praised by Quintilian who nicknamed her âthe Wise.â\n\nHer daughter Mucia was married Lucius Licinius Crassus, consul (95 BC). Of Laeliaâs two granddaughters, Licinia Maior married Publius Scipio Nasica, whilst Licinia Minor married Gaius Marius, consul (82 BC), the son of the famous dictator and general.\n\nLaelia Balba (1) â (fl. c10 â c40 AD)\n\nRoman patrician\n\nLaelia Balba was the daughter of Decimus Laelius Balbus, consul ord. (6 BC), and the sister of Decimus Laelius Balbus, who served as quaestor in Africa under the Emperor Claudius I (41 â 42 AD). Laelia Balba was related to the Vestal virgin Laelia Balba, perhaps her sister. Her father was caught up in the scandal surrounding Julia Maior and Iullus Antonius (2 BC).\n\nLaelia Balba was married to Vibius Marsus, consul suffect (17 AD) under the Emperor Tiberius, and was the mother of Vibia Marsia, the wife of P. Plautius Pulcher, who served as quaestor (31 AD). She is attested by a surviving inscription from the Plautii mausoleum at Tibur, near Rome.\n\nLaelia Balba (2) â (c5 BC â 62 AD)\n\nRoman priestess\n\nWith ther death of the elderly Vibidia (c55 AD), Laelia Balba was chosen to serve as Chief Vestal Virgin (Virgo maxima) and died during the reign of the Emperor Nero. She was probably the daughter of Decimus Laelius Balbus, consul Ord. (6 BC), and the sister of Laelia Balba, the wife of the senator Vibius Marsus. Her death is recorded by the historian Tacitus in his Annales. She was succeeded as chief vestal by Cornelia, who was later put to death (90 AD) by order of the Emperor Domitian.\n\nLaeta, Aelia â (c361 â before 410 AD)\n\nRoman Augusta (383 AD)\n\nAelia Laeta was the daugher of a patrician matron named Tisamene (Pisamena), and became the second wife (383 AD) of the Emperor Gratian (375 â 383 AD), who was assasinated a few months afterwards. Their union was childless and Laeta survived Gratian as Empress Dowager.\n\nLaeta and her mother were granted state pensions and suitable estates by the Emperor Theodosius I, and she resided in a villa on the Aventine Hill in Rome. The future empress Galla Placidia, daughter of the Emperor Arcadius, was raised in her household there from 397 AD. During the siege of Rome in 400 AD by Alaric I of the Goths, when the food suply to the city was cut off, the empress used her considerable fortune to provide food for the inhabitants.\n\nEmpress Laeta appears to have died before the later sack of the city by Alaric (410 AD), who took Galla Placidia as hostage and then married her. Laeta is not mentioned in the sources at this time and had most probably died.\n\nLaeta, Caeonia (Leta) â (c378 â before 419 AD)\n\nRoman Christian patrician\n\nCaeonia Laeta was the daughter of Publius Caeonius Caecina Albinus, governor of Numidia in Africa, and was the great-granddaughter of Ceionius Rufius Albinus, consul 335 AD.

She was the mother to St Paula the younger (c399 â after 420 AD), whom she and her husband dedicated to God from birth, as a nun. St Jerome wrote Laeta a letter (c403 AD), giving her advice as to the proper training for her child. This letter is preserved in Jeromeâs Epistulae.

She was brought to the court where she was appointed as lady-in-waiting to Anne of Austria, wife of Louis XIII.\n\nCardinal Richelieu had encouraged the kingâs attraction for Louise, whom he had intended to use to foil the influence of Marie de Hautefort, but the affair ended quite different to his expectations. Mazarin had intended to use Louise to find out the kingâs private confidences, but instead she stiffened Louisâs resolve to remove himself from the sphere of Richelieuâs influence. Despite having the kingâs confidence, the affair remained strictly platonic, and Louise refused to become the kingâs mistress.\n\nLouise eventually retired from the court and became a nun (1637), though King Louis continued to visit her at her retreat for advice and counsel, and the two maintained a correspondence, though it was interfered with due to Richelieuâs agents. Louise de la Fayette died (Jan, 1665) as superior of the convent of Chaillot.\n\nLa Fayette, Marie Adrienne de Noailles, Marquise de â (1759 â 1807)\n\nFrench Ã©migrÃ© and memoirist\n\nMarie Adrienne Francoise de Noailles was born (Nov 2, 1759), the daughter of Louis de Noailles, Duc dâAyen, and his first wife Anne Henriette dâAguesseau, and was granddaughter of the Duc de Noailles.

She later joined her husband in his prison at Olmutz in Germany (1798), where she co-wrote a joint biography of her mother and autobiography with her daughter Virginie, Marquise de Lasteryie entitled La Vie de Madame la Duchesse dâAyen, in Vie de Madame de Madame de La Fayette par Mme de Lasteyrie, sa fille, precedee dâune Notice sur la vie de sa Mere, Mme la Duchesse dâAyen (1868) was published posthumously in Paris.

She was also on friendly terms with Henrietta Anne, Duchesse dâOrleans, sister-in-law of Louis XIV, and sister of Charles II of England. With the death of her husband (1683), the Comtesse retired from society to spend her last years in pious reflection.\n\nHer best known work was La Princesse de Cleves which was published anonymously (1678). Often inexactly termed the first âpsychologicalâ novel, it recounts the dilemma of the princesse who confesses to her husband that she loves the Duc de Nemours though she has remained a faithful wife. When the prince dies, the princesse then refuses to marry Nemours, and enters a convent.\n\nOther works included La Princesse de Montpensier (1662), Zayde (1670), numerous letters, published in 1880 as Lettres inedites (Unabridged Letters), and the posthumous works Historie de Mme Henriette dâAngleterre (1720) and La Comtesse de Fende (1724).
