Described as a remarkable woman, combining a strong sense of family pride with a wry sense of humour, she exerted a powerful influence on the childhood of her granddaughter Mary, Queen of Scots during the latter’s thirteen-year sojourn in France, and was one of her principal advisors, and acted as proxy for her daughter, Mary of Guise during the betrothal ceremony of the Queen of Scots and the Dauphin Francis in 1558.
