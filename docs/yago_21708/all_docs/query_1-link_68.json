        "text": "Intro\n\nMaria Theresa of Savoy (1756-1805) was a member of the French royal family due to her status as ‘Countess of Artois‘ as wife of Charles Philippe of France. Nineteen years after Maria Theresa’s death, her consort ascended the French throne under the name of King Charles X.\n\nHer son, Prince Louis Antoine, married Marie Antoinette’s daughter, Marie-Thérèse Charlotte. Maria Theresa was actually the mother of the last direct heirs of the House of Bourbon.\n\nMarriages in the French royal house\n\nPrincess Maria Theresa of Savoy was born on 31 January 1756 at the Royal Palace of Turin during the reign of her grandfather Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia. Daughter of the designated heir Victor Amadeus and his wife Maria Antonia of Spain, she was the third daughter of the couple and the fifth of twelve children.\n\nIn 1771, her eldest sister Marie Josephine of Savoy married Louis-Stanislaus of France, Count of Provence, the youngest grandson of King Louis XV and his popular wife, Queen Marie Leszczyńska, and younger brother of the Dauphin Louis, who had married the Austrian archduchess Marie Antoinette in 1770. On 16 November 1773, Maria Theresa in turn married another grandson of Louis XV, Charles Philippe of France, Count of Artois (the future Charles X). In 1775 it was the turn of Clotilde of France, sister of Louis XVI and the Counts of Provence and Artois, to marry Charles Emmanuel of Sardinia, brother of her sisters-in-law and heir to the Savoy throne.\n\nMaria Theresa was thus the sister-in-law of her sister Marie Josephine… and of the future Queen Marie Antoinette of France!\n\nHer sister had told her all the delights of the French court and her fiancé, but Maria Theresa remained mute and tired during the wedding festivities. Reputed to be ugly, insipid and shy, Maria Theresa paled in comparison to her brilliant, playful and, above all, frivolous husband. Shortly after the festivities, he left for Paris to join his mistress Rosalie Duthé. The courtiers said: ‘The Prince, having had indigestion from Savoyard cake, is off to Paris for tea‘.\n\nThe Countess of Artois’ pregnancies\n\nAt Versailles, Maria Theresa left many indifferent because of her appearance. She was described as ‘extremely small and heavy, like her sister Joséphine, with an exceptionally long nose‘. One English observer even cruelly described her as ‘a hungry witch‘. However, King Louis XV was pleased with her ‘beautiful complexion‘ and ‘beautiful bosom‘.\n\nThe marriage of Marie Antoinette and Louis Auguste had remained notoriously unconsummated up to that point, and Maria Theresa was known instead for her ability to ‘please her husband’.\n\nUnlike the Dauphine and the Countess of Provence, Maria Theresa bore children to her husband very early and, in so doing, possible heirs to the Crown. The birth of the Duc d’Angoulême on 6 August 1775 was much celebrated, although it left the Queen and Madame dismayed. Three children followed, but a pregnancy in 1782 seemed suspicious. Relations between the couple had long been non-existent. A bodyguard sent by Louis XVI to serve in the colonies was suspected. Forgiven by her husband but even more discredited, the Countess of Artois gave birth to a daughter, Mademoiselle d’Angoulême, after eight months of pregnancy, but she only lived six months.\n\nMarie Antoinette’s brother, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, during his visit to France in 1777, said of her that she was the only one of the royal family ‘to give birth to children, but in all other respects she is a complete idiot‘.\n\nPersonality and relationship with Marie Antoinette\n\nGifted with little wit and beauty, with a shyness that could only detract from the life of pageantry she led, Maria Theresa remained one of the least loved members of the royal family at Court. Excessively eager not to be talked about, gravitating to the rigid and bigoted circle of the Mesdames, she did not have the necessary qualities to please the superficial and spectacular Court of Versailles. She was considered ‘not distinguished in any sense‘, but good-hearted nonetheless.\n\nThe writer Sarah Tytler (1827-1914) described Maria Theresa as “the more childish and mindless of the sisters; she was the less deceitful, while she could be guilty of the petted behaviour of a spoilt child. After she had been years at the French Court, she still spoke the language of her adopted country in the most deplorable manner. She became the exultant mother of children, while the Dauphiness and the Comtesse de Province, to their keen disappointment, continued childless; but the advantage of being regarded for three or four years as the mother of the probable heir to the throne, did not win the smallest popularity for the unattractive little Comtesse”.\n\nOn the relationship between the sisters-in-law she writes: “Marie Antoinette pined for fit company of her own age, and all the uncongeniality between her and her sisters-in-law did not come out in a day. The Dauphiness welcomed the Comtesse de Provence and the Comtesse d’Artois with her frank friendliness, and for a time, the increase of privileged young people brought a corresponding increase of sociality and animation in what was apt to be, to the princes and princesses the deadly liveliness of the Court of the blasé old King”.\n\nIn the beginning, the couples spent a lot of time together and were very close. In the early years of the new reign, the King and Queen often dined with the Count and Countess of Artois. When Marie-Antoinette fell ill with measles, Maria Theresa was among those who assisted the Queen in restoring her health.\n\nMarie Antoinette Queen of France\n\nAfter becoming queen in 1774, Marie Antoinette ‘indulged in comments about the superiority of her rank and somewhat mortifying comparisons to the other princes and princesses‘. Maria Theresa and her sister thus joined the so-called Mesdames (King Louis XV’s daughters) and amused themselves by gossiping about all the details of Marie-Antoinette’s life and even distorting them.\n\nIn the meantime, Marie Antoinette had given birth to a daughter, also named Marie-Thérèse, in 1778 and a son, Louis Joseph, in 1781. Two more children, Louis Charles and Sophie, were born in 1785 and 1786.\n\nMaria Theresa’s short reign as mother of the heir presumptive to the French throne was over.\n\nThe loneliness of the Countess of Artois\n\nDespite her brilliant marriage, the Countess of Artois never became queen: she emigrated with her husband shortly after the storming of the Bastille and joined the family in Turin. Her husband left her in 1795 and shortly afterwards recalled his sons to serve in the emigrant army in Koblenz.\n\nThe Count of Artois refused to give her permission to stay with him or to visit him, even refusing to allow her to attend the wedding of her son the Duke of Angoulême to Marie-Thérèse of France. Shortly after her husband’s departure, her two sons also left Savoy to serve in the Condé army.\n\nMaria Theresa was described as desolate and deeply saddened after her husband and children left her in Savoy and reportedly contemplated becoming a nun. She was persuaded not to enter the convent by her sister-in-law Marie Clothilde, who appealed to her sense of duty towards her children. In 1792, she was joined in Turin by her sister Marie Josephine. Their presence in Savoy was politically sensitive as it disturbed relations between France and Savoy.\n\nDeath\n\nMaria Theresa stayed in Turin with her father, then with her brother, who became king on his father’s death. Fleeing the Republican troops in December 1798, she took refuge first in Klagenfurt and then, fleeing the war again, in Graz. It was in Graz, at the age of 49, that she died in 1805, destitute and mentally shaken, suffering from episodes of paranoia.\n\nThe Countess of Artois had never seen her husband and eldest son after their exile in Turin and met her second son, the Duke of Berry (who was to marry Princess Marie Caroline of Bourbon-Due Sicilies in 1816) only occasionally.\n\nMaria Theresa is buried in Graz, in the imperial mausoleum next to the city’s cathedral. According to her wishes, her heart was buried in the tomb of her sister-in-law Clothilde in Naples ten years after her death.\n\nFor further reading\n\n“Marie Antoinette: The last Queen of France“, by Evelyne Lever, 2006\n\n“Marie Antoinette“, by Lady Antonia Fraser, 2002\n\n#commissionsearned"
