His paternal grandparents are Prince Andrew of Greece, son of King George I of Greece (born Prince Vilhelm of Denmark, son of King Christian IX of Denmark) and Princess Alice of Battenberg, daughter of Prince Ludwig of Battenberg (later Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven) and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Charles’ maternal grandparents are King George VI of the United Kingdom and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th of Strathmore. Charles is a descendant of two children of Queen Victoria. His father is the great-grandson of Prince Alice of the United Kingdom who married Ludwig IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine. His mother is the great-granddaughter of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom who married Princess Alexandra of Denmark, daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nCharles attended Trinity College, Cambridge University, where he studied anthropology, archaeology, and history. He was the first heir apparent to the British throne to earn a university degree. Prince Charles served in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force and trained as a helicopter pilot and a jet pilot.\n\nCharles married Lady Diana Spencer, daughter of John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer. The couple had two sons Prince William and Prince Harry. Unfortunately, Charles and Diana’s marriage was not the fairy tale marriage it was expected to be. Within five years, the couple’s incompatibility and age difference of almost 13 years, as well as Diana’s concern about Charles’s previous girlfriend, Camilla Parker Bowles, became visible and was damaging to their marriage. Audio tapes showing evidence of Diana’s own extramarital affairs also surfaced. The couple divorced in 1996 and tragically, just a year later, Diana died in a car accident.\n\nFollowing the divorces of both Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles let it be known that his relationship with Camilla was “non-negotiable.” He knew that the relationship was causing much negative publicity and he had Mark Bolland, his Deputy Private Secretary, work on the rehabilitation of Camilla’s image which occurred from 1999 until 2005. In 2005, Charles and Camilla married. After her second marriage, Camilla automatically received the female counterparts of her husband’s titles, including Princess of Wales. However, because the title Princess of Wales is so strongly associated with the previous holder of that title, Diana, Princess of Wales, Camilla adopted the feminine form of her husband’s highest-ranking subsidiary title, Duke of Cornwall, so she is styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall and The Duchess of Rothesay when she is in Scotland.\n\nCharles shares his cousins with his siblings Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Prince Charles, Prince of Wales\n\n********************\n\nPaternal Aunts of Prince Charles, Prince of Wales: Children of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg\n\nPrincess Margarita of Greece, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1905 – 1981), married Gottfried, 8th Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, had four sons and one daughter\n\nPrincess Theodora of Greece, Margravine of Baden (1906 – 1969), married Berthold, Margrave of Baden, had two sons and one daughter\n\nPrincess Cecilie of Greece, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Hesse (1911 – 1937), married Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse, had two sons and one daughter\n\nPrincess Sophie of Greece, Princess of Hesse, Princess of Hanover (1914 – 2001), married (1) Prince Christoph of Hesse, killed on active duty during World War II, had three daughters and two sons (2) Prince Georg Wilhelm of Hanover, had two sons and one daughter\n\n********************\n\nMaternal Aunt of Prince Charles, Prince of Wales: Child of King George VI of the United Kingdom and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon\n\nPrincess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon (1930 – 2002), married and divorced Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, had one son and one daughter\n\n********************\n\nPaternal First Cousins of Prince Charles, Prince of Wales: Children of Princess Margarita of Greece, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Gottfried, 8th Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg\n\nKraft, 9th Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1935 – 2004)\n\nKraft was trained as a forest manager and banker and became titular Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg upon the death of his father in 1960.

She was the third of the six children of her parents who were the Duke and Duchess of York at the time of her birth. Mary’s youngest brother Prince John died in 1919 when he was thirteen-years-old due to epilepsy complications. Her two elder brothers became Kings of the United Kingdom: Edward VIII and George VI. The other two brothers were Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Prince George, Duke of Kent.\n\nPrincess Mary was educated by governesses and also shared some lessons with her brothers. During World War I, when she was a teenager, Mary accompanied her mother Queen Mary on visits to hospitals and other organizations that assisted soldiers and their families. Mary had her own project, Princess Mary’s Christmas Gift Fund, which sent a gift box to British soldiers and sailors for Christmas 1914. In 1918, Princess Mary began a nursing course at the Great Ormond Street Hospital, working two days a week in the Alexandra Ward. Mary also became active in supporting the Voluntary Aid Detachment, the Women’s Land Army and the Girl Guides. She was the honorary president of the British Girl Guide Association from 1920 until her death.\n\nTo learn more about Mary, see Unofficial Royalty: Princess Mary, Princess Royal, Countess of Harewood\n\nHenry’s Early Life\n\nHenry Lascelles was born on September 9, 1882, in London, England. He was the elder son and the eldest of the three children of Henry Lascelles, 5th Earl of Harewood and Lady Florence Bridgeman, daughter of Orlando Bridgeman, 3rd Earl of Bradford. At the time of his birth, Henry was styled The Honourable Henry Lascelles. When his grandfather died in 1892 and his father became the 5th Earl of Harewood, Henry was able to use one of his father’s subsidiary titles and be styled Viscount Lascelles. He became the 6th Earl of Harewood upon the death of his father in 1929.\n\nHenry grew up at Harewood House, the family seat near Leeds in Yorkshire, England. After attending Eton College, Henry attended the Royal Military College Sandhurst and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards on February 12, 1902. He gained the rank of Captain in the service of the Grenadier Guards and fought in World War I where he commanded the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards. He was mentioned in dispatches and wounded twice. He also served with the Yorkshire Hussars Yeomanry and attained the rank of Major.\n\nTo learn more about Henry, see Unofficial Royalty: Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood\n\nThe Engagement\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nEngagement Photo\n\nMary’s eldest brother The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) knew Henry from World War I and greatly admired him. After meeting at the Grand National, an annual horse race, and a house party in 1921, Mary and Henry were continuously seen together, despite their fifteen-year age difference. They both loved horse riding and the two frequently attended hunts together.\n\nWhen Henry was invited to Balmoral and Sandringham, it was noted that there could be an engagement announcement soon. On November 20, 1921, Henry proposed to Mary at York Cottage, where he was staying while at Sandringham. Queen Mary wrote in her diary for that day, “At 6.30 Mary came to my room to announce to me her engagement to Lord Lascelles! We then told G. (King George V) & then gave Harry L. our blessing. We had to keep it quiet owing to G. having to pass an order in council to give his consent. Of course, everybody guessed what had happened & we were very cheerful & almost uproarious at dinner. We are delighted.”\n\nThe Wedding Site\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nWestminster Abbey Choir leading to the Altar\n\nThe wedding of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles was the first time a child of a monarch had married at Westminster Abbey since 1290 when Margaret of England, daughter of King Edward I, married John II, Duke of Brabant. Westminster Abbey was completed around 1060 and was consecrated in 1065, during the reign of Edward the Confessor. Construction of the second and present church was begun in 1245 by Henry III who selected the site for his burial. In 1269, Henry III oversaw a grand ceremony to rebury Edward the Confessor in a magnificent new shrine, personally helping to carry the body to its new resting place.\n\nWestminster Abbey was the wedding venue for six royal weddings during the reigns of the Plantagenet kings including that of King Richard II to Anne of Bohemia in 1382. That would be the last royal wedding at Westminster Abbey until the reign of King George V. Queen Victoria’s granddaughter and King George V’s first cousin Princess Patricia of Connaught married The Honorable Alexander Ramsay at Westminster Abbey in 1919. This was the first major royal event after World War I.\n\nMary was the first of King George V’s children to marry. Five of the six children (Prince John died in childhood) of King George V married and three of the five were married at Westminster Abbey. Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester was due to marry at Buckingham Palace but the unexpected death of his fiancée’s father caused the wedding to be moved to the Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace. The large size of Westminster Abbey allowed more guests to be present at the wedding ceremony and the long drive from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey brought out immense crowds along the route. With each royal wedding, the anticipation and excitement grew.\n\nBridesmaids and Best Man\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nSeated, left to right: Lady Mary Cambridge, Princess Maud of Fife, Lady Rachel Cavendish, Lady Mary Thynne. Standing, left to right: Lady Doris Gordon-Lennox, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyons, Viscount Lascelles, Princess Mary, Major Sir Victor Mackenzie, Lady Diana Bridgeman, Lady May Cambridge.\n\nMajor Sir Victor Mackenzie, 3rd Baronet was the best man. Like the groom, Sir Victor was wounded twice in World War I and mentioned in dispatches. In 1932, he was made Groom in Waiting to King George V, serving in the role until 1936. In 1936, he was made an Extra Groom in Waiting to King Edward VIII and retained that position in the household of King George VI from 1937 until his death in 1944. He never married.\n\nBridesmaids:\n\nPrincess Maud of Fife, first cousin of the bride, daughter of Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife and Princess Louise, Princess Royal, married Charles Carnegie, 11th Earl of Southesk\n\nLady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, future sister-in-law of the bride, daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore, married the future King George VI\n\nLady Diana Bridgeman, first cousin once removed of the groom, daughter of Orlando Bridgeman, 5th Earl of Bradford, married Sir Robert Henry Edward Abdy, 5th Baronet\n\nLady May Cambridge, maternal first cousin and paternal second cousin of the bride, daughter of Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone (brother of Queen Mary) and Princess Alice of Albany (granddaughter of Queen Victoria), married Sir Henry Abel Smith\n\nLady Mary Cambridge, maternal first cousin of the bride, daughter of Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge (brother of Queen Mary), married Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort\n\nLady Rachel Cavendish, daughter of Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, married James Stuart, 1st Viscount Stuart of Findhorn\n\nLady Doris Gordon-Lennox, daughter of Charles Gordon-Lennox, 8th Duke of Richmond, married Commander Clare George Vyner\n\nLady Mary Thynne, daughter of Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath, married (1) Charles Wilson, 3rd Baron Nunburnholme (2) Sir Ulick Alexander\n\nWedding Attire\n\nThe groom and best man both wore the uniform of the Grenadier Guards. Across his scarlet tunic, the groom wore the blue sash of the Order of the Garter, bestowed upon him by King George V the day before the wedding.\n\nThe eight bridesmaids wore dresses of frosted cloth of silver over ivory satin. At their waists was a big true lover’s knot in blue, Princess Mary’s favorite color, and they carried bouquets of sweet peas, the bride’s favorite flower. Each bridesmaid wore a brooch given by Viscount Lascelles – a crystal jewel studded with sapphires and diamonds with two coronets and the initials M and H.\n\nPrincess Mary’s wedding dress was designed by Messrs. Reville, Ltd. of Hanover Square, London. The dress was made of cloth of silver with an ivory silk train embroidered with emblematic flowers of the British Empire. The cloth of silver was brought by Queen Mary from India during her visit in 1911. The silk train was woven by hand by workers in Braintree, Essex, England, an old English silk manufacturing center where the art of silk weaving was passed down from generation to generation.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nPrincess Mary’s floral bridal wreath\n\nInstead of wearing a tiara, Princess Mary wore a floral bridal wreath. To complement her wedding dress, Mary wore a short single strand of pearls and a diamond and pearl brooch suspended from a very fine chain, a gift from the groom. On her bodice, she wore the brooch given to her by the Royal Scots regiment, the oldest regiment in the British Army when she was appointed their Colonel-in-Chief.\n\nThe Wedding\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAn interior view of Westminster Abbey during the wedding ceremony\n\nOver 2,000 wedding guests began arriving at Westminster Abbey at 9:00 AM and by 10:00 AM, most of them were in their seats. At 11:15 AM, the members of the British Royal Family were ready for their procession. They were led by Queen Alexandra, the grandmother of the bride. Closely following was Queen Mary, the mother of the bride, in a white dress covered with gold embroidery, wearing the blue sash of the Order of the Garter, and bedecked with diamond jewelry. Soon, cheers from the street, coming through the open Abbey door, heralded the arrival of King George V and his only daughter Princess Mary. The wedding coach was not the familiar Gold State Coach that had been used at State Openings of Parliament but the coach known as The Glass Coach.\n\nAt the west door, the bride was joined by the eight bridesmaids, who had been awaiting her in Little Poet’s Corner, where poets who are not honored in the better known Poet’s Corner in the South Transept are remembered. King George V was in the uniform of colonel-in-chief of the Grenadier Guards, in honor of the groom who served in the Grenadier Guards during World War I. As the bridal procession moved past the grave of the Unknown Warrior, whose remains were brought from France and buried there in 1920, their thoughts must have flashed back to those lost in World War I. A year later, when one of Mary’s bridesmaids, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, married the future King George VI, she laid her bouquet of white roses on the grave of the Unknown Warrior. No doubt she was thinking of her brother Fergus Bowes-Lyon and all the other British soldiers who had died in World War I. It has become a tradition that royal brides have their bouquets placed on the grave of the Unknown Warrior.\n\nThe wedding ceremony, the typical Church of England service, was conducted by Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of York, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, Bishop of London, and Herbert Ryle, Dean of Westminster.\n\nWestminster Abbey: Order of Service of the Marriage of Her Royal Highness Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles, D.S.O.\n\nThe signing of the register took place in Edward the Confessor’s Chapel, among the tombs of five kings and six queens. The register was signed by the bride and groom and attested by King George V and Queen Mary; Henry Lascelles, 5th Earl of Harewood and Florence Lascelles, Countess of Harewood; Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury; Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of York; and Herbert Ryle, Dean of Westminster.\n\nMusic\n\nBefore the wedding, as the guests arrived, the following music was played on the organ by Sidney Nicholson, organist of Westminster Abbey:\n\n“Solemn Melody” by Walford Davies\n\n“Trumpet Voluntary” by Henry Purcell\n\n“Marche Nuptiale” by Alexandre Guilmant\n\nFour Movement from “Water Music” by Georg Friedrich Handel\n\n“Benediction Nupitale” by Camille Saint-Saens\n\n“Bridal March” by Hubert Parry\n\n“Imperial March” by Edward Elgar\n\nDuring the wedding, the following was performed by Sidney Nicholson, organist of Westminster Abbey and the Choir of Westminster Abbey:\n\nProcession of the Bride: The hymn “Lead Us, Heavenly Father” was sung\n\nAfter the solemnization of matrimony, as the couple moved to the altar: Psalm 67 “God be merciful unto us” with music by Thomas Tertius Noble was sung\n\nAfter the address by the Archbishop of Canterbury: The hymn “Praise My Soul The King of Heaven” by Sir John Goss was sung\n\nBefore the signing of the register: The National Anthem, “God Save The King” was sung\n\nDuring the signing of the register: The anthem “Beloved, Let Us Love One Another” written especially for the occasion by Sidney Nicholson was sung\n\nProcession of the Bride and Groom, Clergy, King and Queen, Royal Family: Bridal March from “Romeo and Juliet” by Charles Gounod and “Wedding March” by Felix Mendelssohn were played on the organ\n\nAfter the Wedding\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBuckingham Palace Balcony Appearance: Left to Right – King George V, Princess Mary, Viscount Lascelles, Queen Alexandra, and Queen Mary\n\nThe newlyweds proceeded back to Buckingham Palace, with huge crowds cheering them along the way. The wedding breakfast at Buckingham Palace was a small affair, only a hundred people were present, members of the bride and groom’s families and some of the bridesmaids.\n\nEach table sat ten people and was decorated with white lilacs and pink tulips. At the main table, King George V sat with Princess Mary on his right. Continuing around the circular table on the right sat the groom’s mother the Countess of Harewood, Mary’s brother Prince Henry, the Dowager Countess of Bradford (the groom’s maternal grandmother), Mary’s brother The Duke of York (the future King George VI), Queen Alexandra, the groom’s father the Earl of Harewood, Queen Mary and the groom Viscount Lascelles.\n\nAs the newlyweds were ready to leave the palace, everyone went to the Grand Hall where the newlyweds were pelted with rose-leaf confetti. A huge crowd had waited patiently outside Buckingham Palace to see the couple as they left for the honeymoon. At 3:45 PM, an open landau drawn by four gray horses carrying the bride and groom appeared in the quadrangle. King George V and his four sons and walked to where the guests had gathered in the forecourt. They all took up positions on either side of the arch through which the landau was to pass. They were joined by some of the bridesmaids and two little pages. They were all given confetti shaped like horseshoes and silver slippers. As the landau passed the crowd, the bride and groom were pelted with the confetti so hard by the King and the Princes that the couple had to duck down. Everyone laughed, especially the King.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nKing George V, The Duke of York, Prince Henry and Prince George, throwing confetti in the shape of small horseshoes and silver slippers as Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles leave Buckingham Palace\n\nAs the couple made their way to Paddington Station, they were greeted by throngs of people cheering loudly. At Paddington Station, the couple boarded a train to their honeymoon destination, Weston Park in Weston-under-Lizard, Staffordshire, England, the country home of the Earls of Bradford, the family of Viscount Lascelles’ mother. After some days of seclusion, the newlyweds traveled to Italy and then spent time with Bernard Forbes, 8th Earl of Granard and Beatrice Forbes, Countess of Granard at their Paris home.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nEn.wikipedia.org.

This ceremony formally marks the beginning of a session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth II will read a prepared speech, known as the “Speech from the Throne” or the “Queen’s Speech”, outlining the Government’s agenda for the coming year.\n\nIn the United States, the State Opening of Parliament can be seen live on C-SPAN at 6:15 AM Eastern Time. Since this is early for those of us on the East Coast and even earlier for those in the other US time zones, DVRing might be a good idea. For more information see C-SPAN: Queen Elizabeth II Delivers Speech at the State Opening of British Parliament.\n\nFor those in the United Kingdom, the BBC will be covering the State Opening of Parliament. For more information, see BBC One: The State Opening of Parliament. There is a note at the site, “This programme will be available shortly after broadcast.” It is possible that the BBC coverage will be available to watch after the event for those in other countries. However, sometimes television programs are only available for viewing only to people using IPs from the country of origin.\n\nFor more information, see our link below.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: State Opening of Parliament\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nFirst Cousins: King Edward VIII and King George VI of the United Kingdom\n\nby Susan Flantzer\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nKing Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, later The Duke of Windsor (1894 – 1972)\n\nKing George VI of the United Kingdom (1894 – 1952)\n\n(All photos credits – Wikipedia unless otherwise noted)\n\nKing Edward VIII, the Duke of Windsor after his abdication, was born on June 23, 1894, at White Lodge, Richmond Park on the outskirts of London, England. At the time of his birth, his great-grandmother Queen Victoria sat upon the throne of the United Kingdom. His parents, the future King George V and Queen Mary were the Duke and Duchess of York and his grandparents, the future King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra were Prince and Princess of Wales. The infant prince was the eldest son of his parents and was third in the line of succession behind his grandfather and father. Christened Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David, he was known as David. After his abdication in 1936, he married Wallis Simpson and had no children.\n\nEighteen months after David’s birth, another son was born into the family on December 14, 1895, at York Cottage, his parents’ home on the grounds of the Sandringham estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, England. Christened Albert Frederick Arthur George, he was known as Bertie and would succeed his elder brother upon his abdication as King George VI. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon and had two daughters.\n\nThe brothers’ paternal grandparents were King Edward VII, eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Alexandra of Denmark, eldest daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. Their mother had been born Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, known as May, the eldest of the four children and the only daughter of Prince Francis, Duke of Teck and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, a first cousin of Queen Victoria.\n\nThe Duke of Windsor and King George VI had ten first cousins. They share their first cousins with their siblings Mary, Princess Royal, Countess of Harewood; Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; Prince George, Duke of Kent; and Prince John.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, Duke of Windsor\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King George VI of the United Kingdom\n\n********************\n\nPaternal Aunts and Uncles: Children of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and Alexandra of Denmark\n\nPrince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864 – 1892), unmarried\n\nPrincess Louise, Princess Royal, Duchess of Fife (1867 – 1931), married Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife; had two daughters\n\nPrincess Victoria (1868 – 1935), unmarried\n\nPrincess Maud, Queen of Norway (1869 – 1938), married King Haakon VII of Norway; had one son\n\nPrince Alexander John (born and died 1871)\n\nMaternal Aunts and Uncles: Children of Prince Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge\n\nPrince Adolphus of Teck, later Duke of Teck and Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge (1868 – 1927), married Lady Margaret Evelyn Grosvenor, had two sons and two daughters\n\nPrince Francis of Teck (1870 – 1910), unmarried\n\nPrince Alexander of Teck, later Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone (1874 – 1957), married Princess Alice of Albany, granddaughter of Queen Victoria, had one daughter and two sons\n\n********************\n\nPATERNAL FIRST COUSINS\n\nPaternal First Cousins: Children of Louise, Princess Royal and Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife\n\nPrincess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife, Princess Arthur of Connaught (1891 – 1959)\n\nPrincess Alexandra was the eldest surviving child of Princess Louise, Princess Royal and Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife. As a female-line great-granddaughter of the British sovereign, (Queen Victoria) at birth, Alexandra was not entitled to the title of Princess or the style Royal Highness. Instead, she was styled Lady Alexandra Duff, the style of daughters of a Duke. The Letters Patent for her father’s title allowed the dukedom to pass to the daughters of the 1st Duke of Fife if he had no son, and then to the male heirs of his daughters. Therefore, Alexandra became heir to her father’s dukedom and did succeed her father as 2nd Duchess of Fife in her own right.\n\nWhen Alexandra’s mother was created Princess Royal in 1905, Alexandra and her sister Maud were granted the title of Princess with the style of “Highness” and received precedence immediately after all members of the royal family bearing the style of “Royal Highness.” Alexandra married her first cousin once removed, Prince Arthur of Connaught, the only son of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught who was a son of Queen Victoria.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife\n\n********************\n\nPrincess Maud of Fife, Countess of Southesk (1893 – 1945)\n\nPrincess Maud of Fife was the younger of the two daughters of Princess Louise, Princess Royal and Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife. Maud married Charles Carnegie, the eldest son of Charles Noel Carnegie, 10th Earl of Southesk. The couple had one child, James Carnegie. After her marriage, Maud stopped using ‘Her Highness Princess Maud’ and was known as Lady Carnegie, and later The Countess of Southesk after her husband succeeded his father as the 11th Earl of Southesk. Maud’s son James Carnegie succeeded his maternal aunt Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife, as the 3rd Duke of Fife, because her only child, Alastair, 2nd Duke of Connaught, had predeceased her. James also succeeded his father upon his death in 1992 as the 12th Earl of Southesk and as Chief of the Clan Carnegie.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Princess Maud, Countess of Southesk\n\n********************\n\nPaternal First Cousins: Children of Princess Maud of Wales, Queen of Norway and King Haakon VII of Norway\n\nKing Olav V of Norway (1903 – 1991)\n\nKing Olav V of Norway was born Prince Alexander of Denmark on July 2, 1903, at Appleton House on the Sandringham Estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, England. He was the only child of Prince Carl of Denmark, son of King Frederik VIII of Denmark, and Princess Maud of Wales, daughter of the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. At the time of his birth, there was little expectation that he would one day become a king himself. However, this would all change in 1905, when his father was named as the new King of Norway, taking the name Haakon VII. Young Alexander was given the more Norwegian-sounding name Olav and at the age of just two years old, became Crown Prince of Norway.\n\nOlav represented Norway in the 1928 Olympic Games, winning a Gold Medal in the sailing competition and remained active in sailing his whole life. He married Princess Märtha of Sweden and had one son, King Harald V of Norway, and two daughters. Sadly, Märtha died of cancer before Olav succeeded his father in 1957.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Olav V of Norway\n\n********************\n\nMATERNAL FIRST COUSINS\n\nMaternal First Cousins: Children of Prince Adolphus of Teck, later Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge and Lady Margaret Evelyn Grosvenor\n\nPrince George of Teck, later 2nd Marquess of Cambridge (1895 – 1981)\n\nStyled His Serene Highness Prince George of Teck at birth, George’s name and title changed in 1917, when King George V requested that his relatives who were British subjects relinquish their German titles, styles, and designations, due to anti-German sentiment during World War I. George’s father became Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge and George became George Cambridge, Earl of Eltham, one of his father’s subsidiary titles. George married Dorothy Hastings and they had one daughter. Upon his father’s death, George succeeded to the title Marquess of Cambridge. However, the title became extinct upon George’s death because he had no sons and his only brother had died in World War II.\n\nWikipedia: George Cambridge, 2nd Marquess of Cambridge\n\n********************\n\nPrincess Mary of Teck, later Lady Mary Cambridge, Duchess of Beaufort (1897 – 1987)\n\nLike her brother George, Princess Mary of Teck’s title changed in 1917 to Lady Mary Cambridge. She was a bridesmaid at the wedding of her first cousin Prince Albert, Duke of York and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Mary married Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort but the couple had no children.\n\nWikipedia: Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort\n\n********************\n\nPrincess Helena of Teck, later Lady Helena Cambridge, Lady Helen Gibbs (1899 – 1969)\n\nIn 1917, as per King George V’s request, Princess Helena of Teck relinquished her German title and was then styled Lady Helena Cambridge. Lady Helena married Colonel John Gibbs, a veteran of the Boer Wars and World War I but their marriage was childless.\n\nWikipedia: Lady Helen Gibbs\n\n********************\n\nPrince Frederick of Teck, later Lord Frederick Cambridge (1907 – 1940)\n\nBorn Prince Frederick of Teck, like the rest of his family, he relinquished his title in 1917 and was then styled Lord Frederick Teck. During World War II, Frederick served as a Captain in the Coldstream Guards. He was killed in action in Leuven, Belgium and was buried in Heverlee War Cemetery in Belgium\n\nWikipedia: Lord Frederick Cambridge\n\n********************\n\nMaternal First Cousins: Children of Prince Alexander of Teck, later Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice of Albany\n\nPrincess May of Teck, later Lady May Cambridge, Lady May Abel Smith (1906- 1994)\n\nPrincess May of Teck was the eldest of the three children of Prince Alexander of Teck and Princess Alice of Albany, the daughter of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the hemophiliac son of Queen Victoria. At the request of King George V, the family relinquished their German titles. May’s father became Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone and May was styled Lady May Cambridge. When Lady May married Henry Abel Smith in 1931, the future Queen Elizabeth II was one of her child bridesmaids. Lady May and her husband had two daughters and one son.\n\nWikipedia: Lady May Abel Smith\n\n********************\n\nPrince Rupert of Teck, later Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon (1907 – 1928)\n\nIn 1917, Prince Rupert of Teck, along with the rest of his family, gave up his title and was then styled Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon, one of his father’s subsidiary titles. Rupert inherited hemophilia from his mother Princess Alice of Albany. Princess Alice’s father, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany was Queen Victoria’s youngest son and had hemophilia. The daughter of a hemophiliac will always be a carrier because her father can only pass on to her an X chromosome with hemophilia on it.\n\nOn April 1, 1928, Rupert was driving with two of his friends when the car skidded and crashed into a tree. One of his friends died due to injuries and the other was only slightly injured. At first, Rupert also did not seem to be seriously injured. However, after being in the hospital for several days, he began to hemorrhage from the ear due to a slight fracture of the skull. The bleeding was arrested and Rupert seemed to be improving, but it did not last. On April 15, 1928, 20-year-old Rupert died from an injury he probably would have recovered from had he not been a hemophiliac.\n\nWikipedia: Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Hemophilia in Queen Victoria’s Family\n\n********************\n\nPrince Maurice of Teck (born and died 1910)\n\nPrince Maurice of Teck was born March 29, 1910. On September 14, 1910, five-month-old Maurice died at Reinhardsbrunn Castle in Germany while his family was visiting Princess Alice’s brother, Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Maurice was interred on a burial island on the grounds of Reinhardsbrunn Castle.\n\n********************\n\nWorks Cited\n\nLundy, D. (2019). Main Page. [online] Thepeerage.com.

He was the second son and the second of the six children of King Edward VII and his wife Alexandra of Denmark, who were the Prince and Princess of Wales at that time. Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha were George’s paternal grandparents. His maternal grandparents were King Christian IX of Denmark and Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel. George’s elder brother Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, known as Eddy, was expected to become king. However, Eddy died of pneumonia at the age of 28 and George became second in the line of succession after his father. George married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, his deceased brother’s fiancee, and had five sons and one daughter.\n\nThe children and grandchildren of George’s paternal grandmother Queen Victoria married into other European royal families giving Victoria the unofficial title of “Grandmother of Europe.” Her grandchildren sat upon the thrones of Germany/Prussia, Greece, Norway, Romania, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom as monarchs or consorts. Similarly, George’s paternal grandfather King Christian IX of Denmark can be called the “Grandfather of Europe. His grandsons were the monarchs of Denmark, Greece, Norway, Russia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nKing George V had 34 paternal first cousins and 33 maternal first cousins for a total of 67 first cousins. He shares his first cousins with his siblings Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence; Princess Louise, Princess Royal, Duchess of Fife; Princess Victoria; Princess Maud, Queen of Norway; and Prince Alexander John.\n\nBecause King George V has so many cousins and because Unofficial Royalty has articles on all of Queen Victoria’s children, grandchildren, and their spouses and on all of King Christian IX’s children and many of his grandchildren and Wikipedia has articles on the others, this article will be a list on the cousins, with some information and an Unofficial Royalty link or a Wikipedia link where more information can be found.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King George V of the United Kingdom\n\n********************\n\nPaternal Aunts and Uncles of King George V: Children of Queen
