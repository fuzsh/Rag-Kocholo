        "text": "Well, I've just read something about this person and he seemed to me an ambitious though capable general-king. I think this turn of events wouldn't avoid Spanish War of Succession(Habsburgs won't be happy about that decision), but we could see an interesting situation.(What will Phillip d'Anjou do? Which claimant will France support? and Great Britain?)\n\nBTW, I think it's a very good PoD for a really interesting TL. If you do it, I'll be quickly subscribed\n\nThis is an interesting one because VA did have a claim but really a weaker claim than Philip or Charles. However, Carlos II was annoyed about the Powers\n\nnegotiating to partition the inheritance without even consulting him. So, perhaps he anoints VA as a double snub to France and Austria.\n\nThis suits the maritime powers interest just fine as they have an independent dynasty in control and do not have to get involved in the (possible) emerging conflict between France and Austria.\n\nHowever, one unintended consequence could be a Franco-Austrian detente or alliance as they agree to peel off segments of the Spanish possessions for themselves. Neither can conquer Spain by themselves but they can certainly cooperate to effect a partition.\n\nNaples and Sicily to Philip.\n\nMilan and the Spanish Netherlands to Charles.\n\nI alluded to Habsburg/Bourbon marriages in the wake of this agreement in a post that went over like a lead balloon. Any ideas?\n\nI tend to agree, that France and Austria are likely to cooperate, when both of them are passed over in favour of Victor Amadeus of Savoy.\n\nAny arrangement could for instance also include Lorraine-Bar and Savoy-Piedmont. Victor Amadeus might be allowed to succeed in Spain, but in return has to give up his ancestral lands.\n\nI guess not, I think Austria probably wants Milan & Piedmont. Savoy proper and Lorraine could go to France; and the Southern Netherlands might be used to compensate the house of Lorraine.\n\nNow there's an idea....\n\nWas the House of Carignan, that is, the junior Savoy line also descended from the Spanish Hapsburgs? If so, that presents another interesting possibility, and potentially with less horse trading."
