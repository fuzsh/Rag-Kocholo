        "text": "Charles Emmanuel III (born April 27, 1701, Turin, Savoy—died Feb. 20, 1773, Turin, Kingdom of Sardinia) was the king of Sardinia–Piedmont and an extremely skilled soldier whose aid other European countries often solicited for the many wars of his time.\n\nHaving received a military and political education, Charles Emmanuel succeeded his father, Victor Amadeus II, in 1730. During the War of the Polish Succession (1733–38) he joined the side of France and Spain, occupied Milan, and scored a brilliant success at Guastalla (Sept. 19, 1734). By the ensuing Treaty of Vienna he obtained Novara and Tortona (1738).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nDuring the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48), which engaged the whole European continent, Charles Emmanuel fought against the Spanish, seeing that they, as did he, had designs on Milan. An astute negotiator, he was able to obtain Vigevano in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)."
