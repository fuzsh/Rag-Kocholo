        "text": "In September 1775, the sister of Louis XVI of France, Marie Clotilde Adélaïde Xavière, was given in marriage to the heir to the throne of the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, Carlo Emanuele of Savoy. This political marriage aimed to strengthen the solid relations that already existed between the two royal houses, but it also bound two strangers to a common destiny. Marie Clotilde had grown up in the pleasure-seeking court of Versailles although she was educated according to the most rigid religious dictates. She was a short and stout young woman, with a docile nature and was more predisposed to the monastic life than that of the court. Carlo Emanuele was disinclined to leadership and certainly unable to compete with the fame of his august predecessors. He appeared to be in poor health and was psychologically fragile. Except for their shared religious devotion, the new royal couple certainly could not be described as well matched. However, a bond of deep trust and attachment arose between them."
