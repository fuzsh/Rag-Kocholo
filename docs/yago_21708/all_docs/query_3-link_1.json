        "text": "Anne Christine of Sulzbach (Anne Christine Louise; 5 February 1704 – 12 March 1723), also called Anne of the Palatinate, was the first wife of Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont. She died as a result of giving birth.\n\nAnne Christine was born a daughter of Theodore Eustace, Count Palatine of Sulzbach and Eleonore of Hesse-Rheinfels, daughter of William, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg.\n\nOn 15 March, 1722 at Vercelli, she married Charles Emmanuel of Savoy, Prince of Piedmont and later King of Sardinia as Charles Emmanuel III. He was the second son of Victor Amadeus II and Anne Marie d'Orléans and the heir apparent to the Savoyard throne. The following year, she gave birth to a son who was created the Duke of Aosta. She died a few days later on 12 March 1723 at the age of nineteen in Turin. Her only child died in 1725 in his second year, thus she has no descendants. She was buried at Turin Cathedral and was moved to the Basilica of Superga in Turin in 1786.\n\nVittorio Amedeo Theodore of Savoy (7 March 1723 – 11 August 1725), given the title of Duke of Aosta but died in infancy; buried at Superga."
