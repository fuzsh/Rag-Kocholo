        "meta_description": "Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy (Turin 1701 - Ivi 1773)\nConcessions for peddlers in the Kingdom of Sardinia\nSigned manuscript document\nOne page in-4\nSignature/date: From the field below Pizzighettone on November 27, 1733\nConservation status: good\nLot component number: 1\n\nSigned manuscript document of the King of Sardinia Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy, known as the 'Laborious' and nicknamed 'Carlin' by the Piedmontese, who came to the throne in conflict with his father and surrounded himself with military men on whom he conferred the highest offices of state. Under his reign, which lasted for almost 43 years, the Savoy state continued to soldier alongside the great powers in the wars of Polish and Austrian succession, gaining considerable territorial acquisitions, which moved its border to the Ticino. Charles Emmanuel was the second of three males and therefore at birth was not the heir to the throne; his older brother Victor Amadeus, who was the crown prince, died in 1715, and from that date Charles Emmanuel became prince of Piedmont. Charles Emmanuel lived in a Turin profoundly changed by recent political events. Piedmont, after ups and downs, had emerged victorious from the War of the Spanish Succession, defeating Louis XIV's French army, and his father, Victor Amadeus II, had acquired the title of king of Sicily, which he was forced to exchange for that of Sardinia. The king increasingly repudiated the pomp of the court, worldliness and luxury: he dressed in simple cloth and his shirts were of coarse canvas. Turin had therefore been radically transformed: by royal will, parties were banned, and the display of wealth was a crime. Victor Amadeus II, after his political and military triumphs, had become increasingly withdrawn into himself, becoming shy and reclusive. After 1728, the king's oddities began to degenerate more and more, probably due to mental illness. His wife Anne, mother of Charles Emmanuel, had died, and his eldest son, much loved by Victor Amadeus, had also passed away: the old king decided to abdicate and leave the throne to his son Charles Emmanuel III. Charles Emmanuel was unloved by his father: frail and almost hunchbacked, he had grown haggard in his years at the austere court in Turin and seemed to speak little, only the bare essentials. His education had been sketchy, as all attention had gone to his older brother. In 1722 Victor Amadeus II had his son married to the Palatine Princess Anna Christina Louise of the Palatinate-Sulzbach, who died after only a year giving Charles Emmanuel an heir, who died in infancy. His second wife, also chosen by his father, was Polyxena of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, who gave her husband most of the children. She was much loved by Charles Emmanuel and was frowned upon by Victor Amadeus, who, believing that she diverted his son's attentions from politics, went so far as to require the couple to sleep in two separate apartments. Granted that the story of his abdication still has unclear sides, what is known is that in the summer of 1730 Victor Amadeus decided to leave sovereignty over Piedmont to his son, and on September 3 he made the announcement to all his ministers. After a short time in Chambéry, Victor Amadeus resumed giving orders and advice to his son, who nevertheless restored balls, parties, and luxuries at the court in Turin. In the summer of 1731, while Charles Emmanuel III was in Chambéry, he covered him with insults before the Council of Ministers, accusing him of ineptitude. Victor Amadeus decided, therefore, to regain the throne. He returned to Piedmont and confirmed the ministers. Charles Emmanuel, informed of his father's moves, convened an extraordinary session of the Council of Ministers, which decreed that Victor Amadeus II should be arrested and imprisoned. An escort of soldiers was therefore dispatched to arrest the old king, who was locked up in Moncalieri Castle, where he remained until his death. At the end of the long wartime events that saw the kingdom of Sardinia involved during the reign of Charles Emmanuel III, the sovereign arranged for the display of the 'Shroud' in 1750 as a thanksgiving for the conquests achieved and the favorable fortunes of the Piedmontese. Charles Emmanuel devoted much care to the fortification of Alpine passes and frontiers. He introduced meritocracy in the military hierarchies, favoring even those of non-noble birth. He financed historiography in the kingdom, protecting historians such as Ludovico Antonio Muratori. He used Jean-Jacques Rousseau to produce the first Piedmontese cadastre, \"Sardinian Maps,\" which was published in 1770.
