        "text": "The Claimants to the Kingdoms of Jerusalem, Armenia and Cyprus\n\nJerusalem was the centre of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1099 until the Mameluke conquered it in 1291. The title of King of Jerusalem was mainly used and claimed by the Hapsburg of Austria, the Savoy of Italy and by the Kings of Spain until the beginning of the 20th century, and by the Kings of Naples and the Two Sicilies until 1861, as well as by the Russian Tsar. There were other claims, as the Tsars of Russia also claimed some rights to Jerusalem, though this was generally acknowledged as perhaps not the closest or most direct claim. There were also some less clear claimants from the apparently ended and very mysterious line of Conrad of Montferrat and the Cornaro Claim of the Ancient Venice-Cyprus line, and more obscure Byzantine claims.\n\nPRINCIPAL LINES OF SUCCESSION TO THE KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM, ARMENIA AND CYPRUS\n\nThe first Kings of Jerusalem 1099-1284\n\nThe titular Kings of Jerusalem:\n\nThe Lusignan dynasty and the Serene Republic of Venice until 1797\n\nThe Savoy line, later Kings of Sardinia then of Italy until 1946\n\nThe Anjou line, later Dukes of Lorraine, Holy Roman Emperors and Emperors of Austria until 1918\n\nThe Bourbon Sicilies line, Kings of Two Sicilies until 1860\n\nThe Kings of Spain\n\nFULL AND COMPLETE LIST OF THE KINGS OF JERUSALEM, ARMENIA AND CYPRUS\n\nBy default, all people mentioned in this list are or were considered Kings of Jerusalem.
