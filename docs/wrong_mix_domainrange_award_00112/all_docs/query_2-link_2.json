        "text": "Karl Manne Georg Siegbahn (born Dec. 3, 1886, Örebro, Swed.—died Sept. 26, 1978, Stockholm) was a Swedish physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1924 for his discoveries and investigations in X-ray spectroscopy.\n\nSiegbahn was educated at the University of Lund and obtained his doctorate there in 1911. At Lund he became a research assistant to Johannes Rydberg and succeeded Rydberg as professor of physics in 1920. In 1916 Siegbahn discovered a new group of wavelengths, the M series, in X-ray emission spectra. He developed equipment and techniques that allowed him and subsequent researchers to determine accurately the wavelengths of X rays. A year after he became professor of physics at Uppsala University, he and his colleagues furnished proof (1924) that X rays are refracted (bent) when they pass through prisms, just as light rays are, though the effect is weaker and obscured by absorption of the X rays. Later, Siegbahn also investigated the weaker X rays that lie near the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhysics and Natural Law"
