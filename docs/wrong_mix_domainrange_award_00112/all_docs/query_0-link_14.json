        "text": "Biography\n\nSiegbahn was born in Ãrebro, Sweden, the son of Georg Siegbahn and his wife, Emma Zetterberg.[5]\n\nHe graduated in Stockholm 1906 and began his studies at Lund University in the same year.[6] During his education he was secretarial assistant to Johannes Rydberg.[7] In 1908 he studied at the University of GÃ¶ttingen.[8] He obtained his doctorate (PhD) at the Lund University in 1911, his thesis was titled Magnetische Feldmessungen (magnetic field measurements). He became acting professor for Rydberg when his (Rydberg's) health was failing, and succeeded him as full professor in 1920.[9] However, in 1922 he left Lund for a professorship at Uppsala University.[10]\n\nIn 1937, Siegbahn was appointed Director of the Physics Department of the Nobel Institute of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1988 this was renamed the Manne Siegbahn Institute (MSI).[11] The institute research groups have been reorganized since, but the name lives on in the Manne Siegbahn Laboratory hosted by Stockholm University.\n\nX-ray spectroscopy\n\nManne Siegbahn began his studies of X-ray spectroscopy in 1914. Initially he used the same type of spectrometer as Henry Moseley had done for finding the relationship between the wavelength of some elements and their place at the periodic system. Shortly thereafter he developed improved experimental apparatus which allowed him to make very accurate measurements of the X-ray wavelengths produced by atoms of different elements. Also, he found that several of the spectral lines that Moseley had discovered consisted of more components. By studying these components and improving the spectrometer, Siegbahn got an almost complete understanding of the electron shell.[12] He developed a convention for naming the different spectral lines that are characteristic to elements in X-ray spectroscopy, the Siegbahn notation. Siegbahn's precision measurements drove many developments in quantum theory and atomic physics.[13]"
