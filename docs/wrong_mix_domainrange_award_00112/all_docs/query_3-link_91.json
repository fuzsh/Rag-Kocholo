        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are prizes awarded annually to people (and, in the case of the Peace Prize, to organizations) who have completed outstanding research, invented ground-breaking techniques or equipment, or made an outstanding contribution to society in physics, chemistry, literature, peace, medicine or physiology and economics.\n\nThe Prizes were instituted by the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel through his will. They were first awarded in 1901, five years after Nobel's death. The prize in economics, instituted by the Bank of Sweden, has been awarded since 1969.\n\nPrizes cannot be revoked. Since 1974, no award may be made posthumously.\n\nThe Prizes are then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.\n\nA prize may not be shared among more than three people.\n\nThe Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905–1946); the Aula of the University of Oslo (1947–1990); and most recently at the Oslo City Hall. As of 2005, the other Prize ceremonies have been held at the Stockholm Concert Hall.\n\nSince 1902, the King of Sweden has, with the exception of the Peace Prize, presented all the prizes in Stockholm\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount is currently set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 11 million per full Nobel Prize\n\nIn the history of the Nobel Prize, there have been only four people to have received two Nobel Prizes.
