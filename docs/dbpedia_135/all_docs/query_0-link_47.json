        "text": "1 Introduction\n\nIn recent decades, scientific and technological developments have increased our ability to both collect and manage large amounts of data. In biomedicine this has contributed to the rise of various “-omics”-fields (e.g. genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), where the focus is not on single variables such as individual genes, proteins or metabolites, but rather on the whole genome, proteome, or metabolome. Because “-omics”-datasets may contain hundreds to thousands of variables, considering each variable individually may be inefficient. In addition, “-omics”-data are multivariate by nature, and performing separate analyses for each variable does not take the interrelatedness between the variables into consideration.\n\nA subset of the methods developed to analyze such data are based on the idea of combining two different kinds of statistical methods: 1) analysis of variance (ANOVA), and 2) dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) (1). Combining these methods in various ways allows the researcher to separate and visualize effects from different sources of variation in the data, while also accounting for the correlations between the outcome variables. One such method is ANOVA simultaneous component analysis (ASCA), where the response matrix is first decomposed into effect matrices according to the experimental design, and the impact of each experimental factor is visualized by applying PCA to the effect matrices (2). This methodology has since been extended to unbalanced designs by the adoption of the general linear model (GLM)-framework in estimating the effects, in a method called ASCA+. (3). A related approach was recently developed, termed linear mixed model-PCA (LiMM-PCA), in which the ASCA+ methodology is adapted to include random effects (4).\n\nLongitudinal intervention studies with repeated measurements over time are an important type of experimental design in biomedical research. Such designs allow separating within-subject variation from between-subject variation, and also permit the study of trends over time. However, repeated measures data have properties which preclude the use of standard linear regression methods, such as fixed effects ANOVA, the most important one being that the observations belonging to the same individual are not independent. While the classical ASCA methodology has long been applied for longitudinal data analysis (2, 5), this approach has generally required strongly balanced designs to yield valid results. In contrast, longitudinal intervention studies routinely have many complicating features, such as unbalanced designs, randomized interventions, and substantial missing data. Repeated measures linear mixed models provide a powerful way to handle these issues (6), but these capabilities have so far not been extended to the multivariate case.\n\nIn this paper we introduce a new methodology, repeated measures ASCA+ (RM-ASCA+), using repeated measures linear mixed models in conjunction with ASCA+. We show how this method can be used in the analysis of longitudinal multivariate data with unbalanced designs and missing outcome data, including both visualization of results and assessment of model uncertainty. We also discuss other linear models for longitudinal data which can be used to estimate the effects, and comment on their suitability for ASCA+. We discuss how to adjust the analyses depending on whether the intervention is randomized or not, and we illustrate these differences by analyzing two different metabolomics datasets. We compare our findings with the original research papers for these datasets, and discuss the added benefit of RM-ASCA+ for biological interpretation in this setting.\n\n5 Discussion\n\nIn this work we have described a novel methodology, RM-ASCA+, suitable for analysis of longitudinal multivariate data, and we have demonstrated this using two publicly available metabolomics datasets. We find that RM-ASCA+ yields interpretable and efficient representations of the findings in the original studies, while also revealing trends not previously apparent.\n\nWe have discussed three commonly used types of longitudinal linear models: 1) repeated measures models (cLDA/ucLDA), 2) longitudinal ANCOVA, and 3) analysis of changes. While the model types will in some settings yield equivalent results, and all will give unbiased estimates of the treatment effect for randomized studies (19), repeated measures models have some general advantages. In addition to allowing direct modeling of the time effect, which is useful when visualizing the effects over time in score plots, they can accommodate both randomized and non-randomized study designs. For these reasons, we find repeated measures models to be a suitable starting point for analyzing such studies using ASCA+.\n\nFor randomized studies, ucLDA and cLDA will usually yield similar score- and loading plots for the same dataset. However, in the case of chance imbalances in metabolites at baseline (which are always present), cLDA will adjust the effect estimates for regression to the mean (8). The intuitive explanation for this is that the group showing highest levels at baseline will on average be expected to decrease slightly at the next measurement, while the lowest group will be expected to increase. A consequence of this is that when estimating the treatment effect, an increase in the group showing the highest baseline levels should be given greater weight than an equivalent increase in the group with the lowest levels, because a further increase is more difficult to achieve if baseline levels are already high by chance. The same holds in the reverse situation. Models involving a baseline adjustment therefore give the most correct estimate of the treatment effect in this setting. The same does not hold for non-randomized studies, except for special situations where treatment assignment is determined by the baseline value (11). For most non-randomized studies, the treatment and control group will regress to different population means, and adjusting for baseline value of the response variable will introduce bias in the effect estimate. In such cases, limiting the analysis to comparison of within-group change may be more appropriate.\n\nWe have demonstrated RM-ASCA+ using data from two different studies. In the first study, by Euceda et al., the metabolic impact of neoadjuvant bevacizumab on tumor metabolism was assessed in a randomized controlled trial (16). The statistical analysis in the published paper involved a combination of PCA, PLS-DA, and univariate mixed models. A clear overall metabolic change over time for the entire cohort was described, characterized by increased levels of glucose and lipids, and decreased levels of phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, choline, and taurine, which was interpreted as signs of normalization of breast tissue metabolism (20). However, no significant discrimination was found at any timepoint between treatment and control by PLS-DA, and on univariate tests only glutathione was found to be significantly affected in the treatment group after adjustment for multiple tests. When applying RM-ASCA+, we find that the estimated scores of the treatment- and control group differ at all post-baseline timepoints, and the difference is robust to Jackknife-validation. The groups show directionally similar metabolic trajectories over time, but the slope is more steep for the treatment group. In PC2 we observe that both groups show a temporary increase in score value, which again is most pronounced in the group treated with bevacizumab, suggesting that the metabolites prominent in the loadings of PC2 (glutathione, choline, phosphocholine, glycine) are differently affected at this timepoint. This might reflect different chemotherapy regimens, as during the first half of the treatment the patients were treated with FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicine, and cyclophosphamide), while the remaining chemotherapy was taxane-based. Another possibility is that it is caused by discontinuation of active treatment, as patients were not given systemic cancer-directed therapies in the last four weeks before surgery.\n\nIn the second dataset included in this paper, Gralka et al. assessed metabolic changes in serum after bariatric surgery. They describe several changes, including increased levels of the amino acids glycine, glutamine, histidine, and arginine, along with increased levels of methylsulfonylmethane, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and formate, irrespective of procedure type. Conversely, concentrations of the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) isoleucine, leucine, valine, and the aromatic amino acids (AAA) phenylalanine and tyrosine were found to decrease, along with the lipoprotein signal and the gut microbiome derived metabolites methanol and isopropylalcohol. They also describe temporarily increased levels of the ketone bodies acetoacetate and hydroxybutyrate, and citrate after surgery, which was interpreted as reflective of ongoing fat catabolism. We find that by using RM-ASCA+ these results are visualized as two separate temporal trends. PC1 shows a large increase in score value from baseline to the first follow-up, and this score remains largely unaltered over time. This component describes the decreased levels of BCAAs, AAAs, lipoprotein signal, and methanol and isopropylalcohol, and increased levels of methylsulfonylmethane, glycine and ketone bodies. Both BCAAs and AAAs are implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome, although their causal relationships remain unclear. Reduced serum levels of BCAAs can be observed after weight loss achieved by either surgery or diet, with the effect possibly being more pronounced for weight loss achieved through surgery (21-23). Like BCAAs, the AAAs phenylalanine and tyrosine have been positively associated with both prediabetes and T2D (24, 25), and changes during weight loss have generally been found to mirror changes in BCAAs (26). Glycine, which increased after bariatric surgery, has been inversely associated with metabolic syndrome, and positively associated with physical activity (27). In one study, reduced glycine levels in obesity was experimentally related to BCAA flux, where BCAA oversupply was hypothesized to interfere with oxidation of fatty acids, causing accumulation of lipid intermediates in the cell, which may deplete glycine levels through production of acylglycine (28). Increased glycine levels could therefore possibly be explained by the reduced supply of BCAAs.\n\nThe response pattern described by PC2 is characterized primarily by increased levels of ketone bodies and citrate. These metabolites increase after surgery, before decreasing over time and appearing to approach a steady state, which is not yet reached at the final follow-up. Both the temporal development and metabolite loadings of PC2 suggest that this component may reflect changes in fat catabolism, which presumably is highest in the first months after surgery, and then tapers off as the patients lose weight and reach a new energy equilibrium. Ketone bodies generally increase during periods of increased fat oxidation, due to increased availability of acetyl-CoA, which then react to produce ketone bodies (29). The explanation for increased citrate is less obvious, but levels of citrate, and other TCA-metabolites in general, have previously been reported to increase during prolonged fasting, possibly due to enhanced mitochondrial activity (30). As the prolonged caloric deficit after surgery may be metabolically similar to fasting, this could explain the increased citrate levels during the period of greatest weight loss.\n\nAnalysis of the time-treatment interaction effect showed that the metabolic effects of proximal RYGB and GS were similar, while the group receiving distal RYGB showed a different metabolic trajectory. This divergence was mainly driven by different effects on the metabolite methylsulfonylmethane. Methylsulfonylmethane increased in all surgery groups after surgery, but the group receiving distal RYGB showed more pronounced increases compared with proximal RYGB or GS. This difference was suggested by Gralka et al. to be due to the malabsorptive effects of distal RYGB, which could result in increased production of methylsulfonylmethane from the gut microbiome as a consequence of increased nutrient availability (18). Dietary supplementation of methylsulfonylmethane has been observed to improve the metabolic profile in obese mice (31). Moreover, observational studies suggest that malabsorptive procedures may produce superior improvements in blood pressure, lipid profile, and subsequent cardiovascular risk reduction, despite producing comparable weight loss (32, 33). These observations may imply that malabsorptive procedures may have additional benefits which are independent of their effects on weight loss. Other gut microbiome-derived metabolites observed to decline after surgery were methanol and isopropylalcohol. However, as these were equally decreased across all surgery types, they are likely altered by a different mechanism than methylsulfonylmethane.\n\nWhile RM-ASCA+ can reveal interesting patterns in high-dimensional longitudinal data, some issues remain to be resolved. Although we have introduced ways of visually assessing the robustness of the results through jackknifing and augmenting the effect matrices with random effects and residuals, how to obtain p-values for the factor effects is not considered here. Another important issue is missing data. While LDA-models use all available data when estimating the effects, they require missing data to be missing at random (MAR) in order to provide unbiased estimates. This means that the probability of missingness must be conditionally independent of the value of the unobserved response, given the subject’s observed covariates (34). For example, if missing samples are metabolically different from non-missing samples from patients with the same covariates, missing data will bias the effect estimates regardless of which linear model is used. This is referred to as missing not at random (MNAR), or non-ignorable missing data. If there is substantial missing data, and it is suspected to be non-ignorable, it is recommended to perform multiple imputation to assess how different assumed distributions for the missing data affect the findings (35). A limitation of RM-ASCA+ compared to LiMM-PCA is that mixed models are computationally demanding, and applying mixed models to potentially tens of thousands of variables may not be feasible. In such situations, the pre-transformation of the response matrix by PCA done in LiMM-PCA can drastically reduce the number of response variables, making LiMM-PCA the more scalable alternative for high-dimensional data.\n\nIn conclusion, repeated measures linear mixed models can be used in conjunction with ASCA+ to visualize and compare multivariate changes between groups over time. This approach is not limited to metabolomics data, but may be suitable for any study using a longitudinal repeated measures design with a multivariate endpoint."
