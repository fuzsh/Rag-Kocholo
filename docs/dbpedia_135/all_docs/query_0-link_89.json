Twelve species that have been imported to, or exported from, Norway since 2010, and two additional species that are traded internationally in substantial volumes, were assessed. This report provides a scientific risk assessment based on the criteria given under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Risk assessments to determine speciesspecific detriment (cf. Res. Conf. 16.7 (Rev. CoP17)), Non-detriment findings (NDFs), were made for 14 tortoise species in international trade. The NDF is a determination of impact from legal international trade on survival of the species in the wild and considers various aspects of its biology, environment, usage, and management. In this report the outcome may be positive (no detriment), negative (detriment) or inconclusive (more documentation needed and NDFs should be made case-by-case). Based on the species-specific assessments VKM concludes no detriment (positive) for eight species (Aldabrachelys gigantea, Centrochelys sulcata, Chelonoidis carbonarius, Chersina angulata, Stigmochelys pardalis, Testudo graeca, Testudo hermanni, and Testudo marginata), detriment (negative) for four species (Chelonoidis denticulatus, Indotestudo forstenii, Kinixys homeana, and Manouria emys) and inconclusive for two species (Kinixys spekii and Testudo horsfieldii). The confidence level of the individual assessments (low to high) depends on the quantity and quality of data on biology, traded volumes, and management. Uncertainties and data gaps in the species assessments were in most cases pertaining to the current statuses and trends of wild populations, the extent of illegal trade and the management of the species in their range states. VKM proposes that the NDF for the species should be applied for a period of five years unless the IUCN assessments are updated and changed. Updates should also be made for the two species that have not yet been assessed by IUCN if assessments for these should be published during the next five years. Norsk: Hovedbudskap: De fleste landskilpaddeartene som er inn- eller utført til og fra Norge er ikke truet av handel. Det viser en ny risikovurdering fra Vitenskapskomiteen for mat og miljø (VKM). Men for noen arter reduserer internasjonal handel evnen til å overleve i naturen.\n\nShow summary\n\nMany species around the world have collapsed, yet only some have recovered. A key question is what happens to populations post collapse. Traditionally, marine fish collapses are linked to overfishing, poor climate, and recruitment. We test whether the effect on biomass change from these drivers remains the same after a collapse. We used a regression model to analyse the effect of harvesting, recruitment, and climate variability on biomass change before and after a collapse across 54 marine fish populations around the world. The most salient result was the change in fishing effect that became weaker after a collapse. The change in sea temperature and recruitment effects were more variable across systems. The strongest changes were in the pelagic habitats. The resultant change in the sensitivity to external drivers indicates that whilst biomass may be rebuilt, the responses to variables known to affect stocks may have changed after a collapse. Our results show that a general model applied to many stocks provides useful insights, but that not all stocks respond similarly to a collapse calling for stock-specific models. Stocks respond to environmental drivers differently after a collapse, so caution is needed when using pre-collapse knowledge to advise on population dynamics and management.\n\nShow summary\n\nAnimal behaviour is important for prevalence and outbreaks of infectious diseases, for instance by affecting individual interactions. Increasing the knowledge of individual movement patterns can provide better insight into disease prevalence and spread, helping to target efforts to minimise disease outbreaks. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease affecting cervids. CWD is transmitted by animal-to-animal contact and through the environment, thus individual variation in space use and social associations may influence disease transmission patterns and infection risk. CWD was detected in Norwegian alpine reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus in 2016, and eradication of the infected population was implemented. A 3:1 infection rate between males and females suggests sex-specific behavioural drivers. We utilised an extensive individual-based dataset of 149 GPS-marked wild reindeer to investigate individual variation in movement patterns in terms of inter- and intra-annual home range size and site fidelity, and variation in home range overlap and distances between individuals. We aimed to identify patterns which could indicate higher potential disease risk. Females had larger annual and seasonal home ranges than males, except during calving and rut. Greater home range overlaps and shorter between-individual distances were found between same-sex individuals than different-sex individuals, except during the rut. Accordingly, the rut season stands out with greater male home ranges, greater home range overlap and shorter distances between males and between males and females, which could indicate that this season is critical for disease transmission. Measures to prevent disease spread should lower contact rates, e.g. by reducing the abundance of adult males before they mix with other groups during the rut. This can be achieved for instance by allowing earlier hunt on adult males when they are distributed in small male groups, to reduce the transmission risk and keep disturbance of other individuals low.\n\nShow summary\n\n1. The state of sea trout in 1251 Norwegian watercourses was assessed based on a scoring system for human pressures, abundance data, and local knowledge. 2. Over 16,000 km of rivers and lakes were available to sea trout in these watercourses, spanning from the temperate to Arctic regions. 3. Sea trout were classified to be in a good or very good state in fewer than 25% of the watercourses and in a poor or very poor state in almost 40%. Twenty-nine watercourses had lost their sea trout populations. 4. Salmon lice from aquaculture salmon farms had by far the largest adverse effect on sea trout among the human impact factors, both in the number of watercourses (83%) and river area affected (60%), and the total effect on sea trout abundance. 5. Agriculture and hydropower production also had strong adverse impacts (35% and 19% of watercourses), but substantially lower than that caused by salmon lice. Culverts related to road crossings and other habitat alterations also had impacts on sea trout in many watercourses (27%). 6. Exploitation of sea trout has been reduced in Norway in recent years, both in the marine and freshwater fisheries. Yet, the exploitation pressure was moderate or high in almost 14% of the watercourses where the state of sea trout was poor or very poor, suggesting a high potential for overexploitation in these. 7. The state of sea trout was best in the northern sparsely populated areas. However, distribution of watercourses with sea trout in a poor or very poor state was more linked to aquaculture, agriculture, and hydropower production than human population density. 8. The developed approach for large-scale mapping of state and pressures, which is vital for prioritizing management measures, may inspire other nations in their conservation effort for this important species. acidification, anthropogenic pressures, brown trout (Salmo trutta), culverts, exploitation, hazardous substances, salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), sewage\n\nShow summary\n\nBrown trout Salmo trutta populations are common in small boreal streams in Scandinavia. Populations are often small and isolated. In this chapter, I summarized studies conducted for 8 years on a population of small-sized brown trout living in a small Norwegian boreal stream exposed to harsh winters (>5 months of ice cover) and low water levels during summer. Subsequently, I evaluated factors influencing local use of spawning areas and the distribution of age-0 individuals during autumn in a contiguous 1.4 km portion of the stream. Finally, I analyzed the local and temporal variation in individual length of the age-0 individuals during late fall and related distribution of age-0 brown trout to habitat qualities, including fish density and environmental factors varying at the catchment scale (i.e., discharge and temperature) or at the local scale (i.e., habitat characteristics summarized using principal component analysis and presence/absence of competitors). Spawning occurred throughout the stream, indicating that female brown trout were able to find small patches of suitable spawning habitat in most study sections. Age-0 brown trout were also found in all sections of the stream, with large variation among sections. General linear mixed effects models, with year as a random effect, indicated that variation in the second principal component was the main factor determining density of both mature and age-0 brown trout. However, the effect was in opposite direction for the two groups. Variation in length of age-0 brown trout was substantial, and associated with most of the measured parameters. There was a significant negative density effect, and this effect was exacerbated by the presence of alpine bullhead Cottus poecilopus. Both mature brown trout and age-0 juveniles utilized the full extent of the study area, leading to substantial phenotypic variation.\n\nShow summary\n\nNorthern Europe experienced extreme topographical, environmental and climatic changes during the last interglacial-glacial cycle. High-latitude, fossil faunal records are, however, almost non-existent due to the Late Pleistocene erosion and removal of sediments by flushing meltwater from the massive glaciers that covered extensive parts of the northern temperate regions. The effects of the dramatic Quaternary climatic changes on animal distributions in Fennoscandia therefore remain largely unresolved. The Storsteinshola cave system (68°50’N) in Kjøpsvik, northern Norway, is an exception, with one of the sections of this large karst cave system containing an extra-ordinary bone-rich sediment deposit preliminary dated to 70 000 - 120 000 years BP. We exploit the exceptional opportunity of this deposit for the comparative, interdisciplinary analyses of a high-latitude faunal record from the last interglacial-glacial cycle. Following two large-scale excavations, we combined morphological identification with bulk-bone metabarcoding to maximise taxonomic identification of the highly fragmented, recovered bone material. Through these analyses over 40 taxa were identified, including a diverse range of mammals (e.g. bear Ursus sp., reindeer Rangifer tarandus, bowhead whale Balaena mysticetus), birds (e.g. king eider Somateria spectabilis, ptarmigan Lagopus sp., common murre Uria aalge) and fish (e.g. Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, golden redfish Sebastes marinus, salmonids Salvelinus). Our results highlight the power of combining ancient DNA with traditional, zooarchaeological methods to broaden taxonomic identification of fragmentary material that is otherwise difficult or even impossible to identify. Moreover, chronology established using a diversity of dating methods together with sedimentological analyses provide a framework for palaeo-environmental interpretations of the exhaustive faunal record that is reconstructed.\n\nShow summary\n\nNordic cave environments, and particularly their stratified and undisturbed context, can provide an exceptional record of fossils, bones and sediment layers in addition to prehistoric artefacts. These can contribute to a better understanding of past human-environment entanglement and other human activities within the caves’ histories and their surroundings. Not only can the preserved stratigraphy and excavated finds be used to locate major and minor climatic impacts in the past, but they are also an invaluable source of refining macro- and micro-chronological events during the Holocene. These archives are currently in danger of being destroyed and contaminated by cave visitors, geo-tourism, developing industry and climate change. Therefore, it is long over-due to both study and preserve Nordic caves. This presentation will introduce my PhD project implementing an interdisciplinary methodological approach in Archaeology, Biology and Earth science to work towards a more comprehensive picture of the use of caves and human-animal impact on taphonomic long-term processes within cave environments during the past 12,000 years. Through analyses of animal bones, alongside the sedimentary and archaeological record derived from recently excavated caves, this PhD – which is also part of the SaveCave project – will shed more light on past ecosystems and generate diverse perspectives on cave environments specifically from an archaeological perspective.\n\nShow summary\n\nPaleo-archives are essential for our understanding of species responses to climate warming, yet such archives are extremely rare in the Arctic. Here, we combine morphological analyses and bulk-bone metabarcoding to investigate a unique chronology of bone deposits sealed in the high-latitude Storsteinhola cave system (68°50’ N 16°22’ E) in Norway. This deposit dates to a period of climate warming from the end of the Late Glacial to the Holocene Thermal Maximum. A combination of comparative morphology and paleogenetic analyses allowed us to exploit the deposit to its full potential, with ancient DNA providing taxonomical identification to the 1000s of morphologically unidentifiable bone fragments. Our results show a high-resolution sequence of fish, mammal, and bird species, including species not previously discovered in the region, and providing fundamental insights in the ecosystem-wide responses that are ongoing today.\n\nShow summary\n\nThe Migration for Development project is jointly funded by industry partners and implemented to complement and support the VisAviS collaborative research project funded by the Research Council of Norway. As part of the work, two avian radars were deployed at coastal locations in Norway to record seasonal bird migrations. Here, we present an investigation of the avian radar data collected at Lista (Farsund municipality) during the spring and autumn and at Utsira during the autumn of 2023. Firstly, using radar tracks annotated by an observer, we show case issues with how the radar classifies bird tracks (small, medium, large and flock). We used the data from annotated tracks to provide improved categories of radar tracks. Secondly, using all tracks collected by the radar, we filtered these based on likely migration flight characteristics, and present temporal and spatial patterns of probable migration tracks. The length and definition of the migration season varied by location. Migration peaks most consistently occurred from late afternoon through the evening. There were significant site- and season-specific differences in flight height and the proportion of birds in the rotor swept zone. At Lista a significant proportion of birds flew within the clearance zone between the sea surface and the rotor swept zone. We recommend including the proportion of birds flying in this narrow band (20m) in considerations of impacts of wind energy developments. Birds tended to migrate with a tail or cross-tail wind. Lastly, there were site-specific differences in size groups detected at Lista and Utsira, with Utsira predominantly detecting birds in the intermediate category and just a few large flocks, but no small birds. At Lista, all categories were detected by the radar."
