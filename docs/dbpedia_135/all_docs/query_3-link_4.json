        "text": "Vicky is expecting her second child -- gender a surprise -- a sibling for their son, Edwin.\n\nVicky writes: \"Our little boy is 2 and is called Edwin. We picked Edwin because we wanted something which was easy to spell and pronounce, it's non biblical and has lots of nicknames which we can shorten it to!\n\nHowever..... Baby number 2 is proving tricky. We don't know the sex of the baby but would like something similar in that we want to be able to shorten it.\n\nSo far the names we like are:\n\nBoys:\n\nRupert\n\nRafferty - this is my husband's choice but I think this is way too posh for us!\n\nWalter - last name [begins with a W] and I'm also wary of names with a 't' in the middle as we live in Yorkshire and people tend to miss the pronunciation out!\n\nPhineas- again not sure if this is too posh\n\nGirls:\n\nNina\n\nBeatrice\n\nNora\n\nOlive\n\nMabel\n\nViolet\n\nNames that we can't have: Iris, Ivy, Henry, Arlo, Erin\n\nWe would like something that matches Edwin in terms of an older name but want to avoid another 'E' name or anything that ends in 'win'.\n\nMiddle name wise, thinking Alice if a girl and Arthur for a boy. We don't mind having something too popular of a name for either middle or first name, as long as we love it.\n\nI feel like what we want is actually quite simple but we still don't have any that we love.\n\n※ ※ ※ ※\n\nYou have a great list already, but sometimes the \"right\" name can feel elusive. Fortunately, there are several names which meet your criteria:\n\nRalph – Like Edwin, Ralph has both Anglo-Saxon and Viking heritage and was a favourite with the Normans. In the North of England, it has for centuries been pronounced RALF. The name Rafe is a brother form of the name worth considering, reflecting how Ralph was pronounced in the south of England after the Great Vowel Shift. Generally, Rafe now stands alone in its own right, while Ralph has almost universally adopted the Northern pronunciation.\n\nAlfred – Like Edwin, Alfred was a royal Anglo-Saxon powerhouse. It also offers a wealth of nicknames such as Alf, Alfie and Freddie.\n\nWilfred – A saintly Anglo-Saxon name (like Edwin) which was beloved by the Victorians. Unlike Walter, I don't think Wilfred is particularly rhymey with your surname -- in fact, I think they work rather well. Wilf, Wilfy, Freddie, Wolf, Billy or Fritz.\n\nFelix – A classic Roman name which was used in the Middle Ages. Not only does it mean \"happy,\" the name itself has a bouncy, jovial style.\n\nRex – Sporting the same stylish -x, Rex is a Latin name meaning \"king,\" but is also a Saxon surname meaning \"dweller by the rushes.\" In the 19th century, Rex was commonly used as a nickname for Reginald — presumably a play on the genitive and dative form of the Latin rex: regis and regi. British Hollywood actor, Sir Reginald \"Rex\" Harrison, is a prime example of this.\n\nReginald – A Norman favourite which has the same history and charm as Edwin. Not only can Rex be used as a nickname, so, too, can Reggie.\n\nChester – Friendly and approachable, Chester has a vintage vibe and, though it's use as a first name only goes back to the 16th century, it has been a staple of British topography for millennia.\n\nOtis – An English surname/late medieval form of Odo which derives from the Old Saxon ōd 'wealth, riches'. Otto is a variant form which is also worth consideration.\n\nAngus – Adorable Angus is a Scottish name with ancient Gaelic roots. Borne by early royalty, it dates right back to ancient Irish mythology, in which Óengus was the god of love, youth and poetic inspiration. The name is thought to derive from the Proto-Celtic *oino- \"one\" and gustu \"strength, force, excellence.\"\n\nLeonard – An Old Germanic name derived from lewo \"lion\" and hard \"hardy, brave, bold.\" It became popular in medieval Britain thanks to a popular 5th century saint and still retains and old-school charm.\n\nDouglas – The name of an old Scottish clan who take their name from the River Douglas. A great retro choice with ties to the natural world.\n\nVincent – From the Latin vincere \"to conquer,\" Vincent has been used in Britain since the Middle Ages, but, like Edwin, it was especially popular with the Victorians.\n\nAlden – Like Edwin, Alden has Anglo-Saxon pedigree. It derives the Old English name Healfdene, an Anglo-Scandinavian name meaning \"half Dane,\" cognate with the Old Norse Halfdanr, which was famously borne by a legendary Danish king of the Scylding, immortalised in the poem Beowulf.\n\nCora – An Edwardian darling, Cora has simple yet stately style with ancient heritage. As Nora is on your list, Cora is worth mentioning.\n\nFlora – Another Nora-esque name is lovely Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers, vegetation, fertility and the spring. Perfect for a Spring baby!\n\nHazel – With Olive and Mabel both on your list, Hazel is a perfect compliment. A flapper-favourite, Hazel is winning hearts in many English-speaking countries.\n\nMatilda – Like Edwin, Matilda is a medieval powerhouse which was borne by a bevy of medieval queens -- many of whom lived up to their battle-brave name.\n\nAudrey – Chic, vintage and elegant (thanks to Ms Hepburn), for all its sleekness, Audrey is another Anglo-Saxon descendent like Edwin. Derived from the Old English Æthelthryth \"noble strength,\" it belonged to a 7th century saint who was popular in the Middle Ages. It was also borne by a character in Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It (1599).\n\nHarriet – The English vernacular form of French Henriette, a feminine form of Henri. Harriet has a sweet Georgian charm that wears well at all ages.\n\nNova – Part Nina-part Nora, Nova is a sweet vintage name which rose to prominence in the 1930s thanks to the career of British actress Nova Pilbeam (1919-2005). It is now fashionable once more, having risen to #273 in 2017.\n\nNola – Another Nina-Nora-esque vintage name that it on the rise again, that, like Nova, rose in the 1930s.\n\nAda – A short and sweet Victorian darling which was popularised by gifted mathematician, Ada Lovelace -- credited as the “first computer programmer.”\n\nAdeline – Adeline is a medieval diminutive form of Ada, both of which mean \"noble.\" It was well used among Norman nobility and still retains its regal flair. Adelaide is another variant worth consideration.\n\nClara – Ladylike with a feisty edge, Clara is a Roman name meaning \"clear, bright, shining, renowned, famous, upstanding\" which was popularly revived in the 18th century, becoming a staple for the Victorians.\n\nI hope this has been of use. Best wishes for finding the perfect name."
