        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nInfectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a serious disease that primarily affects farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), although some other salmonids are also susceptible (OIE, 2019a). The disease is caused by infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV), a member of the genus Isavirus, family Orthomyxoviridae. The ISA virus has two main phenotypic variants based on the sequence of the highly polymorphic region (HPR) of gene segment 6: non-pathogenic ISAV-HPR0 and pathogenic ISAV-HPRΔ. ISAV-HPRΔ is associated with clinical outbreaks of the disease on farms (also referred to here as ‘cases’), which may cause high mortality and mandatory mitigation measures, leading to significant economic losses. Today, ISA affects salmon farms in Northern Europe, North America and Chile. Pathogenic ISAV infections are OIE-listed and notifiable within the EU including Norway (NFD, 2008b; OIE, 2019b).\n\nInfectious salmon anaemia was first discovered in Norway in 1984 (Thorud and Dupvik, 1988). The highest number of outbreaks occurred in 1990 with 80 confirmed outbreaks (Sommerset et al., 2020). The introduction of specific and general biosecurity measures in the early 1990s led to a sharp decline in the annual number of cases (Sommerset et al., 2020). Primary cases of ISA are thought to occur from ISAV-HPR0 transitioning to ISAV-HPRΔ, causing ISA outbreaks (Christiansen et al., 2017; Nylund et al., 2019). The HPR0 strains are highly prevalent in farmed salmon and occur both in hatcheries and in marine farms. Prior to 2020, around 40% of ISA outbreaks in Norway were estimated to be primary outbreaks (Aldrin et al., 2021). Primary outbreaks are known to cause secondary outbreaks when the virus spreads horizontally to nearby farms through live animal movements, vessel movements and passive transport via water currents (Lyngstad et al., 2008; Murray et al., 2002). In recent years, outbreaks of ISA in Norway have been largely sporadic, and the mechanisms giving rise to individual outbreaks can be unclear.\n\nIn this paper, we describe the observed increase in marine farm cases of ISAV-HPRΔ in Norway in 2020. Here, we use ‘case’ to describe confirmed cases of ISAV-HPRΔ in marine salmonid farms; dates refer to the date of first detection or suspicion.\n\n2 SURVEILLANCE AND OUTBREAK INVESTIGATION\n\nMost cases of ISAV-HPRΔ in Norway are detected through the passive surveillance system (NFD, 2008a, 2008b). The Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) officially declares a suspicion of ISA for farms based on the detection of ISAV-HPRΔ by PCR or histopathological findings of changes conducive with ISA and detection of ISAV by immunohistochemistry. The diagnosis is confirmed through a combination of histopathology and detection of virus with two independent methods. Following a confirmation of ISA, the NFSA usually establishes a containment area surrounding the site, where farms are subjected to an active surveillance programme. In addition to the surveillance data, the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) receives monthly farm-level production data from NFSA including the number of fish and their mean weight, stocking month(s) and slaughter month(s). Other information about the characteristics of the farms is available from the Directorate of Fisheries. For outbreak investigations, NFSA collects ad hoc information from the infected farms, such as the hatchery.\n\n3 DESCRIPTION OF ISAV-HPRΔ CASES IN 2020\n\nThere were 23 cases with ISAV-HPRΔ first detected in 2020 (Figure 1, Table 1). In the previous five years (2015–2019), there were 9–16 cases detected per year. Cases in 2020 were distributed throughout Norway, but the prevalence was highest in production area 12 (Figure 2, Figure 3). Table 1 shows the epidemiological characteristics of the cases from 2015 to 2020. All of the case farms in 2020 produced Atlantic salmon for food consumption, and they had concessions associated with 20 different companies. The median time from first stocking to first detection was 456 days (range 21–654 days), and the median reported fish weight during the month of first detection was 4,054 g (range 203 − 6,598 g) (Table 1). There was one affected farm (#15) that was positive the same month it was stocked, although ISAV-HPRΔ has not been detected in the hatchery.\n\n2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Case farms (incidence) 23 9 12 16 12 15 Case farms with fish for food production 23 9 11 13 12 13 Yearly prevalence (%) 3 1 1 2 1 2 Median time (days) from stocking to detection (range)a 456 (21–654) 439 (235–555) 410 (145–592) 410 (237–640) 359 (46–515) 328 (69–567) Median weight (grams) at month of detection (range)a 4,054 (203–6598) 4,036 (592–5245) 4,132 (431–6385) 3,292 (896–5879) 2,763 (203–5306) 1,213 (204–4369) Missing stocking datea 0 0 0 1 0 1 Case farms with previous cases 6 2 2 1 1 3 Hatcheries supplying smolt to case farmsa 28 11 15 21 16 24 Missing smolt origina 0 0 2 2 0 0 Case farms near previously detected cases with overlapping production cycles Within 10 km 5 3 2 3 3 2 Within 20 km 10 3 4 4 5 6 Within 30 km 14 3 4 4 6 6\n\nThere were 28 different hatcheries associated with the case farms. Eleven hatcheries were associated with multiple cases in 2020: eight with two cases, two with three cases and one with four cases (Figure 4). Six of the case farms (26%) had ISAV-HPRΔ detected in previous years (2005–2018); four of the previous detections occurred in 2016–2018. Two of these case farms had two consecutively infected cohorts (#1 and #20), although the genetic data do not suggest they were infected by the previous cohorts. Several case farms were also located geographically near previously detected cases with overlapping production cycles; these occurred at seaway distances within 10km (n = 5), 20km (n = 10) and 30km (n = 14) (Table 1). Based on phylogenetic data (Table S1), eleven cases in 2020 were associated with ISAV-HPRΔ that showed no relationship to previous cases, while five cases were similar to previous cases (#3, #11, #16, #19 and #20). Seven cases in 2020 had ISAV-HPRΔ that was closely related to ISAV-HPR0 from the hatchery supplying the smolt; however, horizontal transfer cannot be ruled out for some of these cases. For example, if genetically similar cases are both located geographically near with overlapping production cycles and have smolt from the same hatchery, they could be connected through the hatchery or through horizontal transmission.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n\nThe number of ISAV-HPRΔ cases in 2020 was the highest recorded in Norway since 1992. The 23 cases in 2020 could be within the natural variation expected for the disease, or they could signal a future rise in cases due to changes in the disease dynamics. There is no single obvious cause for the increased incidence of cases in the past year. More than half of the cases (61%) detected in 2020 were near previous cases in the same geographic area (within 30 km). Geographic clustering of primary cases could arise from similar environmental conditions that favour the transition from low pathogenic to high pathogenic variants (Lyngstad et al., 2018). Other known risk factors for ISA can be related to suboptimal management, including increased handling of the fish and higher fish densities (Lyngstad et al., 2018). Such risk factors could also explain why some farms have had repeated outbreaks of ISAV-HPRΔ. Further research is needed to more precisely disentangle the causes of the cases in 2020 (Box 1).\n\nBOX 1. Recommendations for further research needed to determine the mechanisms giving rise to ISAV-HPRΔ cases in Norway:\n\nEstablishing the distribution and variation of ISAV-HPR0 in hatcheries and marine farms\n\nDetermining risk factors for HPR0 in hatcheries\n\nDetermining risk factors for ISAV-HPR0 transitioning ISAV-HPRΔ\n\nUnderstanding the genetic variation of ISAV-HPRΔ within hosts and marine farms\n\nDetermining risk factors for developing outbreaks of ISAV-HPRΔ\n\nThe EU introduced a new Animal Health Law in April 2021, and Norway is currently developing a new management plan for ISA. Regardless of whether or not there will be an official regulation of ISA in Norway in the future, the apparent increase in ISA cases in 2020 highlights the need for a continued focus on biosecurity at each of the production stages (Lillehaug et al., 2015). The aquaculture industry in Norway has grown both in the number of farms and in the size of the farms, which can lead to new challenges for disease management. Collaboration between the industry, research institutions and the competent authority investigating the causes of these outbreaks and the transmission pathways involved in further spread will be crucial for future disease control.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nETHICAL APPROVAL\n\nNA."
