        "text": "Outside of its native Scandinavia, where it has remained in some use since early Old Norse history, one of the most famous early bearers of the name was 10th-century Earl of Orkney, Thorfinn Torf-Einarsson (d.c.963), known in the Viking fashion as \"Thorfinn Skullsplitter.\"\n\nHe was followed later by another Earl of Orkney, Thorfinn Sigurdsson (c.1009–c. 1065), also known as \"Thorfinn the Mighty.\"\n\nCertainly, the name Thorfinn was used in small numbers in the early Middle Ages, particularly in Norse held lands in Britain such as Orkney and Shetland, the Hebrides, Caithness and Sutherland in Scotland, and the Danelaw in England, mostly comprised of 15 north-eastern shires.\n\nThe Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England has records in England of a Thorfinn of Austwick, (listed as 'Torfin' and 'Turfin') who held over forty holdings in the Domesday of 1066 (see image, right), and Thorfynn mac Thore who was granted land in Cumbria by Gospatric Earl of Northumbria in the 11th century.\n\nSimilarly, the People of Medieval Scotland database has 6 records of men named Thorfinn from 1093-1371.\n\nReaney and Wilson* derive the surname Turpin from Thorfinn, via the Latinised forms Torphinus/Turp(h)inus citing several examples of the name in use, including Turfinus filius Torfini in the 1130 Yorkshire Pipe Roll; Turpinus in the 1180 Hampshire Pipe Roll; Torphinus in the 1196 Yorkshire Pipe Roll; and Thorpinus filius Simonis in the 1230 Devonshire Pipe Roll.\n\nThe Latinised form Turpinus seems to have been influenced by the Latin turpis \"base,\" a name adopted by early Christians as a token of humility.\n\nThe surname Turpin was used in Britain from at least the 12th century, though Reaney and Wilson point out that Thorfinn is found in Normandy where the earliest examples of Turpin occur.\n\nThough there are some records to be found in Scandinavia for Thorfinn/Torfinn in the Early Modern Period, including the feminine form Thorfinna, records in Britain are sparse, though a Turfin Adams baptised in 1560 in Kent, and Turvin Hodges in 1700 in Middlesex suggest that it held on scantly in modernised English forms. As with most surnames, Turpin can also be found as a first name during this period.\n\nThorfinn, however, has seen a small revival in the 20th century, with majority of registrations for the name coming from Orkney.\n\nRegistration records for Thorfinn as a first name in Scotland and England and Wales:\n\nScotland England & Wales 1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s: 0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n1 births\n\n0 births\n\n3 births\n\n1 birth\n\n0 births\n\n4 births\n\n2 births\n\n1 birth\n\n6 births 0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n1 birth\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n1 birth\n\nSince 1996, Thorfinn has not ranked at all in the official data for England and Wales. The data only includes names of three or more in any given year, however, so Thorfinn's uncommon use is masked. There was certainly one Thorfinn registered in 2001 and one in 2002 in England, and several more boys registered with Thorfinn as a middle name.\n\nIn Scotland, however, Thorfinn has seen consistent use, especially in Orkney.\n\nIt has seen a gradual rise in use, from #472 (1 birth) in 1974 to #380 (3 births) in 1995 and #417 (4 births) in 2003.\n\nAt it's peak year in 2013 (#466 with 6 births), Thorfinn appears in the Scottish regional data at joint #2 in the Orkney islands, alongside Jack and Robbie which all had 4 births."
