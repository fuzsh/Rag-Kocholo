        "text": "Yeast produced from lignocellulosic biomass has the potential to serve as a high-quality protein source with health benefits, especially during critical stages of the Atlantic salmon life cycle, such as during seawater transfer (SWT). In this study, we evaluated the effect of adding 25% Candida utilis yeast to salmon feed on growth performance and overall health by using morphometry, immunohistochemistry, cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and gene expression analysis during and after SWT. There were four dietary treatments: 1) control diet in freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) (Control); 2) control diet in FW and a yeast-based diet in SW (Control/Yeast); 3) yeast-based diet in FW and SW (Yeast); 4) yeast-based diet in FW and a control diet in SW (Yeast/Control). Our results showed that fish fed the yeast diet throughout the FW and SW period achieved higher feed intake and higher growth rate than fish fed the control diet. Morphometric and immunochemical analyses of the distal intestine (DI) revealed decreased length and number of CD3 labeled cells in the simple folds of fish fed control diet, while no changes were observed in fish fed the yeast diet. Furthermore, yeast significantly decreased the secretion of IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-8, and modulated the gene expression of aquaporin 8 (aqp8ab), superoxide dismutase (sod1) and major histocompatibility complex 1 (mhc1) in DI, suggesting reduced inflammatory processes in yeast fed fish. These findings indicate that Candida utilis yeast is a promising alternative protein source with functional properties in diets for smolting Atlantic salmon before and after SWT.\n\nEfficacy of three marine yeasts (Debaryomyces hansenii S8, Debaryomyces hansenii S100 and Candida tropicalis S186) as feed supplement for Penaeus indicus was estimated in comparison with Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC 36, a commercial feed (Higashi Maru Feeds, India) and a control feed. The yeast component of control feed was replaced with Carboxy Methyl Cellulose. Biomass of yeast strains in Malt extract agar incorporated into a standard diet was used to prepare the experimental yeast diets. P. indicus was fed these diets for a period of 28 days and growth parameters were assessed. Among the three marine yeast diets, D. hansenii S8 supported the best bio-growth parameters. Commercial feed was found to be better in efficiency compared to the Baker's yeast (F36) diet and control diet. Histological examination of the hepatopancreas was carried out in an attempt to evaluate the toxic effects, if any, in shrimps fed yeast diets. The cross section of hepatopancreas tubules of the midgut-gland of shrimps that were fed the control feed was taken as reference for the comparative studies. Unlike earlier reports of adverse effects on intestinal function and an intensified immune response in fishes on fish meal replacement diet, no histopathological alterations indicative of toxic effects could be observed in the shrimps fed yeast diets. The three tested marine yeasts could very well be used as feed supplement in aquaculture as they have desirable qualities and no noticeable histological consequences on the shrimps.\n\nIn this study, Candida utilis was included as alternative protein source in diets for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr and the effects on growth performance and distal intestinal (DI) health were assessed. The potential of C. utilis to counteract possible adverse effects of a high soybean meal (SBM) diet was additionally assessed by using graded levels of C. utilis in combination with a 40% SBM diet. Six experimental diets were formulated: Fishmeal control (FM); FM with 20% C. utilis (FM20CU); SBM-based diet containing 40% SBM (SBM); three SBM-based test diets, where wheat gluten and starch were substituted with increasing levels of C. utilis of 5%, 10% and 20% (SBM5CU, SBM10CU and SMB20CU, respectively). A total of 2700 Atlantic salmon parr with an average weight of 4.4 g were distributed into 18 tanks and the diets were fed in triplicates. The experiment lasted 28 days and sampling for histology and gene expression analysis was done at the end of the experiment. The fish grew to an average weight of 14.8 g in 28 days. Fish fed FM20CU obtained a significantly higher specific growth rate (SGR) of 4.59 than the other dietary groups. While fish fed FM and FM20CU displayed normal morphology of the DI, fish fed SBM-based diets showed mild histological changes in the DI that can be related to classical SBM induced enteritis (SBMIE). These changes included reduced height of simple folds and decreased presence of supranuclear vacuoles. The severity of these changes was not altered with increasing levels of C. utilis in the SBM diet. The expression of four of the five selected genes analyzed in the DI were altered by 40% dietary SBM inclusion. Aquaporin 8ab demonstrated the clearest changes among dietary groups, showing down-regulation independent of dietary inclusion of C. utilis. The strong down-regulation of aquaporin has been observed before and may be an indicator for intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, adding C. utilis to diets for Atlantic salmon parr gave high growth performance without any obvious adverse effects on intestinal health, but were unable to counteract the mild histology changes seen in DI of the SBM fed fish.\n\nAquaculture feeds have changed dramatically from being largely based on fishmeal (FM) towards increased use of plant protein sources, which could impact the fish’s immune response. In order to characterize immunomodulatory properties of novel functional ingredients, this study used four diets, one based on FM, a challenging diet with 40% soybean meal (SBM), and two diets containing 40% SBM with 5% of Cyberlindnera jadinii yeast exposed to different down-stream processing conditions: heat-inactivated (ICJ) or autolysation (ACJ). The immunomodulatory effects of the diets were analyzed in the spleen of Atlantic salmon after 37 days of feeding, using a transcriptomic evaluation by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and the detection of specific immunological markers at the protein level through indirect Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (indirect ELISA). The results showed that SBM (compared to FM) induced a down-regulation of pathways related to ion binding and transport, along with an increase at the protein level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interferon gamma (IFNγ). On the other hand, while ICJ (compared to FM-group) maintain the inflammatory response associated with SBM, with higher levels of TNFα and IFNγ, and with an upregulation of creatine kinase activity and phosphagen metabolic process, the inclusion of ACJ was able to modulate the response of Atlantic salmon compared to fish fed the SBM-diet by the activation of biological pathways related to endocytosis, Pattern recognition receptor (PPRs)-signal transduction and transporter activity. In addition, ACJ was also able to control the pro-inflammatory profile of SBM, increasing Interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels and decreasing TNFα production, triggering an immune response similar to that of fish fed an FM-based diet. Finally, we suggest that the spleen is a good candidate to characterize the immunomodulatory effects of functional ingredients in Atlantic salmon. Moreover, the inclusion of ACJ in fish diets, with the ability to control inflammatory processes, could be considered in the formulation of sustainable salmon feed."
