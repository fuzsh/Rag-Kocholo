Here we review the current state of knowledge of the physical, chemical and biological systems in the Barents Sea. Physical conditions in this area are characterized by large seasonal contrasts between partial sea-ice cover in winter and spring versus predominantly open water in summer and autumn. Observations over recent decades show that surface air and ocean temperatures have increased, sea-ice extent has decreased, ocean stratification has weakened, and water chemistry and ecosystem components have changed, the latter in a direction often described as “Atlantification” or “borealisation,” with a less “Arctic” appearance. Temporal and spatial changes in the Barents Sea have a wider relevance, both in the context of large-scale climatic (air, water mass and sea-ice) transport processes and in comparison to other Arctic regions. These observed changes also have socioeconomic consequences, including for fisheries and other human activities. While several of the ongoing changes are monitored and quantified, observation and knowledge gaps remain, especially for winter months when field observations and sample collections are still sparse. Knowledge of the interplay of physical and biogeochemical drivers and ecosystem responses, including complex feedback processes, needs further development.\n\nShow summary\n\nWe here estimate the effectiveness of ten types of salmon lice treatments currently used in the salmonid industry by analysing daily and cage-wise data from 90 full production cycles from farms spread along the Norwegian coast. The calculations are based on a stage-structured population model for salmon lice and accounts for the structure of the data, including the uncertainties that arise from the weekly counting of lice on a subset of the fish. Results suggest that the most commonly used treatment methods in the data set, i.e. thermal, mechanical and freshwater treatments, kill 70–80% of the lice in average, but with high variability. Feed treatments with emamectin benzoate are also commonly used, but are only estimated to kill around 35% of the lice in average. Bath treatments with hydrogen peroxide are estimated to kill around 74% and pyrethroids 50% of the lice in average. The other medicinal treatments were infrequently used in the data set and the estimates are therefore more uncertain. Of note is that the recently licenced bath treatment with imidacloprid is estimated to kill more than 99% of sessile and 98% of pre-adult and adult lice in average. The estimated effects of hydrogen peroxide, pyrethroids and azamethiphos, here based on data from 2017–2020, are lower than estimates from a previous analysis of production data from 2011–2014, possibly because of resistance development. In contrast, there is no indication of reduced effects of thermal, mechanical or freshwater treatments compared to previous analyses of production data from 2013–2018. These results allow comparing the effectiveness of the different treatment methods in a consistent and comprehensive way, hence enabling fish farmers and authorities to better balance the expected benefits of the treatments in terms of lice control against the economic costs, fish welfare and risk of resistance development.\n\nShow summary\n\nChanges in phytoplankton abundance and biomass during the period 1933–2020 were examined by statistical modeling using data from the Inner Oslofjorden phytoplankton database. The phytoplankton abundances increased with eutrophication from 1930s to 1970s, but with the implementation of sewage cleaning measures and a resulting reduction in nutrient releases, the phytoplankton abundance has since then decreased significantly. The onset of the seasonal blooms has started progressively later during the last 15 years, especially the spring bloom. The delayed spring bloom co-occurred with increasing temperature in winter and spring. The diatom biomass decreased more than that of dinoflagellates and other microeukaryotes. The diatom genus Skeletonema dominated the spring bloom and was found to be the key taxa in explaining these changes in abundance and phenology. Extensive summer blooms of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, which has been characteristic for the inner Oslofjorden, has also gradually decreased during the last decades, along with reducing eutrophication. Dinoflagellates have not had the same reduction in abundance as the other groups. Despite an increasing proportion of dinoflagellates compared with other taxa, there are no clear indications of increased occurrence of toxic algal blooms in inner Oslofjorden. However, the introduction of new “toxin-producing” species may cause concern.\n\nShow summary\n\nCleaner fish are commonly used as a control measure against salmon lice infestations in salmonid farms. Lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) is the most common cleaner fish species used in Norwegian farms. However, little is known about how different operational, including environmental, conditions affect the salmon lice grazing efficacy by lumpfish. In this paper, we analyse salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) in the stomach contents of a large sample of more than 20,000 lumpfish from 80 different Norwegian farms. We investigate the proportion of lumpfish with salmon lice and the mean number of salmon lice in the stomach contents of the lumpfish. We further explore how the salmon lice contents vary with different factors like lumpfish weight, weight of salmonids, salmon lice abundance in the cage, cloud cover, and sea temperature. We find that 3.1% of the 24,693 lumpfish contained salmon lice. Most of the lumpfish with salmon lice in their stomach contents contained few (one or two) lice, while there were a few lumpfish which contained many salmon lice. We find more salmon lice in the stomach contents with increasing abundance of salmon lice in the sea cage, lower weight of the salmonids, and in clear weather. Interestingly, for the relationship between lumpfish weight and salmon lice in the stomach contents, we find increased salmon lice grazing from ca. 5 g up to an optimal weight of ca. 40 g, and then a decrease from 40 g. Surprisingly, we find no relationship between sea temperature and salmon lice per lumpfish. We find more salmon lice in the stomach contents of the lumpfish with comparatively high condition. By studying the factors associated with most efficient salmon lice grazing, our paper contributes to understanding how different operational factors affect salmon lice grazing by lumpfish. For controllable factors, the results thus contribute to guiding the best practice for use of lumpfish as a salmon lice control measure.\n\nShow summary\n\nNumerical models of ecological systems are increasingly used to address complex environmental and resource management questions. One challenge for scientists, managers, and stakeholders is to appraise how well suited these models are to answer questions of scientific or societal relevance, that is, to perform, communicate, or access transparent evaluations of ecological models. While there have been substantial developments to support standardised descriptions of ecological models, less has been done to standardise and to report model evaluation practices. We present here a general protocol designed to guide the reporting of model evaluation. The protocol is organised in three major parts: the objective(s) of the modelling application, the ecological patterns o relevance and the evaluation methodology proper, and is termed the OPE (objectives, patterns, evaluation) protocol. We present the 25 questions of the OPE protocol which address the many aspects of the evaluation process and then apply them to six case studies based on a diversity of ecological models. In addition to standardising and increasing the transparency of the model evaluation process, we find that going through the OPE protocol helps modelers to think more deeply about the evaluation of their models. From this last point, we suggest that it would be highly beneficial for modelers to consider the OPE early in the modelling process, in addition to using it as a reporting tool and as a reviewing tool.

Glacier freshwater discharge is typically associated with high sediment load which limits the euphotic depth but may also aid to provide surface waters with essential nutrients, thus having counteracting effects on marine productivity. In situ observations from a few measured fjords across the Arctic indicate that glacier fjords dominated by marine-terminating glaciers are typically more productive than those with only land-terminating glaciers. Here we combine chlorophyll a from satellite ocean color, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass, with glacier meltwater runoff from climatic mass-balance modeling to establish a statistical model of summertime phytoplankton dynamics in Svalbard (mid-June to September). Statistical analysis reveals significant and positive spatiotemporal associations of chlorophyll a with glacier runoff for 7 out of 14 primary hydrological regions but only within 10 km distance from the shore. These seven regions consist predominantly of the major fjord systems of Svalbard. The adjacent land areas are characterized by a wide range of total glacier coverage (35.5%to 81.2 %) and fraction of marine-terminating glacier area (40.2% to 87.4 %). We find that an increase in specific glacier-runoff rate of 10mm water equivalent per 8 d period raises summertime chlorophyll a concentrations by 5.2% to 20.0%, depending on the region. During the annual peak discharge we estimate that glacier runoff increases chlorophyll a by 13.1% to 50.2% compared to situations with no runoff. This suggests that glacier runoff is an important factor sustaining summertime phytoplankton production in Svalbard fjords, in line with findings from several fjords in Greenland. In contrast, for regions bordering open coasts, and beyond 10 km distance from the shore, we do not find significant associations of chlorophyll a with runoff. In these regions, physical ocean and sea-ice variables control chlorophyll a, pointing at the importance of a late sea-ice breakup in northern Svalbard, as well as the advection of Atlantic water masses along the West Spitsbergen Current for summertime phytoplankton dynamics. Our method allows for the investigation and monitoring of glacier-runoff effects on primary production throughout the summer season and is applicable on a pan-Arctic scale, thus complementing valuable but scarce in situ measurements in both space and time.\n\nShow summary\n\nClimate change has large effects on population dynamics of fish species in high latitude ecosystems. Arctic fish stocks experience multiple pressures with changing abiotic living conditions and increased competition and predation from boreal species. However, there are many unknowns regarding how environmental change influences the dynamics of those populations. Here, we focused on the Barents Sea polar cod, a pan-Arctic zooplanktivorous key fish species physiologically and ecologically adapted to the presence of sea ice. We developed an age-resolved Bayesian state-space model of the dynamics of polar cod based on 30 yr of survey data (1986-2015). Using this model, we quantified how inter-annual changes in abundance were associated with abiotic variables (temperature and sea ice cover) and biotic variables (prey biomasses and a predation index). Using the model output, we used a hindcast scenario approach to investigate to which degree the observed variations in total population size were related to the abiotic or biotic variables. Our results showed that variation in abundance of young polar cod (ages 0 and 1) was best explained by abiotic variables while variation in the older age groups (ages 3 and 4) was best explained by predation. Hindcast scenarios showed that the abiotic variables had a more evident effect than predation on population dynamics, but none of the variables we considered could explain the drastic population decline observed in recent years. Our work shows the advantages of studying age-specific responses as a stepping stone to understand changes at the population level.\n\nShow summary\n\nClimate change influences ecological processes and biogeochemical cycles of marine environments. Species may respond and adapt to these changes through shifting spatial distributions, but options may be limited by the required occupancy of essential habitats which are anchored in space. Marine fish species typically have complex life cycles composed of multiple life stages with different degrees of habitat preferences. Limited knowledge of when spatial constraints are most likely to occur in marine fish life cycles has impeded the development of realistic distribution forecasts. In this study, we develop and implement analytical techniques to identify spatial constraints, defined by both the consistency through which a particular geographic area is used year after year, and by the extent of such area with respect to the entire population range. This approach is applied to ten case studies including six groundfish species from the Eastern Bering Sea, three from the Scotian Shelf, and one from the Barents Sea. Our analyses illustrate that the early phase of the species’ life cycle is more spatially constrained than older life stages, and that adult stages are more closely associated with particular temperatures or climate velocities. We detected significant species-specific variability in both the degree to which species are anchored in space throughout their life cycle, and the ontogenetic changes of the geographic association. Some of this variability can be explained by the species life history strategy and this provides promising avenues to extend similar analyses to data poor species. The presence of life history spatial constraints, particularly during early life stages, indicates restrictions exist to changes of spatial distribution and thus questions the assertion that global warming will uniformly result in an increase of harvest at higher latitudes and decreases at lower latitudes. Species distribution models are often parameterized from data based on life stages that are highly variable in space, such as the adult stages during summer months which may result in unrealistic forecasts of distribution. Our study develops ecological and analytical insights that are critical for developing accurate projections of species distributions under different climate change scenarios.\n\nShow summary\n\nWhile the importance of early life survival and growth variations for population dynamics is well documented, there is still a relatively limited understanding of how survival and growth is affected by the species’ spatial distribution. Using Barents Sea spatial bottom survey data (1994–2018), we study the spatiotemporal variability of the juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) growth and survival. We used indices of the spatial distribution of juvenile cod at age-1 to study the role of distribution for the change in abundance and mean body size through their second winter of life (from age-1 to age-2). Over the 24 years analysed, we found that the location where the age-1 cod are in the Barents Sea matters for their growth and survival. We found that year-classes growing up in the western Barents Sea have higher mortality but faster growth than year-classes distributed farther east. Our results indicate that the biotic and abiotic conditions encountered at the settlement location may influence the spatial survival and growth of age-1 cod and subsequently the population dynamics. Our results underscore the importance of distribution for survival and growth early in life and by providing this essential information has implications for stock assessment and spatial fisheries management.\n\nShow summary\n\nIn this study we have compiled a long-term monitoring dataset from the inner Oslofjorden and supplemented it with short-term research data from the same station. Using generalized additive models analysing the data from this time series, we have examined how chlorophyll-a, hydrography, and various nutrient concentrations have changed during 1973–2017 and how they correlate. We describe the seasonality in chlorophyll-a, nitrogen, phosphorus, Secchi-depth, temperature and salinity and how the levels of each variable have changed the last forty years. The results show specifically how levels of chlorophyll-a have decreased significantly and how this correlates with decrease in nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Our results show a significantly positive correlation between chlorophyll-a and phosphorus during spring bloom and between chlorophyll-a and nitrogen during autumn bloom. However, phosphorus levels have increased again during the last 20 years, but chlorophyll-a levels are still low, indicating that the chlorophyll-a level currently may be controlled by the continuous decreasing trend in nitrogen. If nitrogen increase again, the chlorophyll-a level may also begin to increase. The impact of increasing temperature and possible change in starting point for the growing season should be studied further.\n\nShow summary\n\nA key process affecting variation in the recruitment of fish into fisheries is the spatio-temporal overlap between prey and predator (match-mismatch hypothesis, MMH). The Northeast Arctic cod Gadus morhua and its dominant prey, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, have long been studied in the Norwegian-Barents Sea system. However, the mechanistic explanation of how cod survival is affected by MMH dynamics remains unclear. Most MMH studies have focused on either the time synchrony or the spatial overlap between trophic levels. Here, we used G. morhua larvae and C. finmarchicus data collected in the Norwegian-Barents Sea via ichthyoplankton surveys from 1959-1992 to assess the effect of the predator-prey relationship on predator recruitment to the fisheries at age 3 (as a measure of survival) and to develop a metric of predator-prey overlap using spatio-temporal statistical models. We then compared the interannual variability of the predator-prey overlap with the predator’s abundance at recruitment to assess how MMH dynamics explain the survival of cod during its early life stages. We found that the amount of overlap between cod larvae (length: 11-15 mm) and their prey explained 29% of cod recruitment variability. Positive correlations between predator-prey overlap and subsequent recruitment were also found for predators of 6-10 and 16-20 mm, but not for 21+ mm. This improved predator-prey overlap metric is thus (1) useful to better understand how predator-prey dynamics at early life stages of fish impact the survival of later stages; and (2) a valuable tool for assessing the state of an ecosystem.\n\nShow summary\n\nIn high-latitude marine environments, primary producers and their consumers show seasonal peaks of abundance in response to annual light cycle, water column stability and nutrient availability. Predatory species have adapted to this pattern by synchronising life-history events such as reproduction with prey availability. However, changing temperatures may pose unprecedented challenges by decoupling the predator-prey interactions. Here we build a predator-prey model accounting for the full life-cycle of fish and zooplankton including their phenology. The model assumes that fish production is bottom-up controlled by zooplankton prey abundance and match or mismatch between predator and prey phenology, and is parameterised based on empirical findings of how climate influences phenology and prey abundance. With this model, we project possible climate-warming effects on match-mismatch dynamics in Arcto-boreal and temperate biomes. We find a strong dependence on synchrony with zooplankton prey in the Arcto-boreal fish population, pointing towards a possible pronounced population decline with warming because of frequent desynchronization with its zooplankton prey. In contrast, the temperate fish population appears better able to track changes in prey timing and hence avoid strong population decline. These results underline that climate change may enhance the risks of predator-prey seasonal asynchrony and fish population declines at higher latitudes."
