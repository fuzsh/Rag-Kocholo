        "text": "Rhodri had use within early medieval Welsh nobility such as Rhodri ap Idwal (d.754), king of Gwynedd.\n\nOne of the most famous bearers of the name is Rhodri ap Merfyn (c. 820–878), known to history as Rhodri Mawr (\"the Great\") thanks to his being one of the first men to contribute to the growth of the nation of Wales.\n\nNot only was he regarded as a great warrior, Rhodri -- who inherited the Kingdom of Gwynedd from his father -- was ruler of more than half of modern Wales by his death, thanks to inheritance of land from his mother and wife. In 856, Rhodri Mawr famously had a great victory against a force of invading Danes. He also fought off attacks from neighbouring Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.\n\nRhodri Mawr's grandson, the revered ruler Hwywel Dda (\"the Good\") had a son named Rhodri ap Hywel (d.953) who succeeded his father as King of Deheubarth.\n\nRhodri continued to be used within medieval Welsh royalty, though it was relatively uncommon. In Welsh Surnames, Morgan and Morgan state: \"it is strange how infrequently the name Rhodri occurs in the medieval period.\"*\n\nThe name Rhodri all but died out by the late Middle Ages, especially with the suppression of the Welsh language and culture from the 16th to 18th century. The Act of Union in 1536 banned Welsh speakers from public office and made English the official language of the country. This took place against a background of high immigration of non-Welsh speakers into Wales which began to dilute Welsh-speaking populations.\n\nAccording to an analysis of first names from the 1851 Glamorgan census, \"men with distinctively Welsh names accounted for only 8% of all men and a mere 2% of women.\"\n\nRhodri was used in small numbers in the 19th century, but it wasn't until the 1940s that it began to be revised seriously in Wales.\n\nRegistration records for Rhodri as a first name in England and Wales:\n\n1840s:\n\n1850s:\n\n1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s: 1 birth\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n2 births\n\n1 birth\n\n3 births\n\n3 births\n\n9 births\n\n6 births\n\n6 births\n\n27 births\n\n60 births\n\n168 births\n\n449 births\n\nIn recent years, Rhodri has seen a decline in England and Wales, as we can see from the chart below:\n\nHowever, most of the births for Rhodri in recent years have been in Wales. When the data for England and Wales is separated, we get a very different picture.\n\nThe following chart shows the regional data for Wales alone from 2010 to 2016:\n\nThe 2013 regional data is missing, as it was not released by the ONS. However, based on the total number of births of Rhodri in that year, I am estimating would have ranked around the #190 mark in Wales that year.\n\nThe chart below shows the disparity between the usage of Rhodri in Wales and England individually.\n\nWales England E&W Combined 2014\n\n2015\n\n2016 #135 (25 births)\n\n#197 (15 births)\n\n#223 (12 births) 5 births\n\n5 births\n\n7 births #959\n\n#1279\n\n#1363\n\nIn 2017, Rhodri ranked #1247 with 21 births in England and Wales combined.\n\nThanks to its literary use, Griselda was moderately used in the Middle Ages and became more common by the 16th century, especially in Scotland. However, it is unlikely that any of these women would have been known as Zelda, given that the vernacular form in Britain was Grisel (Grissel, Grissell, Grizel, Grizzell, Grizzle, Grysell etc).\n\nSmith Bannister's rankings of top 50 names from forty English parishes in each decade from 1538 to 1700 had Grisel appear once at #46 in 1690-1700.\n\nThe form Griselda itself came into proper use in the late 18th century, and is thought to have been boosted by Maria Edgeworth's novel Griselda (1804).\n\nIt is during the 19th century that Zelda came into use in its own right, featuring in romance novels such as Jane Howard's Zelda: A Tale of the Massachusetts Colony (1866) and Robert Edward Francillon's Zelda's Fortune (1874). Certainly, Zelda Fitzgerald nee Sayre (1900-1948), American socialite, novelist, painter and wife of author F. Scott Fitzgerald, was supposedly named for characters in these novels.*\n\nA serialised novel, A Discarded Inheritance, featuring a young woman named Zelda Boyce, appeared in several local British newspapers from 1888 onwards (the latest I can find is 1898), and it is interesting to note that Zelda's use began to rise from the 1890s, peaking in the 1920s when Zelda Fitzgerald was a well-known social figure.\n\nRecords for Zelda as a first name in the England and Wales Birth Index:\n\nZelda Griselda 1840s:\n\n1850s:\n\n1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s: 0 births\n\n0 births\n\n2 births\n\n9 births\n\n8 births\n\n16 births\n\n58 births\n\n81 births\n\n110 births\n\n96 births\n\n90 births\n\n79 births\n\n78 births\n\n100 births\n\n2 birth\n\n7 births\n\n6 births\n\n12 births\n\n20 births\n\n18 births\n\n30 births\n\n33 births\n\n20 births\n\n21 births\n\n57 births\n\n36 births\n\n17 births\n\n8 births\n\nBy the 1990s, Zelda was only used a handful of times each year. Indeed, from 1996 to 2013, Zelda never had more than 8 births in any given year.\n\nSince 2014, however, Zelda has started to see an upturn in use, going from #2314 (11 births) to #1240 (27 births) in 2015.\n\nIn 2017, Zelda ranked #1296 with 26 births in England and Wales. It was unranked in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nOutside of its native Scandinavia, where it has remained in some use since early Old Norse history, one of the most famous early bearers of the name was 10th-century Earl of Orkney, Thorfinn Torf-Einarsson (d.c.963), known in the Viking fashion as \"Thorfinn Skullsplitter.\"\n\nHe was followed later by another Earl of Orkney, Thorfinn Sigurdsson (c.1009–c. 1065), also known as \"Thorfinn the Mighty.\"\n\nCertainly, the name Thorfinn was used in small numbers in the early Middle Ages, particularly in Norse held lands in Britain such as Orkney and Shetland, the Hebrides, Caithness and Sutherland in Scotland, and the Danelaw in England, mostly comprised of 15 north-eastern shires.\n\nThe Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England has records in England of a Thorfinn of Austwick, (listed as 'Torfin' and 'Turfin') who held over forty holdings in the Domesday of 1066 (see image, right), and Thorfynn mac Thore who was granted land in Cumbria by Gospatric Earl of Northumbria in the 11th century.\n\nSimilarly, the People of Medieval Scotland database has 6 records of men named Thorfinn from 1093-1371.\n\nReaney and Wilson* derive the surname Turpin from Thorfinn, via the Latinised forms Torphinus/Turp(h)inus citing several examples of the name in use, including Turfinus filius Torfini in the 1130 Yorkshire Pipe Roll; Turpinus in the 1180 Hampshire Pipe Roll; Torphinus in the 1196 Yorkshire Pipe Roll; and Thorpinus filius Simonis in the 1230 Devonshire Pipe Roll.\n\nThe Latinised form Turpinus seems to have been influenced by the Latin turpis \"base,\" a name adopted by early Christians as a token of humility.\n\nThe surname Turpin was used in Britain from at least the 12th century, though Reaney and Wilson point out that Thorfinn is found in Normandy where the earliest examples of Turpin occur.\n\nThough there are some records to be found in Scandinavia for Thorfinn/Torfinn in the Early Modern Period, including the feminine form Thorfinna, records in Britain are sparse, though a Turfin Adams baptised in 1560 in Kent, and Turvin Hodges in 1700 in Middlesex suggest that it held on scantly in modernised English forms. As with most surnames, Turpin can also be found as a first name during this period.\n\nThorfinn, however, has seen a small revival in the 20th century, with majority of registrations for the name coming from Orkney.\n\nRegistration records for Thorfinn as a first name in Scotland and England and Wales:\n\nScotland England & Wales 1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s: 0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n1 births\n\n0 births\n\n3 births\n\n1 birth\n\n0 births\n\n4 births\n\n2 births\n\n1 birth\n\n6 births 0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n1 birth\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n1 birth\n\nSince 1996, Thorfinn has not ranked at all in the official data for England and Wales. The data only includes names of three or more in any given year, however, so Thorfinn's uncommon use is masked. There was certainly one Thorfinn registered in 2001 and one in 2002 in England, and several more boys registered with Thorfinn as a middle name.\n\nIn Scotland, however, Thorfinn has seen consistent use, especially in Orkney.\n\nIt has seen a gradual rise in use, from #472 (1 birth) in 1974 to #380 (3 births) in 1995 and #417 (4 births) in 2003.\n\nAt it's peak year in 2013 (#466 with 6 births), Thorfinn appears in the Scottish regional data at joint #2 in the Orkney islands, alongside Jack and Robbie which all had 4 births.\n\nIn 2017, Thorfinn ranked #602 with 4 births in Scotland.\n\nRose is the common English name for the rose flower, a flower which has been of symbolic importance for millennia. The name for the rose derives directly from the Latin name for the flower, rosa, which most likely ultimately derives from the Persian root *vrda- \"rose flower.\"\n\nThe rose has been the sacred symbol of many important goddesses associated with love, such as Ishtar, Aphrodite, Isis and Venus. It was later used as such for the Virgin Mary under the titles Rosa Munda \"pure rose,\" Rosa Mundi \"rose of the world,\" Rosa Mystica \"the mystical rose\" and Rosa d'Abril \"April rose.\"\n\nVictorian floriography continued this association, and the rose was used to symbolise \"love.\"\n\nLong before Rose was adopted as a given name in honour of the flower in Britain it was already in use as an Anglicised form of the Norman name Roheis (also found as Rohais, Rohese and Roese). These names, in turn, were Latinised as Rohesia, Roesia and Roesa and later became Royce and Rose.\n\nBy the 13th century, Rose was the most common form of Roheis — by which time it was associated and conflated with the flower — while Rosa was the Latin form most commonly found in records.\n\nLike Rosalind and Rosamund, Roheis may derive from hros \"horse.\" However, a more likely possibility is that it derives from the Old Germanic name Hrodohaidis, derived from hrod \"fame\" and heit \"sort, kind, type.\" The are a few examples of the name in early Frankish nobility including Ruodhaid (775–810), abbess of Faremoutiers, and a daughter of the great king Charlemagne.\n\nThe move from Hrodohaidis to Rohesia and eventually to Rose, with the gradually dropping of the harder consonants, is mirrored in the similar Germanic name Adalheidis (adal \"noble\" and heit \"sort\"):\n\nHrodoheidis > Rohesia > Rose\n\nAdalheidis > Adelisa > Alice\n\nOther Germanic names starting with hrod are plentiful: Hrodebert (Robert), Hroderich (Roderick), Hrodgar (Roger), Hrodland (Roland), Hrodulf (Rolf) and Hrotsuitha (Roswitha) to name a few.\n\nAs a variant of Roheis, examples of Rose in British records date back to at least the 13th century and even led to the surname Rose.\n\nAccording to George Redmond's survey of 1000 names from ten English counties 1377-81, Rose ranked at #30 meaning it was moderately used.\n\nIt continued in this usage right up until the 18th century. Rose appears in thirteen out of sixteen decades in Smith Bannister's rank of top 50 names from 1538 to 1700 in England:\n\n1538-49: #39; 1550-9: #28; 1560-9: #40; 1570-9: #35; 1580-9: #42; 1590-9: #45; 1600-9: #37; 1610-9: #50; 1640-9: #32; 1650-9: #33; 1660-9: #47; 1680-9: #36; 1690-1700: #27.\n\nData from the 1881 census lists 78,139 women with the name Rose, giving it an overall rank (male and female names combined) of #65.\n\nThe distribution of the name was largely situated in the South of England, particularly in Bedfordshire and the Isle of White.\n\nDuring the 19th century, a multitude of Ros- names were in use. The most popular were Rose, Rosa, Rosina, Rosanna and Rosetta, but Rosamund, Rosalie, Rosabella, Rosaline and Rosalind were also in use.\n\nRose peaked in 1900 and only left the top 100 after 1934, around the time that Rosemary was taking its place.\n\nRecords for Rose (and variant Ros- names) as a first name in the England and Wales Birth Index:\n\nRose Rosa Rosina Rosanna Rosetta Rosemary 1840:\n\n1850:\n\n1860:\n\n1870:\n\n1880:\n\n1890:\n\n1900:\n\n1904:\n\n1914:\n\n1924:\n\n1934:\n\n1944:\n\n1954:\n\n1964: #65\n\n#52\n\n#49\n\n#32\n\n#26\n\n#23\n\n#27\n\n#29\n\n#30\n\n#44\n\n#64\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n#75\n\n#60\n\n#54\n\n#43\n\n#52\n\n#73\n\n#91\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n#68\n\n#68\n\n#60\n\n#62\n\n#61\n\n#70\n\n#83\n\n#84\n\n#89\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n#71\n\n#78\n\n#65\n\n#84\n\n#104\n\n#137\n\n#195\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n#77\n\n#85\n\n#83\n\n#86\n\n#105\n\n#115\n\n#142\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n#97\n\n#42\n\n#36\n\n#43\n\n#95\n\nIn the 20th century, Rose had declined drastically by the 1960s, only to rise again in the 1990s.\n\n1900 1925 1935 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 152 88 38 14 12 14 4 4 2 4 - 24\n\nData by Leslie Dunkling; per 10,000 births in England and Wales.\n\nFrom 1996, Rose has been steadily rising in England and Wales. Some of this may have been influenced by the huge film hit Titanic (1997) in which Kate Winslet starred as the character Rose DeWitt Bukater.\n\nIn 1996, Rose ranked #181 with 244 births.\n\nIt first reached the top 100 in 2007 at #95 (576 births) after which it steadily progressed.\n\nIn 2017, Rose ranked #60 in England and Wales with 932 births.\n\nIn Scotland, Rose ranked #65 with 69 births in 2017.\n\nAccording to Reaney and Wilson*, \"Hudde was very common,\" and they show several examples of how it was well used as a pet-name, or possibly even a vernacular form.\n\nFor example, the Curia Rolls of Yorkshire in 1212 has the entry Hugo filius Johannis and Johannes pater ipsius Hudde; the 1219 Yorkshire Assize Rolls records a Hugo Sturdy who is later listed as Hudde Sturdi on the 1230 Yorkshire Pipe Rolls.\n\nReaney and Wilson also point to some evidence that it was also used as a pet-form of Richard, citing the 1346 Calendar of the Close Rolls with the entry \"Ricardus dictus Hudde de Walkden\".\n\nAs it was used as a pet-form of Hugh or Richard, it is very difficult to ascertain how common Hudd was. However, in George Redmond's survey of 1000 names from ten English counties 1377-81, Richard ranks at #4 and Hugh at #11, showing they were both in popular use.\n\nHudd itself developed the diminutive forms Huddel and Huddlin. The surname Hudson itself dates from at least the 14th century.\n\nEnglish explorer and navigator Henry Hudson (c.1570-1611) is one of the most famous early bearers of the surname. His discovery of major North American landmarks is the reason he is the namesake of numerous geographical features, including the Hudson Straight, the Hudson Bay and the Hudson River.\n\nAs with almost all English surnames, Hudson began to be adopted as a given name from the 17th century. Its early use was generally to honour a godparent or a family member, especially if it was the mother's maiden name.\n\nAccording to the 1881 UK census, Hudson was the 137th most common surname, and was especially common in the north of England -- especially West Yorkshire. Unsurprisingly, the highest concentration of Hudson as a given name matches up to the areas of the highest concentration as a surname.\n\nRecords for Hudson as a first name in the England and Wales Birth Index:\n\n1840s:\n\n1850s:\n\n1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s: 69 births\n\n70 births\n\n72 birth\n\n84 births\n\n71 births\n\n49 births\n\n36 births\n\n28 births\n\n22 births\n\n8 births\n\n9 births\n\n9 births\n\n16 births\n\n19 births\n\nFrom 1996 to 2005, Hudson had no more than 20 births in any given year in England and Wales, putting it firmly below the top 1000. It rose from #885 (27 births) in 2006 to #538 (58 births) in 2007 and has been steadily rising ever since.\n\nIn Scotland, too, Hudson began to rise after 2006, going from #1059 (1 births) in 2007 to #544 (4 births) in 2011 and #268 (16 births) in 2014.\n\nIn 2017, Hudson ranked #135 with 442 births in England and Wales, and #199 with 27 births in Scotland.\n\nWhen we look at England and Wales individually, Hudson ranked at #136 (404 births) in England in 2017, but broke into the Welsh top 100 for the first time at #83 (38 births).\n\nThough it is synonymous with the last reigning queen of Egypt, Cleopatra was a common name in the ancient world. The Lexicon of Greek Personal Names has 180 entries of the name in classical records.\n\nThe only full-sibling of Alexander the Great was Cleopatra of Macedonia (354 BC–308 BC), Macedonian princess and later queen regent of Epirus. Alexander and Cleopatra both also had a step-mother named Cleopatra as well.\n\nAmong the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, Cleopatra was a favourite, dating from the marriage of Cleopatra of Syra to Ptolemy V of Egypt, who acted and regent of Egypt (Cleopatra I) for her son Ptolemy VI. The famous Cleopatra ruled as Cleopatra VII.\n\nAs Cleo started out as a short form of Cleopatra, it can be very difficult to ascertain its early usage. Cleopatra can be found in very small numbers from the 16th century, such as Cleopatra Ruch, born in 1530 in Switzerland, and there are a few British examples in the 17th century. A girl named Cleo Burton was baptised in 1649 in Shropshire, but it is not clear if this was used as an independent name, as shortening names in church records wasn't uncommon in the 17th century.\n\nThanks to its classical roots and romantic associations – promoted by Shakespeare's tragic portrayal of Cleopatra in his play Antony and Cleopatra (1606) – Cleopatra came into moderate use in the 18th century, particularly in the south of England and in and around London.\n\nCharles Dickens used the name Cleopatra as the affectionate name for Mrs Skewton in his 1846-48 novel Dombey and Son.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Cleo saw increasing use as an independent name, eventually superseding Cleopatra. The brief spike in the name Cleo in the 1910s and 1920s may have had something to do with Hollywood silent film actresses Cleo Madison (1883–1964) and Cleo Ridgely (1893–1962).\n\nRecords for Cleopatra and Cleo as a first name in the England and Wales Birth Index:\n\nCleopatra Cleo 1840s:\n\n1850s:\n\n1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s: 14 births\n\n5 births\n\n11 births\n\n31 births\n\n21 births\n\n14 births\n\n8 births\n\n17 births\n\n15 births\n\n5 births\n\n7 births\n\n5 births\n\n23 births\n\n26 births\n\n1 birth\n\n0 births\n\n0 births\n\n2 births\n\n6 births\n\n4 births\n\n7 births\n\n21 births\n\n16 births\n\n13 births\n\n13 births\n\n17 births\n\n75 births\n\n202 births\n\nBy 1996, Cleo ranked #671 (35 births) in England and Wales. It intermittently rose over the following decade, reaching #475 (84 births) in 2008.\n\nThen, from 2014 to 2015, Cleo doubled in use going from #403 with 108 births to #242 with 206 births.\n\nIt has continued to rise since, and, in 2017, reached #187 with 285 births in England and Wales.\n\nIn Scotland, too, Cleo has also on the rise intermittently since 1998. In 2016, Cleo ranked #383 with 9 births and increased to #247 with 17 births in 2017 in Scotland.\n\nClan Brodie is an old one in Scotland, though much of their early records were destroyed when Brodie Castle was burned down in 1645. It is thought that they have Pictish ancestry, especially given the evidence of Pictish settlements in Moray.\n\nLike most surnames, Brodie began to get used as a given name in the 18th century, usually as an adoption of a family surname or godparent's surname.\n\nAs we would expect, it was most commonly used in Scotland, and data from the 1881 UK census shows that both the surname and given name match up in usage, seeing the highest concentration in Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\n\nFor the most part, this use as a given name represents Brodie being used as a middle name, generally because it was the mother's maiden name.\n\nFor the most part, Brodie was masculine in use as a given name, but there are a handful of records for girls.\n\nUsage in Scotland\n\nRecords for Brodie as a first name in the Scotland's statutory birth records:\n\n1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s: 12 births\n\n11 births\n\n16 births\n\n11 births\n\n12 births\n\n9 births\n\n15 births\n\n4 births\n\n4 births\n\n9 births\n\nThe spelling Brody was only registered once as a first name, in 1871.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Brodie remained uncommon, but it began to see a rise in the late 1990s and seeing a marked rise after 2001.\n\nBrodie first entered the top 100 for boys in Scotland in 2005 at #95 (64 births) and reached the top 50 in 2013. It peaked in 2015 at #31 with 193 births and, in 2017, ranked #32 with 170 births.\n\nThe spelling Brody has always been less common in Scotland, not ranking at all as a first name until the early 1990s. It, too, saw a steep rise from 2005, peaking at #96 (73 births) in 2014 -- the only time it has been in the top 100.\n\nIn 2017, Brody ranked #144 (40 births) in Scotland.\n\nBoth Brodie and Brody have also been used for girls in Scotland, though in smaller numbers. Brodie managed to reach a peak of #183 (25 births) in 2005 -- the same year that Brody peaked for boys and Brodie reached the top 100 for the first time.\n\nIn 2017, Brodie ranked #570 with 5 births while Brody was not registered.\n\nUsage in England and Wales\n\nRecords for Brodie as a first name in the England and Wales Birth Index:\n\n1840s:\n\n1850s:\n\n1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s: 3 births\n\n0 births\n\n1 birth\n\n2 births\n\n5 births\n\n9 births\n\n5 births\n\n0 births\n\n7 births\n\n2 births\n\n8 births\n\n5 births\n\n8 births\n\n25 births\n\nBrodie was rare as a given in England and Wales in the 19th century and Brody was completely unused. Brodie only became more established in the 1970s, and so too, the spelling Brody also saw some use.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2007, both Brodie and Brody were used in small but growing numbers. Brodie was the most common spelling, ranking between #500-#300 while Brody was less common.\n\nThis changed after 2007 (when they both ranked #458 jointly) after which time Brody took over in England and Wales as the dominant spelling.\n\nBoth Brody and Brodie have continued to rise ever since, and in 2017, Brodie ranked #222 with 240 births, and Brody ranked #151 with 380 births in England and Wales.\n\nAs in Scotland, Brodie/Brody has also seen some usage for girls. Brodie is the most common spelling for girls in E&W, peaking at #367 (93 births) in 2002. Brody is rarer, and has never been above the top 1000. It peaked in 2004 at #1383. Both spellings have declined for girls since their peak.\n\nIn 2017, Brodie ranked #1628 with 19 births, and Brody ranked #4763 with 4 births in England and Wales.\n\nElsewhere\n\nLong before it reached the top 100 in its native Scotland, Brodie was a hit in Australia from the early 1990s.\n\nBrodie reached #79 in 1994 in Australia and then ranked in the top 100 from 1994 till 2000. It dipped below the top 100 twice, returning for one year in 2003 (at #83) and again from 2006 to 2008.\n\nSimilarly, Brody ranked in the Canadian top 100 from 2004 to 2014, peaking at #61 in 2008.\n\nCatching on a little later, in America, Brody reached the top 100 first in 2008 when it jumped from #105 to #70. It has since seen a decline to #152.\n\nCora is the Latinised form of the Greek name Kore — literally meaning \"maiden, daughter,\" — an alternate name of the Spring Goddess Persephone.\n\nPersephone was referred to by the name Kore specifically in reference to her role as the goddess of spring's bounty and as the daughter of Demeter, the mother goddess of agriculture. As wife of Hades, the Queen of the Underworld, she took her other name, Persephone, as the protectress in the after-life.\n\nKore was one of the chthonic gods of Greek religion — her dwelling was the earth rather than the ouranic (sky) gods who dwelt on Mount Olympus. As such, her cult was closely associated with agriculture, the earth, and afterlife, and is certainly pre-Greek, likely very ancient. Alongside Demeter, Kore was worshipped in the ancient Eleusinian Mysteries, one of the most important, sacred religious rites of ancient Greece —reenacted for thousands of years — which promised initiates happiness in the afterlife.\n\nAccording to her most famous legend, Kore was once playing in a meadow with her nymph companions when Hades carried her off in his chariot to the underworld to be his bride. Her mother Demeter despaired, searching the world for her daughter, and was furious to find out that Zeus had conspired with his brother Hades. In retribution, Demeter refused to let the earth fruit until her daughter returned.\n\nFaced with perpetual winter and famine, Zeus agreed to Kore's return and forced Hades to agree. A reluctant Hades capitulated, but, because Kore had eaten pomegranate seeds in the underworld, she was bound to the underworld for eternity. In compromise, it was agreed that she would spend half the year with her mother (as Kore), and the other half in the underworld (as Persephone). When she was with her mother, the flowers would bloom (Spring/Summer), and when she left for the underworld, her mother would morn (Autumn/Winter).\n\nAlternatively, another theory is that the myth represents the time when the Greeks stored their grain underground for part of the year in order to protect it from summer heat. The seeds were sown in the autumn and quickly germinated to grow throughout the winter time. During summer months, Kore, the grain-maiden, was in the underground (Hades' realm) where she was fused with Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld. At the beginning of Autumn, when the seeds of the old crop and the new were laid on the fields, she ascended and was reunited with her mother Demeter (the old and the new crop meeting). In this version, Kore's rise to the upperworld happens in Autumn/Winter rather than Spring/Summer, which matches up to the Eleusinian Mysteries which were celebrated in September.\n\nMama Cora Ocllo is also the name of the Incan fertility and Mother Goddess. The asteroid, 504 Cora, was named after the Incan goddess in 1905.\n\nCorah is also a surname. It is a habitational Scottish surname from a, now lost, village.\n\nCora didn't see proper use as a given name until the late 18th century when it appeared in literature and opera. In some cases, it may have been influenced by Corinna which was a popular literary favourite earlier in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nEtienne Mehul used the name for his 1791 opera Alonzo and Cora, and James Fenimore Cooper used it for his main female character in his best-selling novel The Last of the Mohicans (1826).\n\nCora gradually began to rise in use in England and Wales over the course of the 19th century. In a few early cases, it is recorded as Corah, which perhaps represents the surname in use as a given name, or could simply be a spelling variant. By the end of the century, Coral, Coralie and Coraline also grew in usage.\n\nDespite its growing use, it continually ranked below the top 200, ranking #230 in 1860, #250 in 1870, #251 in 1880, #290 in 1890 and #220 in 1900.\n\nThe name peaked at the turn of the century and was overtaken by Coral by the 1930s.\n\nRecords for Cora as a first name in the England and Wales Birth Index:\n\n1840s:\n\n1850s:\n\n1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s: 42 births\n\n105 births\n\n165 births\n\n338 births\n\n432 births\n\n754 births\n\n1188 births\n\n1172 births\n\n876 births\n\n442 births\n\n274 births\n\n200 births\n\n154 births\n\n174 births\n\nUp until 2012, Cora ranked below the top 400 in England and Wales but has been on a steady rise since.\n\nBy 2014, it reached the top 300, putting it on a par with its late 19th century ranks.\n\nIn 2017, Cora rose even further to #209 with 251 births in England and Wales.\n\nFrom September 2010 to November 2015, ITV aired six series of period drama Downton Abbey. The matriarch of the family, Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham, was a principle character and featured in every series. In 2011, the fantasy series Once Upon a Time also had a character named Cora (2011-15), as did the soap Eastenders in the same year.\n\nIn Scotland, Cora has also been rising in recent years to even greater success.\n\nUp until 2008, Cora had no more than 10 births in any given year. It began rising after 2008, reaching the top 200 in 2011 at #181 (25 births).\n\nIt saw a brief dip to #254 (16 births) in 2013, but has recovered since.\n\nIts peak so far in Scotland was in 2016 when it ranked #103 (45 births).\n\nIn 2017, Cora ranked #129 with 37 births in Scotland.\n\nOne of the most notable saints to bear the name was an Irish missionary bishop in the 7th century. Legend has it that he left Ireland with eleven companions and travelled to Würzburg (modern northern Bavaria). There he converted the pagan Frankish Duke, Gozbert and many of local inhabitants but got into trouble when he objected to the Duke having married his brother's widow. Upon the outraged duchess's orders, he was beheaded and quickly became one of Germany's principle saints.\n\nAcross Europe, he is most commonly called Saint Kilian (or Killian), though the preferred spelling in Ireland itself is Cillian.\n\nThanks to the saint's prominence, Kilian can be found in Germany from at least the 16th century.\n\nUsage in Ireland\n\nBoth Cilléne/Cillíne and Cellach were borne by several early Irish saints, and both names are recorded in use several times in the 8th and 9th century in the Irish Annals.**\n\nBoth Cillian and Killian have had regular use in Ireland in the 20th century.\n\nBy 1964, Killian ranked #204 with 5 births, intermittently rising gradually over the following decades. Killian reached the Irish top 100 at #98 in 1988 and remained in the top 100 until 2016 -- peaking at #55 (121 births) in 2001.\n\nThe spelling Cillian was later to catch on, not ranking until 1970, but it too, swiftly rose in popularity, reaching the top 100 for the first time in 1992 at #84. By 2003, Cillian took over as the dominant spelling when it ranked #60 and Killian ranked #67. Since then, Cillian has continued to rise, ranking in the top 30 since 2006.\n\nCillian's rise as the dominant spelling coincides with the career of Irish actor Cillian Murphy, whose Hollywood career began in 2002. He landed the lead role in 28 Days Later (2002) and starring in blockbuster films Batman Begins (2005), Red Eye (2005) and Inception (2010). Since 2013, he has played the lead role in the hugely successful BBC television series Peaky Blinders.\n\nIn 2017, Cillian ranked #16 (302 births) and Killian ranked #106 (62 births) in Ireland.\n\nUsage in Britain\n\nDespite it's common use in neighbouring Ireland, Cillian was little used in Britain until the 20th century – even in fellow Gaelic Scotland.\n\nThe spelling Kilian (like the saint) has some rare usage in England in the 19th century -- it was registered once in 1867, 1872 and 1875 -- but Cillian and Killian were not registered at all until 1965 and 1942 respectively.\n\nIn Scotland, Killian was used as a middle name once in 1869 but wasn't used again until 1925, and until 1955 as a first name. Cillian wasn't registered in Scotland as a first name until 1973.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nUnlike in Ireland where Killian and Cillian have been in good use since the 80s, Cillian's rise in neighbouring Northern Ireland directly coincides with Cillian Murphy's career.\n\nBoth Cillian and Killian ranked below the top 150 in NI from 1997 until 2005. Killian has continued to do so, whereas Cillian started rising, reaching the top 100 at #79 (40 births) in 2007 and continuing to #15 (109 births) in 2017.\n\nEngland and Wales\n\nCillian and Killian have both seen rare in England and Wales from the 1970s onwards. From 1996 to 2006, both spellings ranked below the top 1000.\n\nCillian moved into the top 1000 in 2007 at #782 (34 births)\n\nAs with the rest of Britain, Cillian's rise in usage matches Cillian Murphy's fame -- especially since the airing of the first series of Peaky Blinders in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Cillian jumped up to #550 (66 births) and has been rising since. Killian moved up into the top 1000 for the first time in 2016 at #712 (48 births).\n\nIn 2017, Cillian ranked #324 (151 births) and Killian ranked #628 (57 births).\n\nScotland\n\nIn Scotland, too, Cillian was in rare use up until the late 2000s. It was only registered once in 1983, 1992, 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2005. However, from 2006, it began to be used more regularly, reaching the top 500 in 2009. By 2014, Cillian ranked #276 (15 births) and continued to rise to #204 (25 births) in 2017.\n\nWorld Wide\n\nThanks to Saint Kilian, the name has had some usage across Europe. It has been particularly notable in recent years.\n\nIn Germany, Kilian is a modern staple, having ranked in the top 100 since the turn of the century. In 2017, it ranked #75.\n\nKilian has been in the Austrian top 100 since 2001, and currently ranks at #56.\n\nSimilarly, in Switzerland, Kilian was a top 100 name from 1998-2004 and 2010-2017. It currently ranks at #77 in Catalonia, too.\n\nIn France, Killian was in the top 100 from 1997 to 2009, peaking at #43 in 2002 and 2003.\n\nIt has since been superseded by the spelling Kylian (made famous by footballers Kylian Hazard and Kylian Mbappe) which entered the French top 100 in 2001, peaked at #41 in 2008 and 2009, and currently ranks at #73.\n\nThe Lexicon of Greek Personal Names has record of two instances of the name Lyra/Lura (Λύρα) used in Antiquity alongside other rare names such as Luragia/Lyragia, Lurakos/Lyrakos, Luranias/Lyranias, Lurimachos/Lyrimachos, Luris/Lyris and Lur/Lyr.\n\nIt was not an established name, and these two examples perhaps indicate a nickname -- perhaps for a musician.\n\nThe Greek letter upsilon (υ) can either be transcribed as a u or y in English, thanks to its having been filtered through Latin, hence the two spellings of Lyra and Lura. The letter was pronounced like oo in early Greek and was later shortened to the French-style u. The spelling Lyra, however, especially with regards to the constellation, has been standard in English since at least the mid-17th century.\n\nAs a given name, Lyra dates from the 19th century in Britain. It was always rare, but does appear to have been almost exclusively female in use. HMS Lyra is the name of four ships of the Royal Navy, named in 1808, 1821, 1857 and 1910, and may have given some exposure to the name. 1857 is the only year that Lyra was used from 1850-1872, and there were three Lyras registered in 1910.\n\nRecords for Lyra as a first name in the England and Wales Birth Index:\n\n1840s:\n\n1850s:\n\n1860s:\n\n1870s:\n\n1880s:\n\n1890s:\n\n1900s:\n\n1910s:\n\n1920s:\n\n1930s:\n\n1940s:\n\n1950s:\n\n1960s:\n\n1970s:\n\n1980s: 2 births\n\n1 birth\n\n0 births\n\n4 births\n\n1 birth\n\n1 birth\n\n5 births\n\n6 births\n\n1 birth\n\n3 births\n\n2 births\n\n1 birth\n\n4 births\n\n6 births\n\n1 birth\n\nLyra only seen regular usage as a given name in the last two decades.\n\nThis usage was kick-started by the author Philip Pullman when he used the name for the main character in His Dark Materials trilogy (1995-2000). It has continued to rise thanks to its being short, having two syllables and punchy vowel sounds.\n\nLyra Belacqua is Philip Pullman's plucky young heroine in his award-winning trilogy. The first novel, Northern Lights, was first published in 1995 and was followed by The Subtle Knife in 1997 and The Amber Spyglass in 2000. It was after the publication of the final book, that Lyra began to rise in earnest in England and Wales.\n\nPullman followed up the series with Lyra's Oxford in 2003 and she also features in Pullman's latest trilogy, The Book of Dust, the first book of which was published in 2017.\n\nThe series was adapted by the London Royal National Theatre in 2003-04 and New Line Cinema released a film adaptation of Northern Lights, named The Golden Compass (after the US title of the book) in 2007.\n\nLyra entered the top 1000 in England and Wales in 2005 at #790 (36 births) and rose to #510 (76 births) by 2008 and had doubled in use the following year at #304 (152 births) in 2009.\n\nIn 2017, Lyra ranked #183 with 293 births in England and Wales.\n\nIn Scotland, Lyra did not rank at all until 2003, when it was registered once. Since then, it has also been on the rise, reaching its first peak in 2013 at #344 (11 births), falling slightly to #413 (8 births) by 2016 in Scotland, followed by a huge leap to #178 (26 births) in 2017."
