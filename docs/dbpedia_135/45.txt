Qualified human and material resources are available to undertake specialist work including facilities for working with category three microbiological agents. Our laboratories are equipped with state of the art equipment to handle all types of biological agents at the traditional and molecular microbiology level, as well as chemical analysis of bio-toxins and other molecules. Advance resources in modern epidemiological tracing and bioinformatics are readily available. Laboratory facilities exist for advance work in cell culture and cellular immunology and diverse pathology and histopathological techniques. The Institute has a media production unit that supplies needed reagents for diagnostics and research internally and externally.
