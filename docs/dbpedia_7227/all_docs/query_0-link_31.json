        "text": "The cost of building Apple Park\n\nThe tech giant reportedly spent $5 billion on Apple Park construction. The ring is a stunning feat of design that blurs the indoor space with the environment outside, which has been landscaped with fruit trees (including apple trees, of course) and other native plants.\n\nThe building features incredible four-story curved glass windows, solar panels on the roof, and natural ventilation that reduces the need for heat/air conditioning.\n\nThe campus is also specially engineered to withstand earthquakes â€” its foundation sits on hundreds of movable steel saucers rather than being actually attached to the Earth, a design called \"base isolation\" technology.\n\nIs it possible to visit Apple Park?\n\nApple Park is typically accessible only to employees, save for two areas: a visitor center at 10600 N Tantau Ave., and the Steve Jobs Theater, where Apple events are held to announce new products.\n\nThe Steve Jobs Theater is named for the company's legendary co-founder Steve Jobs and can accommodate up to 1,000 people.\n\nThe visitor center is the only place the public is allowed on the campus without a pass, and it's free to enter. You can buy exclusive Apple merch there. There are Apple Park T-shirts and other accessories you can't get anywhere else.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe visitors center is an Apple store, but there's a lot to do there, including an AR experience, exclusive merchandise, and a cafe. Don't miss the Apple Park augmented reality experience, which lets you peek into the campus through an iPad. There is no Genius Bar or repairs available at the Apple Park visitor's center, though.\n\nIf you need a pick-me-up, there's a cafe in the visitor's center with snacks and coffee. On a weekday morning, you might see Apple employees taking meetings in the sunny cafe, the WiFi is fast and reliable, and the menu is on an iPad.\n\nIt's easy to miss the upstairs roof deck, but it's the highlight of the visitor's center. Look for the Jony Ive-designed stairs. Once you're on the roof, you get the closest view of Apple Park available to the public.\n\nWhat is the capacity of Apple Park?\n\nApple Park features nearly 3 million square feet of office space and can accommodate about 12,000 Apple employees. That's a bit less than half of Apple's Bay Area workforce.\n\nWho would get to work at Apple Park was a point of contention among the company's local employees. Executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and chief design officer Jony Ive, moved to the new campus, as well as software development teams and design teams.\n\nIs Apple Park bigger than the Pentagon?\n\nAn interesting rumor emerged after the plan to build Apple Park was originally announced in 2011: Apple Park would be bigger than the Pentagon, the headquarters of the US military in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nHowever, at 2.8 million square feet, it's significantly smaller than the Pentagon, which measures 6.5 million square feet.\n\nKif Leswing contributed to an earlier version of this article."
