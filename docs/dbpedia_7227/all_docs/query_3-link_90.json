        "text": "Introduction Project planning helps in the need to state measures required to complete a project within a set period. The process involves clear steps, and resources designated, which are essential in the implementation process. Project planning Purpose Apple Technology Plan will contain the project description that includes the goals and objectives of the project. Also, the plan will aid a contract that provides for the following persons: Sponsor of the Project, Manager of the Project, Steering Committee, Team that will make up the Project, and other associated project personnel. Background information Apple is a multinational technology company situated in America, headquartered in Cupertino, California. The company activities, according to Marier-Bienvenue, Pellerin, and Cassivi (2017, pp.692-698), includes developing, designing and selling electronics, computer software, and online services to consumers. Choosing Artificial Intelligence (AI) as my project plan was not an easy task. I am more concerned about the safety of workers at Apple Company as well as others all over the world. To achieve this, implementing the solution is critical. Other factors I have considered include how information can be shared and coordinated efficiently within the organization. The staff, too, should be able to perform their jobs efficiently without any disturbances. Getting all this information and coming up with the project indicates I have done critical research and evaluated the key ones suitable for safety in the organizations."
