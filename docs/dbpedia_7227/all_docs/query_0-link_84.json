        "text": "Apple Park | The corporate headquarters of Apple Inc.\n\nThe building is powered by 100% renewable energy including a 14 megawatt rooftop solar installation and 4 megawatts of biogas fuel cells, which serve more than 1000 electric vehicle charging stations in addition to the campus buildings.\n\nOver 80 percent of the campus is open space with more than 9000 drought-tolerant trees. Recycled water is expected to replace over 30 million gallons of potable water used for irrigation, toilet flushing and cooling.\n\nThis is one of the worldâ€™s largest naturally ventilated buildings, featuring louvers integrated into the building facade that bring in fresh outdoor air year-round, to provide healthy air to building occupants while saving energy."
