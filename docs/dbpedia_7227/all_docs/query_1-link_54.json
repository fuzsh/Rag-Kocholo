        "text": "This page only shows primary logo variants.\n\nFor other related logos and images, see:\n\n1976–1977 1977–1999; 2021 1977–1998 (secondary); 1998–present (primary)\n\nApple Inc. is a multinational technology company based in Cupertino, California. They specialize in consumer electronics, ranging from products from desktop, smartphones, laptops, tablets, wireless headphones, smart watches, and most recently virtual reality headsets. Apple is the second-largest company by market capitalization, having a peak value of US$3.081 trillion in December 2023.\n\nApple Computer Company\n\n1976–1977\n\nDesigner: Ronald Wayne\n\nTypography: Custom\n\nLaunched: April 1, 1976\n\nThe first Apple Computer logo, drawn by co-founder Ronald Wayne, depicts Isaac Newton under an apple tree. The border reads: \"Newton — A Mind Forever Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought — Alone.\"\n\nApple Computer, Inc./Apple, Inc.\n\n1977–present\n\n1977-1999; 2021\n\nDesigner: Rob Janoff of\n\nRegis McKenna\n\nTypography: Motter Tektura (1977-1984)\n\nITC Garamond (1984-2002)\n\nLaunched: April 1977\n\nCreated by Rob Janoff, the now-iconic rainbow Apple logo was used from April 1977 until August 26, 1999. According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Since the logo's introduction, the design itself has remained unchanged. This logo is still referenced in various advertisements, and was briefly brought back in 2021 in an advertisement for the iMac M1.\n\n“One of the deep mysteries to me is our logo, the symbol of lust and knowledge, bitten into, all crossed with the colors of the rainbow in the wrong order. You couldn't dream a more appropriate logo: lust, knowledge, hope and anarchy.”\n\n— Jean-Louis Gassée, former executive at Apple\n\n1977–1998 (secondary); 1998–present (primary)\n\nDesigner: Rob Janoff\n\nTypography: ITC Garamond (1984–2002)\n\nMyriad (2002–2017)\n\nSan Francisco (2017–present)\n\nLaunched: August 15, 1998\n\nIn 1998, coinciding with the iMac G3's release, Apple ditched the rainbow color scheme in favor of this single color version, which had previously been used as an alternate variant of the original 1977 logo, including on packaging. It has become one of the most recognizable logos in the world, partly due to Apple's global influence and presence.\n\nOfficial website\n\n◄ NeXT\n\nApple"
