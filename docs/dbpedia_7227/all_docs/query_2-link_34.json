        "text": "As of 2015, Apple Computer is in the midst of building a headquarters, on a Cupertino site previously occupied by Hewlett-Packard. This will allow Apple to consolidate employees currently working in dozens of facilities around Silicon Valley.\n\nFor now, however, the Apple flagship is located at 1 Infinity Way. When you visit Apple HQ, be sure to stop by the Apple Company Store!\n\nApple was a pioneer in the early development of personal computers; the Apple II was a mainstay in the classroom.\n\nIn 1984, Apple released the Macintosh. Although it drew heavily on ideas pioneered at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), the Mac was the first commercially available computer to employ the desktop metaphor and graphic user interface that have now become standard on computers.\n\nSince 2007, Apple has become one of the worldâ€™s leading suppliers of mobile computing devices, including MP3 players, smartphones, and tablets.\n\nDetails\n\n1 Infinite Loop\n\nCupertino, CA 95014\n\nFounded April, 1976\n\n110,000 employees (as of 2015)"
