        "text": "California Privacy Rights\n\nCalifornia consumers have a right to knowledge, access, correction, and deletion of their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act. California consumers also have a right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information by a business, and a right not to be discriminated against for exercising their California privacy rights. Apple does not sell or share the personal information of California consumers as those terms are defined under California law, and does not discriminate in response to privacy rights requests. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit according to California law.\n\nApple provides notice of our privacy practices in our Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy includes what personal information is collected, the source of the personal information, and the purposes of use, as well as whether Apple discloses that personal information and if so, the categories of third parties to whom it is disclosed. More information about how Apple handles personal information in connection with specific Apple services is presented in service-specific notices at or before your first use of the service and is available at all times on your Apple device or at apple.com/legal/privacy/data. To view a copy of the latest versions of the service-specific privacy notices and the California-specific disclosures, visit California Privacy Disclosures.\n\nCalifornia consumers with an Apple account can exercise their rights directly or through an authorized agent by signing in to their Apple account at privacy.apple.com. If you are a California consumer without an Apple account and you or your authorized agent would like to exercise your privacy rights, you can make a request to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact, or by calling 1-800-275-2273. If you do not have an Apple account, Apple will ask you for information that we consider necessary to verify your identity for security and to prevent fraud. This information may include name, contact information, and information related to your transaction or relationship with Apple, but the specific information requested may differ depending on the circumstances of your request. If we delete your personal information, we will both render certain personal information about you permanently unrecoverable and also deidentify certain personal information.\n\nDo Not Track\n\nApple does not track its customers over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Third parties that have content embedded on Apple’s websites such as a social feature or a stock ticker may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific Apple website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personal information from Apple’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.\n\nNotice for Minors"
