        "text": "Introduction\n\nWith building designs and infrastructure, it is important to provide both a safe space and sensory stimulation. It’s no doubt that stepping into Apple stores and offices creates an environment that enhances revolutionary concepts and technical developments which we see continuously produced by Apple.\n\nAlongside this, the design choices integrated into these offices help to chain Apple offices together into a technological network of innovation and inspiration for users and employees.\n\nCupertino, CA: Apple Park\n\nOne Apple Park Way in Cupertino, California is the location of Apple’s HQ office and its world-renowned Apple Park.\n\nDesigned by British architect Norman Foster alongside Steve Jobs and previous chief design officer, Jonathan Ive, Apple Park has become the hub driving Apple into the future. The “ring” structure, also known as the “spaceship” was designed to create a seamless whole for continued creativity, innovation and wellbeing. This was Norman Foster’s first Apple project which catalysed the designing of many Apple stores to follow. The ring was not the initial design construct for the Apple Park but this was formed after iterations of planning and identifying the resolution between concentration and team space.\n\nThe Apple Park campus consists of: the Ring Building, Steve Jobs Theatre, Fitness & Wellness Centre, Visitors’ Centre and South Parking. The entire Apple Park campus is encompassed by flowing parkland that enhances the buildings as places to socialise, exercise and work.\n\nAng Mo Kio, Singapore: Ang Mo Kio to Marina Bay Sands\n\nSingapore serves as Apple’s base for its Asia-Pacific operations. The major Apple offices in Singapore is located in Ang Mo Kio and is a recognised centre of innovation and expertise as the country embraces a high-tech vision for the future.\n\nOne of Apple’s most visually stunning retail stores is also found in Singapore. The Apple Marina Bay Sands (MBS) opened last September and is one of Apple’s most visually stunning stores. In collaboration with Fosters + Partners under Norman Foster who also designed Apple Park, the Marina Bay Sands provides glare control and reduces the area of exposed glazing, lowering the energy required to cool the space. The transparent glazing at store level allows visitors to have a direct connection with the outdoors, gradually transitioning to darker panels at higher levels to reduce solar gain.\n\nSet within leather-topped planters, they also provide comfortable places to sit and enjoy the ambiance of the store and the fantastic views of the marina, especially the famous water show. Apple and Singapore's evolution since the 1980s has been \"remarkable\". With the new MBS store, the tech giant wanted to live up to the expectation of that continuing development.\n\nApple also has offices in the Innovis tower in the Fusionopolis Two development at 2 Fusionopolis Way, in Singapore's Queenstown area.\n\nLondon, UK: Battersea Power Station\n\nThe historic Battersea Power Station which has been refurbished by architects, WilkinsonEyre is one of the largest brick buildings in Europe and is set to occupy the new Apple offices in London.\n\nBattersea Power Station is a decommissioned coal-fired power station in South West London, regarded as an iconic landmark in London owing to its Art Deco fittings. Its surrounding area has undergone a \"painstaking\" restoration process in recent years to develop a modern and contemporary shopping mall, food halls, offices and residential living.\n\nApple will be the largest office tenant occupying approximately 500,000 sqft. across 6 floors of the central Boiler House inside the historic icon. It said that 1,400 Apple employees from eight locations around London will consolidate the new UK office space.\n\nThe Apple offices within the power station will be designed by Fosters + Partners so workspaces are currently being developed to maximise opportunities for collaboration as well as employee wellness.\n\nAccording to Apple, the bricks will be hand-fired at the same quarry in Gloucestershire where the power station's original bricks were made more than 70 years ago. These are among the design decisions made by preservation specialists such as English Heritage to ensure the design is sensitive to the existing architecture."
