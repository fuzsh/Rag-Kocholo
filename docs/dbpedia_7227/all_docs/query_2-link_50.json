        "text": "The Apple Company Store, also known as The Company Store and now known as Apple Infinite Loop, was an Apple retail location at the 1 Infinite Loop campus. It predates the 2001 founding the of the Apple retail store chain and was the only part of the campus that is open to visitors. On September 19, 2015, it was re-opened as Apple's 462nd retail store and was internally identified as R052.[1][2] By the time it was permanently closed on January 20, 2024, it has since moved up to become the 450th oldest as 12 other preceding stores had closed over the years.[3]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Company Store was located just to the right of the main entrance of the former Apple headquarters. It was first opened on March 13, 1993, soon after completion of construction of the campus by the Sobrato Organization. It originally sold only Apple-branded merchandise, collectibles, and related accessories. Apple employees could get a discount on items sold inside the store.[4]\n\nApple soon began marketing its Macintosh Performa consumer line and Newton mobile products at the Company Store.[5][6]\n\nBy May 2000, the Company Store was drastically redesigned to reflect the aesthetic tastes of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. In 2015, it was renovated to present a full retail experience and now also sells the Mac and iOS product lines.[7] In 2017, its role in providing tourists with unique Apple merchandise was assumed by the nearby Apple Park Visitor Center.[8]\n\nPermanently closure[]\n\nOn December 21, 2023, it was announced that Apple Infinite Loop will be permanently closing on January 20, 2024, along with one other store in Hawaii, after almost 31 years of operation. In a statement, Apple said in part, \"After many years of serving customers at our stores in the Bay Area, we plan to close our store at Infinite Loop. All of our valued team members will have the opportunity to continue their roles with Apple. We look forward to welcoming our customers at our nearby Apple Park Visitor Center and other locations, on Apple.com, and the Apple Store app.\"[9][10]\n\nThe doors closed permanently on January 20, 2024, at 6 PM. The closure happened before Apple Vision Pro was released to the public.[11]\n\nMap[]\n\nLoading map...\n\n{\"type\":\"ROADMAP\",\"minzoom\":false,\"maxzoom\":false,\"types\":[\"ROADMAP\",\"SATELLITE\",\"HYBRID\",\"TERRAIN\"],\"mappingservice\":\"googlemaps3\",\"width\":\"auto\",\"height\":\"350px\",\"centre\":false,\"title\":\"\",\"label\":\"\",\"icon\":\"\",\"lines\":[],\"polygons\":[],\"circles\":[],\"rectangles\":[],\"copycoords\":false,\"static\":false,\"visitedicon\":\"\",\"wmsoverlay\":false,\"zoom\":14,\"layers\":[],\"controls\":[\"pan\",\"zoom\",\"type\",\"scale\",\"streetview\",\"rotate\"],\"zoomstyle\":\"DEFAULT\",\"typestyle\":\"DEFAULT\",\"autoinfowindows\":false,\"resizable\":false,\"kmlrezoom\":false,\"poi\":true,\"cluster\":false,\"clustergridsize\":60,\"clustermaxzoom\":20,\"clusterzoomonclick\":true,\"clusteraveragecenter\":true,\"clusterminsize\":2,\"imageoverlays\":[],\"kml\":[],\"gkml\":[],\"searchmarkers\":\"\",\"fullscreen\":false,\"scrollwheelzoom\":false,\"locations\":[{\"text\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"link\":\"\",\"lat\":37.3326452,\"lon\":-122.02992302100607,\"icon\":\"\"}]}\n\nReferences[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nAppleDesigns, an early brand merchandising department at Apple Computer.\n\n[]\n\nApple Infinite Loop at Apple (archived 2024-01-20)\n\nThe Company Store (archived 2008-07-26, 2005-07-31, 2004-08-14, 2002-06-10, 2001-10-05)\n\nApple Company Store (archived 1997-07-15)\n\nThe Company Store at MacRumors\n\nThe Company Store at Apple Headquarters at Silicon Valley Guide\n\nApple Company Store at Visit San Jose\n\nApple Store: Apple Company Store at Wikipedia\n\nArticles[]"
