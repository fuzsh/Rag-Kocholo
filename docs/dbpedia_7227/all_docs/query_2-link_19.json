        "text": "After Jobs died in 2011, current Apple CEO Tim Cook has said his legendary predecessor's office at 1 Infinite Loop remained locked and untouched.\n\nIn 2018, the company moved its headquarters to Apple Park, a massive, futuristic campus that cost $5 billion to build. The main building is a giant, multi-story circle, colloquially known as \"the ring\" or \"the spaceship.\"\n\nApple Park is a mere mile away from the Infinite Loop campus.\n\nApple's headquarters is largely closed to the public\n\nApple Park is typically accessible only to Apple employees, save for two areas: a visitors center and the Steve Jobs Theater, where Apple events are staged to announce new products. The Steve Jobs Theater can accommodate up to 1,000 people.\n\nWhile most Apple operations occur at Apple Park, the company still owns and uses the Infinite Loop campus.\n\nOther Apple headquarters in the US and abroad\n\nApple is currently building out offices in Austin, San Diego, Miami, Seattle, and Los Angeles, as well as building or planning to build data centers across the country.\n\nRelated stories\n\nApple also has international offices, including Singapore, London, and Munich, according to the company.\n\nWhen did Apple move its headquarters to Ireland?\n\nApple's European headquarters is located in the suburbs of Cork, Ireland, on the island's south end. The location is a deviation from other major tech companies like Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook, which are headquartered in the capital city of Dublin.\n\nApple's Irish headquarters employs over 6,000 people of more than 90 nationalities. In addition to its offices, the campus is home to a fitness center, basketball court, four Caffe Macs espresso bars, on-site medical providers, and more.\n\nWhy is Apple moving from China?\n\nApple currently has an office in Shanghai, and its major manufacturing hub is in Zhengzhou, China."
