Apple's product family includes the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod digital music player, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Music Store, the Xserve G5 server, and Xserve RAID storage products. The company's products are sold online, through third-party wholesalers, and through its own chain of stores. Apple owns approximately 125 retail stores in the United States, as well as stores in Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom.\n\nORIGINS\n\nApple was founded in April 1976 by Steve Wozniak, then 26 years old, and Steve Jobs, 21, both college dropouts. Their partnership began several years earlier when Wozniak, a talented, self-taught electronics engineer, began building boxes that allowed him to make long-distance phone calls for free. The pair sold several hundred such boxes.\n\nIn 1976 Wozniak was working on another box, the Apple I computer, without keyboard or power supply, for a computer hobbyist club. Jobs and Wozniak sold their most valuable possessions, a van and two calculators, raising $1,300 with which to start a company. A local retailer ordered 50 of the computers, which were built in Jobs's garage. They eventually sold 200 to computer hobbyists in the San Francisco Bay area for $666 each. Later that summer, Wozniak began work on the Apple II, designed to appeal to a greater market than computer hobbyists. Jobs hired local computer enthusiasts, many of them still in high school, to assemble circuit boards and design software. Early microcomputers had usually been housed in metal boxes. With the general consumer in mind, Jobs planned to house the Apple II in a more attractive modular beige plastic container.\n\nJobs wanted to create a large company and consulted with Mike Markkula, a retired electronics engineer who had managed marketing for Intel Corporation and Fairchild Semiconductor. Chairman Markkula bought one-third of the company for $250,000, helped Jobs with the business plan, and in 1977 hired Mike Scott as president. Wozniak worked for Apple full time in his engineering capacity.\n\nJobs recruited Regis McKenna, owner of one of the most successful advertising and public relations firms in Silicon Valley, to devise an advertising strategy for the company. McKenna designed the Apple logo and began advertising personal computers in consumer magazines. Apple's professional marketing team placed the Apple II in retail stores, and by June 1977, annual sales reached $1 million. It was the first microcomputer to use color graphics, with a television set as the screen. In addition, the Apple II expansion slot made it more versatile than competing computers.\n\nThe earliest Apple IIs read and stored information on cassette tapes, which were unreliable and slow. By 1978 Wozniak had invented the Apple Disk II, at the time the fastest and cheapest disk drive offered by any computer manufacturer. The Disk II made possible the development of software for the Apple II. The introduction of Apple II, with a user manual, at a consumer electronics show signaled that Apple was expanding beyond the hobbyist market to make its computers consumer items. By the end of 1978, Apple was one of the fastest-growing companies in the United States, with its products carried by over 100 dealers.\n\nIn 1979 Apple introduced the Apple II+ with far more memory than the Apple II and an easier startup system, and the Silentype, the company's first printer. VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet for microcomputers, was also released that year. Its popularity helped to sell many Apple IIs. By the end of the year sales were up 400 percent from 1978, at over 35,000 computers. Apple Fortran, introduced in March 1980, led to the further development of software, particularly technical and educational applications.\n\nIn December 1980, Apple went public. Its offering of 4.6 million shares at $22 each sold out within minutes. A second offering of 2.6 million shares quickly sold out in May 1981.\n\nMeanwhile Apple was working on the Apple II's successor, which was intended to feature expanded memory and graphics capabilities and run the software already designed for the Apple II. The company, fearful that the Apple II would soon be outdated, put time pressures on the designers of the Apple III, despite the fact that sales of the Apple II more than doubled to 78,000 in 1980. The Apple III was well received when it was released in September 1980 at $3,495, and many predicted it would achieve its goal of breaking into the office market dominated by IBM. However, the Apple III was released without adequate testing, and many units proved to be defective. Production was halted and the problems were fixed, but the Apple III never sold as well as the Apple II. It was discontinued in April 1984.\n\nThe problems with the Apple III prompted Mike Scott to lay off employees in February 1981, a move with which Jobs disagreed. As a result, Mike Markkula became president and Jobs chairman. Scott was named vice-chairman shortly before leaving the firm.\n\nDespite the problems with Apple III, the company forged ahead, tripling its 1981 research and development budget to $21 million, releasing 40 new software programs, opening European offices, and putting out its first hard disk. By January 1982, 650,000 Apple computers had been sold worldwide. In December 1982, Apple became the first personal computer company to reach $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nThe next year, Apple lost its position as chief supplier of personal computers in Europe to IBM, and tried to challenge IBM in the business market with the Lisa computer. Lisa introduced the mouse, a hand-controlled pointer, and displayed pictures on the computer screen that substituted for keyboard commands. These innovations came out of Jobs's determination to design an unintimidating computer that anyone could use.\n\nCOMPANY PERSPECTIVES\n\nThe company is committed to bringing the best personal computing and music experience to students, educators, creative professionals, businesses, government agencies, and consumers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The company's business strategy leverages its unique ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design.\n\nUnfortunately, the Lisa did not sell as well as Apple had hoped. Apple was having difficulty designing the elaborate software to link together a number of Lisas and was finding it hard to break IBM's hold on the business market. Apple's earnings went down and its stock plummeted to $35, half of its sale price in 1982. Mike Markkula had viewed his presidency as a temporary position, and in April 1983, Jobs brought in John Sculley, formerly president of Pepsi-Cola, as the new president of Apple. Jobs felt the company needed Sculley's marketing expertise.\n\n1984 DEBUT OF THE MACINTOSH\n\nThe production division for Lisa had been vying with Jobs's Macintosh division. The Macintosh personal computer offered Lisa's innovations at a fraction of the price. Jobs saw the Macintosh as the \"people's computer,\" designed for people with little technical knowledge. With the failure of the Lisa, the Macintosh was seen as the future of the company. Launched with a television commercial in January 1984, the Macintosh was unveiled soon after, with a price tag of $2,495 and a new 3-inch disk drive that was faster than the 5 1/4-inch drives used in other machines, including the Apple II.\n\nApple sold 70,000 Macintosh computers in the first 100 days. In September 1984 a new Macintosh was released with more memory and two disk drives. Jobs was convinced that anyone who tried the Macintosh would buy it. A national advertisement offered people the chance to take a Macintosh home for 24 hours, and over 200,000 people did so. At the same time, Apple sold its two millionth Apple II. Over the next six months Apple released numerous products for the Macintosh, including a laser printer and a hard drive.\n\nDespite these successes, Macintosh sales temporarily fell off after a promising start, and the company was troubled by internal problems. Infighting between divisions continued, and poor inventory tracking led to overproduction. Although originally a strong supporter of Sculley, Jobs eventually decided to oust the executive; Jobs, however, lost the ensuing showdown. Sculley reorganized Apple in June 1985 to end the infighting caused by the product-line divisions, and Jobs, along with several other Apple executives, left the company in September. They founded a new computer company, NeXT Incorporated, which would later emerge as a rival to Apple in the business computer market.\n\nThe Macintosh personal computer finally moved Apple into the business office market. Corporations saw its ease of use as a distinct advantage. It was far cheaper than the Lisa and had the necessary software to link office computers. In 1986 and 1987 Apple produced three new Macintosh personal computers with improved memory and power. By 1988, over one million Macintosh computers had been sold, with 70 percent of sales to corporations. Software was created that allowed the Macintosh to be connected to IBM-based systems. Apple grew rapidly; income for 1988 topped $400 million on sales of $4.07 billion, up from income of $217 million on sales of $1.9 billion in 1986. Apple had 5,500 employees in 1986 and over 14,600 by the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1988, Apple management had expected a worldwide shortage of memory chips to worsen. They bought millions when prices were high, only to have the shortage end and prices fall soon after. Apple ordered sharp price increases for the Macintosh line just before the Christmas buying season, and consumers bought the less expensive Apple line or other brands. In early 1989, Apple released significantly enhanced versions of the two upper-end Macintosh computers, the SE and the Macintosh II, primarily to compete for the office market. At the same time IBM marketed a new operating system that mimicked the Macintosh's ease of use. In May 1989 Apple announced plans for its new operating system, System 7, which would be available to users the next year and allow Macintoshes to run tasks on more than one program simultaneously.\n\nKEY DATES\n\n1976:\n\nWith $1,300, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak found Apple Computer, Inc.\n\n1980:\n\nApple converts to public ownership.\n\n1982:\n\nApple becomes the first personal computer company to reach $1 billion in annual sales.\n\n1985:\n\nJohn Sculley assumes the helm after a management shakeup that causes the departure of Jobs and several other Apple executives.\n\n1991:\n\nPowerBook line of notebook computers is released.\n\n1994:\n\nPower Macintosh line is released.\n\n1996:\n\nAcquisition of NeXT brings Steve Jobs back to Apple as a special advisor.\n\n1997:\n\nSteve Jobs is named interim chief executive officer.\n\n1998:\n\nThe all-in-one iMac is released.\n\n2000:\n\nJobs, firmly in command as CEO, oversees a leaner, more tightly focused Apple.\n\n2001:\n\nThe iPod is released; Apple opens its first retail store in Virginia.\n\n2003:\n\nApple opens its first store in Japan.\n\n2005:\n\nThe release of a video iPod, the fifth generation of the device, pushes total iPod unit sales to 30 million.\n\nApple was reorganized in August 1988 into four operating divisions: Apple USA, Apple Europe, Apple Pacific, and Apple Products. Dissatisfied with the changes, many longtime Apple executives left. In July 1990, Robert Puette, former head of Hewlett-Packard's personal computer business, became head of the Apple USA division. Sculley saw the reorganization as an at-tempt to create fewer layers of management within Apple, thus encouraging innovation among staff. Analysts credit Sculley with expanding Apple from a consumer and education computer company to a business computer company, one of the biggest and fastest-growing corporations in the United States.\n\nCompetition in the industry of information technology involved Apple in a number of lawsuits. In December 1989 for instance, the Xerox Corporation, in a $150 million lawsuit, charged Apple with unlawfully using Xerox technology for the Macintosh software. Apple did not deny borrowing from Xerox technology but explained that the company had spent millions to refine that technology and had used other sources as well. In 1990 the court found in favor of Apple in the Xerox case. Earlier, in March 1988, Apple had brought suits against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, charging copyright infringement. Four years later, in the spring of 1992, Apple's case was dealt a severe blow in a surprise ruling: copyright protection cannot be based on \"look and feel\" (appearance) alone; rather, \"specific\" features of an original program must be detailed by developers for protection.\n\nMISMANAGEMENT, CRIPPLING AN INDUSTRY GIANT: 1990S\n\nApple entered the 1990s well aware that the conditions that made the company an industry giant in the previous decade had changed dramatically. Management recognized that for Apple to succeed in the future, corporate strategies would have to be reexamined. Apple had soared through the 1980s on the backs of its large, expensive computers, which earned the company a committed, yet relatively small following. Sculley and his team saw that competitors were relying increasingly on the user-friendly graphics that had become the Macintosh signature and recognized that Apple needed to introduce smaller, cheaper models, such as the Classic and LC, which were instant hits. At a time when the industry was seeing slow unit sales, the numbers at Apple were skyrocketing. In 1990, desktop Macs accounted for 11 percent of the PCs sold through U.S. computer dealers. In mid-1992, the figure was 19 percent.\n\nBut these modestly priced models had a considerably smaller profit margin than their larger cousins. So even if sales took off, as they did, profits were threatened. In a severe austerity move, Apple laid off nearly 10 percent of its workforce, consolidated facilities, moved production plants to areas where it was cheaper to operate, and drastically altered its corporate organizational chart. The bill for such forward-looking surgery was great, however, and in 1991 profits were off 35 percent. But analysts said that such pitfalls were expected, indeed necessary, if the company intended to position itself as a leaner, better-conditioned fighter in the years ahead.\n\nLooking ahead is what analysts say saved Apple from foundering. In 1992, after the core of the suit that Apple had brought against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard was dismissed, industry observers pointed out that although the loss was a disappointment for Apple, the company wisely had not banked on a victory. They credited Apple's ambitious plans for the future with quickly turning the lawsuit into yesterday's news.\n\nIn addition to remaining faithful to its central business of computer making (the notebook PowerBook series, released in 1991, garnered a 21 percent market share in less than six months), Apple intended to ride a digital wave into the next century. The company geared itself to participate in a revolution in the consumer electronics industry, in which products that were limited by a slow, restrictive analog system would be replaced by faster, digital gadgets on the cutting edge of telecommunications technology. Apple also experimented with the interweaving of sound and visuals in the operations of its computers.\n\nFor Apple, the most pressing issue of the 1990s was not related to technology, but concerned capable and consistent management. The company endured tortuous failures throughout much of the decade, as one chief executive officer after another faltered miserably. Scully was forced out of his leadership position by Apple's board of directors in 1993. His replacement, Michael Spindler, broke tradition by licensing Apple technology to outside firms, paving the way for ill-fated Apple clones that ultimately eroded Apple's profits. Spindler also oversaw the introduction of the Power Macintosh line in 1994, an episode in Apple's history that typified the perception that the company had the right products but not the right people to deliver the products to the market. Power Macintosh computers were highly sought after, but after overestimating demand for the earlier release of its PowerBook laptops, the company grossly underestimated demand for the Power Macintosh line. By 1995, Apple had $1 billion worth of unfilled orders, and investors took note of the embarrassing miscue. In a two-day period, Apple's stock value plunged 15 percent.\n\nAfter Spindler's much publicized mistake of 1995, Apple's directors were ready to hand the leadership reins to someone new. Gil Amelio, credited with spearheading the recovery of National Semiconductor, was named chief executive officer in February 1996, beginning another notorious era of leadership for the beleaguered Cupertino company. Amelio cut Apple's payroll by a third and slashed operating costs, but drew a hail of criticism for his compensation package and his inability to relate to Apple's unique corporate culture. Apple's financial losses, meanwhile, mounted, reaching $816 million in 1996 and a staggering $1 billion in 1997. The company's stock, which had traded at more than $70 per share in 1991, fell to $14 per share. Its market share, 16 percent in the late 1980s, stood at less than 4 percent. Fortune magazine offered its analysis, referring to Apple in its March 3, 1997 issue as \"Silicon Valley's paragon of dysfunctional management.\"\n\nAmelio was ousted from the company in July 1997, but before his departure a significant deal was concluded that brought Apple's savior to Cupertino. In December 1996, Apple paid $377 million for NeXT, a small, $50-million-in-sales company founded and led by Steve Jobs. Concurrent with the acquisition, Amelio hired Jobs as his special advisor, marking the return of Apple's visionary 12 years after he had left. In September 1997, two months after Amelio's exit, Apple's board of directors named Jobs interim chief executive officer. Apple's recovery occurred during the ensuing months.\n\nJobs assumed his responsibilities with the same passion and understanding that had made Apple one of the greatest success stories in business history. He immediately discontinued the licensing agreement that spawned Apple clones. He eliminated 15 of the company's 19 products, withdrawing Apple's involvement in making printers, scanners, portable digital assistants, and other peripherals. From 1997 forward, Apple would focus exclusively on desktop and portable Macintoshes for professional and consumer customers. Jobs closed plants, laid off thousands of workers, and sold stock to rival Microsoft Corporation, receiving a cash infusion of $150 million in exchange. Apple's organizational hierarchy underwent sweeping reorganization as well, but the most visible indication of Jobs's return was unveiled in August 1998. Distressed by his company's lack of popular computers that retailed for less than $2,000, Jobs tapped Apple's resources and, ten months after the project began, unveiled the massively successful iMAC, a sleek and colorful computer that embodied Apple's skill in design and functionality.\n\nBecause of Jobs's restorative efforts, Apple exited the 1990s as a pared-down version of its former self, but, importantly, a profitable company once again. Annual sales, which totaled $11.5 billion in 1995, stood at $5.9 billion in 1998, from which the company recorded a profit of $309 million. In 1999, sales grew a modest 3.2 percent, but the newfound health of the company was evident in a 94 percent gain in net income, as Apple's profits swelled to $601 million. Further, Apple's stock mustered a remarkable rebound, climbing 140 percent to $99 per share in 1999. By the decade's end, \"interim\" was dropped from Jobs's corporate title, signaling Jobs's return on a permanent basis and fueling optimism that Apple could look forward to a decade of vibrant and consistent growth.\n\n2001: IPOD, CATALYST TO GROWTH\n\nApple's turnaround was confirmed in the first years of the 21st century, as the company strode toward its 30th anniversary exuding an unprecedented degree of strength. At the heart of the company's surging growth was a digital music player branded as iPod. Introduced in late 2001, the device featured five gigabytes (GB) of storage, enabling the user to store approximately 1,000 songs on a player that was smaller than a deck of playing cards. Retailing for $399, the iPod represented another example of Apple's skill in designing an elegant and functional product, a product that became one of the most sought after consumer electronics items during the first half of the decade. Succeeding generations of iPods hit the market and scored resounding success, driving the company's financial growth. A 10 GB model was introduced in mid-2002, followed by the iPod Mini, iPod Shuffle, and iPod Nano, together representing a massive new source of revenue for the company. The fifth generation of the iPod debuted in 2005, a device available in a 30 GB or 60 GB model that was capable of storing and playing video files. By the time the video iPod arrived in stores, Apple derived roughly 35 percent of its revenue from iPods. Between 2001 and 2005, thanks primarily to the popularity of iPods, the company's sales nearly tripled, increasing from $5.3 billion to $13.9 billion. Apple controlled more than 75 percent of the $2.5 billion digital audio player market in the United States.\n\nAs the company enjoyed escalating sales midway through the decade, it also celebrated the success of a new dimension to its business. In 2001, the company opened its first retail outlet, a 6,000-square-foot store located in Tysons Corner, Virginia, that became the first unit of a chain of Apple-owned stores. By 2005, the company operated nearly 125 stores in the United States and a handful of stores in Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom. With an expanding retail arm devoted to highlighting an impressively popular selection of products, Apple approached its 30th anniversary in a stronger position than ever before in its history. In the years ahead, the company's well-established ability to develop singular products for the digital marketplace promised to deliver impressive growth and excite the interests of consumers worldwide.\n\nScott Lewis\n\nUpdated, Jeffrey L.

By the end of the year sales were up 400 percent from 1978, at over 35,000 computers. Apple Fortran, introduced in March of 1980, led to the further development of software, particularly technical and educational applications.\n\nIn December of 1980, Apple went public. Its offering of 4.6 million shares at $22 each sold out within minutes. A second offering of 2.6 million shares quickly sold out in May of 1981.\n\nMeanwhile Apple was working on the Apple II’s successor, which was intended to feature expanded memory and graphics capabilities and be able to run the software already designed for the Apple II. The company, fearful that the Apple II would soon be outdated, put time pressures on the designers of the Apple III, despite the fact that sales of the Apple II more than doubled to 78,000 in 1980. The Apple III was well received when it was released in September of 1980 at $3,495, and many predicted it would achieve its goal of breaking into the office market dominated by IBM. However, the Apple III was released without adequate testing, and many proved to be defective. Production was halted and the problems were fixed, but the Apple III never sold as well as the Apple II. It was discontinued in April of 1984.\n\nThe problems with the Apple III prompted Mike Scott to lay off employees in February of 1981, a move with which Jobs disagreed. As a result, Mike Markkula became president and Jobs chairman. Scott was named vice-chairman shortly before leaving the firm.\n\nDespite the problems with Apple III, the company forged ahead, tripling its 1981 research and development budget to $21 million, releasing 40 new software programs, opening European offices, and putting out its first hard disk. By January of 1982, 650,000 Apple computers had been sold worldwide. In December of 1982, Apple became the first personal computer company to reach $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nThe next year, Apple lost its position as chief supplier of personal computers in Europe to IBM, and tried to challenge IBM in the business market with the Lisa computer. Lisa introduced the mouse, a hand-controlled pointer, and displayed pictures on the computer screen that substituted for keyboard commands. These innovations come out of Jobs’s determination to design an unintimidating computer that anyone could use.\n\nUnfortunately, the Lisa did not sell as well as Apple had hoped. Apple was having difficulty designing the elaborate software to link together a number of Lisas and was finding it hard to break IBM’s hold on the business market. Apple’s earnings went down and its stock plummeted to $35, half of its sale price in 1982. Mike Markkula had viewed his presidency as a temporary position, and in April of 1983, Jobs brought in John Sculley, formerly president of Pepsi-Cola, as the new president of Apple. Jobs felt the company needed Sculley’s marketing expertise.\n\nThe production division for Lisa had been vying with Jobs’s Macintosh division. The Macintosh personal computer offered Lisa’s innovations at a fraction of the price. Jobs saw the Macintosh as the “people’s computer”—designed for people with little technical knowledge. With the failure of the Lisa, the Macintosh was seen as the future of the company. Launched with a television commercial in January of 1984, the Macintosh was unveiled soon after, with a price tag of $2,495 and a new 3 1/2-inch disk drive that was faster than the 5 1/4-inch drives used in other machines, including the Apple II.\n\nApple sold 70,000 Macintosh computers in the first 100 days. In September of 1984 a new Macintosh was released with more memory and two disk drives. Jobs was convinced that anyone who tried the Macintosh would buy it. A national advertisement offered people the chance to take a Macintosh home for 24 hours, and over 200,000 people did so. At the same time, Apple sold its two millionth Apple II. Over the next six months Apple released numerous products for the Macintosh, including a laser printer and a hard drive.\n\nDespite these successes, Macintosh sales temporarily fell off after a promising start, and the company was troubled by internal problems. Infighting between divisions continued, and poor inventory tracking led to overproduction. Although Jobs had originally been a strong supporter of Sculley, Jobs eventually decided to oust Sculley; Jobs, however, lost the ensuing showdown. Sculley reorganized Apple in June of 1985 to end the infighting caused by the product-line divisions, and Jobs, along with several other Apple executives, left the company in September. They founded a new computer company, Next Incorporated, which would later emerge as a rival to Apple in the business computer market.\n\nThe Macintosh personal computer finally moved Apple into the business office market. Corporations saw its ease of use as a distinct advantage. It was far cheaper than the Lisa and had the necessary software to link office computers. In 1986 and 1987 Apple produced three new Macintosh personal computers with improved memory and power. Apple and the Microsoft Corporation produced sophisticated software. By 1988, over one million Macintosh computers had been sold, with 70 percent of sales to corporations. Software was created that allowed the Macintosh to be connected to IBM-based systems. Apple grew rapidly; income for 1988 topped $400 million on sales of $4.07 billion, up from income of $217 million on sales of $1.9 billion in 1986. Apple had 5,500 employees in 1986 and over 14,600 by the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1988, Apple management had expected a worldwide shortage of memory chips to worsen. They bought millions when prices were high, only to have the shortage end and prices fall soon after. Apple ordered sharp price increases for the Macintosh line just before the Christmas buying season, and consumers bought the less expensive Apple line or other brands. In early 1989, Apple released significantly enhanced versions of the two upper-end Macintosh computers, the SE and the Macintosh II, primarily to compete for the office market. At the same time IBM marketed a new operating system that mimicked the Macintosh’s ease of use. In May of 1989 Apple announced plans for its new operating system, System 7, which would be available to users the next year and allow Macintoshes to run tasks on more than one program simultaneously.\n\nApple was reorganized in August of 1988 into four operating divisions: Apple IIsA, Apple Europe, Apple Pacific, and Apple Products. Dissatisfied with the changes, many longtime Apple executives left. In July of 1990, Robert Puette, former head of Hewlett-Packard’s personal computer business, became head of the Apple IIsA division. Sculley saw the reorganization as an attempt to create fewer layers of management within Apple, thus encouraging innovation among staff. Analysts credit Sculley with expanding Apple from a consumer and education computer company to a business computer company, one of the biggest and fastest-growing corporations in the United States.\n\nCompetition in the industry of information technology has involved Apple in a number of lawsuits. In December of 1989 for instance, the Xerox Corporation, in a $150 million lawsuit, charged Apple with unlawfully using Xerox technology for the Macintosh software. Apple did not deny borrowing from Xerox technology but explained that the company had spent millions to refine that technology and had used other sources as well. In 1990 the court found in favor of Apple in the Xerox case. Earlier, in March of 1988, Apple had brought suits against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, charging copyright infringement. Four years later, in the spring of 1992, Apple’s case was dealt a severe blow in a surprise ruling: copyright protection cannot be based on “look and feel” (appearance) alone; rather, “specific” features of an original program must be detailed by developers for protection.\n\nApple entered the 1990s well aware that the conditions that made the company an industry giant in the previous decade had changed dramatically. Management recognized that for Apple to succeed in the future, corporate strategies would have to be reexamined.\n\nApple had soared through the eighties on the backs of its large, expensive computers, which earned the company a committed, yet relatively small following. Sculley and his team saw that competitors were relying increasingly on the user-friendly graphics that had become the Macintosh signature and recognized that Apple needed to introduce smaller, cheaper models, such as the Classic and LC, which were instant hits. At a time when the industry was seeing slow unit sales, the numbers at Apple were skyrocketing. In 1990, desktop Macs accounted for 11 percent of the PCs sold through American computer dealers. In mid-1992, the figure was 19 percent.\n\nBut these modestly priced models had a considerably smaller profit margin than their larger cousins. So even if sales took off, as they did, profits were threatened. In a severe austerity move, Apple laid off nearly ten percent of its work force, consolidated facilities, moved production plants to areas where it was cheaper to operate, and drastically altered its corporate organizational chart. The bill for such forward-looking surgery was great, however, and in 1991 profits were off 35 percent. But analysts said that such pitfalls were expected, indeed necessary, if the company intended to position itself as a leaner, better-conditioned fighter in the years ahead.\n\nLooking ahead is what analysts say has saved Apple from foundering. In 1992, after the core of the suit that Apple had brought against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard was dismissed, industry observers pointed out that although the loss was a disappointment for Apple, the company wisely had not banked on a victory. They credited Apple’s ambitious plans for the future with quickly turning the lawsuit into yesterday’s news.\n\nIn addition to remaining faithful to its central business of computer making—the notebook PowerBook series, released in 1991, garnered a 21 percent market share in less than six months—Apple intends to ride a digital wave into the next century. The company is geared to participate in a revolution in the consumer electronics industry, in which products that are currently limited by a slow, restrictive analog system will be replaced by faster, digital gadgets that are on the cutting edge of telecommunications technology. Apple is also experimenting with the interweaving of sound and visuals in the operations of its computers.\n\nIn a startling break from the past, the once-secretive Apple has begun forging business relationships with its fiercest competitors. Convinced that it would be too financially risky for Apple alone to embark on a new wave of sophisticated software research, Sculley helped fashion a deal with IBM for the two industry stalwarts to take the plunge hand in hand. It remains to be seen whether these unprecedented alliances, as well as the forays into dazzling new technological arenas, will be as rewarding as the visionary revamping, which, in the early 1990s, saved Apple from stagnancy and potential decline.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries\n\nClaris Corporation; Apple Computer SARL (France); Apple Computer GmbH (Germany); Apple Computer U.K. Limited (England); Apple Computer SPA (Italy); Apple Computer AB (Sweden).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFrieberger, Paul, and Michael Swaine, Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer, Berkeley, California, Osborne-McGraw-Hill, 1984; Hogan, Thorn, “Apple: The First Ten Years,” A + : The #1 Apple II Magazine, September 1987; Rose, Frank, West of Eden, New York, Penguin Books, 1989; Annual Report, 1991, Apple Computer, Cupertino, Calif.; Pollack, Andrew, “Apple Shows Products for Its Macintosh Line,” Time, March 4, 1992; Zachary, G.

The introduction of the Macintosh line of personal computers in 1984 established the company as an innovator in industrial design whose products became renowned for their intuitive ease of use. Though battered by bad decision-making during the 1990s, Apple continues to exude the same enviable characteristics in the 21st century that catapulted the company toward fame during the 1980s. The company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, software, and peripherals, concentrating on lower-cost, uniquely designed computers such as iMAC and Power Macintosh models.\n\nOrigins\n\nApple was founded in April 1976 by Steve Wozniak, then 26 years old, and Steve Jobs, 21, both college dropouts. Their partnership began several years earlier when Wozniak, a talented, self-taught electronics engineer, began building boxes that allowed him to make long-distance phone calls for free. The pair sold several hundred such boxes.\n\nIn 1976 Wozniak was working on another box—the Apple I computer, without keyboard or power supply—for a computer hobbyist club. Jobs and Wozniak sold their most valuable possessions, a van and two calculators, raising $1,300 with which to start a company. A local retailer ordered 50 of the computers, which were built in Jobs’s garage. They eventually sold 200 to computer hobbyists in the San Francisco Bay area for $666 each. Later that summer, Wozniak began work on the Apple II, designed to appeal to a greater market than computer hobbyists. Jobs hired local computer enthusiasts, many of them still in high school, to assemble circuit boards and design software. Early microcomputers had usually been housed in metal boxes. With the general consumer in mind, Jobs planned to house the Apple II in a more attractive modular beige plastic container.\n\nJobs wanted to create a large company and consulted with Mike Markkula, a retired electronics engineer who had man-aged marketing for Intel Corporation and Fairchild Semiconductor. Chairman Markkula bought one-third of the company for $250,000, helped Jobs with the business plan, and in 1977 hired Mike Scott as president. Wozniak worked for Apple full time in his engineering capacity.\n\nJobs recruited Regis McKenna, owner of one of the most successful advertising and public relations firms in Silicon Valley, to devise an advertising strategy for the company. McKenna designed the Apple logo and began advertising personal computers in consumer magazines. Apple’s professional marketing team placed the Apple II in retail stores, and by June 1977, annual sales reached $1 million. It was the first micro-computer to use color graphics, with a television set as the screen. In addition, the Apple II expansion slot made it more versatile than competing computers.\n\nThe earliest Apple Us read and stored information on cassette tapes, which were unreliable and slow. By 1978 Wozniak had invented the Apple Disk II, at the time the fastest and cheapest disk drive offered by any computer manufacturer. The Disk II made possible the development of software for the Apple II. The introduction of Apple II, with a user manual, at a consumer electronics show signaled that Apple was expanding beyond the hobbyist market to make its computers consumer items. By the end of 1978, Apple was one of the fastest-growing companies in the United States, with its products carried by over 100 dealers.\n\nIn 1979 Apple introduced the Apple II+ with far more memory than the Apple II and an easier startup system, and the Silentype, the company’s first printer. VisiCalc, the first spread-sheet for microcomputers, was also released that year. Its popularity helped to sell many Apple Us. By the end of the year sales were up 400 percent from 1978, at over 35,000 computers. Apple Fortran, introduced in March 1980, led to the further development of software, particularly technical and educational applications.\n\nIn December 1980, Apple went public. Its offering of 4.6 million shares at $22 each sold out within minutes. A second offering of 2.6 million shares quickly sold out in May 1981.\n\nMeanwhile Apple was working on the Apple IPs successor, which was intended to feature expanded memory and graphics capabilities and run the software already designed for the Apple II. The company, fearful that the Apple II would soon be outdated, put time pressures on the designers of the Apple III, despite the fact that sales of the Apple II more than doubled to 78,000 in 1980.

With the failure of the Lisa, the Macintosh was seen as the future of the company.

Apple had 5,500 employees in 1986 and over 14,600 by the early 1990s.\n\nCompany Perspectives\n\nApple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh. Apple is committed to bringing the best personal computing experience to students, educators, creative professionals and consumers around the world through its innovative hardware, software and Internet offerings.\n\nIn 1988, Apple management had expected a worldwide shortage of memory chips to worsen. They bought millions when prices were high, only to have the shortage end and prices fall soon after. Apple ordered sharp price increases for the Macintosh line just before the Christmas buying season, and consumers bought the less expensive Apple line or other brands.

Management recognized that for Apple to succeed in the future, corporate strategies would have to be reexamined.\n\nApple had soared through the 1980s on the backs of its large, expensive computers, which earned the company a committed, yet relatively small following.

Apple also experimented with the interweaving of sound and visuals in the operations of its computers.\n\nKey Dates\n\n1976:\n\nWith $1,300, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak found Apple Computer, Inc.\n\n1980:\n\nApple converts to public ownership.\n\n1982:\n\nApple becomes the first personal computer company to reach $1 billion in annual sales.\n\n1985:\n\nJohn Sculley assumes the helm after a management shakeup that causes the departure of Jobs and several other Apple executives.\n\n1991:\n\nPowerBook line of notebook computers is released.\n\n1994:\n\nPower Macintosh line is released.\n\n1996:\n\nAcquisition of NeXT brings Steve Jobs back to Apple as a special advisor.\n\n1997:\n\nSteve Jobs is named interim chief executive officer.\n\n1998:\n\nThe all-in-one iMac is released.\n\n2000:\n\nJobs, now firmly in command as CEO, oversees a leaner, more tightly focused Apple.\n\nFor Apple, the most pressing issue of the 1990s was not related to technology, but concerned capable and consistent management. The company endured tortuous failures throughout much of the decade, as one chief executive officer after another faltered miserably. Scully was forced out of his leadership position by Apple’s board of directors in 1993. His replacement, Michael Spindler, broke tradition by licensing Apple technology to outside firms, paving the way for ill-fated Apple clones that ultimately eroded Apple’s profits. Spindler also oversaw the introduction of the Power Macintosh line in 1994, an episode in Apple’s history that typified the perception that the company had the right products but not the right people to deliver the products to the market. Power Macintosh computers were highly sought after, but after overestimating demand for the earlier release of its PowerBook laptops, the company grossly underestimated demand for the Power Macintosh line. By 1995, Apple had $1 billion worth of unfilled orders, and investors took note of the embarrassing miscue. In a two-day period, Apple’s stock value plunged 15 percent.\n\nAfter Spindler’s much-publicized mistake of 1995, Apple’s directors were ready to hand the leadership reins to someone new. Gil Amelio, credited with spearheading the recovery of National Semiconductor, was named chief executive officer in February 1996, beginning another notorious era of leadership for the beleaguered Cupertino company. Amelio cut Apple’s payroll by a third and slashed operating costs, but drew a hail of criticism for his compensation package and his inability to relate to Apple’s unique corporate culture. Apple’s financial losses, meanwhile, mounted, reaching $816 million in 1996 and a staggering $1 billion in 1997. The company’ stock, which had traded at more than $70 per share in 1991, fell to $14 per share. Its market share, 16 percent in the late 1980s, stood at less than four percent. Fortune magazine offered its analysis, referring to Apple in its March 3, 1997 issue as “Silicon Valley’s paragon of dysfunctional management.”\n\nAmelio was ousted from the company in July 1997, but before his departure a significant deal was concluded that brought Apple’s savior to Cupertino. In December 1996, Apple paid $377 million for NeXT, a small, $50-million-in-sales company founded and led by Steve Jobs. Concurrent with the acquisition, Amelio hired Jobs as his special advisor, marking the return of Apple’s visionary 12 years after he had left. In September 1997, two months after Amelio’s exit, Apple’s board of directors named Jobs interim chief executive officer. Apple’s recovery occurred during the ensuing months.\n\nJobs assumed his responsibilities with the same passion and understanding that had made Apple one of the greatest success stories in business history. He immediately discontinued the licensing agreement that spawned Apple clones. He eliminated 15 of the company’s 19 products, withdrawing Apple’s involvement in making printers, scanners, portable digital assistants, and other peripherals. From 1997 forward, Apple would focus exclusively on desktop and portable Macintoshes for professional and consumer customers. Jobs closed plants, laid off thousands of workers, and sold stock to rival Microsoft Corporation, receiving a cash infusion of $150 million in exchange. Apple’s organizational hierarchy underwent sweeping reorganization as well, but the most visible indication of Jobs’s return was unveiled in August 1998. Distressed by his company’s lack of popular computers that retailed for less than $2,000, Jobs tapped Apple’s resources and, ten months after the project began, unveiled the massively successful iMAC, a sleek and colorful computer that embodied Apple’s skill in design and functionality.\n\nBecause of Jobs’s restorative efforts, Apple exited the 1990s as a pared-down version of its former self, but, importantly, a profitable company once again. Annual sales, which totaled $11.5 billion in 1995, stood at $5.9 billion in 1998, from which the company recorded a profit of $309 million. In 1999, sales grew a modest 3.2 percent, but the newfound health of the company was evident in a 94 percent gain in net income, as Apple’s profits swelled to $601 million. Further, Apples’ stock mustered a remarkable rebound, climbing 140 percent to $99 per share in 1999. By the decade’s end, “interim” was dropped from Jobs’s corporate title, signaling Jobs’s return on a permanent basis and fueling optimism that Apple could look forward to a decade of vibrant and consistent growth.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries\n\nApple Computer, Inc.

Within ten years it was a leader in the personal computer industry with a reputation for innovation and risk-taking.\n\nApple was founded in April 1976 by Steve Wozniak, 26 years old, and Steve Jobs, 21, both college drop-outs. Their partnership began several years earlier when Wozniak, a talented, self-taught electronics engineer, began building boxes that allowed him to make long-distance phone calls free. The pair sold several hundred such boxes.\n\nIn 1976 Wozniak was working on another box, the Apple I computer, without keyboard or power supply, for a computer hobbyist club. Jobs and Wozniak sold their most valuable possessions, a van and two calculators, raising $1,300 with which to start a company. A local retailer ordered 50 of the computers, built in Jobs’s garage. They eventually sold 200 to computer hobbyists in the San Francisco Bay area, for $666 each. Later that summer, Wozniak began work on the Apple II, designed to appeal to a greater market than computer hobbyists. Jobs hired local computer enthusiasts, many of them still in high school, who assembled circuit boards or designed software.\n\nJobs wanted to create a large company and brought in Mike Markkula, a retired electronics engineer who had managed marketing for Intel Corporation and Fairchild Semiconductor. Chairman Markkula bought one-third of the company for $250,000, helped Jobs with the business plan, and in 1977 hired Mike Scott, as president. Wozniak worked for Apple full-time in his engineering capacity. Jobs recruited Regis McKenna, owner of one of the most successful advertising and public relations firms in Silicon Valley. McKenna designed the Apple logo and began advertising personal computers in consumer magazines. Early microcomputers usually had been housed in metal boxes. Jobs housed the Apple II in a more attractive modular beige plastic container. Apple’s professional marketing team placed the Apple II in retail stores, and by June 1977, annual sales reached $1 million. It was the first microcomputer to use color graphics, with a television set as the screen. The Apple II expansion slot made it more versatile than competing computers.\n\nThe earliest Apple IIs read and stored information on cassette tapes, which were unreliable and slow. By 1978 Wozniak had invented the Apple Disk II, at the time the fastest and cheapest disk drive offered by any computer manufacturer. The Disk II made possible the development of software for the Apple II. The introduction of Apple II, with a user manual, at a consumer electronics show signaled that Apple was expanding beyond the hobbyist market to make its computers consumer items. By the end of 1978, Apple was one of the fastest growing companies in the United States, with its products carried by over 300 dealers.\n\nIn 1979 Apple introduced the Apple II +, with far more memory than the Apple II and an easier startup system, and the Silentype, the company’s first printer. VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet for microcomputers, was also released that year. Its popularity sold many Apple IIs. By the end of the year sales were up 400% from 1978, at over 35,000 computers. Apple Fortran, introduced in March 1980, led to the further development of software, particularly technical and educational applications.\n\nIn December 1980, Apple went public. Its offering of 4.6 million shares at $22 each sold out within minutes. A second offering of 2.6 million shares quickly sold out in May 1981.\n\nMeanwhile Apple was working on the Apple II’s successor. It was to have expanded memory and graphics capabilities, and be able to run the software already designed for the Apple II. The company, fearful that the Apple II would soon be outdated, put time pressures on the designers of the Apple III, despite the fact that sales of the Apple II more than doubled to 78,000 in 1980. The Apple III was well received when it was released in September 1980 at $3,495, and many predicted it would achieve its goal of breaking into the IBM-dominated office market. However, many Apple IIIs proved to be defective; Apple had released it without adequate testing. Production was halted and the problems were fixed, but the Apple III never sold as well as the Apple II. It was discontinued in April 1984.\n\nThe problems with the Apple III caused Mike Scott to reduce the number of employees in February 1981, a move with which Jobs disagreed. As a result, Mike Markkula became president and Jobs chairman. Scott was named vice chairman and soon left the firm.\n\nDespite the Apple III, the company forged ahead, tripling its 1981 research-and-development budget to $21 million, releasing 40 new software programs, opening European offices, and putting out its first hard disc. By January 1982, 650,000 Apple computers had been sold worldwide. In December 1982, Apple became the first personal computer company to reach $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nIn 1983 Apple lost its position as chief supplier of personal computers in Europe to International Business Machines (IBM), and tried to challenge IBM in the business market with the Lisa computer. Lisa introduced the mouse, a hand-controlled pointer, and displayed pictures on the computer screen that substituted for keyboard commands. These innovations come out of Job’s determination to design a non-intimidating computer that anyone could use.\n\nUnfortunately, the Lisa did not sell as well as Apple had hoped. Apple was having difficultly designing the elaborate software to link together a number of Lisas, and was finding it hard to break IBM’s hold on the business market. Apple’s earnings went down and its stock plummeted to $35, half of its sale price a year earlier. Mike Markkula had viewed this presidency as a temporary position, and in April 1983, Jobs brought in John Sculley, formerly president of Pepsi-Cola, as the new president of Apple. Jobs felt the company needed Sculley’s marketing expertise.\n\nThe production division for Lisa had been vying with Jobs’s Macintosh division. Macintosh offered Lisa’s innovations at a fraction of the price. Jobs saw the Macintosh as the “people’s computer,” for people who did not understand computers. With the failure of the Lisa, the Macintosh was seen as the future of the company. It was launched with a television commercial in January 1984. The Macintosh itself was unveiled soon after, with a price tag of $2,495 and a new 3½- inch disc drive that was faster than the 5¼-inch drives used everywhere else, including the Apple II. Apple sold 70,000 Macintoshes in the first 100 days. In September a new Macintosh was released with more memory and two disc drives. Jobs was convinced that anyone who tried the Macintosh would buy it. A national advertisement offered people the chance to take a Macintosh home for 24 hours and over 200,000 people did so. At the same time Apple sold its two millionth Apple II. In the next six months Apple released numerous products for the Macintosh, including a laser printer and a hard drive.\n\nDespite these successes, Macintosh sales temporarily fell off after its promising start. The company was troubled by internal problems. Infighting between divisions continued, and poor inventory-tracking led to over-production. Jobs and Scully had initially been inseparable, but Jobs decided to oust Sculley. Jobs lost the ensuing show-down. Sculley reorganized Apple along functional lines in June 1985 to end the infighting caused by the product-line divisions, and Jobs left Apple in September with several other Apple executives. They founded a new computer company, Next Incorporated, which would later emerge as a rival to Apple in the business computer market.\n\nThe Macintosh computer finally moved Apple into the business office. Corporations saw its ease of use as a distinct advantage. It was far cheaper than the Lisa, and had the necessary software to link office computers. In 1986 and 1987 Apple produced three new Macintoshes with improved memory and power. Apple and the Microsoft Corporation produced sophisticated software. By 1988, over one million Macintoshes had been sold, with 70% of sales to corporations. Software was created that allowed Macintoshes to be connected to IBM-based systems. Apple grew rapidly; income for 1988 topped $400 million on sales of $4.07 billion, up from income of $217 million on sales of $1.9 billion in 1986. Apple had 5,500 employees in 1986 and over 11,700 by the beginning of 1989.\n\nIn 1988, Apple management expected a worldwide shortage of memory chips to continue. They bought millions when prices were high, only to have the shortage end and prices fall soon after. Apple ordered sharp price increases for the Macintosh line just before the Christmas buying season, and consumers bought the less expensive Apple line or other brands. In early 1989, Apple released significantly enhanced versions of the two upper-end Macintoshes, the SE and the Macintosh II, primarily to compete for the office market. At the same time IBM marketed a new operating system that mimicked the Macintosh’s ease of use. In May 1989 Apple announced plans for its new operating system, System 7.0, which would allow Macintoshes to run tasks on more than one program simultaneously. System 7.0 was to be available to users in 1990.\n\nApple was reorganized in August 1988 into four operating divisions: Apple USA, Apple Europe, Apple Pacific, and Apple Products. Dissatisfied with the changes, many longtime Apple executives left. In July 1990, Robert Puette, former head of Hewlett-Packard’s personal computer business, became head of the Apple USA division. Sculley saw the reorganization as an attempt to create fewer layers of management between the bottom and top of Apple, thus encouraging innovation. Analysts credit Sculley with expanding Apple from a consumer and education computer company to a business computer company, one of the biggest and fastest-growing corporations in the United States.\n\nCompetition in the industry of information technology has involved Apple in a number of lawsuits. In December 1989, Xerox Corporation, in a $150 million lawsuit, charged Apple with unlawfully using Xerox technology for the Macintosh software. Apple did not deny borrowing from Xerox technology, but explained that the company had spent millions to refine that technology, and had used other sources as well. In 1990 the court found in favor of Apple in the Xerox case. In March 1988, Apple had brought suits against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, charging copyright infringement. These cases were still in process in 1991.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiary\n\nClaris Corporation\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFrieberger, Paul, and Michael Swaine, Fire in the Valley, The Making of the Personal Computer, Berkeley, California, Osborne-McGraw-Hill, 1984; Hogan, Thom, “Apple: The First Ten Years,” A +: The #1 Apple II Magazine, September 1987; Rose, Frank, West of Eden, New York, Penguin Books, 1989.\n\n—Scott Lewis\n\nApple Computer, Inc.\n\nFOUNDED: 1977\n\nContact Information:\n\nheadquarters: 1 infinite loop\n\ncupertino, ca 95014-2084 phone: (408)996-1010 fax: (408)974-2113 toll free: (800)776-2333 url: http://www.apple.com\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nApple Computer is one of the world's leading computer companies. The company designs, builds, and markets computers, peripheral equipment, and software for homes, businesses, educational institutions, and the government. Apple also provides customers with multimedia and connectivity solutions. Apple was a pioneer in the field of personal computers with its easy-to-use, object-based Apple Macintosh—the bulk of Apple's net sales come from the sale of this line. This user-friendly computer interface \"for the rest of us\" has since spawned competitive imitations, namely Microsoft's Windows '95. In 1997, Apple was fighting to recapture users lost to dominant IBM-compatible computers running the Windows operating system.\n\nCOMPANY FINANCES\n\nApple reported second quarter revenues for 1998 (ending March 27, 1998) of $1.4 billion and unit sales of 650,000. The company recorded a quarterly net profit of $55 million. This represented significant improvement over performance for the same quarter in 1997, when Apple recorded a net loss of $708 million. First quarter revenues for fiscal year 1998 (ending December 26, 1997) were $1.6 billion, a net profit of $47 million. Unit sales that quarter were 635,000. Overall net sales for 1997 were $7.1 billion, down from 1996 sales of $9.8 billion. Apple incurred overall net losses of $1.0 billion, compared to a net loss of $816 million in 1996. Of the company's sales, half were earned internationally.\n\nFor the second quarter of 1998, Apple earned earnings per share (EPS) of $.38, about the same as it earned in the first quarter ($.37). The company's stock price in mid-1998 was around $28.00 per share. Its 52-week high was $31.63, and the 52-week low was $12.75. For the years 1993 through 1997 Apple stock had a five-year high of $65.25 per share, and $12.75 was its five-year low.\n\nANALYSTS' OPINIONS\n\nSteve Jobs' return to Apple was applauded by some and criticized by others. Many praise his pioneering work in taking object-oriented technology to the World Wide Web and see this as Apple's salvation, especially as it strives to stay Internet-compatible. Others see him as a power-monger scheming to take over Apple and fear he could bring about the company's demise with ruinous policies. According to Sebastian Rupley of PC Magazine, Apple's key goal should be to attract the best software developers.\n\nAnalysts seemed to feel it was best to take a \"wait and see\" attitude on Apple stock and gave it a \"hold\" rating, though a few did award the company \"moderate buy\" or even \"strong buy\" ratings, based on the company's improved performance in the first half of 1998. In June of 1998, Standard & Poor's (S&P) revised its outlook on Apple Computer Inc. from negative to positive. S&P's revision reflected Apple's improved profitability and financial flexibility. Prior negative ratings were based on declining revenues and operating losses in 1996 and 1997, as well as the company's struggle with competitive conditions in the industry and its declining market share. Also, Apple's market presence in the higher-growth corporate and consumer markets was small and still declining.\n\nCited as positives for the company were its strong position in the education and desktop publishing markets, as well as Apple's significant progress in reducing staff and operating costs. This, and its improved financial position during 1998, helped improve Apple's outlook. The analysts still had long-term concerns about the company's ability to sustain its revenue growth and profitability, however. Overall, S&P reported that, \"Ratings could improve if Apple is able to stabilize revenues while maintaining profitability and financial flexibility.\"\n\nHISTORY\n\nSteve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, two college dropouts, built the first Apple computer in Jobs' garage in 1976. This microcomputer, the Apple I, was a bare-bones creation with no monitor, casing, or keyboard. These were later added, as were software and ports for third-party peripherals. On January 3, 1977, Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated. In 1980, with the sale of more than 130,000 Apple IIs and $117 million under its belt, the company went public at $22 per share. After a 1981 plane crash, Wozniak returned briefly but ultimately left the company.\n\nIn 1984, Apple revolutionized microcomputing with the introduction of its Macintosh (Mac) personal computer. Unlike other computers on the market, the Mac interface allowed users to forgo the ubiquitous text commands, instead opting for a system whereby the user would control operations by clicking and dragging on-screen \"icons.\"\n\nAccording to some accounts, Jobs originally opposed the Mac and only embraced it (dismissing its very proponents and taking the credit himself) after the dismal market failure of his Lisa system. After a volatile power struggle within the company, Apple's board of directors voted unanimously to replace Jobs with former PepsiCo executive, John Sculley. Soon thereafter, Apple entered the desktop publishing market with the Mac Plus and LaserWriter printer. In 1987, Apple founded a software company, later named Claris.\n\nThe rise of archnemesis Microsoft took larger and larger bites out of Apple's market share, and the company soon had to contend with a comparable opponent with a similar product. Complicating matters was the fact that Apple would not license its software to other computer manufacturers, a move that did not improve the company's marketability. Widespread competition in the PC market often made IBM clones more economical, with software widely available. In 1994, the company released its Power Mac computer, though sales did not live up to expectations. In 1995, the company was forced to shut down its online service, eWorld. In 1996, Apple brought in a new CEO, Gilbert Amelio.\n\nWidely regarded as the force behind the successful turnaround at National Semiconductor, Amelio immediately announced major changes at Apple. He divided the company into seven divisions, each responsible for its own success or failure. Nonetheless, under this new organizational structure, divisions were more accountable to top management, which would have tighter control over the company's actions. Soon thereafter, Amelio announced the purchase of Jobs' company, NeXT software. Jobs would return to Apple as a consultant and Apple would replace the Mac OS with NeXT's \"Rhapsody\" operating system, expected for release in 1998. In another surprise move, the company announced that Wozniak would join Jobs on Apple's executive committee and as a consultant to Amelio.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nApple's primary strategy during the late 1990s was to maintain and augment its market share in the personal computer industry while developing and expanding similar endeavors such as personal interactive products, client/server systems, on-line services, and the licensing of its Macintosh operating system. The company's original strategy of not licensing the operating system to other developers, or authorizing the production of Mac clones, came back to haunt it. In 1994 the company made an about face, licensing three companies to produce Macintosh clones and, in turn, lost some of its market share. That same year, it released its Power Mac, a much faster computer running on a PowerPC microchip, which allowed users to use software for several different platforms, including Windows. In order to spark the creation of more Mac-compatible software, Apple licensed the rights to its operating system (Mac OS) to IBM and Motorola in 1996. In 1997, interim CEO Steve Jobs announced the company was pursuing an alliance with Microsoft to offer a Mac version of Microsoft Office. Apple also revoked one of its licenses for the Mac clones, to Power Computing, in order to regain some of its lost market share.\n\nIn 1997, in the interest of long-term viability, the company embarked on a major reorganization and draconian cost-cutting measures, including the layoffs of several thousand employees (almost a third of the company). It also brought Steve Jobs back as interim CEO, replacing Gil Amelio and resulting in yet another strategy shift for Apple Computer. These and other moves resulted in Apple's first profitable quarter in years (first quarter 1998). Jobs streamlined the organization, squelched Mac cloning, bear-hugged old nemesis Microsoft, forged a foothold in network computers costing less than $1,000, and—taking a cue from Dell Computer—started selling built-to-order systems over the Internet. Apple generates sales through catalogs, through regional retailers, and nationally through CompUSA.\n\nIn May 1998, Jobs announced Apple was pursuing a new strategy focused on regaining market share in software development—developers who deserted the Macintosh operating system in favor of Windows during the mid- to late 1990s. Toward this goal, Jobs was scrapping the company's Rhapsody operating system except as a transition vehicle to the new Mac OS X (OS \"10\"). Rhapsody would have allowed the Mac's operating system to run software for chips made by Intel, IBM, and Motorola as well as Apple, but would have required software developers to rewrite old Macintosh code from scratch. The new system, OS X, would have features such as hardware memory protection, more efficient multi-tasking, and faster networking. It also would not require programmers to rewrite old code from scratch. Jobs' strategy was supported by Microsoft, Adobe, and Macromedia executives, who were happy to be able to write applications that worked on both the old and new Mac systems. In the wake of Jobs' announcement, Apple's stock price rose to $39.9, the highest it reached in a year.\n\nINFLUENCES\n\nApple's comfortable advantage was eclipsed in the late 1980s when Microsoft released its Windows operating system. The Windows graphical interface was in many ways similar to the look and feel of the Macintosh—so similar that Apple decided to sue, albeit unsuccessfully. In the mid-1990s, with Windows running on more affordable IBM clones, Apple's earnings began to fall. The company's problems included shrinking revenues, defecting executives, market-stealing clone sales, and troubled products, such as its discontinued Newton handheld computers. However, Apple owners remain the industry's most loyal repurchasers. And Macintosh computers still had a niche in educational institutions and design shops. Designers specializing in Web page design and graphic arts especially liked the Mac systems, making the company a major Internet products provider.\n\nFAST FACTS: About Apple Computer, Inc.\n\nOwnership: Apple is a publicly owned company traded on NASDAQ, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (under symbol AAPLE), and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (symbol APCD).\n\nTicker symbol: AAPL\n\nOfficers: Steve Jobs, Interim CEO & Co-founder, 42; Fred D. Anderson, Exec. VP & CFO, 52, $520,311; Timothy D. Cook, Sr. VP, Worldwide Operations; Nancy R. Heinen, Sr. VP & Gen. Counsel\n\nEmployees: 10,176 (1997)\n\nChief Competitors: Apple Computer's main competitors in the electronic computer industry include: Hewlett-Packard; Compaq; Dell; Gateway; Intel; and IBM. Networking and software competitors include: Microsoft; Novell; PowerComputing; and Sun Microsystems.\n\nCURRENT TRENDS\n\nWhile third-party software designed for Windows abounded, Macintosh-compatible software was much harder to come by. However, in 1998, Hewlett-Packard announced that they would make printers compatible with the Mac operating system, which would help with some of Apple Computer's compatibility issues. The 1990s saw a boom in the commercialization of the Internet. Customers by the millions were joining the online market, an area in which Apple hoped to shine. One of the company's major efforts to do so was the forming of its WebObjects Consulting Group, which was formed around WebObjects, Apple's leading Web application development platform. The consulting group provides in-depth consulting for businesses on strategic web-based solutions for database publishing, digital asset management, and e-commerce.\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nNew products offered at Apple include the iMac, a new Macintosh computer designed for consumers. Announced on May 6, 1998, \"Reception from the Macintosh community and computer industry as a whole to the iMac has been reminiscent of the rollout of the first Macintosh in 1984, which also featured a breakthrough design for its time,\" said Andy Gore of Macworld magazine. Other products developed during 1997-98 included Apple's G3 Powerbooks and the Power Macintosh G3, \"Apple's most powerful computer ever.\" Other hardware offered includes servers, message pads, and \"emates.\" Apple also marketed software, starting with the Mac operating system and networking software. Software products included FileMaker Pro (database software), QuickTime (video, sound, music, 3D, and virtual reality software for both Macintosh and Windows), and WebObjects (a Web development application).\n\nPeripherals offered by the company include scanners, printers, monitors, network interfaces, and CD-ROM drives. The company also produces an extensive array of software applications and utilities. Its two personal digital assistants are the Newton and the MessagePad.\n\nCORPORATE CITIZENSHIP\n\nApple is an active corporate citizen. Since the early 1980s, the company has donated computer products to schools and nonprofit groups. Its grants have provided for the collaboration of K-12 schools with schools of education to strengthen teacher training. Volunteer organizations are using donated Apple products to serve their communities. At its key sites around the world, the company has established Community Affairs teams to ensure a proactive community presence. In June 1998, Apple pledged up to $1 million in network software and training to Los Angeles County schools through the county Office of Education's Technology Learning program.\n\nGLOBAL PRESENCE\n\nWith headquarters in Cupertino, California, Apple has manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Ireland. It also has distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Singapore, and Japan. The company has business, education, government, scientific, and consumer entertainment customers in more than 140 countries. Sales in North America accounted for about half of Apple's revenues. Of remaining sales, $1.6 billion was earned in Europe (24 percent), $1 billion was earned in Japan (15 percent), $490 million was earned in other Asia/Pacific regions (7 percent), and sales to the rest of the world were $347 million (5 percent).\n\nEMPLOYMENT\n\nUltimately, employees may be the ones who pay the price for Apples' turnaround. In 1996, the company laid off 1,800 workers. In 1997, the company began more major layoffs—this time over 2,000 of its remaining 11,000 full-time employees. The layoffs were a crucial part of Apple's plan to slash operating expenses by 20 percent. The company refocused, however, and in 1998 was hiring employees to fill positions needed to pursue Apple's new technical goals, satisfy customer needs, and identify new markets. In the first half of 1998, the company hired more than 600 new employees and employed 9,049 people worldwide.\n\nCHRONOLOGY: Key Dates for Apple Computer, Inc.\n\n1976:\n\nSteve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak build the first Apple computer in Jobs' garage\n\n1977:\n\nApple Computer, Inc. is incorporated\n\n1980:\n\nGoes public at $22 per share\n\n1984:\n\nIntroduces the Macintosh personal computer\n\n1985:\n\nJobs leaves Apple and creates a new computer company, NeXT Incorporated\n\n1988:\n\nApple reorganizes into four operating divisions; brought suits against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard for copyright infringement of its operating system\n\n1991:\n\nPowerBook notebook is introduced, gaining 21 percent market share in less than six months\n\n1992:\n\nMost of its lawsuit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard is dismissed\n\n1994:\n\nThe Power Mac is released\n\n1996:\n\nApple brings in new CEO Gilbert Amelio\n\n1998:\n\nNeXT is purchased, bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant\n\nAs part of its corporate culture, Apple considers the work environment critical.

For offices\n\n\"THINK DIFFERENT\"\n\nOn September 28, 1997, Apple Computer, Inc. introduced its first major ad campaign in a decade. The \"Think Different\" campaign uses photographs of major figures in recent history, along with the simple line, \"Think Different.\" Each person is someone who was considered a \"rebel,\" \"misfit,\" or pioneer. They did things differently and wound up changing the world. Although none of the people in the pictures are identified, they are symbols for change.\n\nThe campaign honors creative geniuses who have touched the lives of many people through the things they have done. Figures include Neil Armstrong, Muhammad Ali, Thomas Edison, Joan Baez, Albert Einstein, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Amelia Earhart, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Rosa Parks, and Jim Henson. Although many advertising campaigns today use celebrities to promote their products, Apple is using celebrity figures in a way that honors their spirits and accomplishments.\n\nApple Computer, Inc.'s Interim Chief Executive Officer, Steve Jobs said, \"Think Different celebrates the soul of the Apple brand-that creative people with passion can change the world for the better,\" and with people like Mahatma Ghandi and Pablo Picasso in ads for Apple, who can argue with that?\n\nthat do not have fitness facilities, reimbursement for fitness memberships is available as a benefit to employees.

In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched Apple with one product: a small, simple computer called the Apple I. At the time, almost no one had heard of a personal computer, one small enough and easy enough to be used in the home. Computers were mostly large and expensive, and owned only by corporations. Apple changed that, creating the home-computer industry and introducing many of the personal computer features still common today.\n\nFrom a Club to a Company\n\nSteve Wozniak and Steve Jobs met as teenagers through a mutual friend. They shared an interest in electronics, and by 1975, were involved with the Homebrew Computer Club, where they exchanged ideas with others interested in computers. The club was centered in what is now called Silicon Valley, a part of central California where electronics and aerospace firms sprang up during the 1960s and 1970s. Leading companies in the region included Lockheed, Hewlett-Packard Company (see entry), and Intel. Jobs and Wozniak both worked briefly at HP; Wozniak sometimes took home parts from the company to build his own computer. He was inspired by the Altair, a computer that came as a kit to be assembled at home. Released in 1975, the Altair was targeted at people with technical skills and never succeeded in the marketplace.\n\nBy this time, more than a dozen companies were making microprocessors, the electronic \"brains\" of computers located on small pieces of silicon, called chips. Chip prices began to fall, making it easier for electronics hobbyists to design their own computers. Still, the chips and other parts were not cheap. When Wozniak began building his first computer, he kept it simple to keep the cost low. This simplicity also made the machine more reliable. In February 1976, Wozniak showed his computer to Jobs and other members of their computer club. Realizing that Wozniak had created something new and amazing, Jobs convinced his friend to go into business making and selling the computer. Wozniak later said, as quoted in Infinite Loop, by Michael Malone, \"Steve was the one who thought we could make money … Steve was the hustler.\"\n\nJobs had just turned twenty-one when he and Wozniak launched the Apple Computer Company. They sold Jobs's used van and Wozniak's expensive HP calculator to raise money. Working out of the garage at Jobs's parents home in Los Altos, they built their first fifty machines for a local electronics store. The company priced the Apple I at $666.66.\n\nApple Computer at a Glance\n\nEmployees: 9,600\n\nCEO: Steve Jobs\n\nSubsidiaries: ACI Real Properties; Apple Computer (UK) Ltd.; Apple Computer B.V.; Apple Computer International; Apple Computer Ltd.; Apple Computer, Inc.

On the business side, Jobs consulted with Mike Markkula, a former marketing executive at Intel. Markkula helped plan the company's development and arranged for Apple to receive a $250,000 bank loan. Markkula also recruited Mike Scott, another electronics executive, to become the first president of Apple in 1977.\n\nWozniak soon produced the Apple II, an improved version of his first computer. The Apple II included a case, keyboard, and power supply. It also had a programming language called BASIC built into its memory, so the machine could start working as soon as it was turned on. The Apple II also displayed color images when hooked to a television (separate computer monitors came later). Wozniak designed the Apple II so owners could easily add new components inside the machine.\n\nTimeline\n\n1976:\n\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak form the Apple Computer Company and sell their first personal computers.\n\n1977:\n\nApple introduces the improved Apple II, the first practical personal computer.\n\n1980:\n\nApples sells shares to the public and raises more than $80 million in less than one hour.\n\n1982:\n\nApple becomes the first personal computer company to reach $1 billion in sales.\n\n1984:\n\nThe Macintosh computer is introduced, which includes such features as a mouse and graphical user interface.\n\n1985:\n\nWozniak and Jobs leave Apple.\n\n1991:\n\nApple enters a deal with IBM and Motorola to design a new microprocessor.\n\n1997:\n\nJobs returns to Apple and announces a deal with the Microsoft Corporation.\n\n1998:\n\nApple introduces t"
