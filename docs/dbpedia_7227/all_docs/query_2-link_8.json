        "text": "Apple Benefits\n\nThe Employee Purchase Plan+, which gives you a substantial discount on a major device once every three years on top of the regular employee discount. Friends and Family discounts are also super nice because you don't have to sneak around to let someone use your discount.\n\nPros of working at Apple\n\nTo be specific I work in an Apple Retail Store. That's why I am giving my review a 3- star rating, because I don't have experience working for corporate. I like that you are paid well for the work that you do, and that the benefits are very nice. Definitely better than any other retail job I have had so far. The people that work there are nice they are real reason I stay.\n\nCons of working at Apple\n\nI don't like the culture, or what has become of the companies culture. When I first started working their 4 years ago, the culture felt less gimmicky and more genuine to both employees and customers. I don't like the people who are hired to be managers. The company needs to change how it hires managers because the quality of management has dropped quickly. It feels as if they think of themselves as being better and they don't try to improve the work place only for their own self gain. The company culture as whole can be very arrogant in general which can be very frustrating for employees and customers alike. The inner company bureaucracy can also make it difficult to gain access to your benefits."
