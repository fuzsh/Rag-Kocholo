        "text": "Tech giant Apple has expanded its footprint in India with a new 15-storey office in the heart of Bengaluru that will house up to 1200 employees.\n\nThe company currently has nearly 3,000 employees in India. Apple’s work with Indian suppliers of all sizes supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country. Apple’s teams in Bengaluru work across a wide range of Apple’s business — from software, hardware, services, IS&T, operations, customer support, and others.\n\nThe office is the latest addition to the company’s corporate office footprint in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Gurugram, and represents another important milestone in Apple’s more than 25 year history in India, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe new Apple India office is located at Minsk Square in the center of the city, near buildings including the parliament, high court, central library, Chinnaswamy cricket stadium, and one of the largest green parks within Bengaluru.\n\nIts proximity to Cubbon Park metro station means public transit is easily accessible for employees, it said.\n\nIts interior features locally-sourced materials, including stone, wood, and fabric in the walls and flooring, and the office is filled with native plants.\n\nApple India's office uses best practices in energy conservation, will run on 100 percent renewable energy, and aims to achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum rating — the highest level of LEED certification. Apple has been carbon neutral for its corporate operations since 2020, and has run all Apple facilities using 100 percent renewable energy since 2018.\n\n\"Apple is thrilled to expand in India with our new office in the heart of Bengaluru. This dynamic city is already home to so many of our talented teams, including software engineering and hardware technologies, operations, customer support, and more. Like everything we do at Apple, this workspace is created to foster innovation, creativity, and connection. It’s an amazing space for our teams to collaborate,” said a Apple spokesperson.\n\nAccording to the lease deed documents dated January 28, 2022, shared by Propstack earlier, Apple India Private Limited had taken on lease from Prestige Estates Project Ltd ground plus 14 floors in the Minsk Square building. The total carpet area is 3.03 lakh sq ft and the total super built-up area is 4.10 lakh sq ft. The tenure of the lease is 10 years. The start date was November 28, 2022. The rent is ₹195 per sq ft per month. The total rent payable per month is ₹7.99 crore. The total car park rent payable per month is ₹58.16 lakh per month.\n\nAccording to Cushman & Wakefield's Market Beat report, Minsk Square is located in the Central Business District. The average rentals in the area are around ₹164 per sq ft per month. This micro market is in demand but availability of Grade A space is low explaining the high rentals, it said.\n\nThe micro market also has old Grade B developments but developers are adding Grade A supply. The upcoming supply up to 2026 is expected to be around 0.7 msf, the Market Beat report said.\n\nAlso Read: All you need to know about ‘Apple BKC’, India's first Apple store opening in Mumbai\n\nThe mobile giant opened its first store in India in Mumbai in April last year where it leased over 20,000 sq ft of retail space over three floors in Bandra Kurla Complex, at a minimum guaranteed rent of around ₹42 lakh per month. The same month it opened its second store in the country in Delhi’s Select City Walk in Saket. It is reportedly paying close to ₹ ₹40 lakh a month as rent for the New Delhi store."
