It changed all the game for Apple as it was quite ahead of its competition. Full introduced the app store to allow third parties to host their applications for iPad and iPhone which led them to an average daily revenue of 1 million dollars.\n\nThen in January 2011, Steve Jobs announced that he will step down as the CEO of Apple due to its bad health, and the chief operating officer Tim Cook will look after apple in his absence. Unfortunately on October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died because of cancer, and CEO Tim Cook gained complete control of Apple.\n\nUnder the leadership of Tim Cook Apple has reached great heights and launched many innovative products and services like Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and MacBooks.\n\nApple Inc. – Products and Services\n\nVarious products and services provided by Apple are as follows :\n\nMacintosh: The Mac was a personal computer lineup built by Apple that used the Mac OS operating system.
