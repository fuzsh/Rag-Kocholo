Or, is Cupertino essentially where all the \"Brains behind the Apple\" are located?\n\nJust curious... have always wondered about this.\n\nKevin\n\nI would say the latter assumption is correct, or else all Apple products wouldn't say \"Designed by Apple in California.\"\n\nAll of the executive and administration work occurs at the Cupertino campus. Besides that, there are over 1,000 employees working in Elk Grove, CA in addition to another location in Austin, TX.\n\nIsn't Apple building a second complex of buildings in Cupertino? I recall reading that they have outgrown their main HQ and are currently renting office space in Cupertino. They will move those employees into the annex HQ.\n\nIsn't Apple building a second complex of buildings in Cupertino?

I recall reading that they have outgrown their main HQ and are currently renting office space in Cupertino. They will move those employees into the annex HQ.\n\nIt isn't really an annex HQ. It is the new HQ. They will move out of their existing location at 1 Infinite Loop because Jobs wants everyone working on the same campus.\n\nThough, I don't think the move is happening as quickly as originally intended.\n\nI would say the latter assumption is correct, or else all Apple products wouldn't say \"Designed by Apple in California.\"\n\ncouldn't they just be designed in Cali, then physically manufactured (along with CA) in various places?\n\ncouldn't they just be designed in Cali, then physically manufactured (along with CA) in various places?\n\nAll Apple products are manufactured in Shanghai, China. However, I wouldn't call a factory a headquarter.\n\ncouldn't they just be designed in Cali, then physically manufactured (along with CA) in various places?\n\nYeah, usually somewhere near the serial/model numbers their products say \"Designed by Apple in California, Made in China.\"\n\nIt isn't really an annex HQ. It is the new HQ. They will move out of their existing location at 1 Infinite Loop because Jobs wants everyone working on the same campus.\n\nThis is incorrect. There are no plans to abandon the current headquarters. The new campus is intended to allow Apple to consolidate employees located in some 30 other buildings scattered around Cupertino.\n\nThat said, Apple has made zero progress on the new campus since purchasing the 50 acres in 2006.\n\nThe Cupertino campus is the Apple's main campus, and I believe the largest. However, the Austin, TX campus is large also. I believe it's actually the home of AppleCare.\n\nAll Apple products are manufactured in Shanghai, China. However, I wouldn't call a factory a headquarter.\n\nthat's interesting. i should have known it was somewhere in Asia since i saw that thread about the \"iPhone girl\", and she was Asian.\n\nthat's interesting. i should have known it was somewhere in Asia since i saw that thread about the \"iPhone girl\", and she was Asian.\n\nWell if you order a Mac online and track the shipping, it'll start at Shanghai, China. If you look at the back of your iPod, it says assembled in China. The older iPods says assembled in Taiwan. There was also that whole investigation about how Apple is treating their factory workers in China."
