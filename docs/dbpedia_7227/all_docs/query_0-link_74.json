        "text": "Corporate headquarters mix with tree-shrouded residential neighborhoods that climb into the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountain range. This is Cupertino, California. Located in on the western foothills of Silicon Valley (Santa Clara County), Cupertino provides unparalleled access to business and recreation in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe city’s renown as a center of innovation in Silicon Valley far surpasses its moderate size of approximately 60,000 residents. Around the world, Cupertino is famous as the home of high-tech giant Apple Inc. Cupertino is known as one of the founding cities of Silicon Valley and a community with a high standard of living, proximity to Silicon Valley jobs, the outdoors, and excellent public schools.\n\nCupertino is a popular address for a highly-educated and culturally diverse population. More than 60 percent of residents aged 25 years or older hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, and more than 40 percent were born outside of the United States. In 2012, Cupertino was identified as the most nonpartisan city in California.\n\nThe community transcends stereotypes. Home to Apple, Inc, and many other large and small technology companies, Cupertino is also home to five award-winning wineries. As a community of immigrants, Cupertino’s rich social tapestry includes a range of amenities, activities, and events, such as the Diwali Festival of Lights, Cherry Blossom Festival, Free Shakespeare Festival, the Tournament of Bands, and much more.\n\nRich in opportunity, culture and sunshine, Cupertino is the preferred destination in Silicon Valley for residents, businesses and visitors."
