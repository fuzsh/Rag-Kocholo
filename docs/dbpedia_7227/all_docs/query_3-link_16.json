Therefore, the amount of time the person has walked so far is 2 minutes 34 seconds and 43 hundredths of a second.\n\nSecond, the image is from Daily Overview. Here’s the description from the site:\n\n37.334185°, -122.009930°\n\nApple Park is the corporate headquarters of Apple Inc., located in Cupertino, California, USA. It was opened to employees in April 2017, superseding the original “Apple Campus,” which opened in 1993. Currently, more than 12,000 employees work in the four-story office building, which has a circumference of _____________ and a floor area of 2.8 million square feet (260,000 square meters).\n\nAct 2\n\n3. What information would be useful to figure this out?\n\n4. Write down some questions you have in your head right now.\n\nNote: Let’s assume the walking path is exactly in the middle of the building walls. Therefore, we can divide the 188 feet in half to help determine the diameter of the walking circle in the video.\n\nAct 3\n\nCommon Core Standards\n\n7.G.B.4\n\nKnow the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and use them to solve problems; give an informal derivation of the relationship between the circumference and area of a circle.\n\nTEKS\n\n7.9(B)\n\nDetermine the circumference and area of circles\n\nDaily Overview / Satellite imagery courtesy of Digital Globe / Benjamin Grant"
