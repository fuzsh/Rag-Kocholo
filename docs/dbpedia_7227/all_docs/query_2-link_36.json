        "text": "Highlights\n\nProducts\n\nPlaces\n\nApple's Old HQ (1 Infinite Loop)\n\nApple's classic headquarters in Cupertino, before Apple Park was built. This is where Steve Jobs ran Apple from 1997 to 2011.\n\nApple's old headquarters are located in Cupertino, very close to Appleâ€™s first-ever offices on Bandley Drive. The current campus was built in 1993, while Steve Jobs was out of the company. It offers a total of 850,000 sq.ft. (79,000 sq.m.) of office space. Steve reportedly hated it, seeing it as dull (but perhaps also because it was built by John Sculley). He never moved into the executive suite that his predecessor Gil Amelio arranged, preferring a smaller office on the 4th floor, overlooking the campus's inner courtyard."
