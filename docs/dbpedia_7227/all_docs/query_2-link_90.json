        "text": "Written by Kristen Yee\n\nApple is just one of the major tech companies in the Silicon Valley. e company was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976 in the garage of Jobs’ house in Los Altos, Calif. Originally, the company was named Apple Computers Inc.; it was changed in 2007 to Apple Inc., to indicate its ventures into non-computer products. Apple’s roots are in Silicon Valley, the first headquarters were built in 1993 on 1-6 In nite Loop, Cupertino, Calif. A newer campus is currently being built in Cupertino; it is dubbed “spaceship campus” for its resemblance to a saucer, but its official name is “Apple Park.” Amongst the most anticipated fixtures is the addition of the Steve Jobs eater, the site of future product launches. Other buildings include a publicly accessible Apple Store and cafe, a fitness center, research and development facilities as well as running and walking paths for employees. Following the completion of Apple’s new headquarters, people from all around the world can look forward to even greater and more innovative products."
