        "text": "Apple released an 82-page report today, detailing the \"economic impact\" the company has had on its hometown of Cupertino, California, and will continue to have on the local economy after it builds a proposed new spaceship-inspired headquarters called Apple Campus 2.\n\nAmong the interesting data points: Apple's \"conservative\" expectation that it will grow the number of Cupertino-based, full-time employees by a modest 10 percent in the next few years from its current headcount of 16,000.\n\n\"The number of Apple employees based in Cupertino has increased at an average annual rate of 18 percent over the past five years,\" Apple said in the report, which was prepared by Keyser Marston Associates Inc. \"For purpose of this analysis, however a more conservative growth rate of 10 percent is being used. With a 10 percent annual growth rate, 7,400 employees will be hired between June 2013 and the completion of Apple Campus 2 in 2016, resulting in a projected total employee count of 23,400.\"\n\nApple Campus 2 was a project led by former CEO Apple Steve Jobs, and his last public appearance before his death in 2011 was to pitch the project to the Cupertino City Council. The new campus is built around an \"iconic circular office building\" that observers have described as a cross between a spaceship and a doughnut. It will sit on 176 acres, be four stories high, total 2.8 million square feet and boast an auditorium, fitness center, research and development centers and a central plant, the company said.\n\nPhase 1 of the project is intended to house up to 12,000 employees (the company is keeping its current headquarters on Infinite Loop as well, which houses 3,000 workers today). In Phase 2, the company plans to add an additional 300,000-square feet of space that would house up to 1,200 employees. That brings the total headcount on the new campus to 14,200 Apple said. Timing of Phase 2 is \"uncertain\" at this point.\n\nHere are some other details from the report, which you can read here or peruse below.\n\n• Apple says its the largest employer in Cupertino and the second-largest tech employer in Silicon Valley. About 64 percent of its staff lives in Santa Clara County, with some 1,285 employees residing in the city of Cupertino. About 14 percent reside in San Francisco.\n\n• The company said it made purchases of $4.6 billion from more than 700 businesses located within the three cities of Cupertino, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara alone.\n\n• The 16,000 employees currently based in Cupertino (that is, work at their offices there) collectively earned $2 billion in base salary in 2012. After Apple Campus 2 is completed, employee base salary income is expected to surpass $2.9 billion. \"Company purchases and employee spending of their income on local goods and services create additional jobs, income and expenditures. Including indirect and induced impacts, Apple supported approximately $2.7 billion of annual employee income and expenditure potential in Santa Clara County in 2012, which will increase to $3.9 billion with the completion of Apple Campus 2.\n\n• Apple says it will contribue $9.1 million in annual tax revenue to the city of Cupertino in it fiscal years 2012-2013. That doesn't include \"one-time\" revenue o $38.1 million related to the construction of the campus. Local property tax revenue paid to Cupertino was about $25 million. Apple Campus 2 is expected to annually generate an added $32 million of property tax revenue to the city.\n\n• About 9,200 full-time construction workers will be hired to work on the project over three years.\n\n• Apple says it will fund more than $66 million of public improvements to be \"built around the campus and in the City of Cupertino, as well as other community benefits. These include $50.2 million of roadway, traffic, intersection, landscape and utility improvements, $10 million of bicycle and pedestrian facilities, $3.7 million in park land, and a $2.5 million dollar contribution for affordable housing.7 In addition to these one-time capital investments, Apple will annually spend approximately $35 million on a transportation demand management program, to implement the company’s alternative commute program.\"\n\n• Apple claims that for every one new Apple job, an additional 0.75 jobs are created within Santa Clara County as a result of \"linkages\" to the company."
