Fondation Segré is committed to help protect the biodiversity of our planet through the active conservation of threatened species and their habitats and the restoration of degraded ecosystems. It directly undertakes conservation projects and offers financial support to partner organisations such as the IUCN.

It has the following strategic priorities:

Favour the long-term viability of wild populations and control factors affecting their decline.

Support all efforts to maintain, restore and protect critical habitats and functional ecosystems.

Support captive breeding of endangered species and their reintroduction into the wild.

Foster the sustainable use of renewable natural resources, notably forests, water, rangelands.

Improve the efficacy and implementation of national and international legislation on biodiversity conservation, taking into account stakeholders.

Support educational activities, in particular specialized training of technical staff.

Cooperate with the relevant regulatory and enforcement institutions to prevent and mitigate the impact of illegal hunting and trading of wildlife.

Fondation Segré does not fund PhD work or research projects. Proposals for awareness raising, education, alternative livelihood and research activities will only be accepted if part of a broader conservation project. Individuals may apply but those who are supported by an organisation will be preferred.
