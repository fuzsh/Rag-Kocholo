Professor Segrè‘s research focuses on unraveling microbial metabolism. Through this exploration, Segrè aims to identify specific combinations of bacteria or metabolic functions within the human microbiome that promote health and stability. Additionally, he sees potential applications in environmental conservation, such as assisting plant-associated microbes in sequestering carbon dioxide. Affiliated with BU’s Bioinformatics Program and Biological Design Center, Segrè emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and pushing beyond traditional academic boundaries.
