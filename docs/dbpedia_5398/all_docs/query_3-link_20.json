        "text": "The Spanish DOP of Costers del Segre was created in 1988 somewhat unusually from four separate sub-zones within the region. Two further sub-zones were identified in 1998. The altitude of the region varies from 800 ft to 2400 ft on the edge of the Pyrenees giving it a continental climate but the Mediterranean is just close enough to reduce the risk of frost when the vines are most vulnerable. The days are quite warm but the nighttime temperatures are low giving the grapes an excellent spine of acids and structure.\n\nThere are old vine plots of bush-trained Garnacha and Maccabeo scattered through the region but most of the activity in the last two decades has been new plantings of international varieties in new wire-trained vineyards, as well as Spanish grapes like Albari√±o and Tempranillo from other regions."
