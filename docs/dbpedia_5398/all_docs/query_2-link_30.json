        "text": "Daniel Segrè is a Professor of Biology, Biomedical Engineering, and Physics at Boston University. He is a core faculty member of the Bioinformatics Program and of the Biological Design Center, and the founding Director of the Boston University Microbiome Initiative. After a Laurea (B.Sc-M.Sc.) in Physics from the University of Trieste, Italy, with a thesis on the theory of elementary particles, Dr. Segrè obtained a Ph.D. in Life Sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, studying prebiotic chemical networks and the origin of life. As a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, and later as a faculty at Boston University, Dr. Segrè has been pursuing a quantitative understanding of metabolism in individual organisms and in ecosystems.\n\nSegrè develops theoretical approaches and computational models for the study of complex biological networks. His interests include the dynamics and evolution of metabolism, whose complex web of small-molecule transformations underlies fundamental aspects of biological organization, from energy transduction to cell-cell communication. In addition to helping understand how biological systems function and evolve, he seeks to apply his methods to the design and optimization of engineered networks for bioenergy and biomedicine applications.\n\nWebsite"
