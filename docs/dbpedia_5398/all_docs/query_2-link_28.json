        "text": "Dr. Ayellet V. Segrè received her Ph.D. in Genetics and Genomics from Harvard University and did her postdoctoral training at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT on genetic and pathway analysis of complex diseases. In 2013, she joined the core team of the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project at the Broad Institute, whose goal was to identify genetic variants that regulate gene expression (eQTLs) in a range of human tissues. As part of GTEx, Dr. Segrè led the computational production of the genotype data and the consortium’s efforts in integrating eQTL with GWAS data to gain biological insights on the causal regulatory mechanisms of complex diseases and traits. Since the Fall of 2017, Dr. Segrè is a member of the Faculty of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, and an Assistant Scientist at the Department of Ophthalmology at Mass Eye and Ear, where she leads the genetic biostatistics and -omics efforts within the Ocular Genomics Institute.\n\nDr. Segrè is interested in using human genetics, functional genomics, and systems biology approaches to uncover the genetic risk factors and biological processes that lead to common eye diseases and patient-specific drug response. The goal of this is work is to identify new testable drug targets and help design personalized eye treatments. To address these problems, Dr. Segrè’s lab is focused on developing and applying computational methods that integrate whole genome association studies of complex eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy, with epigenetic and RNA-sequencing data from human eye tissues.\n\nSelected publications\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=ayellet+segre\n\nContact information:\n\nEmail: ayellet_segre@meei.harvard.edu\n\nPublications:"
