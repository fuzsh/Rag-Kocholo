        "text": "Dr. Ayellet Segrè develops computational and statistical genomics approaches to identify variants, genes and pathways associated with complex diseases, with applications to common eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. She has previously developed a method called MAGENTA that applies gene-set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify biological processes enriched for common variant associations with complex diseases, and has extended this approach to study the role of regulation in disease.\n\nHer current work includes integration of whole genome sequencing studies with functional genomics and epigenetics data from human cells and tissues. In addition to identifying disease-associated variants and genes, Dr. Segrè is interested in using human genetics studies to predict personalized response to treatment and side-effects of drugs."
