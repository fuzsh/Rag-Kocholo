        "text": "The C-Trap® provides the world’s first dynamic single-molecule microscope to allow simultaneous manipulation and visualization of single-molecule interactions in real time.\n\nIt combines high-resolution optical tweezers, fluorescence, and label-free microscopy, and an advanced microfluidics system in a truly integrated and correlated solution.\n\nTestimonials\n\nGroup Leader at the FOM Institute AMOLF.\n\nAn expert in cellular and molecular biophysics. His lab studies the dynamics of single proteins and cells using novel experimental approaches at the molecular level.\n\n“We use the C-Trap to directly measure the multidimensional effects of mechanical forces in protein (un)folding, enabled by the combination of single-molecule fluorescence with optical tweezers. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which chaperones act to control protein conformations and folding to the native state.”\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIn 2018 Arthur Ashkin won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery that the momentum of light can be used as an incredibly sensitive set of “tweezers”.\n\nBy shooting a laser through a microscope, he created a highly focused beam of light strong enough to trap and hold in place objects such as plastic beads. These beads can be coated to stick to a variety of biomolecules, such as proteins, cytoskeleton filaments, DNA, or RNA. Furthermore, the tiniest forces applied to these molecules can be measured as well, giving the world access to a tool not only capable of manipulating biomolecules but also capable of detecting what’s happening to them.\n\nHow can it be applied to my research?\n\nWhether you are aiming to make novel discoveries in the life sciences or develop successful drug candidates, we work on a personal level to find the right solution for you. Browse our extended list of applications to discover how these technologies can benefit your research.\n\nDon’t see your specific field represented?

It also makes it possible to measure conformational changes of proteins by combining the C-Trap with FRET. With its fast 1D scanning capabilities it is suitable for constructs such as DNA or filaments.\n\nSTED Super Resolution\n\nUpgrade to C-Trap SR for stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy to distinguish between individual DNA-binding proteins in close proximity. Perform experiments in highly crowded environments with unprecedented resolution (< 35 nm).\n\nIRM\n\nLabel-free Imaging\n\nInterference Reflection Microscopy (IRM) allows you to visualize biological structures in 3D without the need for fluorescence labeling. Its high signal-to-noise ratio lets you visualize dynamic cytoskeletal interactions with the highest contrast and temporal resolution.\n\nIRM can be correlated to both Widefield and TIRF!\n\nWidefield\n\nFluorescent Imaging in Solution\n\nUse Widefield microscopy to image biomolecular processes in solution with high acquisition rates. Suitable for obtaining fast movies of trapped constructs at low protein concentrations.\n\nWidefield can be correlated to IRM!\n\nTIRF\n\nFluorescent Surface Imaging\n\nTotal Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) is the perfect fluorescence imaging method for visualization at the surface. It allows you to image biomolecules while eliminating background fluorescence outside the focal plane.\n\nTIRF can be correlated to IRM!\n\nImaging Combinations\n\nChoose confocal upgradable to STED for the highest resolution or combine label-free IRM with TIRF or Widefield to perform truly revolutionary experiments.\n\nIntroducing the new C-Trap products\n\nDymo & Edge\n\nWith the desire to constantly produce breakthrough discoveries, you need an easy-to-use instrument, fully-optimized for your applications that should bring unprecedented insights with high precision, accuracy, and reliability, in short time. Discover your solutions below!\n\nDymo\n\nEdge\n\nFor resolving DNA and protein dynamics and interactions\n\nThe C-Trap Dymo is purposefully built and optimized to provide the ultimate tool for solution assays. Available with confocal and optional STED, with two or four traps, it is the perfect tool for the specialist deep-diving into one specific application or the facility providing access to users working on a variety of different solution assays.
