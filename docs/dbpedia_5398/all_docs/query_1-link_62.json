        "text": "Network segmentation is the process of dividing and directing email traffic that comes from other IP addresses based on the different features that are associated with your email application. Segmentation is used to help maximize performance and organization.\n\nNetwork segmentation is an architecture that divides a network into smaller sections or subnets. Each network segment acts as its own network, which provides security teams with increased control over the traffic that flows into their systems.\n\nWith network segmentation, businesses can prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to their most valuable assets, such as customer data, financial records, and intellectual property (IP). These assets are often located across organizations’ hybrid and multi-cloud environments, which means it is vital to secure all locations against cyberattacks.\n\nNetwork segmentation is also commonly referred to as network segregation but differs from other related concepts such as microsegmentation, internal segmentation, and intent-based segmentation.\n\nTraditionally, network segmentation was relatively simple, with organizations using static IP addresses and ingress and egress ports that made the process easy to define. However, with the growth of distributed networks and multi-cloud environments, IP addresses are constantly changing. As a result, network segmentation has to evolve with the changing landscape to prevent cyber criminals from gaining access to business systems, becoming part of a trusted network, and remaining under the radar.\n\nInternal segmentation enables organizations to segment their network and infrastructure assets regardless of their location and whether they are on-premises or on multiple cloud environments. The business can then establish dynamic and granular access by continuously monitoring the trust level and adapting its security policies accordingly. Critical IT assets are isolated to ensure that any threats are quickly detected and risks are prevented using methods such as analytics and automation.\n\nBusinesses using network segmentation can manage their assets through network semantics. However, they may find that this option does not provide the level of security they require. That is because there are no rules or mechanisms in place to manage necessary tasks like admission control, authentication, and assessing trust.\n\nIntent-based segmentation solves this problem by identifying where segmentation is applied, how trust is established, and what security inspections need to be applied to traffic. It combines traditional segmentation and zero-trust principles, which offer an integrated security architecture that adapts to organizations’ changing requirements. Intent-based segmentation enables them to detect and mitigate advanced threats and grant variable access on a need-to-know basis.\n\nIntent-based segmentation covers an entire network and its assets, including all endpoints and devices, which makes it more comprehensive than traditional solutions—or a flat network. It also uses existing mechanisms, such as identity-based network tools and business logic. This enables businesses to allow or prevent access to network resources based on risk and trust assessments following suspicious user behavior and actions.\n\nOrganizations can also manage what level of security inspection traffic requires and encrypt all traffic as it arrives at network speed. This is vital as trusted users can become the victim of a malware attack without knowing it and provide a route into the network for hackers.\n\nTraditionally, organizations built their security strategies based on a trusted network perimeter. This used the theory that everyone working within the four walls of the business was trusted and was treated as such behind the company firewall. However, with people increasingly working remotely and from various devices, this approach is no longer effective.\n\nInstead of protecting the network perimeter, the zero-trust model takes the “never trust, always verify” approach to ensure only the right people have the right level of access to the right resources in the right context. Access is continuously assessed without adding friction, such as login requests, to users.\n\nUser credentials can be managed by identity and access management (IAM) solutions that protect sensitive data and people. IAM is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that enable organizations to manage their digital identities and user access to critical information and resources. It assigns roles to users to ensure they have the right level of access to resources and networks, which boosts security, offers greater agility, and reduces costs.\n\nIAM enhances the user experience while keeping the business secure. It does this with tools like single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), which quickly and easily verify and authenticate users. It also automates time-intensive tasks that are susceptible to human error, which is key as businesses embrace mobile and remote working and cloud adoption.\n\nOrganizations also now need to be able to see and protect a wide range of devices that sign in to their network. As a result, network access control (NAC) solutions are assisting with bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies and accommodating Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. This increases the visibility of every device and user that joins the network, limits areas of the network that devices can access, and automates responses to speed up event reaction times.\n\nLogical segmentation is a more popular way of breaking the network into smaller, more manageable sections. It often does not require the organization to invest in new hardware or wiring, which is helpful in reducing costs and is more flexible.\n\nA logical segmentation approach deploys existing network infrastructure concepts using VLANs or a network addressing scheme. VLANs automatically send traffic to the most appropriate subnet, while a network addressing scheme is more complicated and theoretical.\n\nLogical segmentation is a more popular way of breaking the network into smaller, more manageable sections.

VLANs automatically send traffic to the most appropriate subnet, while a network addressing scheme is more complicated and theoretical.\n\nNetwork segmentation is vital for organizations to secure their resources, systems, and users, as well as minimize the risk of attackers gaining access to their critical corporate information. Achieving this is reliant on deploying traditional technologies that businesses have used to segment their networks for years with modern alternatives that provide protection from more advanced threats.\n\nTraditional technologies like VLANs, which improve traffic management, and access control lists, which add a layer of security by acting as a firewall across subnets, help businesses to segment network traffic. They need to be paired with a modern solution like the FortiGate next-generation firewall (NGFW), which allows organizations to filter network traffic and provides advanced visibility. This, in turn, enables them to identify and prevent advanced threats and malware. FortiGate not only blocks malware but also ensures businesses are future-proofed and receive updates that keep them in line with the evolving threat landscape.\n\nFor high threat protection performance and modern network segmentation approaches, segment your network with FortiGate."
