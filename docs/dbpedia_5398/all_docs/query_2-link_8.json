        "text": "Profession: Physicist and Nobel Laureate\n\nBiography: Emilio G. Segrè was an Italian-American physicist who co-discovered the element technetium, the first artificially synthesized chemical element, making a significant impact in the fields of physics and chemistry. His discovery, in collaboration with Carlo Perrier, added a new dimension to the periodic table and broadened the scope of atomic research.\n\nSegrè's contributions were not limited to his work with technetium. He also discovered the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle, with his colleague Owen Chamberlain. This discovery, which confirmed the existence of antimatter and opened new frontiers in particle physics, earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959.\n\nIn addition to his research, Segrè was a revered educator. He taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and his students included future Nobel laureates such as Yuan T. Lee.\n\nBorn: January 30, 1905\n\nBirthplace: Tivoli, Italy\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Dragon\n\nStar Sign: Aquarius"
