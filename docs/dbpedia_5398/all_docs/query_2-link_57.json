He defended his Ph.D. with the thesis title Explanation-Based Learning of Generalized Robot Assembly Plans from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under Gerald DeJong in 1987. His research interests include distributed algorithms for solving optimization problems, linkage analysis problems from statistical genetics, and protein structure prediction techniques, machine learning, and parallel search algorithms such as A*, αβ-minimax, Davis-Loveland-Putnam, and applications of these algorithms to both standard AI problems and economic problems such as combinatorial auction winner determination.\n\nSelected Publications\n\n[2]\n\n1985 ...\n\nAlberto Maria Segre, Gerald DeJong (1985).
