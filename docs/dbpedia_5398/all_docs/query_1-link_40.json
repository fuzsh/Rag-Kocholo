        "text": "Today, there is no individual identification of primary glass containers for parenteral use. If a problem is identified during a process step, manufacturers are unable to define exactly which products may have been impacted. As a result, they adopt either an “over segregation” or “full batch write-off\" policy. This can have significant financial impact from lost or missed revenue and lead to drug shortages in the market.\n\nThe option of uniquely coded containers would improve production efficiency and quality by providing insight into each process. This data could help drive more detailed root cause analysis, corrective actions and adjustments to product design and process optimization.\n\nThe glass container traceability solution marks each primary container with a unique identity. This machine readable 2D barcode code allows each container to be tracked at every manufacturing process - from forming through to filing and automated inspection. The addition of manufacturing data at each step delivers significant process and quality benefits for both the glass container producer and pharma companies.\n\n[1] 2019 PDA Traceability of Primary Packaging Survey – Published January 2020"
