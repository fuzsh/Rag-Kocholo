        "text": "Fondation Segré and IUCN Save Our Species are proud to announce that the fourth calls for proposals under the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund are now live. The deadline to apply is Thursday 4 April 2024 at 14:00 (2pm) Central European Summer Time – CEST.\n\nMore information, including guidelines for applicants, can be found in the link above.\n\nUngulates are known as “nature’s architects”. They contribute significantly to maintaining the health and resilience of our ecosystems. By eating vegetation, they support seed dispersal and germination, ultimately supporting the distribution and abundance of animal species.\n\nAdditionally, ungulates are critical prey species that support the survival of carnivore and scavenger wildlife species in any ecosystem. Humans and wildlife alike depend on them for survival and yet, poaching, habitat loss and diseases threaten the survival of many of these species.\n\nTo address the pressing need for global conservation efforts, this year’s calls for proposals specifically focus on the conservation of globally threatened ungulate species as recognised by the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. The calls aim to safeguard their habitats, address the threats they face, and promote the well-being of both the species themselves and the communities who share the same ecosystems.\n\nThe Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund, funded by Fondation Segré through IUCN Save Our Species, is a five-year initiative which will run until 2026. The Fund focuses on threatened species and their habitats across Asia, the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East. This initiative supports conservation projects and young and early career researchers for priority species considered as threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Fondation Segré is committed to help protect the biodiversity of our planet through the active conservation of threatened species and their habitat and the restoration of degraded ecosystems.\n\nPartners of the Fondation Segré Conservation Action Fund"
