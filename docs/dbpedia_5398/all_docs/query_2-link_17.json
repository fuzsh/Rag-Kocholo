        "text": "Dr. Emilio G. Segre, a nuclear scientist who shared the 1959 Nobel Prize in physics with Dr. Owen Chamberlain for creating an antiproton, or antimatter with a negative charge, died of a heart attack on Saturday while walking near his home in Lafayette, Calif. He was 84 years old.\n\nDr. Segre had been a faculty member of the University of California at nearby Berkeley since 1938. He assumed professor emeritus status in 1972 but remained active in research, writing and lecturing.\n\nIn 1955, he, Dr. Chamberlain and two assistants confirmed the existence of the antiproton, which can destroy both the positive proton of matter and the neutron. Those particles make up the nucleus of atoms. They produced the elusive particle in the university's powerful atom smasher, called the Bevatron.\n\nThe artificial creation of the antiproton lent support to the hypothesis that a mirror image of the universe exists in which the atoms are made up of positively charged electrons and negatively charged nuclei, an anti-universe. Early Work on Plutonium\n\nIn wartime work at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, Dr. Segre contributed to the discovery of plutonium and in confirming that plutonium was fissionable. In later years, he backed efforts to achieve world peace and bar any use of nuclear weapons.\n\nEmilio Gino Segre was born in Tivoli, Italy, on Feb. 1, 1905, to Giuseppe Segre, an industrialist, and the former Amelia Treves. He studied engineering at the University of Rome but shifted to physics, where he studied under Dr. Enrico Fermi and earned a Ph.D. His work with the pioneering Dr. Fermi continued for more than three decades.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
