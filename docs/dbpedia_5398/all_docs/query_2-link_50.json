        "text": "Holocaust survivor and Life Senator Liliana Segre said that she has been subjected to serious threats for some considerable time while stressing that she has no intention of bowing to the intimidation.\n\n“I receive crazy threats, which I have ignored for years,” Segre said during an event at the Shoah Memorial in Milan.\n\n“And I worry about these haters, who should be protected and taken care of.\n\n“But I have seen everything, how can I be afraid to leave the house?.\n\n“I always say that I have lived in vain,” she continued.\n\n“I went to schools for 30 years to talk about what had happened (only) to find myself at 94 years of age being told ‘be careful, stay at home’.\n\n“I like living, I am active, I have many passions.\n\nShould I stay at home because someone wants to kill me? No”.\n\nSegre has expressed “terrible sadness” at the “ghastly atmosphere” triggered by the brutal and unprecedented attacks by Hamas against Israel on October 7."
