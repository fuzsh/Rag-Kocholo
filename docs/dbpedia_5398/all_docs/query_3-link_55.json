        "text": "A joy to drink now and over the next several years, the 2020 Castell del Remei Gotim Bru requires little more than a clean glass to please, yet it is crafted for the delights of the table where it shines brightly. Catalan and Mediterranean fare provide especially fine accompaniments. Much like its French neighbors in Languedoc and Provence, olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, legumes, eggplant, and plenty of wild herbs figure significantly in Catalan cooking. Rotisserie chicken or spit roasted game birds, which are liberally basted with olive oil, rosemary, and thyme, make splendid companions to the 2020 Castell del Remei Gotim Bru. Thick, rich stews as well as bean and lentil dishes provide equally tasty pairings. Escalivada (roasted red peppers, eggplant, and onions), a traditional Catalan specialty that is dipped in olive oil and served with the region’s Pa amb tomàquet (country bread rubbed with fresh tomato and, yes, more olive oil), provides a delicious side to any poultry, meat, or seafood dish, and it is equally pleasing on its own in the company of a glass of Castell del Remei Gotim Bru. Chicken Souvlaki, vegetable strombolis, and ratatouilles with plenty of eggplant provide delicious companionship, too. Que Aprofiti!\n\nCastell del Remei dates to 1780, and it is the oldest winery in Catalonia to estate grow, bottle, and age its wines in the manner of Classified Bordeaux. It can also lay claim to being one of the most beautiful and well-preserved wineries in Catalonia. Moreover, the wines that flow from this venerable Catalan estate are all Certified Organic, and they are even more charming and seductive than the property itself, including this month’s feature, the 2020 Castell del Remei Gotim Bru, the winery’s most well-known offering.\n\nCastell del Remei is a large inland estate with a Mediterranean/Continental climate. Cold winters, hot summers, low rainfall, and relatively low humidity provide ideal conditions for the cultivation of the vine at this prime property. Most of its 100 hectares (approximately 247 acres) of vineyards grow at high elevation (between 700-800 meters) on the mountain in sight of the winery. The soil composition is an enviable mixture of sandy loam, clay, and gravel that affords excellent drainage.\n\nThe estate’s varietal composition includes Spain’s most important autochthonous varietals, all of which are vinified by Castell del Remei’s owner and winemaker Tomàs Cusiné. Garnacha (Grenache), Tempranillo, Cariñena (Carignan), and Trepat predominate for red wines, while the indigenous Malvasia and Macabeu provide the raw material for Catalonia’s traditional white wines. Although not indigenous to Spain, French grape varieties, most notably Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc, were introduced into Catalonia by Castell del Remei in the 19th century. These French grape varieties figure significantly in the wines of Castel del Remei as they do in most Catalan wines, not only in the Costers del Segre D.O. but also in Priorat and throughout Catalonia.\n\nIn addition to Castell del Remei’s Gotim Bru, which roughly translates to a bunch of red grapes (a very fine bunch of red grapes we may add), and Gotim Bru Blanc, a bunch of white grapes, Castell del Remei fashions an elegant, powerful, and long-lived red wine named 1780. This wine bears the name of the winery’s founding, and it’s an artful blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, and Garnacha. Castell del Remei’s Gotim Bru and 1780 have received many 90+ ratings over the years, but recent releases have not been reviewed in the United States as Castell del Remei’s wines were not available here for several years. Castell del Remei also crafts another tasty red and white blend, Oda, as well as a robust 100% Garnacha. You can be sure we will once again be seeing more of this great winery’s wines."
