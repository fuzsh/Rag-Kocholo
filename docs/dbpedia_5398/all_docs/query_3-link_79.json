Clean and bright with a fresh and penetrating aroma with notes of peach and tropical fruits and a floral background. In the mouth, this Spanish white displays structure and complexity, a balanced finish and refreshing acidity. An excellent accompaniment for fish dishes or for aperitifs, starters, and tapas.\n\nAbout the estate\n\nIt all started with the ambition of a restless man, Juan de Porcioles, who had always dreamed of living in the country, cultivating the land and raising his own livestock … So it was that, in 1992, the Porcioles-Buixó family bought the property. Since then, the estate has been developed with hard work and enthusiasm and endowed with its own character and singularity. Today, it is known as Finca de Flix. At the same time, Juan de Porcioles, a great lover of wine, gradually developed the idea of cultivating his own vineyard to produce wines with a distinct personality and of the highest quality. So, in 1998, and with the help of friends and family, he planted the first vineyard, Vinya Vella, by hand, prompting the recovery of winegrowing in the region. This was quite a project, which, today, thanks to his wife and children, is becoming a reality."
