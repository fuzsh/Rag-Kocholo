Naong Sasa (prod. by Afrikan Sciences)\n\nTwo years after the acclaimed Wogdog Blues, Art Melody returns with Moogho - “world” in Mooré, the language of the Mossi people of Burkina Faso.\r\n\r\nMoogho explores bridges between continents, styles and times, as Art Melody raps and sings on top of uncompromising productions by long time partner Redrum, aided by a a slew of far reaching international producers.\r\n\r\nMoogho is released exactly one year after the Burkinabè insurection which successfully ousted president Blaise Compaoré. The album also comes out days after the recent failed coup in Burkina Faso, a reminder of the still frail state of affairs in Ouagadougou.

Moogho is a universal dance, a global vibration hailing straight from the streets of Ouagadougou.",
