        "text": "EXPLORE ALL OUR CATALUNYA WINE REGIONS GUIDE\n\nLast updated: August 15, 2024\n\nIntroduction\n\nUntil quite recently, Costers del Segre was one of Catalunya’s more obscure regions, despite the laudable efforts of the sizable Raimat estate. Then the Torres family announced they were investing in this corner of northeastern Spain, and everything changed. CEO Miguel Torres Maczassek said the Pallars subzone of Costers del Segre “is one of the great untapped resources in Catalan viticulture.” To that end, Torres planted a collection of French varieties – Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Merlot were among them – in addition to some pre-phylloxera Spanish grapes. Fast-forward eight years, and the DO has been transformed out of all recognition – a great deal of critical buzz has put Costers del Segre on the international map. Due to the incredibly varied topography, local winemakers can fashion a wide range of styles in this trendy appellation. Take your pick.\n\nDiscover more about Spanish Wine\n\nHistory\n\nThe Phoenicians were among the earliest seafarers to reach the Iberian Peninsula, with the Greeks arriving later. By the 6th century BC, Carthage, once a Phoenician colony, became dominant. However, the Second Punic War ended with the Romans establishing themselves in Hispania for over 600 years, ushering in the ‘Pax Romana’ era.\n\nBy the 5th century, Rome weakened, and the Visigoths, Germanic tribes from the north, took over. They allied with the Hispano-Roman elites, bringing a phase of political stability. However, by 718, the Islamic army from North Africa, led by Tariq ibn Ziyad, conquered Catalunya. Most of it was recaptured by Christians within 70 years, creating a de facto boundary with Moorish regions.\n\nCatalunya expanded its territory after the caliphate’s disintegration into Taifas thanks to its strong navy. Yet, its autonomy was short-lived. After allying with Aragon in the 12th century, Catalunya was eventually absorbed into the Castilian state through the marriage of Fernando of Aragon and Isabel of Castile in 1469. These monarchs, known for ending Muslim rule in Granada and establishing the Spanish Inquisition, also sponsored Columbus’ voyages, leading to Spain’s global empire.\n\nThe subsequent Habsburg rulers spent Spain’s wealth on luxuries and wars. The Bourbon era, particularly under Felipe V, revived regions like Catalunya, which became an industrial center in the 1800s. Despite challenges like the phylloxera louse affecting winegrowing, Catalunya remained resilient, adapting with methods like regrafting European vines onto American rootstock.\n\nHowever, many vineyards in Costers del Segre were replaced with olive trees, as they were considered a more economically sound crop. Then in 1986, the region was awarded DO status; the appellation remained largely unknown outside Catalunya until the early 21st century. Its most famous producer has long been Raimat, established by Manuel Raventós i Domènech in 1914. Today, the property cultivates 3,000 hectares of organic vineyards in the arid expanse of Lleida – a poster child for the area’s potential. But Tomàs Cusiné, Torres, and Castell d’Encus have also done much to further the DO’s reputation abroad.\n\nWinemaking and regional classifications\n\nWith many grape varieties and terroirs at their disposal, winegrowers in Costers del Segre like to market a broad spectrum of styles. This vinous diversity is positively encouraged by the DO – red, white, and rosado (rosé) wines are given an equal billing here. A growing volume of grapes are also used to produce sparkling wine in Costers del Segre, marketed under the auspices of the Cava appellation. High-altitude sites are in great demand in the zone, as are old Xarel-lo bush vines. The best examples can rival the tremendous efforts of Gramona and Recaredo in the more established vineyards of Penedes.\n\nHowever, still, wines are far more important in terms of sales – both at home and abroad. Today some of the finest reds are being made in the Garrigues subregion, just over the Montsant range from Priorat – the terrain is not dissimilar. These Grenache-dominant cuvées can offer exceptional value: spicy, potent, and gloriously rich. Under the DO rules, they can be sold as Crianzas (two years aging before release) or Gran Reservas (five years maturation before being sold). The use of oak is commonplace in Costers de Segre, particularly for Grenache, Carignan, and Monastrell blends. They are increasingly joined by excellent Tempranillo reds, sometimes mixed with international grapes like Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The Vall del Riucorb subzone has shown great promise for Bordeaux’s premier red grape; Artesa de Segre offers ripe flavors and silky textures.\n\nMeanwhile, old vine Macebeo and Xarel-lo steal the show in Pallars Jussa. But, for many consumers, Raimat’s vast range of varietal wines is the safest bet. The surprises are admittedly few, but Raimat is hard to beat for quality and consistency.\n\nGeography and terroir\n\nFlanked by the western Pyrenees, Costers del Segre is Catalunya’s most isolated vineyard. To the west is the province of Aragon – the Segre River (from which the region takes its name) joins the Ebro just south of Lleida. And with so much to offer along the coast and in Barcelona, most travelers tend not to bother much with Catalunya’s interior. More fool them: this is a sparsely populated and beautiful region, largely tourist-free.\n\nBut there are vines in all directions in the Segre River valley, divided into seven widely scattered subzones. They are Artesa de Segre, Les Garrigues, Pallars Jussa, Raimat, Segria, Valls del Riucorb, and Urgell. As a result, soils and growing conditions can vary significantly between different zones, although the overall climate has been described as “harsh” by many residents. Of course, they refer to the semi-arid, continental climate of Costers del Segre: scorching summers and bitterly cold winters. Indeed, to the untrained eye, Costers del Segre is an unlikely winegrowing destination – a place where making fresh and balanced wines should be impossible.\n\nYet it isn’t. As Codorniu’s head winemaker Bruno Colomer so eloquently observed: “We have to keep in mind that Costers de Segre offers a very particular climate and soil. The region’s continental climate – depending on the distance to the sea – can be beneficial for optimal ripening; its ‘secret’ is the fluctuating temperatures between day and night which have a positive effect on grape maturation.” It is this diurnal variation that growers regard as their most important natural advantage; in specific high-altitude sites, the variance in temperature can sometimes be higher than 68°F. Without this elevation, acidity would be a scarce commodity in Costers del Segre. Nevertheless, irrigation is essential in certain parts of the DO.\n\nThe lowdown\n\nCosters de Segre emerged in the 1990s as an ambitious producer in the Spanish wine world. All it lacked was a collection of recognized brands – something Raimat and, more recently, Miguel Torres have worked hard to remedy. This family company broke new ground with the release of Purgatori, a beguiling concoction of Syrah, Carignan, and Grenache. This powerful and concentrated red – expect oodles of garrigue, red fruit, and cassis on the palate – seems to have caught the imagination of buyers and the wine-drinking public. It has helped spread the renown of Catalunya’s most underrated viticultural resource.\n\nHowever, this is changing. The region is buoyant with new wineries and experimentation with pre-phylloxera varieties; the accusation that Costers del Segre “is more New World than Catalan” is no longer valid. True, the DO is not a fertile source of icon wines and lavishly expensive labels – head to Priorat if you want to spend serious sums. But greatness is not just about scarcity or prestige. The vast majority of wines made in Costers del Segre are bottles to be enjoyed and not hidden away: well-made, delicious, and suited to a wide range of cuisines. It has become one of Catalunya’s most reliable sources of excellent vino. Let’s celebrate it."
