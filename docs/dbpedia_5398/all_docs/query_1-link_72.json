        "text": "[This Executive Summary has been updated to reflect the correct figures on plastic bag use in the Philippines: every day, almost 48 million shopping bags are used throughout the Philippines, or roughly 17.5 billion pieces a year.]\n\nAs a tool, WABAs help 1) expose the role of specific corporations in the global proliferation of plastic waste; 2) unmask how the industry has passed on the blame for the waste they produce to the consumers of their products, and the responsibility for clean-up of their packaging to governments; and 3) reinforce the need for corporations to accept liability for the full life-cycle impacts of their products and the packaging in which their products are sold.\n\nThis report compiles data from 21 waste assessments conducted in six cities and seven municipalities across the Philippines by MEF and local government project partners, with the support of GAIA and funding from the Plastic Solutions Fund. Data from these 21 waste assessments were used to extrapolate national data, including estimates about the use and disposal of different types of plastic residuals. Among the 21 sites where waste assessments were conducted, 15 sites have additional brand audit data. These data provide a snapshot of how much plastic waste, particularly those with branded packaging, are discarded by households.\n\nBased on WABAs conducted in areas across the Philippines, findings highlighted in this report confirm that:\n\nOrganic waste comprise more than 50% of generated waste in the Philippines, affirming that organic waste management is an important strategy that will create substantial waste reduction for local governments.\n\nDisaggregating data on the different types of plastic residuals gives a clearer picture of waste generation, providing valuable information on policy actions needed to substantially reduce this highly problematic waste stream.\n\nThe strict implementation of plastic bag regulations produces dramatically significant results in lowering plastic bag use. However, the existence of a plastic bag regulation in a city or municipality does not automatically equate to lower plastic bag use.\n\nAlmost 164 million pieces of sachets are used in the Philippines daily, equating to around 59.7 billion pieces of sachets yearly. With the absence of policies mandating liability and accountability for the production of this problematic waste stream, cities and municipalities are left to deal with this problem using taxpayers’ money.\n\nWhile more attention should be given to ensure the reusability of packaging and products, it is important to acknowledge that within current waste management systems, recycling plays an important role in supporting livelihoods, and creating additional income for households, villages and/or municipalities and cities.\n\nMore than 50% of all unrecyclable residual waste discarded in the country is branded waste, and only 10 companies are responsible for 60% of all branded waste in the study sites. This highlights the urgent need for interventions that involve manufacturers in taking responsibility for their plastic waste, primarily by drastically reducing production of throwaway plastic packaging.\n\nUsing WABA data, this research extrapolates national estimates on annual per capita use of plastic shopping bags, plastic labo, and sachets in the Philippines. Findings show that:\n\nThe average Filipino uses 591 pieces of sachets, 174 shopping bags, and 163 plastic labo bags, yearly.\n\nEveryday, almost 48 million shopping bags are used throughout the Philippines, or roughly 17.5 billion pieces a year.\n\nPlastic labo bag use throughout the Philippines is at 45.2 million pieces per day, or 16.5 billion pieces a year.\n\nAround three million diapers are discarded in the Philippines daily, or 1.1 billion diapers annually.\n\nThese figures show that the sheer volume of residual waste generated daily is beyond the capacity of barangays, cities and municipalities to manage: the problem is the huge amount of single-use plastics being produced, not the way the waste is managed. Experiences in GAIA’s Zero Waste Cities project sites show that after implementing Zero Waste strategies (for example establishing working materials recovery facilities or MRFs, conducting door to door segregated collection, composting organics, and maximizing recycling of high-value materials, etc.) cities can only achieve a maximum of 70-80% waste diversion (i.e. maximizing the sustainable management of discards to avoid landfilling and other final disposal methods) compared to their pre-Zero Waste program baseline. Despite expanding Zero Waste strategies, cities and municipalities will be left with around 20% of waste that they cannot manage—sachets and other single use plastics—preventing them from fully achieving Zero Waste goals.\n\nClearly, plastics are a global problem with local repercussions, and it is the cities and municipalities, as well as ordinary citizens, who bear the brunt of the problem. But the plastic crisis can be tackled, starting with using WABA as a tool.\n\nSeveral case studies of Zero Waste Cities project sites in the Philippines featured in this report show how WABA data was used in waste and resource management planning to:\n\nmaximize waste diversion rates;\n\ncreate a system to efficiently collect segregated waste from previously hard-to-reach areas while creating jobs for informal waste workers;\n\ndesign eco-sheds for materials recovery facility;\n\ndesign community composting facilities;\n\npredict landfill capacity and lifespan, and support investment in Zero Waste strategies; and\n\nreveal trends in plastic use in a city and municipality for monitoring and improvement of regulations.\n\nWhile this report is focused on examples from the Philippines, the experiences related here are not unique, and the recommendations in this report are applicable in other countries. Cities all over Asia and in the developing world in general are faced with the same problem of plastic residuals, most of which have been identified as branded plastic packaging from multinational corporations (MNCs) based in the global north. This points to the need for a global plastic regulation to reduce and eventually eliminate the production of single-use plastic products and packaging.\n\nBased on the findings, this report gives the following recommendations:"
