        "text": "Our Score: 89\n\nThe Lagravera cellar, pioneer of organic viticulture and winemaking in Catalunya, Spain, is in a region northwest of Barcellona and south of the Pyrenees. The typical grapes here are Monastrell (Mourvèdre), Garnacha Tinta (Grenache Rouge), and some international grapes such as Merlot, which is used in the case of this specific bottle.\n\nThe result is a very nice and easy to drink wine, smooth enough but definitively crisp at the palate, with fine tannins. At the nose, it is fruity and spicy, with black and blueberries, chocolate, paprika, smoked chestnuts and a touch of minerality coming from the alluvial gravel soil.\n\nGrapes: Monastrell (Mourvèdre), Garnacha Tinta (Grenache Rouge), Merlot\n\nPairing: It needs food for sure, and it is particularly good with eggs and bacon, a burger or roasted chicken and potatoes.\n\nAppellation: Costers del Segre DOP, Catalunya Spain\n\nSHIPPING\n\nWe ship within the United States, in the states in which shipping is possible; the list changes periodically but it is always updated on the cart and you will be able to place your order only if we ship there. We do not ship to PO Boxes, APO and FPOs.
