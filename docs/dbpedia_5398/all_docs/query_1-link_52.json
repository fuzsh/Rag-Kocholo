In addition, if the patient is affected with a hematological malignancy, DNA extracted from a non-hematological source (e.g. skin fibroblasts) is strongly recommended.\n\nPlease note that, in rare cases, mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) variants may not be detectable in blood or saliva in which case DNA extracted from post-mitotic tissue such as skeletal muscle may be a better option.\n\nRead more about our sample requirements here.\n\nDiagnostic testing in affected family members\n\nPredictive testing in unaffected family members\n\nCarrier testing in the case of autosomal recessive and X-linked disorders\n\nSegregation of variants\n\nWith Familial Variant Testing, you can order for up to 10 variants per order for a fixed price.\n\nBlueprint Genetics will only report the variant(s) of interest.

Please see the Discordant Relatedness entry on our FAQ page for more details on how we define and handle discordant relatedness when identified.\n\nTest Strengths & Limitations\n\nTest strengths\n\nCLIA-certified personnel performing clinical testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory\n\nPowerful sequencing technologies, advanced target enrichment methods and precision bioinformatics pipelines ensure superior analytical performance\n\nComprehensive clinical statement\n\nTest limitations\n\nFamilial Variant Testing for mitochondrial variants, CNVs and testing of prenatal samples are only available for cases where the index patient was tested at Blueprint Genetics.\n\nFamilial Variant Testing for mitochondrial variants is not available for prenatal samples. Structural variant and repeat expansion testing is not available.\n\nFor further information on limitations, please contact our Support team.\n\nFamilial Variant Testing may not reliably detect the following:\n\nLow level mosaicism\n\nOur variant specific tests are sectioned from our high-quality, clinical grade NGS assay. Please see our sequencing and detection performance table for details regarding our ability to detect different types of alterations (Table).\n\nAssays have been validated for various sample types including EDTA-blood, isolated DNA (excluding from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue), saliva and dry blood spots (filter cards). These sample types were selected in order to maximize the likelihood for high-quality DNA yield. The diagnostic yield varies depending on the assay used, referring healthcare professional, hospital and country. Plus analysis increases the likelihood of finding a genetic diagnosis for your patient, as large deletions and duplications cannot be detected using sequence analysis alone. Blueprint Genetics’ Plus Analysis is a combination of both sequencing and deletion/duplication (copy number variant (CNV)) analysis.\n\nThe performance metrics listed below are from an initial validation performed at our main laboratory in Finland.
