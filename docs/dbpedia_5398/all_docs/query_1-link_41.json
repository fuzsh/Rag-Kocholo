Our most recent accreditation comes as Kenya’s Bureau of Standards (KEBS) pilots some country exclusions from the PVoC program for destination inspection.\n\nWelcome back to the PCA Kenya Community!\n\nAfter yet another term of 36 months of engagement with KEBS, SGS is the only company to have maintained its position of pre-export verification of conformity (PVoC) services for the sixth consecutive period, which began on June 23, 2022.\n\nThis time around KEBS excluded a few countries from the PVoC program specifically as a pilot exercise for assessing its capability in providing destination inspection services.\n\nSGS emerged the pioneer inspection company, and also continues to provide Product Conformity Assessment services on behalf of KEBS.\n\nKEBS accredited and mandated exclusively SGS to provide PVoC services in the countries below:\n\nPilot countries for destination inspection by KEBS are:\n\nThis segregation of zones and countries exempt from the PVoC program is one of the changes.\n\nThe PVoC Kenya certification routes remain unchanged, i.e. Routes A, B and C. Similarly, the PVoC charges stay the same.\n\nTo reinforce compliance with the PVoC program, KEBS has introduced a penalty of 5% of cost, insurance and freight (CIF), down from 15%, on any shipment from any of the countries under the PVoC mandate arriving at a Kenyan customs entry point without a Certificate of Conformity (CoC).\n\nSGS exclusively remains your one-stop-shop for inspection, label verification, marking and packaging, testing and overall PVoC services for your Kenyan market products.\n\nThe team eagerly looks forward to being of great service and support to you!\n\nLet’s keep communication ongoing!\n\nLearn more about the Kenya – PVoC Program.\n\nThis article can also be found in our PCA Newsletter (Q3/2022) – which keeps you up to date with developments in technical barriers to trade and product conformity assessment.\n\nRead more in our PCA Newsletter\n\nQ3/2022\n\nMajor information on VOC for Ivory Coast\n\nTrade and Certification: the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\nSelling to KSA: PCA update on food and drug regulations\n\nQ2/2022\n\nUpdates to SGS’s Pre-Shipment Verification of Conformity Program for the Central African Republic\n\nUnderstanding South Sudan’s New Pre-Export Verification of Conformity (PVoC) Program\n\nNew Developments in Uganda’s PVoC Program\n\nPre-shipment Verification of Conformity for Tanzania\n\nSubscribe to our PCA Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the PCA Newsletter by going to our Subscription Center, selecting Connectivity & Products at Step 1 and then the topic Government & Trade Facilitation at Step 2.\n\nFor more information, please contact:"
