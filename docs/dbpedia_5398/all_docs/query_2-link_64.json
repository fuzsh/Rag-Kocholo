        "text": "Carlo Segre\n\nChapter Affiliation\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology\n\nBackground Information\n\nCV\n\nBiography\n\nStatement\n\nThe job of the Nominating Committee is critical to the health of the Society. Selection of outstanding candidates who will serve as President and bring innovative vision to the Board and National Headquarters will serve to keep Sigma Xi viable over the long term. Over the past six years, while serving two terms as a member of the Sigma Xi Board, I have learned a great deal about the inner workings and the challenges we face, and the leadership that is required to lead the Society. I have had the good fortune to be part of many committees that serve to provide support and guidance to the Board. I believe those experiences and the knowledge I have gained learning from past presidents makes me a worthy candidate to represent the North Central Region Chapters on the Committee on Nominations to help select the future leader of the Society.\n\nSigma Xi and Other Activities: I have served as Director of the North Central Region (2016-2022), President of the IIT Chapter of Sigma Xi (2005-2016), and delegate to the annual meeting (2006), I have served two terms on the Committee on Awards, serving as Chair since 2020. I am a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on Pathways to Leadership and the Committee on Standing Rules for the 2022 International Forum on Research Excellence.\n\nI am also Director at Large, serving my first term since 2021, and Fellow of the International Center for Diffraction Data. I served as the chair of their Education Subcommittee (2005-2020) as well as member of the Scholarship Committee (2005-present) and the Meeting Support Committee (2005-present). Since 2008, I have been serving as a member of the Advanced Photon Source Beam Time Allocation Committee and from 2018-2021 as an elected member of the Advanced Photon Source User Organization Steering Committee. In addition to my administrative responsibilities as Associate Chair of the Department of Biological, Chemical and Physical Sciences (1993-1999), Associate Dean for Research of Armour College (2002-2004), Associate Dean of the Graduate College (2004-2011), and Interim Chair of the Department of Chemistry (2016-2019), my service to IIT includes being a member of the Faculty Council (1986-1988), Chair of the Research subcommittee for the National Commission for IIT (1994-1995), Chair of the University Committee on Promotion and Tenure (2008), and liaison between IIT and Argonne and Fermi National Laboratories. Since 1993, I have been the organizer of the High School Bridge Building Contest (Chair, 1993-present) which runs a large Chicago Regional contest annually and an International contest biannually on the IIT campus. Currently I am Director of IIT's Center for Synchrotron Radiation Research and Instrumentation which I helped found in 1988. In this capacity I am promoting synchrotron radiation research throughout the IIT campus."
