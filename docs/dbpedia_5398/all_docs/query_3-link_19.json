        "text": "(1905–89). Italian-born U.S. physicist Emilio Segrè was cowinner, with Owen Chamberlain of the United States, of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1959. The pair in 1955 discovered the antiproton, an antiparticle having the same mass as a proton but opposite in electrical charge.\n\nEmilio Gino Segrè was born on Feb. 1, 1905, in Tivoli, Italy. He studied under Enrico Fermi and received his doctorate in physics in 1928. In 1934 Segrè participated in neutron experiments directed by Fermi, in which many elements, including uranium, were bombarded with neutrons, and elements heavier than uranium were created. In 1935 they discovered slow neutrons, which have properties important to the operation of nuclear reactors.\n\nSegrè became director of the physics laboratory at the University of Palermo in 1936. One year later he discovered technetium, the first man-made element not found in nature. He moved to the United States in 1938 and became a research associate at the University of California at Berkeley. There he and his associates discovered the element astatine in 1940, and later, with another group, he discovered the isotope plutonium-239 (now commonly used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons). He became a U.S. citizen in 1944.\n\nSegrè spent a few years working at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico before becoming professor of physics at Berkeley from 1946 to 1972. He was appointed professor of nuclear physics at the University of Rome in 1974. Among his other accomplishments are several books on nuclear physics. Segrè died on April 22, 1989, in Lafayette, Calif."
