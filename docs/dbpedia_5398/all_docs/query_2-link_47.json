        "text": "Julie Segre, Ph. D. is a Senior Investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH. Segre received her B.A. in Mathematics from Amherst College, her PhD in Genetics from M.I.T. (advisor: Eric Lander, PhD) and postdoctoral training in skin biology at Univ. of Chicago (advisor: Elaine Fuchs, PhD). She has been an investigator at NHGRI, NIH since 2000, receiving tenure in 2007.\n\nSegre’s research has defined the normal human skin bacterial, fungal and viral communities, enabling studies of alterations associated with pediatric atopic dermatitis, primary immunodeficiency and emerging pathogens. Segre’s research also focused on integrating whole genome sequencing of hospital pathogens both to study nosocomial transmission and to develop a national reference database. Segre’s research integrates DNA sequence technology, algorithm development and clinical studies to explore the diversity of microbes in and on humans in health and disease."
