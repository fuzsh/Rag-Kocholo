        "text": "MADRID — A drought that Spanish officials are calling the worst in a century has pushed the coastal city of Barcelona to the brink of a water crisis and re-ignited a tense debate among the country's rivalrous regions about who should control the precious resource.\n\nFaced with having to ration domestic water supplies during the coming months, the regional government of Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital, plans to import drinking water by ship from as far afield as southern France and from desalination plants in southern Spain. Officials said they were even considering buying water from other parts of the country and carrying it to Barcelona by train.\n\nWith water levels in some Catalan reservoirs at 20 percent of capacity, the regional government has banned Catalans from filling large swimming pools or watering their gardens and has switched off city fountains. At a national level, Spain's reservoirs are half empty, according to data published by the Environment Ministry last week.\n\nThe quest for solutions to Barcelona's water shortage has sparked an angry debate between Catalan officials and the central government. In a country where regional interests often seem to be pitted against national ones, the crisis has revived the question of whether water should be centrally managed and whether Spain's greener provinces should share water with those that lack it.\n\nManuel Ramón Llamas, an expert in the management of water resources at the Complutense University in Madrid, said Spain's problem was not so much that it lacks water but that it manages what water it has badly and charges too little for supplies.\n\n\"Spain is the driest country in Europe, and we've become an international laughingstock on the water question,\" he said by telephone. \"Water demand here is falsely elevated because water is practically free.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
