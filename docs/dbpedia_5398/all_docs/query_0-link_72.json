        "text": "OVERVIEW & OBJECTIVES\n\nThe Academic Master in Fashion Sustainability & Industry Evolution is designed for the next generation of highly motivated, purpose-driven leaders who want to respond to the growing demand for sustainability from the industry and seek to be part of and drive the innovation needed for change.\n\nThe Master focuses on a holistic approach to sustainability that aims to balance social, environmental and economic aspects for the long-term well-being of people and the planet, while ensuring the sustainability of business operations and products.\n\nThis approach is central to the fashion industry agenda, which represents an important part of our economies and therefore needs to act to reduce its environmental and social impact. Therefore, the market needs new managerial figures able to lead the transition to new business models.\n\nThe Master provides an in-depth understanding of the macro trends that are bringing sustainability to the forefront of business priorities, in order to evolve towards a more sustainable economic model. The course integrates this technical approach by examining the entire product cycle. In addition, topics such as the sociology of cultural processes and the history of fashion, legislative developments, sustainable communication and evolving scientific fields are covered.\n\nAt the end of the Masterâ€™s in Fashion Sustainability & Industry Evolution, participants will be able to undertake a professional career within companies in the fashion sector, specializing in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and supply chain management. Furthermore, they will acquire advanced skills to work in the field of responsible innovation and will be able to act as consultants on a global level."
