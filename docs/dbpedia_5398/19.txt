Segre:

The name Segré comes from the Latin "Secretum" which means "isolated". From the earliest times, houses exist in Segré. In a site of rivers and hills, the tribes settle.

In the 10th century, the Count of Anjou Foulques le Roux built a first castle on the schistose spur overlooking the two rivers. It is then a wooden dungeon raised on a mound of earth: a feudal mound that can still be seen today.

In the eleventh century, stone gradually replaced the wood. In Segré, a new castle, with a fortified enclosure is built under Fulk the Black. It will be taken in 1066 by the troops of Conan II, Duke of Brittany.

In 1191, Richard the Lionheart, Count of Anjou and King of England, confiscated the lands of Segré to Geoffroy de la Guerche to form the estate of his wife, Bérangère de Navarre.

In 1490, the city was once again destroyed by bands of looters ravaging all of Haut-Anjou.

In 1589, the Count de Rochepot, governor of Anjou, in the name of King Henry III, seized Segre which was until then in the hands of the leaguers. After plundering the city, he dismantled the castle and the walls and all the fortified manors of the country.

In 1635, the land of Segré was erected in barony for the benefit of a protege of Richelieu, William II de Bautru, lord of Louvaines.

In 1795, 2000 Chouans invade the city defended by 200 Republican soldiers. After 4 hours of fight, the Blues surrender. The city is ransacked and 33 Republican prisoners are slaughtered.

In the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Segré experienced a sharp demographic increase since the number of inhabitants increased from 700 in 1841 to 2894 in 1878, to 3551 in 1891 and 4874 in 1939. This increase is due, among other things, to the from the commune of Saint Aubin du Pavoil, to the development of the railway network, to the industrial expansion: iron ore and slate.

In 30 years, Segré has a diversified industry.
