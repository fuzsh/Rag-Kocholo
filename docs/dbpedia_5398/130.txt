Daniel Segr√© is a professor at the bioinformatics program at Boston University. He is also involved in the Department of Biology, Department of Biomedical Engineering, and also the Department of Physics. Some of his interests are Regulation of metabolism, Epistasis, and evolution.

Research

We develop theoretical approaches and computational models for the study of complex biological networks. We are especially interested in the dynamics and evolution of metabolism, whose complex web of small-molecule transformations underlies fundamental aspects of biological organization, from energy transduction to cell-cell communication. In addition to helping understand how biological systems function and evolve, we seek to apply our methods to the design and optimization of engineered networks for bioenergy and biomedicine applications.
