        "text": "Australiaâ€™s national Transcatheter valve therapy conference at Sydney was a delight to be part of. Absolutely honoured to be an invited international faculty and represent India at Sydney Valves. Thanks to Dr Rohan Bagwandeen and Dr Sydney Lo for putting together a great valve therapy extravaganza. Amazing discussions on bail-outs and Transcatheter mitral valve therapies. Great fun catching up with friends and colleagues. Looking forward to having our Australian friends at India Valves 2024 at Chennai, India. #SydneyValves #TAVR #TAVI #structuralheart #RohanBagwandeen #SydneyLo #IndiaValves #India #IndiaValves2024 #IndiaValves #cardiologist #Sydney #medicalconference\n\nAn absolute delight and honour to be an international faculty at Singapore Valves where I learnt a lot from our lovely Singapore colleagues. Had the pleasure of presenting Transcaval access for TAVR and TMVR therapies from India. Excellent meeting and looking forward to a great collaboration between Sing Valves and India Valves 2024. Thanks to Ho Kay Woon and Jonathan Yap for the kind invitation. #IndiaValves #SingaporeValves #TAVR #TAVI #TMVR #MAC #Cardiology #Singapore\n\nMilestone in Cardiac Intervention for India: SESAME (SEptal Scoring Along Midline Endocardium) ðŸŒŸ We recently reached a pivotal moment in treating Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction in India with the successful application of the SESAME technique in a challenging case. A 65-year-old patient, with a complex medical history including HOCM, ICD for NSVT, and previous carcinoma thyroid, found no relief from conventional treatments. With no viable options for Alcohol Septal Ablation due to lack of septal targets, we turned to SESAME. This intervention was meticulously planned using CT scans to guide the trajectory for septal scoring, showcasing our team's innovative approach to overcoming anatomical challenges. SESAME proves to be a beacon of hope for patients at high risk for surgical myotomy/myomectomy and those facing potential LVOT obstruction post-TMVR, in addition to LAMPOON candidates. Over the past three years, since 2020, we have pioneered four electrosurgery techniques adopted from NHLB, contributing significantly to national cardiac care advancements. This achievement was made possible through the collaborative efforts of our team and the invaluable support from The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLB), especially the groundbreaking work from Robert Ledermanâ€™s lab. This case underscores our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in cardiac care in India, offering new horizons for high-risk patients. #Cardiology #Innovation #Electrosurgery #SESAME #HOCM #PatientCare #MedicalAdvancements #TAVI #TAVR #TMVR #IndiaValves #InterventionalCardiology #LVOTObstruction #Lampoon #Basilica #Transcaval #RobertLederman #LondonValves"
