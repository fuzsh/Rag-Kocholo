        "text": "Carrier Free\n\nWhat does CF mean?\n\nCF stands for Carrier Free (CF). We typically add Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a carrier protein to our recombinant proteins. Adding a carrier protein enhances protein stability, increases shelf-life, and allows the recombinant protein to be stored at a more dilute concentration. The carrier free version does not contain BSA.\n\nWhat formulation is right for me?\n\nIn general, we advise purchasing the recombinant protein with BSA for use in cell or tissue culture, or as an ELISA standard. In contrast, the carrier free protein is recommended for applications, in which the presence of BSA could interfere.\n\n236-EG\n\nFormulation Lyophilized from a 0.2 μm filtered solution in PBS.

EGF is the founding member of the EGF family that also includes TGF-alpha, amphiregulin (AR), betacellulin (BTC), epiregulin (EPR), heparin‑binding EGF‑like growth factor (HB‑EGF), epigen, and the neuregulins (NRG)-1 through -6 (1). Members of The EGF family are characterized by a shared structural motif, the EGF‑like domain, which contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds that are formed by six similarly spaced, conserved cysteine residues (2). These disulfide bonds are essential for proper protein conformation and receptor binding. All EGF family members are synthesized as type I transmembrane precursor proteins that may contain several EGF domains in the extracellular region. The mature proteins are released from the cell surface by regulated proteolysis (1). The full length EGF protein is 1207 amino acids (aa) (EGF precursor) containing nine EGF domains and nine LDLR class B repeats. However, the mature protein is much smaller, only 53 aa, and is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the EGF domain proximal to the transmembrane region (3). EGF is well conserved across mammals with mature human EGF 70% identical to mature mouse and rat EGF. Physiologically, EGF is found in various body fluids, including blood, milk, urine, saliva, seminal fluid, pancreatic juice, cerebrospinal fluid, and amniotic fluid (4). EGF is a high affinity ligand of the EGF receptor (ErbB). Four ErbB (HER) family receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR/ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4, mediate responses to EGF family members (5). EGF binding induces dimerization of the EGF receptor resulting in activation of the protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. These receptors undergo a complex pattern of ligand-induced homo- or hetero-dimerization to transduce EGF family signals (6, 7). EGF binds ErbB1 and depending on the context, induces the formation of homodimers or heterodimers containing ErbB2. Dimerization results in autophosphorylation of the receptor at specific tyrosine residues to create docking sites for a variety of signaling molecules (5, 8). Biological activities ascribed to EGF include epithelial development, angiogenesis, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, fibroblast proliferation, and colony formation of epidermal cells in culture.\n\nHarris, R.C. et al.
