        "meta_description": "Transgenic rats with inducible expression of the mouse Ren2 gene were used to elucidate mechanisms leading to the development of hypertension and renal injury. Ren2 transgene activation was induced by administration of a naturally occurring aryl hydrocarbon, indole-3-carbinol (100 mg/kg/day by gastric gavage). Blood pressure and renal parameters were recorded in both conscious and anesthetized (butabarbital sodium; 120 mg/kg IP) rats at selected time-points during the development of hypertension. Hypertension was evident by the second day of treatment, being preceded by reduced renal sodium excretion due to activation of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride co-transporter. Renal injury was evident after the first day of transgene induction, being initially limited to the pre-glomerular vasculature. Mircoalbuminuria and tubuloinsterstitial injury developed once hypertension was established. Chronic treatment with either hydrochlorothiazide or an AT1 receptor antagonist normalized sodium reabsorption, significantly blunted hypertension and prevented renal injury. Urinary aldosterone excretion was increased ∼20 fold, but chronic mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism with spironolactone neither restored natriuretic capacity nor prevented hypertension. Spironolactone nevertheless ameliorated vascular damage and prevented albuminuria. This study finds activation of sodium-chloride co-transport to be a key mechanism in angiotensin II-dependent hypertension. Furthermore, renal vascular injury in this setting reflects both barotrauma and pressure-independent pathways associated with direct detrimental effects of angiotensin II and aldosterone.",

        "text": "Activation of the cyp1a1-Ren2 transgene promotes anti-natriuresis\n\nUnder anaesthesia, we observed a progressive increase in mean arterial blood pressure (Figure 2A, ANOVA P<0.001) with repeated doses of I3C, with a small but significant rise being observed on day 2 of Ren2 induction. Glomerular filtration rate rose significantly, at least until day 4 (Figure 2B; ANOVA P<0.01) but then fell back to control levels. Effective renal plasma flow (Table 1) was stable. In consequence, filtration fraction was elevated only on day 4 and renal vascular resistance only on day 8(Table 1). Transgene induction reduced natriuretic capacity (Figure 2C; ANOVA P<0.001), with sodium excretion falling to ∼50% of control values by day 2. There was a significant linear trend toward hypokalaemia (P<0.05), despite which fractional potassium excretion remained robust (Table 1).\n\nA) mean arterial blood pressure (MABP); B) glomerular filtration rate (GFR); C) urinary sodium excretion and D) the fractional excretion of lithium. Measurements were made in cyp1a1-Ren2 transgenic rats, on either day 2 (n = 9), 4 (n = 9) or 8 (n = 9) in the induction regimen. Non-induced rats (n = 8) served as control. Data are mean ± SE. Statistical comparisons were made using ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. ***P<0.001, **P<0.01, *P<0.05 versus the control group.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036311.g002\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036311.t001\n\nFractional sodium excretion fell (Table 1) with transgene induction, indicating a tubular origin for the antinatriuresis. We attempted to localize this effect by measuring the fractional excretion of lithium excretion (Figure 2D). This was initially elevated (ANOVA P<0.01), indicating diminution of proximal tubular reabsorption and localizing the antinatriuretic effect to more distal nephron segments.\n\nIn conscious rats, sodium intake (initially 2.38±0.11 mmol/24 h), declined over the induction period but this was not statistically significant until the final day (1.38±0.17 mmol/24 h; P<0.01). Body weight was found not to change significantly, with end-weight being 96.5±1.2% of start weight. 24 h urinary aldosterone excretion was increased ∼20 fold over the induction period (Figure 3 ANOVA P<0.001) and we therefore focused our experiments on the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN). Sodium-chloride co-transport (NCC, Slc12a3) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC, Scnn1) account for the majority of sodium transport in the ASDN and the contribution of each was assessed pharmacologically. At baseline, thiazide-sensitive transport was responsible for the reabsorption of ∼5% of the filtered sodium load. This increased progressively during Ren2-transgene induction (Figure 4A; ANOVA P<0.01), as did abundance of total NCC protein relative to GAPDH (Figure 4B; ANOVA P<0.001). A positive correlation (Pearson r = 0.60; P<0.01) was observed between NCC protein abundance and thiazide-sensitive sodium reabsorption. An amiloride-sensitive pathway reabsorbed ∼2% of the filtered sodium in non-induced rats. There was a slight initial increase in both amiloride-sensitive sodium reabsorption (Figure 4C) and in the abundance of αENaC relative to GAPDH (Figure 4D). Although neither reached statistical significance, both sets of data suggest a similar trend- a transient rise, with both back to baseline by day 8.\n\nUrine was collected from conscious cyp1a1-Ren2 transgenic rats (n = 8) maintained in individual metabolism cages, over consecutive days of transgene induction. Data are mean ± SE. Statistical comparisons were made using ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. ***P<0.001, **P<0.01 versus the control day.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036311.g003\n\nA) hydrochlorthiazide-sensitive sodium reabsorption (ΔthiazideNa); B) the expression of the thiazide-sensitive co-transporter protein (NCC) in whole kidney extracts, normalized to that of GAPDH; C) amiloride-sensitive sodium reabsorption (ΔamilorideNa); D) the expression of the α subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (αENaC) normalized to that of GAPDH. Measurements were made in cyp1a1-Ren2 transgenic rats, on either day 2 (n = 9), 4 (n = 9) or 8 (n = 9) in the induction regimen. Non-induced rats (n = 8) served as control. E) mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and F) fractional sodium excretion. Measurements were made in cyp1a1-Ren2 transgenic rats receiving either vehicle (grey bar) or hydrochrorothaizide (hatched bar) by minipump. Data are mean ± SE. Statistical comparisons were made using ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. P<0.001, **P<0.01, *P<0.05 versus the control group.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036311.g004\n\nThe role of NCC-mediated sodium reabsorption was assessed by chronically administering thiazide during transgene induction. The blood pressure increase was significantly attenuated (Figure 4E), but still remained significantly higher than control animals. The partial rescue of the hypertensive phenotype was associated with a large increase in fractional sodium excretion (Figure 4F). An acute bolus of hydrochlorothiazide produced no further natriuretic effect (data not shown), confirming that NCC blockade was complete at the chronic infusion level.\n\nHypertension, sodium reabsorption and thiazide-sensitive co-transport\n\nThe synergistic effect of angiotensin II and sodium intake on blood pressure has long been known but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Angiotensin II promotes sodium retention and volume expansion, particularly if sodium intake is high [17], [18], [19]. However, a strong correlation between sodium balance and blood pressure is not a consistent feature [19], [20], perhaps because increased renal arterial pressure can stimulate natriuresis [21]. Sustained hypertension may also reflect salt-induced sensitization of the sympathetic nervous system [22] and vascular smooth muscle [23] to angiotensin II.\n\nPrevious studies in cyp1a1-Ren2 TGR have demonstrated that hypertension is associated with enhanced sodium reabsorption [6] and the rise in blood pressure is aggravated by dietary sodium-loading [5]. In the current study, sodium intake was lower by ∼10% over days 1–4 of transgene induction and reduced by 40% by the final day. This might contribute to a reduced sodium excretion, particularly in rats studied after 8 days of hypertension. Nevertheless, body weight was stable and in the cross-sectional studies plasma sodium was not changed. In this setting we observed an impaired capacity to excrete an intravenous saline load. In the proximal tubule, angiotensin II exerts a biphasic effect on sodium transport, becoming inhibitory at high concentrations [24], [25]. In our study, the increase in fractional lithium excretion observed at days 2 and 4 indicates a reduction in proximal tubule sodium reabsorption [26] and localizes the antinatriuresis to more distal nephron segments. Since mice infused chronically with angiotensin II display increased sodium reabsorption in the ASDN [27], we probed the function of this region with inhibitors of the major pathways for sodium transport, ENaC and NCC. Both angiotensin II and aldosterone can stimulate ENaC activity [13], [28] but we found the amiloride-sensitive pathway small and not greatly influenced by transgene induction. There was perhaps a trend towards an increase in both amiloride-sensitive transport and αENaC protein abundance but this normalized by day 8. Our protocol ultimately causes malignant hypertension after ∼14 days [4]. In contrast, when induction is aimed at producing a non-malignant stable hypertension, chronic amiloride treatment causes a transiently negative sodium balance and abolishes hypertension in cyp1a1-Ren2 TGR [3], even though ENaC mRNA levels do not change. It is plausible that that modest increases in angiotensin II activate existing pools of ENaC and the resulting increase in blood pressure is amiloride-sensitive. However, when angiotensin II levels are increased further, a sustained increase in NCC activity is observed. The increased sodium reabsorption in the DCT would reduce sodium delivery to the collecting duct and thereby limit amiloride-sensitive sodium transport. Under such circumstances, hypertension would be expected to be mainly thiazide-sensitive (Figure 4E). The thiazide-resistant component in the present study was small (Figure 4E) and may be due to the transiently increased ENaC activity, uncovered when NCC is inhibited.\n\nThiazides are considered to be selective inhibitors of transport by NCC, but recently it has been shown that they also inhibit sodium reabsorption through Slc4A8 in the collecting duct [29]. However, the strong positive correlation between NCC abundance and thiazide-sensitive sodium reabsorption suggests that transport through Slc4A8 plays only a minor role in our studies.\n\nIn order to be physiologically active, NCC must be phosphorylated on threonine and serine residues in a regulatory domain in the N-terminus [30], [31], and it must be correctly trafficked to the apical membrane of the DCT. In our study, we did not measure NCC phosphorylation or define localization to a specific sub-cellular compartment. Measurements of NCC phosphorylation are increasingly used as a surrogates for those of transport, yet evidence suggests that although phosphorylation is necessary, it is not sufficient, to explain transport activation in cation-chloride co-transporters [32]. Thus, we consider that the increase in total NCC expression, which paralleled the blood pressure rise, was more than sufficient to account for the increased thiazide-sensitive sodium reabsorption observed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that both angiotensin II and aldosterone can independently increase NCC-mediated sodium transport in the DCT [12], [33], [34], [35], [36]. Our data show that the activation of NCC occurs via AT1R as losartan caused a natriuresis and fully normalized NCC activity. In contrast, spironolactone, at levels sufficient to achieve complete mineralocorticoid receptor blockade [37], had no effect on thiazide-sensitive sodium reabsorption or blood pressure. MR activation does not therefore appear to be major factor in our model, consistent with some previous studies [3], [6], [27], but contrasting with others [38]. It is also reported that hypertension per se reduces NCC expression in the apical membrane of the DCT [39]. We cannot discount a countervailing influence of hypertension on NCC activity, but our data indicate that the overall outcome was an angiotensin II-mediated increase in thiazide-sensitive sodium transport.\n\nChronic infusion of either hydrochlorothiazide or losartan was an effective antihypertensive measure. Both treatments also increased fractional sodium excretion, implying that renal sodium retention is a key hypertensive mechanism in this model. In support of this hypothesis, reciprocal transplantation studies in AT1AR null and wild-type mice show that renal AT1R mediate the chronic hypertensive effects of angiotensin II infusion by promoting renal sodium reabsorption [40]. However, in our study there was a trend towards volume contraction as blood pressure rose, suggesting that the effects of angiotensin II and dietary salt on blood pressure do not necessarily reflect volume expansion here [19], [20]. Indeed, other studies indicate that the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics in angiotensin II-dependent hypertension is not exclusively related to depletion of plasma volume [19] and thiazides might have beneficial effects on vascular resistance [41].\n\nRenal function in anaesthetized rats\n\nSeparate cohorts of cyp1a1-Ren2 TGRs received I3C for either 1, 3 or 7 days; the control group (n = 8) received an equivalent volume of vegetable oil over a 7-day period. Time-points are designated as control (n = 8), day 2 (n = 9); day 4 ( = 9) and day 8 (n = 9). In each group, mean arterial blood pressure and renal function were measured twenty-four hours after the final gavage treatment, as follows. Following thiobutabarbital anaesthesia (Inactin, 120 mg/kg IP; Sigma Aldrich UK), a cannula was inserted into the right jugular vein through which a solution, containing (in mmol/l): 120 NaCl, 10 LiCl, 15 NaHCO3 and 5 KCl, was infused (1 ml/h/100 g IV). The infusate also contained 0.5% p-amino hippuric acid (PAH) and 0.5% FITC-inulin. A cannula, containing heparin-saline, was placed in the right carotid artery for collection of blood and measurement of mean arterial blood pressure. The bladder was catheterized for collection of urine and a tracheostomy was performed to maintain a clear airway.\n\nOne hour after the completion of surgery, rats underwent the following protocol: three consecutive collections of urine were made, each of 60 minutes. A sample (75 µl) of arterial blood was drawn at the start and then after each urine collection period for the measurement of haematocrit, FITC-inulin and PAH.\n\nAfter the first urine collection, amiloride was administered (2 mg/kg bolus; 2 mg/kg/h infusion). After the second urine collection, hydrochlorothiazide was administered (2 mg/kg bolus; 2 mg/kg/h infusion) alongside the amiloride. The drugs were delivered in a DMSO vehicle (2% v∶v), which, in a separate group of rats (n = 7), had no effect on renal function or blood pressure (data not shown). Finally, a 1 ml sample of arterial blood was taken for measurement of plasma electrolytes and the kidneys frozen at −80°C and used for Western blot. Animals were then killed by an overdose of anaesthetic."
