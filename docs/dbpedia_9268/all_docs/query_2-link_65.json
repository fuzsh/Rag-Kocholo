        "text": "The CESTour Conference 2024 at Birla Institute of Management Technology (BIMTECH), focusing on \"Navigating the Future of Sustainable Tourism\" just concluded. It has been a unique opportunity to listen to the results of many interesting research studies, ranging from the development of indicators for measuring the impacts of climate change on tourism to the comparative analysis of tourism policies at a national and international level. The Conference was also the opportunity to unveil the volume \"Sustainable Development in South Asia Tourism\", a collaborative effort co-edited with emma zavarrone. The book features contributions from all partner universities of the #CESTour project: FH Joanneum, University of Alicante, IULM University, Birla Institute of Management and Technology, Institute of Public Enterprise, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, Tribhuvan University, Global College International, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka, and Uva Wellassa University. The primary aim of the CESTour project, funded by the European Union through Erasmus+ Capacity Building in Higher Education, is to install centres of excellence for sustainable tourism at seven universities in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The collaborative efforts of the partners have resulted in the creation of educational programs, faculty and student enrichment, the development of practical cases, and the establishment of academic and industrial networks to foster the growth of centres of excellence over time. The Work Package led by #IULMUniversity focused in particular on enhancing collaboration between tourism businesses and partner universities, involving students from the centres in case of challenges on sustainable tourism. Led by academic mentors and the business world, students developed and analyzed a series of products, services, and experiences for sustainable tourism in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, crafting a compendium of best practices, enriched further by scholarly contributions from Rahul Singh, Friedl Harald A. and Oana M. Driha. #SustainableTourism #CESTourProject #India #Nepal #Srilanka\n\nReflecting on his secondary school days in Ankara, Erdin√ß √áakmak, a lecturer and researcher in Tourism at Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUas), has always been fascinated by paradoxes. His research within BUas‚Äô Centre for Sustainability, Tourism, and Transport explores the contradictory nature of human behavior and tourism ecosystems. Erdin√ß √áakmak explores paradoxes to deepen our understanding of tourism's complexities, promoting progress by embracing contradictions. His research on sustainable tourism practices aims to balance economic benefits with environmental and social well-being, challenging the assumption that formal and informal tourism economies are mutually exclusive. Findings from Thailand reveal these sectors grow together, impacting policy development. As coordinator of the Tourism Destination Management master‚Äôs programme, √áakmak incorporates these paradoxes into the curriculum, inspiring creative problem-solving in students.

It was established by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) to highlight the significance of tourism and its impact on individuals, communities, and nations. To recognize and celebrate the multifaceted importance of tourism - a very special event was organized with G√∂kku≈üaƒüƒ± Beylikd√ºz√º Campus high school students by visiting the most touristic places in Istanbul. In this trip, our students got the chance to learn about history, art, and heritage by reading magnificent works in three major sections in ƒ∞stanbul Archaeological Museum. It has been a great pleasure for us to see our students discovering the richness of the world's cultures once more, which are essential for global harmony in our global society. At the end of the trip our students highlighted the importance of aligning tourism with the SDGs to encourage the development of eco-friendly practices and minimize the negative impacts in popular tourist destinations in Istanbul such as Gulhana Park and Hagia Sophia. As we all know tourism has negative impacts too, and these are often referred to as \"damages caused by tourism\". We are world changers believe that Sustainable tourism practices and community involvement can help mitigate negative effects and promote tourism that is more environmentally and socially responsible. That is why, our students carried out this a 5-day project to raise awareness regarding higher levels of pollution, including air and water pollution, and improper disposal of waste in peak periods of tourism. Dividing into groups of 3, they first observed the damages caused by tourism by wearing their GLOBAL VISION GLASSES, then presented their worksheets and offered alternative solutions to spread awareness in our school community. I want to extend my thanks to all the faculty of Gokkusagi Schools Beylukduzu Branch, art teachers, and organizers who worked tirelessly to make this opportunity possible. Your guidance and support in making this project has been so meaningful. We all have learned not only about the subject matter but also about the importance of diligence, creativity, perseverance and overall approach to learning and problem-solving. #sdggoals #globalschools #climatechange #sdg13 #sustainableliving #worldchangers #globalgoalsproject #tourism #pollution\n\nüåç New Standard for Sustainable Tourism in Spain!
