        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis is the first report detailing the vitamin D status of children with PIMS-TS requiring hospitalisation, highlighting the alarmingly high proportion of deficiency. PIMS-TS was predominant in children of BAME origin, with 81 % being vitamin D deficient. A high proportion of the whole cohort (72 %) and specifically PICU cohort (83 %) were vitamin D deficient. Children with PIMS-TS had significantly lower mean 25OHD concentrations compared with the nationally representative healthy White British and BAME children; however, there was no association with disease severity.\n\nSuboptimal vitamin D status has been reported in around 50 % of critically ill children in a previous systematic review and meta-analysis(Reference McNally, Nama and O’Hearn18). We, however, noted suboptimal 25OHD levels in 100 % of our PICU group, probably due to the higher proportion of BAME individuals. The limited National Diet and Nutrition Survey data on BAME individuals in the UK also report a higher proportion of vitamin D deficiency (42·9 %; n 63) in comparison with White children (15·0 %, n 448)(Reference Cashman16). It is noteworthy that all children of BAME origin with PIMS-TS had suboptimal vitamin D status. A higher prevalence of PIMS-TS with disproportionate number of intensive care admissions of children from BAME background has been reported in the UK(Reference Whittaker, Bamford and Kenny5,Reference Davies, Evans and Kanthimathinathan19) Similarly, hypocalcaemic complications of vitamin D deficiency(Reference Basatemur and Sutcliffe20), including nutritional rickets(Reference Julies, Lynn and Pall21), are also 90–166-fold higher in UK Black and Asian children when compared with their White counterparts(Reference Uday and Högler22).\n\nThe increased risk of acute viral respiratory infections with vitamin D deficiency and the potential protective effects of supplementation has been extensively reported(Reference Martineau, Jolliffe and Hooper23). Nonetheless, currently there remains insufficient evidence to recommend routine supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections(24) or COVID-19(9). Evidence on the link between 25OHD status and SARS-CoV-2 continues to emerge, with suggestion of an inverse relationship between circulating 25OHD levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity(Reference Kaufman, Niles and Kroll25). The relevance of vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor in severe PIMS-TS due to its actions on unregulated cytokine response requires further consideration. Consistent evidence of PIMS-TS being mediated by amplified inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the regulatory actions of 25OHD on pro-inflammatory cytokine signalling further substantiates the possible role of 25OHD in PIMS-TS. This hypothesis is strengthened by the association of low 25OHD with Kawasaki’s disease(Reference Stagi, Rigante and Lepri26), a childhood inflammatory disease with which PIMS-TS shares considerable overlap(Reference Brown27). 25OHD levels in Kawasaki’s disease have previously been linked to coronary outcomes which may be of relevance in children affected with PIMS-TS(Reference Stagi, Rigante and Lepri26). Given that nearly 14 % of the UK population are of BAME origin and are at a high risk of vitamin D deficiency(Reference Uday and Högler28), ongoing evaluation of the putative link between ethnicity, severe COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency is essential. Randomised controlled trials in the community would be required to establish a causative link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19.\n\nThere was no link between 25OHD concentrations and disease severity in our cohort, but our study was not adequately powered to evaluate such a relationship. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 or related conditions. Nonetheless, the finding of widespread deficiency in the BAME population cannot be disregarded. Suboptimal vitamin D status in UK residents(Reference Bates, Lennox and Prentice29), especially its BAME residents, is a long-standing problem(Reference Uday and Högler28,Reference Bivins30) which warrants intervention. Older children and adolescents where there is a higher prevalence of severe COVID-19 and PIMS-TS are also reported to be at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency(Reference Absoud, Cummins and Lim15,Reference Cashman16) . A number of factors need addressing to improve the vitamin D status of the UK population. Firstly, the threshold for sufficiency in the UK is set as ≥ 25 nmol/l(17), whereas other institutes(Reference Ross, Manson and Abrams13) and consensus guidance(Reference Munns, Shaw and Kiely31) regard levels > 50 nmol/l as sufficiency and < 30 nmol/l as deficiency. Secondly, the recommended vitamin D requirement for children > 1 year in the UK is lower (10 µg or 400 IU daily) than that supported by other evidence-based guidance (15 µg or 600 IU daily)(Reference Ross, Manson and Abrams13,Reference Munns, Shaw and Kiely31) . Thirdly, less than a third of this lower recommended intake is met through diet in UK children(Reference Bates, Lennox and Prentice29) due to the lack of widespread mandatory food fortification(Reference Uday and Högler28,Reference Aguiar, Andronis and Pallan32) . Last but not the least, the uptake of vitamin D supplements in UK infants and children is also very low at < 20 %(Reference Jessiman, Cameron and Wiggins33) due to poor policy implementation(Reference Uday, Kongjonaj and Aguiar34). Hence, the UK has a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared with other countries at comparable latitude with similar proportions of BAME population(Reference Cashman16). Robust vitamin D supplementation of all high-risk groups has no notable side effects and is a safe option irrespective of the link. At-risk individuals should be reminded of the need for supplementation at each healthcare contact(Reference Uday, Kongjonaj and Aguiar34).\n\nOur study was limited by the small sample size given the rarity of the condition. Nonetheless, the data provided are of paramount public health importance. The chronicity of vitamin D deficiency was not known due to the unavailability of parathyroid hormone levels and the concurrent presence of hypophosphatasemia related to the acute insult(Reference McKiernan, Shrestha and Berg35). However, the prevalence of deficiency reported here mirrors data from other studies of predominantly BAME populations(Reference Das, Crocombe and McGrath36,Reference Darling, Hart and MacDonald37) , yet again highlighting the importance of supplementing high-risk individuals and adoption of long-term strategies such as food fortification, as a cost-effective way of optimising population vitamin D status(Reference Aguiar, Andronis and Pallan38).\n\nConclusions\n\nPIMS-TS has seen an over-representation of children from BAME background, who are also at greatest risk of vitamin D deficiency. In view of the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in our PIMS-TS cohort, we call for mandated, year-round vitamin D supplementation of all high-risk children and adolescents. Food fortification with vitamin D should be strongly considered as a long-term strategy."
