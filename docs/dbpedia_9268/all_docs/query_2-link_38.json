        "text": "Carrier Free\n\nWhat does CF mean?\n\nCF stands for Carrier Free (CF). We typically add Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a carrier protein to our recombinant proteins. Adding a carrier protein enhances protein stability, increases shelf-life, and allows the recombinant protein to be stored at a more dilute concentration. The carrier free version does not contain BSA.\n\nWhat formulation is right for me?\n\nIn general, we advise purchasing the recombinant protein with BSA for use in cell or tissue culture, or as an ELISA standard. In contrast, the carrier free protein is recommended for applications, in which the presence of BSA could interfere.\n\n220-BB\n\nFormulation Lyophilized from a 0.2 μm filtered solution in Acetonitrile and TFA. Reconstitution Reconstitute at 100 μg/mL in sterile 4 mM HCl. Shipping The product is shipped at ambient temperature. Upon receipt, store it immediately at the temperature recommended below. Stability & Storage: Use a manual defrost freezer and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n\n12 months from date of receipt, -20 to -70 °C as supplied.\n\n1 month, 2 to 8 °C under sterile conditions after reconstitution.\n\n3 months, -20 to -70 °C under sterile conditions after reconstitution.\n\nBackground: PDGF-BB\n\nPlatelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was discovered as a major mitogenic factor present in serum but absent from plasma. It was found to be secreted from the alpha ‑granules of platelets activated during the coagulation of blood to form serum. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that PDGF is not one molecule but three, each a dimeric combination of two distinct but structurally related peptide chains designated A and B. The dimeric isoforms PDGF-AA, AB and BB are differentially expressed in various cell types and their effects are mediated through two distinct receptors, termed alpha and beta. Differences exist in isoform binding to each receptor. In general, PDGF isoforms are potent mitogens for connective tissue cells, including dermal fibroblasts, glial cells, arterial smooth muscle cells and some epithelial and endothelial cells. In addition to its activity as a mitogen, PDGF is chemotactic for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, neutrophils and mononuclear cells. Other reported activities for PDGF include stimulation of granule release by neutrophils and monocytes, facilitation of steroid synthesis by Leydig cells, stimulation of neutrophil phagocytosis, inhibition of natural killer (NK) cell activity, stimulation of collagen synthesis, modulation of thrombospondin expression and secretion, stimulation of collagenase activity and secretion, induction of contraction of rat aorta strips in vitro, and transient induction of T cell IL-2 secretion accompanied by a down-regulation of IL-4 and IFN-gamma production, temporary effects that may allow clonal expansion of antigen-activated B and T helper lymphocytes prior to differentiation. PDGF also appears to be ubiquitous in neurons throughout the CNS, where it is suggested to play an important role in neuron survival and regeneration, and in mediation of glial cell proliferation and differentiation.\n\nLong Name\n\nPlatelet-derived Growth Factor BB\n\nEntrez Gene IDs\n\n5155 (Human); 24628 (Rat)\n\nAlternate Names\n\nc-sis;IBGC5;PDGF2;PDGF-2;PDGFB;Platelet-derived growth factor subunit B;SIS;SSV; PDGFBB; PDGF-BB"
