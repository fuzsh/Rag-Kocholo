The specific botanicals women take vary as a function of age. Younger women will use botanicals for urinary tract infections, especially Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry), where there is evidence for efficacy. Botanical dietary supplements for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are less commonly used, and rigorous clinical trials have not been done. Some examples include Vitex agnus-castus (chasteberry), Angelica sinensis (dong quai), Viburnum opulus/prunifolium (cramp bark and black haw), and Zingiber officinale (ginger). Pregnant women have also used ginger for relief from nausea. Natural galactagogues for lactating women include Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) and Silybum marianum (milk thistle); however, rigorous safety and efficacy studies are lacking. Older women suffering menopausal symptoms are increasingly likely to use botanicals, especially since the Women’s Health Initiative showed an increased risk for breast cancer associated with traditional hormone therapy. Serotonergic mechanisms similar to antidepressants have been proposed for Actaea/Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh) and Valeriana officinalis (valerian). Plant extracts with estrogenic activities for menopausal symptom relief include Glycine max (soy), Trifolium pratense (red clover), Pueraria lobata (kudzu), Humulus lupulus (hops), Glycyrrhiza species (licorice), Rheum rhaponticum (rhubarb), Vitex agnus-castus (chasteberry), Linum usitatissimum (flaxseed), Epimedium species (herba Epimedii, horny goat weed), and Medicago sativa (alfalfa). Some of the estrogenic botanicals have also been shown to have protective effects against osteoporosis. Several of these botanicals could have additional breast cancer preventive effects linked to hormonal, chemical, inflammatory, and/or epigenetic pathways. Finally, although botanicals are perceived as natural safe remedies, it is important for women and their healthcare providers to realize that they have not been rigorously tested for potential toxic effects and/or drug/botanical interactions. Understanding the mechanism of action of these supplements used for women’s health will ultimately lead to standardized botanical products with higher efficacy, safety, and chemopreventive properties.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA. Women’s Health as a Function of Age\n\nWomen’s health and wellbeing are profoundly affected by hormone levels, which can vary dramatically with age, as shown for estrogen in . In addition, older women are more susceptible to illnesses such as cancer, cardiotoxicity, and neurodegenerative diseases (Abouzahr, 2014; de la Cruz et al., 2014; Alzheimer's Association, 2014). These illnesses are stimulated by inflammation as well as exogenous and endogenous stressors (Clark and Vissel, 2013; Wright et al., 2013; Djaldetti and Bessler, 2014; Ren and Xu, 2015). Hormone balance is crucial to stabilizing women’s physiology, because hormones control vital biological functions including cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, reproductive, cerebral, and immune systems. The two main sex hormones in women are estrogen and progesterone ( ). Estrogen is synthesized in the ovaries and adipose tissue and is responsible for secondary sex characteristics and cell growth. Progesterone balances estrogen’s proliferative effect. Hormonal imbalance can lead to several health issues such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, breast cancer, and osteoporosis. It is now recognized that women’s healthcare must take aging and hormone balance into consideration for quality of life and prevention of disease (Morris and Currie, 2013). However, many women have lost faith in conventional pharmaceuticals because of confusion in recommendations as well as distrust in the medical system that seems to view natural aging and menopause in particular as diseases (Taylor, 2015). This review will focus on women’s health botanicals as natural alternatives to traditional pharmaceutical therapies used by premenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal women.\n\nB. Pharmaceutical Treatments\n\n1. Premenstrual Syndrome.\n\nA wide range of pharmacological approaches are available to treat premenstrual syndrome (PMS), including oral contraceptives (birth control pills), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), dopamine agonists, diuretic agents, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (Kelderhouse and Taylor, 2013; Imai et al., 2015) ( ). Birth control pills are effective remedies for premenopausal women to relieve menstrual cramping as well as preventing pregnancy. They suppress ovulation and thin the endometrial lining, which reduces menstrual fluid volume along with prostaglandin levels, which in turn decreases the pain associated with uterine contractions (Creatsas et al., 1990; Zahradnik et al., 2010). Side effects include nausea, water retention, and weight gain and birth control pills may not be suitable for some women, especially those wanting to become pregnant. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen ( ) reduce myometrial activity by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and reducing vasopressin secretion; however, the failure rate is often 25% and many women cannot tolerate NSAIDs due to side effects that can include bleeding, ulcers, vomiting, and diarrhea (Zahradnik et al., 2010). SSRIs have demonstrated efficacy for treating PMS in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (Marjoribanks et al., 2013); however, significant side effects have been reported particularly in the beginning of treatment including headache, nausea, insomnia, fatigue, diarrhea, dizziness, sexual side effects, and reduced concentration (Freeman, 2010).\n\n2. Urinary Tract Infections.\n\nMost uncomplicated urinary tract infections are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder where the infection develops (Little et al., 2010). Women tend to have more frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. UTIs are usually treated with sulfa drugs and antibiotics ( ). The major problem with excessive antibiotic use, particularly to treat recurring UTIs, is development of drug-resistant bacteria (Nickel, 2007).\n\n3. Pregnancy.\n\nThe most common adverse symptom associated with pregnancy is morning sickness. Over the years there have been several reports of teratogenic adverse drug reactions associated with pregnancy medications (Saunders and Saunders, 1990). The most sensational of these was the stunted limb growth and severe birth abnormalities associated with exposure to thalidomide ( ). Similar severe birth defects appeared with the development of secondary sex characteristics in the children of women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol ( ). These sobering examples help explain why women are very reluctant to take prescription drugs for morning sickness. Some recent data may indicate that drugs such as metoclopramide ( ) may be safe and offer some relief to women when morning sickness severely impacts their quality of life (Lee and Saha, 2011). For example, a recent Danish study on 40,000 women taking metoclopramide (reglan) during pregnancy showed no statistically significant increase in birth defects or miscarriages (Pasternak et al., 2013). However, likely because of the tragic history of drugs prescribed for morning sickness as well as the recommendation by most doctors to avoid prescription drugs entirely during pregnancy, women often look for natural alternatives to control symptoms.\n\n4. Lactation.\n\nThe most frequent cause of breastfeeding failure is decreased milk production. There are a number of prescription drugs that stimulate lactation including metoclopramide (reglan, ), domperidone (motilium, motilidone, ), and sulpiride (dolmatil, sulparex, ) (Zuppa et al., 2010; Rowe et al., 2013). For example, a modest increase in breast milk volume (100 ml/day) has been reported in mothers of preterm infants given domperidone (Donovan and Buchanan, 2012). However, side effects have been reported with prescription galactagogues, including severe depression, nausea, gastric upset, and diarrhea, and along with the fear that these drugs might contaminate breast milk, many women prefer natural galactagogues, which are perceived as safe (Gabay, 2002; Marcellin and Chantry, 2015).\n\n5. Menopausal Symptoms.\n\nHot flashes and night sweats are the most commonly experienced menopausal symptoms contributing to adverse quality of life (Nelson, 2008). The gold standard of care for menopausal symptoms before the release of the Women’s Health Initiative was hormone therapy (HT). Oral conjugated equine estrogens [i.e., estradiol ( ), equilin ( ), equilenin] were the most commonly used estrogen formulations either alone or in combination with a progestin ( ) (Bhavnani and Stanczyk, 2014; Stanczyk and Bhavnani, 2014). Since the release of the Women’s Health Initiative report in 2002 (Rossouw et al., 2002) and the Million Women study in 2003 (Beral and Million Women Study Collaborators, 2003), women have been discouraged from using traditional HT because of the increased risk of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism within the estrogen plus progestin arm and increased risk of stroke within the estrogen arm (Brass, 2004; Chlebowski et al., 2013; Manson and Branch, 2014). Despite recent analysis that suggests that women benefit from early initiation of HT with no significant increased breast cancer risk, women still associate HT with these detrimental side effects (Schierbeck et al., 2012; Lacey, 2014). Nonhormonal therapies are also prescribed such as antidepressants, which may act through serotonergic mechanisms. The data suggest that the SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, have efficacy; however, the relief from hot flashes and night sweats are much less than observed with traditional HT and side effects and cost may restrict use for most women (Nelson et al., 2006; Shen and Stearns, 2009).\n\nC. Botanicals as Alternatives for Women’s Health\n\nLargely as the result of adverse effects reported for prescription medications for women’s health (i.e., Women’s Health Initiative and increased breast cancer risk), women are frequently turning to botanicals because they are perceived as safe despite the lack of supporting rigorous scientific documentation on either safety or efficacy (North American Menopause Society, 2004, 2011; Lloyd and Hornsby, 2009; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a; Garcia-Cazarin et al., 2014; Lindstrom et al., 2014; van Breemen, 2015). The sales of herbal dietary supplements reached 6.4 billion in 2014, with women as the major users taking these botanicals for a variety of ailments (Blumenthal et al., 2015). The rank order in sales of women’s health botanicals presented in and shows the popularity of botanicals as a function of a woman’s age. However, scientific data about the efficacy of botanicals in women’s health and their role in preventing diseases is scarce, and regulations for biological and chemical standardization of these botanicals before marketing is lacking (Snelten et al., 2012; Dietz and Bolton, 2013; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a). One of the major problems with clinical research on botanical dietary supplements is the large placebo effect, which is often observed particularly with botanicals which affect the CNS (Nedrow et al., 2006; Geller et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2009). These placebo effects often lead to equivocal and nonsignificant effects, making recommendations on efficacy difficult. In fact, the placebo effect could explain the increase in use of botanical dietary supplements especially as the population ages. Older women are also more likely to use botanicals because they have increased health needs and probably more disposable income.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nRankLatin NameCommon NameUseReported MechanismProposed Phytochemical2.Vaccinium macrocarponCranberryUTIBacterial adhesionProanthocyanidins4.Actaea/Cimicifuga racemosaBlack cohoshMenopauseSerotoninN-methylserotonin5.Linum usitatissimumFlaxseedMenopauseaEstrogenEnterodiol/lenterolactone6.Valeriana officinalisValerianMenopause/PMSbSerotoninValerenic acid10.Zingiber officinaleGingerNausea/PMScProkineticGingerols/shogaols12.Silybum marianumMilk thistleLactationdProlactin/estrogenSilybin B16.Epimedium speciesHorny goat weedMenopause/PMSEstrogenIcaritin -> desmethylicaritin27.Lepidium meyeniiMacaMenopauseEstrogenPhytosterols28.Trigonella foenum-graecumFenugreekLactationEstrogenDiosgenin, apigenin, luteolin29.IsoflavonesGlycine maxSoyMenopause/boneEstrogenGenistein, daidzein -> equolTrifolium pratenseRed cloverMenopause/boneEstrogenBiochanin A -> genisteinPueraria lobataKudzuMenopauseEstrogenPuerarin -> daidzeinEriosema laurentiiGuinea-bissauMenopauseEstrogenLupinalbin A37.Oenothera biennisEvening primroseMenopause/PMSeEstrogenγ-linolenic acidNot ranked (out of top 40)fAngelica sinensisDong quaiMenopause/PMSSERM/unknownLigustilideArctostaphylos uva-ursiBearberryUTIAntibacterialArbutinDioscorea villosaWild yamMenopause/PMSEstrogenDiosgeninGlycyrrhiza speciesLicoriceMenopauseEstrogenLiquiritigeninHumulus lupulusHopsMenopausebEstrogenXanthohumol -> 8-PNMedicago sativaAlfalfaMenopauseEstrogenCoumestrolRheum rhaponticumRhubarbMenopauseEstrogenPiceatannolVitex agnus-castusChasteberryMenopause/PMSCNS/estrogenApigenin/penduletinViburnum opulus/prunifoliumCramp bark/black hawPMSAntispasmodicScopoletin\n\nD. Current Approaches and Techniques in Botanical Research\n\nCurrent research in mechanism of action of botanicals involves a multifaceted approach including phytochemical, biological, and analytical techniques (van Breemen, 2015) ( ). Numerous challenges are encountered including the 1) identification and procurement of reproducible plant material, 2) the identification of bioactive chemical compounds, 3) the selection and implementation of appropriate screening bioassays, 4) potential interactions between the phytoconstituents in a botanical extract, and 5) the analysis of in vivo effects including their metabolism and distribution profile.\n\n1. Identification and Procurement of Plant Material.\n\nCommercial botanicals used for women’s health have a long history of traditional use with little scientific evidence of efficacy, safety, or other potential health benefits. For robust scientific studies on these botanicals it is crucial to have a reliable source for the procurement of plant material, because many factors such as plant location, temperature, harvest time, as well as postharvest processing steps, such as drying, can have significant impact on the phytochemical profile of the plant material (Pferschy-Wenzig and Bauer, 2015). In addition, correct authentication of the plant material is essential. Misidentifications can occur due to name similarities. For example, in a dietary supplement formulation the roots of Stephania tetrandra were inadvertently substituted with the roots of Aristolochia fangchi because of the close similarity of the Chinese names leading to an endemic nephropathy including end-stage kidney failure (Vanherweghem, 1998; Dietz and Bolton, 2007). Moreover, misidentification can occur, when the pharmacologically used plant parts, for example roots, of similar species are undistinguishable or if the plant part is provided as powdered material (Dunlap et al., 2015; Simmler et al., 2015a). A visual differentiation of the plant species is usually possible when the whole plant is examined; however, other pharmacognostic methods become necessary for the individual plant part (Simmler et al., 2015b). The botanical integrity may be analyzed by microscopy using taxonomic keys. In many cases, this might not be sufficient to unequivocally identify the raw plant material or powder and in these cases DNA barcoding might be required. Licorice is an example in which DNA barcoding became necessary to unequivocally identify the different species. The roots of the three medicinally used licorice species, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, G. glabra, and G. inflata are very similar and difficult to distinguish although they are quite different chemically and biologically (Kondo et al., 2007b). The use of DNA barcoding made it possible to differentiate these three species and to even distinguish hybrids of these plants (Simmler et al., 2015a). After the preparation of botanical extracts, an array of analytical methods are available to perform phytochemical analyses [e.g., thin-layer chromatography, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, LC-MS/MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)] to unambiguously identify the plant material used for the preparation of the extract (Simmler et al., 2015b).\n\n2. Identification of Bioactive Compounds.\n\nTo obtain efficacious and safe plant based remedies, it is essential to identify the bioactive and toxic phytoconstituents as well as to describe their mechanism of action (van Breemen, 2015). For some herbal dietary supplements the major bioactive constituents for the indicated medical use are known. For example the observed in vitro estrogenic activity of soy and red clover extracts are mainly due to the isoflavones, genistein and biochanin A (Overk et al., 2005; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a) ( ). However, other botanicals have been medicinally used for years without a clear knowledge of the bioactive constituents (Qiu et al., 2014). Extracts of the roots of black cohosh (Actaea/Cimicifuga racemosa) are an example of a plant that has been standardized to a lead compound, the triterpene, 23-epi-26-deoxyactein (formerly 27-deoxyactein) ( ) (Chen et al., 2002); however, there is no evidence that the triterpenes have any effect on menopausal symptom relief (Qiu et al., 2014). The active compounds in black cohosh have not been clearly identified, although, as discussed in section IV.A.1, Nω-methylserotonin has been isolated as a potential serotonin receptor agonist ( ) (Powell et al., 2008). In preclinical and clinical investigations of botanicals, it is desirable to use extracts that have been chemically and biologically standardized to the active compounds to analyze a safe and efficacious dose for these botanical products. In addition, once the bioactive compounds are known optimal extraction procedures (choice of extraction solvent, defatting) can be used to enrich the active compounds. The comparative analysis of many clinical studies with botanical extracts is often problematic, because various extracts with different solvents are used and therefore comparisons or conclusions are difficult to draw (Qiu et al., 2014; van Breemen, 2015).\n\nWhen pharmacological/clinical studies are done with individual phytoconstituents, the purity and appropriate analysis methods should be reported (Betz et al., 2011; Pauli et al., 2014). This is especially important when easily degradable compounds are analyzed. This has been a particular problem with studies on Angelica sinensis, because the proposed bioactive compound Z-ligustilide is particularly unstable (Dietz et al., 2008) ( ). In these cases quality control analysis of these compounds may have to be performed at regular intervals throughout the studies (Schinkovitz et al., 2008). In this review, we put higher emphasis on studies that used well-analyzed bioactive compounds and standardized extracts for pharmacological and clinical investigations.\n\n3. The Selection and Implementation of Appropriate Screening Bioassays.\n\nBecause of the complex nature of botanical extracts with a multitude of phytoconstituents, robust and medium to high-throughput assays that tolerate crude extracts or fractions/partitions are desirable for the characterization of bioactive and toxic compounds (Piersen et al., 2004). Various problems might occur during the biological screening process of natural products. These issues were recently reviewed in more detail (Sink et al., 2010; Thorne et al., 2010; Bisson et al., 2016). Briefly, some phytochemicals may give false-positive results because of nonspecific enzyme or protein interactions, formation of aggregates that may bind to protein targets, detergent-like effects, membrane disruption, cytotoxicity in cell based assays, precipitation of an analyte, and interference with detection methods, such as ultraviolet-, luminescence-, or fluorescence detection (Piersen et al., 2004; Bisson et al., 2016). Therefore, modifications of the bioassay, removal of interfering compounds, such as fatty acids, additional controls, use of additional computational methods, inclusion of literature data, and additional bioassays to test for interference or functional activity using different detection systems might be necessary to ensure functional and meaningful biological results (Piersen et al., 2004; Bisson et al., 2016). Ultimately, in vivo tests will be required to analyze the clinical potential of these phytochemicals/botanical extracts. Often not one single compound is responsible for the activity of the extract, but rather several phytoconstituents that lead to the observed overall activity through interactive processes, e.g., additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects (Piersen et al., 2004; Gertsch, 2011). In general, to identify bioactive compounds in multicompound extract mixtures a variety of different approaches might be used as outlined below.\n\nBioactivity guided fractionation (BGF) tries to connect analytical techniques with a biological/biochemical assay, to isolate substances of biological relevance (Weller, 2012; van Breemen, 2015). BGF aims to identify the phytoconstituents that are responsible for a certain bioactivity of the botanical extract (Agarwal et al., 2014). Different chromatographic techniques may be used to separate the extract into fractions, which will be tested in a particular bioassay, and the most active fractions will be further separated (Weller, 2012). An example is the fractionation of a black cohosh extract using the 5-HT7 receptor binding activity of the black cohosh fractions as the bioassay target (Powell et al., 2008). Subsequently, the potent, 5-HT7-ligand, Nω-methylserotonin ( ), was identified in the active black cohosh fractions ( ). A parallel detection of possible known compounds by LC-MS/MS using databases or NMR and structure elucidation in the active fractions is important to avoid isolation of known compounds (dereplication) (Weller, 2012; Wolfender et al., 2015). The compounds that have been isolated or identified through BGF can also be tested in several other assays including functional cell based assays that generally show less interference with fatty acids or chlorophyll leading to false-positive results. Also, using human cell culture models has the advantage that they might better predict human-compound interactions before preclinical and clinical trials (Nierode et al., 2016). However, often BGF of a botanical extract does not lead to one strongly active compound but to several weakly active compounds due to possible interactive/synergistic processes (Piersen et al., 2004). Another reason might be that the isolated, purified compounds might be unstable, such as Z-ligustilide from Angelica sinensis discussed above ( ); however, these compounds may be stabilized in the whole plant matrix (Schinkovitz et al., 2008).\n\nMass spectrometry (MS) screening might present a higher-throughput alternative than BGF (van Breemen, 2015), because MS-based screening eliminates the laborious process of fractionation by using affinity extraction steps for example (e.g., magnetic bead affinity MS-based screening) (van Breemen, 2015; Wolfender et al., 2015). The bound ligands or compounds that lead to a reaction with the analyzed enzyme can immediately be characterized by MS (van Breemen, 2015; Wolfender et al., 2015). In addition to LC-MS/MS, biological assays can also be coupled with planar chromatographic methods, such as thin layer chromatography (bioautography) (Wolfender et al., 2015). This method has often been used for the identification of antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant or enzyme inhibiting compounds in the target-directed isolation of active phytoconstituents of natural products (Dewanjee et al., 2015). The advantage of these online biological identification methods are that they are faster and require less plant material or botanical extracts. However, to verify the activity and for mechanism of action studies it is necessary to have the purified fully characterized compound.\n\nCompound-directed analysis. Many different methods, mainly LC-MS/MS and NMR techniques, enable the identification of several phytoconstituents “metabolite profiling” in a complex mixture with subsequent data mining tools (Wolfender et al., 2015). Several metabolomic techniques recently advanced this approach and were reviewed in detail elsewhere (Fillet and Frederich, 2015; Wolfender et al., 2015). This approach puts the emphasis on the identification of phytoconstituents in a plant or microorganism. After dereplication of known compounds, unknown constituents need to be isolated from the plant or other matrices. Subsequently, these compounds can be tested in several bioassays. Unanticipated effects might be discovered by this method. Alternatively, if a targeted biological examination is desired, this might lead to a quicker discovery of novel and active phytochemicals (Wu et al., 2015a).\n\n4. Interactions between Phytochemicals in Botanical Extracts.\n\nBecause botanical extracts are multicompound mixtures, the different phytoconstituents might influence each other, leading to additive, synergistic, and/or antagonistic effects (Wagner, 2011; Pelkonen et al., 2014). Therefore, the activity of the extracts might not be solely the responsibility of one or two compounds, but a multitude of compounds might be involved. Because of the difficulty in analysis of multiple interactions between the phytoconstituents in botanical extracts, these effects have not been well studied and much more research is needed in this field (Gertsch, 2011). Synergistic or antagonistic activities of phytoconstituents can be analyzed, for example by the isobol method or the Chou-Talalay combination index (Chou and Talalay, 1984). By using these methods, synergistic effects of 6-gingerol in a ginger extract ( ) on inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth and synergistic antimicrobial effects of constituents in Hydrastis canadensis have been demonstrated (Junio et al., 2011; Brahmbhatt et al., 2013). Although some investigations have analyzed synergistic or antagonistic effects of phytochemicals with drugs or other botanicals (Einbond et al., 2006), studies to analyze the interactions of phytochemicals in one botanical used for women’s health are mostly lacking. Other interactions between phytochemicals in a plant extract are possible, such as stabilization of one compound by other compounds in an extract and facilitation of absorption and therefore higher bioavailability by compounds in the extract matrix rather than isolated compounds. In general, the complexity of botanical extracts is often seen as an advantage and as a promising strategy to manage complex chronic diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders through targeting multiple pharmacological targets by a complex extract (Hopkins, 2008; Li et al., 2011). This is in contrast to the classic paradigm of single target-single drug and requires appropriate analysis of influences on network pharmacology using genomic or proteomic approaches combined with functional assays (Pelkonen et al., 2014).\n\n5. In Vivo Studies; Pharmacokinetic Profile.\n\nAfter bioactive extracts standardized to the phytochemical and potential toxic constituents have been established, in vivo studies have to be performed (van Breemen, 2015). A limiting factor of the clinical bioactivity of phytoconstituents is often the extensive metabolism in vivo. Many active botanical compounds are polyphenols and therefore prone to extensive metabolism. For example, liquiritigenin ( ) from licorice and curcumin from turmeric form multiple glucuronides (Ganesan et al., 2015; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2015). In the case of curcumin, efforts are underway to improve its bioavailability and therefore enhance its clinical efficacy (Ganesan et al., 2015). The in vivo studies will give essential information about the metabolism profile, pharmacokinetic, and distribution profile. In addition, the animal models have to be selected to test for the desired efficacy and safety. For example, the estrogenic activity of plant extracts can be evaluated with immature Sprague-Dawley rats that do not produce estradiol and with ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats (Overk et al., 2007, 2008). These animals are very susceptible to compounds with estrogenic activity, such as phytoestrogens, and would show an increase in uterine weight after a few days of estrogenic treatment. After the in vivo activity of the botanical extracts and their bioactive constituents have been determined and the induction/inhibition profile of human P450 enzymes has been established in animal models, ideally double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized human clinical trials should be performed with the standardized extract or well described phytochemical to ensure clinical efficacy and safety (van Breemen, 2015).\n\nTo fulfill all these steps necessary for the analysis of pharmacological mechanisms of botanicals and their standardization, a multidisciplinary team of researchers is necessary. An example of a well-established team is the UIC/NIH Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Research (UIC Botanical Center), which has been investigating the safety and mechanisms of action of botanical dietary supplements consumed by women since 1999 for the purpose of maintaining good health and quality of life, especially during the transition to and through menopause (Farnsworth et al., 2008). This Botanical Center involves a synergistic team of multidisciplinary investigators with complementary expertise who are organized into three Projects (Phytochemistry/standardization, Biological evaluation, Metabolism and safety) and three research Cores (Botanical, Bioassay, Chemical) ( ). The organization is very similar to the general scheme shown in .\n\nII. Botanicals Used by Premenopausal Women\n\nA. Premenstrual Syndrome\n\nMenstrual cramps are a very common ailment in premenopausal women experienced by approximately 50% of women starting with first menses (Dawood, 2006). Pain usually starts within hours of menstrual bleeding and peaks during the heaviest flow on the second or third day of the cycle. Cramps can worsen as women age due to hormone imbalance and other conditions associated with this including uterine fibroids and adenomyosis. These cramps are caused by the release of prostaglandins that induce spasms in the uterine muscle. As a result, botanicals with smooth muscle relaxing properties could be effective antispasmodic agents (Park et al., 2014; van Andel et al., 2014). Botanicals traditionally used to treat menstrual disorders are reviewed below.\n\n1. Vitex agnus-castus (Chasteberry).\n\nChasteberry is obtained from the dried ripe fruit of the chaste tree and has been used as a women’s health botanical since ancient Greece (Wuttke et al., 2003). One mechanism of action could be through the dopamine receptors, which decrease thyrotropin releasing hormone and prolactin levels, alleviating PMS symptoms (Meier et al., 2000; Tamagno, 2009). Chasteberry has also been shown to have hormone modulating properties in vitro that may play a role in regulating PMS symptoms (Girman et al., 2003; Lloyd and Hornsby, 2009). Weak binding affinity for the estrogen receptors and modulation of hormone sensitive genes have been reported in vitro (Liu et al., 2001, 2004; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a) as well as estrogenic effects on the uterus in rat models (Ibrahim et al., 2008). An alternative mechanism as an opiate receptor agonist has also been reported (Webster et al., 2006, 2011; Chen et al., 2011). A number of phytochemicals have been isolated from chasteberry including several flavonoids and linoleic acid, which could be responsible for the biological activities ( ) (Chen et al., 2011; Webster et al., 2011). Apigenin and penduletin in particular have been identified as weak ERβ-selective ligands ( ) (Jarry et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2007b), although apigenin is present in numerous plants. A small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (67 Chinese women) did show significant efficacy of chasteberry compared with placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe PMS (Ma et al., 2010). Other small placebo controlled trials also suggested benefit; however, the placebo effect was large, which is often seen in clinical trials with effects on the CNS (Berger et al., 2000; Schellenberg, 2001, 2012; He et al., 2009; Zamani et al., 2012). These trials were of short duration and safety data were lacking. The German Commission E approved the use of chasteberry for PMS and chasteberry has the most convincing clinical data out of all of the botanicals for efficacy in the treatment of PMS (Freeman, 2010).\n\n2. Angelica sinensis (Dong Quai).\n\nDong quai or danggui is the dried root of Angelica sinensis, which is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine to promote blood circulation and treat menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea as well as other women’s health issues (Wu and Hsieh, 2011; Chen et al., 2013). It has been shown that a bioactive component of dong quai, Z-ligustilide ( ), inhibits the contraction of isolated rat uterus in a dose-dependent manner and improves microcirculation, suggesting it might be responsible for the antispasmodic effects of dong quai (Du et al., 2006). Ligustilide also has anti-inflammatory effects, which could contribute to the mechanisms of relief of menstrual symptoms (Su et al., 2011). Whether dong quai has estrogenic activity is controversial, and no estrogenic compounds have been isolated to date (Piersen, 2003; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a). Finally, there are no randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of dong quai for PMS.\n\n3. Viburnum opulus and Viburnum prunifolium (Cramp Bark and Black Haw).\n\nCramp bark and black haw are two species of viburnum that are often used as uterine relaxants and antispasmodics. Animal studies have suggested that both species have antispasmodic effects on the uterus and experiments with human uterine tissue also showed a relaxant effect (Jarboe et al., 1966; Nicholson et al., 1972; Cometa et al., 2009). Scopoletin could be responsible for the smooth muscle antispasmodic activity of viburnum ( ) (Jarboe et al., 1967; Nicholson et al., 1972). There are no randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of viburnum for PMS.\n\n4. Zingiber officinale (Ginger).\n\nThe rhizome of the ginger plant has been used for centuries as a spice and a condiment as well as for medicinal properties, particularly for anti-inflammatory and immune modulating properties (Ali et al., 2008). Ginger may also be effective at reducing PMS symptoms. More than 60 active compounds have been identified in ginger, including gingerols, shogaols, and zingerone ( ) (Baliga et al., 2011). Ginger and its bioactive compound zingerone have reported antispasmodic activities ( ) (van Andel et al., 2014; Ahmad et al., 2015). There are some reports of estrogenic activities for ginger, although other studies have shown no effect (Kim et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2015). A small trial suggested that ginger (250 mg, 4 times daily, for three days from the start of the menstrual period) was as effective as NSAIDs at reducing period pain (Ozgoli et al., 2009). A few other small trials in young women have also shown positive effects for PMS (Kashefi et al., 2014, 2015).\n\n5. Valeriana officinalis (Valerian).\n\nThe roots and rhizomes of valerian have been used for centuries primarily for tranquilizing/sedative properties as well as for PMS (Jarema, 2008). Over 150 phytochemicals have been identified in valerian, including pyridine alkaloids and organic acids such as valerenic acid ( ) (Patocka and Jaki, 2010). The antispasmodic effects of valerian have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Occhiuto et al., 2009). A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial with 100 young women receiving 255 mg three times daily for 3 days at the beginning of the menstrual cycle for two consecutive cycles showed a significant reduction in the severity of pain (Mirabi et al., 2011). No adverse effects were reported in the valerian-treated group, which supports literature evaluations of safety (Kelber et al., 2014).\n\n6. Oenothera biennis (Evening Primrose).\n\nThe oil from the seeds of evening primrose are high in fatty acids, including γ-linolenic acid (Montserrat-de la Paz et al., 2014) ( ). Polyphenolic compounds are also present, including gallic acid and chatechin, which could be responsible for antioxidant effects (Wettasinghe et al., 2002) ( ). A double-blind randomized clinical trial with 40 young women receiving either femicomfort (evening primrose, vitamins B6 and E) or placebo for two menstrual cycles concluded that evening primrose was effective in relieving PMS symptoms (Kashani et al., 2010). Another small randomized crossover study with 38 women showed no effect (Budeiri et al., 1996).\n\nB. Urinary Tract Infections\n\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in women, and women are 30 times more likely to develop UTIs compared with men (Little et al., 2010). The bacterium Escherichia coli is mainly responsible for most uncomplicated UTIs. Botanicals traditionally used to treat UTIs are reviewed below.\n\n1. Vaccinium macrocarpon (Cranberry).\n\nCranberry, which is the second most popular botanical sold in the US ( ), has a well-recognized medicinal use primarily in preventing UTIs (Yarnell, 2002; Rossi et al., 2010). The mechanism is generally thought to involve inhibition of adhesion of P-fimbriated (proteinaceous appendages) E. coli that firmly attach to uroepithelial cells by the type A proanthocyanidins in cranberry juice ( ) (Foo et al., 2000; Guay, 2009; Vasileiou et al., 2013). Three species of cranberry (V. macrocarpon, V. oxycoccus, V. vitis-idaea) have different amounts and types of proanthocyanidins, which may explain the variable clinical data and further emphasizes the need for full chemical and biological standardization of cranberry extracts (Davidson et al., 2014). The Cochrane Collaboration previously recommended cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs in young and middle-aged women; however, questions of efficacy remain because of the heterogeneity in the clinical trial design and the lack of consensus on dosage, formulation, and time of use (Jepson et al., 2012). The most recent update suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated, and they do not currently recommend cranberry juice for the prevention of UTIs. In addition, other cranberry preparations such as powders need to be fully standardized both chemically and biologically to the active compounds to ensure potency before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use. The existing clinical trials suggest that cranberry is more effective at preventing rather than treating UTIs (Vasileiou et al., 2013); however, it is quite possible that the studies with V. macrocarpon in particular were under-dosed in the bioactive proanthocyanidins and placebo-controlled clinical trials that use standardized cranberry products are needed to establish efficacy (Davidson et al., 2014).\n\n2. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (Bearberry).\n\nBearberry is a North American shrub, the leaves of which have ethnobotanical use for treating lower urinary tract infections (Yarnell, 2002). Bearberry contains tannins, which have astringent effects and can help to shrink and tighten mucous membranes, reducing inflammation and fighting infection. The antimicrobial compound could be arbutin, which is hydrolyzed in the gut to produce glucose and hydroquinone that can be further oxidized to para-quinone ( ) (de Arriba et al., 2013). Because hydroquinone/quinone is carcinogenic and tannins can cause nausea and vomiting, low doses of bearberry (800 mg arbutin/day) are recommended for less than 1 week at a time. Currently there are no clinical trials on bearberry leaf alone to support the efficacy claims for treating UTIs.\n\nIII. Botanicals Used during Pregnancy/Lactation\n\nA. Nausea\n\nNausea and vomiting during pregnancy can severely impact quality of life as well as pose significant health risks for some women. Botanicals traditionally used to relieve nausea associated with morning sickness are reviewed below.\n\n1. Zingiber officinale (Ginger).\n\nGinger might be an effective treatment of nausea associated with pregnancy, although the clinical data have been mixed (Kennedy et al., 2013; Giacosa et al., 2015; Marx et al., 2015). In general, ginger extracts have been shown to accelerate gastric emptying (promotility, prokinetic) and stimulate gastric antral contractions (Micklefield et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2008b). In addition, four randomized controlled clinical trials on the use of ginger for pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting showed that orally administered ginger was significantly more effective than placebo at reducing frequency and intensity of nausea (Ding et al., 2013). The current literature suggests that ginger is safe in pregnant women; however, it is still not clear what the dose and length of treatment should be as well as the potential for drug/botanical interactions. GraviFrisk Ferrosan A/S (Søborg, Denmark), which contained a daily dose of 6 g dried ground ginger, was withdrawn from the Danish market in February 2008 because of inadequate scientific documentation of safety (Jacobsgaard, 2008). It is believed that the active compounds responsible for these biological effects are gingerols and shogaols ( ), which are cholinergic M3 and serotonergic 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (Abdel-Aziz et al., 2006; Pertz et al., 2011). Gingerols, shogaols, and zingerone are metabolically unstable and are readily oxidized to phenoxy radicals and potentially quinones or quinone methides ( ), which could play a role in their chemopreventive activities (Gan et al., 2013; Mason and Thompson, 2014). The instability of these compounds could explain some of the varied activities reported in clinical trials. In general, the popular use of ginger for the relief of nausea during pregnancy is substantiated by a number of clinical trials that generally report efficacy relative to placebo and little toxicity (Dante et al., 2014). Similar results have been reported for ginger clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea, motion sickness, and postoperative nausea (Dante et al., 2014).\n\nB. Lactation\n\nThe most common reported reason for stopping breast feeding is the perception of inadequate milk production. A number of women have turned to herbal galactagogues to stimulate milk production despite the lack of documented efficacy and safety (Mortel and Mehta, 2013; Amer et al., 2015). Botanicals traditionally used to treat lactation disorders are reviewed below.\n\n1. Trigonella foenum-graecum (Fenugreek).\n\nFenugreek, which is a seed spice used to enhance flavor, color, and texture of food, also has several medicinal properties including galactagogue (lactation inducer) effects (Yadav and Baquer, 2014). It is the most commonly used herbal galactagogue, although there is conflicting reports of its efficacy (Mortel and Mehta, 2013). Fenugreek is thought to stimulate sweat production and because the breast is a modified sweat gland, it may stimulate breast milk production through this mechanism (Gabay, 2002). It has also been reported that fenugreek contains diosgenin ( ), which could modify the endocrine system enhancing milk production (Sreeja et al., 2010). Sugars of the flavonoids apigenin ( ) and luteolin ( ) have also been reported. In a well-designed clinical trial of 66 mother-infant pairs randomly assigned to three groups; fenugreek tea, apple tea, and control, maximum weight loss was significantly lower in the infants and milk volume was higher in the mothers receiving fenugreek tea (Turkyılmazet al., 2011). The research on the health benefits of fenugreek including its use as a galactagogue and its lack of side effects suggest potential as a dietary supplement (Yadav and Baquer, 2014).\n\n2. Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle).\n\nThe most common use of milk thistle supplements is for liver detoxification (Greenlee et al., 2007). Galactagogue activity of milk thistle has also been reported and its use is increasing (Forinash et al., 2012; Zapantis et al., 2012). It has been described in an in vivo study that milk thistle and specifically, silymarin ( ), a mixture of flavonolignans and some precursor flavonoids contained in milk thistle, increased prolactin levels in female rats and that this might lead to a galactagogue effect (Forinash et al., 2012). In an in vivo study with gestational pigs, feeding of 4 g silymarin twice daily for 20 days resulted in significant increase of circulating prolactin levels (Farmer et al., 2014). In addition, some parameters of mammary gland development changed through silymarin treatment; however, the increase in prolactin was not sufficient to have beneficial effects on mammary gland development in late gestation. The influence of silymarin on the amount of milk formation was not analyzed in this study. One placebo-controlled clinical trial analyzed silymarin’s effectiveness as galactagogue in women (Forinash et al., 2012). Although an increase in milk formation was observed in this small clinical trial, this study had several limitations, which warrants further examination of milk thistle as a galactagogue in larger clinical investigations. The estrogenic activity of milk thistle and of silymarin was analyzed in different studies with varying results. Some studies describe weak estrogenic activities for silymarin and especially for its major flavonolignan, silybin B, and for quercetin and taxifolin (Pliskova et al., 2005) ( ). One 12-week in vivo study showed that silymarin exerted estrogenic effects, such as increase of uterine weight and reduction of bone loss in ovariectomized rats (El-Shitany et al., 2010). A 1-week in vivo study using a lower dose of silymarin also showed an influence on osteoblast parameters but did not observe a uterotrophic effect for silymarin (Seidlova-Wuttke et al., 2003). Silymarin is reported to mainly exert estrogenic activity through the ERβ receptor (Seidlova-Wuttke et al., 2003); however, it is controversial whether silibin B (El-Shitany et al., 2010) or other compounds contained in silymarin, such as taxifolin and quercetin, are responsible for the described ERβ-selective effect (Powers and Setzer, 2015). In general, the safety and efficacy of milk thistle as a galactagogue has not been analyzed in detail and further studies are warranted.\n\nIV. Botanicals Used by Menopausal Women\n\nA. Menopausal Symptoms\n\nThe decrease in estrogen production at menopause leads to life-altering symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, cognitive instability, sleep disturbances, and vaginal atrophy (Nelson, 2008). These symptoms can be effectively managed by hormone therapy; however, as mentioned above, the results of the women’s health initiative have led many women to complementary or alternative remedies such as the botanical dietary supplements ( ) (Borrelli and Ernst, 2010; Depypere and Comhaire, 2014; Poluzzi et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015). Botanicals traditionally used to treat menopausal symptoms are reviewed below.\n\n1. Serotonergic Mechanism.\n\nEstrogen withdrawal during menopause results in a decline in the release of neurotransmitters, primarily norepinephrine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), leading to a change in thermoregulation in the hypothalamus (Shanafelt et al., 2002) resulting in hot flashes and night sweats. Increase in the amount of serotonin and activating certain 5-HT receptors as well as inhibition of serotonin reuptake in synapses through blocking of serotonin transporters with prescription antidepressant SSRIs are viable approaches in preventing hot flashes ( ). However, there are also a number of undesirable outcomes such as nausea, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and sleep disturbances associated with these remedies that have led women to consider natural botanicals with potential serotonergic efficacy (Nachtigall, 2010; Kintscher, 2012; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a).\n\na. Actaea/Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh).\n\nBlack cohosh is the most popular botanical for menopausal symptom relief in the United States (Taylor, 2012, 2015) ( , rank number 4). The roots and rhizomes of black cohosh have been used by Native Americans for a variety of women’s health issues for centuries. It is generally agreed that black cohosh is not estrogenic and the mechanism of action may involve modulation of the serotonergic system similar to the effects of antidepressants (Winterhoff et al., 2003; Borrelli and Ernst, 2008; Powell et al., 2008; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a; Wuttke et al., 2014). The active compounds in black cohosh are not known, although Nω-methylserotonin has been identified as a potential serotonin receptor agonist ( ) (Powell et al., 2008). The efficacy reports from black cohosh clinical trials have been highly variable (Shams et al., 2010). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials concluded that of the six trials that demonstrated a significant improvement in the black cohosh group compared with placebo, a 26% improvement was calculated (95% confidence interval, 11–40%) (Shams et al., 2010). For example, Ruhlen et al. (2007) observed reduction of hot flashes in women taking a black cohosh extract containing 2.5% triterpenes for 12 weeks. The effect returned to baseline after a 12-week washout period. The extract did not have any effect on serum estrogenic markers, trefoil factor 1 gene expression levels and cellular morphology in the women’s nipple aspirate fluids, demonstrating no detectable estrogenic effect on the breast tissue (Ruhlen et al., 2007). More recent clinical trials have reported negative effects for black cohosh with no significant difference from placebo for relief of hot flashes. A black cohosh extract of 40 mg/day was not superior to placebo for menopausal symptoms or improving quality of life scores in Thai women (Tanmahasamut et al., 2015). Similarly, a standardized extract of 125 mg/day for 1 year also was not as effective as placebo (Geller et al., 2009). Given the popularity of black cohosh for relief of menopausal symptoms, larger placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed with fully standardized extracts before questions of efficacy and safety can be answered.\n\nb. Valeriana officinalis (valerian).\n\nExtracts of valerian roots are widely used for inducing sleep and improving sleep quality, suggesting they might be effective for menopausal symptoms especially night sweats (Bent et al., 2006). Serotonergic activity has also been reported for valerian extracts, and valerenic acid has been identified as a potential partial agonist of the 5-HT5A ( ) (Dietz et al., 2005b). In a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 68 women receiving 255 mg valerian capsules three times daily for 8 weeks showed a significant reduction in hot flash frequency and intensity (Mirabi and Mojab, 2013). Another randomized placebo-controlled trial with a mixture of valerian and lemon balm (100 women, 50–60 years, 160 mg/day valerian) showed a significant reduction in sleep disorders with the treated group (Taavoni et al., 2013). A recent 8-week study on 60 postmenopausal women (45–60 years old) showed a significant improvement in menopausal symptoms in women receiving 530 mg of valerian root capsules twice a day (Izadjoo et al., 2015). No adverse effects were reported in these trials, suggesting valerian supplements at these doses are safe.\n\n2. Estrogenic Mechanism.\n\nBotanicals with estrogenic activity can mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens lost during menopause (Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a). Estrogens often activate biological responses through binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) including ERα and ERβ, followed by dimerization of ERs and interaction with estrogen responsive elements (EREs) at the promoter of the estrogen responsive genes, thus activating transcription and generating estrogenic effects that are crucial for normal physiological functions ( ) (Nilsson et al., 2001; Bjornstrom and Sjoberg, 2005; Ellmann et al., 2009; Jia et al., 2015). It is believed that ERα induction is associated with the proliferative effects of estrogens, whereas ERβ opposes the ERα-dependent proliferation (Deroo and Buensuceso, 2010; Shanle and Xu, 2010; Thomas and Gustafsson, 2011; Jia et al., 2015). Botanicals with estrogenic effects, particularly the ones with ERβ selectivity, may offer safer alternatives to conventional prescription HT regimens.\n\na. Isoflavones.\n\ni. Glycine max (Soy).\n\nSoy is one of the major sources of protein in Asian diets in particular (Low Dog, 2005; Taylor, 2015). Isoflavones in soy foods are mainly present as glycosides (i.e., genistin, daidzin), which are hydrolyzed by β-glucosidases in the intestine forming the estrogenic ERβ-selective aglycones, genistein and daidzein ( ) (Lin and Giusti, 2005; Lopez-Gutierrez et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015). It has also been reported that daidzein metabolism by the intestinal microflora results in the formation of S-equol, which has better estrogenic activity and a higher affinity for ERβ than daidzein (Setchell et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2013) ( ). Different anaerobic bacteria can reduce daidzein to S-equol through three different reductase enzymes and one dihydrodaidzein racemase (Shimada et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2016). Genetic polymorphism in equol production has been demonstrated, which in part may explain the variability in relieving menopausal symptoms (Hong et al., 2012).\n\nMost clinical trials have used dosages ranging from 50 to 100 mg/day isoflavones (Low Dog, 2005). The North American Menopause society has concluded that soy-based isoflavones are modestly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms (North American Menopause Society, 2011). A meta-analysis of the use of soy dietary supplements for hot flashes showed a statistically significant decrease in hot flashes, although the clinical efficacy is questionable (Bolanos et al., 2010). A review published by the Cochrane Collaborative on 43 randomized controlled trials concluded that there was no conclusive evidence that soy supplements reduced menopausal hot flashes (Lethaby et al., 2013). Fortunately, no estrogenic effects on the endometrium or vagina were reported in these studies with up to 2 years of use. The poor bioavailability of genistein and daidzein from soy may explain the variable and relatively modest if any effects on menopausal symptoms (Yang et al., 2012; Rodriguez-Morato et al., 2015).\n\nii. Trifolium pratense (Red Clover).\n\nUnlike soy, the major isoflavones in red clover are the proestrogens biochanin A and formononetin ( ) (Booth et al., 2006). These methoxy precursors are demethylated by cytochrome P450 isozymes in the intestine and liver to the estrogenic ERβ-selective genistein and daidzein, respectively (Tolleson et al., 2002). These data suggest that red clover isoflavones might have higher bioavailability compared with soy and could explain why the red clover clinical trials tend to show more efficacy for menopausal symptoms compared with those evaluating soy products (Piersen et al., 2004; Thomas et al., 2014). A meta-analysis of four clinical trials using the red clover extract marketed as Promensil (Novogen Ltd, Hornsy, Australia) showed a slight but statistically significant reduction in hot flashes (Lethaby et al., 2013). In addition, there was no increase in endometrial thickness or breast density, suggesting a lack of estrogenic activity in hormone-sensitive tissues. A recent trial of 72 women randomly divided between placebo and 40 mg dried red clover daily for 12 weeks showed a significant reduction in menopausal symptoms as measured by the menopause rating scale (Shakeri et al., 2015). Other clinical trials have not shown a significant difference from placebo, particularly for hot flash relief (Geller et al., 2009; Hall et al., 2011).\n\niii. Pueraria lobata (Kudzu).\n\nKudzu is used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of menopausal symptoms (Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a). The major isoflavone in kudzu is puerarin, which is the C8-glucoside of daidzein (Guerra et al., 2000; Delmonte et al., 2006) ( ). Puerarin is metabolized to daidzein by intestinal bacteria (Park et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2011). The same isoflavonoids found in red clover and soy are also found in kudzu in lower amounts (Delmonte et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009). A randomized controlled clinical trial (127 women, 50–65 years old, 3 months) receiving kudzu standardized to 100 mg isoflavones, HT, or no treatment showed no significant changes compared with control (Woo et al., 2003; Ulbricht et al., 2015).\n\niv. Eriosema laurentii (Guinea-Bissau).\n\nGuinea-bissau is a botanical found in Cameroon traditionally used for infertility and menopausal symptoms (Ntie-Kang et al., 2013). Phytoestrogens isolated from guinea-bissau include ERα-selective lupinalbin A ( ) and ERβ-selective genistein ( ) (Ateba et al., 2014). No clinical trials have been reported on the use of guinea-bissau for menopausal symptoms.\n\nb. Humulus lupulus (hops).\n\nThe strobiles of hops are often added to beer to produce bitter, tart, hoppy flavors. Hop extracts are also a popular botanical for sleep-inducing effects, especially in Europe (Blumenthal and German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices Commission, 2000; Zanoli and Zavatti, 2008; Salter and Brownie, 2010). Hop extracts are also present in some dietary supplements for managing menopausal symptoms (Taylor, 2012). The most potent phytoestrogen in hops is the ERα-selective agonist 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), which is in part formed from the chemopreventive isoflavone xanthohumol through cyclization and P450 catalyzed demethylation as shown in as well as through metabolism of isoxanthohumol by microbiota (Nikolic et al., 2005; Chadwick et al., 2006; Possemiers et al., 2006). A few clinical trials have been published evaluating the efficacy of hops extracts on menopausal symptoms (Taylor, 2015). A randomized placebo controlled trial with 67 menopausal women over 12 weeks receiving hops extract standardized to 100 or 250 μg 8-PN or placebo showed significant effects at 6 weeks for the lower dose. However, no effect was observed at higher doses, and the lower dose was not significantly different from placebo after 12 weeks as measured by the Kupperman index and quality of life questionnaire (Heyerick et al., 2006). The authors noted the relatively low effective dose of ERα-selective 8-PN, which is 100-fold more potent than the ERβ-selective isoflavones genistein and daidzein (Milligan et al., 1999; Overk et al., 2008). However, given the potent ERα agonistic activity of 8-PN in hops extracts, safety with respect to the effect on the endometrium and other hormone sensitive tissues needs further study. In a smaller study (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 36 menopausal women), women receiving either placebo or hops extract standardized to 8-PN for 8 weeks and then switching treatments for 8 weeks showed weak efficacy of the extract over placebo when the extract was taken after the placebo treatment until week 16 (Erkkola et al., 2010). However, these results might not be robust, considering the small sample size and large number of variables included in the extensive statistical analysis (Taylor, 2015). A more recent trial using a daily dose of 500 mg hops in tablet form versus placebo (120 women, 90 days) showed a statistically significant reduction in menopausal symptoms and a dramatic reduction in hot flashes (Aghamiri et al., 2016). However, there are several problems with this trial including, the lack of standardization of the extract, the recruitment of women from multiple sites, and the lack of a placebo effect. No adverse effects were reported in any of these trials. More clinical trials are needed before the safety and efficacy of hops extracts for menopausal symptom relief can be established.\n\nc. Glycyrrhiza species (licorice).\n\nLicorice is a widely used plant, mainly as a sweetening agent in tobacco, in food and beverages, and in toothpastes. It consists of more than 30 species, from which a few have been studied for several biological effects (Asl and Hosseinzadeh, 2008; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013b). Licorice is commonly present in menopausal botanical supplements in the United States (Taylor, 2012). There are three pharmacopeial licorice species, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, G. glabra, and G. inflata; however, the specific species used is often not identified or mislabeled in supplements. The estrogenic activities of different licorice species are variable and likely depend on the type and amounts of bioactive compounds, emphasizing the importance of fully standardizing extracts using chemical, genetic, and biological methods (Liu et al., 2001; Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013a). After evaluating a large number of licorice samples that were local to certain regions of the world Kondo et al. (2007a) reported that G. uralensis and G. glabra had the highest and the lowest amounts of the phytoestrogen liquiritigenin ( ), respectively. Liquiritigenin was reported to be a selective ERβ agonist in the ER binding assay and in ERβ-ERE-luciferase activity assay in U2OS cells (Mersereau et al., 2008). In vivo liquiritigenin did not enhance proliferation of MCF-7 (ERα+) xenograft or induce uterine weight in nude mice, suggesting liquiritigenin is unlikely to affect hormone sensitive tissues (Mersereau et al., 2008). Isoliquiritigenin, the precursor chalcone of liquiritigenin was also shown to exhibit estrogenic effects ( ) (Maggiolini et al., 2002). However, the conversion of isoliquiritigenin to liquiritigenin could play a significant role in exerting the observed activity (Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013b). There have been very few clinical studies evaluating licorice for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a significant drop in hot flashes was reported with 90 women receiving licorice 330 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks (Nahidi et al., 2012). However, no mention about the species of licorice extract was available and no placebo effect was observed. Another recent trial with six women compared the efficacy of licorice extracts (1140 mg/day) for 90 days with traditional HT for hot flash relief claiming similar efficacy (Menati et al., 2014). Both trials have significant problems ranging from small size, lack of extract standardization, self-reporting surveys, lack of placebo group, and lack of placebo effect, which can be as high as 50% in menopause trials. More in-depth studies are needed to define the efficacy and safety of licorice for menopausal symptoms.\n\nd. Rheum rhaponticum (rhubarb).\n\nRhubarb is also a common herb for menopausal symptom relief, particularly in Germany (Vollmer et al., 2010; Taylor, 2012; 2015). A special extract prepared from the roots of Rheum rhaponticum called ERr731 [marketed under the trade name Phytoestrol N (Mueller Goeppingen, Goeppingen, Germany)] has been in use in Germany for decades without any significant side effects such as endometrial hyperplasia, spotting, or breakthrough breeding (Wober et al., 2007). This extract mainly consists of rhaponticin and desoxyrhaponticin, which are converted to the resveratrol-like aglycones rhapontigenin and desoxyrhapontigenin by the microbiome and glycosylases ( ) (Kim et al., 2000; Wober et al., 2007). Weak ERβ activity has been measured for both the extract and the aglycones rhapontigenin and desoxyrhapontigenin in transfected HEC-1B adenocarcinoma cells and U2OS cells (Moller et al., 2007; Wober et al., 2007). Rhapontigenin is more active than desoxyrhapontigenin and it is tempting to suggest that P450-catalyzed O-demethylation giving the resveratrol catechol piceatannol might be responsible for the estrogenic activity (Wober et al., 2007). It has been shown that piceatannol binds estrogen receptors and stimulates the growth of estrogen-dependent cancer cells (Piotrowska et al., 2012). The efficacy and safety of ERr731 for menopausal symptoms has been studied in a number of double-blind placebo-controlled trials with positive results (Heger et al., 2006; Kaszkin-Bettag et al., 2008; Hasper et al., 2009). All these trials show that the rhubarb extract was well tolerated both for short duration (12 weeks) as well as long term (up to 2 years), successfully decreased the Menopause Rating Scale, and increased quality of life.\n\ne. Vitex agnus-castus (chasteberry).\n\nChasteberry is also a popular botanical added to botanical supplements for menopause (van Die et al., 2009; Taylor, 2012). It was shown to have a weak binding affinity for ERs and no estrogen-sensitive alkaline phosphatase induction in Ishikawa cells; however, it did induce the estrogen-sensitive gene PgR (progesterone receptor gene) mRNA in this cell line (Liu et al., 2001). Linoleic acid ( ) was isolated as the “active” estrogenic constituent of chasteberry based on bioassay guided fractionation of the crude extract using the ER binding assay (Liu et al., 2004). However, linoleic acid is a fatty acid and could form nonspecific binding to ERs and progesterone receptor proteins, leading to false-positive results. Moreover, induction of PgR could be related to possible progestogenic activity of the extract and not necessarily its ERα-dependent effects. It was shown that four different species of chasteberry enhance MCF-7 cell proliferation (Hu et al., 2007b). In addition, the essential oils of Vitex rotundifolia, which is mainly composed of linoleic acid, strongly enhanced MCF-7 cell proliferation, and the effect could be blocked by the pure antiestrogen, ICI 182,780 (7α,17β-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-Pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol) (Hu et al., 2007a). Similarly, Ibrahim et al. (2008) reported that an ethanolic extract of chasteberry enhanced uterine weight in Sprague-Dawley rats. These data suggest that chasteberry extracts have ERα-dependent estrogenic activity. It was also shown that chasteberry extract selectively bound ERβ and bioassay guided fractionation of the crude extract resulted in the isolation of the weak ERβ ligand apigenin ( ) (Jarry et al., 2003). The ERβ selectivity of apigenin was also shown in competitive binding assays in addition to general estrogenic activity in a yeast based and MCF-7 cell growth assays (Choi et al., 2008). Despite the popularity of chasteberry with herbalists and its use as a component of menopausal formulations with other botanicals, there are no clinical trials with chasteberry as a sole agent for the relief of menopausal symptoms (van Die et al., 2009). However, the studies with combinations of botanicals including chasteberry are promising, suggesting further investigation of Vitex agnus-castus for menopausal symptom relief (van Die et al., 2009).\n\nf. Linum usitatissimum (flaxseed).\n\nFlaxseed is a major source of lignans that are metabolized by the intestinal flora into the weakly active phytoestrogens enterolactone and enterodiol ( ) (Dew and Williamson, 2013). Lignans reside in cell walls and are not bioavailable without crushing, and as a result the best sources for women are flaxseed flour and flaxseed meal. Flaxseed oil is a good source of α-linolenic acid but does not contain lignans (Taylor, 2015). In a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (90 women, 1 g/day flaxseed extract), modest but significant effects were observed in self-reporting relief of menopausal symptoms (Colli et al., 2012). No adverse effects related to flaxseed treatment were reported. A meta-analysis of recent randomized clinical trials examining the efficacy of flaxseed for menopausal symptom relief concluded that there is little evidence to support the use of this dietary supplement for menopause or for bone health (Dew and Williamson, 2013).\n\ng. Epimedium species (horny goat weed).\n\nHorny goat weed originating from different Epimedium species has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years to enhance libido in men and women as well as for symptoms of menopause and PMS (Ma et al., 2011). The flavonoid icariin can be metabolized to icaritin and desmethylicaritin, which is likely responsible for the mostly ERα-selective estrogenic bioactivities ( ) (Wang and Lou, 2004; Cao et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2014). These prenylated flavonoids are structurally similar to the potent ERα estrogen 8-PN in hops ( , see above). One clinical trial showed that an extract of horny goat weed could increase estrogen levels and improve lipid profiles in postmenopausal women without any significant side effects (Yan et al., 2008). No clinical trials using horny goat weed for menopausal symptoms have been reported.\n\nh. Lepidium meyenii (maca).\n\nMaca has been used in South America for centuries for infertility and female hormone balance, especially for menopausal symptoms (Lee et al., 2011b; Gonzales, 2012; Taylor, 2015). Maca extracts have been shown to have estrogenic activity by increasing MCF-7 cell proliferation (Valentova et al., 2006), although the active phytoestrogens are not known. Maca extracts contain a number of phytosterols including beta-sitosterol and campesterol ( ) as well as free fatty acids including linolenic acid ( ) (Dini et al., 1994). A systematic review of clinical trials concluded that there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of maca for relief of menopausal symptoms; however, the sample size, the number of trials, and the quality of the trials were too limited to establish firm conclusions on efficacy and safety (Lee et al., 2011b).\n\ni. Oenothera biennis (evening primrose).\n\nEvening primrose oil is a good source of omega-6 essential fatty acids including γ-linolenic acid ( ). In a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (56 menopausal women), a significant improvement in the severity of menopausal hot flashes was reported in the evening primrose (500 mg/day, 6 weeks) group (Farzaneh et al., 2013). A systematic review of evening primrose oil for menopausal symptoms suggests that although the herb is well tolerated, efficacy is not clinically significant (Bayles and Usatine, 2009).\n\nj. Medicago sativa (alfalfa).\n\nAlfalfa is another botanical that is a good source of isoflavones. The coumestan derivative coumestrol ( ) is the major estrogenic phytochemical, although the licorice flavonoids liquiritigenin and isoliquirtigenin have also been detected ( ) (Hong et al., 2011). No clinical trials for menopause using alfalfa alone have been reported.\n\n3. Unknown Mechanism.\n\na. Dioscorea villosa (wild yam).\n\nWild yam contains diosgenin, which is used in the manufacturing of synthetic steroids (Taylor, 2015). Diosgenin can be chemically converted to progesterone, although there is no biological pathway for the conversion in vivo ( ). When given as a cream, there was no significant effect on menopausal symptoms in 23 women after 3 months compared with placebo (Komesaroff et al., 2001). No significant adverse effects were reported. The current recommendations are that yam creams are ineffective for menopause and because many contain adulterants they should be avoided (Taylor, 2015).\n\nb. Angelica sinensis (dong quai).\n\nThe roots of Angelica sinensis have been used for restoring female hormonal balance in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries (Hook, 2014). The estrogenic activity of dong quai is controversial (Liu et al., 2001; Lau et al., 2005; Circosta et al., 2006). For example, it was shown that dong quai had proliferative effects in MCF-7 (ERα+) cells, whereas it did not induce ERα/ERβ-dependent luciferase transcription in transfected HeLa cells and did not show uterotrophic activity in CD-1 mice (Amato et al., 2002). However, enhanced uterine weight, change in vaginal cytology, and reduced luteinizing hormone levels in female Wistar rats treated with an ethanolic extract of dong quai have been shown (Circosta et al., 2006). Similarly, cell-based studies showed controversial results. Dong quai methanolic extracts did not show binding affinity to ERs, induce alkaline phosphatase activity in Ishikawa cells, or induce transcription of estrogen responsive genes (Liu et al., 2001). Moreover, an ethanolic extract of dong quai did not exhibit estrogenic activity in a yeast-based assay over the concentration range of 0.1–1000 µg/ml (Zhang et al., 2005). It has been shown that the lipophilic fraction of a methanolic extract (rich in ligustilide, ) of dong quai at 20 µg/ml significantly inhibited alkaline phosphatase induction in the presence of estradiol in Ishikawa cells, suggesting an antiestrogenic potential (Godecke et al., 2012). To date, there have not been any reports of a purified compound, which could be responsible for the observed estrogenic/antiestrogenic activities of dong quai. These studies suggest that further research with well-defined extracts are needed to delineate the estrogenic/antiestrogenic potential of dong quai as well as the active compound. One reason for the contradictory results regarding the estrogenic activities of dong quai could be associated with the instability of its phthalide fractions, in particular Z-ligustilide as discussed previously (Schinkovitz et al., 2007). In traditional Chinese medicine, dong quai is usually combined with other botanicals; therefore very few clinical trials on dong quai alone have been reported. One study with 71 postmenopausal women randomized to 4.5 g dong quai/day or placebo for 24 weeks showed no effect on menopausal symptoms (Hirata et al., 1997). No estrogenic effects on the endometrium or vagina were observed and no significant side effects were reported in this trial. Conclusive data on the relative efficacy of dong quai for menopausal symptoms are currently unavailable.\n\nB. Osteoporosis\n\nA consequence of low estrogen levels at menopause is an increase in osteoporosis risk. Botanicals, which may protect against osteoporosis, are reviewed below. In general, there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations on the effect of botanicals on bone health.\n\n1. Isoflavones.\n\nBecause most isoflavones are ERβ-selective ligands, it should be possible to exploit this selectivity and target mainly bone cells without adversely affecting hormone-sensitive tissues such as the uterus and the breast. Genistein ( ) has been shown to stimulate bone formation, inhibit bone resorption, and prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rat models (Taylor et al., 2009; Fu et al., 2014). It has been demonstrated in a few randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies that genistein (54 mg/day for 1 or 2 years) was effective in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women (Morabito et al., 2002; Marini et al., 2007). Favorable effects have been demonstrated in other clinical studies measuring bone mass density and bone turnover markers; however, the long-term effects on prevention of fractures have not been established (Lagari and Levis, 2014; Poluzzi et al., 2014). The data suggest that diets rich in isoflavones are beneficial for bone health in the long term, although the magnitude of the effects and the exact mechanism of how isoflavones could protect bones have not been determined. There is also evidence to suggest that the positive effects of isoflavones on bone health could vary as a function of age. Isoflavones could be more effective in younger women before loss of estrogen receptors observed in postmenopause (Reinwald and Weaver, 2006). Most clinical trials with soy proteins and enriched soy isoflavones were not effective in decreasing bone loss, in particular at common fracture sites in healthy perimenopausal and postmenopausal Western women (Alekel et al., 2010). Different studies have also analyzed red clover products for prevention of osteoporosis. A patented aqueous and fermented red clover extract standardized to 37.1 mg isoflavones per day or a placebo solution were administered to women suffering from menopausal symptoms in a 3-month, randomized, double-blind and parallel designed trial (Thorup et al., 2015). A significant decline in the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (lower back) in the placebo group but not in the red clover group was observed, suggesting a positive effect on bone health by the red clover extract. However, it has to be noted that the actual changes were small and that the differences could also be due to the variability in bone density scanning. Studies with bisphosphonate therapy showed that reliable treatment effects can be best observed after 3 years, because the within-person variations differ widely with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurement (Sharma and Stevermer, 2009). Therefore, longer clinical studies with red clover would be necessary to evaluate the efficacy as a treatment of osteoporosis. Until more rigorous clinical trials are completed, soy foods and/or soy or red clover supplements cannot be recommended as alternatives for antiosteoporotic medications (Messina et al., 2004; Nieves, 2013; Poluzzi et al., 2014).\n\n2. Others.\n\nThe evidence supporting the use of other botanicals for prevention of osteoporosis is very limited. Maca prevents bone loss in rat models of estrogen-deficient bone loss (Zhang et al., 2006). Wild yam and fenugreek have effects on bone mineral density in ovariectomized rats (Chiang et al., 2011; Folwarczna et al., 2014). Silymarin has also been studied as remedy against osteoporosis in animal models (Milic et al., 2013). Horny goat weed has a long history in treating osteoporosis in traditional Chinese medicine, which was recently reviewed (Ma et al., 2011; Indran et al., 2016).\n\nV. Botanicals for Breast Cancer Prevention\n\nMany botanicals that are used for women’s health are likely to have additional health beneficial effects, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive activities (Rice-Evans, 2001; Rahman et al., 2006). Although describing all these effects is beyond the scope of this review, the prevention of estrogen-dependent cancers, especially breast cancer, is summarized below for some representative women’s health botanicals (Snelten et al., 2012; Dietz and Bolton, 2013; Cojocneanu Petric et al., 2015). Breast cancer prevention is especially important for postmenopausal women, because breast cancer risk increases with age and therefore postmenopausal women have a higher risk than premenopausal women (Wang et al., 2015b). Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer occurring in women, and it is estimated that 246,660 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the US in 2016 (Siegel et al., 2016). For years, researchers have studied the causes of this disease and have found a pivotal role for estrogens in the development of breast cancer (Huang et al., 2015; Ziegler et al., 2015). Four major mechanisms contribute to the overall development of estrogen-dependent cancers including hormonal, chemical, inflammatory, and epigenetic ( ).\n\nA. Hormonal Pathway\n\nEstrogens bind to the estrogen receptor (ER), increasing cell proliferation which leads to an enhanced risk of mutations ( ) (Santen et al., 2015). These complex processes involve genomic and nongenomic ER signaling (Bjornstrom and Sjoberg, 2005). For this review, the emphasis will be put on direct binding of phytoestrogens or estrogens to the two major estrogen receptors that are found in the normal breast tissue, ERα and ERβ (Huang et al., 2015), and their binding to the ERE ( ). Although the exact roles of the two ERs are still under intensive investigations, it has been shown that ERα leads to proliferation of breast cells and that ERβ represses proliferation and is proapoptotic (Huang et al., 2015). In postmenopausal women, estradiol is produced locally by aromatization of androgens in extragonadal sites, such as breast adipose tissue, leading to enhanced local estrogen concentrations that can lead to increased proliferation of epithelial cells (Wang et al., 2015b) ( ). Modulation of aromatase activity and thus estrogen levels is another way through which phytochemicals are able to influence the hormonal estrogen pathway.\n\nB. Chemical Pathway\n\nThe second estrogen carcinogenesis pathway involves estrogen metabolism by P450 to catechols, which are oxidized to genotoxic o-quinones ( ) (Bolton, 2011; Snelten et al., 2012; Yager, 2015). P450 1A1 and 1B1, which metabolize the 2- and 4-hydroxylation pathways, respectively, are regulated by the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which binds to the xenobiotic response element (XRE) in the nucleus (Murray et al., 2014). These P450s are also responsible for the bioactivation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to the ultimate carcinogens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinones (Shimada, 2006; L'Heritier et al., 2014). In contrast to enhanced 2-hydroxylation of parent estrogens, which has been associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (Ziegler et al., 2015), 4-hydroxylation is generally considered a genotoxic pathway that has shown significant carcinogenic properties (Bolton, 2011; Snelten et al., 2012; Cavalieri and Rogan, 2014). Potentially, estrogen quinones could be eliminated by the detoxification enzymes NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and glutathione-S-transferase, which are regulated through the Nrf2/Keap1/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway ( and ). However, there is no direct evidence that these quinones are substrates for the detoxification enzymes, although induction of these enzymes could be considered generally cytoprotective (Chandrasena et al., 2008). Many feedback loops exist between ER, AhR, and Nrf2 pathways (Kohle and Bock, 2007; Swedenborg and Pongratz, 2010); however, as mentioned above, ER signaling crosstalk is beyond the scope of this review.\n\nC. Inflammatory Pathway\n\nBotanicals could also counteract enhanced levels of inflammatory mediators that fuel estrogen chemical carcinogenesis in the breast ( ) (Howe, 2007; Kamel et al., 2012; Vona-Davis and Rose, 2013). Cytokine secreting macrophages promote the initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancer (Obeid et al., 2013). They upregulate both aromatase and P450 1B1 expression, leading to enhanced genotoxic 4-hydroxylation products and increased DNA damage (Kamel et al., 2012; Vona-Davis and Rose, 2013). Furthermore, inflammatory mediators (e.g., NF-κB, iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β) are often overexpressed in breast cancer tissues, in particular from hormone receptor negative breast cancer, and these mediators are correlated with poor prognosis (Harris et al., 2014). Many inflammatory proteins, such as COX-2, iNOS, and IL-1β, are regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB (Samadi et al., 2015). Numerous botanicals have been reported to inhibit NF-κB activation and/or to inhibit certain inflammatory pathways, such as COX-2, leading to prevention of inflammatory-mediated effects (Izzi et al., 2012).\n\nD. Epigenetic Pathway\n\nFinally, recent evidence suggests that epigenetic pathways can play a role in estrogen carcinogenesis ( ) (Giacinti et al., 2006; Hervouet et al., 2013; Basse and Arock, 2015). DNA methylation catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), posttranslational histone modification catalyzed by histone deacetylases, histone acetylases (HATs), histone methyltransferases, and histone demethyltransferases can all be involved in the carcinogenic process. As a result, phytochemicals that could interfere with these pathways might have chemopreventive effects through epigenetic modulations (Gerhauser, 2012; 2013; Byler et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2015a). In summary, estrogen carcinogenesis involves 1) hormonal, 2) chemical, 3) inflammation, and 4) epigenetic pathways ( ). Many botanicals that are used for postmenopausal women’s health have been described to interfere with all or most of these four pathways, and examples of botanicals with these properties are reviewed below.\n\nE. Isoflavone-containing Botanicals (Red Clover, Soy)\n\nRed clover (Trifolium pratense) and soy (glycine max) contain estrogenic bioactive isoflavones, genistein and daidzein as discussed in section IV.A.2.a ( ). The gut metabolite of daidzein, equol, is reported to be more estrogenic and ERβ selective than daidzein (Jiang et al., 2013; van der Velpen et al., 2013). In addition to their estrogenic properties, some epidemiological data suggest that these isoflavones might contribute to the lower incidence of breast cancer in Japanese women, who eat a soy-rich diet (Adlercreutz, 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2003). Therefore, many in vitro and in vivo studies have analyzed the chemopreventive activities of genistein in particular (Russo et al., 2016). However, well-designed clinical trials analyzing the cancer preventive activity of genistein and other isoflavones or soy/red clover extracts are scarce. Isoflavones might modulate estrogen carcinogenesis through the hormonal, chemical, inflammatory, and epigenetic pathways (Dietz and Bolton, 2013; Guo et al., 2015a). Genistein in particular is a pleiotropic compound with a multitude of biological activities (Russo et al., 2016) that might modulate estrogen carcinogenesis. Whether isoflavones have breast cancer preventive properties is still a controversial topic and needs to be further analyzed in clinical trials.\n\n1. Hormonal Pathway.\n\nIn vitro studies revealed that isoflavones, such as genistein (IC50 = 3.6 μM) and biochanin A (IC50 = 25 μM), are moderate inhibitors of the estrogen synthesizing enzyme aromatase (van Meeuwen et al., 2007). More potent aromatase inhibitors have been designed from the isoflavone scaffold (Bonfield et al., 2012). Genistein and daidzein ( ) have also been reported to inhibit other steroidogenic enzymes in the micromolar range, such as 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (CYP21), which might ultimately result in lower estradiol levels (Hasegawa et al., 2013). However, other investigations describe genistein as an inducer of aromatase expression/activity in extragonadal cells, which might lead to enhanced local estrogen concentrations (Edmunds et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2009a; van Duursen et al., 2013). Genistein, daidzein, and S-equol are preferential ERβ agonists with nanomolar potency, but at higher concentrations, they have ERα activities (Jiang et al., 2013). Because ERβ reduces ERα-induced cell proliferation, the safety of these isoflavones likely depends on their concentrations. In the micromolar range, genistein is a selective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which might lead to reduction of cell growth through inhibition of core signaling tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, and others (Russo et al., 2016). For example, in an ERβ-positive breast cancer cell line, genistein inhibited human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) overexpression and HER2 phosphorylation activity, likely through inhibition of its tyrosine kinase activity at concentrations >1 μM (Sakla et al., 2007; Russo et al., 2016). A recent study illustrated the distinct proliferative effects of genistein on different breast cancer cell types (Pons et al., 2016). In cell lines mainly expressing ERα, genistein lead to cell proliferation, whereas in ERβ-expressing cells, genistein treatment had no effect. These studies illustrate that genistein has different effects on the hormonal pathway depending on concentration, ER status, and breast cell type. This might explain some of the conflicting results obtained in breast cancer cells or in animal experiments studying estrogen sensitive tissues.\n\nSeveral animal and clinical studies analyzed the effect of isoflavones on endometrial and mammary tissue with controversial outcomes (Dietz and Bolton, 2013). Some in vivo experiments suggest that genistein suppresses mammary carcinogenesis (Constantinou et al., 2001; Sahin et al., 2011); however, many recent in vivo investigations found that it promotes carcinogenesis in breast tissue and enhances metastasis formation (Ju et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2015). Three animal studies demonstrated that genistein stimulates mammary gland growth and enhances the growth of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) in animals (Hsieh et al., 1998; Allred et al., 2004; Ju et al., 2006). These reports show that isoflavones of red clover/soy have the potential to reduce and/or enhance the hormonal-related carcinogenic effects of endogenous estrogens. However, the activity of the whole red clover extract or soy supplementation might be distinct from the activity of the isolated isoflavones. For example, uterotrophic activities have been described for genistein (Diel et al., 2004a) but not for the red clover extract (Overk et al., 2008).\n\nMost clinical trials suggest that isoflavones in dietary supplements are safe and do not show estrogenic effects on breast or endometrial tissues. For example, in one clinical trial that used a standardized (26 mg biochanin A, 16 mg formononetin, 1 mg genistein, and 0.5 mg daidzein) red clover extract in women (age 49–65 years), the extract did not increase breast density over 1 year (Atkinson et al., 2004). A clinical study (up to 3 years) with postmenopausal women suggested that purified genistein (54 mg/day) is safe with respect to breast and endometrial proliferation (Taylor et al., 2009). In contrast to the placebo group, the genistein arm showed a statistically significant decrease in endometrial thickness at the 36-month follow up. Genistein also significantly decreased sister chromatid exchanges in peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from postmenopausal study participants after administration of 54 mg/day genistein for 1 year in a randomized placebo-controlled study (Atteritano et al., 2008). Soy isoflavone dietary intervention studies with premenopausal women showed no toxicity over a period of 2 years with no effect on breast density as analyzed by mammography (Taylor et al., 2009). Similarly, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study revealed that consumption of 250 mg of standardized soy extract (100 mg/day isoflavones) by postmenopausal women for 10 months did not influence breast density (Delmanto et al., 2013). The correlation of plasma genistein and daidzein concentrations with breast cancer or benign breast conditions was analyzed in a breast self-examination trial in Chinese women. The subjects included women diagnosed with breast cancer or benign breast conditions and age-matched controls with no known breast disease (Lampe et al., 2007). The results revealed that plasma daidzein and genistein concentrations were significantly higher in controls than in patients with breast cancer or benign breast conditions. These data may indicate selective uptake of the phytoestrogens by ER-positive tumors; however the overall chemopreventive effect of isoflavones on breast cancer is unknown.\n\nHowever, some clinical studies depict an estrogenic or proliferative effect after consumption of isoflavone-containing dietary supplements. For example, a 2-week dietary supplementation study with soy (45 mg/day) in premenopausal women revealed an estrogenic effect as measured by modulation of estrogen-sensitive genes in nipple aspirate fluid (Taylor et al., 2009). A similar study with soy protein supplementation in premenopausal women suggested an estrogenic effect of soy due to an increase in proliferation of breast epithelium and an enhanced expression of progesterone receptors (Taylor et al., 2009).\n\nA 6-month intervention study using a preparation of mixed soy isoflavones (150 mg genistein, 74 mg daidzein) was performed in healthy, high-risk adult Western women to examine the effect of these isoflavones on breast epithelial proliferation and other biomarkers in the breast tissue (Khan et al., 2012b). The study demonstrated that the isoflavones did not reduce breast epithelial proliferation, suggesting a lack of efficacy for breast cancer prevention. However, among treated premenopausal women, there was a statistically significant increase in the postintervention Ki-67 labeling index after soy supplementation. Gene expression studies demonstrated a mixed pattern, with more genes enhanced in the isoflavone supplementation group that suggested estrogenic activity. Further clinical studies with different concentrations are warranted to obtain a better picture of the hormonal and proliferative activities of isoflavone containing dietary supplements on breast tissue.\n\n2. Chemical Pathway.\n\nIsoflavones have been shown to modulate different estrogen metabolism enzymes through a variety of pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies (Mense et al., 2008; Snelten et al., 2012). They modulate the P450 enzymes, P450 1A1 and P450 1B1, through inhibition of enzyme activity and through induction or suppression of their transcription (Wagner et al., 2008; Takemura et al., 2013). Genistein has been demonstrated to decrease P450 1A1/1B1 activity in part through direct inhibition of the enzyme in several assays in the low micromolar range (Roberts et al., 2004; Mense et al., 2008; Scott et al., 2008; Takemura et al., 2013). Similarly, daidzein and equol have been reported to reduce P450 1A1 and 1B1 activity in different cell assays (Roberts et al., 2004; Scott et al., 2008).\n\nCYP1B1 and CYP1A1 are both regulated through the AhR ( ) (Murray et al., 2014). Two AhR transactivation assays revealed biochanin A and formononetin as good AhR ligands (nM–μM range), whereas genistein, daidzein, and equol had no activity (Medjakovic and Jungbauer, 2008; Bialesova et al., 2015). Biochanin A was confirmed as an AhR ligand in a TCDD competitive AhR binding assay (Han et al., 2006). Biochanin A also induced the xenobiotic response element (XRE) activity in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (Chan et al., 2003), and at higher concentrations (10–50 μM), it caused a significant induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression and CYP1 activity (Han et al., 2006), suggesting that biochanin A can increase oxidative estrogen metabolism. In the presence of a strong AhR agonist DMBA, biochanin A (≥5 μM) inhibited DMBA-induced XRE activity, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA expression, as well as DMBA-induced P450 1 EROD activity in MCF-7 cells suggesting that biochanin A can act as an AhR agonist (Chan et al., 2003; Han et al., 2006).\n\nInterestingly, genistein and daidzein reduced CYP1A1 mRNA levels and P450 1 activity at low concentrations in MCF-7 cells (Wagner et al., 2008). Because estradiol has been reported to downregulate CYP1A1 (L'Heritier et al., 2014), the effect of genistein and daidzein on CYP1A1 might be explained by their estrogenic effects. At the tested concentrations, CYP1B1 was not influenced by genistein and daidzein. Higher genistein concentrations (5–25 μM) were shown by Wei et al. (2015) to induce CYP1B1 mRNA levels. Genistein also inhibited DMBA-induced XRE-luciferase activity, P450 1 activity, CYP1A1 and 1B1 mRNA expression, and DNA adducts in the micromolar range in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells (Chan and Leung, 2003; Leung et al., 2009). Only a limited number of in vivo studies have analyzed the influence of isoflavones on estrogen metabolism enzymes with different outcomes. One study analyzing the influence of the mixture of isoflavones on CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 in primate mammary glands and liver tissue did not show any significant effect (Scott et al., 2008). However, significant induction of CYP1A1 was observed after treatment of male Wistar rats with a standardized soybean extract containing 37% isoflavones (100 mg/kg) for 10 days (Mrozikiewicz et al., 2010).\n\nIsoflavones have also been shown to modulate detoxification enzymes that facilitate the elimination of estradiol and its metabolites ( ) (Dietz and Bolton, 2013). Experiments in human colon cancer cells revealed that genistein (≥0.1 μM) caused significant induction of NQO1 activity, whereas biochanin A was less effective and daidzein and formononetin were inactive (Wang et al., 1998). Genistein induced NQO1 in various cell lines as well as in different tissues in animal studies (Wang et al., 1998; Bianco et al., 2005; Froyen et al., 2009; Wiegand et al., 2009). Mechanism of action studies in ER-positive cell lines demonstrated that genistein might influence NQO1 through ER-dependent and -independent pathways (Bianco et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2008; Kaspar and Jaiswal, 2010). It has been shown that genistein (1 μM) and daidzein (10 μM) reduced NQO1 mRNA levels and catechol-O-methyltransferase mRNA and activity similar to estradiol in MCF-7 cells likely through an ERα-Nrf2-mediated mechanism (Wagner et al., 2008). However, in ERβ-positive cells, the isoflavones upregulated NQO1 mRNA through an ERβ-Nrf2-mediated mechanism (Bianco et al., 2005; Froyen and Steinberg, 2011). These variable results suggest that the NQO1 induction potential of genistein may be dependent on the cell type and ER status.\n\nThe influence of isoflavones on other detoxification enzymes might be less pronounced. Although genistein induced hepatic NQO1 activity, it did not induce the activity of other detoxification enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase) (Wiegand et al., 2009). However, in a topical inflammation model, in which 1 or 2 μg of a soy isoflavone product was administered, the activity of the detoxification enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase were induced, as well as glutathione levels (Khan et al., 2012a). An in vivo study in Sprague-Dawley rats (7 days) analyzed the effect of biochanin A on the Phase II enzyme sulfotransferase that is involved in the metabolism of estradiol and detoxification of various carcinogens (Raftogianis et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2010b). The study revealed that biochanin A (10 mg/kg/day) induced the expression and activity of sulfotransferase 1A1 and 2A1 in female rat liver and intestine.\n\nIn conclusion, the isoflavones have the potential to modulate estrogen metabolism. Biochanin A and formononetin seem to be AhR agonists and have the highest potential to induce P450 1A1/1B1 (Han et al., 2006; Bialesova et al., 2015). However, in vivo, biochanin A and formononetin are rapidly metabolized to genistein and daidzein, respectively ( ), and their concentration is likely relatively low (Piersen et al., 2004). Soy supplements contain much less biochanin A and formononetin than red clover extracts (Burdette and Marcus, 2013) and might therefore have a better safety profile with respect to estrogen metabolism. In general, the influence of genistein on "
