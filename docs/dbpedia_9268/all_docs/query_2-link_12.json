        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nInfectious diseases such as malaria, HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and SARS-CoV-2, as well as several autoimmune diseases, are associated with an increased frequency of circulating atypical B cells (atBCs) (1–3). AtBCs express low levels of CD21, lack expression of CD27—the classical human memory B cell (MBC) marker—and upregulate several inhibitory receptors, the integrin CD11c, and express the transcription factor T-bet (4–8). Although CD21−CD27− B cells differ phenotypically to varying degrees across disease states and have been referred to as ‘atypical’, ‘exhausted’, ‘tissue-like’ or ‘alternative lineage’ B cells, these cells tend to share common features such as the upregulation of inhibitory receptors and diminished B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and reduced cytokine production in response to stimulation in vitro (5, 9–12). These findings have led to the hypothesis that atBCs may be anergic or ‘exhausted’ through chronic or repeated exposure to antigen and inflammation.\n\nMalaria is a mosquito-transmitted disease that remains a serious global health threat, causing an estimated 627,000 deaths and 241 million clinical cases worldwide in 2020 (13). Of the five Plasmodium parasite species that are known to cause human malaria, P. falciparum (Pf) is the most prevalent in Africa and is responsible for the majority of malaria deaths (13). In areas of intense Pf transmission, naturally acquired immunity to severe malaria typically develops within the first 5 years of life (14), but immunity to uncomplicated febrile malaria is generally not acquired until early adulthood (14). Even after decades of Pf exposure, individuals rarely appear to develop sterile immunity (15, 16). Antibodies are known to play a central role in immunity to Pf malaria (17), so it has been postulated that the expansion of atBCs may contribute to the inefficient acquisition of humoral immunity to malaria.\n\nCompared to healthy U.S. adults, in whom 2–4% of total circulating B cells are CD21−CD27− (6), atBCs are increased in individuals residing across diverse malaria-endemic regions (18–21). In Mali, for example, atBCs comprise on average 15–20% of total mature B cells in children and up to 40% in healthy adults (6). In addition, the degree of atBC expansion appears to correlate with Pf transmission intensity (18, 22). Exposure of primary human B cells to INF-γ and BCR crosslinking in vitro induces the expansion of T-bethi atBCs (8), suggesting that malaria-induced Th1-cytokine responses may contribute to atBC differentiation.\n\nAlthough one report provided evidence of Pf-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) transcripts produced by atBCs in vivo and showed that broadly neutralizing Pf-specific antibodies (Abs) can be cloned from atBCs (21), others have found that atBCs have a reduced capacity to produce antibodies in response to culture conditions that readily induce classical MBCs to secrete antibodies (5, 12). In these studies, hyporesponsiveness of atBCs was associated with the expression of inhibitory receptors such as FcγRIIb and Fc receptor-like-5 (FcRL5) (12). However, it was shown that Plasmodium-specific atBCs proliferate in the mouse infection model (23), and that human FcRL5+ CD11c+ atBCs expand in response to Pf infection (24). In addition, human atBCs expand in response to Pf sporozoite (PfSPZ)-vaccination (10) and influenza vaccination (25). Finally, FcRL5 is expressed by tetanus vaccine-induced MBCs (26), suggesting that atBCs may be related to recently activated BCs (actBCs), although some studies have shown that atBCs and actBC are transcriptionally distinct (9, 10, 27).\n\nHere, within a longitudinal cohort study in Mali we tested the hypothesis that Pf-specific atBCs play an active role during acute malaria infection. To do so, we compared BCR sequences, transcriptomes and surface marker expression of Pf-specific and influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific atBCs, actBCs and MBCs at the healthy pre-infection baseline and shortly after an acute febrile malaria episode. In response to acute malaria, we found that Pf-specific atBCs increase in frequency and upregulate molecules that mediate B-T cell interactions, suggesting that atBCs can productively engage T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. We tested this hypothesis in vitro and found that atBCs of malaria-exposed individuals differentiate into CD38+ antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in the presence of Tfh cells and Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB).\n\nRESULTS\n\nPf- and HA-specific B cells are not disproportionately enriched for atBCs.\n\nMost studies of atBCs in malaria-endemic areas have not examined B cell responses at the antigen specific level. Therefore, the biology of Pf-specific atBCs and their frequency relative to atBCs specific for other pathogens remains only partially understood. To address these knowledge gaps we developed flow cytometry–based probes to detect B cells specific for two immunodominant Pf proteins: apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (PfMSP1), as previously described (28, 29). To increase the number of Pf-specific B cells detected in each sample, PBMCs were stained simultaneously with PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 probes ( ) such that PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 probe-binding cells were indistinguishable and together are referred to as Pf+ cells. As a comparator non-malaria antigen probe, we used the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus subtypes H1N1 or H3N2, which circulate in Mali (28, 30). Influenza appears to circulate year round in West Africa, with two peaks between January–March and August–November (30). Having confirmed the specificity of the Pf and HA probes (28), we first conducted a cross-sectional, ex vivo analysis of Pf- and HA-specific B cells using cryopreserved PBMCs collected from healthy Malian children (aged 5–17 years; n=34) and adults (aged 18–36 years; n=20) at the end of the 6-month dry season (December-May), a period of negligible Pf transmission. PBMC samples were obtained from individuals enrolled in the Kalifabougou cohort in Mali where Pf transmission is intense and seasonal, as previously described (15).\n\nWe first asked whether Pf and HA-specific atBCs exist in this cohort, and if so, whether they differ proportionally from atBCs within the total B cell population. We distinguished B cell subsets based on CD21 and CD27 expression and determined proportions of atBCs (CD21− CD27−), MBCs (CD21+ CD27+) and actBCs (CD21− CD27+) within antigen-specific and total CD19+ CD10− IgD− antigen-experienced B cells ( ). Consistent with prior studies conducted in Mali (6, 12, 31), atBCs comprised on average 21% of total CD10− IgD− B cells in children and 26% of total CD10− IgD− B cells in adults at the healthy baseline in May at the end of the dry season, while only 4% of CD10− IgD− B cells in malaria-naïve U.S. were atBCs ( ). The proportion of atBCs within the Pf-specific B cell compartment was similar to that of the total B cell population, with an average of 20% in Malian children and 27% in Malian adults. Compared to Pf-specific B cells, the average proportion of HA-specific atBCs tended to be lower in Malian children and adults (16% and 17%, respectively), but these differences were not statistically significant ( ). On average, 10% of HA-specific B cells were atBCs in U.S. adults, ( ), in line with prior reports (32). Together these data indicate that Pf-specific B cells are not disproportionately atBCs, and that atBCs are not limited to Pf-specific B cells in this setting.\n\nPf- and HA-specific actBCs increase after febrile malaria.\n\nNext, in a longitudinal analysis we studied the response of Pf- and HA-specific B cells to an acute febrile malaria episode, relative to the healthy baseline in May. From the same children described above, we analyzed convalescent PBMCs collected one week after treatment of their first febrile malaria episode of the 6-month malaria season (June-November). Although the average percentage of Pf- and HA-specific atBCs increased from baseline (May) to convalescence (one week after treatment of acute malaria), this was not statistically significant ( ). The average percentage of Pf-specific actBCs increased from 15% to 30%, while HA-specific actBCs increased to a lesser degree ( ). The average percentage of Pf-specific MBCs decreased from baseline to convalescence, suggesting that some Pf-specific actBCs may originate from resting MBCs in response to acute malaria. B cell subset distributions did not vary significantly with age (fig. S1).\n\nPf-specific atBCs, actBCs and MBCs share B cell clones and have comparable somatic hypermutation.\n\nTo investigate the origin of the Pf-specific atBC lineage, we sequenced the BCR of single Pf-specific CD19+ CD10− atBCs, actBCs and MBCs sorted from PBMCs of healthy Malian adults (n=12) collected at the end of the malaria season. We defined clonality as usage of the same V and J genes, and >85% similarity in a CDR3 region of the same length. We identified clonal relationships between all three B cell subsets ( ), suggesting that Pf-specific atBCs, actBCs and MBCs are derived from common affinity-matured B cells, in line with what has previously been shown for total non-antigen specific B cell subsets in malaria-exposed individuals (10). Next, we estimated heavy chain somatic hypermutation (SHM) frequencies for Pf-specific BCRs based on germline BCR sequences in IMGT/V-QUEST (33). We found that all three B cell subsets were antigen-experienced and had comparable SHM frequencies (atBCs: 33 ±16; actBCs: 31 ±14; MBCs: 33 ±17 mutations per heavy chain) ( ). Analysis of V and J gene usage showed no significant enrichment for a particular V or J gene among Pf-specific B cell subsets, although IGHV3–23 and IGHV4–30-4 were frequently used ( ).\n\nPf-specific atBCs are transcriptionally distinct from Pf-specific actBCs and MBCs at the healthy baseline.\n\nTo gain insight into the function of atBCs we performed a transcriptomic analysis of antigen-specific B cell subsets. Pf- and HA-specific IgD− CD10− B cells were bulk sorted into atBCs, actBCs and MBCs from PBMCs collected from Malian children (n=16; aged 11–14 years) at their healthy baseline and one week after treatment of their first febrile malaria episode of the ensuing season (see for sorting strategy). Not all six sorted populations were available for every donor (cell counts ranged from 0–47 cells, see table S1) and 65 transcriptome libraries were sequenced. Low-expression filters during data processing resulted in the removal of 20 samples, with 45 samples remaining available for paired differential gene expression (DEG) analysis.\n\nWe first compared the transcriptional profiles of Pf-specific atBCs, actBCs and MBCs at the healthy baseline. Compared to MBCs, Pf-specific atBCs expressed significantly higher levels of several genes that have previously been shown to be upregulated by total atBCs (10, 12), including TBX21 (T-bet) and ITGAX (CD11c), while CD21 and CD27 were downregulated as expected ( ). Pf-specific atBCs also expressed higher levels of PDCD1 (PD-1), and lower levels of ICAM1, CD24, CD38, CXCR3, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10, relative to Pf-specific MBCs ( ). The transcriptional regulator TOX2 was upregulated, while BcL-xL and IRAK2 were downregulated in Pf-specific atBCs relative to Pf-specific MBCs ( ). Pf-specific atBCs displayed an interleukin receptor profile that was distinct from Pf-specific MBCs, characterized by reduced expression of genes encoding the IL-5 and IL-13 receptors ( ). Although some features of Pf-specific atBCs, such as the downregulation of TLR7 and 10, were unique to Pf-specific atBCs, other DEGs were shared by Pf-specific and HA-specific atBCs at the healthy baseline.\n\nTo determine biological pathway and upstream regulator analysis that distinguish Pf-specific atBCs, we performed an Ingenuity upstream regulators analysis based on DEGs of the following comparisons: atBCs vs actBCs, atBCs vs MBCs, and actBCs vs MBCs. We found that the upregulation of IL-10, IL-6, TNFα and IRF4, observed in Pf-specific atBCs relative to actBCs, but not HA-specific atBCs, was predicted to be causally linked to the pathway downstream of MALT1 ( ). Furthermore, compared to MBCs, in Pf-, but not HA-specific atBCs, the downregulation of pathways downstream of IL-2 was linked to the upregulation of T-bet ( ). Next, to identify biological pathways that characterize Pf-specific atBCs, actBCs and MBCs, we determined significant overlap between DEGs of the three cell subset comparisons and Ingenuity canonical pathways ( ). Compared to Pf-specific actBCs, Pf-specific atBCs exhibit an intracellular signaling profile that suggests a reduced response to CD40. In comparison to Pf-specific MBCs, the intracellular signaling profile of Pf-specific atBCs suggests an attenuated response to IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, the B-T cell synapse and actin cytoskeleton signaling ( ), consistent with previous data showing that total atBCs are hyporesponsive to signals that typically activate MBCs (12).\n\nPf-specific atBCs and actBCs have a similar transcriptional response to acute malaria.\n\nNext, we sought to gain insight into how Pf-specific atBCs respond functionally to acute malaria by comparing antigen-specific B cell subset transcriptomes one week after treatment of acute febrile malaria to the baseline transcriptomes described above. Paired samples from the same 16 children described above were used for this analysis. Transcriptome libraries (n=91) were sequenced and data from 16 samples were removed by low expression filters in the subsequent data processing, leaving 75 samples available for paired analysis of DEGs. Relative to baseline, febrile malaria induced the greatest number of transcriptional changes in Pf-specific atBCs, and Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs had the greatest overlap in DEGs ( ). Pf-specific MBCs appeared comparatively quiescent, possibly because activation of resting MBCs downregulates CD21 (34), thus excluding responsive MBCs from the MBC gate during the flow sort. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs were transcriptionally similar to each other and distinct from Pf-specific MBCs, particularly in response to acute malaria ( ). This trend was seen for both the Pf- and HA-specific B cell subsets ( ).\n\nNext, we performed Ingenuity canonical pathway analysis using DEGs of atBCs, actBCs and MBCs at convalescence relative to healthy baseline. Several canonical pathways underrepresented in Pf-specific atBCs at baseline ( ), were overrepresented in response to acute malaria, including Rac, CD40, and actin cytoskeleton signaling, as well as pathways involving the generation of inositol phosphate compounds ( ). In contrast, HA-specific atBCs appeared relatively quiescent in response to malaria ( ). We did not identify statistically significant activation or inhibition of pathways among Pf-specific actBCs and MBCs in response to acute malaria, although all pathways activated in Pf-specific atBCs also trended toward activation in actBCs ( ), underscoring the relatedness of these B cell subsets.\n\nNext, we performed Ingenuity upstream regulator analysis using DEGs of each B cell subset at convalescence relative to healthy baseline, to identify regulators that may be involved in orchestrating the response of atBCs to acute malaria. We identified IL-4 and IL-5 as upstream regulators of atBCs in response to acute malaria ( ), as well as transcriptional regulators NUPR1, FOXO3 and TBX2, consistent with earlier studies of total atBC (8, 12). Except for NUPR1, these predicted upstream regulators were unique to Pf-specific atBCs and were not observed in HA-specific atBCs ( ).\n\nIn summary, this analysis provides transcriptional evidence that Pf-specific atBCs are activated during acute malaria in children. This is in line with previous observations that malaria-associated total atBCs have an activated phenotype that manifests as elevated levels of phosphorylated kinases (12).\n\nPf-specific atBCs upregulate IL-5RA, CD38, PRDM1, CXCR3, TLR7, 9 and 10 in response to acute malaria.\n\nWhile many DEGs were shared by Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs, certain DEGs that distinguished Pf-specific atBCs at baseline ( ) were uniquely regulated in Pf-specific atBCs in response to malaria. For example, CXCL16, TNFα, IL-6, STAT4 and IL21R were expressed at higher levels in Pf-specific atBCs relative to actBCs at baseline ( ), and were uniquely downregulated by Pf-specific, but not HA-specific atBCs in response to malaria ( ). Conversely, IL-5RA, CD38 and TLR7 were expressed at lower levels in Pf-specific atBCs compared to actBCs at baseline, and then were upregulated by Pf-specific atBCs, but not HA-specific atBCs in response to malaria ( ). PRDM1, which encodes for B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1), and CD38 were upregulated in Pf-specific atBCs in response to malaria ( ), suggesting activation of pathways involved in differentiation into ASCs.\n\nPf-specific atBCs and actBCs express markers indicative of T cell interactions.\n\nPrevious studies found that total atBCs upregulate proteins involved in antigen presentation to T cells, including ICOSL, CD86 and HLA-DR (9, 12, 35). To determine if Pf-specific atBCs upregulate these proteins, we performed flow cytometry analysis of paired PBMC samples collected from 2–17-year-olds (see supplementary data file 1 for additional information) at baseline before the malaria season, and one week after treatment of their first malaria episode of the ensuing malaria season. At baseline, both total and Pf-specific atBCs expressed higher levels of ICOSL compared to Pf-specific actBCs and MBCs ( ), consistent with the non-statistically significant trend we observed in the RNA-seq data ( ). However, in response to malaria, Pf-specific atBCs downregulated ICOSL at the protein and RNA levels, although only the former was statistically significant ( & , Conv(ΔHB)). Both total and Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs upregulated CD86 in response to malaria relative to baseline ( ), which was not observed in the RNA-seq data. However, the RNA-seq analysis did show that Pf-specific atBCs upregulate HLA-DPA1, -B1, -DQB2, -DRA, -B1 and -B5 compared to Pf-specific MBCs ( ), suggesting that atBCs may have an increased capacity for antigen presentation. By flow cytometry we confirmed that HLA-DR was expressed at significantly higher levels on Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs compared to Pf-specific MBCs in response to malaria ( ). Collectively, these data suggest that Pf-specific atBCs upregulate molecules that mediate interactions with CD4 T cells. Moreover, the percentage of Pf-specific atBCs that were Ki67+ increased significantly at convalescence ( ), which taken together with the upregulation of CXCR3 ( ) and the lack of significant expansion of peripheral Pf-specific atBCs at convalescence ( ), suggests that Pf-specific atBCs may be recruited to secondary lymphoid organs during acute malaria.\n\nPf-specific atBCs and actBCs upregulate T-bet and FcRL5 after malaria, while only atBCs maintain expression of these markers through the dry season.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that T-bet is upregulated in total atBCs of malaria-exposed children and adults (8). Here, we found by flow cytometry that T-bet expression is upregulated at baseline in both Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs relative to classical MBCs, although a significantly higher proportion of total, Pf- and HA-specific atBCs were T-bethi compared to actBCs ( ). In response to acute malaria the proportion of T-bethi cells increased for both Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs, with the increase being particularly marked for Pf-specific actBCs ( ). These results approximate the RNA-seq data that showed higher TBX21 expression in Pf-specific atBCs compared to Pf-specific actBCs and MBCs at baseline, and upregulation of TBX21 in Pf-specific actBCs and MBCs in response to malaria ( ). However, in contrast to Pf-specific actBCs, Pf-specific atBCs appear to maintain high T-bet expression in the absence of ongoing exposure to malaria (i.e. at baseline at the end of the 6-month dry season) ( & ).\n\nSimilarly, FcRL5, another marker of atBCs, was upregulated at baseline in both Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs relative to classical MBCs, although a significantly higher proportion of Pf-specific atBCs were FcRL5+ compared to Pf-specific actBCs ( ). To assess the stability of FcRL5 expression in the absence of ongoing malaria exposure, we analyzed B cells collected from the same individuals at the beginning (December) and end (May) of the dry season when Pf transmission is negligible. While the proportion of FcRL5+ Pf -specific atBCs and actBCs both decreased over the dry season, the decrease was only statistically significant for Pf -specific actBCs ( ).\n\nIn summary, Pf-specific atBCs appear more likely to retain T-bet and FcRL5 expression even at homeostasis, in contrast to Pf-specific actBCs that readily upregulate these molecules in response to malaria, but then partially lose their expression in the absence of ongoing malaria exposure.\n\nAtBCs upregulate CD38 and secrete IgG and IgM in the presence of Tfh cells.\n\nIn the germinal center (GC), Tfh cells provide critical support for the differentiation of naive B cells into isotype-switched, affinity-matured long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and classical MBCs through contact-dependent and soluble signals including the T cell receptor, ICOS, CD28, CD40L and IL-21 (36). Whether Tfh cells can activate atBCs and induce their differentiation into ASCs is unknown. Based on our observation that Pf-specific atBCs express higher levels of HLA-DR and ICOSL relative to MBCs, and upregulate CD86, CD40-signaling and the IL-21 receptor in response to malaria, we hypothesized that atBCs may be poised for productive interactions with Tfh cells. We tested this hypothesis with PBMCs collected from study participants aged 12–19 years who had experienced febrile malaria episodes during the sampling timeframe of 2014–2020. From these samples we FACS-sorted atBCs, MBCs and actBCs ( ), along with autologous CD4+ CD3+ CD45RO+ CXCR5+ PD-1+ circulating Tfh cells (cTfh) ( ) that are known to resemble GC-Tfh cells phenotypically and functionally (37, 38). We then co-cultured cTfh cells with each B cell subset for 7 days with or without the superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) to mimic the interaction between antigen-specific T cells and antigen-presenting B cells (37, 38). On average, we found that cTfh cells induced the expression of the activation/plasmablast marker CD38 in approximately 60% of atBCs, and 95% of MBCs ( – ). Accordingly, cTfh cells induced atBCs to secrete IgM and IgG1–4, albeit at 2-log lower levels than that produced by MBCs ( – ). Secretion of IgA or IgE by atBCs was not detected (fig. S3). Thus, while atBCs appear to have a reduced capacity to respond to soluble antigen through the BCR (12), these data suggest that atBCs can be activated and can differentiate into ASCs in the presence of Tfh cells.\n\nDiscussion\n\natBCs are associated with several infectious and autoimmune diseases, yet their origin and function remain only partially understood, particularly at the level of antigen-specific atBCs. Moreover, in the case of infection-associated atBCs, the extent to which atBCs are specific for the infecting pathogen remains unclear. Here we conducted a longitudinal study of Malian children and adults to investigate the biology of Pf- and influenza (HA)-specific atBCs at the homeostatic baseline before the malaria season and in response to an acute symptomatic Pf infection during the ensuing malaria season. We found that in response to acute malaria Pf-specific atBCs activated pathways involved in differentiation into ASCs and upregulated molecules that mediate B-T cell interactions. Consistent with these ex vivo findings, atBCs of malaria-exposed individuals differentiated into CD38+ ASCs in vitro in the presence of autologous Tfh cells, suggesting that atBCs have the capacity to contribute to humoral responses during malaria infection with Tfh cell support.\n\nRegarding the specificity of atBCs in the context of malaria exposure, we found that the proportions of Pf- and HA-specific atBCs were similar, and comparable to the proportion of atBCs within total B cells, indicating that atBCs are not disproportionately Pf-specific and are not limited to Pf-specific B cells in this setting. In contrast, a recent study in Kenya showed that Pf-specific B cells were more likely than tetanus-toxoid (TT)-specific B cells to be atBCs (22). The discordant findings between the Kenya study and the present work may be due in part to differences in the frequency of HA exposure (annual) versus TT exposure (childhood vaccine). Aye et al. (22) also found that malaria exposure correlated with a higher proportion of Pf-specific and TT-specific atBCs, suggesting that malaria drives the atBC phenotype in both Pf-specific and bystander B cells (22). In malaria-endemic areas it will be of interest to study atBCs specific for a broader range of non-malaria pathogens and vaccine antigens to better define the relationship between the quality and frequency of antigen exposure and atBC differentiation.\n\nWe found that HA-specific actBCs increase in frequency in response to acute malaria ( ), suggesting that HA-specific actBCs may undergo heterologous activation in the context of malaria-induced inflammation. It is also possible that some of the shared transcriptional changes between Pf- and HA-specific actBCs are the result of malaria-induced inflammation rather than antigen-driven ( ). Of note, in response to acute malaria, HA-specific actBCs upregulated CD38 but not PRDM1, suggesting that HA-specific actBCs do not necessarily differentiate into ASCs during malaria infection ( ). Additionally, the August-November peak of Influenza in West Africa overlaps with the malaria season, which may have contributed to the activation of HA-specific B cells in some participants.\n\nConcerning the origin and clonality of atBCs, BCR-seq analysis provided evidence of comparable SHM rates and clonal relationships between Pf-specific atBCs, actBCs and MBCs, suggesting that these subsets originate from common affinity-matured B cell precursors. This is consistent with prior studies of bulk B cell subsets in malaria-exposed individuals in Mali (12), Kenya (10) and Uganda (39), but at odds with a study in Gabon that showed little evidence of clonal relationship between atBCs and MBCs (21).\n\nRNA-seq analysis of Pf-specific atBCs shed light on their phenotype and potential origin and function. Pf-specific atBCs have a muted intracellular signaling response to cytokines and T cell interactions, which is consistent with previous functional studies of bulk atBCs (12). In addition, Pf-specific atBCs at the healthy baseline, relative to actBCs, express higher levels of STAT4 and the genes encoding the IL-12- and IL-21-receptors. IL-12 has been shown to induce a cascade of events in B cells that is similar to Th1-commitment, including STAT4 activation and upregulation of T-bet- and the IL-12-receptor (40). Furthermore, IL-21 drives naïve B cells to a CD27low T-bet+ FcRL5+ IL-21R+ CD11c+ phenotype (41). Together, these findings point toward potential roles for IL-12 and IL-21 in the differentiation of Pf-specific atBCs (see model in Fig. S4).\n\nAt the healthy baseline, Pf-specific atBCs also expressed lower levels of TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 relative to actBCs and MBCs. Downregulation of TLR9 by Pf-specific atBCs (i.e. PfAMA1/MSP1-specific atBCs) in Malian donors is consistent with the finding that the TLR9-agonist CpG as an adjuvant did not enhance antibody or MBC responses to the PfAMA1 or PfMSP1 malaria vaccine candidates in Malian adults (42), while CpG enhanced responses to the same vaccines in malaria-naïve U.S. adults (43).\n\nIn response to acute febrile malaria, we found that both Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs were activated, proliferated, upregulated molecules involved in T cell interactions, and generally shared similar transcriptional profiles. Although Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs shared the putative upstream regulators IL-4, IL-5 and NUPR1, several other upstream regulators distinguished the two subsets, suggesting that different signals might activate the subsets during acute malaria. In response to malaria, the atBC markers T-bet and FcRL5 were upregulated in Pf-specific atBCs and actBCs, in line with a previous study of total human B cell subsets after malaria exposure (24) and studies showing that T-bethi HA-specific B cells arise following vaccination (25, 44). This indicates that T-bet and FcRL5 are stable markers of atBCs, as well as markers of recent activation of non-atBCs. However, by the end of the subsequent 6-month dry season (a period of negligible malaria transmission) T-bet and FcRL5 expression only decreased significantly in actBCs, suggesting heterogeneity in commitment to the T-bet+ FcRL5+ atBC phenotype in the absence of ongoing Pf exposure.\n\nRelative to the healthy baseline, only Pf-specific atBCs upregulated TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 expression in response to acute malaria. A previous study reported that the Pf erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) induces TLR7 and TLR10 expression and sensitizes B cells to TLR9 signaling (45). TLR9 signaling may in turn contribute to T-bet expression in Pf-specific atBCs (see model in Fig. S4), as it was reported that CpG or Plasmodium DNA together with IFN-γ induce T-bet expression in murine B cells (46, 47) and in our Ingenuity upstream regulator analysis, CpG was identified as a predicted upstream regulator in Pf-specific atBCs in response to malaria (fig. S2).\n\nIn prior work we showed that malaria-associated atBCs have a markedly reduced capacity to be stimulated by soluble antigen through their BCR to proliferate, secrete cytokines or produce antibodies (12). A recent study found that malaria-associated atBCs signal through the BCR in response to planar lipid bilayers (PLB) containing F(ab′)2 anti-λ/κ as a surrogate antigen to mimic presentation of antigen to B cells by follicular dendritic cells (35). The study also showed that atBCs capture and internalize anti-λ/κ bound to flexible plasma membrane sheets; and moreover, in response to PLB-associated anti-λ/κ, CpG, BAFF, IL-21, IL-2, and IL-10, atBCs expressed IRF4 mRNA, an early marker of plasma cell differentiation (35). However, it remained unknown if malaria-associated atBCs have the capacity to differentiate into ASCs. Our ex vivo data and in vitro experiments suggest that with the help of Tfh cells, atBCs may differentiate into ASCs during a malaria infection. Previous studies have shown that the frequencies of atBCs and cTfh cells correlate with each other, and that malaria-induced IFNγ, as well as IL-21 and CD40L signals contribute to atBC differentiation (8, 48). Our data suggest that Tfh cells may also contribute to the activation and differentiation of atBCs into ASC.\n\nIn addition to a potential role for atBCs in antibody production, we found evidence that atBCs may have the capacity to present antigen in vivo, consistent with the previous in vitro observation of internalization of membrane-associated antigen by atBCs (35). For example, we found by RNA-seq and flow cytometry that Pf-specific atBCs upregulate MHC class II molecules relative to MBCs. Additionally, atBCs express the integrin CD11c, which is also expressed by dendritic cells (DCs), and in mice, a CD11c+ subset phenotypically similar to atBCs was shown to have efficient antigen-presentation capacity by forming stable interactions with T cells (49). Furthermore, we found by RNA-seq that atBCs upregulate CXCL16, a transmembrane chemokine typically expressed by antigen-presenting DCs in the T cell zone.\n\nThis study has limitations. We investigated B cells specific for the immunodominant and polymorphic asexual blood-stage antigens PfAMA1 and PfMSP1. In future studies it will be of interest to determine if the frequency and quality of PfAMA1- and PfMSP1-specific B cells are representative of B cells specific for other Pf antigens. Furthermore, although we found that bulk atBCs can be activated to secrete antibodies by Tfh cells in vitro, the low frequency of Pf-specific atBCs precluded similar experiments at the antigen-specific level. A further limitation is that in vitro activation of B cells by cTfh cells and SEB bypasses the BCR, therefore it remains possible that B cell activation initiated through antigen binding and internalization could attenuate responses driven by Tfh-B cell contact. We previously found that malaria induces a Th1 cytokine response and activates a less-functional Th1-like CXCR3+ Tfh subset (38). In the current study, due to limited sample availability we were unable to test Tfh subsets of interest for their ability to activate atBCs. In addition, here we examined the impact of acute febrile malaria on Pf-specific B cells, and so by definition, study participants were malaria-susceptible. In future studies it will be of interest to study Pf-specific B cell responses of individuals who have acquired clinical immunity to malaria. Furthermore, some experiments with small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. Finally, additional studies are needed in other malaria-endemic regions and with different age groups to determine the generalizability of our findings.\n\nIn summary, we found that in response to acute malaria Pf-specific atBCs are activated, increase in frequency, and upregulate molecules that mediate B-T cell interactions. Consistent with these ex vivo findings, we found that atBCs differentiate into ASCs when co-cultured with autologous Tfh cells from malaria-exposed individuals, together suggesting that atBCs may actively contribute to humoral immunity to infectious pathogens."
