        "text": "NOW OUT OF PRINT Title: Prussian Napoleonic Landwehr Infantry and Cavalry 1813-15: Landsturm, Volunteer Cavalry and Streifkorps Publisher: Partizan Press Pages: 224 pages and over 380 colour illustrations. This is the companion volume to the successful two volumes on the Prussian Infantry 1808-1840. The Landwehr and volunteers were essential in the success of the Prussian Army during the Wars of Liberation (1813-1815) against Napoleon. Their participation permitted the army to quadruple in size by August 1813 and become the cutting edge of the Allied Armies. This unique work is the companion to the author’s two volume reference on the Prussian Infantry 1808-1840. It documents the campaign history, organisation, uniforms, horse furniture and their commanders, whether Landwehr (infantry and cavalry), Landsturm, Civil Guard, National Cavalry or Volunteers (Freiwilliger Jäger, Freikorps, and Streifkorps). For the first time in one volume the great diversity of their uniforms are lavishly illustrated and explored in detail, not previously attempted even in German. The work draws upon all the essential sources on Prussian uniforms, including the contemporary works of Elberfeld and Genty. The 380+ colour illustrations include 331 of uniforms after Hans, Brauer, Woldemar Friedrich, Herbert Knötel, Richard Knötel, Bob Marrion, Carl Röchling and Moritz Ruhl plus 18 tables, 12 order of battles, 110 uniform details, saddlecloths and lance pennants.\n\nAlthough soundly defeated in the War of Austrian Succession by the brilliance of Frederick the Great and his Prussian Army, the army of Austria was the most significant of his opponents. Their campaign history has been expertly documented in recent times, but very little has been written on their uniforms. This new volume is a companion to the author’s AUSTRIAN SEVEN YEARS WAR INFANTRY AND ENGINEERS. It documents the campaign history, uniforms, flags, horse furniture as well as a complete record of its Inhaber [colonel-in-chief] for each Austrian cavalry regiment, whether Cuirassier, Chevauleger, Dragoons, Grenz Hussars or Hussars. The work draws upon most of the major sources on Austrian uniforms of the Seven Years War including the contemporary works of Albertini, the Bautzen Manuscript and Raspe which influenced all later artists. The 340+ colour illustrations include 191 of uniforms after Albertini, Brauer, Donath, Knötel, Neucetz and Teuber-Wekersdorf plus 43 flags / standards, 102 uniform / equipment details, 10 line drawings from Die Österreichische Armee 1700-1867 by Ottenfeld & Teuber and 10 Tables. In addition this new volume provides a detailed study of Austrian artillery pieces and organization for the period. The chapter is illustrated with 15 photos of extent guns tubes, 9 plans and 6 Tables. In addition there are 46 short biographies of generals and designers of the Liechtenstein artillery system with 12 portraits.\"\n\nIn the military historiography of the Late Middle Ages, the Swiss are iconic for their heavy infantry, so powerful it supposedly obviated the need for cavalry. However, the Swiss were keenly aware of the importance of mounted fighters to warfare and of their own inability to field effective battlefield cavalry in sufficient numbers. In some instances, the Swiss were unable to exploit opportunities, in others, the dearth of cavalry contributed to a battlefield defeat. The Swiss, collectively and as individual cantons, constantly sought ways to remedy the deficiency by securing allied support or, less successfully, raising their own. Even though the nature of the mounted fighting man changed fundamentally during the period under review, from the elite knight to just another branch of the land forces, the Swiss were never able to solve the conundrum. This chapter reviews the importance of battlefield cavalry in the military history of Switzerland and their successes and failures in addressing the issue, thus illustrating the organisational infrastructure required for raising and maintaining an effective force. Ultimately, it will be shown, the root of the problem lay not in the availability of mounts or similar factors, but in the Swiss Confederacy’s lack of centralised military structures and the political inability or unwillingness of its constituents to adapt their military constitutions – the very factors that produced the vaunted heavy infantry.\n\nThis volume is related to the Russian Army during the zar Paul I era, and are about infantry: fusiliers, grenadiers and muskeeter regiments. Compiled at Saint Petersburg during the year from 1837 and 1851, the Historical Description of the Clothing and Arms of the Russian Army has had an enormous impact and great importance for the study on the history of Russian costume and uniformology development over the past centuries .There are various ancient editions of the work but Mark Conrad’s translation is the first one and the best, remaining true to the original structure and essential style of the text. Conrad’s comprehensive translation is an indispensable resource for today’s historian, strategists, and scholars. The Viskovatov’s enormous work is based on a great quantity of archival documents and contains four thousand colored and b/w illustrations. It is composed by 30 or 34 volumes (1st edition 1-30, St. Petersburg, 1841-62, and 2nd edition Vols. 1-34, St. Petersburg - Novosibirsk - Leningrad, 1899-1948). The topics discussed start from the early czars until the late nineteenth century. Our new edition has enriched the book with the plates: we revised and colored many of the images so far available just in black and white, as well we found some rare color plates with the collaboration of private collectors. These, together with the first ever English translation, make our collection exclusive and of great value.\n\nThis is not a narrative history of the Ulm and Austerlitz campaign of 1805. There are many of these available. This is the superbly illustrated reference book you will keep alongside any other history and refer to time and time again. In this one volume you will find 360 uniforms, 260 uniform schema and details, 55 flags, 58 orders of battle, 31 maps and 85 tables. In all there are over 700 illustrations. My dear friend Stephen Summerfield and I meet up only on infrequent occasions where we have the chance to chat together and plot the sort of books we love and want to publish. Last August (2023), in the middle of a large and open field, whilst walking my dog “Mopsa” (who shows little interest in military history and would rather we write about sticks and rabbits), I suggested a way of developing what we had achieved with our books on Hanau 1813, Friedland 1807 and most particularly the Russia 1812 campaign studies based upon orders of battle and uniforms leaving the campaign narrative to other books. He was unusually left speechless for some minutes and you could see the cogs turning. Finally, he replied, “Brilliant, simple and elegant idea.” Then for rest of the walk described the content of the books I had proposed in detail. I had rarely seen him so animated about a project. In his usual way, Stephen took my inarticulate attempts to describe a style and content and turned them into pure magic. This is the result, much more than a simple book, more a compendium of all the useful information you would like in one place to study what was according to David Chandler, “Napoleon’s finest campaign and battle.” Here, within these pages, are exhaustive orders of battle from August to December 1805, the composition of corps and divisions and how units evolved from their Revolutionary formations, essential details of the working structure of Napoleon’s army, how and where they marched towards their famous victory, maps galore, and of course their flags, eagles and their uniforms. When I say uniforms, I do not just mean the obvious infantry and cavalry, but where else are you likely to find such as the Gendarmes, Invalids, the Chasseurs d’Orient, the Regt. de la Tour d’Auvergne, Italians, German States (Baden, Bavaria and Württemberg) and so many others. This is a book not to put on the book shelves but to keep handy, where you can refer to it time and time again. You may be simply studying the campaign, or you may be planning your own campaign game or raising your own model army. Whatever you interest, we sincerely believe that within these pages lies so much of what you need to know and understand."
