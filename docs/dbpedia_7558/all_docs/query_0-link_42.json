        "text": "RR Auction’s November Fine Autographs and Artifacts sale brings over 800 incredible lots to auction, featuring a compelling selection of John F. Kennedy items in honor of the 55th anniversary of his death. Highlights include JFK’s iconic presidential bomber jacket, his rocking chair from the Carlyle, and a wealth of important handwritten notes, signed photographs, and letter, including one from Jackie reflecting on her tragic flight home from Dallas on Air Force One. An amazing map annotated by Fidel Castro to show the Bay of Pigs invasion represents one of the greatest foreign policy challenges of Kennedy’s presidency. In addition to these are a diverse selection of outstanding items from throughout history: a letter by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, an autograph document by George Washington using slaves as collateral, a Beatles signed photograph, a compelling archive of Greta Garbo’s letters, and a comprehensive assortment of Napoleonic Marshals round out these fine offerings."
