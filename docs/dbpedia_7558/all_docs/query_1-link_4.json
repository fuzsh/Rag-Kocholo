        "text": "Many of Napoleon's marshals began their service in the rank and file, and all of them repeatedly risked their lives during the battles. But most of them died of disease and old age, and their fate proved the validity of the well-known paradoxical statement that for any person the most dangerous place on earth is his own bed: after all, it is on his own bed that the vast majority of people die. Only three out of 26 imperial marshals perished on the battlefield - Lannes, Bessières, Ponyatovsky. Two more, Murat and Ney, were shot after Bonaparte's second abdication. Having long left military service, Brune was torn to pieces by a mob of royalists on August 2, 1815. Under mysterious circumstances, Berthier died, whose body was found on June 1, 1815 on the pavement under the window of his wife's ancestral castle in the Bavarian city of Bamberg. And one of the marshals of Bonaparte's empire was mortally wounded during a terrorist attack. We will talk about it in today's article.\n\nChildhood and adolescence of Edouard Mortier\n\nAdolphe-Edouard-Casimir-Joseph Mortier was born on February 13, 1768 in the city of Cato-Cambresi (department of Nord) in northern France.\n\nHis father, who was involved in the canvas trade, enjoyed great prestige in the area. In 1789, he was even elected to the State General from the Third Estate. In general, the Mortier family had a certain income, and the future marshal was able to get a good education at the English College in Douai (in the XNUMXth century, this educational institution was founded by Irish emigrants).\n\nA number of subjects were taught in English, which Edouard Mortier mastered perfectly. Therefore, later, when Bonaparte began to prepare an invasion of Britain, it was this marshal that he considered as a possible candidate for the post of military governor of England.\n\nIt seems logical to assume that it was precisely such quite prosperous families that during the revolution were to become the mainstay of royal power. However, even the richest representatives of the Third Estate did not have political rights in France, as reflected in Sieyes's famous pamphlet:\n\n“What is the third state? Everything. What has it been like so far? Nothing.\"\n\nBut in England, according to the decree of James I, the title of noble baronet was received by anyone who could afford to contribute a thousand pounds sterling to the treasury. In France, the way up to the representatives of the Third Estate was closed, and therefore, among the supporters of revolutionary and republican ideas, there were a lot of offspring of the families of respectable merchants and lawyers.\n\nThe beginning of service in the Republican army\n\nBut back to Edouard Mortier, who, after completing his studies, began to work in the Lille branch of the family office.\n\nThis continued until the news of the revolution came. In the Nor department, one of the battalions of the National Guard formed the brother of our hero's father. His nephew was also among the volunteers. After completing a course in military science, Edouard Mortier was promoted to captain in September 1791.\n\nSh-F. Lariviere. Edouard Mortier in the uniform of the Nor volunteer battalion, 1792\n\nThis battalion became part of the Northern Army of General Rochambeau. The first battle in which Mortier took part was the battle of Quievren. It ended in defeat for the French. A horse was killed under Mortier, but he did not lose his presence of mind and tried to stop the fleeing subordinates. His bravery was noticed by his superiors.\n\nLater, Mortier participated in victorious battles for France at Jemappa, at Neervinden, Ondskot, at Vattigny (here he was wounded). In the battle at Fleurus, Mortier is already in command of the battalion. In June 1795, he becomes a colonel and heads one of the semi-brigades of the Sambre-Meuse army of General Jourdan, where Jean-Baptiste Kleber became his chief. In 1796 he took part in the battles at Altenkirchen and Friedberg.\n\nThe family life of Edouard Mortier\n\nOn January 25, 1799, Colonel Mortier married Eva-Anne Himmes. At that time he was more than 30 years old, his wife was 19. This marriage turned out to be very successful: Mortier loved his wife, who bore him seven children (four girls and three boys). Some of their descendants married the offspring of the families of other marshals and generals of Bonaparte - Guden, Oudinot and Davout.\n\nGeneral Mortier\n\n1799 was generally a stellar year for Edouard Mortier. Immediately after the wedding, he went to the Danube army, where he commanded the vanguard (the 25th semi-brigade and two cavalry regiments). Received the rank of brigadier general. After the defeat of the French at the Battle of Stockach (March 25, 1799) and the withdrawal of the Danube army across the Rhine, he was sent to Switzerland. Here in the Helvetic army of General Massena, he received the post of commander of the 4th division. During the Zurich battle against the corps of General Rimsky-Korsakov (September 14-15, 1799), Mortier's division was in the center of the French army. Having chained up significant enemy forces with her actions, she allowed to strike the parts of the left flank, which were commanded by Oudinot. As a result of this battle, Mortier was promoted to the rank of divisional general. Later he took part in battles against the army of Suvorov in the Mutten Valley.\n\nIn March of the following 1800, he commanded the 2nd Division of the Danube Army, but soon returned to France and was placed at the head of the 17th Military District, where the 15th and 16th divisions were stationed.\n\nMortier supported the coup of the 18th Brumaire, as a result of which Bonaparte became First Consul. After that, he was appointed commander of the Paris district, which was extremely important not only militarily, but also politically.\n\nIn May 1803, Mortier was put in charge of the troops tasked with occupying Hanover. Divisional General Leopold Berthier, the younger brother of the famous marshal, became the chief of staff of his corps.\n\nUntil 1804, Mortier was in this elector, then he ceded the post of commander to Bernadotte. Upon arrival in Paris, Mortier was appointed commander of the artillery units of the consular guard.\n\nMarshal Mortier\n\nIn 1804, after the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte, Edouard Mortier became one of the first marshals of France.\n\nMonument to Mortier on the Town Hall Square of Cato Cambresi\n\nYou may be interested to know that Mortier was the tallest of Bonaparte's marshals, his height is 195 cm (in second place in this indicator is Murat with a height of 190 cm). Contrary to popular belief, Napoleon himself, with a height of 168,6 cm, was not considered a short man at that time. The fact is that no one had even heard of acceleration in those days, and the average height of the French infantrymen was only 165 cm. Above were the gunners (average height - 174 cm) and cuirassiers (176 cm). But it so happened that most of the people from the inner circle of the emperor were taller than him. And his guards looked especially tall because of their bear hats. It was against their background that Bonaparte seemed short.\n\nThe reaction of Edouard Mortier's father to the news that his son was awarded the rank of marshal is curious:\n\n\"Tell him to remain an honest man.\"\n\nAnd I must say that Edouard Mortier, according to the general opinion, really stood out with his behavior among Napoleon's marshals. Bonaparte, who owns the aphorism “the surest way to stay poor is to be an honest person\", Once called him\"the poorest of the marshals».\n\nContemporaries also note Mortier's cheerful disposition, his modesty and non-ambition. He was one of the few who had virtually no personal enemies. The only thing that Mortier did not tolerate in people was alcohol abuse: he did not hesitate to call drunkards pigs.\n\nAnother positive quality of this marshal was a humane attitude towards prisoners, for this reason, during the war in Spain, he was highly respected by his opponents, the British.\n\nCombat campaigns 1805-1807\n\nAfter the surrender of Mack's army at Ulm, Napoleon ordered the combined VIII Corps of Mortier to cross to the northern bank of the Danube and move towards Durnstein. But Kutuzov's army was also able to cross the river, destroying the bridges at Mautern and Krems behind them. Murat, who was also operating on the northern coast, threw his troops towards Vienna and captured the capital of Austria. But at the same time, Mortier's corps found itself in a difficult position, finding itself alone against the entire Russian army. As a result, the 6-thousandth division of Honoré Gazan from the Mortier corps was forced to engage in battle with the troops of Miloradovich, numbering up to 24 thousand people. At the same time, Russian combat units under the command of Dokhturov went into the rear of this division, which found itself in a desperate situation. Mortier was offered to cross to the other side, but he remained with his troops.\n\nAuguste Sandoz. Marshal Mortier at the Battle of Durnstein\n\nThe situation was saved by the division of General Dupont, which attacked the Russian troops on the move. As a result, both sides declared themselves victors, Kutuzov was awarded the Grand Cross of the Austrian Order of Maria Theresa, Gazan received the Grand Officer's Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honor. But the losses of the parties were approximately equal.\n\nIn the subsequent battle of Austerlitz, the Mortier corps did not participate, as it was sent to Vienna.\n\nAfter the defeat of Prussia in 1806, Mortier, together with Louis Bonaparte (then the King of Holland), captured the Elector of Hesse-Kassel, and then occupied Hamburg, Bremen, Nienburg and part of Swedish Pomerania.\n\nAt the end of April 1807, Mortier with his troops arrived in Prussia, on the territory of which French and Russian troops were then fighting. Here in June the decisive battle of this campaign took place at Friedland. Lannes entered the battle with the superior forces of the Russians. Mortier Corps was the first to come to the rescue. Fighting all day together, the troops of Lannes and Mortier held out until the approach of the main forces, led by Napoleon. In this battle, Mortier's horse was killed by a cannonball. In recognition of his merits, on May 19, 1808, Mortier received the title of Duke of Treviso from the emperor.\n\nE. L. Dubouf. Marshal Mortier, Duke of Treviso\n\nWar in spain\n\nNapoleon did not allow his marshals and dukes to be bored, and in the fall of 1808 Mortier was sent to Spain. Here he received command of the V corps, with which he participated in the heavy siege of Zaragoza, then defeated the enemy troops in the battle of Artsobispo (August 8, 1809). He was able to achieve the greatest success in the battle of Okanye, where on November 18 of the same year, having under the command of about 34 thousand soldiers, he met with a 52-thousand enemy army. The battle ended with the complete defeat of the Spaniards, of whom more than 25 thousand people were taken prisoner alone. And Mortier received another wound in this battle.\n\nIn 1811 he was subordinate to Soult. At the same time, unlike other marshals, who in Spain usually acted as they pleased, not paying attention to both the higher authorities and the neighbors, he expressed his readiness to obey him. Together they managed to defeat the Spaniards at Gebor and capture Badajoz.\n\nIn mid-1811, Mortier was recalled to Paris, where he became commander of the Young Guard. In this position, he took part in the campaign of 1812.\n\n1812 year\n\nGuard Napoleon took care of, and therefore Mortier's subordinates did not take an active part in the battles of the first stage of this campaign. Despite the requests of a number of marshals, the emperor did not dare to throw the Young Guard into battle in the Battle of Borodino. After the entry of the French army into Moscow, it was Mortier who was appointed governor of the city. He could not ensure order in the deserted city, however, it was hardly possible.\n\nD. Kardovsky. The French in Moscow abandoned by residents\n\nIt all ended, as you know, with a grandiose fire, which was impossible to extinguish due to the lack of firefighting equipment.\n\nThis is how A.F.Smirnov portrayed the fire of Moscow, who at the age of 15 was in the city in September 1812\n\nAs a result, Napoleon's Grand Army literally found itself \"at a broken trough\": a large city with ready-made apartments to accommodate personnel burned down, and huge reserves of food and fodder were lost in the fire. The battle of Tarutino showed that there would be no peace talks. The great army was rapidly decaying, winter was approaching, the retreat turned into a flight.\n\nLeaving Moscow, Napoleon gave one of his most shameful orders - to blow up the Moscow Kremlin. This criminal order was to be executed by Marshal Mortier, who was delayed in Moscow with an 8-strong detachment. The townspeople whom the French managed to find were driven to the Kremlin. For three days they dug digs in which barrels of gunpowder were laid. Fortunately, heavy rain extinguished many of the fuses, but the damage to the ancient fortress was still done. The Vodovzvodnaya tower was destroyed, three more survived, but three more were damaged - Nikolskaya, 1st Bezymyanny and Petrovskaya. A section of the Kremlin wall, part of the Arsenal, as well as later additions to the Ivan the Great Bell Tower collapsed. By the way, the cavalrymen of A.Kh. Mortier no longer had time to organize repeated explosions. However, he seems to have reported to Napoleon about the complete success of this operation: in a letter to Marie-Louise, the emperor reported the complete destruction of the Kremlin:\n\n“The Kremlin, the Arsenal, military depots, barracks - everything is destroyed. The old fortress, built at the founding of the monarchy itself, the first palaces of the kings - all this is in the past. In the future, Moscow will become a heap of rubble, a dirty unhealthy cesspool of no political or military significance. I leave the city to Russian tramps and looters. \"\n\nPersonally, I do not understand the sense of pride with which Napoleon reports this barbaric action. For this frank confession of a war crime alone, the Russians had every right to take all more or less valuable paintings and statues out of Paris. However, Alexander I wanted to please the \"civilized Europeans\", and therefore did not take any reparations from the French, and compensated for all the losses incurred by Russia exclusively at the expense of the Russian peasants.\n\nMeanwhile, on November 3-6 (15-18) near Krasnoye, for the first time in this campaign, the Young Guard entered the battle with the Russian troops: they came to the aid of Davout's corps retreating from Smolensk.\n\nSubordinates of Mortier and Berezina fought. However, the Young Guard suffered the greatest losses from cold and hunger, as well as in continuous skirmishes with Russian partisan detachments (made up of soldiers and officers of regular troops) and Cossacks that were pursuing the French.\n\nThe last battles of Marshal Mortier\n\nFor the 1813 campaign, units of the Young Guard actually had to be re-created.\n\nThey fought at Lützen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig and Hanau. In December 1813, Mortier received command of two divisions of the Old Guard, with which he participated in the battles of Bar-sur-Aube, Montmirail, Reims, Craon and Laon.\n\nThe denouement came on March 13 (25), 1814, when these Mortier divisions and Marmont's corps were defeated in the battle at Feuer-Champenoise and retreated to the French capital.\n\nOn March 18 (30), 1814, Mortier and Marmont were defeated near Paris and the next day, not wanting to destroy the city during shelling and street battles, they surrendered it to the allied forces.\n\nMortier's life in the post-imperial period\n\nLike almost all other marshals of Napoleon (with the exception of Davout), after the abdication of the emperor, Mortier went into the service of the Bourbons. He was appointed commander of the 16th military district (headquartered in Lille), received the peerage of France and the Order of Saint Louis.\n\nAfter the news of Napoleon's landing in the Bay of Juan and his movement to Paris, Mortier accompanied Louis XVIII to the Belgian border, then returned to Paris. During a meeting with Napoleon, he agreed to lead the units of the guards cavalry, but from the real command, and even more from participation in hostilities, he evaded, saying that he was sick.\n\nAfter the return of Louis XVIII, Mortier headed the 15th military district in Rouen, was a deputy in the House of Representatives, and in 1819 became a member of the House of Peers. But his main occupation until 1830 was housekeeping on his estate.\n\nF.S. Delpek. Portrait of Marshal Maurier, before 1825\n\nAfter the July Revolution, it became clear that the new King Louis Philippe treasures the talents of this Napoleonic Marshal. First, he sent Mortier to Petersburg to explain to Nicholas I that nothing threatened the old world order from France.\n\nIn 1831, the king appointed Mortier Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honor. In 1834, Mortier worked in the government, holding the posts of prime minister and minister of war.\n\nThe life of this marshal was cut short on July 28, 1835 during a parade dedicated to the anniversary of the July Revolution and the accession of the new dynasty of Orleans. In fact, the target of the terrorists from the group of the Corsican Giuseppe Fieschi was the king and his sons. The \"infernal machine\" that awaited them on Temple Boulevard was very intricate and ingenious: the conspirators secured in a common frame several dozen guns loaded with buckshot.\n\nGuillaume François Gabriel Lepaulle. L'attentat de Fieschi boulevard du Temple 28 juillet 1835\n\nAs a result, neither the king nor the princes were injured, but 12 other people were killed on the spot, another 22 were injured, and five later died. Among them was Marshal Mortier, whose body was buried in the Les Invalides, and his heart in the Pere Lachaise cemetery.\n\nRyzhov V.A.\n\nOur news channels\n\nSubscribe and stay up to date with the latest news and the most important events of the day.\n\n112 comments\n\n\"Right Sector\" (banned in Russia), \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\" (UPA) (banned in Russia), ISIS (banned in Russia), \"Jabhat Fatah al-Sham\" formerly \"Jabhat al-Nusra\" (banned in Russia) , Taliban (banned in Russia), Al-Qaeda (banned in Russia), Anti-Corruption Foundation (banned in Russia), Navalny Headquarters (banned in Russia), Facebook (banned in Russia), Instagram (banned in Russia), Meta (banned in Russia), Misanthropic Division (banned in Russia), Azov (banned in Russia), Muslim Brotherhood (banned in Russia), Aum Shinrikyo (banned in Russia), AUE (banned in Russia), UNA-UNSO (banned in Russia), Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people (banned in Russia), Legion “Freedom of Russia” (armed formation, recognized as terrorist in the Russian Federation and banned), Kirill Budanov (included on the Rosfinmonitoring list of terrorists and extremists), the International LGBT public movement and its structural divisions are recognized as extremist (decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated November 30.11.2023, XNUMX)\n\n“Non-profit organizations, unregistered public associations or individuals performing the functions of a foreign agent,” as well as media outlets performing the functions of a foreign agent: “Medusa”; \"Voice of America\"; \"Realities\"; \"Present time\"; \"Radio Freedom\"; Ponomarev Lev; Ponomarev Ilya; Savitskaya; Markelov; Kamalyagin; Apakhonchich; Makarevich; Dud; Gordon; Zhdanov; Medvedev; Fedorov; Mikhail Kasyanov; Dmitry Muratov; \"Owl\"; \"Alliance of Doctors\"; \"RKK\" \"Levada Center\"; \"Memorial\"; \"Voice\"; \"Person and law\"; \"Rain\"; \"Mediazone\"; \"Deutsche Welle\"; QMS \"Caucasian Knot\"; \"Insider\"; \"New Newspaper\""
