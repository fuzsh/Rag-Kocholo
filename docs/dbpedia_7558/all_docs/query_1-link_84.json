        "text": "The orders of battle were originally based on Smith (1998) – which I read first – and then the more detailed orders of battle in the specialist Albuera books by Oliver and Partridge (2007) and Dempsey (2008).\n\nFrench\n\nSoult’s V Corps had about 19,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, 1,200 artillerymen and over 40 guns.\n\nMy two main sources, Oliver and Partridge (2007) and Dempsey (2008), disagree on the French order of battle in several places. Particularly in the commanders and composition of the infantry divisions and brigades. This is exactly the area where Oliver and Partridge admit a gap in their knowledge so I have followed Demsey. I have also used Demsey for the battalions present within a regiment. Demsey also allocates artillery companies to each division whereas Oliver and Partridge just have a combined (and different) artillery pool.\n\nNotes:\n\n(1) Division General Gazan was normally the commander of Second Division within V Corps and Oliver and Partridge (2007) have him as the commander at Albuera. However Gazan had been operating at Soult’s Chief of Staff since Feb 1811 so the commander of First Brigade, Brigade General Pepin, actually commanded Second division at Albuera. [See Note 2 as it is possible that Pepin replace Latour-Maubourg as commander of Second Division when Mortier returned to France.]\n\n(2) In prior campaigning Marshal Edouard Mortier commanded V Corps, for example against La Romana in Extremadura in 1810 (Dempsey, 2008). Mortier was recalled to Paris at the end of March 1811 leaving Division General Latour-Maubourg in command of V Corps. Upon leaving Seville on 9 May 1811 Soult transferred Latour-Maubourg to command the cavalry. Division General Jean-Baptiste Girard, Division General of First Division, became temporary commander of V Corps.\n\nI’ve summarised the various re-assignments covered by notes 1 and 2 in the table below:\n\nOfficer Late 1810 Feb 1811 End Mar 1811 9 May 1811 Albuera\n\n16 May 1811 Mortier V Corps – Gazan 2nd Div Chief of Staff Latour-Maubourg ? 2nd Div V Corps Cavalry Reserve in V Corps Girard 1st Div V Corps plus 1st Div Pepin 1st Brigade in 2nd Div 2nd Div plus 1st Brigade\n\n(3) The 55th Line were either with Werle’s First Independent Brigade or Godinot’s Second Independent Brigade (Dempsey, 2008).\n\nIn support of the 55th being with Werle (Dempsey, 2008):\n\nSoult’s Unpublished report that states that the regiment reinforced Brigade Werle for the flank attack.\n\nThe British Fusilier Brigade saw three regimental columns within Werle’s brigade.\n\nOn page 191 Dempsey mentions officer casualties in the 55th when under attack from the British Fusilier Brigade.\n\nThe losses suffered by the 55th (19%) suggest heavy action. In comparison the regiments in Werle’s suffered 20% (58th Line) and 36% (12th Light). Godonot’s suffered <1% (51st) and 23% (16th Light).\n\nBut there is contradictory evidence:\n\nThe regimental history of the 55th states the unit served with Godinot not Werle\n\nThe regimental history of the 12th Light, in Werle’s brigade, makes it clear that the only other regiment in the brigade was the 58th.\n\nOn balance I thought the 55th fought with Werle. Werle’s brigade would have been very small without the 55th. The contrary evidence can be explained by the prefix “in general”, i.e. in general the 55th served with Godinot and in general the 12th and 58th were the only regiments in Werle’s brigade. These statements might not be true for Albuera.\n\n(4) Mostly Dempsey (2008) and Oliver and Partridge (2007) agree on the number of men. However Dempsey (2008) gives the 51st Line Regiment one battalion (2nd) and only 751 men. Oliver and Partridge (2007) gives all three battalions and 2,251 men. The Oliver and Partridge’s numbers presumably come from Oman. In contrast Dempsey cites Soult’s Unpublished Report and the 51st’s Regimental History for the presence of the single battalion; he proratas the number of men.\n\n(5) Dempsey (2008) has the Combined Grenadiers attached to Brigade Godinot. The Combined Grenadiers are not attached to a brigade in Oliver and Partridge (2007) although they are listed under the Independent Brigades. They were certainly part of the flank attack so, if ever attached to Godinot, were reassigned.\n\n(6) I’ve listed the order of battle given by Dempsey (2008) but in practice the Light Cavalry were organised differently on the day. The French attack on the village started with a cavalry force. Brigade Briche had the 21e and 27e Chasseurs a Cheval but not the 2nd and 10th Hussars. the 1e Lancers and 4e Dragoons accompanied the brigade as independent regiments.\n\nOnce the French flank march was obvious Soult redirected the majority of his horse to support it. Briche had the 21e and 27e Chasseurs a Cheval. The 2nd and 10th Hussars accompanied the 1e Vistula Lancers on the flank march. The 4e Spanish Chasseurs may have accompanied the lancers as well; this might partially explain why Spanish troops identified other Spaniards charging with the lancers.\n\n(7) I’ve followed Dempsey (2008) on the order of battle for the artillery. But it totals a lot more companies than Oliver and Partridge (2007) list. Oliver and Partridge only list a general pool of artillery with relatively few companies and different units to those listed by Dempsey at that. Here is what Oliver and Partridge (2007) list:\n\nDempsey (2008) explains that the 10 artillery companies had very few guns. The nine companies of V Corps and the artillery reserve shared only 29 guns including two 12-pounders, nine 8-pounders , five 4-pounders, seven 6″ howitzers, and six 4 1/2″ howitzers. The 4 1/2″ howitzers might have been ‘Spanish’ howitzers transported by pack mule. The 10th company, a horse artillery company attached to Brigade Briche, had its full complement of weapons, i.e. 4 guns and 2 howitzers. That makes 35 guns in total.\n\nAnglo-Portuguese\n\nThe allies had British, Portuguese and Spanish troops at Albuera. The British and Portuguese were brigaded together but the Spanish were deployed separately.\n\nSpanish\n\nSee also Spanish Units at Albuera for more detail.\n\nNotes:\n\n(1) Oliver and Partridge (2007) give “Rgto Veteranos de la Patria” in the Orbat of Zayas’s division at Albuera. The trouble is according the handbook of the same authors the (Oliver & Partridge, 1999) the “Rto Veteranos de la Patria” was raised 10 Aug 1813 and was absorbed by Rto de Ceuta on 2 Mar 1815. This is problematic because Albuera was in 1811. I think this is a typo because the the handbook lists the “Vol. de la Patria” as fighting at Albuera.\n\n(2) All of the Allied cavalry, including both Spanish cavalry brigades, were commanded by Lumley during the battle.\n\n(3) Both Brigadier Carlos de Espana and Brigadier Conde [Count] Louis de Penne-Villemur were Frenchmen.\n\nReferences\n\nChartrand, R.
