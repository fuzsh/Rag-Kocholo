        "text": "Born in Rathcoffey, County Kildare, in 1776, Hugh Ware was a land surveyor by profession, his work bringing him into contact with some of the radicals of North Kildare, including landowners such as Archibald Hamilton Rowan of Rathcoffey Castle, and artisans such as Michael Quigley. He was a leading member of the Society of United Irishmen in the barony and deputy commander of the north Kildare rebel army in 1798. Among other leaders, military and civilian, his surrender was demanded by the government, and, after a successful military campaign, he surrendered alongside William Aylmer. Imprisoned for four years, he was exiled in France in 1802, and joined the Irish Legion, in which he led a very successful military career, becoming the regiment's last commander in 1815. Ware was an exceptional individual who won the admiration of the Kildare rebels, the officers and soldiers of the Irish Legion, the French military hierarchy and even Napoleon. As the final commander, his even handedness was remarkable, and it was probably due to him that the unit stayed out of the conflict during the 100 Days. However, he was a Bonapartist at heart, and was never recalled to the army after the Second Restoration. His colonelcy, stripped from him by the Bourbons, was restored by Louis Phiippe in 1832. An officer of outstanding courage, he led the regiment in two assaults on the Heights of Wolfsberg in 1813, was wounded several times during the campaign, and had three horses killed under him. Having saved the Imperial Eagle in the Bober disaster, he led the debris of the regiment the 900 km back to its base. La Légion Irlandaise: Napoleon’s declaration that La Légion Irlandaise caused him more trouble than all his other regiments put together is not difficult to understand. Initial tension between officers brought many duels: Irish against Irish; Irish against French, Irish against Breton. In addition, the Irish officers refused to accept non-Irish officers, even though these were essential, and refused to cooperate with a non-Irish commander. The unit was formed in 1803 by Napoleon in response to pressure from Irish republicans for intervention in their struggle for independence from Great Britain. Early officers consisted mainly of former rebels and political dissidents, members of the Society of United Irishmen, mainly Catholic, though several were Anglican or Presbyterian. These men were not ‘the last of the Wild Geese’ as asserted by several Irish historians. The so-called ‘Wild Geese’ were legitimists and supporters of the Jacobite cause, diametrically opposed to the republicans. Native Irish officers accounted for 85 out of a total of over 300 who passed through the Legion throughout its life, but the Irish were by far the longest serving and maintained the corps’ Irish ethos. Campaigns included (1) Flushing in 1809, where the 1st Battalion went into captivity. (2) The Peninsular War of 1808-14, from which the 2nd Battalion, depleted by combat, hardship and desertion, was withdrawn in late 1811. (3) The Saxon Campaign of 1813 during which the new 1st and 2nd Battalions were annihilated in the flooded Bober River. In September 1815, The Irish Legion, by then le 7ème Régiment Étranger (irlandais), was disbanded by the restored Bourbons because of alleged Bonapartism. Only 20 of the officers remaining were Irish born, and less than 10% of the troops. The demise of the Legion also saw the end of Irish recruitment into the French army, the British army gaining vast numbers of Irish recruits.
