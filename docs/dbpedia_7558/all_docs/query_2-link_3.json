        "text": "Eylau: Precis Des Travaux de la Grande Armée\n\nProclamation of Marshal Mortier to the People of Hesse-Cassel: 31 October 1806\n\nHere then is the proclamation which was made by Marshal Mortier.\n\nProclamation of October 31.\n\n“Edouard Mortier, marshal of the Empire, etc.\n\n“Habitants of Hesse, I come to take possession of your country; it is the only means of avoiding you from the horrors of the war. You were led into violation of your territory by the Prussian troops; you were scandalized by the reception that was made for them by the hereditary prince. Moreover, your sovereign and his son having guards within the service of Prussia are held by obedience to the orders of the commander, head of the Prussian army. The quality of a sovereign is incompatible with that of an officer in service of another power, and dependent upon foreign courts.\n\n“Your religion, your laws, your manners, your privileges will be respected; discipline will be maintained: on your side be quiet. Have confidence in the grand Sovereign on which yours is forced to leave; you will only be able then to experience improvement.”\n\nSigned, ED. MORTIER.\n\n[ Military Index | Battles Index | More on “Precis Des Travaux de la Grande Armee” ]\n\n© Copyright 1995-2012, The Napoleon Series, All Rights Reserved."
