        "text": "Mortier is the only marshal appointed by Napoleon who has died a violent death since Brune, Murat and Ney. Unlike many others, he wasn't put off by politics and Parliament. [..] The Restoration offered him no ministry, which he never requested, for that matter, as he had no taste for power. [..] It was only in November 1834 that he was pressed to accept the War portfolio and the presidency of the Council to end a long ministerial crisis. This task was beyond his strength, he realized; his consent was a real sacrifice, made even more painful by the opposition of part of the press. [..] We quote from him a proud response to a colonel in no hurry to fight who begged him not to send him to serve in Algeria. It was at the Ministry of War, during an official evening. Mortier, leaning on a fireplace, listened to the solicitor who spoke of the health of his wife and the education of his children, then suddenly, looking at him from his gigantic height, he let this lesson fall aloud: \"Ah, f ...! Sir, in our time, when a cannon was fired in any corner of Europe, it was to whom of us asked the honor of marching. \" His stint in office was very short: on March 12, 1835, he left the presidency and ministry.\n\nIn July of the same year, Marshal Mortier fell victim to Fieschi's infernal machine directed against Louis-Philippe, whom he accompanied in the review passed on the occasion of the anniversary of the Trois-Glorieuses. The day before, reports of an attack had circulated in Paris, and the family of the Duke of Trevise had wanted to dissuade him from attending the ceremony. \"No, no, I will go,\" he replied, \"I am tall, maybe I'll cover the king. \" The danger did not frighten him, but the heatwave bothered him. As the procession emerged on the Boulevard du Temple, he complained of fatigue and his aides-de-camp took the opportunity to urge him to retire. Like an old soldier little used to giving in to physical ailments, he stiffened and protested: \"My place is with the king, among the marshals, my comrades in arms.\" Almost at the same time, he collapsed, mortally struck by the assassin's grapeshot. He died a few minutes later in the billiard room of the Turkish Garden where he had been taken. Louis-Philippe, sincerely affected by this death, had him buried in the church of Invalides with the greatest solemnity."
