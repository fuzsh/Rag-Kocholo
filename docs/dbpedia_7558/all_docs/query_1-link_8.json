        "text": "8th Corps - November, 1805\n\nThis French Army Corps was formed during the 1805 advance on Vienna and placed under the command of Marshal Edouard Mortier. Troops composing the corps were drawn from various other army formations. Dupont's division was from Ney's Sixth Corps, and had nearly been destroyed during the fighting around Ulm because of Murat's incompetence. Gazan's division was from Lannes Fifth Corps, and Klein's Dragoon division was from Murat's Reserve Cavalry Corps. After the formation of Mortier's new corps, Murat again caused near disaster, this time for Gazan's division, which was nearly destroyed by the retreating Russian Army. It is ironic that Gazan was saved from destruction by the rapid approach of fellow general Dupont, the very commander who had so nearly experienced a similar fate. This order of battle gives Eighth Corps status as of late November, 1805. Of particular value are the absent returns, which graphically indicate the condition of formations which have seen heavy fighting. Note that men lost as prisoners are still listed in the regiments.\n\n¹ H = In the hospital, P = Taken prisoner, A = Under arrest.
