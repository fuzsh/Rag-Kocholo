In his manifesto on 17 Mar 1917 he deferred to the will of the people and acknowledged the Provisional Government, but neither abdicated nor refused to accept the throne. On 13 Jun 1918, Mikhail was murdered in Perm.\n\n4During the period 1722-1802 there were essentially two chief state civil officers, the Chancellor having rank of the first civil officer and dealing with foreign affairs, and the Procurator-General ranking below and dealing with justice and having general oversight of other interior affairs. Several times during this period a collective body resembling cabinet of ministers was created (the Supreme Privy Council 1726-1730, Cabinet of Ministers 1731-1741, Conference of Ministers 1756-1762, Council at the Highest Court 1761-1801, Permanent Council 1801-1802), but only twice (1731-1741, 1801-1802) there was a position of the chief minister. Neither the chief minister, nor the chief state civil officers were heads of government, the Emperor headed the government.\n\nNoble and Ecclesiastical Titles: Baron = Baron; Graf = Count; Knyaz'/Knyaginya = Prince/Princess; Patriarkh = Patriarch; Velikiy/Velikaya Knyaz'/Knyaginya/Knyazhna = Grand Prince/Princess; Tsarevna = Daughter of a Tsar; Tsaritsa = Wife of a Tsar.\n\nParty abbreviations:GPr = Gruppa Pravykh (Group of Right-wing, parliamentary group, 1906-1917);KDP =Konstitutsionno-Demokraticheskaya Partiya (Constitutional Democratic Party, \"Kadets\", Russian liberal, 12 Oct 1905-1920, banned by Bolsheviks from 12 Dec 1917); Okt = Soyuz 17 Oktyabrya (Union of October 17, \"Octobrists\", conservative, moderate constitutionalist, Nov 1905-1918); PSR = Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov (Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, \"SRs\", democratic socialist, agrarian socialist, split Aug 1917 into Left [became PLSR] and Right wings, 1902-1922); RKP =Rossiyskaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya (Bol'shevikov)(Russian Communist Party [Bolsheviks], Marxist-Leninist communist, state party, former RSDRP-B, 8 Mar 1918 - 31 Dec 1925, renamed Vsesoyuznaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya (Bol'shevikov)[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]); RS = Russkoye Sobraniye (Russian Assembly, monarchist, Russian nationalist, 1906-1917); RSDRP-B = Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Rabochaya Partiya (Bol'shevikov)(Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party [Bolsheviks], Russian revolutionary socialist, Marxist communist, from 8 Nov 1917 state party, split from RSDRP est.1898, 1 Jan 1912-8 Mar 1918, renamed RKP); RSDRP-M = Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Rabochaya Partiya (Men'shevikov)(Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party [Mensheviks], split from RSDRP-B, democratic socialist, Orthodox Marxist, 1 Jan 1912-1922); Mil = Military\n\n1905-1906 Russian revolutionary \"republics\"\n\nNote: On some occasions the Bolshevik-led rebels succeed in taking over several large cities, they were popularly referred to as the \"republics.\" Rebel Soviets (Councils) of Workers' Deputies also attempted unsuccessful uprisings in Moscow, Rostov-na-Donu, and Perm in Dec 1905 - Jan 1906.
