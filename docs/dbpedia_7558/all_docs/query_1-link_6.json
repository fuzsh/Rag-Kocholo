        "text": "Description\n\nType: Letter\n\nDescription: (1768-1835) French military commander, Marshal of the Empire under Napoleon, served during both the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He was one of 18 people killed in 1835 during an assassination attempt on King Louis Philippe I.\n\nMortier entered the army as a sub-lieutenant in 1791, served in the French Revolutionary wars in the 1792 & 1793 campaigns on the NE frontier and in the Netherlands, subsequently on the Meuse and the Rhine. Mortier was tasked by General Hatry to negotiate the surrender of the Fortress of Mainz which he completed successfully then returned to Paris. During the 1799 War of the 2nd Coalition, he was promoted to brigadier general then general of division. During the 2nd Battle of Zurich, he led 8,000 men in the attack from Dieticon. His conduct of the French occupation of Hanover, bringing about the Convention of Artlenburg, led Napoleon to include Mortier in the 1st list of marshals created in 1804.\n\nHe commanded a Grand Army corps in the Ulm campaign and distinguished himself. In the campaign of the middle Danube, ending in the Battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon placed him in command of the new VII Corps, composed of divisions from other corps. Mortier over-extended his line of march on the north shore of the Danube and failed to heed Napoleon’s advice to protect his north flank. A combined Russo-Austrian force, under General Kutuzov enticed him to send General Gazan’s 2nd Division into a trap and they were caught in a valley between two Russian columns, rescued by the timely arrival of General Pierre Dupont de l’Étang’s 1st Division. The Nov. 11, 1805 Battle of Durrenstein extended well into the night, both sides claiming victory, the French losing over 1/3 of participants, Gazan’s division experiencing 40+ % losses, the Austrians and Russians also suffered close to 16% losses. After Austerlitz, Napoleon dispersed the corps, Gazan received the Legion of Honor, Mortier simply reassigned.\n\nWhen the War of the 4th Coalition broke out in 1806, Napoleon ordered Mortier to command the reformed VIII Corps on 1 October, to coordinate his operations with Louis Bonaparte’s Franco-Dutch troops. On 16 October, 2 days after his victory over Prussia at Jena-Auerstadt, Napoleon ordered Mortier and Louis to conquer the Electorate of Hesse. Mortier was to occupy Fulda then the capital city of Kassel, rule as military governor, and imprison William I, Elector of Hesse. Every Hessian officer above the rank of lieutenant would be arrested and Napoleon stated his intention to “wipe the house of Hesse-Kassel from the map”. Mortier knew this would violate Hessian neutrality and boasted on 17 October that its neutrality made it easy to conquer. On 1 November, the French occupied and looted Kassel, and William I fled. Mortier proclaimed to have come to avenge Prussian violation of Hessian neutrality but also accused them of being Prussian allies. He left a division to hold Hesse-Kassel while the rest of his corps was engaged in mopping-up operations in Prussia. Hamelin capitulated on 22 November with a garrison of 10,000 Prussian troops, Nienburg fell 29 November with 2,911 Prussians captured. In 1807, he served in the Friedland campaign, the siege of Straslund, and the siege of Kolberg. In 1808, Napoleon made Mortier Duke of Treviso (Duc de Trevise, a rare but nominal, hereditary honor, extinguished in 1946) in his own Kingdom of Italy, and shortly after he led an army corps in Napoleon’s campaign to recapture Madrid.\n\nMortier remained in Spain for 2 campaigns, winning at Ocana November 1809. In 1812 & 1813 he led the Imperial Guard and in the 1814 defensive campaign, rendering brilliant service commanding rearguards and covering detachments. In 1815, after Louis XVIII’s flight, he rejoined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, commanding the Imperial Guard again, but at the opening of the Battle of Waterloo was unable to continue due to severe sciatica.\n\nAfter the 2nd Bourbon Restoration, Mortier was for a time in disgrace, but in 1819 was readmitted to the Chamber of Peers and in 1825 received the Order of the Holy Spirit, the kingdom’s highest honor. Ambassador to Russia 1834-35 then Minister of War and President of the Council of Ministers. On 28 July 1835, Mortier accompanied King Louis-Philippe to a review of the Paris National Guard that commemorated the July Revolution that brought the king to power in 1830. In the Boulevard du Temple, the royal party was hit by a volley of gunfire from the upstairs window of a house, 18 killed, incl. Mortier, 22 injured, the king received only a minor wound. The assassin was quickly captured, tried with 2 co-conspirators, the 3 guillotined February 1836.\n\n13 ½ x 9 LS “Le Mal Duc de Trevise”, Lille, July 26 1814, during the Defensive Campaign, to Count Dupont, Minister of War, pleading the case of a badly wounded soldier to be allowed free care at a health “spa”: “Monsieur Count, I join in the attestation of the health officers that 2nd Lieutenant Basieux of the 6th Young Guards of the Flanquers Grenadiers go to the mud baths at St. Amand. This soldier that I have seen is in the most grievous state because of a wound he received at the Battle of Craonne. His modest circumstances do not permit him the care given at St. Amand each time he would go there and I pray Your Excellency will be willing to send the proper authorization to give free care there for this wounded soldier. I have the honor to repeat to Your Excellency the assurance of my high esteem [signed] The Marshal Duc de Trevise”. A handwritten docket in unknown hand at left side relates to The Duke’s request.\n\nPierre-Antoine, Count Dupont de l’Étang (1765-1840) French general in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, Bourbon Restoration politician.\n\nOn active service in the French Revolutionary Wars in The Netherlands, in 1791 on the staff of General Dillon’s Army of the North. He distinguished himself at Valmy and around Menen in the 1793 campaign, forced an Austrian regiment to surrender. Promoted to brigadier general, received further advancement from Carnot and in 1797 became division general. His support for Bonaparte in the 18 Brumaire coup led to opportunities under the Consulate and the Empire. In the campaign of 1800, he was chief of staff to General Berthier, nominal commander of the Army of Peierve des Ains which won the Battle of Marengo. He also succeeded against greatly superior forces at Pozzolo.\n\nIn the 1805 Danube campaign, he was praised for his command of one of Ney’s divisions, especially in the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen (Albeck), preventing the escape of Austrians from Ulm, effectively contributing to the capture of Karl Mack von Lieberich and his army. He was also distinguished at Friedland.\n\nHe entered Spain 1808 with provisional battalions and Swiss troops impressed into French service from the Spanish Royal Army. After Madrid’s occupation, Dupont, newly created Count by Napoleon, went to subdue Andalusia. His corps was defeated at Bailen after his Swiss troops deserted and turned against him. Painfully wounded, Dupont thought to capitulate but sent secret orders to General Vedel to escape with his division, outside the Spanish trap. When the Spanish found out, they threatened to massacre Dupont’s men if Vedel did not also surrender, which Vedel did; 17,600 French soldiers capitulated. Madrid fell which compelled Napoleon to intervene with his Grand Army. Dupont fell into the Emperor’s disgrace, was court-martialed, deprived of his rank and title, jailed 1812-14. Released by the initial Restoration, Louis XVIII gave him a military command, which he lost on Napoleon’s return during the Hundred Days. The 2nd Restoration saw him reinstated to the army and appointed to the Royal Privy Council. Minister of War April-December 1814, recalled by the King for reactionary politics. Deputy for Charente 1815-30.\n\nSaint-Amand-les-Eaux in northern France on the Scarpe River, was named for the founder of a Benedictine abbey in the area in 647; the 2nd part of the name reflects the mineral waters and mud baths for which the town is still known.\n\nThe Battle of Craonne (7 March 1814) was between Napoleon’s army and a combined army of Russian and Prussian soldiers led by Field Marshal von Blucher. The War of the 6th Coalition battle began when the bulk of Napoleon’s army tried to drive Vorontsov’s 22,000 Russians off the plateau west of Craonne (56 miles NE of Paris). Napoleon’s attacks forced Vorontsov’s force to withdraw, but French casualties exceeded Russian losses. While the battle raged, Blücher’s attempt to turn Napoleon’s east flank ended in failure due to poor planning."
