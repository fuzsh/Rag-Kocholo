        "text": "hi,\n\nSomewhere else I raised issues about specific officers seeking assistance for modelling the correct men and uniforms of various staff and ADC’s. This is because I’m modelling all my commands at 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn the case of ‘la Garde Imperiale’ it is not always clear where officers came from. One such was a very lightly documented Capitaine who was attached as ADC, though called an Orderly, to Mareschal Bessiéres. This is Capitaine Desmichels. As my records grew I wasn’t always diligent in recording where information was sourced. I had a name, but no reference to a regiment.\n\nI asked and got a rather negative response that he couldn’t be found- Desmichel or Desmichels wasn’t clear. That set me on a search of my own books and articles and eventually I found the ultimate source [fingers crossed], in of all places Lachouques :Anatomy of Glory. There are 5 separate pages referencing him. A very young man of the Chasseurs á Cheval velites he was I think awarded both promotion to Capitaine and Officer LoH after Ulm; having led his squadron in the defeat and capture of over 1000 Austrian troops and many guns. This must have been the period when the regiment was in Napoleons bad books because they turfed some other troops out of bivouacs.\n\nWikipedia provided more background on this: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Alexis_Desmichels and his later history in North Africa.\n\nAnother source was the 1806 Almanach where his rank and award are listed.\n\nI suspect the translation that gave us “an Orderly” was in fact a mistranslation for a much more commonly used title, Officier d’ Ordanance- effectively a seconded resource attached to various personages for the transmission of reports, communications and ‘the post’. [Davout mentioned sending four such men, all dragoons, to the Major-General Berthiers’, General Staff for such reasons].\n\nSo here I have a Chasseur officer to use as ADC with the Marshal. Whilst it may have been obvious, it’s nice to know who was and was not and where they were from.\n\nBessiéres was Colonel-General of the Guard cavalry corps, and as such I was sure he’d have a mixture of men drawn from all his regiments despite his honouring the memory of the old ‘Guides of Italy’ by wearing the undress/ second dress uniform of the Chasseurs.\n\nI’ll add a pic of several models in due course. Another ADC officer is that on duty the day of Austerlitz- Major/ Chef d’ Escadron César de Laville, an officer from the old Piedmontaise Army [1st Chasseurs] of 1800 and attached to Bessiéres from near that date.\n\nIn this case he was not an officer of any guard regiment and so I have created a suitable figure in a plain Guard Staff Officers surtout. He was awarded Chevalier LoH only in April 1805.\n\nTrust this is of at least a little interest to others,\n\nregards\n\ndavew\n\nMy Work in progress drafts-\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\nTo continue, in my search for ‘uniqueness’ of personality figures for commands, the figure chosen for Capt. de Laville is a Minifigs BNC 28 Major General.\n\nHe came suitably composed in coat with aiguilette to which I added in Milliput©, an epaulette on his left shoulder and a lead ‘medium’ plume on his chapeau, stolen from an infantry fusilier figure.\n\nThe latter (plume), I tend these days to drill out and use a stainless steel dressmakers pin to create an approx. 2+mm spigot into the chapeau at whatever rake I feel looks effective. The location and ‘delicacy’ of these items in earlier work sometimes came a cropper when ‘in action’ [gaming], so I secure these now in first build of my characters.\n\nThe generals lace on his chest is merely filled with several layers of paint and is sufficient I feel to give an impression of cloth, but not obvious detail. I realise this is heresy to some, demeaning a Brit general and all…\n\nMost often my ADCs have been constructed using the quite plain and adaptable Austrian generals and ADCs of the range to reasonable effect! IMHO of course.\n\nAs an exanple, here’s my veteran GDV Legrand [commander of Soults 3rd Division] and his three ADCs- two normal Minfigs French in full dress uniforms; and a plainer one made from an Austrian figure with plain unlaced schabraque, making him Legrands son.\n\ncheers\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\nWas he ‘mort au combat‘? He could have fallen off a pontoon and drowned.\n\nThanks, I apprecite the honest intent. However I’m sure we all know that there were no bateaux, nor even navigable waterways “pres d’Austerlitz”. It was a deep bank streamed, boggy swamp edged, settlement ponds terrain, at least partly frozen over along the Goldbach and Littawa.\n\nSo the question remains, unanswered. As to N-S accuracy, it is not! With all due respect to Tony Broughton, he doesn’t even get the facts right from the start.\n\n>> 30 fructidor an XI (17 Sept. 1803), est créé le Bataillon des Matelots de la Garde Consulaire, constitué de 5 équipages, totalisant 337 hommes, officiers et trompettes compris.<<\n\nNot formed in 1804. That and the similar train of articles are useful I agree, but compound the errors left unedited/ uncorrected on-line is a grievance; and the limited names given.\n\n“He is indeed in the ‘Tableaux, par corps et par batailles…”\n\nand for which I thank you Guy. I tend to jump straight to pdfs looking for such things- yet I did not have these in my collection!- and a hard copy is in my library! I had the ‘supplément’ published 1909 though. Seems Volume Two isn’t available in pdf via Gallica?\n\nMy notes and sadly I had failed to record the source of their history cites:\n\n-20 juillet 1805 réduction à 818 hommes.\n\n-15 septembre 1805, 120 hommes partent de boulogne pour rejoindre l’Armée d’Allemagne.\n\nSo roughly an ‘équipage’ as formed- constitué de 5 équipages.\n\nI am considering, though not listed that I can see, that he may have been in attendance as an aide or officier hors-suite to the Garde or E-M-Generale. Perhaps even a Generals temporary ADC.\n\nPity the poor man getting killed so far inland, and not even commanding his own troops!\n\nhttps://tablasmartinien.es/ might be useful otherwise (ie Spain), but man a tangled web of links and tables just overwhelms me there! Meaning I can’t find a thing… sometimes you just want to trace someone thoroughly across their active service.\n\nMany thanks for the input, regards dave\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\n*sigh*, no good deed goes unpunished.\n\nThanks, I apprecite the honest intent. However I’m sure we all know that there were no bateaux, nor even navigable waterways “pres d’Austerlitz”. It was a deep bank streamed, boggy swamp edged, settlement ponds terrain, at least partly frozen over along the Goldbach and Littawa.\n\nOff the cuff remark I could have written ‘died falling off a wagon’, but I didn’t. There’s this thing called ‘humour’…\n\nSo the question remains, unanswered. As to N-S accuracy, it is not! With all due respect to Tony Broughton, he doesn’t even get the facts right from the start.\n\nI made no claims for the accuracy of Napoleon Series and/or Tony Broughton. An idle Googling threw that page up. I did say that the bibliography in the article might give better results, as Guy proved when he found one of the books mentioned and posted the information therein above.\n\nWe are not professional military historians. Many of us are not even dilettante military historians. Most of us, I suggest, are not much interested in the fates of junior officers 0f the Marins de la Garde, but in the spirit of co-operation, we throw out what snippets of information we can glean. Well I’ve learned that lesson, I shall contribute no more to your posts. I would hate to offend you further with my unprofessionalism in the field of obscure military history ‘research’.\n\nI will offer a final piece of advice;\n\nLighten up. You’ll get far more out of TWW if you don’t approach every well meant offer of help with the graceless and dismissive questioning attitude of an Oxbridge professor to the offerings of a first year student. You are not an Oxbridge professor, and I graduated a long, long time ago.\n\nObvious contrarian and passive aggressive old prat, who is taken far too seriously by some and not seriously enough by others.\n\nI didn’t know there was a volume 2 of ‘Tableaux’.\n\nThere is the 1909 Supplement which is on BnF Gallica and which Hachette slightly misleadingly published under the full title of the Tableaux some years ago (but is only 196pp vice the 826pp of the 1899 work).\n\nI understand the propensity to get drawn into side alleys – see my rambling about cleaning mail elsewhere. Not sure how much you are going to find out about Lt Jacquelot.\n\nThe Spanish interactive Martinien doesn’t appear to work for me – I can read the introduction, the objectives and results but the Mapa tab itself leads me to a page where none of the click links work. So not much help for me. The info seems to be a reordering of Martinien’s tableaux for locations in Spain which is interesting but I’m not sure how much help it’s going to be for getting more info into the activities and careers of officers. It may do depending what it links through to but they aren’t working for me. And when I try the databases – eg the Battles, I get an undefined array key 7 error and a list of other undefined array keys instead of accessing the information itself.\n\nGood luck with your searches!\n\nI didn’t know there was a volume 2 of ‘Tableaux’.\n\nOf course you are probably right (spot on!). In my garbled mind I probably confuse/d G.Six and Martinien works and volumes and got it wrong. Although on p5 of latter, he writes:\n\nUn second volume,actuellementen préparation,comprendrales années’ 1816 à 1896. Il contiendra à peu près 25.000 noms ;…\n\nSo perhaps that led me to think of another tome. I agree the ‘Supplement’ 1909 is the only second volume related.\n\nThe Spanish interactive Martinien doesn’t appear to work for me …\n\nYes I quite agree, same [lack of] results all round Guy. Whilst its clearly a valid effort to customise the data and make it accessible, you seem to need to be a programmer of depth to achieve anything.\n\nMy attempts there, have simply been to validate information already recovered from other sources. Even a lot of French trivia falls into bland “served in despagne” type quotes without providing details of what, often, individuals did.\n\n>>Not sure how much you are going to find out about Lt Jacquelot.\n\nI’ll not pursue the matter further unless some ‘clues’ appear. I’ll look at the ‘Official History’ again as it contains many, many name references that bewildered me at first sighting. At least, it gives many instances of ‘leadership’ by junior staff ranks and quite a few of the non-combatant hangers on and foreigners present.\n\nThanks for the input_ d\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\nJean-Marie-Désiré Jacquelot (ou Jaquelot)\n\n— ~1800 aspirant de marine\n\n— IV.1803 promu enseigne de vaisseau en activité au port de Lorient\n\n— X.1803 passé enseigne de vaisseau, lieutenant de bataillon commandant du 5e escouade du 3e équipage du bataillon de matelots de la garde consulaire, à camp de Boulogne\n\n— VI.1804 fait membre de la Légion d’honneur\n\n— VIII.1804 au Havre\n\n— IX.1805 passé commandant du 4e escouade du 4e équipage\n\nIn September 1805 the 4e équipage was ordered to Strasbourg and then Donauwörth, charged with conveying supplies for the guard on the Danube. They also directed boats supplying Mortier’s corps. They did not, as a unit, approach the battle of Austerltz. While it is possible that the enseigne Jacquelot happened to be delivering a report only to be killed by a random shot, the cause or circumstances of his death were not recorded in any history of the guard that I have found. His dossier at the Légion d’honneur was closed on 1 January 1806 with the notation “presumed dead”, perhaps indicating that his body had not been found. The marins reported 5 officers present under arms in late December, vs. 6 per the establishment for 1 équipage.\n\nOn balance, I think that there might be some error in the Martinien listing.\n\nThe archives might resolve the question.\n\nArchives de personnel de la marine à Vincennes – Cote MV CC 7 ALPHA 1219 – dossier individuel de Jacquelot Jean Marie Désiré\n\nSources\n\n— Astrid Martinien – Tableaux par corps et par batailles des officiers tués et blessés\n\n— Émile Marco de Saint Hilaire – Histoire anecdotique, politique et militaire de la Garde impériale\n\n— Annuaire statistique, civil, maritime et commercial du département du Morbihan pour l’an XII\n\n— Almanach Impériale pour l’an XIII\n\n— Almanach Impériale pour l’an MDCCCVI\n\n— Eugène Lomier – Le bataillon de marins de la Garde 1803-1815\n\n— Fastes de la Légion d’honneur T. 5.\n\n— Frignet Despréaux – Le maréchal Mortier, duc de Trévise T.3\n\n— État général de la marine – an ….

Sous Lieut Dorsenne Ofc [LOH] Sous Lieut Germanouski Ofc [LOH] *(Source 1806 Almanach_dw) I found your Sous Lieut Germanouski on page 75 of the 1806 Almanach impérial : membre de la Légion d’honneur, lieutenant en 2e aide de camp près du général de division Ordener (colonel commandant du régiment de grenadiers à cheval de la garde)\n\nMon Cher M. Alexandre, I cannot express enough gratitude for the eloquent research and answers you have provided me. It is indeed a complex issue- no doubt made more difficult as I appear to have inadvertently contaminated information by copying errors- confusing these two great men (Dorsenne and Ordener) of La Garde.\n\nIt is probable that I copied information from one source, but combined them incorrectly in my document guide for La Grandé Armée 1805. I note that E. Saint Hilaire in “Histoire anecdotique, politique et militaire de la Garde impériale…” cites different officers as ADCs (1809) –\n\nCASTELLON, t aides-de-camp PAILHÈS * DORSENNE.\n\nOf course I was not trying to make the Marins de la garde ‘appear’ at Austerlitz, merely wishing, if such an individual appeared, to know the context. However, I think your assessment is correct, and “body not found” is likely to have ocaissioned with a boating or river mishap, than a stray bullet on the battlefield.\n\nI will likely still create an ‘equipage’ as technical troops, not fighting men, but for use in campaign scenarios, along with my current engineers and miners (genie), foot dragoon battalion, ingeneurs-geographic etc.\n\nMy sincere thanks once again, regards davew\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\nThe “1805” almanach was actually the An XIII almanach – the revolutionary year beginning 23 Septembre 1804. By internal evidence, I think the work was published in October 1804. The 1806 & 1807 Almanachs was indeed for the years indicated, the republican calendar having been abolished from 1 January 1806. By internal evidence, I think the work was published in February of the given year.\n\nFor Dorsenne ….\n\n● 23.V.1800 – promu chef de brigade provisoire de la 61e demi-brigade d’infanterie de ligne, confirmé le 5.VII.1802\n\n● 3.III.1805 – passé major du régiment de grenadiers à pied de la garde\n\n● 18.X.1805 – passé major-colonel de la brigade de grenadiers à pied de la garde\n\n● 25.XII.1805 – promu général de brigade\n\nAs a chef de brigade or colonel of the army Dorsenne was not entitled to any aides de camp.\n\nIn the garde, the only aides de camp authorized in 1805 were 3 aides de camp each for the four maréchaux colonels-généraux (Davout, Soult, Mortier & Bessières) per the decree of 29 July 1804. These officers seem to have been entitled to additional aides de camp (as maréchaux, as généraux de division, as commadants d’un corps d’armée, etc.) and all of these entitlements seem to have consolidated with a doubling to a total of 24 aides de camp for the colonels-généraux per decree of 15 April 1806.\n\nIt would appear that the aides de camp shown in the Almanachs An XIII, 1806 and 1807 for the generals Hulin and Dorsenne were assigned to them as generals in the army and were not officers of the garde. For Austerlitz, the général Hulin was in Vienne (with his aides de camp) and the colonel Dorsenne was not yet assigned any aides de camp. Like all colonels, he would have tapped trusted non-commissioned officers of his regiment to act as personal ordonnances.\n\nUpon being promoted to général de brigade, Dorsenne chose these aides de camp :\n\n● capitaine Jean-François Castillon (from Dorsenne’s home town) : made a membre de la Légion d’honeur on 29 May 1806, paased aide de camp to Dorsenne on 4 October 1806 and promoted a capitaine dans la garde on 16 February 1807\n\nhttps://www.leonore.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/ui/notice/69469\n\n● lieutenant Antoine Pailhès (from Dorsenne’s old unit, the 61e de ligne) : became an aide de camp to Dorsenne on 4 October 1806, promoted a lieutenant en 1er dans la garde on 14 February 1807 and made a membre de la Légion d’honneur on 8 January 1809\n\nhttp://www2.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH175/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL2035036V001.htm\n\nBefore you finish him, you might need another epaulette ….\n\nIn 1805, the géneral de division Songis was the 1er inspecteur général de l’artillerie et commandant en chef de l’artillerie de la Grande armée.

This included more and more of the ancilliary commanders that most gaming ignores.\n\n>>In 1805, the géneral de division Songis was the 1er inspecteur général de l’artillerie et commandant en chef de l’artillerie de la Grande armée. He was not a part of the garde impériale nor the maison militaire de l’Empereur.\n\nWhich I understand and knew. However on the day it appears from my resources (right or wrongly) he was placed ‘in charge’ of the massed Garde artillerie corps, thus deserving a spot in my army.\n\nTwo issues I have not resolved.\n\nI have recreated two French companies only. However I have the Italian Royal Garde Infantry regiment already, so would possibly add the Italian company as well since they were actually present.\n\nI understand they eventually wore the French blue, with Italian cocarde. Is there any conflict of information?\n\nThe citation of ‘attached line regiments’ companies to la garde artillery. I saw no reference in any ‘Returns’ in my visit to SHD/SHAT nor have units been identified. As only ‘la garde’ is most and modestly mentioned toward the end of the battle, I feel it unlikely that any such ‘attached’ were legitimate artillery companies, but possibly only personnel or maybe train to commit as reserves for injured etc. Which as we know was minimal in the event anyway.\n\nI have two* line Divisional batteries, a Corps ‘Reserve’ 12 pounder battery and now finally several horse for the various Divisions I can field.\n\n*I used to have three but one was stolen from my collection.\n\nIn case you wonder, I get satisfaction from representing units that others expect to see in a form that exceeds what mere games rules suggest. That is also why it has taken time and patience to both research and create them!\n\nGood and Safe holidays people, regards d\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\n“[Songis] was placed ‘in charge’ of the massed Garde artillerie corps”\n\nI would interested to see where that came from, as I could not find him in tactical direct command of any artillery sub-unit at Austerlitz, only all of the artillery of the whole army.\n\nThe général de brigade Antoine-Alexandre Hanicque (1748-1821) is in some sources credited as “commandant la réserve d’artillerie” or “commandant l’artillerie de grand quartier-général”. However, the first could be a mis-reporting of his post held until late September : “commandant l’artillerie de la réserve de cavalerie”. The second is most simply interpreted as commander of all the many staff artillerists at the army headquarters.\n\nThere was an artillery element in the battlefield reserve at Austerlitz : the three horse compagnies of the guards (2 French, 1 Italian), and the foot artillery of Oudinot’s division. Possibly this was Hanicque’s span of command, but one could easily doubt it.\n\nThe 3 companies of guards light (i.e. horse) artillery were under the direct command of colonel Joseph-Christophe Couin, supported by his two adjudants. The company commanders were French chefs d’escadron Louis Doguereau (“le cadet” – younger brother of Songis’ aide-de-camp), Armand Digeon (“le beau”) and Joseph Greiner. The latter, recently promoted, seems to have led the Italians – with their own commander, capitano in primo Marco Raspi being left ill in Brünn. Italian scources like to report the excellent leadership of the deputy commander of the Italian company, tenente in primo Giuseppe Fortis.\n\nThe guard train soldiers were all French (of which there were 4 companies in total) under capitaine Edme Devarenne. The Italian train company was thought to be un-needed by Napoléon in July, and they were sent into the Italian granatieri a piedi. They were reformed in Italy.\n\nThere are reported two versions of the materiel for the guards artillery : each had either 2 **or** 4 8-lber cannons, 2 4-lber cannons and 2 6-inch howitzers, all of the Gribeauval designs – total 18 or 24 pieces for the three companies. The organization of 2+2+2 pieces had been ordered by Napoléon in July. But several (line) division’s artillery had been augmented with 2 “extra” 8-lbers by the time of the battle.\n\nOudinot’s division seems to have had 8 pieces during the battle, under the command of chef d’escadron Basile de Baltus de Pouilly (dit “Balthus”) :\n\n— 1ere compagnie du 1er régiment d’artillerie à pied : 4 8-lber cannons and 2 4-lber cannons\n\n— détachement de la 5e compagnie du 5e régiment d’artillerie à pied : 2 8-lber cannons (a typical “augmentation”)\n\nFor what it’s worth, Jean-Baptiste Barrès, then a young vélite in the chasseurs à pied, recalled in his memoirs seeing 24 pieces advancing in the intervals between battalions with the guards and Oudinot’s division toward the end of the battle.\n\nFor completeness, in the grand parc de l’armée, not on the battlefield as far as I know, there were 12 12-lber cannons and 6 Austrian 3-lber cannon assigned to the 16e, 17e & 18e compagnies du 7e régiment d’artillerie à pied.\n\n===============\n\nHere is the uniform for the Italian guard artillerists as ordered in 1803 :\n\nhttps://histunif.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1803_gde07.jpg\n\nBy mid-1806 the regulation was, as you noted, essentially the same as the French guard artillerists :\n\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/bc/3f/afbc3ffb17e3eb04cbcfcea8a6be13dd.gif\n\nBoisselier offers this for 1805-1806, said to be from a watercolor of the era :\n\nhttp://grenadier.us/h.jpg\n\nSuper painting and a great model/scene ! Here is the 38-year old chef d’escadron Joseph-Christophe Couin…\n\nYour miniature looks much like him.\n\nThe company officers of the French guard artillery at Austerlitz were a chef d’ecadron commanding each company (Doguereau & Digeon)… à la suite (Greiner) was assigned to them.\n\nThank you Sir but you are too kind! My man was painted 20 years ago and only recently ‘promoted’ (I believe his sabretache still awaits ‘correction’ but you can’t see this).\n\nYes I created for some time a more ‘vignette’ style of commands and avoided the bright grassy green textures so beloved of Summertime and Spring displays. Ulm/ Austerlitz after all was a Fall/Winter campaign. I used to get quite a ribbing about the scenic ‘extras’ that adorn my troops as well!\n\nI’ve stopped my garde artillery at 1 Escadron, 1 [Capt Digeon] and 3e [Greiner] companies. I’m surprised that Greiner was in charge of the Italian company!\n\nBut I believe I followed Anatomy of Glory for the commanders, not that either is represented by models, except by name on their unit labels.\n\nAlthough I know of Doguereau, I understood he was placed elsewhere? Quelle surpris!\n\nregards and Happy New Year to us ALL!\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\nLouis Charles Barthélémy Sopransi (1783-1814)\n\nJust an aside, and not in my timeline at all, but as I just recalled to someone else, so many interesting characters to be found.\n\nAnother Northern Italian, from Tuscany as we would say: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Charles_Barth%C3%A9l%C3%A9my_Sopransi .\n\nhad a metoric rise in the cavalry and staff. From ‘volunteer’ in 1798 to promoted in the field Sous-Lt at Marengo, thence Austerlitz with the 1er Dragons where he probably was part of the mopping up.\n\nThe First were detached to Davouts III Corps and intially at least were solely supporting Heudelets meagre ‘brigade’ presence at Tellnitz.\n\nFollowing the 1806-07 campaigns he joined Berthiers Etat-Major-Generale (probably for obvious reasons…) and within 10 years (1813) was promoted Gen de Brigade just before being wounded the last day of Leipzig.\n\nHe had served time in every corps of cavalry to that date.

Talleyrand’s illegitimate son, called Charles de Flahaut was promoted general at age 27. Napoléon’s brother Louis was promoted general at 24 years, 6 months and 19 days.

Thoughts?\n\nmerci,\n\ndave\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\nOf all the aides de camp for Berthier at Austerlitz (de Girardin, Édouard de Colbert, Louis Lejeune, Edmond de Talleyrand-Périgord, Armand de Lelièvre-Lagrange and Charles de Longchamps), only Girardin had been with him at the beginning of the year at the ministry of defense. Colbert had been Junot’s aide de camp. Lejeune had been on the engineering staff of the 1st military division at Paris. Périgord had been Pino’s aide de camp in the Italian service. Largrange had been Sébastiani’s aide de camp. Longchamps, actually a civilian, had been personal secretary to Murat’s wife, princess Caroline, grand-duchess of Berg. All but Girardin had been named only after the entry into the campaign in September.\n\n1805 pre-dates the famous Lejeune-designed hussar style uniform for Berthier’s aides de camp. There was a regulation uniform for aides de camp decreed in An XII:\n\n— plain dark blue habit-frac with a single row of gold buttons (marked with a casque crossed by an epee, surrounded by oak leaves), with collar and cuffs sky-blue\n\n— dark blue trousers, tucked into hussar boots\n\n— white brassard, chapeau with white plume topped red (for aides to generals en chief)\n\n— rank insignia, possibly gold aiguillette on right shoulder (not per regulation outside of the guard until 1812, but apparently worn earlier by army HQ officers)\n\nHow much was this regulation uniform really worn ? Especially when aides de camp were “grabbed” at the start of a campaign ?\n\nYet Girardin had been in Paris at the ministry (albeit carried on the books of chasseur regiments since March*). So I would put him in the regulation uniform, in contrast to his colleagues.\n\n*Presumably, because his billet at the ministry needed to be back-filled as he transitioned to the army HQ staff then being formed.\n\nAlexandre-Louis-Robert de Girardin d’Ermenonville\n\n— 13.II.1776 né à Paris\n\n…………\n\n— 14.X.1801 passé lieutenant aide de camp du général Molitor\n\n— 15.IV.1802 promu capitaine\n\n— 22.VI.1802 naissance à Paris de son fils naturel, alors dit “Émile de Lamothe” – la mère est madam Adélaïde-Marie Dupuy née Fagnan (1775-1851), épouse d’un magistrat\n\n— 30.VI.1803 passé aide-de-camp du ministre de la guerre général Berthier\n\n— 5.VIII.1804 fait membre de la Légion d’honneur\n\n— ~15.VIII.1804 fait sécrétaire-général de la grand vénerie impériale\n\n— 24.III.1805 passé capitaine au 23e régiment de chasseurs à cheval\n\n— 1805 à la Grande armée\n\n— 28.X.1805 promu chef d’escadron au 8e régiment de chasseurs à cheval **\n\n— 26.XII.1805 promu officier de la Légion d’honneur\n\n— 1806 à l’armée d’Italie\n\n— ~15.IV.1806 promu lieutenant de la grande louveterie impériale\n\n— 30.XII.1806 promu colonel du 8e régiment de dragons\n\netc., etc., etc.\n\n** An interesting coincidence : Girardin’s former colleague at the ministry of defense, adjudant-commandant Jean-Baptiste Curto, was passed colonel of the same regiment on the same day.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Alexandre_Louis_Robert_Girardin_d%27Ermenonville.jpg?20170425162409\n\nhttps://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1153662/f448.item.r=Girardin.zoom\n\nhttps://gw.geneanet.org/public/img/media/deposits/b0/2c/3115886/medium.jpg?t=1449385917\n\nhttps://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?lang=fr&n=fagnan&oc=0&p=adelaide+marie\n\nAlexandre my thanks once again; for the wealth and depth of info and support of my suppositions.\n\nIt is not well understood I feel in gaming circles that ADCs came and went- and alluding to my earlier comments about a mix of responsibilities- the day job, then the glory etc. are separate matters.\n\nIt is probably wrong to call them sinecures, but the ‘holding’ of rank in the hierarchy (whether Army or Regiment) was common process as you show as well. no doubt there is a more correct term, which at this moment eludes me.\n\nI have suitable figures, not quite painted yet- one of these might do. I am thinking however, as you cite the ‘Army’ regulation dress with sky/ celeste facings; that perhaps at the MoW and Etat-Major-Generale it is equally likely that a more sombre all national blue with lace only, similar to Adjutant-Commandant/ Adjoint uniform may be probable?\n\nMy customised ADCs -Laville (Bessieres) and Lejeune (Berthier) in his 1806 style uniform colours (the Miniature Figurines model is the 18008/09 version but is too nice not to use him).\n\nOne note, I do not have on record [nor from my SHAT copies] Charles de Longchamps at all. Is it possible he was a Secretaire or some such if he was just a civilian?\n\nregards davew\n\nSwinging from left to right no matter where the hobby goes!\n\nBy regulation, no embroidery. But, how much was this really followed ?\n\n“holding’ of rank in the hierarchy (whether Army or Regiment) was common process as you show as well.”\n\n“Grabbing” AdC’s from regiments (the usual practice for the Russian army throughout the era) was considered an abuse by Napoléon (he also tried to insist that sous-lieutenants not be posted as AdC’s). By the later Empire, the AdC’s had no regimental affiliation, and instead were considered as “officiers d’état major”. Against the was the patronage system, increasingly common as the old nobility returned to service, of having friends’ or relatives’ sons posted as AdC’s to ease their hardships in campaigning and spur their advancement.\n\nCharles de Longchamps (Charles-Joseph-Marie de Laulne de Lonchamps) is mentioned by Lejeune as arriving shortly before the battle. He implies that he served with Berthier. However, some bios assume he was with Murat. His Légion d’honneur dossier has him officially posted from 23 October 1805 as a “capitaine adjoint d’état major à l’armée de réserve”.\n\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Longchamps\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=ktZfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA133\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=ipkY_a2K8yQC&pg=PA27\n\nhttps://books.google.hr/books?id=S7U5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA327\n\nhttps://www.leonore.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/ui/notice/107103"
