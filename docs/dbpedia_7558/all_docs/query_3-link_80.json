        "text": "“Come and see how a Marshal of France meets his death!”\n\nSo shouted Marshal Michel Ney as, with suicidal bravery, he led one of the final French charges at Waterloo. That he was seeking death deliberately is of course entirely possible and there has been much discussion about Ney’s mental state at the time of the Waterloo campaign. Famously of course, he was not to fall on the battlefield.\n\nIt is quite surprising that so few of Napoleon’s marshals died in battle; few could be accused of not leading from the front and they certainly exposed themselves to plenty of risk. As it is, of the twenty-six men to hold the baton, almost three quarters of died of natural causes and, while the average age of death was 65, several of them lived into their eighties.\n\nEight of the marshals were not so lucky and met deaths that can be described as violent at best and in some cases downright brutal. This article will look at how their deaths occurred and what became of their reputations and legacies afterwards.\n\nContinue reading ““Come see how a Marshal of France meets his death!” – A look at the deaths of Napoleon’s Marshals.” →\n\nMortier was born in 1768, the year before Napoleon, and was the son of a cloth merchant and an Englishwoman. Mortier grew up speaking fluent English and was originally intended to follow in his father’s footsteps as a merchant. However when the Revolution broke out, he enlisted in the National Guard of Dunkirk. In 1791, he was elected captain in the 1st Battalion of Volunteers of Nord.\n\nIn 1793 he was promoted to chef de bataillon after serving at Maestricht, Neerwinden, and Pellenberg. He then became Chief of Staff to Balland and was wounded at Dourlers. His story in the Revolutionary Wars was one of general success: he forced Fort Saint-Pierre to surrender, distinguished himself at Neuwied, took 600 Austrian prisoners at Willendorf and successfully concluded the surrender of Mainz. By the end of 1790s, he was a général de brigade and had served with a few fellow marshals-to-be: Lefebvre, Masséna and Soult.\n\nWhen Napoleon became First Consul, he appointed Mortier as commander of the 17th and 15th military divisions in Paris; a position he held until war broke out in 1803. Motier was then sent to occupy Hanover – which he did successfully. Pleased with his performance there, Napoleon included him on the list of Marshals when the Empire was created in 1804.\n\nMortier served at UIm and Austerlitz, and commanded the VIII Corps of the Grande Armée in 1806. After Napoleon’s triumph at Jena, he was instrumental in conquering Hesse and Hanover and then occupying Cassel, Brême, and Hamburg. In 1808, the Emperor created him Duke of Treviso.\n\nHis next campaign was in Spain 1808 where he had more success than some of his fellows; winning at Licinena, Ocana, Gebro and Campo Mayor. In 1811 he was recalled to France to command the Young Guard. This would take him to Russia, where Napoleon refused to commit them at Borodino. Made Governor of Moscow, he was tasked with destroying the Kremlin on the retreat.\n\nWhen France was threatened in 1814, Mortier then took command of the Old Guard and fought hard in the defence of his country. Eventually driven back, he was active in the defence of Paris until Marmont’s actions effectively brought the Napoleonic Wars to an end.\n\nThe Bourbons created Mortier a peer of France and a Knight of Saint Louis. In return, the Marshal refused to act against the Bourbons while they were on French ground; waiting until they had fled the country in 1815 before joining Napoleon. Napoleon gave Mortier command of the Imperial Guard’s cavalry but unfortunately by Waterloo he was so ill he couldn’t even mount a horse and so missed out on the battle.\n\nWhen the Bourbons were restored again, they removed Mortier’s peerage in punishment and ordered him to serve on the council that was to trial Ney. He and his fellow officers declared themselves not competent to try their former comrade. In 1819, his peerage was returned.\n\nIn 1830, Louis-Philippe (who Mortier had served with in the Revolutionary Wars) became King and made Mortier the Ambassador to Russia for a year. Afterwards, he held various roles in the French Government including Minister of War.\n\nOn 28 July 1835, Mortier was one of those accompanying King Louis-Philippe of France to a review of the Paris National Guard when Fieschi’s assassination attempt took place. A volley of gunfire was directed at the royal party, which killed eighteen of them. Marshal Mortier, in his late sixties, was one of the eighteen.\n\nHis heart was buried in the family tomb at Pere Lachaise while his body is buried at Les Invalides."
