half-English and bilingual, he was schooled at the College des Anglais in Douai; he volunteered for service in the National Guard of Dunkirk (Dunkerque) and then of Le Cateau in 1789; he was elected captain of the 1st Volunteer Battalion, Army of the North, on November 1, 1791; he fought with distinction under Dumouriez at Jemappes (November 6) and at the siege of Namur (November 6-December 2, 1792); in 1793 he fought at Neerwinden (March 18) and Hondschoote (September 8), after which he was made adjutant general; he fought at Fleurus (June 26, 1794) and was then transferred to the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse, where he won distinction during the crossing of the Rhine at Maastricht (September 22-November 4, 1794); he was made general of brigade in 1797 but turned down the promotion, only accepting it two years later in 1799; he fought under Soult at Zurich (June 4-7, 1799) and, in October, was made general of division at Massena's recommendation; Bonaparte appointed him to command the Seventeenth Military Division in Paris in 1800 on the suggestion of Lefebvre; in 1803 he was sent to occupy Hanover, accepting the surrender of its army in July; in 1804 he was made commander of the artillery and sailors of the Consular Guard with the rank of colonel general, and made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor; in May he received his marshal's baton; in 1805 he was made commander of the infantry at the Imperial Guard; in the campaign of 1805 he commanded a provisional corps with orders to support Murat's advance guard; on November 11, while engaging Kutuzov's rear guard at the defile at Durrenstein, he was attacked from the rear by Doctorov; although two thirds of his leading division were casualties, and he was in imminent danger of being captured, he held his position against superior numbers until relieved that night by Dupont's division; after the battle of Austerlitz (December 2) he succeeded Lannes as commander of the V Corps; from October 1806 to June 1807 he commanded the VIII corps and drove the Prusso-Swedish forces out of Hanover and Pomerania; he returned to the Grande Armee in time to command the left wing at Friedland (June 14, 1807); in 1808 he was created Duke of Treviso; in October 1808 he was sent to Spain and resumed command of the V Corps, fighting at Somosierra (December 20) and the siege of Saragossa (December 20, 1808-February 20, 1809) under Lannes; in 1809 he fought at Arzobispo (August 4) and Ocana under Soult and was wounded at the latter; he was present at the siege of Badajoz (January 26-March 9, 1811) before being\n\nrecalled to France in May 1811: for the invasion of Russia he was made commander of the Young Guard, fighting at Borodino (September 7); he was made governor of Moscow, spending most of his time trying to prevent the fires started by escaped Russian prisoners from burning down the city; during the retreat from Moscow he fought at Krasnoye (November 17) and at the Berezina (November 27-29); in January 1813 he was put in command of the remnants of the Imperial Guard; he resumed his command of the Young Guard in Germany, fighting under Napoleon at Lutzen (May 2), Bautzen (May 20-21), Dresden (August 26-27), and Leipzig (October 16-19); in the campaign for France in 1814 he was given command of the Old Guard and fought a brilliant series of rear-guard actions at Montmirail (February 11), Craonne (March 7), and Laon (March 9-10); together with Marmont he was beaten at La Fere-Champenoise (March 25) and at Montmartre (outside Paris) (March 30); on March 31 he and Marmont opened negotiations with the Allies; on the return of the Bourbons, he was made a peer of France, a chevalier of the Order of St. Louis, and governor of the Sixteenth Military Division; after escorting Louis XVIII to the Belgian border, he rejoined Napoleon for the Hundred Days, receiving command of the cavalry of the Guard on June 8, 1815; on June 15 he was struck by a severe attack of sciatica, and relinquished his command at Beaumont; he was ordered to sit on the board at Ney's court-martial but, along with four others, declared himself not competent to judge a fellow marshal; he was in disgrace for a period but in 1816 was restored to command and put in charge of the Fifteenth Military Division; in 1820 he was made commander of the Order of St. Louis and in 1829 governor of the Fourteenth Military Division; from 1830 to 1832 he was ambassador to Russia and in 1831 became a Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honor; from November 18, 1834, to March 12, 1835, he was Minister for War; on July 28, 1835, he was acting as escort to King Louis Philippe at a parade of the National Guard when he was killed by the bomb which Fieschi had meant for the King.\n\nMortier was a good independent field commander and the perfect subordinate; his bravery and skill in handling men was amply demonstrated at Durrenstein, and his conduct of rearguard actions in 1814 rank with those of Ney in Russia; while not a brilliant man, he was the only marshal who was liked and respected by the entire marshalate. <BL>\n\nSources: Delderfield, R.
