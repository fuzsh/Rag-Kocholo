I humbly present this little corner of the Napoleonic Wars for your approval.\n\nxi\n\nPreface\n\nThe publisher Johann Friedrich Vieweg was a resourceful and flexible man. In 1799 he accepted an offer from the Duke of Brunswick (in German: Braunschweig) to move his business there from Berlin, an offer no doubt inspired by the Duke’s friendship with Vieweg’s father-in-law, the philosopher and linguist Johann Heinrich Campe. Vieweg collected a handsome stipend for his troubles and prospered by publishing tracts by German scholars and would-be reformers. After Braunschweig fell to Napoleon, who abolished its state and dynasty, Vieweg did not hesitate to hitch his star to the new Napoleonic state of Westphalia that replaced it. Becoming a member of Braunschweig’s new Westphalian city council connected him with the right people and his business again thrived. He sold a wide array of official and semi-official publications for a regime that seemingly could never put enough down on paper: tomes of weights and measures, essays on the new laws, statistical indices, instructional manuals for the new civil service, and so on. One of his authors was the Braunschweig cathedral’s head cleric, Johann Gottlieb Wolff, who, in order to keep his job, was gritting his teeth and writing celebratory sermons for a king and regime he despised. When Westphalia collapsed six years later, Vieweg deftly pivoted to the next opportunity and was soon publishing tracts and memoirs about how dreadful it had all been and how glad everyone was that it was gone. Among his stable of authors was once again Reverend Wolff, this time writing sermons celebrating the allied victory over Napoleon and thanking the Almighty for deliverance from the foreign conqueror. It is likely that Vieweg’s politics ran only as deep as his pocketbook, and he was happy to make money from Westphalia, whether praising it or damning it. In the process he unwittingly became the starting point for two centuxiii\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nries of German historiography about this strange and fascinating experiment in transplanting French law, administration, and culture into the heart of Germany. Germans began writing about Westphalia from the moment it was created in 1807. When it collapsed in 1813 and the dangers of Napoleonic censorship disappeared, men who had been active in the regime were eager to salvage their reputations. A number of memoirs appeared, often purporting to be histories of the Westphalian period, at least insofar as these men had been actors in it. If they could not render themselves employable for the restoration regimes, they could at least salve their consciences with memoirs that explained how their collaboration was misunderstood and how they had in fact been skeptics all along. 1 Westphalia’s opponents had by necessity kept a low profile in most cases from 1807 to 1813. After the regime collapsed, many were proud enough of their subterfuge (or at least their told-you-so opposition) to pen nostalgic memoirs that depicted their roles in the state’s ultimate demise. A healthy skepticism is of course necessary when reading many of these works, but they remain useful references. 2 Other men wrote memoirs without any obvious agenda for their careers, in most cases because they had been quite young during the Westphalian period and had not held positions of responsibility. A large number of military memoirs appeared in the nineteenth century, in some cases assembled by a son or grandson after the death of the author. 3 The majority of these works have as their centerpiece the harrowing Russian campaign of 1812. These tales of survival stand on their own merits and usually have little to do with politics or national sentiment. There were also several civilians who had been young men during the Westphalian period, had later attained higher positions, and who wrote of their time in Westphalia without any concern for the stigma of collaboration. 4 In addition to books by people whose lives and careers were connected to Westphalia in some way, a large number of memoirs survive by authors who had little connection to events, sometimes indeed only in their imaginations. In most cases they were contemporaries, in some cases distant observers. That did not prevent them from leaving several fairly extraordinary accounts, many of which promise (but rarely deliver) salacious gossip about the personal lives of King Jerome and his court. A general pan-German triumphalism was prevalent in the decades after the Napoleonic Wars and there was money to be made by reinforcing stereotypes of French debauchery and corruption. Many of these works were deliberate parody. 5 Others claimed to be authentic and faithful depictions. Several of the authors were anonymous or pseudonymous, with a variety of creative reasons for concealing their identity. 6\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nIn the late nineteenth century two works appeared that had a profound impact on the historiography of the Kingdom of Westphalia. In 1888 Rudolf Goecke and Theodor Ilgen published Das Königreich Westfalen: Sieben Jahre französische Fremdherrschaft im Herzen Deutschlands 1807–1813. Goecke and Ilgen were archivists in Wetzlar and Düsseldorf, respectively. Five years later Arthur Kleinschmidt, a Hessian historian teaching at the University of Heidelberg, published Geschichte des Königreichs Westfalen. These two books remain the only scholarly attempts in a single volume at fashioning a grand narrative: a history of Westphalia in its entirety. In many ways these works should be considered together as representative of the state of scholarship at their time and the influence of nationalist sensibilities. In both cases they assert that the history of Westphalia is a morality tale, a story of the “deep decadence and powerful, radiant resurgence” of the German people, in Goecke and Ilgen’s formulation, and that the entire Napoleonic period represents “the deepest humiliation of German princes and people,” as Kleinschmidt writes, with Westphalia being “a French vassal in the midst of our fatherland.” 7 In subsequent scholarship, Goecke and Ilgen have been cited more frequently, although Kleinschmidt’s work is by far the better documented. Nonetheless both books are conveniently credulous with regard to unsubstantiated rumors that would paint Jerome or the French in a poor light. Thus, we find in Kleinschmidt, for example, the famous canard about Jerome bathing in red wine. And in both books we are assured, without much substantiation, that the Westphalian regime was almost universally loathed. Neither book would stand a twenty-first-century test for verity in documentation, much less for thoroughness, and Goecke and Ilgen in particular offer virtually no evidence even when directly quoting or offering figures. By the time these works appeared, Germans had agreed on a consensus history of the “War of Liberation” directed by the Prussian historians who dominated the new German Kaiserreich. In this narrative the German people were awakened by the disaster in Russia and then called to arms by King Frederick William III of Prussia in early 1813. The preparations of the Prussian military and civil reformers ensured that the Germans understood they were now all one people, united in their desire to throw off the yoke of the Corsican tyrant and liberate the Fatherland, by returning it to its rightful sovereigns. Because the collapse of the Westphalian regime in 1813 was indeed attended by uprisings, desertion, and enthusiasm for the liberating allies, its example legitimated the official version of history found in children’s schoolbooks and made popular in fiction, poetry, and theater. Perhaps the reason that no German authors attempted to revise Goecke and Ilgen or Kleinschmidt is simply that those works suited the consensus so perfectly. It\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nis not an exaggeration to say that no significant alteration of the narrative occurred until after the Second World War. The postwar division of Germany resulted in two distinct renderings of German history. The East German historiography was grounded in a Marxist teleology in which Napoleon emerged as a representative of bourgeois interests in the wake of the French Revolution. Socialist historians were generally interested in the French impact on Germany only insofar as it presaged popular uprisings that exhibited class awareness. Despite this narrowly constructed interpretation, some important work on the Napoleonic period was carried out in the DDR. With regard to Westphalia, the most significant East German historian was surely Heinz Heitzer, whose Insurrectionen Zwischen Weser und Elbe appeared in 1959. Heitzer focused on rural resistance to the Bonaparte regime and was the first historian to document the breadth of discontent across Westphalia using the papers of police and local government. In West Germany a significant revision was under way as the postwar period reevaluated Germans’ historical relationship with France. From the 1960s, school texts downplayed Franco-German rivalries and increasingly depicted the Napoleonic period as an early phase of European integration that brought modern, secular government to old regime Germany. By the 1970s, the old War of Liberation paradigm was collapsing as a new generation of historians revisited primary sources and raised questions about early nineteenth-century German nationality and loyalties. In 1973 Helmut Berding, who had just been appointed to the position at the University of Gießen that he would hold for a quarter-century, published Napoleonische Herrschafts- und Gesellschaftspolitik im Königreich Westfalen. The scholarly importance of this book was immediately obvious. It raised questions that transcended the old issues of national identity. For example: to what degree was the Napoleonic system in Westphalia simply a reflection of Napoleon’s personal patronage? Was the French administrative style really so different from the German predecessor states? And most importantly: what was the impact of French reforms on ordinary people? From the 1970s through the 1990s, Berding wrote or contributed to dozens of books and scholarly articles, many of which addressed issues regarding the Kingdom of Westphalia. He contributed original scholarship on questions of constitutionalism, the emancipation of Jews, political reform, and several other subjects. In so doing, he became the twentieth century’s most important scholar of Westphalia, and arguably, Westphalia’s most important historian to date. Berding’s work is often seen as the starting point for subsequent modern research. Yet he never attempted to bring this great body of work together into a single narrative history. Nor did he address in any substantive way one of the most significant aspects of the Westphalian state: the construction and role of its military.\n\nPreface\n\nxvii\n\nIt can be argued that Westphalia’s most important purpose, from Napoleon’s perspective, was as a recruiter and supplier of soldiers for the imperial French war effort. Yet aside from one work during the Third Reich, the Westphalian military and its campaigns have not interested German scholars, despite the plethora of soldiers’ memoirs surviving from the nineteenth century. 8 Interestingly, the story of the army is the only aspect of Westphalian history that has interested English-language historians, specifically Americans. Owen Connelly included a laudatory chapter on the Westphalians in his 1966 Napoleon’s Satellite Kingdoms, which introduced Westphalia (as one of the many French allies) to many American readers for the first time. Connelly’s use of sources was very limited and his focus was predominantly on the military, but his contribution remains significant as the first scholar since 1903 to attempt any sort of exploration of Westphalia in English. 9 In 1992 Colonel John Gill published With Eagles to Glory, an analysis of the German contingents in Napoleon’s 1809 campaign against Austria. Like Connelly, Gill devoted a chapter to the Westphalians, at least insofar as their 1809 efforts were concerned, and he became the first scholar in any language to attempt to bring together many of the memoirs of Westphalian soldiers in an analytical way. In addition to Gill, Michael Pavkovic of the US Naval War College is perhaps the only other scholar in any language to have written Westphalian military history from archival research. 10 Modern German and French scholars have generally been uninterested in the subject. By the end of the twentieth century, German scholarship had completely revised the traditional picture of the War of Liberation. The Napoleonic wars were no longer depicted as a time of suffering and oppression. Napoleon was a modernizer and innovator who built new roads and canals, rationalized civil service and administration, struck down old religious- and class-based prejudices, and opened promotion based on merit. Indeed by the 1980s, West German school texts even featured sections on Napoleon as a harbinger of the European Community: an early attempt to unify the continent. When the suffering of common people was mentioned, it was usually within the context of war in general, not the result of a specifically national conflict of Frenchmen versus Germans. Pan-German patriotism was depicted as a tool used cynically by the aristocracy and then put aside once their military goals had been achieved. In the words of one historian, “The ‘national uprising’ just didn’t happen.” 11 In the early twenty-first century, with interest in the Napoleonic period stimulated by the bicentennials of the famous events, a new generation of German historians produced the most substantial body of work to date on the Kingdom of Westphalia. German scholarship on this topic, plentiful and significant as it has been, has tended to produce anthologies and compilations, with scholars each contributing a chapter or essay. 12 These books, with\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\ntheir often widely divergent contents, have been important scholarly contributions, but they lack a single narrative. In addition to the scholars who have contributed to these anthologies, four recent works stand out as particularly significant. Annika Bethan’s Napoleons Königreich Westphalen: Lokale, deutsche, und europäische Errinerungen (2012) is the closest thing to a single-volume monograph of Westphalian history in more than a century. Bethan’s focus, however, is primarily historiographic, particularly how Westphalia was seen by Germans in the nineteenth century before German unification in 1871. In 2011 Nicola Todorov published L’administration du royaume de Westphalie de 1807 à 1813. Le département de l’Elbe. He revealed considerable primary sources in places that most scholars had not yet examined, such as Russian archives and the smaller regional German archives. The foremost French-language scholar of Jerome Bonaparte, Jacques-Olivier Boudon, published a comprehensive biography of the young Westphalian king in 2008 titled Le Roi Jérôme, frère prodigue de Napoléon, which asserted that Jerome was generally more engaged in government than previous authors had given him credit for, albeit futilely, given the overwhelming power of Napoleon. Most recently, Claudie Paye broke considerable new ground with her study of language politics in Westphalia. Her “Der französichen Sprache mächtig”: Kommunikation im Spannungsfeld von Sprachen und Kulturen im Königreich Westphalen was published in 2013. Having studied the Westphalian postal system, censorship, and the politics of language, Paye drew from these topics to provide a fascinating ground-level view of how people’s lives were affected by changes to the conditions and environment of their work. A HISTORY OF WESTPHALIA Why has no one attempted to write a scholarly narrative “The History of Westphalia” since the 1890s, much less a history accessible to an Englishlanguage readership? In the early stages of my research I was puzzled by the omission. I soon came to understand the scale of the challenge. The Prussian state archives in Berlin and the Hessian archives in Marburg hold, between them, more than eighteen thousand files specifically related to the Kingdom of Westphalia. The state archives of Lower Saxony hold another two to three thousand, divided among several locations. Several other German local and regional archives hold anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred. Because Russian troops confiscated a number of papers from Kassel in 1813–1814, there are at least two collections of Westphalian documents in Russia. The state archive in St. Petersburg contains several hundred\n\nPreface\n\nxix\n\nentries dealing primarily with civil affairs, and the Russian military archive in Moscow has a largely yet-uncatalogued (and in some cases even unexamined) collection of military records, which historian Alexander Mikaberidze estimates “in the thousands” of files. The roughest estimate is that German, French, and Russian archives probably contain at least half a million pages of documents from the Westphalian period. If one were to spend just fifteen minutes on each page, eight hours a day, doing nothing else every working day of the year, it would take at least seventy years to read them all. Consequently I had to make some hard decisions about what to investigate, where, and for how long. I used Westphalia’s own official publications, plus the many semi-official publications written on behalf of the state, plus the memoirs and correspondence of about 120 participants and witnesses to events, and consulted the collections of five archives: Berlin, Marburg, Braunschweig, and the Lower Saxon state archives in Hannover and Wolfenbüttel. By this method I hoped to draw from sources from all of the major components of Westphalia, the Prussian, Hessian, Brunswick, and Hannoverian lands. There are also of course files in France that deal with Jerome and his family and personal transactions, as well as military documents. Situation reports of the Westphalian VIII Corps in the Grande Armée in Russia, for example, are part of the larger French collections in the Service Historique de la Défense in Paris. These reports, however, have raised a number of questions because of inconsistencies. In addition to being a (admittedly old-fashioned) narrative history of a fascinating time and place, this book seeks to address two issues. First, I wanted to deal with individual actors as individuals, that is, without necessarily seeking to categorize them. My goal was to contextualize those individuals and examine the degree to which they understood what was happening around them and what it meant to them. I have sought therefore to tell the stories of people in ways that show their interactions with each other and with the state. I have sought also to reexamine the ways in which modern German historiography has defined the Napoleonic period. Much of the recent scholarship on Westphalia and Napoleonic Germany in general has sanitized the story by ignoring the high emotion of the period or dismissing it as hyperbole or subsequent mythology. The traditional depiction of the War of Liberation as a great, single-minded national awakening has been completely rejected by modern scholars, and for good reasons. That said, however, I suspect that German historians have to some degree overcorrected. Old stories might be wrong if they are fictional or exaggerated, but they are not wrong simply because they are old.\n\nxx\n\nPreface\n\nThis book seeks therefore to place the story of Westphalia within the context of the larger German story of the Napoleonic Wars. Westphalia was an unwitting test case for what we would today call “cultural imperialism.” To some degree Napoleon had intended it to be from the outset. Westphalia was conceived as a “model state” that would showcase the new era dawning in Germany and the benefits of French hegemony. It did exactly that, albeit not with the results that its creators intended or desired. Sam Mustafa Professor of History, Ramapo College of New Jersey Mahwah, New Jersey, April 2017 NOTES 1. [See bibliography for full citations.] Significant among these are the works of Friedrich Ludwig von Berlepsch, Wilhelm Böhme, Gottfried Philipp von Bülow, Karl August von Malchus (who wrote two books about his controversial tenure as Westphalia’s last finance minister), Ludwig von Ompteda, Friedrich Senfft von Pilsach, Friedrich Karl von Strombeck, Gustav Anton von Wolffradt, and most significantly, the police commissioner Friedrich von Wolff, whose memoirs appeared in 1814, while he still had reason to fear for his life because of vigilantism. The memoires of Jacques-Claude Beugnot, Westphalia’s first finance minister during the 1807 regency, are less illuminating with regard to German historiography because they appeared in France under the Second Empire during a period of nostalgia for all things Napoleonic.The 1814 memoirs of Friedrich Cramer, a lawyer who became Westphalia’s director of indirect taxation, have been repeatedly cited by serious modern European historians (among others: Bethan, Payé, and Todorov), but I remain skeptical of his reliability, and not simply because of his hyperbole. Cramer is often careless with basic facts, such as when he claims that Jerome Bonaparte and Elizabeth Patterson had more than one child, or when he repeatedly spells Beugnot as “Beugnat,” or when he refers to Westphalia (which is quite hilly and mountainous in several regions) as “that flat land.” Aside from these infelicities, his focus is entirely and narrowly on a small slice of the administration. 2. Among these are the memoirs of Christian Adolf Buhle, Karl Christian von Gehren, Heinrich Keßler, Johann Heinrich Meyer, Ignaz August Mierzinsky, Ludwig Müller, Carl Nicolai, and the great scholar Henrik Steffens, whose immense memoirs can scarcely conceal his joy when relating the story of Westphalia’s decline and fall and his role in it. 3. More than sixty military memoirs have survived in some form. Some comprise only a few pages, rescued by some nineteenth-century German local historical magazine, and others are detailed recollections for hundreds of pages. Brevity prevents a list of them here, but I have compiled them in a separate section of the bibliography. 4. For example: Franz Anton Niemeyer, who was a schoolteacher during most of the Westphalian period, and only achieved a professorship in 1813. Or Edmund Heussinger, whose career as a historian began only after the Napoleonic Wars. Heinrich Kohlrausch, who came of age as a student during Westphalian times, left one of the best portraits of Tugendbund activity in that region. Karl von Lehsten und Dingelstadt, who was a teenaged page to King Jerome, left an invaluable detailed description of court life, as did Louis von Kaisenberg. August Wilhelm Rehberg, writing in 1814, offers perhaps the most remarkable example of an eyewitness with no axes to grind, providing an even-handed analysis of the pros and cons of importing French law into Germany. In 1816 Carl Salomo Zacharia, a professor of law in Heidelberg, produced a similarly even-handed and serious analysis of Westphalian history, with an emphasis on finance and the legitimacy of confiscation of property by the state.\n\nPreface\n\nxxi\n\n5. Carl Nicolai, writing as “Peter Hilarius,” is the most literary and amusing example of this genre. Most others were anonymous. Nicolai is probably also the anonymous author of the equally witty Die französische Garküche an der Fulda, a surprisingly well-informed but ultimately satirical sendup of Jerome and the entire Westphalian administration. 6. Edmund Heussinger’s hyper-nationalist tract is an example of how this trend had evolved by the 1840s. Heinrich Pröhle’s Die Fremdherrschaft stretches credulity to its utter limits, including the author’s claim to have seen the Prussian king weeping. August Ernst Zinserling’s Geheime Geschichte is perhaps the best-known example of this genre, although he did have a solid claim to authenticity, having worked as a teacher of Westphalian pages in Kassel. Zinserling squanders that legitimacy, however, with absurd hyperbole, rarely backed up by any concrete examples. (His second book, Westphälische Denkwürdigkeiten, even includes the disclaimer that the reader should not expect any proof or documentation for claims made in the text.) Vincent Lombard de Langrés, writing anonymously, produced a similar depiction, albeit much wittier than Zinserling’s angry polemics, and which became popular in English translation. 7.

Glenn Lamar’s biography Jerome Bonaparte: The War Years 1800–1815 (2000) must be used with considerable caution because of the large number of basic errors, such as getting the number of Westphalian departments wrong, confusing the existence of the 1811 departments with some of the 1808 ones, not understanding where or how Jerome and Catherine were married, stating the wrong date for the promulgation of the constitution, confusing LeCamus with the position of state secretary, erroneously placing Johannes von Müller under Wolffradt’s direction in the Interior [sic] Ministry, and so on. 11.

The French influence was strong and pervasive but never conclusive. Thus, a man named “Albrecht Heinrich” might write his name as “Albert-Henri” in some circumstances but not in others. Even during Westphalia’s existence we see state officials writing its name with an “f” or a “ph” (Westfalen/Westphalen), or sometimes with a more French ending: “Westphalie.” There was, alas, no agreed-upon standard, not even in official correspondence. Consequently I have made my own decisions about spelling in the interest of clarity and consistency but also with an attempt at keeping German spellings reasonably intact in an English-language text. I have striven to adhere to the following conventions: I write the name of the state as “Westphalia.” Place names have retained their German spellings, such as Hannover and Kassel, rather than “Hanover” and “Cassel.” In the case of Braunschweig, I sometimes use the English “Brunswick” when it works better as an adjective or part of a title, such as “Duke of Brunswick” rather than Herzog von Braunschweig. German and French personal names have been rendered in English if the person is already famous or well-known to an English-language readership. For example: King Jérôme is written as “Jerome” and King Friedrich-Wilhelm is written as “Frederick William.” Other (i.e., most) less familiar names have remained in their French or German spellings, such as “Siméon” or “Dörnberg.” Titles are translated into English, unless the idiom allows for no simple translation. For example, I use “Duke” or “Count” in English, but xxiii\n\nxxiv\n\nNotes on Spelling and Usage\n\nleave “Kurfürst” in German because it is simpler than “Hereditary Electoral Prince.” If a person wrote his or her name in both German and French spellings, I have used the German version if that person was German. For example: Karl August von Malchus, rather than “Carl Auguste.” On the other hand, if a German consistently used a French spelling, then I left that intact.\n\nChapter One\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\nYou have nothing to expect but improvements! —Marshal Édouard Mortier, November 1, 1806\n\nOn November 2, 1806, shortly after his tenth birthday, Theodor Weiß was startled when the family’s servant, a young woman, burst through the door to announce that the French army had entered their town of Hofgeismar. “Nothing but French as far as the eye can see!” she exclaimed as the streets filled up with columns of foreign soldiers. Too young to be afraid and oblivious to the impositions or the fear that gripped his parents, young Theodor gathered his friends and began to play soldier. They shouted the few French commands they knew and marched around the town square in emulation of the new occupiers. If someone had told him, he probably would have been very excited to learn that within seven years he would wear a similar uniform and that he would indeed fight under the flag of the new state created by the conquest he witnessed as a child. Born in Hessen-Kassel, Theodor Weiß was just old enough to serve in the army of the Kingdom of Westphalia. 1 And yet before he turned eighteen, that state had ceased to exist. A ten-year-old boy likely had no idea what brought Napoleon’s army to this little rural town about fifteen miles north of Kassel in the heart of Germany. Many of his fellow townsfolk were equally surprised because HessenKassel was a neutral state in 1806; they had not taken a side in the War of the Fourth Coalition. They were witnessing the final phase of the French conquest of Germany, a process that had begun elsewhere and had been underway for more than a decade. France took control of the Rhineland relatively early in the 1790s during the wars of the French Revolution. These campaigns pitted the French Republic against several opponents, but in the case of the German-speaking 1\n\n2\n\nChapter 1\n\nlands, most directly against Prussia and Austria. The result over the course of the 1790s was that several million Germans were added to France, and the French borders moved significantly eastward. This was not a process limited to Germany. Republican France expanded to the north and southeast as well, into what is now Belgium and the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most dramatically in Italy, where a remarkable young Corsican general named Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the various armies sent against him and gradually extended French control throughout most of the Italian peninsula. Several of the Republic’s conquests were initially conceived as puppet “sister republics,” but in 1797 most of the conquered German territories were annexed to France in a process that was completed by 1802. In November 1799, in collaboration with other military and civil figures, Napoleon staged a coup d’état and soon emerged as the leader of an entirely new regime, the Consulate. Over the next two years Bonaparte strengthened his position and became the sole ruler of France. His power was based as much on his continued military success as it was on the efficiency of his civil administration, and he quickly developed a dictatorial style. Although the state had bureaux, a judiciary, and a legislature, they answered to a hierarchy in which ultimate power rested in the hands of one man. In late 1804, Napoleon held a plebiscite, staged a coronation, promulgated a new constitution, and proclaimed himself “Emperor of the French.” In the early 1800s Napoleonic France began to cement its power in Germany beyond the annexed regions. Some German states such as Württemberg and Baden created alliances with France because doing so protected them from the possibility of French conquest and offered rewards such as territorial expansion in return for marching at Napoleon’s side in future wars. Other states like Bavaria already had a long history of alliance with France, and it was not a great leap to renew that relationship. In winter 1804–1805, in response to Napoleon’s coronation, his further consolidation of power in Italy, and his execution of the Duc d’Enghien, Britain secured an alliance with Russia, Austria, and Sweden, creating the socalled Third Coalition against France. Although he was frustrated at sea, Napoleon decisively defeated the coalition on land, with the campaign culminating in the Battle of Austerlitz in early December 1805. This victory gave him the opportunity to remake large portions of the German heartland according to French strategic interests. Following the Peace of Pressburg, the Habsburg emperor not only withdrew from the war and ceded land to Napoleon in Italy and Dalmatia, but he also renounced his authority in Germany, paving the way for Napoleon to abolish the Holy Roman Empire. The viability of the old Reich had been challenged for nearly a century by the time Napoleon finished it off. The wars of the eighteenth century demonstrated that the Reich’s role as an instrument of settlement among German\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n3\n\nstates had been surpassed by the growing power of absolutist monarchies. The immense losses of western German states to the French Republic required a dramatic reorganization in the final imperial settlement of 1803. As part of this process, mediatization removed many territories from the control of churches and church-based institutions and annexed them instead to larger states. By Napoleon’s time, the Reich still functioned as an organizational framework for the small German states that could not afford their own diplomatic representation or in many cases even their own judiciaries. They depended on the institutions of the Reich, slow and complex as they might be. The most dramatic result of the Reich’s dissolution was the obvious change of leadership in Germany. Vienna ceded to Paris its centuries-old role as the interlocutor of German affairs and Napoleon wasted no time asserting French power in the German-speaking lands. In summer 1806, at virtually the same time that the Austrian emperor abdicated his role at the head of the vanishing Reich, Napoleon created the “Confederation of the Rhine.” This was an alliance of German states with France, asserting Napoleon’s right to command their armies and control their foreign policy. There was some historical precedent for this concept; Louis XIV had bound a number of west-German states to France in the “League of the Rhine” in the mid-seventeenth century. Napoleon’s creation was more immediately threatening to the European status quo because his France was larger and more powerful than its Bourbon predecessor, and because he was willing to impose dramatic political and geographic changes. The leaders of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria, for example, were all elevated (in the latter two cases to kings) and all received lands taken from Austria or other unfortunates. As “protector” of the Confederation, Napoleon was assured of French political, commercial, and military domination in Germany. In retrospect the most striking feature of Napoleon’s extraordinary victories in 1805 is the absence of Prussia, the state that had played such a dominant role in German affairs for the previous six decades. In the years since the death of Frederick the Great, the Prussian monarchy had been notable for a lack of focus and the absence of any clear foreign policy other than their opportunistic aggrandizement at the expense of Poland. Although local administration continued to function competently, the regime lacked firm direction. This state of affairs did not improve when Frederick William III succeeded his father in 1797. Although he was an honest man with a gentle temperament and a reputation for personal morality, the new king was a mediocre intellect and was easily paralyzed by difficult decisions. His most consistent policy was that peace was almost always preferable to war, a noble sentiment in the abstract but unsuited to leading a major military power in the midst of a severe crisis. Frederick William was persuaded to ally with Napoleonic France to acquire Hannover, the home of the British dynasty and under\n\n4\n\nChapter 1\n\nFrench occupation. This was at best a naive mistake because it placed him at war with one of Prussia’s traditional allies, the British, and angered the coalition that was forming against Napoleon and very badly wanted Prussia’s help. Had Napoleon’s 1805 campaign dragged on through the winter, it is likely that Prussia would have switched sides yet again and joined the Third Coalition. Infuriated by French violations of Prussia’s neutral borders, prodded by many members of his cabinet, his queen, his generals, the Russian Tsar, and likely by his own conscience, Frederick William III was clearly preparing for war when news came of Napoleon’s stunning victory at Austerlitz. The Prussians stood by as Austria surrendered and Russia withdrew to lick its wounds. But in early 1806, watching the Confederation of the Rhine taking shape and learning of Napoleon’s casual offer to “trade” Hannover back to Britain (presumably by taking it from its new Prussian owners) in return for peace, Frederick William had finally had enough. Prussia began mobilizing. The War of the Fourth Coalition was arguably Napoleon’s most spectacular triumph. In roughly two weeks his army outmaneuvered the confused and disordered Prussians, and on October 14 fought the twin battles of Jena and Auerstädt, about ten miles apart. By mid-afternoon, the Prussian army was shattered and fleeing in half a dozen directions. The Prussian royal family made a narrow escape, but they were now little better than refugees at the mercy of their Russian allies who were still in the fight against Napoleon. It is hard to overstate the importance of the year 1806 in German history. Any consideration of the Kingdom of Westphalia must begin at this point, with the cataclysmic defeat of northern Germany’s major power in autumn 1806 and the resulting ascendancy of Napoleonic France over the Germanspeaking lands. Our story begins in the midst of this conflict, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers in motion across central Europe, and with millions of Germans uncertain of their fate. BEFORE THERE WERE WESTPHALIANS No one has ever convincingly explained why Napoleon chose the name “Westphalia” for the new state he created in northwestern Germany in 1807. The old “Duchy of Westphalia” dating from the twelfth century was primarily in the Ruhr and overlapped no more than one-fifth of the territory of what would become the future Kingdom of Westphalia. In any event it had been a dependency of the Archdiocese of Cologne. No independent state had ever borne the name. Not surprisingly, “misunderstandings and false assumptions were implicit” among the people who were soon to be called “Westphalians.” 2 It was as if a foreign power had conquered the United States and\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n5\n\ncombined portions of New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania into a new entity called “The Kingdom of Chesapeake.” The huge majority of what became Westphalia came from four sovereign states. About one-third of the two million future Westphalians were originally Prussians, and more still came from areas that had been recently mediatized to Prussia, making them the largest proportion of Westphalia’s future population by former nationality. The Kingdom of Prussia sprawled across northern Germany, from the Rhineland and North Sea coast to present-day Lithuania. Because it had grown irregularly through a combination of marriage, conquest, and inheritance, Prussia had never truly centralized or systematized its regional or local administrative methods. There was considerable variation from region to region. Most Prussians lived in small rural villages governed by an appointed Magistrat. In many farming communities the hamlets were spread too far apart for anything like a “town” administration, and thus, the people dealt with a “Richter” or “Schulze,” a sort of constable-ombudsman who reported to a mayor in some nearby larger town. For most peasant farmers, however, the local aristocrats were the most important authorities. Although most peasants rented from the landlords, they were typically not serfs. Feudal labor was generally done only by the very poor, as a form of payment for the limited assistance that they received. 3 Nonetheless the inhabitants were restricted by archaic laws and traditions that limited their economic options. In many cases they could not change farming methods or crops without the local lord’s permission. Since the days of Frederick the Great, Prussian subjects had the right to complain, often in formal and challenging ways, about quotidian issues affecting their lives. For example, conscription practices were often perceived as unfair by this or that community, with the result that a meeting was held and a formal petition of grievance drawn up. 4 The remedies for their grievances, however, were usually not systematic. People still thought in local terms, in which some appeal directly to a higher authority would result in a bargain being struck or a special compensation being offered, for example a lessening of some other burden or a grant of some other privilege. As long as their grievance was addressed in some way, the people usually did not care that it was unusual or idiosyncratic or might have to be renegotiated in a few years. They typically sought redress for immediate concerns and a prompt return to stability. Of all the foreign powers they could be frightened of in 1800, the Prussians were most worried by Napoleonic France. The Kabinett returned again and again to the feasibility of a French alliance as a means of protecting themselves from a Napoleonic invasion. That year the question of Hannover loomed large and appeared to offer a solution. 5\n\n6\n\nChapter 1\n\nHannover was an electorate of the Reich and the ancestral homeland of the British monarchy, ruled in personal union by the kings of Great Britain. It was so vulnerable to French invasion that the British had no hope of defending it without Prussian help, meaning a Prussian entry into the war on Britain’s side. Instead the Prussians entered in 1800, with French and Russian approval, thinking they had made a safe decision to remain neutral and act as the guardians of this region, perhaps to present the British with fait accompli and some sort of Prussian union thereafter. The result was a disastrous undeclared war with Britain that promptly shut down Prussian commerce and caused Prussia’s embarrassed withdrawal from Hannover in November 1801. The population of Hannover before the wars had been just under one million. It was a relatively wealthy agricultural economy with no large cities, whose army had been in British service for a century. Hannover’s government was in many ways more directly attached to the people than the Westphalian regime that would replace it. Seventeen departments reported to a privy council, which interacted with the elector, who also dealt personally with representatives from the churches, the aristocratic domains, the army, and the few large towns. A person with a grievance about the postal system, for example, could directly approach the postal director, who in turn reported directly to the privy council. 6 There were no subprefects, prefects, or ministries in the way. Hannover did not practice serfdom per se, because even the poorest renting farmer was defined by the law as being personally free. But there were a number of old regime obligations that tied people to their property and class, and these had evolved over decades and were quite idiosyncratic. For example, if a farmer fed his animals with hay from an aristocrat’s land, the farmer’s children were obligated to work for a certain number of days as domestic servants to that aristocrat’s family, and failing that, the aristocrat could repossess some portion of the animals in question. 7 In June 1803 a French army of occupation under Marshal Édouard Mortier arrived and stayed for more than two years. The Prussian occupation had been “a limited grievance compared with the French.” 8 Plunder and extortion were considerable. The French quartered their soldiers in local homes, confiscated thousands of horses and huge supplies of food, and demanded massive “contributions” in cash from the Hannoverians. In Osnabrück General Jean-Baptiste Drouet D’Erlon’s requirement for his so-called table money earned him 250 marks each day, and he “acquired” eight horses. 9 General Jean Rapp extorted a personal “gratification” of 100,000 francs, claiming that it was the only way to prevent a larger contribution to Napoleon. General Gabriel Barbou, commanding the garrison at the little fortress of Hameln, claimed that Napoleon had ordered him to collect 1.2 million francs from the locals, but would negotiate on their behalf if they found 100,000 for him\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n7\n\npersonally. After collecting his bribe, he apparently helped persuade Napoleon to lower the demand to 800,000. 10 In October 1805 the Prussians returned to Hannover as part of their treaty agreement with Napoleon. This came as a surprise to most Hanoverians, but it presaged some relief. After more than two years of French occupation the Hannoverians were desperate. There was a serious food shortage. Hundreds of young men had fled to join the various “legions” of exiled soldiers in British or Russian service. The French war contributions had tripled since the initial invasion. 11 Ludwig von Ompteda recalled that the Prussian period brought “relief from the extensive and arbitrary oppression” of the French, but it brought no economic recovery because the blockade remained in effect. 12 Compared to the ravenous French, the Prussians were a bargain. They kept their troops out of the largest cities and their military administration required only 45,000 Thaler, most of which went to local salaries for their new military bureaucracy. 13 Nonetheless people resented the heavy-handed way in which the Prussians changed the laws with total disregard for the previous experience of local administrators. 14 Prussian customs agents went on confiscating British goods, just as the French had. 15 The Prussians nonetheless paid off the local debts of the administration and put the finances in order. The Hannoverians had reason to hope that some return to normalcy was in the offing. Those hopes lasted exactly one year. When Prussia reoccupied Hannover in autumn 1805, their forces were commanded by Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, the Duke of Brunswick. Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel was a small duchy, splattered across seventy miles of north-central Germany, divided into more than a dozen enclaves, inhabited by just over a quarter million people. With more than two-thirds of its land owned by small family farms and relatively little by aristocrats, it is fair to say that the duchy was a solidly middle-class, quiet, comfortable, and boring place. 16 Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand became Duke of Brunswick in 1773. He had been well-prepared for his job with a variety of military and administrative experiences. Although he had once shocked local society by separating from his wife and keeping a mistress (with whom he lived happily for the next three decades), the duke was generally regarded as a man of solid morals. He was personally humble, thoughtful, and had good taste without affect or ostentation. During his long reign, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand balanced the budget and paid off the state’s debt. That enabled him to reduce taxes substantially below those of most German states. 17 The duke’s views on politics and society were generally liberal. He kept his troops barracked outside the towns and thus resisted the urge to use or show force, much less to impose it on his civilian population. 18 He was persuaded to eliminate punitive taxes on mi-\n\n8\n\nChapter 1\n\nnorities (Jews, for instance, paid no special fees). And he was patient, even indulgent, with his Landstände, the representatives of the estates. Although they were supposed to meet only when called by the duke, on two occasions during his reign they summoned themselves into session to oppose one of his decisions. He reacted by hearing them out and then brokering a compromise. It is impossible to imagine such a scenario in Napoleonic France. 19 Most people who worked for Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand came to love him. Kurt von Raumer called him “the most beloved prince in Germany.” 20 The old man’s sincerity, honesty, and modesty endeared him to subordinates, and thus little Braunschweig attracted more than its share of scholars and civil servants with impressive pedigrees. Although he was obviously past his prime as a military commander, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand increasingly found himself called on by his Prussian allies to command large armies. His performance in the campaigns of 1792–1793 was mediocre. The Prussians nonetheless considered this outsider to be a unifying figure, an indication of how toxic and confused Prussia’s own high command had become. In autumn 1806, at the age of seventy-one, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand tried unsuccessfully to turn down yet another offer from the Prussian king to command his armies. Out of respect for the king’s wishes he finally agreed, but it was to be a personal decision only. The Duchy of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel would remain neutral; only the duke would go to Berlin to take command. He naively thought—in the event things went badly—that Napoleon would respect that distinction and leave his land and people alone. If the Braunschweigers had some hope that they might remain neutral despite the personal involvement of their duke in the War of the Fourth Coalition, the people of Hessen-Kassel felt certain that both their ruler and state were staying out of the fight. This did not please all of them, to be sure, but at least it was clear and well-defined. What are often referred to in English as the “Hessian Duchies” comprised several small states and two mid-sized landgravates. Hessen-Kassel was the northernmost and largest of these, the other being Hessen-Darmstadt. The state encompassed an area whose beauty is hard to exaggerate. The land rolls with hills and green mountains, is covered in thick forests, and is ornamented by little riverside villages built around medieval churches. It is the fairy-tale Germany immortalized by the Brothers Grimm, who spent their youths and young adulthoods in the region before taking jobs nearby at the great Hannoverian university of Göttingen. This was a limited economy with little in the way of financial activity or outside investment. Although the forests and mines were productive, Hessian farms were relatively inefficient. Most of the agriculture was consumed by the locals; very little was exported. The poor roads and rocky rivers would not have sustained a major export trade in any event. The guilds sought to\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n9\n\nprotect their members and thus enforced restrictive and conservative regulations. As the eighteenth century ended, the Hessians also suffered from what we would today call “brain drain.” The Brothers Grimm were not the only bright local boys who attended the fine University of Marburg so that they could leave and take better-paying jobs elsewhere. 21 Unlike nearby HessenDarmstadt, the state did not secularize or exert control over church lands and their essentially autonomous economies, judiciaries, and education systems. 22 Of the four major components of the future Kingdom of Westphalia, Hessen-Kassel was certainly the most traditional, the most firmly rooted in the old regime. Like the Brunswickers, the Hessians had been active in the controversial Soldatenhandel, the renting of entire regiments of German mercenaries to the service of foreign powers. This paid well but was unpopular. Some rulers who practiced the Soldatenhandel therefore sought to tamp down any legal objections by using that revenue to lower taxes on their people, as Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand did in Braunschweig. In Hessen-Kassel, the Soldatenhandel meant that a small state with a population of only half a million could support an abnormally large and experienced army of 20,000 men with veteran officers and noncommissioned officers. In the imperial settlement of 1803 Hessen-Kassel was expanded and elevated to an electorate, and its ruling Landgraf Wilhelm IX became the Kurfürst (electoral prince) Wilhelm I. Kurfürst Wilhelm was a tall, thin, severe man. He was an ur-conservative who “rarely missed the opportunity” to criticize Jacobins and revolutionaries. 23 The Kurfürst took his role as a traditional prince and patriarch seriously, to the point of humorlessness. Wilhelm was remarkably successful at squirrelling away most of the money he had made in the Soldatenhandel. His own lifestyle was spartan by the standards of his rank and era. His “palace” in Kassel was small, inexpensively decorated, and did not see much in the way of entertainment. Behind the scenes the parsimonious Wilhelm worked with a team of investors and the Rothschild family to conceal most of his wealth from his people and later from Napoleon. The Kurfürst and his advisors nervously watched Franco-Prussian relations deteriorate throughout 1806. They were courted by both sides. A Prussian alliance would have been more traditional—the last had been in 1792— but strategically very risky. Prussia would not guarantee to fight so far to the west of her own heartland that the Hessians could have been protected from French invasion. When France’s Ambassador Bignon offered an alliance, Wilhelm did consider this but made a decision in keeping with his basically stingy mentality: he was afraid that being a French ally would be too expensive. He observed that Napoleon’s German allies were being drained of men and resources, “and seeing his money flow into French pockets did not appeal to him.” 24\n\n10\n\nChapter 1\n\nWilhelm had been critical of France’s new emperor and his foreign policy was understood to be generally pro-Prussian. Nonetheless he was determined to stay neutral. That was easier said than done. Major Prussian fortresses were nearby, as was the huge French depot and garrison at Mainz. It was very likely that one or both sides would cross Hessian territory in the event of a French-Prussian war. The Prussians had in fact raised the issue of preexisting treaties that permitted their troops to do precisely that, but Wilhelm remained unwilling to declare whether he believed those treaties still to be in effect. As late as October 1806 he still believed that he would be the one to have the final say on that matter. NOTHING BUT FRENCH AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE In autumn 1806, officers of the Hessian Leib-Dragoon regiment began hearing excited rumors that they were about to join the Prussians in the war against Napoleon. The rumors were false; they were the result of the passage of General Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher’s Prussian corps across northern Hessian territory at the start of the war. Blücher’s passage was necessary because the fragmented Prussian territories were interrupted by the odd borders of several smaller German states. Any reasonably straight line between Prussia’s garrisons in Paderborn and Magdeburg crossed Hessian or Braunschweig territory. Nonetheless Kurfürst Wilhelm reacted angrily, sending a courier to try to catch Blücher and turn him around. By the time that letter arrived at the border, Blücher’s force was already gone, so Wilhelm fired off a terse warning to Berlin not to repeat the violation. He then declared “armed neutrality” and mobilized part of his army as a defensive measure. 25 It is not clear precisely when Napoleon decided to invade Hessen-Kassel and Braunschweig. According to Otto von Malsburg, the Hessian ambassador in Paris who later served Jerome, Napoleon’s youngest brother, in Westphalia, Talleyrand hinted as early as September 10 that Napoleon was coming, whether the Hessians were neutral or not. 26 On September 21, Napoleon wrote to Louis Pierre Édouard, baron Bignon, the French ambassador in Kassel, asking for a list of all Hessian units, their strengths, and locations, as well as “the most precise maps you can possibly obtain” of the region. 27 The next day Napoleon wrote to his brother Louis, the king of Holland, who had been assembling a corps of Dutch and French units for the past two weeks, in preparation for action against Prussia’s northwestern outposts. For the first time in their correspondence Napoleon specifically mentioned “Kassel” as a possible destination, “depending upon events.” 28 Napoleon likely made up his mind at some point in September that in his coming war with Prussia he would take the opportunity to eliminate those\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n11\n\nsmall German states like Hessen-Kassel and Braunschweig whose loyalties he considered suspect. He nonetheless continued to affect a respect for their neutrality, even while assembling forces and making preparations for their destruction. He radiated conflicting messages to keep the issue in doubt. On September 24, Bignon reassured the Kurfürst Wilhelm that his neutrality would be respected. 29 On October 1, Napoleon assured Dalberg, his chosen “prince primate” of the Confederation of the Rhine, that “I would be very glad to spare that impoverished land the horrors of war. . . . In fact, I have no reason to complain about Kassel. I will never attack it of my own accord.” (Je ne l’attaquerai jamais de mon plein gré.) 30 The same day that he assured the Confederation of the Rhine that he would never invade a neutral Hessen-Kassel, Napoleon ordered Mortier to take command of the newly assembling VIII Corps of the Grande Armée and bring it to Frankfurt. Mortier’s force was an amalgamation of diverse units, including national guardsmen from the eastern (German-speaking) departments of France, plus several battalions of Italian infantry and German units from the Confederation. Mortier’s orders instructed him to cooperate with Louis Bonaparte’s Dutch-French forces to the north. 31 Between them lay the electorate of Hessen-Kassel. Napoleon’s victorious campaign against the Prussians unfolded with a speed that probably surprised even him. On October 16, two days after he mauled the Prussians at Jena-Auerstädt, Napoleon ordered Mortier’s and Louis’s men to begin the conquest of Hessen-Kassel, keeping a cautious eye on any remaining Prussian forces that might still be in the vicinity. 32 There was no question in French minds that Hessen-Kassel was neutral. Mortier wrote to Louis on October 17 to discuss their strategy, including the phrase, “If Hessen continues in their neutrality . . . my position will not be difficult.” 33 Napoleon intended Mortier to play the main role in subduing the electorate. VIII Corps would march from Fulda to Kassel, almost perfectly north for sixty-seven miles. When he got to Kassel, Mortier’s orders required him to take Kurfürst Wilhelm prisoner and to act as the new military governor. All Hessian officers above the rank of lieutenant were to be arrested. Napoleon wrote: “My intention is that the house of Hessen-Kassel is to be removed from the map.” 34 Lieutenant Ludwig Boedicker of the 1st light infantry battalion was on duty near Hessen-Kassel’s southern border and was thus one of the first people to report the invasion. To his horror, “few people believed me . . . they thought I must have misunderstood.” 35 Most units simply remained in their barracks. Johann Philipp Bauer, a second lieutenant in the Erbprinz regiment, recalled that they were baffled by the lack of intelligence and the absence of orders from above. By the time Bauer’s colonel sent him to Kassel to figure out what was happening, it was too late; he found the capital full of Frenchmen. A Hessian general told him to ride back to his garrison at\n\n12\n\nChapter 1\n\nEschwege and inform his regiment that they were to disarm. Bauer’s men were despondent and furious. 36 Friedrich Baumann, a Standartenjunker in the Landgraf Friedrich dragoon regiment, recalled that his regiment was hastily ordered out of their barracks and moved to Kassel in great confusion and disorder. When they arrived they were astonished to learn that they were being demobilized; the French were already there. Men were furious and broke their weapons rather than surrendering them. 37 Mortier’s men required only five days to cover the distance to Kassel. During that time the Hessians did little more than ask questions. Some units were overrun in their garrisons. The Kurfürst seemed paralyzed by the thought of futile bloodshed, knowing that with Prussia’s defeat his situation was hopeless. For at least two days he held out hope that the French might simply be passing through. This was a deliberate deception encouraged by Napoleon. On October 29 when he reached Melsungen, Mortier issued a proclamation that was simply acting under Napoleon’s orders to pass through en route to Hannover. 38 When a civilian delegation reached Mortier to ask what he wanted, the marshal replied coyly that he could not “mix military and diplomatic issues.” From the other invading column under Louis came a declaration that the Kurfürst, as a neutral prince, had nothing to fear. 39 On October 31, the Kurfürst dispatched Colonel Adam Ludwig von Ochs to meet with Mortier and make a formal protest. Ochs rode south and discovered that Mortier’s men were only half a day’s march from Kassel. The French tried to capture Ochs, but he made a narrow escape and rode back to Kassel to warn the Kurfürst. Wilhelm finally packed and fled his capital. He would not see it again for more than seven years. Given the Kurfürst’s personal priorities, it is not surprising that much of the Hessian treasury was ready to escape with him. 40 On the following morning as French troops entered Kassel, the leaderless Hessian units began to surrender. 41 Mortier issued a grandiose proclamation to the Hessians. “I have come to occupy your land,” he began, “to spare [you] from the horrors of war” and to avenge the Hessians for the “violation of your territory by the Prussians.” The following sentence, however, accused the Hessians of having been Prussian allies. In an ironic foreshadowing of what was to come in Westphalia, Mortier scolded the Hessians for their alleged alliance with Berlin: “The worth of a sovereign is incompatible with service to a foreign power.” He promised that all local religions, laws, customs, and privileges would be respected, and that “you have nothing to expect but improvements!” 42 Louis’s troops began to arrive by the evening, in time to be quartered on the residents and join in the plundering of the city. It was the first time in nearly a century that the Kasselers had been forced to quarter soldiers. 43\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n13\n\nNapoleon’s twenty-seventh Bulletin of the Grande Armée, published three days later, justified this unprovoked attack on a neutral state. Napoleon’s Bulletins were generally the abridged version of his propaganda and typically hyperbolic. Although they were understood often to contain falsehoods, nonetheless they represented his regime’s official position. In this release he referred to the Kurfürst as a “marshal in the service of Prussia,” and accused him of having mobilized his army to assist the Prussians prior to the battles of Jena-Auerstädt. This was of course untrue; Napoleon knew very well from Mortier’s reports that the Hessians had ordered a defensive partial mobilization while simultaneously declaring neutrality. The French emperor also claimed that the Prussians had violated Hessian neutrality. He did not explain how—if the Hessians and Prussians were allied, as he claimed—the Prussian movement would have been a “violation.” He claimed that Wilhelm, “was happy to march at the head of the Prussians and insult the French with all kinds of provocations. There is not a dynasty in Germany that has been a more consistent enemy of France.” Napoleon added several sentences of accusations that the English were somehow involved with their “corruptions.” The Bulletin was not simply a condemnation. It also contained a promise: “The inhabitants of Hessen-Kassel will be happier than before.” As he acknowledged the dissolution of Hannover, Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, and Hessen-Kassel, Napoleon promised that something new and better would replace them, and that the people would soon enjoy the same enlightened government that the French enjoyed. Although there was yet no specific mention of a coming Kingdom of Westphalia, it is the first indication that Napoleon had already made up his mind to create some sort of satellite in north-central Germany. By the end of the first week of November, all of Hessen-Kassel was under French control. Louis’s troops departed after only two days in the capital. Mortier moved on toward Hamburg with part of his corps, leaving behind a single division of French and Italian troops under General Joseph Lagrange. 44 Napoleon ordered him to begin collecting all weapons from the civilian population and to destroy Hessian military fortifications. Lagrange established his headquarters in the residence of the Kurfürst and began the difficult job of establishing French martial law with a garrison force of roughly eight thousand men, in the midst of a half-million angry people. PLUNDER The early months of 1806 were very mild and the spring was wet. It had been an excellent planting season. 45 People in northern and central Germany had every reason to expect a prosperous year. Instead, by the end of 1806 the\n\n14\n\nChapter 1\n\nregion was a disaster. In depopulated villages civilian militias and bandits fought battles in the absence of government authority. In those villages where the French stationed troops, the occupiers took virtually everything of value. In Magdeburg the birthrate was 30 percent lower than the death rate. In some parts of the Altmark it was 50 percent lower. 46 Scharnhorst, who traveled across this grim landscape in January 1807, wrote of a “wasteland” that reminded him of the Thirty Years’ War: “The villages are full of the wounded, half- or completely starved . . . the crisis means that everyone does whatever he wants.” 47 Only a fraction of the prewar livestock remained, towns were devastated by epidemics of typhus, dysentery, and cholera while food prices soared, and Berlin’s infant mortality rate would soon reach a staggering 75 percent. 48 French soldiers raped so many women that many disguised themselves as men. Lulu Brentano-Jordis, daughter of the large and prestigious Brentano family, obtained one such disguise that worked perfectly and protected her as she traveled from Frankfurt to Berlin in the early weeks of 1807. Other women were not as fortunate. 49 On October 20, 1806, French infantry passed through Halberstadt in pursuit of the retreating Prussians. The French stayed long enough to plunder the town thoroughly. Virtually every building was ransacked, their contents dragged out into the streets to be sorted and hauled away. Private possessions from homes were piled up in the churches. When Marshal Michel Ney arrived, the town’s officials sent a deputation to him to beg for an end to the plunder. He responded by giving them a bill for 100,000 francs, explained as the cost of supplying his men. 50 Six weeks later orders from Napoleon arrived, setting Halberstadt’s “war contribution” at 520,000 francs: roughly 170 francs per family, more than a typical middle-class family’s monthly income. 51 About twelve thousand French soldiers entered Hannover on November 9, 1806. These were Mortier’s men, moving on from their conquest of Hessen-Kassel. The region had been occupied by the French on and off for several years already and the people knew what to expect. Ludwig von Ompteda estimated that the resulting confiscations of private property, called at the time a “war tax,” amounted to nearly 30 million francs. 52 That December Napoleon set Hannover’s new contribution at 9.1 million francs, plus an additional 1.2 million monthly to pay for the provisioning of his troops. 53 For the average resident this represented a tax increase of approximately 90 percent. Confiscation of weapons was a high priority under French occupation. Napoleon instructed General Lagrange in Kassel to “disarm the region completely, there shall not be one cannon, not one musket.” 54 In Halberstadt the annual Schützenfest had to be canceled because no one had their guns anymore. 55 These confiscations often resulted in violence. Men naturally wanted to keep their weapons for hunting but also to protect their families, particu-\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n15\n\nlarly given the high incidence of rape. In Halberstadt and Schmalkalden men were hanged for attacking French soldiers who were seizing their weapons. Reprisals against those who tried to take back goods or “plunder” the French were often swift and merciless because only the occupiers were armed. Word spread quickly of what had happened in the little Thuringian town of Wetzdorf, where several men tried to grab goods from a French wagon, claiming that they were taking back things that had been stolen from them. In the ensuing brawl a French soldier was killed. Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout ordered the execution of every man of military age in the town, “as an example to rebels.” 56 The quartering of soldiers on the civilians, common in European wars of the eighteenth century, became one of the foremost grievances in northern Germany in 1806–1807. Aside from the fear of sexual assault and the routine thefts, civilians worried about the spread of disease. One man complained to the authorities that “they [soldiers] mistreat the farmers, householders, and animals,” and that the troops demanded bread, liquor, and meat. The numbers were often staggering. In Schmalkalden there was, on average, four soldiers in each home at any given point from 1807 to the fall of Westphalia in 1813. 57 In the first two years of their occupation, Münster, a city of roughly 16,000, quartered, stabled, and fed more than eighty-five thousand French soldiers and thirteen thousand horses and had to pay for the privilege of doing so. 58 In Melsungen, a pretty little Hessian town with fewer than twenty-five hundred people, the French garrison was nearly as large as the population and had to be paid by them as well as supplied. 59 Plundering was officially discouraged or denied, even though it was rarely prevented. But anything that could be defined as “English goods” was fair game for confiscation, whether it was in fact from England or not. This was naturally open to abuse and cynicism, as in Helmstedt, where the French found that all the horses they needed were suddenly “English.” 60 In Paderborn, where the new French governor congratulated the locals for their liberation “from the Prussian yoke,” the troops quartered on the citizens assisted in confiscating the English goods, which typically meant coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco, and other luxury items, but also basics like paper and ink, cloth, and leather. In the midst of the confiscations came Napoleon’s announcement that Paderborn’s contribution had been set at 225,000 francs, which worked out to a month’s income for the average family. 61 The prolific historian Christoph Rommel, who was in his twenties at the time, was the first to record something that soon became a commonplace recollection. Whatever grievances and complaints people had against their former German rulers—and these might have been significant—paled in comparison to the experience of French martial law. Soon the period before 1806 began to shine in their selective memories as “good old days” that had been taken from them. 62 This sentiment persisted in the years to come, as the\n\n16\n\nChapter 1\n\nfuture Westphalian regime struggled to win popular support. The experience of crisis had been simply too jarring, too painful, to be forgotten or in some cases forgiven. I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF BRUNSWICK On November 8, 1806, the new French “Interim Assistant Commissioner for War” arrived in Braunschweig. He was a twenty-four-year-old lieutenant of dragoons named Henri Beyle who had received this unchallenging post far from danger mainly because of his personal attachment to Pierre Daru, intendant-general of Napoleon’s Grande Armée. Excitable, imaginative, gregarious, and absolutely obsessed with women, young Beyle did not have a great many duties to fill his days. He took inventory of things that the French might need to confiscate from the region: horses, carriages, various sorts of supplies. 63 He spent much of his time flirting with local ladies and trying to find ways to amuse himself in the sleepy provincial city. Within a few weeks, after visiting a nearby town, he chose the pen name that the world would remember: Stendhal. The young Frenchman made an unlikely friendship with Friedrich Karl von Strombeck, scion of an old Braunschweig patrician family and twelve years his senior. Strombeck was already an accomplished lawyer and legal scholar, a poetry enthusiast fluent in four languages who had married into Hannoverian aristocracy. Instead of becoming a professor as he wished, he did what his family expected of him: he joined the administration of the Duke of Brunswick. Strombeck had divided his time between studying the duke’s finances (a job that bored him), and managing the estate of the Abbey of Gandersheim for the elderly Abbess who was like a second mother to him. It was not unheard of for French officers to strike up friendships with the local Germans they had just conquered. Such cases usually had some masonic connection. Braunschweig’s largest masonic lodge hosted their French brothers in a ceremony in early November 1806. Similar events took place in Salzwedel and Kassel. 64 Strombeck and Stendhal were an unlikely pair. Strombeck was a worldly man who was willing to think beyond the limitations of the society in which he had moved up to that point. Stendhal, despite wearing the uniform of the occupier, was too good humored and affectionate for anybody to resent him personally. The two spent a lot of time together, each observing the same process from opposite perspectives. 65 “I’ve had enough of Brunswick,” a bored and frustrated Stendhal wrote in his diary on July 4, 1807. Nonetheless he stayed for another year, long enough to see this town become the second-largest city of the new Kingdom of Westphalia. His friend Strombeck published a German-language guide to French law and went on to hold a variety of increasingly important jobs for\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n17\n\nWestphalia’s government: as a judge, a member of the national assembly (the Reichsstände), president of the district appeals court, and eventually member of the king’s state council. Reading Stendhal’s diary from his two years in Braunschweig, one does not get the impression that he was moving through a landscape that had been devastated by war. Yet Braunschweig had been so thoroughly plundered that as late as 1808 Johann Samuel Ersch’s Handbuch über das Königreich Westphalen mentioned that Westphalia’s second-largest city had until very recently been a wealthy place with impressive homes, art collections, and museums, unfortunately lost “during the recent war.” 66 On October 16, 1806, a captain on the Duke of Brunswick’s staff arrived in the city bringing news of the disaster at Jena-Auerstädt. In addition to the catastrophic defeat of the Prussian army, the duke himself had been gravely wounded, shot through both eyes. The city was gripped by fear and uncertainty. Five days later the blind, dying duke returned to his capital for the last time. He dictated a few changes to his will, including a surprising choice for his successor: his youngest son, Frederick William. He took the hand of Gustav Anton von Wolffradt, gave him the power to dispense the treasury as he saw fit, and asked him to preserve his papers for posterity. When the duke removed his hand, Wolffradt broke down weeping and had to excuse himself. When he returned the duke took his hand again and said, “Dear friend, don’t worry for me. It’s all over for me. Stay here in my land. Would you do that? Promise me.” Wolffradt promised. “All right,” the duke said, “now I am happy.” 67 The mortally wounded duke was carried outside the palace on a litter as people gathered on the plaza to see him. Gottfried Phillipp von Bülow, who had served the duke as a page at the age of thirteen, was among them and recalled the high emotion and the sense of catastrophe. 68 The duke left in a carriage, north toward Hamburg without any plan other than to avoid capture. That dignified old man suffered through another two weeks, dying on November 10. In his tenth Bulletin on October 18, Napoleon announced the death of the Duke of Brunswick, but he obviously knew this to be a lie because he ordered cavalry units to the city to take the duke alive and transport him as a prisoner to France. These men initially refrained from plunder but ordered all symbols of the House of Welfen, Braunschweig’s ruling dynasty, to be removed. Wolffradt, head of the provisional regency government, was confronted by a Colonel Barthelemy who demanded to know where the duke was. Wolffradt tried to give as little information as possible, admitting only that the duke was heading north. “It’s a pity I didn’t have the pleasure of meeting him,” Barthelemy said. “I have good news from the Emperor to bring him.” Wolffradt chose not to reply. When he returned home he found\n\n18\n\nChapter 1\n\nhis house already occupied by French soldiers and his wife hastily preparing dinner for them. 69 Napoleon wasted no time erasing the Duchy of BraunschweigWolfenbüttel from the map. In two proclamations (October 28 and 30) he deposed the Welfens and announced a French occupation government. Within two weeks he had set Braunschweig’s contribution at a staggering 5.625 million francs, to be paid before the year’s end, only six weeks hence. 70 The sum was of course impossible to find, and no creditors were willing to fund the debts of a now-deposed regime, so it had to be imposed on the people with a special tax. Whatever could not be paid in cash was to be taken in goods and property. The city’s attitude toward the French never recovered from this episode. The French commanders were angry to learn that the Welfens had evacuated most of the state treasury when they fled, but the occupiers did a thorough job of plundering Braunschweig and Wolfenbüttel. People’s experiences varied. A regiment of French hussars quickly made themselves hated by “running wild” but other units behaved “better than expected.” 71 Citizens were assured that they had the right to “arrest marauding soldiers,” but there was no indication of how they might do so when all their weapons had been confiscated. 72 In any event there was no need for the soldiers to maraud; they were already quartered in the people’s homes and could take what they pleased. At some point in mid-November (accounts differ), Napoleon’s appointed governor arrived and installed himself in the duke’s residence. This was General Baptiste-Pierre Bisson, an immense man who acquired the nickname “the swine” for his alcoholism, his crass advances on women, his orders placing the prettiest actresses of the state theater under his personal “protection,” and for his receptions to which local dignitaries were invited, only to realize that they were being served with their own confiscated plates and silverware. 73 Bisson and other French officers (including for a time Pierre Daru, Stendhal’s mentor and chief) paid visits to the better homes, churches, and public buildings, leaving with valuables for their personal collections. 74 Bisson lasted until February 1807, at which point he was replaced with the more businesslike General Olivier Rivaud de la Raffinière. Daru was also active in the plunder of art and culture from the region’s homes and galleries. Napoleon had given that job to Vivant Denon, who catalogued the art in Braunschweig to bring the better pieces to France. Denon, Napoleon’s director of museums, had done this for Napoleon a number of times, having confiscated art and other valuables from Egypt, the Low Countries, and Italy. Many items were taken to the Musée Napoléon (the Louvre) but others ended up in Denon’s private collection. 75 A man named Rewel had a similar job in Kassel, not limited to art but also the better furniture, statuary, and other decorations. 76 Daru apparently took a great deal\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n19\n\nfor himself, probably for subsequent sale: two thousand volumes from the duke’s library in Wolfenbüttel, ninety-one masterworks (mostly Dutch Renaissance), and other objects from the gallery in the Schloss Salzdahlum. Some of these items ended up in Jerome Bonaparte’s future residence in Kassel. 77 RESTORE THESE PEOPLE TO THEIR SENSES To modern sensibilities it is surprising that Napoleon expected to recruit local soldiers immediately from those neutral states he had just invaded, plundered, and erased from the map. Although he expended considerable effort and resources in the maintenance of French patriotism and national identity, he nonetheless knew that soldiers needed food and an income more than they needed loyalty to any particular master. The French had little success recruiting the officers and soldiers of Braunschweig. A “Brunswick Legion” was proposed, but it attracted only five officers and fewer than forty men. 78 Napoleon expected more success in Hessen-Kassel. Johann Philipp Bauer recalled that his regiment had just been disarmed and not yet disbanded when the offer was made to enter French service. It set off an angry debate among his fellow officers over whether it was acceptable to serve the enemy to have an income and feed one’s family, or whether honor demanded one’s unemployment and poverty. 79 For Ludwig Wilhelm von Conrady the choice seemed to have been made for him. The French took his horse, his weapons, even his uniform. More pressingly, they had arrested more than one hundred of his fellow officers, and the only way to avoid being hauled off to a French prison was to enlist in one of the proposed two new Franco-Hessian regiments. 80 He did so with some “tears,” but “at least I had the comfort of staying amongst my countrymen.” 81 Conrady’s regiment was badly understrength, never amounting to more than 370 men. The French did not trust them and refused to give them weapons. This resulted in them being heckled by the locals when they marched past, who taunted that they were prisoners rather than soldiers. When Conrady’s unit marched through Marburg, the townsfolk helped many of them desert. 82 Although the Franco-Hessian regiments were a failure, they nonetheless contained several men who went on to Westphalian service, often with high rank, who survived to write memoirs. 83 Just before Christmas 1806, a revolt broke out in several Hessian towns and soon spread through the region. The aggregate causes of the uprising were predictable: French looting, the confiscation of weapons, the martial law, and forced contributions. The proximate cause seems to have been the attempt to conscript soldiers for the new Franco-Hessian regiments. The majority of the rebels, at least initially, were former Hessian soldiers, some\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\nof whom had managed to conceal their weapons or escape from the French entirely in November. Christmas Day was the deadline that General Lagrange, military governor of Hessen-Kassel, had set for all remaining Hessian soldiers to turn themselves in or be hanged. 84 The rebels were largely enlisted men because the huge majority of Hessian officers were in French prisons, except for those few who had joined the new regiments. It is unclear how they organized and communicated, but between December 23 and 27, a variety of rebel groups appeared in almost every part of Hessen-Kassel. A sergeant named Schumann led a group that took control of Eschwege. Another group stormed the Kassel armory and took weapons and ammunition. In Schmalkalden the revolt broke out on Christmas night as local farmers overran the small garrison and captured thirteen cannon along with those soldiers who did not flee. A sergeant named Triebfürst led a group in a failed attempt to take the fortress of Ziegenhahn, then departed for the woods. On December 27, a mob of civilians in Brotterode surrounded and disarmed the French column that had just arrived. The next day a revolt led by a baker in Marburg overran the small French garrison and took control of the fortress. 85 In Hersfeld the terrified garrison managed to persuade the mob to spare them, using the argument that they were Italian soldiers and thus also unwilling conscripts for Napoleon. One soldier was killed and the rebels took their weapons, horses, and equipment but let the rest of the men go unharmed. 86 At its height in mid-winter the Hessian uprising involved anywhere from fifteen to twenty thousand active participants. 87 With no ranks higher than a captain, the men elected their own new officers but they were never able to organize large units, much less to supply them. They had no plan or goal other than an irrational hope that the Kurfürst might return and lead them. One group apparently planned to capture Lagrange and ransom him in return for Napoleon meeting their demands. 88 In their anger and desperation they began to turn against their own people. Several collaborators were killed, including men who had just volunteered for the new Franco-Hessian regiments. By January, they began to requisition supplies from the local towns, which turned sympathies against them. Many groups simply became lawless bandits. Ludwig Wilhelm von Conrady, who initially sympathized with the rebels and felt some shame that he had joined the other side, by January had become disgusted by their excesses. Lagrange’s garrison of about eight thousand men, mostly French and Italian conscripts with little combat experience, was obviously insufficient to pacify a large area with a widespread uprising. Napoleon began sending reinforcements. Lagrange’s initial response was a model of patience and intelligence. He secured the major cities where the people quickly turned against the rebels and sought safety from the violence. He repeatedly appealed to local people to turn in rebels or at least to talk to members of their\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n21\n\nfamilies who might support the rebels, “to restore these people to their senses.” And he waited for enough reinforcements so that when he moved, he could do so decisively. Flying columns of French and Italian mounted troops then entered towns, arrested local rebel leaders, and handed them over to hasty “military courts” who swiftly condemned and executed them. 89 When the French returned to Marburg, people rejoiced at the restoration of order. 90 During the year of martial law in Hessen-Kassel, the French executed more than six hundred civilians. The majority of these were in winter 1806–1807, typically in the context of the uprising, but often on very circumstantial evidence, whether a person was caught in arms or not. More than one hundred others were imprisoned and taken to France, most never to return. 91 Some men were obviously guilty, some even boasted of their guilt. Others were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. On January 8, 1807, Napoleon wrote to Lagrange, ordering him to “make an example” of one major Hessian town by burning it and shooting at least fifty people, asserting that “it is necessary for the rest of Germany.” 92 Five days later Napoleon specified that Hersfeld was the town he wanted burned, and he increased the number of people he wanted shot to sixty. “My arms must be avenged with blood,” he concluded. Lagrange was clearly reluctant to take this step because he had begun to bring the revolt under control and did not want to risk a draconian response that would reignite resistance. Napoleon’s reaction to this crisis was particularly ugly. On January 16, he wrote to Fouché, his chief of police, acknowledging that the Hessian revolt had been subdued. 93 Nonetheless, three days later he insisted upon retaliatory bloodshed: I am far from satisfied. My intention is that the towns of Eschwege and Hersfeld are to be burned, and that sixty or more of the guilty in the surrounding region are to be shot, and three times that number arrested and taken to France. . . . The outrages against my eagles can only be avenged with blood. At least 200 shall pay with their heads for this insurrection. 94\n\nIt is not clear why Napoleon singled out these towns out of all of the places in the insurrection. Lagrange handed the emperor’s order down to the commander of his brigade in Marburg, General Barbot, who occupied Hersfeld with French and Baden troops. Barbot obviously did not want to carry out the order and handed it down to a Baden officer, a lieutenant of light infantry named Johann Baptist Lingg. Unwilling to carry out the brutal order, Lingg ordered the townfolk of Hersfeld to clear out four old buildings, which he then burned down. 95 Thus, Hersfeld was “sacked and burned,” and Lingg became a local hero, with a plaza and monument in the town to this day.\n\n22\n\nChapter 1\n\nPAYS CONQUIS General Lagrange was Napoleon’s military governor for Hessen-Kassel, but he was only one authority in the larger bureaucracy established by the French for the Pays Conquis entre l’Elbe et le Rhin (Conquered Region Between the Elbe and the Rhine). This ad-hoc structure displayed the formidable organizational efficiency of Napoleonic France. Its Administration Générale had an official seal and printed forms for all their quotidian functions. French administrators simply filled in the blanks. By 1806 the French had considerable experience administering conquered peoples and they were ready with forms for the seizure of property, for revenues and expenses, for legal decisions, for military and police needs, and every other aspect of their daily operations. In part the French were simply doing the normal work of administration. On the other hand, they were also charged with extracting wealth from these regions. Lagrange, as Gouverneur-Général de la Hesse, filled his days with paperwork trying to push this process forward in the face of the inevitable complaints and resistance. Between May and December 1807, Lagrange dealt with more than three hundred petitions from local people asking to be relieved from some or all of the contributions. A former court secretary in Kassel, for instance, wanted to know if he could substitute supplies instead of money because he was unemployed. A young valet wrote a lengthy appeal, asking the French to spare “my poor family.” Aristocrats often used their wax seals on letters such as these, which probably did not impress Lagrange. 96 Despite the great volume of paperwork, demands for contributions could often be quite perfunctory, especially if they involved Napoleon’s military. Sometimes an official Recette Générale des Contributions was written up, with amounts stated in francs. More often, however, a few sentences sufficed for a demand, usually in Thaler. Two sentences, for instance, sufficed for a requisition of 185,000 Thaler, without even explaining what it was for, other than the French military. 97 Sometimes, not always, an official would countersign the documents, taking responsibility for the contribution. It is striking, however, that so much wealth was extracted in this manner. It is also unclear, given the absence of official acknowledgment in so many cases, whether these sums were considered part of Napoleon’s official demands on these places, or whether they were extracted in addition to those demands. 98 The occupation government anticipated some elements of the coming Westphalian state. The administration of religion, for instance, was a completely new phenomenon in German life. The French put religious officials on their payroll and in turn began to regulate them. Some of the salaries were impressive, such as a preacher who received 637 francs per month, but there were broad discrepancies. One church organist received a 250-franc monthly\n\nI Have Come to Occupy Your Land\n\n23\n\nsalary, for instance, while another received only 26 francs. Two lowly schoolmasters received monthly payments of 2 and 7 francs, respectively, obviously not a salary but rather a way of keeping men on the payroll and thus under control. 99 Another way in which the occupation government anticipated the future Westphalia was the role of the French in law and its enforcement. In 1807, French military tribunals were the sole arbiters of justice and were first and foremost concerned with maintaining order. The charge of “mauvaise conduite” recurs frequently in their reports and could mean anything from prostitution to drunken disorderly conduct, to suspicion of disloyalty. Punishments ranged from detention to hard labor in irons. The French were not required to specify the reason for an arrest; French officers could vouch for a particular civilian and release him, just as easily as they could have him arrested. 100 The most fundamental questions about the French occupation remained unanswerable for the first half of 1807. How long would the French stay? What would they do if and when they left? Because Napoleon had abolished two of the local dynasties, what would replace them? These questions were answered with surprising rapidity in the wake of Napoleon’s victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland in June. As the French and Russians came to the peace table at Tilsit that summer, the latter with their dejected Prussian allies in tow, Napoleon began another phase of dramatic alterations of the map of Europe. Hessen-Kassel, Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, the southern portions of Hannover, and most of Prussia’s provinces on the west bank of the Elbe (primarily the Altmark) were to be combined into a new kingdom. In many cases these lands were changing hands for the first time in four centuries. It is not clear when he first suggested the idea of a new kingdom to Tsar Alexander of Russia, but the first written record of him doing so, and the indication that the Russians approved, dates from July 4, 1807. In that letter Napoleon used the expression “King of Westphalia” in his correspondence for the first time. Three days later that future king received the news, himself. NOTES 1. A.
