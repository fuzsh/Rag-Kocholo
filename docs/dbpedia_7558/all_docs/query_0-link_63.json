        "text": "NOTES\n\nPrologue: Gays in the Military\n\n1. Eric Schmitt, “Powell Receives a Rousing Greeting at Harvard,” New York Times, 11 June 1993, A8; “Balloons of Protest for Powell at Harvard,” New York Times, 9 June 1993, A14; Alice Dembner and Tom Coakley, “Powell Says Gay Issue Is Solvable: Quiet Protest Greets General at Harvard,” Boston Globe, 11 June 1993, 1; Melissa Healy, “Powell Faces Protest over Armed Forces’ Ban on Gays in the Military,” Los Angeles Times, 11 June 1993, 20.\n\n2. While Larry Kramer describes the homophobic inaction of the government and the activist work of ACT UP in terms of genocide, battles, and war, Susan Sontag argues against the use of military metaphors in AIDS discourse. For a more thorough discussion of this debate, see Larry Kramer, Reports from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist (New York: St. Martin’s, 1989) and Susan Sontag, AIDS and Its Metaphors (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1989).\n\n3. Following his opposition to gays in the military during his tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of State Colin Powell later advocated—in opposition to President George W. Bush—the use of condoms and safer sex campaigns to fight AIDS in Africa. Despite his early opposition to the integration of gay soldiers in the armed forces, one must recognize Colin Powell’s lifetime service, political courage, and pioneering leadership as the first African-American to serve both as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and as Secretary of State.\n\nIntroduction: Napoleon Wept\n\n1. Jean-Baptiste-Antoine-Marcellin de Marbot, Mémoires du Général Baron de Marbot, vol. 1 (1891; Paris: Mercure de France, 1983), 447. Unless otherwise noted, all translations in this book are mine.\n\n2. Marbot 1: 447.\n\n3. For more on ancient combat companions and warrior lovers, see Wayne Dynes and Stephen Donaldson, eds., Homosexuality in the Ancient World (New York: Garland, 1992); David Halperin, One Hundred Years of Homosexuality and Other Essays on Greek Love (New York: Routledge, 1990); Michel Foucault, Histoire de la sexualité, 3 vols. (Paris: Gallimard, 1984); Jonathan Goldberg, ed. Reclaiming Sodom (New York: Routledge, 1994); John Bos-well, “Battle Worn: Gays in the Military, 300 bc,’ ‘New Republic, 10 May 1993, 15–18. Boswell argues that “same-sex eroticism” has a “long and hallowed relationship to democracy and military valor” in both the historical and literary record of ancient Greece: “The association of homosexuals with democracy and the military is intense and widespread, extending from Harmodius and Aristogiton, a pair of lovers who were believed to have founded the Athenian democracy … to the noted generals Pelopidas and Epaminondas, to the great military genius Alexander and his male lover Bagoas” (15). To these pairs might also be added the Emperor Hadrian and his Greek lover Antinous.\n\n4. Plato, The Symposium, trans. Christopher Gill (London: Penguin, 1999), 10–11.\n\n5. Plato, 10–11. While Christopher Gill translates the older partner as “lover” and the younger partner as “boyfriend,” I have substituted “lover” for both comrades. Gill’s more radical translation stands in contrast to others that favor “beloved” or “man in love.” Boswell, for example, cites the following translation: “For a man in love would surely choose to have all the rest of the host rather than the one he loves see him forsaking his station or flinging away his arms; sooner than this he would prefer to die many deaths: while, as for leaving the one he loves in the lurch or not succoring him in peril, no man is so craven that the influence of love cannot inspire him with a courage that makes him equal to the bravest born” (“Battle Worn,” 15).\n\n6. Homer, The Iliad, trans. Richard Lattimore (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951), 375–76. Subsequent line references to this edition are provided parenthetically in the body of the text.\n\n7. In One Hundred Years of Homosexuality, David Halperin argues that for epic warrior pairs, “death is the climax of friendship, the occasion of the most extreme expressions of tenderness on the part of the two friends, and it weds them forever … Indeed, it is not too much to say that death is to friendship what marriage is to romance” (79). Halperin explains that while Homer mentions nothing about the erotic life of Achilles and Patroclus, it was assumed that “the relation between the heroes was a pederastic one” (86).\n\n8. While the actual battle on August 15, 778, pitted the rearguard of Charlemagne’s Frankish army against an army of Basque guerrillas, the Song of Roland distorts the historical battle by substituting the Catholic Basques with Muslim Saracens.\n\n9. See Howard Bloch, “The First Document and the Birth of Medieval Studies,” and Joseph Duggan, “The Epic,” in A New History of French Literature, ed. Denis Hollier (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989), 6, 11, 22.\n\n10. For more on chivalric friendship and male intimacy in medieval Europe, see Alan Bray, The Friend (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003).\n\n11. La Chanson de Roland, trans. Jean Dufournet (Paris: Garnier Flammarion, 1993), 283. Subsequent line references to this edition are provided parenthetically in the body of the text.\n\n12. In the introduction to his translation of the Song of Roland (London: Norton, 1978), Frederick Goldin explains that “the relation that binds man and lord, and man and man, in this way is designated amur, love; so that when Ganelon, at the height of his rage, shouts at Roland, Jo ne vus aim nïent … that is no understated and ironical insult but the most terrible thing he could utter. It means: the bonds of loyalty are cut, we are enemies” (22).\n\n13. For more on Achilles, Roland, and Lannes, see Chapter 2. In “The First Document and the Birth of Medieval Studies,” Howard Bloch also draws a connection between the Carolingian and (post-)Napoleonic empires when he argues that “it can be no accident that … the discipline of medieval studies came into being in France in the period between the Franco-Prussian War and World War I (1870–1914)” when both German and French scholars of Carolingian texts like the Oaths of Strasbourg and the Song of Roland “debated passionately whether Europe’s earliest literary monuments were of French or German origin” (10).\n\n14. See Chapters 1 and 2 for more on these reforms in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic armies.\n\n15. From the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries, the French historical record is rich in many other anecdotal examples of military men who loved men. In medieval France, these soldiers included Philippe II (1180–1223) who mounted a crusade with his lover Richard the Lion Hearted (1157–99). During the reign of Louis XIV, the king’s military brother Philippe Duc d’Orléans (1674–1723) was said to have organized a secret society of sodomitical military men, which may have included Marshal Louis-Joseph de Vendôme (1654–1712), his brother Philippe de Vendôme (1655–1727), Admiral Louis de Vermandois (1667–83), Marshal Nicolas d’Huxelles (1652–1730), General Claude-Alexandre de Bonneval (1675–1747), and Marshal Claude Louis Hector de Villars (1653–1734). For more, see Boswell, “Battle Worn”; and Michel Larivière, Homosexuels et bisexuels célèbres: le dictionnaire (Paris: Delé-traz, 1997). For an extended discussion on the abuses of the Royal Army during the Ancien Régime, see Chapter 1.\n\n16. As I discuss at length in Chapter 2, one must be careful not to wholly accept or dismiss these secondary Napoleonic sources in the absence of the Emperor’s definitive memoirs.\n\n17.

In her analysis of unit cohesion and the debates on gays in the military, the American political scientist Elizabeth Kier argues that “the combat officer and military theorist Ardant du Picq had eloquently expressed a similar opinion in his discussion of the role of unit cohesion a century ago” (12).\n\n25.

Clemenceau’s original French expression is even more homoerotically suggestive: “Voilà un homme admirable, courageux, qui a toujours eu des couilles au cul … même quand ce n’étaient pas les siennes” (quoted in Gury, Lyautey-Charlus, 86). Using the popular proverb “avoir les couilles au cul” (which roughly means “to have balls,” or to be virile or courageous), Clemenceau literally quipped that Lyautey “always had balls against his ass, even when they were not his own.”\n\n28.

In The Great War and Modern Memory (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975), Paul Fussell writes about these simultaneous and contradictory influences of Mars and Eros among soldiers during the First World War: “On the one hand, sanctioned public mass murder. On the other, unlawful secret individual love. Again, severe dichotomy” (271). Similarly, Gregory Woods argues in Articulate Flesh: Male Homoeroticism and Modern Poetry (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987) that “[w]ar is a war on love” (58).\n\n34. See Fussell, as well as Allan Bérubé, Coming Out Under Fire: A History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two (New York: Penguin-Plume, 1990).\n\n35. This tradition is, of course, not limited to France. Military buddies and combat companions also figure prominently in the American and English literary traditions, from Walt Whitman’s Drum-Taps (1865), to Herman Melville’s Billy Budd (1886–91), and the First World War trench poems of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, among many others.

In Chapter 3, I discuss the Napoleonic memoirs of two such soldiers, Sergeant François Bourgogne and Captain Jean-Roch Coignet. In order to gain promotion in Napoleon’s armies, Coignet learned to read at the age of thirty-two.\n\n50. John Albert Lynn argues nevertheless that “it would be excessively cynical to dismiss the talk of fraternity as pure cant … [T]he fraternal ideal undoubtedly influenced the ordinaire, tightening bonds and defining the relationship between men as familial, based on affection, concern, support, and a strong degree of selflessness” (173). Similarly, Alan Forrest argues that fraternity had much more symbolic and practical weight for soldiers than for citizens: “The Revolutionary concept of fraternity, indeed, arguably rather vacuous in civilian society, assumed a rich and evocative meaning in the ranks of the army, where young men did feel like brothers, dependent on one another in the face of shared danger” (Soldiers, 102).\n\n51.

Having been fatally wounded off the southwest coast of Spain during the naval battle of Trafalgar on October 21, 1805, Napoleon’s great rival, the English Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson famously asked his friend, the naval captain Thomas Hardy, to kiss him before he died. Although some have speculated that the dying Nelson said “Kismet, Hardy” instead of “Kiss me, Hardy,” others have argued that the word “kismet” did not enter popular English usage until later in the nineteenth century and that, in any case, Hardy understood Nelson’s words as a request for a kiss, which he willingly provided for his dying friend. For more on Nelson’s death, see Roger Knight, The Pursuit of Victory: The Life and Achievement of Horatio Nelson (New York: Basic Books, 2007), 501–26; Christopher Hibbert, Nelson: A Personal History (New York: Basic Books, 1994), 376; John Sugden, Nelson: A Dream of Glory(New York: Henry Holt, 2004); Terry Coleman, The Nelson Touch: The Life and Legend of Horatio Nelson (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002).\n\n6. From his youthful ennui in Paris with Junot, to his melancholic mourning over Lannes and Duroc, to his final windswept exile on St. Helena, Napoleon could be thought of as possessing the same emasculating mal du siècle as other prominent Romantic figures.

Echoing Lannes’s other biographers, Ronald Zins speculates: “Isn’t it because of his feelings that Napoleon did not attend the last honors rendered to Lannes? Wasn’t he afraid of being a spectacle of overwhelming emotion in public? Since, for no other companion did Napoleon feel such affection as he did for Lannes” (323).\n\n21. In Napoleon ou le mythe du sauveur (Paris: Fayard, 1977), Jean Tulard writes: “Much has been said of Napoleon’s extraordinary capacity for work, his prodigious memory, the admirable organization of his intelligence, and … his genius for staging a scene. Much has been spoken of his contempt, his excessive pride, and his extreme nervousness which threw him into epileptic-like fits” (308). Tulard argues that the Napoleonic legend also gives way to contradictory interpretations of Napoleon’s private life: “The man was quick-tempered but faithful in friendship … The legend and then the counter-legend have contributed to blur the face of Napoleon, overestimating sometimes his good qualities, sometimes his faults. His correspondence reveals his excess, but also his good sense; his harshness, but also his sentimental side” (308).\n\n22.

Coignet also writes how, at the battle of Essling in 1809, the Emperor “had recognized his favorite,” Marshal Lannes (174). Lannes’s biographer Ronald Zins insists, “[A]n intimate friend of Bonaparte, Lannes was incontestably the favorite of the First Consul” (316). Zins argues that despite their alternating “affection and reproaches, trust and defiance, pouting and reconciliations,” Napoleon and Lannes “remained faithful to each other” until Lannes’s death in Austria: “The death of Lannes caused Napoleon profound and sincere pain: with the disappearance of Lannes, a little of Napoleon died … Lannes was truly the Emperor’s favorite” (326). However, Napoleon’s biographer Alan Schom argues that, following the death of Lannes, “Duroc was indeed his only close friend” and that the deaths of both men were equally devastating: “Napoleon was silent and remote for days thereafter, just as he had been following the death of Lannes at Wagram. The effect of the loss of Duroc … was certainly great and permanent, leaving Napoleon a different man, more distant than ever before. He was now all alone in the world” (664–65).\n\n26. As I argue in the Introduction, these models would inspire tactical innovations in military strategy much later in the century by such theorists as Colonel Ardant du Picq and Marshal Lyautey.\n\n27.

It is possible that they also represent such emphasis in Junot’s original letter.\n\n28. Peter Gunn, Napoleon’s Little Pest: The Duchesse of Abrantès (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1979), 68.\n\n29. This is one of the challenges of the memoir as an autobiographical genre: like the confessions of Augustine and Rousseau, one cannot always trust the autobiographer to know or to tell the truth. In Le Pacte autobiographique (1975; Paris: Seuil, 1996), Philippe Lejeune argues that while there is an implicit “referential pact” (36) or agreement that autobiography sets out to tell a verifiable truth, one cannot depend on the writer to tell an objective truth. Similarly, Jean Tulard argues in Napoléon ou le mythe du sauveur that all theories surrounding the enigma of Napoleon are open to consideration and skepticism in equal part (308, 451). Rumor and exaggeration participate in historical discourse not because of their distortion of the truth, but because they define the outer limits of believability. Laure Junot’s memoirs are thus an equally dubious and dependable source. For a comparison of her style with corroborating sources, see the strikingly similar accounts—cited later in this chapter—by Laure Junot and Emmanuel de las Cases of the meeting between Bonaparte and Junot at the siege of Toulon in 1793.\n\n30. Compare Laure Junot’s passage on Napoleon and Junot in the Jardin des Plantes with Maurice Lever’s descriptions in Les Bûchers de Sodome (Paris: Fayard, 1985) of eighteenth-century infâmes cruising in the Tuileries (250) or Joris-Karl Huysmans’s account in his 1884 novel À rebours (Paris: Fasquelle, 1968) of the exaggerated floral decadence of the Parisian dandy Des Esseintes (105–6, 122–29).\n\n31. In Homosexuels et bisexuels célèbres: le dictionnaire (Paris: Delétraz, 1997), Michel Larivière argues that the friendship between Napoleon and Junot may have transformed at this time into a more intimate liaison: “Without money, deprived of women, it is perhaps at this moment that the very intense friendship between the two men could have transformed itself, in the space of a few weeks, into a homosexual liaison” (199). In Les Cinq girouettes ou Servitudes et souplesses de son Altesse Sérénissime le Prince Archichancelier de l’Empire, Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès (Paris: Ramsay, 1979), Jean-Louis Bory writes that the homoerotic nature of their relationship was exaggerated by rumor: “Junot had not hidden his passion for Bonaparte at Toulon, an admiration which bordered on idolatry, a devotion as juvenile as a love affair … And it is with Junot that Bonaparte, released from prison, had lived out his disgrace … on the meager allowances that Junot received from his family. French soldiers were not so off the mark in making cracks about this Corsican Hadrian and Burgundian Antinoüs, this Achilles and Patroclus of the Revolutionary armies” (110). These homoerotic comparisons of Napoleon and Junot to ancient combat companions echo comparisons of Jean Lannes to both Achilles and Roland.\n\n32.

In the Trésor de la langue française: Dictionnaire de la langue du XIXe et du XXe siècle (Paris: Gallimard, 1992), a séide is more broadly defined as a “person who manifests a blind and fanatical devotion to a master, leader, party, or sect. Synon. fanatic, partisan, sectarian” (15: 263–64). The following sources offer similar definitions and trace the entry of this word into literary usage by nineteenth-century writers such as Chateaubriand, Constant, Stendhal, Hugo, Balzac, Mérimée, and Vigny, who quite often used the word séide to refer to fanatical followers of Napoleon: Paul-Émile Littré, Littré: Dictionnaire de la langue française, vol. 6 (Versailles: Encyclopaedia Brittanica France, 1997), 5809; Grand Larousse de la langue française, ed. Louis Guilbert, vol. 6 (Paris: Larousse, 1971–78), 5435; Dictionnaire historique de la langue française, ed.

For more on the role of dueling in nineteenth-century France, see Robert Nye, Masculinity and Male Codes of Honor in Modern France (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 148–215.\n\n36. Despite his occasional quips and requests for public discretion, Napoleon trusted his Second Consul and Imperial Arch-Chancellor Cambacérès with running his affairs of state in France during his many extended absences at war. Under the jurisprudent leadership of Cambacérès, sodomy was decriminalized by the Napoleonic Civil Code of 1804 and the later Penal Code of 1810. Cambacérès’s role as Second Consul and Imperial Arch-Chancellor are detailed in Richard Boulind, Cambacérès and the Bonapartes (New York: Kraus, 1976); Pierre-François Pinnaud, Cambacérès (Paris: Perrin, 1996); and in Cambacérès’s own Lettres inédites à Napoleon, 1802–1814, ed. Jean Tulard (Paris: Klincksieck, 1973). Jean Bory discusses Cambacérès’s sexuality in Les Cinq girouettes; and Michael David Sibalis has provided an excellent analysis of Cambacérès’s role in drafting the Napoleonic Code and other penal codes decriminalizing sodomy in France in “The Regulation of Male Homosexuality in Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, 1789–1815,” in Homosexuality in Modern France, ed. Jeffrey Merrick and Bryant T. Ragan Jr. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 80–101.\n\n37. According to Jean-Louis Bory, Napoleon demanded that Junot wed in order to silence the rumors: “[Napoleon] named him, at the age of 28, the military commandant of the city of Paris, on one condition: he had to marry in order to quiet the rumors (à la Cambacérès). Napoleon would end up covering Junot in gold and honors, but this fervent friendship bothered him” (133).\n\n38. In Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argues that in “the rivalry between the two active members of an erotic triangle … the bond that links the two rivals is as intense and potent as the bond that links either of the rivals to the beloved” (21). Drawing on René Girard’s discussion of erotic triangles in Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesque (Paris: Grasset, 1961), Sedgwick postulates that the erotic triangle is “symmetrical—in the sense that its structure would be relatively unaffected by the power difference that would be introduced by a change in the gender of one of the participants” (23). In Epistemology of the Closet (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), Sedgwick summarizes her earlier work on the erotic triangle in Between Men by arguing that, in some cases, “male–male desire became widely intelligible primarily by being routed through triangular relations involving a woman” (15).\n\n39.

In Junot, qui ne fut pas maréchal d’empire (Châtillon-sur-Seine: Association des amis du Châtillonnais, 1993), Maxime Cordier writes, “One has a tendency to forget, or at least to minimize the fact that, since 1792, Junot suffered from great cranio-cerebral trauma … He was wounded twenty-seven times and at least three times quite seriously, in the head and on his face” (133–40).\n\n44. The Illyrian Provinces of the French Empire occupied territories that comprise parts of present-day Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n45. Cordier, 122.\n\n46. In her 1941 travelogue, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia (London: Penguin, 1994), Rebecca West writes “Junot, the Duke d’Abrantès, brought his career to its only possible climax at the Governor’s palace in the delicious Slovenian town of Lyublyana. He gave a state ball, and came down the great marble staircase, under the blazing chandeliers, stark naked and raving mad” (121). The French imperial governor’s palace was in Ljubljana, the capital of Napoleon’s Illyrian Provinces. Maxime Cordier argues, however, that Junot’s infamous 1813 ball took place in Ragusa (Dubrovnik).\n\n47. While Maxime Cordier documents a total of twenty-seven wounds during Junot’s military career (133–40), Junot himself later spoke to Napoleon of his seventeen battle wounds (Junot, 11: 207). Despite this discrepancy—which may represent Junot’s own minimizing of minor versus major wounds—both numbers attest to an extraordinary amount of battle-inflicted trauma.\n\n48. On the madness and death of Junot, Las Cases also writes, “The irregularities that one had observed for some time in Junot and which had originated in his excesses, broke down into complete insanity. It became necessary to restrain him and transport him home to his father’s house where he perished miserably soon after, mutilated by his own hands” (361–62). Here, Las Cases seems to suggest that Junot’s “insanity” was due to end-stage syphilis, rather than to combat wounds and cerebral head trauma. However, Maxime Cordier documents further reports of Junot’s erratic behavior in Illyria by diplomats, doctors, and witnesses in Milan, Gorizia, and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) that suggest otherwise. Two of these reports—that Junot “gave his grand cordon de la Légion d’honneur to a village idiot” and that “[h]e had written to Admiral Freemantle, commander of the English fleet in the Adriatic, to negotiate a peaceful truce”—imply that Junot’s peculiar conduct in Illyria may be explained more accurately by his battle fatigue, disillusionment, and desire for peace than by simplistic accusations of “insanity” (124–25).\n\n49. In stark contrast to the Emperor’s effusive outpouring of private grief and his orders to organize great ceremonies and monuments of public mourning for both Lannes and Duroc, Napoleon’s reaction to the death of his old friend Junot inspired little grief or emotion. According to Louis Constant, “The Emperor learned of the death of the Duc d’Abrantès, who had just succumbed … to the violent excesses of the terrible sickness from which he was suffering. Though the Emperor already knew that [Junot] was in a deplorable state of mental alienation, and must have expected this loss … he sincerely regretted [the death of] his old aide-de-camp” (4: 59). Such “sincere regret” for Junot is far from the dramatic sobbing and national mourning associated with Napoleon’s earlier losses of Lannes and Duroc.\n\n50.

Some reports claim even greater mortality. Alan Schom argues that of the 611,900 men who began the campaign, only 43,000 survived to re-cross the Niemen on December 10, 1812, but that another 36,000 died or were taken prisoner during the three following days, leaving a total of only 8,823 survivors (595, 642–44). While George Blond claims in La Grande Armée (Paris: Pierre Laffont, 1979) that anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 returned to France (379), Marcel Spivak writes in his introduction to François Bourgogne’s Mémoires du Sergent Bourgogne that only 5,000 men of the Grande Armée survived the re-crossing of the Niemen (4, 16–17). David Chandler reports inThe Campaigns of Napoleon (New York: Macmillan, 1966) that Napoleon began the Russian Campaign with 655,000 men and lost some 570,000: this overwhelming loss of life in the ranks of the Grande Armée included 370,000 who were killed in combat or died of exposure and sickness during the retreat, as well as 200,000 who were taken prisoner by the Russians, half of whom died later (852–53). By comparison, Drew Gilpin Faust reports in This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War (New York: Knopf, 2008) that an estimated total of 620,000 soldiers in the Union and Confederate armies died during the entire five-year span (1861–65) of the American Civil War (xi).\n\n4.

Starting with Le Pacte autobiographique (Paris: Seuil, 1975), Philippe Lejeune’s extensive work on autobiography builds on theoretical considerations of the genre from Freud and Gide to Barthes and Lacan. In Si le grain ne meurt (1926; Paris: Gallimard, 1972), André Gide writes that “[m]emoirs are never more than half sincere, no matter how greatly they strive for the truth: everything is always more complicated than one says” (278). For Freud, memory and repetition bring the past into the present (the unconscious into consciousness), as an evolving process in which the past is never fixed, but constantly rewritten or remembered in the present. Freud thus resists easy self-synopsis in An Autobiographical Study (1925). Jacques Lacan argues in “Les Quatre concepts fondamentaux de la psychanalyse,” Le séminaire de Jacques Lacan, ed. Jacques-Alain Miller, vol. 11 (Paris: Seuil, 1973), that the mirror stage initiates a lifelong desire for self-knowledge, but that the subject can never fully understand this unknowable Other. In La Mort de l’auteur (1968), Roland Barthes calls on interpretation—or the birth of the reader—to replace what he believes is an unproductive emphasis on the authority of the author. In his own autobiographical text, Roland Barthes par Roland Barthes (Paris: Seuil, 1975), Barthes echoes Gide in questioning autobiographical sincerity: “What I write about myself is never the last word: the more ‘sincere’ I am, the more interpretable I am,” Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, trans. Richard Howard (London: Macmillan, 1977), 120. For a detailed discussion of the genre, see Linda Anderson, Autobiography (New York: Routledge, 2001).\n\n8. In Le Pacte autobiographique (1975; Paris: Seuil, 1996), Philippe Lejeune proposes a working definition of autobiography as a “retrospective account in prose that a real person writes about his own existence, stressing his own individual life” (14). Although memoirs are often not limited to the author’s life, Lejeune argues that the memoir nonetheless takes part in the “autobiographical pact” and the “referential pact” (26, 36).\n\n9. According to Lejeune, “even if the account is, historically, completely false, it will be in the order of the lie (which is an ‘autobiographical’ category) and not of fiction” (30). In defense of the Napoleonic memoir, Jean Tulard asks: “Should one renounce memoirs and forbid them from bibliographies? Aren’t other historical documents which we prefer over memoirs, just as suspect: statistics marred by errors, records recorded by suspiciously optimistic officials, police reports filled with dubious gossip, bulletins of the Grande Armée which the soldiers themselves laughed at … Memoirs reveal to us what kind of image the authors wanted to give of themselves and how they viewed their historical period; they thus form an essential source on the history of ideas” (Nouvelle bibliographie, 13).\n\n10. For a more detailed discussion of Captain Périolas and Balzac’s fiction, see Chapters 6 and 8.\n\n11. As opposed to the more national character of “countryman,” the term “homeboy” most accurately describes the sense of local, provincial, and regional friendship that is embodied in the French term pays. But since “homeboy” is associated with twentieth-century African American hip-hop culture, I have chosen the more neutral term “hometown friend” for a soldier’s pays. For a detailed discussion of these terms, see the analysis of Marbot, Coignet, and Bourgogne later in this chapter.\n\n12. Jean-Baptiste-Antoine-Marcellin de Marbot, Mémoires du Général Baron de Marbot, vol. 1 (Paris: Mercure de France, 1983), 34–35.\n\n13. In “Imitation and Gender Insubordination,” Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories, ed. Diana Fuss (New York: Routledge, 1991), Judith Butler writes: “If gender is drag and if it is an imitation that regularly produces the ideal it attempts to approximate, then gender is a performance that produces the illusion of an inner sex or essence or psychic core; it produces on the skin, through the gesture, the move, the gait (that array of corporeal theatrics understood as gender presentation), the illusion of an inner depth” (23). By “uniform” manhood, I mean both the requirements of military dress (uniform) and the strict expectations of a standard (uniform) definition or expression of masculinity in Napoleon’s armies.\n\n14. In Les Soldats de la Grande Armée (Paris: Perrin, 1998), Jean-Claude Damamme writes that “For the simple soldier, the discovery of military life begins with the discovery of a man … [E]very new arrival below the rank of corporal shares a bed with an older soldier, who serves as his mentor” (37). Younger soldiers thus submitted to what Damamme calls the “virile promiscuity of an older soldier” (37).\n\n15. Martin Duberman suggests that the bedfellow is a common trope in nineteenth-century epistolary, autobiographical, and homoerotic writing. Though he writes about American bedfellows during the 1820s, his work has important implications for the soldiers of the Civil War (1861–65) and the homoerotic military relationships described by Walt Whitman in his Drum-Taps (1865). Martin Duberman, “ ‘Writhing Bedfellows’ in Antebellum South Carolina: Historical Interpretation and the Politics of Evidence,” in Hidden from History: Reclaiming the Gay and Lesbian Past, ed. Martin Duberman et al. (New York: Penguin-Meridian, 1990), 153–68.\n\n16. Chandler, 548. Schom, 444.\n\n17. The striking similarities between Marbot and Chabert are discussed at length in Chapter 7. Having risked the loss of his identity (Mar/bot) with the removal of this last article of his uniform (boot/botte), it is ironic that Marbot is brought back to consciousness (re-booted, as it were) by this ritual stripping of his wounded body.\n\n18. Jean-Roch Coignet, Les Cahiers du Capitaine Coignet, ed. Lorédan Larchey (Paris: Hachette, 1912), 137, 141.\n\n19. Tulard argues that Coignet demonstrates “a naiveté which guarantees authenticity” and makes his text “indispensable reading for understanding the mentality of grognards” (Nouvelle bibliographie, 81).\n\n20. John Fortescue explains, “The officers … were worse off than the soldiers. Indeed, but for the affectionate care of their men, they would have perished … And hence we find officers constantly walking arm-in-arm with their men, embracing them, and otherwise courting them.” John Fortescue, Introduction, The Notebooks of Captain Coignet, by Jean-Roch Coignet, trans.

In La Morale des corps: le soin de propreté corporelle à Paris, évolution des normes et pratiques, 1850–1900 (Lille: Université de Lille, 1986), Julia Scialom Csergo writes, “Merciless inspection reports describe the repugnant filth of feet, which corrupted the stinking atmosphere of the barracks, the great filthiness of bodies covered in an oily layer emanating a fetid odor, the repugnant state of hair, with which the soldiers had the bad habit of wiping their dirty hands, the noxious breath, the infectious uncleanness of the genital organs which … engendered symptoms of syphilis” (200).\n\n22. In La Vie militaire sous l’Empire (Paris: Henry du Parc, 1888), Captain Elzéar Blaze explains: “During the Empire, one could enter the military in three different ways: one could enlist as a soldier, which was the simplest and least expensive way; one could enroll in the vélites; or one could be admitted as a cadet to the military school at Fontainebleau” (19). Damamme also discusses the requirements and training for imperial vélites (33–44).\n\n23. In his preface to Hachette’s 1978 edition of Bourgogne’s memoirs, Jean Tulard argues that he considers Bourgogne a “born storyteller” and “the best witness of the disaster of 1812” whose memoirs offer the “foot soldier’s point of view” (11).\n\n24. Published in 1825 as La Campagne de Russie (Paris: Firmin Didot, 1894), Ségur’s account of the retreat features moving descriptions of freezing soldiers: “The Muscovite winter … attacked them from all sides: it penetrated through their flimsy clothing and their torn shoes. Their wet clothes froze right on them; this envelope of ice took hold of their bodies and stiffened their limbs … and formed icicles which hung from their beards” (256). Ségur demonstrates a gift for metaphor in his comparison of the retreat to a funeral procession: “In front of them and around them, all was snow … it was like a great natural shroud that enveloped the army! The only distinguishable objects were the somber pines which, like graveside trees in funerary green … completed this desolated landscape of mass mourning” (256). Despite this literary skill, Paul Cottin argues (in his foreword to Hachette’s 1978 edition of Bourgogne’s memoirs) that Ségur is limited by his point of view as a senior officer and member of the nobility: “We owe to [Ségur] one version of the Russian Campaign … but it is not true to life and could never be … [Ségur] did not at all have to endure the suffering of the soldiers and troop officers” (21).\n\n25.

From 1807 to 1813, the German state of Hesse-Kassel was incorporated into the Kingdom of Westphalia, a puppet state of the Napoleonic Empire ruled by Napoleon’s youngest brother, Jérôme Bonaparte. Despite the illegitimacy of King Jérôme, this new state became a constitutional monarchy, eradicated feudal serfdom, established religious freedom, and adopted the Napoleonic Code. While Prince Émile de Hesse-Kassel may have been part of the older Hessian aristocracy, his new roles as a prince of this modernized Westphalia and as an officer in the Napoleonic armies may have required his adherence to more egalitarian and meritocratic standards in regard to his subjects and soldiers. In this context, these Hessian soldiers may have protected the young prince out of a sense of duty, and even fraternity, rather than mere obligation.

Both Bourgogne and Marguerite de Navarre use the French word “bourse” (purse) to describe the shared financial resources of these men. According to Le Petit Robert de la langue française, ed. Paul Robert (Paris: Dictionnaires Le Robert, 1991), “bourse” can refer to the Latin word scrotum, which came into French usage in 1541 to indicate “la peau des bourses” or purse skin (1782). While it seems unlikely that either Bourgogne or Marguerite de Navarre are making any erotic allusions when describing the joint “bourse” of these men, it is clear that the shared purse and property of both male pairs symbolize their material and emotional intimacy.\n\n30. Bourgogne, 233, 366–71. Picart’s “Mama Sausage” or “La Mère aux bouts” is a bawdy play on the word bout, which resembles the word boudin for “sausage,” literally means “an end or tip,” and can thus also refer to an erect penis. Mama Sausage is thus either a juvenile adolescent nickname for a hometown sausage vendor or a misogynist description of a prostitute, who evokes images for these soldiers of either a full stomach or an early sexual experience.\n\n31.

This heartbreaking image of a battle-hardened soldier—who, having lost his fingers to frostbite, cannot urinate on his own—stands in stark contrast to images of masculine virility and military power.

In La Légende de Napoléon et les écrivains français du 19ème siècle (Paris: Minard, 1967), Maurice Descotes explains that “Stendhal’s feelings for Napoleon never ceased to change. From his instinctive adolescent admiration followed severe critical judgment; then his support of a regime which provided him with the most brilliant years of his life (1810–11), transforming him into a government administrator whose devotion nonetheless fell short of fanaticism” (160). In similar terms, Marcel Heisler writes in Stendhal et Napoléon (Paris: Nizet, 1969): “On the surface, he changed opinions on Napoleon: he admired him, detested him, then admired him again. From a Revolutionary at ten years old, a Jacobin at twenty, an anti-Bonapartist at forty, and a Bonapartist at fifty … [he] often admired and bragged about the strength and violence of the tyrant, though he never supported the full weight of tyranny” (204–5).\n\n6.

In their work on the closet, gender, and cross-dressing, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Judith Butler, and Marjorie Garber provide theoretical models for understanding Julien’s struggle with the cassock, uniform, and wardrobe structure of his military closet. In Epistemology of the Closet (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), Sedgwick defines “closetedness” as “a performance initiated as such by the speech act of a silence” where the closet is built on binary “relations of the known and the unknown, the explicit and the inexplicit” (3). Julien’s closetedness can be thought of as a clerical performance that silences his military identity. In “Imitation and Gender Insubordination,” inInside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories, ed. Diana Fuss (New York: Routledge, 1991), Judith Butler argues that “drag constitutes the mundane way in which genders are appropriated, theatricalized, worn, and done” and defines gender as “a performance that produces the illusion of an inner sex or essence or psychic gender core” (21, 28). In the same way, Julien’s clerical drag can be thought of as an outward clerical performance that does not reflect his inner identification as a soldier. Marjorie Garber argues in Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety (New York: Routledge, 1997) that drag can be as much a transgression of class as gender. In her discussion of Shakespeare’sTwelfth Night, Garber argues that Malvolio is “as much a cross-dresser as Viola, but what he crosses is a boundary of rank rather than of gender. His desire is clearly for upward mobility, another kind of coming out of the closet” (36). In establishing that “status and gender are both clearly marked … by costume change,” Garber reminds us that “the clothes make the man” and one must “dress for success” (36, 1, 41). Julien’s ambitious desire for success in Restoration France produces a similar conflict between the epaulettes of his uniform and the folds of his cassock.\n\n8. Stendhal, Le Rouge et le noir, ed. Anne-Marie Meininger (Paris: Gallimard-Folio, 2000), 69–70.\n\n9. It was in part for this reason that younger generations were so easily seduced by Napoleon’s nephew Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, and were so willing to elect him to power as President of the Second Republic (1848) and Emperor Napoleon III of the Second Empire (1851–52). For more on Napoleon III, see Chapter 9.\n\n10. In “Truth in Masquerade,” in Stendhal: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Victor Brombert, trans. B. A. B. Archer (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1962), Jean Starobinski argues that Henri Beyle’s many pseudonyms represent a similar process of self-identification related to costuming, masquerade, and travesty: “We have then … a man unhappy with what he is … who is torn between two conflicting desires: to affirm himself by an act of power … or to metamorphose ceaselessly, to become other than himself, to split in two so as to become both an accomplished actor and an invisible spectator through some form of efficacious travesty” (120–21). This description of Stendhal also applies to Julien Sorel, who similarly hopes for metamorphosis, the transformation of the cassock into the uniform, and the translation of his name from the peasant Julien Sorel to the noble Chevalier de la Vernaye.\n\n11. As Simone de Beauvoir argues in The Second Sex, trans. H. M. Parshley (New York: Vintage-Random House, 1989), Julien’s erotic and military misogyny reflects neither Stendhal’s attitudes toward women nor Mathilde de La Mole’s and Madame de Rênal’s power. Ultimately, Julien is no match for Mathilde, an enlightened reader of Voltaire who, Beauvoir points out, “criticizes, disparages, and scorns the society around her and wants to be distinguished for it” (241). Unafraid of paternal authority, Mathilde does not hesitate to set a ladder against her window for her lover’s entry or her own escape, which symbolizes “her proud impudence, her taste for the extraordinary, her provocative courage” (242). Nor is Julien a match for Madame de Rênal who, despite her emotional vulnerability, is not afraid to set her own ladders, defy her husband, or denounce her lover. Beauvoir believes that, though she is “timid and without experience” (243), Madame de Rênal possesses “independence of soul” (241). In all his novels, Beauvoir argues, “Stendhal demands women’s emancipation” in the way he “never limits himself to describing his heroines as functions of his heroes: he gives them a destiny of their own … It is through women, under their influence, in reaction to their behavior, that Julien, Fabrice, Lucien work out their apprenticeship in dealing with the world and themselves” (247).\n\n12. Stendhal, Le Rouge et le noir, 131. In French, Fouqué tells Julien, “Reste avec moi … Sois mon associé.” While Fouqué literally asks Julien to become his business “associate” or “partner,” Fouqué also hopes to share his life in Verrières with his dear friend, in an affectionate as well as commercial association or partnership.\n\n13. In “Truth in Masquerade,” Starobinski argues that liberation from Stendhal’s ubiquitous prison cells depends on the external intervention of love: “In these heroes, who are visited by love in prison, one must recognize … the figurative transposition of Stendhal’s secret desire—to be loved in spite of his ugliness” (119). For Julien, this lover is Fouqué, who loves Julien unconditionally, forgives his many faults, allows him to be himself. In Epistemology of the Closet, Sedgwick argues that self-identity often requires the gaze of the other, in the interplay between the “spectacle” and “viewpoint of the closet” (222–23). Fouqué’s location beyond Julien’s closet affords him the spectacular ability to recognize, love, and “know” Julien.\n\n14. Stendhal, Le Rouge et le noir, 645. Julien’s multiple imprisonments—in his father’s house, the Rênal household, the Besançon seminary, and the Verrières prison—are all metaphors for his personal suffocation. In “Truth in Masquerade,” Starobinski writes, “In the case of Stendhal, the theme of confinement must be underlined. A name, a body, a social status, all are prisons. But their doors are not so well locked that the dream of escape is impossible” (119). Like the closet, Julien’s prisons allow him no room to express his deepest passions (for the military), admirations (for Napoleon), and identifications (with soldiers).\n\n15.

In Narrative and Its Discontents: Problems of Closure in the Traditional Novel (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981), D. A. Miller points out that “as always in Stendhal, military metaphors … define the situation of the latecomer. Their pathos stems from the fact that their source, in the Napoleonic campaigns, is now available only as a figurative vehicle” (125).\n\n18. In Stendhal: Fiction and the Themes of Freedom (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1968), Victor Brombert writes that “Stendhal has been praised for his ‘realistic’ account, for having been the first writer to systematically describe a battle … through the eyes of a single character utterly puzzled by what goes on, and who, instead of dominating the historical event with the perspective and omniscience of an historian, is only able to witness movement and confusion” (155). Brombert argues that “what these pages propose is not at all a ‘realistic’ account, but a mock-heroic episode, a parody of epic attitudes and conventions” (99). In Balzac to Beckett: Center and Circumference in French Fiction (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970), Leo Bersani writes, “The celebrated Waterloo episode in La Chartreuse is, as it has often been said, a satire of the conventions of heroic war literature” (104). For more on Stendhal’s Waterloo, see Jean Prévost, La Création chez Stendhal: essai sur le métier d’écrire et la psychologie de l’écrivain (Paris: Mercure de France, 1951); Henri Martineau, Le Cœur de Stendhal (Paris: Albin Michel, 1952–53); Victor Brombert, Stendhal et la voie oblique (Paris: PUF, 1954); Jean-Pierre Richard, “Connaissance et tendresse chez Stendhal,” Littérature et sensation (Paris: Seuil, 1954); Jean Starobinski, “Stendhal Pseudonyme,” L’Œil vivant(Paris: Gallimard, 1961); Georges Blin, Stendhal et les problèmes du roman (Paris: José Corti, 1954); Stendhal et les problèmes de la personnalité (Paris: José Corti, 1958); and Roger Pearson, ed., Stendhal: The Red and the Black and the Charterhouse of Parma (London: Longman, 1994).\n\n19. Arguing that Stendhal is “the first French author to write modern subjectivity into war literature,” Catharine Savage Brosman writes in Visions of War in France (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1999) that his Waterloo offers “no overview … no neat evaluation … no totalization,” and is thus “one of the first pieces of modern military fiction in France” (95–97).\n\n20. These contrasting figures of paternal madness echo what Shoshana Felman calls, in La ‘Folie’ dans l’œuvre romanesque de Stendhal (Paris: José Corti, 1971), a “two-edged” formula in which “the word ‘madness’ seems like a knot of functions each modifying one another” (43).\n\n21. Victor Brombert argues that La Chartreuse de Parme is “primarily a novel of quest” that includes “the thirst for experience, the voyage, the myths of the false father and of the father substitute” (Pearson 110). Leo Bersani adds that “hostility towards the father is … balanced by the Stendhalian hero’s need for the loving attention of an older man” (100). In Reading for the Plot: Design and Intention in Narrative (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), Peter Brooks writes “ ‘Paternalism’ is … a highly charged concept for Stendhal—a man who used a hundred different pseudonyms, who in letters to his sister referred to their father as ‘the bastard.’ … Encoded in his novels is always the problem of whether paternity is possible, whether there might be a father and son who could talk to one another” (75–76).\n\n22. Faced with this paternal impasse, D. A. Miller proposes that the “Œdipal struggle in Stendhal” inspires a need for more radical forms of association: “Actual fathers and sons and their relationships may thematize the Œdipal figure, but it is not confined to such literal enactments. The functions of Father, Son migrate in devious paradoxical ways” (153–54). One of these paternal migrations might be the fraternal pair. In “Body Bildung and Textual Liberation,” A New History of French Literature, ed. Denis Hollier (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989), Miller compares Stendhal’s Fabrice and Mosca to Balzac’s Vautrin and Lucien and their homoerotic “relation between the younger and older man” (684).\n\n23. Shoshana Felman writes that “intoxication is ambiguous … [w]ine in La Chartreuse is not only the key to a world of ecstasy; it is also used as a weapon” (225).\n\n24. Brombert argues that Fabrice’s head wound at Waterloo represents a “beneficent bloodletting” or “a special therapy destined to cure Fabrice of his illusions” (Pearson, 100). Descotes writes that “the escapades of this hero opened his eyes to the vanity of illusions; dreams of military glory do not survive their contact with reality: exaltation on the field of battle and solidarity between soldiers are only delusions” (174).\n\n25. Later made famous by the title character in Bertolt Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children (1938–39), the camp-following women known as cantinières (“canteen women”) or vivandières (“supply women”) were sutlers or victualers who played enormously important roles in Napoleonic warfare as nurses, supply clerks, seamstresses, cooks, prostitutes, lovers, wives, mothers, and even combatants. For more on vivandières, cantinières, women warriors, and other contributions by women to Napoleonic warfare, see Chapters 6 and 9.\n\n26. Stendhal, La Chartreuse de Parme, 52–53. In French, Aubry congratulates Fabrice by assuring him that “tu es un bon b …, ” a likable bougre or “bugger.” Amid the macho clichés and homoerotic references in Aubry’s vulgar vocabulary, these words signal his approval and even affection for the newly initiated Fabrice.\n\n27. Stendhal, La Chartreuse de Parme, 53. In Aubry’s colorful French, he says, “Va te faire f … toi et tous les généraux.” Unlike his vulgar “b …” (bougre, “bugger”), which he uses as a term of affection for Fabrice, Aubry’s “f …” (foutre, “fuck”) is meant—along with his disrespectful use of the informal te and toi—as a clear insult to the general. One might also speculate that the proximity of Stendhal’s references to the word “b …” and to the general known as the Count “B***” implies that the incompetent general is a bougre, in the less affectionate sense.\n\n28.

Among other interpretations of Stendhal’s “Happy Few,” Brombert speaks of “a code of honor that freely binds human beings capable of mutual esteem” (Pearson, 104). Bersani writes about “that elite audience Stendhal is addressing” and “the Happy Few who make up the strictly literary salon of Stendhal and his audience” (92, 139). InStendhal’s Violin: A Novelist and His Reader (Oxford: Clarendon, 1988), Roger Pearson argues “the Happy Few constitute a kind of aristocracy of taste” (5–6).\n\n30. In Stendhal’s Violin, Pearson explains how critics from Martineau, Del Litto, and Blin to Prévost, Brombert, and Starobinski have variously attributed the “Happy Few” to Stendhal’s sense of wish fulfillment, sublimation, revenge, victory, masochism, and authorial power (5–8).\n\n31. Stendhal, Œuvres intimes, 1: 167.\n\n32. Stendhal, Œuvres intimes, 2: 536–37. In Stendhal’s Violin, Pearson writes, “Stendhal often predicted that he would find his true readers only at a later time.

In his discussion of the Peninsular Wars in Napoleon Bonaparte (New York: HarperCollins, 1997), Alan Schom writes that “there were reports of captured French soldiers having their eyes and tongues cut out, or being castrated … while others had fingers, hands, arms, and legs chopped off. Soldiers and female collaborators were tortured and disemboweled. The women … were eviscerated from the navel to the vagina and their breasts hacked off” (552). Other forms of torture, Schom reports, included burying, burning, and boiling soldiers alive (453–87, 550–76).\n\n2. Adèle Hugo, Victor Hugo raconté par Adèle Hugo, ed.

In Victor Hugo (New York: Norton, 1997), Graham Robb recounts how in 1807 Italy, Léopold Hugo “had the boys signed up as members of his regiment … which enabled Victor Hugo to describe himself, years later, as a soldier since childhood” (22, 29–40).\n\n7. Hugo’s poetry reflects his political development and evolving attitudes toward Napoleon: from a disillusioned Napoleonic veteran to a confirmed royalist and Bourbon legitimist to a nostalgic neo-Bonapartist to a fervent anti-Napoleonic republican, exile, and opponent of Napoleon III.

Yves Gohin, vol. 1 (Paris: Gallimard-Folio, 1995), 415. Hugo traveled to Waterloo in May 1861 to see the battlefield. In the opening of his Waterloo episode, Hugo explains, “I do not pretend to write a history of Waterloo here … this history has been masterfully written elsewhere from the point of view of both Napoleon and a constellation of historians” (1: 414–15). Despite this disclaimer, Hugo nevertheless presents a grand and totalizing vision of the battle and its consequences for both France and Europe.\n\n10. Hugo begins his Waterloo account as an 1861 “witness” of the scars left by the 1815 battle: “Last year, on a beautiful day in May, a passerby—he who recounts this story—arrived from Nivelles and made his way for La Hulpe. He went on foot” (1: 403). A half-century later, the narrator reconstructs the battle as an investigating tourist, with the help of local witnesses and guides. Without any direct memories of his own, Hugo reconstructs the battle from the physical evidence inscribed onto the battlefield and its ruins.\n\n11. Despite its narrative unity, Les Misérables could be described as five novels: Part 1, Fantine; Part 2, Cosette; Part 3, Marius; Part 4, L’Idylle rue Plumet et l’épopée rue Saint-Denis; and Part 5, Jean Valjean. Inserted between Parts 1 and 2, Hugo’s Waterloo episode underscores the epic weight of triple defeat: Fantine’s death and Valjean’s arrest (at the end of Fantine) and Napoleon’s downfall (at the opening of Cosette).\n\n12. In “Histoire, épopée et roman: Les Misérables à Waterloo,” Revue d’histoire littéraire de la France 75 (1975), Roland Desné disagrees with the notion of digression. In contrast to “claims that Hugo arbitrarily added an epic fresco to his novel, either because he had a Waterloo waiting in his briefcase, or because he could not contain his imagination” (323), Desné argues that Hugo’s Waterloo is an integral episode in the novel. Desné disagrees with Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly, who wrote in 1862 that Hugo’s Waterloo was a “disproportionate hors d’œuvre,” with André Lagarde and Laurent Michard, who claimed in 1957 that “the connection between this episode and the rest of the novel is rather loose,” and with Michel Butor who argued in 1964 that Hugo’s Waterloo “cut up the narrative completely” (quoted in Desné, 321). For more on the similarities between Napoleon and Valjean, see the detailed discussion later in the chapter.\n\n13. In Victor Hugo and the Visionary Novel (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984), Victor Brombert argues that, unlike the novel’s digressions on sewers, convents, and bishops, Hugo’s Waterloo “may well be the most provocative digression in all of Hugo’s fiction. Tangential as it seems, no digression could be more central” (87). In 1860, Hugo wrote that he considered opening the entire novel with “[p]erhaps Waterloo, begin there—the great epic account mixed with the novel”; Victor Hugo, Œuvres complètes, ed. Jean Massin, vol. 12 (Paris: Club Français du Livre, 1967–70), 1502, quoted in Brombert 257 n. 1. Les Misérables begins quite literally with the phrase “In 1815” (1: 35) and—after the novel’s first digression on the Bishop of Digne—with the 1815 release of Jean Valjean from prison. Brombert argues that Hugo’s Waterloo also represents the novel’s conclusion, since Hugo completed Les Misérables while visiting Waterloo in 1861 (87).\n\n14. The year 1815 is an important hinge on which the novel swings, a date which marks the end of Napoleon and the beginning of Les Misérables. Both of them born in 1769, Napoleon and Valjean also share a common—if inverse—trajectory. While Napoleon began his meteoric rise to power with the Italian Campaign in 1796, Valjean was sentenced to five years in prison that year for stealing bread to feed his family. From 1796 to 1815, while Napoleon conquers Europe, Valjean serves a nineteen-year sentence, the same amount of time that Hugo spent in exile during the Second Empire (Brombert, 89). In 1815, as Napoleon is exiled, Valjean is released from Toulon. While Napoleon is held captive on St. Helena (1815–21), Valjean thrives as a businessman, mayor, and benefactor. When Napoleon dies in 1821, Valjean is arrested by Javert and imprisoned again. This chiastic structure posits Valjean as Napoleon’s alter ego: as Napoleon rises, Valjean falls; as the Emperor fails, Valjean thrives.\n\n15. In Gavroche: études sur Les Misérables (Paris: SEDES, 1994), Pierre Laforgue argues that Hugo’s placement of the Waterloo episode has an interior coherence: “From the beginning of the novel, there is a confusion between fiction and history: the title of this part is Cosette, but its first book is titled Waterloo … The beginning thus comes after the beginning: by this complex process, which mixes analepsis and anachronism, Hugo … reinscribes the novel, in a quite spectacular manner, into his historical material” (57). In “Prisons et exils: où sont allés les héros de Waterloo?” Nineteenth Century French Studies 2.1–2 (1994–95), Janice Best similarly argues that within Hugo’s “time-space referential,” the Waterloo episode is not a digression but “a place where past and future fuse, the limits of traditional narrative are broken, [and] the novel becomes, as Victor Brombert said so well, ‘visionary’ “ (90).\n\n16. Hugo attributes Napoleon’s defeat to God: “If it had not rained during the night of 17 to 18 June 1815, the future of Europe would have been different. Several drops of water more or less toppled Napoleon. Providence needed just a little rain to make Austerlitz end with Waterloo” (1: 412–13). Since the rain had muddied the field and made artillery movement difficult, Napoleon hesitated, allowing the Prussians more time to arrive and reinforce the English. Victor Brombert points out that “Disintegration in its diverse manifestations (flowing, melting, thawing, vanishing) is the chief image for the catastrophe of Waterloo” (93).\n\n17. For Hugo, Napoleon’s waterlogged Waterloo represents divine intervention: “In the battle of Waterloo, there are more than clouds, there are meteors. God has passed by” (1: 499). Napoleon is thus defeated by God himself: “Was it possible for Napoleon to win this battle? I say no. Why? Because of Wellington? Because of Blücher? No. Because of God” (1: 436).\n\n18. In Visions of War in France: Fiction, Art, Ideology (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1999), Catharine Savage Brosman argues that—unlike Hugo’s epic Waterloo—Stendhal’s Waterloo provides “no overview … no totalization” (96).\n\n19. Hugo describes the movement of French, English, and Prussian troops at Waterloo (and the location of the surrounding towns of Nivelles, Genappe, Braine-l’Alleud, Ohain, and Mont-Saint-Jean) as a map that could be drawn along the axes of a large diagrammatic “A” (1: 415–16). Just as Hugo simplifies these battle positions at Waterloo into a cartographic “A,” his structural move (from epic to individual, broad to pointed) inverts this structure into a diagrammatic “V.”\n\n20. As Brombert points out (108–12), Cambronne’s “merde” in 1815 presages the future when Valjean will save Marius from combat on the barricades in 1832 by wading through the sludge of the Paris sewers. In “Jean Valjean: réalisme et irréalisme des Misérables,” in Lire Les Misérables, ed. Anne Ubersfeld and Guy Rosa (Paris: José Corti, 1985), Guy Rosa similarly describes the novel as “a great literary sewer,” which reflects good and evil, heaven and hell, vice and virtue: “For if misery is the inverse and exterior of society … then misery is as much on the top as the bottom … The sewer, which is the underside of the city just as slang is the underside of language, is both mire and gold” (235–37).\n\n21. Roland Desné argues that “Cambronne’s word is the hyphen between 1793 and 1832,” the soiled period between France’s struggles for republican democracy (327). While nineteenth-century critics such as Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and Alphonse de Lamartine criticized Hugo for citing Cambronne’s vulgar “merde,” Desné applauds Cambronne’s courage in throwing merde in the face of defeat, and in distinguishing between the offensive word and the more offensive violence that it represents (325).\n\n22. Hugo calls Cambronne “the misérable of words” (Œuvres complètes 9: 281). Guy Robert, ‘Chaos Vaincu’: quelques remarques sur l’œuvre de Victor Hugo, vol. 2 (Paris: Belles Lettres, 1976), 97–98; Desné, 325.\n\n23. Victor Hugo, “L’Expiation,” in Œuvres poétiques, 2: 139.\n\n24. Burial alive is a recurring theme in Les Misérables. Prefiguring the Ohain trench and Hougomont well, Hugo describes Valjean’s misery as a kind of conscious drowning under “L’Onde et l’Ombre” (1: 149–51). Later, Valjean clandestinely escapes from the Petit Picpus convent in a coffin, is almost buried alive “Entre Quatre Planches” (1: 707–9), and fakes his own death by drowning to escape the prisoner transport ship L’Orion (1: 487–89). Referring to what Victor Brombert calls Hugo’s “recurrent terror of being buried alive” (128), Yves Gohin speaks—in his notes to the 1995 Gallimard edition—of this “recurring image of engulfment” as an “obsessive Hugolian fear” (1: 148 n. 1, 468 n. 1).\n\n25. Pierre Laforgue argues that Hugo’s notion of “residue” is a recurring metaphor for misery: “The sewer is residue, in the sense that it cynically preserves—[as] the ‘conscience of the city’—all or part of what is thrown in there” (135). As misérables, Valjean, Fantine, Cosette, Marius, and Gavroche are treated like human refuse by the Restoration and July Monarchy. Laforgue argues that “[t]he world of Les Misérables is also an abyss” where “[i]mages of drainage dominate with those of degradation” and all is “reduced to a kind of irreversible entropy” (137).\n\n26. In his will, Colonel Pontmercy writes, “To my son. The Emperor made me a baron on the field of battle at Waterloo. Since the Restoration refuses me this title which I earned with my blood, my son will take and assume it. It goes without saying that he will be worthy of it” (1: 794).\n\n27.

It mattered little that the Egyptian Campaign was a military disaster, that (unlike Hannibal and his elephants) Bonaparte had crossed the Alps on a donkey, or that (apart from France’s trade missions in Pondichéry and environs) India would be colonized not by Napoleon but by his arch-rivals the English.

Victor Hugo, “Ode à la colonne de la place Vendôme,” in Œuvres poétiques, 1: 395–400. Published in 1827, Hugo’s Vendôme ode celebrates the Vendôme column that was erected by Napoleon between 1806 and 1810. Inspired by Trajan’s column in Rome, it was cast with the bronze of enemy cannon from the French victory against the Austrians at Austerlitz in 1805. Desecrated in 1815 by the Restoration, which ordered the removal of Napoleon’s statue on top, the column remained on the Place Vendôme as a tribute to the victories of France. Hugo’s ode was inspired by a scandalous incident in January 1827 during a reception at the Austrian Embassy in Paris, where four of Napoleon’s marshals were announced by their family names (Oudinot, Soult, Macdonald, and Mortier) instead of the ennobled titles (Ducs de Reggio, Dalmatie, Tarente, Trévise) that had been given to them by Napoleon for their victory over the Austrians. Outraged by this affront to his family’s own Napoleonic past, Hugo composed his Vendôme ode, in which he praises the monument as the glorious “Debris of the Great Empire and the Grande Armée” (395). Referring to his own military childhood, Hugo writes, “And I should be silent! / I, who used to hear my name amid cries of war! / I, who followed the flight of a triumphant flag! / Who, joining my voice to the trumpets / Had the golden tassel of a sword as my first toy! / I, who was a soldier when I was a child!” (400). Speaking as a Napoleonic veteran, Hugo honors veterans like his father whose death the following year in 1828 may have also contributed to his Bonapartist nostalgia.\n\n30. In “Le Tombeau de Gavroche ou Magnitudo Parvuli,” in Lire Les Misérables, ed. Anne Ubersfeld and Guy Rosa (Paris: José Corti, 1985), Jacques Seebacher argues that “the child sheltered in the elephant reverses exteriority and interiority. From the bourgeois religion of utility, this little boy represents a return to the ‘idea’ of Napoleon the Great, in a ‘biblical belly of the whale’ … The tightfisted economic regime of Louis-Philippe is contrasted here with Napoleon’s great projects of expansion” (197–98). Laforgue adds that “by installing Gavroche in the elephant, Hugo transcends Napoleonic history and … writes the novel of misery” (72).\n\nChapter 6. An Army of Bachelors\n\n1.

Born in 1788, Elzéar Blaze trained at the military academy of Fontainebleau before joining Napoleon’s armies in 1807 and serving as a lieutenant and then captain during the campaigns in Prussia (1807), Austria (1808–9), Spain (1811–12), Saxony (1813), and France (1814). Following his Napoleonic career and an attempt to remain in military service after 1815, Captain Blaze retired and later published his memoirs, La Vie militaire sous l’Empire, in 1837.\n\n3.

Many scholars argue that Napoleon was murdered by arsenic poisoning on St. Helena in 1821. Since Montholon had the financial motive and ample opportunity, he seems to be the most likely suspect, though he never received the millions of francs bequeathed to him in Napoleon’s will.

Despite the insensitivity of these terms in twenty-first-century French and English, disabled veterans in nineteenth-century France were often referred to as invalides (invalids or the invalidated) and mutilés de guerre (the mutilated of war).\n\n10. In La Société militaire de 1815 à nos jours (Paris: Perrin, 1998), Raoul Girardet writes that Napoleonic veterans were thus “the last representatives of a world that was crumbling” amid a new regime that began to “repudiate the military exaltation of the preceding period” (13).\n\n11.

In The French Veteran: From the Revolution to the Restoration (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1979), Isser Woloch documents the material, social, and political challenges facing Napoleonic veterans. I owe much of the historical material in this section to Woloch’s veteran expertise, especially his discussion of veteran life on pages 3–24, 78–100, 206–79, 292–304.\n\n16. Despite its limited coverage, Choiseul’s pension plan created what Woloch calls “a new social type to French society, the pensioned ex-soldier” (7).\n\n17. Woloch, 11, 78–100, 232–46, 262–66.\n\n18.

Even though Napoleon’s army numbered over 600,000 during the invasion of Russia in 1812, Woloch reports that there were only “118,000 veterans collecting pensions in 1815, and a total of approximately 150,000 pensioned veterans in the entire course of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars” (206). Since many veterans did not qualify for pensions, the total number of veterans was potentially much higher.\n\n21. Woloch, 297–99.\n\n22. From his investigation of the crime rate among veterans during the Restoration, Woloch reports that “the records of the Paris police constables, the military police, and the [Invalides] administration indicate that public disturbances, drunkenness, brawling, and insults were the most common infractions for which the invalides were disciplined or arrested” (279).\n\n23. In Napoleon: le pouvoir, la nation, la légende (Paris: Livre de Poche, 1997), Jean Tulard writes that the Napoleonic legend was born during the Restoration among the ranks of discontented veterans, “particularly the officers reduced to half-pay and a routine and miserable life after so much glory; the legend was born out of the restrictions placed on them at the beginning of the Restoration against speaking and praising the fallen Emperor” (97). In Les Demi-solde: étude d’une catégorie sociale (Paris: Marcel Rivière, 1955), Jean Vidalenc argues, however, that this image has been exaggerated and that many Napoleonic veterans submitted to the Bourbon Restoration “out of conviction, calculation, or resignation” (quoted in Woloch, 300).\n\n24. Woloch calls this wistful Bonapartism a “nostalgic regret for more exciting times” (300–301).\n\n25. Jean Tulard, Napoléon ou le mythe du sauveur (Paris: Fayard, 1977), 449.\n\n26.

In addition to their roles as monarchs, diplomats, and writers, women made incalculable contributions to Napoleonic warfare as camp-followers, prostitutes, soldiers, wives, and widows. For an extended discussion of women and the Napoleonic Wars, see Blond, 19–25, 244–45; and Jean-Claude Damamme, Les Soldats de la Grande Armée (Paris: Perrin, 1998), 118–33. Like the vivandière who saves Stendhal’s Fabrice at Waterloo, a cantinière known as Marie-Tête-de-Bois (Stubborn Marie) served in seventeen campaigns between 1805 and 1815 (Damamme, 129). Like a woman nicknamed “Madame-Quarante-Milles-Hommes” (Madame Forty-Thousand-Men) who died miserably of syphilis after eight years as a military prostitute between 1804 and 1812 (Blond, 25), many wartime women were savaged by sexual exploitation and violence, including, as Schom writes, the “thousands of old women and young girls raped by [the] Grande Armée” (789). Silenced during the Empire, war prostitutes were later honored as resistance fighters and patriots in Maupassant’s Boule de suif (1880) and Le Lit 29 (1884). In the great tradition of French women warriors stretching back to Jeanne d’Arc, some women served as soldiers, fighting alongside their male comrades in masculine military drag. An orphan named Thérèse Figueur served in Napoleon’s armies from the siege of Toulon (1793) to the battles of Austerlitz and Iéna (1805–6), before being captured by the English (Damamme, 131–33). For more on the women warriors known as pétroleusesandAmazones de la Seine, who fought during the Paris Commune in 1871, see Françoise Giroud, Les Françaises de la Gauloise à la pilule (Paris: Fayard, 1999); Michelle Perot, Les Femmes ou le silence de l’Histoire (Paris: Flammarion, 1998); and Martin Phillip Johnson, “Citizenship and Gender: The Légion des Fédérées in the Paris Commune of 1871,” French History 8.3 (1994): 276–95. Despite their extraordinary sacrifices and service, military wives, widows, and their children received little to no assistance from the state. Veterans who retired to the Invalides could not bring their wives since, as Woloch explains, “women did not fit smoothly into the institution’s design” (272–78). This astute observation characterizes the French military’s overall institutional misogyny during the first half of the nineteenth century. Despite their immeasurable contributions, military women received little recognition, remuneration, or compensation. For more on Napoleonic women warriors, see Chapters 4 and 9.\n\n34. Serman explains that “at least two out of every hundred officers are punished … for concubinage. Several have been disciplined, forced to resign … or sentenced to prison” (181).\n\n35.

In The Soldiers of the French Revolution (Durham: Duke University Press, 1990), Alan Forrest documents the Revolution’s attempt in 1793 to undo restrictions on military marriage: “soldiers obtained a further right, much prized as a symbol of freedom, when they were allowed to marry witho"
