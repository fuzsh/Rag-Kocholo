Fusilier regiments wore bearskin caps. The two rifle regiments wore dark green jackets.\n\nBritish heavy cavalry wore red tunics and roman-style crested helmets. The British light cavalry wore either the light blue of light dragoons or hussar uniforms of shabrach, dolman and busby.\n\nThe Royal Horse Guards and Royal Artillery wore blue tunics.\n\nThe Royal Horse Artillery wore blue uniforms with the old light dragoon style crested helmet.\n\nHighland regiments wore the kilt with red tunics and tall black ostrich feather caps.\n\nThe King’s German Legion (KGL) was the Hanoverian army in exile. The KGL owed its allegiance to King George III of Great Britain, as the Elector of Hanover, and fought with the British army. The KGL comprised both cavalry and infantry regiments. KGL uniforms mirrored the British, as did the regiments of the re-constituted Hanoverian army.\n\nBelgians and Dutch wore dark blue.\n\nThe Brunswickers wore black uniforms.\n\nThe French army wore a variety of uniforms. The basic infantry uniform was dark blue.\n\nThe French cavalry comprised Cuirassiers, wearing heavy burnished metal breastplates and crested helmets, Dragoons, largely in green, Hussars, in the conventional uniform worn by this arm across Europe, and Chasseurs à Cheval, dressed as hussars.\n\nThe Grenadiers of the Guard wore the characteristic tall bearskin that the British Foot Guards were to adopt after the battle.\n\nThe French foot artillery wore uniforms similar to the infantry, the horse artillery wore hussar uniforms.\n\nThe standard infantry weapon across all the armies was the muzzle-loading musket. The musket could be fired three or four times a minute, throwing a heavy ball inaccurately for a hundred metres or so. Each infantryman carried a bayonet for hand-to-hand fighting, which fitted the muzzle end of his musket.\n\nThe British rifle battalions (60th and 95th Rifles) carried the Baker rifle, a more accurate weapon but slower to fire, and a sword bayonet.\n\nField guns fired a ball projectile, of limited use against troops in the field unless those troops were closely formed. Guns also fired case shot or canister which fragmented and was highly effective against troops in the field over a short range. Exploding shells fired by howitzers, yet in their infancy. were of particular use against buildings. The British were developing shrapnel (named after the British officer who invented it) which increased the effectiveness of exploding shells against troops in the field, by exploding in the air and showering them with metal fragments.\n\nThroughout the Peninsular War and the Waterloo campaign, the British army was plagued by a shortage of artillery. The Army was sustained by volunteer recruitment and the Royal Artillery was not able to recruit sufficient gunners for its needs.\n\nNapoleon exploited the advances in gunnery technology of the last years of the French Ancien Régime, to create his powerful and highly mobile artillery. Many of his battles were won using a combination of the manoeuvrability and fire power of the French guns, with the speed of French columns of infantry, supported by the mass of French cavalry.\n\nProvided the infantry were able to form square, they were largely impervious to cavalry attack, as neither the British nor the French cavalry horses could be brought to ride through an unbroken infantry line and the infantry could not be attacked in flank.\n\nWhile the French conscript infantry moved about the battle field in fast moving columns, the British trained to fight in line. The Duke of Wellington reduced the number of ranks to two, to extend the line of the British infantry and to exploit fully the firepower of his regiments.\n\nBritish Regiments present at the Battle of Waterloo:\n\nRoyal Horse Artillery\n\n1st Life Guards now the Life Guards\n\n2nd Life Guards now the Life Guards\n\nRoyal Horse Guards now the Blues and Royals\n\nKing’s Dragoon Guards now the Queen’s Dragoon Guards\n\nRoyal Dragoons now the Blues and Royals\n\nRoyal Scots Greys now the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards\n\n6th Inniskilling Dragoons later the 5th Inniskilling Dragoon Guards and now the Royal Dragoon Guards\n\n7th Hussars later the Queen’s Own Hussars and now the Queen’s Royal Hussars\n\n10th Hussars later the Royal Hussars and now the King’s Royal Hussars\n\n11th Hussars later the Royal Hussars and now the King’s Royal Hussars\n\n12th Light Dragoons now the 9th/12th Lancers\n\n13th Light Dragoons later the 13th/18th King’s Royal Hussars and now the Light Dragoons\n\n15th Light Dragoons later the 15th/19th Hussars and now the Light Dragoons\n\n16th Light Dragoons later the 16th/5th Lancers and now the Queen’s Royal Lancers\n\n18th Light Dragoons later the 13th/18th King’s Royal Hussars and now the Light Dragoons\n\n23rd Light Dragoons (disbanded)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\n1st Foot Guards now the Grenadier Guards\n\n2nd Coldstream Guards\n\n3rd Foot Guards now the Scots Guards\n\n1st Foot later the Royal Scots now the Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\n4th King’s Own Regiment of Foot later the King’s Own Royal Border Regiment now the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment\n\n14th Foot later the West Yorkshire Regiment later the Prince of Wales’s Own Regiment of Yorkshire now the Yorkshire Regiment\n\n23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers now the Royal Welsh\n\n27th Foot, the Inniskilling Fusiliers and now the Royal Irish Regiment\n\n28th Foot later the Gloucestershire Regiment and now the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment now the Rifles\n\n30th Foot later the East Lancashire Regiment later the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment now the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment\n\n32nd Foot later the Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry later the Light Infantry now the Rifles\n\n33rd Foot the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment now the Yorkshire Regiment\n\n40th Foot later the South Lancashire Regiment later the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment now the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment\n\n42nd Highlanders later the Black Watch (the Royal Highland Regiment) now the Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\n44th Foot later the Essex Regiment and now the Royal Anglian Regiment\n\n51st Light Infantry later the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry later the Light Infantry now the Rifles\n\n52nd Light Infantry later the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry later the Royal Green Jackets now the Rifles\n\n69th Foot later the Welsh Regiment and now the Royal Regiment of Wales\n\n71st Highland Light Infantry later the Royal Highland Fusiliers now the Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\n73rd Highlanders the Black Watch now the Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\n79th Highlanders later the Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders, later the Queen’s Own Highlanders now the Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\n92nd Highlanders the Gordon Highlanders now the Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\n95th Rifles later the Rifle Brigade later the Royal Green Jackets now the Rifles\n\n15.

John Mackenzie’s Britishbattles.com podcast.\n\nBackground to the Battle of Waterloo:\n\nIn 1814, twenty-five years of war came to an end with the surrender of the Emperor Napoleon and his banishment to the Mediterranean island of Elba. The European powers began the task of restoring their continent to normality and peace. The Bourbons resumed their interrupted reign in France with King Louis XVIII.\n\nOn 1st March 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and landed in France. Nineteen days later, Napoleon was in Paris and resumed his title of Emperor. Napoleon’s army rallied to him. The many French soldiers, captured during the years of fighting up to 1814 and now released, enabled Napoleon to reform his powerful Grande Armée.\n\nThe European allies reassembled their armies and prepared to resume the war to overthrow the Emperor yet again.\n\nNapoleon resolved to attack the British, Prussian, Belgian and Dutch armies before the other powers could come to their assistance. He marched into the area that is now Belgium.\n\nNapoleon defeated the Prussians, under Marshall Blücher, at the Battle of Ligny on 16th June 1815, driving the Prussians away to the east.\n\nOn the same day, Marshal Ney fought the Battle of Quatre Bras against troops of the Duke of Wellington’s allied army, forcing Wellington to fall back towards Brussels.\n\nNapoleon sent Marshal Grouchy in pursuit of the Prussians, while he advanced on Wellington’s army.\n\nAssured by Blücher that the Prussians would join him for the conclusive battle against Napoleon, Wellington, on the afternoon of 17th June 1815, halted his army to give battle to the French.\n\nThe Duke of Wellington took up a position on the Brussels road, where it emerges from the woods of Soignies, south of the village of Waterloo. The road crosses a low ridge, behind which Wellington positioned his army facing south, and descends into a valley before rising on the other side to a further ridge. In the valley, below the first crest, lay La Haye Sante Farm and on the road at the southern side of the valley, below the second crest, stood La Belle Alliance Farm.\n\nDuring most of the Battle of Waterloo, the Germans occupied La Haye Sante and the French used La Belle Alliance as a headquarters.\n\nTo the north of the first crest, the Namur road crossed the Brussels road. The main British, German, Belgian and Dutch positions lay along the Namur road, behind the first crest. The French approach to the battle was from the country to the South of La Belle Alliance and across the valley.\n\nIn the valley to the front of the right wing of the Allied line, stood Hougoumont Farm, the key to Wellington’s right flank. Held by the light companies of the British Coldstream and Third Guards, there would be fighting around Hougoumont all day during the battle.\n\nLying by the road leading to the centre of Wellington’s position, the capture of La Haye Sante was a crucial goal for the French army.\n\nTo the east of the Duke’s army lay Papelotte, another farm that would be the centre of a ferocious struggle, particularly as the Prussian Army appeared on the field at the end of the battle.\n\nIn the Duke’s centre stood the farm of Mont St Jean, used as a headquarters and hospital.\n\nIt rained heavily during the night of 17th June 1815. The French artillery commanders insisted to Napoleon that the French attack did not begin until the ground had dried out sufficiently for the guns to manoeuvre without sticking in the mud.\n\nThe French attack began at 11am on 18th June 1815.\n\nAccount of the Battle of Waterloo:\n\nAt 11am on 18th June 1815, the French bombardment of Hougoumont Farm, on the extreme right of the Allied line, began the battle. The British artillery on the ridge behind the farm replied, cannonading the French infantry massed for the attack on the far side of the valley.\n\nAt midday, Prince Jerome ordered the assault on Hougoumont and the French infantry columns of his division moved forward to begin the day long struggle around the farm buildings.\n\n15. Podcast of the Battle of Waterloo: the battle fought on 18thJune 1815 that ended the dominance of the French Emperor Napoleon over Europe and saw the end of an epoch. John Mackenzie’s Britishbattles.com podcast.\n\nAt about 1.30pm, Marshal Ney brought forward 74 French guns over the ridge opposite La Haye Sante, followed by the 17,000 infantry of D’Erlon’s corps, to begin the attack on the Duke of Wellington’s centre and left.\n\nThe French cannonade began and was later described by Allied veterans as the heaviest they had experienced. The Duke ordered his infantry battalions to move back behind the ridge and to lie down. This had the effect of shielding them from the worst of the cannonade. Only Bilandt’s Belgian-Dutch Brigade was left on the exposed slope and suffered heavily.\n\nAfter half an hour, the barrage stopped, giving way to the roar of drums as Ney’s columns advanced to the attack.\n\nThe French infantry passed La Haye Sante and marched up to the crest of the ridge, where Picton’s 5th division was positioned.\n\nAs part of the French advance, a furious assault began on La Haye Sante, held by the King’s German Legion, which was to continue intermittently for the rest of the day, until the German troops ran out of ammunition and were finally overwhelmed.\n\nAs the French infantry approached the hedge at the top of the ridge, the line of British infantry stood up, fired a volley and charged, driving back the massed French columns.\n\nAllied Cavalry formations, mostly British regiments, were ordered to charge in support of the infantry attack; the Household Brigade (1st and 2nd Life Guards and Royal Horse Guards), the Union Brigade (Royals, Scots Greys and Inniskillings) and Vivian’s Hussar Brigade (10th and 18th Hussars and 1st Hussars, King’s German Legion).\n\nIt is notoriously difficult to pull up cavalry committed to a charge, and the British regiments did not readily respond to recall orders. The Union Brigade continued to attack across the valley. These regiments charged up to the French gun line on the far ridge, where they were in turn overwhelmed by French cavalry.\n\nGeneral Ponsonby, commanding the Union Brigade was killed. It is of note that, of the three regiments in the Union Brigade, two, the Greys and Inniskillings, had not served in the Peninsular War and lacked battle experience.\n\nThe time was 3pm and there was a lull in the battle, the only active fighting being the continuing attack on Hougoumont at the western end of the line, sucking in more and more of Reille’s French corps.\n\nThe battle began slowly to swing in the Allies’ favour as Blücher’s Prussian Army arrived on the field in the south-east.\n\nNapoleon ordered Ney to capture La Haye Sante, considering the farm to be the key to the Allied position. Ney launched this assault with two battalions he found to hand and, during the operation, formed the view that the Allied army was withdrawing. It is likely that the movements he saw were casualties or prisoners moving to the rear.\n\nIt was on this impetuous assumption that Ney launched his massive cavalry attack on the Allied line.\n\nInitially the attacking force was Milhaud’s French Cavalry Corps of Cuirassiers.\n\nBefore the French could reach the Allied line, the infantry formed squares interlaced with artillery batteries. The French cuirassiers flowed around the squares, but were unable to penetrate them.\n\nDuring the next three hours, some twelve French cavalry attacks were made up to the ridge and back.\n\nNapoleon, while deprecating the initial attack as premature, felt bound to commit increasing numbers of cavalry to support the assault.\n\nAt around 5.30pm, Ney launched the final French cavalry charge. There were too many regiments, fresh mingled with exhausted. The attack failed yet again.\n\nNey now launched the sustained infantry assault on La Haye Sante, which was overwhelmed.\n\nThis success was too late to change the outcome of the battle, as the Prussian assault in the south-east, on Plancenoit, was seriously threatening the French position.\n\nSure that the Allied line was at breaking point, Ney sent desperately to the Emperor for more troops to attack.\n\nNapoleon was at this point deploying the Guard, to drive the Prussians back from Plancenoit. Once this had been achieved, Napoleon resolved to launch the Guard at the main Allied line.\n\nBy the time the Guard was available to carry out the attack on the ridge, Wellington had reorganised his forces, and the opportunity, that Ney had this time correctly identified, had passed.\n\nAs the Guard began its advance on the ridge, a deserting French cavalry officer galloped up to the Allied line and warned of the Guard’s approach.\n\nThe Guard marched up to La Belle Alliance, where Napoleon stood aside and left the command of the attack to Ney.\n\nNey led the five battalions up the left-hand side of the Brussels road. As they climbed the ridge, the columns came under fire from a curve of Allied batteries assembled to meet them.\n\nThe Middle Guard threw back the British battalions of Halkett’s Brigade, but were assaulted by the Belgian and Dutch troops of General Chassé and Colonel Detmers, who drove them back down the hill.\n\nThe 3rd Regiment of Chasseurs approached the ridge opposite Maitland’s Brigade of Foot Guards (2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 1st Foot Guards). Wellington called to the brigade commander ‘Now Maitland. Now’s your time’. One authority had Wellington saying ‘Up Guards, ready’. The 1st Foot Guards stood, fired a volley and charged with the bayonet, driving the French Guard back down the hill.\n\nThe last of the French Guard regiments, the 4th Chasseurs, came up in support as the British Guards withdrew over the ridge.\n\nSir John Colborne brought the 52nd Foot round to outflank the French column, as it passed his brigade, fired a destructive volley into the left flank of the Chasseurs and attacked with the bayonet. The whole of the Guard was driven back down the hill and the French army began a general retreat to the cry of ‘La Garde recule’.\n\nWithin fifteen minutes, Wellington appeared on the skyline and waved his hat to give the signal for a general attack in pursuit of the French troops. The British, Belgian, Dutch and German troops poured forward and the French retreat became a route.\n\nThree battalions of the Old Guard fought to the end, to enable the Emperor to escape from the battlefield, as the Allied troops including the Prussians closed in. General Cambronne is reputed to have answered a call to surrender with the words ‘The Guard dies but does not surrender’.\n\nThe Battle of Waterloo ended with an historic meeting between the Duke of Wellington and Marshal Blücher, who had kept his promise to Wellington to come to his assistance.\n\n15.

John Mackenzie’s Britishbattles.com podcast.\n\nThe Role of the Prussian Army under Marshal Blücher:\n\nThe effect of the Prussian attack on Napoleon’s right flank was decisive in enabling the Allies to win the Battle of Waterloo. The third map showing the position at 7pm on 18th June 1815 illustrates the effect of the Prussian assault on the French and the relief that it brought to the Allied army positioned along the ridge.\n\nThe British elevation of the Battle of Waterloo to the status of a national icon has resulted in many British accounts of the battle failing to do justice to the conduct at the battle of other nationalities forming the Allied army, particularly the contribution of the Prussian army.\n\nThe Battle of Waterloo could not have been won if Marshal Blücher had not fulfilled his promise to the Duke of Wellington and delivered his devastating attack on Napoleon’s right flank around Plancenoit.\n\nThe Battle of Waterloo: Hougoumont Château\n\nThe small château of Hougoumont stood before the extreme right of the Allied position. The Duke of Wellington formed the view that the château was the key to his flank, and garrisoned it with the light companies of the Coldstream and 3rd Foot Guards under Lieutenant Colonel James MacDonnell of the Coldstream Guards. Nassauers and guardsmen held the woods to the front of the building.\n\nThe British troops took over the range of château buildings on 17th June 1815 and spent the night fortifying them, building fire steps and loop holing the walls. All the gates were blocked, other than the main gate on the northern side to provide access.\n\nAt 11am on 18th June, Prince Jerome’s division began the battle with his attack on Hougoumont, the French driving the Nassauers out of the woods and attacking the château.\n\nThe French surged around the buildings and charged the main gate, in the face of a rush of British guardsmen, headed by Colonel MacDonnell, to keep them out. The entrance was damaged and there ensued a struggle by the British to shut the gate and by the French to force it open.\n\nColonel MacDonnell and his party of officers and sergeants forced the gate shut and Sergeant Graham of the Coldstream Guards put the bar in place. The few French soldiers who had penetrated the entrance were hunted through the farm buildings.\n\nDuring the rest of the day, Hougoumont was subject to sustained attack by Jerome’s troops, with assistance from a further French division. The château garrison was reinforced with more companies from the two Foot Guards battalions of Byng’s Guards Brigade, 2nd/2nd and 2nd/3rd Guards.\n\nWhen, during the afternoon the supply of ammunition in the château became critically low, Sergeant Fraser of the 3rd Guards went to the main line and returned with a wagon of cartridges, thereby enabling the defence to continue.\n\nBy the end of the battle, the château had been set ablaze by howitzer shells and the buildings were heaped with British casualties. The French were unable to capture Hougoumont, and their casualties filled the woods and fields around it.\n\nThe two battalions that defended Hougoumont suffered 500 dead and wounded out of a strength of 2,000 men.\n\nSome years after the Battle of Waterloo, an English clergyman bequeathed £500 to be given to the bravest Briton from the battle. The selection was referred to the Duke of Wellington, who nominated Lieutenant Colonel McDonnell of the Coldstream Guards, for his defence of the Château of Hougoumont. Colonel McDonnell gave half the sum to Sergeant Graham, the soldier who put the gate bar in place.\n\nAnnually, the Coldstream Guards celebrate the defence of Hougoumont, with the ceremony of the hanging of the brick.\n\n15.

John Mackenzie’s Britishbattles.com podcast.\n\nThe Battle of Waterloo: La Haye Sante Farm\n\nThe farm of La Haye Sante stands on the west side of the main Brussels road, beneath the ridge, two hundred metres in front of the centre of the Allied position. As the Emperor Napoleon urged on Marshal Ney, La Haye Sante was the key to the Allied line and had to be taken at all costs.\n\nThe garrison, to whom it fell to resist the French attack, that began soon after D’Erlon’s assault, was from Major Baring’s 2nd Light Battalion of Colonel Baron Ompteda’s 2nd King’s German Legion Brigade.\n\nThe King’s German Legion expected only to spend the night in the farm, and did not discover until the morning that they were required to hold it for the battle. By then, the main gates had been burnt on the soldiers’ camp fires and little could be done to put the farm in a state of defence in the short time before the battle began.\n\nThe KGL soldiers of the farm garrison were largely spectators as D’Erlon’s attack swept past and up the ridge to the main Allied position, to be pursued back to their lines by the British cavalry counter-attack.\n\nIt was then that Ney’s attack on the farm was launched, on the orders of the Emperor Napoleon. From that moment, the King’s German Legion troops fought for their lives until late in the afternoon, when, with their ammunition finished and the farm in flames, the garrison was annihilated or driven out. 39 of some 360 soldiers survived the battle.\n\nRoyal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo:\n\nAt around 2pm, Major General Ponsonby’s Union Brigade of heavy dragoons, 1st Royal Dragoons, 2nd Royal Scots Greys and 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, charged D’Erlon’s infantry columns as they reached the British line.\n\nAs the Greys passed the 92nd Gordon Highlanders, the Gordons attempted to advance with them, holding the trooper’ stirrups.\n\nThe charge built up momentum and the British ‘Heavies’ launched themselves on the French infantry, the Greys shouting ‘Scotland for ever’.\n\nSergeant Charles Ewart of the Greys rode at the officer of the 45th Infantry carrying the regimental standard, incorporating an Imperial Eagle at the top of the staff. Ewart cut down the four escorts and the standard bearer and bore the standard and eagle away.\n\nThe Union Brigade cut through the French infantry and, now out of control, continued the charge across the valley and up the far incline to the French guns, where they sabred a number of gunners.\n\nThe British cavalry were counter-attacked by French Lancers and suffered such heavy casualties as to eliminate the brigade from the battle. The brigade commander, General Ponsonby, was killed.\n\nAs the Duke of Wellington grumblingly complained, ‘the British cavalry never know when to stop charging’.\n\nThroughout this encounter, Ewart defended his captured French standard and eagle against repeated attacks by French cavalrymen, attempting to recover the lost emblem.\n\nThe Greys adopted the captured French eagle as the regiment’s badge. It is still the badge of the present regiment, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards.\n\nThe Emperor Napoleon is said to have commented of the regiment, ‘Ah ces terribles chevaux gris’.\n\nThe rest of the British Army wryly gave the Royal Scots Greys the nickname of ‘the Bird Catchers’.\n\nAfter the battle, Sergeant Ewart was promoted ensign. The capture of the eagle was a powerful image in Victorian Scotland. Ewart died in England in 1846. His remains were buried in Edinburgh Castle.\n\nCasualties at the Battle of Waterloo:\n\nThe British, Belgians, Dutch and Germans lost 15,000 casualties or 1 in 4 engaged. The Prussians lost 7,000 men killed and wounded. The casualties in the French army are estimated at 25,000 dead and wounded, 8,000 prisoners and 220 guns lost.\n\n15.

John Mackenzie’s Britishbattles.com podcast.\n\nFollow-up to the Battle of Waterloo:\n\nWaterloo decisively saw the end of 26 years of fighting between the European powers and France. The French star was eclipsed and the German began its ascendancy.\n\nFor Britain, Waterloo is not just a battle. It is an institution (as well as a station).\n\nDecorations and Battle Honours:\n\nThe Waterloo medal was issued to every officer and soldier who had taken part in the Battle of Waterloo, the Battle of Quatre Bras or the Battle of Ligny. In addition, two years seniority and pay was awarded. Each medal was inscribed with the recipient’s name around the rim.\n\nThe following British regiments received the battle honour of ‘Waterloo’: 1st and 2nd Life Guards, Royal Horse Guards, 1st King’ Dragoon Guards, 1st Royal Dragoons, 2nd Dragoons Royal Scots Greys, 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, 7th Queen’s Own Hussars, 10th Prince of Wales’s Own Royal Hussars, 11th Light Dragoons, 12th Light Dragoons, 13th Light Dragoons, 15th Hussars, 16th Light Dragoons, 18th Hussars, 1st Foot Guards, Coldstream Guards, 3rd Foot Guards, Royal Scots, 4th King’ Own, 14th Regiment, 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, 27th (Inniskiling) Regiment, 28th, 30th, 32nd, 33rd, 40th, 69th, 42nd Black Watch, 73rd Highlanders, 44th, 51st, 52nd Light Infantry, 71st Highlander Light Infantry, 79th Cameron Highlanders, 92nd Gordon Highlanders and 95th Rifles.\n\nAnecdotes and traditions from the Battle of Waterloo:\n\nThe Royal Dragoons captured the eagle of the French 105th of the Line, in the charge of the Union Brigade, and subsequently adopted the eagle as its badge. The eagle is now worn as an arm badge by the Blues and Royals, the successor regiment. As with the Greys the regiment was given the nickname of the ‘Bird catchers’.\n\nAfter the Battle of Waterloo, the 1st Foot Guards was given the title ‘the Grenadier Guards’, to commemorate the regiment’s role in overthrowing the French Grenadiers of the Old Guard. All ranks were given the bearskin cap to wear.\n\n14th Foot: The 3rd Battalion of the regiment fought at Waterloo. The battalion had been newly raised and was awaiting disbandment, having seen no service, when Napoleon escaped from Elba. The battalion crossed to Belgium and won the battle honour for the regiment. Most of the soldiers were under 20 years of age.\n\nThe Emperor Napoleon, some years before Waterloo, presented to each of his marshals a silver snuff box. Marshal Ney’s snuffbox was looted from his carriage after the battle by a British officer. Some years later the snuffbox was presented to the officers of the 19th Foot, the Green Howards, who used it in their mess for formal occasions.\n\nThe 27th Inniskilling Fusiliers, in the course of Ney’s cavalry attacks, was bombarded by a French horse artillery battery. By the end of the battle, the battalion had suffered 478 casualties from a pre-battle strength of 750. An officer from a nearby battalion, Captain Kincaid, commented that the 27th seemed to be lying dead in its square. Kincaid, a veteran of the Peninsular War, said ‘I had never thought there would be a battle where everyone was killed. This seemed to be it.’\n\nCorporal John Shaw of the 2nd Life Guards was a noted prize fighter and skilled swordsman. During the Regiment’s repeated charges at the Battle of Waterloo, Shaw was separated from his comrades and attacked by several French cuirassiers. Shaw is reputed to have killed ten of them, before being wounded by a colonel of cuirassiers. Shaw killed the colonel, fighting after his sword broke with his helmet as a bludgeon. Shaw crawled away and died during the night of his extensive injuries. Sir Walter Scott obtained a plaster cast of Shaw’s skull. The cast is now in the Household Cavalry Museum.\n\nThe 71st Highland Light Infantry captured a French cannon and fired the last shot of the Battle of Waterloo at the retreating French army.\n\nThe Duke of Wellington spent his early army service as the lieutenant colonel of the 33rd Foot. After the Duke’s death, Queen Victoria permitted the 33rd to adopt the title ‘the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment’, a fitting attribution for one of the army’s most persistently successful regiments of foot.\n\n79th Cameron Highlanders: As the French cavalry approached for the attack, the regiment formed square. Piper Mackay marched around the square playing the pibroch ‘Peace or War’. The King subsequently presented Mackay with silver mounted pipes as a reward.\n\nIn spite of their presence in the film ‘Waterloo’, the 88th Foot, Connaught Rangers, was not present at Waterloo. They were on the far side of the Atlantic fighting the Americans.\n\nThe 95th had three battalions at Waterloo. After the battle the regiment was given the title of the ‘Rifle Brigade’ in place of its number, which was reallocated to a newly raised infantry regiment.\n\nIn the closing moments of the battle, a cannon ball struck the Earl of Uxbridge as he rode with the Duke of Wellington. The Duke said ‘By God you’ve lost your leg.’ The Earl said ‘By God, so I have.’ The remains of the leg were amputated in a house nearby and the owner of the house buried the leg in his garden, a place of interest for some years.\n\nEvery year after 1815, the Duke of Wellington held a ‘Waterloo’ banquet for his officers. The banquet is still held.\n\nUmbrellas at the Battle of Waterloo: Captain Mercer of the British Horse Artillery described the miserable night he and his troop spent on the field of Waterloo before the battle: ‘My companion (the troop’s second captain) had an umbrella, which by the way afforded some merriment to our people on the march, this we planted against the sloping bank of the hedge, and seating ourselves under it, he on the one side of the stick, me on the other side, we lighted cigars and became-comfortable’.\n\nThe Duke, usually indifferent to the way his officers chose to dress, drew the line at umbrellas. ‘At Bayonne, in December 1814,’ wrote Captain Gronow of the 1st Foot Guards, ‘His Grace, on looking round, saw, to his surprise, a great many umbrellas, with which the officers protected themselves from the rain that was then falling. Arthur Hill came galloping up to us saying, Lord Wellington does not approve of the use of umbrellas during the enemy’s firing, and will not allow the ‘gentlemen’s sons’ to make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of the army.’ Colonel Tynling, a few days afterwards, received a wigging from Lord Wellington for suffering his officers to carry umbrellas in the face of the enemy; His Lordship observing, ‘The Guards may in uniform, when on duty at St. James’, carry umbrellas if they please, but in the field it is not only ridiculous but unmilitary.’ Standing orders for the army in the Peninsular War and in the Waterloo campaign stated categorically ‘Umbrellas will not be opened in the presence of the enemy.’ However, the surgeon of Captain Mercer’s troop of Horse Artillery was seen to be sheltering under the forbidden item during the early part of the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nBetween 1830 and 1838, Captain William Siborne, after extensive research with veterans from the battle, produced a model of the Battle of Waterloo as at 7pm on 17th June 1815. This model is in the National Army Museum in London.\n\nReferences for the Battle of Waterloo:\n\nHistory of the British Army by John Fortescue Volume 10\n\nBritish Battles on Land and Sea by James Grant Volume 2\n\nA Near Run Thing by David Howarth\n\nWellington by S.G.P.
