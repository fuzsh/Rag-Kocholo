        "text": "I am originally from Brazil, and now living in Houston, TX but I also have a setup in Los Angeles, CA\n\nWhen I was about 11 years old, I realized that music and specially rhythm was my passion. From those days of School Marching Bands, I never stopped pursuing my excellence in it. Born in Southern Brazil, I moved to Rio de Janeiro to study at Villa Lobos School of Music. Learned a lot going to neighborhood Samba Schools, and I also took private lessons in Rio and Bahia.\n\nIn the early 90’s moved to Los Angeles, CA, where I had the opportunity to perform and record with musicians from all over the world. An amazing learning experience! For family reasons went back to Brazil in 2005 and opened a recording studio and production company. Spent a few years back and forth between L.A., Rio and Natal (in Northeastern Brazil).\n\nIn 2013, I moved to Houston -TX, for a new and exciting chapter of musical adventures. New musical projects are being born out of my recording studio. Performances as World Music DJ, and educational projects for adults and kids are also happening.\n\nVisit my contact page or Facebook for more info.\n\nSOME PERFORMANCE CREDITS\n\nDJAVAN- Brazilian singer/songwriter, World Tour 1988-91\n\nDORI CAYMMI- Singer/songwriter; Qwest artist, 1992, 2001\n\nGAL COSTA – Brazilian superstar, international tour 2001/2002\n\nOSCAR CASTRO-NEVES – Composer/producer; JVC artist\n\nBALLET FOLKLORICO DO BRASIL – Music/Dance troupe which performs Brazilian cultural shows for schools, colleges and festivals in the US.\n\nCHAKA KHAN – Greek Theater , Los Angeles, 2002\n\nANGELIQUE KIDJO- Singer, songwriter from West Africa, acoustic tour West Coast, Aug. 1996\n\nDARIUSH -Iranian singer 2001/02/03\n\nGOOGOOSH – Female Singer, Star from Iran, World Tour 2000/01/02/03\n\nKEVYN LETTAU – Singer, songwriter, JVC artist, 1995, 1999\n\nIVAN LINS – Brazilian singer, songwriter, Southern California shows 1992-93\n\nLEILA FAROUHAR – Iranian singer, Kodak Theater, Los Angeles 2002\n\nTANIA MARIA – Brazilian jazz fusion piano player, singer/composer , 1992 tour\n\nSERGIO MENDES – Brazilian keyboard player and producer – Grammy winner.,1997\n\nNAHUALLI ENSEMBLE- Pre-Hispanic Flutes and World Percussion .
