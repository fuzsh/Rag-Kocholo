VIDEO, AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT • REACHING 110 COUNTRIES • MAY 16, 1998 MTV Europe, VPL Resolve Years-Long Licensing Dispute BY JEFF CLARK-MEADS LONDON — Europe's collecting societies — in all fields — have been brought back from the brink of a precipice. The settle- ment of a 6-year-old dispute between MTV Europe and the I'.K.'s Video Performance Ltd. (VPL) means that the prospect of collective licensing being out- lawed in the European Union has been re- moved.

As the company con- tinues to ramp up, Blackwell is already actively making deals, such as a potential acquisition of Rykodisc (Billboard, May 9), and negotiating with his former label, Island Records, to rerelease the seminal 1992 Bob Marley boxed set, \"Songs Of Freedom\" (see story, page 97). Islandlife is the par- ent company for a num- ber of entities, including Palm Pictures, a DVD, CD, and film company; Manga Entertainment, a Japanese animation theatrical, DVD, CD- ROM, and home video release com- pany, as well as a theatrical distrib- ution outlet for Palm Pictures; the music publishing company Blue Mountain Music; the licensing com- pany Bob Marley Music; the World Wide Web site www.islandlife.com; and Island Outpost, the hotel and recording studio division. Blackwell formed Islandlife earli- er this year, following his departure from PolyGram in November 1997. He had sold Island Records and Island Pictures to PolyGram in 1989. Among the top executives at Island- life are former Island executive VP Hooman Majd and Larry Mestel, pre- viously executive VP/COO at Island. \"We've spent the first few months after leaving PolyGram getting our company structure organized and working on getting our slate of music and video releases to- gether,\" says Mestel. \"The key here for us, which we want to try to get across to all of our employees, is that this is a company where employees don't neces- sarily work for one divi- sion; they w r ork for Islandlife. There are going to be people who use our hotel and resort business, and there will be times that business gives a boost to our entertainment division. It's a cross-pollination of ideas between every part of Islandlife.\" Many Islandlife and Palm Pictures staffers, some of whom worked with Blackwell for years, say having all the companies under one roof — and one owner — makes doing business easier. \"It feels almost like it was pre- PolyGram,\" says Suzette Newman, who heads Palm Pictures' London office and who has worked with Blackwell for more than 20 years. \"There's a lot less of a middle layer. It makes it easier to follow the vision. It's all about getting your hands dirty, and you couldn't do that when you had a parent company, because everyone had a specific role they had to follow.\" (Continued oil im\"I< '■''> Buddy Guy Looks To Expand Audience With Silvertune Set BY CHRIS MORRIS LOS ANGELES— Buddy Guy's new Silvertone album, \"Heavy Love,\" set for release June 2, aims to secure a fresh foothold for the blues singer/guitarist among younger listeners and R&B-oriented audiences.

Torrance, Calif.-based Wherehouse Entertainment is selling \"The Limited Series\" for $14.99 when consumers trade in five CDs. The set, released May a. is priced at $34.99 without the trade-ins. Surprisingly, Wherehouse's bold promo- tion is not generating public opposition from Brooks, Capitol Nashville, and competing retailers, many of whom are still angry over what they see as the set's low profit mar- gins. The Wherehouse promotion, called \"Get Garth For A Lot Less Green,\" is good until May 18. The chain will not accept promo- tional copies as part of the deal, and all trade-ins are subject to manager approval. The offer is good in all 220 Wherehouse locations, except for two Las Vegas stores where the sale of used CDs is prohibited. Originally, Brooks' label, Capitol Nash- ville, had set a $59.95 suggested retail price, but no minimum advertised price (MAP), for the set (Billboard, April 11). Several weeks ago, though, the label set a MAP of $27.85 and eliminated the suggested retail price. Capitol had also planned to press only 2 million copies of \"The Limited Series,\" but president Pat Quigley says the label has upped that to 2.5 million. \"Most retailers are going to be out of the title by Friday [May 8]. It's a monster,\" says Quigley. \"We've allowed retailers to place one reorder, but we're shutting down at 2.5 million orders. It's a big number for others, but a small one for Garth.\" He says the label was not pressured by retailers, who were angered that the lack of a pricing policy would result in a market free-for-all and slim profit margins. \"A MAP price felt good to our distribu- tion company [EMI Music Distribution],\" says Quigley. \"They felt they needed it, so we gave it to them.\" Wherehouse country music buyer Jeff Stoltz says the chain did not use co-op dol- lars to run the trade-in ad. As a result, Quigley says, the chain will not be penalized for advertising the title below MAP \"It's not my kind of promotion, but we really don't care,\" says Quigley. Wherehouse says it's using the promotion to remain competitive with deep discoun- ters. \"Used CDs are a core business for us, and we decided that since most of the racks and mass merchants will be pricing this at $27.88, this is a way for us to break through the clutter,\" Stoltz says. Apparently the strategy has worked; the chain expects to sell 8,000 units of the title during the first week of its availability, 3,000 more than it had originally expected to move. But Stoltz adds that he cannot yet quantify how many of the sales were part of the trade-in offer. Brooks had no comment on the Where- house promotion. One retailer isn't that concerned about the Wherehouse promotion. \"I think it's a clever idea,\" says Tower Records president Russ Solomon. \"The peo- ple who are going to sell tonnage on this title are [mass merchants], and I'd be amazed if we sell a lot\" Tower is pricing the set at $39.95. Indeed, Kmart is likely to do well with the set, since Brooks is promoting the title with an exclusive Kmart ad that features the artist stocking shelves and flicking a switch that momentarily changes the \"K\" in Kmart into a \"G\" for Garth. The ads are scheduled for a two-week flight. Kmart has the box on sale for $27.99. One Los Angeles location received only 10 copies of the box, which it sold the first day. Last fall, Brooks did a similar ad for the mass-merchant chain with \"Sevens.\" Other retailers are also selling the box at a significant discount. Borders Books & Music is pricing the set at $29.99, while Vir- gin Megastore has it at $31.99. Both chains would offer no comment on the Wherehouse promotion, but they blast- ed Capitol's marketing strategy. \"I understand Garth is concerned that his fans didn't get gouged by spending $45 for six new songs,\" says Borders VP of mer- chandising for music and video Len Cosi- mano. \"But in many cases, the retailer is making about 14 cents on this title. It's a lousy precedent that Garth and Capitol are selling something with no margin.\" The boxed set contains Brooks' first six albums, with each featuring a previ- ously unreleased bonus track. Capitol has placed all six titles on moratorium to drive sales for the set. After the boxed set sells out, which the label expects by the end of the year, each of the albums will be rereleased on its anniversary date (Billboard, April 11). Quigley defends the strategy and adds that orders were \"heavier\" from traditional retail than from mass mer- chants. Tooting His Own Horn. On April 13, President and Mrs. Clinton presented Washington, DC. eighth-grade student Gregory Thompson with the president's personal saxophone. Thomp- son, a young saxophonist who has played in the Washington, D.C., Youth Orchestra and the Duke Ellington Youth Music Festival, was selected to receive the instrument after a teacher recommended him through the VH1 Save the Music program, which is designed to restore music programs in public schools across the country.

P'Eram Joins EMI As Option For Suitors BY MARK SOLOMONS and ROBBERT TILLI LONDON— The prospect of two of the world's major music companies changing hands has emerged after Dutch electron- ics giant Philips on May 6 confirmed long- held suspicions that the group is evaluating its options for its majority stake in Polv- Gram (Billboard Bulletin, 'May 7). \"There are two girls for the dance now,\" says one New York-based analyst, referring to EMI Group's admission April 30 that it was in receipt of \"an approach\" from an un- named suitor — believed to be Universal Music parent Seagram (Billboard, May 9). Observers now consider PolyGram — with its emerging film interests — to be an even more attractive acquisition for the Canadi- an-based conglomerate, which also owns Universal Studios in Burbank, Calif. Other potential suitors for EMI are also in the frame as possible bidders for Poly- Gram, including Disney, Viacom, and DreamWorks. Competition laws are thought to rule out one of the other majors — Sony or BMG, for example — mak- ing a play for PolyGram. PolyGram's shares rose 12% in Amster- dam and New York May 6, after Philips issued a statement that it would \"embrace any strategic option to maximize [the] value to shareholders\" of its 75% stake in the major. The company's stock closed in Amsterdam that day at 98 guilders, up 10.8 guilders, with 1.8 million shares traded, nearly four times the average figure for the last three months. In New York, 105,000 shares changed hands, and the stock ended the day at 49.125, up 5.3125. The prices value PolyGram at 17.64 billion guilders ($8.56 billion). Philips' own stock rose 4.2 guilders to 193.6 guilders. EMI's stock, in contrast, closed down in London 2.7% on May 7, at 574.1 pence. Philips' statement is thought to have been prompted by recent press speculation that PolyGram might want to acquire EMI Music Publishing from EMI Group. A Philips spokesman declined further com- ment. Says one Dutch analyst, \"PolyGram is a far more interesting sale proposition than EMI Music Publishing.\" Dutch observers pointed out that the announce- ment appeared to have been carefully timed to avoid publicity, coming on the same day as a general election in the Netherlands. Analysts in both markets believe Philips is likely to buy up outstanding PolyGram shares in order to sell the entire group as a single entity, rather than sell its existing majority holding. \"They're not going to sell (Continued on page lj) BILLBOARD MAY 16, 1998 3 102 41 41 37 22 42 42 42 55 28 100 92 92 39 35 35 46 31 27 93 93 84 86 86 THIS WEEK THIS WEEK THIS WEEK Bilbaod Tpp Of Thi News 6 Clinton administration may veto copyright-extension bill If it includes exemption legislation for restaurateurs. 8 Executive Turntable: Steve Ellis is promoted at Mercury. hm & Music 1 2 Reflective new Ringo Starr album to include appearances by a number of big-name artists. 1 2 The Bant: Atlantic Records to sign Sinead O'Connor. 1 6 Boxscore: Eric Clapton grosses more than S3 million at New York's Madison Square Gar- den. 1 a ftnntliMMitnl Drift- Rrvitnn's Note Borofsky makes honest, funny folk music tor a new gener- ation.

USTR Cites Bulgaria As Worst Piracy Nation BY BILL HOLLAND WASHINGTON, D.C.— Bulgaria has been cited as the nation with the worst-offend- ing worldwide CD piracy problem now that China's enforcement efforts have improved. On May 1, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky placed Bul- garia on the office's Priority Watch List in the annual U.S. trade law's Special 301 review, which examines intellectual prop- erty protection in more than 70 countries. Without improvements in copyright enforcement, nations on the Priority Watch List could face future U.S. trade sanctions. They also endanger their sta- tus as members of the World Trade Orga- nization (WTO). The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) estimates that Bulgaria produces 15 million CDs a year — one in eight sold worldwide. In January, the USTR warned that Bul- garia would be identified as a Priority Foreign Country — the top tier for prob- lem countries — unless gains were shown. Since then, Bulgaria has announced the establishment of a CD manufacturing- plant licensing decree that seeks to close illegal CD plants and says it is committed to placing CD plants under 24-hour sur- veillance. The action follows strong lobbying by IFPI executives of Bulgarian leaders, in- cluding a meeting with Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev April 27. Bulgaria's first prosecution of an alleged pirate collapsed last June, but authorities there have more than 80 cases of suspected copyright infringement. Piracy costs the international record industry an annual $2 billion worldwide; US. companies estimate $125 million in In Asia, much illegal CD manufactur- ing has shifted from China — where enforcement efforts against piracy have improved since a 1996 trade policy show- down with the U.S. — to Macao and Hong Kong. In addition, the USTR put Macao on its Priority Watch List and Hong Kong on its third-tier Watch List. Hong Kong could have received a more severe citing were it not for CD factory raids conducted April 26 and April 28 bv Hong Kong authorities in which 7 million CDs were seized. The USTR says the plants were operated by \"a minor copyright piracy syndicate.\" Barshefsky says the new actions are encouraging and calls the number of seized discs \"staggering.\" Facing international pressure, Hong Kong recently enacted new legislation, effective in August, that will require licensing of all CD production facilities. Implementation of the World Intellec- tual Property Organization treaties by member nations will result in rules requiring nations to provide tough intel- lectual property protection across the board — and across national boundaries.

The administration's input rais- es the issue of whether such a cou- pled bill, if passed by Congress, would be vetoed. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee leaders dated May 5, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley says he would recommend that President Bill Clinton veto the bill if the two elements are coupled (Billboard Bulletin, May 7). Senate Judiciary Committee action on the bill is likely this month, staffers say. The coupled legislation was passed March 25 by the House of Representatives (Billboard, April 4). Billboard has obtained a copy of a letter, dated April 24, sent by Clinton to ASCAP chairman Mar- ilyn Bergman in which he reiter- ates his administration's opposi- tion to the music licensing fee exemption bill. However, Clinton stops short of saying he would veto a copyright term extension bill coupled with a music fee exemp- tion provision. \"As you know, we opposed the Fairness in Music Licensing Act, which was attached to the Copy- right Term Extension Act in the House,\" Clinton wrote. \"We believe that it would weaken the rights of music copyright holders. It may also violate our obligations under international treaties and undermine our effort to protect U.S. intellectual property rights owners. \"My administration will contin- ue to oppose this proposal,\" the president added. The Copyright Term Extension Act, as passed by the House, extends the term of copyright from the current length of life plus 50 years to the international standard of life plus 70 years. But it also grants all but the largest restau- rants an exemption from licensing fees for background music. This is the first time the admin- istration has stepped this far into the licensing fee exemption fight, and it did so largely because of international implications. \"If the amendment were adopt- ed, we know that our trading part- ners will claim that it is an overly broad exception that violates our obligations under the Berne Con- vention and the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intel- lectual Property Rights (TRIPS),\" Daley wrote in his letter to Judi- ciary Committee leaders. The Irish Music Rights Organi- zation and others have complained that the restaurant exemption vio- lates World Trade Organization rules (Billboard, March 28).

Platinum is planning to create an Internet site from which peo- ple can purchase albums, order customized CDs, and digitally download tracks to make their own CDs. An independent, publicly owned record company, Plat- inum says it will make available 500,000 titles for sale on the Web site that it expects to debut in the third quarter (Billboard Bul- letin, April 30). Several companies are now sell- ing music online, the most recent being direct music marketer K-tel International and Internet book- seller Amazon.com. So far the leaders in the business are online retailers CDnow and Music Boule- vard. Visitors to Platinum's Web site will also be able to select tracks from Platinum's catalog of 12,000 masters, from which the company will create a cus- tomized CD and mail it to the customer. This is a relatively new business that several com- panies have entered as well, including Supersonic. Boom, Music Connection, and CDuctive (Billboard, Feb. 7). NEW YORK— In the first week of May, as K-tel International's stock continued to climb to new heights on Internet fever and the company's announcements of new alliances, the direct music marketer warned in- vestors that its online venture faced intense competition and required substantial resources. The warning came in K-tel's third- quarter report, in which it posted a loss and lower sales than a year ago. These results, however, were said to be unrelated to its music business. The latest announcement from K-tel was that it had formed an agreement with infomereial produc- er GRTV Networks to produce daily half-hour programs promoting K-tel's proprietary music, beginning in June. The infomercials would also plug the company's World Wide Web music retail site, K-tel Express. A few days earlier, K-tel had an- nounced it had made a deal with Bill- board Music Group to run the mag- azine's music charts every Friday morning on its Web site. This report apparently sent the stock soaring more than 80% in two days. The news that K-tel was going to sell music over the Web was actual- New York-based MY-CD, which is financed by Bandai Toy Co., kicked off its \"soft launch\" May 1 with plans to become increasingly aggressive in the next few months. The company has already an- nounced a partnership with broad-band service provider Soft Net, which, according to MY-CD CEO Ed Bennett, will help the company's efforts to enter the digital-download arena. The new service will allow users to down- load and burn custom albums at the site. BY CHUCK TAYLOR NEW YORK— Sony Music's sales and income soared in fiscal year 1998, bringing the entertainment conglomerate double-digit growth in both margins. Overall, Sony Music posted a 17.3% increase in sales and operat- ing revenue to $5.27 billion, while operating income increased 19.6% to $409.7 million. Figures are for the year that ended March 31. \"We're extremely pleased with this year's fiscal performance,\" Sony Music Entertainment president/ CEO Thomas Mottola tells Billboard. \"It is reflective of our ongoing com- mitment to worldwide artist devel- opment and our aggressive approach to the global marketplace. Despite continued difficult industry condi- tions, our new fiscal year has gotten off to a strong start, and we're look- ing forward to building on this year's success.\" According to the company, strong sales were anchored by a number of album titles that fostered global suc- cess. Chief among them were the ly disclosed last year (Billboard, Nov. 22. 1997), but the stock didn't start its rapid ascent until April 9, when K-tel announced it would debut its Web site on May 1 and offer 250,000 music titles for sale. The stock rose from $6,625 in early April to more than $48 two weeks later. On April 21, the compa- ny announced a 2-for-l stock split. Its daily trading volume had swollen from a paltry 300 shares to more than 14 million on one day. The stock then fell back as low as $26.75, but it picked up steam again on renewed Internet fever and went as high as $78.9375. At press time on May 6, it was trading at $66.50. K-tel executives declined com- ment on the new businesses and the movement of the stock. On May 5, the company disclosed a net loss of $952,000 on sales of $16.4 million for the three months that ended March 31, compared with a net profit of $510,000 on $18.4 mil- lion in sales in the same period last year. The company attributed the loss and the lower sales to the cur- tailment of its \"domestic third-party media-buying operations,\" which are not related to its music business. MY-CD already has licensing deals with such labels as Alligator, Bar/None, Knitting Factory, and American Gramaphone, and, accord- ing to Bennett, is on the verge of announcing a partnership with a major-label affiliate. \"Labels are definitely coming around to thinking of this as a real business that has a substantial consumer demand,\" says Bennett. Exploiting its association with Bandai, owner of the third-largest library of Japanese animation, the company also plans to make avail- (Continued on page JO) motion picture soundtrack to \"Titan- ic\" — which this issue ends a 16-week reign at No. 1 on The Billboard 200 (see Between the Bullets, page 105) and continues to top album charts in many other nations — and Celine Dion's \"Let's Talk About Love,\" whose \"Titanic\" theme \"My Heart Will Go On\" has seen similar world- wide success. Each project has sold in excess of 19 million copies inter- nationally, Sony says. Other top-performing releases included Savage Garden's self-titled debut, Mariah Carey's \"Butterfly,\" and \"Be Here Now\" from Oasis. These successes offset disappoint- ing sales for the Columbia House record club, in which Sony is a 50% partner. As well, industry slowdowns in Europe and parts of Asia brought in revenue below projections. Overall results for parent Sony Corp. were also rosy, with a 19.3% increase in sales and operating rev- enue. In addition to music, the com- pany's interests include electronics, computer games (PlayStation), and motion pictures. But K-tel president David Weiner said in a statement accompanying the results, \"Although our initial results are encouraging, the success of online marketing cannot be cur- rently determined, and to achieve further participation in this market will require substantial financial resources, development and acquisi- tion of technology, investments in marketing, and contractual relation- ships with third parties.\" He added, \"Results will also be affected by existing competition, which the company anticipates will intensify, and by additional entrants to the market wiio may already have the necessary technology and exper- tise, many of whom may have sub- stantially greater resources than the company.\" The current leaders in online music selling are CDnow, which had a 33% market share last year, according to market researcher Jupiter Communications, and N2K, which had a 12% share. Jupiter esti- mated online music sales in 1997 at $36.6 million and projected that they would rise to $179 million this year. DON JEFFREY BY CARLA HAY NEW YORK— Prominent music industry organizations, including the Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA), plan to oppose a bill in- troduced May 5 in the Michigan state legislature that would regulate con- cert attendance by children under the age of 18. The bill, SB 1000, which was intro- duced by Republican Sen. Dale Shugars, would give local govern- ments in Michigan the authority to decide whether specific concerts are harmful to minors (Billboard Bulletin, May 7). Venues that host concerts deemed harmful to minors would be required, under a 30-day advance notice, to prohibit any minor from attending those concerts unless accompanied by an adult In addition, tickets and advertising for those con- certs would be required to contain information about the restricted access to minors. Violations by venue ow-ners would result in a misde- meanor charge punishable by 90 days' imprisonment and/or a $5,000 fine. Shugars, who is serving his first term in the Michigan state senate, tells Billboard, \"This bill gives parents the right to know what kind of con- certs their children might be attend- ing. It's based on the same concept that we don't allow minors access to certain movies, unless they ha\\^ adult supervision.\" RIAA president/CEO Hilary Rosen says, \"The senator is wrong on two counts. First, the entertainment industry has restrictions for minors or warning labels that are voluntary not government-mandated. Second, concerts don't meet government def- initions of what's harmful to minors. [Concerts] fall under the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.\" Shugars says that judgment about which concerts are inappropriate for minors will be based on \"an artist's track record and past behavior.\" The RIAA says it will work closely with the North American Concert Promoters Assn. and the National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers to oppose the bill. A date has not yet been scheduled for a vote on the bill, but Shugars says his constituents have been \"very' supportive and even- tually [the bill] will be passed.\" Rosen says that she expects, how- ever, the bill will be killed before it gets to the voting stage. Still, she says, the RIAA \"will be out in force in Michigan to oppose this bill.\" Sony Music Shines In '98 Results HIM Opposes Mich.

The second edition of the Cuban record fair kicked off April 18 here. Featuring conferences, prod- uct presentations, a Cuban music awards ceremony, and nightly con- certs attracting audiences of up to 5,000, the event attested to both the current health of music on the island and its increasing strength as a leading Cuban export. \"The main goal of Cubadisco is RECORD COMPANIES.

According to Ben- emelis, 41 foreign label represen- tatives attended the event. Among them, the presence of executives from EMI and Univer- sal Music was evidence that multinationals are renewing their stakes in the musically rich region abandoned by American majors after Fidel Castro's victo- ry in 1959 and the nationalization of private companies in Cuba.

Gales will report to a board com- posed of Atlantic Group co-chair- man Val Azzoli, Warner Bros. Records Inc. president Phil Quar- tararo, and WEA Distribution chairman/CEO Dave Mount. The name of the new venture and Gales' title have yet to be determined. Information on the new company's structure and staff is expected to be announced in the next few weeks. The new company will encom- pass the current roster and catalog of the Warner Alliance label, whose future has been in question in recent months. Last year the Warner Alliance staff was slashed from 14 to seven in the wake of cor- porate restructuring.

For the quarter, which ended March 31, the entertainment and beverage company's Universal Music division posted cash flow that was 20% higher than in the same period last year, at $12 million. Revenue fell from $367 million to $334 million. For the nine months ending March 31, cash flow at Seagram's music division was $77 million, up from $62 million the year before WEAVER MATHEWS Hamilton. Mute Records U.S. in New York names Steve Brezenoff national manager of media relations and pro- motes Mattie White to director of radio promotions.

ForeFront Records in Nashville promotes Mark Adkinson to senior director of promotions, Anne Mabry to director of marketing, and David Johnson to senior manager of label Hauser, and nearly all of the re- maining staff, fueled rumors that Warner was withdrawing from the Christian market. Among those still at Warner Alliance are VP of gospel De- metrus Alexander, national pro- motion director Brenda Smith, and Eric Mullet in marketing. The current roster mainly con- sists of gospel acts Beverly Craw- ford, O'landa Draper, Carlton Pearson, Donnie McClurkin, and the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, as well as British group World Wide Message Tribe. Gales, w T ho has headed WCD since its start-up in the fall of 1995, says Warner is very much commit- ted to the Christian market. \"The reason this company is growing and moving forward is because of the vision of Dave Mount, Val Azzoli, and Phil Quartararo,\" she says. \"Make no mistake, those are the three primary forces in us going forward because of their commitment.\" Quartararo is well-known in the contemporary Christian arena for his support of the genre. He signed dc Talk and the Newsboys when he was the head of Virgin. (Billboard Bulletin, May 7). Seagram, which continues to be posited as a leading suitor for EMI or PolyGram (see story, page 3), saw its overall results diluted by its spir- its and wine group, for which third- quarter earnings slid 44% on 21% lower revenue. The lower results, which were expected, were attrib- uted by the company to the \"soft economic situation\" in Asia.

Slated for world- wide release on June 2, the project firmly casts Stewart in the almost fatherly role of quintessential rock interpreter, covering cuts such as the Oasis anthem \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\" and Primal sti Scream's \"Rocks,\" alongside more classic fare such as the Ronnie Lane/Ron Wood composi- tion \"Ooh La La.\" According to Rob Dickins, chair- man of Warner Bros. (U.K.), the plan was to draw a direct link between that early period in the singer's career and the music being made today. \"Albums like 'Every Picture Tells A Story' continue to be an immea- surable influence on young musi- cians,\" he says. \"I wanted Rod to make an album that unabashedly staked such a claim. Also, I wanted to once again pull the down-and- dirty rock'n'roller from within him and make an album that wasn't overblown in its presentation.\" The first step in that process was sell- ing the concept to Stewart \"He was a bit cautious at first,\" «r Dickins says with a laugh. \"It was like, 'Do we really want to go down that road again?'

The certification makes the title one of the three best-selling sound- tracks in the '90s, along with \"The Lion King\" (10 million) and \"The Bodyguard\" (16 million). \"Titan- ic\" is tied with \"The Lion King\" as the No. 5 best- selling sound- track of all time. The Carpen- ters' \"The Sin- madonna gles 1969-1973,\" certified at 7 million, became the highest-certified album by a duo. Five other albums by the sibling act went multi-platinum, while seven went platinum and one went gold. Madonna reached a landmark with her latest, \"Ray Of Light\" Certified double-platinum, it made her the first female vocalist to have seven multi- platinum studio albums. She is trailed by Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand, who each have five. Madonna's \"Frozen\" became her 17th gold single, placing her behind Janet Jackson — who has 18 — as the female artist with the most gold singles. \"Rumors\" by Fleetwood Mac moved into the top five of the best- selling albums of all time, with certi- fied sales of 18 million.

Handy Award winner Luther Allison got a last round of posthumous accolades from the blues community April 30, as the late singer/guitarist, who reaped a total of eight awards in 1996-97, received five Handy honors during ceremonies at the Orpheum Theatre here. Allison, who suc- cumbed to cancer last August (Bill- board, Aug. 23, 1997), was named blues entertainer of the year, male con- temporary blues artist of the year, and guitarist of the year, while Luther Allison & the James Solberg Blues Band was named blues band of the year. His 1997 Alligator album, \"Reck- less,\" was selected as contempo- rary blues album of the year. Additionally, writer Jerry Lynn Williams' song \"Living In The House Of The Blues,\" from \"Reckless,\" received the nod as blues song of the year. In remarks during the cere- mony, Blues Foundation execu- tive director Howard Sto- vall acknowl- edged the recent pass- ing of Alli- son and sev- eral other well-known allison blues figures (who were remembered in a videotaped presentation).

David Passick, Sister 7's manager, refers to a review in Rolling Stone that likened Pike to Tina Turner, Bessie Smith, Janis Joplin, and Robert Plant \"all rolled into a tiny but explosive package.\" \"They're in the great tradition of what we remember rock- 'n'roll bands to be,\" says Passick. \"They play with an urgency that makes you sweat, com- bining a unique funk groove meets rock'n'roll with the tremendous voice of Patrice, who is one of the most extraordinary front women I've seen in many a year.\" But Sister 7, which also includes guitarist Wayne Sutton and drum- mer Sean Phillips (no relation to Dar- rell), also knew how to promote itself. \"We toured for years and built up a following through word-of-mouth and updating our mailing list\" notes Dar- rell Phillips. \"We kept in touch with our fans, and they'd bring five new people to the next show — and the crowds kept getting better.\" The years of touring contributed to a strong sense of direction among the group members, who brought dif- ferent musical influences and writ- ing styles to the table when they formed Sister 7 in 1991, when they were first called Little Sister. \"They spent so much time living together on the road that they had a good understanding of what needed to be done — and their mission,\" says Danny Kortchmar, who produced \"This The Trip.\" \"They're not shy about expressing themselves to each other, and that has a lot to do with making a great band.\" Sister 78 touring schedule contin- ued nonstop after the release of \"This The Trip,\" with Arista/Austin initially targeting the existing fan base and sending the band to retail- er conventions prior to working radio. \"In the years since they formed in 1991, they had done everything that record companies try over and over to create,\" says Schnur. \"Setting up a tour base, a database, building up new pockets of support over and over again to where they had pretty good numbers in certain markets. They put 1,000 people in a club on their own in some cases, so we wanted to cater to those kids first and build from there.\" At Austin, Texas, record store Waterloo Records & Video, owner John T Kunz has been one of Sister 7's sup- porters since 1992, when its first disc, \"Freedom Child,\" came out. \"They were still Little Sister then, and they did in-stores and we championed them with our 'Hear Texas Here' program spot- lighting Texas art- ists,\" says Kunz. \"Then they did the live album 'Free Love And Nickel Beer,' and by that point they were selling a thousand pieces. So we've had a longstanding love affair with them, and now radio is jumping on and taking them from something that was a home-grown product into something that's blossoming every- where.\" Radio joined the party via \"Know What You Mean\" last month, adds Kunz, spiking sales from a steady eight to 10 pieces to \"well over a box a week\" at Waterloo currently. The sin- gle, says Kortchmar, was \"obviously a strong tune\" when he first heard a voice/guitar demo; he moved a Sutton guitar lick from the back to the front of the track and made Sean Phillips' drum part more \"loop-like\" to give the song a \"hypnotic kind of quality.\" The single was remixed by Ben Grosse and released in February. \"Initial response was fantastic, and now the band is running around the country playing in front of radio sta- tion executives, on radio stations, and at radio-sponsored shows,\" says Schnur.

It's up to them to say yes or not, but at least they accept the phone call,\" Starr says, with a laugh. Among the guests offering their resounding support on \"Vertical Man,\" coming June 16 from Mer- cury Records, are Starr's former bandmates Paul McCartney and George Harrison, as well as Brian Wilson, Scott Weiland, Ozzy Os- bourne, Joe Walsh, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, and Alanis Moris- sette. The latter two appear on a remake of \"Drift Away,\" with Tyler singing and playing drums. Although delighted at the high- profile lineup, Mercury executives downplay the guests' significance when it comes to marketing the album. \"Ringo has traditionally had guests on his album,\" says Josh Zip- man. VP of product development for Mercury Records (U.S.). \"In fact, he's the only Beatle to have all three of the other members on one of his past albums. But I think it's not so much the names as the music that matters. The fact is, a record isn't going to become a hit because of who's a guest performer on it\" Starr's first stabr album of new material since 1992's \"Time Takes Time\" on Private Music, \"Vertical Man\" straddles the line between pop and rock and is chock-full of tuneful melodies with, at times, surpris- ingly reflective lyrics. \"People forget that we're grow- ing up,\" he shrugs, regarding the lyrics. \"I don't want to admit it, but a day at a time I'm starting to say, 'Well, I think it's time to grow up now, Richie.' And I say, 'OK. I've put up the fight for so long.' These are the things that interest me now.\" Starr hooked up with the album's producer, songwriter Mark Hud- Guitarist Jimmie Vaughan Gets 'Out There' With Rootsy Epic Set BY CHRIS MORRIS LOS ANGELES — Jimmie Vaughan plumbs the gutbucket roots of his Texas guitar style anew on his sec- ond Epic solo release, \"Out There,\" in stores June 16. The Austin, Texas-based musician implies that the title of the new album is in keeping with its musical orien- tation. vaughan \"It's all the stuff that I like- it's got the real roots Texas guitar in it, which I really love, and all the songs are a little bit off,\" he says. \"You know the RCA dog, the way he's got his head tilted a little bit? That's the way I want it to be. I want it to be just a little off.\" He adds, \"This is the kind of stuff that I like, so I'm trying to do it, because I can't hear it if I don't do it Where am I goin' to hear it? If I don't do it it's not going to be there.\" \"Strange Pleasure,\" Vaughan's solo debut was released in 1994. But Vaughan says the four-year lag be- tween projects wasn't due to any loafing on his part. \"I wasn't much layin' on the couch for four years,\" he says. \"I did a lot of touring after [the last album]. It took me awhile to get some songs, and then when I went in, different things happened, things that were out of my control. A tour would come up, and we'd go in and the studio I wanted wasn't available. I'd go some- where else, and I'd get kicked out of there.

Hudson, Grakel, and fel- low songwriter/guitarist Steve Dudas gathered at Starr's house in Los Angeles and started writing songs. Several sessions later — and with breaks for vacations, tours, and other business — the foursome had written an album of material. \"This is the first time I've really been involved [in my record],\" Starr says. \"Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's (Continued on page 19) 'Last Waltz' Memories.

Atlantic Makes A Bid Far Sinead O'Connor; Tyler's Knee Injury Stalls Aerosmith Tnur TlDBITS: Look for Atlantic Records to sign Sinead O'Connor. O'Connor, who was formerly on EMI Records, had her last EP, \"Gospel Oak,\" picked up by Columbia Records following EMI's closure. However, that was a one-off deal (Billboard Bulletin, May 1). Aerosmith has postponed the remainder of its North American tour after lead singer Steven Tyler damaged his knee during a show in Anchor- age, Alaska. Tyler will have to undergo knee surgery followed by 12 weeks of rehab. The dates, which ran through June 4, are expected to be rescheduled for later this year. In other Aerosmith news, the band just cut a ballad, \"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing,\" for the \"Armageddon\" soundtrack. The movie's cast includes Tyler's daughter, Liv. This marks the first time the group has record- ed an original song for a major studio film. On June 20, HBO will air a concert featuring Billy Joel and Elton John taped earlier that evening in Vien- na. The special, produced by Picture Vision's Jon Small, will be directed by David Mallet. Nick Lowe hits the road June 9 in San Francis- co in support of his new album, \"Dig My Mood.\" Openers are Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham. RCA has restructured its publicity department. Publicity director Gina Orr has moved from the the East Coast to the West Coast, while Michael Taub, associate director of publicity, based in Los Angeles, has left the company. Voting continues through May 30 on the U.S. Post Office's new stamp series based on the '60s. Among the contenders in the arts and entertain- ment category are a Beatles stamp and one com- memorating Woodstock. C REATION'S BABY: Creation Records in the U.K. will release an EP of new Ronnie Spector recordings in the fall. The EP consists of material Spector has been working on for months, as chron- icled in this column, with producers Joey Ramone and Daniel Rey. The highlight of the set is a gor- geous version of Johnny Thunders' \"You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory.\" No U.S. release is scheduled. As far as full-length album plans, a Cre- ation spokesman says there are currently none but that \"anything is possible.\" CoMING UP: Universal Records will release a Chumbawamba album in the fall that will consist of material from its previous eight U.K. record- tU HI by Melinda Newman ings — none of which came out in the U.S. — as well as a few new tunes. The first single will be \"Top Of The World,\" which is already out in the Europe. Imperial Teen, Roddy Bottum's full-time project since the dissolution of Faith No More, has just com- pleted its follow-up to \"Seasick.\" \"What Is Not To Love\" will come out in August on Slash/London. In other Slash news, former Grant Lee Buffa- lo member Paul Kimble is working on an album with his new band, Pistol Star. Expect a late sum- mer/early fall release. Woohoo! On Sept. 1, Rhino Records will release \"Go Simpsonic With The Simp- sons,\" a follow-up to 1996's \"Songs In The Key Of Spring- field.\" Similar to its predecessor, the new disc will contain songs, underscore music, and intersti- tial dialogue from the series. A two-CD singles collection from Depeche Mode, titled \"The Singles 86-98,\" is slated for release on Oct. 13. The set will contain a new song, \"Only When I Lose Myself,\" which will be serviced to alternative radio in late August. It HAD TO HAPPEN: Just as 550 Music is releas- ing the \"Ally MeBeal\" soundtrack, Peter Pan Records is putting out two records featuring that annoying dancing baby who appears periodically to McBea). \"The Official Dancing Baby CD\" features four remixes of \"Hooked On A Feeling,\" which the danc- ing baby cavorts to on the show. The CD came out April 28 and appears on this issue's Hot 100 Bubbling Under chart. The tune is performed by the new act Baby Talk. A full-length Dancing Baby album, fea- turing 14 bubble-gum hits like \"Sugar Sugar\" and \"Dizzy,\" will be released May 26. Since, as far as we know, the Dancing Baby doesn't sing (or he'd be called the Singing Baby), what makes these Dancing Baby CDs official is that Peter Pan's parent company, PPI Entertain- ment, has the license to manufacture and dis- tribute Dancing Baby audio and video products. Therefore the cover of the releases is a 3D, ani- mated, lenticular package of the Baby dancing. Get it now, because we believe the Baby's 15 minutes of fame were over 20 minutes ago In the same vein, Jamie Records, better known for its back catalog of '50s and '60s music, has rush- released \"Goodbye Seinfeld\" by Soda & 7. The song recalls specific episodes and laments the pro- gram's end. For those people with a life who may not know, NBC is airing the last episode of \"Sein- feld\" on Thursday (14). 12 BILLBOARD MAY 16. 1998 I / r One ( I f I incredible -—— — Singer - yyornacic One Incredible Year Academy Of Country Music • Top New Female Vocalist Congratulations from Your Decca family Artists & Music STEWART REVISITS HIS ROOTS (Continued from pane 10) ing up through the ranks right new are incredible. When I heard 'Weak As I Am' by Skunk Anansie, I was dying to sing it. It felt like a natural song for me.\" With the decision to include that tune on the album — along with Superstar's sterling self-titled com- position, Ron Sexsmith's \"Secret Heart,\" and Mick Scott's \"What Do You Want Me To Do\"— the time had come to begin cutting tracks. \"Rod asked about producers,\" Dickins recalls. \"Knowing the answer, I asked him who had pro- duced those classic early records, and he said that he had. 'Then you have your producer,' I replied.\" Stewart was instantly keen on the idea. \"It was nice to eliminate the middleman for a change,\" he says, adding that he and longtime friend and keyboardist Kevin Savigar \"had a fantastic time\" digging into the task. \"By this point, the album had become a mission to me. It was a chance to prove that I wasn't an old geezer ready to pack it in.\" The end result of these sessions is an ornery, guitar-heavy set that largely re-creates the tone of a live concert. \"Rocks\" plays like the lip- smackin' sequel to Stewart's 70s-era smash \"Hot Legs,\" while \"Ooh La La,\" with its intricate mandolin lines. is the flip side of \"Maggie May.\" But how will a world that has got- ten comfortable with the softer sound of recent Rod Stewart record- ings react? \"Quite frankly, we always do well with Rod, no matter what he does,\" says Tim Devin, GM of Tower Rec- ords in New York. \"The ladies, in par- ticular, just love him. The old Faces fans that jumped off the bandwagon could wry well come back with this one, which make this one of his big- ger albums in recent times.\" Retailers in the U.K. are equally intrigued by the project. \"The fact that it has a lot of covers of popular U.K. bands makes it extra interest- ing here,\" says Ron Bouyers, buyer for Record Tower, an indie outlet in London. \"At the minimum, people will want to hear what Rod does to a song like 'Cigarettes & Alcohol.' It could do quite well, at the end of the day.\" The radio outlook for \"When We Were The New Boys\" is equally pos- itive. Although the label isn't slated to begin soliciting pop, AC, and main- stream rock airplay in the States on the first single, \"Ooh La La,\" until Tuesday (12), programmers are opti- mistic about its future with listeners. \"It has that classic 'Maggie May' sound that I think people will gravi- tate toward,\" says Blake John, assis- tant music director at KCMU Seattle. Radio promotion for \"Ooh La La\" in the U.K. and throughout much of Europe begins on Monday (11). Now that the creative part of the project is behind him, Stewart, who is managed by Arnold Stiefel and Annie Challis, is eager to get back on the road. He's scheduled to begin a world [their stake],\" comments one ana- lyst. \"It's cheaper to buy the 25% they don't own; then they can do pretty much what they want.\" A key player in a future sale of both EMI and PolyGram is likely to be London-based fund manager Mercury Asset Management, which controls just less than 10% of EMI stock and is thought to be the sin- gle largest shareholder in Poly- Gram after Philips, with nearly 3 million shares, or about 1.5% of the company. A Mercury spokesman said that the company does not dis- cuss individual stocks. Analysts have said that Philips wanted to keep PolyGram in order to have an interest in a major soft- ware company as it develops new entertainment technologies. But it tour, booked by International Creative Management, July 14 in Hartford, Conn. Much of the tour will be pro- moted by Delsener/Slater. \"I can't wait to play these songs,\" Stewart says. \"I'm not like a lot of other artists who hate to be on the road. I actually get quite jittery when I'm away from the stage for too long.\" has had a change of heart about that philosophy and is known to have been keen for some time to divest its PolyGram holding in order to focus on core businesses. \"They feel they're not getting the value out of PolyGram,\" adds the analyst. \"They just don't like hav- ing to manage the business quarter by quarter.\" PolyGram reported a net profit of 15 million guilders ($7.5 million) for the first three months of this year, compared with 122 million guilders ($59 million) in the same period in 1997.

The network began paral- lel actions in the U.K.'s High Court and in a complaint to the European Commission; the actions cited both VPL and the major labels as repre- sented by the International Federa- tion of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). On May 6, both of those actions were dropped after a settle- ment between the sides (Billboard Bullletin,May7). Had the Commission upheld MTV's complaint and ruled that VPL's collective licensing was illegal, all similar societies in all rights sec- tors in the EU would have had their legal foundations removed. The settlement of MTV's case has come out of the blue and in unusual ARISTA/AUSTIN'S SISTER 7 (Continued front jtoae 10) music director at modern AC WALC St. Louis, says about \"Know What You Mean,\" \"It's been top 10 in phones since we put it on and fits our audience perfectly.\" \"The beauty of this situation is that so many bands have a single and suddenly gain a radio and sales base, which is so fragile,\" says Schnur. \"But this isn't an overnight success story, but a band that's developed over the years in many markets. We made sure we catered the album to that fan base, with the right song or two to take it to the next step.\" The next step, Schnur notes, in- cludes a \"more adult\" image shift, as evidenced in the video for \"Know What You Mean.\" The Progressive Global Agency-booked band is plan- ning to expand its base internation- ally, having toured Germany with labelmate Abra Moore last fall and performed a residency stint in Paris. Pike, meanwhile, says she expects the band to grow artistically. \"What's attractive about Sister 7 right now is due to a mainstream single that's really a watered-down version of what the band does as a whole,\" says the vocalist, a Warner- Tamerlane writer, along with the rest of the group. \"It's the safest song on the record for radio and isn't risky at all. \"But the band's a rock band,\" Pike adds. \"Most of our stuff pushes things ahead of the curve, and we hope to put things out that are more representative of what we do.\" circumstances. Normally, such issues are resolved in the context of a court- room, with a judge announcing that the case has been settled within the framework of the legal dispute. How- ever, this settlement has been reached away from the court; the U.K. and European legal actions have ceased simply because MTV's initial complaint was withdrawn. When contacted by Billboard, each organization referred to a joint state- ment that notes that the settlement agreement \"contains a confidentiali- ty provision which precludes the par- ties from disclosing its terms.\" The dispute has gained a large number of complexities in its six-year passage through the British and European legal systems. One of those complexities is that, during the six years, four of the five majors named in the initial complaint have split from VPL in this area and done their own direct deals with MTV. Only Warner Music hasn't done so, although it has been suggested that Warner has reached a deal with the broadcaster that precipitated the set- tlement. However, it is known that Warner Music has not struck such a deal and remains in negotiation with MTV over rights and payments.

The end of the dispute removes a thorny problem for the European Commission and a profound threat to the EU's collecting societies. It's highly unusual for the Commission to consider a complaint such as MTV's for six years without being able to reach a public conclusion. Sources within Commission circles in Brussels suggest the Commission was reluctant to make a ruling that, if it had favored MTV's position, would have outlawed a continentwide working practice. Indeed, the dilemma the Commis- sion faced was evident in 1994, when the DG15 internal market depart- ment and the OG4 competition department were in open dispute about the case. DG4 executives were eager to pursue the issue and, be- cause of their predilection for free trade, appeared to be leaning toward MTV's position. In contrast, DG15— a department whose sole responsi- bility is the smooth running of the single European markets — was equal- ly keen that the status quo of collec- tive licensing not be undermined. Senior record industry figures in the U.K. believe Brussels civil ser- vants feared to act. The British High Court decided three years ago that it would not hear the dispute until a decision had been made public by the European Commission. Some procedural matters did come before the court, however. The last of these was in February, when a High Court judge ruled that MTV must disclose to its opponents sensi- tive commercial information. MTV had asked the court to let it keep the information secret. ar this t 1 bus n e s s 1 B0XSC0RE TOP 10 CONCERT GROSSES ARTIST-SI H.'C Dated) Gross Attendance EMC CLAPTON DISTANT COUSINS Madison Squirt New tot April IB 70 1J.1U.SM uvie so.no «S.342 ihrse III | .

With flamboyant front woman Jennifer Starr as its not-so-secret weapon, the act is poised for a major pop breakthrough. In mid-March, the label issued the club-focused 12-inch single \"Hands To Heaven,\" a house music anthem that has scored immediate turntable action throughout the U.S. The track is No. 15 on this issue's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. While DJs have solidly bonded with the state-of-the-street remixes by Myangos, Rhythm Masters, D.I Icey, and Pure Sugar masterminds Richard \"Humpty\" Vission and Pete Lorimer, it is Starr's vibrant, delightfully over- the-top vocal that has triggered the ^■L-JB^ loudest raves. \"It's unusual to discover a dance singer who can not only sing but also has the personali- ty to be a star,\" says Billy Rhodes, a Seattle club DJ. Marlon Creaton, manager of the independent Record Kitchen in San Francisco, echoes Rhodes' senti- STARR ment. He adds that Starr \"makes the dance genre look good, because you know she has a great future ahead.\" And the idea of dealing with an act that's capable of being more than a lim- ited turntable entity is what attracted Geffen A&R executive Craig Coburn to Pure Sugar in the first place. \"The problem that most labels have with dance music is that they basically throw it out on vinyl and maybe at some point to radio and wait for miracles,\" he says. \"Pure Sugar will be marketed as all other serious artists on the label are. Our focus will begin at the club level and then [move] to radio and television.\" (Continued on page il) MOST ONE YEAR OLDS JOST SIT THERE AND DROOL!

Perhaps because he started performing lit- erally in order to communicate, the 23-year-old's live show is where he really shines. As a teenage exchange student in Germany, Borofsky says, he made friends his age by becoming \"a kind of human jukebox, learning to play a bizarre range of stuff from Cat Stevens to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\" Now his shows at coffeehouses and bars hare audi- ences throughout New England bopping, as they were at a recent song- writers' circle at New York's Dark Star Lounge. Borofsky says watch- ing DiFranco's career develop has influenced his choices so far. Her success, he says, has shown him that he \"can do music for a living, not be filthy rich, and most importantly, not sign with a big major label.\" But with characteristic humor even about his own ethics, Borofsky evokes Vance Gilbert's words: \"This career is great — there's literally hundreds of dollars to be made every year!\" Contact Borofsky's Finoc- chio Records at (617) 625-1741 or mail@finocchio.com. Dylan sieglek ATLANTA: For three years, the Lost Continentals have been serving up an intoxicating blend of smooth swing rhythms, rockabilly riffs, and sultry, country-tinged vocals to packed clubs around the Southeast. \"We do the swing thing, but it sure doesn't sound like Vegas,\" says vocalist Amy Pike. \"It sounds like Georgia.\" From Atlanta's Cotton Club to the Centennial Park stage at the 1996 Summer Olympics, the Lost Conti- nentals' infectious sound has stirred a wide audience beyond the zoot suit-and-martini set. \"People are really ready for music they can dance to together,\" Pike explains. With a lyrical style that ranges from soft and sassy to downright bawdy, Pike puts a new spin on swing's tough-guy image. \"We get a lot of girls who tell me they identify with us,\" she says. \"I think a lot of them appre- ciate the idea that a sexy woman can be a strong woman.\" Although swing music hasn't yet earned a category at the Atlanta Local Music Awards, the band has received nods from the local industry as best rockabilly band for two consecutive years. Since Jan- uary, the band has also been getting serious attention for its debut, \"Moonshine And Martinis\" (Landslide). In its first month, the album landed near the top of the sales charts of several local independent music stores with more than 1,000 copies sold, and it entered into heavy rota- tion at Atlanta's WRAS. Recently serviced nationally, the album has already sold more than 3,000 units and has garnered airplay on nearly 100 college and roots-music stations in 33 states. Contact Pike at 404- 524-8907. BRUCE BUCKLEY NASHVILLE: Hard-rapping rock music in this town won't be booked on the Grand Ole Opry any time soon, but the members of Stone Deep have their sights set on bigger stages. After winning a National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences unsigned-band competition in 1996 — beat- ing out 2,500 other groups — the band showcased in New York and Los Angeles. That same year, the band's hometown named Stone Deep the outstanding unsigned artist of 1996. Pulling together a group that fuses intelligent rapping with electric guitar and throbbing bass took musi- cians from both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. Hailing from New York's Long Island, guitarist Glen Cummings migrat- ed to Music City on a hunch that he could hook up with like-minded musicians. Enter Nashville native Ronzo \"Beast\" Cartwright. The two hit it off, writing music that combines rap and blues-based alternative music. Bassist Tim Brooks and drummer David DePrieste completed the lineup. \"Music is wher- ever you are,\" says Cartwright. \"Place doesn't matter so much. But for us, this is a good place to lire. It's just about keeping it real.\" Stone Deep has received airplay on WKDF Nashville and college station WRVU. Contact John Conlon at 617-777-7425.

More specifically, Mercury is working with the organizers of Beat- lefest to coordinate a mailing to recent convention attendees. The postcard mailing will offer a deal whereby fans who preorder the album will receive a 7-inch single of \"La De Da\" backed with a non- album track. Additionally, Mercury is tying in with the British Rock Symphony tour, a summer outing that will fea- ture an orchestra and rock band doing Beatles, Who, and other Brit- rock material. \"We'll have displays for Ringo's album on site because they're doing Beatles music and because Ringo's son [Zak StarkeyJ is in the band,\" says Zieman. \"Many of the people interested in Ringo will go to that tour.\" Mercury is also offering a special deal through Best Buy. Customers who preorder \"Vertical Man\" from the consumer electronics chain will get a three-song CD with tracks not on the album. A limited-edition Digipak, with a run of at least 100,000 units, will be available to all retailers, along with the jewel-box release. \"Ringo had a lot of input in the Digipak,\" says Zie- man. \"It has some additional artwork and a die-cut design.\" The limited edition will be the same price as the regular CD. Starr's sheer affability can also help entice music consumers, says John Artale, buyer for Carnegie, Pa.-based National Record Mart. \"He always was the Sonny Bono of the Beatles; everybody likes him,\" says Artale. \"It sounds like some- thing that should be pretty easy to market, and people are very aware of him because he's been doing the shed tours (with the All-Starrs]. I think people that like music like him.\" Indeed, Ringo's All-Starrs (with Jack Bruce, Peter Frampton, Procol Harem's Gary Brooker, Bad Compa- ny's Simon Kirke, and Mark Rivera, saxophonist for Billy Joel) will be touring Europe and Russia this sum- mer. As with All-Starrs lineups in the past, each artist, backed by the others, takes turns as the front man, performing his or his group's great- est hits. However, other than a few select- ed appearances, including Tuesday (12) at New York's Bottom Line and a Wednesday (13) taping for VHl's \"Storytellers,\" Starr will not be touring solely to promote \"Vertical Man.\" \"I don't really ever want to do the two hours where it's just me,\" says Starr. \"I like the mixture of the All- Starrs because it's so much fun. I get down in front and do the entertain- ing thing, and then I'm back behind the drums, and it can't be bad back- ing Jack Bruce and Peter Frampton and having all the fun while they take the weight.\" BILLBOARD MAY 16, 1998 19 Artists & Music ASCAP held a dinner at Nashville's Richland Country Club to honor its Christian music songwriters and publishers. \"Beauty For Ashes,\" written and recorded by Crystal Lewis and published by Metro One, was named song of the year.
