In accordance with the deal, Musicmaker will receive a five-year license that will enable it to offer its customers that purchase custom CDs music from EMI’s extensive catalog. The agreement marks the first time that a major record label has made its catalog available to a custom compilation organization. The deal could potentially add thousands of songs — including music on labels such as Capitol, Blue Note and Virgin Records — to Musicmaker’s catalog. It will also allows the London-based EMI Group, which saw' its overall profits fall 26% last year, to play a major role in the emerging custom CD and digital distribution market, which has been growing despite its lack of legal major label music sources. \"We’d been in discussions with all of the major record companies for (Continued on page 16) FLAMING LIPS J c LIMP BIZK11 PEPPERS LUSCIOUS JACKSON Amazon.com Offers Free Music Leading online music retailer Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) has opened a new digital download area, at which consumers may download free tracks by several popular artists.

To Unveil Latest ‘Jewel’ From Robp Hitchcock By Steve Ciabattoni Since 1976, Robyn Hitchcock has been responsible for some of the more curious, catchy and caustic songs in the world of pop music. He has issued nearly 20 studio albums, plus dozens of vinyl-only releases and outtake compilations. Hitchcock's solo albums and his group efforts leading the Soft Boys and the Egyptians achieved only modest success, but his devoted fan base and a supportive college radio industry have continued to suengthen his reputation for eccentric excellence. On July 20, Warner Bros, will release Jewels For Sophia, the Englishman’s first studio album in three vears. PROFILE “I think what a lot of fans will find surprising about this new record is the fact that it’s his first ensemble style recording in recent years,” explains Rick Gershon, Directory of Publicity for Warner Bros. “As a result, it’s a very energetic record.\" In his notes for the release, Hitchcock reveals, “I just (Continued on page 16) Sony, Digital On- Demand In Digital Distribution Agreement Sony Music Entertainment has entered into an agreement with Digital On-Demand.

CMJ music MaraTHon MUSICFeST FlLMFeST 99 Copyrighted material FLAMING LIPS The Soft Bulletin (Warner Bros.) After the release of their exhaust- ing four-CD sound experiment, 1997’s Zaireeka, the Flaming l.ips seemed to have finally gone off the deep end; the Oklahoma trio’s twisted, lysergic universe had become too frustrating and aim- less for listeners to grasp. The beautifully overstated The Soft Bul- letin , however, moves away from the unsynchronized experimenta- tion of the hand's previous efforts to offer what may be the Lips’ most challenging, yet still wonder- fully exaggerated and far-reaching, work to date. The Soft Bulletin's bril- liance stems from the fact that every element of its kaleidoscopic production seems to have a close emotional tie to its songs. The group's spaced-out moments, which came off as compelling little accidents in the past, are now more lucid, moody and colorful than ever. At the heart of every eccentric production flourish lies a rich pop hook over which vocal- ist Wayne Coyne builds his war- bled, shimmering harmonies. Tracks such as \"A Spoonf ul Weighs A Ton” and “The Spark That Bled\" are pushed to their experimental limits, while, like the rest of this genius creation, each perfectly placed note underscores the album's truly extraordinary depth. — Glen Sansone For Fans 01; Beach Boys Smile.

MUST HeaR THE ESSENTIAL RELEASES OF THE WEEK LIMP BIZKIT Significant Other (Flip-Interscope) Limp Bizkit is perched like a plump cherry atop the rap/metal sundae following the widespread success of its platinum-selling debut. Three Dollar Bill, Y'AIIS. The Florida fivesome brings back the head-cracking noise and booty- shaking beats on this outstanding follow-up, Significant Other. The product of a steady diet of Suicidal Tendencies and Run-D.M.C, the album has an intensity that never lets up, surpassing the musical scope of its predecessor with rap- core gems such as “Nookie” and the blunted hip-hop of the DJ Pre- mier-produced “N 2 Gether Now” (featuring Method Man). Razor- tongued vocalist Fred Durst raps, \"As the audience grows/ Security knows/ Stopping me now/ls seri- ous” with the conviction of a chest- beating MC. Durst still deals with life with his unsinkable attitude, never hesitating to scream “Fuck off!” to whomever he pleases, while guitarist Wes Borland wields his axe with a vengeance, pound- ing out riffs so down and low, you’ll trip over them. The unholy matrimony of metal and rap cele- brates another victory on this superb sophomore effort. So “get the fuck up” and jump around. — Amy Sciarretto For Fans 01: Korn. Kid Rock, Eminem.

RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS Californication (Warner Bros.) The Red Hot Chili Peppers’s sev- enth album, Californication , is high- lighted by the band’s reunion with guitarist John Frusciante, who played on Mother's Milk and the breakout Blood Sugar Sex Magick His return occurs at a crucial time in the Chili Pepper’s evolution, as they struggle to evolve amidst the seem- ingly constant volaulity of dieir own intra-band chemistry. The album combines the best elements of the Peppers’ ever-broadening sound, from healthy doses of power-funk on “Around The World” and the dirty “Get On Top,” to more straigh- forward rock (the first single “Scar Tissue\"), revealing the band's increased strength as songwriters. Frontman Anthony Kiedis’s voice sounds much more confident and melodic — his poetic crooning on “Otherside\" and the dreamy acoustic “Road Trippin’” are stylish- ly addictive. Having matured far beyond their drug-soaked sock-on- cock days, the band’s surreal, dream-like verses on the tide track and the irresistible “Easily” reveal how peculiar and completely origi- nal die band’s songwriting style has become. Californication doesn’t nec- essarily mark a redefinition of the band's sound, but it masterfully highlights how broad it has grown. — Amy Sciarretto For Fans Of: Fishbone, Faith No More, George Clinton Recommended Tracks: \"Around The World,” “Scar Tissue,\" “Get On Top,\" “Emit Remmus\" Contact: Jenifer Polenzani; Rachel Howard Phone: 818.953.3395 Email: jenifer.polenzani@wbr.com; rachel.howard@wbr.com Fax: 818.840.2350 Release Date: June 8: at radio now Marketing Data: Playing the Woodstock festival on July 25 in Rome. New York. Thi s One PFH5-ASE-J8SH LUSCIOUS JACKSON Electric Honey (Grand Royal-Capitol) Luscious Jackson’s 1992 debut EP In Search Of Manny was a refresh- ingly feminine take on the mascu- line urban music that was part of the band’s New York City sur- roundings. The group’s third album, Electric Honey, features a more eclectic mix of hip-hop, pop and rock sounds wrapped around sensual vocals, yet Jill Cunniff, Gabby Glaser and Kate Schellen- bach continue to make music that evokes the metropolitan cool of their home turf. Electric Honey shows a consistency of sound and song that is next logical step for- ward from 1996’s Fever In Fever Out. From the soulful dance rhythms of “Nervous Breakthrough” and the unbridled pop of “LadyTmgers,” to the new wave of “Devotion\" and the moody panorama of “Space Diva,\" Electric Honey maintains an organic groove and style that lures listeners into the band’s ever- changing musical moods. The Lus- cious ladies have always been able to write solid songs with catchy hooks, and it's this strength of musical character that has guided them to the high mark that is Elec- tric Honey. Indeed, even as Lus- cious Jackson's reach continues to broaden, their musical grasp gets stronger as well. — Tail Hendrickson For Fans 01: Cibo Matto.

JUNE 28, 1999 | CMJ 5 4 3 « jf Jt li £ ft CMJNew Music Report TOPSTORieS Edited by Glen Sansone Koch International LP Acquires Velvel Koch Entertainment, a subsidiary of Koch Interntional LP, has acquired Velvel Records, the label launched by former record executive Walter Yetnikoff. As part of the purchase, the Port Washington, New York-based Koch Entertainment will receive a 51% stake in the Velvel-owned Bottom Line Records, as well as a 50% stake in Razor & Tie Records. In addition, Koch has acquired a worldwide exclusive license for the Kinks catalog. “We’re thrilled to be acquiring the talented staff and recordings associated with Velvel Records,” said Michael Koch, Chairman/CEO of Koch Entertainment. ‘This acquisition signals an exciting new direction for our company, one that recognizes the value of separating labels from the distribution operation,” he added. Koch, which is one of the three largest independent music companies, will move its operations to the Velvel offices located in New York City; however, its distribution operations will remain in Port Washington. Artists signed to Velvel include power-pop band the Smithereens, Mephiskapheles and Ian Moore. Velvel’s catalog also includes titles by the Amazing Crowns, Bad Com- pany lead singer Paul Rogers, and former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman. Koppelmaim’s Company Takes Stake in King Biscuit One week after King Biscuit entered into an agreement with Emusic (www.emu- sic.com) to make its live recordings from the syndicated King Biscuit Flower Hour radio program available to consumers online, Charles Koppelmann’s CAK Entertainment has taken an unspecified equity stake in King Biscuit Entertainment Group. As a result of the deal, CAK, the investment and financial consulting firm that arranged the licens- ing agreement between Emusic and King Biscuit, will be given two seals on the King Biscuit Board Of Directors. King Biscuit will make certain future album titles and a por- tion of its Flower Hour catalog available for sale over the Internet. King Biscuit’s catalog contains more than 21,000 recordings by artists such as Bruce Springsteen, the Beach Boys, Eric Clapton and The Who. “This arrangement is just one example of the potential opportunities for the usage and development of the King Biscuit repertoire with respect to the Internet and e-com- merce,” said Kevin Cain, Managing Director of King Biscuit. “While they strong- ly deny any criminal wrongdoing, they have retained local counsel and intend to represent the law of the city in question by seeing this matter through to its logical conclusion,” said the band’s publicist in a press statement. A court date is currently being scheduled. G.I. JOAN: Step lively, soldier! Here’s a photo of camouflaged rocker Joan Jett when she performed last month for troops of Operation Allied Forces sta- tioned in the Balkans. Jett performed, signed auto- graphs and greeted troops. Following one perfor- mance, Jett outfitted a young Private in bondage gear and smacked him with a leather whip while shouting, “Forget NATO, you will answer to Mis- tress Joan!” Bush Ends Lawsuit, Re-Signs With Trauma British alterna-pop band Bush has signed a long- term contract with Trauma Records. As a result, the label dismissed the $40 million lawsuit it filed against the band in March for breach of contract, according to Billboard. The original suit filed by Trauma claimed that Bush did not honor the 1996 contract it signed with the label because the band failed to deliver the album, The Science OJ Things on time. Trauma’s suit also claimed that Bush was shopping the album to other record labels, even alleging that the band had received advance payments. Trauma will release The Science Of Things in the fall. In the meantime, Bush will perform at the Woodstock ’99 festival in July, where they will debut selections from its upcoming album. The band’s last studio release was 1996’s Razorblade Suitcase. Rammstein Arrested For Lewd Behavior Rammstein vocalist Flake Lorenz and keyboardist Till Lindemann were arrested for lewd and lacvisious behavior on June 5, for simulating anal sex during a show in Worcester, Massachusetts. They were released on June 6 after posting bail, and per- formed in Toronto on June 7 as planned. Although the band has caught heat from var- ious fire marshals for its liberal use of pyrotechnics, Rammstein has been performing this bit — which involves the two simulating sodomy with a giant phallus while clothed — since last fall’s Family Values tour.

The band members — D.II. Peligro, East Bay Ray and Klaus Flouride — and Decay Music were awarded $12,160 in legal fees. The Dead Kennedys filed suit against Biafra in Octo- ber 1998 for failure to pay back royalities and for mismanagement of the band's cata- log of music. In March, the San Francisco Superior Court set a trial date of September 27, 1999. The Dead Kennedys recorded between 1978 and 1986, and are best known for the punk rock classics \"Holiday In Cambodia,” “MTV Get Off The Air” and “Nazi Punks F*** Off.” wW/e/'&O/'O //( 7 Just back from their European tour with The Roots.

Inc : i an i c i JOAN OF ARC Interview by Kelso Jacks Chuck D. To Debut Rock Baud Public Enemy mouthpiece Chuck D. will debut his new' rock band. Con- frontation Camp, on July 22 in New' York City. The band, which also features PF member Profes- sor Griff, is planning to issue a release on Chuck D.’s own Slam Jam/, imprint later this year. “Me and Griff like to work together a lot,” Chuck told SonicNet. “We bring three attacking vocals: singing vocals, rap and poetry. We would like to think there’s noth- ing out there that can compete with this vocal application over driving tracks.” Public Enemy recently made headlines when it released its latest album, There's A Poison Coin On, over the Internet through Atomic Pop Records. Two of Joan of Arc’s defining qualities: it has a warped sense of humor and is unafraid of confounding the listener. Its recendy released record. Live In Chicago, 1999 (Jade Tree), carries evidence of both. Live is the band’s third studio album, and it is in no way, shape or form a live performance recording. It also sees the band, which was born in the emocore world, complete its metamorphosis into a full-fledged experimental art-rock outfit. We contacted frontman Tim KinseUa to learn what makes Joan Of Arc do things the way it does. How exactly are we supposed to take the title of the new album? If you are a fan of all the emocore that’s all the rage these days, take the title sincerely and with conviction. If you prefer indie rock or, say, you work at a record store, you will appreciate the irony and jaded edge to the title. What about the artwork? It seems pretty conceptual and extremely bloody. All the photographs are stills from the 1967 Godard film Weekend, recreated by us and our friends as the stars. We built all the high- school-play-style sets ourselves, Andy Mueller from Ohiogirl took the photographs and Jason Gneivokow did the layout. All this because I don't know anything funnier or more perfecdy representative of Joan Of Arc dian abstract socialist manifestos loaded with hot sex and blood. When you come up with extremely long song titles, are you being cheeky or are you not thinking about it? My problem is not thinking about things when I’m being cheeky. You’re leaving to tour soon. What should audiences expect? We are a five-piece band for the summer tour. We’ll play mostly new songs and a few older songs each night. Most the songs will have different arrangements than on the recordings, but they’ll all be recognizable if you know them. If you enjoy lots of people crowded into small places, all drinking and talking louder than the band that is playing, it should be your dream show.

The Eng- lish duo of singer Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt have recorded 10 songs in their London studio, one of which will feature J Magik of Metalheadz. The duo, which formed in 1982, is best known for the soulful and often-remixed hit single “Missing” from 1994’s Amplified Heart. McGowan Cancels U.S. Tour Dates Shane McGowan, the former frontman of Irish rock band the Pogues, was forced to cancel a number of U.S. tour dates sched- uled in early June, which included tour stops on the Guinness Fleadh, as reported by Launch. McGowan had difficulty obtain- ing a U.S. visa apparently stemming from the death of Robbie O’Neill, the son of rock photographer Terry O’Neill, who died from a drug overdose in McGowan’s home last month. Following the death, British press reported that there were no suspi- cious circumstances surrounding the inci- dent.

(See page 4). Steinman Backs Off The Beta Band Last month, songwriter Jim Steinman took issue with some lyrics from the Beta Band song ‘The 1 lard One,\" which is found on the group's recent eponymous album. The words, “One upon a time I was falling in love/But now I’m only falling apart” were originally written for the song Total Eclipse Of The Heart,” penned by Steinman and made famous in 1983 by gravelly voiced Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler. According to NME , Steinman threatened to make the band change the lyrics, but after hearing the Beta Band song, Steinman changed his mind and decided not to pursue legal action. Steinman is best known for writing the songs on Meat Loafs Bat Out Of Hell. New Beatles Single Actually Studio Session Footage We reported in issue #620 that Beat- les fans could expect a previously unre- leasecl single — “I lev Bulldog,” which is found on the 1968 lilm Yellow Submarine soundtrack. But Fab Four spokesperson Geoff Baker, who last month announced this discovery, now says that he had been misin- formed. The actual “lost\" item was only video footage of the Beatles recording “Hey Bulldog.” Baker would not comment on his statements, only to say that journalists mis- construed them. The footage will be revealed in conjunc- tion with the video re-release of the refur- bished cartoon feature film. A remastered soundtrack will also be available this Sep- tember.

Following the summer tour, the band is expected to begin work on a new record. L.A. Punk Rock Awards Debuts Many important punk bands turned up June 5 for the first-ever Los Angeles Punk Rock Hall Of Fame Awards.

A lifetime achievement award was given to KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer. DREAM ON, WHITEY: Ever since he was just a young point guard. Dust Brother Mike Simpson had his own hoop dreams. Inspired by Masta P’s recent tryout with the NBA '.v Charlotte Hornets, Simpson decided that now was the best time to take his non-existent low-post game to the Los Angeles Lakers. Here we see Simpson just before Shaquille O’Neal went through him the way a 7- foot, 300-pound center would go through a short, scrawny music producer.

Maybe they’re drawn to the greaser style associated with it or the simple structure and wild energy of the sound. Whatever the attraction is, Beloved Records is ready to prove that all those Brian Setzer fans can’t be wrong. The label showcases the many talented bands currently working within the genre on The Return Of Rockabilly, a 14-track album that features the crazy sounds of the Amazing Crowns, Belmont Playboys, the Big Six, the Polecats and several others. Leeds, England’s Hood, whose combination of pop and collage techniques made the band one of the pioneers of the post-rock sound, has been treated to a CD reissue of its 1994 vinyl- only album Cabled Linear Traction. Fluff Records released the original version; Slumberland Records, the label which is responsible for this re-issue, re-pressed the record in 1995. Hot Shit, the Jon Cougar Concentration Camp vinyl-only 10” EP that preceded the band’s debut full-length Till Niagara Falls, has been reissued by BYO Records. Originally released in 1997, it is now available on CD and contains three previously unreleased tracks. Alternative Tentacles has joined forces with fellow San Francisco-based label. Sonic Reducer Records, to provide punks everywhere with a CD reissue of the legendary Not So Quiet On The Western Front compilation. Originally released in 1982, this collection provides 80 minutes of music from seminal West Coast hardcore bands such as Dead Kennedys, Flipper, 7 Seconds, Capitol Punishment, Social Unrest and many others. The original vinyl package also included the very first issue of the now quintessential punk ’zine Maximum Rock N’ Roll, so the new CD version contains a shrunken replica of the literary artifact. The ambient sounds of today’s electronic movement functions similarly to the lounge music of the ’50s and ’60s: they provide a nice, pleasant backdrop. The Electro Lounge collection, released by the Right Stuff-Capitol, connects the genres with this concept; what if today’s electronic wunderkinds interpreted the music of the lounge masters? Utah Saints, p- ziq, Q-Burns, Meat Beat Manifesto and Uberzone some of the remixers shaking and stirring chestnuts from Martin Denny and Yma Sumac. 1201 Music’s new jazz series Hip Jazz-Bop aims to introduce jazz to younger consumers. To create the nine-disc series, the label culled tracks from the Black Lion Records archives, a reserve that holds work from such luminaries as Thelonius Monk, Duke Ellington, Randy Weston, Oscar Pettiford, Dexter Gordon, Miles Davis and many other greats. Each of the discs centers (sort of) on a theme. The album This Is Your Brain, says the press kit, seeks to be \"expansive, consciousness-altering, playful... [and to] take you to a more out-of- the-ordinary dimension.” Two New Orleans indie labels have joined forces to bring the listening public N.O.-Fi, a compilation album that chronicles the current state of the Crescent City garage and surf rock scenes. The fine folks at Turducken Records and Root Beer Extract Records called on the Royal Pendletons, Famous Monsters, the Darkest Hours, the Persuaders, the Ramparts and several others to record live tracks for the collection. The album will be released during the July 4 weekend, when the label will celebrate the release with a three-day music festival at New Orleans’ Mermaid Bar (where the album was recorded). ROIR has just made the Dickies’ We Aren’t The World available on CD for the first time. The influential Los Angeles punk group put together this album for ROIR in 1985, using exclusive material from an early four-track demo, live material from a 1978 performance and some airchecks from live radio broadcasts. For this reissue, the album has been digitally remastered and redded Still Live, Even If You Don 7 Want It. Best known for the party hit “Celebration,” Kool & The Gang is regarded as an influential ’70s funk band. For a blast of the band’s live fury, check out the Mercury CD reissue — with original liner notes — of Kool & The Gang Live At P.J. ’s. Originally released in 1971, it was the band’s third record, but its second concert documentary, having released a live album as its sophomore effort. Arista Records has collected songs from 17 of this century’s most respected female vocalists on Ultimate Divas: The Greatest Female Vocalists Of Our Time. The album includes jazz and pop vocalists, but R&B singers make up the bulk of the list. Among the ladies deemed worthy of being included are Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Annie Lennox, Tina Turner, Gladys Knight and Patti Labe lie. / tLtiTJW \\ f •% * y nenul*«f M ReCORDBRieFS The Hope Blister has released Underarm, a collection of alternate mixes, instrumentals and outtakes recorded during the sessions that produced the project’s debut record, Smile’s O.K.

Two new tracks (one of which is a song called “Gin Soaked Boy”) will supplement previous numbers such as “Promenade” and “Fin De Siecle.”...The follow-up to Live’s Secret Samadhi will be released on October 5. Entitled The Distance To Here, the album is being produced by Jerry Harrison... The duo Death In Vegas have brought in a few big names to guest on its second album.

Abby Travis (Elastica, KMFDM) released an exclusive single available only at www.abbytravis.com in the MP3 format. Proceeds from the track “Sunday Is The Day For Love,” will benefit the Mile High United Way Healing Fund. The charity provides counseling and early childhood education to Littleton, Colorado. ..Much-maligned, oft- addicted, wife-slappin’ former Motley Crue Drummer Tommy Lee is working on a solo project called Methods Of Mayhem, and getting some grade-A help. Though currently without a label, Lee has laid down tracks that feature guests such as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Kid Rock, Fred Durst and Mixmaster Mike, according to Rolling Stone Online.

Pedersen, who managed everything at the label from personnel to A&R, says that she is proud of her ume at K. “I really liked build- ing the business that Calvin and I created,” she said. “It’s a very democratic organization.” Pedersen, 33, was 18 when she started at K as an intern. Although she doesn’t have another job lined up, she says she's looking around and is very interested in the conver- gence of music and the Internet.

EMI (continued from cover) the last couple of years,” Bob Bernardi, Chairman and Co-CEO of Musicmaker.com, told CMJ. “We’ve been trying to convince [record labels] that custom compilation downloading is a good business. We have a number of key executives [at Musicmaker] that came from the music business, so I think [it helped make the deal] happen.” However, it remains uncertain as to how- much of the EMI catalog, which includes music by the Beatles, Beastie Boys and Frank Sinatra, will be made available under the agreement. “All of the music that EMI will make available for custom compilation or downloading has to be cleared by EMI's licensing department, and we have no idea what will be cleared or what won’t be cleared,” Bernardi explained. “Some [catalog] may never be able to be cleared for anybody.” Musicmaker will begin making use of EMI’s library, in piecemeal form, by the end of June. The custom compiler expects to be utilizing a significant portion of the catalog by Christmas. The Virginia-based Musicmaker.com has also established licensing and marketing agreements with Columbia House, Platinum Entertainment, Spinner.com and Woodstock.com. Amazon.com (continued from cover) number of artists included, but it is definitely meant as a free promotional download to help sell the physical CDs,\" Greg Hart, Product Manager of Amazon. coin’s music division, told CMJ. The industry has responded loudly to the new download area. “As soon as we launched this area, not surprisingly, we had a million calls from labels of all stripes and independent artists,” Hart added. While Amazon plans to closely manage the expansion of the area, the company’s main priority is to maintain a strong customer experience. Tracks will be promoted in the space for a limited time, thus making the area a continuously changing, new-music space with an alternating selection of artists. The music industry is continuing to grapple with the notion that free music could cannibalize actual album sales. But strong sales figures have characterized the customer- driven retail response to Amazon's promotional downloads. “Sarah McLachlan has been far and away our largest pre-order seller of all time. Within a day after launching the McLachlan promotion, she shot up to number one on our site faster than any other CD has at Amazon,” Hart explained. “[Roughly one week] after launching the space, four of our top five selling CDs were from artists in this area. All of the artists in the area have seen a sales spike since we launched it.” Sony Digital (continued from cover) to traditional brick-and-mortar retail outlets. Wien a given retailer connects to the Network’s proprietary broadband pipeline, that outlet is given the ability to offer customers access to catalog that the shop would otherwise lie unable to carry in-store. Thanks to Digital Distribution Machines (DDMs), customers may browse, sample and ultimately select albums for purchase. The DDMs will be able to create the full “record” package, complete with full-color artwork and liner notes, in a variety of formats, such as CD, DVD and MiniDisc. In addition, the package is also potentially downloadable to a Secure Digital Music Initative-compatible device. “This technology aims to minimize lost sales at retail while extending the reach of our artists’ music by providing consumers with an all-access pass to the Sony Music catalogue,” said Ron Urban, Senior VP of Sony Music. In light of its agreement with Sony Music, Digital On-Demand also announced a pair of retail agreements with Virgin Entertaiment Group and Trans World Entertainment; Red Dot Network DDMs will be installed in select retail outlets across the country. “This agreement further validates that digital downloading and brick-and-mortar retailing can effectively work hand-in-hand to ultimately best serve the customer,” said Robert Higgins. Trans World Chairman and CEO. Virgin Entertainment Group owns and operates Virgin Megastores. Leading music retailer Trans World is the parent company of Camelot Music, Record Town, The Wall, Coconuts, Strawberries Music and Planet Music. .ROLODexupoaie: Zero Hour can now be found deep in the heart of Soho at the following address: 375 Broadway, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10012.

The record also debuted at #4 on the RPM chart. Perhaps a well-timed arrest at an anti- war rally — like Atari Teenage Riot’s — might get them even more airplay. JAMIROQUAI Radio 200: #39 debut Core Radio: #74 debut Internet Retail: #6 debut The British funk-soul troupe’s Synkro- niied (WORK) has an auspicious chart debut, arriving at #39 on the Radio 200 and selling briskly over the Internet. The Stevie Wonder of the 21st century is also enjoying the rotation of the first single, “Canned Heat,” on MTV.

Since its inception in February of 1998, this community of hip and progressive sites has quickly established itself as a unified estrogen empire. With some 30 sites represented, from the likes of maximag.com, a forum for issues affecting women, to disgruntledhousewife.com, a guide to modern living and relationships, there is something here for everyone. And feel free to speak your mind — ChickClick offers many opportunities for women to express themselves on every topic imaginable. Through affiliate homepages and their myriad message boards, chats and other community building areas, women are able to discuss issues such as the fear of turning 30, health concerns, feminism, and yes, sex. ChickClick has also recently teamed up with Lilith Fair, hosting Camp ChickClick, a tent at each of the 32 concert venues. As an official sponsor of the tour, ChickClick will allow concert-goers an opportunity to congregate, meet one another, and get to know the people behind the site. As the result, ongoing diary entries will appear on the site, as well as daily chats, and the opportunity to purchase tickets. And the company is looking to further improve its site, rumbling towards ecstasy. In addition to offering free home pages and email for its visitors, ChickClick will launch a number of new channels and services later this year, including SheWire, a cutting-edge news and information channel for media-sawy women. r CMJ IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE DEBUT OF MusicNet ’??

Users may also record or “rip” tracks from pre-existing CDs. Equipped with iSref otred such competing products as RealNetwork’s Realjukebox, the new MusicMatch has been optimized; it is now half the size of the origi- nal software. “We’ve had our whole team working on this for the past 12 months or so,” Dennis Mudd, CEO of MusicMatch told CMJ. The Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) is expected to propose a secure digital down- load format by the end of June. Appropriately, the developers of Jukebox 4.0 have designed the new product to easily con- form to any new SDMI standard. “We have made the decoder and encoder plugs very easy. So, if there is a new format that comes out of the SDMI — for example, an open ver- sion of AEC, which is quite possible — then we’ll jump on that and be able to add that very quickly,” Mudd adds. A free version of the software can be downloaded at www.musicmatch.com/jukebox/. CD Radio Strengthens Network Satellite radio company CD Radio (www.cdradio.com), which, in late 2000, plans to market a satellite-to-car digital radio service, has inked an exclusive agreement with National Public Radio (NPR). NPR will provide programming for two of CD Radio’s planned 100 channels of subscription-based programming. Both channels will feature new programs designed specifically for CD Radio. One channel will concentrate on news, talk and information. The second channel will focus on entertainment and cultural features. Industry estimates state that, within five years, CD Radio’s audience will grow to 20 million. “The agreement puts NPR and its member stations at the forefront of the radio indus- try’s emerging satellite broadcast capability, and helps to ensure the future of public radio’s service to the American public in an increasingly digital world,” said NPR President and CEO Kevin Klose. CD Radio has also made an agreement with Public Radio International (PRI). CD Radio will create a 24-hour news, information and entertainment channel, in cooperation with public radio stations around the country. “By taking a role in satellite radio, public radio can reach audiences not served via our current broadcast services and enable stations and producers to broaden their reach and impact,” said PRI President and CEO Stephen Salyer. Music Site Riffage.com Launches Modeled after the popu- lar MP3.com site, Riffage.com was launched by former Diamond Multimedia VP Ken Wirt. This competing music desti- nation site was designed to allow visitors to link to vast amounts of downloadable, pur- chasable music, CDs and merchandise. “The vision behind Riffage.com is to be the Internet destination for consumers who want access to the plethora of music that tradition- al music stores don’t usually carry. [It is also designed to] provide bands with an exciting avenue to distribute their music and build a fan base,” said Wirt. The site will also feature reviews of its for-sale music titles, as well as a rating system. Consumers are also given the option of creating their own online radio shows. Internet Radio Conference Planned For October Radio industry trade magazine Radio Ink will host a three-day symposium devoted exclusively to the burgeoning Internet Radio industry. The convention, which is limited to 607 registrants, will take place at California’s Santa Clara Convention Center, from October 12-15. Keynote speeches will be deliv- ered by Broadcast.com founder Mark Cuban, NBCi CEO Chris Kitze, WebRadio.com CEO Mark Weiss and Microsoft’s Willie Poole. For more information, visit www.radioink.com/ conference/. Germans Clamp Down On MP3 Sites During the past several months, more than 100 Web sites that offered illegal MP3 tracks were shut down by the German branch of the International Federation Of The Phonographic Industry (IFPI). With the help of IFPI members in 70 countries, the IFPI conducts regular checks of illegal sites that contain MP3 tracks.
