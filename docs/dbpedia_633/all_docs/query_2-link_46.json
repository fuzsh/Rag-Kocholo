        "text": "Shipping Costs\n\nAlways ask for pictures of all items being order if you may have any doubts. I'm not responsible for any return shipping on items at any given time. All orders are shipped through the USPS. I will ship as soon as possible. Shipping days are Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday. Shipping is subject to change for various countries because it is more. For example to ship to South America,Spain and Italy it may be $25.00 a piece because shipping to certain countries costs more. Sorry I am not the USPS. Please there are no refunds on cassettes because they sound funny when played. These are original sealed stock pieces and because of age some cassettes warp over time. This is at your own risk. Also if USPS mail loses your shipment I am no longer taking the losses for it. Especially overseas. So it is at your own risk! If you want insurance you need to request it and pay for it! Always ask for pictures of all items being order if you may have any doubts. I'm not responsible for any return shipping on items at any given time.\n\nCassette: United States- $6.00 for one. Add $1.00 extra for each additional piece.\n\nAll other countries- $18.00 for one. Add $2.00 extra for each additional piece.\n\nCompact Discs: United States- $6.00 for one.
