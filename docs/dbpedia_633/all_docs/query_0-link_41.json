        "text": "In this Spanish name, the first or paternal family name is Laboriel and the second or maternal family name is López.\n\nAbraham Laboriel López (born July 17, 1947) is a Mexican-American bassist who has played on over 4,000 recordings and soundtracks. Guitar Player magazine called him \"the most widely used session bassist of our time\". Laboriel is the father of drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. and of producer, songwriter, and film composer Mateo Laboriel.\n\nEarly life, family and education\n\nLaboriel was born in Mexico City. His brother was Mexican rock singer Johnny Laboriel, and his sister is Mexican singer, film and television actress Ella Laboriel. Their parents were Garifuna immigrants from Honduras. The family was devoutly Catholic. His father Juan José Laboriel started as a cab driver but in the 1920s became an integral part of the entertainment business in Mexico as a founding member of the actors', musicians', composers' and film workers' associations, eventually becoming involved in over 200 films in various capacities.\n\nAbraham received classical training as a guitarist, but he switched to bass guitar while studying at the Berklee College of Music, graduating in 1972. During this time, he learned the importance of versatility as a musician.\n\nCareer\n\nHenry Mancini encouraged Laboriel to move to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a recording career, which he did in 1976. He struggled to find work for two years, before finding his first gig on a road tour with Olivia Newton-John. After a consequent European tour with Al Jarreau, Laboriel settled into a full-time studio career in Los Angeles.\n\nLaboriel has also worked with Alan Silvestri, Alvaro Lopez and Res-Q Band, Alvin Slaughter, Andraé Crouch, Andy Pratt, Andy Summers, Barbra Streisand, Billy Cobham, Chris Isaak, Christopher Cross, Crystal Lewis, Dave Grusin, DeBarge, Djavan, Dolly Parton, Don Felder, Don Moen, Donald Fagen, Dori Caymmi, Elton John, Engelbert Humperdinck, Freddie Hubbard, George Benson, Hanson, Herb Alpert, Herbie Hancock, Johnny Hallyday, Keith Green, Kelly Willard, Lalo Schifrin, Larry Carlton, Lee Ritenour, Leo Sayer, Lisa Loeb, Luis Miguel, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Nathan Davis, Paul Jackson Jr., Paul Simon, Phil Driscoll, Quincy Jones, Randy Crawford, Ray Charles, Ron Kenoly, Russ Taff, Stevie Wonder, Jimmy Smith and Umberto Tozzi.\n\nLaboriel was a founding member of the bands Friendship and Koinonia. With the latter, he recorded four albums.\n\nIn addition, he has recorded several solo albums on which he recruited a cast of musicians that included Alex Acuña, Al Jarreau, Jim Keltner, Phillip Bailey, Ron Kenoly, and others. His son Abe Laboriel Jr., a professional drummer, has played on some of the recordings.\n\nLaboriel is member of the band Open Hands with Justo Almario, Greg Mathieson, and Bill Maxwell.\n\nHonors and awards\n\nIn 2005, Abraham was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the Berklee College of Music, his alma mater.\n\nHe is ranked No. 42 on Bass Player magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time\".\n\nDiscography (partial)\n\n1993 Dear Friends\n\n1994 Guidum\n\n1995 Justo Almario & Abraham Laboriel\n\n2001 Laboriel Mathieson\n\n2005 Live in Switzerland\n\nwith Koinonia (band)\n\n1983 More Than a Feelin'\n\n1984 Celebration\n\n1986 Frontline\n\n1989 Koinonia\n\nAs sideman\n\nwith Justo Almario\n\n1987 Plumbline (Meadowlark/Sparrow)\n\n1995 Count Me In\n\nwith George Benson\n\n1980 Give Me the Night (Warner Bros.)\n\n1988 Twice the Love (Warner Bros.)\n\n1993 Love Remembers (Warner Bros.)\n\nwith George Cables\n\nShared Secrets (MuseFX, 2001)\n\nwith Larry Carlton\n\n1986 Alone / But Never Alone (MCA)\n\nwith Andraé Crouch\n\n1979 I'll Be Thinking Of You (Light Records)\n\n1981 Don't Give Up (Warner Bros.)\n\n1994 Mercy (Qwest)\n\n2006 Mighty Wind\n\nwith Phil Driscoll\n\n1987 Make Us One (Compose)\n\n1992 The Picture Changes (Mighty Horn)\n\n1994 Selah I\n\n1996 Selah II\n\n1997 Live with Friends\n\n1997 Live Praise and Worship\n\n1999 The Quiet (Mighty Horn)\n\n2000 Plugged In (Mighty Horn)\n\nwith Michael Giacchino\n\n2004 The Incredibles (Walt Disney)\n\n2007 Ratatouille (Walt Disney)\n\n2015 Inside Out (Walt Disney)\n\n2016 Zootopia (Walt Disney)\n\n2018 Incredibles 2 (Walt Disney)\n\nwith Dave Grusin\n\n1982 Tootsie (Warner Bros.)\n\n1985 Harlequin (GRP)\n\n1985 GRP Live in Session (GRP)\n\n1987 Cinemagic (GRP)\n\nwith Al Jarreau\n\n1977 Look to the Rainbow (Warner Bros.)\n\n1980 This Time (Warner Bros.)\n\n1981 Breakin' Away (Warner Bros.)\n\n1983 Jarreau (Warner Bros.)\n\n1988 Heart's Horizon (Reprise)\n\nwith Ron Kenoly\n\n1991 Jesus Is Alive (Integrity)\n\n1992 Lift Him Up (Integrity)\n\n1994 God Is Able (Integrity)\n\n1995 Sing Out With One Voice (Integrity)\n\n1996 Welcome Home (Integrity)\n\n1998 Majesty (Integrity)\n\n1999 We Offer Praises (Integrity)\n\nwith Henry Mancini\n\n1975 Symphonic Soul (RCA)\n\n1976 The Cop Show Themes (RCA)\n\nwith Don Moen\n\n1990 Eternal God (Integrity)\n\n1992 Worship with Don Moen (Integrity)\n\n1994 Trust in the Lord (Integrity)\n\n1995 Rivers of Joy (Integrity)\n\n1997 Let Your Glory Fall (Integrity)\n\n1998 God Is Good (Integrity)\n\n2000 The Mercy Seat (Integrity)\n\n2000 Heal Our Land (Integrity)\n\nwith Al Jarreau and George Benson\n\n2006 Givin' It Up (Concord Records)\n\nwith Lee Ritenour\n\n1978 The Captain's Journey (Elektra)\n\n1979 Feel the Night (Elektra)\n\n1981 RIT (Elektra/Asylum)\n\n1986 Earth Run (GRP Records)\n\nwith others\n\nSee also"
