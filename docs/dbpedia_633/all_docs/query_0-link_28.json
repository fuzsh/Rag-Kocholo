I was happy to find the CD as detailed in the thread I've linked to above.\n\nARARA remains a fun listen for me - and I still recall The Weather Channel using \"Toucan's Dance\" for backing music to its \"Local on the 8's\" segment.\n\nHard to believe this one is 30 years old now. Qobuz does have it for streaming and most likely available for purchase as a lossless download as well.\n\nI don't recall ever warming to it--I think the synthesizer overkill turned me off after a few listens. It is very much a product of the late 80s. I feel the same way about Brasil '86 now as a matter of fact--it's not a bad album but as much as I liked it back then, in recent years I can't get through a few tracks before I'm tuning it out.\n\nSergio was really \"all over the map\" when this one came out... he'd gone completely away from the \"band\" concept, among other large changes. That said, this album came off as less disjointed than some of the ones surrounding it for me. THAT said, it's a seriously dated album due to some of the instrumentation and production choices, as are most of his '80s efforts. When I first heard this one, I thought \"Wow, this new 'Mas Que Nada' is my new favorite.\" But it wasn't long before I reverted to thinking the original was the best. After all this time, I have to say my favorite song on it is \"Cravo E Canela,\" with the tasty Gracinha vocals. The opening \"Sarara\" is a nice song too but it doesn't sound much like a Sergio Mendes tune.\n\nWhen I first heard this one, I thought \"Wow, this new 'Mas Que Nada' is my new favorite.\" But it wasn't long before I reverted to thinking the original was the best.\n\nYeah, I found that the \"new car smell\" on that one faded away rather quickly.\n\nFor newer versions, the one from the Rio movie soundtrack is pretty good. It has a nice smooth arrangement to it.\n\nI see it's Availible for download on Amazon for $6 great price and I plan to purchase it come payday later in the week this is one that I didn't know existed until a couple years later and was out of print and it was his Last A&M album of his second tenure there which was significant in my opinion from there he went back to Elektra for Brasiliero"
