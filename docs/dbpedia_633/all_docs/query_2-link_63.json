General Shipping Terms Returns About Us FREE SHIPPING PLUS FREE RETURNS* Ships in 1-2 Business Days We care as much about your item as you do which is why each item is carefully packaged to ensure a safe delivery. We typically ship within 1-2 business days (excluding weekends & holidays) from when your payment clears then expect your order to arrive in 2-14 business day. I have changed my mind and would like to cancel/make changes to my order. We believe in providing our customers with an ultra-speedy service. To ensure this is achieved, all of our systems are fully automated so orders are transferred for processing within minutes. Because of this it is vital to double check your order before it’s submitted to eBay. If you request to cancel through eBay within 30 minutes of when your order is placed, we will do our best to cancel, however, it is not guaranteed. How long should I expect customer service will take to respond to my inquires? We aim to respond to all customers within 24-48 hours (Monday – Friday) *Free Shipping and Free Returns is available within the United States only. Certain conditions for free returns do apply. Please see Returns information tab for more details. OOPS! My Address is wrong. Can I update my shipping address after I place an order? Very sorry to hear that! Unfortunately, due to PayPal’s policy, once an order is placed we must ship to that address. So please confirm you have selected the correct address before placing your order. What do I do if I haven’t received my order? Rarely, but sometimes shipments through the postal carrier can get a little delayed. Rest assured, we have you covered. Here is what to do: While we aim to deliver your order in the time frame specified, transit delays outside of our control can occur. Because of this we would ask that you allow the following amount of time before contacting us about your late order(s): At Least 18 days for Orders delivered within the US and At Least 25 days for Orders delivered outside the US. If you do not receive your order in the time frame specified here, please contact us and we will do our best to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Basically, in the event of your order being delayed or lost in the post, we will do our best to provide a suitable resolution. What type of payments do you accept? We accept payments through PayPal. We do this because PayPal offers unmatched security as well as flexible payment options for the customer. Plus for security, your credit card information is never shared with us (or any 3rd parties). Payment options such as: credit card, debit card, or transfer from your bank account. Best of all, there is no cost to the buyer to utilize PayPal. FAQ: Zuber’s Policies Are As Follows: We carefully grade our items, so you should expect to receive the item in the condition as we have stated it in our listing, please see the 'Condition' section. Please do not expect anything beyond what is stated in our listings. New Items: Guaranteed to be in new condition and in their original packaging. For CDs this generally (but not always) means they will come in their shrink-wrap/plastic. Used Items: Please see our description in each listing for details regarding particular items. Note: If you are a CD/Book collector: I would not suggest buying an item in Used-Good condition as it will by definition show signs of wear and use. Also, please keep in mind that we match items based on the UPC/ISBN and use eBay catalog photos. The item you receive may not exactly match the photo, but will contain the same content. How quickly will I receive my item: For items shipped within the continental United States, expect your item to typically arrive within 4-14 business days from when you place your order. For items shipped outside the U.S., expect your item to typically arrive within 12-25 business days. Occasionally, orders are delayed a little longer. Can you tell me more about a particular item? All of the information that we have about a particular item is listed on the eBay page. We are unable to provide any additional information or guarantee that you will receive anything in addition to what is described in our listing. Carefully reading the item’s description details should answer most questions that you may have. Will I receive the exact item pictured on eBay? The images supplied on our listings are intended as a guide only. The item pictured on eBay is often a stock/catalog photo. Meaning that we did not take the picture. With this in mind it isn’t always possible for us to guarantee that you will receive the exact cover shown. You should receive the item described in our listing, but the cover could vary. Do you charge sales tax? We currently charge sales tax for only items delivered in Nevada Will you accept lower amounts/offers for your items? No. I am sorry all of our prices are fixed. What is your returns policy? Please see the Returns information tab for additional requirements and details. Contact Us with your Feedback!
