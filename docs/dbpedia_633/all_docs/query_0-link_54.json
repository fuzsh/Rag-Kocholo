While the Zippers are heavily influenced by the hot jazz of the '20s. '30s, and '40s, the band isn't a mere revival act. The 12 songs on \"Hot,\" the band's second Mammoth album, may sound famil- iar, but they are all originals written by the band's members and pud- squirrel NUT ZIPPERS lished by their Strept Throat Music/ASCAP. In fact, the band is so full of orig- inal material that it has already recorded its third album, but its release has been put on hold while the Zippers and Mammoth bask in the glow of \"Hot.\" For the week end- ing Saturday (22), the album — released June 4, 199tt— entered The Billboard 200 at No. 190, while album track \"Hell\" has garnered airplay on such mod- ern rock j.x>werhouses as KROQ Los Angeles, WFNX Boston, XTRA (91X) San Diego, and KREV Min- neapolis.

But in the recording studio, you're trying to create something extra, a flowing landscape of visual images: comical or scary machines in the rubble of an urban environment, and similar stuff. We want to take people to a dangerous place, but we don't leave them there. We just want them to visit long enough to see that there are moments of great triumph that can be still found in the ashes — when you're open-eyed enough to witness them.\" If archaeology is the systematic recovery of past societies' remains, then the music of Skeleton Key specializes in startling smug onlookers with the antique objects it disentombs and revives, whether they be Chris Maxwell's primeval guitars, Steve Cal- hoon's sagging drum set, the tarnished junk collect- ed and clanked by occupational basher Rick Lee, or the artifactual microphones into which Sanko squawks. Amidst this spectacle, Skeleton Key seems to be saying that it's best not to underrate the base- line import of what time has scuttled, particularly when one considers that magnifying glasses origi- nated in Assyria in the ninth century B.C.; that palaces in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, circa 1 A.D. contained hydraulic doors and water-powered pipe organs; that electric batteries existed during Persia's Parthian Empire (250 B.C. -226 A.D.); and that nascent steam engines were known in ancient Egypt. Though a Skeleton Key track like \"Wide Open\" sounds as if the full limestone mass of the Sphinx w r ere being forced through a cramped 10th Avenue car wash during a mortar attack, the methodical grind and screech you hear is less accidental assonance, in lead guitarist Maxwell's words, than a \"shared metallic and crunching aesthetic that constantly evolved at the com- posing stage until everyone had invented their parts.\" \"Exactly,\" Sanko agrees. \"We have no charts written out on papyrus, and audiences can be skeptical of our reputation, thinking we're just noisemaking art fags from New York. But when they hear us actually go at it, they see we're playing tight, well-conceived songs that rock like crazy.\" \"One of the main things that makes it really unique for me,\" Maxwell adds, '*is that there is a very good sense of space in the music, with sec- tions where someone just won't play or — in Steve and Rick's cases — where they'll play parts with huge holes in them, different people car- rying the burden of the rhythm or melody.\" When this monumental, blast-and-dig method of rock excavation finds its grand design on rum compos mentis performances like \"All The Things I've Lost,\" \"Big Teeth,\" and \"The World's Most Famous Undertaker,\" fans get industrial-strength funk that oversteps its accented bounds to unearth a daffy new depth of synchrony. \"Frankly, there was not a lot of verbalization when the group was formed in February of '95,\" recalls Maxwell, a former booking agent at New York's avant-garde Knitting Factory club, who insists that even though he'd met Sanko and Calhoon a year earlier, it wasn't until Sanko invited Lee into the fold that they discovered their collective mission. \"Before that,\" Chris notes, \"Rick, who was originally a bassist, would THIS WEEK just accumulate junk of all kinds | propane tanks, stew pots, movie reels, a red wagon] at his place and just bang on it, never thinking of doing it in a hand. But we had that first rehearsal together in the winter of '95, and after we had two to three songs that sounded like what we imagined was possible, we found we could make even more of them.\" Skeleton Key's maiden release was a 7-inch single in 1995 on the Dedicated label and featured the brain-sick love cry \"In My Mind.\" Next came a personal favorite of this writer, the six-song 1996 EP on Motel that included three heart-scraping anti-ballads that some- how' eluded the new album's lineup: \"You Might Drown,\" \"Hoboerot- ica,\" and the perfectly upsetting \"The Spreading Stain,\" with its vivid opening verse: \"I lost my teeth/Now everything is hard to swal- low/It's hard to breath with lungs that second-guess/ My last good nerve/And everybody's standing on it/They're taking turns/To see how far it'll reach.\" What prompts bright young men in the music world to l>ang out such luckless complaints? \"Well, all of OUT parents are divorced,\" explains Maxwell, born Sept 28, 1964, a product of Arkansas. \"1 was 1 year old when my parents broke up, and I don't really know my dad. Rick didn't know his father, either. So we all have the classic background for being in a rock group.\" Not even a stint as a mail clerk at the Rose Law Firm, from which Hillary Rodham Clinton emerged, could deter Maxwell from his lower calling as a rock clangorist. \"It was inevitable,\" he assures. Sanko, born Sept. 27, 1963, is the Manhattan-bred son of an architect and an artist/housewife. He attend- ed Cooper Union, like his parents, but looked to the Knitting Factory for a more practical education. Sanko started out in the mid-'HOs as the teenage bassist in John Lurie's jazz ensemble the Lounge Lizards, and he and Ben Perowsky (drums) and Danny Blume (gui- tar) issued an album as the Fertile Crescent. The '92 record is still worth seeking out for the less piqued pre- Skeleton Key pleasures of such Sanko material as \"Shake The Cage,\" \"Somnambulist\" and \"High Priest Of Revenue.\" But even the sustentative Knitting Factory scene had its disenchanting side, as illustrated in the leadoff smash on \"Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon,\" \"Watch The Fat Man Swing.\" \"That song,\" Sanko reveals, \"is a lighthearted indictment of the worst tendencies of the Knitting Factory scene, where all sorts of people are allowed to get up onstage and almost literally masturbate. The lyrics are details about a fat, naked guy with an accordion that's disgorging this putrid slime — the shit covering everything. \"We also acknowledge on the album that these images can be dif- ferent aspects of any of us,\" Sanko continues. \" 'Famous Undertaker' is describing this horrifying character, a gremlin-like creep you can't get rid of — because he's basically a part or version of yourself.\" As Skeleton Key proceeds in its objectives, deconstructing a good deal of the colossal statements rock music's pharaohs have left behind, what helps maintain its energies for the task? \"It's corny to state,\" says Maxwell, \"but in a culture with no clearly defined structure and a lack of ritual or religion, there's a need for artists of all kinds. Beyond that, the question is so spiritual, it can demystify things to say more.\" \"Unlike all the other things we erect or create,\" muses Sanko, \"music is totally intangible and ephemeral. But it delights people like no other purely physical or intellectual thing does. It makes us uniquely happy, maybe because you can't tap your toe to a book.\" HOW TO PACKAGE A DVD?

Adam White Director of Strategic Devgtoprnent Ken Schlager Business Manager: Jcenen Sommer Commentary Labels Must Heed 'New World Order' Cues I BY JOSH WARNER When Santa stuffed Christmas stockings in 1996, he didn't leave as many music CDs as the industry might have liked. That makes Santa like a lot of other shoppers: He had many other things to choose from, and didn't necessarily always choose music. Was Santa a marketing blip, or is the music industry fac- ing a trying time? And if it is, what are the reasons and what can be done about it? This much we know. For 25 years and more, the just-in-time events of rock'n'roll, the advent of the audio CD, and the debut of MTV have fueled the industry. But now most con- sumers haw replaced their vinyl and cassette catalogs with CDs, and labels who put out the same amount of product find fewer places in the retail sector to put it. But there are other problems that are not as obvious. In most parts of America, the economy is strong, yet people are cutting back on their purchases anyway. They seem to be simpli- fying their lives and buying patterns. Often RETAILERS HAVE RIGHTS, TOO I read Mike Greene's Billboard Commen- tary with great interest (\"How To Keep The Sky From Falling,\" Billboard, Feb. 15). He identified with precision a great many of the key issues facing the industry, and I concur with many of the conclusions he reached. However, in his zeal to protect the freedoms of the artistic community, the NARAS presi- dent/CEO draws a few conclusions that will not be helpful in the long run to our industry. Like NARAS, the National Assn. of Record- ing Merchandisers (NARM) has been a staunch supporter of First Amendment rights for a very long time. However, we believe in protecting the First Amendment not just for musicians and songwriters, but for retailers as well. To assert that every retailer must carry every title released, regardless of con- tent or graphics, or risk being labeled a censor, is absurd. It makes about as much sense as attacking Kathleen Battle for not singing the songs of Tupac Shakur. Each artist has an identity and consumer base that are unique. Retailers strive for iden- tities that are unique as well. Some are based on selection; some on service, location, price, or lifestyle. Greene cries for freedom for the artists and then insists that we must force everyone (including the artists) onto \"the same philosophical and economical page.\" How can this possibly work without sacrific- ing the very vitality, both creative and eco- nomic, that we all desire? A cookie-cutter mentality makes no more sense for retailers than it does for artists. Sheryl Crow's choice not to change her lyrics in order to get placement at Wal-Mart was right for her, and it was proper for Greene to defend it. But in doing so, he unwit- tingly attacks every artist who has chosen to change an album cover or alter a lyric in order to gain greater market share. (And let's not naively assume that all lyrics get toned down to increase sales.) These decisions are the everyday intersection of art and commerce. Greene is right to characterize \"music busi- ness\" as an inherently schizophrenic term. In that light, is it really so shocking that Wal- Mart would make a business decision not to stock a record containing lyrics that criticize that means that the second record they might have nought on a shopping excursion in the past is now being left on the shelf. Consumers are also being more judgmental about their entertainment purchases. That's because there are so many entertainment The music industry doesn't need to make a technology product. But it can learn to use technology to sell its music products better 1 Josh Warner is a music industry and tech- nology consultant and author of \"The Enhanced CD Fact Book.\" choices to make. Nielsen Media Research recently conducted a sample of U.S. homes. The research found there were video games in 43% of homes and computers in 39% of homes. Unfortunately, while entertainment choices are widening, the time and resources LETTERS it by name? You'd be hard pressed to find neg- ative reviews showing up in ads for a record. If NARAS really is the champion of artis- tic freedom, Greene should support the right of every artist to make choices balancing the artistic voice against sales regardless of what those decisions are. To emphasize only the needs of the music diminishes industry part- nerships and inherently insults the right of the artist to haw business goals in addition to artistic ones. Lastly, Greene and I part ways regarding his outrageous comparison of the Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA) parental advisory program to the Nazis' treatment of the Jews. RIAA will undoubtedly be defend- ing this program from government interfer- ence for many years, and NARM will be steadfast in its support of RIAA. But let's not confuse true censorship by government with legitimate use by the private sector. The Motion Picture Assn. of America (MPAA) has had a movie rating system for more than 20 years, and controversial movies are still get- ting made. MPAA correctly challenges gov- ernment, not theaters, which exhibit the movies they believe appropriate to their audi- ences and communities. The music industry has enough challenges to unite behind without creating a false crisis that diverts us from the real issues at hand. Pam Horovitz President National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers Marlton, N.J. As a label executive, musician, and NARAS member, I would like to throw in my 2 cents' worth as to why record sales are in such a slump. Basically I agree with NARAS presi- dent/CEO Michael Greene's astute observa- tion that the public is tired of getting burned on albums with only one good song. I believe the main issue is quality. I recent- ly received my final Grammy Awards ballot and was shocked and appalled by the dread- fully low standards applied to the term \"best performance.\" The problem, I think, is that there are not enough people in executive posi- tions in our industry who are truly knowl- edgeable about music. Gone are the \"music of the consumer remain constant The rise in divorce rates and single-parent households also shifts responsibilities to younger mem- bers of the household. This, in turn, cuts into the time available to seek out entertainment, including music. A report from Congress' now-closed Office of Technology Assessment, \"The Technolog- ical Reshaping Of Metropolitan America,\" concludes that there is also a growing shift away from urban centers to \"edge\" cities and outlying suburban areas. The rise in telecom- muting and the explosion of the Internet is helping this trend along. So now music mar- keters have to work even harder to reach a more mobile, more widely displaced con- sumer. Andy Grove, the Intel founder, refers to these types of accumulated events as \"strategic inflection points\" — the cues to which an indus- try must respond or else become much small- er. Bill Gates' 360-degree turn of Microsoft toward the Internet is a sign of a company (Continued on imge IS) men\" of yore, the George Martins, the Ted Templemans, the A&R men who actually knew more about the mechanics of music than the musicians themselves. In my opinion, a background in music theory and recording technique should be a prerequisite to any A&R appointment. How else can a label expect the musicians to respect its decisions and advice? I know this point will not boost my popu- larity among fellow musicians, but they are not always the best judges of what will give value to their customers. I feel that we can no longer afford to leave creative control solely in the hands of the musicians. There must be some checks and balances in place. (Am I the only person on Earth who feels that \"The White Album,\" for example, could have been edited down to one really great album instead of two sporadic discs?) Give the customers more bang for their bucks; that will bring 'em around. Michael R. Fitzgerald President Rimshot Records Inc. Jacksonville Beach, Fla. MORE THOUGHTS ON TANGO-MANIA First, let me congratulate Timothy White on a beautifully written article (\"In The Realm Of 'Los Tangueros,' \" Music To My Ears, Billboard, Feb. 8) on the music of Astor Piazzolla and the new recording by Emanuel Ax and Pablo Ziegler, \"Los Tangueros.\" I thought you would find it interesting to note that my partner, Ettore Stratta, was not only the producer of this recording, but the person who conceived of this idea of the two pianos with Emanuel Ax and Pablo Ziegler, which he brought to Sony. He also encouraged the recording company to use Pablo as the arranger ... as Mr. Stratta had worked with Pablo before on his recording \"Symphonic Tango\" for Teldec . . . another wonderful tango recording. Once again, I really enjoyed your article. Pat Philips Concert Producer Stratta/Philips Productions Inc.

The beauty of that is that we were running out of opportunities to grow within the top 10 markets,\" says Ginsberg, former Evergreen chair- man/CEO. \"By having merged, we will now be able to look at a lot more meaningful properties,\" he adds. \"We will be able to take advantage of geographic diversity and regional economic ben- efits. The more diverse you are in terms of representation, the more you insulate your cash flow.\" With the alliance, announced Feb. 18, the newly named Chancellor Media Corp. becomes the second- largest radio group, with revenue of more than $700 million. It trails only Westinghouse/CBS^Infuuty, with its estimated $1 billion in revenue.

And despite the hefty gains realized in the past year, most execu- tives in this country's music industry expect another spike in 1997, albeit a smaller one than last year. According to the Brazilian trade association ABPD, Brazil's record industry last year sold 94.9 million units, worth nearly $875 million. (The numbers are wholesale figures.) The 1996 unit tally represented a 33% increase over the 1995 unit sales of 71.3 million. Similarly, the 1996 rev- enue tally was nearly 32% higher than the 1995 figure, $663.4 million. Most Brazilian executives attribute Brazil's growth to the government's anti-inflation \"Real Plan,\" enacted in 1994. That initiative, they claim, gave Brazil's massive lower economic class- es the purchasing power to acquire CD players and CDs. In addition, they say, Brazil's belated conversion from vinyl to CDs took hold and boosted album sales. \"The Brazilian market sold 76 mil- lion units in 1989, so we're only recov- ering the [type of] numbers we had back in the vinyl era,\" says Marcos Maynard, president, PolyGram Latino U.S., and regional VP, Latin, North America. Maynard was president of PolyGram Brasil until Jan. 1. PolyGram Brasil finished 1996 as the top label in revenue market share for Classical DG To Cut Staff, Production ■ BY JEFF CLARK-MEADS LONDON— Leading classical label Deutsche Grammophon (DG) is cutting back production by one-third as part of its long-anticipated restructuring. DG says it is also to shed some 22 staff posts as it comes to terms with a slowdown in the classical music market- According to a company statement issued Feb. 19, DG's head office will, contrary to earlier suggestions, remain in Hamburg, but a quarter of the 90 people employed there will lose their jobs (Billboard Bulletin, Feb. 20). The reduction in staffing levels is in line with reports that began circulating at the end of last year (Billboard, Dec. 21, 1996), although the projection then that the company's head office would be moved from Hamburg to Berlin is not part of DG president Karsten Witt's plans. In the Feb. 19 statement, Witt says that DG will move from its current base in Alte Rabenstrasse, Germany, to new premises in Hamburg early next year, and that the restructuring will be com- plete within two years. The restructuring, says the state- ment, \"will focus on a strengthening and centralization of the company's planning structures in the artistic and marketing sectors. Although a number of service functions will be outsourced, core departments will be maintained internally in all areas.\" DG's plans are within the context of parent company PolyGram's global (Continued on page HO) Billboard Changes Policies For Hot 100, R&B Singles Charts Hill's Discovery. Saxophonist Warren Hill, left, jokes with Discovery Records president/CEO Syd Birenbaum following Hill's signing to the label. His debut album on Discovery. \"Shelter.\" is due March 1 1 . Hill has released three albums on RCA Records and appeared on the \"Body Of Evidence\" and \"Reality Bites\" soundtracks. Effective with this issue, Billboard is altering two policies that affect both the Hot 100 Singles and Hot R&B Sin- gles charts. One change will mitigate the chances that street-date violations will artificially force debuts on either chart, while the other alteration deals with the treatment of double-A-sided singles. For the past five years, if street-date violations caused a single to appear on any printed Billboard chart, that title was also mandated to debut on Hot 100 Singles or Hot R&B Singles. In such cases, the single would make its first chart appearance on the strength of radio points, without the benefit of a full week of sales points. Instead, Billboard's new policy holds that a single will be held off the Hot 100 unless enough street-date violations Fox Lorber Leaves Metromedia TV, Vid Supplier Regains Distribution ■ BY SETH GOLDSTEIN NEW YORK— By selling out, Fox Lor- ber Associates has won its freedom. The New York-based television and home video supplier takes back distri- bution of its prerecorded cassette lihrary from Metromedia Entertain- ment Group, effective April 1 . Independence for any independent is always fraught with difficulties, because wholesalers and retailers pay more attention to better-known ven- dors like the Hollywood studios. But by Teddy Bears Singers Lose Royalty Suit LOS ANGELES— A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that two former members of the Teddy Bears presented insufficient evidence that they were shortchanged on royal- ties for their No. 1 1958 hit, \"To Know Him Is To Love Him.\" On Feb. 7, Judge Frances Roth- schild brought singers Carol Connors and Marshall Lieb's 1996 lawsuit to a close by entering a summary judgment in favor of the defendants — Phil Spec- tor, who produced \"To Know Him Is To Love Him\" and sang in the Teddy Bears with Connors and Lieb; K-tel Records, which owns the master of the song; Abkco Records, distributor of Specter's records and administrator of his publishing; and Rhino Records, dick dark productions, and Billboard Records (a Cleveland firm unrelated to Billboard magazine), which all issued compilations featuring the song. Connors and Lieb had claimed that they received no accounting of royal- ties due them for the song and had received no royalties since 1959 (Bill- board, April 27, 1996). However, Roth- schild ruled there was \"no triable Issue of material fact\" in the case and grant- ed the defendants' motion for a sum- mary judgment. CHRIS MORRIS the same token, label deals assigning majors distribution rights mean the independent can pay stiff fees, only to get lost on the back pages of a catalog. Fox Lorber president/CEO Richard Lorber, who sold and bought back the $12 million company before, thinks his deal with WinStar New Media finally gets it right. Last April, WinStar, which markets telephone services and owns a piece of the wire- less radio spectrum, bought an 80% interest. In return. Fox Lorber got the necessary backing to go it alone after the Metromedia agreement expired in December, as well as finan- cial support to start a label, WinStar Home Entertainment. \"The opportunities seem more attractive to us than continuing with Metromedia,\" says Lorber. Fox Lor- ber Home Video has a 300-title library, primarily foreign movies, \"and we're building,\" he adds. Guided by Orion Home Video (it changed to Metrome- dia at year's end), Fox Lorber devel- oped a strong sell-through business that has grown more than 70% in the past two years. It's still expanding. Lorber now thinks the time is right to expand into WinStar Home Enter- tainment's \"reality-based program- ming.\" The first four titles, including (Continued on page 72) occur to place that title on the Hot 100 Singles Sales list. Likewise, titles will not be obligated to debut on Hot R&B Singles unless they also appear on the component Hot R&B Singles Sales chart. Thus, it could be possible to see songs appear on Hot Rap Singles or Hot Dance Maxi-Singles Sales before they show up on the Hot 100 Singles or Hot R&B Singles charts. Similarly, there may be occasions when street- date violations obligate a song to chart early on the R&B list, before it makes its Hot 100 debut \"The onus will still be on distributors, rather than Billboard or SoundScan, to enforce street date,\" says Billboard director of charts Geoff Mayfield. \"But the new policy establishes a more rea- sonable sales threshold. \"Last week, for example, WEA man- aged to keep street-date violations on Madonna's 'Don't Cry For Me Argenti- na' to fewer than 1,000 units. But, because it sold enough in the core dance stores panel to impose a debut on the Maxi-Singles Sales chart, we were obligated to have the title make (Continued on page 77) Columbia To Roll Out Slate Of DVD Titles ■ BY EILEEN FITZPATRICK LOS ANGELES— Columbia TriStar Home Video, the second major studio fully committed to DVD, will release four titles in the new format April 29. Crosstown DVD proponent Warner Home Video has already announced a slate of 37 titles that will be available on March 24 for $24.98 each (Billboard, Feb. 8). To date, none of the other majors, including Universal Home Video, Paramount Home Video, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, and Buena Vista Home Video, plans to release DVD titles this spring.

The remainder is split among several small independent labels. In unit market share, Sony came out on top for the second straight year, with 19%. PolyGram was second with 18.4%, followed by EMI-Odeon, 15.2%; BMG, 13.7%; Warner, 13.5%; and SIGLA, 10.4%. Accounting for the bal- ance of the unit sales market share are small indies. ABPD is one of the few record trade organizations that di- vulges the market-share rankings of its member labels. ABPD president Manuel Camero notes that in spite of its impressive growth rate in the |>ast two years, the Brazilian record industry is reaching only 70% of its potential size because of a \"lack of credit-worthy, weD-post- tioned stores in the country.\" While he does not expect the annu- al growth rate of Brazil's record indus- try to keep zipping along at approxi- mately 30%, he does figure that the market will expand bv another 10%- 15% in 1997.

In fact, since being serviced to radio Feb. 4, the single has been get- ting regular spins on 82 stations, according to Broadcast Data Systems. It advances to No. 59 on the Hot R&B Airplay chart this issue. \"It's got a great mass-appeal sound,\" says Erik Bradley, music director at WBBM (B-96) Chicago. \"It's reminis- cent of past hits by Brownstone and' Groove Theory, but in a cuter and far more mainstream way. It looks like it's going to be a smash.\" Crave actually started the ball rolling late last year on \"Head Over Heels,\" which features a guest appear- ance by Columbia rapper Nas. A 12- inch test pressing of the song was released to clubs and radio mix-shows in December. \"It was a good way to get things started gradually and naturally,\" says label president Rick Bisceglia, noting that the single will be made commer- cially available on Tuesday (25). \"It also established that we were going to lead with music and not gimmicks. By the end of that month, there was a momen- tum building whereby people started asking us about the project, which is fantastic position for a label to be in with a new act\" It's also a solid way of launching a label. Following the April 22 worldwide release of Allure's eponymous album, Crave will begin grooming Off Tha Hook, a Detroit-based R&B male quar- tet, for an early summer debut. The album will be largely produced by long- time Carey collaborator Walter Afanasieff. Bisceglia says the label is also brewing several other pop/dance projects that are still to be confirmed. At least one of them will be released in late March/early April. \"Well be exploring a fairly wide vari- ety of musical sounds here,\" Bisceglia says of the label, which joins 550 Music and the Work Group as part of Sony Music Independent Labels, which is overseen by Epic Records Group chair- man (U.S.) David Glew. \"Allure is an excellent way to begin,\" Bisceglia adds. \"It allows us to tap into the amazing musical talents of both Mariah and the Trackmasters.\" In fact the Allure project is a joint venture between Crave and the Track- masters* new self-titled Sony label.

Petra has a strong track record in the Christian market It has won three Grammy Awards and nine Gospel Music Assn. Dove Awards, including the 1996 Dove for rock recorded album of the year, for \"No Doubt\" The band is best known for the hard rock sound that propelled sales of such albums as \"Beyond Belief,\" \"Wake-Up Call,\" \"On Fire!,\" and \"This Means War!\" However, in 1989, Petra recorded \"Petra Praise: The Rock Cries Out,\" a praise and worship album that has been certified gold and become one of the band's most acclaimed albums. On its new release, Petra revisits the praise and worship style of Christian music. Praise and worship songs are direct- ed toward God as a means of worship; these songs are primarily used in churches and worship services. \"It's music that allows us to be very thank- ful to our God,\" says lead vocalist John Schlitt. \"And it's not the music style, it's not the musicianship or instruments that are different it's where our values are and what's important to ua.\" The success of the band's prior praise and worship set has Word exec- utives confident of the. prospects for the new project, which was produced by John and Dino Elefante and execu- tive-produced by Petra founder Bob Hartman. \"This record couldn't come at a better time for Petra,\" says Word VP of marketing (U.S.) Elisa Elder.

Winners are voted Bad Livers Reach Out To New Fans With Sugar Hill Set BY TERRf HORAK NEW YORK— One thing audiences can expect from the Bad Livers is an unusual twist, and their latest release, \"Hogs On The Highway,\" is no excep- tion. With two albums on Touch and Go imprint Quarterstick Records, the Bad Livers have the distinction of being the only old-time-style country band to build a following exclusively on the indie-rock circuit. Now, with \"Hogs On The Highway,\" their Sugar Hill debut, released Feb. 18, both the band and label — which specializes in progressive acoustic music — have the chance to introduce each other to new audiences. Formed in 1990, the Bad Livers are singer/songwriter/multi-instrumental- ist Danny Barnes, mandolinist/guitarist Bob Grant, and bassist/tuba player Mark Rubin. Original member Ralph White III, who plays fiddle and accor- dion, appears on the album, but has left the band due to its demanding touring schedule. \"They bridge the same gap that we attempt to musically and also in terms of our goal of reaching out to a broad- er, younger audience and attracting them to some of the other things we're doing,\" says Bev Paul, Sugar Hill's director of sales and marketing. \"Sugar Hill has a real good reputa-' tion selling banjo records, and we've been friends with (founder/president J Barry Poss since our inception,\" Barnes says of the decision to go with the label, which has signed the Bad Livers to a three-album deal. While the Bad Livers have been honing their eclectic sound in the rock sphere, they fit naturally into the acoustic roots market, a population THE BAD LIVERS that has yet to be exposed to the band — and one that's much more like- ly to appreciate their skill and musical taste. \"Essentially, we're trying to meld these two different markets into one for the Bad Livers,\" Paul says, and touring will continue to play a key role in their success. \"A lot of musicians complain about touring, but man, we're into it,\" Barnes says, adding that the band has played more than 1,500 dates in the past seven years. The Bad Livers will include acoustic- oriented venues on their tour, but will continue to play rock clubs, as well. The Austin, Texas-based band will hit major markets in the East and West coasts as well as Midwest cities before breaking to work on a film score in April.

As we all witnessed last year, it's not doing so well.\" However, the band, which also in- cludes multi-instrumentalist Skerik from Critters Buggin, was formed from a desire to experiment with new sounds, rather than as a reaction to modern rock's faltering commercial clout. \"Each one of us, in each of our bands, has a reputation of doing some- thing new in rock'n'roll,\" Martin says. \"We just thought, 'Why not just try something totally different?' ■ Tuatara effectively fits that bill. \"Breaking The Ethers\" features the TUATARA band's members playing a variety of mostly acoustic, often exotic instru- ments (tablas, bullroarer, Tibetan horns, six-string bass, steel drums, etc.) and experimenting with a diverse array of sounds ranging from world music to jazz. Aside from the band's four-man core, the album also features such noted guests as Pearl Jam's Mike McCready on electric guitar, Los Lobos' Steve Berlin on bass penny whistle, and R.E.M. sideman and Young Fresh Fellows member Scott McCaughey on steel drums. \"We have that jazz bebop influence that is coming from a Miles Davis- Mingus-Coltrane-Thelonious [Monk] influence,\" Martin explains. \"The record itself is the kind of thing that you can put on and get into if you want to, or it can just be there and you can Lauper's Artistic Aspect Emphasized On Epic Set I BY LARRY FUCK NEW YORK-^As the April 1 release of \"Sisters Of Avalon\" draws near. Epic Records continues to strive to illumi- nate Cyndi Lauper as an artist of greater creative substance than the often-cartoonish figure who became a leader of the MTV generation in 1983 with the kitschy \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun.\" Produced by the singer with Jan Pulsford and Mark Saunders, the album plays to Lauper's consider- able strengths as a vocalist and her marked maturity as a songwriter, with broad stylis- tic leanings that range from tex- tured hip-hop and lauper dance to guitar- driven alterna-pop. Despite its seem- ingly disparate musical elements, \"Sis- ters Of Avalon\" is a cohesive and remarkably powerful collection that is notable for the absence of the novelty ditties that have long been associated with the singer. But is the world ready for the \"seri- ous\" Cyndi Lauper? \"There are cer- tainly some preconceived notions that we have to overcome,\" says David Massey, senior VP of Epic (U.S.). \"There have always been two sides of Cyndi. There's always been a musical- ly adventurous side, as well as the zany personality that became dominant in the '80s. We believe that with perse- verance and the right exposure, we can gradually knock down any barriers ahead.\" The key to the label's marketing plan is touring. Although details have yet to be confirmed, Lauper will spend much of the spring and summer on the road. \"In the past, her records have been built almost exclusively around MTV and radio,\" Massey says. \"Obviously, those are still vital elements of our plan. Cyndi is at her best onstage. We want to make the most of that.\" Epic will open its radio and club cam- paign for the project in early April with \"You Don't Know,\" a commercially- viable, funk-fortified pop jam that has been deftly remixed with a variety of trend-conscious dance beats by Tony Moran, Prince Quick Mix, and Junior Vasquez. Additionally, the label is press- ing a CD sampler that will feature sev- eral of the album's more cutting-edge tracks, including the jeep-fashioned \"Fall Into Your Dreams\" and the jazz- laced shuffler \"Say A Prayer.\" The sampler will be serviced in early March to radio programmers at triple-A, mod- ern rock, and crossover formats, as well as to retailers and selected press. \"The intention is to give a taste of the record to the tastemakers who will spread the word of the music's quality,\" Massey says. A number of indie retailers have already been exposed to the album via its Japanese pressing, released in November, thanks to the demand of Lauper's die-hard fans. \"She's one of those unique artists who has loyal followers that literally clamor for every bit of music or memo- rabilia they can get their hands on,\" says Marlon Creaton, manager of Record Kitchen in San Francisco. \"I agree that there are some people who (Continued on page 3b) enjoy it, but you don't have some screaming angst-ridden vocalist over- powering everything. At the same time, there isn't any one lead instru- ment, so it is not a barrage of saxo- phone-driven bebop. It's a lot of dif- ferent things.\" To break from the modern rock that Tuatara's members are known for with their other bands could be a mar- keting nightmare, but neither Martin nor Epic seem too concerned. \"We're leaving it in the hands of Epic to sort of sell this thing and to take it to the people,\" says Martin, who is also acting as the group's man- ager. \"But I do think there are a lot of people that would like the record, and there is a market for it, if you want to call it that, somewhere out there.\" Epic senior director of West Coast marketing Al Masocco says finding that market won't be as difficult as some might assume. \"When you look at the lineup, right (Continued on next page) Planet Bjork.

Elektra national sales manager Grammy Award Picks: An Annual Primer On Who's Going To Beat Whom f by Melinda Newman I HE ENVELOPE PLEASE: It's hard to believe that Grammy time is upon us once again, and that, once again, I'm making my predictions. Those Grammy voters are tricky, but here's my best guesses as to who's coming home with a little gold statue on Wednesday (26). I've stated so in categories in which my personal choice differs from whom I believe the voters have picked. • Record of the year: Given that the entire voting mem- bership can cast their ballots in this category, it's possible that they'll go for \"Because You Loved Me\" — it's got the broadest appeal of all the songs, and Celine Dion has had a fabulous year. But my hunch is that the Grammy is going to go to Eric Clapton's \"Change The World.\" • Album of the year: As hip as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) looks by putting Beck's \"Odelay\" in this cat- egory, the only way that set will win is if only critics vote. I don't listen to it much at home, but I hope that the Grammy goes to Dion for \"Falling Into You.\" She has worked extreme- ly hard this past year, and, more than a year after its release, the album is still kicking butt • Song of the year: Dion may lose in the record of the year category, but NARAS isn't going to deny fave Diane Warren a statue here. \"Because You Loved Me\" gets the Grammy. My preference is \"Change The World,\" written by Gordon Kennedy, Wayne Kirkpatrick, and Tommy Sims. • Best new artist: Record sales may be in a slump, but this year's list contains five proven winners who have breathed new life into the industry. The Grammy goes to Jewel. She's been a NARAS advocate, and people like that. My personal vote goes to the Tony Rich Project, but it would be fine with me if there were a five-way tie, because there's something in my heart that really wants LeAnn Rimes to win. In addition, I really like the Garbage and No Doubt albums. • Best pop album: Shawn Col vm and Sting, perennial Grammy pets, are both nominated here for \"A Few Small Repairs\" and \"Mercury Falling,\" respectively, neither of which has lived up to sales expectations. But Dion is going home with the award this year for \"Falling Into You,\" unless voters figure that she's going to get so many other awards that they'll throw this one to Sting. • Best rock song: I'm a little baffled by some of these nominations, but then, who isn't? I love John Hiatt. but why is his widely ignored \"Cry Love\" up against Oasis' \"Wonderwall\" here? The Grammy goes to \"Give Me One Reason\" by Tracy Chapman. My vote is for \"6th Avenue Heartache,\" written by the Wallflowers' Jakob Dylan. • Best rock album: The Grammy goes to \"Road Tested\" by Bonnie Raitt because NARAS loves her. Normally, I'm all for Raitt getting any award, but since \"Road Tested\" is a live album, I'm voting for \"Sheryl Crow\" by, duh, Sheryi Crow. It's far superior to her A&M debut and has been overlooked — until now. • Best R&B album: Curtis Mayfield could get the sen- timental vote for \"New World Order,\" ^5 1 and no one would complain about \"J £f ^ that, but, in my mind, the deserving I^V*^^ album here is \"Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite\" by Maxwell or \"Words\" by the Tony Rich Project • Best female country vocal per- formance: Generally Mary Chapin Carpenter wins any time she's nom- inated. This year, her \" Let Me Into Your Heart,\" a clever, upbeat ditty, is nominated. The Grammy goes to Carpenter. My choice is Rimes for \"Blue.\" • Best male country vocal performance: This is a weird category in that neither Junior Brown, who's nominated for \"My Wife Thinks You're Dead,\" nor Lyie Lovett, who's up for \"Private Conversation,\" gets much (read no) country airplay, but they definitely have their fans. The Grammy goes to Vince Gill for \"Worlds Apart.\" ■ Best country song*. The biggest single of the year, Brooks & Dunn's \"My Maria,\" isn't eligible since it's a cover of the B.W. Stevenson hit. The Grammy goes to \"High Lonesome Sound,\" written and performed by Gill. • Best country album: The Grammy goes to Gill's \"High Lonesome Sound,\" although Lovett's \"The Road To Ense- nada\" could be a dark-horse victor. It depends upon how many non-Nashvillians voted in this category. • Best song written specifically for a motion picture or for television: The oft-nominated Babyface will, unfortu- nately for him, cancel himself out in this category, for which he has received three of the five nominations (all for his work on \"Waiting To Exhale\"). The winner will be \"Be- cause You Loved Me,\" written by Warren and performed by Dion. • Producer of the year: Absolutely, without a doubt, this award should go to Babyface. However, David Foster is going to give him a run for his money. In a photo finish, the Grammy goes to Babyface. BILLBOARD MARCH 1. 1997 15 Artists & Music Bob Woodruff's 'Road' Leads To Imprint Nashville Artist Finds Label In Sync With His Vibe I BY JIM BESSMAN NEW YORK— Having left his first label over \"philosophical differences,\" singer/songwriter Bob Woodruff, whose 1994 debut, \"Dreams & Satur- day Nights,\" was released to great critical acclaim, made label ideology a central issue in seeking a new deal. At Imprint Records, the Nashville- based artist believes that he has found the right creative vibe, with the resulting \"Desire Road\" satisfying his artistic needs and the new Nashville label's goals. \"Bob's determined to reach people on his own terms, and we relate to that, says Imprint president Bud Schaetzle, who co-founded the com- pany with chairman/CEO Roy Wun- sch. \"He has his own classic mix of so many different things: traditional country and edgier rock-oriented stuff, and great acoustic values that live side by side with electric [songs]. But we got involved because he rep- resented the ideal artist for what this period in country music history looks like.\" As Schaetzle notes, Woodruff's \"first album didn't get a great shot and got lost in the shuffle — but I still have it in my car CD player because it's so great!\" The major difference with \"Desire Road,\" says Woodruff, is the label move from Asylum to Imprint. \"I was one of the first artists signed to Asy- lum when it opened in Nashville, and based on an artist roster including singer/songwriters like Guy Clark and Emmylou Harris, I felt like it was the perfect home for me. But toward the end of my record's promotion, I felt their philosophy changed, and after an amicable split, I and my man- ager, Jim Delia Croce, met wrth Roy and felt that he was starting up a label similar to Asylum, at the begin- ning, that would be the right place for me to make records.\" If anything, \"Desire Road\" is \"more rockin' \" than \"Dreams & Sat- urday Nights,\" Woodruff continues. Co-produced by Woodruff and Ray Kennedy, the new album brings back such sidemen as James Burton and Sam Bush from the first album, as well as others like bassist Garry Tal- lent, keyboardist Micheal Smother- man, guitarist Randy Lee, and Mav- ericks drummer Paul Deakin. Also guesting on the album are the Mav- ericks' Raul Malo, Joy Lynn White, Pig Robbins, and Harry Stinson. \"We discussed a more organic sound,\" says Woodruff, \"not 'follow- ing the map' as far as making rec- ords in Nashville ^^■■k is concerned— which neither of i us were interest- jfe^ w ed in. What's % great about Ray is, he's not into woodruff the politics of making records in Nashville, or anywhere else for that matter — trends or hit formulas. He's only interested in helping artists make the best records they can make.\" Comfortable with the \"singer/ songwriter\" tag, Woodruff notes that he wrote nine of the new album's 12 tracks. \"The label left us alone pret- ty much,\" he says, \"but we knew there was some pressure to get a song that was appropriate for country radio — which started me looking for outside material.** The leadoff track from \"Desire Road,\" a cover of John Fogerty's \"Almost Saturday Night,\" \"seems to be the no-brainer\" as a first single, says Delia Croce. Although the orig- inal wasn't a country hit, Woodruff notes that the \"good times, rodeos, and car lyrics all fit in with country radio — and it was a fun compromise with the record company in trying to get on country radio.\" The two other covers are Arthur Alexander's \"Every Day I Have To Cry Some\" and \"If It's Really Got To Be This Way.\" \"He really melds R&B with coun- try music in a way that really gets to me,\" says Woodruff of the late Alexander. Of the album as a whole, Woodruff says that he was able to \"meld my country influences and rock influences and bring in all kinds of styles — everything from Merle Haggard to the Beatles.\" For Schaetzle and Imprint, it's now a matter of \"waiting for the Nashville wheel to turn around and make room\" for an artist like Woodruff, a New Yorker who's resided in Music City for the past five years. .Imprint, though, will take a decid- edly proactive promotional stance. \"We'll get the album out to people who appreciate music on a pure level,\" says Schaetzle. \"If it gets a shot, it will work I with] anyone who likes great traditional country, and with more adventurous people who like a little energy mixed with tradi- tion. We'll beat our brains out getting him playing in front of people and getting the pitch to every format that might be interested, because he's got the potential to have a fan base of performers [like] John Prine and Lyle Lovett.\" Schaetzle concedes that he's facing an \"uphill battle\" at country radio, \"but we've delivered [material] for it, and if it gets heard, maybe he'll get a shot — but if not, it doesn't matter. We're not going to play the tradition- al game and try to sucker-punch radio or anybody into thinking that he's the next shiny, squeaky Nashville hat act. We're still kicking around which formats will get which songs, and for the time being we have decid- ed to just let people let us know what they want to play. We're not going to fool anybody into thinking he's any- thing else other than a pure music guy or turn him into something he's not, and if he winds up rock or alter- native or Americana or album rock or country, we don't care . . . because he appeals to so many kinds of tastes and is broad enough for more than just one thing.\" Imprint will also employ \"all the usual marketing tools,\" adds Schaet- zle, with tour support the most visi- ble initially. Woodruff is playing a number of industry conventions prior to setting out in mid-April on a North American tour to last through the fall. According to Delia Croce, Tal- lent, Smotherman, Deakin, Lee, and steel player Tommy Hanum will accompany Woodruff during the first leg of the tour, with Kennedy making occasional appearances as a guitarist. EPIC'S TUATARA BREAKS BOUNDARIES (Continued from preceding page) there is a slam-dunk superstar group,\" he says. \"The credibility is absolutely incredible at the college/alternative level.\" Yet the actual sound of Tuatara can reach far beyond the band members' usual radio core. Masocco says, \"It cer- tainly will have enormous impact at the alternative and college alternative level, but it certainly can fit into the NAC and triple-A formats very easily.\" Epic plans to service radio with the entire album about a week prior to street date, concentrating on those four formats as well as specialty shows. At least one modern rock jock is anx- iously awaiting the album's release. Jason Hughes, who handles overnights and hosts the local music specialty show \"The Young And The Restless\" on modern rock KNDD (The End) Seattle, caught one of the band's first performances at the Crocodile Cafe in Seattle. \"They're really great and have a very ethereal sound,\" Hughes says. He plans to play Tuatara on his show, noting that each of the players has a following. \"Skerik is huge, Peter is now a Seattle mainstay, and Barrett is pretty popular,\" he says. In an attempt to capitalize upon the names of the band's members, Epic plans to affix a sticker to the album listing the group's lineup. Tuatara is also bound to get expo- sure from a unique tour, booked by Artist Direct, beginning in May with former American Music Club front man Mark Eitzel and McCaughey's Minus 5. Since Skerik, Martin, and Buck played on Eitzel's \"West,\" due May (J on Warner Bros., they will also back the singer live. Buck and Martin also play on the Minus 5 album, tentative- ly titled \"The Lonesome Death Of Buck McCoy.\" The set is due May 6 from McCaughey's new Hollywood Records-distributed Malt label. \"It is going to be sort of a double- headliner tour that is going to be a seamless night of music,\" Martin says. \"We will do some Tuatara music, then Mark will come out and we will do some of his music, and Scott will come out and do some of his songs . . . It will be a revolving night of music. \"We are all really excited about this, because none of us have ever done anything like this, and we've never seen anything like this,\" Mar- tin adds. \"It's not a standard kind of tour with an opening band and a head- line band. It's just going to be seven guys, playing different instruments, different forms of music, in a very dif- ferent sort of atmosphere. It won't be the typical bombastic, loud, rock'n'roll scenario.** Breaking Records' Treehouse Debuts On New Hootie Label I BY MELINDA NEWMAN NEW YORK— As one Atlantic exec- utive says with atypical record com- pany bluntness: \"We're fully aware that the name Treehouse means nothing to anybody right now.\" But if the label has its way, that will change very soon. Treehouse, a four-piece from Liv- erpool, England, is the first band signed to Hootie & the Blowfish's new Atlantic-distributed label. Breaking Records. \"Nobody's Mon- key\" comes out April 1. Breaking Records execs certainly weren't thinking about signing over- seas acts when they started the imprint last year, but the label prin- cipals realized they had to trust where the music led them. \"We're a Southern-based label [Columbia, S.C.], but we heard this tape and it really blew us away, and then we saw them live,\" recalls Breaking Records VP/GM John Cald- well. \"It came to a point where we said, 'We know they're from England and it presents a logistical problem, but we think they need to be heard.' ** While Breaking Records went to distant shores to find its premiere act, the members of Treehouse simi- larly left their native country to find fortune. Fully aware that they were not in vogue with the Britpop sound coming out of the U.K., the band — composed of lead singer/songwriter Pete Riley, bassist Paul O'Brien, drummer Abe Juckes, and guitarist Keith Thomas — felt it stood a better chance if it came to America. \"We'd played gigs in England and showcased, but in the end, they were trying to make our music more Brit- pop than it was,\" says Riley. \"A lot of the British bands are just cloning each other. The type of music we're playing is happening over here in America. M With that in mind, the band saved its money and came to Los Angeles for two weeks, armed with a number of gigs at venues like the Whisky a Go Go as well as two impromptu acoustic dates at a Borders book- store. The band came to Breaking Rec- ords' attention after a friend at Sony Music Publishing, aware of Tree- house from its L.A. trip, sent Cald- well the band's tape. A quick jaunt to England confirmed what the advance promised: Treehouse was a band with good, catchy alterna-rock songs made even better by the group's energetic live performances. Its sound is much more akin to a Gin Blossoms or Del Amitri than its new bosses, Hootie & the Blowfish. \"As much as I respect Hootie, we don't sound anything like them,\" says Riley. \"We're much harder as a live band. The public is intelligent and will see Treehouse for what they are. This is not Hootie or Cravin' Melon.\" Atlantic Records director of product development Pat Creed notes, it was never Hootie & the Blowfish's intention to ink bands in its own image. \"They signed them because they like them, not because they sound like them. It's like asking Alanis Morissette if she's like [Mav- erick Records founder] Madonna.\" While Treehouse might not sound much like Hootie & the Blowfish, the band has taken a page from Hootie's successful playbook: hitting the road hard. Even though \"Nobody's Mon- key\" doesn't come out for several weeks, Treehouse has been playing clubs in the Southeast, where it has relocated, since January. Riley understands the reasoning but still finds it strange to play with no album to sell. \"I find it totally weird, because after people see the band, people want the album, and it's like, 'Uh, why are we doing this?' But I think there's a method in the mad- ness. They want to get the band some exposure, and we've already got a mailing list of 1,000 people just for TREEHOUSE the U.S.\" \"We want to have them build up a live following,\" says Creed. \"When you're trying to introduce a band that doesn't have a following anywhere, your options are fairly limited. You can't just go to radio and say, 'Play these guys.' There has to be a spark from somewhere. We didn't want to be in a position of just releasing a record and saying, 'This is a great record, play it.' \" The touring is where Hootie & the Blowfish's connection has really come into play. Through the band's many, many years of Southeastern club touring before it was signed to Atlantic, it has built up an unparal- leled nest of connections. \"As an organization, Hootie & the Blowfish have built up a lot of good- will in the Southeast,\" says Caldwell. \"We plan on taking advantage of the relationships we have. We have them in clubs they need to be in. We have them opening for established acts.\" Treehouse is booked by Metro Tal- ent The idea is that by the time the first single, \"Daddy Inside,\" comes out in a few weeks, the band will mean something to a number of radio programmers. The single will go to commercial alternative, rock, triple- A. and college stations. \"College figures very strongly into our plans,\" Creed says. \"The South- east has a tremendous amount of col- leges, and while the college radio charts have a lot of alternative acts on them, your average college stu- dent is often a mainstream music fan. We're going to drag them over to any college that they're near and maybe do a show in the union, go down to the local record store. We told them, 'Don't plan on getting a good night's rest for at least another year.* \" 16 BILLBOARD MARCH 1 . 1 997 AGI Salutes the Grammy® Nominated Art Directors February, 1997 AGI Sa I u tes r« u i u u i y , 1 9 Category 70 Best Recording Package 1 .SET THE TWILIGHT REELING Stefan Sagmelster, oil director (Lou Reed) [Warner Bros.

On the music side, many labels are reacting to a changed market by cutting back on releases and looking for efficiencies wherever they can. But the industry must go one step further and look at its competitors and the people out- side the industry in a different way. Major film companies have tossed a coin, giving up foreign sales to competitors who will share risks on a new film. Music companies must be able to look at their competitors as partners, too. The music industry must also go outside the traditional circle. There are many new players in town, including technology com- panies such as Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and Netscape. These com- panies are learning the entertain- ment business. The entertainment business has to learn theirs, so the two can work together for mutual interests. This doesn't mean the music industry needs to make a technol- ogy product. But w r e can learn to use their technology to sell our music products better. As an industry, we should stick to our knitting and make great music. But we need new tricks — and technology is the best trick of all — to make sure people buy the music we make. The Internet is one of the indus- try's strategic inflection points. We look at the Internet as a new marketing vehicle and build label sites that feature audio- and videoclips of our best artists. But is that enough? To keep music on one's own label site doesn't take advantage of the World Wide Web. Yes, pay tolls, royalty struc- tures, and free plays need to be resolved. But to keep the music to ourselves defeats the Web's power of dissemination. What is one radio station versus millions? We've got to experiment now with new approaches on the Internet, and find partners to help us. We also have to be able to listen to music retail even more closely. But, at the same time, we have to explain to our retail partners why direct online sales from music labels is necessary and inevitable. Labels must find ways to justify Heard uture!

In many cases, Web promotion against a specific artist comes out of the marketing budget. But as the Web becomes more like TV, music con- sumers will demand even more from their music sites, increasing the costs for the labels. Traditional business structures in all industries are changing. The music industry needs new percep- tions of its own business. The music industry needs to be its sharpest to get the best out of the newest new techno"
