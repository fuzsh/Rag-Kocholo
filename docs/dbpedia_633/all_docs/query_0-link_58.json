        "text": "Don Grusin (born April 22, 1941) is an American jazz keyboardist, composer, and record producer. He is the younger brother of Dave Grusin.\n\nCareer\n\nDon Grusin grew up in Denver, Colorado. His father, a native of Latvia, was a classical violinist. His brother, Dave Grusin, is a pianist, record producer, and co-founder of GRP Records. He graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a bachelor's degree in sociology and a master's degree in economics. In the early 1970s, he was an economics professor in Guadalajara, Mexico. Soon after, he taught economics at Foothills College in California.\n\nGrusin performed in Bogota, Colombia as a member of Azteca, a Latin jazz fusion band led by Pete Escovedo which included Escovedo's daughter, drummer Sheila E. The trip sparked a lifelong interest in Latin music. In 1975, Quincy Jones invited him to tour with his band, and Grusin was persuaded to leave teaching for a career in music. He worked as a studio musician on albums by Randy Crawford, Billy Eckstine, Joe Pass, and the Pointer Sisters. He formed the fusion group Friendship with Lee Ritenour, Ernie Watts, and Alex Acuña and recorded one album, then released solo albums in 1981 and 1983. In 1985, he produced the album Musician for Ernie Watts, and it won a Grammy Award. His live album The Hang (Sovereign Artists, 2004) received a Grammy Award nomination. He won Grammy Awards for his work on two albums by the Paul Winter Consort. He won an Echo Award for the album Quality Time, recorded with Peter Fessler.\n\nAs a record producer or keyboardist, he has worked with Gerald Albright, Patti Austin, David Benoit, Larry Carlton, Oscar Castro-Neves, Dori Caymmi, Gilberto Gil, Jim Hall, Sérgio Mendes, Airto Moreira, Milton Nascimento, Flora Purim, Nelson Rangell, Brenda Russell, Zoot Sims, Leon Ware, and Sadao Watanabe.\n\nDiscography\n\nAs leader\n\n10k–LA (JVC, 1981)\n\nDon Grusin (JVC, 1983)\n\nSticks and Stones (GRP, 1988)\n\nRaven (GRP, 1990)\n\nZephyr (GRP, 1991)\n\nNo Borders (GRP, 1992)\n\nNative Land (GRP, 1993)\n\nBanana Fish (GRP, 1994)\n\nLaguna Cove (Don Grusin Music, 1998)\n\nTraveling Fancy (Floreria/Nippon Crown, 2004)\n\nThe Hang (Sovereign, 2004)\n\nBetter Than Christmas with Natali Rene (Nati, 2004)\n\nOld Friends and Relatives (Video Arts Music, 2005)\n\nGeography with Bill Sharpe (JVC, 2006)\n\nPiano in Venice (JVC, 2008)\n\nOne Night Only with Dave Grusin (CARE Music Group, 2011)\n\nTrans Atlántica with Bill Sharpe (Universal Music of Japan, 2012)\n\nQuality Time with Peter Fessler (CARE, 2013)\n\nAs sideman\n\nWith Ernie Watts\n\nMusician (Qwest, 1985)\n\nSanctuary (Qwest, 1986)\n\nWith Oscar Castro-Neves\n\nMaracuja (JVC, 1989)\n\nTropical Heart (JVC, 1993)\n\nAll One (Mack Avenue, 2006)\n\nWith Dori Caymmi\n\nDori Caymmi (Elektra, 1988)\n\nBrazilian Serenata (Qwest, 1991)\n\nKicking Cans (Qwest, 1993)\n\nWith Ricardo Silveira\n\nSky Light (Verve, 1989)\n\nAmazon Secrets (Verve, 1990)\n\nWith Sadao Watanabe\n\nMaisha (Elektra, 1985)\n\nSweet Deal (Elektra, 1991)\n\nWith Eric Marienthal\n\nRound Trip (GRP, 1989)\n\nEasy Street (Verve/Polygram, 1997)\n\nWith Tom Browne\n\nBrowne Sugar (Arista/GRP, 1985)\n\nFunkin' for Jamaica (Phantom Sound & Vision, 2002)\n\nWith Lorraine Feather\n\nThe Body Remembers (Bean Bag, 1997)\n\nCafe Society (Sanctuary, 2003)\n\nWith Shakatak\n\nFull Circle (Inside Out Music, 1994)\n\nAcross the World (Secret, 2011)\n\nWith others\n\nI Never Was a Cowboy, Kenji Omura and Kazumi Watanabe (Alfa, 1978)\n\nMomento Brasileiro, Billy Eckstine (Som Livre, 1979)\n\nFriendship (Elektra, 1979)\n\nFeel the Night, Lee Ritenour (Elektra, 1979)\n\nNightingale, Gilberto Gil (WEA International, 1979)\n\nWhistling Midgets, Dan Dean and Tom Collier (Inner City, 1981)\n\n4x4, Casiopea (1982)\n\nChampion, Tom Jans (Pony Canyon, 1982)\n\nMaybe, Yasuko Agawa (JVC, 1983)\n\nTwo Eyes, Brenda Russell (Warner Bros., 1983)\n\nTV, Mari Nakamoto (JVC, 1984)\n\nWhitestone, Joe Pass (Pablo, 1985)\n\nYauaretê, Milton Nascimento (Columbia, 1987)\n\nVício, Simone (Columbia Brasil, 1987)\n\nWait for Me, Kate Markowitz and Christine Trulio (Pony Canyon, 1989)\n\nUrban Daydreams, David Benoit (GRP, 1989)\n\nLove Is Gonna Getcha, Patti Austin (GRP, 1990)\n\nDear Friends, Abraham Laboriel (Mesa/Bluemoon, 1993)\n\nForbidden Fruit, Marion Meadows (Novus, 1994)\n\nMoments, Hiroko Kokubu (JVC, 1995)\n\nRatamacue, Harvey Mason (Atlantic, 1996)\n\nHere in My Heart, Kenny Rankin (Private Music, 1997)\n\nState of the Heart, Bill Sharpe (Instinct, 1998)\n\nTocando Tierra, Frank Quintero (Latin World Entertainment Group, 1999)\n\nPrincess T, Naoko Terai (Video Arts Music, 2000)\n\nSpeak No Evil, Flora Purim (Narada, 2003)\n\n30 Miles, Natali Rene (Nati, 2006)\n\nTo learn more about the artist, please visit"
