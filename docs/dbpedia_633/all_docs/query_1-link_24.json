        "text": "Compiled from 3 years worth of recordings, from live sets to mastered tracks, our new compilation “Praeface” stands as a guide to where Praemedia has been and where, as a new label, it is going.\n\nTracing various intersections of genres from improvisational jazz to plunderphonic electronics to field recordings, diverse splinters and fragmented roots sprout off into calm matrixes of sound. From Japan (Haco) through New York (The Gold Sparkle Band) to Italy (Mou, Lips!), the sounds merge in San Francisco. Pioneers of networked computer music (Tim Perkis) mix with modern masters (Wobbly), alongside unheard musicians and odd collaborations. Avant-jazz damaged blues sparks drum and bass roots to forage in an electrostatic world.\n\nFor all the monstrous mutations and shattered boundaries, the effect is soothing tranquility. Music for the ears. Precious gifts of sound open up in small fragments across the landscape of the disc, referencing comfortable moments of the familiar and merging them with a childlike fascination for the new.\n\nva - praeface (praemedia)\n\nthe experimental scene is expanding enormously. there are numerous labels which treat the issue of the noisy sound and the experimental tendencies. one of those labels is the new praemedia label. usually when a new label is introduced by its first edition, it is done with a compilation which reflects the sound image that will be presented by that label. this is what praemedia did with praeface, their first compilation edition. radically eclectic, compiled from live recordings, but also mastered tracks, praeface is a direction that shows where praemedia is and where it is going to be directed to as a new label. from improvising jazz, glitch, cut up electronica, field recordings to calm ambiental pieces and contemporary pop. not many well known names, but surely interesting enough and new which are yet to come on the scene. the tracks on this compilation are maybe their first serious initial impact. it is left for us to see… what will happen with these artists, and with this label. it is left for us to see…\n\nwww.fakezine.tk\n\nVarious Artists: Praeface CD\n\nThe San Francisco-based label Praemedia released a compilation featuring 16 tracks by a collection of rather unknown artists. A few names keep returning in the musical projects featured here, like Shannon Fields, Lance Grabmiller, Martin Nieznanski and Tim Perkis.\n\nPraeface features a rich variation of hard to categorize musical styles. What most songs have in common is the combintion of electronics and traditional instruments and the relatively fast rhythm. The rhythm can even be very hectical, like in the uptempo track by Tim Perkis, during the cacaphonous, constantly changing sample-cut up track by Wobbly and Ma++ Ingalls or the stress generating contribution by HSoA.\n\nCalmness returns when Stars like Fleas combine instruments like banjo, pedal steel, bass clarinets and cello to come up with a melancholic piece in which sad male vocals accentuate the general atmosphere.\n\nQuite American's contribution is completely different again. They use a site recording from a park in India in which a boy keeps asking for his mother and add a dominant peeping of a swing to it.\n\nShannon Fields and Martin Nieznanski together contribute a piece consisting of minimalistic repetitive guitar strings, whereas morse-like electronics, high peeps and electronic hiss are generated by the duo Nanaqui.\n\nEach song is completely different from the other, even when the same people are involved. Praeface contains a rich variety of improvisational music, showing the wide range of possibilities. If the listener can appreciate all this is a good question.\n\nPhosphor Magazine\n\nc/o Paul Bijlsma\n\nBänschstrasse 71\n\n10274 Berlin\n\ntel: 0049-30-44356459\n\nhttp://www.xs4all.nl/~phosphor\n\nPRAEFACE (CD compilation by Praemedia)\n\nTIM PERKIS - MOTIVE (CD by Praemedia)\n\nSTARS LIKE FLEAS - SUN LIGHTS DOWN ON THE FENCE (CD by Praemedia)\n\nPraemedia is a new label who kick off with three CD releases at once. Like many labels do, they kick off with a compilation CD, to show what they are standing for, which they claim to be from improvisational jazz to plunderphonics and field recordings. And for once (?) that is no lie. It's an hotch-potch of music, a high pressure cooker of all sorts of musics. This is shown in the first tracks already: the jazzy opening lines of 'Twovers' by Hsoa, the micro-beats from Mou, Lips! against the samples of Lance Grabmiller (many of the pieces are duo, collaborative pieces) and the more microsoundings of Nanqui. And so continues this CD, with tracks by Tim Perkis, Stars Like Fleas, Quiet American, Wobbly (plunderphonics at work here of course), Martin Nieznanski and Ernesto Diaz-Infante.Quite a nice collection, which made me curious about the other CDs.\n\nThe second CD is by Tim Perkis, an US electronic musician whose music was released on Tzadik, Artifact, Sonore and Meniscus and who has played with Fred Frith, Kaffe Mathews and John Zorn, to name but a few. The eight pieces on 'Motive' were released as MP3s in 2002, although the work was recorded in 2000 and now as a real CD by Praemedia. Perkis uses rhythmical sounds, stretches them a little bit and they all play in loop mode. Occasionally one could think that the input are drum & bass samples, but maybe it's just lifted drum samples from records. In either case, I found it very hard to find a good spot here. None of the eight tracks really could grab me and made a spark.Rather ok sort of electronic music, but once it's over you don't have the faintest idea what you heard.\n\nStars Like Fleas is the result of a collaboration Montgomery Knott of Austin and multi-instrumentalist and producer Shannon Fields. The press blubr cite as influences people like Gastr Del Sol, Talk Talk, Microstoria, Charles Mingus and Nobukazu Takemura, of which I think the first is most valid, other then it seems to me that Stars Like Fleas love to sample their music, rather then play it themselves (although one never knows whith a multi-instrumentalist). The music is quite swollen, a bit romantic, a bit jazzy, loungy but I must admit the vocals, by Montgomery, are not so much to my liking. He's neither David Grubbs nor Mark Hollis. He sings a bit held back, like he doesn't want to sing for real. In each song the vocals remain the same thing throughout the entire CD. Also musicwise, it stays very much on the same level, so that the whole lot of eleven songs is a bit hard to swallow at once. Maybe an extended cdep of six songs would have been enough (I know it would for me). Rated from one to ten I'd give a solid six.\n\n- Frans de Waard from Vital Weekly number 398 - http://staalplaat.com/vital_archive/398.txt\n\nVarious artists\n\nPraeface Praemedia\n\nPraecd001\n\n2003\n\nSan Francisco and the Bay Area have been the theatre of a surge in experimental music activity in the early 2000s. Praemedia is one of the many small independent labels that popped up as a result. But if Pax Recordings, Edgetone, and even Accretions focus mostly on free improvisation, Praemedia’s manifesto hits closer to the laptop. And the compilation album Praeface, the label’s first release, does sound like a manifesto. We are treated to tracks from upcoming albums by Stars Like Fleas (a New York collective belonging to the circle of --- i.e. sharing members with -- the No-Neck Blues Band and Gold Sparkle Band) and Tim Perkis, pieces by the people who carry the label on their shoulders (Lance Grabmiller, Shannon Fields, and Martin Nieznanski, in various combinations), and contributions from a cast of international friends, including ex-Tu M’s Mou, Lips!, Wobbly, and Haco. Most of the tracks feature computer treatments of source recordings, be them field recordings, acoustic or electric instruments. The mood is kept rather quiet and serene, with a couple pieces introducing a thumping beat, but nothing harsh to startle you. Highlights include Fields’ collaboration with The Gold Sparkle Band (Emphasis Mine), Grabmiller;s duo with fellow Abstractions member Ernesto Diaz-Infante (Electrostatic Blues), Fields’ extensive treatment of Daniel Carter’s flute and Matt Lavelle’s bass clarinet in Solo Flute C and a beautiful trio by Haco, Lisle Ellis, and Grabmiller. This is a first step for the label, but it is by no mean tentative. Praeface describes a precise esthetic; we’ll just have to see if it becomes a springboard for new ideas or a constricting canvas.\n\nFrançois Couture, All-Music Guide\n\nsfsound.org radio\n\nMUSIC CURRENTLY IN ROTATION\n\nas of October 2004\n\n+ deconstructing beck - [ illegalart ]\n\n+ phillip greenlief - stalking andrei [ evander music ]\n\n+ luc ferrari - petite symphonie intuitive pour un paysage de printemps [ fixed media ]\n\n+ michael thompson - miniatures, and rain falls like tears [ fixed media ]\n\n+ kent jolly - bell box, cymbal, holding pattern [ fixed media ]\n\n+ thom blum - cycle, j-wake, nomen plaid [ fixed media ]\n\n+ cliff caruthers - resist, owl in daylight, killaloe moon, natoma [ fixed media ]\n\n+ joseph anderson - loch lomand, changes music, mpingo, kyai pranaja [ fixed media ]\n\n+ tony schwartz - standing here at the present time...
