        "text": "French postcard. Film Gaumont.\n\nAimé Simon-Girard (1889-1950) was a French film actor and operetta singer. He mostly played in French costume films of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nSimon-Girard, originally Aimé Max Simon, was born in Paris in 1889 as the son of the tenor Nicholas Simon-Max and the soprano Juliette Simon-Girard. Thanks to his artistic parents he first pursued a career as operetta singer, and with success. Soon he became a star in the Parisian theatres with the nom Simon-Girard. On the eve of the First World War, he started in film, playing opposite Gabriel de Gravone in La maison du baigneur (1913) by Adrien Caillard. The following year he met the man who would launch him into cinema stardom: Henri Diamant-Berger. They made one short film together (Loin des yeux, près du coeur, 1914), but during the war Simon-Girard mostly continued working on stage. In 1921, though, his old friend gave him the leading part of D'Artagnan in the twelve part silent serial Les Trois Mousquetaires (Henri Diamant-Berger 1921), not the first film adaptation of the novel of Alexandre Dumas but a very popular one and Simon-Girard’s screen breakthrough role. Simon-Girard played opposite actors such as Henri Rollan (Athos), Charles Martinelli (Porthos), Pierre de Guingand (Aramis), Claude Mérelle (Mylady de Winter), Jeanne Desclos (Anne of Austria), Édouard de Max (Richelieu) and Charles Dullin (Le Père Joseph). Soon after cinema veteran Louis Feuillade asked him for another twelve part serial: Le fils du flibustier (1922), with Georges Biscot, Sandra Milovanoff and a debuting Gaby Morlay. In 1923 Simon-Girard directed a short himself, La belle Henriette, with Germaine Webb. By now Simon-Girard was type-casted as period piece actor, as in Vert galant (René Leprince 1924), an eight part serial on the life of the French king Henri IV, followed by two other eight part serials in costume: Fanfan-la-Tulipe (Leprince 1925) which was reshot in 1952 with Gérard Philipe, and Mylord l’arsouille (Leprince 1925). His costars in these three serials were actors such as Claude Mérelle, Joë Hammann, Claude France, Maria Dalbaicin, Pierre de Guingand and Simone Vaudry. In the late 1920s Simon-Girard played in the comedy Les transatlantiques (Pierre Colombier 1927) on an American family visiting France, and in La grande amie (Max de Rieux 1928).\n\nBecause of his fine voice, the passage to sound cinema was not a real obstacle for Simon-Girard, who debuted in sound film with Les quatre vagabonds, directed by Lupu Pick, the Rumenian master of German Kammerspielfilm. Simon-Girard wrote the French dialogue and adaptation of Les quatre vagabonds. He plays Pierre who suspects one of four young vagabonds has murdered the suitor of his beloved Marie (Simone Bourday). Next, Simon-Girard resurrected D’Artagnan once more in the sound version of Les trois mousquetaires (1932), again directed by Diamant-Berger, but this time with Blanche Montel as Constance, Harry Baur as Tréville, Edith Meyra as Mylady de Winter, and Andrée Lafayette as Anna of Austria, the French queen. Tired of the period pieces, Simon-Girard henceforth focused on the stage, also recording in 1934 his songs like L’amour en fleurs (the French version of Gracie Fields’ Love in bloom) and Cocktails pour deux (Cocktails For two), with artists such as Django Reinhardt being part of the orchestra of Michel Warlop. Incidentally Simon-Girard returned to the set to play a reporter in Arsène Lupin, detective (1937), which had Jules Berry in the title role, while Simon-Girard played the title role (a small one) in the Fernandel comedy François premier (Christian Jaque 1937). He also played king Henri IV twice in Les perles de la couronne (Sacha Guitry 1937) and in the comedy Alexis gentleman chauffeur (Max de Vaucorbeil, René Guissart 1938). Simon-Girard ‘s last parts were in Le cavalier noir (Gilles Grangier 1944) starring Georges Guétary, and the two-part film Mandrin (René Jayet 1947), staring José Noguéro. Aimé Simon-Girard died in Paris in 1950. All in all, he acted in some 20 films between 1921 and 1948.\n\nSources: IMDB, French and English Wikipedia, www.cineartistes.com/fiche-Aim%E9+Simon-Girard.html\n\nFrench postcard by A.N., Paris, no. 442. Photo: Engberg. Georges Lannes as the Cardinal de Rohan in Le Collier de la reine/The Queen's Necklace (Tony Lekain, Gaston Ravel, 1929).\n\nGeorges Lannes (1895–1983) was a French film actor who appeared in more than a hundred films during his career (1920-1961). Lannes peaked with the serial Les Mystères de Paris (Charles Burguet, 1922) in which he had the lead as prince Rodolphe.\n\nIn 1920-1922 Georges Lannes acted in ten films by Charles Maudru, starting with Près des cimes (1920) and Le Droit de tuer (1920), and including the Zola adaptation L'Assommoir (1921), in which Lannes played Lantier, the young, lazy worker, who abandons his wife Gervaise (Louise Sforza) and their two children. His co-actors with Maudru were e.g. Gaston Jacquet and Suzanne Delvé. He peaked with the serial Les Mystères de Paris (Charles Burguet, 1922) in which he had the lead as prince Rodolphe. The serial, based on Eugène Sue's story, was in 12 episodes and had a cast with many familiar names such as Huguette Duflos, Andrée Lionel, Gilbert Dalleu, Camille Bardou, Suzanne Bianchetti, and in smaller parts Pierre Fresnay, Madeleine Guitty, Gaston Modot, Sarah Duhamel, Simone Vaudry and Régine Dumien. Prince Rodolphe takes care of a young street prostitute, Fleur-de-Marie (Duflos), but a jealous countess Sarah Mac Gregor (Lionel) manages to convince people from the low life to denounce Fleur-de-Marie, so she is sent to prison. In the end, after many adventures, the girl returns to Rodolphe while the countess, dying, confesses to Rodolphe Fleur-de-Marie is his lost daughter.\n\nGeorges Lannes also played important parts in e.g. L'Abbé Constantin (Julien Duvivier, 1925) starrinng Jean Coquelin and Claude France, André Cornélis (Jean Kemm, 1926) with Malcolm Tod in the title role and again Claude France, Le Collier de la reine (Gaston Ravel, Tony Lekain, 1929) with Marcelle Chantal and Diana Karenne, and L'Emigrante (Léo Joannon, 1939) with Edwige Feuillère. From the 1930s Lannes's parts became smaller but he still continued to act in film with a high frequency. Lannes also directed films such as Le Petit Jacques (with Georges Raulet, 1923), and played on stage in the 1940s, while one his last parts was that of Louis XIII in the French telefilm Les Trois mousquetaires (Claude Barma, 1959), starring Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\nSources: Wikipedia and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nFrench postcard. Photo Sartony. A.N., Paris, series Les Vedettes de Cinéma, nr. 96.\n\nLéon Mathot was a French actor and director, born 1886 in Roubaix and died 1968 in Paris. Mathot became well-known for his role of Edmond Dantès in the French serial Le comte de Monte Christo (1918), directed by Henri Pouctal. He is also known for his role in Coeur fidèle (1923) by Jean Epstein.\n\nAfter passing his youth in Liège, Belgium, and following the Conservatory there, Léon Mathot started to play on stage in Lyon, then Brussels and Paris. Thanks to his friend Lucien Nonguet who shot short comedies at Pathé, Mathot started in cinema in 1906, playing extra’s, his first one being La course à la perruque, a André Deed comedy directed by Georges Hatot and André Heuzé. Between 1911 and 1914 he played in dozens of the Gontran comedies, often directed by Nonguet. Alongside he also played in dramatic films by directors Henri Andréani and Alfred Machin, mainly for the Belge-Cinéma. During the First World War Mathot switched to the Film d’Art company, where he worked with young director Abel Gance, such as in Les gaz mortels (1916). His collaboration with Henri Pouctal started with the film Volonté (1917) and culminated in 1917-1918 with the serial Le comte de Monte Christo, which made Mathot an over night star. Mathot played the leading character of Dumas’ classic novel, Edmond Dantès, who takes revenge on the people who had him imprisoned and forgotten, after he has come into possession of a huge treasure and a new identity. This was followed by other films by Pouctal like Travail (1919), a film in seven chapters on a steel factory, in which Mathot again had the male lead, opposite Huguette Duflos as the female leading character. Mathot’s reputation only grew during the 1920s while playing in popular French silent films like L'ami Fritz (René Hervil 1920), again with Duflos ; the serial L'empereur des pauvres (René Leprince 1922), with Gina Reilly; Cœur fidèle (Epstein 1923), with Gina Manès; L’Auberge Rouge (Epstein 1923), again with Manès; Mon oncle Benjamin (Leprince 1923), Le mirage de Paris (Jean Manoussi 1925), Le puits de Jacob (Edward José 1926), with Betty Blythe; Yasmina (André Hugon 1927), with Duflos; Le mystère de la Villa Rose (René Hervil & Louis Mercanton 1930), with Simone Vaudry; and La maison de la flèche (Henri Fescourt 1930), with Annabella.\n\nWhen he sensed that his star was descending, Léon Mathot started to combine acting with directing, first with Carmine Gallone in Celle qui domine (1927) and afterwards with André Liabel in Dans l’ombre du harem (1928), L’instinct (1929) and L’appassionata (1929). When sound cinema became the norm in French cinema, Mathot exclusively focused on film direction. He only performed twice again in Passeport 13 444 (1931) which he directed himself and in Deuxième Bureau contre Kommandantur (1939) by René Jayet and Robert Bibal, his last role as actor. In the 1930s he first directed various vehicles for the comic singer George Milton (La bande à Bouboule, Bouboule 1er roi des nègres, Embrassez-moi, Nu comme un ver, Le comte Obligado) and the adaptation of an operetta for comedian Dranem (La Mascotte). He then focused on spy films, filming two of the four adventures of « Capitaine Benoît » after « Ceux du SR » by Charles-Robert Dumas (Les loups entre eux, 1936 et L’homme à abattre, 1937). He then switched again, adapting Gaston Leroux’ Chéri-Bibi (filmed 1938), starring Pierre Fresnay; it has been considered one of Mathot’s best films. In 1938 he also adapted Maurice Larroy’s novel Le révolté, which was scripted by the joung Henri-Georges Cluzot, and meant one of the first serious roles of René Dary (four years after, Mathot would direct her again in Forte tête, 1942). After a short return to comedy with Le bois sacré (1939) after the play by Flers and Cavailet, Mathot filmed Rappel immédiat (1939) with Erich von Stroheim and Mireille Balin, a striking spy film. He also tried his luck with exotic melodrama in Aloha, le chant des ïles (1937), starring Arletty, and showed interest in nomads in 1941 with Cartacalha, reine des gitans which confirmed the career of Viviane Romance. Critics appreciated Mathot’s adaptation of Daudet’s Fromont jeune et Risler aîné (1941), with Mireille Balin.\n\nAfter the war Mathot alternated melodrama (La route du bagne, 1945, with Viviane Romance), with ‘film policier’ (Le dolmen tragique, 1948, with Paulette Dubost) and adventure (La dernière chevauchée, 1948, with Balin and Jacques Dumesnil). Mathot also shot a pseudo-biographie of Marcel Cerdan, played by the famous boxer himself (L’homme aux mains d’argile, 1949). After having supervised La rue sans loi (1950), directed by Marcel Gibaud, Mathot ended his career with a short return to comedy (Mon gosse de père, 1953). Mathot was vice-chair (1938-1959) and later on chair of the Cinémathèque française (1959-1967). He was also chairman of the l’Union Européenne des Techniciens du Film et de la Télévision.\n\nSources : French and English Wikipedia, IMDB.\n\nItalian postcard by G.B. Falci, Milano, no. 65. Photo: Cines-Pittaluga. ,b>Dria Paola as Maria in Pergolesi (Guido Brignone, 1932). The man left could be Elio Steiner as Pergolesi.\n\nContent of the film: In 1736 Giovan Battista Pergolesi Elio Steiner) falls in love with an aristocratic girl, Maria (Dria Paola), but her brother, Nicola d'Arcangeli (Livio Pavanelli), opposes to their relationship, considering the musician of too low birth and equally too low musical qualities. The two beloved decide to flee together, but they are caught. The girl is brought back to the family castle and forced to marry a rich aristocrat, Raniero di Tor Delfina (Carlo Lombardi), while Pergolesi, overcome with grief, decides to lock himself up in a convent in Naples, where he will die.\n\nNB In 1932 Brignone shot the film both in a French and an Italian version at the Cines film studio in Rome, while for the French version Brignone was assisted by Henry Valbel. Much work was made of the reconstruction and insertion of Pergolesi's original music, as well as of the reconstruction and evocation of the historical setting of 18th century Naples. The Italian version, staring Elio Steiner and Dria Paola, the stars of Italy's first sound feature La canzone dell'amore (Gennaro Righelli, 1930), came out on 29 September 1932 in Rome. The French version was released one year after as Les amours de Pergolèse, with Pierre Richard-Willm in the title role and Simone Vaudry as Maria. Cines-Pittaluga artistic director Emilio Cecchi gave costume designer Gino Carlo Sensani his debut in this film. Sensani would revolutionize historical costume design in Italian film (his assistant Maria De Matteis would continue this, while her assistant, the recently passed away Piero Tosi, not only followed this interest and professional rigor but even went beyond what Sensani had one). Producer of Pergolesi was Baldassarre Negroni, who in the silent era had been one of Italy's major directors of film divas such as Francesca Bertini and his wife Hesperia. Cinematographer of Pergolesi was Ubaldo Arata, who shot over 100 films between 1918 and 1949, and has become famous for his cinematography of classic titles such as Rotaie (Mario Camerini, 1929), La signora di tutti (Max Ophüls, 1934), Scipione l'Africano (Carmine Gallone, 1937), and Roma, città aperta / Open City (Roberto Rossellini, 1945). Arata collaborated with Anchise Brizzi, who had already started in 1914 and would continue until 1962, doing some 116 films, among which 1860 (Alessandro Blasetti, 1933), with Arata: Scipione l'Africano, and Sciuscià (Vittorio De Sica, 1946). Instead, set design was by the little known Giovanni Spellani, who had a modest career in Italian film set design between 1927 and 1942.\n\nThe Italian Cines company, in its early years as a sound film production company, regularly appropriated Italian opera. Italian film historian Gian Piero Brunetta, in his book Il cinema italiano di regime (2009), writes that while other nations quickly got away of making a kind of cinematic, sound film opera, in Italy the idea stuck for quite some time. Working for Cines, Guido Brignone first filmed La Wally in 1930 and should have filmed the opera L'Italiana in Algeri the subsequent year. In 1932 he shot Pergolesi, as Brunetta writes, \"a work not without scenographic and spectacular ambitions (with references to Longhi and Jean-Antoine Watteau and accurate reconstructions of 18th century Naples.)\" In the special issue (No. 16, 2017) of Immagine, the journal of the Italian Association for Film Historical Research (AIRSC), dedicated to the Cines-Pittaluga, Paola Maganzani has published an article about the two versions of Pergolesi by Brignone, and relates it to the strategies and techniques of film production at Cines-Pitaluga in the early 1930s. She concludes that while the press found the film too stagy, this was not the fault anymore of pioneering sound technology but apparently a wilful style of filming. The press criticized that in-depth research into the composer, his music, his life, and the historical setting, was not enough to make a vivid, convincing film. Where in La Wally landscapes served to illustrate the music, in Pergolesi the composer's music had become an illustrative soundtrack, supporting the emotional highs and lows of the protagonists. Yet, in hindsight, Maganzani suggests, we may still cherish the showcase of talent in this film.\n\nDria Paola (1909-1993) was an Italian film actress of the 1930s and 1940s. Her name is attached to the first Italian sound film La canzone dell’amore (1930) by Gennaro Righelli.\n\nFrench postcard in the Series Nos artistes dans leur loge, no. 249. photo: Comoedia.\n\nSuzy Renard (?-?) was a stage actress who had a small film career too.\n\nRenard did the Conservatoire in Paris, but according to the stage journal La Rampe she received a harsh judgment by the jury in 1918, but she did won second prize in the categorie comedy. Still, the same year she joined a tournee around France with the play La Reine Wanda, starring Pierre Magnier. The next year, in 1919, the Comédie Française engaged Renard for its Summer tour, where she debuted in Le Dépit amoureux. December 1919 she acted at the Comédie française in Les Soeurs d'amour by Bataille, starring Léon Bernard and Thérèse Kolb, January 1920 in Trivelino and Scaramouche, and June 1920 in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, with Albert Lambert fils as Romeo and Mlle Piérat as Juliet, in addition to Paul Mounet, Dehelly, Jean Hervé, Alcover, etc. The Summer of 1920 Renard acted with the same company in Hernani. Renard, though, never became a pensionnaire nor a sociétaire of the Comédie. In the satirical journal Les Potins de Paris, her collaboration with the respectful Comédie Française was even criticized and ridiculed. Anyway, Renard apparently left the Comédie after one year and focused on light comedy on the stage. In 1921 she could be spotted in a supporting part in Le Chasseur de chez Maxim's, performed at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris, and starring Adrien Le Gallo, Pierre Bressol, and Jane Marken.\n\nRenard debuted in cinema in 1918, in the Gaumont drama Le Noël d'Yveline (Georges-André Lacroix, 1918), also with Suzy Prim and Simone Vaudry. In 1920 she was with Blanche Ritier one of the leads in the Film d'Art production Illusions by Jean Manoussi. The male lead was for newcomer Jean Lord, a pseudonym possibly for Manoussi himself. Other parts were for Pierre Batcheff and Gaston Jacquet. Her last part according to IMDB was in a short, La revanche de Suzanne (1921), for whom he director is unknown. Renard's male co-actor was Jacques Guilhène. Yet, this was not her real last film. In 1924 Renard seems to have been also in a Feydeau adaptation, the comedy Un fil à la patte, by Robert Saidreau, and starring Armand Bernard. Renard is listed at IMDB as Suzanne Renard for this film, but papers from 1924 indicate it was Suzy.\n\nSources: IMDB, Gallica.\n\nFrench postcard, no. 254. Photo: G.L. Manuel Frères, Paris.\n\nSimone Vaudry (1906-1993) was a popular French actress of the silent era and the early sound era.\n\nSimone Vaudry was born Simone Hélène Georgette Vaurigaud in Paris. At the age of four she was already acting in silent films, debuting in the Gaumont-production Le crime du grand-père (1910) by Léonce Perret, in which Suzy Prim co-acted. After various productions at Gaumont by Perret and others, from 1913 on Vaudry started to play in films by Éclair as well, directed by Victorin-Hippolyte Jasset. During the First World War Vaudry did not act in film, but in 1918 she reappeared in film in Le Noël d’Yveline (Georges-André Lacroix 1918), Vaudry’s first feature, and again a Gaumont film with Prim. After that followed Les élus de la mer (Marcel Dumont, Gaston Roudès 1921), L’épingle rouge (Edouard-Emile Violet 1921), Le double (Alexandre Ryder 1921), Mimi Pinson (Théo Bergerat 1922), the drama Le mouton noir (Chalux 1922), and the fairy tale La belle au bois dormant/Sleeping Beauty (Stéphane Passet 1922). In 1922 Vaudry also played Henriette d’Angleterre in the Dumas adaptation Vingts ans après by Henri Diamant-Berger, a serial in ten chapters. It was the sequel to Diamant-Berger’s adaptation of Les trois mousquetaires (1921). She also had an important part in the Benito Perojo drama Para toda la vida (1923), in Les Rantzau (Gaston Roudès 1923), La bouquetière des innocents (Jacques Robert 1923), Les cinquante ans de Don Juan (Henri Etievant 1924), and L’enfant des halles (René Leprince 1924). In 1924 Vaudry had her first lead in a German film: Das lockende Gefahr (Josef Stein 1924) and also had small part in the 12 episodes serial Les mystères de Paris (Charles Burguet), starring Huguette Duflos. A much bigger part Vaudry had as Nina in the 8 episodes long Mylord l’Arsouille (Leprince 1924), starring Aimé Simon-Girard, and immediately after she had the female lead as Perrette in Fanfan-la-Tulipe (Leprince 1925), with again Simon-Girard in the male lead. All these films by Leprince were for the Société des Cinéromans.\n\nAfter a minor part in Les petits (Dumont/Roudès 1925), Simone Vaudry had the female lead again in La rose effeuillée (Georges Pallu 1925), on the life of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, who was beatified in 1923 and canonized in 1925. A complete, tinted copy of this previously considered lost film was traced back at the Roman film archive in the mid-1990s, but is yet to be represented. In 1936 Pallu would shoot a sound version of the film. After a small part in another religious film, Le berceau de dieu (Fred LeRoy Granville 1926), Vaudry went to Berlin to play in Martin Berger’s Die Kreuzzug des Weibes (1926), a film which criticized abortion laws, starring Conrad Veidt and Maly Delschaft. Vaudry subsequently alternated performances in French films with German films: Titi, le roi des gosses (Leprince 1926), La nuit de la revanche (Etievant 1926), Pardonnée (Jean Cassagne 1927), in which Vaudry had the female lead, and Le chasseur de chez Maxim’s (Roger Lion, Nicolas Rimsky 1927) in France, and Der Herr des Todes (Hanns Steinhoff 1927), Das Meer (Peter Paul Felner 1927), and Heimweh (Gennaro Righelli 1927) in Germany. In the late silent era Vaudry played the daughter of Francesca Bertini and Warwick Ward in Mein Leben für das Deine (Luitz-Morat 1928), based on Sardou’s melodrama Odette, and had small parts in the operetta film Der fidele Bauer (Franz Seitz 1929) and Les Fourchambault (Georges Monca 1929).\n\nWhen sound arrived in France, Vaudry immediately had female leads in La maison des hommes-vivants (Dumont/Roudès 1929), starring Rudolf Klein-Rogge, and Le mystère de la villa rose (René Hervil, Louis Mercanton 1930), starring Léon Mathot. In the latter film she was a phony fortune teller, who witnesses the killing of a rich woman by a band of murderous thieves and is herself suspected of the murder. After a major part in the comedy Quand te tues-tu? (Roger Capellani 1931), shot at the Paris Paramount studios, Vaudry had the female lead in the period piece L’aiglon (1931), directed by Viktor Tourjansky and based on the famous play by Edmond Rostand. Next followed the female lead in the Georges Milton comedy Le roi du cirage (Pierre Colombier 1931), the Franco-Italian co-production Les amours de Pergolèse (Guido Brignone 1932), with Pierre-Richard Willm in the title role and Vaudry in the female lead, Georges Pallu’s film on Saint Bernadette of Lourdes: La vierge du rocher (1933), the Franco-Italian musical comedy Trois hommes en habit/ Tre uomini in frack (Mario Bonnard 1933), starring singer Tito Schipa, and the comedy Je te confie ma femme (René Guissart 1933), starring Arletty. Vaudry’s last part was in the René Lefèvre comedy Le coup de trois/Koho jsem vcera libal (Jean de Limur 1936), partly shot in Prague, then Czechoslovachia. It is not known what she did afterwards. Simone Vaudry died in 1993 in Puteaux, France.\n\nSources: www.encyclocine.com/index.html?menu=5213\n\nwww.imdb.com/name/nm0890993/\n\nwww.cineartistes.com/\n\nFrench postcard by Cinémagazine, no. 278.\n\nAimé Simon-Girard (1889-1950) was a French film actor and operetta singer. He mostly played in French costume films of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nSimon-Girard, originally Aimé Max Simon, was born in Paris in 1889 as the son of the tenor Nicholas Simon-Max and the soprano Juliette Simon-Girard. Thanks to his artistic parents he first pursued a career as operetta singer, and with success. Soon he became a star in the Parisian theatres with the nom Simon-Girard. On the eve of the First World War, he started in film, playing opposite Gabriel de Gravone in La maison du baigneur (1913) by Adrien Caillard. The following year he met the man who would launch him into cinema stardom: Henri Diamant-Berger. They made one short film together (Loin des yeux, près du coeur, 1914), but during the war Simon-Girard mostly continued working on stage. In 1921, though, his old friend gave him the leading part of D'Artagnan in the twelve part silent serial Les Trois Mousquetaires (Henri Diamant-Berger 1921), not the first film adaptation of the novel of Alexandre Dumas but a very popular one and Simon-Girard’s screen breakthrough role. Simon-Girard played opposite actors such as Henri Rollan (Athos), Charles Martinelli (Porthos), Pierre de Guingand (Aramis), Claude Mérelle (Mylady de Winter), Jeanne Desclos (Anne of Austria), Édouard de Max (Richelieu) and Charles Dullin (Le Père Joseph). Soon after cinema veteran Louis Feuillade asked him for another twelve part serial: Le fils du flibustier (1922), with Georges Biscot, Sandra Milovanoff and a debuting Gaby Morlay. In 1923 Simon-Girard directed a short himself, La belle Henriette, with Germaine Webb. By now Simon-Girard was type-casted as period piece actor, as in Vert galant (René Leprince 1924), an eight part serial on the life of the French king Henri IV, followed by two other eight part serials in costume: Fanfan-la-Tulipe (Leprince 1925) which was reshot in 1952 with Gérard Philipe, and Mylord l’arsouille (Leprince 1925). His costars in these three serials were actors such as Claude Mérelle, Joë Hammann, Claude France, Maria Dalbaicin, Pierre de Guingand and Simone Vaudry. In the late 1920s Simon-Girard played in the comedy Les transatlantiques (Pierre Colombier 1927) on an American family visiting France, and in La grande amie (Max de Rieux 1928).\n\nBecause of his fine voice, the passage to sound cinema was not a real obstacle for Simon-Girard, who debuted in sound film with Les quatre vagabonds, directed by Lupu Pick, the Rumenian master of German Kammerspielfilm. Simon-Girard wrote the French dialogue and adaptation of Les quatre vagabonds. He plays Pierre who suspects one of four young vagabonds has murdered the suitor of his beloved Marie (Simone Bourday). Next, Simon-Girard resurrected D’Artagnan once more in the sound version of Les trois mousquetaires (1932), again directed by Diamant-Berger, but this time with Blanche Montel as Constance, Harry Baur as Tréville, Edith Meyra as Mylady de Winter, and Andrée Lafayette as Anna of Austria, the French queen. Tired of the period pieces, Simon-Girard henceforth focused on the stage, also recording in 1934 his songs like L’amour en fleurs (the French version of Gracie Fields’ Love in bloom) and Cocktails pour deux (Cocktails For two), with artists such as Django Reinhardt being part of the orchestra of Michel Warlop. Incidentally Simon-Girard returned to the set to play a reporter in Arsène Lupin, detective (1937), which had Jules Berry in the title role, while Simon-Girard played the title role (a small one) in the Fernandel comedy François premier (Christian Jaque 1937). He also played king Henri IV twice in Les perles de la couronne (Sacha Guitry 1937) and in the comedy Alexis gentleman chauffeur (Max de Vaucorbeil, René Guissart 1938). Simon-Girard ‘s last parts were in Le cavalier noir (Gilles Grangier 1944) starring Georges Guétary, and the two-part film Mandrin (René Jayet 1947), staring José Noguéro. Aimé Simon-Girard died in Paris in 1950. All in all, he acted in some 20 films between 1921 and 1948.\n\nSources: IMDB, French and English Wikipedia, www.cineartistes.com/fiche-Aim%E9+Simon-Girard.html\n\nFrench postcard by Editions Cinémagazine, no. 423.

Dulac, Epstein, Luitz-Morat, Duvivier, Dreyer and Poirier.\n\nMaurice Schutz was born August 4th, 1866 in Paris, as Paul Maurice Schutzenberger. He started a career as stage actor from the 1890s, in plays like Lysistrata (1892), Madame Sans-Gene (1893), L’Aiglon (1900) and Théroigne de Méricourt (1902), the latter two at the Theatre Sarah Bernhardt. He already played occasionally in cinema in the 1910s, e.g. playing Grandcoeur in the French revolution drama Quatre-vingt treize (Albert Capellani/ André Antoine 1914) but this film was only released in France in 1921. Schutz’s film career only really took off after the First World War, with films like Sa gosse (Henri Desfontaines 1919) with Elmire Vautier, Irene (Marcel Dumont 1920) with Marcel Vibert, Au-delà des lois des hommes (Dumont, Gaston Roudès 1920) with Rachel Devirys, Maître Évora (Roudès 1920) with Regina Badet, the Daudet adaptation Fromont jeune et Risler ainé (Henry Krauss 1921) with Maurice Escande, La douloureuse comédie (Théo Bergerat 1921) with Stacia Napierkowska, and Lily Vertu (Daniel Bompard 1921) with Huguette Duflos. Schutz played the industrialist Marcel Anavan, father of protagonist Marc (Léon Mathot) in the serial L’Empereur des pauvres (René Leprince 1921), as well as the father of the title character in Prisca (Roudès 1922) and the grandfather of the family Larade in the naturalist countryside drama L’âtre (Robert Boudrioz 1922), which co-starred Charles Vanel and Charles de Féraudy. In 1922 he played the Duke of Alva in the period piece Les Opprimés by Henry Roussel. He was Dr. Artez in the Jules Claretie adaptation Le petit Jacques (Georges Lannes, Georges Raulet 1923) and in the next year he acted in the Spanish drama Para toda la vida/Pour toute la vie (1924) by Benito Perojo and with Rachel Devirys and Simone Vaudry. In the early 1920s, Schutz had a very active film career, always playing the older man he by then had become himself.\n\nBy the mid-1920s his parts became bigger. He had the male lead in Germaine Dulac’s Gossette (1925), with Régine Bouet in the title role. He played the title role himself in Luitz Morat’s period piece Jean Chouan (1925), which co-starred René Navarre. He had another male lead – even a double role - in Jean Epstein’s adaptation of George Sand’s Mauprat (1926), which co-starred Sandra Milovanoff and Nino Costantini, while he had a major supporting part in Luitz-Morat’s Le Juif errant (1926), after the novel of Eugène Sue. After parts in Le Bonheur du jour (Gaston Ravel 1927) with Pierre Batcheff and Elmire Vautier, and Abel Gance’s mega-production Napoléon (1927), Schutz starred in Julien Duvivier’s L’agonie de Jérusalem (1927) as a retired professor living in Jerusalem who discovers his son is involved in a network of anarchists in Paris. Maurice Schutz then played two memorable parts, first as one of the clerical judges in Carl Dreyer’s la Passion de Jeanne d’Arc (1928), starring Renée Falconetti and Sylvain, then as the old marshall of the Empire in the First World War drama Verdun, visions d’histoire (Léon Poirier 1928), with Thomy Bourdelle.\n\nMaurice Schutz made a smooth passage to French sound cinema, acting in early French sound films like L’Arlésienne (Jacques de Baroncelli 1930) and the Lord of the Manor in Dreyer’s Vampyr (1932), although the latter was rather a silent film with sound effects. While Schutz played opposite Blanche Montel in the former, he acted with Julian West aka Nicolas, Baron de Gunzburg, in the latter. In the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s, Schutz continued to act in many French films but most of his parts were small by now and some even uncredited. Major parts he had in Fantômas (Pàl Fejos 1932) with Bourdelle as Inspector Juve, Goupi mains rouges (Jacques Becker 1943), and Danger de mort (Gilles Grangier 1947). His last part was in Marc Allégret’s La demoiselle et son revenant (1952), while his last contribution to the film world was lending his voice to the French animation film La bergère et le ramoneur (Paul Grimault 1952, released 1953). Maurice Schutz died on March 22, 1955, in Clichy-la-Garenne, near Paris. He played in c.100 films.\n\nSources: IMDB, French Wikipedia, Ciné-Artistes, BiFi.\n\nFrench postcard by Cinémagazine, no. 71.

He is most known as Élie, the son of Sisif (Séverin-Mars) in Abel Gance’s La Roue (1920-1923).\n\nGabriel de Gravone, born Antoine Paul André Faggianelli on 21. November 1887 at Ajaccio, Corsica, France, started his career as film actor in 1909. Probably his first film was Un clair de lune sous Richelieu, a period piece by Albert Capellani and scripted by Abel Gance, who would later call him back for his masterpiece La Roue. Capellani directed Gravone a few times, most notably in the four part episode film Les Misérables (1912, released 1913), in the role of Marius opposite Maria Fromet as Cosette. Between 1912 and 1914 Gravone was the partner of Aimée Campton with the Pathé comedy series with the character “Maud” and of Cauroy in the “Papillon” comedies by Gaston Roudès. During the First World War Gravone hardly acted in film but in 1919 Louis Mercanton directed him in the feature L’appel du sang, based on the novel by Robert Hichens and co-starring Charles Bargy and Ivor Novello.\n\nIt was the subsequent film, however, that gave Gravone lasting fame: the modern tragedy La Roue/The Wheel (1920-1923), directed by Abel Gance. Gravone played Élie, the son of Sisif (Séverin-Mars) and a passionate violinist. Both men are in love with Sisif’s foster daughter Norma (Ivy Close), whom Sisif has once saved from a train wreck. His love for Norma turns Sisif violent and jealous, though, and when she leaves by train with Hersan (Pierre Magnier), an engineer from town, he almost wrecks the train. He is blinded by steam and is reduced to servicing a little funicular at the Mont-Blanc mountain, aided by his son Élie. When Norma returns with her now husband, love between Élie and Norma returns. Hersan, jealous, fights Élie and both men are killed, falling down. Norma stays to help the old and blind Sisif until his death. See also the biography of Séverin-Mars for more details.\n\nAfter La Roue, Gravone became a very active in French silent cinema, until the mid-1920s. First in the Daudet adaptation L’Arlésienne (1921/22) by André Antoine, then L’ombre du péché by Yakov Protazanov (1922) with Diana Karenne, the Gaston Leroux adaptation Rouletabille chez les bohémiens (Henri Fescourt 1922) with Édith Jéhanne, Petit ange et son pantin (Luitz Morat 1923), Le mariage de minuit (Armand Du Plessy 1923) with Rita Jolivet, the Prevost adaptation Les demi-vierges (Du Plessy 1924), the ghost story Le manoir de la peur (Alfred Machin/Henri Wulschleger 1924, released 1927) costarring Romuald Joubé, Mimi Pinson (Théo Bergerat 1922/1924) with Simone Vaudry, L’Ornière (Edouard Chimot 1924) with Gabriel Signoret, Michel Strogoff (Victor Tourjansky 1925) starring Iwan Mozzhukin, La cavalcata ardente (Carmine Gallone 1925) starring Soava Gallone, and finally Gravone played the Biblical Abel in Le berceau de dieu/The Cradle of God (Fred Leroy-Granville 1926). In 1926 he also directed himself the film Paris, Cabourg, le Caire… et l’amour. After that he didn’t perform in films anymore. Gabriel de Gravone died 5. December 1972 in Marseille.\n\nSources: IMDB, www.filmsdefrance.com, www.cinema-francais.fr/les_acteurs/acteurs_d/de_gravone_g...\n\nFrench postcard. Editions Cinémagazine, No. 38. Photo G. Fontaine.\n\nGeorges Lannes (1895–1983) was a French film actor who appeared in more than a hundred films during his career (1920-1961). Lannes peaked with the serial Les Mystères de Paris (Charles Burguet, 1922) in which he had the lead as prince Rodolphe.\n\nIn 1920-1922 he acted in ten films by Charles Maudru, starting with Près des cimes (1920) and Le Droit de tuer (1920), and including the Zola adaptation L'Assommoir (1921), in which Lannes played Lantier, the young, lazy worker, who abandons his wife Gervaise (Louise Sforza) and their two children. His co-actors with Maudru were e.g. Gaston Jacquet and Suzanne Delvé.\n\nLannes peaked with the serial Les Mystères de Paris (Charles Burguet, 1922) in which he had the lead as prince Rodolphe. The serial, based on Eugène Sue's story, was in 12 episodes and had a cast with many familiar names such as Huguette Duflos, Andrée Lionel, Gilbert Dalleu, Camille Bardou, Suzanne Bianchetti, and in smaller parts Pierre Fresnay, Madeleine Guitty, Gaston Modot, Sarah Duhamel, Simone Vaudry and Régine Dumien. Prince Rodolphe takes care of a young street prostitute, Fleur-de-Marie (Duflos), but a jealous countess Sarah Mac Gregor (Lionel) manages to convince people from the low life to denounce Fleur-de-Marie, so she is sent to prison. In the end, after many adventures, the girl returns to Rodolphe while the countess, dying, confesses to Rodolphe Fleur-de-Marie is his lost daughter.\n\nLannes also played important parts in e.g. L'Abbé Constantin (Julien Duvivier, 1925) starrinng Jean Coquelin and Claude France, André Cornélis (Jean Kemm, 1926) with Malcolm Tod in the title role and again Claude France, Le Collier de la reine (Gaston Ravel, Tony Lekain, 1929) with Marcelle Chantal and Diana Karenne, and L'Emigrante (Léo Joannon, 1939) with Edwige Feuillère. From the 1930s Lannes's parts became smaller but he still continued to act in film with a high frequency. Lannes also directed films such as Le Petit Jacques (with Georges Raulet, 1923), and played on stage in the 1940s, while one his last parts was that of Louis XIII in the French telefilm Les Trois mousquetaires (Claude Barma, 1959), starring Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\n18th May 2016 at the V&A (Europe 1600-1815 galleries), London SW7.\n\nThe Harpsichord was a popular instrument in Europe between the 15th and 18th centuries. Pressing a key on the instrument's keyboard lifts a jack (a long strip of wood) that holds a small plectrum (a wedge-shaped piece of quill, now usually plastic), which plucks the string. When the player releases the key, the jack falls back and a felt damper at the top of the jack stops the string vibratiing. The term harpsichord is used to cover a family of instrument, but more specifically a grand-piano-shaped instrument with a triangular case accommodating long bass and short treble strings. Harpsichords can have one, two, and sometimes even three keyboards, which are called manuals. Single manual harpsichords usually have two sets of strings per note, whilst double manual harpsichords usually have a third set of strings that sounds one octave higher than played. The upper manual was originally used for transposing; and later for contrast of tone with the ability to couple the registers of both manuals for a fuller sound.\n\nThis instrument was made by the Vaudry family of Paris in 1681. It is the one of the earliest French objects to be decorated with Chinoiserie. It is a double-manual Harpsichord.\n\nHarpsichords are assigned the number 314.122-6-8 in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification of musical instruments (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs ), indicating:\n\n3 = Chordophone. Instruments where the sound is primarily produced by the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points.\n\n31 = Simple Chordophones. Instruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer\n\n314 = Board Zither. Instrument uses a string bearer that is shaped like a board, or is the ground.\n\n314.1 = Instrument with strings parallel to the string bearer.\n\n314.12 = Instrument has a resonator.\n\n314.122 = Box Zither. Instrument has a resonator made from slats.\n\n314.122-6-8 = Strings are caused to vibrate by plectrum and keyboard."
