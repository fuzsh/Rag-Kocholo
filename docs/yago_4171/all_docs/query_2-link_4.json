        "text": "One of Abel Gance's early creation, before he focused his time of long epics. He still tests morals as a professor experiments with a type of gas on animals and humans to see what effects it has. While it has a darker side, the drama is for the most part not very interesting. Not poorly crafted, just not at the level Gance's major films where the acting is untouchable. This was just average.\n\nTrifling silent era entertainment from Abel Gance that takes a while to really offer any stakes but the 15 minute finale intercutting between two separate suspense sequences set in motion by respective halves of a scheming antagonist couple (a coral snake marauding a sleeping kid and man on a gas-mask-clad horse racing to stop a cloud of poisonous gas drifting towards a populated area) is worth the price of the admission alone as a slice of serial-style pulp. Plus, Gance puts some great compositions in here, very smart use of reflections in a few shot framings and lovely outdoor footage besides.\n\nNot uninteresting, especially with all the WWI-relevant narrative content about the morality of creating poisonous gas!\n\n1916\n\nA fairly scattershot early effort from Gance, this has some compelling shots and intriguing ideas - especially considering it's at least in part a film about the cultivation of poison gas produced while deep in the throws of the first World War - but it's still kind of a slog to get through, even at hardly over an hour in length.\n\nThere's something endearing about Gance's earnestness here. His desire to entertain is palpable, and the whole thing is so overstuffed with incident that it's easy to see the seeds that would later bloom into the likes of La Roue."
