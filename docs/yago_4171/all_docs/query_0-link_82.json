        "text": "This article assesses a realm of psychoanalytic social theory that is relatively under-discussed – existential psychoanalysis – in order to gain further insight into the relationship of psychoanalytic ideas to humanism. I offer a reading of certain influential thinkers in this tradition, namely Jean-Paul Sartre, Ludwig Binswanger and Medard Boss, presenting conceptual clarifications while highlighting a cluster of important aspects of their respective repertoires relevant to humanism. I do so with the intention of teasing out how contributing voices to existential psychoanalysis negotiate humanism’s foundational ideas, specifically the notion of ‘the individual subject’, with the bed-rocks of psychoanalytic thought, namely the unconscious. Finally, I conclude with critical commentary on the existential-psychoanalytic project drawn from what is often thought of as the anti-humanist tradition, with specific attention paid to Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault.\n\nSince the creation of the Marxian alienation theory, the development of the productive labour and new philosophical insights has made this theory obsolete. In this paper, a concept of alienation, free from essentialism and historicism, will be proposed. This alienation theory starts from the most fundamental source of knowledge to the human existence: our sensuous experience of the material world. The existentialist notion of alienation focuses on the free intention and defines alienation as the distortion of this intention when the individual praxis are put into a system that makes the consequences of the individual praxis alien to the agent. I argue that work within the frames of modern capitalism by this definition is alienating. This alienation is reinforced by the immaterial, indirect character of the work in an economy where human knowledge becomes the principal force of production and where the physical-sensory faculties of the human being consequently are rendered superfluou...\n\nThis paper traces the development of Sartre’s metaphysics with three interrelated aims in mind. The first is to situate Sartre’s metaphysical views in relation to those of his predecessors, his contemporaries, and ours. The second is to show that Sartre’s project to turn his phenomenology towards reality informs some of the key changes he makes to his existentialism during his career. The third is to bring Sartre the metaphysician into dialogue with key thinkers in the current realism/anti-realism debate in continental philosophy by showing that the defense of materialism he offers in his later work preserves many hard-won insights of phenomenology and has significant advantages over many contemporary articulations of realism.\n\nJournal for Cultural and Religious Theory ( JCRT 15.1 Fall 2015) Violence and the Gift Guest Editors: In his 1943 Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre concludes that the relationship with the other is always characterized by conflict. No need to be a Sartre scholar to be familiar with the quote L'enfer, c'est les autres or Hell is: Other People. In his 1960 Critique of Dialectical Reason, the other is understood as the realm of alienation: the other is that which can take hold of, control, our freedom. Like in Being and Nothingness, the existence of the other results in a struggle for freedom; this implies that the relationship with the other is always characterized by conflict. In the following, I will focus on a text Sartre wrote in the period between the publications of the two above-mentioned works, more precisely on his exploration of the gift in his posthumous Notebooks for an Ethics. Sartre’s interest in the debate on the gift was triggered by Marcel Mauss, who inspired him to rethink the theme of the other—Sartre was at that time looking for a way to think about the other as the other, a path, to be sure, that he abandoned later on. I propose to follow this alternative route by re-reading some passages on the gift as they appear in Notebooks for an Ethics. Notebooks was written in 1947 and 1948 as an attempt to redeem a promise formulated near the end of Being and Nothingness, namely to elaborate on the ethical implications of the work and to publish an ethics in the future. However Sartre left that project, and the texts remained unpublished until 1983, three years after his death."
