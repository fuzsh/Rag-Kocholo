Her international breakthrough role was that of the high class prostitute Rosemarie Nitribitt in Das Mädchen Rosemarie/Rosemary (1958).\n\nGerman postcard by Ufa, Berlin-Tempelhoff, no. CK-170.

Her parents were the actor Anton Tiller and the operetta singer and actress Erika Körner.\n\nFrom 1945 on, she studied at the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar and till 1949 at the Musik- und Schauspielakademie. She got an engagement at the Theater in der Josefstadt. Meanwhile she also worked as a model, and won the Miss Austria contest twice, in 1949 and 1951. The Miss Austria title caused her dismissal at the Theater in der Josefstadt, but it turned out to be her ticket into film making.\n\nIn 1949, she acted opposite O.W. Fischerin Märchen vom Glück/Kiss Me Casanova (Arthur de Glahs, 1949). Many roles as a vamp in German and Austrian light entertainment films followed.\n\nIn 1954 she worked with director Rolf Thiele in the successful Sie/She with Marina Vlady. Her next film for Thiele, Die Barrings/The Barrings (1955) with Dieter Borsche, became her artistic breakthrough. Until 1970 Thiele and Tiller would make eleven films together, including Friederike von Barring (1956) and Lulu/No Orchids for Lulu (1962), with Mario Adorf.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions P.I., Paris, no.

Photo: Klaus Collignon / Ufa.\n\nScandal\n\nNadja Tiller’s international breakthrough role was that of the high class prostitute Rosemarie Nitribitt in Das Mädchen Rosemarie/Rosemary (Rolf Thiele, 1958). The film, based on a murder scandal of the year before, was a huge, international success. It confirmed the assumption of post-war, American audiences that European actresses were somehow more sensuous and erotic than their Hollywood counterparts.\n\nTiller won a Best Actress award at the Film Festival of Venice for the role. There she was offered roles in Antonioni's La notte (1961), Fellini's La dolce vita (1960), and Visconti's Rocco e i suoi fratelli/Rocco and his Brothers (1960), but she had to decline all three for familiar reasons (she was pregnant).\n\nLater she would appear at the side of such international stars as Jean Gabin, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Rod Steiger, Yul Brynner and Michael Caine, but it did never bring her the status which she could have had with the three roles she had to say no to.\n\nShe did appear in the international productions The Rough and the Smooth (Robert Siodmak, 1959), Du Rififi chez les femmes/Rififi Among the Women (Alex Joffé, 1959) with Robert Hossein, An einem Freitag um halb zwölf/On Friday at Eleven (Alvin Rakoff, 1961), L'Affaire Nina B./The Nina B. Affair (Robert Siodmak, 1961), the thriller La chambre ardente/The Burning Court (Julien Duvivier, 1962), and Anima nera/Black Soul (Roberto Rossellini, 1962) with Vittorio Gassman, and she stayed popular among the art house public.\n\nGerman postcard by Ufa (Universum-Film Aktiengesellschaft), Berlin-Tempelhof, no.

During the 1970s and 1980s she worked for theatres in Lübeck, Berlin and Vienna. A great success was her leading role in the Kurt Weill musical Lady in the Dark.\n\nIn 1997 she appeared at the Hamburger Kammerspielen as the elder Hollywood diva Joan Crawford in the play Nächte mit Joan (Nights with Joan) by Cas Enklaar. A year later she also starred in the TV-adaptation directed by Horst Königstein with Rita Tushingham as Bette Davis.\n\nHer most recent feature films were the road movie Barfuss/Barefoot (Til Schweiger, 2005) in which she played the mother of the main character played by director Til Schweigerhimself, and the crime comedy Dinosaurier/Dinosurs (Leander Haussmann, 2009) with Eva-Maria Hagen.\n\nIn 1956, Nadja Tiller married actor Walter Giller, whom she had met at the set of the music film Schlagerparade/Hit Parade (Erik Ode, 1953). They were called the 'Traumpaar der Wirtschaftswunder-Ära' (Dream Couple of the Wirtschaftswunder era) in the 1950s, and often worked together.\n\nNadja Tiller was honoured with many awards, including the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Germany's Cross of Merit) in 2000. Together with her husband she received a Bambi Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. Giller died in 2011. They had two children, Natascha (1959) and Jan-Claudius (1964). Nadja Tiller lives in a retirement home in Hamburg.\n\nVintage card.\n\nGerman postcard by Universum-Film Aktiengesellschaft (Ufa), Berlin-Tempelhof, no. FK 3842. Retail price: 25 Pfg.

It made little Pablito Calvo (1948–2000) a European film star.\n\nItalian postcard by Ed. Villaggio del Fanciullo, Bologna. Photo: E.N.I.C.

Publicity still for Marcelino, pan y vino/The Miracle of Marcelino (1955).\n\nOrphan in a monastery\n\nPablito Calvo was 8 years old when he played the lead role in Marcelino, pan y vino (1955), literally Marcelino, bread and wine.\n\nThe Spanish film was written by José María Sánchez Silva, who based it on his novel, and directed by Ladislao Vajda. The story, revised and modernised in both the book and film, dates back to a medieval legend, one of many gathered together in a volume by Alfonso el Sabio. Cinematographer Heinrich Gartner was responsible for the beautiful black-and-white photography.\n\nPablito plays Marcelino, an orphan abandoned as a baby on the doorstep of a monastery in nineteenth-century Spain. The monks raise the child, and Marcelino grows into a a mischievous young sprout. Yearning for friends his own age, the boy inadvertently causes all sorts of havoc. One day when he eats his small meal in a room full of old things, he gives a piece of his bread to an old wooden Jesus figure - and indeed it takes the bread and eats it. Getting a wish granted for his donation Marcelino wishes to see his mother...\n\nAt the 1955 Cannes Film Festival the film won an award, and at the 5th Berlin International Film Festival it won the Silver Bear. Pablito, who had received a special mention from the Cannes festival jury, became Spain's most famous child actor. The film became one of the first Spanish films to become successful in the USA.\n\nThe following year Pablito appeared in Mi tío Jacinto/Pepote (Ladislao Vajda, 1956) which won the Golden Bear (Audience Award) at the Berlin International Film Festival. After some more films, he retired from acting in 1963. He was 16 and had decided to become an industrial engineer.\n\nMarcelino, pan y vino (1955) remains one of the most famous and successful Spanish films ever made. There were many remakes, including a Philippine TV version, Marcelino pan y vino (Mario O'Hara, 1979), an Italian remake, Marcellino (Luigi Comencini, 1991), an animated TV series, Marcelino Pan y Vino (2000-2001, 2004), and a Mexican remake, Marcelino Pan y Vino (Jose Luis Gutierrez, 2010), with the basic storyline and framed by the Mexican Revolution of 1910. None of these remakes was as successful as the original.\n\nItalian postcard by Ed. Villaggio del Fanciullo, Bologna. Photo: E.N.I.C.

He appeared in 109 films between 1910 and 1946. Navarre is best remembered as the mysterious master criminal Fantômas in the legendary serial by Louis Feuillade.\n\nFrench postcard. Photo: DIX, Paris.\n\nFrench postcard by Cinémagazine, no. 109.\n\nMaster Criminal\n\nVictor René Navarre was born in Limoges in 1877.\n\nAt the age of 16 he already debuted on stage at the Théâtre de Montmartre in Victorien Sardou’s play Patrie (Homeland). For 15 years he would perform everywhere, in Paris and all over the country.\n\nLate 1909, he started to work for the Gaumont film company and would become part of the regular cast of Gaumont dramas and comedies, directed by Albert Capellani, Georges Denola, Etienne Arnaud, Michel Carré, Georges-André Lacroix, Henri Fescourt, Léonce Perret, and above all, Louis Feuillade.\n\nHe often performed next to child star Clement Mary, the future René Dary, in Feuillade’s series of Bébé. He also played detective Jean Dervieux in Le proscrit/The outlaw (Louis Feuillade, 1912) and various other shorts in 1912-1913.\n\nFeuillade immortalised Navarre by offering him the role of the master criminal in Fantômas (Louis Feuillade, 1913-1914), a serial based on the dime novels by Marcel Allain. This enormously popular serial had five episodes: Fantômas – A’ l’ombre de la guillotine/Fantômas - In the Shadow of the Guillotine, Juve contre Fantômas/Juve Against Fantômas, Le mort qui tue/The Dead Man Who Killed, Fantômas contre Fantômas/Fantômas Against Fantômas, and Le faux magistrat/The False Magistrate.\n\nThe story of Fantômas's exploits and adventures are also those of the woman he loves and the men trying to catch him. In a time when films still used novelty to draw crowds these shorts entertained audiences with exhilarating escapes, astounding disguises, and taboo violence. Next to Fantômas and the head of police Juve (Edmund Breon), there were three supporting characters, the journalist Jerome Fandor (Georges Melchior), Fantomas’ mistress Lady Beltham (Renée Carl) and princess Danidoff (Jane Faber) who returned in almost every episode.\n\nFrench postcard (both sides). Photos: Société des Cinéromans. René Navarre, Gina Manès and many others in the French silent film Le 7 de trèfle/Le sept de trèfle (1921), directed by René Navarre. The film was scripted by Gaston Leroux (The Phantom of the Opera). It was a serial in 12 episodes and was released in France on 16 September 1921. This card promotes its screening at the Toulouse based cinema Olympia, 13, rue St Bernard. It still exists as Cinema ABC.\n\nVidocq\n\nWhen the Great War broke out, Navarre was conscripted, interrupting the Fantomas series. He managed to get back to the studios in 1915, having become a star.\n\nHe first did Le grand souffle/The Great Breath for Gaston Ravel and then decided to found his own production company, Films-René-Navarre, and to direct his own films.\n\nIn 1916 he co-directed with Gérard BourgoisChristophe Colomb/Christopher Columbus, starring Georges Wague and Jean Garat. The following year he produced four animation films by Emile Cohl and Benjamin Rabier but after a quarrel with Cohl the series was interrupted.\n\nIn September 1919 Navarre founded the company Société des Cinéromans, which until 1922 produced eight prestigious productions based on scripts by Gaston Leroux and Arthur Bernède, such as Tue-la-mort/Kill the Dead Man (René Navarre, 1920) with Navarre in the title role, Jacqueline Arly and Madeleine Aile, L’aiglonne (René Navarre, Emile Keppens, 1921) with Cyprian Gilles and Suzy Prim, Vidocq (Jean Kemm, 1923) with Navarre in the title role, Jean Chouan (Luitz-Morat, 1925) with Navarre and Maurice Schutzin the title role, and the serial Belphégor/The Phantasm of the Louvre (Henri Desfontaines, 1927).\n\nIn 1920, producer Serge Sandberg had appointed him manager of the Studios de la Victorine in Nice, and he also continued with his Films René Navarre as for Ferragus (Gaston Ravel, 1923) in which he had the title role, next to Stewart Rome.\n\nFrench postcard for Production Charles Le Fraper, Paris. Photo: L. Pierson. Publicity still for Judex (Maurice Champreux, 1934).\n\nForgotten\n\nThe arrival of sound film drastically cut René Navarre’s career short. His performance was considered too theatrical.\n\nHe had to be satisfied with minor parts, as in Jean Gabin’s debut Mephisto (Henri Debain, Georges Vinter, 1930). He also played supporting parts in a sound version of Fantômas (Paul Féjos, 1932), and that of Judex (Maurice Champreux, 1933).\n\nIn 1937 Léon Mathot gave him the role of Monsieur Charles in Chéri-Bibi (Léon Mathot, 1938), in which Pierre Fresnay played the title role. Other small parts Navarre played were in La route enchantée/The Enchanted Road (Pierre Caron, 1938) with Charles Trenet, and in Brazza ou l’épopée du Congo/Brazza of the Epic of the Congo (Léon Poirier, 1939).\n\nAfter a last performance in Les surprises de la radio/The surprises of the radio (Marcel Aboulker, 1940), he quited the screen altogether. René Navarre was married to the actress Nelly Palmer and subsequently to Elmire Vautier. He had with both actresses a child, but both marriages ended in a divorce.\n\nIn 1968, the man who as Fantômas had frightened millions, died forgotten in Azay-sur-Cher, France. René Navarre was 90.\n\nScenes from Erreur tragique/Tragic Error (Louis Feuillade, 1913) with Suzanne Grandais and René Navarre. Music: Patrick Laviosa.

DeMille's epic The Ten Commandments (1956) and Elvis Presley’s film debut Love Me Tender (1956). Later, she had a career in Europe too. In Germany she starred in Fritz Lang's two-film adventure saga Der Tiger von Eschnapur/The Tiger of Eschnapur (1959) and Das Indische Grabmal/The Indian Tomb (1960) and in Italy she also made a pair of films.\n\nGerman postcard by Kunst und Bild, Berlin, no. A 240. Photo: 20th Century Fox.\n\nBritish postcard in the Picturegoer Series, London, no. W 977. Photo: 20th Century Fox.\n\nAn Arabian Nights princess\n\nDebra Paget was born as Debralee Griffin in Denver, Colorado, in 1933. She was one of the five children born to former actress Margaret Allen (née Gibson) and painter Frank Henry Griffin.\n\nHal Erickson at AllMovie: “She may have hailed from Denver, but actress Debra Paget had the sensual, exotic demeanor of an Arabian Nights princess.” And yes, the family moved from Denver to Los Angeles, California, in the 1930s to be close to the developing film industry. Debra was enrolled in the Hollywood Professional School when she was 11.\n\nStage mother Margaret was determined that Debra and her siblings would also make their careers in show business. And indeed, three of her siblings, Marcia (Teala Loring), Leslie (Lisa Gaye), and Frank (Ruell Shayne), entered show business. Paget had her first professional job at age 8, and acquired some stage experience at 13 when she acted with Charles Coburn in a 1946 production of William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor.\n\nHer first notable film role was as Teena Riconti, girlfriend of the character played by Richard Conte, in the Film Noir Cry of the City (Robert Siodmak, 1948). Fresh out of high school in 1949, she acted in three other films before being signed by 20th Century-Fox. Her first vehicle for Fox was the successful Western Broken Arrow (Delmer Daves, 1950) with James Stewart. Paget played an Native American maiden, Sonseeahray (Morningstar), who gives up her life to save Stewart's character.\n\nPaget co-starred with Louis Jourdan in Bird of Paradise (Delmer Daves, 1951), a remake of the 1932 film starring Joel McCrea and Dolores del Rio. It was followed by roles in successful films like the Film Noir Fourteen Hours (Henry Hathaway, 1951), the adventure film Anne of the Indies (Jacques Tourneur, 1951) with Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan, and Prince Valiant (Henry Hathaway, 1954) starring Robert Wagner. Hal Erickson: “Most of her subsequent roles were merely decorative, though she was a more than adequate Cosette in the 1952 version of Les Miserables.”\n\nVintage postcard, no. 552. Photo: 20th Century Fox. Publicity still for Bird of Paradise (Delmer Daves, 1951) with Louis Jourdan.\n\nThe most beautiful girl in the world\n\nAfter the campy costume drama Princess of the Nile (Harmon Jones, 1954) was released, the fan mail Debra Paget received at 20th Century-Fox was topped only by that for Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable.\n\nThe Hollywood studio system dominated American feature film production in the first half of the 20th century. Under it, an actor would sign an exclusive contract to make films for a major studio, such as Fox. The system worked well at first for Paget as her early Fox films did well, so the studio bolstered her film career. In 1955, she broke the exclusivity clause of her contract.\n\nFor Fox, she played another Native American girl, Princess Appearing Day, in the Western White Feather (Robert D. Webb, 1955) along with Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter and later at MGM replaced Anne Bancroft as an Indian girl in another Western The Last Hunt (Richard Brooks, 1956), starring Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger.\n\nThen Fox lent her to Paramount for the part of Lilia, the water girl, in Cecil B. DeMille's biblical epic The Ten Commandments (1956), She had to wear brown contact lenses to hide her blue eyes. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive film made. The Ten Commandments (1956) became her most successful film, grossing approximately $122.7 million at the box office during its initial release. It was the most successful film of 1956 and the second-highest grossing film of the decade. In 1957, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\n\nPaget followed it up with Love Me Tender (Robert D. Webb, 1956), the film debut of Elvis Presley. According to Elizabeth Ann at IMDb, Elvis called Debra ‘the most beautiful girl in the world’ but her mother would not allow them to date. The River's Edge (Allan Dwan, 1957) with Anthony Quinn and Ray Milland was the last film she made for Fox. After that, her career began to decline.\n\nBritish postcard in the Celebrity Autograph Series, no. 105. Photo: 20th Century Fox. Publicity still for Prince Valiant (Henry Hathaway, 1954).\n\nHer blood pressure-raising belly dance\n\nDebra Paget was typically cast in exotic roles such as South Sea Island maidens or middle-east harem girls. In 1958, she travelled to Germany and India to star opposite Paul Hubschmid and Walter Reyer in Fritz Lang's sumptuous international production Der Tiger von Eschnapur/The Tiger of Eschnapur (1959) and its sequel Das Indische Grabmal/The Indian Tomb (1959). She gained extensive publicity coverage for her blood pressure-raising belly dance in the film.\n\nIn 1960 American International Pictures obtained the rights to both films for the USA and combined them into one film called Journey to the Lost City. Tom Wiener at AllMovie: “Contemporary audiences might find Hubschmid and Paget's acting stiff, but psychological nuance is not what Lang was looking for here, and the two do generate genuine sexual chemistry, especially in their flight across the desert which ends this installment.”\n\nIn Italy, Paget then appeared in the historical drama Il sepolcro dei re/Cleopatra's Daughter (Fernando Cerchio, 1960) set in Egypt during the reign of the pharaoh Khufu (r. 2589-2566 BC). Wikipedia: “For some reason, the English version was translated very differently from the original Italian script, setting the film in the 1st century BC, rather than the early Bronze Age.”\n\nIn the USA, Paget appeared on TV in episodes of the Western series, Riverboat (1959) starring Darren McGavin, Rawhide (1960 and 1962) with Clint Eastwood, and Johnny Ringo (1960). In Italy, she starred in another historical film I Masnadieri/Rome, 1585 (Mario Bonnard, 1961) with Antonio Cifariello.\n\nHer final feature film was the horror film The Haunted Palace (Roger Corman, 1963) with Vincent Price and Lon Chaney Jr. Her last television performance was in an episode of Burke's Law (1965), starring Gene Barry. She retired and later became a born-again Christian. She hosted her own show, An Interlude with Debra Paget on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), a Christian network, in the early 1990s.\n\nPaget was married three times. First she wed actor and singer David Street in 1958. Their marriage was annulled after four months. In 1960, she married prominent director Budd Boetticher in a Mexican café in Tijuana. He was 44; she was 27. She had acted for him in Seven Men From Now (1955). They separated after just 22 days, and their divorce became official in 1961. In 1962, she married Ling Chiech (Louis) Kung, a Chinese-American oil industry executive and nephew of Madame Chiang Kai-Shek. This third marriage produced a son, Gregory, but ended in divorce in 1980. Gregory would graduate from Texas A&M University and become a lawyer. Today Debra G.

He is also known for his role in two classic silent films by Jean Epstein, Coeur fidèle/The Faithful Heart (1923) and L’Auberge Rouge/The Red Inn (1923). In 1927 he turned director and directed over 20 films in all genres until 1953.\n\nFrench postcard by Cinémagazine-Edition, Paris, no. 389.\n\nFrench postcard by Cinémagazine-Edition, no. 15.

Publicity still for L'empereur des pauvres/The Emperor of the poor (René Leprince, 1921).\n\nAn Overnight Star\n\nLéon Désiré Joseph Mathot was born in Roubaix, France in 1886. After passing his youth in Liège, Belgium, and following the Conservatory there, he started to play on stage in Lyon, and later in Brussels and Paris.\n\nThanks to his friend Lucien Nonguet who shot short comedies at Pathé, Mathot started in cinema in 1906 as an extra. His first appearance was in the short and silent André Deedcomedy La course à la perruque/The Wig Chase (Georges Hatot, André Heuzé, 1906).\n\nBetween 1911 and 1914 he played in dozens of the Gontran comedies, often directed by Lucien Nonguet. He also played in dramatic films by directors Henri Andréani and Alfred Machin, mainly for the Belge-Cinéma. During the First World War Mathot switched to the Film d’Art company, where he worked with the young director Abel Gance, such as in Les gaz mortels/Mortal gases (Abel Gance, 1916).\n\nHis collaboration with Henri Pouctal started with the film Volonté/Will (Henri Pouctal, 1917) and culminated in the serial Le comte de Monte Christo/The Count of Monte Christo (Henri Pouctal, 1917-1918), which made Mathot an overnight star. Mathot played Edmond Dantès, the leading character in Alexandre Dumas’ classic novel. Dantès takes revenge on the people who ruined and imprisoned him, after he has come into possession of a huge treasure and a new identity.\n\nThis success was followed by other films by Pouctal like Travail/Work (Henri Pouctal, 1919), a film in seven chapters taking place at a steel factory, in which Mathot again had the male lead, opposite Huguette Duflos.\n\nMathot’s reputation only grew during the 1920s while playing in popular French silent films like L'ami Fritz/The Friend Fritz (René Hervil, 1920) again with Duflos, the serial L'empereur des pauvres/The emperor of the poor (René Leprince, 1922) with Gina Relly, the classic drama Cœur fidèle/The Faithful Heart (Jean Epstein, 1923) with Gina Manès , the Honoré de Balzac adaptation L’Auberge Rouge/The Red Inn (Jean Epstein, 1923) again with Manès, Mon oncle Benjamin/My Uncle Benjamin (René Leprince, 1923), Le puits de Jacob/A Daughter of Israel (Edward José, 1926) with American star Betty Blythe, Le mystère de la Villa Rose/Mystery of the Pink Villa (René Hervil, Louis Mercanton, 1930), and La maison de la flèche/The house of the arrow (Henri Fescourt, 1930) with Annabella.\n\nFrench postcard by M.

Gina Relly and Léon Mathot in the French silent film L'empereur des pauvres (René Leprince, 1921), an adaptation of the novel by Felicien Champsaur.\n\nFilm Direction\n\nWhen he sensed that his star was descending, Léon Mathot started to combine acting with directing, first with Carmine GalloneCelle qui domine/The one who dominates (Carmine Gallone, Léon Mathot, 1927) and afterwards with André LiabelDans l’ombre du harem/In the Shadow of the Harem (André Liabel, Léon Mathot, 1928), L’appassionata (André Liabel, Léon Mathot, 1929) with Fernand Fabre and L’instinct/Instinct (André Liabel, Léon Mathot, 1930) with Madeleine Carroll.\n\nWhen sound cinema became the norm in French cinema, Mathot exclusively focused on film direction. He performed only twice again: in Passeport 13.444/Passport 13444 (1931) which he directed himself, and in Deuxième Bureau contre Kommandantur/Military Intelligence Service against kommandantur (René Jayet, Robert Bibal, 1939), his last role as actor.\n\nIn the 1930s he first directed various vehicles for the comic singer Georges Milton such as La bande à Bouboule/Bouboule's Gang (Léon Mathot, 1931) about a carefree Parisian taxi driver, Bouboule 1er roi des nègres/Bouboule the first, king of the negroes (Léon Mathot, 1933), and Le comte Obligado/Count Obligado (Léon Mathot, 1935).\n\nHe also directed La Mascotte/The Mascot (Léon Mathot, 1935), an operetta adaptation for the comedian Armand Dranem. He then focused on spy films, and filmed two of the four adventures of Capitaine Benoît based on the novels by Charles-Robert Dumas: Les loups entre eux/Wolves between them (Léon Mathot, 1936) and L’homme à abattre/A Man To Kill (Léon Mathot, 1937).\n\nMathot then switched again, adapting Gaston Leroux’ Chéri-Bibi (Léon Mathot, 1938), starring Pierre Fresnay. According to Ciné-Ressources, it is one of Mathot’s best films. A year later Mathot also adapted Maurice Larroy’s novel Le révolté/The Rebel (Léon Mathot, 1938), which was scripted by the young Henri-Georges Clouzot.\n\nFormer child star René Dary played one of his first serious roles in this film, and four years later, Mathot would direct Dary again in Forte tête/Strong head (Léon Mathot, 1942). After a short return to comedy with Le bois sacré/Sacred Woods (Léon Mathot, 1939) starring Elvire Popesco, Mathot filmed Rappel immédiat/Immediate Call (Léon Mathot, 1939) with Erich von Stroheim and Mireille Balin, a striking spy film.\n\nHe also tried his luck with exotic melodrama in Aloha, le chant des ïles/Aloha (Léon Mathot, 1937) starring Arletty, and showed interest in nomads with Cartacalha, reine des gitans/Cartacalha, Queen of the Gypsies (Léon Mathot, 1941) which confirmed the career of Viviane Romance. That same year, the critics appreciated Mathot’s adaptation of Alphonse Daudet’s Fromont jeune et Risler aîné/Fromont junior and Risler senior (Léon Mathot, 1941) with Mireille Balin.\n\nFrench postcard by Europe, no. 189.

He was also chairman of the l’Union Européenne des Techniciens du Film et de la Télévision. Léon Mathot died in 1968 in Paris, at the age of 82.\n\nFrench postcard by A.N., Paris, no. 252.

Their films include Heddas Rache/Hedda's Revenge (1919) with Reinhold Schünzel, Lilli (1919) and the sequel Lilli’s Ehe/Lilli's Marriage (1919).\n\nIn the early 1920s followed the two-parter Zügelloses Blut/Unbridled blood (Jaap Speyer, 1920) with Bernhard Goetzke, Entblätterte Blüten/Stripped Blossoms (Jaap Speyer, 1920), Die rote Nacht/The Red Night (Jaap Speyer, 1921) with Oscar Marion, Das blonde Verhängnis/The Blonde Fate (Jaap Speyer, 1921) opposite Ernst Hofmann, Jimmy, ein Schicksal von Mensch und Tier/Jimmy, a destiny of Man and Animal (Jaap Speyer, 1922), and Der allmächtige Dollar/The Almighty Dollar (Jaap Speyer, 1923).\n\nIncidentally she played in films by other directors such as Wolfgang Neff (Der Heiratsschwindler/The marriage swindler, 1922), Leo König (Die Hermannschlacht/The Battle of Hermann, 1924), and Friedrich Zelnik (Briefen die ihn nicht erreichten/Letters He Never Received, 1925).\n\nShe continued to work with her husband on the films Elegantes Pack/Elegant stack (Jaap Speyer, 1925), Die Moral der Gasse/The Morals of the Alley (Jaap Speyer, 1925) starring Werner Krauss, Hotelratten/Hotel Rats (Jaap Speyer, 1927) with Nils Asther, and Die drei Frauen der Urban Hell/The Three Wives of Urban Hell (Jaap Speyer, 1928).\n\nGerman postcard by Ross Verlag, no. 1031/1, 1927-1928.

Photo: Atelier Balázs, Berlin.\n\nWhite Slave Trade\n\nIn the late 1920s, Mia Pankau appeared in supporting parts in such popular productions as Durchlaucht Radieschen/Highness radish (Richard Eichberg, 1927) starring Xenia Desni, and the Anny Ondra vehicle Der erste Kuss/The First Kiss (Carl Lamac, 1929).\n\nProbably her best known is the fantasy/horror film Alraune/A Daughter of Destiny (Henrik Galeen, 1928) featuring Brigitte Helm. Pankau plays a prostitute who is artificially inseminated by a sociopathic scientist (Paul Wegener) with the semen of an executed murderer. The result, the angelic Alraune (Brigitte Helm) is incapable of feeling any real emotions and kills all the men who fall in love with her.\n\nPankau easily switched from comedy to drama, from war film to horror film, but she had more difficulty to switch to the sound cinema. She appeared in a short sound film, Besuch um Mitternacht. Nachtgespenst in Berlin/Visit at midnight. The ghost of Berlin (Jaap Speyer, 1930) – a film she had co-produced herself.\n\nAfter that she performed only in one sound feature: Tänzerinnen für Süd-Amerika gesucht/Girls For Sale (1931), again directed by Speyer. She was clearly not the big star anymore, as the female lead had gone to Dita Parlo. Pankau played a matchmaker involved in white slave trade, Parlo a young victim.\n\nAfter that Mia Pankau retired from the screen. She died in Hoisdorf near Hamburg, Germany in 1974, at the age of 83.\n\nGerman postcard by Verlag Hermann Leiser, Berlin-Wilm., no. 4355. Photo: Max Lutze.\n\nAlraune (1928).

She starred with Julien Schoenaerts in the 'first Belgian film'Meeuwen sterven in de haven/Seagulls Die in the Harbour (1955) and with Kees Brusse in the Dutch classic Dokter Pulder zaait papavers/Doctor Pulder Sows Poppies (1975). She appeared in more than 120 films and television shows between 1945 and 2003.\n\nBelgian postcard by Ed. Privot, Antwerp. Photo: Metropool Film. Publicity still for Meeuwen sterven in de haven/Seagulls Die in the Harbour (Rik Kuypers, Ivo Michiels and Roland Verhavert, 1955) with Dora van der Groen as the Prostitute.\n\nThe first Belgian film\n\nDora van der Groen was born on March 10, 1927 in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nShe began her acting career at the Koninlijke Nederlandse Schouwburg (Royal Dutch Theatre) in Antwerp. Later, she played at the Koninklijke Vlaamse Schouwburg (Royal Flemish Theatre) in Brussels. For many years, she was also artistic director of the theatre department of the Royal Flemish Conservatory in Antwerp.\n\nShe made her film debut in the Belgian comedy Baas Gansendonck/Boss Gansendonck (Gaston Ariën, 1945), based on a novel by Hendrik Conscience.\n\nIn 1955, she played the female lead as a prostitute opposite Julien Schoenaerts in the Belgian drama film Meeuwen sterven in de haven/Seagulls Die in the Harbour (Rik Kuypers, Ivo Michiels and Roland Verhavert, 1955), which was entered into the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. The film made a great impression on the press and public. Both the theme and the stylistic program introduced a new, more internationally oriented sensibility in the cinema for Flanders. In many reviews Meeuwen was unreservedly hailed as ‘the first Flemish' or even the ‘first Belgian film'.\n\nVan der Groen became a much sought-after television actor, and played in series such as Wij, Heren van Zichem/We, Gentlemen of Zichem (Maurits Balfoort, 1969), Tussen wal en schip/Between two stools (Eimert Kruidhof, 1977), De Bossen van Vlaanderen/The woods of Flanders Marc Lybaert, 1991), Moeder, waarom leven wij/Mother, why do we live (Guido Henderickx, 1993), and Terug naar Oosterdonk/Back to Oosterdonk (Frank Van Passel, 1997).\n\nWij, heren van Zichem/We, Gentlemen from Zichem (Maurits Balfoort, 1969) was a very authentic Flemisch TV series. A soap avant-la-lettre about a devout Catholic village, with numerous story-lines on human themes such as affection, jealousy, greed, family - and social life. The series elaborates on the adventures of the blond rascal Lewie, the title character of Ernest Claes' hit-novel De Witte/The White One. Lewie's eternal mischief makes life difficult for his family, friends, people at school and the other inhabitants of the village.\n\nBelgian postcard by Best, Antwerpen, no 30. Photo: Humo.

In 1969, she appeared in the Belgian-Dutch drama Monsieur Hawarden (Harry Kümel, 1969) with Ellen Vogel as a woman who disguises herself as a man to avoid prosecution for murdering her lover fifteen years ago. Van der Groen also appeared in Kümel’s fantasy-horror Malpertuis/The Legend of Doom House (Harry Kümel, 1971) with Orson Welles.\n\nShe had a small part in the French film La Maison sous les arbres/The Deadly Trap (René Clément, 1971) starring Faye Dunaway. She co-starred with Kees Brusse in the drama-comedy Dokter Pulder zaait papavers/Doctor Pulder Sows Poppies (Bert Haanstra, 1975), which was entered into the 26th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nOther successful films were Dagboek van een Oude Dwaas/Diary of a Mad Old Man (Lili Rademakers, 1987) based on a book by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, the Dutch drama Havinck (Frans Weisz, 1987) with Willem Nijholt, and the feminist fairy-tale Antonia/Antonia's Line (Marleen Gorris, 1995) featuring Willeke van Ammelrooy. Antonia won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards.\n\nIn the film Pauline & Paulette (Lieven Debrauwer, 2001), Van der Groen played the mentally handicapped Pauline opposite Ann Petersen as her sister Paulette. Van der Groen herself stayed for several years in a housing project for people with dementia. Earlier, she had performed a demented woman in the short film Leonie (1996), and in Villa des Roses (Frank Van Passel, 2002).\n\nDora van der Groen was married to the actor Tone Brulin and later to actor and TV host Wies Andersen. Both marriages ended in a divorce. She had three sons. Her youngest son is director Brick de Bois. Dora van der Groen was 88.\n\nTrailer Meeuwen sterven in de haven/Seagulls Die in the Harbour (1955). Source: Ximon NL (YouTube).\n\nAmerican trailer for Pauline & Paulette (Lieven Debrauwer, 2001).

He became a star in the late 1950s when he was one of the best known faces of the Nouvelle Vague. Brialy worked with such New Wave filmmakers as Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, Louis Malle, and François Truffaut, and he also directed a number of films himself. It made him an embodiment of the French cinema for a global audience.\n\nFrench postcard by E.D.U.G., no. 67. Photo: Sam Lévin.\n\nFrench postcard by E.D.U.G., no. 273, offered by Corvisart, Epinal.

(Editions du Globe), no. 327. Photo: Sam Lévin.\n\nActing as an early form of rebellion\n\nJean-Claude Brialy was born in Aumale, French Algeria (now Sour El-Ghozlane, Algeria), in 1933. He was the son of Roger Brialy, a colonel stationed in colonial Algeria with the French Army, and Suzanne Abraham. At the age of nine, he went with his family to various cities in France, settling after the war in Strasbourg, where he took his ´baccalaureate´.\n\nBrialy showed great promise in drama and won first prize at the Conservatoire de Strasbourg. He detested his strict upbringing, and acting became an early form of rebellion. He had violent arguments with his father, who once locked the 15-year-old boy in to prevent his attending rehearsals of a school play. Jean-Claude responded by smashing up the furniture. No doubt there was further trouble when Jean-Claude revealed that he was homosexual.\n\nAgainst the wishes of his parents, he enrolled at the Centre Dramatique de l’Est (Eastern Centre of Dramatic Art in Strasbourg), to train to be an actor. Military service then intervened and Brialy found himself attached to an army film unit in the German town of Baden-Baden. There he made his first film, a short entitled Chiffonard et Bon Aloi/Chiffonard and Good Taste (Phierre Lhomme, 1954). His job also enabled him to go to shows, and to meet actors, including Jean Marais.\n\nDemobilized, he moved to Paris in 1954. There he scratched a living by small roles on stage and entertaining the queues outside the first-run cinemas on the Champs Elysees. He became friendly with a group of young critics and aspiring filmmakers who were taking over the influential journal Cahiers du Cinéma. At 21, he joined a Cahiers outing to Arles to see Jean Renoir's stage production of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.\n\nHe made his film debut in a short directed by one of the Cahiers critics, Le Coup du berger/Fool's Mate (Jacques Rivette, 1956). Cahiers editor Eric Rohmer cast him as the lover in his 10-minute short La sonate à Kreutzer/The Kreutzer Sonata (1956), an adaptation of the short story by Leo Tolstoy. Brialy appeared uncredited in two features by Louis Malle: Les Amants/The Lovers (Louis Malle, 1958) and Ascenseur pour l’échafaud/Elevator to the Gallows (Louis Malle, 1958), two instant classics starring Jeanne Moreau.\n\nHis first lead was in Le beau Serge/Handsome Serge (Claude Chabrol, 1958) as an idealistic Parisian student who returns after a ten-year absence to his provincial village and becomes obsessed with saving an old school friend who has become a hopeless alcoholic (played by the brooding Gérard Blain, often called the James Dean of France). The film, which won an award in Locarno, and the Jean-Vigo Prize, immediately attracted attention, and the performers (Brialy, Blain, and Bernadette Lafont) were widely acclaimed. Le beau Serge was followed by another film by Claude Chabrol, Les Cousins/The Cousins (1959), in which Brialy played the sardonic town cousin to Blain's simple country cousin.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions du Globe, Paris, no. 775.

Photo: Cinepress / Pallas Film.\n\nA Period of Frantic Renaissance\n\nThe young Turks of the Cahiers du Cinema formed the core of the Nouvelle Vague (New Wave). This film movement was a rebellion against the conventions of the French cinema. As James Travers comments at Films de France: ”Out went polished scripts, well-rehearsed performances and meticulously staged productions. In came spontaneity, improvisation, subversive politics, real human emotion, and fun.”\n\nThe Cahiers critics were starting to have an impact far greater than they could have anticipated and the French cinema seemed to be going through a period of frantic renaissance. The director became the intellectual author of the film; the stars were made more human, the stories more enigmatic. Jean-Claude Brialy made several films with Nouvelle Vague filmmakers including Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Agnès Varda, Pierre Kast, and Jacques Rozier.\n\nRonald Bergan stated in The Guardian: “Where (Jean-Paul) Belmondo represented anarchy, (Jean-Pierre) Léaud youthful innocence and Blain sensitivity, Brialy brought cynicism, charm and sophistication to the films of the period.”\n\nBrialy was the leading man in Godard’s ‘neo-realist musical’ Une Femme est une femme/Woman Is a Woman (Jean-Luc Godard, 1961), in which Anna Karina plays a stripper who wants to have his baby and turns to his best friend Jean-Paul Belmondo when he refuses. In the film Brialy directly addresses the audience with a line that became an epigram for the Nouvelle Vague: “It’s hard to tell if this is a comedy or a tragedy, but either way it’s a masterpiece.”\n\nFor Truffaut he appeared opposite Jeanne Moreau in La Mariée était en noir/The Bride Wore Black (François Truffaut, 1968), and for Rohmer he starred in Le Genou de Claire/Claire’s Knee (Éric Rohmer, 1970), in which he played a bearded cultural attache who is taking his last summer holiday as a bachelor at Annecy and becomes filled with desire for a young woman’s knee.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions P.I., offered by Delespaul, Lille, no.

He made his feature film debut in Jean Renoir’s Elena et les hommes/Elena and her Men (1956) and played his first substantial role, in L’Ami de la famille/A Friend of the Family (Jacques Pinoteau, 1957). Then came a supporting role in Christine (Pierre Gaspard-Huit, 1958), starring Romy Schneider, who would become a close personal friend.\n\nBrialy appeared with Alida Valli in Le Gigolo/The Gigolo (Jacques Deray, 1960), with Anthony Perkins in Le Glaive et la Balance/The Sword and the Balance (André Cayatte, 1963) and with Jane Fonda in La ronde/Circle of Love (1964), Roger Vadim's adaptation of the classic Arthur Schnitzler play about various people having affairs. He was an asylum inmate in Le Roi de Coeur/King of Hearts (Philippe de Broca, 1966), which became a US hit.\n\nIn the following decades he worked with major film directors like Luis Buñuel (Le Fantôme de la liberté/The Phantom of Liberty, 1974), Bertrand Tavernier (Le Juge et l’assassin/The Judge and the Assassin, 1976) and Ettore Scola (La Nuit de Varennes/That Night in Varennes, 1982). He was equally attracted to popular comedies, such as Le Maître-nageur/The Swimming Instructor (Jean-Louis Trintignant, 1978) and Pinot simple flic/Pinot, Simple Cop (Gérard Jugnot, 1984).\n\nHe reunited with Claude Chabrol and Bernadette Lafont for Inspecteur Lavardin/Inspector Lavardin (Claude Chabrol, 1986) in which he played a gay uncle. Other notable appearances include Les uns et les autres/Bolero (Claude Lelouch, 1981), Mortelle Randonnée/Deadly Circuit (Claude Miller, 1982), and La Reine Margot/Queen Margot (Patrice Chéreau, 1994) starring Isabelle Adjani.\n\nBrialy also directed a dozen (TV) films himself, including Églantine (1971), an enchanting story set in the 19th century of a boy's visit to his grandmother, and Un Amour De Pluie/Loving in the Rain (1974) starring Romy Schneider as a woman who takes her daughter to a summer resort in search of a love affair. He often appeared in supporting roles, and was nominated for a César for the best supporting actor for his role in Le Juge et l’Assassin/The Judge and the Assassin (Bertrand Tavernier, 1976), but he won the César for Les Innocents/The Innocents (André Téchiné, 1988).\n\nFrench postcard by E.D.U.G., no. 43.

A bon vivant, he started his own restaurant in 1966: the popular L'Orangerie, on the Île Saint-Louis in Paris, which he owned for two decades. He was a natural conteur, and he revelled in his numerous television and radio appearances.\n\nAs a lover of literature, he read extensively and wrote several best-selling books, including the memoirs, Le Ruisseau des singes (River of Monkeys) (2000) and J'ai oublié de vous dire... (I Forgot to Tell You ...) (2004). And he was also a man of the stage. His theatrical successes include Georges Feydeau’s La Puce à l’oreille (A Flea in Her Ear, 1968) and Hotel Paradiso (1974), and Sacha Guitry’s Desiré (1984).\n\nWhen he wasn’t treading the boards, he was helping to direct theatres and film festivals. As James Travers writes at Films de France: “It’s no wonder that he became one of the best loved and most highly respected figures in France.” For his exceptional contribution to French culture, he was awarded the Légion d’honneur (the Legion of Honour).\n\nIn his last film, made for television, Brialy gave his best performance in years, as the gay Jewish poet Max Jacob in Monsieur Max (Gabriel Aghion, 2007), who converted to Catholicism and died in a Gestapo internment camp.\n\nFollowing a long illness, Jean-Claude Brialy died of cancer in 2007, in his house in Monthyon, France. He was 74. In over more than a half-century, Brialy appeared in 185 films and television shows. He is cited in The Guardian saying: \"Out of the 185 films, I must admit that I've enjoyed myself 185 times\".\n\nTrailer Le beau Serge/Handsome Serge (1958).

Haas, 1958), The Restless Years (Helmut Käutner 1958), and The Reluctant Debutante (Vincente Minnelli, 1958), Saxon was briefly the object of many a teenage crush.\n\nAlthough he worked in these years with many notable directors including Blake Edwards, John Huston, Frank Borzage, and Otto Preminger, he never developed into a major star.\n\nAustrian postcard by Bild und Ton, Wien, no. 503.\n\nDutch postcard by Int.

Castellari, 1968) and such police thrillers as Napoli violenta/Violent Naples (Umberto Lenzi, 1976).\n\nHe also co-starred with Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly in the classic Hong Kong martial arts action film Enter the Dragon (Robert Clouse, 1973). Another classic genre film is Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) in which he played the heroine's (Nancy Thompson's) father.\n\nHal Erickson at AllMovie: \"Fans could watch Saxon's expertise as an actor increase (and his hairline recede) during his three-year (1969-1972) stint as Dr. Ted Stuart on the NBC television series The Bold Ones. He later appeared as a semiregular on the prime-time TV soaper Dallas. In 1988, John Saxon made his directorial debut with the low-budget feature Death House.\"\n\nHopefully, Saxon can be seen soon as a Bounty Hunter in a new Western by Enzo G.

She later starred in several silent films. Her warmth, gentleness, and beauty made her one of the most popular actresses in Britain and the U.S., and she continued to act until 1925. Among the members of her famous family is her great nephew, John Gielgud.\n\nBritish postcard by Rotary Photo, no. 151 I.\n\nBritish postcard by The Rapid Photo printing Co. Ltd., London, no. 1658.\n\nBritish postcard by Rotary Photo, no. 2917 A. Photo right: Window & Grove.\n\nA Family of Actors\n\nAlice Ellen Terry was born in Coventry, England in 1847 into a family of actors. Her parents, Benjamin Terry of Irish descent, and Sarah Terry (née Ballard), of Scottish ancestry, were comic actors in a touring company based in Portsmouth, and had eleven children. At least five of them became actors: Kate, Ellen, Marion, Florence and Fred. Two other children, George and Charles, were connected with theater management. Kate's grandson, Sir John Gielgud, became one of the 20th century's most respected actors.\n\nEllen Terry's first appearance on stage came at the age of eight, when she appeared as Mamillius the child under the direction of Charles Kean in William Shakespeare’s A Winter's Tale at the Princess Theater in London on 28 April 1856, with Queen Victoria in attendance. She continued to appear on stage as a teen, in London and on tour.\n\nAt sixteen she married the famous painter George Frederick Watts, thirty years her senior, and she retired from the stage. Watts's famous portraits of Terry, including Choosing and Ophelia, were more successful than their domestic affairs, however, and they separated within a year. She briefly returned to acting and in 1867, she first played opposite Henry Irving in the title roles of Katherine and Petruchio, David Garrick's one-act version of The Taming of the Shrew.\n\nThen she began a relationship with the progressive architect-designer and essayist Edward William Godwin. With him she retreated to a house in Hertfordshire, retiring for six years from acting. They could not marry, as Terry was still married to Watts and did not finalize a divorce until 1877 – then a scandalous situation. With Godwin she had a daughter, Edith Ailsa Geraldine Craig, in 1869 and a son, Edward Gordon Craig, in 1872. She returned to acting in 1874, separating from Godwin in 1875.\n\nIn 1875, Terry gave an acclaimed performance as Portia in The Merchant of Venice at the Prince of Wales's Theatre. Oscar Wilde wrote a sonnet, upon seeing her in this role: \"No woman Veronese looked upon / Was half so fair as thou whom I behold.\" She recreated this role many times in her career until her last appearance as Portia at London's Old Vic Theatre in 1917. Terry married again, in November 1877, to actor/journalist Charles Clavering Wardell Kelly, but they separated in 1881.\n\nGeorge Frederick Watts, Choosing, 1864.

Photo: publicity still for a stage production of Henry VIII (1892-).\n\nA Star-studded Gala Performance\n\nIn 1878, the 30 years-old Ellen Terry joined Henry Irving's company at the Lyceum Theatre as its leading lady, at a generous salary, beginning with Ophelia opposite Irving's Hamlet. Her association with Irving was to become the most successful of her career, and over the next two decades she played many of the great Shakespearean heroines, including Ophelia, Lady Macbeth, Viola, Queen Katherine, Juliet, and Cordelia.\n\nTwo of her most famous roles were Portia in The Merchant of Venice, which ran for an unusual 250 nights in 1879, and perhaps most notably Beatrice in Much Ado about Nothing, a role she first performed at the Lyceum in 1882 and later revived in 1884, 1891, and 1893. She and Irving also toured with great success in America and Britain. They reigned together the British theatre in the Shakespeare canon and in Alfred Tennyson, Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Reade, Victorien Sardou, and plays by other contemporary playwrights until they left the Lyceum in 1902.\n\nIn 1903, she formed a new theatrical company, taking over management of the Imperial Theatre with her son. Here she had complete artistic control and could choose the works in which she would appear. She focused on the plays of George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen. In the 1890s, Terry had struck up a friendship, and conducted a famous correspondence, with Shaw. Theatre management turned out to be a financial failure for Terry, who had hoped the venture would showcase the set design and directing talents of her son and the costume designs of her daughter. She then toured and later also lectured.\n\nOn 12 June 1906, after 50 years on the stage, a star-studded gala performance was held at the Drury Lane Theatre for Terry's benefit and to celebrate her golden jubilee, at which Enrico Caruso sang, Eleanora Duse, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Lillie Langtry, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Nellie Melba, and more than twenty members of Terry's family performed in an act of Much Ado about Nothing with her, among other performances. The benefit raised £6000 for Terry.\n\nIn 1907 she toured America in Shaw’s Captain Brassbound's Conversion under the direction of Charles Frohman. During that tour, she married her co-star, American actor James Carew, who had appeared with her at the Court Theatre. She was thirty years older than Carew. Terry's acting career continued strongly, but her marriage broke up after only two years.\n\nBritish postcard by J. Beagles & Co., London, no. 185. Sent by mail in 1905. Photo: Window & Grove.

Publicity photo for the stage play Captain Brassbound's Conversion (1906) by George Bernard Shaw.\n\nHer Greatest Performance\n\nIn 1911, Ellen Terry recorded scenes from five Shakespeare roles for the Victor Talking Machine Company, the only known recordings of her voice. During World War I she performed in many war benefits. In 1916, she appeared in her first film as Julia Lovelace in Her Greatest Performance (Fred Paul, 1917) and continued to act in London and on tour.\n\nShe made a few more films through 1922, including The Invasion of Britain (Herbert Brenon, 1918), Victory and Peace (Herbert Brenon, 1918) with Matheson Lang, Pillars of Society (Rex Wilson, 1920), Potter's Clay (H. Grenville-Taylor, Douglas Payne, 1922), and The Bohemian Girl (Harley Knoles, 1922) as Buda the nursemaid, with Ivor Novelloand Gladys Cooper.\n\nShe continued to lecture on Shakespeare throughout England and North America. She also gave scenes from Shakespeare plays in music halls under the management of Oswald Stoll. Her last fully staged role was as the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet at the Lyric Theatre in 1919. In 1920 she retired from the stage and in 1922 from film, although she returned to play Susan Wildersham in Walter de la Mare's fairy play Crossings, in November 1925 at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith.\n\nIn 1922, St. Andrews University conferred an honorary LLD upon Terry, and in 1925 she was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, only the second actress to be so honoured. In her last years, she gradually lost her eyesight and suffered from senility. Stephen Coleridge anonymously published Terry's second autobiography, The Heart of Ellen Terry in 1928.\n\nEllen Terry died of a cerebral haemorrhage at her home at Smallhythe Place in Kent, England, at age 81. Her career had lasted nearly seven decades. After her death, her correspondence with G. B. Shaw was published.\n\nBritish postcard in the Rotary Photographic Series, no. 151D.\n\nBritish postcard by J. Beagles & Co., London, no. 537 C. Sent by mail in 1906.

The combination of her beauty, dark, flashing eyes, explosive sexuality and genuine acting talent virtually guaranteed her stardom. Her most notable films include the classics 8½ (Federico Fellini, 1963), Il Gattopardo (Luchino Visconti, 1963), and Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone, 1968).

Her mother, Yolande Greco, was born in Tunisia to Italian (Sicilian) emigrants from Trapani, Italy. Her father was an Italian (Sicilian) railway worker, born in Gela, Italy.\n\nHer native languages were Tunisian Arabic and French. She received a French education and she had to learn Italian once she pursued her acting career.\n\nShe had her break in films after she was voted the most beautiful Italian girl in Tunisia in 1957. The contest of the Italian embassy had as a prize a trip to the Venice Film Festival. She made her film debut in the French-Tunisian coproduction Goha (Jacques Baratier, 1958) starring Omar Sharif.\n\nAfter attending the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome for two months, she signed a 7-year contract with the Vides studios. The contract forbade her to cut her hair, to marry or to gain weight.\n\nLater that year she had a role in the heist comedy I soliti ignoti/Big Deal On Madonna Street (Mario Monicelli, 1958) with Vittorio Gassman and Renato Salvatori. The film was an international success, and her film career was off and running.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions P.I., no. FK 104. Photo: Herbert Fried / Ufa.\n\nGerman postcard by Kolibri (W.

According to IMDb, she has appeared on more than 900 magazine covers in over 25 countries.\n\nThe contrast between these pictures and those of Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield is striking. Cardinale never appeared in a nude or fully topless scene. Her pictures promoted an image of a shy family girl who just happened to have a beautiful face and a sexy body.\n\nA photograph of Cardinale was featured in the original gate fold artwork to Bob Dylan's album Blonde on Blonde (1966), but because it was used without Cardinale's permission, the photo was removed from the cover art in later pressings.\n\nEast-German postcard by VEB Progress Filmvertrieb, no. 1187, 1960.

Because of her film contract, she told everyone that her son Patrizio (who was born out of wedlock when she was 17; the father was a mysterious Frenchman) was her baby brother. She did not reveal to the child that he was her son until he was 19 years old. In 1966, she married Cristaldi, who adopted Patrizio.\n\nIn only three years she made a stream of great films. First she made three successful comedies, Un Maledetto imbroglio/The Facts of Murder (Pietro Germi, 1959), Il Bell'Antonio/Bell'Antonio (Mauro Bolognini, 1960) featuring Marcello Mastroianni, and Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti/Fiasco in Milan (Nanni Loy, 1960).\n\nThen followed a supporting part in the epic drama Rocco e i suoi fratelli/Rocco and His Brothers (Luchino Visconti, 1960) in which she played the sister-in-law of Alain Delon and Renato Salvatori.\n\nAnd then followed leading parts in La Ragazza con la valigia/Girl with a Suitcase (Valerio Zurlini, 1961), La Viaccia/The Lovemakers (Mauro Bolognini, 1961) with Jean-Paul Belmondo, and Senilità/Careless (Mauro Bolognini, 1961).\n\nGerman postcard by Krüger.\n\nFrench postcard.\n\nGerman postcard by ISV, Sort. 10/6.\n\nDutch postcard, Serie 6.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions P.I., Paris, no. 1084, offered by Corvisart, Epinal.

In the film, she plays a dream woman - a character named Claudia, who is the object of the fantasies of the director in the film, played by Marcello Mastroianni. With Fellini's surrealistic masterpiece she received her widest exposure to date with this film.\n\nThat same year, she also appeared in another masterpiece of the Italian cinema, the epic Il Gattopardo/The Leopard (Luchino Visconti, 1963) with Burt Lancasterand Alain Delon.\n\nThe combined success of these two classic films made her rise to the front ranks of the Italian cinema, and it also piqued Hollywood's interest.\n\nTo be continued tomorrow.\n\nFrench postcard by Edition La Malibran, Paris, no.

It was the first in the series of detective comedies starring Peter Sellers as bumbling French Inspector Jacques Clouseau (the mishap-prone snoop was actually a supporting player in his debut).\n\nThe film was an enormous success and brought CC to English speaking audiences. In 1964 she co-starred with John Wayne and Rita Hayworth in her first American production, Circus World (Henry Hathaway, 1964). It was another box-office hit.\n\nThe following year she appeared with Rock Hudson in Blindfold (Philip Dunne, 1966), an offbeat mixture of espionage and slapstick comedy.\n\nThe Professionals (Richard Brooks, 1966) is her favourite among her Hollywood films. In this Western she is a gutsy Mexican woman married against her will to a rich American. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Direction (Richard Brooks), Best Screenplay (Brooks again), and Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall).\n\nCardinale continued dividing her time between Hollywood and Europe for the remainder of the decade.\n\nPostcard by Moviestar 1961, no. F 73.

The billing of BB vs CC in this Western didn't live up to expectations.\n\nThe Ultimate Spaghetti Western\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Claudia Cardinale also appeared in some of the best European films. In France she appeared in the Swashbuckler Cartouche (Philippe de Broca, 1962) featuring Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\nBack in Italy, she played in I Giorno della civetta/The Day of the Owl (Damiano Damiani, 1968) with Franco Nero, and Nell'anno del Signore/The Conspirators (Luigi Magni, 1969) with Nino Manfredi.\n\nMesmerizing is her performance in Sandra/Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa... (Luchino Visconti, 1965) as a Holocaust survivor with an incestuous relationship with her brother (Jean Sorel).\n\nAnother highlight in her career is C'era una volta il West/Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone, 1968), the ultimate Spaghetti Western. Lucia Bozzola writes in her review at AllMovie: \"In Sergio Leone's epic Western, shot partly in Monument Valley, a revenge story becomes an epic contemplation of the Western past. (...) As in his 'Dollars' trilogy, Leone transforms the standard Western plot through the visual impact of widescreen landscapes and the figures therein. At its full length, Once Upon a Time in the West is Leone's operatic masterwork, worthy of its legend-making title.\"\n\nGerman collectors card by Bergmann-Verlag, Unna, in the series Show-Top-Stars.\n\nGerman postcard by Krüger / Ufa.

She played a small part for Visconti in Gruppo di famiglia in un interno/Conversation Piece (Luchino Visconti, 1974) starring Burt Lancaster and Silvana Mangano.\n\nShe worked with other major Italian directors at Goodbye e amen (Damiano Damiani, 1977), the TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth (Franco Zeffirelli, 1977) as the adulteress, and La Pelle/The Skin (Liliana Cavani, 1981) starring Marcello Mastroianni and based on the bitter novel by Curzio Malaparte concerning the Allied liberation of Naples.\n\nAn international arthouse hit was Fitzcarraldo (Werner Herzog, 1982), the story of an obsessed impresario (Klaus Kinski) whose foremost desire in life is to bring both Enrico Caruso and an opera house to the deepest jungles of South America. In his diary of the making of Fitzcarraldo, Werner Herzog writes: \"Claudia Cardinale is great help because she is such a good sport, a real trouper, and has a special radiance before the camera. In her presence, [Klaus Kinski] usually acts like a gentleman.\"\n\nOther interesting films include the Luigi Pirandello adaptation Enrico IV/Henry IV (Marco Bellocchio, 1984) with Marcello Mastroianni, the epic La révolution française/The French Revolution (Robert Enrico, Richard T. Heffron, 1989), the nostalgic drama Mayrig/Mother (Henri Verneuil, 1991), and the romantic thriller And now... Ladies and Gentlemen (Claude Lelouch, 2002) starring Jeremy Irons.\n\nOn Television she gave another well-received performance in the TV drama La storia/History (Luigi Comencini, 1986), in which she plays a widow raising a son during World War II.\n\nFrench postcard by E.D.U.G., no. 229.

She is involved in many humanitarian causes, and pro-women and pro-gay issues, and she has frequently stated her pride in her Tunisian and Arab roots - as evidenced by her appearance as herself in the Tunisian film Un été à La Goulette/A Summer at La Goulette (Férid Boughedir, 1996).\n\nShe has managed to combine her acting work with a role of goodwill ambassador for UNICEF, and advocate for the work of Luchino Visconti with whom she made four films.\n\nShe wrote an autobiography, Moi Claudia, Toi Claudia (Me Claudia, You Claudia). In 2005, she also published a French-language book, Mes Etoiles (My Stars), about her personal and professional relationships with many of her directors and co-stars through her nearly 50 years in show-business.\n\nIn 2002, she won an honorary Golden Bear award of the Berlin Film Festival, and previously in 1993 she was awarded an honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nCardinale works steadily on and in recent years she has also worked in the theatre. In the cinema she appeared recently in the French-Tunisian gay drama Le fil/The String (Mehdi Ben Attia, 2009), the Algerian drama Un balcon sur la mer/A View of Love (Nicole Garcia, 2010) in which she played the mother of Jean Dujardin, and the costume drama Effie Gray (Richard Laxton, 2014) with Dakota Fanning.\n\nClaudia Cardinale currently lives in Paris. Now 76, she has made over 135 films in the past 60 years, and still does two or three a year.\n\nItalian postcard by Cineteca Bologna for the exhibition Un Altro West (2008). Photo: A. Novi.

She appeared in such classic French films as Henri-Georges Clouzot's Manon (1949), Jacques Becker's Touchez pas au grisbi (1954) and Jean Renoir's French Cancan (1955). Later she played in international films like The Young Lions (1958) with Marlon Brando and Julia (Fred Zinnemann, 1977) with Jane Fonda.

When she was two, her family moved from the German capital to Paris.\n\nAgainst the will of her parents, she aspired to become an actress. As an auditor she attended the courses taught by Louis Jouvet at the Conservatory. At the end of the 1930s, she started to appear as an extra in the cinema, in French films by Marc Allégret or Marcel Carné.\n\nOne of her first bigger screen appearances was as Juliette in Henri-Georges Clouzot's Manon (1949), an adaptation of Abbé Prevost's classic novel Manon Lescaut, updated to post-World War II France. That same year, she married the actor Raymond Pellegrin and soon they had a daughter, Danielle.\n\nDoll appeared in many French comedies, often as the bitch or the flirt with blond hair and too narrow sweaters. These comedies include Rendez-vous avec la chance/Bed for two (Emil-Edwin Reinert, 1950), with Danièle Delorme and La Rose rouge/The Red Rose (Marcello Pagliero, 1951). In both films, Louis de Funès featured in a supporting part.\n\nAn important role for her career was Lola, a cabaret dancer with a big heart and smile, in Touchez pas au grisbi (Jacques Becker, 1954) opposite Jean Gabin. Doll co-starred again with Gabin in Jean Renoir's French Cancan (1955).\n\nIn 1954, Raymond Pellegrin met Gisèle Pascaland he divorced from Doll in 1955.\n\nA few years later, she could be seen as Simone in The Young Lions (Edward Dmytryk, 1958), an American war drama shot in Paris. The film is based upon a novel by prolific American author Irwin Shaw, and stars Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and Dean Martin.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions du Globe, no. 444.

She also regularly returned to the theatre. In 1965, she married singer François Deguelt, but the two separated six years later.\n\nShe regularly could be seen in French and international films. In the celebrated Hollywood drama Julia (Fred Zinnemann, 1977), she is the woman passenger accompanying Lillian Hellman (Jane Fonda) when Lily smuggled $50,000 through Nazi Germany for her friend Julia (Vanessa Redgrave).\n\nIn that same year, she played the gym teacher in the popular coming-of-age drama Diabolo Menthe (Diane Kurys, 1977). Another small part in an interesting film was Madame Mayeul in Violette Nozière (Claude Chabrol, 1978). Isabelle Huppert stars as an adolescent girl, who poisons her parents in order to back up her gold-digger boyfriend to elope together. In 1982, Doll played in another masterpiece, Ettore Scola's La nuit de Varennes/That Night in Varennes with Jean-Louis Barrault and Marcello Mastroianni.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2000, Dora Doll played the grandmother Louise Chantreuil in the TV series Cap des Pins/Tide of Life. In that first French soap opera, she was the mother of Paul Barge and mother-in-law of Claude Jade. Her Louise Chantreuil can be seen as the French 'Miss Ellie'.\n\nIn 1993 Dora Doll was awarded the first Prix Reconnaissance des cinéphiles for French actresses in honour of her life's work. She was made Knight of France's Ordre national du Mérite (National Order of Merit) in 2000.\n\nDoll continued to act and IMDb counts a total of 223 film and TV credits. Her final film was Jacquou le Croquant (Laurent Boutonnat, 2007) featuring Gaspard Ulliel, and her last TV appearance was in the miniseries Les châtaigniers du désert/Chestnut desert (Caroline Huppert, 2010).\n\nDora Doll died of complications from a fall on 15 November 2015 at her home in Gard, France. She was 93.\n\nTrailer for Touchez pas au grisbi (1954). Source: Rialto (YouTube).\n\nTrailer for French Cancan (1955).

This Messter Film production premiered at the Mozartsaal in Berlin, on 28 September 1917. The later director Karl Freund did the cinematography of the beautiful mountain landscapes.\n\nGerman postcard by Rotophot in the Film Sterne series, no. 145. Photo: Messter Film, Berlin.

The situation worsens when Claudi gets pregnant from the son (Paul Hartmann) of a rich farmer, who refuses to marry her.\n\nUnable to stand the shame and scorn, the father kicks his daughter and her young baby out of the Geiserhof farm. The old farmhand Jörgl (Lupu Pick) and the father (Josef Klein) of the scoundrel who caused Claudi's misery prevent her from throwing herself from a cliff.\n\nYears pass. Claudi has moved in with her lover's father, while the lover has left long ago as he disobeyed his father to marry the girl. Claudi's own father has become a recluse and misanthropist. When an avalanche buries him, Claudi returns to life. The lover's father offers to marry Claudi to turn her into a respectable woman, while Claudi's son manages to reconcile Claudi and her father, who miraculously has survived the avalanche.\n\nWhen noticing this all, the lover repents and throws himself into an abyss on the spot where Claudi wanted to jump, together with her child.\n\nGerman postcard by Rotophot in the Film Sterne series, no. 509/4.

In 1964, two years after the release of the first James Bond film, Dr. No (1962), and the same year of the release of Goldfinger (1964), a large wave of espionage films was released. These European international co-productions imitated and/or parodied the 007 films.\n\nBritish postcard by Klasik Kards, London, no. 1543.
