        "text": "Though the technique of rapid editing was historically attributed to Soviet Russia, Gance actually pioneered the process in Das Rad (1923). It can also be seen in Napoleon (1927) with more heroic ambition.\n\nWhen Gance did not receive the necessary financial support to expand his masterpiece \"Napoleom\" to complete his original conception of a cinematic trilogy, he just discarded cans of film that would have been used, depriving future film historians of invaluable insights into the director's vision.\n\nWas asked by the Vichy Government, during 1941, to prove his Aryan origins to the head of the Cinema industry when accused of being Jewish.\n\nPublished his first article in the Parisian Cin√©-Journal entitled \"What is the cinema? A sixth art form!\" on March 9th 1912."
