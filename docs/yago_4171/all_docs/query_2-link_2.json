These two dramas, dissimilar in their construction and tone, are in fact closely akin, centered on the figure of two mad inventors, whose research results in the original mastery of light phenomena, or the very matter of cinema, a prodigious tool for extricating, revealing or transcending the visible.\n\n—Elodie Tamayo, La Cinémathèque française\n\nThe Madness of Doctor Tube (La folie du docteur Tube) 1915, Written By Gance, Photographed By Leonce-Henri Burel, With Albert Dieudonne, 14 Mins, Silent With French Intertitles And Simultaneous English Translation, B&W, 35m@20fps, From Cinémathèque Française"
