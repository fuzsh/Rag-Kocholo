Go to, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.’’ —genesis XI: 6, 7.\n\nWhen God confused our languages, he uttered, in sapphire tones: ‘‘Let there be translators!’’ And there were conjurors and necromancers and alchemists, but they did not su≈ce: they turned trees into emeralds, pools to seas. God spoke again: ‘‘Let there be carpenters who fasten edges, caulk the seams, splice timbers.’’ They were good. God said: ‘‘Blessed is the builder who leaves his tower, turns from bricks and mortar to marvel at the ﬂames, the smith who fumbles for prongs, wields andirons, and prods live coals, who stokes the hearth and welds two irons as one.’’ Praised was the man who wrote his name in other handwriting, who spoke in other tones, who, knowing elms, imagined ceiba trees and cypresses as though they were his own, ﬁnding new music in each limitation. Holy the one who lost his speech to others, subdued his pen, resigned his failing sight to change through ﬁre’s change, until he saw earth’s own ﬁre, the radiant rock of words. —Grace Schulman, ‘‘Let There Be Translators!’’\n\nContents\n\nEditor’s Note Introduction by Mary Ann Caws\n\nxxiii xxv\n\n1. 1897–1915: Symbolism, Post-Symbolism, Cubism, Simultanism Guillaume Apollinaire (Guillaume Apollinaris de Kostrowitzky) Zone / Zone (roger shattuck) L’Adieu / The Farewell (roger shattuck) Les Fenêtres / Windows (roger shattuck) Miroir / Mirror (roger shattuck) Toujours / Always (mary ann caws and patricia terry) La Petite Auto / The Little Car (ron padgett)\n\n6 14 14 16 18 18\n\nBlaise Cendrars (Frederick Louis Sauser) Journal / Newspaper (ron padgett) Ma danse / My Dance (ron padgett) Lettre / Letter (ron padgett) Prose du Transsibérien et de la petite Jeanne de France (extraits) / The Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jeanne of France (ron padgett)\n\n24 26 26\n\n28\n\ncontents\n\nPaul Claudel Octobre / October (james lawler) Tristesse de l’eau / The Sadness of Water (james lawler)\n\n38 40\n\nJean Cocteau Jeune ﬁlle endormie / Young Girl Sleeping (alfred corn)\n\n42\n\nLéon-Paul Fargue Une odeur nocturne . . . / A Fragrance of Night . . .

In considering the many poets writing in French in the twentieth century and just after, I have given less attention to the number of poems and pages per poet than to the more important goal of including as many poets from as many countries as a single volume permits. My aim has been to create a truly international anthology, one that represents the diversity and changing nature of French poetics during the century just past, giving su≈cient space to the voices of the living, while not letting them overwhelm those of the past. Every e√ort has been made to include poems that seem to have been most crucial to their own time as well as those from the present that demand to be read. The brief biographies of the poets that precede their works convey only the most basic information. Critical analyses of their works are not possible in such limited space. These small biographical notes do not include the many major prizes awarded to these poets, nor do they reference English translations of their works. The volumes of poetry cited as principal works are in some cases supplemented by signiﬁcant prose works, and occasionally by smaller works whose titles seem particularly indicative of an individual way of seeing or thinking. Not wishing to privilege any country in an international anthology, I have opted to include both the city and country as the poet’s birthplace, despite the apparent redundancy of, say, Paris, France, or Montreal, Canada. Previously published translations have been faithfully reprinted here as they ﬁrst appeared (except for corrections of what seemed obvious misprints or spelling errors). The many translations commissioned for this volume do reﬂect, of course, the voice of each translator. As in all bilingual editions, the translation is meant to draw attention to the original on the facing page.\n\neditor’s note\n\nThe editor is enormously grateful for help received from so many quarters. This publication would never have been possible without generous funding from the Florence Gould Foundation, the French Ministry of Foreign A√airs, and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the United States. My thanks to Yves Mabin and Agnès Young, of the Division de l’écrit et des médiathèques at the Ministère des a√aires étrangères, and in particular to Olivier Brossard; to John Young, of the Florence Gould Foundation; and to the Research Foundation of the City University of New York. At Yale University Press, the ongoing enthusiasm of my editor, John Kulka, proved crucial at every point, as was the assistance of Karen Gangel, Mary Traester, and Lauren Shapiro. My warm thanks to Maggie Nelson for her comments on contemporary American poetry, and to the French poets who have made me feel at home in their poems over so many years. Mariana Shackne, here in New York, deserves thanks for her tireless e√orts and patience. Above all, I am grateful to all the poets, publishers, and rights holders, whose contributions were invaluable. Of course the labor, time, and generosity of the translators far exceed any remarks or mention I can o√er here. What to say but thank you.\n\nxxiv\n\nIntroduction The poem is what has neither name, nor rest, nor place, nor dwelling: a ﬁssure moving towards the work. jacques garelli, ‘‘Excess of Poetry’’\n\nT\n\nhis anthology responds to the often expressed need for a large-scale bilingual representation of twentieth-century French-language poetry as a whole. In the tumult of our time, poetry o√ers itself as a borderless country in which we can all reside, at least temporarily. It is in this belief that I have undertaken this massive volume. For the ﬁrst time, as inhabitants of a brand-new century, we can look back at the twentieth century. Our evaluation, of course, will change with our reading as the years go on. Nothing is presumed about the lasting nature of any attempt to gather what seems important at the moment, except the goodwill of this team of translators and advisers, every one of whom has my deep gratitude. Many of the translations in this volume have been previously published—some appeared in books, some in journals—and many others have been commissioned speciﬁcally for this book. The choice of translators was crucial; I often consulted them about which writers—and then which poems—should be presented. I also listened, gratefully, to the counsel of Francophone and Anglophone friends. But ﬁnally, of course, as editor, I had to make my own choices, as intuitive as they were reasoned and often di≈cult, of both poets and poems. The bilingual presentation notwithstanding, I have tried to keep in mind the perspective of the non-French-speaking reader. Writing of the decision by the New York Review of Books not to retain him as a reviewer, the art historian Michael Fried described his way of being and seeing. Here he might well be speaking of my involvement with this volume. Fried was recognized, he says, as ‘‘someone whose primary commitment\n\nintroduction\n\nwas to certain works and artists and whose criticism and scholarship would invariably foreground that commitment in ways that would only imperfectly harmonize with prevailing styles of doing intellectual business both outside and within the academy.’’∞ This anthology, when it reaches the bookstore shelves, may well go against whatever styles of anthologizing are currently in vogue. My commitment is to a wide reach of works, with all the risk that entails, and to the judgment of the translators I have called upon. The deliberately extensive range of poets includes several who are well known, or even better known, in other genres: Georges Bataille, Samuel Beckett, Louis-René des Forêts, Andrée Chédid, Yves Bonnefoy, Annie Le Brun, and Michel Houellebecq, among others. Here they are considered only as poets—I do not think they would object. The presentation of poems in this anthology is largely chronological. As we move closer to the present, the proportion of female to male artists changes dramatically; additionally, the female voice takes on increasing assurance as various feminisms develop in France. In French feminisms, especially in the 1970s, the most visible and general approach was heavily psychoanalytic—for example, the work of Hélène Cixous, Julia Kristeva, and Luce Irigaray. In France, as in the United States, feminist agendas would become increasingly associated with the social sciences, relating domains formerly isolated from one another in the universities and public life. As Terry Eagleton says, the temper of the time was not only intellectually exciting, but it made room for much that had been excluded by male enthusiasts of what we call high theory.≤ For Jane Gallop, feminist writing in France (l’écriture féminine) is perfectly represented by the formative texts of Hélène Cixous, as in ‘‘Le Rire de la Méduse’’ (The Laugh of Medusa), characterized by a close relation to the body and sexuality; a multiplicity of sources, outlooks, and applications; and an appeal to the common woman (on the model of Virginia Woolf ’s ‘‘common reader’’). The focus on the personal and political, on what is generally termed identity politics, is far more often crucially felt in the poetic work of American feminists.≥ In the present anthology, more than a fourth of the poets and a third of the translators are women, a far greater percentage than is found in past anthologies of French poetry. Francophone poetry also came into its own in the twentieth century— hence the wide-ranging selection of Francophone writers. This international dimension encourages the cross-fertilization of various origins, tongues, and poetic approaches. What the Lebanese Francophone poet Vénus Khoury-Ghata claims about being doubly nourished by two languages could be attributed to many Francophone poets. For years, she says, her ﬁrst drafts were written in both Arabic, read from right to left, and French, from left to right.∂ The crossing of such linguistic paths— metaphoric, psychological, and material—often results in the most arxxvi\n\nintroduction\n\nresting poetic work. The Francophone selections in this volume are from African, Canadian, and West Indian sources—each with its unique heritage and context. The celebrations and authorial conditions of national independence are of crucial importance. Independence was won by Tunisia and Morocco in 1956, and by Algeria in 1959, and by the Central African Republic in 1960. During the 1960s in Africa and the Caribbean, in spite of independence, writers continued, for ﬁnancial reasons, to write in French, the language of the former colonizer, which entailed psychological conﬂict or, at the very least, a dose of ambivalence. In the 1930s, Aimé Césaire, Léopold Senghor, and Léon-Gontran Damas founded the inﬂuential négritude movement, which sought to restore the cultural identity of colonized Africans. The Martinican Aimé Césaire coined the term négritude in an article written for the student newspaper L’Étudiant noir. After taking his exams in 1935, the poet spent the summer in his homeland, a sojourn that inspired what is probably the best-known epic poem of return in French literature: Cahier d’un retour au pays natal. Returning once again to Martinique in 1939, this time for an extended period, Césaire expounded his theory of the image, in the same aesthetic spirit as André Breton and the Surrealists, who deﬁned the theory of the image, after the poet Pierre Reverdy, as the clash between elements from di√erent ﬁelds, providing a powerful jolt to the creative spirit. As Césaire claims in the celebrated essay ‘‘Poésie et connaissance’’ (Poetry and Cognition), ‘‘It is through the image, the revolutionary image, the distant image, the image which overturns all laws of thought, that man ﬁnally breaks through the barriers.’’∑ That inﬂuential essay ﬁrst appeared in the journal Tropiques, edited by Césaire, his wife Suzanne Roussy, and others. (It was by chance that Breton, in Martinique on his way to the United States from Marseilles, saw the ﬁrst issue of Tropiques in a shop window—a Surrealist coincidence, like his famous spotting of Giorgio De Chirico’s painting The Child’s Brain in a gallery window in Paris, at which sight he leapt o√ the bus to take a closer look.) In the meantime, Léopold Senghor and Léon-Gontran Damas were working in Paris, where, in the 1950s, they contributed to the journal Présence africaine, founded by the Senegalese philosopher Alioune Diop. African writing was now well enough established to support both a journal and the anthology Nouvelle somme de la poésie du monde noir. Albert Memmi’s highly inﬂuential essay ‘‘The Colonizer and the Colonized’’ appeared in 1957. Little by little, the countries of the Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) gained their independence.∏ The relation of Francophone literature of negritude (such as Césaire’s work, Senghor’s Chants d’ombre of 1945, and the journal L’Étudiant noir) to the black literature of the Harlem Renaissance, especially to the writings of Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, and Claude McKay, is well documented. xxvii\n\nintroduction\n\nIn each of the countries where colonial rule was overthrown, independence brought its own problems. After Quebec declared cultural independence from anglophone Canada in 1977 with the passage of controversial Bill 101 (which made French the o≈cial language of the province), anglophone businesses relocated outside the province. In addition, Quebec’s language and ﬁrmly Catholic tradition stood out more starkly than it had before against the Protestant majority in other parts of the country; freed from English, the Québecois language quickly returned to its native state. The successors to the famous École de littérature de Montréal are two celebrated Canadian writers, Anne Hébert and Gaston Miron.π Organization This anthology is divided into six chronological parts, reﬂecting major trends in French poetry during the twentieth century. Within the divisions, poems appear under an alphabetical listing by poet. Poets’ dates of birth, not the dates their ﬁrst books were published, determine the placement of their work. In the short essays preceding each of these sections, poets are discussed by generation—though, when speaking of contemporaries, the discussions are not strictly limited by birthdates. The present organization highlights six crucial pressure points in modern French poetry. They are the emergence of Dada in 1916; the changeover of the journal La Révolution surréaliste to Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution in 1930; the end of the war and André Breton’s return from his exile in New York to France in December of 1945, along with a number of other Surrealists; and then Bréton’s death in 1966, the same year the journal L’Éphémère was founded by Yves Bonnefoy, Jacques Dupin, Louis-René des Forêts, and Gaetan Picon. The penultimate division ends with 1980, the year Marguerite Yourcenar became the ﬁrst female member of the Académie française—a major event, as important, certainly, as the publication, in 1975, of the ﬁrst issue of L’Arc to be devoted to a woman (that issue carried the title ‘‘Simone de Beauvoir et la lutte des femmes,’’ or ‘‘Simone de Beauvoir and the Struggle of Women’’). Because poetic endeavors between the 1960s and the current era feel so intensely present, and to some extent continuous, my initial temptation, in the ultimate section, was to separate these forty or so years into two parts, alphabetically by poet: A through K and L through Y. But 1980 stood out for another reason besides Yourcenar’s admission to the Académie française. That watershed year marks the beginning of an international exchange between French and American poets—the publication of Jacques Roubaud and Michel Deguy’s anthology Vingt poètes américains. I have therefore chosen 1981 as the starting point for contemporary poets at the end of the twentieth century. xxviii\n\nintroduction\n\nWishing, above all else, to underscore the arbitrary nature of any such divisions, however, I think it valuable to bear in mind Charles Baudelaire’s three-part deﬁnition of modernity: that which is ﬂeeting, transitory, and contingent. The same deﬁnes any attempt to anthologize, including this one. Inclusions This collection represents the work of as many poets as possible, including poems by more than a few poets who, according to the cliché of prevailing wisdom, have not yet stood the test of time. That is not the only risk taken here, as a quick glance at the table of contents conﬁrms. Many poets are represented by several poems, others by just one—an editorial decision that runs counter to another commonplace view, namely, that it is impossible to get the feel of a poet’s work from a single selection. The choices were made with several criteria in mind, some of them made explicit in this introduction, some of them left implicit: all of us who have worked so hard on this volume hope that our best intentions will be met by those of our readers. Poetic Forms In addition to expected poetic forms—rhymed, unrhymed, free, and formal verse—I have included songs, dialogue poems, and a large selection of prose poetry. The interrelation of prose and verse earns the prose poem a respectful place among other forms of twentieth-century French poetry. Between 1915 and 1917 the prose poem came to the fore through the work of Max Jacob and Pierre Reverdy. For Jacob, the prose poem conveyed a feeling of closure, of completeness—the style and the situation removing it from everyday life and setting it o√ as a sort of perfect object. Here Francis Ponge’s objeu and proêmes would ﬁnd their antecedent. For Reverdy, on the other hand, the prose poem exempliﬁed an openness of form, an undecidability, as well as a kind of uncertainty, both impersonal and obsessive, at once attractive and disquieting. The impact of French prose poetry on contemporary American poets cannot be overstated and is overtly present in the works of John Ashbery, Michael Palmer, and Gustaf Sobin (who are among the translators in this volume). This intoxicating mix of genres started in France with Aloyisius Bertrand’s Gaspard de la nuit and was followed in English-language poetry by the prose poems of Gertrude Stein (mainly those written between 1915 and 1917, e.g., Portraits and Tender Buttons) and, later, by those of W. S. Merwin (The Miner’s Pale Children). More recently, the works of Ron Padgett and Anne Carson come to mind, as do those of Leslie Scalapino xxix\n\nintroduction\n\nand Lyn Hejinian. That this tradition spans so many epochs in twentiethcentury poetry gives encouragement to those who would claim, as I do, that the prose poem (distinct from the high merge of prose and poetic writing, as in William Carlos Williams’s Spring and All) represents at its best an ultimate grandeur of poetic form. In Rupture The idea of rupture—with past traditions, with the past in oneself, with the world around one—is not a modern one. After all, the PreRaphaelites had every reason to think of themselves as a rupture from Raphael, and, long before that, Rome was itself in rupture. The notion of a break is delightfully romantic in the broad sense and allied to Romanticism in a more restricted sense. The endurance of the idea is, like LouisRené des Forêt’s prolonged use of the term ostinato—the basso continuo or sostenuto underlying the melody or musical construction above it— just as sustaining and continuing and obstinately inescapable as the idea of progress. Did modern French and Francophone poetry break from the past? Certainly it did from the poetry of, say, Hugo and Verlaine, though less so from a past represented by Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and Mallarmé. But continuity, like discontinuity, is in the eye of the beholder. The declamations found in some of Paul Claudel’s work (think of his Cinq grandes odes and even his plays, such as Le Soulier de satin and the sublime Partage de midi) and in much of Saint-John Perse’s poetry (Anabase, Éloges, and why stop there?) are not necessarily in a di√erent key from those of Victor Hugo—perhaps it’s only in their modulation that they di√er signiﬁcantly, with no ‘‘hélas’’ needed.∫ Baudelaire’s splenetic laments, Rimbaud’s illuminating vision and revision, and Mallarmé’s abstraction, idealism, and typographic revolution ﬁnd equivalents not only in the early part of the century but in an undying present. Why not? Poetry is large enough to absorb innovation as it goes along. Re-Viewing In all ages of French literature, poetry has found itself reinvigorated by constraints, possibilities, and re-visioning, as in the mode of the poets of OULIPO (Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle, or Workshop of Potential Literature).Ω This literature ﬁnds its freedoms and attendant pleasures in rules and rigorous constraints. The Oulipian Georges Perec wrote La Disparition (translated as A Void), a nearly three-hundred-page xxx\n\nintroduction\n\nlipogrammatic novel in which the letter e never appears. Instead of reducing creative possibilities, as such constraints might seem to, they actually increase them. In a seemingly irrational way, such careful attention to the material word challenges, refashions, and enhances thought. Claude Berge, a founding member of OULIPO, is primarily responsible for the Oulipian use of combinatory structures. One example of his work takes a famous sonnet by Ronsard as its starting point: Quand vous serez bien vieille, au soir, à la chandelle, Assise auprès du feu, dévidant et ﬁlant, Direz chantant mes vers, en vous émerveillant: Ronsard me célébrait du temps que j’étais belle. Lors vous n’aurez servante oyant telle nouvelle, Déjà sous le labeur à demi sommeillant, Qui au bruit de mon nom ne s’aille réveillant, Bénissant votre nom, de louange immortelle. Je serai sous la terre et, fantôme sans os, Par les ombres myrteux je prendrai mon repos; Vous serez au foyer une vieille accroupie, Regrettant mon amour et votre ﬁer dédain, Vivez, si m’en croyez, n’attendez à demain: Cueillez dès aujourd’hui les roses de la vie.∞≠\n\nBerge rewrites it here in Fibonaccian style. Note the humor, concision, and irony: feu ﬁlant, déjà sommeillant. bénissez votre os je prendrai une vieille accroupie vivez les roses de la vie! (spinning ﬁre already nodding bless your bones I shall take an old woman crouching long live life’s roses!)∞∞ xxxi\n\nintroduction\n\nIn this rewritten structure—new, alarming, and fascinating—all the possibilities of verse and thought are called upon, not by the poet-writer but almost by the poem itself. It would be relatively easy to draw comparisons between the works of contemporary French-language poets represented here and those of their American counterparts of roughly the same ideological and formal outlook (the philosophical and morally oriented brilliance of John Ashbery; the ‘‘deep image’’ poetics of Robert Bly and W. S. Merwin and the richly cosmopolitan style of Richard Howard, John Hollander, and James Merrill; the language poetry of Lyn Hejinian, Bruce Andrews, Clark Coolidge, Ron Silliman, Charles Bernstein, and so on). Knowing that such comparisons are at once alluring and deceptive, I prefer to leave them to the reader. About his own work John Ashbery once said, ‘‘I thought that if I could put it all down, that would be one way. And next the thought came to me that to leave all out would be another, and truer, way.’’∞≤ The same might be said about my own stages of deliberation on the subject of comparisons. Spatiality Perhaps no text is more crucial to our understanding of contemporary poetry than Mallarmé’s Un coup de dés (A Throw of the Dice). Published in 1897 and rediscovered by the Cubists and André Gide in 1914, it was revolutionary in its use of typographical space. It is the starting point of what today is widely practiced as both concrete and visual poetry. In Mallarmé’s extraordinary poem, empty or white space (blanc in both senses) is as important as space occupied by the printed word, presence and absence thereby having been placed on equal footing. Type organizes itself on the page ideogrammatically. Lines are di√erentially measured depending on their role in relation to the poem’s overarching theme of shipwreck; the whole poem moves downward on the page to its doom on dry land—‘‘no place but place’’ itself—and to the conclusion that every thought projects its own throw of the dice, takes its own chance. When Mallarmé ﬁrst showed part of his Coup de dés to Paul Valéry, his friend is reported to have burst into tears because he understood at once that everything had been changed by this revolutionary event of poetry and art. Jacques Donguy says in his essay ‘‘Cyberpoésie’’ that Mallarmé’s epic poem ‘‘is the emblematic work of the twentieth century, its portico, and symbolizes the Macluhan-ian ‘shipwreck’ of the Gutenberg galaxy. For this text is the graph of a shipwreck, written ‘from the bottom of a shipwreck,’ and ends on the notion of chance, that Cage was later to systematize.’’∞≥ In the same essay, Donguy then looks back to Kurt Schwitxxxii\n\nintroduction\n\nter’s collages, made from ﬁndings in the street, and to his Merz work (a scrap from the noun Kommerz, or commerce); to Tristan Tzara’s words cut from a newspaper and jumbled in a hat; to Marcel Duchamp’s readymades and the Surrealists’ collective experiments in creating automatic poetry—all leading to the aleatory experiments of Lionel Ray and other contemporary French poets and to the cut-ups of the Americans Brion Gysin and William Burroughs. The ‘‘combine’’ art of contemporary American artists, especially that of Robert Rauschenberg, who included ordinary objects in his work, is closely related to the found poems and ‘‘found objects’’ (les objets trouvés) of the Cubist and Surrealist poets, as well as to Apollinaire’s poèmes-conversation (conversation poems). What you ﬁnd in the street or on the Web—all these constitute, inevitably, a sort of reticulated combination poem-painting, a spatialized discourse. Of course, in France the visual and the verbal were never compartmentalized. Like Cubism in art, contemporaneous poetry similarly involved the idea of looking at one object from several points of view. Although Pierre Reverdy and Max Jacob would have rejected the label Cubist as having nothing essential to say about their compositions, it is in fact a useful reference. Reverdy insisted, in his famous essay on the theory of ‘‘the Image,’’ that poetry was to be composed of two di√erent elements from two di√erent realms. The shock of their meeting would give o√ new creative light, allowing new ways of perceiving. This procedure carried straight over to Surrealism and its concept of the image as a composition of farﬂung elements. Guillaume Apollinaire, the best known of the Cubist poets, exempliﬁed poetic experimentation in his Alcools (1913), drawing on the ancient Latin-Christian tradition of ideogrammatic poetry, in which poems formed pictures—the other side of the concrete poetry so inﬂuenced by Stéphane Mallarmé’s typographical experiment, already visible in the idéogrammes of Paul Claudel. The emphasis on plastic poetry, by way of Max Jacob, Pablo Picasso, and Pierre Reverdy, made way for visual poetics. The juncture of painting and poetry has yielded such enthusiastic exhibitions and publications as Poésure et peintrie: ‘‘D’un art, l’autre’’ (Poeting and Paintry) and Yves Peyré’s Peinture et poésie: Le Dialogue par le livre, 1874–2000) (Painting and Poetry: the Dialogue through the Book.)∞∂ Fascination with the spatial has only increased with time. Witness the international excitement of Concrete Poetry: the work of the Swiss poet Eugen Gomringer, who, along with Decio Pignatari, August and Haroldo de Campos, and Mario de Andrade, founded the Noigandres Group; the poetry of the Scot Ian Hamilton Finlay and the American Emmet Williams (and later John Hollander, May Swenson, and many others); and the work of numerous poets in Japan, Argentina, Spain, Italy, and France. xxxiii\n\nintroduction\n\nAnd witness, too, the advent of the Spatialist Poetry of the French poet Henri Chopin and like-minded writers. Manifestos proliferate in the second half of the century, from Spatialism to Scum, from the aesthetic to the political, every movement wanting to proclaim its name and experimental newness.∞∑ Later, the stress on the materiality of words and the visuality of the imagination was associated with such movements as L=A=N= G=U=A=G=E poetry in North America. Founded by Bruce Andrews and Charles Bernstein, this movement emphasizes the word itself, as evidenced in the dramatic and eye-catching separation of letters. In its concentration on the very stu√ of language, in its consideration of the material of the word as all-important, in its excitement about the process of writing, at least one group in France can be singled out for comparison with the poetry on this side of the Atlantic. The close association of the French poets Emmanuel Hocquard, Olivier Cadiot, Pierre Alféri, AnneMarie Albiach, and Claude Royet-Journoud can be roughly considered the transatlantic equivalent of the poets of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E. John Ashbery asserts that it is not the often warring factions of poetic schools that interest him but individual poets—among them the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet Leslie Scalapino, for instance, and a few others. Experimental poetry and anything liberating, Ashbery says, are what really claim him. Although inﬂuenced by the Surrealists, he ﬁnds them too ‘‘restraining’’ to be of continuing interest. Similarly, he ﬁnds the rules of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets too constraining. The French poets with whom he feels the most a≈nity are Pascalle Monnier, Anne Portugal, Michel Deguy, Jacques Dupin, Dominique Fourcade, Emmanuel Hocquard, and Franck André Jamme, all of whom are represented in this volume. His personal reaction is antitraditional, in opposition to the poetry so often taught in the universities—for example, that of Robert Lowell and John Berryman. ‘‘I’m always trying to do something I’ve never done,’’ he says.∞∏ Shape John Berger has entitled a recent collection of essays The Shape of a Pocket (2001), a phrase that has led me to think about the nature of poetry. As a heart is shaped by what it loves, and a mind by what it admires, a voice may gain its surest tones by what the speaker or singer reads and hears. (The celebrated singer Patti Smith is fascinated by Blake and Rimbaud, and her verses are recognizably Rimbaudian. She also admires Blaise Cendrars, to whom she dedicated a poem called ‘‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Blaise Cendrars Is Not Dead.’’) The simplest container of them all, a pocket, is sooner or later shaped xxxiv\n\nintroduction\n\nby what is carried in it. Walk poems, perhaps above all others, are modiﬁed by what the speaker carries or picks up along the way. Roger Fry, the British art critic and painter, never traveled without a small volume of Mallarmé’s poems in his pocket. Kenneth Rexroth and Frank O’Hara carried small volumes of Reverdy’s poems, and William Carlos Williams, one of René Char’s. We remember Williams’ credo associated with that poet of brooding intensity and passion: René Char you are a poet who believes in the power of beauty to right all wrongs. I believe it also. ...................... let all men believe it, as you have taught me also to believe it.∞π\n\nJacques Roubaud once walked alongside the Mississippi, carrying in his pocket Mark Twain’s book about the great American river. Roubaud has written about this experience and the musings it occasioned but has chosen not to publish these writings for this reason: he has not yet returned to the banks of the Mississippi. It always takes two moments of seeing the same thing, he says, to really see it, ‘‘just as it does two eyes.’’∞∫ In any case, the poet’s pocket and the shape of what it bears may well have replaced what we used to think of as inﬂuence. It is not what you emulate but what you choose to carry with you that matters most. Overview With a backward glance at the nineteenth century we can now appreciate the wide range of all that Symbolism is or was: Baudelaire’s blend of romanticism and pre-Symbolism, Mallarmé’s extreme far-outness and original mysteriousness, Arthur Rimbaud’s visuality in Illuminations and elsewhere, including that shown in his great trip through poetry and the worlds of adventure called ‘‘Le Bateau ivre’’ (The Drunken Vessel), which conveyed the poem and its readers into explorations of the twentieth century. Appropriately, Part 1 of this volume includes the work of two great Symbolists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: Saint-Pol Roux and Paul Claudel. The work of Mallarmé’s disciple Paul Valéry presents the link between Symbolism and post-Symbolism: his poetry is marked by both classical form and classical references, along with a modern fascination with epistemology and human consciousness. In Valéry, Narcissus and Psyche meet contemporary psychological meditation. xxxv\n\nintroduction\n\nThe general temper of the French modernist poet is tinged with the kind of visionary exaltation and despair of nineteenth-century romantic revolution against the easy clichés of comfortable bourgeois thought (the ‘‘seated,’’ as Arthur Rimbaud called them). Rimbaud’s troubled and troubling perception of the split in poetic personality—‘‘je est un autre’’ (‘‘I is another’’), famously expressed in his letter of May 13, 1871, to Georges Izambard— has never ceased to echo in modern poetry. One of the elements di√erentiating French and British poetry of the socially concerned sort is an ingrained and seemingly invincible French idealism. As Edward Lucie-Smith and Simon Watson Taylor describe French poetry: ‘‘It has a moral force allied with enduring social (and often revolutionary) aspirations which have preserved it both from the narrow parochialism which has been the besetting sin of English poetry since the war, and from the naievety and sentimentality which have often characterized American poetry in its more determinedly experimental moments.’’∞Ω In the minds of many poets of the early twentieth century, poetry and travel seem to have been closely linked. Consider, for example, Apollinaire’s celebrated poem ‘‘Zone’’ (1912), which possesses much of the same heightened aura of nostalgia cast by the Symbolists—a feeling that calls to mind those often closed eyes of Redon’s faces or the ﬁnger on the lips to signal ‘‘silence’’—but in a joyous combination with the discoveries of an ongoing, open-eyed adventurer-poet. Instead of the silencing of speech, the poet now shouts, reads newspapers aloud, zips about here and there, ﬁrst across Paris, then across the Continent, the Orient, and the world of myth, celebrating celestial apparitions made modern, like Christ the aviator, and Oceanic ﬁgures. When Blaise Cendrars read aloud his unpunctuated and emotionally powerful ‘‘Les Pâques à New York’’ (Easter in New York) at a gathering in Paris, Apollinaire—who was among the listeners— is said to have been inspired to march home and remove the punctuation from his own long poem ‘‘Zone.’’ Cendrars’ own trans-European travels were set forth in his amazingly forward-looking ‘‘La Prose du Transsibérien et de la petite Jeanne de France’’ (1913). The work was marked ‘‘Prose,’’ he said, as a modest equivalent of poetry. The voyage of this ‘‘prose’’ of the Trans-Siberian railway is all the richer for Cendrars’ traveling companion, a naïve prostitute named ‘‘little Jeanne,’’ who o√ers this touching refrain as the two travel through distant lands: ‘‘Say, Blaise, are we really a long way from Montmartre?’’ When, ﬁnally, the travelers do return to Paris and the Ei√el Tower, the reader may reﬂect that the poem is indeed a homegrown product of the experimental poetic tornado of Paris (and therefore never a long way from Montmartre after all). The year 1913 was certainly an annus mirabilis in many domains. Proust, Gide, and Valéry were producing the masterpieces we know, and Apollinaire was busy with the publication of Alcools. xxxvi\n\nintroduction\n\nOne of the main sources of poetic excitement in the early part of the century was the cult of the primitive. After the carnage of the First World War, the perceived primitivism of blacks and African art was seen as a challenge to Western ‘‘progress’’ and culture and a repudiation of the colonial enterprise. Before and during the 1920s a wave of negrophilia swept Paris—the inﬂuence of black culture abundantly evident in the paintings of Picasso and André Derain, in the poetry of Guillaume Apollinaire, and, slightly later, in the Dada works of the Romanian Tristan Tzara (ﬁrst performed in 1916 in Zurich in the Cabaret Voltaire). Tzara’s magniﬁcent Vingt-cinq poèmes are full of sounds imitating ‘‘primitive’’ languages. For example, the poem ‘‘Pélamide’’ begins a e ou o youyouyou I e ou o youyouyou drrrrdrrrrdrrrrgrrrrgrrrr≤≠\n\nAnd the delightful poem ‘‘Moi touche-moi touche-moi seulement’’ (Me touch me just touch me) takes up the same sound: mécanisme drrrr rrrrr barres écartées (mechanism drrrr rrrrr bars spread apart)≤∞\n\nThis explosion of sound is motivated, if not explained, by the narrator’s picturing himself as the kind of engine that goes anywhere when it is enamored of something or someone: je suis tramway quelque-part va-et-vient dans l’amour (I am a tram somewhere going and coming in love).≤≤\n\nTzara’s hatred of the ordinary in language and vision unleashes, in the Dada poems, a frenetic excitement verging on hysteria. If the typographical and sound poetry of this period borrowed from what were giddily considered primitive cultures, the fascination with ‘‘the other’’ continued throughout the early part of the century. Anthropological investigations, such as those in the Swiss journal Anthropos gave credibility and backing to poetic experimentation. The distinction drawn by Senghor—‘‘Emotion is black; reason is Hellenic’’—was not considered wildly untrue.≤≥ The excitement over Dada, mixed with despair over World War I, led in its own noisy way to the more organized collective and manifestowriting Surrealist movement of the early 1920s. In the early days of Surrealism, André Breton was acknowledged as its Pope, and indeed he comported himself as such. Church doctrine, as decreed by Breton, was heavily based on the belief in ‘‘psychic automatism’’—freeing the unconscious for verbal and visual experimentation—which included dreams, xxxvii\n\nintroduction\n\ntrances, and a number of liberating techniques to overthrow the rational reserve that imprisoned the mind and the writing wrist. A strange coherence is found in these automatic texts. In the neoRomanticism of Surrealism (‘‘We are the tail of romanticism,’’ Breton used to declare, ‘‘but how prehensile’’), the enigmatic and the puzzling were perceived as the marvelous—and so, to be saluted as the manifestation of a solution to a problem one didn’t know one had.≤∂ The canonical texts of 1922 (like Breton’s ‘‘Entry of the Mediums’’) as well as those of 1924 (the ﬁrst of Breton’s Surrealist manifestos, Aragon’s Vague de rêves, and his extraordinary Paysan de Paris [Paris Peasant]) all salute the power of the image, its ability to bring together what had seemed sadly separate. This is the grand epoch of Surrealism. These collective games and experiments were carried on amid a circle of vivid characters and brilliant writers that included the novelist Louis Aragon and the poet Paul Éluard, both of whom would later join the Communist Party and remain two of its staunchest adherents. Robert Desnos, perhaps the greatest Surrealist poet, was to die in the Terezin concentration camp, choosing not to testify against other Resistance ﬁgures. Just before his death, he turned to a more traditional form of poetry, writing in what could be considered classic verse. Benjamin Péret, Breton’s most ardent and faithful disciple, wrote excitedly about automata in his enthusiastic and temperamental way and viliﬁed the political engagement of Aragon and Éluard, believing—as did Breton—that poetry was its own honor and should not fall into any shade of political trap or praise. Antonin Artaud, for a while in charge of the O≈ce of Surrealist Dreams and author of some of the most remarkably passionate texts, including D’un voyage au pays des Tarahumaras (A Voyage to the Tarahumaras), lapsed into madness. A few Surrealists were expelled from the group for various reasons, among them making money in order to live or, worse still, indulging in journalistic activities—clear betrayals of Surrealism’s antibourgeois ideal. No less sacrilegious was the use of the hallowed name of Lautréamont for a popular nightclub. Isidore Ducasse, better known as the comte de Lautréamont, was a ﬁrm believer that ‘‘poetry is made by all’’: in other words, down with the individual poet and the creator (or ﬁnder) of the most celebrated Surrealist image, that of the super-erotico-bizarre encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on a dissection table. The author of Maldoror and forefather of Surrealism was not to be associated with the light, the frivolous, or the horrors of commercial undertakings. But the Surrealist spirit in poetry, as in life, was to mark successive generations. In World War II, the great poets Char and Reverdy refused to publish during the Occupation. Silence was, they thought, the best xxxviii\n\nintroduction\n\nweapon. Breton and several others took refuge in Marseilles at the Bel Air mansion, owned by the American Jane Gold; it was there that Varian Fry ran the Committee for Political Refugees, orchestrating plans for the foremost intellectuals to leave France for the United States. Breton was among the French refugees in New York, which was not to his liking (he preferred the West and Native American culture). In New York, he was brieﬂy associated with Charles Henri Ford’s small elegant magazine of art and literature called View. Home to the Abstract Expressionists and their expressive personal visions, the magazine occupied an opposite pole from the Partisan Review and The Nation. With the help of the American artist David Hare, Breton, who learned no English, set up a rival magazine called VVV, where the Surrealists could publish, as they often did, in French. Although Breton managed from his New York headquarters to keep up his and the group’s enthusiasm for collective manifestations and the seriously played games of Surrealism, he returned to France as soon as it was safe to do so. But once there, he discovered that conditions were no longer as conducive to the kind of poetry he had championed. In response, he turned toward a more mystical context, still invoking chance and the everyday marvelous, surrounded now by a younger group of adepts. In the meantime, Surrealism had spread internationally. The Martinican journal Tropiques displayed a Surrealism of negritude that was as vivid as anything that had preceded it in Paris. Aimé Césaire, René Ménil, Léon-Gontran Damas, and other Francophone poets held an ongoing belief in the marvelous, that is, the power of surprise, in the Surrealist sense of the word (le merveilleux), the overwhelming encounter with a person, an object, or an event that can happen in everyday life to someone in a state of readiness or expectation (disponibilité). This openness was to endure beyond the political upheavals of the French presence in Algeria and other tribulations from which poetry often seemed an escape. Martinican Surrealism was a memorial to su√ering. Césaire’s Cahier d’un retour au pays natal (Return of a Manchild to the Promised Land) is a noble record of the poetry of the heart, as are many other postcolonial poems in French. Latter-day manifestations of Surrealism, such as those of Joyce Mansour in her violent texts and the incendiary prose of Annie Le Brun, bear witness to the ongoing force of the Surrealist spirit. In 1966, the year of Breton’s death, it was apparent that the modern poetic spirit was not monolithic: the new experiments di√ered, ranging from the place-oriented poems of René Char, who had been a Resistance leader, celebrated for his poetic war journal (‘‘Feuillets d’Hypnos’’) and his lyric evocation of Provence, to l’objeu (the object game) of Francis xxxix\n\nintroduction\n\nPonge, who emphasized the materiality of the poetic process and its product. Ponge placed himself and his work, explicitly based on everyday perception, in a close-up zoom, as he put it in the 1942 title Le Parti-pris des choses (On the Side of Things), an attitude congenial to that of the concrete poets. Also in 1966, Yves Bonnefoy, Jacques Dupin, André du Bouchet, Louis-René des Forêts, and Claude Estéban founded a journal entitled L’Éphémère, devoted to the notion of passage and marked by an association between the verbal and the visual (for example, the collaboration between Bonnefoy and Alberto Giacometti). The inﬂuence of L’Éphémère was to last far beyond its voluntary demise in 1973. The philosophical and poetic writings of Edmond Jabès, an Egyptian Jew whose work was ﬁrst applauded by Max Jacob and then Jacques Derrida, and the diverse textual representations of the enormously diverse places for poems of the heart and the mind, as well as of the living body, are as representative of the 1970s and 1980s as are the highest ﬂights of French poetry after 1980. More recently, there have been any number of experimental manifestations that demonstrate new, ever growing and changing ways of looking at poetry, such as Emmanuel Hocquard’s Une journée dans le détroit (1980), Jacques Roubaud’s Les Troubadours (1981), Liliane Giraudon’s Je marche ou je m’endors (1982), Dominique Fourcade’s Le Ciel pas d’angle (1983), Claude Royet-Journoud’s Les Objets contiennent l’inﬁni (1983), Anne-Marie Albiach’s Mezza Voce (1984), and Denis Roché’s La Poésie est inadmissible (1995). As is the case with poetry worldwide, there is now a tremendous emphasis on performance, on the oral manifestation essential to the ever more rapidly moving world with which it has to keep pace. Technology and creation walk hand in hand: along with rap, slam, and reggae go all varieties of digital practice and Internet enthusiasm. Just as musical form and an idealism of abstraction were the touchstones that inspired typographical experiments in the late nineteenth century, the technological advances of the late twentieth century have become the model for much of the poetry we experience in the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century. The interactive nature of the contemporary world, psychological and political, local and global, gives poetry a new place. As Edouard Glissant puts it, erstwhile boundaries in this new ‘‘tout-monde’’—the everyone everywhere world—have become permeable. ‘‘Geographically,’’ say the editors of Zigzag poésie, ‘‘the local becomes ﬂuid and energized.’’≤∑ In such a world, poetry has to be a place for increasing exchange. And it is. As Jacques Derrida notes, translation is generosity. And as Walter Benjamin would have it—and so would we—languages supplement one another. Bilingual anthologies, with all their translation work, xl\n\nintroduction\n\ngather innumerable items into innumerable divisions, which any editor, poet, reader, or translator could endlessly alter according to what seems most viable at the moment. John Ashbery gets it right for all of us: Yet each knew he saw only aspects, That the continuity was ﬁerce beyond all dream of enduring.≤∏\n\nThe celebrated ‘‘death of the author’’ proclaimed by Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and other theorists is taken up later in these essays, along with the additional and perhaps more crucial contemporary worry about the poet, the poem, and their status in view of the constant increase of invasive technology. In my view, all the arguments and debates that arise from these concerns, quite like the seventeenth-century debate over classic and modern forms, known as the ‘‘Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes’’ (The Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns), are good for poetry and invigorating for the poetic spirit. Small and large journals and presses remain locked in economic crisis, but at least these heated and attention-getting debates focus on the problem of poetry and the ways poems relate to the world around them, and to us.≤π Poetry in France remains very much alive. French and the many varieties of ﬂourishing Francophone poetic thought and work, through new experimentation, new forms, new ways of looking, and an increasingly important accent on women’s poetry, give us poetic hope for the twentyﬁrst century. Today The great nineteenth-century thinker and seer John Ruskin had as his motto just one word: ‘‘Today.’’ This anthology is intended to be part of the today in which it has been assembled, meditated upon, and completed. It imagines itself as a generous, loosely linked o√ering of poetic works in communication with each other, and with us, aimed at a new range of selections and an increased perception of old and new texts. Here I am thinking of Yves Bonnefoy’s recent meditation Sous l’horizon du language, in which he expresses the poetic hope that the ongoing quarrel between the sign and the representation does not irreparably undo the mountains and the cleft between them, through which the poet can see— and lets us see—the sky.≤∫ Today poetry asks as many questions as it always has, about itself and ourselves, and so lets us ﬁnd, with renewed energy, whatever we might want to become eventually or re-become. Energy and exchange might well be the watchwords of what we intended to do here. ‘‘There ought to be room for more things, for spreading out, like,’’ says John Ashbery.≤Ω For this big book, the ﬁnal choice of xli\n\nintroduction\n\npoets and poems depended, in many cases, on the individual translators in consultation with the editor. The enduring wish of all those involved in this production is that through their contribution readers may, in their turn, discover something new that may matter even greatly to their future readings.

Dictation of thought, in the absence of any rational control, with no esthetic or moral consideration).

He and Paul Claudel, seven years his senior, represent the ongoing heritage from the great ur-Symbolist Stéphane Mallarmé—a heritage that continues with Paul Valéry. The latter is best known for his epic poem ‘‘Le Cimetière marin,’’ published here in its entirety in a recent translation by the Irish poet Derek Mahon. Just as Valéry’s ﬁgure of the rameur, or rower, strains against the current, so the translator struggles with and against the French rhyme; Mahon places equivalent, if nonrhyming, stresses on his own lines. Valéry’s ‘‘La Fileuse’’ remains one of the most di≈cult and impressive manifestations of how form and visuality work together. Grace Schulman’s translation, commissioned for this volume, threads its own understanding through form and vision. The wide-reaching poems of Saint-John Perse (Alexis Saint-Léger Léger) stretch from his early Exils through the classic recall of Anabase to the triumph of Amers, a title that suggests both the sea (mer) and bitter memory (amer)—Seamarks is Wallace Fowlie’s ingenious English title. The poetry of Perse calls to mind Paul Claudel’s biblically toned versets,\n\npart 1. 1897 – 1915: symbolism, post-symbolism, cubism, simultanism\n\nwhose length is based on the rhythm of the human breath. Claudel interweaves prose and poetry in his longer poems (and in his poetic plays), all of which are unmistakably lofty in style and conception. On the other hand, no one could fail to recognize the powerful simplicity that characterizes his prose poetry in Connaissance de l’Est (The East I Know). These last brief poems, written when Claudel was the French ambassador to China, remain striking examples of the prose poem: they are unforgettable, inimitable. Another extraordinary adventurer into China in the early part of the century was Victor Segalen, doctor, essayist, and poet. The hieratic prose poems collected in Stèles (Stelae) are a haunting presence, at once exotic and strangely familiar. As one commentator has noted, ‘‘Epigraph and carved stone, the stele stands there, body and soul, a complete being . . . this hard composition, this density, this internal equilibrium and these angles. . . . Thence the challenge to whomever would have them say what it is they keep. They scorn to be read. . . . They do not express; they signify; they are.’’∞ These verbal monuments are not only the records of an eccentric and brilliant traveler to the East but a document of the French expansion of vision in the twentieth century, to China and beyond. The genre of the stela is unique unto itself, celebrating life, death, and the ongoing construction and duration of poetic monuments. No twentieth-century French poet is more beloved than the immensely appealing Guillaume Apollinaire. As someone once remarked to me, Apollinaire, almost alone among poets, has left a legacy of congeniality, not only in his time but in ours. Learned ‘‘Apollinaire specialists’’ from around the world collectively celebrate the poet who died of a shrapnel wound just as World War I was ending. (‘‘A bas Guillaume,’’ people shouted in the streets; they, of course, meant the emperor, not Apollinaire.) An elegy to him by Tristan Tzara, founder of the Dada movement, is an unforgettable lament. In Apollinaire’s work on the Cubist poets and painters, such as Pablo Picasso, he created an atmosphere conducive to poetic thought and visuality and to the forms of modernism saluted in his epic ‘‘Zone,’’ at once nostalgic and forward-looking, combining the cosmic and the local, the airplane and the newspaper. Blaise Cendrars—whose adopted name suggests the embers (la braise) and ashes (les cendres) of inner conﬂagration, of self-immolation, as only the ﬁrst step toward re-creation of the self—is a poet of tremendous inﬂuence whose contagious enthusiasm endures. Above all else, Cendrars was fascinated with the multiform elements of the modern: ‘‘Profound today,’’ the title of one of his essays, might sum up his poetic achievement. His passion for real and imagined travel (‘‘Prose du Transsibérien et de la petite Jeanne de France,’’ this long, superb travel poem called ‘‘Prosa,’’ 2\n\npart 1. 1897 – 1915: symbolism, post-symbolism, cubism, simultanism\n\nafter the religious form, as in Prose pour les morts) and his hypnotic, emotional power had a decided inﬂuence not only on Apollinaire but on English-language poets as well, from the Beats on. The interrelations of prose and poetry are always to be reinvented and rethought. Particularly in the early years of the century, the interrelating of genres provokes a special excitement. Note 1. Victor Segalen, Stèles (Paris: Gallimard, 1973), pp. 21–24. In a letter to Jules de Gaultier of February 3, 1913, Segalen says of these monument poems: ‘‘In this Chinese mold, I placed what I had to express’’ (p. 13). Timothy Billings and Christopher Bush have recently translated and commented upon these poems, at the time of this writing; their work is invaluable.\n\n3\n\nGuillaume Apollinaire (Guillaume Apollinaris de Kostrowitzky) 1880–1918 rome, italy\n\nA\n\npollinaire came to the forefront of the modern age through both his poetry and his spirit of invention, serving as a sounding board for many new ideas of his time. He continues to feel among the freshest of\n\ncontemporary poets. He is credited with publicizing Cubism as a movement, coining the term surrealism, which he applied to his play Les Mamelles de Tirésias,\n\nand inventing the ‘‘conversation poem’’—for example, a collage of remarks overheard in a bar or a bus. Born in Rome to a Polish mother and Italian father, Apollinaire sometimes claimed he was the Pope’s son. He was extremely gregarious and, after moving to Paris at the age of twenty, had friends among painters and writers such as Picasso, André Derain, Marie Laurencin, and Alfred Jarry. Principal works: Alcools: Poèmes, 1898–1913, 1913; Calligrammes: Poèmes de la paix et de la guerre, 1913–1916, 1918; Il y a, 1925; L’Esprit nouveau et les poètes, 1946; Ombre de mon amour (poèmes à
