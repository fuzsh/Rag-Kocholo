        "text": "Here is the link I found after reading the first post...\n\nhttp://hopelies.com/2015/02/05/napoleonreborn/\n\nI just posted this information on Nitrateville & hoping the original article's poster didn't mistake April 5th for the 1st.\n\nCat\n\nI found out about it via a French TV video clip posted over at Home Theater Forum of Coppola announcing the project...by film restoration icon Robert A. Harris...it's in his thread at HTF's blu-ray sub-forum titled \"While we wait for...a few words about Lawrence Of Arabia\", which is his running thread there about all things involving film restoration...obviously this is the biggest news to hit that thread in quite a while...\n\nAs the link in Cat's post suggests, probably not. This almost certainly means that Carl Davis' score will not be a part of this restoration, either.\n\nWhile I favor the longest reconstruction possible (at a speed true to the Director's original intent), I'm concerned about the prospect of Brownlow's life-long restoration efforts being marginalized, not to mention the omission of Carl Davis's monumental score. Perhaps I'm overly suspicious that Francis Ford Coppola's motivation is to establish his father's score as the only version associated with Gance's ground breaking epic, but the fact that no endorsement or comment in respect to the \"Apollo\" version has thus far been made by Kevin Brownlow speaks volumes.\n\nCat\n\nMy biggest concern here is that the projected speed might be slowed considerably to make the new restoration appear to be a much longer version.\n\nCatheter sales are booming in our demographic.\n\nCat\n\nI saw Kevin's restoration at the Paramount in Oakland three years ago; made the sojourn from Texas by train. Loved it.\n\nCarl Davis conducting his own score was amazing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm excited that we're getting Coppola's restoration with his dad's sync'd score.\n\nIt looks like we'll finally have this on blu-ray (probably 4K medium) for the home market as well.\n\nCat\n\nPS: Sorry 'bout the hammy photobucket image & framing, ...couldn't resist.\n\nThe better cinemas do burgers and fries (at least the ones here do), some do fancy meals.\n\nFor Napoleon, I highly doubt that Dots will be on the menu.\n\nI'll be wolfing down popcorn like it's going out of style\n\nIf film restorers can uncover more Napoleon footage, why can't they find the missing footage for Greed.\n\nSame here, I saw it at Gusman Hall in Miami with a orchestra.\n\nIt was a experience, especially the multi-screen battle scenes.\n\nI think those concerns are quite justified, given what has transpired in the past with this film concerning the Coppola score vs. the Davis score.\n\nAnd that feeling was reinforced even more after reading some of the comments in the earlier thread at Nitrateville (which I obviously missed when I posted my earlier questions - sorry about that):\n\nhttp://www.nitrateville.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19306#p147116"
