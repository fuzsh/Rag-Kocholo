Belgium, Croatia, Luxembourg, Monaco, Romania, San Marino, Slovenia, Switzerland & Vatican City ...}\n\n🟡 Spanish vs. Italian vs. French vs. Portuguese | Romance Languages Comparison [Language Of Earth | 4:32] 🟡\n\n- - - -\n\nLe Cinéma : Ludivine Sagnier (born 3 July 1979, La Celle-Saint-Cloud, France)\n\nI've been thinking about who I consider to be the greatest French actress of this century so far. For me, personally, I would choose Ludivine Sagnier, and for a multitude of reasons. I think she's been near note-perfect in the films I've seen her in. She's consistently worked with interesting filmmakers, challenging herself constantly, and she's created a diverse line-up of characters in the process. She's worked across a range of genres, and I feel she's equally adept at heavy drama and light comedy, with a flair for capturing something in between.\n\nFor good measure, she's also a member of Francois Ozon's stock company. They initially bonded over a shared love of the work of Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Ozon's my favourite French filmmaker of the 21st century thus far. I'm actually planning on recording one of his movies tonight that I'd like to see, the war drama 'Frantz' (2016), which is being screened by the British Broadcasting Corporation as the second half of a Friday night double-bill, with Francis Coppola's war drama 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) screening first. Sagnier has said about working with Ozon, \"We're like children playing with dolls\".\n\n'Ludivine Sagnier’s second outing with new wave film veteran Claude Chabrol has finally made it across the Channel. In the sly melodrama 'The Girl Cut in Two', she plays Gabrielle, a TV weathergirl torn between a famous novelist and a suave libertine. Exuding the sprightly effervescence that makes the character so appealing to men, she also manages to bring out Gabrielle’s naivety.\n\nUnsurprisingly, she wasted little time deliberating about whether to work with Chabrol. ‘He’s part of the history of cinema, like Hitchcock, Bergman, Truffaut and Godard, so working with him was like entering this great pantheon of directors,’ she says. ‘It’s the cinema I worship, so I said yes immediately.’\n\nThe 78-year-old Chabrol doesn’t bother with casting sessions. Instead, Sagnier met him in a café where she realised her list of questions was redundant. ‘Claude told me about the catering on-set,’ she says. ‘He talked about it for an hour, so I knew I would be well-fed.’\n\nChabrol himself has described The Girl Cut in Two as a ‘chaste film about perversity’. Inspired by a real-life crime of passion in early 20th century America, it takes a peek behind the closed doors of a swingers club.\"\n\n- The List\n\nLudivine Sagnier, Claude Chabrol & Julie Depardieu at the Grand Siecle Laurent Perrier Gala\n\n'Papa T’es Plus Dans Le Coup'\n\nSagnier comes from a family of musicians. I believe this is reflected in some her work. She studied classical music as a young girl and her father envisioned her having a career as a concert pianist. Her first love, however, was for the theatre, so when she pursued a career in the arts, she instantly took to the stage. She's said in interviews that she had no intention of working in cinema as theatre was her primary passion. She did however gain film work as a child actress, notably on Alain Resnais' dry comedy 'I Want To Go Home' (1989) and Jean-Paul Rappeneau's poetic drama 'Cyrano De Bergerac' (1990). This enabled her to draw upon early experience.\n\n\"I remember that there was this book I read, Letters to a Young Poet, by Rainer Maria Rilke, and so this young poet was asking Rilke whether he should go and have an artistic career, and Rilke was saying to him, ask yourself about the necessity. If you cannot live without expressing yourself and expressing your feelings and interpreting human nature, if you can't live without it, then your duty is to achieve it. And, when I read it, I remember it was really striking, and that's what gave me the impulse to go on.\"\n\n- Ludivine Sagnier, Under The Radar\n\nLudivine Sagnier & Virginie Ledoyen\n\n'Les Yeux Au Ciel' - Alex Beaupain, Clotilde Hesme & Ludivine Sagnier\n\n-\n\nMy 13 Favourite Ludivine Sagnier Movies\n\n'Water Drops On Burning Rocks' (2000 - Francois Ozon)\n\n'8 Women' (2002 - Francois Ozon)\n\n'Little Lili' (2003 - Claude Miller)\n\n'Small Cuts' (2003 - Pascal Bonitzer)\n\n'Swimming Pool' (2003 - Francois Ozon)\n\n'Paris, je t'aime' (2006 - Alfonso Cuaron segment)\n\n'A Girl Cut In Two' (2007 - Claude Chabrol)\n\n'Les Chansons d'Amour' (2007 - Christophe Honore)\n\n'A Secret' (2007 - Claude Miller)\n\n'Lily Sometimes' (2010 - Fabienne Berthaud)\n\n'Love Crime' (2010 - Alain Corneau)\n\n'Love Is In The Air' (2013 - Alexandre Castagnetti)\n\n'Lou!'

She has acted in theatre and television, where she's worked on 'The Young Pope' and 'The New Pope', as well as 'Lupin'. She has commitments to her family and French filmmaking schedules have been severely disrupted by the global pandemic of late.\n\nStill, I'm glad to learn that Sagnier is planning to make a return to cinema very soon. She has two new projects in the pipeline. One is a comedy about migration and the other is a domestic drama. It's been so long already, I think I might have to watch those 'Pope' dramas with Jude Law in explosive speedos.\n\n\"Cinema is my religion and France is the Vatican.\"\n\n- Quentin Tarantino\n\nLudivine Sagnier & Julie Depardieu\n\nBelgian performers often work in France, and vice versa. It's interesting to consider the work of a leading German actress like Diane Kruger (born 15 July 1976, Algermissen, Lower Saxony, Germany). Kruger left home and went to Paris where she became a model. She became fluent in French and embarked upon a career in acting. Due to circumstance as much as anything, Kruger is now better known for her film work in France than the films she's made in Germany. The same couldn't be said for some of her compatriots and contemporaries like Christiane Paul (born 8 March 1974, Berlin, Germany), Franka Potente (born 22 July 1974, Münster, Germany), Julia Jentsch (born 20 February 1978, Berlin, Germany), or Antje Monning (born 2 February 1978, Münster, Germany).\n\n\"I don’t know what I would be if the Lumiere brothers’ mother and father had never met. I’d probably be selling royales with cheese at McDonalds.”\n\n- Quentin Tarantino at the Lumiere Awards\n\nDiane Kruger & Ludivine Sagnier\n\n'Do It In Paris' with Ludivine Sagnier\n\nIf I were to guess which European peformer might be heading to France some time soon, my money would be on Swedish actress Alicia Vikander. Typically, Swedish performers have tended to gravitate more towards Italy, or Germany, but were she to go to France, she could follow in the footsteps of Anna Karina and Sara Forestier, two of France's finest actresses, both of whom were born in neighbouring Denmark.\n\nAlicia Vikander\n\n-\n\n21st Century : 30 Great Performances from 30 Gifted Performers\n\n01) Aissa Maiga (Born 25 May 1975, Dakar, Senegal) : 'Mood Indigo' (2013, Michel Gondry)\n\n02) Marie Gillain (Born 18 June 1975, Liège, Belgium) : 'Female Agents' (2008, Jean-Paul Salome)\n\n03) Cecile De France (Born 17 July 1975, Andenne, Belgium) : 'A Secret' (2007, Claude Miller)\n\n04) Marion Cotillard (Born 30 September 1975, Paris, France) : 'Innocence' (2004, Lucile Hadzihalilovic)\n\n05) Audrey Tautou (Born 9 August 1976, Beaumont, France) : 'A Very Long Engagement' (2004, Jean-Pierre Jeunet)\n\n06) Sophie Quinton (Born 31 August 1976, Villedieu-les-Poêles, France) : 'April In Love' (2006, Gerald Hustache-Mathieu)\n\n07) Virginie Ledoyen (Born 15 November 1976, Aubervilliers, Seine-Saint-Denis, France) : 'House Of Voices' (2004, Pascal Laugier)\n\n08) Virginie Efira (Born 5 May 1977, Schaerbeek, Brussels, Belgium) : 'An Impossible Love' (2018, Catherine Corsini)\n\n09) Melanie Laurent (Born 21 February 1983, Paris, France) : 'Don't Worry, I'm Fine' (2006, Philippe Lioret)\n\n10) Lea Seydoux (Born 1 July 1985, Passy, Paris, France) : 'Farewell, My Queen' (2012, Benoit Jacquot)\n\n11) Roxanne Mesquida (Born 1 October 1981, Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhône, France) : 'The Last Mistress' (2007, Catherine Breillat)\n\n12) Louise Bourgoin (Born 28 November 1981, Rennes, France) : 'The Extraordinary Adventures Of Adèle Blanc-Sec' (2010, Luc Besson)\n\n13) Julie-Marie Parmentier (Born 13 June 1981, Saint-Quentin, Aisne, France) : 'Marie-Jo And Her Two Lovers' (2002, Robert Guediguian)\n\n14) Melanie Thierry (Born 17 July 1981, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) : 'The Princess Of Montpensier' (2010, Bertrand Tavernier)\n\n15) Emelie Dequenne (Born 29 August 1981, Belœil, Wallonia, Belgium) : 'The Girl On The Train' (2009, Andre Techine)\n\n16) Josephine De La Baume (Born 8 October 1984, Paris, France) : 'Kiss Of The Damned' (2012, Xan Cassavetes)\n\n17) Lizzie Brochere (Born 22 March 1985, Paris, France) : 'One To Another' (2006, Pascal Arnold & Jean-Marc Barr)\n\n18) Sara Forestier (Born 4 October 1986, Copenhagen, Denmark) : 'The Names Of Love' (2010, Michel Leclerc)\n\n19) Vimala Pons (Born 15 March 1986, Thiruvananthapuram, India) : 'Struggle For Life' (2016, Antonin Peretjatko)\n\n20) Deborah Francois (Born 24 May 1987, Rocourt, Liège, Belgium) : 'Populaire' (2012, Regis Roinsard)\n\n21) Anais Demoustier (Born 29 September 1987, Lille, France) : 'The New Girlfriend' (2014, Francois Ozon)\n\n22) Noemie Merlant (Born November 27, 1988 in Paris, France : 'Curiosa' (2019, Lou Jeunet)\n\n23) Pauline Etienne (Born 26 June 1989, Ixelles, Belgium) : 'Eden' (2014, Mia Hansen-Love)\n\n24) Izia Higelin (Born 24 September 1990, Paris, France) : 'Summertime' (2015, Catherine Corsini)\n\n25) Alice Isaaz (Born 26 July 1991, Bordeaux, France) : 'One Wild Moment' (2015, Jean-Francois Richet)\n\n26) Christa Teret (Born 25 June 1991, Paris, France) : 'Renoir' (2012, Gilles Bourdos)\n\n27) Marine Vacth (Born 9 April 1991, Paris, France) : 'Young & Beautiful' (2013, Francois Ozon)\n\n28) Mathilde Warnier (Born 22 October 1991, Rosny-sous-Bois, France) : 'Curiosa' (2019, Lou Jeunet)\n\n29) Lola Creton (Born 16 December 1993, Paris, France) : 'Goodbye First Love' (2011, Mia Hansen-Love)\n\n30) Lou-Roy Lecollinet (Born 1 August 1996, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, Paris, France) : 'My Golden Days' (2015, Arnaud Desplechin)\n\n'Je Peux Vivre Sans Toi' - Ludivine Sagnier\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nAl Cinema : Claudia Gerini (born 18 December 1971, Rome, Italy)\n\nHaving considered who I'd nominate as the greatest French actress of this century so far, my thoughts then immediately turned to Italian cinema, and I asked myself the very same question. I fear Italian cinema is in a tough spot for a number of reasons. While there are world-renowned filmmakers in Italy like Matteo Garone, Paolo Sorrentino and Luca Guadagnino - all of whom were born during the psychedelic tumult of the counterculture years (late 1960's - early 1970's) - they are also noted for having directed significant works for television. I'm not sure this is true of their French contemporaries, so in Italy, they now seem keen to maintain a foot in each house. I'd like to see them put more focus on their filmmaking, but television is a lucrative business.\n\nItalian genre cinema has never recovered since the bottom fell out of the industry in the late 1980's. The \"peplum\" is practically defunct, the \"spaghetti western\" is a thing of the past, \"macaroni combat\" pictures are no longer made, and the \"fumetti\" has mutated beyond all recognition. The \"giallo\" crime format is continually revived but the new versions rarely reach the level of the subgenre's heyday.\n\nThe great days of \"commedia all'italiana\" are also long behind us. These comedies were replaced in the late 1980's with more calculated, family-friendly, moneymaking franchise machines developed by filmmakers like Enrico Oldoini (the 'Anni' series), Neri Parenti (the 'Natale' franchise), Christian De Sica and the late Carlo Vanzina. While I don't wish to be too down about the current state of Italian cinema (it's still streets above what we're producing in the U K at the moment), I do believe this great old film industry could benefit from a change of direction.\n\n\"My father always loved cinema, especially the films of neorealism.\"\n\n- Claudia Gerini, Italian Cinema Today\n\nSean Connery & Claudia Gerini at the American-Italian Cancer Foundation Annual Benefit Gala\n\n'Around The World (Reverse Remix)' - Daft knuP\n\nAs a result of Italy's steep decline, I firmly believe the French film industry is pretty much untouchable at this point, for the very reasons I've outlined in relation to Italy. For 125 years, the French have been making innovative, imaginative and influential works of cinema, and I don't think they've ever experienced a weak decade up to this point. They've aways excelled at making genre films because they've long believed in the Roger Corman idea of embracing cross-genre work through cross-pollination; it's in their DNA and this philosophy is taught in art schools up and down the country.\n\nI think the French film industry is a tried and trusted industry model everybody else in Europe can learn from, and arguably the strongest all-round European fim industry of cinema's first century and a quarter. Still, there's always exciting things happening in European film, and French cinema has serious competition at the moment from Germany, Greece, Spain and Sweden among others.\n\n\"Our history and our culture from the past to the present ... We have such amazing cities, beautiful land and culture, but I don't like the way our leaders are running the country. There is no organization here and too much corruption. Italy is such an amazing, incredible place and could be so much more if our leaders would just give it a chance.\"\n\n- Claudia Gerini, Italian Cinema Today\n\n\"France and Italy are like two female cousins, each of whom thinks she is the prettier.\"\n\n- Franco Venturini, Corriere Della Sera\n\nClaudia Gerini takes a break from shooting\n\n'Newjack' - Justice\n\nSomething that compounds my problematic view of Italian cinema is that I don't yet see who the next generation of potentially great actors and actresses are, or where they're coming from. So, my choice for the greatest Italian actress of the 21st century (so far) feels old school because it is. It's Claudia Gerini, who entered movies as part of the genre director Sergio Corbucci's stock company. To put this in some kind of time perspective, Corbucci died in 1990 at the age of 63, and his fellow director Sergio Leone died in 1989 at the age of 60. These two filmmakers are now widely acknowledged as being undisputed masters of the \"spaghetti western\" and Corbucci was also a master of \"commedia all'italiana\".\n\nGerini worked as a professional dancer and a showgirl in the early 1990's. This wasn't unusual for an aspiring actress during the \"era atteggiamento\" ushered in by the success of 'Drive-In', Antonio Ricci's popular television variety show which helped bring Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to power. Gerini became a member of the teenage girls' television dance academy 'Non E La Rai' at the age of 19, but the show became embroiled in scandal over its radical political allegiances and alleged exploitation of minors. Gerini sends up her dance image in the knockabout romantic comedy 'Love Is in the Air' (2012), one of three films she's made with comedy director Fausto Brizzi who often casts her to play alongside her friend and fellow actress Cristiana Capotondi.\n\n\"She is a stunning Italian superstar who sings, dances and acts. But this triple threat is a self proclaimed tomboy at heart and enjoyed a simple, normal life growing up in the suburbs of Rome. Claudia Gerini always had a desire to be in front of the camera, and knew that one day her dream would come true. That confidence along with the support of her family led her down a path that has made her a household name in Italy.\n\nGerini launched her career as a showgirl before landing her first television and movie roles. Every star has a breakout role, and for Gerini that role was in Carlo Verdone's 1995 comedy, Viaggi di nozze (Honeymoon). The film was released at Christmastime in Italy and catapulted her to fame. Verdone was so taken with Gerini's talent, that he invited her not long afterward to team up with him again in Sono pazzo di Iris Blond (Iris Blond).\n\nAlthough she has a great talent for comedy, Gerini also enjoys doing drama and has pursued that interest on both sides of the Atlantic. She played the role of Claudia in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and also had a part in Audrey Wells's Under the Tuscan Sun. But her two most high profile roles were in the Italian blockbusters, Non ti muovere (Don't Move) and Sono pazzo di Iris Blond. The films were created by two of Italy's most beloved and respected filmmakers, Verdone and Sergio Castellitto. The reach of both films extended beyond the borders of Italy and were seen by audiences around the world. Gerini's characters in these films are polar opposite, validating her skills as an actor.\"\n\n- Jeannine Guilyard, Italian Cinema Today\n\nCinzia Mascoli, Veronica Pivetti, Carlo Verdone & Claudia Gerini\n\nClaudia Gerini auditions for filmmaker Tinto Brass\n\nGerini moved to Paris to learn French and she pursued academic studies, travelling regularly between Italy and France early in her career. Back home in Italy, she studied acting at the prestigious Beatrice Bracco school ('Teatro Blu') in Rome, where her fellow students and stage performers included Stafania Rocca (born 24 April 1971, Turin, Italy) and Paola Cortellesi (born 24 November 1973, Rome, Lazio, Italy). They were looking to emulate the success of a generation of formidable Italian actresses being led by the likes of Elena Sofia Ricci (born 29 March 1962, Florence, Tuscany, Italy), Francesca Neri (born 10 February 1964, Trento, Italy), Isabella Ferrari (born 31 March 1964, Ponte dell'Olio, Emilia-Romagna, Italy), Sabrina Ferilli (born 28 June 1964, Rome, Lazio, Italy), Monica Bellucci (born 30 September 1964, Città di Castello, Umbria, Italy), Valeria Bruni Tedeschi (born 16 November 1964, Turin, Piedmont, Italy), Claudia Koll (born 17 May 1965, Rome, Lazio, Italy), Valeria Golino (born 22 October 1965, Naples, Campania, Italy) and Tosca D'Aquino (born 10 June 1966, Naples, Campania, Italy).\n\nIn France, Gerini became a member of American filmmaker Bob Swaim's stock company, allowing her to experience work in two of Europe's leading film industries. She's said in interviews that she feels this helped her improve as a performer while developing her craft, though she also credits her theatre training with making her the multi-faceted performer she is today.\n\n\"There are technical differences in acting for the theatre, TV and cinema. My theatrical experience was a very important experience for me as on the stage you have to keep up the same level of emotion, to maintain your voice and guarantee continuity in your performance; sometimes for 2 to 3 hours. All of this in front of a live audience. This is an opportunity not to be missed and is real training. The theatre is like a gym and is the ideal place to increase belief in yourself and your own acting or communicative skills. In cinema or in television, everything is done in bits and pieces; the same scene is shot various times from different angles and even the emotional part is syncopated, whereas on stage everything is or has to be a single, flowing, continuous act.\"\n\n- Claudia Gerini, Flickering Myth\n\nRicardo Scarmacio, Keanu Reeves & Claudia Gerini\n\nClaudia Gerini demonstrates her taekwondo skills on Rai\n\n-\n\nMy 14 Favourite Claudia Gerini Movies\n\n'Stuff For Rich People' (1987 - Sergio Corbucci)\n\n'Wedding Trips' (1995 - Carlo Verdone)\n\n'I'm Crazy About Iris Blond' (1996 - Carlo Verdone)\n\n'Deceit' (1999 - Claudia Florio)\n\n'Lucignolo' (1999 - Massimo Ceccherini)\n\n'Francesca And Nunziata' (2001 - Lina Wertmuller)\n\n'The Passion Of The Christ' (2004 - Mel Gibson)\n\n'The Unknown Woman' (2006 - Giuseppe Tornatore)\n\n'A Dream House Nightmare' (2007 - Federico Zampaglione)\n\n'Big, Big And ...

But until that day comes, the inimitable Claudia Gerini remains one of the only actresses to have made great Italian genre films in the 21st century, including fantasy and horror movies which is something worth celebrating. Even better, Gerini's recently completed filming her scenes for 'Diabolik' (scheduled for 2021), a follow-up to Mario Bava's comic book classic 'Danger : Diabolik' (1968), so there's hope for the \"fumetti\" yet. Long may she continue.\n\n\"I was more inspired by the typical Hitchcock female protagonist; blonde, cool and calm. I know Edwige Fenech very well as she was the producer of a film that I made about four years ago and I think that not only is she a wonderful actress but she is one of the most beautiful women that I know – even now. So, in answer to your question, my inspiration goes a little further back to more mysterious yet vulnerable actresses such as Kim Novak in Vertigo or Janet Leigh in the role of Marion Crane in Psycho.\"\n\n- Claudia Gerini, This Is Horror\n\n'Nervous (As A Girl Can Be)' - Claudia Gerini & Lele Marchitelli\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nNo Cinema : Maria De Medeiros (born 19 August 1965, Lisbon, Portugal)\n\nMy knowledge of Portuguese cinema is exceptionally poor. My list of my favourite Portuguese movies currently consists of about eight films, seven of which were directed by Manoel De Oliveira (the other was directed by the Dane Bille August). It's not entirely my fault as distribution of Portuguese films has been woeful in the U K and was virtually non-existant when I was growing up. There's also the issues of censorship, conservatism and paid studio informants that dogged the national film industry for decades, particularly during the reign of Prime Minister Antonio De Oliveira Salazar.\n\nThis year, I'm hoping to remedy this situation, so I've put together a shortlist of primary Portuguese targets I'm hoping to locate on dvd (escalating Brexit costs might put paid to this but hope springs eternal to the independent film collector). Strictly speaking, my favourite Portuguese actress of the 21st century would be Catarina Wallenstein (born 23 August 1986 - some sources say in Lisbon, Portugal, others in London, England) who's superb in De Oliveira's 'Eccentricities Of A Blonde-Haired Girl' (2009), but it's the only film I've seen her in to date.\n\n\"European cinema has an extraordinary variety. It is made in many languages, reflecting different realities because Europe is full of contrasts and very ancient cultures. There is also a system of government funding that allows directors and screenwriters to come up and make films that dare to explore other languages. To my eyes, that makes it very exciting.\"\n\n- Maria De Medeiros, Euro Channel\n\nBulle Ogier & Maria De Medeiros get their boogie on\n\nMy favourite Portuguese actress is Maria De Medeiros who's also a filmmaker and composer. I've long been a fan of hers, but that's because she's lived and worked in France, Spain and Italy over the years. She's fluent in French and has directed some of her films in France.\n\n\"You'll remember Maria de Medeiros as Bruce Willis's girlfriend in Pulp Fiction. Or as Anaïs Nin, coiled around Uma Thurman in Henry and June. She has been in dozens of other films - French, British, Canadian, Spanish and Portuguese. And earlier this year, she directed her first feature, April Captains, Portugal's most expensive film ever, which chronicles the defining moment in recent Portuguese history: the April Revolution of 1974.\n\nDe Medeiros's crime, for certain Portuguese critics, is to have treated seismic political events in a light-hearted and even flippant way. The actress-director is dismissive of such accusations. She argues that the revolution was every bit as chaotic as she portrays it: the mutineering soldiers really didn't know whether to stop their tanks at the traffic lights; they really did manage to lock themselves out of the car that had all the weapons in it; and, en route to topple dictator Marcello Caetano, they really were harassed by gays.\n\nAll this, de Medeiros insists, is a matter of historical record. It was written about by the army leaders behind the coup. She interviewed them and they confirmed the old stories. \"I would be untrue to this revolution if I didn't show the funny aspect of it,\" de Medeiros says.\"\n\n- Geoffrey Macnab, The Guardian\n\nMaria De Medeiros\n\nDe Medeiros was awarded the UNESCO Artist for Peace award in 2008, becoming the first Portuguese national to earn the distinguished title, \"Artiste de l’UNESCO\". She's very musically minded and comes from a family of classical musicians. An accomplished musician herself, she performed a concert that same March night.\n\nMaria De Medeiros isn't just a great actress - she's a great artist and a great person. I hope I can see some of her Portuguese films someday soon.\n\n\"I wouldn't define myself as the girl from Pulp Fiction.\"\n\n- Maria De Medeiros\n\nSamuel L.

Spain had one of the big four European horror film industries in the 1960s and 1970s, a position it held alongside Italy, the United Kingdom and France. However, it was the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975 that allowed Spanish cinema to find its voice on the international stage. The creative reaction in Spain was to push back boundaries and test the limits of state censorship, leading to works of subversion.\n\nThe face of Spanish cinema in recent decades has been filmmaker Pedro Almodovar and most of the country's best-known performers have passed through his stock company. Thankfully, the Spanish success story continues to this day; Spain lies at the heart of European cinema.\n\n\"Gone with the Wind is widely regarded as one of the most influential movies all time, and Macarena Gomez would agree. She considers the movie to be her favorite film and told The Actors Awards, “Scarlet O’Hara is the most powerful female character of all times.”\n\n- Camille Moore, TV Over Mind\n\nFashion designer Teresa Helbig with one of her favourite models Macarena Gomez\n\n'Aeroplane' - Petite Meller\n\nMy favourite Spanish actress of the 21st century (so far) would be Macarena Gomez. I've read that Gomez has become a household name in Spain due to her involvement in the popular soap opera 'La Que Se Avecina', which began airing in 2013. In addition to acting, she's also a professional model, a ballerina and a musician. She's one of Spain's top amateur skiers too, and can often be seen in her favourite red jumpsuits out on the slopes.\n\nGomez's contemporaries in the acting field include Penelope Cruz (born 28 April 1974, Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain), Elena Anaya (born 17 July 1975, Palencia, Castile and León, Spain), Elsa Pataky (born 18 July 1976, Madrid, Spain), Leonor Watling (born 28 July 1975, Madrid, Spain), Paz Vega (born 2 January 1976, Seville, Andalusia, Spain) and Pilar Lopez De Ayala (born 18 September 1978, Madrid, Spain).\n\n\"I had an uncle writer, my uncle Antonio Pereira, who was a little artist, was a storyteller, told stories. And my father has always been very theatrical. To such an extent that in the filming of directors who are my friends I always put my parents to make special figurations, they always have their plans. But I think it all comes because, when I was four years old, my parents pointed my sister and me to ballet classes.\n\nTo dance, I started to climb from a very young age to a stage, and I loved it. I also liked to interpret the music, the great classics that the teacher gave us. Not only did I dance to them, but I was very excited about music and played it, I lived it a lot. My teacher put me many times alone, not because of my qualities as a dancer, but because she told me I was the most theatrical of all. In addition, my parents have always instilled in me the love for art. As a child I was going to see poetry, flamenco, opera, cinema recitals ...\"\n\n- Macarena Gomez, Teller Report\n\nMacarena Gomez on the ski slopes\n\nFrom her early days, Gomez has been greatly respected by fans of science-fiction, fantasy and horror for her work in genre movies. This feeling's now stronger than ever due to her continued dedication to her craft and commitment to genre.\n\nThe Sitges Film Festival (Catalan: 'Festival Internacional de Cinema Fantàstic de Catalunya') is one of the world's foremost international festivals specialising in science-fiction, fantasy and horror films. It was established in 1968, when Spain was one of the leading contributors to gothic horror filmmaking, a tradition that continues to this day. The festival takes place annually in the coastal town of Sitges, which is about 34 kilometers away from Barcelona. Gomez is a regular attendee of the festival and has lent the event organisers her support in a myriad of ways.\n\n\"I love all genres, but in a way when I do horror it is more amusing because I feel like a kid playing a game with friends.\"\n\n- Macarena Gomez, The Actors Awards\n\nMacarena Gomez attends the High Technology Gadgetry Convention on Mont Blanc\n\n'Dynabeat' - Jain\n\nGomez works mostly in Spain though she has filmed co-productions in neighbouring France. In recent years, she's become a member of filmmaker Alex De La Iglesia's stock company which seems fitting due to his stature within horror circles. De La Iglesia's directed Gomez in 'Witching & Bitching' (2013). He's also co-produced some of her movies including Juanfer Andres & Esteban Roel's psychological horror 'Shrew's Nest' (2014) which I'm keen to see, Zoe Berriatua's crime drama 'The Heroes Of Evil' (2015), and Eduardo Casanova's surreal shocker 'Skins' (2017) which evolved from his short subject film 'Bath Time' (2014) starring Gomez. More recently, Gomez has been appearing in De La Iglesia's television series '30 Monedas'.\n\n\"Horror fans will recognise Macarena Gomez from her many iconic performances in the genre, from the mesmerizing sea priestess in Dagon to the deranged shut-in in Shrew’s Nest, and the psychotic murderess in Sexy Killer. She is known for her intense and memorable performances, but her role in The Black Gloves might be her most extreme yet. In this Hitchcock-inspired horror, Macarena plays Lorena Velasco, a formidable ballet mistress obsessed with the recovery of her troubled student.\"\n\n- Sheri White, Hellnotes\n\nMacarena Gomez & Aldo Comas\n\n-\n\n5 Macarena Gómez Movies I'd Recommend To Anybody\n\n'Dagon' (2001 - Stuart Gordon)\n\n'Romasanta : The Werewolf Hunt' (2004 - Paco Plaza)\n\n'Hot Milk' (2005 - Ricardo Bofill Maggiora)\n\n'Sexy Killer' (2008 - Miguel Marti)\n\n'Witching And Bitching' (2013 - Alex De La Iglesia)\n\n{Need to see ...

In celebration of the 125th anniversary of horror cinema, and in honour of Georges Melies' 'The House Of The Devil' (1896), I shall attempt to highlight some work by 125 different filmmakers from France, Italy, Portugal and Spain. This will be directors who were active in cinema within the period, 1896 - 2021.\n\nBy limiting entries to just 125, this means you have to think about which directors have made their mark. In some cases, they might have only made one film you enjoy, in others they may have made many, but in the spirit of the task, I'd like to consider carefully some of the great contributors to French, Italian, Portugese and Spanish cinema. Of course, any contributions on this subject from the good people of IMDB2 are greatly appreciated, and anybody posting here is obviously more than welcome to take up this challenge.\n\nFor the record, 'The House Of The Devil' was not the first film ever made, but it was an important progression into the world of \"cinema fantastique\" which combines elements of science-fiction, fantasy and horror. Melies himself went on to make 'The Haunted Castle' (1897). He also made 'A Trip To The Moon' (1902) which is the earliest science-fiction fantasy I know of.\n\n'In 1908, Camille Saint-Saëns became the first famous name to provide a score to a film. The 18-minute-long motion picture, ‘The Assassination of the Duke of Guise’, was made by a team who also encouraged well-known stage actors to perform in their films to give them some kudos. Saint-Saëns later developed his music into a concert work - the Opus 128 for strings, piano and harmonium.'\n\n- Classic FM\n\n'Danse Macabre' (1874) - Camille Saint-Saëns\n\nI should like to begin by mentioning a few milestones from the early years of film. These films and filmic inventions were among the first examples of their kind, created by photographers and filmmakers whose work we're still studying today. These experimental artists were often inventors also, and they were among the true pioneers of film.\n\n\"Dancer Johnny Hudgins is actually black, with white make-up around his lips. He is an \"aeronaut,\" from Africa, with an advanced flying machine. If you watch the whole movie 'Charleston Parade' (1927), it's progressive for it's time. Hell, it's progressive for modern America even now, as the white woman leaves with the black man to a place more civilized than war-torn France (set in the year 2028).\"\n\n- Rum Cookie on Jean Renoir's science-fiction fantasy 'Charleston Parade', Youtube\n\n'La Parade' (1896) - Maurice Ravel\n\n-\n\nFrench Film Pioneers ~ Une Douzaine De Boulanger (avec abridged wikipedia notes)\n\nLouis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre(born 18 November 1787, Cormeilles-en-Parisis, Val-d'Oise, France), better known as Louis Daguerre, was a French artist and photographer, recognized for his invention of the daguerreotype process of photography. He became known as one of the fathers of photography. Though he is most famous for his contributions to photography, he was also an accomplished painter and a developer of the diorama theatre.\n\nAntoine Claudet (born 18 August 1797, La Croix-Rousse, France) was a French photographer and artist active in London who produced daguerreotypes. Early in his career Claudet headed a glass factory at Choisy-le-Roi, Paris, together with Georges Bontemps, and moved to England to promote the factory with a shop in High Holborn, London. Having acquired a share in L. J. M. Daguerre's invention, he became one of England's first commercial photographers using the daguerreotype process for portraiture, improving the sensitizing process by using chlorine (instead of bromine) in addition to iodine, thus gaining greater rapidity of action.\n\nClaudet invented the red darkroom safelight, and it was he who suggested the idea of using a series of photographs to create the illusion of movement. The idea of using painted backdrops has also been attributed to him.\n\nPierre Jules César Janssen (born 22 February 1824, Paris, France), also known as Jules Janssen, or Julie Cesar, was a French astronomer who, along with English scientist Joseph Norman Lockyer, is credited with discovering the gaseous nature of the solar chromosphere, and with some justification the element helium.\n\nJanssen also came up with the idea for a \"revolver photographic\". This huge camera system used a Maltese cross-type mechanism, very similar to the system that would later be of great importance in the development of movie cameras. He successfully captured both transits of Venus, 1874 in Japan, that of 1882 at Oran in Algeria. The motion picture was known as Passage de Venus.\n\nÉtienne-Jules Marey (born 5 March 1830, Beaune, Côte-d'Or, France) was a French scientist, physiologist and chronophotographer. His work was significant in the development of cardiology, physical instrumentation, aviation, cinematography and the science of laboratory photography.\n\nMarey was a pioneer of photography who directly influenced the history of cinema. In 1882, he developed the Chronophotographe, which could take 12 pictures per second.\n\nLouis Le Prince (born 28 August 1841, Metz, France) was a French artist and the inventor of an early motion picture camera, possibly the first person to shoot a moving picture sequence using a single lens camera and a strip of (paper) film. Although some have credited him as the \"Father of Cinematography\", his work did not influence the commercial development of cinema — owing at least in part to the great secrecy surrounding it.\n\nA Frenchman who also worked in the United Kingdom and the United States, Le Prince's motion-picture experiments culminated in 1888 in the city of Leeds, England. In October of that year, he filmed moving-picture sequences of family members in Roundhay Garden and his son playing the accordion, using his single-lens camera and Eastman's paper negative film. At some point in the following eighteen months he also made a film of Leeds Bridge. This work may have been slightly in advance of the inventions of contemporaneous moving-picture pioneers such as the British inventors William Friese-Greene and Wordsworth Donisthorpe, and was years in advance of that of Auguste and Louis Lumière, and William Kennedy Dickson (who did the moving image work for Thomas Edison).\n\nLe Prince was never able to perform a planned public demonstration in the US because he mysteriously vanished; he was last known to be boarding a train on 16 September 1890. The reason for his disappearance is not known and his family and supporters invented a series of conspiracy theories, including: a murder set up by Edison, secret homosexuality, disappearance in order to start a new life, and a murder by his brother over their mother's will. No evidence exists for any of these and the most likely explanation remains that he committed suicide, overcome by the shame of heavy debts and the failure of his experiments.\n\nCharles-Émile Reynaud (born 8 December 1844, Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France) was a French inventor, responsible for the praxinoscope (an animation device patented in 1877 that improved on the zoetrope) and the first projected animated films. His Théâtre Optique film system, patented in 1888, is notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used.\n\nOn 28 October 1892 Reynaud gave the first public performance of a moving picture show at the Musée Grévin in Paris, the Théâtre Optique. The show, billed as Pantomimes Lumineuses, included three cartoons, Pauvre Pierrot, Un bon bock, and Le Clown et ses chiens, each consisting of 500 to 600 individually painted images and lasting about 15 minutes. The film was the first to use perforations. The performances predated Auguste and Louis Lumière's first paid public screening of the cinematographe on 26 December 1895, often seen as the birth of cinema.\n\nWilliam Kennedy Dickson (born 3 August 1860, Le Minihic-sur-Rance, Brittany, France) was a Franco-Scottish inventor who devised an early motion picture camera under the employment of Thomas Edison. Blacksmith Scene, by Dickson, is the first Kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition on May 9, 1893 and is the earliest known example of actors performing a role in a film. The Dickson Experimental Sound Film is the first known film with live-recorded sound and appears to be the first motion picture made for the Kinetophone, the proto-sound-film system developed by Dickson and Thomas Edison.\n\nHistory of the Kinetograph, Kinetoscope, and Kinetophonograph by Antonia and William Kennedy Dickson is considered the first book of history on film. It was published in 1895. In the same year, Dickson made the first hand-colored film, Annabelle Serpentine Dance.\n\nMarius Sestier (born 8 August 1861, Sauzet, Drôme, France) was a French cinematographer, best known for his work in Australia, where he shot some of the country's first films. A pharmacist by profession, Sestier was employed by early filmmakers the Lumière brothers (Auguste and Louis Lumière) to demonstrate their cinématographe abroad. In this capacity he travelled to India in June 1896, where he held a showcase of six short films made by the Lumière brothers at Watson's Hotel, Bombay on 7 July 1896; this was the first time moving pictures had been shown in India. Sestier also shot his own films while in Bombay, but the Lumière brothers rejected these for their catalogue as they were not satisfied with the quality as French customs had opened the package of undeveloped film.\n\nSestier's short subject documentary Passengers Alighting from Ferry Brighton at Manly (1896) was the first film shot and screened in Australia. Sestier, together with Australian photographer Henry Walter Barnett, made approximately 19 films in Sydney and Melbourne between October and November 1896, these being the very first films recorded in Australia. In September 1896, Sestier and Barnett opened Australia's first cinema, the Salon Lumière in Pitt Street, Sydney.\n\nVictorin-Hippolyte Jasset (born 30 March 1862, Fumay, Ardennes, France) was an early film pioneer in France, active between the years 1905 and 1913. He worked on many genres of film and was particularly associated with the development of detective or crime serials, such as the Nick Carter (possibly the first in history) and Zigomar series.\n\nThe most immediate influence of Jasset's work was seen in the films of Louis Feuillade, who was working at the Gaumont Film Company and took the film serial to new heights with Fantômas (1913–14), Les Vampires (1915–16) and Judex (1916). These variously developed the roles of the resourceful detective, the master-criminal, and the mysterious woman of action who had previously appeared in Jasset's Nick Carter, Zigomar and Protéa films.\n\nThe Lumière brothers were Auguste Lumière (born 19 October 1862, Besançon, France) and Louis Lumière (born 5 October 1864, Besançon, France). They were manufacturers of photography equipment, best known for their Cinématographe motion picture system and the short films they produced between 1895 and 1905. Their screening of a single film on 22 March 1895 for around 200 members of the \"Society for the Development of the National Industry\" in Paris was probably the first presentation of projected film. Their first commercial public screening on 28 December 1895 for around 40 paying visitors and invited relations has traditionally been regarded as the birth of cinema, although it had in fact been preceded by paying shows to thousands of people in the USA and Germany.\n\nL'Arroseur Arrosé (also known as The Waterer Watered and The Sprinkler Sprinkled) is an 1895 French short black-and-white silent comedy film directed and produced by Louis Lumière and starring François Clerc and Benoît Duval. It was first screened on June 10, 1895. It is the earliest known instance of film comedy, the first use of film to portray a fictional story, and the first use of a promotional film poster. The film was originally known as Le Jardinier (\"The Gardener\") or Le Jardinier et le petit espiègle, and is sometimes referred to in English as The Tables Turned on the Gardener, and The Sprinkler Sprinkled.\n\nMichel-Antoine Carré (born 7 February 1865, Paris, France) was a French actor, stage and film director, and writer of opera librettos, stage plays and film scripts. He was the son of the librettist Michel Carré (père) (1821–1872) and cousin of the theatre director Albert Carré (his father's nephew). His libretto for André Messager's 1894 opera Mirette was never performed in France but was performed in an English adaptation in London at the Savoy Theatre.\n\nL'Enfant prodigue (\"The Prodigal Son\") was the first feature-length motion picture produced in Europe, running 90 minutes. Directed by Michel Carré, from his own three-act stage pantomime, the film was basically an unmodified, filmed record of his play. It was filmed at the Gaumont Film Company studios in May 1907 and the movie premiered at the Théâtre des Variétés on the Boulevard Montmartre, in Paris, on 20 June 1907.\n\nFerdinand Zecca (born 19 February 1864, Paris, France) was a pioneer French film director, film producer, actor and screenwriter. He worked primarily for the Pathé company, first in artistic endeavors then in administration of the internationally based company.\n\nZecca's Histoire d'un crime (1901), stylistically innovative in its use of superimposition, was the first film to use flashbacks to create a non-linear narrative. Zecca explored many themes from the mundane to the fantastic. In À la conquête de l'air (1901), a strange flying machine, called Fend-l'air, was seen flying over the rooftops of Belleville. By using trick photography, the one-minute short was notable in being the first aviation film, predating the flight by the Wright Brothers by two years.\n\nAlice Guy-Blaché (born 1 July 1873, Saint-Mandé, Val-de-Marne, France) was a French pioneer filmmaker, active from the late 19th century, and one of the first to make a narrative fiction film. She was the first woman to direct a film. From 1896 to 1906, she was probably the only female filmmaker in the world. She experimented with Gaumont's Chronophone sync-sound system, and with color-tinting, interracial casting, and special effects.\n\nIn 1896, Guy-Blaché directed La Fée aux Choux (The Fairy of the Cabbages) which is significant in the history of cinema. The Cabbage Fairy is often acknowledged as the first narrative fiction film. This movie is also credited as having introduced screenplays for the first time.\n\nIn 1912, Guy-Blaché made the film A Fool and His Money, probably the first to have an all-African-American cast. The film is now at the National Center for Film and Video Preservation at the American Film Institute.\n\n'Images' (1901 - 1905) - Claude Debussy\n\n-\n\nSilent Films\n\nITALY\n\n'Dante's Inferno' (1911, L'Inferno - Giuseppe De Liguoro)\n\n'Homer's Odyssey' (1911, L'Odissea - Adolfo Padovan)\n\n'The Fire' (1916, Il fuoco - Giovanni Pastrone)\n\n'Ashes' (1917, Cenere - Febo Mari)\n\n'Bad Shade' (1917, Malombra - Carmine Gallone)\n\n'Satan’s Rhapsody' (1917, Rapsodia satanica – Nino Oxilia)\n\n'Thais' (1917, Thaïs - Anton Giulio Bragaglia)\n\n'Caina' (1922, Cainà, L'isola e il continente - Gennaro Righelli)\n\n'Maciste In Hell' (1925, Maciste all'inferno - Guido Brignone)\n\n'Rails' (1929, Rotaie - Mario Camerini)\n\nFRANCE\n\n'The Heart And The Money' (1912, Le Cœur et l'Argent – Louis Feuillade & Leonce Perret)\n\n'The Mystery Of The Kador Cliffs' (1912, Le mystère des roches de Kador - Leonce Perret)\n\n'The Child Of Paris' (1913, L'enfant de Paris - Leonce Perret)\n\n'War Is Hell' (1914, Maudite soit la guerre – Alfred Machin)\n\n'Alsace' (1916, Alsace - Henri Pouctal)\n\n'The Deadly Gases' (1916, Les gaz mortels - Abel Gance)\n\n'I, Accuse' (1919, J'accuse - Abel Gance)\n\n'The Flood' (1924, L'inondation - Louis Delluc)\n\n'The Inhuman Woman' (1924, L'inhumaine - Marcel L'Herbier)\n\n'The Swallow And The Titmouse' (1924, L'Hirondelle et la Mésange – Andre Antoine)\n\n'The Phantom Of The Moulin-Rouge' (1925, Le fantôme du Moulin-Rouge - Rene Clair)\n\n'The Imaginary Voyage' (1926, Le voyage imaginaire - Rene Clair)\n\n'Nana' (1926, Nana - Jean Renoir)\n\n'Napoleon' (1927, Napoléon - Abel Gance)\n\n'Misdeal' (1928, Maldone - Jean Gremillon)\n\n'Verdun' (1928, Verdun, visions d'histoire - Leon Poirier)\n\n'Saint Joan The Maid' (1929, La merveilleuse vie de Jeanne d'Arc - Marco De Gastyne)\n\n'The Woman And The Puppet' (1929, La femme et le pantin - Jacques De Baroncelli)\n\n'Ladies' Paradise' (1930, Au bonheur des dames - Julien Duvivier)\n\nPORTUGAL\n\n'Maria Do Mar' (1930, Maria do Mar - Jose Leitao De Barros)\n\n'Tendresse' (1896, from 'Dolly Suite') ~ Gabriel Fauré\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nSilent Cinema ~ Short Subject Films\n\nShort subject films were a cornerstone of silent film production in Europe in the early 20th century. American filmmaker Martin Scorsese has written about the work of Italy's silent film pioneers and how they established some of the conventions of epic historical cinema through their work. All the Italian silent films I've enjoyed to date have been feature-length, so I feel I understand where Scorsese's coming from. With Spain, it's been the reverse for me, as the silent movies I've enjoyed most from Spanish directors have been short subject films. I've only seen one silent film from Portugal, though fortunately, it's one that's considered to be among the nation's greatest feature films.\n\n'Gabrielle Rejane was widely regarded as the embodiment of the Parisienne, and when she died in 1920, Le Figaro said that Paris had lost its soul.'\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nGabrielle Rejane\n\nI think it's important for me to note that I'm attempting to highlight the contributions of 125 filmmakers, as well as a selection of silent films (long and short), all of which I believe are the work of directors born in France, Italy, Portugal or Spain. I've imposed these strict boundaries upon myself in order to hopefully make the task at hand a little easier.\n\nI'd also like to highlight the work of a few other filmmakers along the way, filmmakers who I feel have contributed greatly to these four national film industries. This is particularly the case with France, where American visual artist Man Ray, Polish filmic experimentalist Jean Epstein and avant-garde Estonian director Dimitri Kirsanoff completed some of their most influential work during the silent film era; celebrated American film critic Pauline Kael once wrote that Kirsanoff's silent French film 'Menilmontant' (1926) was her favourite film of all time. Filmmaker Leonide Moguy, who worked successfully in France, America and Italy, was born in Odessa, Ukraine; Quentin Tarantino named a character after Moguy in his Italian-inspired, revisionist western tribute, 'Django Unchained' (2012).\n\n\"For over ten years (1882-1895), The Incoherents took up a format of a hybrid cabaret and salon, and the happenings of the group fell somewhere between free artistic expression and public entertainment. Artworks created by the group were parodies of famous pieces of art, political and social satire, costume balls, graphical puns, and monographic paintings directly mocking the Impressionists. Cleverly curated locations contributed to the success of these humorous exhibition-demonstrations and were meant to rebel against the seriousness and boredom of popular events and popular sentiments of the time. Additionally, The Incoherents self published catalogues, fictional artist statements, and created well-orchestrated advertising campaigns using newspapers, flyers, and personal invitations to promote their happenings, and they even donated proceeds from their admission fees to charity. De-professionalization was one of the major characteristics of The Incoherents, whereby painters might take up writing, exhibitions of drawing would be launched by those who couldn’t draw, and architects might become financial analysts. Absurdity and provocation were the driving mission of the group.\n\nMoreover, Les Arts Incoérents introduced the usefulness of satire, humor, and political provocation within cultural production, acting as precursors to the avant-garde cabarets of the early 20th century and the performative interventions of Surrealism and Dada, and could be said were early influencers to movements like Fluxus. Their theaters of conversation and exchange, or cabarets, played a critical role in the emergence of what philosopher Jürgen Habermas termed the, “public sphere” which emerged in “cultural-political contras” to court society.\"\n\n- Arden Sherman, curator at the Hunter East Harlem Gallery in New York\n\n1896 - 1900 : A Trip Through Paris (speed corrected with added sound)\n\nThe film industry writ large in the United States of America developed a similar philosophy to France as the two nations competed in a cinematic arms race, breaking one barrier after another in the process. These nations were keen collaborators too. French artist Fernand Leger travelled to America where he developed the groundbreaking experimental film 'Mechanical Ballet' (1924) in collaboration with photographer Man Ray and American director Dudley Murphy. French filmmaker Henry De La Falaise also found work in America where he married Gloria Swanson in the 1920s and Constance Bennett in the 1930s, two of the great stars of Hollywood's Golden Age.\n\nFor horror fans, there's a couple of great examples of this artistic migration that strike right at the heart of the sound revolution. French director Marcel Varnel co-directed 'Chandu The Magician' (1932) with American production designer William Cameron Menzies, before relocating to the United Kingdom where he became a leading industry figure in the 1930s. French director Robert Florey made 'Murders In The Rue Morgue' (1932) in America, one of the first great film adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe's writings to utilise sound. Jean Epstein had already directed one of the great silent Poe adaptations in France, 'The Fall Of The House Of Usher' (1928), working from a screenplay he'd co-written with Spanish filmmaker Luis Bunuel; French filmmaker Abel Gance took an acting role in 'The Fall Of The House Of Usher'. Florey remained in America where he went on to become an in-house director at Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nOn a sidenote, Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi starred in both 'Chandu The Magician' and 'Murders In The Rue Morgue'. Lugosi's considered an icon of international cinema in France and is honoured for his genre work at the Vampire Museum (Le Musée des Vampires) in Paris, a historic arts venue widely regarded as being one of the creepiest museums in the world.\n\n\"Dada was a provocative and irreverent art movement, founded in Switzerland in the early 20th century, in which a seemingly chaotic, spontaneous, and pessimistic aesthetic influenced painting, sculpture, theater, literature, and film. The movement’s name is a willfully nonsensical word, intended to punctuate the meaninglessness artists saw in their contemporaneous worldview. Dada filmmakers such as Hans Richter, Man Ray, and Viking Eggeling were challenged by the developing technology of filmmaking in the 1920s. This confluence of technology and aesthetic experimentation suited the Dadaists’ passion for the machine-made object. The visual disruption created by the Dada filmmakers in the 1920s provided a legacy of aesthetic language for the cinematic experiments of future generations of avant-garde artists.\"\n\n- Anna Morra, curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York\n\n1927 : A Trip Through The Streets Of Paris (speed corrected with added sound)\n\n-\n\nSilent Short Subject Films\n\nFRANCE\n\n# All surviving and available works by Georges Melies\n\n## Serials : 'Fantomas' (1913 - 1914, Fantômas) & 'The Vampires' (1915 - 1916, Les Vampires) by Louis Feuillade\n\n'The Consequences Of Feminism' (1906, Les Résultats du féminisme - Alice Guy-Blache)\n\n'The Life Of Moliere' (1909, Molière - Leonce Perret)\n\n'The Hunchback Of Notre Dame' (1911, Notre-Dame de Paris - Albert Capellani)\n\n'Rigadin And The Lady Doctor' (1911, Rigadin et la doctoresse - Georges Monca)\n\n'The Man With Wax Faces' (1914, Figures de cire - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n'Max And The Lady Doctor' (1914, Max et la doctoresse - Max Linder)\n\n'The Doctor's Madness Tube' (1915, La folie du Docteur Tube - Abel Gance)\n\n'Intermission' (1924, Entr'acte - Rene Clair)\n\n'Games Of Reflections And Speed' (1925, Jeux des reflets et de la vitesse - Henri Chomette)\n\n'Anemic Cinema' (1926, Anémic Cinéma - Marcel Duchamp)\n\n'Charleston Parade' (1927, Sur un air de Charleston - Jean Renoir)\n\n'The Seashell And The Clergyman' (1928, La Coquille et le clergyman - Germaine Dulac)\n\n'About Nice' (1930, À Propos de Nice - Jean Vigo)\n\nITALY\n\n# All surviving and available works by Elvira Notari\n\nSPAIN\n\n# All surviving and available works by Segundo De Chomon\n\n'An Andalusian Dog' (1929, Un Chien Andalou - Luis Bunuel)\n\nBrazilian multi-instrumentalist Dom La Nena performs at the PORTA World Music Festival in Riga, Latvia (La Nena has sung in French, Italian, Portugese & Spanish in person and on record)\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\n125 Filmmakers [1 - 5]\n\n\"When I happen to go to the movies in America, I go see “B” pictures.

Maurice Tourneur (born 2 February 1876, Paris, France)\n\nThe first director I've chosen is Maurice Tourneur whose career in cinema covers the evolution of the cinematic form itself. In the 1900s, Tourneur was a member of a touring theatre company that included actress Gabrielle Rejane. He became an assistant director at Laboratoires Eclair, a film laboratory and camera manufacturing company established in Épinay-sur-Seine, France by Charles Jourjon in 1907. He started making experimental films with a small company of artists, including music hall performer Polaire. Tourneur was so gifted behind the camera, he was offered an opportunity to work in America, and he departed France with several trusted colleagues in tow, taking up a senior position at Eclair's newly opened American studio branch in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\nIt was during his time in America that Tourneur directed some of the great motion pictures of the silent movie era. He frequently collaborated with Canadian actress Mary Pickford, a devout Catholic who became known as \"America's sweetheart\". His films 'The Poor Little Rich Girl' (1917), 'The Blue Bird' (1918) and 'The Last Of The Mohicans' (1920) have all been deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. He returned to France in the late 1920s where he directed 'The Crew' (1928) with American actress Claire de Lorez.\n\nTRIVIA : Maurice Tourneur's son, Jacques Tourneur, studied filmmaking under the strict tutelage of his father from an early age. Jacques was recruited in America by film producer Val Lewton to direct a series of lurid horror fantasies for RKO Studios. Trained as an editor, Jacques joined with Canadian editor-turned-director Mark Robson and American editor-turned-director Robert Wise to create a revolution in genre cinema, rewriting some of the cinematic rules his father had helped draw up during the silent era.\n\nSelected Maurice Tourneur Films [9]\n\n01) 'The Poor Little Rich Girl' (1917 - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n02) 'The Pride Of The Clan' (1917 - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n03) 'The Blue Bird' (1918 - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n04) 'The Last Of The Mohicans' (1920 - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n05) 'Lorna Doone' (1922 - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n06) 'The Mysterious Island' (1929 - Lucien Hubbard; incorporates footage shot in 1926 and 1927 by Maurice Tourneur and Benjamin Christensen respectively)\n\n07) 'The Ship Of Lost Souls' (1929, Das Schiff der verlorenen Menschen - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n08) 'The Devil's Hand' (1943, La Main du diable - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n09) 'Dilemma Of Two Angels' (1948, Impasse des deux anges - Maurice Tourneur)\n\n'Phèdre, suite symphonique' - Georges Auric\n\n- - - - -\n\n02. Jean Cocteau (born 5 July 1889, Maisons-Laffitte, France)\n\nJean Cocteau was a poet, playwright, diarist and novelist. He was also a gifted artist and a man hellbent on experimentation. He was a paying regular at Le Boeuf sur le Toit (The Ox on the Roof) throughout the 1920s, a Parisian cabaret bar whose clientele's creations were woven into the fabric of the city's avant-garde arts scene. The first two surrealist manifestos by Yvan Goll and André Breton were published in 1924, by which point Cocteau had become one of the most influential figures in the arts. He turned to filmmaking in 1930, utilising the camera to convey broken shards of his own drawings and writings.\n\nTRIVIA : Jean Cocteau died a day after the death of one of his closest friends and collaborators, chanteuse Édith Piaf, for whom he wrote the play 'The Beautiful Indifferent' (1940, Le Bel Indifférent).\n\nSelected Jean Cocteau Films [4]\n\n01) 'The Blood Of A Poet' (1932, Le sang d'un poète - Jean Cocteau)\n\n02) 'Beauty And The Beast' (1946, La Belle et la Bête - Jean Cocteau)\n\n03) 'Orpheus' (1950, Orphée - Jean Cocteau)\n\n04) 'Testament Of Orpheus' (1960, Le testament d'Orphée - Jean Cocteau)\n\n'Romance sans parole op. 21' - Louis Durey\n\n- - - - -\n\n03. Jean Renoir (born 15 September 1894, Paris, France)\n\nJean Renoir is my favourite French filmmaker from the era that's come to be known as \"the Golden Age of Cinema\". His parents were impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and artist's model Aline Charigot, who's the subject of some of Pierre-Auguste's paintings. His brother was actor Pierre Renoir.\n\nJean married actress and model Catherine Hessling in 1920. Hessling had been working as a live model for Pierre-Auguste on the recommendation of painter Henri Matisse. Hessling was Jean's artistic muse and she appeared in many of the films he directed during the silent era.\n\nRenoir's technical skill and virtuosity enabled him to make a smooth transition to shooting motion pictures with sound. He worked successfully in America during World War 2, and though he later returned to France for work purposes, America became his home. He received an honorary Lifetime Achievement Oscar in 1975 from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for contributions made to the motion picture industry.\n\nTRIVIA : Jean Renoir's nephew, Claude Renoir, was a cinematographer.\n\nSelected Jean Renoir Films [19]\n\n01) 'Nana' (1926, Nana - Jean Renoir)\n\n02) 'The Bitch' (1931, La Chienne - Jean Renoir)\n\n03) 'Boudu Saved From Drowning' (1932, Boudu sauvé des eaux - Jean Renoir)\n\n04) 'Toni' (1935, Toni - Jean Renoir)\n\n05) 'The Crime Of Monsieur Lange' (1936, Le Crime de Monsieur Lange - Jean Renoir)\n\n06) 'A Day In The Country' (1936, Partie de campagne [Unfinished] - Jean Renoir)\n\n07) 'Grand Illusion' (1937, La grande illusion - Jean Renoir)\n\n08) 'The Human Beast' (1938, La bête humaine - Jean Renoir)\n\n09) 'La Marseillaise' (1938, La Marseillaise - Jean Renoir)\n\n10) 'The Rules Of The Game' (1939, La Règle du jeu - Jean Renoir)\n\n11) 'Swamp Water' (1941 - Jean Renoir)\n\n12) 'This Land Is Mine' (1943 - Jean Renoir)\n\n13) 'The Southerner' (1945 - Jean Renoir)\n\n14) 'The Diary Of A Chambermaid' (1946 - Jean Renoir)\n\n15) 'The Woman On The Beach' (1947 - Jean Renoir)\n\n16) 'The River' (1951, Le Fleuve - Jean Renoir)\n\n17) 'French Cancan' (1954, French Cancan - Jean Renoir)\n\n18) 'The Testament Of Dr. Cordelier' (1958, Le Testament du docteur Cordelier - Jean Renoir)\n\n19) 'Picnic On The Grass' (1959, Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe - Jean Renoir)\n\n'Milhaud : Le Boeuf sur le toit' - Darius Milhaud\n\n- - - - -\n\n04. Julien Duvivier (born 8 October 1896, Lille, France)\n\nJulien Duvivier worked at the Gaumont Film Company in the 1920s where he came under the influence of filmmakers like André Antoine, Louis Feuillade and Marcel L'Herbier. This training ground proved crucial to the development of his skills as a working director. He first worked with Jean Gabin on 'Maria Chapdelaine' (1934) and this proved to be the first of many collaborations between director and actor.\n\nJean Renoir was one of Julien Duvivier's greatest admirers and both directors worked successfully in America during the 2nd World War. While I've seen a great deal of Renoir's creative output, I've not been able to see nearly as much of Duvivier's work, but as with Renoir, I can see Duvivier was clearly a great technician. Renoir described Duvivier as a \"great poet\", and he was one of the pioneers of an artistic movement that came to be known as \"poetic realism\" within French cinema. His films I've been lucky enough to see have been drenched in poetic imagery.\n\nSelected Julien Duvivier Films [6]\n\n01) 'Ladies' Paradise' (1930, Au bonheur des dames - Julien Duvivier)\n\n02) 'Life Dances On' (1937, Un carnet de bal – Julien Duvivier)\n\n03) 'Pepe Le Moko' (1937, Pépé le Moko - Julien Duvivier)\n\n04) 'The Great Waltz' (1938 - Julien Duvivier, Victor Fleming [uncredited] & Josef Von Sternberg [uncredited])\n\n05) 'Flesh And Fantasy' (1943 - Julien Duvivier)\n\n06) Under The Sky Of Paris (1951, Sous le ciel de Paris – Julien Duvivier)\n\n'Concerto pour piano' - Francis Poulenc\n\n- - - - -\n\n05. René Clair (born 11 November 1898, Paris, France)\n\nAvant-garde filmmaker René Clair studied philosophy before entering cinema. It's often joked that he never left silent cinema behind, a thought reinforced by the words of film theorist André Bazin who considered Clair to be a silent filmmaker first and foremost. As such, I think his finest work in talkies came about when he worked in the comedy and fantasy genres, where he could use words for their humour, musicality and rhythm. In general, I think of Clair as being one of cinema's great comic fantasists.\n\nLike Jean Renoir and Julien Duvivier, Clair worked successfully in America during the 2nd World War, having enjoyed a short stint in the United Kingdom in the mid-1930s. It was during the 1940s that Jean Cocteau mounted a tribute to Rene Clair's supernatural fantasy 'I Married A Witch' (1942) at Théâtre de la Mode (Theatre of Fashion), a touring exhibit of mannequins.\n\nSelected René Clair Films [10]\n\n01) 'The Phantom Of The Moulin-Rouge' (1925, Le fantôme du Moulin-Rouge - Rene Clair)\n\n02) 'The Imaginary Voyage' (1926, Le voyage imaginaire – Rene Clair)\n\n03) 'Freedom For Us' (1931, À Nous la Liberté - Rene Clair)\n\n04) 'The Million' (1931, Le Million - Rene Clair)\n\n05) 'July 14' (1933, Quatorze Juillet – Rene Clair)\n\n06) 'The Ghost Goes West' (1935 – Rene Clair)\n\n07) 'I Married A Witch' (1942 – Rene Clair)\n\n08) 'It Happened Tomorrow' (1944 – Rene Clair)\n\n09) 'And Then There Were None' (1945 – Rene Clair)\n\n10) 'Beauty And The Devil' (1950, La Beauté du diable – Rene Clair)\n\n'Petite suite pour orchestre' - Germaine Tailleferre\n\n- - - - -\n\n# Entrer : Voyage De L'Imagination\n\n“Listen carefully to first criticisms made of your work.

Luis Buñuel (born 22 February 1900, Calanda, Aragon, Spain)\n\nLuis Bunuel is my favourite filmmaker. He's sometimes referred to as \"the Godfather of Surrealist Cinema\", due to his roots in avant-garde film. He was a meticulous craftsman and exacting technician who was able to shoot films very quickly as he mapped everything out in advance. He learnt to shoot economically while working as a hired hand in the Mexican film industry, where conditions were often tough and budgets were often small.\n\nDuring the 2nd World War, Bunuel took up a position at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where he edited documentaries. He worked on the development of Robert Florey's horror movie 'The Beast With Five Fingers' (1946) and might have become a dedicated horror filmmaker, but his ties to radical left-wing political organisations may have hastened his departure for Mexico.\n\nBunuel shot movies in Spain, France, Mexico and America. During an involving film career that stretched across six decades, he was strongly denounced by the Catholic Church (the institution officially condemned many of his films), exiled from his homeland, and investigated for suspect political activities in more than one country. Despite these obstacles, he never stopped making films.\n\nTRIVIA : One of Luis Bunuel's sons with gymnast Jeanne Rucar Lefebvre, Juan Luis Buñuel, also became a filmmaker.\n\nSelected Luis Buñuel Films (22)\n\n01) 'The Golden Age' (1930, L'Age d'Or - Luis Bunuel)\n\n02) 'The Great Madcap' (1949, El Gran Calavera - Luis Bunuel)\n\n03) 'The Forgotten' (1950, Los Olvidados - Luis Bunuel)\n\n04) 'Susana' (1951, Susana, demonio y carne - Luis Bunuel)\n\n05) 'Ascent To Heaven' (1952, Subida al cielo - Luis Bunuel)\n\n06) 'The Brute' (1953, El Bruto - Luis Bunuel)\n\n07) 'El' (1953, Él - Luis Bunuel)\n\n08) 'Illusion Travels By Streetcar' (1953, La ilusión viaja en tranvía - Luis Bunuel)\n\n09) 'The Criminal Life Of Archibaldo De La Cruz' (1955, Ensayo de un crimen - Luis Bunuel)\n\n10) 'Death In The Garden' (1956, La mort en ce jardin - Luis Bunuel)\n\n11) 'Nazarin' (1959, Nazarín - Luis Bunuel)\n\n12) 'The Young One' (1960, La joven - Luis Bunuel)\n\n13) 'Viridiana' (1961, Viridiana - Luis Bunuel)\n\n14) 'The Exterminating Angel' (1962, El ángel exterminador - Luis Bunuel)\n\n15) 'The Diary Of A Chambermaid' (1964, Le journal d'une femme de chambre - Luis Bunuel)\n\n16) 'Simon Of The Desert' (1965, Simón del desierto - Luis Bunuel)\n\n17) 'Belle De Jour' (1967, Belle de Jour - Luis Bunuel)\n\n18) 'The Milky Way' (1969, La Voie lactée - Luis Bunuel)\n\n19) 'Tristana' (1970, Tristana - Luis Bunuel)\n\n20) 'The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie' (1972, Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie - Luis Bunuel)\n\n21) 'The Phantom Of Liberty' (1974, Le Fantôme de la liberté - Luis Bunuel)\n\n22) 'That Obscure Object Of Desire' (1977, Cet obscur objet du désir - Luis Bunuel)\n\n- - - - -\n\n07. Vittorio De Sica (born 7 July 1901, Sora, Lazio, Kingdom of Italy)\n\nIn the 1920s, Vittorio De Sica was a member of a theatre company led by Ukrainian acting teacher Tatyana Pavlova in Rome. In the 1930s, he co-founded a theatre company with Italian playwright Sergio Tofano. De Sica observed the emergence of \"poetic realism\" in French cinema first-hand, before becoming the wildcard in Italy's \"neorealist\" film movement of the 1940s. Unlike several leading directors associated with the development of neorealism, I don't think De Sica was a working writer for the film publication 'Cinema', though he may have contributed articles.\n\nDe Sica came from a working-class family and he understood poverty well. He brought his own childhood experiences to his filmmaking, etching everyday portraits of urban life that were said to be unlike anything in cinema before. His seamless shot constructions led Orson Welles to express deep envy at what he saw as the most masterly of invisible hands. De Sica's natural ability for filmic storytelling appeared at second glimpse to be as effortless and intuitive as his acting style and he became one of Italy's foremost chroniclers of daily life, putting all ages under a microscopic lens, be it embattled street kids, warring middle-aged couples, or the elderly stuck in stark isolation. His films are living, breathing documents of Italian life.\n\nTRIVIA : Vittorio De Sica's son Manuel De Sica, with Spanish actress María Mercader, became a composer. The couple's other son, Christian De Sica, is a singer and film director and one of the biggest superstars working in Italian cinema today.\n\nSelected Vittorio De Sica Films (13)\n\n01) 'Shoeshine' (1946, Sciuscià - Vittorio De Sica)\n\n02) 'The Bicycle Thief' (1948, Ladri di biciclette - Vittorio De Sica)\n\n03) 'Miracle In Milan' (1951, Miracolo a Milano - Vittorio De Sica)\n\n04) 'Umberto D.'

Robert Bresson (born 25 September 1901, Bromont-Lamothe, France)\n\nRobert Bresson was a painter, philosopher and devout Catholic filmmaker who rejected the established tenets of photographic storytelling in a spiritual quest for on-screen naturalism. I think his work defines the very idea of what's come to be thought of as \"arthouse cinema\", and is probably an acquired taste. Personally, I really like some of his films, others less so.\n\nBresson was an interesting and somewhat mysterious figure in real life. He was interned in a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. His experiences during wartime might have inspired his decision to step away from conventional narrative filmmaking (relatively speaking). Instead, he crafted slow, methodical ruminations on human nature and it's these films that brought him to international prominence. Consequence is often at the heart of Bresson's work and he could extract tension from the most mundane action or circumstance imaginable.\n\nSelected Robert Bresson Films (5)\n\n01) 'The Ladies Of The Bois De Boulogne' (1945, Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne - Robert Bresson)\n\n02) 'Diary Of A Country Priest' (1951, Journal d'un curé de campagne - Robert Bresson)\n\n03) 'A Man Escaped' (1956, Un condamné à mort s'est échappé ou Le vent souffle où il veut - Robert Bresson)\n\n04) 'Balthazar' (1966, Au Hasard Balthazar - Robert Bresson)\n\n05) 'Mouchette' (1967, Mouchette - Robert Bresson)\n\n- - - - -\n\n09. Roberto Rosselini (born 8 May 1906, Rome, Lazio, Kingdom of Italy)\n\nItalian filmmaker Roberto Rosselini was a dedicated filmgoer in his youth. He fulfilled a number of technical roles within the national film industry before he began directing short subject films in the mid-1930s. This experience gave him a good grounding in the mechanics of film. His \"neorealist\" war trilogy of the 1940s was shot amidst the rubble of fallen Italian cities and the atmosphere is palpable.\n\nTRIVIA : Roberto Rosselini's son Renzo Rossellini, with costume designer Marcella de Marchis, became a film producer.

Jacques Becker (born 15 September 1906, Paris, France)\n\nFilmmaker Jacques Becker served a long apprenticeship under Jean Renoir in the 1930s. Having worked as an assistant director on many of Renoir's films, Becker was handed an opportunity to direct his first full-length feature in 1939, but the outbreak of the 2nd World War complicated matters. Becker was arrested, detained and held in a prisoner-of-war camp. Upon his release, he began working with members of the French Resistance in occupied France, a militarised anti-Nazi movement, which was a particularly dangerous position to be taking up within the arts. His experiences during wartime are reflected upon in some of his films, notably 'The Hole' (1960).\n\nBecker made movies in a variety of genres and he was comfortable working on large-scale studio projects. His friendship with Renoir is said to have been built upon their shared passion for art and jazz music, but both men were also interested in fashion design (Becker's mother managed a fashion house in Paris when he was young). The costumes in Becker's films were immaculate, whether he was dressing a peasant, a pauper or a royal subject. His post-war picture 'Paris Frills' (1945) is set within the world of high fashion.\n\nTRIVIA : Jacques Becker's son Jean Becker, with Geneviève Boyard, became a filmmaker.

Jacques Tati (born 9 October 1907, Le Pecq, France)\n\nThere are different schools of comedy in France and you'll find many active comedy troupes at any one given time. In the silent movie era, Charles Prince and Max Linder reigned at the box-office as French cinema's slapstick kings supreme. In the case of Jacques Tati, however, he seems to have always stood alone, with feet far apart. Tati's work influenced a generation of French comics who were younger than him, including some of those he worked with, such as mime Marcel Marceau, and clown Pierre Étaix.\n\nTati made short films in the 1930s. He became a clown-for-hire in the 1940s, though he was always selective in his roles. He was considered for a part in Marcel Carne's 'Children Of Paradise' (1945), though the role went to the right performer as mime Jean-Louis Barrault had worked on several projects with Carne in the past. Tati waited patiently for the opportunity to direct his own feature-length film and he was able to expand upon ideas conceived through his theatre work and short subject films with his debut feature, 'The Big Day' (1949), which drew heavily from his recent comedy short 'The School For Postmen' (1947).\n\nTRIVIA : Artist and filmmaker David Lynch is a leading voice on the work of Jacques Tati, whom he once described as being some kind of \"kindred soul\".\n\nSelected Jacques Tati Films (4)\n\n01) 'The Big Day' (1949, Jour de fête - Jacques Tati)\n\n02) 'Monsieur Hulot's Holiday' (1953, Les Vacances de M.

Henri-Georges Clouzot (born 20 November 1907, Niort, France)\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot is considered by some film commentators to be French sound cinema's first true \"Master of Suspense\", which is interesting as it's been well documented that \"Master of Suspense\" Alfred Hitchcock considered Clouzot to be one of his few serious cinematic rivals. Like Hitchcock, Clouzot was indebted to the \"German expressionism\" film movement of the 1920s. Clouzot lived in Germany in the early 1930s, before moving on to Switzerland, and then returing to France at the end of the decade.\n\nThe creative work of German film directors Robert Wiene, Paul Leni, F.W. Murnau, John Brahm, William Dieterle and Robert Siodmak would leave a lasting impression on Clouzot as he gradually developed his own filmmaking career. The same was true of Austrian directors like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder and Fred Zinnemann, as well as Czech-Austrian director Edgar G. Ulmer. Some of these men had worked under Max Reinhardt in the theatres of Vienna. Reinhardt was a direct influence upon the look and development of expressionist film. Although Ulmer claimed to have lived and worked in Germany in the early 1920s, the body of evidence supports the idea that his induction into film came later in the decade when he took up a position under early mentor Murnau who'd moved on to Hollywood. Ulmer was said to have originally cut his creative cloth as a part of Reinhardt's theatre troupe. So, it's complicated tracing the path of just one of these great directors, but there was undoubtedly a wider Central European arts community with a strong regional bond, and I think this is something that tied all these talents together.\n\nI mention all this because almost all of these men became celluloid crime specialists and so did Clouzot. I feel this is in part because their collective visual sense was dark and captured the psychological bonds and complexities of the criminal character perfectly. The shadows and suggestiveness of expressionist visuals lent themselves particularly well to manifesting the darkest recesses of the criminal mind, especially in the days of strict film censorship. Clouzot's works came to characterise something about Europe's immediate post-war gloom and it was no surprise when he found himself being temporarily banned from making films in the aftermath of the 2nd World War.\n\nSelected Henri-Georges Clouzot Films (5)\n\n01) 'The Murderer Lives At Number 21' (1942, L'Assassin habite au 21 - Henri-Georges Clouzot)\n\n02) 'The Raven' (1943, Le Corbeau - Henri-Georges Clouzot)\n\n03) 'Jenny Lamour' (1947, Quai des Orfèvres - Henri-Georges Clouzot)\n\n04) 'The Wages Of Fear' (1953, Le Salaire de la peur - Henri-Georges Clouzot)\n\n05) 'Diabolique' (1955, Les Diaboliques - Henri-Georges Clouzot)\n\n'Carry On, Turn Me On' - Space\n\n- - - - -\n\n14. Luchino Visconti (born 2 November 1906, Milan, Lombardy, Kingdom of Italy)\n\nLuchino Visconti was a giant of Italian art, theatre and opera who played the cello. The breadth, depth and scale of his work in cinema was befitting of a man who embodied the artistic traditions of Italian opera. Today, he's considered one of the \"Fathers of Neorealism\", as well as Italy's great chronicler of the slow and painful death of the ruling aristocracy. No subject was too big and no canvas too small, as Visconti could mount stunning imagery using any visual form, regardless of the tools he'd been given.\n\nAnother attribute of Visconti's skill-set is that he and his teams of screenwriters were adept at translating heavy literary works for the big screen without being seen as having betrayed the original text, creating films that complimented their source material but were their own artistic entity.\n\nThe first Visconti movie I saw was 'The Leopard' (1963) which was recommended by Martin Scorsese when I was a boy. Along with John Ford's western 'The Searchers' (1956), I believe it's a film that's pretty much never left Scorsese's ranked, written list of his all-time favourite movies, whether he's been asked to list just 5, or as many as 55. Once I'd seen 'The Leopard' for myself, I could understand why. For my money, some of Visconti's small-scale pictures are equally good though.\n\nTRIVIA : Luchino Visconti's nephew Eriprando Visconti became a filmmaker.\n\nSelected Luchino Visconti Films (11)\n\n01) 'Obsession' (1943, Ossessione - Luchino Visconti)\n\n02) 'The Earth Will Tremble' (1948, La terra trema - Luchino Visconti)\n\n03) 'Bellissima' (1951, Bellissima - Luchino Visconti)\n\n04) 'Senso' (1954, Senso - Luchino Visconti)\n\n05) 'White Nights' (1957, Le notti bianche - Luchino Visconti)\n\n06) 'Rocco And His Brothers' (1960, Rocco e i suoi fratelli - Luchino Visconti)\n\n07) 'The Leopard' (1963, Il Gattopardo - Luchino Visconti)\n\n08) 'Sandra' (1965, Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa - Luchino Visconti)\n\n09) 'The Witches' (1967, Le streghe - Mauro Bolognini, Vittorio De Sica, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Franco Rossi & Luchino Visconti)\n\n10) 'Conversation Piece' (1974, Gruppo di famiglia in un interno - Luchino Visconti)\n\n11) 'The Innocent' (1976, L'innocente - Luchino Visconti)\n\n'I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone' - Giorgio Moroder\n\n- - - - -\n\n15. Giorgio Ferroni (born 12 April 1908, Perugia, Umbria, Italy)\n\nSome directors are just experts in their craft and Giorgio Ferroni is a point in case. I think his early forays into \"neorealism\" hold up well as he was a classical storyteller who placed an emphasis on narrative. He specialised in making \"peplum\" films and \"spaghetti westerns\" in the 1960s and brought the hand of a seasoned craftsman to every picture he directed.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of the historic \"peplum\" fantasy genre when it comes to Italy's unusual cinematic subgenres as many of the films were muscle & fitness workouts dressed up as historical drama, but Ferroni contributed some entertaining entries early in the original cycle that leant more heavily on ancient mythology and these movies look pretty amazing now if you see them in their restored widescreen prints.\n\nSelected Giorgio Ferroni Films (4)\n\n01) 'Tombolo' (1947, Tombolo, paradiso nero - Giorgio Ferroni)\n\n02) 'Mill Of The Stone Women' (1960, Il mulino delle donne di pietra - Giorgio Ferroni)\n\n03) 'The Baccantes' (1961, Le baccanti – Giorgio Ferroni)\n\n04) 'The Night Of The Devils' (1972, La notte dei diavoli - Giorgio Ferroni)\n\n- - - - -\n\nLe sport des champions\n\n♫ 'Lady America' ♪ ~ Voyage ♫\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\n125 Filmmakers [16 - 20]\n\n- - - - -\n\n16. Manoel de Oliveira (born 11 December 1908, Porto, Kingdom of Portugal)\n\nThe international distribution of Portuguese cinema has been shameful for decades, and though it's slowly improving in the 21st century thanks to digital versatile disc technology, few of Manoel De Oliveira's works are in widespread circulation or currently in print. Despite this, film fans around the world have been discovering his work through the wonders of online viewing platforms like youtube (myself included). This viewing revolution has joined with a flood of budget-priced dvds to open up cinema to the poor for the first time since video rentals became cheap in the 1980s, which in itself was superseded by working-class film revolutions instigated by cheap matinee screenings during the Golden Age, followed by the drive-in revolution of the \"Boom-Boom Era\".\n\nFilm festivals have also played their part in bringing rare films to dedicated moviegoers. The Film Society of Lincoln Center screened restored prints of De Oliveira’s 'Frustrated Love' quadrilogy in New York in 2016. This was an important event for shining a new light upon some of Portuguese cinema's old delights.\n\nDe Oliveira's charming debut feature, 'Silly Aniki' (1942), is not only a milestone in Portuguese cinema, but also a film now widely credited as being one of the primary influences on Italy's \"neorealist\" film school, alongside Jean Renoir's groundbreaking drama 'Toni' (1935) on which Luchino Visconti served as an assistant director. Certain tenets of \"neorealism\" are present in the storytelling; for example, De Oliveira used largely non-professional actors, including children from his local community back home in Porto.\n\nYet De Oliveira, who was a man of faith and a man of the theatre, more often created atmospheric chamber pieces and philosophical period antiques. Ideally, I'd like to see some nice box-sets of De Oliveira's films released in English-speaking territories, so people can regularly enjoy the work of the man many consider to be Portugal's greatest filmmaker. He's certainly my favourite.\n\nTRIVIA : Manoel De Oliveira's son Manuel Casimiro, with poet Maria Isabel Carvalhais, became a painter and a filmmaker. Their grandson Ricardo Trêpa is an actor.\n\nSelected Manoel de Oliveira Films (7)\n\n01) 'Silly Aniki' (1942, Aniki-Bóbó - Manoel De Oliveira)\n\n02) 'Past And Present' (1972, Passado e o Presente - Manoel De Oliveira)\n\n03) 'Benilde Or The Virgin Mother' (1975, Benilde ou a Virgem Mãe - Manoel De Oliveira)\n\n04) 'Doomed Love' (1978, Amor de Perdição - Manoel De Oliveira)\n\n05) 'Francisca' (1981, Francisca - Manoel De Oliveira)\n\n06) 'My Case' (1986, O meu caso - Manoel De Oliveira)\n\n07) 'Eccentricities Of A Blonde-Haired Girl' (2009, Singularidades de uma Rapariga Loura - Manoel De Oliveira)\n\n- - - - -\n\n17. Georges Franju (born 12 April 1912, Fougères, France)\n\nI think it's important to note when talking about filmmaker Georges Franju that he was an artist, a documentarian and a historian. During his time in the French military he was stationed in Algeria and upon discharge he began performing all sorts of roles within the film and theatre industries. He worked as a set designer for Casino de Paris and the Folies Bergère, he co-created the film society Le Cercle du Cinema with archivist Henri Langlois, he contributed to a pair of film publications he'd launched with Langlois and together they co-founded the Cinémathèque Française in Paris in 1936. Langlois received an honorary Lifetime Achievement Oscar in 1974 from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for \"his devotion to the art of film, his massive contributions in preserving its past and his unswerving faith in its future\", and I feel it's important to note that Franju was a key associate in his early days.\n\nFranju became an interesting director of a classicist bent and filtered his documentary techniques through film. The drama 'Head Against The Wall' (1958) was originally intended to be the directorial debut of prolific filmmaker Jean-Pierre Mocky, one of French cinema's great iconoclasts, but the film's producer brought in Franju to direct (Mocky does play one of the main roles). In his later years, Fanju worked in theatre and television before returning to Cinémathèque Française where he took up a position as acting director.\n\nSelected Georges Franju Films (4)\n\n01) 'Head Against The Wall' (1958, La Tête contre les murs - Georges Franju)\n\n02) 'Eyes Without A Face' (1959, Les Yeux sans visage - Georges Franju)\n\n03) 'Therese Desqueyroux' (1962, Thérèse Desqueyroux - Georges Franju)\n\n04) 'Judex' (1963, Judex - Georges Franju)\n\n- - - - -\n\n18. Michelangelo Antonioni (born 29 September 1912, Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, Kingdom of Italy)\n\nLuchino Visconti was a skilled cellist and Michelangelo Antonioni was a violin prodigy. Music courses through the veins of Italian artists like liquid methane runs through Titan's streams, and both directors projected the pure, unadulterated melodrama of opera on to vast latin canvases, though their styles couldn't have been more different.\n\nI've heard that Antonioni was fortunate to survive the 2nd World War. He served in the army having been fired from Vittorio Mussolini's film publication 'Cinema' and he was condemned for his involvement with the Italian Resistance movement. His unusual politics only alienated him further and probably instructed his decision to focus upon telling tales of individuals, outsiders and life's eternal wanderers. By the time he made 'Zabriskie Point' (1970), Antonioni was being asked to defend himself while being branded a \"radical, anti-capitalist existentialist\" by critics.\n\nThere's a musicality and a sustained tone to Antonioni's film work, even when his landscapes are remote, barren and sparsely populated. When asked about his films in an interview he gave in 1969, Antonioni replied, “The theme of most of my films is loneliness ... Often my characters are isolated. They are individuals looking for social institutions that will support them, for personal relationships that will absorb them. But most often they find little to sustain them. They are looking for a home.”\n\nSelected Michelangelo Antonioni Films (15)\n\n01) 'Story Of A Love Affair' (1950, Cronaca di un amore - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n02) 'The Vanquished' (1952, I Vinti - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n03) 'The Lady Without Camelias' (1953, La signora senza camelie - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n04) 'Love In The City' (1953, L'amore in città - Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini, Carlo Lizzani, Alberto Lattuada, Francesco Maselli, Dino Risi & Cesare Zavattini)\n\n05) 'The Girlfriends' (1955, Le Amiche - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n06) 'The Cry' (1957, Il Grido - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n07) 'The Adventure' (1960, L'Avventura - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n08) 'The Night' (1961, La Notte - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n09) 'Eclipse' (1962, L'Eclisse - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n10) 'Red Desert' (1964, Il deserto rosso - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n11) 'Blowup' (1966 - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n12) 'Zabriskie Point' (1970 - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n13) 'The Passenger' (1975, Professione: reporter - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n14) 'Identification Of A Woman' (1982, Identificazione di una donna - Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\n15) 'Beyond The Clouds' (1995, Al di là delle nuvole - Michelangelo Antonioni & Wim Wenders)\n\n- - - - -\n\n19. René Clément (born 18 March 1913, Bordeaux, France)\n\nRene Clement studied architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which I read has been called \"the cradle of the Beaux-Arts style\" in architectural circles, a style that proliferated in the 19th century and inspired city architects building the new America. Clement was an early associate of Jacques Tati and he directed the sports-mad comic in a short comedy about boxing, 'Watch Your Left' (1936). Years later, Clement was approached by producers to direct another of Tati's films, but he politely declined the offer as he knew Tati wished to direct it himself.\n\nClement became a leading documentary filmmaker during the 2nd World War. When he started making theatrical features with the war film 'The Battle Of The Rails' (1946) it became clear his wartime experiences had changed him and he used his documentary techniques to enhance a sense of realism. In the years that followed, Clement established his reputation as one of France's premiere storytellers.\n\nSelected René Clément Films (7)\n\n01) 'Forbidden Games' (1952, Jeux interdits - Rene Clement)\n\n02) 'Gervaise' (1956, Gervaise - Rene Clement)\n\n03) 'Purple Noon' (1960, Plein soleil - Rene Clement)\n\n04) 'The Joy Of Living' (1961, Quelle joie de vivre - Rene Clement)\n\n05) 'Joy House' (1964, Les Félins - Rene Clement)\n\n06) 'Rider On The Rain' (1970, Le Passager de la pluie - Rene Clement)\n\n07) 'Wanted : Babysitter' (1975, La Baby-Sitter - Rene Clement)\n\n- - - - -\n\n20. Marino Girolami (born 1 February 1914, Rome, Lazio, Italy)\n\nWhen Italian cinema entered into its post-war, economic \"boom\" years in the 1950s, this was the cue for Marino Girolami to step up to the plate. He did so by forming a bond with comic actor Walter Chiari whom he'd direct in several smash hit features. Once he'd struck success, Girolami became the ultimate industry man and built a reputation for being a relentless workaholic. This led him to become one of the most prolific directors of the post-war era and he worked with many of Italy's greatest comic performers.\n\nIf anybody climbed to the top of their profession by their fingernails, it was Girolami. A professional boxer in his youth, he opened a health & fitness club that specialised in therapeutic massage, something he parodied during a massage scene in 'Where Can You Go Without The Little Vice?' (1979). He served as an assistant director throughout the 1940s and studied the different techniques of the directors he worked for. An early mentor was filmmaker Vittorio Metz who co-wrote the screenplays for some of comedian Totò's most popular films. Having never forgotten where he came from, or the help he'd gotten along the way, Girolami later helped his younger brother Romolo Guerrieri to become a film director.\n\nGirolami exhibited a light comic touch and subtle directorial skills which made him perfect for screwball comedy. The camerawork in his films was often inventive and he employed visual trickery too. Over the course of his filmmaking career, he busted every taboo you can think of, challenged hypocritical notions of church and state, explored gender rivalry and allowed comic performers to improvise and go wild. A one-man band at times, he even challenged the popular and lucrative industry anthology format of the boom years by engineering a string of his own anthology films in which he directed every sequence. And though he specialised in comedy, Girolami dipped his toes in virtually every genre, though he brought a distinct comic touch to even the most harsh material.\n\nPerformers enjoyed working with Girolami which allowed him to build an enormous stock assembly. The one thing I know he actively fought against was studio interference and executive intolerance. One of his more difficult experiences came when he directed 'Flying Sex' (1980), a challenging seriocomic drama about the psychological effects of sexual fear. Girolami produced a thoughtful, stylised work of playful erotica but the film's producers took it away, had it crudely re-edited, then added pornographic inserts behind his back in order to meet European market demands of the time, leading Girolami to denounce the picture outright, which is a shame as the insert-free director's cut remains an extraordinary work in itself. Always the workhorse, Girolami simply picked himself up, dusted himself off, and produced another string of box-office hits anchored this time around by comedian and (Federico) Fellini-mainstay Alv"
