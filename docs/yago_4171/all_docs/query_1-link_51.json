        "text": "Few events in the history of film have been more significant than the 1981 revival of Abel Gance's ''Napoleon,'' 54 years after it was first shown in Paris. Restored by Kevin Brownlow, a masterpiece was rediscovered and a film artist was rescued from decades of neglect. Gance died at the age of 92 in 1981, only weeks after his silent film opened at Radio City Music Hall, its new score by Carmine Coppola played by a full orchestra in the pit.\n\nIn preparation for a broadcast of the entire four-hour film next weekend, Channel 13's ''Film on Film'' is offering an hourlong French documentary about the production tomorrow evening at 10 o'clock. ''Abel Gance and His 'Napoleon' '' was written and directed by Nelly Kaplan, who is described in a station press release as Gance's closest collaborator.There are English subtitles that occasionally disappear against white backgrounds, but the decidedly heroic scope of Gance and his project comes through clearly.\n\nThe French director began working on the script in 1924. Before the film opened in 1927, he went through work stoppages, accidents, money crises and a staggering budget of $17 million. The Kaplan documentary includes not only working photographs and brief clips from the film but also footage of the director himself at work (and sometimes play) and a tape of his rather remarkable directive to his cast and crew on the first day of work.\n\nLike Napoleon, evidently, Gance pursued glory almost fanatically. He assured his staff members that they were about to go ''through the giant portal of history.'' Demanding total commitment from the troops, he warned that ''you must find within you the fire and the madness'' to fully realize the director's visions. ''I demand dismissal of personal problems,'' he said, adding dramatically that ''the movie screens of the world await you.''\n\nGance was determined to make his audience ''see cinematically,'' as he put it. The camera wouldn't just stand there and record; it would walk like a person and ride like a horse. A camera was devised that could revolve 360 degrees. Cameras were placed on platforms that could move up and down. They were moved overhead on stretched ropes and, yes, they were even strapped to the backs of galloping horses.\n\n''I wanted the screen to explode,'' Gance said. Seeking panoramic effects, he used what was called the Berton triptych process: three sychronized cameras, their footage simulaneously transferred to three separate screens by different projectors. ''In truth,'' Gance said, ''the age of the image has come.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
