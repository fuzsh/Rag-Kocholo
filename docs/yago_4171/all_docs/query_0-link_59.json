        "text": "The government has announced it will set the charges cap for workplace pensions at 0.75%.\n\nThe proposal for the cap on pension charges was part of the Department of Work and Pensions’ consultation into charges on workplace pension schemes, which opened in October 2013 and closed in November 2013.\n\nThe government has also set out equivalent caps for pension schemes with combination charge structures.\n\nThree different categories of pension charges will be banned altogether. The are:\n\nPayments for sales commissions that are deducted from members’ pensions.\n\nCharge hikes when people are no longer employed by an organisation, but leave money in the employer’s pension scheme.\n\nConsultancy charges, where members have to pay for advice given to their employer.\n\nIn addition, the government has announced there will be tough new rules to make sure that all of the hidden ‘transaction’ costs in pension schemes are published, and it will then consider whether these should also be included in the new charge cap.\n\nAn independent audit of pre-2001 and high-charging pension schemes is due to be completed by the end of the year. The government will consider whether further action to protect scheme members is necessary following that review.\n\nSteve Webb (pictured), pensions minister, said: “Through the new measures, this government will be the first to get an iron grip on pension charges. We are going to put charges in a vice, and we will tighten the pressure, year after year.\n\nSign up to our newsletters\n\nReceive news and guidance on a range of HR issues direct to your inbox\n\nEmail(Required)\n\nOptOut\n\nFrom time to time, we will send you emails about selected products, events and services from Employee Benefits – but you can choose to opt-out at any time.

Pension savers have paid too much, for too long. It is time to put the saver first.”"
