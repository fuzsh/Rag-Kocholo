        "text": "In short, a Professional Engineer is an engineer who has gone through all the necessary steps to earn their licensure. This means that they have not only completed a four-year college degree but also worked and studied under a Professional Engineer for several years (depending on the state), passed several intensive exams to measure their competency, and earned a license from their state’s licensure board.\n\nEven after getting their license, an engineer must maintain their PE title by continuing their education and learning new skills. The world around us is moving at an exponential rate. New materials, methods, and safety measures are being discovered and discussed every year. Continued education is measured by Professional Development Hours (PDH), which numerous sources, such as online classes, webinars, and seminars, can fulfill. Though the amount of PDHs needed varies by state, the result is the same: each respective state Board of Professional Engineers enforces PDH requirements to ensure that licensed PEs are up to date on modern tools, techniques, laws, and ethics.\n\nObviously, this is no small feat. It’s not hyperbole to say that engineers’ work affects the lives and safety of everyone around them. This is why they must go through so much rigorous, continuous training to ensure their reliability. A Professional Engineer designation tells clients that you have the credentials worth their time, money, and trust—and it tells employers that you’ve taken on the continued responsibility to provide critical services.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an Engineer and a PE?\n\nA Professional Engineer fulfills key tasks that can only be performed by someone of their status. This includes preparing, signing, and submitting plans and drawings for approval. Licensure is a legal requirement for these tasks to take place—a PE is the one who is primarily responsible for the design and construction of their work, and thus the safety and wellbeing of those who will use their designs.\n\nIt’s also professionally desirable. Most higher-level positions, both inside the government and in private firms, require a PE to fill their higher-level roles. To continue to progress through the industry, earning your PE license is a must.\n\nI’m still in High School. What should I focus on?\n\nIf you’re a high school student, choosing your career path can be a bit overwhelming. If you know you’re going to want to be an engineer, though, then you can begin preparing before you graduate!\n\nOne way you can accelerate the process is by looking into AP courses, such as AP Calculus, AP Statistics, AP Chemistry, and AP Physics. By doing so, you’ll put yourself ahead of some of your peers and cut down on the amount of time you will be spending in a classroom once you’re in college. Some schools offer specialized STEM courses as well—this varies from district to district, so keep an eye out!\n\nAnother thing that can help put you ahead is by getting ‘hands on’ with clubs, projects, and volunteer work. You don’t always have to pick something technical—even joining a band can help develop parallel skills that will help you in the future. Being part of extracurricular activities is integral to developing a well-rounded set of skills and experiences.\n\nThe most important thing you can do at this stage is to focus on yourself and your grades. After all, engineering is about more than building—you will have to write proposals, work well with a team, understand government policy, and more. This means you shouldn’t neglect your non-STEM courses just because they’re not ‘traditional’ classes for your intended field. It’s important to be holistic in your approach to education! By making yourself an attractive candidate for colleges, you’ll have more freedom to pursue the engineering program of your choice.\n\nStep One: Education\n\nAnyone seeking to become a professional engineer must complete a four-year Bachelor’s program. Most colleges offer a 4-year program for civil engineering, and these programs offer different areas of expertise depending on the college. The Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) assesses these programs to verify that they teach the material needed to succeed in the field. You’ll want to ensure the program you are entering is ABET credited to ensure that you will gain the proper skills and knowledge needed to enter your field successfully. If you don’t attend an ABET-credited institution (because you studied abroad or for other reasons), that’s okay! You can still pursue a PE designation—it might just take a little longer.\n\nAs you progress through your education, you may decide on a specialization track, such as structural engineering. You will focus on that specialization for your junior and senior years of undergrad. Advanced specializations also take a student beyond the four years normally required of a civil engineer—which means that some specializations leave students with six years of educational experience.\n\nThough there are Master’s programs, most are not necessary to enter the field. Instead, individuals who seek to earn their Professional Engineering license will further their education through Professional Development Hours, as previously mentioned. While some firms may still seek out individuals with graduate degrees, this is not a necessity. Look into the job prospects within your area (or the area you would like to work in) to gauge whether or not this step is right for you.\n\nStep Three: Earn Progressive Engineering Experience\n\nThis one is not as uniform as the previous two steps. Once you have completed your education and passed the FE Exam, you qualify for your engineer-in-training (EIT) or Engineering Intern (EI) certification. This certification is indefinite and persists throughout the next phase of your training: progressive engineering experience.\n\nThough it varies from state to state, every EIT or EI must complete time in the field actively working on projects to prove they are viable for a PE designation. This usually looks like several years of full-time work in the field of engineering. A licensed Professional Engineer must supervise at least half of your time to ensure that any errors you may make are addressed and corrected while you pursue this experience.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this—for instance, if you pursued a master’s degree, it may substitute as qualified time in the field. States may also have different requirements; for instance, North Carolina does not have a time requirement for taking the PE exam so long as you have graduated and passed your FE exam. However, it is important to note that part-time work does not qualify for this four-year requirement—and though some firms offer intern positions, they may not qualify for eligibility, either. Be very thorough with your research before accepting a position to ensure it will go towards your experience goals.\n\nStep Four: Pass your exams!\n\nThe PE Exam, or the Principles and Practices of Engineering Exam, puts your acquired knowledge and experience to the test. This assessment is one that you have to sign up for. Some states have this occur during specific months, such as October and April, while others, like North Carolina, let you take the test at any point in the year. Though overcoming this eight-hour-long test can be grueling, you will qualify for your Professional Engineering license if you pass it!\n\nIf you’re in California, you have two additional tests to take before qualifying—the seismic and surveying exams. These two-and-a-half hour-long tests are offered on a rolling basis and are required by the State of California for your PE license.\n\nIf you’re going to become a licensed Structural Engineer, you have to pass another exam: the SE. This exam’s timing can also vary by state, so ensure you’re up-to-date on when the exam is offered in your location. Given over the course of two days, this sixteen-hour long exam has two sections that can be passed independently, so if you pass one of them, you don’t have to retake it to pass the other.\n\nOnce you pass your examination, you must submit your application for licensure including your progressive engineering experience gained, your professional references, and verification of passing both the FE and PE exams. The respective state Board will review the application and if all requirements have been met, congratulations, you’re a Professional Engineer!"
