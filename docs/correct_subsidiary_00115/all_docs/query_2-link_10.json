        "text": "Description\n\nSiemens EDA is a broad line supplier of EDA tools. It provides a complete semiconductor design flow that includes simulation, emulation, place and route, verification, design for manufacturing, and test. It also develops tools for wire harness systems and computational fluid dynamics. It serves a wide variety of markets ranging from communications, consumer electronics, semiconductors, networking, multimedia, mil/aero and transportation.\n\nSystem and software revenues are derived primarily from term software license contracts, typically lasting three to four years. Enterprise-wide license revenues, which account for 50% or more of the company’s system and software revenue, are the major reason for fluctuations in revenue. Ten accounts are responsible for about 50% of the company’s receivables.\n\nMentor Graphics was the third largest of the Big Three EDA vendors by revenue, behind Synopsys and Cadence, but its acquisition by Siemens in 2017 has made it part of one of the world’s largest multinational companies. The combined company ranked 70th on Fortune’s list of Global500 companies. Mentor’s design-for-test software platform is Tessent, which is now part of Siemen’s Xcelerator portfolio. Calibre, Catapult and Questa are Mentor’s other platform names, among many.\n\nHQ: Wilsonville, OR, USA\n\nFounded: 1981\n\nFounded by: Gerald H.
