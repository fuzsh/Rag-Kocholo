        "text": "Electronic design automation company\n\nMentor Graphics Corporation was a US-based electronic design automation (EDA) multinational corporation for electrical engineering and electronics, headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon. Founded in 1981, the company distributed products that assist in electronic design automation, simulation tools for analog mixed-signal design, VPN solutions, and fluid dynamics and heat transfer tools. The company leveraged Apollo Computer workstations to differentiate itself within the computer-aided engineering (CAE) market with its software and hardware.\n\nMentor Graphics was acquired by Siemens in 2017. The name was retired in 2021 and renamed Siemens EDA, a segment of Siemens Digital Industries Software.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nMentor Graphics was founded in 1981 by Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler, and Dave Moffenbeier, all formerly of Tektronix.[6] The company raised $55 million in funding through an initial public offering in 1984.[6]\n\nMentor initially wrote software that ran only in Apollo workstations.[7]\n\nWhen Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software – Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware – Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.\n\nAfter a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.[8]\n\nMentor Graphics was purchased by Siemens in 2017. The name was retired in 2021 and renamed Siemens EDA, a segment of Siemens Digital Industries Software.[9]\n\nAcquisitions[edit]\n\nTimeline[edit]\n\nYear announced Company Business Value (USD) References 1995 Microtec Research Software development $130 million [10] 1999 VeriBest EDA subsidiary of Intergraph Corp. not disclosed [11][12] 2002 Accelerated Technology RTOS & embedded software not disclosed [13] 2002 Innoveda Printed circuit board & wire harness design $160 million [14] 2002 IKOS Systems Emulation product $124 million [15] 2004 Project Technology Executable UML not disclosed [16] 2007 Sierra Design Automation Place and route $90 million [17] 2008 Flomerics Computational fluid dynamics $59.72 million [18] 2009 LogicVision Silicon manufacturing testing $13 million [19] 2010 Valor Computerized Systems PCB systems manufacturing $82 million [20] 2010 CodeSourcery GNU-based tools not disclosed [21] 2014 Nimbic Electromagnetic simulation not disclosed [22] 2014 Berkeley Design Automation AMS circuit verification not disclosed [23] 2015 Tanner EDA AMS & MEMS integrated circuits not disclosed [24] 2015 Calypto Design Systems High level synthesis not disclosed [25]\n\nRelated[edit]\n\nIn June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics' Board and management to discuss the offer.[26]\n\nIn February 2011, activist investor Carl Icahn offered to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.[27]\n\nIn November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion,[28] at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor's closing price on the previous Friday.[29] The acquisition was completed in March 2017.[30] At this time, this represented Siemen's biggest deal in the industrial software sector.[31] Mentor Graphics started to operate as \"Mentor, a Siemens Business\".[32] Under the terms of the acquisition, Mentor Graphics kept its headquarters in Wilsonville with workforce intact, and operated as an independent subsidiary.[1]\n\nIn January 2021, Mentor became a division of Siemens and was renamed as Siemens EDA.[33]\n\nLocations[edit]\n\nMentor product development was located in the US, Taiwan, Egypt, Poland, Hungary, Japan, France, Canada, Pakistan, UK, Armenia, India and Russia.\n\nProducts[edit]\n\nMentor offered the following tools:\n\nElectronic design automation[edit]\n\nIntegrated circuit layout full-custom and schematic-driven layout (SDL) tools such as IC Station or Memory Builder, a first industry tool for rapid embedded memory design that helped to develop single- or dual-port RAMs (synchronous and asynchronous), as well as diffusion and metal read only memories (ROM)\n\nIC place and route tool: Aprisa\n\nIC Verification tools such as Calibre nmDRC, Calibre nmLVS, Calibre xRC, Calibre xACT 3D\n\nIC Design for Manufacturing tools such as Calibre LFD, Calibre YieldEnhancer, Calibre, and YieldAnalyzer\n\nSchematic capture editors for electronic schematics such as Xpedition Designer\n\nLayout and design tools for printed circuit boards with programs such as PADS, Xpedition Layout, HyperLynx and Valor NPI\n\nFalcon Framework, software application framework[34]\n\nComponent library management tools\n\nIP cores for ASIC and FPGA designs\n\nEmbedded systems[edit]\n\nMentor Embedded Linux[35] for ARM, MIPS, Power, and x86 architecture processors\n\nReal-time operating systems:\n\nNucleus OS (acquired in 2002 when Mentor acquired Accelerated Technology, Inc.)\n\nVRTX (acquired in 1995 when Mentor bought Microtec Research)\n\nAUTOSAR implementation:\n\nEmbedded implementation VSTAR in part acquired from Mecel in 2013[36]\n\nConfiguration tooling Volcano Vehicle Systems Builder (VSB)\n\nDevelopment Tools:\n\nSourcery CodeBench and Sourcery GNU toolchains (acquired in 2010 when Mentor acquired CodeSourcery)\n\nInflexion UI – (Next Device was acquired by Mentor in 2006)\n\nxtUML Design Tools: BridgePoint (acquired in 2004 when Mentor acquired Project Technology)\n\nVPN Solutions:\n\nNucleus Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) software\n\nNucleus NET networking stack\n\nNucleus implementation of the Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) protocol\n\nNucleus PPP software\n\nFPGA synthesis[edit]\n\nPrecision Synthesis – Advanced RTL & physical synthesis for FPGAs\n\nElectrical systems, cabling, and harness[edit]\n\nCapital – a suite of integrated tools for the design, validation and manufacture of electrical systems and harnesses\n\nVeSys – a mid-market toolset for vehicle electrical system and harness design\n\nSimulation[edit]\n\nModelSim is a hardware simulation and debug environment primarily targeted at smaller ASIC and FPGA design\n\nQuestaSim is a simulator with advanced debug capabilities targeted at complex FPGA's and SoC's. QuestaSim can be used by users who have experience with ModelSim as it shares most of the common debug features and capabilities. One of the main differences between QuestaSim and Modelsim (besides performance/capacity) is that QuestaSim is the simulation engine for the Questa Platform which includes integration of Verification Management, Formal based technologies, Questa Verification IP, Low Power Simulation and Accelerated Coverage Closure technologies.
