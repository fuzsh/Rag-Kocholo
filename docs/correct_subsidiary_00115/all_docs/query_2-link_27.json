Innoveda was created when Viewlogic, my previous company, did a reverse acquisition of Summit Design, a public company. I co-founded Viewlogic in 1984 and left the company in 1992, a year after the company’s IPO. I then rejoined the company in 1995 initally as President, then as CEO. Viewlogic Systems was acquired by Synopsys in 1997. One year later, most of the assets acquired by Synopsys were re-purchased by a small team I led via an MBO re-forming Viewlogic as a new private company.\n\nHerman’s early experience came from Digital Equipment Corp, Dataware Logic and Health Care Computer systems.\n\nHerman holds a BS, Computer Science/Mathematics from Temple University"
