        "text": "WILSONVILLE, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ:MENT) today announced Precise-IP™ — a new vendor-independent IP (Intellectual Property) platform as part of the Mentor Graphics® Precision® Synthesis product line. The platform includes vendor-independent configurable IP from Mentor Graphics and links to categorized third-party IP from leading vendors. The third-party IP was certified by the respective IP vendor to ensure high quality of results with the Precision Synthesis technology.\n\nAs part of a complete vendor-independent IP methodology, the Precise-IP platform contains a library of configurable IP for use with the Precision Synthesis solution. The easy-to-use wizard creates frequently used synthesizable IP based on user parameter settings. The configuration parameters are then validated by a self-checking GUI to ensure configuration conformance. The IP cores are optimized for best quality of results (QoR) across FPGA families.\n\nA comprehensive catalog of complex cores — such as processors, interface controllers, and application-specific cores — are provided by leading IP vendors and available for multiple FPGA families. Participating vendors of the Precise-IP Partner Program are ARC, ARM, Aeroflex Gaisler, CAST, Eureka Technology, Helion, IPextreme, Innovative Logic, and OptNgn. Mentor Graphics continues to add new configurable IP and new partners to expand its catalog of supported cores.\n\n“Mentor’s Precise-IP is a big win for design engineers,” stated Gary Smith, principal of Gary Smith EDA. “Non-proprietary, commercial IP that is vendor independent gives the FPGA designer the freedom to select the device that delivers the best results.”\n\n“An effective vendor-neutral design methodology requires vendor-independent IP to complement EDA design tools,” stated Daniel Platzker, Mentor Graphics FPGA division product line director. “With Precision Synthesis’ Precise-IP platform, designers can easily create widely used IP and find high-quality cores from leading IP vendors, thus retaining the flexibility to retarget their designs to different FPGA silicon as the need arises.”\n\nThe Precise-IP platform is available within the Precision Synthesis product. For more information, visit the company website at: www.mentor.com/precision/precise-ip. You can also contact a local Mentor Graphics sales office, or call 800-547-3000 for specific product and pricing details.\n\nAbout Precision Synthesis\n\nThe Precision Synthesis product line forms the centerpiece of Mentor Graphics FPGA flow — the industry's most comprehensive vendor-independent solution for FPGA design. The Precision RTL Plus product offers breakthrough capabilities such as vendor-independent physical synthesis which provides industry-leading quality of results, automatic incremental synthesis to reduce the impact of late design cycle changes, and patent-pending functionality which enables the efficient utilization of architectural blocks. With advanced support for ASIC prototyping (support for DesignWare libraries, SDC constraints, gated-clock handling, etc.) plus advanced implementation and optimization techniques such as automatic mapping and inference of dedicated DSP and RAM blocks, the Precision Synthesis product is uniquely suited to handle today’s high-end FPGAs. In addition, the Precision Synthesis product features an award-winning design analysis capability, allowing designers to cross-probe between multiple views as well as to perform interactive static timing for rapid \"what-if\" analyses.\n\nAbout Mentor Graphics\n\nMentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ:MENT) is a world leader in electronic hardware and software design solutions, providing products, consulting services and award-winning support for the world’s most successful electronics and semiconductor companies. Established in 1981, the company reported revenues over the last 12 months of about $800 million and employs approximately 4,425 people worldwide. Corporate headquarters are located at 8005 S.W. Boeckman Road, Wilsonville, Oregon, 97070-7777.
