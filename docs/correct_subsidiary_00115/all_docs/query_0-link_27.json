        "text": "What’s happening with current and future chiplet security?\n\nElectronic System Design Alliance (ESDA), part of SEMI, USA, organized a conference today on chiplet security — current and future.\n\nMany semiconductor-based systems are moving toward 2.5D and 3D designs consisting of different pre-manufactured chips (chiplets) that perform specific functions. These are often provided by multiple vendors, and are typically interconnected using an interposer.\n\nHowever, unlike monolithic multi-function chips, chiplets can be developed anywhere and at any process node. As such, chiplets from untrusted vendors can be unreliable or malicious. Third parties can reverse engineer, overproduce, or steal the IP of chiplets. Consequently, they raise new security challenges for an industry still figuring out ways to effectively mitigate hardware security threats to monolithic chips.\n\nThere are potential threats at different stages of bringing chiplets to life, including design, assembly, and testing. The panelists assessed current safeguards to mitigate these risks and discussed open challenges for the industry and academia.\n\nBob Smith, Executive Director, ESD Alliance, the SEMI Strategic Association Partner, welcomed everyone, and introduced the panelists.\n\nThe panelists were: Serge Leef, Head of Secure Microelectronics, Microsoft, Dr. Swarup Bhunia, Semmoto-endowed Prof. and Director, Warren B. Nelms Institute, Salman Nasir, Senior Technical Program Manager, Battelle, John Hallman, Digital Verification Technology Solutions Manager, Siemens EDA, Ming Zhang, VP of R&D Acceleration, PDF Solutions, and Steve Carlson, Director/Solutions Architect, Aerospace and Defense Solutions, Cadence Design Systems. Raj Gautam Dutta, CEO, Silicon Assurance, was the moderator.\n\nChiplet security\n\nSerge Leef, Microsoft, said that you need to think about chiplet security in two or three layers. Supply chain, side channel attacks, reverse engineering, are very important. Chiplets should have protection against these on board. Interposer presents opportunities and challenges. It can also hold secrets as it is manufactured as part of a chip. There needs to be security architecture across HI. We need to be aware of what should be of architecture.\n\nSalman Nasir, Battelle, said we are witnessing a shift in the semiconductor industry. We are looking at security architectures of chips and chiplets. HI packaging is added to the chiplets. We also have to look at the security architectures. New measures can be included in the protocols, cryptographic accelerators, etc. Supply chain security is also imperative. We need to closely monitor the security.\n\nJohn Hallman, Siemens EDA, added that we are looking at trust, verification, etc., in the chip. We need to take this from SoC to chiplet security. Malicious circuitry may go into early design. We need to have good start, with integration and verification. We need to also combine that with traceability or supply chain. We also need to protect IP against reverse engineering.\n\nSteve Carlson, Cadence Design Systems, noted that we need to look at confidentiality, protection gains, access points, etc. It is a team sport across hardware and software,\n\nDr. Swarup Bhunia, Warren B. Nelms Institute, said chiplet security and integration is very important today. Now, SMEs can integrate diverse apps into a chiplet, and make that very democratic. Chiplets are individual ICs at a small scale. Side channel leakage, access control, etc., are areas to look at. Chip-level security can scale at package level. Also, the inter-chiplet communication can be a heavy attack surface. We need to think of new mode of inter-chiplet communication. Third, we need to create trustworthy chiplets, rather than using untrustworthy chiplets.\n\nMing Zhang, VP of R&D Acceleration, PDF Solutions, said there are unique things about chiplets regarding security. One, technology angle, and two, business angle. From technology side, chiplets have many interconnects, such as power, etc. The surface attack area could be larger. From business side, chiplets are seeing HI.\n\nDifferent from SoC security?\n\nHow is chiplet security different from SoC security? Salman Nasir said they are quite similar. From an SoC perspective, you can oversee the process from design to manufacturing. The integrator has greater potential to address vulnerabilities. Third-party IP is a black box, and IP integration takes place at the foundry. On chiplet side, there are similar concerns. The first is trustworthiness of the chiplet. It’s a hot topic right now! We have Cyber Trust Mark Program, GSA has ties with IoT, and NIST is looking into this. We can also look at security measures for encryption, etc., to ensure architecture is confidential and unaltered. More will come in the near future!\n\nLeef said the similarity is there. Side channel leakage, creating low emission cryptography are there, along with ML for anomalous communications, etc. Interposer-based architecture means that the interposer communications infrastructure could get exposed. We can shift the secrets to a trusted facility in the USA, such as routing tables, etc. NIST is also looking at standards to adopt.\n\nSteve Carlson added that IP access across the ecosystem should be conducted carefully. We have a competitive commercial environment, and a lot is at stake there. Security has the most relative cost, and is not free.\n\nFuture challenges\n\nTalking about challenges, Dr. Swarup Bhunia noted there are two broad classes. First is verification. Sources may be both trustworthy and untrustworthy. We need to verify trustworthiness of the verification. Second, once the chiplet is integrated into the system, I/O density can be a roadblock. Next, when you try integrating, we need to make sure they are secure. We need to have good look at trust. We also need the support of EDA tools. Information derived from verification methods may be trustworthy.\n\nJohn Hallman, said we need to prove, as we go up the stack. We need additional security verification at the integration level. Traceability is also evidence, with some security claims at low levels. We need to verify those. How can integrators build up security claims, is another issue. Leef noted that an objective assessment is needed. I am hoping for some government funding.\n\nFuture\n\nHow does the future look like for chiplet security? Steve Carlson said that we have functional verification integrated. Not much has been seen about physical side channels. We need to have the ecosystem work there. We also need better metrics and standardization for chiplet security. We also need automated design analysis.\n\nZhang added that lot of shift to focus from design to manufacturing. We are having discussions. We need combo of software analysis and hardware inspection. We also see integration of chiplets. We also need traceability of supply chains. In the future, we need to develop more trust. He added that chiplets are the future.\n\nSteve Carlson added there are customers spending on security and they still get hacked, We need help from policy makers with mandates to look into weakest links, such as network system, and monitoring.\n\nSalman Nasir noted that the ecosystem is going to grow over the next decade. We can bring in sensors, new materials, structures, 3D, etc. There are lot of opportunities, both in R&D and manufacturing.\n\nDr. Swarup Bhunia stated that chiplets will become more democratic in future. Chiplet vendors also need to follow some standards for security. We need to work hand in hand with the semiconductor industry.\n\nJohn Hallman said we are looking at new opportunities at how IP providers can better address security concerns. There can be more integration of chiplets, and more investment needs to be done.\n\nSerge Leef said there are lot of challenges regarding a secure silicon. The Government also needs to step in and provide funding to evolve this technology. Integration will be crucial! Perhaps, sub-3nm design can probably see more development, and restricted to the top few companies. Everybody else will be going to HI. We also need to ensure provenance, traceability, and security of the full chiplet that is made of dies coming from multiple foundries.\n\nHi darling, are you aware that a semiconductor fab requires significant annual investments, and has very high failure rates?\n\nTrendForce, Taiwan recently reported that total revenue of top 10 foundries fell by 4.7 percent QoQ for 4Q22, and will slide further for Q1-23. In Q4-22, quarterly total revenue of global top 10 foundries registered QoQ decline for first time, after 13 consecutive quarters of positive growth. TrendForce projects that quarterly total revenue of the top 10 will show an even steeper drop on account of seasonality and the uncertain macroeconomic situation.\n\nA foundry manufactures chips in a fabrication (fab) plant. It relies on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials to fabricate chip design on silicon wafer. Perhaps, people are aware that a semiconductor fab requires significant annual investment, and has high failure rates. Or, are they?\n\nOkay, let’s have a look at some of the well-known semiconductor companies. Most of these own fabs.\n\nUSA: Amkor, AMD, Analog Devices, Applied Materials, Broadcom, Intel, KLA, Entegris, GlobalFoundries, LAM Research, Micron, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Western Digital.\n\nNetherlands: ASM, ASML, Besi NV, NXP\n\nBelgium: Melexis\n\nSwitzerland: STMicroelectronics\n\nFrance: Air Liquide, Dassault Systemes, Soitec\n\nGermany: Aixtron, Bosch Semiconductors, Infineon, Siltronic, X-Fab\n\nUK: ARM, IQE\n\nChina: JCET, SMIC, TongFu Microelectronics\n\nTaiwan: ASE, Mediatek, Powertek, TSMC, UMC\n\nSouth Korea: Samsung Semiconductors, SK Hynix\n\nJapan: JSR, Kioxia, Nuvoton Technology (NTJC), Renesas, Shin-Etsu, TEL.\n\nJust for further interest:\n\nEDA: Cadence Design Systems, Siemens EDA, Synopsys, Ansys\n\nResearch centers: IMEC, Belgium, CEA-Leti, France, TNO, Netherlands, Fraunhofer, Germany, Centera Labs, Poland.\n\nAs per the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), global semiconductor industry sales totaled $41.3 billion during the month of January 2023, a decrease of 5.2 percent, compared to December 2022 total of $43.6 billion, and 18.5 percent less than January 2022 total of $50.7 billion. Monthly sales are compiled by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS).\n\nThe European semiconductor sector is focused on automotive and industrials clients. Almost two-thirds of European chip demand comes from industrials and automotive. European R&D and semiconductor manufacturing tools are important for the global value chain. Europe also needs to invest in AI.\n\nEuropean Chips Act has to strengthen the research and technology leadership, build and re-inforce their own capacity in design, manufacturing and packaging of advanced chips, and address skills challenges.\n\nOn Feb. 16, the European Parliament approved its position on the proposed legislation and was ready to start negotiations with member state governments on the Chips Act. It also approved a second draft bill on the Chips Joint Undertaking, an investment tool with the aims of promoting growth in the sector, and striving for EU leadership.\n\nMEPs voted to back Chips Joint Undertaking proposal, implementing most of the measures put forward under a “Chips for Europe” initiative, as part of the wider Horizon Europe program. It will initially pool together about €11 billion ($11.78 billion) drawn from the EU central funding, EU countries, and the private sector. Chips Act aims to eventually unlock €43 billion (£46 billion) in funding for the European semiconductor sector.\n\nTrouble in UK?\n\nIn Feb., it was reported that UK chipmakers were threatening to move their operations to the US or Europe, if the British government doesn’t get its act together and release its long-awaited semiconductor strategy. These include the UK chip startups – Pragmatic Semiconductor, IQE, and Paragraf. The UK government agrees on the importance of publishing a new UK semiconductor strategy that will set out a clear long-term vision for the UK. By the way, the UK’s share is about 0.5 percent of the global semiconductor market.\n\nIn USA\n\nAs per Chips.gov, the first notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) was Feb. 28, 2023. The second notice will be in late spring 2023 for material suppliers. Fall 2023 will see the third notice of funding opportunity to support the construction of semiconductor R&D facilities. USA’s vision for success are: leading-edge logic fabs, US-based fabs to produce high-volume memory chips, US to become home to advanced packaging technologies, and focus on current-generation and mature chips. One can easily expect lot of players in the USA’s semiconductor industry.\n\nFocus on chiplets\n\nAs per Jean-Christophe Eloy, Yole, main driver for chiplets are creating opportunities for new markets. There are higher silicon yields on smaller dies. New and specific solutions will tag along with chiplet technologies. There are many collaboration initiatives to standardize the chiplet ecosystem.\n\nWe are also seeing the segmentation of packaging families. The architectures today include flip chip, embedded die, 2.5D/3D, and emerging, for advanced packaging. Traditional packaging includes wire bond.\n\nAccording to William Chen, Chair of the Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap (HIR) initiative, and Fellow, ASE Group, the key to further promoting development of chiplet ecosystem lies in transferring research results of the industry to the educational system.\n\nAsia the leader!\n\nAsia remains the leader regarding fabs by a very long distance. I don’t need to talk about TSMC and Samsung, or even SK Hynix. This region will continue to consolidate its position over the next few years. There will be multiple deployments across countries.\n\nCompound semiconductors (CS) are present everywhere! RF, power, photonics, display and lighting, from components to applications, need them. There is strong diversity of technology platforms and substrates. Applications range from photonics, such as EELs and VCSELs, to LED lighting and display, RF, and power. Taiwan has a complete ecosystem for GaN. The compound semiconductor ecosystem is also great.\n\nTSMC is looking to start fabs in Europe. And now, there are reports of Singapore offering TSMC generous infrastructure subsidies. Let’s wait and watch this space.\n\nAnd, India?\n\nI read with mixed feelings that India lacks talent for chip manufacturing. India requires 10-13k resources by 2027, as per Ministry of Electronics and IT Scientist ‘E’, Prashant Kumar. Also, it seems, folks from Indian IT hardware industry are leading India’s semiconductor push. That’s fine, so long as they can get the job done.\n\nIndia needs to focus on parts of the chip value chain, besides the chip fab. Chip design and assembling, testing and packaging, should be segments of interest. Fabs require significant annual investments. It is very complex, with very high failure rates. Has any provision been made for all this? I don’t recall reading anything about this. It was all very interesting, back in 2004. Those interested can read my discussion with Dr. Wally Rhines. Or, look at the EDN Roundtable from 2004, and from 2005. Lots of fabs are also coming up in the USA. The world may have a surplus of fab capacity soon.\n\nIt seems $10 billion is a small amount to invest in India’s semiconductor industry. Leading-edge nodes can be expensive. Previous time plans for getting semiconductor fabs in India happened was in 2007-08. Back then, the opposition had come up with its own state policy for Karnataka. In 2013, plans were aborted as there were no investors. Another attempt in 2017 failed. All this, before, the chip shortage happened!\n\nIndia can do well by also looking at fab deployments elsewhere. Indian government seems to be pursuing this sector like it has done with IT. Please note: semiconductor is a very different beast! A semiconductor’s resistivity falls as the temperature rises. And, metals behave in the opposite way.\n\nIndia looks to start at 28nm. Does that hold up against newer nodes? TSMC, UMC, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and SMIC, Hua Hong, are in this field. What about the other nodes? Let’s see! Eg., 14nm will require high-K metal gates. At advanced 10nm, only three semiconductor foundries are there: Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. Next, 7nm leads to 20 percent better performance and 40 percent power reduction, compared to 10nm. TSMC and Samsung started volume production of 5nm chips in 2020. In May 2022, TSMC announced it developed key features of the 1-nm process node in collaboration with MIT and NTU.\n\nTSMC has CoWoS-S platform that provides best-in-breed performance and highest integration density for HPC applications. CoWoS-R is a member of CoWoS advanced packaging family leveraging integrated fan-out (InFO) wafer level packaging to use redistribution layer (RDL) interposer, and serve the interconnect between chiplets, especially in high bandwidth memory (HBM) and SoC heterogeneous integration.\n\nCoWoS-L, is one of the chip-last packages in TSMC CoWoS platform, combining merits of CoWoS-S and InFO technologies to provide the most flexible integration using interposer with local silicon interconnect (LSI) chip for die-to-die interconnect and RDL layers for power and signal delivery.\n\nSimply having a semiconductor fab, for the heck of it, is definitely not going to cut corners. Technology moves very fast. There are multiple, unaddressed challenges ahead. HKMG, scaling, lithography, transistor architecture, interlayer dielectric, reticle and wafer inspection, etc. I believe most of these are in the 20/22nm node. As you go deeper, there are more of the same!\n\nOn the Internet, it says: semiconductors possess specific electrical properties. A substance that conducts electricity is a conductor, and a substance that does not conduct electricity is an insulator. Semiconductors are substances with properties somewhere between them. Electrical properties are indicated by resistivity.\n\nDarling, you definitely need to be aware that a semiconductor fab requires significant annual investments, and has very high failure rates! I hope the headline attracts the readers! 😉\n\nState of global electronic design automation market (EDA) today\n\nAt the ongoing SEMI Silicon Valley and Northeast Chapters conference, Jay Vleeschhouwer, Software Research, Griffin Securities, presented on the state of EDA: A view from Wall Street.\n\nThe combined enterprise values of Cadence Design and Synopsys are ≈$112 billion, or more than 11x combined estimated revenues for 2023 and 10.5x estimated 2024 revenues. Six years ago, the combined enterprise values of Cadence, Synopsys and Mentor was ≈$23 billion (prior to the acquisition of Mentor by Siemens).\n\nThe material increase in value has been sustained by a combination of bookings growth, including growth across multiple product categories; increasing backlog; increasing operating income (up 155 percent over the past half-decade), and increasing operating cash flow (up 170 percent over the past half-decade).\n\nWe estimate that EDA industry revenue increased by 12.5-13 percent in 2022 to over $11.7 billion. Based on our estimate for Ansys, Cadence, and Synopsys, the industry could increase by high-single-digits in 2023, or more, depending on Siemens EDA.\n\nAnsys, Cadence, and Synopsys, could increase by high single-digits in 2023, or more, depending on Siemens EDA. The big two — Cadence and Synopsys — accounted for over 70 percent of the estimated industry in 2022. Mentor, or Siemens EDA has sustained its pre-acquisition share of 1/5th of the industry revenues.\n\nThe big four — Cadence, Synopsys, Ansys, and Mentor — account for over 90 percent of the industry revenues. In 2023, we estimate Cadence revenue will rise 4 percent to $3.67 billion. Synopsys will rise over 13 percent to $5.24 billion. Ansys EDA business will increase by 7-8 percent to over $400 million. Siemens EDA business model remains one of upfront revenue.\n\nThe industry has continued to consolidate. Cadence and Synopsys – the big two – accounted for ≈70 percent of the estimated industry revenues in 2022, as compared with ≈65 percent three years ago, and 57-58 percent a decade ago. Mentor has largely sustained its pre-acquisition share of one-fifth of industry revenues, or very nearly one-fifth, with the exception of 2022.\n\nBig two rule!\n\nThe combined big two EDA bookings were $8.86 billion in 2022, down slightly from 2021, resulting in a three-year CAGR of 20 percent. We are estimating $8.1-$8.2 billion for 2023, and more than $9.6 billion by 2025 – consistent with an expectation of better than mid-single-digit bookings growth and continued increases in backlog.\n\nThe combined big two backlog was more than $12.7 billion as of the end of 2022, up over $4.6 billion since 2019. We are estimating as much as $13 billion by the end of 2023. One of the most important product mix changes over the past 5-10 years has been the growth of hardware-based verification (emulation and prototyping).\n\nThe combined Cadence-Synopsys hardware revenues were nearly $850 million in 2022, a new high, more than doubling from 2019, in addition where the combined EDA IP revenues were ≈$1.75 billion in 2022 (≈20 percent of combined revenue), vs. less than $1.1 billion in 2019, and less than ≈$450 million a decade ago. The big two core EDA revenues were $5.65 billion in 2022, up 15 percent, resulting in a three-year CAGR of 13 percent.\n\nCombined EDA big two operating income in 2022 was $3.11 billion, or 35.7 percent of revenues, vs. $1.574 billion in 2019, or 27.6 percent of revenues. Increase in operating income and operating margin has been one of the most important structural changes\n\nin the financial profile of the big two. For 2023, we are estimating combined income of $3.51 billion, or 36.5 percent of the estimated revenues, and $4.69 billion by 2025, or ≈41 percent of the estimated revenue.\n\nCombined EDA bookings were $8.86 billion in 2022, down slightly from 2021, with a three-year CAGR of 20 percent. We are estimating $8.1-$8.2 billion for 2023, and over $9.6 billion by 2025 – consistent with an expectation of better than mid-single-digit bookings growth and continued increases in backlog. Combined big two backlog is estimated to be $13 billion by end of 2023.\n\nThe ongoing demand across multiple product categories by both semiconductor and systems customers has been fundamentally conducive to EDA revenue growth. This phenomenon is very likely to continue!\n\nAccording to industry data, “IC implementation”, “synthesis”, “RTL simulation”, “analog/mixed-signal simulation”, “analysis”, “custom layout”, and “hardware-based verification” have each had multiple consecutive periods of growth on a trailing-twelve-month (TTM) basis . “Physical verification” and “PCB” have trended higher, but can be inconsistent due to the mostly upfront revenue model. Siemens remains the largest by revenue in these two categories, each among the largest in EDA.\n\nEach of the EDA big four – Synopsys, Cadence, Mentor, and Ansys – participates in at least two of the growing categories.\n\nTwo arms races underway\n\nThere are two arms races underway in technology — software development and silicon development. Investments in silicon development – by semiconductor companies, still the majority of EDA revenues, and the always important class of “systems” companies, e.g., Apple, Microsoft, – are dependent upon EDA’s role as a source of essential technologies and services, and are sustaining the EDA industry’s revenue, income, and cash flow momentum.\n\nEDA industry growth has been sustained by growing demand among multiple EDA tool categories – as compared with earlier periods of more narrowly based growth. This has been, and is likely to remain, an important phenomenon, supported by the\n\ngrowth of semiconductor R&D budgets and systems customer product engineering budgets. These customer investments are in turn sustaining, and enabled by, EDA investments in R&D:\n\nIn 2022, combined Cadence-Synopsys R&D was $2.99 billion (≈34 percent of the revenues), vs. $2.116 billion in 2019, and $1.06 billion a decade ago. Cumulative combined R&D over the past half-decade was $12.1 billion. We are estimating $3.3 billion for 2023 and more than $3.65 billion by 2025.\n\nOne key change has been growth of hardware-based verification, including emulation and prototyping. Combined EDA IP revenues in 2022 were over $1.75 billion. Big two core EDA revenue was $5.65 billion in 2022, up 15 percent, with three-year CAGR of 13 percent. For 2023, we are estimating combined income of $3.51 billion, or 36.5 percent of estimated revenues, and $4.68 billion by 2025, or 41 percent of estimated revenues.\n\nThe ongoing demand across multiple product categories by semiconductor and systems customers has been conducive to EDA revenue growth, and that will continue. TTM also increased by product category. The leading category here is custom layout, with IC implementation, and PCB close behind.\n\nSemiconductor R&D has shown growth. A composite of two dozen semiconductor companies showed total R&D of more than $63.8 billion in 2022, up 16 percent. Intel accounted for ≈28 percent of this total. Total R&D spending, excluding Intel, was up 16 percent in 2022, to more than $46.3 billion. AMD’s proforma R&D increased by 29 percent, Intel’s by 15 percent, NXP’s by 11 percent, Nvidia’s by 39 percent, ST’s by 10 percent, Qualcomm’s by 14 percent, and Renesas’ by almost 14 percent.\n\nIntel’s commercial EDA spending – over $700 million last year – accounts for as much as a high-single-digit percent of EDA industry revenues. About three-fourths of its spending is with Synopsys, plus Cadence, Siemens and Ansys, etc. R&D begets bookings and backlog.\n\nPerspectives in semiconductors: cycles, technologies, and outlooks\n\nDan Hutcheson, Vice Chair, TechInsights, presented perspectives in semiconductors: cycles, technologies, and outlooks. Has the silicon cycle moderated? Demand side is driven by Keynes acceleration principle. Supply is driven by technology and lags in the supply chain. Large production ramp-ups precede downturns is questionable.\n\nThe inventory amplitude drives IC ASP volatility. As do wafer size and cleanroom revolution. TSMC was the early adopter, and became universal with 300mm fabs. There has also been 20+ years of improved inventory control. Hence, there has been lower cycle-city. The 200mm holiday is now over. More than Moore capacity expansion is matching More Moore. More than Moore is no longer a friction source. Everything that could be integrated has been integrated. Average long-term growth forecast has been 5 percent for electronics, 7 percent for IC, etc.\n\nWhere will be in 10 years? We will be at $1.3 trillion revenue for semiconductors. We will need to double the number of fabs, as well as the number of people working. Smart automotive is the new queen of the market. EVs have ~2X ICE chip content. EVs are growing at ~12X.\n\nWe are forecasting the global semiconductor industry for 2023 to close at $581 billion, a dip by 6 percent over 2022. We had huge shortage in automotive chips during 2020-21. We are now seeing the same for memory chips. We had an inventory glut in 2022.\n\nWe are now on the path to a trillion dollars in a decade. IC supply/demand has held in tight conditions. At present, electronics retail prices have been falling. For semiconductor fabs, there are plans to add ~25 percent of the current capacity. Also, customer complaints regarding the inventory about extreme shortages were sign of multiple bookings. We now need to be cautious about a double dip in 2024-25, as well as inflation and hoarding.\n\nStandards evolve to incorporate emerging technology: DVCon India 2022\n\nDesign and Verification Conference (DVCon) India 2022 was recently held in Bangalore, India. Dave Rich, Verification Architect, Siemens EDA, presented a keynote on the emerging design / verification technologies and standards–which comes first?\n\nWhy do we have standards? It is more than just layers of bureaucracy! It can promote efficient use of resources, and see that you do not keep re-inventing the same wheel. There is communication – languages, protocols, common terminology, with focus on public health and safety, process and tracking, understanding the value of competing solutions, share qualifying metrics, etc. Besides, competition promotes innovation!\n\nThere are challenges in developing standards. To gain interest/momentum, we need to identify clear goals. For achieving consensus, we need to use existing technology, and develop by committee. We need to ensure that feature creep does not step in, making a standard look overly complex and lacking stability. It should not be too long to publish and becomes obsolete. He referred to a NASA example from 1999, where the cost of not following standards, or not agreeing on which standard to adopt can be astronomical.\n\nToday, we have new technologies with practical applications largely unrealized, vs. the continuing development of existing technology. There is a dilemma between innovation and stability.\n\nThere has to be investments in the ecosystem. It can be in capital – systems used to build/test/manufacture, content – existing IP available for re-use, training and education – time and people resources, compatibility – migration effort, and confidence. He gave an example of SystemVerilog.\n\nNew technology is not always a new standard. Standards evolve to incorporate emerging technology. It is difficult to get people together with cross-disciplinary knowledge. E.g., low-power concerns cut across many technology domains, such as simulation, synthesis, mixed signal interfaces, and clock/reset domain crossing.\n\nAnalog verification has emerged a as technical challenge. We can use digital verification techniques in real number modeling. This can be across constrained randomization, functional coverage, and assertions. Standardizations efforts are across Verilog-AMS, SystemVerilog-AMS, SystemC-AMS, UVM-AMS, and VHDL-AMS.\n\nImpact of AI/ML to real productivity boost is not yet measurable! ML is not a panacea to any problem!! Accellera and UCIS made a great start to coverage standards. Momentum had waned due to lack of customer demand. ML needs lots of data for training.\n\nOther emerging technologies with standards concerns include functional safety, with fault modeling across different domains (dynamic vs. formal) and lifecycle management. Also, there is encryption, with cryptography not the weakest link in security. There are constraints for clock and reset domain crossings, where IP needs a common language to go with the descriptions.\n\nStandards participation at Siemens EDA has been going well. There are functional safety: Accellera and IEEE P2851 Functional Safety Working Groups, Accellera IP Security and IEEE 1735 Working Groups, IEEE 1801 Design and Verification of Low-Power, Energy-Aware Systems (UPF), IEEE 1800 SystemVerilog Hardware Design and Verification Language Standard, IEEE 1076 VHDL Hardware Design Language Standard, IEEE 1066 SystemC Language Standard and several Accellera SystemC Working Groups, IEEE 1800.2 UVM Standard and Accellera UVM Working Groups, Accellera Portable Stimulus Working Group, and Accellera UVM-AMS Working Group, respectively.\n\nOld or new technology is always evolving. We need to balance revolution and evolution. We can appreciate the value of standards to the users. Vendors also co-operate on standards — and compete on technology.\n\nLooking back at semicon / tech in 2021!\n\nWe have finally reached the end of 2021! Let’s have a look at some of the breath-taking moments from the global semiconductor and technology industry during the year.\n\nIn January 2021, Dr. Anthony Fauci called for remembering Covid-19 lessons at PMWC 2021. I was invited by Dr. Leroy Hood, SVP and Chief Science Officer, Providence St. Joseph Health, Chief Strategy Officer, Co-founder, and Professor, Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), and Co-Program Chair, PMWC 2021. Dr. Fauci was presented the luminary award.\n\nMalcolm Penn, Future Horizons, UK, predicted the global semiconductor market to grow 18 percent in 2021. Scotten Jones, President, IC Knowledge LLC, presented on logic leadership in PPAC era at ISS 2021. AI processors were said to be driving innovations in advanced packaging, as per Jean-Christophe Eloy, CEO and President, Yole Développement. At ISS 2021, semiconductor and equipment recovery were said to be on track for 2021.\n\nCome February 2021, and Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) had a session on memory semiconductors market and technology trends. At SEMI Flex 2021, there was a panel discussion on sustainability and power for batteries. There was a session on electronics for the brain, and another on liquid electronics for stretchable conductors. Next, European 5G Conference 2021 had a session on key drivers for 6G. IHS Markit presented on autonomous sensors and future apps. Erik Collart, Edwards, came up with an enlightening talk on smart manufacturing in More-than-Moore era at the SEMI Technology Unites summit. Embedded computing with image sensors was another.\n\nDr. Wally Rhines, CEO, Cornami gave his views on why FHE was ultimate for cyber security. Quantum computing is going to be next game changer. At an SIA summit, it was predicted that the global semiconductor industry could be worth trillion dollars by 2036. Elsewhere, in Europe, CEA-Leti has big bets on silicon-based quantum computing. It was announced IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS), will be held virtually in March 2021.\n\nBill Gates said green premium is metric that says you are on to success in 2050 at CERAWeek by IHS Markit 2021. In March 2021, there was a conference on RISC-V, and how China can reduce risks. Semiconductor outlook 2021 — navigating through turbulent times, came next, by SEMI. At the Technology Week Summit organized by SEMI, SAW/BAW filters, and future materials technology for new filters were discussed, which took me back to my days at Global Sources, Hong Kong, as were technological challenges for MOS HEMT GaN power devices. IRPS 2021 discussed memory’s journey towards future ICT world, and reliability of SiC MOSFETS. SEMI organized a conference on semiconductor outlook 2021 — navigating through turbulent times.\n\nIn April, I received shocking news. We lost Shankar Ghosh, or Keshtoda, to Covid-19! He was my guru from my young days. I recall my first ever article, at 14, published by him at Pragati Manjusha, Allahabad. Just a week back, we had lost Bachchu, or Subhash Ghosh, his younger brother. There was another very sad loss of Buluda, or Arun Chakravorty, our brother-in-law and a very close friend, due to Covid-19.\n\nNext, USA started strengthening microelectronics supply chains, and with the CHIPS Act in place, looks well set to do so. The White House said: Resilient American supply chains will revitalize and rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity, maintain America’s competitive edge in research and development, and create well-paying jobs.

We may get to hear more about FHE in the coming year. Perhaps, Tesla will come up with new factories, pursue energy and software, and grow even bigger.\n\nDVCon India 2021: Are respins a fact of life?\n\nThere was a panel discussion at the ongoing DVCon India 2021, titled: Are respins a fact of life? The participants were Harry Foster, Chief Scientist Verification for Design Verification Technology Division, Siemens EDA, Sumit Goswami, Senior Director Of Engineering, Hardware Application Engineering, Qualcomm, Amar Deep Punhani, Director – AMP Digital IP India, NXP, and Malay Vyas, Senior Director Systems Engineering, ARM. Pradeep Salla, DVCon India Chair, was the moderator.\n\nWhile designs are complex, verification strategies haven’t remained static. What needs to change for respins? How do we control costs? Harry Foster, Siemens EDA, said that quality cannot be inspected into a product. It must be built in from the beginning. Cost multipliers include finding and fixing a bug at various development stages. We can improve RTL quality while reducing bug density with intent-focused insight. We need to produce, prove, and protect. We can prevent bugs through high-level language (HLL) design. We can qualitatively show projects mature in their verification process do better. RTL quality can be improved through intent-focused insight.\n\nAmar Deep Punhani, NXP, noted that respins cannot be a fact of life! Cost of defects are way too high. We need a holistic view to improve quality and better tooling. We can control digital costs. We must focus on system-level co-design and co-verification. Hardware and software teams must be talking the same language. The pre-silicon solutions are key — emulation and FPGA. We need to focus on mix-signals in test chips. We need effective 3×5 WHYs for technical and systemic at engineering level. EDA industry must step up, and must use AI/ML solutions.\n\nIt is a design and verification problem today. Both teams have to step up to resolve the challenge. Correct by construct is the mantra. going forward. Verification is the schedule and cost driver. We need to have right skillsets in place. Tools also have a long way to go.\n\nMalay Vyas, ARM, said optimal quality, schedule, and cost go together. Is your design special- or general-purpose? We need to be very clear. Respins are probable-listic. We can try increasing the density in the early part of the design. Can I go and find ways to take out the killer bugs, especially, memory coherency. Formal verification is showing some promise. We can correct design by intent. Design and verification go hand-in-hand.\n\nSumit Goswami, Qualcomm, added that we have been designing hardware for long. We also have software ecosystem. Once we innovate, we need to ensure they are both working properly. We need to verify each program on the platform. We need to validate very early in the cycle. Today, power efficiency is also key. Power manager can also create some complications. Power verification can become a challenge. Today, respins are a reality. We also have safety and security parameters. We can do fixed functional designs better today. We need to isolate bugs from software testing. We need to look at putting a feature to block a bug. Thanks to programmability, we can do this. We need to design a chip that can be productized at the first tape-out. Lot of IPs today are incremental in nature. Design and verification is a balanced game. Both have lot of scope for improvement.\n\nOpportunity for tools\n\nHarry Foster, Siemens EDA, said a good project always tries to find bugs upfront. Amar Deep Punhani, NXP, said design plays an extremely important role. Design partitioning is very important. We need to do things more intelligently and focus on right areas. Tools also have an opportunity for improvement, and help designers resolve issues early on. Malay Vyas, ARM, said the need to shift left has to happen across. We need to create denser events into parts. We need to shift appropriately.\n\nIn software, is it possible to achieve re-use? Sumit Goswami, Qualcomm, said we standardized tests, and have certain amount of VIP. IPs can be re-used sometimes. Differentiation exists in the market. Industry bodies can try standardizing some of the IPs. He was skeptical on whether they can be standardized within a chip. Amar Deep Punhani, NXP, added that IP re-use is a must-have today. We also need VIPs.\n\nFinally, how is the intelligent edge progressing? Malay Vyas, ARM, said edge compute is fairly new. We have lot of things to learn. The domain demands lot more software. EDA tools can probably help. We should start building newer tools. Harry Foster, Siemens EDA, said the dream is to take the IPs, and put it together. We have distributed state machines. This is an opportunity for new developments and tools. We need smarter tools, in combination with emulation.\n\nPunhani agreed we need more intelligent coverage and more ML. Vyas added there is an opportunity for ML to get into tooling, especially for processors. Foster said we are lacking appropriate fault models at system levels. We need to have more such models.\n\nAutomotive functional safety experiencing disruption\n\nSiemens EDA Verification Forum 2021, held recently, focused on automotive functional safety. Ms. Ann Keffer, FuSa Project Management, Siemens EDA, gave her perspective on the future of automotive and its impact on safety.\n\nMega drivers\n\nAutomotive will continue to experience rapid changes and disruption. OEMs are expanding into SoC and systems, They are defending the ownership of E/E architecture. Tier 1 players are under pressure to move up and down. They are expanding to IC (front/back-end). Semiconductor players are building SoCs, SIPs, and boards, and developing app-level software.\n\nThere is massive data explosion. The road to autonomous vehicles are creating data-heavy use models. This requiring more advanced nodes. E/E architecture is undergoing revolution. There are distributed and independent ECUs and central gateways with dedicated hardware on Ethernet backbone.\n\nElectronics and software are driving structural changes in the automotive world. Smart mobility is driving changes. IC companies are moving upwards, delivering flexible SoC platforms. Disruption is pressuring tier 1 players to seek new areas. Data explosion is driving new compute paradigms. Neural networks are now the foundation for soft learning. They are fueled by massive amount of training data. Different types of compute architecture have to be brought together to optimize the data.\n\nRoad to autonomous includes AI, heterogenous compute, and communication to everything, which is creating data-heavy use models. There are more centralized architectures, sensor overloads, and real-time threats. Automotive also needs to function properly and safely. Massive amounts of data must be brought together for processing and decision-making. Disrupted compute is being centralized and brought to domain-level compute. To handle heavy-duty use models, advanced nodes are a must. They can improve the performance, power, and capacity.\n\nCentralized architectures are seeing a migration from ECU to DCU, and further. We are seeing big change in vehicle architecture. Gen 1 had distributed and independent ECUs. Gen 2 will see connected ECUs. Gen 3 will have central gateway connecting ECUs, and cross-functional connectors. Gen 4 will have central gateway connecting DCUs, cost optimizations, with the ability to handle complex functions. Gen 5 will have central gateway with dedicated hardware on Ethernet backbone, and complex functions with high-performance compute.\n\nSoftware-driven architecture\n\nThe next-generation EE automotive architectures are converging, and will be software-driven. This simplifies software, and enables OTA and app downloads. It is scalable from low- to high-end models, supports L5 autonomy, IVI and V2X. There will be fewer suppliers, leading to more in-house and control. Sensors will become edge processors, reducing network traffic.\n\nChallenges for automotive IC developers\n\nThere are several technological challenges to this evolution of automotive E/E architecture. Sensing and compute are not quite ready for prime time. The IC developers are getting standardized to ISO 26262.\n\nNext-generation of automotive ICs necessitate a paradigm shift. ADAS, AV, and EV, deliver new challenges to IC teams. They are looking at the architecture and design to enable heterogenous compute, as well as functional testing. They need to achieve safety, and do lifecycle management and supply chain integration.\n\nThere are challenges across the safety lifecycle, such as increased process and governance, traceability to everything, efficient safety analysis, fault campaign across millions of nodes, etc. Makers need to plan, define, implement, prove, and deliver.\n\nPath to compliance\n\nWe need to drive down the risk of malfunctioning due to failures. These include systematic, random, and malicious faults. They cover ISO 26262, SOTIF ISO 21448, and cyber security ISO 21434, respectively. Cyber security looks at encryption vulnerabilities, denial of service, and untrusted ICs. Functional safety’s goal is to ensure systems are free of verifiable malfunctions and faults.\n\nThere is the path to compliance and ISO 26262 certification. This involves random fault analysis, systematic fault analysis, lifecycle management, and services. The automotive silicon supplier needs to achieve fail safety, zero defect, compliance, and guidance. Developing safety-critical ICs are a must. Automotive ICs need to operate correctly and fail safely. You have to define safety rules and mechanisms.\n\nDigital journey\n\nSiemens EDA has developed the Xcelerator, the catalyst for digital enterprise. It is an integrated portfolio of software, services, and an app development platform. It speeds up digital transformation cycle, and unlocks a powerful industrial network effect. There can be a comprehensive digital twin, that is personalized, adaptable, and modern. There is a flexible open ecosystem.\n\nSiemens delivers digital twin capabilities across the supply chain, from chip, to vehicle, to city. There are models of silicon IP, in a virtual vehicle network, and tested in a virtual city environment. Siemens delivers solutions and integrations across the supply chain.\n\nSilicon lifecycle challenges and expanding role of test: ITC India 2020\n\nBrady Benware, VP & GM Silicon Lifecycle Solutions, Mentor, A Siemens Business, delivered a keynote on “Silicon Lifecycle Challenges and the Expanding Role of Test”, at the ongoing ITC India 2020.\n\nThere is a new context for ICs. It is creating tremendous social benefit. The global smart cities market is expanding at a CAGR of 19 percent. It is expected to reach $189.5 billion in 2023. There will be challenges involved. Traditional challenges will continue, such as 5nm to 3nm change. There is system technology co-optimization (STCO) as well.\n\nWorldwide fabless semiconductor company funding has been dominated by AI apps. The others are communications/high speed and 5G, silicon photonics, MEMS and sensors, etc. There is the Cerebras wafer scale engine for AI apps.\n\nMore of human experience and wellness depends today on electronics. We are getting to a situations where we no longer look at them as an inconvenience. Functional safety in IC designs is increasing. IC designs with functional safety has increased from 48 percent in 2016 to 59 percent in 2018. Security concerns are also increasing. Vulnerabilities also have serious financial ramifications, even when they are never exploited.\n\nThere are two test innovation vectors to meet full lifecycle requirements. There is greater complexity as more design-for-test occurs, and increasing lifecycle requirements as design for more-than-test happens. There are also growing challenges with static test bandwidth allocation. Programmable bandwidth eliminates the trade-off. Adapter nodes decouple core and top DFT requirements. It enables additional compression. More gates and pins drive the new test access requirements.\n\nHigh bandwidth scan test can be done for leveraging high speed IOs (SERDES). Comprehensive safety subsystems are also available. You can detect and respond to degradations. Advanced automotive features require faster testing. More efficient LBIST is needed for lifecycle management.\n\nSecurity and optimization challenges require more than structural monitoring. There are functional monitoring areas as well, such as hardware or software bugs, malicious attacks, use-case and workload surprises.\n\nSiemens has acquired UltraSOC, to be part of Mentor’s Tessent product family, for silicon lifecycle management. Embedded analytics is a separate subsystem today. There are non-intrusive, hardware-based analytics, and provide broad visibility to analyze software and system, everywhere in the SoC. You can design for function, and augment for deployment. There is lifecycle resilience and optimization.\n\nThe test community is the right community to tackle the lifecycle challenges. It can innovate within the expanded role. You need pass/fail and insightful data, structural risks and functional risks, and standalone and statistical. There are exciting times ahead with the expanding role of test."
