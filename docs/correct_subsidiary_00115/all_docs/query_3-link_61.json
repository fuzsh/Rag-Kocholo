I left feeling motivated and excited to start on new projects at work. It even gave me time to think about projects I was currently working on and gave me time away from the computer to sketch and really allow myself time to brainstorm – something I know we all worry about spending too much time on.\n\n— Ashlee Ritschdorff | Graphic Designer, Federal Signal\n\nSo much inspiration and professional experience in one place. I can honestly say How Design Live 2019 has refilled my creative bucket. This is a must-attend event for all creatives and marketing professionals.\n\n— Joe Stern | Creative Director NAVC\n\nThis was my first show and I definitely received more than I expected. There were many tips, and exercises thrown around that hold a lot of weight. As a graphic web designer, I forgot how much I love actual design. This show really inspired me to get back in touch with what I love.\n\n— Frank Dyszler | Web Designer, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThis design conference was exactly what I needed at this point in my career! As a freelancer, I have been feeling isolated and stagnant. It was the shot in the arm that I needed to get motivated. The experience of “being with my people” was so inspiring. I look forward to attending the 2020 conference!\n\n— Julie Lyrek | Freelancer, Lyrek Creative\n\nThe Community\n\nHOW Design Live is where inspiration, community and creativity converge in a 3-day event that you can’t afford to miss.
