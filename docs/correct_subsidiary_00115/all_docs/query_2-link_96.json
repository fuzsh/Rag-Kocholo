Fixing HTML for /zin/pubs/qformal10.2/htmldocs. Copying conversion reports to dev/qf10.2/LOG. Checking for Warnings. Found 3 warnings. Updating master build report. . . . Code snippets $_ = `p4 -c cshaw-build sync -p $depot/$dir/... 2>&1 |tee -a $log2`; if ($? != 0 or /can't sync/s){ print LOG1 \"(Error: sync failed.

It offers a simple mechanism for checking documents out and in. Interfacing with Perforce and the document depots through Perl is easy and efficient. The visual Perforce application (P4V) provides an elegant interface for writers and other authors to use as a cockpit for their documentation management tasks."
