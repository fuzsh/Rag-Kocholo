Educators are taking the best of what we know about learning, student support, effective instruction, and interpersonal skill-building to completely reimagine schools so that students experience that kind of purposeful learning all day, every day.\n\nLearn More\n\nMentorship in middle and high school has the power to impact the course of students’ academic and personal life trajectories.\n\nMentorship in middle and high school has the power to impact the course of students’ academic and personal life trajectories. Human connection built on trust is the glue that binds students’ academic and personal lives and helps them make sense of their futures; it’s also the reason that most teachers enter education in the first place.\n\nOne of three foundational pillars of the Summit Learning Program, one-to-one mentorship allows all students a chance to meet with a dedicated teacher or school leader each week as part of their academic and personal development. Students meet with the same mentor year over year, providing them with a sense of continuity and allowing mentors to know students deeply.\n\n“With Summit, every child is mentored weekly… they have time with their teacher, and they are met where they’re at, which allows them to have that authentic dialogue,” says Principal Norma Penny with the Pasadena Independent School District (PISD) in Texas, which has implemented the Summit Learning Program in 23 schools across their district.\n\nSummit CEO and Co-Founder, Diane Tavenner, says through mentoring, teachers are able to reach all students. \"When I teach, I want to know my kids, I want to know what their hopes are. What I love about the opportunity for a whole school to be a personalized learning environment is that [desire] comes true… I can really invest in all of my students.\"\n\nThe benefits of mentorship are tangible for both students and teachers.\n\n3 Benefits of Mentorship for Students\n\nIndividualized Goal Setting: Meeting students where they are as developing individuals is where personalized learning begins. Each week, students meet with their mentors to assess their academic progress and to set individual short- and long-term goals, develop an action plan, and learn time management and planning strategies. This intentional, weekly interaction helps students develop a universal set of skills—goal setting, adaptability, and reflection—that are necessary for success in college, career, and life.\n\nRelationships Built on Trust: The reliable routine of mentorship allows students to build a relationship with their teachers built on honesty and trust over time. Dr. Pamela Cantor, founder of Turnaround for Children, reiterated the importance of these relationships of trust in a recent interview on the Summit Sparks podcast.\n\n“Can you imagine trying to build self-regulation or executive function in an environment where children did not feel physically and emotionally safe?” Cantor asked. “Children need to have that overall sense of safety in the environment and they need to have strong relationships with adults and peers to set the stage for the kind of learning that we want them to do.”\n\nMentors serve as a thought partner for students on their academic journey and help empower students to become autonomous learners and agents of their own change. They express understanding of students’ aspirations and fears, and support their success by acting as an advocate for students’ best interests.\n\nJacqueline Castro, a former 8th grade student at R.H. Lee Elementary in Chicago, described her mentor relationship: “Now that I have my mentor, it helps me a lot; if I ever have something on my mind and I can’t do my work, I just go to her and let it out and she’s there.”\n\nBuilding relationships with students includes alignment with home life, achieved through regular communication and periodic mentor-student meetings with parents and guardians.\n\nDeveloping Self-Awareness and Fostering Passions: An essential component of one-to-one mentoring sessions are weekly self-reflections, which give students the chance to build awareness around their ability to set and follow through on appropriate academic and social goals. Students who practice individual goal-setting and reflection over time are better able to accurately assess their strengths, as well as recognize and act on areas for self-improvement. Exploring personal interests goes hand-in-hand with identifying strengths, and students are encouraged by their mentors to explore ways in and out of schools — through clubs or community programs and projects — that will help build and expand these personal interests and passions.\n\n3 Benefits of Mentorship for Teachers\n\nReaching All Students: Mentorship offers a structured, consistent time and space for teachers to get to know the whole student, apart from a whole-class or even small-group setting.\n\n“That is the dream of every teacher — to be able to reach every single pair of eyes that are looking up at you, and give them the best education possible,” said Catherine Birch, a teacher with PISD.\n\nSustained knowledge of what’s happening with students on a social and emotional level, alongside performance in the classroom, sets teachers up for success when making informed decisions on best interventions for students who may be struggling.\n\nIn addition to the personal connections made during one-to-one meetings, mentors have access to content assessment data for each of their mentees and can collaborate with other grade-level teachers to better set learning goals across subjects for students.\n\nKathleen Bourret, an English teacher at Lee Elementary School in Chicago and Castro’s former mentor, described the benefits of acting as a coach in the classroom: “Students have somebody to say ‘What is your goal today? What are you going to work on? What’s your focus?’ [Someone] to be a thought partner in their curriculum.”\n\nOpening Doors to Possibilities: Through mentorship, educators have a unique opportunity to help open doors to future academic and career possibilities and cultivate a student’s Sense of Purpose. Regardless of their academic achievements, all students have an authentic sense of curiosity to understand the world. Knowing each student’s interests, strengths, and goals allows mentors to encourage students to engage in school- or community-based activities that help build skills toward a known passion, or to try new activities and expand a student’s self-awareness and sense of self-efficacy.\n\nA More Rewarding Teaching Experience: A significant part of mentorship is helping students develop Habits of Success, the dispositions, mindsets, and behaviors that students need to make a successful transition from high school to college and careers. Just as students are more likely to succeed in school when they’ve had opportunities to develop life skills such as self-directed learning and a growth mindset, educators who explicitly help students develop these habits are more likely to be successful in impacting every student.\n\nBirch says that through mentoring, she can now “reach every single pair of eyes” in her classroom like she dreamed of.\n\n“It not only challenges them, but it challenges me,” Birch says. “I have grown more as a person in these last three years being a personalized learning teacher… I will never go back to the traditional classroom.”\n\nRelated Post\n\nLearning and Leading Together: The Growth of the Mentor Teacher - 3 key strategies from experienced mentor teachers for mentoring students and new teachers.\n\n​Lauren Faggella\n\nContent Marketing Manager, Summit Public Schools\n\nLauren Faggella is Content Marketing Manager for Summit Public Schools."
