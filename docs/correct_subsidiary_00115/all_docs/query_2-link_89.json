Leidos focuses on internal career mobility, both for employee development as well as retention.\n\nThe dynamic nature of our work means that our employees may be faced with position reductions and reorganizations when a program ends, is re-competed, or otherwise modified.

Throughout our Performance Development process, leaders and employees are encouraged to solicit feedback about their direct reports and about themselves to provide for richer conversations and higher levels of performance.\n\nPerformance Development is an ongoing cycle, embedded into the business rhythm, focused on three components: Performance Planning – setting goals and expectations; Performance Check-Ins – touch points throughout the year to discuss progress against goals and expectations, provide feedback and coaching, and discuss career development; and Performance Assessment – a review at the end of the year. The Leidos Values are part of our performance goals for all employees. Those who manage people also have a People Leader Goal, outlining expectations for leaders. We require an annual formal documented performance review for all eligible employees e.g., non-temporary, those with the company for at least 90 days, those not covered by a different current subsidiary practice.\n\nTo monitor organizational health and to ensure that our employee engagement and retention efforts are successful, we have a comprehensive listening strategy. We conduct a quarterly pulse survey to a statistically significant sample of global employees. We regularly conduct a formal, global engagement survey to all employees, including subsidiaries. The surveys are confidential and conducted by an independent third party. Results are aggregated by business area and analyzed via a number of demographic elements. The analysis is shared with our board of directors and executive leadership team. All people leaders with 5 or more responses (for confidentiality) get direct access to the results and are asked to share those results with their respective teams. Action planning is conducted at all levels of the organization based on enterprise-wide themes that are shared with all employees. A cross-functional, employee-led action planning team identifies recommendations which are implemented enterprise wide. We communicate actions taken in response to the employee feedback through multiple channels, and continually use this information to improve our strategy and practices.\n\nTotal Rewards\n\nCompensation\n\nLeidos is committed to deliver competitive, market-driven pay that rewards key objectives tied to the long-term performance of the company, is supported by our core values and enhances shareholder value.
