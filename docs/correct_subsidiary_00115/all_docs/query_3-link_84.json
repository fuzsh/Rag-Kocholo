We have built a generic proof of concept malware for the intel architecture, Rakshasa, capable of infecting more than a hundred of different motherboards. The first net effect of Rakshasa is to disable NX permanently and remove SMM related fixes from the BIOS, resulting in permanent lowering of the security of the backdoored computer, even after complete earasing of hard disks and reinstallation of a new operating system. We shall also demonstrate that preexisting work on MBR subvertions such as bootkiting and preboot authentication software bruteforce can be embedded in Rakshasa with little effort. More over, Rakshasa is built on top of free software, including the Coreboot project, meaning that most of its source code is already public. This presentation will take a deep dive into Coreboot and hardware components such as the BIOS, CMOS and PIC embedded on the motherboard, before detailing the inner workings of Rakshasa and demo its capabilities. It is hoped to raise awareness of the security community regarding the dangers associated with non open source firmwares shipped with any computer and question their integrity. This shall also result in upgrading the best practices for forensics and post intrusion analysis by including the afore mentioned firmwares as part of their scope of work.\n\nTest Polarity: Detecting Positive and Negative Tests (FSE 2024)\n\nTest Polarity: Detecting Positive and Negative Tests (FSE 2024)Andre Hora\n\nPositive tests (aka, happy path tests) cover the expected behavior of the program, while negative tests (aka, unhappy path tests) check the unexpected behavior. Ideally, test suites should have both positive and negative tests to better protect against regressions. In practice, unfortunately, we cannot easily identify whether a test is positive or negative. A better understanding of whether a test suite is more positive or negative is fundamental to assessing the overall test suite capability in testing expected and unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we propose test polarity, an automated approach to detect positive and negative tests. Our approach runs/monitors the test suite and collects runtime data about the application execution to classify the test methods as positive or negative. In a first evaluation, test polarity correctly classified 117 tests as as positive or negative. Finally, we provide a preliminary empirical study to analyze the test polarity of 2,054 test methods from 12 real-world test suites of the Python Standard Library. We find that most of the analyzed test methods are negative (88%) and a minority is positive (12%). However, there is a large variation per project: while some libraries have an equivalent number of positive and negative tests, others have mostly negative ones.\n\nWaze vs. Google Maps vs. Apple Maps, Who Else.pdf\n\nWaze vs. Google Maps vs. Apple Maps, Who Else.pdfBen Ramedani\n\nLet’s face it, getting lost isn’t really part of the adventure anymore (unless you’re into that sort of thing!). Nowadays, a good navigation app is like your trusty compass, guiding you through busy city streets and winding country roads. But with so many options out there—from big names like Waze, Google Maps, and Apple Maps to some lesser-known contenders—choosing the right one can feel a bit overwhelming. Think about it: you're about to head out on a road trip, and the last thing you want is to end up in the middle of nowhere because you took a wrong turn. Or maybe you're just trying to navigate your daily commute without hitting every single red light. That's where a solid navigation app comes in handy. Google Maps is like the old reliable friend who knows every shortcut and scenic route. It's packed with features, from real-time traffic updates to detailed directions, making it a top choice for many. But then there's Waze, the social butterfly of navigation apps. It's all about community, with drivers sharing real-time updates on traffic, accidents, and even speed traps. It’s perfect if you want to feel like you’re part of a huge driving club, all working together to get everyone to their destination faster. And let’s not forget Apple Maps, which has come a long way since its rocky start. If you're deep into the Apple ecosystem, it's a seamless choice, integrating smoothly with all your devices and offering some pretty neat features like Flyover for 3D city views. But wait, there are also some underdog apps worth considering! Have you heard of MapQuest? It's still around and offers some great features, especially for planning long trips with multiple stops. Then there's HERE WeGo, which is fantastic for offline navigation—a real lifesaver if you're heading somewhere with spotty cell service. So, whether you're planning a cross-country adventure or just trying to find the quickest route to work, we’ll help you sift through these options. We’ll dive into what makes each app unique, their pros and cons, and ultimately, guide you to the perfect navigation app for your needs.

Have you ever tried to fix a bug where you just can’t understand what’s going on? This talk will give you practical steps to improve the observability of your Rails app, taking the time to understand and fix defects from hours or days to minutes. Rails 8 will bring an exciting new feature: built-in structured logging. This talk will delve into the transformative impact of structured logging on fixing bugs and saving engineers time. Structured logging, as a cornerstone of observability, offers a powerful way to handle logs compared to traditional text-based logs. This session will guide you through the nuances of structured logging in Rails, demonstrating how it can be used to gain better insights into your application’s behavior. This talk will be a practical, technical deep dive into how to make structured logging work with an existing Rails app. I talk about the Steps to Observable Software - a practical five step process for improving the observability of your Rails app.\n\nMonitoring the Execution of 14K Tests: Methods Tend to Have One Path that Is ...\n\nMonitoring the Execution of 14K Tests: Methods Tend to Have One Path that Is ...Andre Hora\n\nThe literature has provided evidence that developers are likely to test some behaviors of the program and avoid other ones. Despite this observation, we still lack empirical evidence from real-world systems. In this paper, we propose to automatically identify the tested paths of a method as a way to detect the method’s behaviors. Then, we provide an empirical study to assess the tested paths quantitatively. We monitor the execution of 14,177 tests from 25 real-world Python systems and assess 11,425 tested paths from 2,357 methods. Overall, our empirical study shows that one tested path is prevalent and receives most of the calls, while others are significantly less executed. We find that the most frequently executed tested path of a method has 4x more calls than the second one. Based on these findings, we discuss practical implications for practitioners and researchers and future research directions.\n\nUnlocking the Future of Artificial Intelligence\n\nUnlocking the Future of Artificial IntelligencedorinIonescu\n\nUnlock the Future: Dive into AI Today!
