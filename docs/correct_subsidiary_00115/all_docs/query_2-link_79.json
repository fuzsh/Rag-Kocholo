        "text": "Reading 360 will provide optional grants and resources to help more Tennessee students develop strong phonics-based reading skills by supporting districts, teachers, and families.\n\nThroughout Tennessee and across the country, national experts, directors of schools, elected officials, and various stakeholders are encouraged by this bold approach to support literacy in Tennessee.\n\nIf you want to stay involved, follow along on social media using the hashtag #Reading360.\n\nTennessee Universal Reading Screener\n\nThe department is excited to offer a free and optional Tennessee Universal Reading Screener suite of tools for the launch of the 2021-2022 school year. As part of the Tennessee Literacy Success Act, districts are required to administer an approved universal reading screener to all students in grades K-3 during three administration windows each school year, and report data to the state department.\n\nWhile districts have the option to select a universal reading screener from the State Board of Educationâ€™s approved list to meet the requirements of the Tennessee Literacy Success Act, the free Tennessee Universal Reading Screener meets all of the legislative requirements, can be used at no-cost by districts and charter schools, and also resolves any data submission requirements for the district.\n\naimswebPlus has received the contract to provide the free Tennessee Universal Reading Screener suite of math and reading screeners, assessment platform, as well as a district training series.
