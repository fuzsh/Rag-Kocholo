He engages internal and external stakeholders by ensuring data is reflected accurately across the board, contracts are fully executed, developing internal systems that ensure expenses and revenues are tracked accurately towards departmental budgets, as well as masquerading as a Swiss army knife regarding his business acumen, interpersonal skills, and overall approach to his career.\n\nOutside of MENTOR, you can find Devon enjoying his passion for music as a professional drummer. He leads his own collective called The Modular Troupe, plays drums for Silver Arrow & Speechless Music, two local wedding bands that serve the New England area, is lead drummer for the Boston based hardcore band Move BHC, drummer for local Boston R&B band Black Owned, as well as countless other endeavors previously and concurrently.\n\nHaving two careers has allowed Devon to be able to find convergences where he can apply his musical skills to being an Accountant and be creative in the systems and processes that are created at MENTOR National, while applying discipline and business acumen to him being a professional musician and independent contractor. These two sentences encapsulate his sentiments today:\n\n“I am immensely grateful to have found myself where I am in my life today to be able to make an impact across the country and world in countless ways. I certainly do not take it for granted!”\n\nJake Sullivan\n\nTraining Delivery Manager\n\nJake Sullivan (he/him) serves as the Training Delivery Manager at MENTOR, where he plans, curates, and delivers training and professional development content for mentoring practitioners, MENTOR Affiliates, and other audiences to execute MENTOR’s national training strategy.\n\nWith a background and passion for LGBTQ+ youth advocacy, mentoring, project management, training development, and facilitation, Jake has worked at several nonprofits, working directly with young people, and in program operations at local and national levels.
