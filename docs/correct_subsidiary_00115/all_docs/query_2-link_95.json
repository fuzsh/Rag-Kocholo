JJR teamed with nine other Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) from across the nation to win the award and will compete for task orders in two of VECTOR’s five service groups: Group 1 – Management, Oversight, and Improvement; and Group 2 – Analysis.\n\nThe JJR team is the only Ohio-based team among the 68 companies receiving award.\n\n“This contract is a game changer for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses like JJR,” said JJR President and CEO David Judson, Jr. “Successful awardees will likely experience significant growth as a result. We are thrilled with the award and look forward to supporting the VA’s critical mission for our Veterans and their families.”\n\nABOUT JJR SOLUTIONS"
