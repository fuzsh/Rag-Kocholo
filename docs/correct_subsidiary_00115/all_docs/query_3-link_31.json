        "text": "@jesschitas Hey this is great progress!!!!\n\nDo you have a favorite of the four?\n\nI think probably my favorite is the lightbulb one.... the concept I think is straight on what mentorship is about - two people coming together and collaborating, and that interaction generating new ideas!\n\nThe speech bubbles I think, while beautifully rendered, I think are close to the icons we use for chat.fedoraproject.org and discussion.fedoraproject.org - those are chat and discussion forums respectively, so I think maybe better not to have any potential confusion come in with those.\n\nI love the gesture of the figures in the mountain summit, but wonder if - because the peak is so high - it might give the impression this is really super hard? I mean, it's a challenge, but it's definitely not impossible, I might worry slightly folks might get the impression contributing to Fedora / open source is like a Mt. Everest sort of affair! Might be better visually to simplify this and leave the peak out, just have the step at the bottom? I think you could push this one more visually if you really liked the concept (I do like how the concept is a direct link to the Outreachy (https://outreachy.org) logo concept!)\n\nMy second favorite is the high-five hands. Hand gestures are really difficult to get right, but I love the concept of how the two hands working together have the energy generated from the interaction, and I love the angling of the energy in how you rendered it.\n\nI think I would push the top two (the lightbulb one and the high-five hands one), and I think I would push them with an eye to making the artwork more \"Fedora-y.\" I wish I had put together a good guide of what makes the way a thing is rendered more Fedora-y. But let me walk through a quick description of how I see it, and provide some visual examples to hopefully help explain it.\n\nLine quality : Illustrations / logo marks in Fedora tend to have thick, rather than thin lines. They tend to be very straight / geometric and not too organic or loose, with mostly even widths\n\nOutlines : We don't normally outline shapes unless absolutely necessary - usually we go flat without an outline.\n\nPalette : We tend to stick pretty strictly to the Fedora palette and shades of grey (shades of grey typically a little towards warm grey)\n\nGradients : If we use gradients they are very slight (except for backdrops... I'm trying to introduce bold backdrop gradients.)\n\nShapes : Lines and shapes in Fedora brand graphics tend to be very rounded and simplified. Ideally they could work in one color.\n\nFonts : Montserrat pretty much for anything branding (except for the \"fedora\" and \"flock\" logotypes.)\n\nThere's of course exceptions to these, but usually any individual Fedora mark hits most of these so they (hopefully) hang together as a \"family\" with a similar look.\n\nHere's a current working version of a Fedora brand family sheet (or so I call it :) ):\n\nHere's the aforementioned core color palette:\n\nHere's the cartoon mascots (which I know you're familiar with having done excellent work sketching new poses for them for the gaming logo) - they are part of the \"family\", but they do have outlines... but they're not logo marks, so it's a bit of an exception there. And they do reflect the palette for the most part (the panda's tummy colors might need adjusting to match), but the greys and the roundedness are along the right vein.\n\nThese are the humanoid characters I mentioned at the last design team meeting - this is an older version I had handy (uses the old logo), but they use the brand colors, have no outlines, very slight gradients... faces are simplified by basically being blank.\n\nThese are also dated in terms of the old logo being present, but the little iconic graphics here (wings, hand wavy people, trophy, gears) I think are actually pretty analogous to the type of mark you might want to be making here to go along with the \"Fedora Mentor Summit\" in terms of the level of complexity etc. You can see how they are quite thick and rounded and single color and all of that.\n\nSo all of that to say.... I suspect your next step would be to look at these two candidates and see how to Fedora-ify them :) For the hands, I'd simplify them a little bit more while trying to keep the same gesture... basically iconify them. Some examples of simplified hand gestures of a similar vein:\n\nhttps://spiritleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hi-five-icon.jpg\n\nhttps://flyclipart.com/thumb2/cooperative-friend-friendship-happy-high-five-success-796175.png\n\nhttps://media.gettyimages.com/vectors/giving-a-high-five-icon-vector-id596805266\n\nSome of these are so simplified, there are no fingers on the hands :) I suspect that might work well but something to play with. You don't have to drop the fingers or even change the configuration of what you've got with the hands too much though - I think if you shorten the fingers and kind of make the main palm shape dominant you could achieve a similar affect, kind of this sort of hand, where the finger length is much shorter proportionally (and you could even making them shorter still proportionally to simplify the overall shape without losing the gesture):\n\nhttps://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/set-cartoon-hands-kids-learning-basic-math-count-one-to-ten-your-funny-vector-doodle-collection-changeable-global-153759897.jpg\n\nThat's what I'd recommend pursuing with the hands!\n\nWith the lightbulb - I don´t think there is much to do to Fedora-ify this one. I would thicken up the lines on the lightbulb or even consider making it a solid with the filament a cut out? (So basically inverting it and dropping the outline?) I would shift the colors to be the three Fedora blue colors (fedora light blue, fedora blue, fedora dark blue). I might change the shapes from circles to Fedora speech bubbles! That's about it though. Then play with the amount the two bubble shapes intersect, and just make sure the mark reads at small sizes!\n\nAnyway hope this helps, always here to help or if you have a different direction you'd rather go let's talk about it!"
