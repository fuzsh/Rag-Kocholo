        "text": "Digi-Key Corportation and Mentor Graphics have launched a collaboration to create a concept-to-prototype design tool for green-field projects. Titled the Designer Schematic, this software is intended to address the growing need for electronic design automation (EDA) software.\n\nThe software is set to ship early this summer, Digi-Key states, and will be available for under $300. The platform is web-based and provides real-time access to design components, design service providers as well as printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication and manufacturing services. Designers can also access new components for error-free EDA representation as they are released.\n\n“Innovators around the world need to have access to professional-class PCB design tools to easily capture their design concepts. Mentor Graphics’ partnership with Digi-Key provides an opportunity to deliver our proven design technologies to individual engineers at very attractive price points,” said Henry Potts, vice president and general manager of Mentor Graphics Systems Design Division. “We are pleased to be working with Digi-Key, their suppliers, and interested design service and PCB manufacturing suppliers to accelerate designs from concept to prototype. With Designer Schematic, Mentor Graphics is extending its range of PCB development solutions, now serving individual engineers working on conceptual projects, the desktop market with PADS, and the extended enterprise with our flagship Xpedition flow.”"
