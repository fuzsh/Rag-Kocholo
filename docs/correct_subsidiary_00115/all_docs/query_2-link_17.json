        "text": "Page 1 of 8\n\n1800s\n\nPhotosensitive coatings perfected, enabling use of photoengraving and setting the stage for future copper etching processes.\n\n1903\n\nGerman inventor Albert Hanson describes a flat foil conductor laminated to an insulating board, using multiple layers. The concept lays the groundwork for the printed circuit.\n\n1907\n\nPaul Eisler (right), \"father of the PCB,\" is born in Vienna, Austria.\n\n1913\n\nBritish engineer Arthur Berry patents a print-and-etch method.\n\n1948\n\nUS authorities rule that all electronic circuits for airborne instruments were to be printed.\n\n1957\n\nThe Institute for Printed Circuits is founded in Chicago.\n\n1950\n\nRacal Electronics is founded in the UK.\n\n1960s and 1970s\n\nBoards were designed using 4:1, red-and-blue line vellum method for hand-taping components and tracks. A precision camera then produced the 1:1 negative manufacturing film. An experienced designer could lay out and tape a board at the rate of about two hours for each equivalent 14-pin IC on the board.\n\nPads were about 70 mils or greater, and traces and spacing were 25 mils. Boards were typically double-sided, with only a small percentage of multilayer boards, usually no more than four layers.\n\nGerber Scientific introduces RS-274-D as a machine-based format for vector photoplotters.\n\n1963\n\nScientific Calculations founded.\n\n1965\n\nRacal Electronics founds Racal-Redac.\n\nMid 1960s\n\nCAD comes into existence. Developed in three directions: blind-digitizer based CAD, design automation CAD and auto-interactive CAD.\n\n1960s/70s\n\nBoards were designed using 4:1, red-and-blue line vellum method for hand taping components and tracks. A precision camera then produced the 1:1 negative manufacturing film.

Boards were typically double-sided with only a small percentage of multilayer boards, usually no more than four layers.\n\n1970\n\nRacal-Redac releases PDP 15-based PCB, schematic and silicon layout; Z-Router—line probe; and A-Route—Lee maze.\n\n1974\n\nScientific Calculations introduces SCICARDS.\n\n1975\n\nDansk Data Elektronik A/Z founded.\n\nRacal-Redac releases MINI PCB design system, PDP11/34-based.\n\n1976\n\nMakoto Kaneko (above) founds Zuken.\n\nUniversity of Texas researchers James Truchard, Bill Nowlin and Jeff Kodosky found National Instruments.\n\nPolar Instruments founded by ex Tektronix engineering manager Doug Campbell.\n\nDr. Charles Jennings, a Sandia Laboratories chemist, publishes the research that later becomes the guide for current carrying capacity and dielectric breakdown in industry standards for the next 30 years."
