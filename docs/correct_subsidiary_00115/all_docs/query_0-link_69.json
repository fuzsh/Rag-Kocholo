However, S-CNNs pose a challenge to traditional CPUs, GPUs and neural network accelerators due to their inherent sparsity, spike-based communication between neurons and complex activation functions. We explore a novel mapping methodology for S-CNNs on a general-purpose open-source RISC-V core equipped with Indirection Streaming Semantic Registers, a lightweight ISA extension for accelerating sparse-dense linear algebra. Our methodology shows that it is possible to achieve speedups on S-CNNs microkernels up to 10.23× on a dense baseline and up to 7.68× on an optimized dense implementation for high degrees of sparsity of input features.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nPerfXLM: A LLM Inference Engine on RISC-V CPUs\n\nChiyo Wang, PerfXLab Technologies\n\nPlenary on Tuesday June 24th at 14:45.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper introduces a Large Language Models (LLMs) inference engine on RISC-V CPUs, and describes its design principle, implementation and optimizations methods.

In this demo, through Custom Compute, a small core transforms sensor data through DSP operations and detects anomalies through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Without Custom Compute, the system’s energy profile increases and may not complete at the desired frequency, technology node, or time. A new Software / Hardware Interface defined using Codasip Studio with bounded customization increased application performance 5x while vastly limiting the verification effort and risk.\n\nBiography\n\nOver my thirty-eight career, I’ve gone from designing workstations, selling semiconductors, small business owner, senior instructor teaching embedded systems and computer architecture, to leading Codasip’s University Program. The common link between all these jobs is my Electrical Engineering degree.\n\nIn the late 1980s, it appeared that every company was developing their own processor architecture, but quickly in the 1990s, the vast different architectures shrank as software binary compatibility became a priority. Over the following years, Dennard Scaling and Moore’s Law broke, resulting in technology evolving from homogeneous to heterogeneous processing where each application is optimized by its specialized processor. With the advent of RISC-V’s Open Standard, a new golden era of processor engineering is upon us to design these specialized solutions.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nDemo Theatre Talk: ESWIN EIC7700X/7702X, Pioneer of RISC-V Computing Solution\n\nBo Wang, Beijing ESWIN Computing Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nPlenary on Tuesday June 24th at 15:40.\n\nRecording\n\nAbstract\n\nESWIN EIC7700X and EIC7702X are excellent SoCs with superior performance.

The upstream LLVM developer tools for RISC-V are evolving rapidly, but still need further improvements to compete with the well-established ARM and x86 architectures. Codee is a new automatic code inspection tool to help developers optimize C/C++/Fortran codes. This is the first work evaluating the impact of Codee on the LLVM RISC-V ecosystem. The results show up to 7.5x performance boost of well-known open-source codes targeting SiFive’s P470 processor using single-core optimizations for vectorization and memory efficiency. The authors are not aware of a similar approach in LLVM and RISC-V and believe Codee is a new and revolutionizing solution that makes the ecosystem even better.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nDemo Theatre Talk: Exploring RISC-V architectures with VPSim, a virtual prototyping environment with the best trade-off between simulation speed & accuracy\n\nLilia Zaourar, CEA\n\nPlenary on Wednesday June 25th at 10:40.\n\nRecording\n\nAbstract\n\nWith the increase of complexity of computing systems, virtual prototyping is widely adopted as an efficient and cost-effective solution for early hardware/software co-design and co-validation.

Each chip and core supplier can decide individually which functions its RISC-V core(s) support and how they are integrated into the overall system. While the complexity of SoCs grows with the number of cores and the number of different core architectures, the challenges for embedded developers grow even more with operating systems, hypervisors, and other software running on multiple cores. In this presentation experts of Lauterbach, market leader for development tools and strategic member of the RISC-V foundation, show how developers can overcome these challenges with the right tools and debug strategies. They explain how to debug cores from RISC-V and other architectures simultaneously via one debug interface and one debug probe to gain insight into the entire embedded system. The presentation covers real-time on- and off-chip tracing for all major RISC-V trace systems as well as the utilization of standardized RISC-V debug and trace interfaces. All in all, the attendee learns that multicore debugging with RISC-V cores is not rocket science and that there are efficient methods to master even complex chips with complex software configurations.\n\nBiography\n\nM.Sc.

However, a quick exploration of instruction candidates fails due to the lack of tools to auto-generate embedded software toolchain support. This work establishes a semi-automated flow to generate LLVM compiler support for custom instructions based on a C-style ISA description language. The implemented Seal5 tool is capable of generating support for functionalities ranging from baseline assembler-level support, over builtin functions to compiler code generation patterns for scalar as well as vector instructions. The approach is demonstrated using the Core-V instruction set extensions and custom SHA-256 operations. The autogenerated LLVM toolchain reduces development times drastically while performing similarly or better compared to the existing, manually implemented Core-V reference LLVM toolchain on a wide variety of benchmarks.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nNavigating Tomorrow’s Roads: Aligning RISC-V to Automotive Requirements\n\nAlex Kocher, Quintauris\n\nPlenary on Wednesday June 25th at 14:00.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nBack to schedule\n\nReal Time additions to the CVA6 Core\n\nNicolas Tribie, Bosch FR\n\nPlenary on Wednesday June 25th at 14:15.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nThe CVA6 is an Open Source RISC-V core, primarily intended for general purpose applications, such as Linux support.

The growth of the RISC-V ecosystem is creating a major opportunity to develop open-source, vendor-neutral reference platforms for safety-critical computing. We present SentryCore, a reliable, real-time, self-contained, open-source mega-IP for advanced control functions that can be seamlessly integrated into Systems-on-Chip, e.g., for automotive applications, through industry-standard Advanced eXtensible Interface 4 (AXI4). SentryCore features three embedded RISC-V processor cores in lockstep with error-correcting code (ECC) protected data memory for reliable execution of any safety-critical application. Context switching is accelerated to under 110 clock cycles via a RISC-V core-local interrupt controller (CLIC) and dedicated hardware extensions, while a timer-based direct memory access (DMA) engine streamlines sensor data readout during periodic control loops. SentryCore was implemented in Intel’s 16nm process node and tested with FreeRTOS, ThreadX, and RTIC software support.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nBreaking the RISC-V MCUs ecosystem barriers\n\nGiancarlo Parodi, Renesas Electronics\n\nPlenary on Wednesday June 25th at 14:45.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nThe significant re-work to port an application software, the lack of viable key items like low-cost hardware platforms for validation and test, hardware abstraction layer stacks, availability of integrated free-of-charge IDEs with integrated toolchains, reliable and committed debug support: all these pose a threat and create adoption barriers for a broader adoption of RISC-V in the microcontroller space.\n\nThis can hinder engineers from getting hands-on experience with the RISC-V platform, slow down the expansion of RISC-V within the microcontroller broad market, and further delay its momentum.\n\nDuring this presentation, attendees will learn how Renesas contributes to the expansion of the RISC-V ecosystem for MCUs by deploying high quality devices and tools including a fully supported and free of charge IDE with compiler toolchain, low-cost prototyping hardware, and enabling support on commercial environments behind the proof-of-concept phase.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nDemo Theatre Talk: Introducing Sonata — the new open source platform for CHERIoT development\n\nGreg Chadwick, lowRISC\n\nPlenary on Wednesday June 25th at 15:10.\n\nRecording\n\nAbstract\n\nSonata is a development system designed to enable the evaluation of CHERIoT, a RISC-V extension (including a reference core and RTOS) developed by Microsoft which eliminates most common memory safety issues.

This support is separated into levels called “tiers”. Tier-1 is the top tier with the greatest amount of commitment from the project. In order for platforms to qualify for tier-1 status there is a significant set of conditions which must be met. Our project, in conjunction with RISE, is to bridge the gap between tiers one and two, to elevate the status of 64-bit RISC-V Linux support to tier-1.\n\nThis talk will serve as a small introduction of the Rust quality assurance methods. It will also cover the RISC-V specific work that has been done to date, the current status of the platform support, and what work remains to be done to complete tier-1 support. We will cover any platform-specific bug fixes and development work done to enable support, and we will outline ways in which the RISC-V community could engage with the Rust ecosystem to continue to ensure continued support once tier-1 status is achieved.\n\nWe will also discuss the involvement of RISE in the RISC-V and Rust communities, along with our impression of how the Rust programming language could play a significant role in the advancement of RISC-V uptake.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nRISC-V@BSC: Fostering RISC-V strategy in the EU through Research, Innovation & Education\n\nTeresa Cervero, BSC\n\nPlenary on Wednesday June 25th at 16:15.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nThe openness of RISC-V ISA is an enabler for moving research and business further than before.

What about second 64-bit?\n\nMathieu Bacou, Télécom SudParis\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 09:30.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nHigh-performance architectures are increasingly heterogeneous and incorporate often specialized hardware. We have first seen the generalization of GPUs in the most powerful machines, followed by FPGAs, and now by many other accelerators such as Tensor Processor Units (TPUs) for Deep Neural Networks, or variable precision FPUs. Recent hardware manufacturing trends make it very likely that specialization will not only persist, but increase. Manually managing this heterogeneity is complex and not maintainable. We therefore propose to revisit how we design both hardware and OS in order to better hide the heterogeneity. To ensure long term viability of our proposal, we propose to entertain the use of 128-bit addressing\n\nBack to schedule\n\nOpen-Source Development Platform for RISC-V Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors\n\nKari Hepola, Tampere University\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 09:45.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nApplication-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs) can significantly improve performance and energy-efficiency for a predefined set of priority applications, while also offering high flexibility via compiler-supported programmability. Designing and programming these type of customized processors often relies on hardware-software co-design toolsets that are able to adapt to a high-level processor description, and therefore, offer a robust way of efficiently implementing tailored processors. We present an open-source hardware-software co-design toolset for programming and designing RISC-V based ASIPs. We demonstrate the toolset by designing a custom instruction set extension for three cryptographic algorithms, which results in a 44\\% reduction in run time with negligible overheads in clock frequency and area utilization of the synthesized processor implementation.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nDesign Exploration of RISC-V Soft-Cores through Speculative High-Level Synthesis\n\nSimon Rokicki, Irisa\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 10:00.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nThe RISC-V ecosystem is quickly growing and has gained a lot of traction in the FPGA community, as it permits free customization of both ISA and micro-architectural features. However, the design of the corresponding micro-architecture is costly and error-prone. We address this issue by providing a flow capable of automatically synthesizing pipelined micro-architectures directly from an Instruction Set Simulator in C/C++. Our flow is based on HLS technology and bridges part of the gap between Instruction Set Processor design flows and High-Level Synthesis tools by taking advantage of speculative loop pipelining. Our results show that our flow is general enough to support a variety of ISA and micro-architectural extensions, and is capable of producing circuits that are competitive with manually designed cores.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nBring your code to RISC-V accelerators with SYCL\n\nCharles Macfarlane, Codeplay\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 10:15.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk will show attendees how to overcome proprietary code with RISC-V and SYCL.

As the adoption of RISC-V grows, there is an increasing emphasis on enhancing security features in ASIC and FPGA designs. The protection of sensitive data, including encryption keys, passwords, and biometric information, is paramount, as these are prime targets for security breaches that can lead to costly, damaging, and embarrassing consequences. Challenges in security verification that must be addressed include ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and inversion, as well as mitigating the exploitation of sneak paths, addressing inefficient verification flows, and managing the added complexity. In this context, formal technology stands out as the sole method that guarantees the security requirements of datapaths are fulfilled. Our methodology introduces a high degree automation to expedite the security verification process, showcasing its applicability and debugging prowess in a RISC-V implementation, specifically with OpenTitan. The paper will present our findings, providing detailed explanations and runtime information, highlighting our approach’s effectiveness in enhancing security verification.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nInstrument Control & Data Processing for high-reliable ‘New Space’ instruments\n\nGerard Rauwerda, Technolution\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 14:15.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nWe have started the development of a new payload Control & Data Processing Unit (CDPU), an Instrument Control Unit (ICU) with additional data processing capabilities targeted towards ‘New Space’ SmallSats instruments. We defined a modular architecture to allow flexibility in interfaces and functions, with advanced and reliable in-orbit FPGA reprogrammability. The FPGA firmware includes a RISC-V softcore and optional accelerators, allowing for edge processing. This opens the door for payload control, encryption and data processing in space, leveraging the RISC-V ecosystem. The CDPU will act as a hub for (optical) instruments that forms a logical bridge between the instruments and the SmallSat platform. It will offer standardized hardware interfaces for integrated optical instruments, as well as sophisticated facilities for processing the science data before it is sent down to earth. The CDPU also reduces time-to-orbit by removing the need to design an instrument for a specific platform.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nVRP: a Variable Precision Accelerator for Scientific Computing Applications\n\nAndrea Bocco, Univ.

These models enable architectural exploration at the beginning of the project, including the addition and optimization of custom instructions, provide a reference model for design verification of the processor, and provide a high performance, instruction accurate model for virtual prototypes for software development. Key requirements for these models are ease of use, flexible configuration, including adding custom instructions, CSRs, etc., and high performance of the models. This paper discusses the use of the open standard Open Virtual Platforms (OVP) APIs used in C/C++ for building high performance processor models.\n\nIn this paper model architecture will be discussed, and an overview of the OVP APIs presented. Details of APIs to support specific features will be presented, using the OpenHW Group CVW “Wally” processor being developed by Harvey Mudd College and Oklahoma State University. Examples of adding custom instructions to a RISC-V processor will be presented, including both the technical details and the resource requirements, to demonstrate the ease of use of model development via the OVP APIs. Benchmark simulation results, both for bare metal and OS applications, will be shown for both single processor and multiple processor/hart platforms, to show the linear scalability of performance.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nUniversity Demo Theatre: RISC-V enabled, low-power CNN classification in Edge devices\n\nPer Andersson, Lund University\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 15:10.\n\nRecording\n\nBack to schedule\n\nUniversity Demo Theatre: Simulate, trace, and evaluate a RISC-V system leveraging very long vectors of 16 thousand bits\n\nPablo Vizcaino, BSC\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 15:20.\n\nRecording\n\nBack to schedule\n\nDemo Theatre Talk: The role of an Open Computing Architecture in EU Digital sovereignty\n\nLuis C.

The latter does not yet implement all ratified standard extensions. This work presents an implementation of the missing hypervisor extension into the official Sail model. Necessary modifications and additions to the model are checked for regressions using bundled tests. They are verified using a testsuite that is developed together with the model and with two third-party testsuites. Furthermore, the extracted emulator is able to boot Linux on top of a type 1 hypervisor. Both the formal model implementation and our testsuite may prove to be useful for the development and verification of future systems that implement the H-extension. Finally, the formal model enables future work to create rigorous proofs about hypervisor extension features and the software that relies on them.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nOpen-source RISC-V Input/Output Physical Memory Protection (IOPMP) IP\n\nLuis Cunha, University of Minho\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 17:00.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nThis work describes the design and implementation of an open-source I/O Physical Memory Protection (IOPMP) IP compliant with the RISC-V IOPMP Architecture Specification (version 1.0.0-draft5). So far, we have designed and implemented an IP with the mandatory features supporting the Full model. We functionally validated and evaluated this IP within a CVA6-based SoC. Future plans include updating the IP to comply with the ratified specification and expanding its capabilities, such as incorporating additional operation models (e.g., Dynamic-K) and optional features (e.g., MDLCK). Finally, we intend to open-source the IP for the RISC-V community.\n\nBack to schedule\n\nUnique Program Execution Checking: Formal Security Guarantees for RISC-V Systems\n\nAlex Wezel, RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau\n\nPlenary on Thursday June 26th at 17:15.\n\nRecording Slides\n\nAbstract\n\nThe seemingly endless stream of previously unknown microarchitectural attacks and security flaws in hardware systems is driving the need for more efficient and comprehensive verification techniques. Unique Program Execution Checking (UPEC) is a formal verification methodology that can be used to verify a wide variety of security requirements for hardware at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). With its white-box nature and reusable verification IP, UPEC complements the open-source ecosystem provided by RISC-V. We demonstrate the efficacy of UPEC through a set of selected case studies, covering different threat models and ranging from small RISC-V processors to entire Systems-on-Chips (SoCs).\n\nBack to schedule"
