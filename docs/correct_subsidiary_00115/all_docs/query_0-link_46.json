        "text": "At Siemens EDA, we don't just navigate circuits, we navigate careers! Explore the world of possibilities and make your weekend legendary by checking out exciting job opportunities at Siemens EDA. Apply your passion, creativity, and innovation in a team that's shaping the future. Who says job hunting can't be part of the weekend fun? https://sie.ag/7C5Hci https://sie.ag/t9nPn\n\nThank you to our attendees and especially our presenters who took the time for our in-person seminar last week in Germany. We heard from Professor Bringmann on the optimized deployment of AI accelerator support architectures for autonomous driving and low-power applications in medical. AWS demonstrated how customers accelerate computing by using cloud-based services and applications. AMD presented AI architectures across FPGA and x86, for devices at the edge. Fraunhofer brought perspectives tackling uncertainty with digital twins and Dennemeyer and Associates were a great asset to our event with a presentation on protecting your IP before the product is available. We also shared how Siemens enables software on a virtual platform, optimizes machine learning deployment, and has products for power performance analysis. These smiles say it all. Such value in an in-person seminar. We look forward to hosting our next event!\n\nCan you really perfect your design pre silicon? Hear from Siemens partners such as AWS, AMD, Fraunhofer-Institut, and Dennemeyer how to do just that. Join our in-person seminar in Munich, Germany on Thursday, November 9th, 2023 where you can learn more on the benefits of the shift left approach, safety challenges of highly automated systems, software enablement for heterogenous SoCs and optimized machine learning deployment just to name a few topics for this in-person event.
