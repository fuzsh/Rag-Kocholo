He has also given several\n\ncolloquia and lectures in universities all over the world and his research was also featured in the publications Science (2012), TED (2013), Nature Machine Intelligence (2022), Nature Physics (2022).\n\nJeff is the Industry CTO of Dell Technologies of the Automotive sector, specifically in the area of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles and overall Edge Technology strategy lead. Jeff is responsible for leading the team that is developing the overall Dell Technologies technology strategy development, architectural direction and product requirements for the Intelligent Connected Vehicle platform.\n\nHe also is the Chairman of the Dell Automotive Design Authority Council responsible for the technical solution design. In his role as Edge Technology Lead he is driving the development of a Dell Technology wide Edge platform including the physical edge systems, heterogenous compute, memory/storage, environment, security, data management, control plane stack and automation/orchestration.\n\nPreviously, Jeff has held senior roles at an early stage artificial intelligence/machine reasoning based process automation technology provider and Elefante Group a stratospheric wireless communications platform as CTO. He also held senior positions at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent where he led technology initiatives, solutions development, business development and services delivery.\n\nEarlier in his career White served in leadership roles at BellSouth and Cingular Wireless (now AT&T). At Cingular, he led the National Transport Infrastructure Engineering with responsibility for national transport, VoIP & IMS engineering. At BellSouth (now AT&T) he led the Broadband Internet Operations & Support organization which included broadband access tier two technical support, customer networking equipment business, broadband OSS & end-to-end process.\n\nWhite holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Southern Polytechnic University. He also served as Chairman of the Tech Titans Technology Association of North Texas representing over 300 Technology companies in the greater North Texas community. He also served on the North Texas Regional committee of the Texas Emerging Technology fund under Governor Rick Perry.\n\nZaid is currently GM in Cloud Hardware Infrastructure Engineering where he leads a team focusing on advanced architecture and engineering efforts for AI. He is passionate about building balanced teams of artists and soldiers that solve incredibly difficult problems at scale.\n\nPrior to Microsoft Zaid was head of infrastructure engineering at LinkedIn responsible for all aspects of engineering for Datacenters, Compute, Networking, Storage and Hardware. He also lead several software development teams spanning from BMC, network operating systems, server and network fleet automation to SDN efforts inside the datacenter and global backbone including edge. He introduced the concept of disaggregation inside LinkedIn and pioneered JDM with multiple vendors through key initiatives like OpenSwitch, Open19 essentially controlling destiny for hardware development at LinkedIn. During his 9 year tenure at LinkedIn his team scaled network and systems 150X, members from 50M to 675M, and hiring someone every 7 seconds on the LinkedIn Platform.\n\nPrior to LinkedIn Zaid was Network Architect at WebEx responsible for building the MediaTone network and later I built a startup that built a pattern recognition security chip using NPU/FPGA.
