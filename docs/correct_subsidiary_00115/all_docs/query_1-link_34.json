        "text": "Talented and highly skilled working-age disabled and neurodiverse adults participate in the workforce significantly less than those without disabilities — and experience unemployment rates much higher than their able-bodied and neurotypical peers.\n\nVarious factors influence these stark realities, such as discrimination and unconscious bias, barriers in recruitment processes, or workplaces that are designed for able-bodied, neurotypical workers.\n\nAt this summit, PowerToFly wants to flip the status quo on its head by destigmatizing disabilities and neurodivergence in the workplace, both visible and invisible. Join disability inclusion experts and neurodiversity advocates as they address:\n\nUnderstanding neurodiversity\n\nThe benefits and drawbacks that hybrid and remote work can have on a person with a disability\n\nRespectful and inclusive language\n\nThe historical context of disability in the public sphere\n\nAccessible technology\n\nAnd much more!\n\nThe summit will conclude with a virtual job fair featuring companies that are committed to neurodiversity and disability inclusion. Representatives will answer candidates’ questions about how they are creating and maintaining inclusive spaces.\n\nAccording to Tech.co, since Generative AI was released in late 2022, it’s been picked up by almost half of U.S. companies, and 93% of these firms are looking to expand its use. But we are only starting to see the impact of tools such ChatGPT, Bard and AI in general on the future of work — and the future of DEIB.\n\nJoin us at Emerging Tech: Advancing DEIB in the Digital Age, as we explore AI and other new tools and their transformative effect. This groundbreaking gathering brings together industry leaders, technologists, and advocates to delve into the opportunities and challenges that will or already have emerged in our fast-changing business landscape and the world at large. Through thought-provoking discussions, interactive sessions, and real-world case studies, attendees will gain insights into the latest tools on the market.\n\nAt Emerging Tech, we will delve into the potential benefits of AI to not only enhance operational efficiency and drive business growth but also to address biases, promote fairness, and ensure equitable outcomes. We’ll also address the inherent challenges and biases that may be ingrained in this emerging technology.\n\nWe’ll wrap up the summit with a free virtual job fair where you’ll be able to hear directly from hiring companies about their own emerging technologies, plus meet directly with talent leaders and hiring managers to learn more about open roles.\n\nAt PowerToFly, we know that Latinidad encompasses a range of diverse experiences and identities — and that Latin American heritage and culture influence both language and identity in the workplace.\n\nJoin us as we gather with Latino/a & Hispanic leaders and changemakers to discuss topics such as bilingualism, the need for greater representation in the C-suite, how to mentor and sponsor Latino/a and Latin American talent, and more. You won't want to miss this free opportunity to connect with your peers, network with top companies, and learn from leaders who've been in your shoes!\n\nAlso check out the virtual job fair on the last day of the summit, where companies will chat with candidates and answer questions about their Latino/a representation and corporate culture.\n\nPrevious speakers at our Latinidad summit include: Licy Do Canto, managing director, Washington D.C., APCO Worldwide; Congressman Ritchie Torres; Patricia Mota, CEO of the Hispanic Alliance for Career Advancement; former NASA Chief Engineer and Associate VP, University of Houston-Clear Lake, Evelyn Miralles; Juan Labourt, business program manager at Google UK, and many more!\n\nCalling all veterans, military spouses, allies, and active duty service members preparing for the next chapter in their careers! Join us for an exclusive event tailored just for you.\n\nDiscover tailored programs and roles designed specifically to leverage your unique skills and experiences. Hear firsthand from fellow veterans and military spouses who have successfully transitioned into civilian roles. Gain invaluable insights from recruiters and hiring managers on how to stand out in today's competitive job market.\n\nNot a veteran or military spouse? Allies are welcome! Join our fireside chats and workshops to learn more how you can support this community in the workplace and beyond.\n\nPlus, if you're a non-veteran hiring leader or a company eager to support our military community, this event is for you too! Learn from experts on how to enhance your recruitment process and attract top talent.\n\nPast speakers have included General (ret.) Lori J. Robinson; Marcus A. Williams, Sr. Talent Strategy Leader, Military and Individuals with Disabilities (USN Retired) at Kaiser Permanente; Stephanie Brown, Founder & CEO of The Rosie Network; Flossie Hall, Co-Founder of the Association of Military Spouse Entrepreneurs; Jennifer Dane, CEO & Executive Director of Modern Military Association of America; and many others.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to connect, learn, and explore exciting career possibilities. And mark your calendars for our free virtual job fair, open to veterans, active service members, military spouses, allies, and their supporters!\n\nJoin us and take the next step toward your future success."
