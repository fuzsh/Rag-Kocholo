Gaines' novel A Lesson Before Dying, including biographical details about the author and context about the time period and themes in the novel. Gaines was born on a Louisiana plantation in 1933 and drew from his experiences of racism and working in the fields for the novel. The story, set in 1940s Louisiana, reflects the historically accurate racism of the Jim Crow era, including segregation, tensions between blacks, and captivity versus freedom. Major themes in the novel include racism, obligation, and redemption.\n\n1 of 21\n\nEditor's Notes\n\nRemember his name!!!\n\nNow we are going to look at artifacts of the time that promote racial stereotypes (whether overtly or not).\n\nWe’re going to look at some artifacts from the Jim Crow area from the collection of the Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University in Michigan.This is perhaps an artifact that you might think of immediately when you hear the words Jim Crow. But let’s really think about it for a second, recognizing how much a subtle difference in language can indicate a major change in meaning.There are three words. White. Only. Colored. Why doesn’t “only” follow colored?\n\nTwo ethnicities, and dogs. The relationship is not so subtle. By association, blacks and Jews are dehumanized. In A Lesson Before Dying, we will see this kind of dehumanization, the central character being referred to as a “hog.”Now we are going to look at artifacts of the time that promote racial stereotypes (whether overtly or not).\n\nWho is the audience of this painting? What facial feature is highlighted? Whether or not the bones in their noses, their grass skirts, and their weapons are historically accurate, what do they suggest? What about the tie, the bow, and the bowtie? What might they imply? What about their faces? What are the differences between each of the figures?\n\nWho can tell me what these objects are? Makeup and a wig for a minstrel to wear.\n\nCan somebody read the text on the sign?(Have a student read)He doesn’t know the difference between what two things?What DOES he know about Cream of Wheat?Does anyone know the termrastus?Rastus: A general term for a “happy black man” in minstrel shows. The name was used in advertisements for Cigars as well. Today it’s a highly offensive term.\n\nContemporary “Cream of Wheat” design. Though they don’t refer to him as “Rastus” anymore, the image of him remains virtually unchanged today.Think of other breakfast items… Can any come to mind that might have a similar origin?\n\nAunt Jemima was also a character in minstrel shows before being trademarked for advertising.\n\nLook at the advertisement on the left. What is a major similarity between this advertisement and the Cream of Wheat cartoon?\n\nA collage of various Aunt Jemima’s through the years.\n\nI previously mentioned a historical tension that A Lesson Before Dying will explore that relates to this item as well as the next. What might it be? (Racism not only between whites and blacks, but also between light-skin and dark-skin blacks)\n\nProducts to flatten hair, make black hair appear more white.\n\nLooking to “Ghettopoly” When do you think this was made? 2003Description of differences from the Monopoly game (source: Wikipedia) The four railroad properties are replaced by liquor stores. Other properties include a massage parlour, a peep show and a pawn shop. The Community Chest and Chance squares become Ghetto Stash and Hustle squares, while taxation squares are replaced by policeshakedown and carjacking squares.[1]Instead of building houses and hotels, property owners can build crack houses and projects. The seven game pieces include: a pimp, a ho, a 40 oz, a machine gun, a marijuana leaf, a crack rock, and a basketball."
