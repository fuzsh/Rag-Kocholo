        "meta_description": "I am an Indian Chartered Accountant living in United Arab Emirates. I did NOT watch many movies till 2010. In the beginning of 2011, I decided to compensate this by watching some great movies. \n\nI did extensive research on the internet. My aim was to search for, find, and watch: Movies of Class & Movies with lessons to learn from. Though these were primary criteria, since I watched these  movies spread throughout the year 2011 & till date, I had some valuable diverse additions to the list as well depending on certain periodic influences. This list is arrived at after watching around four times the total number of carefully chosen movies. I believe rejections improved the quality of this list.\n\nThe movies in this list are real class apart. You would enjoy watching them greatly if you share my taste, learning objective & level of intellect.\n\nEach movie is a warehouse of inspirational ideas, stories, dialogues and examples. For the first few movies, I have wrote down below, a few key lessons which I learned from them. Kindly let me know your of your opinions or feedback by replying to this post. Thank you & Best Wishes- Prince Pratap",

        "text": "Lessons Learned from the Movie:\n\nYou don't have to be smart to become a super achiever. Single minded focus on one thing at a time can create miracles. The hero was kind of stupid (as the stupid does); still he become number one in many fields. Not all at once, but at different points of time. How? He single mindedly focused on that one thing. Without doubting or questioning, he obeyed what his trusted friends asked him to do. E.g. \" Run Forrest Run\". And, Secret of Ping Pong success: \"Never take eye off the ball\"......\n\nYou have to do the best with what God gave you.\n\nI don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time.\n\nA Promise is a Promise.\n\nLuke: I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.\n\nYoda: Ohhh. Great warrior. [laughs and shakes his head] Wars not make one great.\n\nYoda: Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things.\n\nYoda: You must unlearn what you have learned.\n\nYoda: Yes, run! Yes, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.\n\nLuke: Vader... Is the dark side stronger?\n\nYoda: No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.\n\nLuke: But how am I to know the good side from the bad?\n\nYoda: You will know... when you are calm, at peace, passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, NEVER for attack.\n\nLuke: But tell my why I can't...\n\nYoda: No, no! There is no \"why\".\n\nLuke: All right, I'll give it a try.\n\nYoda: No. Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.\n\nLuke: I don't, I don't believe it.\n\nYoda: That is why you fail.\n\nKey Lessons / Interesting Ideas from the movie - Prince Pratap:\n\nTyler Durden: You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your *beep* khakis. You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.\n\nNarrator: On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.\n\nTyler Durden: First you have to give up, first you have to *know*... not fear... *know*... that someday you're gonna die.\n\nTyler Durden: The things you own end up owning you.\n\nTyler Durden: Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.\n\nTyler Durden: Self improvement is masturbation. Now self destruction...\n\nTyler Durden: We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.\n\nTyler Durden: It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.\n\nBe fearless and take action. You have all the resources they need. Then why you are afraid to act. - The scene from the movie on this was really touching: Cpl. Timothy P. Upham (Character) carrying all the ammunition his colleagues (out of ammunition while fighting the enemy) need still, unable to move forward due to fear.\n\nCaptain Miller: Earn this.\n\nPrivate Ryan: You can tell my mother that when you found me, I was with the only brothers I had left. And that there was no way I was deserting them. I think she'd understand that.\n\nThis thriller teeters on the edge between psychological study and all-out horror, and benefits greatly from stellar performances by Anthony Hopkins (a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath) and Jodie Foster (a to be enrolled lady FBI agent who is a mission to identify & capture a psychotic serial killer at large).\n\nThis was a tough choice to be included in my list. I was wondering what is inspirational about this movie. Then i could find the following:\n\n1. Lady FBI Agents fearlessness, her winning trust/compassion of a prisoner who could help the investigation (Hannibal Lecter), her intelligence, perseverance, compassion towards to be victims of a psychotic serial killer\n\n2. Hannibal Lecter's intelligence, psychological skills, shrewdness\n\nLessons:\n\n1. \"I have just come to a realization! This scroll by Broken Sword contains no secrets of his swordsmanship. What this reveals is his highest ideal. In the first state, man and sword become one and each other. Here, even a blade of grass can be used as a lethal weapon. In the next stage, the sword resides not in the hand but in the heart. Even without a weapon, the warrior can slay his enemy from a hundred paces. But the ultimate ideal is when the sword disappears altogether. The warrior embraces all around him. The desire to kill no longer exists. Only peace remains.\"\n\n2. Choose & use weapon after assessing the enemy. \"Sky\" don't even remove his sword/sphere from the leather cover when a bunch of kings men came to fight him. And then he defeated all of them single-handed. But when Jet Li come rushing towards him, he (\"Sky\") understands this fighter is different. and to survive he have to use his weapon to the fullest. We all can sense each other's capability quick. Its in our blood. Trust your intuition & subconscious.\n\n3. A large part of all the fights happen in the mind. For e.g. the fight between \"Sky\" & \"Local Perfect\"(Jet Li). And when the music stops understand that it is high time to start the fight ;)\n\nSocrates: Where are you?\n\nDan Millman: Here.\n\nSocrates: What time is it?\n\nDan Millman: Now.\n\nSocrates: What are you?\n\nDan Millman: This moment.\n\n“Everything has a purpose, even this, and it's up to you to find it.”\n\n“Death isn't sad. The sad thing is: most people don't live at all.”\n\n“The ones who are hardest to love are usually the ones who need it the most.”\n\n“The journey is what brings us happiness not the destination.”\n\n“A warrior does not give up what he loves, he finds the love in what he does.”\n\nMajor Fambrough: You wish to see the frontier?\n\nJohn Dunbar: Yes sir, before it's gone.\n\nStands With a Fist: [translating for Kicking Bird] He thanks Dances with Wolves for coming.\n\nJohn Dunbar: Who is Dances with Wolves?\n\nStands With a Fist: It is the name all the people are calling you now.\n\nJohn Dunbar: [voice-over] Nothing I have been told about these people is correct. They are not thieves or beggars. They are not the bogeymen they are made out to be. On the contrary, they are polite guest and I enjoy their humor.\n\nJohn Dunbar: [voice-over] It was hard to know how to feel. I had never been in a battle like this one. This had not been a fight for territory or riches or to make men free. This battle had no ego. It had been fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through winter, to protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a few feet away. I felt a pride I had never felt before."
