This biography details Ernest J. Gaines' studies and novels focused on his experiences with racism. His first novel was Catherine Carmier, followed by several others leading up to his most acclaimed work, A Lesson Before Dying, which was published in 1993. Biographies that explain an author's inspirations are helpful for understanding their works. Criticism of A Lesson Before Dying focused on its use of biblical references, but overall it conveyed a powerful message of change being possible.",
