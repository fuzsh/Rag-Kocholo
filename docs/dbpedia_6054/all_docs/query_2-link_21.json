        "text": "Introduction\n\nAs Jefferson nears its end due to a wrongful conviction of conspiracy to murder, a revelation is manifested that shows a society full of racial discrimination but the very society is in desire to overcome racism. The main events of the novel happen away from Jefferson who awaits execution in a filthy jail cell. The paper will look into how racism influenced Grant and Jefferson throughout the novel ‘A Lesson Before Dying’.\n\nJefferson and Grant\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the poor people of black origin who were illiterate and were residing in the south began a process of self-realization and discovery (Fredrickson, 79). While the world over celebrated, lives of many black men in Bayonne and Louisiana hardly changed (Rosengarten, 112). This was a true reflection of Jefferson and Grant. Poverty and racism exhibited in the lives of blacks who lived in Bayonne illustrated by the poor conditions of their schools or squalor settlements compared to their whites’ counterparts (Memmi, 112). “There was a Catholic Church uptown for whites; a Catholic church back of town for coloured. There was a white movie theatre uptown; a colored movie theatre back of town. There were two elementary schools uptown and the same back of town for coloured (Miles & Brown, 134).\n\nThe few blacks who were educated like Grant are full of bitterness because they can see vividly and comprehend the problem of racism facing them (Gaines, 45). Attempts by Grant for improvement are observed as a major threat by the majority of the whites who are the rulers. Gaines (79) notes that this is illustrated when Sheriff Guidry tells Grant that “Maybe you’re just a little too smart for your own good.” Both Grant and Jefferson suffer a fair share of racism. Grant is often searched for contraband every time he visits Jefferson in jail. Grant is also offensively shown a lot of discourtesy by a salesgirl when he purchases a radio.\n\nThe full indication and impacts of racism is shown by Jefferson way before the bar brawl that left the owner dead. He had no cent in his pocket and was uneducated. His job was hauling water using a cart to his fellow workers. The prospects of a better future for him were dismal. He is condemned to death by the entire community at large after living what seemed to be a worthless life. In the initial stages of his visits, Jefferson is portrayed as a racial stereotype who rejects attempts of making peace before his execution. He is spiritually and literally imprisoned. Eventually he begins to open up during subsequent visits and undergoes a profound transformation until he expresses a sense of self-realization and worth. During the 10th visit, his self-imprisonment ends as Jefferson thanks the children for their presents and works with Grant for emotional empowerment. As his execution nears, he finds respect for his community and gains regard from the upper ruling class (Gaines, 98).\n\nConclusion\n\nJefferson and Grant fight different ways to overcome racism. Jefferson’s last words truly indicate that he has indeed triumphed over racial discrimination and evolved to salvation. Jefferson dies with dignity and as a hero because through his stint in prison and during his death many people learn from his transformation including Grant who helps Jefferson to realize it and make peace with himself before his death.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFredrickson, George.
