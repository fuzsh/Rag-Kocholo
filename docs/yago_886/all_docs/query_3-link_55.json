        "text": "C B-n in Dagens Nyheter:\n\nNo, I think that Ingmar Bergman is on a perilous course if his film adaptations of modern Swedish fiction follow the template he has made for himself in Music in Darkness. Naturally, there is something to draw comfort from. One must be pleased that Swedish film production, which increasingly comprises so much that is coarse and so many faux pas, now has a director with such impeccable artistic aspirations as Ingmar Bergman, so conscientious when it comes to keeping the weeds at bay. His new film Music in Darkness is visually attractive throughout, precise down to the last detail, as smooth as silk.\n\nFilmson in Aftonbladet:\n\nThe subject of the film would have been completely repellent had Bergman not carried over so much Dagmar Edqvist's unsentimental sympathy for the world of blind people and his portrayal of their rational view of what is a particularly complicated, yet otherwise universal human existence. But first and foremost this is a film about young, awkward, yet ultimately devoted love, and in this too, Ingmar Bergman has managed to achieve a profound warmth and tenderness in the screen narrative previously only hinted at. To begin with, Mai Zetterling is somewhat affected as the young servant girl, but her true, heart-felt womanly qualities grow, and her pale, translucent face has an air of avowed simplicity which is beautifully offset by Malmsten's dark, reserved warmth.\n\nNils Beyer in Morgontidningen:\n\nThere were, in Dagmar Edqvist's novel, so many fine psychological nuances that have been lost in the film. Ingmar Bergman has not put his whole heart into this story of the blind musician, who after a tough inner and outer struggle manages to overcome his handicap. The entire social element of his plight has been conjured away. What has captivated the director is blindness as a state of anxiety  and finally he solves all the difficulties via a thoroughly conventional happy ending.\n\n\"In its lyricism, Music in Darkness is a captivating film. A trifle slow perhaps towards the end, yet nonetheless an example of a film that is better than the book on which it is based.\"\n\nRobin Hood in Stockholms-Tidningen\n\nBeatrice: Greed brings a man to defile the commandments by embezzling. And then he takes his life.\n\nBengt: I was his life, after all.\n\nAugustin: Beatrice regards suicide as murder.\n\nBeatrice: Isn't that so? It is a crime against life.\n\nAgneta: We don't know what he endured.\n\nBeatrice: Everything can be born. Pain and suffering are part of God's plan.\n\nAgneta: Perhaps he was driven by despair?\n\nBeatrice: Despair? Despair is merely a momentary fit of impatience in the grand scheme.\n\nLovisa, the housekeeper: So, you read for quite some time?\n\nIngrid: We have permission to do so.\n\nLovisa: We are going to read many books, all winter.\n\nIngrid: No good will come of that. You come from a peasant stock and you are as good as city folk.\n\nBeatrice: Remarkable how that girl has grown up.\n\nBengt: Has she?\n\nBeatrice: Don't you find her accommodating?\n\nBengt: Yes, she is sweet.\n\nBeatrice: You need a wife to look after you.\n\nBengt: Look after me? Thank you. So I could marry the little wench?\n\nBeatrice: Shame on you! You could do worse. Besides, she may not want you.\n\nBengt: So my last resort doesn't exist.\n\nHedström: And don't be satisfied with the secondary exam, aim higher. What do you say?\n\nBengt: I can't. I just want to exist, nothing more.\n\nHedström: The community needs you. Your example will state their case.\n\nBengt: I can't. I don't want to. Don't badger me!\n\nBengt: The young woman accompanies the victor.\n\nIngrid: Why did you say that?\n\nBengt: It's a joke, can't you tell?\n\nEbbe: Ingrid is sensitive to tone lately.\n\nBengt: Be careful around people. They suddenly see through things.\n\nIngrid: I'm going to continue my studies.\n\nLovisa, the housekeeper: Not when you messed up things like this.\n\nIngrid: I haven't messed anything up.\n\nLovisa: What? Aren't you pregnant?\n\nIngrid: No.\n\nLovisa: Why are you getting married then?"
