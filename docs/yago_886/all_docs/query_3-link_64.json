        "text": "Cast:\n\nBibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom\n\nNo less a luminary than Simone de Beauvoir called Mai Zetterling’s riotous feature ‘the best movie ever made by a woman,’ and Swedes voted it into their top 20. Three female friends (played by Bergman regulars) tour a production of Aristophanes’ Lysistrata as the spirit of ’68 sweeps Sweden. Life imitates art (imitating life in Bergman’s rep company?) as the sex wars spill off the stage into confrontations with the audience – and husbands back home. Will the girls win this time?\n\nAccompanying short film"
