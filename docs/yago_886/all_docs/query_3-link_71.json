        "text": "For her feature film directing debut, actress Mai Zetterling turned to Agnesvon Krusenstjerna¹s controversial masterpiece of Swedish feminist literature, The Misses von Pahlen, an intense and personal 7-part novel has been likened to the great works of D.H. Lawrence.\n\nAs three pregnant women from different backgrounds wait to have their babies in a hospital in Stockholm at the outbreak of the Great War, they relive their childhood and youthful experiences via individual flashbacks.\n\nDrawing on the classic Ingmar Bergman style of Swedish film making and collaborating with many of his favorite actors as well as the great cinematographer Sven Nykvist, Zetterling has produced a powerful fusion of personal emotional drama and a commentary on the role of women in a society in moral decline."
