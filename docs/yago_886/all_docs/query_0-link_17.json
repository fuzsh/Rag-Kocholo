        "text": "DANIEL GERROLL is DR GLAS in JEFFREY HATCHER’S adaptation of the classic Swedish novel by HJALMAR SÖDERBERG. When you read this psychological thriller with its dashes of philosophical musings woven into intricate and intimate journal entries, DR GLAS stays deeply embedded in the imagination. Published in 1905 in Swedish it wasn’t until 1963 that there was an available English translation. In 1942 it was adapted for a film in black and white by Rune Carlsten and in 1968 Mai Zetterling directed a Danish version in color. Various stage adaptations have appeared all over Northern Europe but this adaptation by JEFFREY HATCHER, performed by DANIEL GERROLL, is the first serious American version.\n\n“Award-winning British television and screen actor Daniel Gerroll (“The Blacklist” and “Chariots of Fire”) gives a captivating performance that delivers on all counts in his portrayal of an unfulfilled and alienated man whose initial joy in finding passion becomes obsession and ultimately menace. – Culture Vulture\n\nWHERE: Whippoorwill Hall\n\nNorth Castle Library\n\nKent Place\n\nArmonk 10504\n\n**(See note below if you are not familiar with this location already)\n\nWHEN: May 7 – 12, 2024\n\n(5 Performances, Tues.-Sun.)\n\n5/7 at 7 p.m. (Talk Back)\n\n5/8 at 2 p.m (Talk Back)\n\n5/8 at 7 p.m (Talk Back)\n\n5/9 at 7 p.m. (Talk Back)\n\n5/12 at 7 p.m. (Talk Back)\n\nThe show is approximately 90 minutes long with no intermission\n\nTICKETS:\n\nAdults: $35\n\nSeniors: $30\n\nSeniors/Students/Veterans: $25\n\n**Due to our new ticketing platform which allows for reserved seating, there is a fee added at checkout.\n\nTALK BACKS: Participate in a unique discussion with the actors to learn their\n\nperspectives about this provocative play.

It might help to input Amore Pizza,, which shares a parking lot with the library, to make sure you are headed to the right place.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nEmail: Info@KatonahClassicStage.com\n\nPhone: 844-527-7469"
