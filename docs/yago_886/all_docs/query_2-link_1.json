        "text": "Mai Zetterling (born May 24, 1925, Västerås, Sweden—died March 15?, 1994, London, England) was a Swedish actress, director, and novelist. As a director, she imbued her work with a passionate feminism.\n\nZetterling was trained for the stage and made both her stage and screen debut in 1941 when she was 16 years of age. In 1944 she appeared in Alf Sjöberg’s film Hets (Torment, or Frenzy). Ingmar Bergman wrote the script for Hets, and critics consider it the beginning of a new period in Swedish filmmaking.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1947 Zetterling went to England to star in the motion picture Frieda and on the stage in The Wild Duck. She scored several successes as an actress after that in movies in England and the United States, including The Bad Lord Byron (1949), Knock on Wood (1954), and Only Two Can Play (1961)."
