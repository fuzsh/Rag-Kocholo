        "meta_description": "British postcard in the Picturegoer Series, London, no. D 500. Photo: Renown Pictures. <b>Mai Zetterling</b> in <i>Dance Little Lady</i> (Val Guest, 1954).\n\t\n\tLovely Swedish actress and film director <b>Mai Zetterling</b> (1925-1994) graced many European films in the 1940s and 1950s with her slim figure, green eyes, blonde hair, and bewitchingly elfin features.\n\t\n\tShe was born in Västerås, Sweden, and lived from 1929 till 1932 in Australia with her mother and stepfather. She started her career as an actress by the age of seventeen at Dramaten, the Swedish national theatre. Following her film debut in Lasse-Maja (Gunnar Olsson, 1941), she made quite an impact in the terminally dark Hets/Frenzy (Alf Sjöberg, 1944), written by Ingmar Bergman. He went on to direct her in his Musik i mörker/Music and Darkness (Ingmar Bergman, 1948). The international attention she received from Hets led her to England where she debuted in the title role of Frieda (Basil Dearden, 1947), about the problems of an RAF officer's German bride in dealing with postwar prejudice in his hometown. She played decorative roles in a segment of Quartet (Ralph Smart, 1948) and The Romantic Age (Edmond T.Gréville, 1949). Developing modest sex symbol success, she went on to co-star opposite a number of handsome leading men throughout the post-war years in primarily dramatic works, including Dennis Price in the flop The Bad Lord Byron (David MacDonald, 1949), Dirk Bogarde in Blackmailed (Marc Allégret, 1951), Herbert Lom in The Ringer (Guy Hamilton, 1952), Danny Kaye in the American comedy Knock on Wood (Melvin Frank, Norman Panama, 1954), Richard Widmark in A Prize of Gold (Mark Robson, 1955), Tyrone Power in Seven Waves Away (Richard Sale, 1957), which was a variation on Hitchcock's Lifeboat (1944), and William Sylvester in Offbeat (1961). Along the way she proved just as adaptable and sexy in smart comedy when she came between husband and wife Peter Sellers and Virginia Maskell in Only Two Can Play (Sidney Gilliat, 1962).\n\t\n\tMai Zetterling abandoned acting and began directing, starting with political documentaries. She had divorced from Norwegian actor Tutte (Samuel) Lemkow in 1953 and married writer David Hughes in 1958 with whom she co-wrote the screenplay of her short film The Wargame (1962). Her directing ventures were controversial for their frank sexuality and seemed ahead of their time. Obviously influenced by Ingmar Bergman, the dark, sexy drama Älskande par/Loving Couples (1964) dealt with homosexual themes and featured nudity; Nattlek/Night Games (1966) revolved around sexual decadency and repression, and Flickorna/The Girls (1968), was a feminist rumination on Aristophanes' classical antiwar play Lysistrata, with Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom. In Great Britain, she directed Scrubbers (1982), for HandMade, about young female offenders sent to Borstal prison. In 1985 Mai published her autobiography, 'All Those Tomorrows'. Toward the end of her life, she returned to film acting. Best remembered is her nurturing and resilient grandmother in The Witches (Nicolas Roeg, 1990), the film adaptation of Roald Dahl's book. In this wonderful film fantasy, she is forced to tangle with a particularly virulent ringleader Anjelica Huston to save her grandson from her coven of hags. She was also excellent in Ken Loach's Hidden Agenda (1990). Her last film role was in the Swedish production Morfars resa/Grandpa's Journey (Stafan Lamm, 1993), with Max von Sydow. Mai died in London of cancer in 1994. She had two children from her first marriage, Louis, who is a professor in Barcelona, Spain, and Etienne.\n\t\n\tSources: Gary Brumburgh (IMDb), Wikipedia, Brian MacFarlane (Encyclopedia of British Film), and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
