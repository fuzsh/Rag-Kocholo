Communication and long-term relationships are important to us. Let us know what is on your mind and ask questions. We will help you realize an investment in yourself pays dividends for a lifetime. We are caring, skilled professionals, dedicated to simplifying what is often a very complicated and confusing area of health care. We want all our patients to be informed and knowledgeable about their dental health care, from treatment plan s and services, to insurance coverage.\n\nDr. Glass has been practicing dentistry for 27 years and comes from a family of dentists. His grandfather, father, uncle, and cousin have all practiced dentistry.\n\nA local graduate of The Stanley Clark School as well as Marian High School, he attended Indiana University in Bloomington for his undergraduate studies and then graduated from the Indiana University School of Dentistry in 1996. He has furthered his education through the Dawson Center for Advanced Study, which focuses on comprehensive, restorative dental care, and the Hornbrook Group, which focuses on cosmetic dentistry.\n\nDr. Glass maintains membership in the American Dental Association, the Academy of General Dentistry and the local and state dental societies and has co-chaired activities locally for Childrenâ€™s Dental Health Month.
