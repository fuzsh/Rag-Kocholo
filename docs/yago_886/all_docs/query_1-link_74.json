Lawn chair rentals will be available for all concerts at our TD Pavilion. Chair rentals will improve the efficiency of the security process at our entry gates and improve available space and sightlines on the lawn. At the end of the performance, patrons can either return their chairs to the rental location or leave their chairs on the lawn to be picked up by a Mann team member. Lawn chair rentals can be purchased in advance ($10) or in-person at the event ($15). Please visit the Lawn Chairs page to learn more.\n\nSmoking\n\nIn consideration of our patrons and in compliance with the City of Philadelphia Ordinance maintaining smoke-free Parks & Recreation facilities, the Mann maintains a smoke-free campus. This include e-cigarettes and cannabis.\n\nSecurity Screening\n\nAll patrons will be required to pass through a magnetometer (hand-wanding/screening is available upon request). Bags and backpacks are subject to search upon entry to the venue. Due to artist restrictions, permitted and non-permitted items are subject to change without notice. The Mann has the right to restrict any items at any time without prior warning.\n\nRe-Entry\n\nRe-entry is not permitted. (Patrons are permitted to return their picnics to their car on Picnic Nights.)\n\nBag Policy\n\nBags must be 12\"x6\"x12\" or smaller. For the safety of our patrons, all bags are subject to search.\n\nPicnic Nights\n\nDuring the Mann's Picnic Series, patrons may bring whatever refreshments they desire (alcohol included). If you’re planning on picnicking on the lawn pre-concert and moving to your reserved seat under cover, please be sure that your cooler is small enough (15\" x 12\") to be stowed under your seat. No glass containers or lawn chairs are allowed under cover. Re-entry is permitted on Picnic Nights so that patrons may return any picnic items or chairs to their vehicle.\n\nParking at the Mann is FREE. A map of our campus including the various parking lots can be found below.\n\nThe main parking entrance is at Belmont Avenue & Montgomery Drive. Additional entrances are located at South Concourse or 52nd Street. We recommend arriving early to avoid traffic delays! Peak traffic times are 60 minutes prior to show start to about 60 minutes after show start. Please plan accordingly. While parking is free, space is limited—come early or carpool. GPS may not account for traffic in the area, so we ask that you listen to the recommendations of the parking attendants and police on how to enter the venue.\n\nWant to park closer to the gates? Become a member to enjoy the closest (VIP Gold & VIP Silver) parking options.\n\nPremier Parking upgrades are also available for purchase on a show to show basis. Premier Parking allows you to park close to the gates and guarantee your parking spot right up to show time! Premier Parking spaces will be held for you up until the start of the show and cannot be guaranteed if you arrive after the show starts. Purchase in advance on Ticketmaster.com or day of show at the entrance to the lot, subject to availability. Rates vary by event. Cash and credit are accepted."
