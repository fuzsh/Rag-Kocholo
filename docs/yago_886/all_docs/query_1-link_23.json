        "text": "\"Remarkable\"\n\n\"Extraordinary\"\n\n\"With a thrilling musical score from Oscar nominated composer Philip Glass this film from director Brett Morgen should be a prime Oscar contender not only for Documentary Feature, but also Original Music Score, and perhaps Film Editing\"\n\n\"One of the highlights of the recent Toronto International Film Festival\"\n\nPETE HAMMOND, DEADLINE\n\n\"A stunning achievement.\"\n\nANNE THOMPSON, INDIEWIRE\n\n\"JANE is an epic romance filled with hope and brimming with a love for life and all of its ups and downs.\"\n\nAPRIL WOLFE, LA WEEKLY\n\n\"Few films this year offer up such lush and formal components. Morgen has made a film of deep emotional beauty. Required viewing for anyone seeking a classic in the making.\"\n\nKATE ERBLAND, INDIEWIRE\n\n\"One of the best documentaries of 2017. An astonishing accomplishment. Morgen is setting the bar for profile documentaries and changing the rules for his field.\"\n\nBRIAN TALLERICO, ROGEREBERT.COM\n\n\"Fantastic big-screen adventure.\"\n\nKATIE HASTY, BUZZFEED\n\n\"It's a revelation!\"\n\nMIKE HOGAN, VANITY FAIR\n\n\"Set to an almost overwhelmingly emotional original score by Philip Glass, this is a wondrous and moving account of a remarkable life that puts us right there with Goodall.\"\n\n\"JANE may be neither the first nor the last film on the pioneering British primatologist, but it will likely stand as the definitive portrait.\"\n\n\"She's an inspiring subject, honored here in a truly stirring legacy portrait.\"\n\nWondrous!\n\nDAVID ROONEY, THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER\n\n\"One of the truly immersive cinematic experiences you will have anytime soon.\"\n\nRICHARD RUSHFIELD, THE ANKLER\n\n\"A Phillip Glass score almost as brilliant as Jane Goodall herself.\"\n\nSARAH KURCHAK, CONSEQUENCE OF SOUN\n\n\"Filmmaker Brett Morgen is one of the finest stylists currently working in documentary.\"\n\n\"JANE is a beautiful, engaging work.\""
