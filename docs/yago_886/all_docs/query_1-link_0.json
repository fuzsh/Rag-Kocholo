According to Fox records the film required $500,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $125,000 so made a loss to the studio.[1] It was listed to compete at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival,[2] but the festival was cancelled due to the events of May 1968 in France. It is based on a 1905 novel Doctor Glas by Hjalmar Söderberg which had previously been made into a 1942 Swedish film of the same title.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nPer Oscarsson as Dr. Glas\n\nLone Hertz as Helga Gregorius\n\nUlf Palme as Rev.
