        "text": "Mai Zetterling came to feminism gradually. In her autobiography, \"All Those Tomorrows,\" she notes, \"When the reviews of my first full-length feature movie came out, I was horrified to read that 'Mai Zetterling directs like a man.' What did that mean?\" As an actress she was considered no threat. But when she decided to become a film director, she was \"not the same any more in the eyes of men.\" It took years to realize \"the change I had made was positive and, in the end, the only way.\""
