        "text": "Sweden, 1976\n\nDirected by Mai Zetterling\n\nStarring Zetterling, Ewa Fröling, Gunnar Furumo, Ernst Günther\n\nNew DCP restoration courtesy Swedish Film Institute. Approx. 51 min.\n\nZetterling directs and stars in this deeply personal study of a self-sacrificing woman reeling from her husband’s abandonment, told through flashbacks and fantasies. Zetterling, whose own marriage to David Hughes was falling apart, drew on her experience– “I used all the pain and misery of the break-up of my marriage. It was a bitter medicine.” Originally conceived under the working title “The Great Unwanted” for the BBC, as part of UNESCO’s international women’s year, Zetterling later took the film to Swedish Television, who wanted her to star.\n\nReviews"
