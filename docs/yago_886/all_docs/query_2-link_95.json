        "text": "This article discusses three photography books about Greenland, published almost simultaneously: Pia Arke’s Scoresbysundhistorier (2003)/Stories from Scoresbysund (2010), Jacob Aue Sobol’s Sabine (2004), and Julie Edel Hardenberg’s Den stille mangfoldighed/The Quiet Diversity (2005). It brings them together to show how they simultaneously follow recent developments in contemporary global art as well as step into the tradition of that most referential of media, photography, and manage to ‘blast’ this tradition from within, thereby representing an important renewal of the discourse of photography.\n\nAs a concept, culture can easily appear quite diffuse and it is often contested. This ambiguity begs the question of what it means to invoke the concept in particular situations. This paper is an analytic experiment, which was kick-started when I asked informants about sailor culture during fieldwork onboard the Danish fisheries inspection vessel The West Coast. In response, fisheries inspectors, surprisingly, suggested watching the Danish cult movie Martha (1967). I describe this incident as a small ethnographic moment leading me to conduct the present experiment. This involves using Martha as an analytic device to investigate sailor culture. More specifically, I use a preliminary analysis of the movie as an entry point to understand five matters of concern, which I encountered during fieldwork. With point of departure in an analytic attitude I call empirical philosophy I propose the term inter-reflexivity to characterize this mode of lateral cultural analysis. Inter-reflexivity emphasizes a double movement emerging from an ethnographic moment in the field and the creative translation of that moment into an analytic device. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of using a popular cultural artefact encountered in the field as such a device for articulating some complex, current stakes in fisheries inspection and ‘inventing’ a particular version of sailor culture.\n\nToday, Sweden enjoys a positive international reputation for its commitment to human rights issues, for instance, in relation to the recent migrant crisis. Abuses committed by the Swedish state against certain ethnic groups within the country are less well known, both within and beyond its borders. These included systematic attempts to curtail the use of indigenous and local languages, thereby causing communicative and ideological rifts between children and their parents. These policies were enacted through the school system from the 1920s until the 1970s, and particularly affected people living in the Arctic region where the national borders are disputed. In this article, we examine two twenty-first-century films set during this era, featuring feisty female characters responding to the school policy. Elina: As though I wasn't there is a children's film created by people \"outside\" the cultural group represented; and Sámi Blood features an adolescent protagonist (and her older self), created by \"insiders\" of the cultural group represented. In both films, the female protagonists' relative lack of agency within the state school system is contrasted with their powerful connections to the Arctic landscape. We seek to examine how these films contribute to the work of apology, beginning with a public acknowledgement of the wrongs of the past. Whilst one of the films concludes with a celebration of the female protagonists' agency, the other proffers a more ambiguous portrayal of power in relation to culture, nationality, and identity.\n\nAccording to most Danish historians, the German occupation during the Second World War had a limited impact on the development of Danish society - so limited that by the end of the war the Danish people (in the words of Danish historian Henning Poulsen) \"by and large picked up ... where it left off at the war's beginning.\" Even though this statement holds some immediate truth in terms of economic and political consequences, it disregards the strong impact the war had on a cultural and mental level. Even if the disruptions caused by the occupation in material and political terms were moderate in Danish society, this is probably not how the population living through the occupation construed them subjectively. Taking such considerations into account, this article suggests a new 'discourse of Danishness' promoted by the Danish state by discussing representations of the self and alien in five state-commissioned short films that were screened in the period from 1945 to 1951. The discourse, it is argued, was born out of the experience of the occupation and placed strong faith in democracy as well as a unified national sense of community accentuated by powerful us/them oppositions.\n\nIn contrast to the rich scholarship investigating male auteur directors and male polar explorers, \"Women Arctic Explorers: In Front Of And Behind The Camera\" examine some of the many women filmmakers who have made films in and about the Arctic since the 1920s. Largely absent in film history, we historicize the film production of these women film explorers with respect to their contemporary moment, but also in relation to dominant modes of cinema scholarship and Arctic studies. In this chapter we use the umbrella term “women film explorers” to account for women explorers who are themselves filmmakers, women explorers who were documented by others on film, and staged or fictionalized accounts of women explorers in the cinema. We exemplify with a number of women film explorers who contribute to critical moments in the history of Arctic explorer and ethnographic filmmaking, focusing on two periods: the 1920s-1930s and the 1960s-1970s. Examples include privately shot films for scientific purposes by American Arctic explorer Louise Boyd; Pathé newsreel coverage of Mary Stafford Peary’s travel to northern Greenland; fiction film featuring German Leni Riefenstahl on a rescue mission in S.O.S. Eisberg (Arnold Fanck, Germany/USA, 1933) and French actress Juliette Binoche as Josephine Peary in Endless Night (Nadie quiere la noche, Isabel Coixet, Spain/France/Bulgaria, 2015); commissioned ethnographic documentary by Dane Jette Bang and Swede and UK-based Mai Zetterling; and independent Scottish ethnographer Jenny Gilbertson filming in the high Canadian Arctic. We conclude by gesturing toward recent self-reflexive reactions to some of the recurring tropes of Arctic and polar explorer representation through postcolonial video art as exemplified by Greenlander Pia Arke."
