        "text": "A combative yet playful work interested in praxis, not theory. Political films, especially arthouse films, speak to the converted (primarily). At worst, they do politics for us and thus disincentive actual action; actually, at worst they foster hypocrisy: people happy to appreciate political statements in art while actually not upholding those principles through their actions.\n\nThis last point can be shown through many male characters in this film, who celebrate a feminist play but actively uphold the patriarchy. The intersection of the literary, or the fictive/theoretical, and reality is the core of this film. It uses Aristophanes’ Lysistrata to push this — the film being built around a troupe touring the play. A lesser film would merely use this play,…\n\n\"Actors are always quoting lines, confusing theater and reality.\"\n\nWomen Film Editors #52: Wic Kjellin\n\nAKA Men Ain't Shit: The Movie.\n\nAfter two decades of experience in front of the camera, Swedish actress Mai Zetterling turned to screenwriting and directing in the early 1960s, putting her personal touch on stories focused on girls and women. When the Manhattan arthouse theater Film Forum showed a retrospective of her work this past May, Zetterling's career was summed up thusly: \"Born to a working-class family in Västerås, Sweden, MAI ZETTERLING (1925-1994) first came to international attention as the 'sweet, blonde, and defenseless' (Leif Furhammar) star in post-war Swedish, British, and Hollywood movies. But she made her mark in the 1960s as the director…\n\nGood lord, where has this been hiding? Both dramatic and experimental, chic but also kinda punk, baldly and bleakly political but so much fun — I'm a little shocked this doesn't occupy a more prominent position in \"cinephile\" culture. Even in books and essays and overviews specifically about films by women, I feel like I've rarely come across any writing about this. Maybe I've just been reading the wrong books?\n\nAnyway, Zetterling really goes all out here just in terms of the variety of film language and technique she employs — so many different kinds of shots and cuts; different styles of music used in usual and unusual ways; multi-character voiceover; flashbacks, dream sequences, and pieces of Lysistrata all seamlessly…"
