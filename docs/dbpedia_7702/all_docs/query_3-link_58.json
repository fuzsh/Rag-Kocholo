        "text": "Employees are switching companies, roles, and industries at a higher frequency than ever before. This has highlighted the need for HR teams to build new strategies to retain their highest-performing employees.\n\nOne of the most important, impactful areas of employee retention is investing in its talent with a comprehensive employee development strategy.\n\nDifferent employee have unique set of strengths, experiences, and skill gaps, just like every position requires a unique set of competencies. Because of this, it often makes the most sense to pinpoint specific areas of development in corporate L&D strategies to build contextual employee development plans that encourage growth and empower internal employees to fully realize their potential through upskilling, new skill development, and the refinement of these skills.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the key areas of employee development that organizations should focus on to build future leaders and high-performers from within your current workflow.\n\nEmployee development areas, also called competencies, are core skill and knowledge areas that employees need to do their jobs effectively. Organizations can provide employees with development opportunities to upskill and improve existing knowledge and experience in specific development areas.\n\nIdentifying and targeting these different areas is a fundamental part of developing an effective L&D strategy. Engaging in development activities helps employees understand which areas they excel in, and which ones have room for improvement.\n\nBeing able to effectively collaborate and communicate is absolutely essential for employees who operate as members of a team. Encouraging employees to develop these skills leads to more efficient and active dissemination of information and encourages dialogue that can lead to innovation.\n\nTargeting written and verbal communication as well as active listening and interpersonal skills in L&D programming can help organizational leaders build a safe environment for productive dialogue and effective teamwork.\n\nExamples of collaboration and communication development and training include:\n\nTeam Building Retreats: Offsite programs focused on building trust and teamwork.\n\nInterdepartmental Projects: Collaboration between various departments to solve a common issue.\n\nEffective Communication Workshops: Techniques for assertive communication, listening skills, and more.\n\nVirtual Collaboration Tools Training: Mastery of tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Asana for remote work.\n\nConflict Resolution Scenarios: Real-world exercises to improve dialogue and understanding among team members.\n\nEmployees who can organize their workspaces and minds, and lay out strategic professional goals for themselves are instrumental in the achievement of larger organizational goals. By including goal setting and organizational skills in development efforts, L&D teams can help employees become more self-sufficient, ultimately reducing stress and increasing productivity.\n\nSome examples of goal-setting and organizational skills include schedule and deadline management, multitasking, task prioritization, and productivity. Across all of these skills, time management plays a huge part.\n\nExamples of goal setting and organization skills development and training include:\n\nSMART Goals Workshop: Training on how to set Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals.\n\nTime-Blocking Seminars: Techniques for organizing work hours more effectively.\n\nQuarterly OKR Planning Sessions: Setting milestones and deliverables for upcoming quarters.\n\nPersonal Development Plans: One-on-one coaching to identify and plan for individual training objectives.\n\nKanban or Agile Workshops: Training on using these methodologies for better task organization.\n\nProductivity is a critical employee development area because it is relevant to every aspect of work and ultimately determines the success of an organization. When employees can hone their productivity skills, they not only have a positive impact on business outcomes but also tend to become more engaged and satisfied at their work.\n\nKey skill sets related to productivity include time management, planning, and self-awareness.\n\nExamples of productivity and time management development and training include:\n\nPomodoro Technique Training: Mastering the art of short, focused work intervals.\n\nBatching Work Seminars: Training on how to group similar tasks together to reduce mental load.\n\nMindfulness Workshops: Learning to be present in the moment to improve focus.\n\nTask Automation Training: Using software to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for important work. This can also include generative AI training.\n\nDaily Stand-ups: Short, daily meetings to prioritize and manage daily tasks.\n\nBy training employees to understand and carry out tasks that lie outside their regular job responsibilities, L&D teams can help employees gain new perspectives on workplace challenges and be prepared to take on new responsibilities as needed. This employee development area is especially important in times when positions become vacant and remaining employees need to pitch in to keep things running smoothly.\n\nSkills useful for the accumulation of cross-functional knowledge are agility, communication, and of course, the relevant core professional skills.\n\nExamples of cross functional knowledge development and training include:\n\nJob Rotation Programs: Spending time in different departments to understand various roles.\n\nCross-Training Workshops: Training sessions from experts in different departments.\n\nHackathons: Multi-departmental events to solve company-wide challenges.\n\nLunch and Learns: Informal sessions where employees can learn about different facets of the company.\n\nProduct Knowledge Training: Build a comprehensive understand of your company’s products or services, the challenges they solve, and your ideal customer persona(s).\n\nCreativity is a development area that impacts just about every aspect of work. Encouraging creative thinking among employees empowers them to address common issues in innovative ways and helps keep businesses competitive in evolving industries.\n\nSkills that contribute to this employee development area are pattern identification, imagination, critical thinking, and confidence.\n\nExamples of creativity development and training include:\n\nDesign Thinking Workshops: Learning methodologies for problem-solving and innovation.\n\nBrainstorming Sessions: Facilitated group activities to generate new ideas.\n\nCritical Analysis Seminars: Exercises in breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.\n\nInnovation Competitions: Internal contests for developing new product or service ideas.\n\nCreative Writing Exercises: Learning to articulate ideas in new and engaging ways.\n\nOf course, the particular skill areas that will be most important to focus on may differ across organizations. Before charging ahead in any one direction, it is essential to perform thorough assessments to determine which employee development areas are the most relevant to the needs of individual team members and the goals of the larger organization. From there, L&D teams can build out the most effective employee development strategy for their organizations.\n\nFormal face-to-face learning and traditional training workshops are the most familiar and conventional methods of team member development. These activities vary significantly in format and modality but often include a traditional classroom setting with a blended learning approach that provides online learning, in-person lectures, videos, and practical exercises.\n\nThis type of learning generally works well for teaching employees both hard and soft skills. Still, in recent years, we have learned that many employees benefit from alternative methods, whether they supplement traditional training or replace it completely, often depending on the individual learning styles of different team members.\n\nWith mentorship or coaching, employees are paired with more senior colleagues or designated coaches to learn the skills they need to be successful in their roles. These relationships can be formal or casual, but in any situation, these relationships require commitment and energy from both parties.\n\nThis method serves not only as a tool for skill acquisition, but a leadership opportunity for employees doing the mentoring. Coaching relationships tend to be shorter-term and can involve hiring professional dedicated coaches to improve performance, while mentorships tend to last years and focus more on overall development rather than immediate performance.\n\nOn-the-job training is an employee development method that happens during regular work hours, within everyday workspaces. This approach often entails observational learning in combination with hands-on activities under supervision by an experienced team member.\n\nThis method is about learning by doing, speeding up the time to proficiency, and creating an environment where employees can ask questions and develop relationships with their supervisors using their real tasks and processes to learn in the flow of work.\n\nWith a digital adoption platform (DAP) like Whatfix, L&D teams can enable their employees with in-app experiences that guide them through complex processes contextual to their role with step-by-step instructions that overlay their applications. With Whatfix Self Help, employees can use a searchable self-help wiki to find all contextual documentation, company information, playbooks, training materials, tutorial videos, and more – related to the task they’re working on.\n\nCross-training is a professional development method where employees learn to perform tasks outside of their usual roles to help them become more well-rounded and versatile, as well as build company and product knowledge. This approach often involves pairing two employees from different areas for an exchange of information, similar to mentoring and job shadowing.\n\nIn cross-training activities, one employee typically visits another to learn about different job functions, sometimes shadowing them and even carrying out various tasks under supervision.\n\nThis method is relatively informal, and it benefits both parties by allowing the visiting team member to build on their communication and leadership skills. In contrast, the learning team member gains a more holistic understanding of different areas of business. This practice also prepares employees to be more versatile and move into new roles and responsibilities more efficiently.\n\nAnother more traditional professional development method is feedback and performance reviews. In this approach, managers meet with their employees at least once per year to discuss employee progress and performance and determine realistic goals for overcoming areas of need moving forward.\n\nThese reviews are opportunities for managers and their employees to align their understandings of employee responsibilities and performance. They also allow supervisors to identify ways to help employees grow professionally in the future. Use these opportunities to create personal development goals for employees that can be used to measure growth.\n\nAnother very effective method of professional development is peer-to-peer learning. In these activities, employees with different skills or areas of expertise gather to exchange knowledge. This can happen in one-on-one situations or by scheduling regular group meetings where a different employee leads the group each week, teaching the others what they know best.\n\nWith this method, teams can build an engaging and collaborative work environment, and give team members opportunities to boost their confidence and demonstrate their strengths, all while helping employees grow and learn.\n\nThe most structured and formalized version of traditional training and workshops is instructor-led training. With this method of employee development, a designated instructor delivers training to many employees at once.\n\nThis method works best when the training subject is particularly complex or new to the entire group. This can also make it beneficial for organizations to bring in professional trainers or outside subject matter experts to serve as instructors rather than selecting experienced employees from within the organization.\n\nLeadership development programs are comprehensive initiatives to grow valuable employees into successful leaders. These initiatives are often long-term endeavors that provide employees with learning experiences, practical experience, and regular evaluation.\n\nThese programs generate future leaders for organizations while helping employees become more productive, self-sufficient, and capable of taking on more advanced opportunities in the workplace.\n\nOrganizations often partner with an online course provider like Udemy, Coursera, or LinkedIn Learning to provide employees with a variety of learning opportunities available anytime, at no cost to team members."
