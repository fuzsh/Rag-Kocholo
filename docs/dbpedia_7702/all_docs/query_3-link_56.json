        "text": "The internet has become an integral part of our lives, and its impact on personal growth and development cannot be ignored. With a wealth of information and resources available at our fingertips, the internet has revolutionized the way we learn, communicate, and grow as individuals. From online courses and tutorials to social media communities and self-help websites, the internet offers endless opportunities for personal growth. Whether you’re looking to acquire new skills, expand your knowledge, or connect with like-minded individuals, the internet provides a platform to achieve these goals and more. In this context, using the internet for personal growth has become increasingly popular, and it’s easy to see why.\n\nPersonal Growth: Self-awareness and balance\n\nWhen was the last time you sat quietly in a room alone? For centuries, philosophers have been commenting on our inability to quietly contemplate and stay focused on the task. Those who grew up before the internet became part of daily life may romanticize how good things were before. That said, there’s no denying that our 21st-century addiction to screens can sap vitality and meaning from life.\n\nIn previous posts, I’ve added my voice to the choir of those recommending taking ‘cyber breaks’ whenever possible, preferably at structured times (mornings, weekends, e.g.). Though work demands can make that difficult, you should take responsibility for the time you chose to waste online. Personal growth in regards to the internet matter, but what type of person are you growing into?\n\nEnriching your personal growth online and experience-basic considerations\n\nThe Internet facilitates both personal enrichment and entrapment\n\nLike the natural world, the internet is an environment all its own, one that magnifies the good, bad, and indifferent of everyday life. According to one survey, employees spend 60% of their time surfing the web for non-work related reasons. It’s easy to assume this is entirely due to a lack of willpower. However, be aware that when you succumb to apps, ads, and other online ‘newstainment,’ you’re being manipulated by experts who know all the psychological tricks for getting you to scroll down the page. Those companies best at seizing our focus are the most profitable.\n\nTristan Harris, a former product philosopher at Google, has called this dynamic “a race to the bottom of the brain stem. (1)” The brainstem houses our survival mechanisms, responding instantaneously to stimuli that trigger fear, anger, attraction, and the flight/fight dynamic. The relatively new, relentless stimulation from screens is our biggest ongoing stressor, one that impairs cognition and over time can easily result in depression, anxiety, and other health-related problems.\n\n1. Avoiding clickbait\n\nObserve your choices when surfing the net. Are you getting hooked by things like ‘listsickles’ (lists of the worst or best_______?), unscientific personality assessments, or one of those ‘only 2% of the population can______,’–when you know that’s BS? At best, these are low-value activities. At worst, you share your email address, setting yourself up for spam, and who knows what else?\n\n2. Opt for substantive content\n\nWhat do you care most deeply about?\n\nProfessional advancement?\n\nLearning better parenting skills?\n\nDo it yourself home repair? Learning a new language?\n\nBecoming active in a new cause?\n\nIt helps to reflect on those times you felt the greatest sense of accomplishment in life. Often you were using a new skill for the first time. Research shows that exposure to new ideas, e.g., knowledge about the world-at-large can be deeply satisfying, but we gain empowerment and personal growth when we use the information to develop a skill or create something for the first time.\n\nUnlike our physical environment, the internet is free ranging. It allows you to go anywhere; to take Ivy League college courses; to enjoy the reflections of the most profound thinkers in history. In this way, the internet is better because it’s an ‘enriched environment,’ as with a playground, club or any physical place that improves your life.\n\nNext, I’ll explore some basic strategies for better utilizing the internet as an enriched environment.\n\nAvoid brain atrophy by enriching your online experience\n\nThe Internet is its own complete environment, with rewards and risks that are parallel to the physical world. Most of us spend hours a day online(e.g., employees spending 60% of their WORK time surfing the web for non-work related reasons). –It’s important to learn to avoid clickbait and other low-benefit ‘newstainment’ options because it gives us more time to engage with friends, family and other carbon-based lifeforms, e.g., our pets. By doing so, we also gain greater freedom to explore internet domains that are enriched learning environments with wonderful opportunities for personal growth.\n\nStreamlining your social media feeds\n\nWe gain empowerment and achieve personal growth when we use the information to develop a skill or create something for the first time. This is unlikely to happen when we spend a lot of time on Facebook, e.g.: In an effort to practice what I preach, I just accessed my FB account and tightened my security, disabled ads, and eliminated most of my profile ‘likes. It’s tempting in the current heated political environment to unfriend acquaintances, even family members, who post things opposed to our beliefs and values. Much better, however, simply to unfollow them. I’ve also expanded my list of people in that category.\n\nUnfortunately, confirmation bias (described in previous Insights articles) shuts down reasoned discourse. While people may be slowly gaining discernment about fake news, even the best educated among us tend to discount facts that call our beliefs into question. We’re more likely to moderate our beliefs only when we’re communicating with people who we believe share our basic values. Face-to-face is always best.\n\nLinkedIn (LI): by comparison with FB, is dedicated to professional networking. At least that was its original purpose. Avoid posting or re-posting political opinions or other potentially divisive items that might upset or anger current business partners and customers. Don’t forget: these are people who can provide you with future business and important professional leads. Also, understand that when you post your profile on LI, it’s like an online resume.\n\nPersonal Growth Potential of the Internet with Companies\n\nOne great way to use the internet for personal growth is by exploring companies and organizations that offer resources and ideas for self-improvement. For instance, there are numerous websites and apps that offer courses on a wide range of topics, such as personal development, time management, and mindfulness. Some companies even offer online coaching and mentoring services, providing personalized guidance and support for individuals looking to improve their skills and achieve their goals. By tapping into these resources, you can gain valuable insights and inspiration, and develop new strategies for personal growth. Additionally, many online communities and forums provide a platform for individuals to connect with like-minded individuals and share ideas and experiences, further enhancing the potential for personal growth and development.\n\nOwdt is a web design Houston company that offers a wide range of creative services. In addition to their design expertise, Owdt also provides valuable insights and resources for individuals looking to improve their skills and knowledge in areas such as branding, marketing, and web development. Through their blog, social media channels, and other online resources, Owdt offers a wealth of ideas and inspiration for personal growth and development.\n\nLearning new things on the internet “grows” your brain!\n\nEnriched environments stimulate neurogenesis (new brain cells and synaptic connections). When you spend most of your time online only viewing things that reinforce your current understanding of reality, this can’t happen. Nor does it protect you from cognitive decline. By comparison, when we gain new insights, perspectives, and skills, we enhance intelligence, cognitive speed, and personal resilience. Benefits include a lower long-term incidence of dementia, as with exercising, switching to a healthier diet and interacting with family and friends.\n\nA few final tips for using the Internet as an enriched environment\n\nJoin LinkedIn and other professional site social networking groups that match your interests/background. Contribute to online discussions to forge new contacts.\n\nSign up for an online course, e.g. one of the free ‘Massive Online Open Courses” (MOOC), e.g., harvard.edu, where you get the same top-notch lectures that Ivy League students experience. Or, if you want to explore tutorials that are more basic on subjects ranging from the sciences to the humanities, explore Khan Academy’s free, award-winning course module listings.\n\nA few nuts and bolts choices in this category"
