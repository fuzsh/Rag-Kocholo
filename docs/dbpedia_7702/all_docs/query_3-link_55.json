        "text": "When you’re balancing work, school, family, and a social life, it can sometimes feel difficult and unimportant to make time for yourself. For graduate students, it can feel like your coursework is taking over, leading to stress and test anxiety.\n\nIt’s important to address these feelings when they come up, so they don’t progress into burnout. Check in with yourself on a regular basis so you can understand the root of your discomfort and remind yourself of your strengths, personal values, and goals. Practicing self reflection and asking self discovery questions can be an empowering way to challenge your beliefs, gain clarity on your life’s path, and apply creative solutions to the challenges you face.\n\nBenefits of Self-Reflection\n\nSelf reflection means taking the time to look both more deeply into yourself—and more broadly at the external forces that are shaping your life. Practicing self reflection takes honesty and discipline. Meditation, self discovery journal writing, and contemplative thought are all powerful tools for self reflection. Cultivate the practice that resonates for you. Self reflection can help you:\n\nDevelop emotional intelligence\n\nIncrease your confidence\n\nStrengthen your integrity\n\nStart communicating more clearly\n\nDiscover your most authentic self\n\nRaise self awareness and self love\n\nStrengthen your relationships\n\nLearn to make sounder decisions\n\nGain insight about optimizing your skillset\n\nWeekly Self-Discovery Questions\n\nTo help spark your practice of self reflection, we’ve put together a list of 57 self discovery questions to ask yourself. Start with one each day and, after a couple of weeks, increase this to 10 to 15 per week. You can do self exploration and find answers in a self discovery journal, in your head, or by filling out the blanks in the printables below.\n\nSelf\n\n1.
