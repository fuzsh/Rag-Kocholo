        "text": "What is the four agreements about and what are the four agreements in summary?\n\nDo you want to unlock your full potential and overcome the negative patterns in your life then this four agreement book summary by Don Miguel Ruiz is for you.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz wrote the four agreements book in 1997. This book has been a best seller for 8 years in New York and the lives of many people have changed.\n\nThis book is highly influential and is a practical guide to personal freedom written by Don Miguel Ruiz.\n\nBe impeccable with your words.\n\nThe four agreements summary describes the words as more powerful than we realize. They are the building blocks of labels, concepts, and beliefs. Therefore, we must be cautious before using words as we could potentially create new, harmful illusions. The easiest way to do this is to get into the habit of only saying what you mean and meaning only what you say. If in doubt, say nothing.\n\nLanguage is a form of creative power; it is the way we make our intentions known. We exemplify who we are using words, and they have the power to create beauty but also to destroy it. Being impeccable means taking responsibility for one’s words and deeds but not judging or blaming oneself.\n\nUsing the power of your words with truth and self-love will help you to overcome negative thoughts. Positive thinking will help to create ideas in the mind, change reality and change opinion.\n\nFor example, There was a smart and good-natured lady. One day she became tired of work and had a headache. On that day her daughter was very happy, she was singing loudly. Her mother scolded her by saying that her voice is terrible and asked her to stop singing.\n\nThese words change her daughter’s life. She started thinking that her voice was not good. She stopped singing forever and got scared to talk to others because of the thought that her voice was not good enough.\n\nThe first lesson we learned from this book summary is that we should always speak positive words and have love in your words for others and for yourself too, and never gossip or say bad words.\n\nDon’t take anything personally\n\nDon Miguel suggests that we don’t seek out information from others, as their views are never actually relevant. Instead, focus on accepting and improving yourself.\n\nSometimes people take others’ words personally then they agree with those words. If we take anything personally then we have an agreement with these words. Personal importance is a trap that every single thing is connected with us but in reality, it is not.\n\nBecause what folks say and how people behave with us are not connected. It only depends on our beliefs, emotions, and opinions. If someone is happy then the opinion of the person is great about you or when the person is sad or angry then his opinion changes.\n\nSo always remember who you are. When we believe in ourselves then nobody affects us however everyone is different and has different perspectives.\n\n4 agreements summary guides that if you take anything personally means you agree on bad opinions, you take the poison from that person which makes you feel bad or get angry. And by doing this you make them feel good.\n\nDon’t make assumptions\n\nDon Miguel recommends asking questions and maintaining clear communication with others. This transparent communication prevents assumptions from taking hold.\n\nDon’t assume anybody asks questions because most of the time when someone avoids us creating misunderstandings based on assumptions. Assumptions are a trap because we believe facts that our minds create. We tend to see and hear only what we want to.\n\nFor example, In a relationship, each party can make assumptions about the other without clear communication. When the relationship falls apart, the two are shocked by each other’s reality. Thus, relationships are more likely to succeed if the people in the relationship accept one another and have similar values.\n\nCommunication is key to resolving misunderstandings. Ask questions if you want to clarify things. It is the only way we overcome the assumptions.\n\nHave the courage to ask questions, and always speak as clearly as possible. Don’t assume anything about anyone. Explain clearly and don’t give others an opportunity to assume.\n\nAlways do your best\n\nDon Miguel suggests that we should work hard because it makes us happy rather than external motivation.\n\nWe learn from our childhood that we have to do our best. But remember one thing our best depends on the situation.\n\nFor example; in the morning we are active and our best is different and in the evening when our energy level is different or our best is different. But we have to do our best for ourselves. With hardwork no need to blame yourself.\n\nSalary is the reason if someone works for salary and does not enjoy their work field then they are always waiting for weekends for fun. Find the job you will enjoy.\n\nWe should always do our best regardless of the situations because that is what winners do. Don’t take action just to get rewards. People don’t enjoy what they do and because of that they are not able to do their best.\n\nDoing your best will give you a lot of opportunities that will make you successful.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat are the four agreements we have learned that we should always watch our words and always be positive with our worlds?\n\nSecond thing which we learned is that we should not take anything personally by doing this we are only hurting ourselves.\n\nThird thing which we learn from the four agreements book summary that never make assumptions about someone else without clarifying with them personally.\n\nThis only makes us negative about the person.the fourth thing we learned from always do things which you like or enjoy to do by doing this practise we can easily get success in life and make most of it.\n\nKey Takeaways from the Book\n\nFAQ\n\nWho is the author of book ?\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz is a renowned spiritual teacher and internationally bestselling author of the” The Four Agreements”.\n\nWhat is the year of Publish?\n\nThis book was published in 1997 by Amber-Allen Publishing.\n\nGive Summary in one sentence?\n\nThe Four Agreements draws on the long tradition of the Toltecs, an ancient, indigenous people of Mexico, to show you that we have been domesticated from childhood, how these internal, guiding rules hurt us and what we can do to break and replace them with a new set of agreements with ourselves.\n\nWhat is the key Idea of book?\n\nThe Four Agreements replace conflict, drama, and needless emotional suffering with happiness, personal freedom, love, and respect for one’s “self” and all life."
