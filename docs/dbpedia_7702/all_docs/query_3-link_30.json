        "text": "When you begin to focus on your growth, you tend to run headlong into tons of jargon. Self-growth, personal development, mindfulness, affirmations, intentions, self-care, self-love, self-acceptance…I could go on for days, but I won’t. You get it; the journey to becoming your best self is filled with an abundance of terms and concepts. You’ve heard me mention all of the above if you have watched any of my Get Your Life Together Monday Lives on Instagram.\n\nWith so many concepts available, many start their inward journey feeling overwhelmed and even shaken by how much there is to learn. I want you to know that feeling is perfectly normal. Many in the “Self-Help” field do their best to overcomplicate just about everything, which is frustrating. Why dissuade someone who is trying his or her best to learn? That seems counter-intuitive.\n\nWith that being said, it’s my goal to make your journey toward healing, to becoming your very best, and living mindfully as simple as possible. That includes helping you understand the basics.\n\nLet’s start with an understanding that most get wrong—the difference between personal growth and personal development. These two concepts are often interchanged, but they are actually different. In fact, one is the way to becoming, the other is the becoming. Don’t worry, I’ll explain.\n\nPersonal Development:\n\nThe definition of personal development comes down to the activities used to improve your awareness and identity. It’s the development of your talents and potential. It’s learning how to live an enjoyable, grounded, and realized life. Think of it as your tools and systems to get where you want.\n\nThe goals of personal development are plentiful.\n\nImproving self-awareness\n\nExtending the knowledge of the self\n\nImproving existing skills and developing new ones\n\nBuilding or renewing strong self-esteem and personal identity\n\nDeveloping your strengths, talents, and purpose\n\nImproving your life’s potential\n\nImproving your health\n\nCreating and living within a personal development plan\n\nImproving relationships\n\nIncreasing spiritual awareness and spiritual growth\n\nSome even place building personal wealth under the framework of personal development.\n\nAs you can see, personal development is, well, personal, naturally, but it also entails an emotional, physical, and spiritual journey. Personal development is all about taking deliberate steps toward making substantial and grounded changes in your life.\n\nWhile all of this sounds wonderful, you may be asking how personal development happens…\n\nThis is done through active, intentional learning. Intentional learning spans everything from reading books, listening to inspiring podcasts, hiring a life coach, following educated therapists and thought-leaders on social media, watching videos and TED Talks, attending workshops and seminars… the list goes on. It’s an active, conscious state of development.\n\nWhen you are focused on personal development, you become driven to create more despite where you’ve been, where you are currently, and begin to shape and identify who you are working to mindfully become.\n\nPERSONAL GROWTH:\n\nWith personal development being the tools to get you where you want to be, personal growth is the benefit of your action. Personal growth does mean different things to different people, but ultimately, think of it as your end goal. I should add it’s an end goal that is always a moving target and frankly shouldn’t be an end. Active growth adds meaning to your life. Why would you want that to stop? You don’t. Besides, when you increase your self-awareness, given a choice, it’s unlikely you’ll go back to a life of dissatisfaction.\n\nWhile this growth can happen intentionally and unintentionally—unintentionally being due to outside circumstances—understand there is no universal strategy for personal growth and gain.\n\nEven without a universal, set-in-stone plan, actively being within your growth helps you evolve. It guides you into becoming the person you were motivated to be when you began your personal development journey.\n\nThere are symptoms of personal growth that become active, everyday behaviors and habits once you begin to live in a mindful, growth-framed lifestyle—besides being happier and more grounded, of course.\n\nYou’re likely to experience:\n\nIncreased confidence\n\nEmbrace empathy and sympathy for others\n\nImproved mental, emotional, and physical health\n\nImproved relationships\n\nSelf-love\n\nRelease of self-doubt\n\nIncreased motivation\n\nPersonal care\n\nBecome more proactive and goal-focused\n\nLess likely to react negatively to outside forces and situations\n\nMental clarity\n\nHealed past\n\nLet go of habits, relationships, and things that no longer serve you\n\nRelease the idea of limitation\n\nBecome far more resilient\n\nManage stress far more effectively\n\nShare more of yourself\n\nIncreased willpower\n\nMake better decisions\n\nHelp and serve others in a grounded way\n\nGoals increase\n\nInner strength and power\n\nLive in a growth mindset, mindfully\n\nSign you up, right?\n\nAs you begin or continue in your personal development and growth journey, it’s essential to understand that each thing you engage in lends itself to the next. Don’t get caught up in the jargon. Instead, do what feels right for and to you. The journey to your best self is an individual one, as I mentioned. So, let go of the comparison factor. While our lives may have many of the same elements, circumstances, and experiences, they are never the same. Two people that experience the same situation will always view it from different perspectives; remember that. Why? Your thoughts. Your thoughts dictate where you are headed in this life and how you experience it.\n\nLet me ask this: Where are you in your journey? Are you focused on the development, or are in enjoying the benefits of personal growth? By the way, that’s a trick question. Ideally, you always want to be in the development of personal growth. The more you learn, the greater your life experience.\n\nCheers to your growth…\n\nDanielle A.
