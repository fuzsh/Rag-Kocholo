        "text": "1997 American self-help book by Miguel Ruiz\n\nThe Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom is a self-help book by the author Don Miguel Ruiz. The book outlines a code of conduct based on Toltec teachings that purport to improve oneâ€™s life.\n\nThe book was originally published in 1997 by Amber-Allen publishing in San Rafael, California. An illustrated edition was later published by the same company in 2010 to celebrate the book's 15th anniversary.[1]\n\nFirst published in 1997, the book gained popularity after being endorsed by Oprah Winfrey on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2001 and again in 2013.[2] The book was also on The New York Times bestseller list for over a decade.[3]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the author, the book is inspired by a set of the Toltec people's spiritual beliefs. The intent of the book is to help readers explore \"freedom,\" \"happiness,\" and \"love.\"[4]\n\nThe central point is that a person's life is determined by agreements they have made with themselves, others, God, and society as a whole. Through these agreements, one determines how they see themselves, what is possible for them, how they should behave, and their worth as a person.[3][better source needed]\n\nThe book is organized via explorations of the four agreements: \"Be impeccable with your word\", \"Do not take anything personally\", \"Do not make assumptions\", and \"Always do your best.\" Chapters include the relevant linguistic and historical context for each topic. Ruiz says that by making a pact with the agreements described in the book, the individual is able to create a happier and more successful life.[5]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe book has sold approx. 15 million copies in the United States,[3] and is available in 53 languages.[6][7][a] In 2001, the book was featured in O, The Oprah Magazine, where the author was interviewed by Ellen DeGeneres. The book was also featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2001 and on the television show Super Soul Sunday in 2013. The book spent two years on the Publishers Weekly bestsellers list and over a decade on that of The New York Times.[3]\n\nFormats\n\n[edit]\n\nThe book is available in the following formats; hardback, paperback, eBook, audiobook, a colour-illustrated book, a card-deck and as an online course.[3]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
