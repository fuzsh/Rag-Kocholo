        "text": "Gerry Ellen categorizes the ten most inspirational philosophies of Don Miguel Ruiz. Prepare for perspective presented by a modern day Mexican spiritualist.\n\nHere is a man who I cannot seem to get enough of in my daily life. His words, his message and his understated way of assimilation makes reading his books a true mission of awareness and understanding. His offerings stand the test of time and give me more in the way of wisdom and true meaning than many others who share their collective inspiration in novels and living life to the fullest. The Toltec wisdom is so pure and so alive and so natural that the philosophy behind each thought, feeling and action coexist with the rhythms of our society. If only we can continue to wrap our arms around how simple it is.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz was born in late August, 1952. He is a Mexican author of Toltec spiritualists and neo-shamanistic texts. His teachings are of the New Age philosophy from the ancient Toltec wisdom, whose primary intention was to achieve a pure state of happiness. His first book The Four Agreements became an instant bestseller.\n\nThe man is a living legend.\n\nSince the conclusion and continued positive viral effects of his first book, he has gone on to publish three more books (the fifth one co-authored with his son). Each novel possesses words and guidance that can help anyone achieve a truer state of enlightenment and awareness.\n\nHere are a few nuggets of wisdom from his books and random phrases he spoke in his teachings. I follow each inspirational thought with my own understanding of his words:\n\n“And what is the right woman, the right man? Someone who wants to go in the same direction as you do, someone who is compatible with your views and your values—emotionally, economically, physically, spiritually.”\n\nMy take on this is coexisting with your partner in a way that continually produces alignment in all facets of love and life.\n\n“What you will see is love coming out of the trees, love coming out of the sky, love coming out of the light. You will perceive love from everything around you. This is the state of bliss.”\n\nI am a huge lover of nature and every sound, sight and smell related to the outdoors. If I can’t appreciate the beauty in each, then I feel I have nothing to offer another.\n\n“True justice is paying only once for each mistake. True injustice is paying more than once for each mistake.”\n\nIt sounds fairly simple, that genuinely apologizing for a mistake and never repeating it thereafter will help further you down the path to truth and complete honesty.\n\n“I will no longer allow anyone to manipulate my mind and control my life in the name of love.”\n\nIt took me many years to gather the steam to have a voice, and use my voice to make changes within. I realized I was the one in control of my own life and choices. Period.\n\n“Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive—the risk to be alive and express what we really are.”\n\nAs difficult as it is to allow the notion of death to grip us in turmoil, being awake and present is even more challenging and demands our full attention when relating to others, and even ourselves.\n\n“Don’t take anything personally. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dreams. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.”\n\nI love this quote, as it draws in all aspects of a sensitive self. However, having personal boundaries is essential to continued happiness.\n\n“People are starving for love, not knowing their heart is a magical kitchen. Open your heart. Open your magical kitchen and refuse to walk around the world begging for love. In your heart is all the love you need. Your heart can create any amount of love, not just for yourself, but for the whole world.”\n\nI’m not sure much more needs to be said on this poignant quote, as the heart leads the way in love.\n\n“You express your own divinity by being alive and by loving yourself and others.”\n\nThe goal of any relationship is to be a complete person and one with the Divine, before diving into soulmate union with another. I believe self-love is the answer to all relationships from the get-go.\n\n“Be impeccable with your word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.”\n\nWords can sting and hurt, just as words can heal and create change. When meeting someone new, or having words with an existing relationship of any kind, a straight-up approach is the most powerful way to foster growth.\n\n“In any kind of relationship we can make the assumption that others know what we think, and we don’t have to say what we want. They are going to do what we want because they know us so well. If they don’t do what we want, what we assume they should do, we feel hurt and think How could you do that? You should know.”\n\nAgain, we make the assumption that the other person knows what we want. A whole drama is created because we make this assumption and then put more assumptions on top of it. I had to close the wisdom nuggets with this quote, as it is the premise for many arguments and trips to the therapist’s office. Assuming anything within a twosome is probably one of the worst deal-breakers in love.\n\nMost of the above quotes were pulled from The Four Agreements and The Mastery of Love, as the wisdom for relationships from these two books are so spot-on, with love and realism in today’s world. I will end with an extra pertinent quote about life in general:\n\n“Perhaps you’re not finished with your story, and who knows if you’ll ever finish it or not. Honestly, it’s not that important.” —The Fifth Agreement\n\nI welcome you to sit with this thought and all of the relationships in your life. Feel if they are relevant to a continued bliss of loving and living, and if so then what a glorious place to be in your heart."
