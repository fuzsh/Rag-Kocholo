As a world-renowned author, speaker, shaman, and healer Don Miguel is best known for his global bestseller, The Four Agreements. I discovered his work when I was in college and that very book was one of my stocking stuffers. There was something that lit me up about the concept that if I could do four simple, but very complex, things I could live a life of freedom. They were to: 1) Be impeccable with your word. 2) Don’t take anything personally. 3) Don’t make assumptions. 4) Always do your best.\n\nOver time, like many good concepts, I forgot about the book completely. I grew into my age and career and lost that type of reflection and connection with myself. Then after a significant internal evolution in 2019, I came across an event where Don Miguel and his sons were the main attraction. Something inside me and my partner said, “Yes! Let’s do this!”\n\nDuring the Gathering of the Shamans in Sedona, we both fell in love with the Ruiz family. Their presence, their energy, and the love that runs through their veins are so unconditionally given to every living being around them. After hearing them all speak, and soaking in their good vibrations, we just knew there was more wisdom that we were open to gain.\n\nThankfully we learned of their “The Dawn of a New Day” 5-day power journey in Mexico to live our lives with Gratitude, Love, Loyalty, and Justice, Beginning with Ourselves and continuing with our loved ones. This life-changing program helped us return to our innate wisdom, and live our life based on truth. The Ruiz family guided us to understand that the agreements we make are ultimately about seeing our whole reality through the eyes of truth. The result of practicing these agreements helped us move into complete acceptance of ourselves just the way we are, and the complete acceptance of everybody else just as they are. And while we’re still on a daily journey to live this way, the reward for doing that work is eternal happiness.\n\nAnd for me, the greatest happiness is sharing life-altering lessons with others who are curious and open to receive. So here are the 11 greatest pieces of wisdom I gained from the Ruiz family and the Toltec Traditions:\n\nEvery time you judge someone, you’re punishing them for agreements they never made. People prefer to judge other people’s homes instead of changing their own. Once we realize that we can’t control anyone else, then we’re free from the war.\n\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent. If you don’t judge yourself, no one else can judge you.\n\nWhen someone hurts you, you begin to use those thoughts to hurt yourself. We are constantly punishing ourselves for not being perfect in the eyes of others.\n\nGuilt is punishing yourself for something you wanted to do and Redemption is when you forgive yourself and change. It’s normal to feel pain but you don’t have to hold onto it.\n\nYou are only responsible for your own story. Let yourself go of the burden of thinking otherwise.\n\nTo forgive is to accept. A belief only exists for as long as you say yes to it. Forgive yourself for ever saying yes to it. Healing is when the past doesn’t corrupt the present.\n\nBecome the love of your own life – marry yourself! If you can’t stand being alone by yourself then the relationship between mind and heart is off. Connect those two and fall in love with your perfection! Then you get to feel at home wherever you are because your body is your one true home.\n\nTruth is a feeling – a vibration. It’s not a war between love and hate, it’s a war between truth and lies. Get clear on the difference and live in the truth.\n\nA moment of clarity followed by action becomes a pivotal moment of our life. A moment of clarity without action just passes in the wind.\n\nLove is an energy that allows us to create a bond. Love is contagious. There’s no retiring from being love. So get over yourself to deliver love.\n\nYou heal the world by healing your own world. We all have a world around us that impacts so many lives outside of your own. By opening your heart to pure love, you help others to see that possibility for themselves. A true healer is someone who heals themselves of their own lies. You can change the world by changing your own world.\n\nShould you connect with any of this wisdom or the Four Agreements above, I encourage you to listen to your intuition and go on your own power journey to discover where you are protecting your own pain so you deny yourself the bliss that exists on earth today. Deep down, you know the truth. You simply need to listen and return to its calling.\n\nWill you?"
