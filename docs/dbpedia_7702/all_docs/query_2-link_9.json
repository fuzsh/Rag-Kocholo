        "text": "There are some books I picture sitting on my future bookshelf I plan to build in my future home. I imagine this shelf to have influential books that I would like to keep revisiting in my life. I picture the shelf to have a wide range of books — some influential, some informational and some that I’d categorize as ‘reminder books’. These are books that have timeless messages. I consider the Four Agreements to be one of them.\n\nI first came across Don Miguel Ruiz through Aubrey Marcus on the Tim Ferriss show. In the past I’ve refrained from reading books that sound overly spiritual and a bit too ‘Deepak Chopra-esque’. Although The Four Agreements has this overlay of spiritual language, the core messages are actually good reminders on how to live and navigate our lives. Although it’s more of a book I would gift to someone in their early twenties (to have maximal effect) I would still recommend it to people of all ages. It’s a good reminder to bring you back to core foundational principles you can use to life your life.\n\nRuiz use of imagery is beautiful and effective. Which is why I would suggest you read the book to fully internalize his message. However, for the purposes of these notes I will distill it down to its bare bones without the parables and analogies.\n\nThe Agreements\n\nDue to social conditioning from a very early age, or “domestication” as per the book, we build up this image of ourselves as a response to what society wants and, more often, what people close to us like our parents want. This conditioning leads to unrealistic expectations we set for ourselves and others; that in turn leads to insecurities and judgement, respectively.\n\nAgreements are basically the assumptions that we’ve grown up to believe from a very early age. These agreements have built up a symbolic house of cards that needs to be brought down. Ruiz implores us to expunge ourselves of these agreements and start from scratch (more on this later). Once we’ve broken down all our previous agreements we are free to change our whole system of agreements and start by making 4 new agreements, that are essentially four core principles. These principles have stemmed from ancient Toltec wisdom but has proliferated into other cultures and religions.\n\nThe Four Agreements are:\n\nBe impeccable with your word.\n\nDon’t take anything personally.\n\nDon’t make assumptions.\n\nAlways do your best.\n\nMitote\n\nThe Mitote is what is essentially what Maya is in Buddhism. It’s the illusion, the noise in our heads, the chatter that we often can’t stop, the ‘other’ in your head that keeps judging you constantly. This Mitote is like a fog that prevents you from seeing the truth, from seeing who you really are.\n\nPersonal Power = Mental Bandwidth\n\nWe wake up with a certain amount of personal power everyday. This tank gets replenished overnight and expires at the end of the day. Hence, we have to choose how to best spend this energy. The agreements we’ve made with ourselves in the past, i.e. our social conditioning, takes up a big chunk of this personal power. For example, the personal judge in our head judging each and every one of our moves preventing us from being present is a load on our mental bandwidth.\n\nThis is something I’ve learned from from other books and podcasts. The term I use to refer to it is ‘mental bandwidth’. It’s similar to what Cal Newport mentions in his book, ‘Deep Work’ — the idea that you only have a certain number of bullets everyday. You can choose to aimlessly shoot, i.e. spend your mental energy (or personal power) on things that don’t matter or spend it on things that do. Shoot wisely.\n\nThe First Agreement: Be impeccable with your word\n\n“Intent manifests through word”. Sam Harris’ book, Lying, is essentially what the first agreement is all about. What we say and what we put out into the world should align with what we stand for, what we truly believe and what we truly feel. Your word should be tied to our intentions. This makes us more conscious of what we’re saying and feeds intent as a result. To know more about lying and its repercussions, see my book notes on Lying by Sam Harris.\n\nClear Lens\n\nOur opinions and beliefs are partially built on seeds planted by things we hear, or something a friend mentioned to us. We are unaware of how we’re affected by someone’s opinion. If someone tells you, “That Rampage movie was horrible! A complete waste of time!”. When you do end up watching the movie, depending on the relationship with the person the opinion was from, you might either conform to their view or revolt against it to subconsciously prove them wrong. Either way you’re not allowed to be in tune with what you truly feel about the movie. The goal should be to try to avoid biases and keep a blank slate.\n\nGossip, according to Ruiz, leads to biases which end up tainting the lens through which we view the world. This gossip then spreads like virus tainting the lenses of many people thereby creating an epidemic that prevents them from living their truth. The part where Ruiz draws an analogy of skin disease with people not living their truth is fascinating has many levels to it. I’d recommend reading that part to completely internalize the importance of living your truth that he’s trying to convey.\n\nThe Second Agreement: Don’t take anything personally\n\nNot taking anything personally comes from a place of having a solid understanding of who you are. Self-awareness builds a body armor that doesn’t let the unimportant penetrate and affect you. If someone is angry at you, yelling at you or trying to cause you harm it has almost nothing to with you. It is more a reflection of what they’re going through. So, don’t take anything personally.\n\nThe Third Agreement: Don’t make assumptions\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\nThe Fourth Agreement: Always do you best\n\nThe important thing to note is that “your best” varies from day to day. So don’t be too hard on yourself. Some days you can run, some days you can walk and some days all you can do is just walk one step. Take that one step. As humans we hugely overestimate what we can do in the short term and greatly underestimate what we can do in the long term. Take that step.\n\nHow to Break the Old Agreements and Free Yourself\n\nIn order to start anew and build new agreements you need to free yourself from the shackles of the old fear and hate based agreements, you need to go through a purging process to rebuild from the ground up. There are 3 ways Ruiz suggests you can do this:\n\nFace each of your fears one by one. Battle with them and break each one of your old agreements individually.\n\n(+) Guaranteed to work\n\n(-) Slow Process\n\nStop feeding the fear. Stop giving it oxygen and eventually it will die.\n\n(+) Easy to understand\n\n(-) Difficult to do\n\nDestroy yourself…symbolically of course. If you kill the host, the virus dies.\n\n(+) Faster that the first two methods\n\n(-) Requires a lot of strength\n\nFour Traits of a Warrior\n\nAwareness\n\nDiscipline: Not the discipline of a soldier whereby you’re following orders, but discipline to be who you truly are no matter what\n\nControl: Not control over others but control over yourself\n\nWarrior: A warrior refrains rather than represses his/her emotions. Instead of letting your emotions run wild, a warrior harnesses them and channels them where necessary.\n\nMortality\n\nWe need to realize that death is inevitable and might even come sooner than expected. So live the present to the fullest. This is a common theme among the past 3 or 4 books I’ve read. Whether it's Memento Mori, Carpe Diem or YOLO, it’s all essentially the same message. The fact that this ideology has stood the test of time and still persists today is a sign of its effectiveness.\n\nQuotes I Like\n\n“To be alive is the biggest fear we have. Death is not the biggest fear we have.”\n\n— Chapter 1, 25min30sec (audiobook)\n\n“The way we judge ourselves is the worst judge that ever existed.”\n\n— Chapter 1, 28min41sec (audiobook)\n\n“The agreements that come from fear require us to expend a lot of energy. But the agreements that come from love, help us to conserve energy.”\n\n— Chapter 1, 31min40sec (audiobook)\n\n“It is the emotion that controls the behavior of the human, not the human that controls the emotions.”\n\n— Chapter 2, 48min15sec (audiobook)"
