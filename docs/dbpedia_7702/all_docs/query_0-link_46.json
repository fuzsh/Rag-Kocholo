        "text": "Don Miguel Ruiz, a notable figure in the self-help and spiritual genres, is known for integrating Toltec wisdom into practical insights for personal transformation. His work, The Mastery of Love, reflects his understanding of human psychology and spirituality, drawing extensively from his lineage and experiences. Born into a family of healers in Mexico, he was expected to embrace their centuries-old legacy of healing and teaching. Ruiz initially chose to attend medical school and became a surgeon, but his path took a significant turn after a near-death experience—which ignited introspection about life and the mind. This led him to explore the Toltec teachings, which his family preserved and practiced.\n\nRuiz’s work primarily revolves around Toltec spiritualism, and its application to personal freedom and peace. His most notable work, The Four Agreements, delves into self-limiting beliefs that hinder personal growth. This book, along with The Mastery of Love and The Voice of Knowledge, constitute his major contributions to the self-help and spiritual genres. Ruiz often challenges mainstream Western psychology by proposing holistic, love-centered healing; his writing style includes allegorical storytelling and structured teaching of self-awareness. Outside of writing, he participates in lectures, workshops, and global travels to disseminate traditional wisdom and contemporary insights."
