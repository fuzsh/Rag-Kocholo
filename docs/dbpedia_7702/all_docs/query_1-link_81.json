        "text": "In The Mastery of Love, don Miguel Ruiz illuminates the fear-based beliefs and assumptions that undermine love and lead to suffering and drama in our relationships. Using insightful stories to bring his message to life, Ruiz shows us how to heal our emotional wounds, recover the freedom and joy that are our birthright, and restore the spirit of playfulness that is vital to loving relationships.\n\nThe Mastery of Love includes:\n\n• Why \"domestication\" and the \"image of perfection\" lead to self-rejection\n\n• The war of control that slowly destroys most relationships\n\n• Why we hunt for love in others, and how to capture the love inside us\n\n• How to finally accept and forgive ourselves and others\n\n\"Happiness can only come from inside of you and is the result of your love. When you are aware that no one else can make you happy, and that happiness is the result of your love, this becomes the greatest mastery of the Toltec: the Mastery of Love.\" — don Miguel Ruiz"
