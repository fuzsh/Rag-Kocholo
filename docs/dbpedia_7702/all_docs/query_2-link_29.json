        "text": "I know many of us have read books in our life that made an impact on us and they have become the books we recommend to anyone to read. I think it’s safe to say one of the books that might be on your list is The Four Agreements. The Four Agreements has been for over a couple of decades a best seller of all time and has sold over 9 million copies in the US alone and 46 languages worldwide.\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz Jr. is the son of Don Miguel Ruiz Sr. the author of the best selling book The Four Agreements. Don Miguel Ruiz Jr. at the age of 14, apprenticed to his father and his grandmother. From that early age, he was called upon to translate his grandmother’s prayers, lectures and workshops from Spanish into English. In this way, through constant repetition and review, he learned the content of her teachings in both languages.\n\nHe has written 5 best selling books sharing the wisdom and tools from the family’s tradition : “The Five Levels of Attachment”, “Living a Life of Awareness”, “The Mastery of Self”, and “The Don Miguel Ruiz’s Little Book of Wisdom”. He also co-authored the book, “The Seven Secrets to Healthy, Happy Relationships” with his dear friend, HeatherAsh Amara. He now helps others discover optimal physical and spiritual health through his books, so that they may achieve their own personal freedom.\n\nResources included in episode\n\nInspired?
