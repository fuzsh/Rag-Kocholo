        "text": "Issues In The Four Agreements By Don Miguel Ruiz\n\n1309 Words | 3 Pages\n\nTaking things personally can be a challenge for many people. When we take things personally, we are giving people more power over us than what they deserve. Taking things personally has also been an important issue that Don Miguel Ruiz has discussed in his book The Four Agreements. He explains his book that we must learn not to take things personally or we will always be faced with needless suffering. Taking things personally is difficult for people to overcome because we feel hurt, insulted, and angry because of someone, we gain a certain degree of emotional detachment from them period. On the hand, if we learn to use emotional detachment in a positive way, we can take minor and unimportant not to seriously. By doing this, we can help ourselves become less angry and feel happy. By explaining how taking things personally can become a problem and by showing how it has become a problem in my life, we can then began to discuss ways to change so that we can solve this problem.\n\nThe Four Agreements Don Miguel Ruiz Summary\n\n552 Words | 2 Pages\n\nI have started a very inspirational read that I’m half way through. The book is called The Fifth Agreement by Don Miguel Ruiz and Don Jose Ruiz. Though I am half way through the book, I notice how it is similar to their first book, The Four Agreements. The Fifth Agreement shares advice, stories, and theories that are thoroughly explained within each chapter. As being a nonfiction self-help book, the authors talk in second person, uses allusions, and adds persuasion to connect to the readers.\n\nMotivating High-Risk Youth\n\n1679 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe definition of motivation according to Kennedy (2000), “[t]he internationalist view asserts that internal and external factors influence the change process From this perspective, motivation is seen as an interpersonal process that can be influenced in a positive way by the professional (para.18). A high-risk youth is defined as a male or female between the ages of 12-17 years old who has had some contact with the law or is at risk of becoming an offender. There is a lack of motivation in some high-risk youth to positively change their lives around. According to Stinson (2009), risk factors associated with juvenile delinquency include “poor academic performance, early childhood aggression, and hyperactivity; lack of parental involvement/interaction and inadequate parental supervision and monitoring; and community/environmental factors, including access to drugs and weapons, and lack of access to community resources due to poverty” (p. 11). At risk youth that engage in community based programs in Ridge Meadows, B.C. such as KidStart, Connex, Yardworks, Community Work Service, sports and leisure and counseling, are more successful later on in their young adulthood versus high risk youth who do not attend such programs. The KidStart program is a mentoring and one-on-one program that works with youth who are at-risk and experiencing difficulties in their lives. According to PLEA (2010), “[t]he primary objective of the program is to strengthen the young person's resilience to the risk factors that are known to lead to victimization, violence and criminal activities” (para. 1). Yardworks is a program that provides youth with work experience and life skills to allow them to enter the workforce and work alongside with a PLEA staff membe...\n\nEngagement/Understanding: Social Work (Competency 6)\n\n1442 Words | 3 Pages\n\nYouth homelessness is a global social issue that is rapidly increasing. Shelton & Bond (2017) divulged how accurate data on the prevalence of youth homelessness in the United States are significantly lacking. It could be due to the challenges of collecting data and variance in definitions of what constitutes homelessness for youth. Often times there are multiple levels of oppression evident amongst vulnerable individuals. Homeless transgendered youth are susceptible to intersectionality. As stated in Competency 6, it is imperative for the ethical profession of Social Work, to be engaged and understanding of the multitude of social issues that impact individuals. Thus, Social Workers are expected to be agents of change, and it is an professional responsibility to challenge unjust policies, systems, and ideologies on the behalf of marginalized, oppressed, and vulnerable populations.\n\nDeveloping Awareness of Worker Values While Assessing Client Strengths\n\n697 Words | 2 Pages\n\nEntering the field of social work you must be prepared to encounter many personalities. Knowing this, you have to become aware of people with different backgrounds and morals. By doing this you will be able to help your clients to the best of your ability, without forcing your personal beliefs or values on to them. A value is a set of rules or or beliefs that affect your every day decisions (Sheafor & Horejsi, 2011). Applying your personal values to every situation is very important, however, you must learn to separate what you know and what is in actuality the best outcome for your client. I will be discussing the ways I feel about the “Vignette’s”, while also incorporating different things I have learned from the readings and class discussions.\n\nOne-To-1 Exercise Paper\n\n1032 Words | 3 Pages\n\nI chose Jose Herrera, a candidate for the Certificate of Youth Work at Clark University and a volunteer at Straight Up Ministries. Jose and I know one another from encounters between our mutual friends. With my knowledge of his passion for wanting to work in youth development, and my experience as a classroom teacher, I thought he would be perfect to have a one-to-one interview since our interests were similar in a way. For the interview, I did not take notes, and to my surprise, I was able to leave our interview with an overall view of Jose’s passion for working with youth, his future goals, and most importantly how our experiences as children helped mold our outlook on our work today. During the interview, Jose mentioned, “Youth are Youth”. As organizations and youth development workers, we have to stop differentiating between youth that are “at-risk”, on “the-cuff”, or won’t need that much intervention due to them being able to “survive the storm”. I hold those same principles in my teaching with different students who may learn at different paces. Jose\n\nMy Personal And Professional Values In Social Work\n\n2120 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe following paper aims to discuss and analyze the way in which my personal values intersect with the values I hold as most important within the profession of social work. It would stand to reason that these values would stand on common ground; however, there are places where my personal and professional values diverge. These conflicts may prove to be problematic within my chosen career unless I find a way to prioritize my values, or find ways for them to work harmoniously with each other.\n\nEssay About Working In High School\n\n858 Words | 2 Pages\n\nWorking teaches students about responsibility and also reinforces what they are leaning in school. Having a job while in high school is a catalyst for future responsible actions and thinking. Teens are accountable for work attendent, job perfromance, and customer satisfaction. The attendence is very essential in a work place. Teens will demonstrate the skills they acquire from work whenever they go to work, and it will be evaluated on their evaluation worksheet by their employers. For example, if teens have missed class, they would be mark for absence and it will later affect their grade. Being resposible in early ages is not very easy, some of them need to take time to work on what they are lacking of. Working will make teens feel more confident in life especially in their job performance. Having responsiblity while performing the task is important because teens know what they should and should not do that will help them avoid making mistake at work or it will lead them to satisfy the customers. In fact, students can use what they have been taught in class and apply it to their job skills because studying and practicing always come along way.
