        "text": "Today we are starting a new cycle and a new category of posts on the Empowerment Coaching blog. We will publish reviews of valuable books regularly. These are books worth reading at least once in your life, and often worth returning to discover new insights. These are books that moved us or inspired us to make a big change. They are also books that contain valuable knowledge and practical tips on personal development leading to a better, fulfilled life.\n\nWe start our series with the book \"The Mastery of Love\" by Don Miguel Ruiz.\n\nTitle and author of the book: \"The Mastery of Love\", Don Miguel Ruiz\n\nA practical guide to the art of relationships.\n\n1. What is this book about\n\nThe book \"The Mastery of Love\" reveals the secrets of personal development and a conscious approach to building relationships. \"It is only by loving and accepting yourself as you are that you can truly exist and express your personality. It would be best if you did not pretend to be someone else. If you pretend to be someone you are not, you will always fail.\"\n\nUsing the wisdom of the Toltecs, Miguel Ruiz shows how to apply this knowledge in our daily lives. The author teaches us how to build happiness first in ourselves so that we can open up to mature and conscious relationships. In a very accessible way, he shows us how to throw off masks and heal our own emotions, how to learn to truly forgive and accept ourselves and others. It proves that each of us has the power to direct our own lives and that happiness does not come from outside - its source is within ourselves.\n\nThe author also shows how to avoid common ways of thinking and acting that distance us from the happiness and joy in life. It teaches us to recognize illusions and helps us to enter the path of personal development that leads to freedom, true happiness, and love.\n\n2. Who is this book primarily for?\n\nI recommend the book to people who want to better understand the relationship with themselves and the relationships with others with whom we form relationships. I recommend it to people who are in a relationship and encounter challenges in their relationship, those who are going through a breakup, and those after breakups who want to enter a new stage of life. I recommend the book to all those for whom personal development and work on themselves are important because the book supports the development of self-awareness, self-acceptance, and self-confidence. It shows how to be happy and accept yourself as you are.\n\n3. What are the main advantages of this book\n\n\"The Mastery of Love\" is a book written in clear, simple, and understandable language, which is why reading it is a real pleasure. The text is intertwined with short, inspiring, golden thoughts highlighted in a frame, which allows reflection and a moment of attachment. The book is small, which means that you can take it with you in a backpack or handbag and use it whenever you need to stop in the rush of thoughts, look for inspiration, or simply return to important content.\n\n4. The reviewer's opinion about the book \"The Mastery of Love\"\n\nI am grateful that I came across \"The Mastery of Love\". This happened at a time when I was working a lot on building my self-awareness, I was analyzing my behavior and the behavior of people closest to me in a relationship, trying to understand these behaviors and the mechanisms that govern them. This book has changed my life and self-perception a lot, and it helps me build more mature relationships. She showed me a new perspective, encouraged me to change the way I think about myself and my partner, and gave me a sense of release and happiness.\n\nI will quote two golden thoughts that have stayed with me:\n\n\"Happiness never comes from outside\"\n\nand\n\n\"There are two halves in every relationship. Of those two halves, you're only responsible for your half. You're not responsible for the other half.\"\n\nI have this book in my library and refer to it often.\n\nThis book also became an inspiration and opened a new perspective for one of my clients, with whom I worked in the coaching process and one of the areas of work was the topic of building lasting partnerships.\n\n5. Evaluation of the book \"The Mastery of Love\" on a scale of 1-10\n\nI rate the book a 10. It opened my eyes to many aspects of my life and made it more mature and fuller.\n\n6. A few words about Don Miguel Ruiz, the author of the book\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz was born in Mexico on August 27, 1952, into a family of Mexican healers. The family expected that Miguel would also begin to explore the centuries-old healing tradition of the family and the spiritual knowledge of the Toltecs. Still, he chose modern medical studies and soon became a doctor. The event that could have cost him his life completely changed him. Falling asleep at the wheel, accident, leaving the body...\n\nDeeply moved by this experience, he undertook intensive practices aimed at getting to know his essence. He devoted himself to the study of ancient knowledge and then passed on the teachings of the ancient Toltecs to representatives of the Western world. It is Miguel Ruiz who is today one of the most devoted propagators of Toltec knowledge and wisdom.\n\nWho were the Toltecs? According to anthropologists, they are ancient people living in what is now south-central Mexico. The word Toltec itself means \"artist, master\", but in the circles that cultivate the teachings described today, it is assumed that the field of this artistic activity was life. Toltec knowledge is supposed to help shape lives and make them a work of art.\n\nMiguel Ruiz is the author of the world's best-selling books on self-development and a spiritual guide. He is the author of the books \"Four Agreements\", \"The Fifth Agreement\", \"The Mastery of Love\" discussed today, and \"Three Questions\".\n\nThe author of the book review \"The Mastery of Love\" is Agnieszka Kucza, Coach and Mentor at Empowerment Coaching Krak√≥w.\n\nAgnieszka works with clients in the field of life coaching, career coaching as well as managerial coaching and mentoring. Her extensive professional experience in the areas of Purchase-to-Pay, Financial Projects, transformation, and the use of LEAN in Finance makes her understand the needs of business clients well.\n\nKnowing perfectly the realities of the operation of smaller and larger companies, Agnieszka also understands well what their employees struggle with daily.\n\nSee also:\n\nThe book \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" - Spencer Johnson"
