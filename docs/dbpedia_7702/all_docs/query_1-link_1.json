        "text": "Miguel Ruiz was born in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, on August 27, 1952. He is the youngest of eleven brothers and two sisters. Although his family was very poor, Miguel benefitted from a good education. He attended primary and secondary school in Tijuana, and received his baccalaureate in Mexico City.\n\nHe then went on to study Medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In 1979, he completed his undergraduate internship. After performing his Social Service, he received the title of Surgeon and started practicing neurosurgery in Tijuana, B.C., with his older brother Carlos Ruiz.\n\nIn 1986, Miguel made the decision to leave medicine and emigrate to San Diego, California. As someone born from a lineage of shamans, he was compelled to share the philosophy he inherited from his ancestors. As a scientist, he wished to find answers to his own questions regarding the human mind.\n\nHis mother, Sarita Vasquez, tutored him in the Toltec tradition until he was inspired to start his own teachings. Since that time, he has worked with thousands of students, leading spiritual journeys to the pyramids of Teotihuacan, Mexico, and to many sacred sites around the world.\n\nDuring the initial years of his teaching, he created tools to assist students struggling to quiet their minds. The result of this work was The Four Agreements, his first publication. The book contains practical steps that can result in long-term personal transformation.\n\nThe Four Agreements immediately became an international best-seller, published in 52 languages. Since its release in 1997, don Miguel has published more than a dozen books, each going deeper into the wisdom that defines his unique teaching and life experience.\n\nBy exploring the human mind from a shamanic as well as scientific perspective, don Miguel has combined old wisdom with modern insights, creating a new message for all mankind. In the year 2000, don Miguel initiated an intensive course, known as Toltec Dreaming, for select apprentices. These monthly workshops lasted for over a decade, and still inform his lectures, online classes, and published writings.\n\nDon Miguel is highly respected throughout the world. He has received numerous recognitions, including a U.S. Air Force challenge coin, engraved with The Four Agreements. He received the 2023 Latino Spirit Award in the “Achievement in Literature” category, awarded by The California Latino Caucus. He is referenced as a National Heirloom of Mexico. He received an honorary doctorate from Universidad Instituto Americano, and in 2017 he was inducted in the Tijuana Hall of Fame. He is soon to be given the keys to the city of Tijuana."
