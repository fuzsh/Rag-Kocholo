        "text": "Making Promises to Ourselves\n\nOur personal power is based on the agreements we make, and often we make those agreements to please others, rather than being true to ourselves. In doing so, we give away our personal power. The Four Agreements is about taking back our personal power by being authentic and by adhering to our true selves. The four agreements are: 1) Be impeccable in your word, 2) Don't take anything personally, 3) Don't make assumptions, and 4) Always do your best. While simple, these agreements are anything but easy. Ruiz encourages readers to practice these agreements everyday and forgive ourselves when we are not perfect. The effort is what's most important. This book is a quick read (or listen) and should be reread repeatedly if you truly desire to keep your agreements with yourself.\n\nThe Four Agreements\n\nI am so glad I picked up this book! My life had fallen off track, lost in a huge slump of depression. The message in this book helped me rise above my own harsh criticism and stop being the victim. Now I focus on each day, being the very best I can be without judging myself, always striving to keep each of the very important four agreements.\n\nBlew my mind\n\nI usually dont listen to or read bookd because i find them so incredible boring and worthless, but this was really THE exeption. I love it. Best book ever.\n\nLife changing\n\nThe deep wisdom in this book gave me a light that shined and uplifted my heart to have hope and faith in myself when I was about to give up.\n\nMust read for those who wants to find the love in themselves and the world again.\n\nTrust air\n\nEven if you leave all the spiritual things out, this has he potential to change your life. I’m not religious AT ALL but just understanding these principles and wanting to apply them has altered my perception and perspective of the world and MY LIFE. Give it a listen and try it...\n\nLifechanging!\n\nI have listened to this book 4 times now and enjoy it every time. The information taught in this book can, and will, change your life for the better if you apply it!"
