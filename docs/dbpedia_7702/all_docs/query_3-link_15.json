        "text": "Personal Growth Assessments\n\nWhat Are Your Strongest Intelligences?\n\nDevelopmental psychologist Howard Gardner developed the theory of Multiple Intelligences. According to Gardner, people have different kinds of intelligences (Linguistic; Logical-Mathematical; Musical; Bodily-Kinesthetic; Spatial-Visual; Interpersonal; Intrapersonal; Naturalistic; Existential). The Multiple Intelligences framework is fairer than IQ tests, which only measure one type of aptitude. Knowing your strongest bits of intelligence can help know how you learn best, and good learners make good leaders...and vice versa.\n\nWhat Work Makes You Feel Alive?\n\nWhat essential nature of work fills you with meaning and lets you feel fully expressed, alive with purpose, and absorbed in flow (\"sparked\")?

Knowing your strongest social drivers can help you:\n\nUnderstand how your role and work environment impact your current engagement\n\nBetter regulate your emotions\n\nBetter communicate your needs to others\n\nMake choices more suited to your own preferences\n\nCliftonStrengths\n\nCliftonStrengths, formerly known as StrengthsFinder and StrengthsQuest, is an online assessment that helps you discover your top strengths. Knowing what they are and how to use them can help you flourish in your work and everywhere else.

After taking it, you are encouraged to read your unique, personalized Strengths Insight Guide to help understand your specific Strengths; it also includes an Action Planning Guide with tips on how to apply your Strengths in your academics.\n\nThe Four Tendencies Quiz: Upholder, Questioner, Obliger, or Rebel?\n\nDeveloped by happiness and habit expert Gretchen Rubin, the Four Tendencies personality framework answers the question \"How do I get myself--and others--to do what I want?\" Knowing our Tendency can help us approach situations in ways that make us more likely to achieve our aims. We can make better decisions, meet deadlines, meet our promises to ourselves, suffer less stress, and engage more deeply with others. Just as important, understanding other people's Tendencies can help us reduce conflict and make significant...and help us to lead better.\n\nMyers & Briggs' (MBTI) Personality Assessment\n\nSelf-awareness may be the most meaningful benefit of the MBTI.

Set aside a good 30 minutes to make the most of this!\n\nWhat are your personal values?\n\nPersonal values are what people consider important in life. Although not everyone is aware of their values, they are always present in life and become visible in our attitude to the world around us and behavior in the face of various everyday situations. If you live in accordance with your core values, you feel fulfillment and satisfaction. When you are often forced to act against your personal values, you will feel an internal conflict.

You'll see how you stack up on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Neuroticism. The Big Five model of personality is widely considered to be the most robust way to describe personality differences. It is the basis of most modern personality research. This 60-question inventory is based on questionnaires used in professional research settings and will evaluate your personality on each of the Five Factors.\n\nEnneagram\n\nThe Enneagram is a valuable personal and professional growth tool because it answers the question, \"Why?\" Why would someone do that? What would motivate that behavior? And why does that lead to them thinking and behaving so differently from me? Leaders find profound value in being able to work with someone with the insight of what drives them. Knowing your personality type gives you awareness, and awareness gives you a choice. The Enneagram provides a growth path, not a diagnosis. Knowing your type is a shortcut to enhancing your self-awareness and bringing out the best in yourself.\n\nIntellectual Humility Quiz\n\nAre you willing to concede if you don't know something?

According to researchers, intellectual humility centers on recognizing the limitations of your own knowledge and beliefs, and it is linked to many benefits.\n\nBridging Differences Quiz\n\nWe humans have a deeply rooted tendency to organize ourselves into groups: you're either one of Us or part of Them.

Quiz\n\nIntelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn.

Identify your approach to opening other people's minds--and your own.\n\nPurpose in Life Quiz\n\nWhat's your purpose in life? It's a daunting question.

So why do so many of us say things like: \"I'll do the best job here, so I'll do it myself.\" \"They'll resent me asking them to do it.\" \"It's a boring job, so I'll 'lead by example' and do it myself.\" When you don't delegate, you risk ending up with too much work to do, not enough time to do it, and lots of unnecessary stress. Take this quiz to explore how well you delegate, and some resources to do it better.\n\nWhat Is Your Professional Love Language?\n\nWhich professional love language speaks most clearly to you?

The greater compassion we have for ourselves in times of difficulty, the better we can lead others with care and concern. This short self-compassion test is from Kristin Neff, Ph.D., widely recognized as one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts on self-compassion.\n\nQuiz: Are You Focusing on What's Important?\n\nIn this assessment, you can compare your priorities with how you actually allocate your time and energy.

After all, it takes hard work to become an effective leader and, if you are not prepared to put this work in or if, deep down, you're not sure whether you really want to lead, you'll struggle to convince people that you are worth following. Leaders create the vision and set the direction for their organizations. But it is their ability to motivate and inspire people that allows them to deliver that vision. So, how much do you want to lead? This quiz will help you find out.\n\nHow Good Are Your Communication Skills?\n\nAre you a clear communicator or a confusing one?

When you're done, you'll learn more about what mindfulness is, how much you currently practice it, and how you can promote more of it in your life.\n\nHow Good Is Your Feedback?\n\nOne of the most important things you do is give feedback to your colleagues.

Take this quiz to improve your feedback skills.\n\nSocial Capital Quiz\n\nOur social connections are integral to our health and happiness, but connections come in many different forms. A lifelong friendship usually feels different than a casual acquaintance you make at a networking event or a friend you acquire on Facebook.

So how much social capital do you have? Does your capital come from strong bonds to those closest and most obviously similar to you, or from connections to people spanning different backgrounds and circumstances?\n\nWhat work do you like to do?\n\nWhen you are doing tasks you like, you enjoy your work.
