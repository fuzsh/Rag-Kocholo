        "text": "A spiritual warriors path is challenging.\n\nIn The Four Agreements, Miguel Ruiz calls it a war. We will lose some battles, that’s okay. It may feel like a lot, even with the perspective of the victim persona at the time, hopeless. But it is only one battle. A Spiritual Warrior learns not to measure progress in the war using the metrics of only one battle.\n\nA Spiritual Warrior learns to retreat, rest, recover, learn from their actions, regroups, then stands up again to take another step on his path.\n\nEven in the process of losing a battle, much progress is made. The ego has pushed back, and so it is exposed, and we gain more clarity on our endeavor. The ego can even be weakened. At a minimum, we become more respectful of our foe, even if it is a dream. We become more grateful of those moments that are peaceful, and even grateful of moments where we are just holding our ground against a dream. And with that kind of experience a number of times we embrace humility, a kind of mile marker on the journey.\n\nSometimes it is best for a Warrior to realize they have done their best against their emotional reactions and inner demons of the mind, and to go rest and recover. A warrior learns there is a time for that too as they become wise.\n\nSometimes it is best to rest and recover. It will be necessary to take time to rest or you will not win many of the battles in the war for your happiness.\n\nA question from a subscriber to my on line course in Self Mastery,,,\n\nHello Gary,\n\nI started reading The Four Agreements Companion Book yesterday and noticed that it had exercises like your Self Mastery program. The first exercise in the book was dealing with image of perfection but I’m still about ten sessions away from your Image of Perfection session.\n\nI am aware that the sessions in your program are in an order for a purpose, so I wasn’t sure if it would be okay to continue reading the book or not.\n\nShould I… continue reading the book and do the book exercises with your program? or stop reading the book until I finish your program?\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nCurious\n\nHi Curious,\n\nThe Four Agreements Companion book is great and I recommend that you read it. However most people I’ve talked to that have attempted the exercises have gotten overwhelmed. They see so much of their belief system so fast without first having control over their attention that they slip into a victim point of view. That induces a feeling of overwhelm, powerlessness, and then hopelessness. Then their inner judge kicks in and berates them for failing. They lose motivation and close the book,,, stop the exercises… defeated. They end up feeling worse than when they started.\n\nSo that’s one of the reasons why I don’t start with the Image of Perfection beliefs. It’s also why I have people develop some other skills over their attention and beliefs before trying to change their whole belief system. It’s like eating beef. It’s much easier to do one bite at a time so you don’t get crushed by the whole animal.\n\nBy all means read the Four Agreements Companion Book. But, I’d suggest doing the exercises in the Self Mastery before starting the exercises in the book. And if you want to challenge and dissolve your Image of Perfection beliefs, (which is a necessary step to eliminating self judgments) then I suggest the using the steps in the Advanced Series of the Self Mastery program instead of the Four Agreements Companion book approach. In the Advanced Series I not only walk you through changing the Image of Perfection beliefs, but also walk you through the different issues of resistance that come up to letting these go.\n\nAfter that, you’ll be better prepared to do the exercises suggested in the Four Agreements Companion book.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nGary\n\nOriginal post at ToltecSpirit.com a Four Agreements resource for Spiritual Warriors\n\nhttps://www.toltecspirit.com/2009/12/four-agreements-companion-book/\n\nA request for workshops in your local area. Part of why I created the Self Mastery on line study course at www.PathwayToHappiness.com\n\nGary,\n\nI recently purchased the book Beyond Fear. I have found that Don MIguel’s words speak to me on a very deep level. I had no idea that the ancient people of my country had such a rich spiritual tradition of their own. I’m thinking that it would probably have been better to start off reading The Four Agreements first, but I guess I can just make that my next book.\n\nAnyway, I am really interested in working with a spiritual guide, one who can teach me on Toltec Wisdom. I live in Wisconsin, and I notice that most workshops, events, etc are not in my area. Do you have any suggestions on where to start?\n\nAny info would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your time. — Dan\n\nHi Dan,\n\nI don’t think there is a wrong order to reading don Miguel’s material. Just add his other books to your list.\n\nI live in California so I’m not local to your area. However I do travel for events. If people wish to create a workshop or event in their area and invite me to teach and share, then I will do so. Aside from that, no there are not a lot of teachers of his work. He taught a small group of people very intensely, focusing on quality more than quantity. Even then, most of those people don’t teach as they choose to do other things with their life. Some are doctors, lawyers, yoga teachers, graphic artists, or raising their children.\n\nNot having a widespread cadre of teachers has been a problem for a while. One that has improved greatly since I started when it was just don Miguel in a limited number of locations. It is something that I began addressing by putting a lot of material on line. It’s at my other site http://pathwaytohappiness.com/index.htm\n\nWhere to start?\n\nI suggest here – http://pathwaytohappiness.com/insights.htm\n\nThis page has a lot of free audio. They are from my free podcasts. You can also find them on iTunes in the Self Help section. Search under “Happiness through Self Awareness”\n\nThe free audio addresses the lay of the land in terms of beliefs, emotions, will power, perception, assumptions etc that make up our minds. The Self Mastery sessions are the action steps of what to do. You will find entry to that work on this page. http://pathwaytohappiness.com/self_mastery.htm\n\nThis is where the real work is done. These are specific exercises and practices that I have put together based on my years of study with don Miguel, and teaching my own clients. It is a paced on line audio workbook process where you learn many skills to gain control over your attention, raise your awareness, and inventory and change your core beliefs.\n\nFor people who are more focused, or want specific guidance, I also do coaching over the phone. Often this is in support or in addition to the exercises people are doing from my Self Mastery program.\n\nHope that helps. Send me an email if you have any questions.\n\nGary\n\nFor specific exercises for identifying and dissolving fear based beliefs based in the Four Agreements, begin with the free practices in the Self Mastery audio program.\n\nThe original post located atFour Agreements Events and Workshops\n\nToday Sara Macias Vasquez left her body behind and journeyed into the Spirit. We know her as Mother Sarita. She is don Miguel Ruiz’s mother, an amazing healer, and a Spiritual Guide to many. I had the pleasure of her company many times. And every time was an inspiring example of unconditional love, passion, and faith. In her ninety’s she has more passion about life than most people I know. To witness her presence each time was a gift of life. She was 98.\n\nRaised in rural Mexico, she learned ancient Toltec wisdom from her shaman grandfather, and passed this wisdom on to her son, author don Miguel Ruiz (The Four Agreements). In 2007, Mother Sarita was inducted into The San Diego Women’s Hall of Fame for her contributions to healing and teaching, and for her role as an influential mentor. Her message “Si se puede,” (Yes, it¹s possible) was an inspiration to many. Her courageous and loving spirit will be greatly missed.\n\n(Born January 8, 1910; deceased May 22, 2008)\n\nHer Spirit, her teachings, her wisdom, passion, and Faith will live on in her many students, children and grandchildren, including don Miguel, and his sons.\n\nShe lived beautifully, and her dream lives beautifully in many.\n\nThank you\n\nThe Mitote (me-toe-tay) referred to in The Four Agreements by don Miguel Ruiz is a lot like blogs on the internet. People are pouring out the thoughts in their head and filling virtual cyberspace with opinions, ideas, rants, and their personal knowledge. It is an overwhelming volume of words that other people read, form opinions about and then write words about them in their blogs. Then more people read those opinions about opinions and write their opinion.Very seldom do any of these add any real value to one’s life. Even when good writing has a chance to have an impact, the reader isn’t likely to hold their attention and awareness with it long enough to have a real impact. Their undisciplined short attention is overwhelmed against the onslaught of more information and opinions to surf.\n\nIn the same way the mitote in the mind is like those layers of opinions. It is the cacophony of voices that make up the incessant thinking in your mind. The world of your imagination is filled with opinions, information, description, rants, judgments, and victimizations.\n\nIt has developed such a momentum that when you will your self to be still long enough and step back from them, you can’t help but notice them. You will likely be surprised at how loud those voices are. And usually right after that moment of awareness where you detach from the mitote and observe it, you form an opinion, or make a statement about what you observe.\n\nAnd in that moment of forming an opinion or making a descriptive statement about the mitote, you have just lost your attention to the cacophony and contributed another layer.\n\nPower of Prayer to Strengthen Your Connection to Life\n\nGrowing up a in a Catholic family and being highly skeptical I didn’t appreciate prayer much. To say that I rebelled would be more accurate. What I found with prayer is that the power is not in the words. The words are just a mechanism with which we can direct our attention and intent.\n\nPrayer can be a powerful force. It is so because we put our intent behind it. We focus our attention, our emotion, and our personal intent in the direction of our desire. Our prayers are also in the direction of Love. This aligns us with the natural intent of Life and furthers the strength of our Word. Miguel Ruiz was generous to provide us with an intent for our lives that helped guide us to our integrity and love. He took that expression of Life and put it into words as cleanly as he possibly could. He called it the Circle of Fire prayer. The depth of meaning and way of life that it has guided me to has been revealed over years.\n\nToday, is the day of the Lord, when the Divinity returns to us.\n\nWhen living our Free Will, and with all the Power of our Spirit,\n\nWe decide to live our lives in free Communion with God,\n\nWith no Expectations.\n\nWe will live our lives with Gratitude, Love, Loyalty and Justice,\n\nBeginning with Ourselves,\n\nAnd continuing with our Brothers and Sisters.\n\nWe will respect all Creations as the Symbol or our Love communion\n\nWith the One who Created us.\n\nTo the Eternal Happiness of Humanity.\n\nfrom Prayers, a book by don Miguel Ruiz"
