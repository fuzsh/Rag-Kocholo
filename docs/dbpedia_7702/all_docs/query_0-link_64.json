        "text": "Hi beautiful ladies and dashing men!\n\nWelcome back to Ib‚Äôs blog!\n\nI know most of you have written in your goals for 2024 that you want to read more. You want to become a book baddie but this is new to you and you don‚Äôt really know where to begin. I‚Äôm here!!\n\nI‚Äôm recommending books that I think are great for beginning your reading journey this year. Some of these, I have recommended before. Some, I haven‚Äôt but these are all great reads so I really hope you like them.\n\nüìñ The Midnight Library by Matt Haig\n\nGenre: Science/Philosophy/fantasy fiction\n\nHands down, one of the best novels I‚Äôve ever read in my life. I‚Äôd recommend everyone to read it. It teaches the power of being present and appreciating your ‚Äònow‚Äô because you don‚Äôt need to be anywhere else.\n\nüìñ It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover\n\nGenre: Contemporary romance, fiction\n\nThis book taught me to judge others less. ‚ÄúIf I were in their shoes, I would‚Äôve handled it better‚Äù ‚Äúwhy would anyone do that?‚Äù. This book really made me realize that life is not black or white and people are not just good or bad.\n\nüìñ The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz\n\nGenre: self help, personal development\n\nI have brought up this book several times on this blog but it‚Äôs really a must-read. He talks a lot about life. Four agreements that we can make with ourselves in order to live our highest and joyful lives.\n\nüìñ When We Were Fireflies by Abubakar Adam Ibrahim\n\nGenre: magical realism, historical/literary fiction, romance\n\nThis is my latest read and I wish I could sip my memory of it just to read it again. The book is so beautiful written. The characters are captivating and they have so much depth especially the main character. The romance was so beautiful woven into the storyline.\n\nüìñ Good Vibes, Good Life by Vex King\n\nGenre: Self-help\n\nI read this book at the beginning of 2023 and I‚Äôd say it is probably one of the reasons, last year was one of the best years of my life. It really shaped my mentality. I plan to reread it again soon.\n\nüìñ Atomic Habits by James Clear\n\nGenre: Self- help\n\nI can never shut up about this book! The author gives practical steps that you can take each day to getting 1% better everyday; whether it‚Äôs the habits you want to build, goals you want to achieve or just having a productive life in general. This book is really great.\n\nIf these are the only books you read this year, I promise you would‚Äôve learnt a great deal. Let me know if you‚Äôd want me to do a part two of this post!\n\nThank you so much for reading today‚Äôs post! Make sure to like the post if you enjoyed it and I would love to read your thoughts so I‚Äôd appreciate if you leave a comment."
