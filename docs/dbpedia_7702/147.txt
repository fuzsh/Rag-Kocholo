The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom by Don Miguel Ruiz, with Janet Mills. A Toltec Wisdom Book published by Amber Allen Publishing, 1997 (978-1-878424-31-0).

Few books in the personal growth/self-help genre have had as profound impact as this little book. First published in 1997, The Four Agreements has sold over 15 million copies, translated into over 50 languages, and has been on the New York Times Bestselling list for over a decade.

Ruiz teaches us that everything we do is based on agreements we have made, whether with ourselves, with other people, with God, with life, or, most importantly, with ourselves. These agreements shape how we see ourselves, our opportunities, how we should behave, and what we should feel. Unfortunately, these beliefs tend to limit our potential, experiences, and joy.

So, if these agreements are so antithetical to the "good life" why not make new agreements, and Ruiz suggests these four.
