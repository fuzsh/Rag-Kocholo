        "text": "A Letter from Angela\n\nOn a beautiful November Sunday morning, my husband, our two daughters, and I put on our fanciest clothes. We stepped outside our Orcas Island home to snap a few family self-portraits. Then we went back inside to gather around a computer so we could “Zoom in” to my mother- in-law’s wedding in Pennsylvania, 2,000 miles away.\n\nOur 10-year-old daughter was appointed the virtual flower girl. As the ceremony unfolded, there wasn’t a dry eye on the Zoom screen. In spite of the physical distance separating those who took part in the wedding, we were all brought close in a deeply meaningful way.\n\nFor the Preservation Trust, the past 10 months have been something like that. The COVID-19 pandemic has had deep impacts on how we’ve been able to carry out our conservation mission—not least of all by keeping our staff and board members physically distant from each other and from you, who make our work together possible.\n\nDespite feelings of deep sadness due to the pandemic, I have found joy through maintaining and strengthening connections with family, friends, colleagues, and the natural world—often in ways I could never have imagined before last March. For example:\n\nWe pivoted from in-person guided outings to our “Just a Minute” video series, designed to connect people with nature in their own backyards.\n\nWe held our annual meeting as a virtual event, which enabled a record number of members to participate.\n\nOur planned field trip to False Bay after the annual meeting, which would have been led by our featured speaker, Dr. Drew Harvell, was transformed into a video tour of False Bay at low tide. The video, “Through Her Eyes,” filmed by SJPT volunteer Michael Noonan, won an Audience Choice Award in the Friday Harbor Film Festival!\n\nCompensating for many cancelled stewardship work parties, a record number of volunteers have signed up to serve as Preserve Stewards, who work on their own to help care for SJPT-protected lands.\n\nI’m thankful for you all, who have done so much to make this challenging year not just a productive one, but in some ways a record-setting year for the Preservation Trust. How? Let us show you—and thank you—in the following pages, in which we report on how you have enabled us to advance each of the three C’s of our mission: Conserve, Care, and Connect.\n\nWith deep gratitude,\n\nAngela Anderson, Executive Director\n\nGOODFELLOW GIFTS\n\nWhen the Preservation Trust and its supporters look back on 2020, it may not be the pandemic we think of first. Instead, we’ll remember it as the Year of the Good Fellow, as in Malcolm Goodfellow. This year Malcolm (a former SJPT board member) made the two largest individual gifts the Preservation Trust has ever received.\n\nIn July he made a $5.2 million gift that resulted in two transactions: a 36-acre addition to the Turtleback Mountain Preserve that included 2,000 feet of shoreline, and a return of six acres and nearly half a mile of shoreline to the Lummi Nation.\n\nAs if that weren’t enough, in November Malcolm donated an additional $4 million so the Preservation Trust could purchase Reef Island. A prominent part of the Wasp Island group, 17-acre Reef Island lies just outside Deer Harbor. It is home to a rare Douglas fir/seaside juniper/Garry oak forest, bounded by just under a mile of rocky shoreline and pocket beaches. To protect these conservation values, Reef will remain private and not accessible to the general public.\n\nWe are forever grateful to Malcolm for his unsurpassed contributions not just to land acquisition, but also to the ongoing stewardship of protected land—which, as he says, “will only become more burdensome and lasts forever.”\n\nJESTER PRESERVE\n\nWith any large-scale conservation project, there are always a few key individuals without whom the initial vision would never make it off the drawing board. Bob and Pat Jester were those key people for the Entrance Mountain area, between Rosario and Olga on Orcas Island. Their role began in 1987 when, working with James and Betty Jane Dahl, they were part of a group of neighbors who decided to protect the slopes of Entrance Mountain on Orcas Island.\n\nOver the next eight years, many other families joined this neighborhood conservation effort, resulting in a 230-acre protected area. In the 1990s, the San Juan County Land Bank acquired 130 acres, thereby protecting the mountain’s north and south peaks.\n\nSome conservation-minded landowners might have left it at that—but the Jesters weren’t done yet. In 2007 they acquired a 31-acre parcel that connects Moran State Park with the protected land on Entrance Mountain. They placed a forever- wild easement on that parcel. Then, this year they donated the property to the Preservation Trust.\n\nNow, a total of 400 acres of the cliffs and forests that tower majestically over the entrance to East Sound are connected with Moran State Park and will remain in their natural state forever. Thank you for your vision and generosity, Bob and Pat!\n\nCONSERVATION EASEMENTS\n\nIn 2020 we added 84 acres and almost two miles of shoreline to our network of island land protected by conservation easements, bringing the total number of easements we hold to 244. All together, they protect nearly 16,000 acres.\n\nOne of our 2020 additions is the Mud Bay Tree Farm easement. Acquired with funds from the Washington Salmon Recovery Funding Board in partnership with Friends of the San Juans, this easement protects 27 acres of upland forest and 805 feet of marine shoreline along Lopez Island’s Mud Bay. (You can see a video about how this project supports salmon recovery by clicking the photo on the left.)\n\nOrcas resident Charlie Carver donated a conservation easement on his land near the slopes of Mount Woollard. The time had come for him to sell, and he wanted to ensure his beloved land would remain largely undeveloped even after his period as owner/steward. The easement will preserve most of the property in forever-wild status and guarantee the 15-acre parcel will never be subdivided.\n\nSTEWARDSHIP DURING A PANDEMIC\n\nThe Preservation Trust promises to care for the lands under our protection in perpetuity. In normal years there are normal challenges—weeds grow, conservation easements must be monitored, issues with neighbors sometimes need to be resolved. But of course this was not a normal year. Many of our activities ground to a halt in March, when Governor Jay Inslee issued Washington’s “Stay home, Stay healthy” order. The Preservation Trust’s offices closed, so all staff—including your normally roving stewardship team—did our best to carry on under an evolving set of COVID-imposed restrictions.\n\nSome restoration projects were delayed when our partner, the Washington Conservation Corps (WCC), was unable to send crews to the islands. They were, however, able to resume work in July under COVID-19 protocols.\n\nMost of our spring and summer volunteer work parties had to be cancelled. By late summer and fall, we were able to host a few small groups to help with seasonally essential projects. Thanks to our expanding cadre of volunteer Preserve Stewards, we maintained our ability to keep a close eye on SJPT-owned lands.\n\nDespite unprecedented challenges, we have accomplished the core of our stewardship work. Every one of our 244 easements and 69 preserves will be monitored by year’s end. With the help of volunteers and landowners, we continued to support the Western Bluebirds of San Juan Island as they regain a tenuous toehold in their historic northern breeding grounds. And, at the Marilyn and Fred Ellis Preserve on Shaw Island, volunteers aided in completing a 1.7-mile “Sylvan Loop Trail,” which will open to the public on a limited basis by year’s end.
