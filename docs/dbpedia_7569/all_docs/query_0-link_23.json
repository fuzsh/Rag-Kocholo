        "text": "ABOUT THE PLAY\n\nThomas “Tommy Long” survives in the gay porn industry with one simple rule: know your role. For him, that is the submissive Asian geisha. When James, a new ripped Asian actor, joins the company, Thomas begins to question if he can be something more. Can he upend the prejudices of the porn industry? And at what cost? Blending comedy and Kabuki, pornography and Peking Opera, Long explores the legacies of colonialism, racism, misogyny, and homophobia within Asian American communities.\n\nREAD THE PROGRAM (PDF)\n\nABOUT THE WRITER\n\nCharlie Oh is a playwright/lyricist/actor.

This is a time-traveling tale about how objects and ideas go out of style, commissioned by MTC through the Alfred P.
