        "text": "“you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” ~ steve jobs\n\n~~~~~\n\nprelude / Recently a close friend asked to see my curriculum vitae. I hadn’t actually had one that attempted to synthesize the dozens of directions that I had seemed to go in since I was 21; but I thought it would be a good idea to have one at hand when I met with Apple University early last year. I asked to see a variety of friends and mentors’ resumes and CVs and created one that I thought made sense of all the complicated pathways that my “career” took since starting at the College of the Holy Cross when I was 17 years old as an economics major, wanting to be an investment banker. If anyone had ever asked me then, or, when I was working in the art world in my 20s, or deciding to go to grad school at SOAS in London then at UC Berkeley, or when I got interested in film and then film festivals, or when I graduated in 2000 and became a clothesmaker, or when I began cooking and then hosting salons, closed my studio, began doing moveable feasts, or when I re-entered the art world as an installation artist, or when I decided to jump onto a feature film to do costumes and produce it ~ to try to figure out how to make sense of it all ~ I wouldn’t have had the clarity then, that time, perspective and distance gives you on the choices and decisions you make…. So this is what I came up with a year ago… and now, looking at it today ~ it finally makes perfect sense. It has defined, in retrospect, how I see myself. But I also can see that my desire to understand all the angles and nuances and complexities of the worlds we inhabit, stem from my early attempts to comprehend my own place in the world ~ as an only child brought up by a single mother. And this reflecting back points me, in the most focused and determined way ever (finally) ~ to be clear on how to enter into the future ~ not just myself, but also in teaching both my son and daughter to look at things from many points of view ~ to truly apprehend the grey areas, the subtleties of gestures and words and actions. Below is not only a summation of past interests distilled into a paragraph but a philosophy on a way of being ~ one that I am grateful to my professors at CAL for instilling in me, without my knowing it ~ especially Dr Nelson Graburn, Dr Paul Rabinow, Dr Michel Laguerre, Dr Stefania Pandolfo, Trinh T. Minh-ha, B. Ruby Rich and my dearest of friends ~ Dr. Laura Nader. But of course it was the diversity of thinkers I was influenced by (in anthropology, sociology, film theory, film production, rhetoric) and that continual balance of theory and practice ~ the repetition, the obsession ~ with the details and their affect on the whole, that is the motivating force to “imagine a world, create it and then live in it” ~ words told to me by the theater director Peter Sellars, right before the premiere of his Desdemona at Zellerbach in 2011…\n\n*****\n\n~~~~~\n\n#50 / co-hosted with Lisa Parks / September 26th 2014 ~ with guests ted sherman, edward frenkel, erik moore, doug & freya washington, love weinstock & anthony, eddie orton, arild fetveit, johanna Rickne, olle Folke\n\nsarah & andrew rosenbach, cherilyn parsons, joey xanders, anne schukat, tim felkner & cherish mcclure, narda & andy skov\n\n“I live for coincidences.\n\nThey briefly give to me the illusion or the hope that there’s a pattern to my life,\n\nand if there’s a pattern,\n\nthen maybe I’m moving toward some kind of destiny where it’s all explained.”\n\n~ jonathan ames, my less than secret life\n\n“The interaction between math and physics is a two-way process, with each of the two subjects drawing from and inspiring the other. At different times, one of them may take the lead in developing a particular idea, only to yield to the other subject as focus shifts. But altogether, the two interact in a virtuous circle of mutual influence.” ~ edward frenkel, love and math: the heart of hidden reality\n\n~~~~~\n\n#49 / September 13th 2014 ~ with guests eve love, donato cabrera, erik tarloff & laura tyson, melissa & sam davis, greta caruso, hannah johnson, kathy seligman, gretchen kell, eileen hammer, jen pahlka & tim o’reilly, clementine, phillip & emily mehas, corey weinstein\n\nrichard hylton & sara o’malley, bruce rinehart & rachel brahinsky, wadie said & jennifer zacharia, amy finn, and royal.\n\n“At last she was going to know the joys of love, the fever of the happiness she had despaired of. She was entering a marvelous realm where all would be passion, ecstasy, rapture: she was in the midst of an endless blue expanse, scaling the glittering heights of passion; everyday life had receded, and lay far below, in the shadows between those peaks.” ~ Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary\n\n~~~~\n\n#48 / August 9th 2014 ~ with guests alison davis + matthew le merle, charlotte eyerman, denise thomas, sophie kitson, jake wall, deanna griffin, debbie chinn, duana fulwiley, mac barnett + taylor norman, ted boerner, tamara strauss + john haymaker, sonya + isaac, maxi lilley + eric faurot, rachel rosen, perry shimon, jamie + larry westdal.\n\n“our candle burns at both ends, it will not last the night,\n\nbut ah my foes and oh my friends, it gives a lovely light.” – edna vincent millay\n\n“We know these characters aren’t real, but we have real feelings about them, and we’re able to do that.
