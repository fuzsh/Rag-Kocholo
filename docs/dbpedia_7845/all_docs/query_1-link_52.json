This will give faculty and staff without essential duties the entire week off. The well-being days are Nov. 25 through Nov. 27.\n\nThese days are designed to provide individual employees time to unplug from work and recharge. Taking time off is crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life integration and we are happy to provide this opportunity to our employees."
