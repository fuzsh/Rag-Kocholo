        "meta_description": "Most scientists would consider a Nobel Prize the crowning achievement of a life's work; Dr. Frederick Sanger has won this honor not once, but twice. He received his first Nobel in 1958 for successfully determining the exact sequence of the 51 amino acids that make up a molecule of insulin. The method he pioneered can be used for the analysis of all proteins, and made the synthesis of insulin possible for the first time, with far-reaching effects for the treatment of diabetes.  Sanger then set out to do for DNA what he had done for proteins. Methods he devised have enabled scientists to determine the sequence of hundreds of base compounds in a single day, work that had previously taken years to accomplish. Dr. Sanger demonstrated his method by performing the first complete analysis of an entire organism, a microscopic bacteriophage. In 1980, Dr. Sanger received a second Nobel for this work, which lies at the heart of contemporary genetic research, such as the Human Genome Project.  Only four people in history have won two Nobel Prizes. Two were past honorees of the Academy of Achievement, John Bardeen and Linus Pauling. The others were Marie Curie and Dr. Frederick Sanger, who was the last living member of this illustrious company.",

        "text": "You grew up in a village in Gloucestershire.\n\nFrederick Sanger: That’s right. That’s where I was born, yes.\n\nTell me what it was like growing up there at that time.\n\nFrederick Sanger: Well, I left it when I was five years old, so I don’t remember very much there. My father was a doctor, a medical practitioner, and I vaguely remember him. He was interested in science. In fact, he had, earlier on, done an M.D. in Cambridge on science, actually on immunology, very early immunology, and he’d been involved in identifying blood spots, whether they were human or whether they were animal, which is very early immunology, before immunology was really started, and he had done — got an M.D. for it. He was a medical doctor. But he didn’t continue with it. He actually went to China as a missionary. He was a very religious man, really. I think he had the call, as they say. And he stayed in China for a while, and I think he developed TB or something, but he had to come back for his health reason, and he set up as a local doctor in Rendcomb, with his mother, I think, and then he met my mother and they got married there and I was born, and really, my main companion was my older brother, Theo. He was just a year older than me, so we spent a lot of time together, and I think he was a great influence on me. He was very interested in nature and animals and birds’ nests and that sort of thing, and he was sort an extrovert. I’m an introvert, you know, I’m a quiet sort of fellow, and I used to play around with him, and I think that’s where I first developed my interest, really, in science. So, both my father and my brother were fairly important influences.\n\nIn what ways did they influence you?\n\nFrederick Sanger: My brother, we used to play together a lot, and he would show me where the birds’ nests were, and he used to catch lizards, and he was rather good at catching snakes, actually. I remember one occasion when we were just playing in a haystack, and there was a snake there, and you know, I was scared stiff, and he grabbed hold of the thing and, you know, showed me how you had to handle it, and he kept several as pets.\n\nBut we didn’t stay in Rendcomb very long. We moved to another small village near Birmingham which was — I don’t know quite why we moved, because where we lived was very beautiful sort of country, and we were up near Birmingham, the big city, where my father and mother moved, and I grew up largely — the place I remember best is this place in Shakespeare country, really. I grew up there.\n\nMy father was — both my parents were fairly religious. My father joined the Quakers, and that was a great influence in his life, and he only joined it, really — well, I suppose about when we were at Rendcomb. He wasn’t a Quaker when he was in China. So, I was brought up as more or less a Quaker. I never actually joined the Quakers, and you know, when I got to college and so forth, I became a bit doubtful.\n\nSo, I didn’t actually become a Quaker, but I think I was influenced by their teaching, and particularly, they taught a great deal to truth, and I think this is something that has helped me a lot in my work, because in science, that’s what you’re looking for. You’re looking for truth, and you’ve got to be absolutely sure that you remember this, and I think that there are some people, you know, who get a theory and put more importance on their theory and trying to prove it than on actually deciding whether it is really true. The other thing, of course, being a Quaker was that they were pacifists. They wouldn’t fight. They wouldn’t take life. And I was, of course, ready for national service at the time of the war.\n\nWorld War II?\n\nFrederick Sanger: Yes, World War II. I became a conscientious objector and I was exempted from it, so that I was able to carry on my career and to get into the scientific and research environment, and that, of course, was a great help to me. I would have been exempted from fighting, being a scientific student, but it didn’t mean that I was free to start doing scientific work.\n\nOriginally, when I was still at school, I was expected to become a doctor. I think I was fairly bright, and I think I would have been all right at that, but you know, when it came to the crunch and I had to decide whether to — what to study, really, I came to university, and I decided that I didn’t really want to be a doctor. I’d seen my father’s life. It all seemed rather an empirical business that you went to one patient and gave them some pills and then you have to get done with that one and go to another one, but I felt I would like to do something which was more — something I could get involved in and was more — in more depth, really, than in medicine. So, I decided to study science rather than study medicine.\n\nWhen did you make that decision?\n\nFrederick Sanger: I think during my last term at school, really. My last term at school, I didn’t have a lot to do, really. I got my entrance to Cambridge, to the university, and I didn’t have any special courses that I had to do, so I was rather free to choose, and I had a chemistry master in school — this was Brownsmith School in Dorset — and he let me come to the labs and do some chemistry, sort of semi-research. He let me play about in the lab and help him, and I found this absolutely fascinating. You could play about in a lab with these things and get these beautiful crystals, and this really got me rather hooked on chemistry, and you know, I spent much more time than I should have on this instead of, you know, getting on with my physics and chemistry which I would have to study. When I came to Cambridge, I took various subjects, and I was very excited to find that there was a new subject called biochemistry. There really hadn’t been such a subject before, and it seemed to me that it would be very exciting if you could really understand living matter in terms of chemistry and exact science, and then you really might be able to improve medical practice, a more scientific approach, and I think that has probably been a real influence on me.\n\nAnyhow, I did fairly well at biochemistry in Cambridge, I think partly because it was a new subject and people hadn’t done it at all at school, whereas physics and chemistry, I didn’t do so well at, and I was a bit lucky in this way, because I did three years in Cambridge, and that is the normal amount, you see, but I wanted to do the advanced biochemistry, and I did that in the fourth year, and I was lucky in the sense that my parents were fairly rich, had enough money, actually, to support me in doing university and during this extra year. So, in that way, I was lucky. I think if it hadn’t been for that, I wouldn’t ever have been able to become a biochemistry. But anyhow, I did, and I got a first-class degree in biochemistry.\n\nSo, then I had the opportunity to do research, and this was really during the war. This was in 1940, so that things were a bit involved in the war effort, but I managed to get a job in the biochemistry lab in Cambridge, and again, I didn’t get any money for it. I was able, at this stage, to support myself and do a Ph.D. and get a doctor’s degree.\n\nGrowing up, as a young man, were you a good student?\n\nFrederick Sanger: Yes, I think was, rather. I worked hard. But I don’t think I was brilliant. I went to this school, Brownstone, which was rather a modern school and had a different teaching system, a system where you could work hard or you couldn’t work hard. You did what they called assignments, which I think were like work to do, and you go there and do it, and I was very conscientious about this, and I did work hard. Most people, I think, didn’t work too hard. They just did what they had to do.\n\nWe’ve read that you described yourself as an above-average scholar but not an outstanding scholar.\n\nFrederick Sanger: I think so, yes. I wasn’t one of these people who actually come top of the class every time, and I was just okay, I believe. But certainly in the last years of school, I worked very hard.\n\nHow did you first get attracted to chemistry?\n\nFrederick Sanger: Well, I was telling you about this work I did at the last term at school with my chemistry master, and I think that’s what got me into chemistry, as such, and I found that, you know, it was a subject I could relate to and get interested. Physics became far too mathematical for me, and I couldn’t really cope with that at all. I couldn’t relate the physical properties to the mathematical formulas. But with chemistry, it was relatively easy, and of course, once you start working on it and studying it for a time, then you really do get to know about it.\n\nI always preferred the practical work, the work at the bench. When I was young, I used to do a lot of carpentry, using my hands. I actually had a forge at one stage and did a bit of iron work. My parents were really generous to me and let me do this sort of thing, and that’s the sort of thing I like doing. During my working life, I’ve always enjoyed doing experiments myself and seeing the results of my own work, which I think has been important to me. There are some scientists who, you know, never use their hands, just think and write. Obviously, some sciences should be done like that, but biochemistry, I think, in my hands, anyhow, and in most people’s hands at the early stage, was essentially an experimental science. There wasn’t much theory about it. It was just finding out how to do things.\n\nAs you were growing up, were there books that were important to you?\n\nFrederick Sanger: Not really, no, I don’t think so. I had the standard textbooks, but I never enjoyed reading that much, unless it was right on something I was doing. I’d much rather work in the lab, and I obviously had to write up my results, but I’ve never written a book, and I enjoy novels and things, but I don’t read much. I read very much less than these people. It takes me about a year to read a novel.\n\nWho most inspired or influenced you as a young man when you were growing up? Were there any teachers who were important to you?\n\nFrederick Sanger: Well, there was Mr. Ordish, who was this chemistry master who I talked to you about, and he was also my house master, and we had quite a close relationship. I remember once — he was sort of the detective of the school. He was a rather eccentric person. He wasn’t like a school master at all, really. He was a quiet sort of brainy chap, slightly eccentric, but being a chemist, he was the detective, and he and I did a little detective work together, and it’s a bit unfortunate, really, there was somebody who was picking pockets in the changing room, and this chap was going around taking coins out of people’s pockets, and Mr. Ordish gave me some coins that were — had some dye on them, sticky dye on them, and I put them in one of my pair of trousers hanging in there, and I had to look at them and see if they’d gone, and one day they had gone. So, there was a great hoo-ha, and everybody had to come along and show their hands, and while we were waiting to sort of show our hands, I noticed that a good friend of mine had a lot of green stuff on his fingers, and unfortunately, I never saw him again, but he was quite an honest chap, too. So, this chap did really, I think, do quite a lot for me, but he left the school very soon after, and I haven’t heard from him again.\n\nWhat is important about research? What philosophy do you need to be a successful researcher?\n\nFrederick Sanger: In my case, I think one of the important things was not to get too discouraged, really. You know, you’re doing new things which haven’t been done before, and very often, more often than not, I think, they don’t come to anything. They’re not failures, you try something and it doesn’t work, and some people, you know, get fed up with this, and I’ve known some of my friends and colleagues who have just decided to give up science because they can’t stand it, but I’ve always decided, you know, if it doesn’t work, forget it and start planning the next experiment, and that’s always exciting. And you know, you can have fun with that, and I think a certain amount of persistence is necessary there, that you’ve really got to keep trying and keep enjoying it, and I think, if you don’t enjoy it, I think it doesn’t often succeed much, but to actually enjoy the work is, I think, an important factor, and it’s always been great fun for me to do, even in the bad times. And the other thing, I think, is you’ve got to be sure that truth is the number one thing that you’re looking for and don’t get into some theory which you can’t prove.\n\nWhat was it like to be awarded a second Nobel Prize? There are only four of you who have ever won two Nobel Prizes. There you were with Madam Curie and Linus Pauling.\n\nFrederick Sanger: I’m very proud of it, and like anybody, I think I’m a bit conceited, but I think it’s very rewarding. But you know, I’ve been lucky, I admit that, and I owe a lot to other people who have worked with me, other people who just talked to me, and I think, in both the labs I’ve worked in, it has been a very open sort of society, and we’ve all talked to one another and shared our experiences, and I think this has been extremely important, and I can’t claim that, you know, I am the only person who has ever made any discoveries. You know, all the things I’ve developed have usually depended on the work that’s gone before. So, it’s very exciting to win a Nobel Prize, but it isn’t the only thing.\n\nIn that sense, science is not simply being alone in your lab. It’s also very collaborative.\n\nFrederick Sanger: Sometimes people don’t talk to their colleagues in the lab and are rather competitive, and of course, in, you know, the more applied research, when they have a way of making money out of it, they have to be a bit secretive. But I think in fundamental research, when you’re studying basic problems which may or may not prove of value to humanity, then you’ve got to be open about it and share, and of course, it goes much faster if you can — you know somebody else knows something you don’t know and can pass it on to you and you forget that he’s passed it on to you and you think you know it. A lot of my ideas have come from other people.\n\nWhat advice would you have for a young person who came to you and said he or she wanted to do the kind of work that you do? What would you tell them?\n\nFrederick Sanger: Get on with it. But make sure you do want to do it. I think that’s the important thing, to be something that you would enjoy. If you only just go into science to get rich or to win gold medals, then I wouldn’t bother, but if you really want to enjoy yourself in the lab, then do it. But you never know, really. Things are sometimes difficult. Some people, very bright people, come up with an idea without any work at all, but you’ve got to judge what you can do before starting out on your work, and I think it’s very important for young people when they’re just thinking about what they’re going to do to think very hard whether they should go into science or whether they would be better employed just getting money, which is what a lot of people aim at.\n\nBeyond science, beyond your field, what do you see as the greatest challenge that we all face as a society in the years ahead?\n\nFrederick Sanger: When I was a little boy and people asked me what I would do when I was prime minister, I told them I would make a law saying there shouldn’t be any more wars, and that’s about how I still feel. I don’t think I’ve progressed much beyond that, but I still feel that we shan’t really be safe and happy until we get a — give up this idea of a lot of separate countries working their own thing and there’s only one country that matters and the rest can go, and I think we’ve got to have some law which can be enforced internationally.\n\nLooking back on your life, on your career, is there anything you wish you could go back and do differently or do over again?\n\nFrederick Sanger: No, I don’t think so. I’ve been very happy, in fact. I’ve had a very good life. I owe a lot, I think, to my wife, who has kept me happy, and I haven’t ever had any sort of problems. I think a lot of people, if they have problems, family problems or something, they get very depressed and they can’t really concentrate on their work, and I think it has been very important to me to be able to go home and your brain goes on thinking about the experiments.\n\nTo be a successful researcher and scientist, do you have to be that single-minded? Is that what you have to be thinking about all the time? Is there not room for anything else in your life?\n\nFrederick Sanger: I think it depends how clever you are, probably. I think there is room for other things. I have always taken holidays and had recreation. I seem to have more recreation than I do now, really. When I retired, I thought of all sorts of things I ought to do or to be able to do which I hadn’t been able to do, but in fact, I haven’t done as much as I did when I was younger, but we used to do a lot of boating and water-skiing, and I had a sailing boat at one stage. I’ve lived a reasonable life. When you are working, then you are working."
