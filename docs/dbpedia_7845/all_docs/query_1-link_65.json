Some of the most common brain conditions include Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease, all of which are devastating and incurable. Prion disorders are rare and transmissible but belong to the same class of neurodegenerative diseases. The common feature of these and many other diseases is the deposition of misfolded proteins in brain neurons proposed to be responsible for neuronal cell death. The proteins responsible for each disease (Amyloid-beta in AD, alpha-Synuclein in PD, Huntingtin in HD and the Prion protein in PrD) are quite different in sequence, function and cellular localization. However, they are all structurally unstable and prone to misfold, thus exposing hydrophobic pockets that make the proteins aggregate. Upon autopsy, these proteins accumulate in large, fibrillar aggregates that were originally thought to be responsible for neurodegeneration. However, the focus has recently turned to smaller, soluble aggregates (oligomers) that are highly toxic and seem capable of disrupting synaptic function. This knowledge, though, has not resulted in significant insight into the causes of neuronal cell death nor has produced effective therapies.\n\nI am using the flexibility and genetic prowess of Drosophila to gain knowledge on some of the most intractable questions posed by this group of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent work includes the identification of engineered antibodies and chaperones that bind amyloid-beta and efficiently suppress its toxicity. I also generated a robust phenotypic Drosophila model expressing the prion protein in the eye that I will use to conduct genetic screens to identify genetic modifiers of PrP neurotoxicity. I am also interested in uncovering the pathogenic mechanisms mediating the toxicity of several genes implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nTeaching Summary\n\n• Brain pathologies and genetics of brain disorders\n\n• Course Director: NeuroMedicine\n\n• Facilitator: Problem based learning (PBL) in NMED, IHO, CRAAB I and II\n\nMentoring/Advising: undergraduates, post-doctoral fellows.\n\nDirector of the Biomedical Sciences (BMS) MS Program: Gateways to Medicine and Research\n\nEducation\n\nPhD, Summa cum laude, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain)\n\nMajor: Developmental Biology and Genetics\n\nBS, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain)\n\nMajor: Biology\n\nFellowships, Residencies, and Visiting Engagements\n\nPostdoctoral Appointment, Other\n\nBaylor College of Medicine\n\nHonors and Recognition\n\nExemplary Teacher Award, University of Florida College of Medicine\n\n2012\n\nExcellence Award in Research for Assistant Professors, University of Florida\n\n2011\n\nFaculty of the Month, University of Texas Medical Branch Research Services\n\n2007\n\nNIH Director New Innovator Award, National Institutes of Health\n\n2007\n\nProfessional Memberships\n\nFaculty, Integrated Biosciences Graduate Program\n\nFaculty, Institute for Translational Neuroscience\n\nGrant Reviewer, Department of Defense (DoD)\n\nGrant Reviewer, National Science Foundation (NSF)\n\nGrant Reviewer, Medical Research Council (UK)\n\nGrant Reviewer, National Ataxia Foundation\n\nGrant Reviewer, NIH, Neuroscience & Genetics\n\nMember, Institutional Biosafety Committee\n\nAcademic Editor, PlosOne\n\nSelected Presentations\n\nSelected Presentations\n\nFernandez-Funez, P. \"Uncovering pathogenic gene networks in Drosophila\", Fly Meeting, UMN Medical School, Duluth, Minnesota, January 01, 2018.\n\nFernandez-Funez, P. \"Understanding and treating neurological diseases in Drosophila\", UMN Medical School Community Advisory Board, Duluth, Minnesota, November 01, 2017.\n\nFernandez-Funez, P. \"Platform presentation\", 6th Iberian Congress on Prions, Cordoba, Spain.
