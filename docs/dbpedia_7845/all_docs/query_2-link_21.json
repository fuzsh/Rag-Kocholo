The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which probably originated with wildlife, has been documented in 26 animal species other than humans in 36 countries as of Oct. 31, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health, including tigers, lions, and gorillas in zoos; mink on farms; and white-tailed deer in the wild.\n\nAlthough animals do not appear to play a significant role in the spread of the virus among people currently, the pandemic has highlighted the one-health concept that the health of humans, animals, and the environment is interconnected. Uniquely situated at the interface of those three areas are wildlife veterinarians, whose field has grown and evolved over the decades.\n\nAVMA News spoke with a few wildlife veterinarians to get a better idea of how they got into their roles, the skills they need, and the important work they do, whether it’s animal surveillance or habitat management.\n\nField work\n\nDr. Ole Alcumbrac is frequently away from his mixed animal practice in Arizona from October through March providing training in wildlife capture, particularly of Sonoran pronghorns and Mexican gray wolves—both of which are endangered subspecies. Most of the work is done in the wintertime because of heat-related issues in the summer.\n\nDr. Alcumbrac, star of the television shows “Wild Ops” on the Outdoor Channel and “The Wild Life of Dr. Ole” on National Geographic, served as Arizona’s first state wildlife veterinarian before he realized he wasn’t built for government work. Now he owns his mixed animal practice and contracts for a variety of hands-on wildlife work.\n\nOn the flip side, Dr. Anne Justice-Allen, Arizona’s current state wildlife veterinarian, started out in mixed animal practice but got interested in disaster management and then management of disease in wildlife. In her current position, she is mostly responsible for monitoring the health of wildlife populations in the state, including Sonoran pronghorns and Mexican grey wolves.\n\nDr. Justice-Allen also is president of the American Association of Wildlife Veterinarians, a small group established in 1979. The AAWV members are mostly veterinarians working in government wildlife management agencies, but many members work for zoos and aquaria, academic institutions, wildlife rehabilitation facilities, and even private practices.\n\n“People shift around,” Dr. Justice-Allen said. “You change jobs, and your duties change a little bit, but you still remain a part of the association, and it’s because we all have a passion for free-ranging wildlife and working with wildlife and maintaining a healthy relationship with wildlife as far as ecosystem health and minimizing human impact on wildlife populations.”\n\nNational, international work on wildlife health\n\nDr. Jonathan Sleeman, center director of the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center, said the NWHC has a new strategic plan that emphasizes a one-health approach.\n\nThe center is looking at taking a systems approach to certain challenging wildlife diseases. For example, habitat management potentially could improve the health of wildlife populations overall to increase their resilience to diseases.\n\nThe center received $5 million through the American Rescue Plan Act, one of the federal laws in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to continue developing the Wildlife Health Information Sharing Partnership. The online system serves as a central repository of information on wildlife health.\n\nThe NWHC also is exploring how to apply new technology such as artificial intelligence to wildlife health data. Dr. Sleeman said much of the data is messy and nonstandardized. He said the hope is to provide early alerts and devise new solutions.\n\nAnother initiative is international engagement. The center is collaborating with the World Organisation for Animal Health to improve international information sharing on wildlife health, has made information cards on wildlife diseases for other countries, and helps other countries build capacity in wildlife health programs.\n\nJust recently, the WOAH, along with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations’ Environment Programme, and the World Health Organization, launched the One Health Joint Plan of Action, to improve the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment while contributing to sustainable development.\n\nThe versatility of the wildlife veterinarian\n\nDr. Patrice Klein is a wildlife veterinarian based out of Washington, D.C., with the U.S. Forest Service. A multifaceted career led to her current position.\n\n“Wildlife veterinarians by necessity have to be very versatile. They have to have a broad skill set so that they can fit into many different situations,” Dr. Klein said. She added, “The wildlife veterinarians have a broad understanding of all the interconnectedness between animals, people, and the environment.”\n\nDr. Klein has worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Public Health Service, and U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. With APHIS, one of her focuses was on highly pathogenic avian influenza at the interfaces between wild birds, poultry, and humans, and she helped establish the prevention and control program for H5 and H7 low-pathogenic avian influenza in the marketing system for live birds.\n\nShe is the first veterinarian that the U.S. Forest Service ever hired. The Forest Service needed to establish an institutional animal care and use committee to support its wildlife research, and she had prior experience serving on an IACUC as an attending veterinarian while working with the USFWS. The Forest Service also expanded her role to national program lead for fish and wildlife health.\n\nDr. Klein said what she has seen over her 30-year career is an anthology of wildlife medicine. She said, “I’ve been watching this career as a wildlife veterinarian emerge and expand tremendously.”\n\nTreasurer Goldman leaves behind a financially healthy Association\n\nThe Connecticut-based veterinarian explains AVMA’s budgeting process, gives advice to successor\n\nBy R. Scott Nolen\n\nWith his sixth and final year as AVMA treasurer coming to a close, Dr. Arnold Goldman spoke with AVMA News about the financial health of the Association and how the treasurer works with AVMA leaders to ensure their fiduciary responsibilities are met. The following responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ. With a term that spans six years, what are the AVMA treasurer’s responsibilities?\n\nA. The treasurer serves as a nonvoting member of the AVMA Board of Directors with a primary responsibility of oversight and reporting of financially relevant information, on all aspects of AVMA activity. The treasurer chairs the Budget and Finance Review Committee and also works collaboratively with the Strategy Management Committee and its chair. Together, these Board committees set priorities, weigh potential member value in proposed new programming, and then make recommendations to the Board. The treasurer is intimately involved with every step of this process and by extension with all AVMA activities. In carrying out these duties, the treasurer is charged with ensuring the Board follows established AVMA fiscal policies and processes in its decision making.\n\nFinally and perhaps most significantly, the treasurer is charged with the delivery of clear and accurate communication on financial and strategic matters to the AVMA House of Delegates and to the membership. So, while on the surface it would seem to be a narrowly tailored role, in fact the treasurer’s role is expansive. The trust of members in the Board’s fiscal diligence is in the treasurer’s hands, and transparency and agile communication serve to assure our members that their funds are being responsibly used to further their professional interests.\n\nQ. What do AVMA members need to know about the financial health of their association?\n\nA. The AVMA is financially healthy. There are several reasons for this. We have and follow written financial policies that comply with industry standards for reserves, spending, and funding allocation. We have an established, written process for budgeting and matching operating revenue to operating expenses. We have a reserves policy that ensures both solvency as well as the breathing room necessary to implement strategic programming to serve members, despite any adverse impact from the larger economy. We maintain between 50% and 150% of operating expenses in reserve, which ensures continued operations in the face of downturns and, during favorable economic periods, funds strategic initiatives to serve members’ needs. The AVMA also employs highly competent financial staff to oversee day-to-day management of member funds. The AVMA Audit Committee, in concert with an independent, outside financial auditor, regularly reviews and certifies our financial statements as accurate and in keeping with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nQ. What process does the Board follow when deciding matters that affect the members’ funds?\n\nA. The AVMA operating budget process is a clean-sheet endeavor that begins at the departmental level within AVMA. Beginning in the spring, each AVMA department evaluates its current responsibilities and proposes a departmental operating budget for the year. Once all departments report, the then-unified draft operating budget is evaluated by our CEO and Finance and Business Services Division and adjustments made in light of expected revenue and strategic priorities. Thereafter, the draft operating budget is shared with the Budget and Finance Review Committee, which is chaired by the treasurer. The BFRC then meets for its evaluation and makes further adjustments before sharing the draft operating budget with the Board with a recommendation regarding its approval. The Board meets each November to discuss, possibly alter, and vote on that draft. Once Board passage occurs, the draft operating budget becomes the final operating budget for the year.\n\nAn additional aspect of annual budgeting is allocating funds from reserves for the Strategic Operating Plan Fund. Each year, the Board funds this account at a fixed amount, based on existing economic conditions, expected investment revenue, and the anticipated costs of new strategic programming directed toward member needs. This account enables the use of investment earnings for new programming while allowing for flexibility in strategic spending to enhance member value.\n\nQ. How well would you say the Board executed its fiscal responsibilities during your time as treasurer?\n\nA. The financial policies that are in place and the budget process ensure that the Board executes its fiduciary duties responsibly, transparently, and professionally. The budget process, along with the safety valve of the Strategic Operating Plan Fund, as enabled by our reserves, facilitates the Board’s ability to operate diligently while also meeting members’ needs. Out-of–budget cycle funding requests are few and scrutinized not just for inherent value, but for the appropriateness of referral to the next budget cycle. There is a genuine and diligent desire by the Board to hew to process as a mark of responsible management. As treasurer, the appreciation by the Board of the necessity of adherence to policy and process means I am doing my job properly and maintaining member confidence.\n\nQ. How is the AVMA investment portfolio overseen and managed?\n\nA. The AVMA investment portfolio, which is also the vehicle through which our reserves are managed, is held in various accounts managed by an external investment banking and wealth management firm. The Board has established a written investment policy statement for the AVMA, which guides the investment parameters and decisions overseen by our investment managers. Several times each year, the Budget and Finance Review Committee and the Board of Directors review the IPS for currency relative to the AVMA’s needs and existing economic conditions. At each Board meeting and in between as necessary, my formal treasurer’s reports include an assessment of the state of our investments and any recommendations for change.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court hears challenge to sow housing law\n\nBy R. Scott Nolen\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in litigation challenging the constitutionality of a California law banning sales of out-of-state pork products from producers who fail to meet a certain housing standard for breeding sows.\n\nProposition 12—a ballot initiative approved by California voters in 2018—allows only for the sale of meat derived from pigs bred by sows provided at least 24 square feet of floor space during the birthing and weaning processes. The standard is required by no other state.\n\nThe law also sets housing standards for veal calves and egg-laying hens raised and sold in California. Proponents say the measure promotes animal welfare and provides Californians with access to food sourced from humanely raised animals.\n\nCritics counter that the law violates the U.S. constitution by regulating the pork industry outside California’s borders. The National Pork Producers Council and the American Farm Bureau Federation sued Karen Ross, in her capacity as secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, to invalidate Prop 12.\n\nIn July 2021, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their appeal, however, saying the law regulated only in-state activity.\n\nPlaintiffs then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming the 9th Circuit had “brushed aside” several Supreme Court decisions on the constitution’s commerce clause, saying they held that “laws with significant extraterritorial effects violate our federalist scheme.”\n\nThe petition was supported by amicus briefs from Elizabeth Prelogar, solicitor general of the United States; 20 state governments; the American Association of Swine Veterinarians; the National Association of Manufacturers; and the Cattlemen’s Beef Association. The California VMA has no position on the law, an official with the CVMA said.\n\nThen in March 2022, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the challenge to Prop 12. Oral arguments before the court were Oct. 11, 2022.\n\nIn the meantime, the California Department of Food and Agriculture finalized regulations in September to implement Prop 12. Enforcement of the law was originally supposed to begin Jan. 1, 2022, but a state-court judge in Sacramento ruled that grocers, restaurants, and retailers would not be subject to enforcement of the new restrictions on sales of whole pork meat until six months after the state enacted its final regulations.\n\nFor veal and egg products, the regulations are effective immediately. However, that could change depending on the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nRepresenting the pork producers, Timothy Bishop told the Supreme Court, “California wants to change farming methods everywhere.”\n\n“No other state makes its farmers house pigs the way that California does. And very few farmers do,” Bishop said.\n\n“If Proposition 12 is lawful, New York can say that pigs have to have 26 feet of space and send inspectors into farms to police compliance as California does. Oregon can condition imports on workers being paid the minimum wage. And Texas can condition sales on the producer employing only lawful U.S. residents. And at that point, we have truly abandoned the framers’ idea of a national market.”\n\nMichael Mongan, solicitor general for California, argued that by overwhelmingly passing Prop 12, California voters chose to pay higher prices to serve their local interest in refusing to provide a market to products they viewed as morally objectionable.\n\n“The commerce clause does not prohibit that choice. Prop 12 is not protectionist or discriminatory,” Morgan said. “And it doesn’t violate the general principle against regulating wholly extraterritorial commerce.”\n\nThe court is expected to rule on National Pork Producers Council v. Ross this year.\n\nVeterinarian, grandma one stop away from completing epic road trip\n\nDuo’s quest to see all U.S. national parks spurred by finding passion outside the workplace\n\nBy Coco Lederhouse\n\nDr. Brad Ryan and his grandmother Joy Ryan have driven 50,000 miles together. They’ve also flown to Alaska, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands—all toward reaching their goal of visiting all 63 U.S. national parks. And now they are closing in on their last stop: the National Park of American Samoa, located in the U.S. territory in the South Pacific. American Samoa is 6,700 miles from their hometown in Duncan Falls, Ohio.\n\nAs they prepare to check the final park off their bucket list, Dr. Ryan, who is a professional services veterinarian for Antech Diagnostics, spoke with AVMA News about his memories and lessons learned along the way.\n\nFavorite memories\n\nIt all started in 2015 with a weekend trip to Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which straddles the border between North Carolina and Tennessee. Dr. Ryan was in his fourth year of veterinary college at The Ohio State University and seeking some time in nature to decompress from the mental health challenges he was facing.\n\nKnowing how much his grandma Joy loved the outdoors, Dr. Ryan asked her if she’d like to join. It was there she climbed her first mountain at age 85.\n\n“I wouldn’t have called her to join me if she hadn’t been such an influence in my life for love and reverence of nature,” Dr. Ryan said.\n\nIn 2017, they visited their next national park, Badlands National Park in South Dakota, where they saw bison, prairie dogs, bighorn sheep, and jackrabbits. It would be the start of a 21-park circuit around the U.S. that year.\n\n“Brad came up with the idea, but I was game for the adventure from the moment we began researching all our spectacular national parks,” grandma Joy said.\n\nDr. Ryan said many of their best memories from the parks are of the wildlife they saw. The pair sat on the shores of Fishercap Lake in Glacier National Park in Montana at dusk to watch moose. They saw elk bugling in Rocky Mountain National Park. They observed humpback whales in front of their boat in Channel Islands National Park off the Southern California coast. Grandma Joy nearly sat down next to an alligator in the Florida Everglades. While landing in Katmai National Park in Alaska, “we saw a giant brown bear sticking out of the water like a periscope,” Dr. Ryan said.\n\nThey attended bear school and had a terrifying but exhilarating time hiking trails. The reward at the end of the hike was a scene of 35 brown bears at Brooks Falls grabbing salmon as they leapt out of the water on their journey up the river. It was something grandma Joy had always wanted to see.\n\n“I’ve had so many great wildlife encounters, but to share something on that scale—one of the greatest wildlife spectacles in the world—with someone who is 91 was the cherry on top,” Dr. Ryan said.\n\nStaying in focus\n\nEarly in their travels, Dr. Ryan decided to document their visits to national parks on social media, which turned into a viral sensation that resonated with fans worldwide. Grandma Joy is now 92 years old, and her adventures with Dr. Ryan have gained nearly 70,000 Instagram followers and more than 21,000 fans on Facebook.\n\nThe hashtag #GrandmaJoysRoadTrip shows moments of hiking through the Hoh Rainforest at Olympic National Park and even zip lining at New River Gorge National Park and Preserve in West Virginia. Grandma Joy’s favorite adventure was whitewater rafting at Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve in south-central Alaska.\n\n“I felt free and exhilarated. It was unlike anything I’ve ever attempted in my life. It made me feel like I was a kid again,” she said.\n\nUntil their trips together, grandma Joy’s only real connection to the great outdoors was watching nature documentaries. “Lots of people saw their own grandparents in grandma Joy, or it reminded them of a missed opportunity, but anyone can still make the most of now and create some magic in their own families,” Dr. Ryan said.\n\nHe is often asked in TV interviews how the journey began.\n\n“The honest answer required me to talk about my mental health struggles. Through all that I found empowerment,” Dr. Ryan said. “At vet school, I was suffering in silence, making comparisons all the time, struggling with self-doubt. I had no idea that our first road trip would be connected to any broader conversation in wellness and veterinary medicine.”\n\nDr. Ryan said veterinarians tend to attach some self-criticism to finding work-life balance. But his journey with grandma Joy has taught him to set boundaries and prioritize his mental health. He said he’s a different person than he was seven years ago and has found his way within the profession.\n\nIn his current position, he travels to veterinary hospitals all over the country discussing tests that Antech is launching. He also now does public speaking engagements.\n\nDr. Ryan stressed the difference between perfectionism and healthy striving. He said: “You can be a healthy striver and also juggle a few different balls in your life at the same time. Proving your worth and getting to the top of the pack isn’t what makes you a whole person.”\n\nSeeking Samoa\n\nThe 63rd and final stop on the Ryans’ journey is in American Samoa. The national park there, spread across the islands of Tutuila, Ofu, and Ta‘ū, is the most remote park in the U.S. national park system. The Ryans are currently raising money on GoFundMe for travel expenses to visit the three islands in April 2023.\n\nExploring employee assistance programs for veterinary practices\n\nEAPs offer a variety of resources but often see low employee participation\n\nBy Coco Lederhouse\n\nWhen it comes to selecting employee benefits, owners and managers of veterinary practices may have a hard time selecting the best options. And employees are not always aware of the full breadth of options they have access to, particularly those programs that exist outside their insurance plan.\n\nAs practice owners look to innovative solutions to attract and retain staff members—as well as promote mental health and well-being—an employee assistance program could be the latest untapped resource in their benefits toolkit. An EAP is a package that helps assist employees with personal and work-related challenges that could impact their job performance, health, or mental well-being.\n\nEAPs are available to employers through third-party benefit providers. A number of veterinary associations and companies have partnered with these providers of employee benefits to offer EAP services to members as one of their benefits.\n\nPricing for an EAP can fluctuate, but many providers offer an array of customizable menus to best fit a practice. For instance, if an employer wants only to focus on mental health benefits, the employer can select from a list of specific services for employees.\n\nMental health and well-being\n\nLisa M. Stewart-Brown is the program manager of mental health and well-being for Banfield Pet Hospital. Headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, the organization employs over 3,600 veterinarians in more than 1,000 hospital locations throughout the United States. Banfield’s health and well-being program is made up of various tools, benefits, and services to address associates’ mental, emotional, and physical safety and health.\n\n“We knew that if we wanted our associates to feel inspired to seek help and utilize our programs and benefits, they needed to be relevant to people’s specific needs,” Stewart-Brown said.\n\nShe continued, “Having such a program in place can also help to destigmatize the topic of mental health in the workplace, which is often a key barrier to people getting help.”\n\nWellness and other resources\n\nFor employees who have personal or work-related problems, employee assistance programs offer free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services. EAPs can also offer 24/7 coverage, national therapist networks, wellness websites, consultation for supervisors, and other services.\n\nEasy-to-access counseling services provide a way to help employees with any personal issues that may be affecting their job performance, including a variety of issues from stress-related conditions and substance abuse to grief and relationship problems. Coverage extends to the employees’ dependents as well and applies to nonwork topics such as legal and financial issues and resources to help secure elder care and child care.\n\nJamie Falzone, executive director of the Massachusetts VMA, said part of her role is to identify new benefits that will serve MVMA members, both in terms of workplace well-being and personal well-being.\n\nThat’s why the MVMA partnered with CorpCare to provide a discounted EAP program for members’ clinics. Participating clinics have a choice of offering plans with three or five counseling sessions. The cost is $200 a year per hospital for up to three sessions for each staff member and $350 a year per hospital for up to five sessions for each staff member.\n\n“Of those practices that have an EAP, it is really appreciated by employees, and it’s a low-cost way to show employers’ commitment to wellness,” Falzone explained. She has found that having an EAP available helps with retention and happiness in the workplace, and she hopes to see more members using one.\n\nFalzone mentioned that CorpCare has a dedicated marketing person to help promote the program to MVMA practices. The company provides periodic newsletter clips and information to include in weekly member email messages and handles all promotional efforts, including offering interactive resources such as webinars.\n\nThe Colorado VMA, Illinois State VMA, Ohio VMA, and Portland VMA in Portland, Oregon, are just some of the other associations that use CorpCare EAPs. In addition, the Veterinary Hospital Managers Association has an EAP with member-only pricing through CuraLinc Healthcare.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe payment plan for most traditional EAPs is per employee per month, which means that the less they are used, the more profit the provider makes. Participating businesses are charged per possible person who may use the EAP. Often employers end up paying for a service that the vast majority of employees do not use.\n\n“One common concern regarding EAP benefits is low employee participation, with some companies across industries seeing utilization in the 1% to 3% range,” said Banfield’s Stewart-Brown.\n\nIf an employer doesn’t sufficiently promote the program internally, it can be easy for employees to write off a program, especially if they don’t know where to go for more information or whom to contact.\n\nAnother barrier to care is many people don’t know whether they have access to an EAP. According to the Merck Animal Health Veterinary Wellbeing Study, 31% of responding veterinarians reported that their employer provided an EAP, 44% said their employer did not provide an EAP, and 26% didn’t know.\n\nOne concern that employees have about an EAP is confidentiality. Some employees worry that they must notify their company if they are utilizing services from an EAP or that their workplace will be aware of whatever personal information is shared. However, the vast majority of EAP providers do not share any information with an employer other than how many participants use the service.\n\nIn an industry that can carry high levels of stress, many employers view an EAP as a straightforward way to support their employees.\n\n“We believe that cultivating help-seeking behaviors among staff is the key to creating a culture of well-being and driving higher benefit utilization,” Stewart-Brown said. “Offering tools and resources is a great start, but if your workforce doesn’t feel comfortable reaching out for help, they won’t utilize them.”\n\nHumane slaughter guidelines available for comment\n\nThe AVMA Guidelines for the Humane Slaughter of Animals, which cover the humane slaughter of animals raised for food or fiber, reflect the AVMA’s ongoing commitment to ensure that the treatment of animals during every stage of life is as humane and respectful as possible.\n\nThe AVMA Panel on Humane Slaughter and its working groups spent about two years revising the 2016 version of the guidelines. Now the draft revisions are available for comment by AVMA members until Jan. 28 at jav.ma/draftguidelines. The panel will reconcile comments received before the guidelines are published next year.\n\nThe expanded guidelines encompass more species—including the slaughter of animals not primarily designated for the food chain, such as animals raised for fur—and has been made more user-friendly via organization by species rather than by techniques. Other revisions include an updated introduction with information about applicable federal statutes and regulations, religious nonstun slaughter being incorporated within the relevant species sections, and the addition of fur bearers as a category of animals, covering mink, foxes, and rabbits. In addition, all species sections include updated references.\n\nEvery stage of the slaughter process is addressed, from an animal’s arrival at a facility—if applicable—through the animal’s death. The guidelines include information related to regulations, oversight, and training; design of facilities and movement through facilities; techniques; and how to detect problems in the process and take corrective actions. The morality of killing animals for food is not covered in the guidelines.\n\nAnimal welfare contest puts students, veterinarians to the test\n\nMore than 220 students and veterinarians representing 23 universities from across North America competed in the 22nd annual AVMA Animal Welfare Assessment Contest, held Nov. 18-20 at North Carolina State University.\n\nIn this latest contest, undergraduates, veterinary and graduate students, and AVMA member veterinarians evaluated the welfare of show chickens, dairy-beef cattle, an octopus in an aquarium, and shelter dogs and cats. Contestants presented their findings to experts from a 12-member panel of scientists and veterinarians.\n\nFunded in part through an educational grant from Merck Animal Health, the Animal Welfare Assessment Contest teaches students to assess the welfare of animals in a variety of settings using science-based methods and reasoning. Students are given the opportunity to weigh evidence and present sound evaluations.\n\n“This event is so important to the AVMA’s efforts to help our next generation of veterinary professionals enhance their understanding and awareness of issues affecting the welfare of all animals, and so I applaud everyone who took that extra step to further educate themselves about these critical issues,” AVMA President Lori Teller said in a statement.\n\nWinners of the 2022 contest are as follows:\n\nInteractive Assessment, Individuals: Undergraduate, Junior Division—Nick Prosek, University of Nebraska-Lincoln; Undergraduate, Senior Division—Rhiannon Hall, University of Kentucky; Veterinary Student Division—Shannon Kelley, The Ohio State University; and Graduate Division—Hannah Spitzer, University of Prince Edward Island.\n\nInteractive Assessment, Teams: Undergraduate, Junior Division—Texas A&M University, Team 1; Undergraduate, Senior Division—North Carolina State University; Veterinary Student Division—University of Guelph, Team Gold; and Graduate Team—University of Minnesota.\n\nVeterinary Student Division, Individual: First place—Jacob Maxwell, University of Guelph; second place—Magnus Yoshimura, Long Island University; third place—Shaela Hurley, University of Guelph; fourth place—Emily Merry, University of Guelph; and fifth place—Nena Stanekovic, University of Guelph.\n\nVeterinary Student Division, Teams: First place—University of Guelph, Team Gold; second place—University of Prince Edward Island, Team 1; third place—University of Prince Edward Island, Team 2; fourth place—Long Island University, Team 1; and fifth place—University of Guelph, Team Red.\n\nGraduate Division, Individual: First place—Guadalupe Ceja, Texas A&M University; second place—Gillian Power, University of Guelph; third place—Brooke Parrish, University of Nebraska-Lincoln; fourth place—Hannah Spitzer, University of Prince Edward Island; and fifth place—Kiana McDole, University of Guelph.\n\nGraduate Division, Teams: First place—University of Minnesota; second place—University of Guelph; third place—Purdue University, Team 1; fourth place—University of Kentucky; and fifth place—Purdue University, Team 2.\n\nUndergraduate, Senior Division, Individual: First place—Anna Nicklas, University of Guelph; second place—Jessie Bouterse, The Ohio State University; third place—Jenna Volinski, Michigan State University; fourth place—Elizabeth Schafer, The Ohio State University; and fifth place—Taylor Altman, North Carolina State University.\n\nUndergraduate, Senior Division, Teams: First place—The Ohio State University; second place—North Carolina State University; third place—University of Guelph, Team Gold; fourth place—Michigan State University, Team 1; and fifth place—Michigan State University, Team 2.\n\nUndergraduate, Junior Division, Individual: First place—Erin Stockland, Texas A&M University; second place—Iris Mackenzie, The Ohio State University; third place—Megan Hohman, The Ohio State University; fourth place—Jillian Gordon, Texas A&M University; and fifth place—Shelby Jones, The Ohio State University.\n\nUndergraduate, Junior Division, Teams: First place—Texas A&M University, Team 1; second place—The Ohio State University, Team 2; third place—Texas A&M University, Team 2; fourth place—The Ohio State University, Team 1; and fifth place—Colorado State University, Team 1.\n\nIn Memory\n\nAurelio H.
