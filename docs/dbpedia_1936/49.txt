About Us

Philosophy

We need three things to survive; food, water and shelter. The Laura Keller Real Estate Team is proud to offer top notch services for people to find shelter. Whether you're buying or selling something modest, or want to finally get into your dream home, we are here for you!

As in any industry, there are lots of options for you to find just the right people to help you reach your goals. We believe in providing the best services for both sellers and buyers, in any stage of your life. If you're just starting out, moving up, downsizing, going through a separation or death in the family, investing, or building, we've done it all! With years of experience, you can rest assured that you will be well taken care of.

Beyond the sale, the Team will keep in touch with you. We want you to know that if you ever need a roofer or financial advisor or tutor or someone to finish your basement, we've got an extensive list of trusted professionals who can help you. One of our firm beliefs is to encourage, mentor and support other small business owners in the community. If you are a small business owner, or have a service that you think would be a good fit, send Laura an email to discuss the opportunity to be added to her network.

Call us today to discuss your goals. We have the tools, the skills, and the passion that will help you get what you want!
