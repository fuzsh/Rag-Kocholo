After graduating from USU with a degree in civil and environmental engineering, Franson played five seasons of professional basketball on several different teams in Europe.\n\nRuss Paulsen\n\nHometown: Clarion, Iowa\n\nSport: Wrestling\n\nYears: 1972-75\n\nA three-time team captain on the wrestling team, Russ Paulsen finished his Aggie career as one of the most accomplished athletes in Utah State wrestling history. Competing from 1972-75, Paulsen finished his four-year Aggie career with an overall individual record of 87-13-2, which was the most wins ever by a USU wrestler at the time. Paulsen was a two-time NCAA participant in two different weight classes, wrestling at 158 pounds as a sophomore and 177 pounds as a senior. During his senior year, Paulsen had a perfect 30-0-1 record in dual matches while wrestling above his weight class, and he was the No. 2 seed going into the NCAA Tournament that year. He was also awarded the Wayne Estes Memorial Award, which is given annually to the top USU senior student-athlete from any sport. Paulsen was also presented with the George \"Doc\" Nelson Award, which was given to the top individual wrestler on the team. During his freshman year in 1972, Paulsen became the first Aggie wrestler to ever be named USU Freshman of the Year after posting a 16-3-1 record and winning the Beehive Tournament. He went on to become a three-time champion of the Beehive Tournament during his career, and in 1975, he had the opportunity to represent the West as he participated at the ninth annual East vs. West All-Star meet in Clarion, Pa. He was also the first Aggie wrestler to ever win an individual title at the Arizona Invitational.

Following his collegiate career, Paulsen served as an assistant coach with the Aggie program for three seasons, before coaching at Intermountain Indian School in Brigham City, Utah, for one year, West Jordan (Utah) High School for two years and eventually settling down as the head coach at Bingham High School in South Jordan, Utah. At Bingham HS, he coached 11 state champions and 89 state placers in 25 years. Paulsen retired from coaching in 2018.\n\nDonald Penn\n\nHometown: Inglewood, Calif.\n\nSport: Football\n\nYears: 2002-05\n\nA four-year anchor on the Utah State offensive line, Donald Penn is one of the most accomplished football players to ever put on the Aggie uniform. After taking over the reins as the starting right tackle in the third game of his freshman season, Penn went on to start 44 consecutive games for USU. Following his freshman season, he made the switch to left tackle, where he started every game of his sophomore, junior and senior seasons. During his senior year in 2005, Penn was selected by his teammates as a team captain. He earned second-team all-Western Athletic Conference honors following the season, and was selected to play in the Hula Bowl, an annual all-star game consisting of many of the nation's top football players. As a senior, Penn helped pave the way for an Aggie offense that averaged 405.6 yards of total offense per game – 144.1 on the ground and 261.5 through the air – and 32.7 points per game. Following his collegiate career, Penn entered the NFL and was signed by the Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent. Following a brief stint in Minnesota, Penn was picked up by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where just four games into his professional career he became a starter. He spent seven years in Tampa Bay before a six-year stint with the Oakland Raiders. During the summer of 2019, Penn signed a deal to continue his career with the Washington Redskins, making him one of the longest-tenured offensive linemen in the NFL. Penn's record of consistency and durability continued into his NFL career, as he played in a streak of 170 consecutive starts, which ran for over a decade between 2006-17. At the time, that was the longest-running streak of consecutive starts for a lineman in the NFL. During his 14-year NFL career, Penn has been selected to the Pro Bowl three times (2010, 2016, 2017), has started 184 career games ,and has caught six passes for 26 yards and four touchdowns, which is tied for the most touchdowns in NFL history by an offensive lineman.\n\nKevin Robinson\n\nHometown: Fresno, Calif.\n\nSports: Football\n\nYears: 2004-07\n\nOne of the most dynamic playmakers in Utah State football history, Kevin Robinson earned All-American accolades from six different publications during his senior season in 2007, including first-team honors from CBSSportsline.com.

With 2,317 all-purpose yards as a senior, Robinson ranks No. 2 all-time in the WAC and is one of just nine players in the history of the league to top the 2,000 all-purpose yards mark. Robinson, who was also named a first-team freshman All-American by The Sporting News, ended his collegiate career as the NCAA career record holder with a 16.16 yards per play average as he notched 6,479 career yards in 401 career plays, which now ranks 16th all-time in the NCAA. Robinson also tied the NCAA record with eight combined kick and punt return touchdowns in his career. As for Utah State, Robinson is the school's career record holder with 178 receptions and eight combined kick returns for touchdowns and tied for first all-time at USU with four punt returns for touchdowns.

During his four-year career, Youngblood started 113 out of a possible 114 games, the fifth-most in school history. Youngblood scored 15.4 points per game as a sophomore, 18.8 as a junior and 17.1 as a senior, becoming one of just five Aggie basketball players to ever lead Utah State in scoring in three-consecutive seasons.
