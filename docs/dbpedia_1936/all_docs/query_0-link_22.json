If you have information you are willing to share, please contact our office at (765) 494-8593.\n\nJames D. Adams (1954) - James D. Adams, Columbia City, has served the interests of his community, agricultural and otherwise, with singular distinction to himself and the service ideal for at least three decades. He has been active as a farmer, a breeder of Cheviot sheep, Guernsey and Angus cattle, and has had wide busi­ness interests in his home community. He was a member of a small group which estab­lished the Columbia Woolen Mills in 1916. This group fought through bias and skepticism in mak­ing the mill a reality. He again exhibited his excep­tional organizational ability by bringing to Colum­bia City the Blue Bell Overall factory and the Columbia Products Company (a screw machine fac­tory). He himself set up the Whitley Product, Inc. (another screw machine plant) which has been operating very successfully since its founding. He has been editor of the local newspaper, and has served on numerous other public service groups such as the State Highway Commission. Jim was an early booster of the rural electrifica­tion program and fought (before REA) for the local municipal plant to sell energy to farmers in the area. When REMC services became available, he helped bring service quickly to the county. He has been an ardent supporter of conservation activ­ities. He has been president of the Citizens State Bank in Columbia City since the 1930's. His unalterable devotion to his community has established a precedent in this state. His life of public service can only be properly rewarded by the satisfactions of a job well done.\n\nW. A.

Military Service Fort Bragg-October 1942-March 1943.\n\nWilliam T. Anderson (1976) - William T. \"BiB\" Anderson, Bedford, Indiana, is about as well known in Indiana agricultural circles as anyone imply because he is always where the action is as far as our great profession is concerned. Bill was raised on a small farm near Brazil in Clay County. After graduation from Purdue in 1931, he taught vocational agriculture at Shawswick and Bloomington High Schools. His livestock judging teams were recipients of many high honors. He worked for several years in the Livestock Marketing Division in the Indiana Farm Bureau, serving part of that time as manager of the Logansport Producers Stockyards. In 1949, Bill joined the Purdue Animal Husbandry Department as an Extension Livestock Specialist. He was a leader in organizing the Southern Indiana Feeder Calf Sales. To put it mildly, Bill is a devoted enthusiast of Southern Indiana agriculture. Many a farmer in that part of the state has seen his livestock business improve as a result of Bill's insistence that he use a proven bull, ram, or boar to upgrade his breeding herd. It is a commonly known fact that Bill often financed these purchases himself. Bill Anderson's knowledge of agriculture made him a natural to become the farm director of WTTV television at Bloomington. He quickly became a household word for thousands of Indiana farmers. Later, he returned to the Indiana Farm Bureau Livestock Producers organization to head up their Tend-R-Leen pork program. Bill was right where he belonged - with his foot up on the fence, helping farmers in Southern Indiana produce and market their feeder pigs in the best way possible. The job was only a part of Bill's interest in agriculture. He was a member of the Indiana State Fair Board for nine years where he served as swine superintendent and as director of the Coliseum. He is presently in his sixth three-year term as a Soil Conservation District Supervisor, and is president of the Lawrence County Farm Bureau organization. He is active in the Erie Methodist Church, the Lawrence County Purdue Ag Chapter, and the Lawrence County Fair. Bill and son Tom operate a 560 acre grassland farm out near Heltonville where they breed Berkshire hogs and run around one hundred Angus cows. He is tremendously proud of all the things he has been able to do for agriculture, but let me tell you a little secret. His most cherished attainment is the fact that he has not missed a Purdue home football game in the last fifty years. That should tell you something about Bill Anderson's loyalty.\n\nO.K. Anderson (1985) - Anderson, Knox County clerk, is a 1940 graduate of the School of Agriculture. After service in World War II he earned an M.S. at the University of Missouri and joined the Indiana Cooperative Extension Service, serving 32 years as an agricultural agent in Bartholomew, Spencer, Pike, Sullivan, Grant and Knox Counties. Anderson retired from the CES in 1975, and was elected to the Indiana State Fair Board, serving eight years before he was elected president of the fair board in 1983. In Knox County he has served as Rotary Club president and executive director of the Knox County Chamber of Commerce, and as a member of the Wabash Valley Association, the Vincennes Historical and Antiquarian Society, the Sons of the American Revolution, the Farm Bureau and the Knox County Cattlemen’s Association. He received, in 1984 Vincennes university’s Walter A. Davis Memorial Citation for community service.\n\nPhillip G. Anderson (2003) - Phil Anderson was raised on a diversified grain and livestock farm in Clinton County, Indiana. He was active in both FFA and 4-H, receiving state and national honors, including serving as Indiana FFA State Northern Region Vice-President in 1979-80. He graduated from Purdue University in 1983 with a B.S. in Agricultural Economics in the Sales and Marketing option. He has spent most of his career as an association executive, representing agricultural commodity and producer groups. He served as the Executive Director of the Indiana Corn Growers Association (ICGA) from 1985 to 1991. For the next two years, he was the Communications Director for the American Veal Association. Since 1988 he has also served as the Executive Director of the Indiana Veal Promotion Committee. In 1993 he was named Executive Vice President of the Indiana Beef Cattle Association (IBCA). As Executive Vice President of IBCA he has led the organization to its all-time high in membership and, from 1993 to 1996, implemented a strategic plan that reversed a serious financial crisis and took IBCA to its strongest financial position ever, one that included operating reserves. He has forged new partnerships to benefit Indiana’s beef industry, including leading efforts to coordinate beef programs and resources through the Five State Beef Initiative, and he has worked with Purdue University to refocus Indiana’s Beef Improvement Programs into programs like Indiana Quality Plus (IQ+) BEEF, Indiana Beef Evaluation and Economics Feeding (IBEEF), the On-Farm Carcass Performance Program, and the Indiana Farm Fresh Beef program, all of which serve to improve the marketability of Indiana beef cattle and help Hoosier cattlemen capture more value from their products. Anderson is a graduate of the Indiana Agricultural Leadership Program and has served the Indiana Agricultural Leadership Institute both as chairman of the Ag Forum programs from 1999 to 2000 and as a member of the Board of Directors. He used his coalition building skills to found the Indiana Land Use Consortium, which he chaired during its first five years, and to help create the Indiana Ag and Natural Resources Land Use Working Group, which he chaired from 1997 to 1999. He was a member of the Team Ag Steering Committee for the World Trade Organization Listening Session held in Indianapolis in 1999. He was vice-chairman of the Governor’s Indiana Millennium Celebration for Agriculture in 1999-2000. In 1999 he spearheaded an effort to conduct an industry-wide Indiana Ag Leadership Summit. He is a member of Purdue’s Animal Science Advisory Council, and he is on the board of the Center for Agricultural Science and Heritage. Anderson’s service extends to his community as well. He is active in St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church, where he has chaired the Liturgy Committee and has served as a cantor/soloist in the choir. He is a member of the Purdue Chapter of Delta Upsilon International Fraternity where he has served as Alumni Secretary and Strategic Planner, leading to construction of a new chapter house. He is a member of the Carmel Club of Rotary International where he served as club president in 1995-96, District Governor’s Representative 1997-99, and District Trainer 2000-01. Since 2000 he has been a 4-H project leader in Hamilton County. In 2001 Governor Frank O’Bannon honored Phil Anderson as a Distinguished Hoosier. Anderson’s impact on Indiana agriculture was best summed up with these words from his nominators: “His unselfish commitment and passion to do the right thing for his state, industry and community are an example for all to follow.”\n\nJess C. Andrew (1946) - The Ag Alumni office has no biographical information on this award winner. If you have information you are willing to share, please contact our office at (765) 494-8593.\n\nFred Andrews (1978) - Fred Andrews received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Massachusetts and his Ph.D. from the University of Missouri. Dr. Andrews became a Purdue Staff member in 1940 as a member of the Purdue Dairy Department. From 1949 to 1953 he was assistant to the dean of the Purdue graduate school. When the college decided to consolidate the Dairy, Poultry Science, and Animal Science, Dr. Andrews was named the head of the new department. Dr. Andrews was widely known for his work on the endocrine regulation of growth, reproductive physiology, and environmental physiology in domestic animals. He initiated the teaching and research program at Purdue for physiology of reproduction of domestic animals. He also was one of the first people to work on artificial insemination of dairy cows. In 1956 he was a member of a special Colombian mission for the Rockefeller Foundation. He also served on committees of the National Academy of Sciences, as a member of the screening committee for Fulbright awards, and as a reviewer for the National Science Foundation. His fraternal associations include Phi Kappa Phi, Gamma Sigma Delta, and Sigma Xi.\n\nBeth Archer (2011) - Beth Archer has a talent for influencing people she comes in contact with. After graduating from Purdue with a B.S. in Home Economics Education, she worked as a Consumer and Family Science teacher and for the state Department of Education. In 1991 she became an employee of AgrIInstitute and was eventually promoted to her current position of Executive Director. Beth has since touched the lives of over 300 Indiana agriculturalists through her work with the Indiana Ag Leadership Program. Beth is one of the most vocal advocates for advancing Indiana agriculture through her leadership with AgrIInstitute. Under Beth’s direction the program has grown, become financially independent, and been recognized as the premier leadership opportunity for cultivating leadership in Indiana’s agriculture industry. Participants in the Ag Leadership Program are developed to be pro-advocates of agriculture. The program uses well-developed media training so that the graduates are able to appropriately meet the challenge of explaining agricultural practices to opposition groups. She has secured grants for the program from Cenex Harvest States Foundation, Phillip Morris, Farm Credit Services Foundation, Lily Endowment, Office of Community and Rural Affairs, Pioneer Hybrid, and the Indiana Department of Rural Affairs. With Beth in charge, AgrIInstitute has been brought to a level that is both admired and envied by Ag Leadership programs across the country. Her hard work was recognized by her colleagues when she was named Leader of the year for the International Association Programs for Agriculture Leadership. Beth’s strong advocacy for agriculture has also led her to work with other organizations within the industry. She was appointed to the Indiana Rural Development Council by the Lt. Governor and was elected to chair the Council by her peers. She also chairs the Indiana Agricultural Round Table and is President of the Indiana Leadership Association. Even after all of her other responsibilities, Beth still finds time to volunteer in her local community. She served two years on the Purdue Extension Advisory Council for Hendricks County, assisted with the formation of the Leadership Hendricks County program, and served as team captain for the Danville Relay for Life. Additionally she is a children’s ministry team leader and secured a grant for the building expansion at Clayton Christian Church.\n\nShalamar Armstrong (2023) - West Lafayette, Indiana\n\nIndiana is considered a leader in cover crop adoption. Still, a recent study concluded that cover crops are used in just 7.2 percent of Midwest fields. That’s a four-fold increase from 2011, but cover cropping clearly is not a common practice. In position to change that is Shalamar Armstrong, who has worked his way to the front lines of that agricultural battlefield.\n\nArmstrong, an associate professor of soil conservation and management in the Department of Agronomy at Purdue, does not have a formal Extension appointment yet has built an extensive state and regional network that generates on-farm research collaborations, emerging research questions, and partnerships with federal and state conservation agencies. The overarching objective of his research program is to determine the agronomic, environmental and economic benefits of cover crops.\n\nHis degrees are from Southern University, Alabama A&M and Purdue (PhD, 2010, agronomy/soil chemistry). Armstrong worked as a research soil scientist at the USDA-ARS National Erosion Research Laboratory, then was an assistant professor of soil science at Illinois State before returning to Purdue in 2015. He was promoted to associate professor in 2020.\n\n“While maybe perceived as a relative newcomer to Purdue, he has already supplied significant contributions to Indiana agriculture,” says a director with the Nature Conservancy of Indiana, writing in support of Armstrong’s Certificate of Distinction nomination. “Building on efforts he initiated in Illinois, he seamlessly jumped the border, brought his knowledge, expanded his projects and is now empowering growers on soil health efforts to enhance our state’s water quality.” He admires Armstrong’s “actionable research.”\n\nArmstrong’s collaborative efforts include helping to design a web-based cover crop decision support tool that provides users with data and information in a practical, easy-to-use format. In the Upper Mississippi River Basin, his applied research program has generated significant interest in soil conservation, carbon sequestration, soil health and climate-smart cropping systems and how they affect nutrient fate and availability.\n\n“His research is cutting edge,” another nominator says of Armstrong, who received the College of Agriculture’s Unsung Diversity Hero Award in 2019. “Moreover, he is a great teacher who is doing an excellent job teaching several essential classes.”\n\nKatherine Armstrong (2018) - Grand corporate strategies wither without leadership. When Dow AgroSciences (DAS) decided that seeds and traits warranted major investments of research and dollars, Katherine Armstrong was chosen to head a new research and development department — Trait Product Development. “Katherine was the obvious candidate,” says a retired vice president of DAS who worked with Armstrong for nearly two decades. “She embraced a daunting task. She successfully attracted outstanding talent from both inside and outside the company, developed novel capabilities and technologies, and delivered scientific as well as pipeline contributions that fully met or exceeded expectations. Much of Katherine and her team’s impact is just now starting to make its way into the hands of growers.” In another letter written in support of Armstrong receiving a Certificate of Distinction, Armstrong is praised for being “a stellar example of leadership, and she left a powerfully positive legacy with Dow AgroSciences R&D for scientific excellence and advancement.” The Indianapolis-based global company’s seed business doubled, thanks in part to the research strategy that she “brought to fruition and championed.” In the same vein, to steer reticent co-workers through Six Sigma, a productivity initiative, she chose a “unique focus” that “captured the heads and hearts of the R&D organization and drove dramatic changes and technical progress across her domain.” Ms. Armstrong helped strengthen the long Purdue–Dow AgroSciences relationship. The DAS-Purdue Joint Steering Team, now in its 11th year, has a goal of boosting the partnership between the two entities in research, teaching, and Extension. Armstrong was co-leader of the committee from 2008 to 2014, and she oversaw a steady flow of resources from DAS to the College of Agriculture, supporting both applied and basic plant sciences research, especially by graduate students. DAS specialists helped Purdue design the Indiana Corn and Soybean Innovation Center, which opened in 2016 and is the first field phenotyping facility in North America. “The relationship stands the test of time,” a DAS executive says. A recently announced discovery of a novel soybean gene that confers resistance to a particular pathogen is one result of the collaboration. “Due to the clear outcomes for both Purdue and Dow AgroSciences, Purdue embraced this university-industry connection, which now serves as a model for relationships with other universities as well. The strategy she set continues to thrive.” This and that • Bachelor’s degree (Biology) from the University of Virginia, 1978; master’s (Molecular and Population Genetics) from the University of Georgia, 1981. • “Mapping genes conditioning in vitro androgenesis in maize using RFLP analysis,” published in 1992, has been cited in scientific publications 62 times and as recently as 2016. • The listed inventor on six patents pertaining to the genetic modification of plants. • College of Agriculture’s Dean’s Advisory Council member, 2007-2010. • Worked 18 years for Dow AgroSciences; previously with United Agriseeds and Dow Chemical Company. • Commitment to STEM outreach includes serving as secretary (2009-2013) and editor (2012-present) for 500 Earth Sciences, a community group engaged in science outreach throughout central Indiana. • Current treasurer, past president of Indiana Society of Paleontology; is leading efforts to choose a state fossil.\n\nHarry T. Armstrong (1986) - Harry T. Armstrong, Route 2, Springville and his son, Kent, operate a 1,800 acre hay-grass and livestock ranch in Lawrence County. They feed some 300 commercial cows and 200 yearlings. Armstrong attended both Purdue and Indiana Universities, and served in the Army Air Corps during World War II. Armstrong is a past president of the Indiana Cattlemen’s Association and the Indiana Livestock Breeders’ Association. He has served on the Lawrence County Extension Board, the County Fair Association board of directors, and the Stone City Bank of Bedford and the Bedford Medical Center boards of directors. Armstrong has also served on behalf of agriculture at the state and national levels. He is a member of the advisory committee for the Southern Indiana Purdue Agricultural Center, and the Dean of Agriculture’s advisory committee, and the Governor’s Rural Policy Commission. He also serves as a part-time agriculture representative on the staff of Senator Dan Quayle.\n\nMax Armstrong (2004) - Max Armstrong is one of the most widely recognized and highly regarded agriculture journalists in America. His broadcasts have been seen and heard by millions of farmers and consumers for nearly 30 years. As co-host of the nationally syndicated U.S. Farm Report television show, Max is seen each weekend on nearly 200 local television stations coast-to-coast. His tv broadcasts are also carried almost every day on the RFD-TV satellite channel via DirecTV and DishNetwork. From studios in Chicago, Max is heard daily with his agriculture and business news broadcasts on legendary radio powerhouse WGN. His Farming America reports are carried each day on radio stations in every region of the country. In pursuit of the news of agriculture, Max has originated broadcasts from every state in America and at least 30 nations. His work has earned dozens of honors from agriculture groups, trade associations, professional organizations and fraternities. He has been honored four times in the Oscar In Agriculture program for excellence in agriculture journalism. In addition to being recognized as Agriculture Communicator Of The Year by the National Agri-Marketing Association, Max was also presented the Master Writer recognition by the American Agricultural Editors Association. In 2001, he was given the Farm Broadcaster Of The Year Award by the National Association Of Farm Broadcasters. A year later he was recognized with the highest civilian honor given by the Governor of Indiana, the Sagamore Of The Wabash Award, presented by the late Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon. Max is also an honorary member of the Alpha Gamma Rho agriculture fraternity. A graduate of Purdue University, Max is proud of his Indiana roots, having grown up on a farm in Southern Indiana. He has maintained close ties with agriculture and often displays at parades, fairs and festivals the 1953 Farmall Super H tractor on which he learned to drive as a boy. Max and his dad's old tractor have been featured on calendars, videos, playing cards and collectible farm toys. Many of those items were donated or sold to benefit the 4H and FFA youth organizations. Since 1990 Max has contributed his time as a Fire Commissioner in the Western Suburbs of Chicago. In that role he hires and promotes firefighters and paramedics for the Lisle-Woodridge Fire Protection District, one of the highest rated fire districts in the United States. It is here where Max resides with his wife, Linda, and teen-age daughters Kristi and Lisa.\n\nRussell Arndt (1980) - The Ag Alumni office has no biographical information on this award winner.

Arnholt's passion for economic development has led to roles as the Vice-Chair of Education and Workforce Development committee of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce; Chair of Columbus Economic Development Board; Chair of the Columbus Enterprise Development Corporation and Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce Agribusiness Council. He has served as Chair for Hoosier Managers Association, on the board of the Farm Electrification Council, as Vice-Chair for Indiana FFA Foundation, and as a board member of Purdue's Alpha Kappa Lambda Fraternity. In 1987, Arnholt was elected to represent southeast Indiana on the board of the Purdue Ag Alumni Association, and he served that role for 13 years before serving as Vice President (2000-2002) and President (2002-2004). His philanthropic service has had wide-ranging impact on a number of organizations as well. Arnholt's extensive activity with the Community Foundation of Bartholomew County includes service to the Heritage Fund, serving as a member of the Board of Directors, and as chairman of the Grants and General Scholarship Selection Committees. In Bartholomew County, Arnholt has given leadership to the Heritage Fund Gifts of Grain program, with Sudan Farms being one of several farms participating. To support Agrllnstitute through the Community Foundation of Bartholomew County, Arnholt led an effort to raise funds in the county, which has resulted in $55,000 in contributions to the Agrllnstitute Endowment Fund of the Heritage Fund since 1987. Arnholt shared this success with other agricultural communities and led an effort to establish similar funds in other community foundations. To date, thirteen other endowment funds totaling $336,000 have been established in community foundations around the state to support Agrllnstitute. Arnholt's work has been recognized with several awards. In 2002 he received the Bartholomew County Rural Service Award. In 2008, the Rural Electric Association honored him with its Regional Award for Outstanding Service. In 201 O Sudan Farms was named Conservation Farm of th-e Year by the Bartholomew County Soil and Water Conservation District. And in 2014 the Heritage Fund of the Community Foundation of Bartholomew County presented Arnholt with its James A. Henderson Award.\n\nArthur E. Arnott (1959) - Arthur E. Arnott, Rensselaer, has carved a significant and a productive career through his singular devotion to agriculture. He has devoted his life to helping farmers. Born in Carroll County, he moved as a boy to Jasper County. He has held a Farm Bureau office, township, county, or state since 1919. He was Director of the Farm Bureau Third District from 1931 to 1958. He has served as manager of the Jasper County Farm Bureau Co-op since 1930. This is the largest cooperative of its kind in the entire country. He was a pioneer for the R. E. M. C. in his county. During the depression, he worked without pay in the Farm Debt Adjustment program. He has served on the Nation­al Advisory Committee of the Farm Credit Administration and is on the board of the Rural Acceptance Corporation. He is an active community worker, and is vitally interested in the churches and schools of his area. The constructive contributions of Arthur Arnott to his community and his state cannot be readily measured. His steady and visionary leadership have set him apart as a strong, responsible disciple of a modern agriculture.\n\nJanet S. Ayers (2017) - It is possible that rural Indiana has never had a better friend than Janet Ayres. She has conducted more than 2,000 workshops and trained 65,000 leaders and professionals in the areas of leadership and rural development. More than 200 Indiana communities have benefited from her efforts to develop leadership skills to deal with change and conflict. In 2012, she launched the Rural Issues series of Extension publications. The series features a set of factsheets on rural Indiana. Counties are grouped into three categories (rural, urban, and mixed) in order to analyze changes over the past decade, identify issues and highlight policy implications. Among the topics covered so far: Growth and decline, aging, poverty, poverty and teen childbearing, community banks, population trends, food insecurity and methamphetamine use. The series is a definitive source for legislators, scholars and others. “Through her many Extension programs … Dr. Ayres has improved the quality of life in rural Indiana,” wrote a colleague who nominated her for the Certificate of Distinction. “Her efforts have led to increased personal and professional networks of change agents with the skills and understanding of how individuals, groups and institutions change and strengthen.” The 1973 Purdue graduate earned a master’s degree in regional planning from Cornell University in 1975. She came back to Purdue in 1977 as a research associate and Extension specialist. After earning a Ph.D. in 1983, she joined the Agricultural Economics faculty as an assistant professor. She was promoted to associate professor in 1989 and became a full professor in 1995. In the 1990s, she spent six years as assistant director of Purdue Extension, led the Community Development Program, and established the Purdue Land Use Team — one of the first collaborative efforts between campus specialists and field educators — and the Leadership Development Team. From 2003 to 2008, she was a senior fellow with the North Central Regional Center for Rural Development as a 25 percent appointment. She produced the Foundations of Practice, which became one of the early online courses in community development. It led to the USDA/Rural Development’s community development online course. Extension educators and specialists have long benefited from Dr. Ayres’ focus on professional development. Her workshops at state park lodges around the state provided educational opportunities to learn about personal, interpersonal, group, and community leadership methods of engagement, forming “the foundation of Extension teams and collaborative efforts among staff to this day,” a nominator wrote. “The workshops led to many county leadership academics and youth programs which remain today.” Her off-campus accomplishments are considerable, and College of Agriculture undergraduates can attest to her on-campus impact. Those who took her “Leadership and Controversial Issues in Agriculture” class saw and heard her facilitate group discussions about sources of conflict, power, influence, and privilege. She also led the effort to establish and revise the College’s Leadership Development Certificate Program, which earned the Outstanding Program Award from the Association of Leadership Educators. Carroll County has been home for Dr. Ayres and her husband, Dr. Lynn Corson, since 1986. They restored a historic farm on the edge of Delphi. Janet led the Carroll County at the Crossroads efforts in 2004 and 2009, and co-created Carroll County Focus on the Future, Leadership Carroll County, and the Heritage Tourism group. She served on the Community Foundation board and is a member of the Land Use and Zoning Committee, Wabash & Erie Canal Association, Carroll County Historical Society, Delphi Preservation Society, the county Chamber of Commerce, and the Carroll County Ag Association. “Janet’s passion for community development, combined with her tireless commitment to develop and deliver programs and work with community leaders and groups, led to increased quality of life for individuals and communities throughout rural Indiana and beyond,” a nominator said. “She has a passion and an innate ability to relate to and inspire others,” wrote another nominator.

After World War II, Baldwin returned to the University of Wisconsin–Madison and became the founder and director emeritus of the Wisconsin Academy Foundation. He held positions as chair of the Department of Bacteriology, dean of the Graduate School, dean and director of the College of Agriculture, university vice president for academic affairs, and special assistant to the president. He was also involved in programs for agricultural development both in the United States and abroad.\n\nStanley A. Barber (1987) - Stanley A Barber, West Lafayette, a professor of agronomy at Purdue, was honored for his extensive research into soil fertility. A native of Wolseley, Saskatchewan, Canada, he earned B.S. and M.S. degrees at the University of Saskatchewan and a Ph.D. degree at the University of Missouri. He joined the Purdue faculty in 1949. He applied basic principles of chemistry, physics and biology to the study of plant-soil relationships. His research work has established him as an expert in soil fertility, plant nutrition and computer simulation models of how plants use nutrients. Well-known as an educator, Barber has supervised 55 graduate students and 21 postdoctoral scholars. He has published over 170 research publications and a book, “Soil Nutrient Bioavailability: A Mechanistic Approach.”\n\nJames Barnett (1996) - James Barnett is a respected advocate of, agriculture and conservation. His skill, diplomacy and common sense have prevailed when discussing such issues as wetlands and hazardous materials in front of the General Assembly and other groups. He helped develop the \"T by 2000\" erosion control plan, worked on the cooperative well testing project, and contributed to the 1994 Environmental Laws and Regulations Handbook. He has been unswerving in his support of education and was the driving force behind the Indiana Soil and Water Conservation Speech Contest. He also gave leadership to the Hoosier Chapter of Soil and Water Conservation Society scholarships. He has been an appointed to the Governor's Commission on Water Resources and Water Law, the Governor's Water and Mineral Resources Council, the state drought management plan, the Governor's Technical Committee on Drainage Issues, and the advisory committee to write the Forestry Best Management Handbook. He is also a member of the state wetlands management plan advisory committee. Barnett worked as a member of the Cooperative Extension Service (1955-1974) and then joined the Indiana Farm Bureau as an assistant in Natural Resources. He later took over as departmental director and became an active member of the Indiana Water Resources Assn. He is past president of the Hoosier Chapter of the Soil Conservation Society and a member of the International Soil Conservation Society. He delivered two research papers at Soil and Water Conservation Service national conference and co-authored the Indiana agricultural handbook, \"Nitrate and Pesticides in Private Wells of Indiana.\"\n\nMarion F. Baumgardner (2000) - During the past fifty years Marion Baumgardner has earned many titles, including: dedicated teacher, respected soil scientist, trusted mentor and committed servant. And while the research that undergirds his career has led him to be called “Dr. Remote Sensing” among his colleagues, the Purdue University community could well call him “Dr. Global Agriculture” for the legacy of international and cultural awareness that he has given to the campus and for the international collaborations and partnerships he has built during his journeys to more than 110 countries. Following his graduation from Texas Tech University in 1950, Baumgardner accepted a three-year appointment from the Methodist Board of Global Ministries to teach at the Allahabal Agricultural Institute in north India. When he returned to the U. S., he entered graduate school at Purdue. Baumgardner earned both his M.S. and Ph.D. from Purdue, in 1955 and 1964, respectively. Baumgardner served three years (1959-1962) as the director of the Indiana Soil Testing Lab at Purdue. In 1961 he was named an instructor in the Agronomy Department, and in 1964 he was appointed to the faculty of the department. During his 36 years as a teacher, the courses Baumgardner taught included Introductory Soils, Soil and Water Conservation, Intermediate Soil Science, Soil-Water-Air Contamination, Remote Sensing of Land Resources, and Global Awareness. Global Awareness, Agronomy 350, was initiated by Baumgardner and now draws more than 120 students each spring semester, students representing nearly all departmental disciplines at Purdue. In the early 1990's he chaired the Dean of Agriculture's committee which internationalized the curriculum for Purdue Agriculture students to better prepare them for the workplace of the 21st century. Baumgardner's first assignment as a Purdue faculty member was a two-year stint as a program specialist in Argentina. When he returned in 1966, he joined the research program of the Laboratory for the Applications of Remote Sensing (LARS). His primary research interest was the relationship among spectral properties of soils and their physical, chemical and biological characteristics, always seeking ways to use remote sensing to effectively map and monitor changes in soil and land resources from the local to the global scale. Close to home, Baumgardner has served his local United Methodist Church in many capacities. He recently led an effort to raise relief funds for Central American flood victims, and he retired in 1998 from 30 years of teaching an adult Bible class. A member of Lafayette Kiwanis Club since 1972, he served as club president (1983-1984) and recently co-chaired the local club's effort to raise $10,000 (at last count, the project had exceeded the goal by at least $3,000) for Kiwanis International's joint effort with UNICEF to eliminate iodine deficiency disorder, a major cause of mental retardation among 500 million of the world's most vulnerable children. He is also a member of the board of the Museums at Prophetstown, a 300 acre project within the new 3,000 acre Prophetstown State Park. He chairs the Museums' Prairie Restoration Committee that will restore about 200 acres to natural prairie grasses and wild flowers. Baumgardner's work has been recognized by his peers who have elected him a Fellow in the American Society of Agronomy, the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Soil Science Society of America and the Indiana Academy of Science. He has received honorary doctorate degrees from DePauw University, Greencastle, and G6d6ll6 Agricultural University in Hungary.\n\nBill R. Baumgardt (1998) - Researcher, animal scientist, administrator, agricultural spokesman and church leader. Bill Baumgardt has worn many hats during his career and worn them all with distinction and honor. After Feb.1, you can add the hat that says “retired.” Baumgardt is closing down a long and storied career. As associate dean and director of agricultural research programs at Purdue University, Baumgardt provided leadership to 272 faculty with research expenditures of $45.5 million. “As a scientist and administrator of people and public funds, he has always demonstrated the highest level of integrity and commitment to excellence,” says Edward L. Veenhuizen, past president of the Purdue Council on Agriculture, Extension and Teaching (PCARET). Baumgardt earned degrees from Purdue (B.S. 1955, M.S. 1956) and Rutgers (Ph.D. 1959). “Bill is a tireless, unselfish, state-of-the-art person,” says Jack L. Albright, of the Indiana Commission of Farm Animal Care. “He epitomizes what the Certificate of Distinction represents by recognizing service to Indiana and our nation’s agriculture above and beyond the call of duty.” Baumgardt came to Purdue from Penn State University, where he was professor of animal nutrition (1967-80), head of the department of dairy and animal science ((1970-75) and Associate Director of the agricultural research station and Associate Dean for Research (1979-80) “Bill has been a strong advocate for the land grant university system and its agricultural research and education programs,” says Charles R. Krueger, agronomy researcher at Penn State. “He has articulated convincingly the important role these programs have made to improving the agricultural industry of the United States for the benefit of all its citizens.” Baumgardt is a past president (1984-85) and director (1978-81) of the American Dairy Science Association. The group honored Baumgardt in 1993 with its Award of Honor and again in 1997 by naming him a Fellow of the Association. “Bill grew up on a dairy farm,” recalls H. L. Thacker, Director of the Purdue Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratories. “He has not forgotten his roots. He has shown remarkable dedication to honoring those roots through service to the agricultural community of this state.”\n\nE. W.

If you have information you are willing to share, please contact our office at (765) 494-8593.\n\nWilliam J. Beard (2011) - After graduating from Purdue University with a B.S. in Agricultural Economics, William Beard and his wife founded Beard Industries in Frankfort, IN. Originally, Beard Industries began as a distributor of Steckley’s Genetic Giant Hybrid seed corn and sold Steckley grain bins on the side. However, when grain bin sales exceeded the seed corn business, the Beards decided to concentrate on a sales line of independent grain dryers. With that decision, Beard Industries began to grow. In 1966 the factory was moved off the Beard farm and in 1968 the factory was expanded to accommodate the production of the Super-B Automatic Grain Dryers. In response to rising energy costs in the 1970’s, Beard Industries developed their own dryer, the Superb Energy Miser Dryer. In 1988 the Meyer Dryer was added and in 1997 the factory was expanded. The Superb Energy Miser Dryer and Meyer Dryer have been shipped throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico as well as to Ecuador, Venezuela, Russia, England, China, and Turkey, making Beard Industries a world-wide leader in grain dryer manufacturing. Bill has also provided his talents and generosity to various organizations within agriculture. He has been a member of the Clinton County Farm Bureau since 1950 and a member of the Indiana Association of Expert Swine Judges since 1940. He was named as an Agriculture Life Benefactor by the Purdue University Agriculture Dean’s Club and in 2003 was the Interim Director of Agriquest. Although Bill retired in 2002, he did not slow down. After his retirement he was elected as a County Commissioner for Clinton County. During his term he has been a leader on several different projects including a six million dollar sewer and water project for the town of Jefferson and sufficient improvement to the county EMA Program. He is presently serving his second term, continuing to provide leadership and sacrificing his time for his community. Bill and his wife were instrumental in bringing a YMCA to Clinton County, raising over four million dollars for the project. Bill now serves on the Board of Directors for the YMCA. Additionally he is an elder in the Frankfort First Christian Church, President of the Red Barn Summer Theatre Board of Directors, Chairman of the Clinton County Community Foundation Board of Directors, and President of the Frankfort Kiwanis.\n\nMichael A. Beard (2006) - Mike Beard owns and operates Meadowlane Farms, a diversified family farming enterprise in Clinton County that includes 1,000 acres of commercial grain production and a 30,000 head per year contract hog finishing operation. A graduate of Rossville High School, Beard received his B.S. degree in Agricultural Economics from Purdue University in 1968. Beard began farming in 1972, taking over his father’s dairy operation. In 1987 he sold the cows and transitioned to a 450-sow farrow-to-finish operation. Later he added a 4,000 head contract finishing unit, and in 2003 completely transitioned to contract finishing. He’s known as an excellent record keeper and analyst, and as an innovator in his farming practices. Beard fertilizes his 1,000-acres of cropland almost completely with manure, and, instead of using his grain only to feed the hogs, aggressively markets his crop to create another profit center in his operation. In 2002, Beard formed Meadowlane Waste Applications, a custom manure hauling and dragline application operation, in partnership with his son David and son-in-law Chris Pearson, who are also actively involved in the farming operations. Beard has been a leader in agricultural advocacy and policy activities, serving local, state and national organizations, including five years (1995 to 2000) on the Purdue Council for Agricultural Research, Extension and Teaching (P-CARET). As president of the Clinton County Farm Bureau since 1998 he has launched three major programs: Agstravaganza, a one-day educational expo that draws more than 1,000 people; Farm Education Conservation Camp, a two-day program that reaches all 4th grade students in Clinton County; and Farming the Courthouse, an educational program for officeholders and decision-makers. All three programs have been Indiana Farm Bureau (IFB) state program award winners, and Farming the Courthouse was recognized nationally in 2006 by the American Farm Bureau Federation. Beard has also served as president of the Clinton County Extension Board (1995-2000), the Indiana Pork Advocacy Coalition (2005), and has served on the boards of Ross Township (1993-2005), AgMax Cooperative (1995-2000), Livestock Services of Indiana (1995-2000), Indiana Pork Producers (2002-present), Clinton County Pork Producers (2002-present), Indiana Soybean Board (2004-present) and the Clinton County Soil & Water Conservation District (Associate Supervisor 2002-present). He is also a member of the newly created Indiana Odor Elimination Task Force and was elected to the Clinton County Council in 2004. He and wife Pam were selected to travel to Brazil in 2005 as IFB Agriculture Cultural Exchange (ACE) Ambassadors, and he traveled with Lt. Gov. Skillman’s agricultural trade mission to Central America in 2006. Since 1987 he has served East Side Christian Church in many roles from Sunday School teacher and superintendent to Deacon, Elder and Chairman of the Church Board. Beard’s honors include receiving the State Leadership Award from the American Milk Producers, Inc. in 1976, and the Dairy Award from Indiana Young Farmers in 1979. In 2002 he received Indiana Prairie Farmer’s Master Farmer Award.\n\nBeth Bechdol (2020) - With her recent appointment as deputy director general at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, Beth Bechdol continues her service to the agricultural industry — now on a global scale. “Beth is an inspiring leader, an excellent collaborator, a consummate professional and delivers tirelessly,” says Aaron Schacht, executive vice president of innovation/regulatory/ business development at Elanco Animal Health. Bechdol will lead a number of programs as well as a new office of innovation at the FAO, an agency focused on reducing world hunger and headquartered in Rome, Italy. For the past five years, Bechdol has been president and CEO of AgriNovus Indiana, the state’s initiative focused on advancing the Indiana agbioscience sector as a nationally recognized leader. “She has been an ideal partner and collaborator,” says Schacht, who is chair of the AgriNovus executive board. “I believe Beth’s hallmark service has been in the formation and leadership of AgriNovus Indiana,” says Greg Deason, senior vice president of entrepreneurship and place making, Purdue Research Foundation. “She worked to strengthen, align and connect people and resources in the agbiosciences. Her service to AgriNovus made an impact on Indiana and beyond.” Jay Hulbert, president and CEO of Ag Alumni Seed, says Bechdol assembled a diverse group of agribusinesses, state agencies, universities and non-governmental organizations to create an AgriNovus team and community devoted to promoting agbiosciences in Indiana. “Beth is an indispensable leader, building Indiana into a Midwest hub for ag startups and major businesses. Her work will keep Indiana at the forefront of agbioscience technology and business,” Hulbert says. “Her ability to take quick, effective tactical action while never losing sight of the larger strategic picture and keeping the diverse group that was her board moving in the same direction was awesome to behold.” Early in her career, Bechdol became the youngest and first female vice president at agribusiness consulting firm Sparks Companies and worked for the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee and the USDA’s Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services in Washington, D.C. In 2005, she and her family returned home to Indiana. That same year, the Indiana Legislature established the Indiana State Department of Agriculture as a separate state agency and Bechdol assumed the role of deputy director. Bechdol and her family currently live in her hometown of Auburn, where she continues to support Brechbill Farms, Inc., their seven-generation family farm. In her new role with the FAO, the Bechdols will relocate to Rome. Prior to her leadership of AgriNovus, Bechdol was director of agribusiness strategies at Indianapolis-based law firm Ice Miller LLP and also president of the Agribusiness Council of Indiana. Throughout her career, Bechdol has given her time to industry and community organizations, including currently serving on the board of directors of the Purdue Research Foundation, the Agricultural Alumni Seed Improvement Association, Inc., Conner Prairie and Indiana Humanities. One project Bechdol supported through the Indiana Humanities was Food for Thought, an award-winning program examining and celebrating the ways food helps to define Indiana’s culture. She helped bring state agriculture organizations to the table to partner in that effort. As part of the Purdue Research Foundation board of directors, Bechdol has worked to ensure the foundation and its key assets, such as Purdue Foundry and the Purdue Research Park network, are positioned to help advance ideas to impact, Deason says. “She recognizes the impact that Purdue has on the community and the world. She works tirelessly to remain engaged and active in the Purdue community and to find numerous ways to leverage the incredible assets of Purdue to fuel and further Indiana’s agriculture and biosciences economy.”\n\nTHIS AND THAT\n\nB.S., Foreign Service, International Relations and Law, Georgetown University, 1994; M.S., Agricultural Economics, Purdue, 1996.\n\nCurrently sits on Indiana State Fair Commission.\n\nPurdue University College of Agriculture Advisory Council, 2006-2009.\n\nPurdue University Distinguished Agriculture Alumna Award, 2009.\n\nServed on National FFA Sponsors Board (chair), National Grain and Feed Association, Farm Foundation Round Table and Community Harvest Food Bank of Northeastern Indiana.\n\nLawrence C.

They are active in Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Arcadia, Ind. Beck also is involved in the.Cicero (Ind.) Chamber of Commerce, the Arcadia Lions Club and the Hamilton Heights School Board.\n\nIsaac K. Beckes (1970) - In this time when being a university president is not one of the most enviable of professions; it is the pleasure of the Purdue Agricultural Alumni Association to confer our Certificate of Distinction on Dr. Isaac Beckes, President of Vincennes University. He steadfastly has maintained the philosophy that all those who earnestly desire to achieve an education should be provided the opportunity to do so. When he became president of Vincennes, it was a small struggling institution of less than 300 students. Today that same institution (although you would hardly recognize it) has enrollment exceeding 2800 pupils. Dr. Beckes led the community in an extensive program to improve facilities. Existing buildings were remodeled to meet University needs. New buildings were built. Equipment was added. What used to be a small trade school is now a well endowed, energetic, two-year university. Our particular reason for honoring Dr. Beckes is for his cooperation with the Purdue School of Agriculture in developing a two year program in agriculture at Vincennes. Almost 200 students are now enrolled in the program. Most all of them later transfer to Purdue to finish their work and have established an enviable record here. For his dedication to grass roots community education, and for his success in building a most useful University, we salute Dr. Isaac Beckes.\n\nK. E. Beeson (1961) - As drum major for the Purdue marching band, Agronomy Legend Keller Beeson mastered leadership lessons as a student that would serve him well in a 40-year career devoted to agriculture. Beeson first worked in sales, then seven years as a high school teacher and principal and two eradicating barberry. He joined the Purdue staff in 1924. He’s best known for teaching—through demonstrations, short courses, winter schools and published circulars—with lessons that focused on crop production. He rode the Purdue Soil Testing Special, a train that traveled the state. He reviewed soil samples farmers brought to him for recommendations on lime, fertilizer and crop rotation. He also directed corn and soybean yield contests at state grain and seed shows. Beeson was involved in the seed certification program from 1924 to 1962. He helped found the American Soybean Association. And he served as a 4-H club leader.\n\nWilliam M. Beeson (1976) - William “Mac” Beeson, West Lafayette, Indiana, is considered “Mr. Animal Nutrition” by his fellow animal scientists. He is recognized as one of the nation's leaders in nutrition as it applies to beef cattle, sheep, and swine. He has authored or co-authored 136 scientific papers and over 400 technical and popular articles on the subject. Those of us who had him in animal nutrition while in college remember him to be a concise, thorough, and factual teacher whose excellence in the classroom can be excelled only by his expertise as an animal researcher. Dr. Beeson's contributions to animal nutrition are so numerous that we cannot possibly list them all here. So, here are only a few of his most significant accomplishments;\n\nPurdue Supplement A for beef cattle was developed by Dr. Beeson and must be considered one of the most significant developments by a Purdue researcher.\n\nThe need for the addition of vitamin A to certain beef cattle rations was demonstrated by him.\n\nDr. Beeson and colleague F. N. Andrews pioneered the use of stilbestrol implants as a beef cattle growth stimulant.\n\nHe performed extensive research in the safe use of urea in beef cattle supplements.\n\nMac and his co-workers revealed the increased nutritive value of high moisture corn.\n\nHe has led research on a great variety of experiments concerning antibiotics as they effect beef cattle.\n\nDr. Beeson graduated from Oklahoma A. & M. in 1931, and received his Masters and Doctors degrees from the University of Wisconsin. He was on the faculties of Texas A. & M., the University of Idaho, and the University of Arizona before joining Purdue in 1945. He now holds the position of Lynn Distinguished Professor of Agriculture in the Purdue Animal Sciences Department. He is a member of a great many scientific and professional societies, among them, Sigma Xi, Phi Sigma, Phi Kappa Phi, the American Society of Animal Science, the American Institute of Nutrition, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is a member of and has served as national president of the American Society of Animal Production. The scientific and educational accomplishments of Mac Beeson are magnified thousands, in fact, millions of times in their end result. For every farmer who feeds livestock, Dr. Beeson has improved his efficiency, and his opportunity for profit. For every consumer, a higher quality product at a more reasonable price can very well be attributed in some considerable part to the work of Dr. Mac Beeson. We salute you, Dr. Beeson, with this Certificate of Distinction.\n\nJames N. BeMiller (2004) - James BeMiller began a distinguished career at Purdue University when he received his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. all in Biochemistry. Upon graduation he went on to teach at Southern Illinois University for 25 years. However, he could not stay away from his alma mater. For the past 17 years he has been a Professor of Food Science at Purdue and the Director of the Whistler Center for Carbohydrate Research. At the beginning of his career BeMiller studied alkaline degradation in polysaccharides. This work was instrumental in wood pulping to prevent losses of pulp and polluting of rivers. Additionally, alkaline degradation is important for modifications in cellulose and starch which is very influential in the alternative fuels industry. BeMiller’s research has also been used to improve starch’s use in the food, pharmaceutical, paper, and building industries. As Director of the Whistler Center for Carbohydrate Research, Dr. BeMiller has made carbohydrate emphasis a distinguished area for the Department of Food Science. One aspect of Dr. BeMiller’s career that cannot be omitted is the number of students that appreciate the role he has played in shaping them to be scientists. Dr. BeMiller has been very involved outside the classroom as well. He has been a member and officer of the American Chemical Society, the American Association of Cereal Chemists, Institute of Food Technologists, American Institute of Chemists, and the International Union of Biochemistry. In his local community he has been on the Board of Directors for the Purdue Alumni Assoc., Chairman of various committees within Boy Scouts of America, and an Executive Board Member of the Lutheran Church in America. He has been extensively honored for his work. He was named the Outstanding Teacher at SIUU in 1982 and 1983. He was also awarded with the Research Award of Merit by Gamma Sigma Delta in 1993 and the Andrew Jackson Moyer Lectureship by the USDA in 1999.\n\nH. S. Benson (1938) - The Ag Alumni office has no biographical information on this award winner. If you have information you are willing to share, please contact our office at (765) 494-8593.\n\nRobert L. Benson (2000) - For more than 40 years, Bob Benson has worked in the agricultural industry, both as a respected professional and, perhaps more importantly, as a tireless volunteer, taking on leadership roles for the benefit of several different sectors of agriculture. Purdue weed science professor Thomas Bauman says of Benson, “I consider him to be one of the best agricultural ambassadors that I know.” After graduating from the Ohio State University in 1956 with a B.S. in Agricultural Education, Benson spent 8 years as a county extension agent in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. From 1964 until 1991, he worked for the Monsanto Agricultural Company, retiring as a Senior Development Associate in Product Development and an Environmental Affairs Specialist / Field Sales. Currently he serves as Director of the Indiana Grain Buyers and Warehouse Licensing Agency. During his career with Monsanto, Benson was a leader in the Indiana Plant Food and Agricultural Chemicals Association (IPFACA), servIng as both Chairman of the Board (1989) and as Treasurer (1990-1993), and in the North Central Weed Control Conference, where he was president from 1982-1983 and was named an honorary member in 1988. During his service to IPFACA, he led the effort to establish the Crop Diagnostic Training and Research Center at Purdue. Cresswell Hizer, IPFACA President and CEO, says of Benson's leadership, “He led the industry into a new era of environmental stewardship via his work in product storage and containment that protects the environment today.” In recent years, Benson has devoted his efforts to the Indiana and U.S. sheep industry. He has served the Indiana Sheep Breeders Association as President, Vice-President and Treasurer and has been Indiana's representative on the board of directors of the American Sheep Industry Association, where he has served on the Legislative Action Council. Closer to home, Benson serves as the ring announcer for the Indiana State Fair Sheep Department and works with loca14-H exhibitors as a director of the Hamilton County Sheep Producers. Benson's service to the sheep industry has earned him a Sagamore of the Wabash citation. Benson's service to his community is also exemplary and transcends the boundaries of agriculture. He has served his church, Christ United Methodist, as finance chairman and as a trustee. Currently he is a member of the Indianapolis East District Finance Committee. A 27-year member of Lions International, he has served his local club in every office, was District Governor (1983-1984) and was named a Melvin Jones Fellow, Lions International's highest award.\n\nD. William Biddle (2014) - Bill Biddle is a native of Benton County, Indiana, and graduated from Purdue in 1964 with a B.S. in agricultural economics. Following graduation, Biddle served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army from 1965 to 1967, including one year in Vietnam. In 1968, he returned home and joined his father in Biddle Farms. Late that year, upon his father's untimely death, he became the owner and manager of the family's farming operation and the fourth generation of his family to farm in Benton County. In 1970, he founded Biddle Seeds, Inc., and began a career-long engagement with the seed industry. In 1986, he expanded the family's business interests with the founding of Biddle Insurance Service, Inc. Biddle has an extensive record of leadership in Indiana agriculture and in the seed industry, prompting one nominator to write, \"this award was designed to recognize men like Bill Biddle:' He is a graduate of the first class of the Indiana Agricultural Leadership Program, and from 1985 to 1986 he served as the second chairman of the program's sponsoring organization, the newly formed Indiana Institute of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition. He was a charter board member of the Public Varieties of Indiana program, which promotes certified public varieties. He served on numerous committees of the Indiana Crop Improvement Association (!CIA) over more than 40 years of service, and held leadership roles that included 27 years on the board of directors (1978-81 and 1985-2009). He was a member of the board of directors of the Indiana Seed Trade Association (ISTA) from 1982-86. In 1986 he served as president of both !CIA and ISTA. During more than a decade of service to the American Soybean Association (1970-1981 ), he served as secretary and as treasurer, and he was part of the ASA Trade Committee that visited China and Japan in 1980. He is a longtime leader of the Ag Alumni Seed Improvement Association, the foundation seed company of the Purdue College of Agriculture that is affiliated with the Purdue Ag Alumni Association, Inc. Since 1980 he has been a member of the board of directors of Ag Alumni Seed, and since 1988 he has served as president/chairman of the board. Since 1990 he has served on the board of directors for Indiana Farmers Mutual Insurance Company. Biddle's service and leadership extends to his church and community as well. He is a former president of the Purdue Acacia Fraternity Building Association. He is a former member of the Benton County Extension Board and the Advisory Board of Gilboa Township. From 1992 to 1998 he served on the Tri-County School Corporation Board. And for 30 years, from 1969 to 1999, he was Clerk of the Session for the First Presbyterian Church in Remington, where he was also a longtime member of the church choir. His community memberships also included the Remington American Legion and the Remington Masonic Lodge. In 1982, Biddle's seed farming operation was chosen to host the Indiana Farm ManagementTour. Biddle's honors include the Indiana Crop Improvement Association's Crops and Soils Merit Award (1994) and being named a Distinguished Agriculture Alumnus of the Purdue College of Agriculture (2000).\n\nChester B. Biddle (1956) - Chester B. Biddle, Remington, Indiana, graduated from the Purdue School of Agriculture in 1924. Since his gradua­tion, he has farmed an extensive acre­age in Benton County. This has been a highly successful operation, special­izing in the production of certified seed, hybrid corn, and Aberdeen-Angus cattle. He has served his local community un­selfishly, and has long been an inspir­ing force for progress. He is a pro­minent churchman. He has taught a Sunday School class of young people for many years, and has helped organ­ize a church affiliated Youth Club de­signed to provide wholesome recreation for young people in a rural community. He has provided th.e leadership that has, for the last 30 years, made the Remington Soybean Day one of the out­standing events in Indiana agriculture. He has served as President and Dir­ector of the Purdue Agricultural Alumni Association, as Director of the Agri­cultural Alumni Seed Improvement Asso­ciation, as President and Director of the American Soybean Association as Vice-President, President, and Director of the Purdue General Alumni Association. His extraordinary willingness to serve the ideals and interests of agriculture in the face of his farm, seed, and in­surance operations truly indicates that he has served beyond the call of duty.\n\nDonald J. Biehle (2017) - In 1977, the State of Indiana transferred 900 acres in Jennings County to Purdue University. The brand-new Southeast Purdue Agricultural Center needed a superintendent. The ink was barely dry on Don Biehle’s bachelor’s degree in Agricultural Economics, but the Purdue University graduate — and Jennings County native — got the job. He stayed 39 years. Biehle retired in June 2016. During his tenure SEPAC expanded to more than 2,400 acres, and in 2015 an estimated 64 research projects were underway, involving more than 50 researchers, graduate students, Extension educators, and industry collaborators. That year nearly 1,150 people attended more than 30 Extension education programs at a research center that is widely regarded as efficient, effective, and impactful. So clearly Don Biehle knew what he was doing. How he did it was impressive, too. “Don demonstrated how to run an operation, work with campus and state Extension staff, develop ideas into plans that will benefit producers in the area — and how to be a true and honest human being,” said Jason Tower, who supervises the Southern Indiana Purdue Agricultural Center (SIPAC) in Dubois County. “As a young superintendent, he taught me how to lead and make suggestions to folks in a way that gets ideas across and accomplished, without being overbearing.” A nominator for the Certificate of Distinction said Biehle’s “collaborative and supportive nature, plus his ‘can-do’ attitude, greatly enhanced researchers’ abilities to conduct practical agricultural research. His insight and knowledge of local agricultural concerns provided researchers with focus and helped ensure that research results were applicable to growers and input providers through southeast Indiana.” Eileen Kladivko, a professor in Purdue’s Department of Agronomy, has conducted a considerable amount of applied crop production research at SEPAC. She recalls Biehle going “out of his way, on a regular basis, to make our research work there more productive and easier to accomplish. He and his staff have helped us flesh out crazy ideas so that we could test out something new. Over the past 30 years, many times Don went the extra mile to help me or my graduate students accomplish an experiment in the late hours, Saturdays, or under other unusual circumstances. SEPAC has grown into a model of integration of research and Extension in our state.” Installation of soil drainage systems, development of no-till crop production techniques, development of wetlands for wildlife and fire protection, adoption of precision technologies for field research, and automated weather stations are among the innovations that Don encouraged and supported at SEPAC. Jennings County is also home to MUTC — the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, operated by the Indiana National Guard. In fact, MUTC and SEPAC are next-door neighbors, and Don Biehle was instrumental in developing a partnership: A land/feed exchange program that provides grain for MUTC animals, educational support for agricultural development teams readying for deployment to Afghanistan, and the use of various SEPAC sites for training exercises. Maj. Stephen Spencer, MUTC’s deputy base operations manager, said Biehle helped replicate an “agrarian city in a failed state” that is used to train “war fighters, peacekeepers, emergency responders, and diplomats for the ever-changing challenges in a world of persistent conflict. The education he provides and flexibility he offers to MUTC has worldwide implications for soldiers and civilians going into harm’s way.” Creating (and seizing) opportunities, thinking ahead, going the extra mile — those are hallmarks of good managers. John Poehlmann, a retired assistant director of the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station, saw it firsthand years ago during discussions with fellow members of Division A-7 (Agricultural Research Management) of the American Society of Agronomy. “Most of us were debating how GPS, yield monitoring and similar technology might have a positive effect,” Poehlmann recalled. “Don was presenting results of how this system was already returning new information to himself and the scientists working at his station.”\n\nWorks with the Jennings County Growers Co-op to teach farmers how to use high-tunnel technologies.\n\nA township fire department member for 34 years (chief, grant writer, president, secretary, treasurer).

Bishea (1967) - As far as Southeastern Indiana is concerned, Albert M. “Bish” Bishea, Evans­ville, is Mr. County Agent, Mr. Agriculture, and Mr. Purdue. Born in Batesville, Indiana in 1900, he received his B.S. Degree from Purdue in 1923. After being awarded a Masters Degree from Indiana State Teachers College, he taught vocational agriculture at Switz City and Elnora. In 1934 “Bish” became County Agent in Daviess County. In 1939, he was hired as Agriculture Agent for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, a position he held till he was appointed County Agent in Vanderburgh County. In Vanderburgh County, Al Bishea has been a pioneer in the development of a cooperative climate between city and country. He developed and promoted many community action programs. He has been a leader in radio and television coverage for the “Pocket” area. He spearheaded the development of one of the finest 4-H grounds in the Midwest. In addition to his professional pursuits, Mr. Bishea has been one of Evans­ville's civic leaders. His qualities of leadership have been unselfishly given to his fellow Extension Agents, too. Dozens of younger agents have turned to him for counsel and advice. As far as Ag Alumni is concerned, he has been steadfast in his loyalty to the Association and to the purposes it pursues. On that basis, and for many others, we are proud to give Al Bishea the Certificate of Distinction.\n\nO. T. ''Ted'' Blank (1977) - You will find good farmers in most every neighborhood in Indiana. Likewise, you can find a lot of dedicated community workers out there. It's a rare combination when you can find all those good qualities in one person. O. T. ''Ted'' Blank is just such a person. Raised most of his life on a farm northwest of Logansport, Indiana, Ted attended the Purdue School of Agriculture. He returned to the home farm and, along with his Father, de­veloped an outstanding herd of Chester White swine. He served as National Chairman of the Chester Wh ite Swine Record Association, and is past president of the I ndiana Livestock Breeders Association. In 1973, his portrait was hung in the Livestock Hall of Fame at Purdue University. From 1958 to 1966, Ted was a member of the Indiana State Fair Board, and served as its chairman in 1966. Cass County has an outstanding 4-H Fair, and Ted Blank was a leader in the development of the excellent facilities at their new location. His influence is felt in other ways. Ted was chairman of the Logansport YM-YWCA Board in 1967-70, and continues as an active member of that Board. He also is a member of the Board of Directors of the National Bank of Logansport. For eight years, Ted was a member of the Cass County Republican Central Committee, and served as its chairman for two years. In 1975, Ted Blank was chosen as one of four former 4-Hers to receive the Indiana 4-H Alumni Award. This past year, he was one of eight people in the country to receive the National 4-H Alumni Award. Only four Hoosiers have received that honor in the past twenty-five years. Ted Blank, you are a credit to your profession, and we salute you with this Certificate of Distinction.\n\nLawrence P. Bohl (1999) - “Elite teacher” and “superb Counselor” are two descriptions that Purdue faculty uses time and again to describe Larry Bohl. But Bohl's many career achievements are best captured in the words of a former student who said “He has truly given a big part of his life to see that students are successful.” Since 1970 Bohl has been a faculty member in the Department of Agricultural Economics. For almost 30 year he has taught multiple sections of an introductory agricultural economic course that is taken by most freshmen in the School of Agriculture. And for the past 20 years he has been the head undergraduate counselor for the school's largest undergrad pro gram, Agricultural Economics. All told Bohl has taught and counseled more than 10,000 students in a school that only has about 30,000 living alumni. No matter how many students passel through his door, Bohl clearly took time to get to know them and help them formulate academic plans and career paths to best serve their objectives. One former student said, “He remember your name, no matter how long ago it was you knew him.” “Among Purdue Agriculture's good teachers, Larry is clearly one of the best. He is a champion of the cause of quality teaching,” said Lowell Hardin: professor emeritus and former department head of agricultural economics. Bohl's service to students has taken many forms outside the classroom. He has served as an advisor to the Agricul­tural Economics and National Agri-marketing Association student clubs, and he has served as a faculty fellow at Vawter Hall for many years. Bohl graduated from Montana State University in 1953. He earned both his master's and doctoral degrees from Purdue, in 1967 and 1971, respectively. He has received many honors for his dedication and service. Purdue has awarded him the Amoco Outstanding Teaching Award and the Omicron Delta Kappa Award for Outstanding Coun­selor. He has been named the School of Agriculture’s Outstanding Teacher in 1978 and it’s Outstanding Counselor in 1984. The American Agricultural Eco­nomics Association presented him its Outstanding Teacher Award twice dur­ing his career, first in the “less than 10 years experience” category and later in the “more than 10 years experience.” In 1996 Indiana Farm Bureau, Inc. awarded Bohl the Frederick L. Hovde Award of Excellence for educational service to the rural people of Indiana. The Purdue Alumni Association in 1998 recognized him with the Special Boilermaker Award for making a difference in the lives of a significant number of Purdue students. “Professor Larry Bohl is a superb rep­resentative of the elite group of teachers and counselors,” said Richard Kohls, professor and dean emeritus. “To thousands of Purdue Age, Larry Bohl is the Purdue they know and support.”\n\nJohn H. Bone (1969) - We're celebrating two Centennials this year. One is for Purdue University for its 100 years of service to people. The other is for John H. Bone, Lafayette, for nearly 100 years of loyalty to the agricultural profession. Born on June 19, 1869, Mr. Bone graduated from Ohio State University in 1893. In 1896, he became Assistant to the President and Director of the Agri­cultural Experiment Station at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Oklahoma A & 1). In 1900, he started farming in Tippecanoe County, Indiana. For many years, he was a Farmers Institute speaker. He is a charter member of the Indiana Farm Bureau and, in 1920, attended the Purdue Winter Short Course. In 1938, he became the first president of the Tipmont R.E.M.C. For 16 years, Mr. Bone was a director of the Indiana Wool Growers Association. He is a life member of the Indiana Corn Growers Association. In 1963, he received the “Outstanding Corriedale Sheep Breeder of the Year” award from the American Corriedale association. The ultimate goal of every person is to achieve a long life well lived. J. H. Bone has achieved a full measure of both and has, in turn, converted his many years and extraordinary talent to the good of his profession and his fellow man. We salute you, sir.\n\nRalph E. Booker (2016) - Ralph Booker is a native of Plymouth, Indiana. He graduated from Purdue University in 1971 with a B.S. in agricultural economics, and later earned his M.S. of public administration in 1983 from Indiana University. He began his career as 4-H Extension Educator in 1973 in Parke County, a role he maintained until 1977 when he became County Extension Director in Brown County, Indiana. In 1988, Booker was named County Extension Director of Marshall County, Indiana, the position from which he retired in 2003. Since retiring from Purdue Extension, Booker has continued his community service as the Marshall County Plan Director and Zoning Administrator/Plymouth Plan Consultant. Booker served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1972 through 1999, retiring as Lieutenant Colonel. As a Purdue Extension educator, Booker was responsible for a considerable number of successful ventures that significantly benefitted the counties that he served. While in Brown County, he developed and administered the county budget, developed and conducted the county agriculture education program, and secured funds to start the first county park. Booker also developed the county’s fairgrounds, upgrading from a single outdoor livestock arena to a new livestock facility, 4-H and open class building, and a new Extension office. His contributions to Marshall County during his time as County Extension Director were particularly noteworthy. In 1990, he started the Ag Day Program for third grade students within the county, a model that is used by many counties across the state to educate elementary school students about agriculture and food production. Booker has also been instrumental in securing multiple grants, and utilizing them to improve the county as a whole. A National Science Foundation grant was secured to provide the first free internet access in Marshall County to over 800 clients. Additionally, he served on a committee that secured a $5M grant from the Lilly Foundation that was used by the Marshall County Community Foundation for a broad community initiative that started Crossroads Academy, a technical education center; Heart and Hands, a non-profit organization to teach English as a Second Language (ESL), and ultimately other classes serving the Latino community; and childcare training at Ancilla College, where he also taught a basic agriculture course. Booker supervised the coordination of Crossroads Academy, and hired and supervised its first director. This academy is a center dedicated to serving the residents of Marshall County, and hosts classes for high school and college students as well as adults for the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) designation, along with other computer applications. Booker managed all of this while also being responsible for supervising four Extension program areas, which include 4-H and Youth, Consumer and Family Sciences, Agriculture, and Leadership and Community Development. One nominator summarized his view of Booker in his letter of support, “Ralph is, in my view, the consummate professional in anything he undertakes.” Booker has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to providing educational and training opportunities to every stakeholder group he has served. From teaching the Dairy Option Pilot Program for USDA and starting the Dairy Excel Management Course, to his class on QuickBooks at the Crossroads Academy, it is evident that he believes in the importance of agricultural education as well as technology, and is a strong advocate of lifelong learning. After retiring from his career in Extension, from October 2004 to July 2005 Booker served as the Marshall County Public Health Coordinator. His responsibility in this position involved writing the Mass Prophylaxis Plan for the county, which is a plan to treat all healthy individuals in the event of a massive disease or bio-terrorism outbreak. From 2004 until 2012, he served two terms as a Marshall County Councilman. Booker currently holds a position as Marshall County Plan Director and Zoning Administrator/Plymouth Plan Consultant, and played a crucial role in completing the county comprehensive plan and updating county zoning ordinances. His expertise has even led him outside of the county to assist other communities with updating their comprehensive plans and ordinances, answering questions and advising them on zoning. Booker continues his commitment to technology and education by serving on the Marshall County Technology Squared committee, which is an agriculture and technology economic development initiative that promotes job creation. He also chairs the Marshall County Life Long Learning network. Booker has served in many state and national leadership roles. He served as the President of the Agriculture Section of the Indiana Extension Agents Association (IEAA) from 1992-1993, and as IEAA President from 1996-1997. In 2000, Booker served as Agricultural Economics National Chair of the National Association of County Agricultural Agents. He served as the Plymouth Rotary Club President from 1994-1995, and is currently still involved in the local club, representing agriculture interests. Booker has been recognized with numerous awards, including the IEAA Innovator Award in 1996, the National Association of County Agricultural Agents Distinguished Service Award in 2000, and the Beck's Hybrids Beyond the Fence Award for Public Official of the Year in 2007.\n\nPhillip E. Boring (2012) - A native of Shelby County, IN, Phillip Boring received a B.S. degree in General Agriculture from Purdue University in 1961. Following graduation, he served in the U. S. Army. He returned home in December of 1962 and joined his father in the family farming operation, a portion of which has been continuously owned by the family since 1852. Today he is the president of Boring Farms, Inc. and LOI Farms, Inc. Boring grew the farm from 550 acres of crops and a 50-sow operation that marketed about 500 hogs per year to 3100 crop acres and a hog operation that during its peak in the 1990s consisted of 500 sows and marketed 8,000 to 10,000 hogs per year. Boring has been an innovator with his farming operations. His was one of the earliest family farms in Indiana to incorporate. He has innovated with new and non-traditional crops such as cucumbers and canola, as well as tomatoes and popcorn, which he is still growing along with corn, soybeans and wheat. Boring has been invited to serve on numerous national panels and symposia boards on topics ranging from pork production to farm business transition and estate planning. Boring’s farm operation has played a pivotal role in his public service activities. Each year from 1997 to 2003, he and his wife Janice hosted senior diplomats from the United States State Department for a farm stay of several days during their stateside training to learn about agricultural production and policy. The Borings’ have hosted many state and national delegations on tours of their farm, as well as international farmers and visitors, including Bernard Vernier-Paillez, France’s Ambassador to the United States. Their farm hosted Farm Fest in 1994 and was featured on the Indiana Farm Management Tour in 1978. Boring has been both a member and a leader in numerous agricultural organizations, including: Indiana Young Farmers Association (1960-1980); Shelby County Pork Producers Association (member and past president, 1960s-2000); International Flying Farmers (member 1965-2000; Indiana Chapter President 1967-1969; Chair of IFF convention held in Lafayette in 1975); Indiana Farm Policy Study Group (pre 1976 – present); Shelby County Co-op (Director, 1995-present); Red Gold Grower Action Fund Board (member and past chairman, mid 1990s-2009); Indiana Farm Management Association (President, 1981; Director At-large, 1982; Member of General Planning Committee for the Farm Management Tour, 1980 and 1982). Boring plays tenor and baritone saxophone in the Shelby County Community Band, Greenfield Community Band, Brandywine Wind Jazz Band and the Dixie Kats. These bands share their love of music at free concerts and numerous festivals, parades and other public events. He also entertains as a soloist at senior communities in Shelbyville every month. Boring’s community service has also included four years on the Shelby County Northwestern School Board (1972-1976), during which he campaigned for, and got approval for, building a new middle school and hired the architect to design the project. He also promoted and helped implement a trial period of year-round school, an innovative idea for that time. Boring has been a member of Carrollton United Methodist Church for more than 50 years, where he has taught Sunday School, served on the Board of Trustees and on numerous committees and other offices. Boring was named a Master Farmer by Indiana Prairie Farmer magazine in 1983. He received Red Gold’s Master Grower Award in 1998 and 2001. And in 2007 the Mid-America Food Processors awarded him its Roman R. Romanowski Award for contributions and excellence in the Midwest vegetable industry.\n\nJ. Carroll Bottum (1965) - Professor Bottum's keen ability to apply the problem solving process to public policy issues, and to communicate the results to others earned him a national reputation and respect.
