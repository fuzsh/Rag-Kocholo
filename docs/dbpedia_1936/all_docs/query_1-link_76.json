Auriel is currently a law student at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nREFLECTIONS FROM ATHENA\n\nDear Corps Members, Alumni, Students, Families, Partners, Supporters, and Staff,\n\nIt’s incredible to think back to that blisteringly hot summer day when Teach For America – Memphis officially\n\nlaunched in June 2006. We began with 48 charter corps members, a handful of local alumni, and a staff of four.\n\nWe had been welcomed to this community by bold, visionary folks like then Memphis City Schools’ superintendent\n\nDr. Carol Johnson, and local philanthropists Barbara and Pitt Hyde. While there may have been little momentum\n\ncity-wide for education at the time, this daring and forward-thinking collective was committed to proving what we\n\nalready believed to be true: students in low-income schools across Memphis can achieve at high academic levels\n\nand will flourish when given the opportunities they deserve to attain happiness and success in life.\n\nFast forward to today, when nearly 300 corps members are following in the footsteps of the 1,500 Teach For\n\nAmerica alumni who have contributed to improving public education in Memphis over the past ten years. Not only\n\nhave we inspired hundreds of talented individuals to commit to careers in the classroom, we now count 23 school\n\nleaders and 4 school system leaders among our local alumni. More than 80% of our local alumni work full-time in\n\neducation. Many others continue to advocate for equity as they pursue careers in law, healthcare, and business.\n\nSeveral have even started their own organizations to serve our students’ needs directly. Though a disparity in\n\nacademic achievement persists between students in our city’s low-income communities and those with greater\n\nadvantages, Memphis was nationally recognized in a study that found that, between 2011 and 2014, the city had\n\nclosed this gap by nearly 20 percent1. Memphis students now have multiple educational options including Shelby\n\nCounty Schools, the Achievement School District, and the expanding constellation of charter schools across the\n\nregion. Shelby County Schools has been recognized across the country for its progressive approach to improving\n\neducational outcomes for all students thanks to the creation of its Innovation Zone (iZone) schools. Freedom\n\nPreparatory Academy’s first class of sixth-graders just graduated high school, and the Soulsville Charter School\n\nhas boasted a 100% college acceptance rate for graduating seniors since it was founded in 2005. These are just\n\nsome of the stories that make us proud of our role in recruiting, training, and developing incredible leaders who\n\nhave helped so many local institutions accomplish so much in the past decade.\n\nAs we reflect on all that Teach For America has helped contribute to the dramatic improvements not just in\n\nMemphis, but in the state of Tennessee, we’re humbled by our integral role and even more determined to see\n\nthese efforts through to fruition. We invite you to join us in celebrating what you have helped make possible and\n\nhope you enjoy reading our “Decade in Review”.\n\nOne day, all kids in Memphis will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education. We could not have come\n\nthis far without your support and commitment, and we are counting on you to continue the fight for educational\n\nequity.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nAthena Palmer (Memphis ‘06)\n\nExecutive Director\n\nTeach For America - Memphis\n\n1 Education Equality in America: Comparing the Achievement Gap Across Schools, Cities, and States, Educational Equality Index, 2016\n\nTHE TFA MEMPHIS MODEL\n\nRashad Riley (Memphis ‘13) leading students through a math lesson. Rashad currently serves as a dean at Freedom\n\nPreparatory Academy.\n\nTHE TFA - MEMPHIS MODEL\n\nMemphis has made tremendous strides as a community battling educational Despite the efforts\n\ninequity. We have rallied a broad range of stakeholders and adopted nearly every of so many, Memphis\n\ntactic that has seen success in cities across the country. From more rigorous\n\nteacher evaluations to more innovative schools, our landscape is reflective of the kids are still not\n\nvery best thinking and most ambitious education reform efforts across the United positioned for success\n\nStates. Memphis has achieved a critical mass of families, educators, partners, and\n\nsupporters willing to push a bold agenda forward. And yet, our kids are still not in 31%\n\na position to access opportunities and realize their dreams as they deserve.\n\nMemphis kindergarteners\n\nAn enormous challenge facing students today is that our education system is still are reading on grade level.\n\nmore closely aligned to the economic needs of the past than to the global and\n\ndigital economic realities of the present. Most students are held to an academic 39%\n\nstandard that, at best, minimally prepares them for jobs that are quickly vanishing. It\n\nis altogether inadequate for career paths that are growing increasingly competitive. Memphis third graders\n\nReimagining how to educate an entire generation is a monumentally complex task, are proficient in reading.\n\nand Teach For America has spent the past decade developing a leadership force\n\nthat is willing and able to take on this work.\n\nSince 2006, Teach For America has worked tirelessly to eliminate educational 38%\n\ninequity for kids in Memphis. Though the systems currently in place—both in\n\nMemphis and around our country—have failed too many kids for too long, Teach Memphis seventh graders\n\nFor America has played a significant role in ensuring that our local educational are proficient in reading.\n\nlandscape is inching ever closer to a day when all children will have access to an\n\nexcellent education.\n\nOur mission is to find, develop, and support a diverse network of leaders who\n\nexpand opportunity for children in Memphis from every possible angle.\n\nFrom classrooms and schools, to each sector and field shaping the broader systems in which schools operate,\n\nour people are extraordinary individuals unified by their desire to effect lasting change for kids in low-income\n\ncommunities. Year after year, with each new corps member we recruit and each group of alumni that spearheads\n\nthe charge for a new generation, Teach For America has built a diverse and effective force of exceptional leaders\n\ndedicated to ensuring Memphis will become the best version of itself.\n\nCHOOSE901, AUG. 23, 2017 “Tennessee set an ambitious goal:\n\nbecome the fastest improving\n\n“They say the most state in the country in education.\n\nimportant question Teach For America was a talent\n\nto ask yourself engine - scoring at the top of\n\nbefore joining Teach state rankings for teacher prep\n\nFor America is ‘what programs, placing in the highest\n\nis your why?’ I came need schools, and funneling talented leaders\n\nto realize that my ‘why’ was myself; into administrative roles.

Understanding that the path to a different reality\n\nwould require the concerted effort of a broad and diverse coalition, we evolved our program to encompass the\n\nskills required to build just that. We placed an even greater emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion across\n\nour programming spectrum. We prioritized building our corps members’ cultural competence and engaged them\n\nmore deeply in the way racism, classism, and privilege have shaped our society. We pushed them to reflect on how\n\ntheir identities impact the way they experience the world and heightened their awareness of how they interact\n\nwith others.

We recognize that, in addition to excellent academic results and\n\ncultural competence, success in the 21st century requires a sophisticated understanding of our increasingly\n\ncomplex world. For this reason, we are shifting our program in important ways. While we’ve always disrupted\n\nthe status quo in the interest of kids, our alumni and corps members continue to grow and refuse to become\n\ncomplacent. We’re focused on ensuring that our schools and systems are set up to support students entering a\n\ndigital, global economy through personalized learning, creativity, critical thinking, and language acquisition. All\n\nkids in Memphis deserve the opportunity to pursue their dreams and realize their potential, and Teach For America\n\ndevelops the kind of leaders who will help them chart a course toward a more promising future.\n\nThe 2016 corps heralded the tenth anniversary of our operation in Memphis.
