        "text": "Joan Collins is an English actress from Paddington, London. She is most famous for playing the role of vengeful schemer Alexis Carrington Colby in the soap opera \"Dynasty\" (1981-1989). In 1997, She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama. In 2015, She was promoted to the rank of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to charity.\n\nShe was the daughter of talent agent Joseph William Collins (1902-1988) and his wife, dance teacher Elsa Bessant, (1906-1962). Joseph was born in South Africa, and of Jewish descent. As a talent agent, his most famous clients were Shirley Bassey, the Beatles, and Tom Jones. Elsa was born in the United Kingdom to an Anglican family.\n\nCollins was educated at Francis Holland School in London, an independent day school for girls. She made her theatrical debut c. 1942, as a child actress. She had a role in a performance of the play \"A Doll's House\" (1879) by Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906). In 1949, She started training as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. In 1950, she signed a contract with a British film studio, the Rank Organisation of businessman Joseph Arthur Rank, 1st Baron Rank (1888-1972).\n\nCollins made her film debut in the short film \"Facts and Fancies\" (1951), and her feature film debut in \"Lady Godiva Rides Again\" (1951), where she played an unnamed Beauty Queen Contestant. She had supporting roles as the Greek maid Marina in \"The Woman's Angle\" (1952) and gangster's moll Lil Carter in \"Judgment Deferred\" (1952).\n\nCollins had her big break when cast as juvenile delinquent Norma Hart in prison drama \"I Believe in You\" (1952). She was hailed as Britain's new \"bad girl\" and started being offered high-profile roles in British films. The next stage in her career started when cast as Princess Nellifer of Egypt in the historical epic \"Land of the Pharaohs\" (1955), an international production . While the film was not successful at the box office, it became a cult classic and Nellifer was one of her most recognizable roles. Studio executive Darryl Francis Zanuck (1902-1979) was sufficiently impressed to offer her a 7-year-long contract with American studio 20th Century Fox. She took the offer.\n\nCollins' first American film was the historical drama \"The Virgin Queen\" (1955), where she shared the top-billing with established stars Bette Davis and Richard Todd. She then played the leading role of actress Evelyn Nesbit (1884/1885-1967) in the biographical film \"The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing\" (1955). The role was intended for established actress Marilyn Monroe, but she replaced Monroe based on a studio decision.\n\nCollins was placed on loan to studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for her next role, that of gold digger Crystal in \"The Opposite Sex\" (1956). She received the top billing in the refugee-themed film \"Sea Wife\" (1956), and enjoyed box-office success with the interracial-love themed drama \"Island in the Sun\" (1957). In the drama film \"The Wayward Bus\" (1957), she received top-billing over her co-star Jayne Mansfield. Her next films included the spy thriller \"Stopover Tokyo\" (1957), the Western \"The Bravados\" (1958), the comedy \"Rally Round the Flag, Boys\" (1959), the caper film \"Seven Thieves\" (1960), and the biblical epic Esther and the King (1960).\n\nBy 1960, Collins was one of 20th Century Fox's biggest stars, but she demanded a release from her studio contract. She had campaigned for the title role in the upcoming production of \"Cleopatra\", but the studio chose to cast Elizabeth Taylor in the role. Collins felt slighted. As a freelance actress for most of the 1960s, she had few film roles. Among her most notable roles was playing the leading lady in \"The Road to Hong Kong\" (1962), the last film in the long-running \"Road to ...\" series. The male leads for the entire series were Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, but their usual leading lady Dorothy Lamour was considered too old for the role. Collins replaced Lamour.\n\nCollins started appearing frequently on television guest star roles. Among her most notable television roles was the villainous Siren in \"Batman\", and pacifist spokeswoman Edith Keeler in \"Star Trek: The Original Series\". \"Road to ...\" played in only one episode of Star Trek, the time-travel episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" (1967). However the episode is regarded among the best episodes in the entire Star Trek franchise, with Collins considered one of the most memorable guest stars in the original series.\n\nIn 1970, Collins returned to her native United Kingdom. She started appearing frequently in British thriller and horror films of the decade. Among her films was revenge-themed drama \"Revenge\" (1971),science fiction film \"Quest for Love\" (1972), horror anthology \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1972), psychological horror \"Fear in the Night\" (1972), thriller \"Dark Places\", horror anthology \"Tales That Witness Madness\" (1973), and horror film \"I Don't Want to Be Born\" (1975).\n\nCollins appeared in a few comedies in-between horror films, but none was particularly successful. She returned to the United States in order to play a role in the giant monster film \"Empire of the Ants\" (1977). She then returned to mostly appearing in thriller roles. She was catapulted back to stardom with the lead role of nymphomaniac Fontaine Khaled in the erotic drama \"The Stud\" (1978), an adaptation of a novel written by her younger sister Jackie Collins. The film was a surprise box office hit, earning 20 million dollars at the worldwide box office. \"Road to ...\" returned to the role of Fontaine in the sequel film ''The Bitch'' (1979), which was also a hit.\n\nCollins found herself in high demand in both stage and film. But she gained more notoriety with the television role of Alexis Carington in \"Dynasty\". She started appearing in the role in the second season of the soap opera. Her performance is credited with the subsequent rise of the show's Nielsen's ratings. She became a household name, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983.\n\nBy 1985, \"Dynasty\" was the number-one show in the United States, beating out rival soap opera \"Dallas\". Collins was nominated six times for a Golden Globe Award for her role, winning once in 1983. She was also once nominated for an Emmy as Best Actress in a Drama Series. Collins was viewed as a sex symbol at the time, and in 1983 appeared in a 12-page photo layout for Playboy magazine. She was 50-years-old, unusually old for a Playboy model.\n\nCollins appeared in a total of 195 episodes of \"Dynasty\". The series was canceled with the last episode of its 9th season, due to falling ratings. New ABC entertainment president Bob Iger (1951-) is credited with ending the series as soon as possible. The show had a cliffhanger ending, and several of its subplots were not resolved. Collins returned to the role of Alexis in the sequel mini-series \"Dynasty: The Reunion\" (1991). The miniseries only lasted for 2 episodes, but resolved several subplots and was a ratings hit.\n\nThroughout the 1990s., Collins returned to guest star roles in television. She appeared in (among others) \"Roseanne\", \"Egoli: Place of Gold\", and \"The Nanny\", She had the recurring role of Christina Hobson in the short-lived soap opera \"Pacific Palisades\" (1997). She appeared in 7 of its 13 episodes. Her next notable soap opera role was that of so-called \"rich bitch\" Alexandra Spaulding in 2002 episodes of the long-running series \"Guiding Light\". Collins was the third actress to play this role. following Beverlee McKinsey and Marj Dusay.\n\nIn film, Collins played Pearl Slaghoople, Wilma Flintstone's mother, in \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" (2000). It was the second live-action film based on the popular animated series \"The Flintstones\". In 2006, she toured the United Kingdom with \"An Evening with Joan Collins\", an one-woman show where she narrated the highs and lows of her career and life. She later toured the word with both this show and its sequel \"Joan Collins Unscripted\".\n\nCollins had a notable guest star-role as Ruth Van Rydock in the television film \"Agatha Christie's Marple: They Do It with Mirrors\" (2009). The film was an adaptation of the 1952 novel by Agatha Christie, where Ruth is an old school friend of Jane Marple, who assigned Jane to investigate a home for juvenile delinquents.\n\nCollins played herself in three episodes of the sitcom \"Happily Divorced\" (2011-2013). She had the recurring role of Crystal Hennessy-Vass in the sitcom \"Benidorm\" (2007-2018). She had another recurring role as Alexandra, Grand Duchess of Oxford in the soap opera \"The Royals\" (2015-2018).\n\nCollins had two different roles in the horror anthology series \"American Horror Story\". She played wealthy grandmother Evie Gallant, and witch Bubbles McGee. She appeared in a total of four episodes in 2018.\n\nBy 2024, Collins was 90-years-old. She has never retired from acting, and she continues to appear in new roles.\n\nShirley MacLaine was born Shirley MacLean Beaty in Richmond, Virginia. Her mother, Kathlyn Corinne (MacLean), was a drama teacher from Nova Scotia, Canada, and her father, Ira Owens Beaty, a professor of psychology and real estate agent, was from Virginia. Her brother, Warren Beatty, was born on March 30, 1937. Her ancestry includes English and Scottish.\n\nShirley was the tallest in her ballet classes at the Washington School of Ballet. Just after she graduated from Washington-Lee High School, she packed her bags and headed for New York. While auditioning for Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Me and Juliet\", the producer kept mispronouncing her name. She then changed her name from Shirley MacLean Beaty to Shirley MacLaine. She later had a role in \"The Pajama Game\", as a member of the chorus and understudy to Carol Haney. A few months into the run, Shirley was going to leave the show for the lead role in \"Can-Can\" but ended up filling in for Haney, who had broken her ankle and could not perform. She would fill in for Carol, again, three months later, following another injury, the very night that movie producer Hal B. Wallis was in the audience. Wallis signed MacLaine to a five-year contract to Paramount Pictures. Three months later, she was off to shoot Immer Ärger mit Harry (1955). She then took roles in Hitzewelle (1958) and In 80 Tagen um die Welt (1956), completed not too long before her daughter, Sachi Parker (born Stephanie), was born. With Shirley's career on track, she played one of her most challenging roles: \"Ginny Moorhead\" in Verdammt sind sie alle (1958), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She went on to do In Colorado ist der Teufel los (1958) and Die Heiratsvermittlerin (1958). In 1960, she got her second Academy Award nomination for Das Appartement (1960). Three years later, she received a third nomination for Das Mädchen Irma la Douce (1963). In 1969, she brought her friend Bob Fosse from Broadway to direct her in Sweet Charity (1969), from which she got her \"signature\" song, \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\". After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made a documentary on China called The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir (1975), for which she received an Oscar nomination for best documentary.\n\nIn 1977, she got her fourth Best Actress Oscar nomination for Am Wendepunkt (1977). In 1979, she worked with Peter Sellers in Willkommen, Mr. Chance (1979), made shortly before his death. After 20 years in the film industry, she finally took home the Best Actress Oscar for Zeit der Zärtlichkeit (1983). After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made Madame Sousatzka (1988), a critical and financial hit that took top prize at the Venice Film Festival. In 1989, she starred with Dolly Parton, Sally Field and Julia Roberts in Magnolien aus Stahl - Die Stärke der Frauen (1989). She received rave reviews playing Meryl Streep's mother in Grüße aus Hollywood (1990) and for Tess und ihr Bodyguard (1994). In 1996, she reprised her role from \"Terms of Endearment\" as \"Aurora Greenway\" in Jahre der Zärtlichkeit (1996), which didn't repeat its predecessor's success at the box office. In mid-1998, she directed Bruno (2000), which starred Alex D. Linz. In February 2001, Shirley worked with close friends once again in These Old Broads (2001), and co-starred with Julia Stiles in Carolina - Auf der Suche nach Mr. Perfect (2003) and with Kirstie Alley in Salem Witch Trials (2002).\n\nMacLaine as her own website which includes her own radio show and interviews, the Encounter Board, and Independent Expression, a members-only section of the site. In the past few years, Shirley starred in a CBS miniseries based on the life of cosmetics queen Mary Kay Ash--Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay (2002), and wrote two more books, \"The Camino\" in 2001, and \"Out On A Leash\" in 2003. After taking a slight hiatus from motion pictures, Shirley returned with roles in the movies that were small, but wonderfully scene-stealing: Verliebt in eine Hexe (2005) with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell, In den Schuhen meiner Schwester (2005) with Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette, in which Shirley was nominated for a Golden Globe in the best supporting actress category, and Wo die Liebe hinfällt... (2005) with Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Costner. Shirley completed filming of Closing the Ring (2007), directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, in 2007. Her latest book is entitled \"Sage-ing While Ag-ing\"; Shirley's latest film is Valentinstag (2010), which debuted in theaters on February 12, 2010.\n\nSophia Loren was born as Sofia Scicolone at the Clinica Regina Margherita in Rome on September 20, 1934. Her father Riccardo was married to another woman and refused to marry her mother Romilda Villani, despite the fact that she was the mother of his two children (Sophia and her younger sister Maria Scicolone). Growing up in the slums of Pozzuoli during the second World War without any support from her father, she experienced great sadness in her childhood. Her life took an unexpected turn for the best when, at age 14, she entered into a beauty contest and placed as one of the finalists. It was here that Sophia caught the attention of film producer Carlo Ponti, some 22 years her senior, whom she later married. Perhaps he was the father figure she never experienced as a child. Under his guidance, Sophia was put under contract and appeared as an extra in ten films beginning with Le sei mogli di Barbablù (1950), before working her way up to supporting roles. In these early films, she was credited as \"Sofia Lazzaro\" because people joked her beauty could raise Lazzarus from the dead.\n\nBy her late teens, Sophia was playing lead roles in many Italian features such as La favorita (1952) and Aida (1953). In 1957, she embarked on a successful acting career in the United States, starring in Der Knabe auf dem Delphin (1957), Die Stadt der Verlorenen (1957), and Stolz und Leidenschaft (1957) that year. She had a short-lived but much-publicized fling with co-star Cary Grant, who was nearly 31 years her senior. She was only 22 while he was 53, and she rejected a marriage proposal from him. They were paired together a second time in the family-friendly romantic comedy Hausboot (1958). While under contract to Paramount, Sophia starred in Begierde unter Ulmen (1958), Der Schlüssel (1958), Die schwarze Orchidee (1958), Es Begann in Neapel (1960), Die Dame und der Killer (1960), Prinzessin Olympia (1960), and Die Millionärin (1960) before returning to Italy to star in ...und dennoch leben sie (1960). The film was a period piece about a woman living in war-torn Italy who is raped while trying to protect her young daughter. Originally cast as the more glamorous child, Sophia fought against type and was re-cast as the mother, displaying a lack of vanity and proving herself as a genuine actress. This performance received international acclaim and was honored with an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nSophia remained a bona fide international movie star throughout the sixties and seventies, making films on both sides of the Atlantic, and starring opposite such leading men as Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Gregory Peck, and Charlton Heston. Her English-language films included El Cid (1961), Der Untergang des Römischen Reiches (1964), Arabeske (1966), Der Mann von La Mancha (1972), and Treffpunkt Todesbrücke (1976). She gained wider respect with her Italian films, especially Hochzeit auf italienisch (1964) and Ein besonderer Tag (1977), both of which co-starred Marcello Mastroianni. During these years she received a second Oscar nomination and won five Golden Globe Awards.\n\nFrom the eighties onward, Sophia's appearances on the big screen came few and far between. She preferred to spend the majority of her time raising sons Carlo Ponti Jr. (b. 1968) and Edoardo Ponti (b. 1973). Her only acting credits during the decade were five television films, beginning with Sophia Loren - Mein Leben (1980), a biopic in which she portrayed herself and her mother. She ventured into other areas of business and became the first actress to launch her own fragrance and design of eyewear. In 1982 she voluntarily spent nineteen days in jail for tax evasion.\n\nIn 1991 Sophia received an Honorary Academy Award for her body of work, and was declared \"one of world cinema's greatest treasures.\" That same year, she experienced a terrible loss when her mother died of cancer. Her return to mainstream films in Prêt-à-Porter (1994) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. She followed this up with her biggest U.S. hit in years, the comedy Der dritte Frühling (1995), in which she played a sexy divorcée who seduces Walter Matthau. Over the next decade Sophia had plum roles in a few independent films like Soleil (1997), Zwischen Fremden (2002) (directed by Edoardo), and Lives of the Saints (2004). Still beautiful at 72, she posed scantily-clad for the 2007 Pirelli Calendar. Sadly, that same year she mourned the death of her 94-year-old spouse, Carlo Ponti. In 2009, after far too much time away from film, she appeared in the musical Nine (2009) opposite Daniel Day-Lewis. These days Sophia is based in Switzerland but frequently travels to the states to spend time with her sons and their families (Eduardo is married to actress Sasha Alexander). Sophia Loren remains one of the most beloved and recognizable figures in the international film world.\n\nJudd Hirsch is an American actor from New York City. His main claim to fame is playing taxicab driver Alex Reiger in the hit sitcom Taxi (1978). For this role, Hirsch twice won the \"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.\" He has since had a long career.\n\nIn 1935, Hirsch was born in The Bronx, New York City. His parents were electrician Joseph Sidney Hirsch and his wife Sally Kitzis. Joseph was born in New York to immigrant parents. Hirsch's paternal grandfather Benjamin Hirsch was German-Jewish, while his wife Rosa was born to a Dutch-Jewish family in England. Hirsch's maternal ancestors were Russian-Jews.\n\nHirsch spend his early years moving between the Bronx and Brooklyn. He received his secondary education at the DeWitt Clinton High School, an all-boys school located in The Bronx. He graduated in 1952, at the age of 17. He received his tertiary education at the City College of New York, a public college located in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. He graduated with a degree in physics.\n\nFollowing his college graduation, Hirsch served his term in the United States Army. Retuning to civilian life, he was hired as an engineer by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886-1997). He eventually decided to switch to an acting career. He studied acting at the HB Studio, located in Greenwich Village.\n\nHirsch started his acting career with theatrical roles. In the 1970s, he frequently appeared in television films. He also had guest star roles in television series, such as Medical Story (1975), Visions (1976), and Rhoda (1974). He achieved stardom with the leading role of Alex Reiger in \"Taxi\" (1978-1983). Alex was a rather jaded character, bitter following his divorce and the loss of custody over his only child. He resonated with audiences of this period. He won the Emmy Award for Lead Actor In a Comedy Series in both 1981 and 1983.\n\nHirsch had the supporting role of psychiatrist Dr. Tyrone C. Berger in the family drama film Eine ganz normale Familie (1980). In the film, he treats patient Conrad Jarrett (played by Timothy Hutton) who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, survivor's guilt, and suicidal ideation following the accidental death of his brother. The film was critically acclaimed, and Hirsch was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The award was instead won by his co-star Timothy Hutton.\n\nHirsch had the co-starring role of police lieutenant Al Menetti in the missing person investigation-themed film An einem Morgen im Mai (1983). The film was inspired by the real-life disappearance of Etan Patz (1972-1979), which was later determined to be a murder case. The film earned about 9,6 million dollars at the domestic box office. It was the 81st highest-grossing film of 1983.\n\nHirsch had a major role as vice principal Roger Rubell in the black comedy film Die Aufsässigen (1984). The film deals with internal conflicts in a high school which is faced with a lawsuit by a recent graduate. The film was moderately successful at the box office, though it is mostly remembered for featuring the hit song \"Understanding\" by Bob Seger (1945-).\n\nHirsch had the leading role of pater familias Arthur Pope in the drama film Die Flucht ins Ungewisse (1988). In the film, Pope and his wife are wanted by the FBI for their involvement in the bombing of a napalm laboratory during the 1970s. They are hiding undercover identities while trying to raise their sons. The film was a box office flop but received critical acclaim. It is mainly remembered for a well-received early role for River Phoenix (1970-1993) as Arthur's eldest son.\n\nHirsch was cast in the leading role of teacher John Lacey in the American sitcom Mein lieber John (1988). It was an adaptation of the British sitcom Dear John.... (1986). Both series deal with adult men trying to rebuilt their lives after their wives leave them for other men, and kick them out of their family home. The American series lasted for 4 seasons and a total of 90 episodes. For this role, Hirsch won the 1988 \"Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy\".\n\nHirsch had the supporting role of Julius Levinson in the science fiction film Independence Day (1996). Julius was depicted as the aging father of the engineer David Levinson (played by Jeff Goldblum), one of the film's co-protagonists. The film earned about 817 million dollars the worldwide box office, the highest-grossing film in Hirsch's career. He returned to this role in the sequel Independence Day: Wiederkehr (2016), which was moderately successful.\n\nHirsch co-starred in the sitcom George & Leo (1997) with Bob Newhart (1929-). He played magician Leo Wagonman, who was trying to hide after successfully robbing a casino. The series only lasted a single season and a total of 22 episodes. It was canceled due to low ratings.\n\nHirsch had the supporting role of a Princeton University professor in the biographical film A Beautiful Mind: Genie und Wahnsinn (2001). The film was based on the life of mathematician John Nash (1928-2015), an expert on game theory. The film earned about 317 million dollars at the worldwide box office, and won the \"Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama\" It was one of the most acclaimed films in Hirsch's career.\n\nIn 2005 Hirsch received a major television role as retired city planner Alan Eppes in the police procedural series Numb3rs - Die Logik des Verbrechens (2005). The series concerned two brothers who collaborate in investigating FBI cases. Alan was depicted as their meddling father, who keeps reminding them to also take care of their personal lives and problems. The series lasted 6 seasons, and 118 episodes. Hirsch's role was well-received by audiences.\n\nIn 2016, Hirsch guest starred in two episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory (2007). He played anthropologist Dr. Alfred Hofstadter, the father of main character Leonard Hofstadter (played by Johnny Galecki). The character had been frequently mentioned in the series since its first season, but had never appeared before. While the series previously mentioned that Alfred neglected his son during Leonard's childhood, in the guest appearances he turned out to have a friendly relationship with his grown-up son. Alfred seemed impressed that Leonard had a loving relationship with his wife, something which Alfred had never experienced.\n\nIn 2017, Hirsch was cast in the main role of donut shop owner Arthur Przybyszewski in the sitcom Superior Donuts (2017). The series depicted Arthur as a veteran business owner with old-fashioned ideas, who reluctantly recognizes that he has to modernize his shop in order to stay in business. The series lasted 2 seasons and a total of 34 episodes. It was reportedly canceled due to a decline in its ratings. The final episode resolves the series' main plot, with Arthur deciding to sell his shop and to finally retire.\n\nAs of 2021, Hirsch is 86-years-old. He has never retired from acting, though he mostly plays guest-star roles in television. He remains a popular actor.\n\nWoody Allen was born on November 30, 1935, as Allen Konigsberg, in The Bronx, NY, the son of Martin Konigsberg and Nettie Konigsberg. He has one younger sister, Letty Aronson. As a young boy, he became intrigued with magic tricks and playing the clarinet, two hobbies that he continues today.\n\nAllen broke into show business at 15 years when he started writing jokes for a local paper, receiving $200 a week. He later moved on to write jokes for talk shows but felt that his jokes were being wasted. His agents, Charles Joffe and Jack Rollins, convinced him to start doing stand-up and telling his own jokes. Reluctantly he agreed and, although he initially performed with such fear of the audience that he would cover his ears when they applauded his jokes, he eventually became very successful at stand-up. After performing on stage for a few years, he was approached to write a script for Warren Beatty to star in: Was gibt's Neues, Pussy? (1965) and would also have a moderate role as a character in the film. During production, Woody gave himself more and better lines and left Beatty with less compelling dialogue. Beatty inevitably quit the project and was replaced by Peter Sellers, who demanded all the best lines and more screen-time.\n\nIt was from this experience that Woody realized that he could not work on a film without complete control over its production. Woody's theoretical directorial debut was in What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966); a Japanese spy flick that he dubbed over with his own comedic dialogue about spies searching for the secret recipe for egg salad. His real directorial debut came the next year in the mockumentary Woody, der Unglücksrabe (1969). He has written, directed and, more often than not, starred in about a film a year ever since, while simultaneously writing more than a dozen plays and several books of comedy.\n\nWhile best known for his romantic comedies Der Stadtneurotiker (1977) and Manhattan (1979), Woody has made many transitions in his films throughout the years, transitioning from his \"early, funny ones\" of Bananas (1971), Die letzte Nacht des Boris Gruschenko (1975) and Was Sie schon immer über Sex wissen wollten, aber bisher nicht zu fragen wagten (1972); to his more storied and romantic comedies of Der Stadtneurotiker (1977), Manhattan (1979) and Hannah und ihre Schwestern (1986); to the Bergmanesque films of Stardust Memories (1980) and Innenleben (1978); and then on to the more recent, but varied works of Verbrechen und andere Kleinigkeiten (1989), Ehemänner und Ehefrauen (1992), Geliebte Aphrodite (1995), Celebrity - Schön, reich, berühmt (1998) and Harry außer sich (1997); and finally to his films of the last decade, which vary from the light comedy of Scoop - Der Knüller (2006), to the self-destructive darkness of Match Point (2005) and, most recently, to the cinematically beautiful tale of Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Although his stories and style have changed over the years, he is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of our time because of his views on art and his mastery of filmmaking.\n\nThe quintessential jet-set Euro starlet, Ursula Andress was born in the Swiss canton of Berne on March 19, 1936, one of six children in a strict German Protestant family. Although often seeming icily aloof, a restless streak early demonstrated itself in her personality, and she had an impetuous desire to explore the world outside Switzerland. (For instance, she was tracked down by Interpol for running away from boarding school at 17 years old.) The stunning young woman found work as an art model in Rome and did walk-on parts in three quickie Italian pictures before coming to Hollywood in 1955 and getting nowhere professionally; a four-month fling with rising star James Dean brought her good publicity but not much else. That same year, still just 19, she met and had an affair with fading matinée idol John Derek, who left his wife Pati Behrs and two kids for Ursula even though she spoke almost no English at the time. In 1957 they eloped to Las Vegas, and the new bride put her acting aspirations on hold for a few years thereafter.\n\n1962 saw the relatively unknown Swiss beauty back on the set, playing opposite Sean Connery in the first movie version of Ian Fleming's fanciful \"James Bond\" espionage novels, James Bond 007 jagt Dr. No (1962). Andress' role as bikini-clad Honey Ryder was somewhat brief, and her Swiss/German accent so thick that her entire performance had to be dubbed by a voiceover artist. Nevertheless, her striking looks and smoldering screen presence made a strong impression on moviegoers, immediately establishing her as one of the most desired women in the world and as an ornament to put alongside some of the most bankable talent of the era, such as Elvis Presley in Acapulco (1963) and Dean Martin in Vier für Texas (1963). In 1965, she was one of several European starlets to co-star in Was gibt's Neues, Pussy? (1965) -- a film that perhaps sums up mid-'60s pop culture better than any other -- written by Woody Allen, starring Allen and Peter Sellers, with music by Burt Bacharach, a title song performed by Tom Jones and much on-screen sexual romping.\n\nAndress appeared in many more racy-for-their time movies in both the United States and Europe, including Das 10. Opfer (1965), in which she wore a famously ballistic bra, and Der blaue Max (1966), where she was aptly cast as the sultry, insatiable wife of an aristocratic World War I German general. She was also featured in Casino Royale (1967), a satirical foray into the world of James Bond, and gave a sparkling performance in the T&A-filled crime caper Treffpunkt London Airport (1970). Roles as a prostitute kidnapped by outlaws in Rivalen unter roter Sonne (1971), a stewardess living on the edge in Ich polier' dir deine Glatze (1975), and a bombshell nurse hired to titillate a doddering millionaire to death in Operation mißlungen - Patient lebt (1975) all provided plenty of excuses to throw her clothes to the wind. In Die weiße Göttin der Kannibalen (1978), she was notoriously stripped and slathered in orange paint by a pair of nubiles. Then she took on the sophisticated role of Louise de la Valliere, slinky, conspiratorial mistress of King Louis XIV (Beau Bridges) in Das Geheimnis der eisernen Maske (1979).\n\nAs for her personal life, Andress separated from Derek in 1964 and got divorced two years later, after falling in love with French superstar Jean-Paul Belmondo on the Malaysian set of Die tollen Abenteuer des Monsieur L. (1965). (Ron Ely, John Richardson and Marcello Mastroianni kept her company during the interim.) The relationship with Belmondo hit a wall in 1972, and she was next attached to her leading man from Diamantenpuppe (1973), Italian heartthrob Fabio Testi. When that didn't work out, Andress jumped into the dating pool, sporadically involved with a host of Lotharios including (but by no means limited to) Dennis Hopper, Franco Nero, John DeLorean and Ryan O'Neal. In 1979, she began what would be a long-term romance with Harry Hamlin, her handsome young co-star from Kampf der Titanen (1981) (in which she was cast, predictably, as \"Aphrodite\"). While subsequently traveling in India, Andress' belly began to swell out of her clothing, and she felt very nauseous. What at first seemed a severe case of \"Delhi Belly\" turned out to be pregnancy, her first and only, at age 43. Hamlin encouraged her to have the baby, and on May 19, 1980, the international sex symbol gave birth to a boy named Dimitri Hamlin amid much hoopla.\n\nAfter the birth of her son, Andress scaled back her career, which now focused on slight European productions, as she was raising Dimitri in Italy. This meant turning down a big-budget Mel Brooks film in lieu of Mexico in Flammen (1982) (starring old flame Nero). Occasional television stints on the soap opera Falcon Crest (1981) and critically lauded miniseries Peter der Große (1986) helped maintain her visibility as an actress. Dumped by Hamlin in 1983, she started seeing Fausto Fagone, a Sicilian student three decades her junior, in 1986. In 1991, she met a new man when things dwindled with Fagone -- karate master Jeff Speakman. Since the breakup of that relationship, her love life has gone undocumented. She last worked on a film in 2005. Apparently retired from acting, Ursula makes the rounds of charity events and pops up on foreign talk shows every now and then. She divides her time between family in Switzerland, friends in Virginia and Spain, and her properties in Rome and L.A.\n\nTwo-time Oscar nominee Bruce Dern's tremendous career is made up of playing both modern day heroes and legendary villains. Through decades of lauded performances, Dern has acquired the reputation of being one of the most talented and prolific actors of his generation.\n\nDern currently appears opposite Kristen Wiig, Allison Janney and his daughter Laura in Apple+ TV's acclaimed comedy series \"Palm Royale.\" He also received critical praise for the last season of the Amazon series \"Goliath\" opposite Oscar winners Billy Bob Thornton and JK Simmons.\n\nDern appeared as real-life rancher George Spahn in Quentin Tarantino's 10-time Academy Award nominated \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" The film also won the Golden Globes & Critics Choice Awards for Best Picture, among others. He also co-starred in the #1 independent film of 2019, \"The Peanut Butter Falcon\" and he earned rave reviews for Focus Features' \"The Mustang.\" He has recently appeared in several recent independent film projects including \"Reminisce,\" \"The Accidental Texan,\" \"Remember Me,\" \"The Artist's Wife,\" \"Emperor,\" \"Badland,\" \"Death in Texas,\" \"Last Call,\" and \"The Gateway.\"\n\nIn 2018, he starred in two high profile independent films - as Joe Kennedy in \"Chappaquiddick\" and opposite Matthew McConaughey in Sony's \"White Boy Rick.\" In 2017, he appeared with Jane Fonda and Robert Redford in the Netflix film \"Our Souls at Night.\"\n\nOn the television side in 2019 - he memorably guested on Showtime's comedy \"Black Monday\" and was seen in the Stephen King series \"Mr. Mercedes\" for the AT&T AUDIENCE Network.\n\nIn 2015, Dern reteamed with his \"Django Unchained\" director Quentin Tarantino in the ambitious & critically-acclaimed \"The Hateful Eight.\" In 2013, Dern earned his second Academy Award nomination for his heralded role in Alexander Payne's \"Nebraska.\" That role also garnered him a Best Actor Award from the Cannes Film Festival and the National Board of Review. He was also nominated for a BAFTA, Golden Globe, Independent Spirit Award, Broadcast Film Critics Association Award and Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nDern was also nominated for an Emmy in 2011 for his portrayal of polygamist patriarch Frank Harlow in HBO's hit drama \"Big Love.\" A celebrated stage actor, Dern was trained by famed director Elia Kazan at the legendary The Actor's Studio and made his film debut in Kazan's \"Wild River\" in 1960. In the 60's, Dern also found success as a distinguished television actor. He appeared regularly in contemporary Western TV series, as well as on \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\" Mr. Hitchcock was such a fan of Dern's that he cast him in \"Marnie\" and \"Family Plot\" (Hitchcock's final film).\n\nAlso during the 60's, Dern went on to work with director Roger Corman and appeared in several of his classic and decade defining films including \"Wild Angels.\" He also received critical success during that time for films such as \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" and \"Drive, He Said.\" Dern goes down in history for his role as Long Hair in \"The Cowboys,\" in which he became the only man ever to kill John Wayne on screen.\n\nDern went on to star in such classic films like \"The King of Marvin Gardens\" with Jack Nicholson and Ellen Burstyn as well as playing Tom Buchanan in \"The Great Gatsby\" (for which he received a Golden Globe nomination). It was his brilliant and powerful performance in Hal Ashby's \"Coming Home\" that earned him both an Academy Award and Golden Globe nomination.\n\nDern has starred in over 100 films in his career, including: \"Monster,\" \"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte,\" \"Silent Running,\" \"Smile,\" \"Middle Age Crazy,\" \"That Championship Season,\" \"Tattoo,\" \"The 'Burbs,\" \"The Haunting,\" \"All the Pretty Horses,\" \"Masked and Anonymous,\" \"Down in the Valley,\" \"Astronaut Farmer,\" \"The Cake Eaters,\" \"Black Sunday,\" \"After Dark, My Sweet,\" \"Madison,\" \"Diggstown,\" \"Twixt\" and \"Last Man Standing.\"\n\nDern has received several Lifetime Achievement Awards from various film festivals. In 2010, Dern received the prestigious Hollywood Walk of Fame star along with his ex-wife Diane Ladd & daughter Laura Dern, the only family in history to receive their Stars in one ceremony.\n\nOn January 30, 1937, renowned theatre actor Michael Redgrave was performing in a production of Hamlet in London. During the curtain call, the show's lead, Laurence Olivier, announced to the audience: \"tonight a great actress was born\". This was in reference to his co-star's newborn daughter, Vanessa Redgrave.\n\nVanessa was born in Greenwich, London, to Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, both thespians. Three quarters of a century after her birth (despite numerous ups and down) this rather forward expectation has definitely been lived up to with an acclaimed actress that has won (among many others) an Academy Award, two Emmys, two Golden Globes, two Cannes Best Actress awards, a Tony, a Screen Actors Guild award, a Laurence Olivier theatre award and a BAFTA fellowship.\n\nGrowing up with such celebrated theatrical parents, great expectations were put on both herself, her brother Corin Redgrave and sister Lynn Redgrave at an early age. Shooting up early and finally reaching a height just short of 6 foot, Redgrave initially had plans to dance and perform ballet as a profession. However she settled on acting and entered the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1954 and four years later made her West End debut. In the decade of the 1960s she developed and progressed to become one of the most noted young stars of the English stage and then film. Performances on the London stage included the classics: 'A Touch of Sun', 'Coriolanus', 'A Midsummer's Night Dream', 'All's Well that Ends Well', 'As You Like It', 'The Lady from the Sea', 'The Seagull' and many others. By the mid 1960s, she had booked various film roles and matured into a striking beauty with a slim, tall frame and attractive face. In 1966 she made her big screen debut as the beautiful ex-wife of a madman in an Oscar nominated performance in the oddball comedy Protest (1966), as well as the enigmatic woman in a public park in desperate need of a photographer's negatives in the iconic Blow Up (1966) and briefly appeared in an unspoken part of Anne Boleyn in the Best Picture winner of the year Ein Mann zu jeder Jahreszeit (1966).\n\nShe managed to originate the title role in \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" the same year on the London stage (which was then adapted for the big screen a few years later, but Maggie Smith was cast instead and managed to win an Oscar for her performance). Her follow up work saw her play the lead in the box office hit adaptation Camelot: Am Hofe König Arthurs (1967), a film popular with audiences but dismissed by critics, and her second Academy Award nominated performance as Isadora Duncan in the critically praised Isadora (1968).\n\nHer rise in popularity on film also coincided with her public political involvement, she was one of the lead faces in protesting against the Vietnam war and lead a famous march on the US embassy, was arrested during a Ban-the-Bomb demonstration, publicly supported Yasar Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and fought for various other human rights and particularly left wing causes. Despite her admirably independent qualities, most of her political beliefs weren't largely supported by the public. In 1971 after 3 films back to back, Redgrave suffered a miscarriage (it would have been her fourth, after Natasha Richardson, Joely Richardson and Carlo Gabriel Nero) and a break up with her then partner and father of her son, Franco Nero. This was around the same time her equally political brother Corin introduced her to the Workers Revolutionary Party, a group who aimed to destroy capitalism and abolish the monarchy. Her film career began to suffer and take the back seat as she became more involved with the party, twice unsuccessfully attempting to run as a party member for parliament, only obtaining a very small percentage of votes.\n\nIn terms of her film career at the time, she was given probably the smallest part in the huge ensemble who-dunnit hit, Mord im Orient-Express (1974) and given another thankless small part as Lola Deveraux in the Sherlock Holmes adventure Kein Koks für Sherlock Holmes (1976).\n\nAfter a celebrated Broadway debut, she created further controversy in 1977 with her involvement in two films, firstly in Julia (1977) where she acted opposite Jane Fonda as a woman fighting Nazi oppression and narrated and featured in the documentary The Palestinian (1977) where she famously danced holding a Kalashnikov rifle. She publicly stated her condemnation of what she termed \"Zionist hudlums\", which outraged Jewish groups and as a result a screening of her documentary was bombed and Redgrave was personally threatened by the Jewish Defense League (JDL). Julia (1977) happened to be a huge critical success and Redgrave herself was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but Jewish support groups demanded her nomination to be dropped and at the event of the Academy Awards burned effigies of Redgrave and protested and picketed. Redgrave was forced to enter the event via a rear entrance to avoid harm and when she won the award she famously remarked on the frenzy causes as \"Zionist hoodlums\" which caused the audience to audibly gasp and boo. The speech reached newspapers the next morning and her reputation was further damaged.\n\nIt came as a surprise when CBS hired her for the part of real life Nazi camp survivor Fania Fenelon in Das Mädchenorchester von Auschwitz (1980), despite more controversy and protesting (Fenelon herself didn't even want Redgrave to portray her) she won an Emmy for the part and the film was one of the highest rating programs of the year. Her follow up film work to her Oscar had been mostly low key but successful, performances in films such as Yanks - Gestern waren wir noch Fremde (1979), Das Geheimnis der Agatha Christie (1979), Die Damen aus Boston (1984), Wetherby (1985) and Das stürmische Leben des Joe Orton (1987) further cemented her reputation as a fine actress and she received various accolades and nominations.\n\nHowever mainly in the 1980s, she focused on TV films and high budget mini-series as well as theatre in both London and New York. She made headlines in 1984 when she sued the Boston Symphony Orchestra for $5 million for wrongful cancellation of her contract because of her politics (she also stated her salary was significantly reduced in Das Geheimnis der Agatha Christie (1979) for the same reason). She became more mainstream in the 1990s where she appeared in a string of high profile films but the parts often underused Redgrave's abilities or they were small cameos/5-minute parts. Highlights included Wiedersehen in Howards End (1992), Little Odessa - Eiskalt wie der Tod (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Das schwankende Schiff (1999), as well as her leading lady parts in Ein Sommer am See (1995) and Mrs Dalloway (1997).\n\nIn 2003 she finally won the coveted Tony award for her performance in 'The Long Day's Journey Into Night' and followed up with another two Tony nominated performances on Broadway, her one woman show 'The Year of Magical Thinking' in 2007 and 'Driving Miss Daisy' in 2010 which not only was extended due to high demand, but was also transferred to the West End for an additional three months in 2011.\n\nVanessa continues to lend her name to causes and has been notable for donating huge amounts of her own money for her various beliefs. She has publicly opposed the war in Iraq, campaigned for the closure of Guantanamo Bay, supported the rights of gays and lesbians as well as AIDs research and many other issues. She released her autobiography in 1993 and a few years later she was elected to serve as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She also famously declined the invitation to be made a Dame for her services as an actress. Many have wondered the possible heights her career could have reached if it wasn't for her outspoken views, but being a celebrity and the artificial lifestyle usually attached doesn't seem to interest Redgrave in the slightest.\n\nVanessa has worked with all three of her children professionally on numerous occasions (her eldest daughter, Natasha Richardson tragically died at the age of 45 due to a skiing accident) and in her mid 70s she still works regularly on television, film and theatre, delivering time and time again great performances.\n\nGeorge Takei was born Hosato Takei in Los Angeles, California. His mother was born in Sacramento to Japanese parents & his father was born in Japan. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, he & his family were relocated from Los Angeles to the Rohwer Relocation Center in Arkansas. Later, they were moved to a camp at Tule Lake in Northern California. His first-hand knowledge of the unjust internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans in World War II, poignantly chronicled in his autobiography, created a lifelong interest in politics & community affairs.\n\nAfter graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1956, he studied architecture at UC Berkeley. An ad in a Japanese community paper led to a summer job on the MGM lot where he dubbed 8 characters from Japanese into English for Rodan (1956). Bitten by the acting bug, he transferred to UCLA as a theater arts major. Contacting an agent he had met at MGM led to his appearance as an embittered soldier in postwar Japan in the Playhouse 90 (1956) production. Being spotted in a UCLA theater production by a Warner Bros. casting director led to his feature film debut in Titanen (1960), various roles in Hawaiian Eye (1959) &other feature work. In June 1960, he completed his degree at UCLA and studied at the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford-Upon-Avon in England that summer.\n\nAfter starting a master's degree program at UCLA, he was cast in the socially relevant stage musical production Fly Blackbird! but was replaced when the show moved to New York. He took odd jobs until returning to his role at the end of the run. Getting little work in Manhattan, he returned to Los Angeles to continue his studies, once again appearing in TV & films. He earned his master's in 1964. Wanting a multi-racial crew, Gene Roddenberry cast him in Where No Man Has Gone Before, the second Raumschiff Enterprise (1966) pilot. Mr. Sulu remained a regular character when the series went into production. In the hiatus after the end of shooting the first season, he worked on Die grünen Teufel (1968), playing a South Vietnamese Special Forces officer.\n\nAfter Raumschiff Enterprise (1966) was canceled, he did guest stints in several TV shows, voiced Sulu for the animated Star Trek series & regularly appeared at Star Trek conventions. He also produced & hosted a public affairs show Expression East/West, which aired in Los Angeles from 1971-1973. That year, he ran for the L.A. City Council. Although he lost by a small margin, Mayor Tom Bradley appointed him to the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District, where he served until 1984 & contributed to plans for the subway. During this period, he co-wrote a sci-fi novel Mirror Friend, Mirror Foe. He campaigned to get more respect for his character in the Star Trek features, resulting in Sulu finally obtaining the rank of captain in Star Trek VI - Das unentdeckte Land (1991), a role reprised in the Star Trek: Raumschiff Voyager (1995) episode Flashback.\n\nHe has run several marathons and was in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Torch Relay. He received a star on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame in 1986. He also left his signature & hand print in cement at the Chinese Theater in 1991. His 1994 autobiography, To the Stars, was well-received. He remains active as a stage, TV & film actor as well as as an advocate for the interests of Japanese Americans.\n\nChristopher Lloyd is an American actor with a relatively long career. His better known roles include drug-using taxicab driver Jim Ignatowski in the sitcom Taxi (1978), Klingon Commander Kruge in Star Trek III - Auf der Suche nach Mr. Spock (1984), inventor Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown in the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990), the evil Judge Doom in Falsches Spiel mit Roger Rabbit (1988), and deranged Uncle Fester in Die Addams Family (1991) and Die Addams Family in verrückter Tradition (1993).\n\nLloyd was born on October 22, 1938 in Stamford, Connecticut. His parents were lawyer Samuel R. Lloyd and singer Ruth Lapham (1896-1984). His maternal uncle was politician Roger Lapham, Mayor of San Francisco (1883-1966, term 1944-1948). His maternal grandfather was businessman Lewis Henry Lapham (1858-1934), co-founder of Texaco Oil Company. Lloyd is a distant descendant of indentured servant John Howland (c. 1592-1673), one of the passengers of the ship Mayflower and signers of the Mayflower Compact.\n\nLloyd was raised in the town Westport, Connecticut, which changed from a community of farmers to a suburban development during the 20th century. Many artists and writers from New York City settled in the town. Lloyd was educated at Staples High School. He was a co-founder of the Staples Players, the school's theatre company. Lloyd was interested in an acting career, and served as an apprentice at summer theaters in Mount Kisco, New York and Hyannis, Massachusetts. In 1957, he started pursuing acting classes in New York City. He took lessons at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, a full-time professional conservatory for actors. His acting teacher was Sanford Meisner (1905-1997), eponymous creator of the Meisner technique.\n\nLloyd made his New York theatrical debut in a 1961 production of the play \"And They Put Handcuffs on the Flowers\" by Fernando Arrabal (1932-). He was reportedly a replacement for another actor. He made his Broadway debut in a 1969 performance of Red, White and Maddox (1969). Until the mid-1970s, Lloyd was primarily a theatrical actor. He performed both on Off-Broadway shows and in Broadway. Lloyd made his film debut in the role of psychiatric patient Max Taber in the drama Einer flog über das Kuckucksnest (1975). His first major role in television was drug-using taxicab driver Jim Ignatowski in the sitcom Taxi (1978). His character was an aging hippie, son of an affluent Boston family , and former student of Harvard University. Ignatowski was one of the sitcom's most colorful characters and Lloyd won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Lloyd played most of his most notable film roles. Lloyd was first nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor, for his role as Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown in Zurück in die Zukunft (1985). The award was instead won by rival actor Roddy McDowall (1928-1998). He was nominated for the same award for his role as the evil Judge Doom in Falsches Spiel mit Roger Rabbit (1988). The award was instead won by rival actor Robert Loggia (1930-2015). Lloyd also performed as a voice actor, voicing the evil sorcerer Merlock in Ducktales Der Film: Jäger der verlorenen Lampe (1990) and historical figure Grigori Rasputin (1869-1916) in Anastasia (1997). Lloyd had another notable television role when cast in the role of villain Sebastian Jackal in the sci-fi series Tödliches Spiel (1995). He also played the character Dr. Jordan Kenneth Lloyd, the despised father of the series' protagonist Dr. Gus Lloyd (played by James Calvert).\n\nLloyd's last notable film role in the 1990s was playing the Martian Uncle Martin in Der Onkel vom Mars (1999). The film was an adaptation of the classic sitcom Mein Onkel vom Mars (1963), and the character was previously played by Ray Walston (1914-2001). The film under-performed at the box office. In the 2000s, Lloyd played the role of recurring character Cletus Poffenberger in the comic sci-fi series Tremors (2003), and recurring character Professor Harold March in the sitcom Pamela Anderson in: Stacked (2005). As March, Lloyd played a retired rocket scientist who was a regular customer of the bookstore which served as the series' setting. In the 2010s, Lloyd returned to the role of Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown in cameo appearances in A Million Ways To Die In The West (2014) and Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie (2016), and as the protagonist of the short film Back to the Future: Doc Brown Saves the World (2015). By 2020, Lloyd has never retired from acting and continues to appear in various roles.\n\nBorn on April 11, 1939, New York City born and bred Louise (Marie) Lasser was the daughter of Jewish author tax specialist Sol J. Lasser. Living a childhood of privilege and having a prestigious education, the eccentric comedy actress lightened things up considerably in her own household despite her mother Paula's mental instability. Tragic circumstances occurred when her mother, whom Louise saved once, committed suicide following the breakup of her marriage. Her father would also take his own life years later.\n\nA political science major at Brandeis University, Louise first won notice singing in Greenwich Village dives, improvisational revues and on Broadway in the early 1960s. In 1962, Louise understudied Barbra Streisand as Miss Marmelstein in \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale. Lasser was also the first woman to win a Clio Award for Best Actress in a 1967 commercial for Florida Orange Juice.\n\nArguably best known as the second Mrs. Woody Allen, Louise, known for her lethargic comedy presence, made her TV debut in a failed comedy pilot entitled The Laughmakers (1962), one of Allen's forays into the medium. She also made a brief, uncredited appearance as a masseuse in film Was gibt's Neues, Pussy? (1965) and had a voiceover in What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966). Marrying Woody on February 2, 1966, Louise went on to co-star with the comic master, earning a comedy name for herself in several of his other inaugural farcical romps -- particularly Woody, der Unglücksrabe (1969), Bananas (1971) and Was Sie schon immer über Sex wissen wollten, aber bisher nicht zu fragen wagten (1972). On Broadway, she appeared in \"Henry, Sweet Henry\" (1967), \"The Chinese and Dr. Fish\" (1970) and as a replacement in the comedy \"Thieves\" (1974).\n\nFollowing the end of her four-year marriage to Woody, Louise struck out on her own. On TV, she appeared to good advantage in guest episodes of \"Love, American Style,\" \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" \"The Bob Newhart Show,\" \"McCloud\" and \"Medical Center.\" On film, she appeared in the dramedy So gute Freunde (1971) and the crime comedy thriller Schleuderpartie (1973).\n\nAfter appearing in the lightweight TV-movie Hilfe, ich habe zwei Ehemänner (1973) with fresh-faced starring performances from Karen Valentine and John Davidson, and offering a kookier supporting perf as a police station receptionist opposite Alan Alda in the dark comedy murder mystery Isn't It Shocking? (1973), Louise hit major cult status as the enervated, beleaguered, pig-tailed, titular housewife/heroine of the bizarre Norman Lear nighttime soap satire Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (1976). It was here that Louise buffed up beautifully her deadpan neurotic comedy persona. The program's pilot was nominated for an Emmy and Louise herself for \"Classification of Outstanding Program and Individual Achievement.\"\n\nThe syndicated show certainly had it's own soap opera-styled problems on the set. In July of 1976, she was asked to host a first season episode of \"Saturday Night Live.\" It was said that Louise's erratic behavior was highly difficult to work with in sketches. That same year, she was also arrested after police discovered cocaine in her purse at a boutique store. She was ordered to six months of counseling. With the pressures of television mounting, the star decided to leave the show in 1977 (the series had her character suddenly leaving town and husband with no notice), and the series was re-titled \"Forever Fernwood.\"\n\nFollowing her \"Mary Hartman\" departure, Louise appeared on stage in productions of Marie and Bruce\" (1980) followed by \"A Couple of a White Chicks Sitting Around Talking.\" She also attempted another ensemble comedy series with the all-female show It's a Living (1980) as waitress Maggie but, once again, left the show after only one season. She also had a recurring neurotic role on the popular medical show Chefarzt Dr. Westphall (1982).\n\nElsewhere, Louise went on to co-star with the equally neurotic Charles Grodin in the offbeat romantic TV-movie comedy Nur ich und du (1978). On film, she made a brief cameo in ex-husband Woody Allen's film dramedy Stardust Memories (1980), appeared as a hooker with a heart of gold in star/director/co-writer Marty Feldman's comedy Dreist und gottesfürchtig (1980), and was a prime focus in the wacky Coen Brothers crime comedy Die Killer-Akademie (1985). She headed the cast as the mother of good/evil twins in the slasher flick Blood Rage (1987), was featured in the Sally Field/Michael Caine romantic comedy Nicht jetzt, Liebling (1987), and was fourth-billed in the teen drama Sing - Die Brooklyn-Story (1989). She finished off the decade in Cheech Marin's hippie comedy Rude Awakening (1989) as an aging drug customer(!)\n\nThe weird and wacky continued with an assortment of off-kiltered characters in independent films. She appeared in the bizarre sci-fi horror Frankenhooker (1990); played Robby Benson's mom in the comedy Love Games (1990), also written and directed by Benson; and played Jeremy Piven's mom in another comedy Layin' Low (1996). She was also featured in the films Sudden Manhattan (1996), Happiness (1998) and Mystery Men (1999).\n\nInto the millennium, she enjoyed a romantic subplot in the film Fast Food Fast Women (2000), portrayed a retired gangster lady in Queenie in Love (2001), played a landlady in the horror opus Wolves of Wall Street (2002). She and Renée Taylor played \"wealthy\" sisters married to losers in the poorly-reviewed comedy Lady Killers (2003), and appeared with Ms. Taylor again in the romantic comedy Driving Me Crazy: Proof of Concept (2012)\n\nMore recently seen on TV episodes of \"CSI\" and \"Girls,\" Louise was once an acting technique teacher with Herbert Berghof's HB Studio. She eventually set up her own acting establishment, the Louise Lasser Acting Studio, on New York City's Upper East Side. In 2014, she directed the Off-Off-Broadway production of \"Chinese Coffee.\" She never remarried after divorcing the Wood Man.\n\nJohn Cleese was born on October 27, 1939, in Weston-Super-Mare, England, to Muriel Evelyn (Cross) and Reginald Francis Cleese. He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, \"The Goon Show,\" starring the legendary Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, and Harry Secombe.\n\nCleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university's legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python Graham Chapman. Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name \"Cambridge Circus.\" When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met Terry Gilliam, another future Python.\n\nReturning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\", based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. He also appeared, briefly, with Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman in At Last the 1948 Show (1967), for television, and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time, some of whom - Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included The Frost Report (1966) and Marty Feldman's program Marty (1968). Eventually, however, the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program, Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969), which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor, and remains influential to this day.\n\nAfter three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python, Cleese left the show, though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come, including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - Die Ritter der Kokosnuß (1975), Das Leben des Brian (1979), Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982), and Der Sinn des Lebens (1983). Cleese and then-wife Connie Booth collaborated in the legendary television series Das verrückte Hotel - Fawlty Towers (1975), as the sharp-tongued, rude, bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay, England. Only a dozen episodes were made, but each is truly hilarious, and he is still closely associated with the program to this day.\n\nMeanwhile Cleese had established a production company, Video Arts, for clever business training videos in which he generally starred, which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies, including in the hit comedy Ein Fisch namens Wanda (1988), in the Harry Potter series, and in the James Bond series as the new Q, starting with James Bond 007 - Die Welt ist nicht genug (1999), in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects, and frequently does commercials.\n\nBesides the infamous Basil Fawlty character, Cleese's other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with Connie Booth and a daughter with his second wife, Barbara Trentham.\n\nEducation and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976, and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor F. Murray Abraham was born on October 24, 1939 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and raised in El Paso, Texas. His father, Fred Abraham, was a Syrian (Antiochian Orthodox Christian) immigrant. His mother, Josephine (Stello) Abraham, was the daughter of Italian immigrants. Born with the first name \"Murray\", he added an \"F.\" to distinguish his stage name.\n\nPrimarily a stage actor, Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in George C. Scott's comedy Der verkehrte Sherlock Holmes (1971). By the mid-1970s, Murray had steady employment as an actor, doing commercials and voice-over work. He can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along with Al Pacino in Sidney Lumet's Serpico (1973), and in television roles including the villain in one third-season episode of Einsatz in Manhattan (1973). His film work of those years also included the roles of a cabdriver in Das Nervenbündel (1975), a mechanic in Die Sunny-Boys (1975), and a police officer in Alle Männer des Präsidenten (1976).\n\nBeyond these small roles, Abraham continued to do commercials and voice-over work for income. But in 1978, he decided to give them up. Frustrated with the lack of substantial roles, Abraham said, \"No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn't do it, then I'd have no right to the dreams I've always had\". His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a \"house husband\". He described, \"I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my macho idea of life. But it was the best thing that ever happened to me\". Abraham appeared as drug dealer Omar Suárez alongside Pacino again in the gangster film Scarface (1983). He also gained visibility voicing a talking bunch of grapes in a series of television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear.\n\nIn 1985, he was honored with as Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for the acclaimed role of envious composer Antonio Salieri in Amadeus (1984), an award for which Tom Hulce, playing Mozart in that movie, had also been nominated. He was also honored with a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama, among other awards, and his role in the film, is still considered to be his most iconic as the film's director Milos Forman inspired the work of the role with Abraham's wide range of qualities as a great stage and film actor.\n\nAfter Amadeus, he next appeared in Der Name der Rose (1986), in which he played Bernardo Gui, nemesis to Sir Sean Connery as William of Baskerville. In the DVD audio commentary, his director on the film, Jean-Jacques Annaud, described Abraham as an \"egomaniac\" on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery, since Connery did not have an Oscar. That said, the film was a critical success. Abraham had tired of appearing as villains and wanted to return to his background in comedy, as he also explained to People Weekly magazine in an interview he gave at the time of its release."
