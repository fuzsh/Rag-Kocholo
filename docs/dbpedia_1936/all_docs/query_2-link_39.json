Paying tribute to our collective musical heritage, the Museum explores and celebrates all aspects of the art form — from the technology of the recording process to the legends who have made lasting marks on our cultural identity.\n\nFor more information, visit www.grammymuseum.org, \"like\" the GRAMMY Museum on Facebook, and follow @GRAMMYMuseum on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nABOUT REYNA ROBERTS\n\nReyna Roberts is a force. The daughter of two Army combat engineers, the Alaska-born & Alabama-raised singer-songwriter has already made her mark in country music, drawing praise from Mickey Guyton, Carrie Underwood, Reba McEntire and more. The 2022 Amazon Music Artist to Watch artist grew up listening to Christina Aguilera, Gretchen Wilson, Beyoncé, and The Chicks. “I can’t remember a moment when I wasn’t singing,” says Roberts, having first taken the stage at a bar in Alaska at the age of 3 to belt “Lady Marmalade.” Roberts has drawn praise for her “raucous” (The New York Times) “banger” (Rolling Stone), “Stompin’ Grounds,” which was featured during ESPN’s Monday Night Football throughout the season, while her “fiery new anthem” (People), “Raised Right,” resonated with fans and critics. A Radio.com “Leading Ladies” honoree, Roberts covered “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin” with Luke Combs and Robert Randolph at the 2021 CMT Giants: Charley Pride. In 2022, she opened for Reba McEntire and made her Stagecoach debut, already having toured with Jamey Johnson, and debuted at Watershed Festival and Summerfest.\n\nABOUT SILVERSUN PICKUPS\n\nBursting out of the Silverlake, California music scene in the early 2000s, Silversun Pickups – lead singer Brian Aubert, bassist Nikki Monninger, drummer Christopher Guanlao, and keyboardist Joe Lester – have maintained their independence throughout their storied career. They released their first three albums on the local label, Dangerbird Records, before founding their own label, New Machine Recordings, for the release of their most recent albums, Widows Weeds and Better Nature. Now almost two decades into their career, they remain a vital and important rock band and have racked up ten Top 20 hits on Billboard’s Alternative Songs chart, as well as over a million records sold in the U.S. The band is working on new music – details to be announced soon.\n\nStay tuned for more information on the public program we will be participating in at the GRAMMY Museum this August.\n\nABOUT LAUREN SPENCER-SMITH\n\nLauren Spencer-Smith will let you know what is on her mind. When she steps up to the microphone, the Vancouver Island singer and songwriter shares the kinds of stories typically only traded by best friends long after the sun goes down. Her unfiltered feelings resonate just as loudly as her stunning vocals do, tracing life’s ups, downs, and everything in between with sharp lyrics and even sharper melodies. Balancing a job, school and teaching herself piano and guitar, she prolifically posted videos to social media. One day, she sang Lady Gaga’s “Always Remember Us This Way” from A Star Is Born in her dad’s truck. The ensuing impromptu clip (filmed by her father) exploded with tens of millions of views on Facebook. “American Idol” invited her to appear on the 2020 season and she placed in the Top 20. Countless songwriting sessions followed as she honed her chops alongside several well-known producers and more independent talent. In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown, she launched her TikTok page with a steady stream of content. She gained traction on streaming platforms with a stunning cover of Olivia Rodrigo’s “All I Want” and originals such as “For Granted” and “Back To Friends.” However, “Fingers Crossed” primed her for a major breakthrough. A smartphone video of Lauren’s unplugged performance of the song set TikTok ablaze, generating over half a billion views on the platform and eclipsing over 100 million streams. After earning acclaim from Billboard, Genius, Stereogum, and more, Lauren properly introduces herself on a series of 2022 singles and her forthcoming full-length debut [Island Records/Republic Records].\n\nLINKS:\n\nFlowers” | https://laurenspencersmith.lnk.to/Flowers\n\n“Fingers Crossed” |https://laurenspencersmith.lnk.to/FingersCrossed\n\n# # #\n\nCONTACTS"
