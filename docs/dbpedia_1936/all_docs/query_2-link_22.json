        "text": "Neil Hamill Park (1904-1986) was one of the first professional Landscape Architects to practice in Arkansas. Park was born on May 12, 1904 to Agnes Hamill Park and Elijah Crane Park in Lansing, Michigan. In 1912 he moved to Parkin, Arkansas when his mother was transferred to manage the Lansing Company.\n\nAfter earning a dual degree in Chemistry and Philosophy at Little Rock College, Park earned a Master’s degree in Landscape Architecture at Cornell University, where he graduated in 1928. While a student at Cornell, Park met influential residential architect and Cornell professor Bryant Fleming. Park worked for Fleming’s firm. With Fleming, Park contributed to significant estates projects including Cheekwood, a Nashville, Tennessee estate which later opened as a botanical garden and museum in 1960.\n\nPark's talents were recognized early in his career. After first having received an honorable mention the previous year, in 1931, Park won the prestigious Rome Prize in Landscape Architecture. After studying in Rome, Italy, in conjunction with the award, Park returned to United States to begin practicing Landscape Architecture in earnest. Park worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority on large public works. In the late 1930s Park established a firm, Highberger and Park, with a partner in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1939, Park started his independent practice which he continued until his retirement.\n\nThe advance of World War II provided Park with government projects in Arkansas. In 1939, Park was the Landscape Architect and Planner on several federal housing projects with a group of Little Rock based architects.\n\nThe geographic shift of his practice and personal changes prompted Parks permanent return to Little Rock, Arkansas in 1943. That year, he married Lois Linbarier, a nurse, of Camden, Arkansas. Together, the couple raised three daughters. Park was active in professional organizations and in the cultural life of Little Rock.\n\nAfter the close of the World War II, Park practiced broadened to include residential, religious and other institutional projects. Park’s residential work included projects for some of Arkansas most prominent citizens of the period including Charles Murphy, Winthrop Rockefeller, and B.T. Fooks.\n\nPark retired from professional practice in 1975. He died February 4th, 1986 in Little Rock, Arkansas."
