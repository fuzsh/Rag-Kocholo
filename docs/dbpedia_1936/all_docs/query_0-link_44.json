Obviously, I became interested in Memphis. But that wasn't the first goal I had in mind,. I made a vacation trip with a friend of mine back in 2016. And, we just took a car and went from New Orleans to Chicago and back and forth. The goal was just to listen to music, discover jazz, blues, gospel, soul, funk. We wanted to go all the way and just stop in bars and listen to music. That was the main goal. And we made so many encounters along the way. I had my camera with me, like I always do. And I kept interviewing some, a lot of people, families, children, grandparents that had a close relationship with music.\n\nAnd every time, what kept coming back was that music was such a great factor for talking about greater things, bigger things, social issues, for instance. And I'm 34 years old; I grew up with hip hop music. As much as I got interested about it, I wanted to learn what it came from. And realizing that what I love the most about it, about music, was the way it kept talking about issues that weren't talked [about] elsewhere. I learned so much with music. I feel like hip hop was part of my education. And so I kept on thinking about those kinds of things.\n\nWe met so many people, so many different people who had a close relationship with music, the same way it touched me back in France. I came back to France, I had a few shots, I had all these interviews. And I asked my producer, okay, would you, would you be willing to give me some money to go back over there with some equipment with a camera operator, sound engineer, and just give us a few weeks, and I'm sure we can find the right place where everything I just talked about is exists, and it's living. It's good. You can feel it, you can even touch it in some way.\n\nMB: And you were able to get the funding on that faith?\n\nHS: Yeah, they were able to find, not so much salaries or anything, but just enough money so we could get there with some equipment. For like five weeks we scoured the whole Mississippi Delta, a lot of it was about blues at that time. It was about Mississippi because that's where I made the most encounters. And, Chandra Williams, who was in the film [Soul Kids], Zelena Ratliff, others, a lot of blues men, blues women in Clarksdale. And we started looking at schools, musical schools. And the rest is history.\n\nMB: That's so interesting. You talked a lot about music and your connection to music, but the film ends up being as much about race in America at this moment as music, if not more so. So. This is a delicate question, but how do you as a white man from Europe handle tackling race in America?\n\nHS: Not so easily, first of all. Yeah, that's the reality of it. I'm not sure I realized how, how important that was when I made the film. That was my first film. And I'm still thinking a lot about all those things. Of course, my position, how legitimate I am. Or I don't feel like I'm telling anything, though, giving my point of view about what I saw. But every word that is said in this film doesn't belong to me. I gave a mic, I gave an opportunity for everyone I met at Stax to have a platform and talk about what they wanted.\n\nI was more afraid about trying to avoid it, when it's so real, and present in the school. Every day, in every class, there is some kind of bridge made between music and social issues, racial issues. I thought that it would, to me, it would have been even more tricky to avoid it. And I don't even feel like I was pointing to America when I made this film. Because when I came back to France, I saw the same thing. Yeah. And my next film is about the exact same thing in Paris,\n\nMB: In Paris?\n\nHS: Yeah. Meaning that it goes beyond my view about America. And trying to make a film about Black Lives Matter, that wasn't my goal. But I found when you were in this classroom, when everything is talked about, that's the beauty of it. Avoiding it would have been horrible to me, like saying, \"Okay, I just want to see one part of you, please don't talk about this.”\n\nMB: You said, this is so much about education for you?\n\nHS: Yeah, to me [it is] one of the main goals of the film. I've had this conversation after screenings in France, at a lot of Q&As people are asking me, \"OK, so it's really complicated in the US with all those race problems.\" And I'm like, \"This is what you got from the film? This is the first thing you get from the film?\" Like, in France, the way we're taught about music or art, and the way it's perceived is either: it's success or it's failure.\n\nMB: It's art removed from life?\n\nHS: Yeah, absolutely. And from a horizontal dialogue. What I've learned at Stax is how important it is. Kortland has this scene where he talks to the kids saying, trying to build down what is writing a song, like how easy it can be, how natural it can be. And to me, he doesn't even talk as a teacher. And to me, he’s just an artist with ten more years of experience talking with other artists, not looking down on them, instead looking at them at the same level. And to me, if a French audience, a French white audience can understand those kinds of things, and understand how art could be a bridge to so many things.\n\nWhat I hope is that the French audience, for instance, can see the film can ask the question, okay, how can we take something about the way education is being brought at STAX and how we can not only teach the kids, for instance, to play music, but to learn how to position themselves as an artist, as a musician in society in general, and learn what kind of impact, what kind of platform you can build for yourself.\n\nMB: Oh, I see. You would like to see art education in France be more…\n\nHS: Horizontal, like cross. When in France, it's like if you make music, you can't act. Right? If you write, you can't direct. And that's one example.\n\nMB: I see. It's very hierarchical.\n\nHS: Pyramid. Yeah. And that's a mistake. I think it's a mistake. And especially when you, when you talk to a younger generation that aspires to do great things and want to work. Everything is open, and the way you can educate yourself while having fun with it is a great lesson. I mean, this is the best way.\n\nMB: And become a better person and citizen.\n\nHS: Yeah, exactly. And that's what's gonna help you become a better musician also.\n\nMB: Very true. A visual choice you did that I'm interested in is the sky. There are a lot of shots of where there is a lot of open sky. What was that choice about?\n\nHS: The sky is about...the sky.. First of all, we never wanted to look down on them with the camera. It was always at their level, or… [gestures]\n\nMB: Or below.\n\nHS: Yeah, because we wanted to give the feel that they're powerful. And they are like, the way I saw them wasn't like, \"I'm a kid, I'm looking at you.\" I was really looking at them like this. You know, mentally even though they were shorter than me––not so much shorter than me because I'm short. Spiritually, I was looking at them like this, and I wanted the viewer to see, to see them like this. So, that's the first thing and the sky above. Sky's the limit. You have so much room to grow because you're allowing yourself to have that space above your head.\n\nThat was kind of a thought that we had with our crew one night. You know, it was like they could, they could fly higher. Like they could have wings. It's kind of mushy, what I'm saying right now, but that's how we felt. Because it's so much energy. Like, you have to imagine spending three hours every day over there and going home after and singing and having the same energy. They gave us so much energy that we're thinking about it constantly. Like how can we give them power? Visually, how can we empower them? And the sky above their head was kind of our answer about this.\n\nSOUL KIDS (Memphis Premiere + Performance)\n\n📅 Saturday, March 26 @ 7:00PM\n\n📍 Crosstown Theater\n\n🎟️: Tickets on sale HERE\n\n2021 Sundance Film Festival Will Meet Audiences Where They Are\n\nFestival Offers Robust Online Platform and Announces Screening Partnerships with Independent Cinemas and Cultural Organizations\n\nPARK CITY, UTAH — The nonprofit Sundance Institute today unveiled plans for the seven-day 2021 Sundance Film Festival, offered digitally via a custom-designed online platform (festival.sundance.org) alongside drive-ins, independent arthouses, and a network of local community partnerships. The online expression of the Sundance Film Festival will provide global access for storytellers and audiences alike to come together, experience artists new work, connect with one another, and participate in conversation. All films in the program will be available online in the United States, with certain films opting for global availability. The full talks and events program, as well as the New Frontier section for XR and emerging media, will be available globally. The Festival runs January 28 through February 2, 2021.\n\n“Even under these impossible circumstances artists are still finding paths to make bold and vital work in whatever ways they can,” says Tabitha Jackson, in her first year as Festival Director. “So Sundance, as a festival of discovery, will bring that work to its first audiences in whatever ways we can. The core of our Festival in the form of an online platform and socially distanced cinematic experiences is responsive to the pandemic and gives us the opportunity to reach new audiences, safely, where they are. And thanks to a constellation of independent cinema communities across the U.S. we are not putting on our Festival alone. At the heart of all this is a belief in the power of coming together, and the desire to preserve what makes a festival unique -- a collaborative spirit, a collective energy, and a celebration of the art, artists, and ideas that leave us changed.”\n\n“Our Festival footprint has changed this year, but we are excited to bring an incredible community together in new ways to engage with new artists and new stories -- whether they’re joining us for the first year or have been for decades,” said Sundance Institute Executive Director Keri Putnam. “Our ambition is for everyone to come together, safely, wherever they may be, and participate in screenings on our platform at the same time. The Sundance team has consulted with artists, worked with incredible partners, and built a plan to welcome new audiences and capture a true Festival spirit.”\n\nFEATURE FILMS\n\nAs at past Sundance Film Festivals, films will premiere throughout the day, with Day One films set to debut Thursday, January 28, at 6 p.m. U.S. Mountain Time. During the 2021 Festival, each of the 70+ feature films will premiere online in a dedicated time slot, followed by a live Q&A. Multiple films will premiere simultaneously roughly every three hours from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. U.S. Mountain Time. This rollout is designed to preserve the energy of a Festival, with an abundance of choices and collective experiences, as audiences can begin the film simultaneously, and participate in the live Q&A which follows (viewers can also begin films any time within three hours of their premiere’s start). All films will return to the platform two days after their premiere for a “second screening,” offered on demand for 24 hours. The platform’s movie player is powered by Shift72 and developed with best-in-industry security and access practices. In a Festival first, the entire 70+-feature lineup on the platform will be closed-captioned on demand, and Q&As will be live-captioned.\n\nSHORT FILM, INDIE SERIES PROGRAMS\n\nThe Short Film and Indie Series (formerly Indie Episodic) programs, focused on creative storytelling outside the feature format, will include 50 short films and world premieres of four episodic works. These will be available on demand on the Festival platform for the full length of the Festival.\n\nNEW FRONTIER\n\nSince its launch, the Sundance Film Festival’s New Frontier has served as a showcase for dynamic, innovative work at the crossroads of film, art, and technology -- and 2021 is no exception, with 14 works in the program. For the first time ever, adventurous audiences around the world will be given the chance to engage with the works, the artists, and each other via a bespoke virtual platform, accessible via computer and VR headsets. The New Frontier Gallery hosts the complete slate of live performances, AR, VR, and other emerging media works. Cinema House is the Festival’s fully immersive, big-screen theater, and Film Party is an interactive social space where the entire community of accredited Festivalgoers can safely gather together again. The environment also features interactive tools such as proximity audio and video chat.\n\nSATELLITE SCREENS\n\nExpanding beyond its Utah home, the Festival has created a network of partnerships to bring feature films and customized local programming -- talks, events, artist meet-ups -- to communities across the country. In addition to these Satellite Screen partnerships, the Institute will program screenings at The Ray in Park City and the Rose Bowl and Mission Tiki Drive-Ins in Los Angeles, health and safety guidelines permitting. Each Satellite Screen will create and host their own events, sharing local cultural conversations with broader Festival audiences, with most also screening selections from the 2021 program.\n\n“These partners are the backbone of independent artistic communities across the country, where filmmakers are born and cinephiles are developed,” said Jackson. “We’re entering these partnerships because a healthy ecosystem for artists and audiences requires that independent cinemas across the country survive and thrive.”\n\nProgramming details for films at these screens will be available when the program is announced later this month, and these plans will evolve in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic health and safety guidelines.

This year, that will take place on the platform’s Festival Village, a free-to-all space where Satellite Screens, partners, and Festival sponsors will host a wide range of events, programming, and offerings to complement and enrich the official program. The platform’s Main Street will act as both an homage to the iconic Park City thoroughfare and as an extension of the Festival’s core programming, featuring digital partner spaces hosting conversations, musical performances, and more. The Artist Lounge will feature a space for creators to gather for artist programming, as well as for the Festival’s Class of ’21 to network and celebrate at private events.\n\nTICKETING DETAILS\n\nTickets and passes for those who want to experience the Festival for the full run, a single day, or a single screening will be available to the general public beginning January 7; further details will be available later this month.
