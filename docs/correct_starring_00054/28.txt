Olivia d’Abo Instagram – Thinking of my amazing mama today, on her birthday 🎂 ❤️🎂 Though she’s no longer with us, I want to celebrate her greatness, her incredible force of nature, her strength and beauty inside and out and all the incredible love and devotion she showered upon my brother and I. She truly made me the woman I am today and made the world a funnier, wiser and more beautiful place to be in ❤️🙏💪🏽 Here’s one of my favorite classic photos of Maggie London in the Beatles film “A hard days night“ dancing her heart away and flirting outrageously with George Harrison! Miss you and love you so Ma! Happy birthday 🎂 ❤️🙏 and a very happy weekend friends ! | Posted on 06/Aug/2022 04:44:34
