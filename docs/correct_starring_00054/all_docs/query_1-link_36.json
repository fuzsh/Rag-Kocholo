        "text": "20 minute film of Audience reactions to Tigers:\n\nPRESS CONFERENCE at the San Sebastian Film Festival,25th September 2014.\n\nThis press conference features the the Director, Danis Tanovic, producers Andy Paterson, Prashita Chaudhary and protagonists – Syed Aamir Raza and Dr Emmanuel Diamond – who had just seen the film for the first time. Scroll across for the correct language.\n\nTRAILER FOR THE SAN SEBASTIAN SCREENING OF TIGERS https://www.sansebastianfestival.com/secciones_y_peliculas/7/620491/in\n\nNote: A BBC Films/UK Film Council version of the film was halted weeks before production; with defamation laws operating as ‘guilty until proven innocent’ the huge potential costs of defending a true story in court meant that a transnational company could prevent a true story being told simply by virtue of its deep pockets. A few years later Indian producers Prashita Chaudhary and Guneet Monga finally made the film possible.\n\nIrish Examiner\n\nA standing ovation and rapturous applause greeted Syed Aamir Raza, as he joined the panel of experts, following a recent private screening of the emotive and powerful movie Tigers.

The International Code Documentation Centre (ICDC) is part of the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN).\n\nPrevious reports, including Breaking the Rules 2014 report are also available, profiling 23 formula and feeding bottle and teat companies.\n\nIrresponsible marketing undermines breastfeeding. Breastfeeding saves lives – and could save more. A breastfed child is less likely to suffer from gastroenteritis, respiratory and ear infections, diabetes, allergies and other illnesses. In areas with unsafe water a bottle-fed child is up to 25 times more likely to die as a result of diarrhoea.\n\nEstimates in 2013 suggest 11.6% of under-5 deaths could be prevented by breastfeeding. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says: ‘Globally, breastfeeding has the potential to prevent about 800,000 under-five deaths per year if all children 0–23 months were optimally breastfed.’\n\nBaby Milk Action acted as one of the Consultants to the film makers. We are confident that the story they will tell will shine a light on the baby milk issue and the power of corporations, and we encourage everyone to see it.\n\nPlease explore our website to learn more about the way baby food companies push infant formula and other products – and find out what you can do to help protect babies and their families."
