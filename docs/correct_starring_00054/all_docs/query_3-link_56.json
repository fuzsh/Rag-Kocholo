        "text": "As the world entered the 21st century, Bond films were in danger of becoming irrelevant again; as new, somewhat more sophisticated spy dramas were starting to emerge with more elaborate action sequences than the typical Bond film such as Tom Cruises’s Mission Impossible series, and Matt Damon’s Jason Bourne series and non-spy action movies such as the Matrix had set a new standard for kinetic action sequences. In addition, the James Bond tropes were parodied in the Austin Powers films.\n\nWith “The World Is Not Enough” a box office success but a critical dud, people were wondering if Bond was still relevant. Eventually, he would be-in 2006’s Casino Royale-but before that happened, there was one more Brosnan Bond to go-and a film that pretty much is the end of the series’s 40-year, if somewhat loose-continuity.\n\n“Die Another Day” attempts to be kind of high-tech and hip, with then relative newcomer Halle Berry (Fresh off her oscar for “Monster’s Ball”) but it doesn’t quite work, especially with Pierce Brosnan now nearly into his 50s and other missteps. I’ll get into those a bit later.\n\nDie Another Day pretty much tries to change things up pretty much right away. Although the music is perhaps the most traditional of Brosnan’s gunbarrels (Which mostly started mid-Bond theme) and of course uses the same stock footage of Brosnan posing from Goldeneye, there’s one very noticeable change. Bond actually shoots a CGI bullet directly into the chamber of the other gun!\n\nWe then open with Bond sneaking into North Korea via stealthy surfing with some Asian agents to capture and impersonate a guy trying to use diamonds to buy weapons from a corrupt North Korean, Col.Moon. Bond booby-traps the Diamonds with C4, hoping to take out the Colonel.\n\nUnfortunately, Bond’s cover is blown by a mole who sends Moon’s henchman Zao his real identify before he successfully completes his mission, and leads to a pretty decent hovercraft fight between himself and Moon, which apparently ends with Moon’s death-but Bond in the hands of North Korean forces, including Moon’s father.\n\nThis leads to Bond spending a year and two months(!) in prison, continuously being tortured. Then the controversial Madonna song kicks in with several images of ice, fire, and electricity themed women, similar in some ways to the opening of “View to a Kill” (but with the imagery far more relevant here).\n\nThe music-like a lot of Madonna’s work around this time, has sort of a more electronic/dance/techno feel than a real Bond theme. It doesn’t really seem to reference Bond himself here, just the title. It’s got some strange lyrics too (“Sigmund Frued….Analyze this!Analyze this! Analyze this, this this etc.”) It’s worth noting though that the visuals continue to show Bond’s imprisonment and torture through it all, the first time in a Bond film where the story unfolds during the opening credits.\n\nBond is finally released-initially it’s believed for his execution, but instead it turns out to be a prisoner exchange-for Zao. It’s here we’re also introduced to American NSA agent Falco (Michael Madsen) who doesn’t exactly have a high opinion of Bond (If the Jinx spin-off materialized, or if Brosnan did more Bond films, he reportedly would’ve been in more films)\n\nHowever, he’s not exactly welcomed back with open arms by MI6-as M believes he’s been leaking secrets, which Bond insists is the work of a mole. Stripped of his licence to kill by M, Bond once again goes rogue (by faking cardiac arrest, and using the defibrillators as weapons!).\n\nIn one of the film’s more hilarious scenes, he walks into a Hong Kong hotel and demands his ‘usual suite’ despite not exactly in the best clothes and sporting 14 months worth of beard.\n\nGetting cleaned up and back to his usual standards, he starts to hunt for Zao, following a lead to Cuba. Here Bond meets with sleeper agent Raoul (A bond ally who in appearance and his role, is somewhat similar to Kerim Bey and Columbo from the earlier films, but with considerably less screen time), who gives him some clues as to Zao’s whereabouts-An offshore clinic where questionable plastic surgeries are performed.\n\nAt a hotel nearby, he meets Jinx, who debuts in a similar fashion to Honey Ryder’s debut in Dr.No-one of the film’s many callbacks to Bond’s past (This was not only the 20th Bond film, but also the 40th anniversary film as well). After some somewhat embarrassing innuendo, even by Bond standards, and a night spent together, they both separately head to the clinic-but it appears they both the same goal in mind-the capture of Zao.\n\nIt seems Zao is undergoing surgery to change his appearance into a British man, as Jinx discovers, while Bond himself confronts Zao. Unfortunately, Zao-only halfway through his surgery-escapes, and Jinx pretty much destroys the clinic, leaving Bond a bit perplexed as to her intentions-but Bond is able to gain a valuable clue-diamonds in Zao’s possession, which belong to the Graves corporation in Iceland-although Bond is quick to notice that the diamonds are very similar to African conflict diamonds.\n\nBond returns to London to investigate Graves, which leads to the intro of both Graves (Toby Stephens) and his publicist, Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike, in an early role for her). Here we go to the Blades club, where we also meet instructor Verity-Madonna, in a cameo role. She isn’t there long, but of course there’s some goofy innuendo. Strangely, Madonna doesn’t use the British accent she sometimes uses in interviews, although she’s in a scene that’s set in London, England.\n\nAs for Graves, I think he’s actually a fairly decent bad guy, and plays off of Brosnan well. He comes across as a bit petulant and whiny, but I think that’s part of what was intended for the character to be (and a bit of a facade as we find out later). Toby Stephens by the way, is the son of British actress Maggie Smith, of Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and Clash of the Titans fame.\n\nThe sword fight scene that follows is actually a pretty decent action scene, and pretty intense and easy to follow, unlike the action scenes in it’s predecessor film, The World Is Not Enough.\n\nBond being back in London naturally grabs M’s attention, who is also investigating Graves; and finally lets Bond back on his job since he’s “become useful again”.\n\nWe then get a sequence with Bond readying his weapon inside MI6, but it turns out that it’s been infiltrated by armed men, Moneypenny is dead, and M is being held hostage! However, it all turns to be a ruse, a VR simulation being used to set up the Q scene. Unfortunately, it’s not the only piece of unbelievable technology we see here.\n\nWhile the glass-breaking ring and the callbacks to older gadgets (The Thunderball Jetpack, Rosa Klebb’s poison knife shoes and the Octopussy crocodile sub) are pretty cool, we’re then introduced to the Aston Martin Vanquish/”Vanish” which has a nearly flawless cloaking device, making it effectively invisible! Also in this-Cleese’s only full Q scene-we get not one, but two references to Cleese’s Monty Python days-first by Bond mentioning a “flesh wound” (a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail), and second, Cleese’s legs visibly distort when walking behind the Vanquish, a visual nod to his “Ministry of Silly Walks” sketch.\n\nBond then heads to Grave’s ice palace and diamond mine in Iceland, at a party to demonstrate a new device called “Icarus”, and also catches up with Jinx again.Here we learn a few things about Graves, that he’s a thrill seeker, an insomniac, and is actually Col.Moon (Although Bond doesn’t fully realize it until later). His diamond mine is in fact, fake-the diamonds he is ‘mining’, as Bond suspected, are in fact just branded African conflict diamonds. He unveils Icarus, a satellite that can focus sunlight-he states for agricultural purposes, but actually his real intent is to use it to destroy the mines among Korea’s demilitarized zones so North Korea can invade South Korea. It’s yet another callback, this time to the Diamond Satellite in Diamonds Are Forever (although unlike that particular satellite and the presence of diamonds in the plot, Icarus doesn’t actually seem to use Diamonds as it’s focus; although the conflict diamonds are probably used to fund it)\n\nAfter a botched attempt at infiltration, Bond spends a night with Frost, who is actually an MI6 agent. However, he makes a bit of an error here, by letting her have his Walther gun for a few seconds….\n\nJinx’s attempt is a bit more successful, but she ends up being captured, and now we have a Goldfinger reference (although the laser is headed toward her head rather than…umm…lower as was the case with Goldfinger and Bond). There’s also some pretty poor dialogue here, in particular a “Yo momma” joke from Jinx….\n\nBond sucessfully infiltrates a second time (using two previous gadgets-Goldeneye’s laser watch and the Thunderball rebreather) and finds Jinx, but gets interrupted by the henchman Mr. Kil, and then one laser becomes several. After defeating Mr. Kil thanks to a timely laser from Jinx and freeing her, Bond then confronts Moon/Graves, and of course say the title line.\n\n“So you live to die another day…Colonel.”\n\nUnfortunately for Bond, Graves reveals the mole who botched his earlier mission in the first place-it was Frost all along-and now he’s got no ammo. But he does have the ring, and makes an escape attempt using one of Graves’s extreme sports vehicle, a sort of rocket-sled thing-while also trying to evade Icarus’s concentrated sun beam melting the glacier he’s on.\n\nUnfortunately this also leads to one of the goofiest, fakest looking Bond scenes of all time, with Bond improvising a surfboard from the remains of the sled….yep. While the surfing that opened the film was kind of cool, this is just awful, right up there with Roger Moore in the opening of View To A kill. At least that was done with more practical effects and stuntmen, while this just looks fake, with a clearly CG Bond on CG water and ice.\n\nThankfully, it’s quickly followed by a pretty awesome car chase between the Aston Martin and Zao’s Jaquar. The car is in fact not invisible for most of the chase, and what’s also interesting is that both cars are armed with gadgets. While villains such as Scaramanga have had gadgets before, this is really the first time Bond and the bad guy have been kind of evenly matched-although Bond finally getting the invisibility back at the end of the chase is a bit of a cheat.\n\nRescuing Jinx again, Bond and Jinx go to Korea where they sneak aboard Grave’s plane in an attempt to disable Icarus and take out Graves and Frost. Meanwhile, we’re also treated to some Tomorrow Never Dies stock footage, as a missile launch identical to the one from that beginning of the film tries to take out Icarus another way to no avail. It’s one of the rare instances where they use stock footage apart from the gunbarrel and title sequences, but it’s still a bit glaring especially since it was only used two films ago.\n\nThere’s an attempt at pathos as Graves is reunited with his father, who is disgusted by what has happened to his son and what he intends to do. However, it’s a bit hard to take the scene seriously, especially with Graves’s goofy exosuit.\n\nWhile Jinx has a pretty good decent fight with Miranda, Bond takes on Graves, who dies pretty much Goldfinger-style by being sucked out a plane (although then he dies Incredibles style by being sucked into a jet engine)-which in turns shuts down Icarus (although as was the case with the Diamond Satellite in DAF, it’s still stuck up there in space, just turned off).\n\nThe film then kind of ends with Moneypenny using the VR glasses in kind of a goofy joke scene, and then more bad innuendo as Bond and Jinx relax with the Diamonds….\n\nDie Another Day has some strengths. It’s got some fantastic action sequences and the first half of the film before Bond goes to Iceland isn’t too bad, and even plays with the Bond formula a bit. However, it’s kind of then overwhelmed by too many obvious references to past Bond films, really cringe-worthy dialogue, and an overload of CG where past Bond films relied on more practical effects and stunts, even for their more outrageous sequences.\n\nIt brings an end to the original Bond movie continuity pretty much, as the Craig films-while still paying homage to the past (Most notably with the Aston Martin cars and of course the theme) would pretty much reinvent the mythology with new takes on Bond’s backstory, how he became who he was, and his supporting cast, whereas up to this point although the actors changed, such changes were not really aknowledged in the films (Apart from “This Never happened to the other fella” in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, but that’s debatable).\n\nBrosnan I felt was a good Bond, but unfortunately at times was let down by the material. I think perhaps the producers got a bit overconfident and went too far once “Goldeneye” was a success, and sort of went back to the excesses of the Roger Moore era, and this kind of hurt Brosnan. Even though “Die Another Day” was a financial success, the critical reviews were savage, and many agreed it was time for a change to the series.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy 1999, Pierce Brosnan had been established in the role of James Bond with two hits, “Goldeneye” and “Tomorrow Never Dies”. While “Goldeneye” took a look at Bond’s place in a cold-war world, and Tomorrow Never Dies was a somewhat more traditional, action-packed Bond film, the next film, “The World Is Not Enough”-named after Bond’s family motto from “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service”-would attempt to form a fusion of the two, with some mixed results.\n\nFor the film, they got celebrated British drama and documentary filmmaker Michael Apted, well known at this point for “Gorillas In The Mist” “Coal Miner’s daughter” and the “7 up” documentary series. Apted would bring an interesting dramatic touch to this installment.\n\nWorld Is Not Enough begins with what was at the time, the longest of the Bond pre-credits sequences-after a short Spanish sequence-in which we get what I believe is one of the only gunbarrels to open on Bond himself-uncharacteristically in glasses no less-to set up the plot, we get Bond arriving at a briefing only for MI6 to come under attack (killing a friend of M’s, industrialist Robert King), leading to a chase on the Thames that is similar in a few ways to Goldeneye’s tank chase, involving civilians, landmarks and police caught in the chaos. We even get a nod to that scene with Brosnan even straightening his tie!\n\nBond unexpectedly for a pre-credit sequence-mostly fails his mission, as the female villain decides to end her own life by destroying a hot air balloon, an act which injures Bond’s shoulder as he gets it caught in part of the Millennium Dome in order to escape the explosion.\n\nThis time, the theme of the opening credits is “oil”, and we get a nice title song by Shirley Manson/Garbage. In my opinion, it’s the best of Brosnan’s Bond intro songs, although the film’s mix of it leaves out the important lyric “There’s no point in living if you can’t feel alive”.\n\nWe then go to Scotland, where the funeral is held and where MI6 has set up a temporary HQ. Bond, due to his shoulder injury, gets sidelined, but is eventually cleared when he makes a move on MI6’s Doctor. We also get the last Desmond Llewellyn Q scene (as Desmond died shortly after the film’s premiere), and it’s an apt scene that works in that Q is retiring, and it’s unfortunately timely. It also serves to introduce his replacement played by John Cleese, although Cleese would only stick around for the next film before the Casino Royale reboot. There’s also sort of more of the nice kind of friendly exchange between 007 and Q that we saw in Goldeneye, with Cleese providing more of the insults this time.\n\nAlthough introduced as a strict boss in Goldeneye, and with not much done with her in Tomorrow Never Dies, we have here Judi Dench’s first chance to really shine as the new M, especially as she was getting a lot of press around this time for her role in “Shakespeare in Love”. Here, Bond wonders if her personal feelings towards her dead friend and his heiress daughter Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) are somehow clouding her judgement, and we see some more of the slightly antagonistic relationship between the two that we saw in Goldeneye (but pretty much absent from TND) which continues in the next film,and which was pretty much the norm for her during the Craig era as well.\n\nBond figures out that Renard-an anarchist who had kidnapped Elektra a few years back-is beyond King’s death and the attack on MI6, and he’s a man who can feel no pain due to a bullet lodged in his skull that’s slowly killing him. Bond is assigned to be Elektra’s bodyguard and also figure out where Renard is.\n\nBond and Elektra’s relationship is initially cold at first, and we also get what appears to be a ‘sort of’ reference to Bond’s dead wife Tracy (When Bond dodges the question about losing a loved one, although it could also refer to his parents). After the two go skiing, we get an action sequence in which Bond fights some para-hawks. Unfortunately, this illustrates one of the film’s problems. While Apted is great at directing the film’s dramatic scenes, his action scenes seem kind of clumsy and awkwardly edited, although the music by David Arnold is pretty good.\n\nNext we get a casino scene and the return of Goldeneye’s Valentin Zukovsky, now a “legitimate” Casino owner and Cavier seller instead of running a shady nightclub. It’s an amusing sequence with Robbie Coltrane playing more of his comedy skills than in Goldeneye, and his character is far less bulldogish than that film, even advising James to relax! Although not quite the same, it’s a fun role, and recalls similar Bond allies such as Kerim Bey and Columbo (and Raoul in the next film).\n\nHere we also get some hints that Elektra’s not quite what she appears to be as she somewhat recklessly bets at the table.\n\nBond’s convinced that there’s a mole in Elektra’s organization-and he’s right-as he starts to figure things out, even as he and Elektra become closer together. He’s able to finally track Renard and his men to a nuclear disposal site. In both this scene and a slightly earlier one, Robert Carlyle comes off as kind of scary and sadistic, willing to off his own men to keep Bond away.\n\nHowever, we’re also introduced here to Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) who although not as bad as some of the more helpless Bond girls, doesn’t really make much of an impact, especially with Sophie Marceau’s excellent performance as Elektra. She pretty much just plays the ‘good’ Bond girl with some scientific expertise and that’s it.\n\nDuring this scene, Bond starts to get more clues that Elektra isn’t quite who she appears to be, as Renard seems to know about his injuries and her motto.\n\nRenard escapes with a nuke, and Bond tries to confront Elektra about the real connection between her and Renard, but unfortunately they’re called away as Renard appears to threaten her oil pipeline with a nuke. Here we learn Elektra’s true intentions-that she actually did kill her father with Renard’s help, and she kidnaps M. Bond, in a meanwhile, figures out that the nuke isn’t in the pipeline (just a smaller explosive) and fakes his death so he could figure out more of what she’s up to.\n\nTurns out her plan is to destroy the pipeline near Istanbul, leaving her with a monopoly on her own Oil pipeline. Here we see her interact with Renard, in some interesting scenes which actually have Renard be sort of more uncertain about himself, with her actually being the main diabolical mastermind. She’s actually the main Bond villain! We also see her face off against M, but fortunately M’s resourcefulness-and a locator chip Bond gave her in a previous scene-help 007 to locate her, and Elektra’s base of operations.\n\nBond tries to figure out what Valentin knows (although he helped with parts of her plan, she was unaware of her true insanity and endgame) and we do get a fairly exciting, if once again, confusingly edited action sequence with some dodgy CG at Valentin’s cavier factory. We also get some car action, but like “Goldeneye” the car is kind of wasted. This time literally. The highlight of this scene is David Arnold’s score, which has a rousing version of the Bond theme along with his action cues.\n\nWe then go to Istanbul, and the final confrontation where Bond is captured, and there’s a tense sequence where Bond is put on the ‘rack’ and it’s a sort of weird torture/seduction scene as she monologues her plan.\n\nWhen Bond finally escapes due to Valentin’s timely-but fatal-intervention, we get a scene where Bond rescues M and finally confronts Elektra, who has pretty much gone full barking mad, thinking Bond would hesitate to kill her, and we get one of the best Brosnan Bond lines ever, if not one of the best Bond lines ever- “I never miss!”\n\nThen it’s the final submarine fight, which once again is kind of a confusing mess, unfortunately. Although the final fight between Bond and Renard is pretty decent.\n\nThe film then ends with one of the Bond in a compromising romantic position ending, one of the most infamous for reasons I’d rather not write here.\n\nOverall, “World Is Not Enough” is a flawed Bond film, one that has some really great dramatic scenes, one of David Arnold’s best Bond scores,and an interesting concept for the villain-as well as more screen time and an active role in the plot for Judi Dench’s M-but it is let down by some poor casting choices (Denise Richards) and the action directing not being the best (when it’s a must in a Bond film).\n\nIt’s interesting also that certain elements of the film-an attack on MI6, Bond being badly injured, M having a large role in the plot, particularly the role of the villain-bear quite a few similarities to 2012’s Skyfall, the 50th anniversary film with Daniel Craig. But I’ll cross that bridge a few reviews later.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAfter Brosnan’s debut in “Goldeneye”-a critical and financial success-a sequel was quickly commissioned. However, while “Goldeneye” looked at a post-Cold war world and Bond’s place in it, TND would largely go a more traditional route, complete with an over-the-top villain, and nuclear war once again in the cards (apart from Goldeneye’s more simple revenge/stealing scheme). However, the villain isn’t doing it for money, forcing people to move into the sea or into space, but for television ratings. The plot-which sees Bond teaming up with an agent from a rival power-is somewhat similar to The Spy Who Loved Me, and like the Roger Moore films, borrows a lot from film trends of the time, in particular the Asian action films of director John Woo, and stars Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Michelle Yeoh. The last one, in particular, is one of the stars of the film.\n\nThere’s even a parallel with the opening gunbarrel-it uses a somewhat different arrangement of the theme tune usually used, similar to “Spy Who Loved Me” in that regard. The film opens with an arms bazaar, where Bond is simply observing and collecting recon for the British and Russian forces, who are observing from what seems to be a much bigger version of the situation room. We also meet Robinson (Colin Salmon), who will appear in the next two Brosnan films, and serves a role similar to Tanner in the other films, as M’s right hand (Although Tanner does appear in World Is Not Enough as well).\n\nUnfortunately, Admiral Roebuck-played by Judi Dench’s sitcom co-star Geoffrey Palmer-decides to launch a missile strike instead of sending troops in, which turns out to be a bad idea when Bond reveals that one of the planes at the site has nukes-and if the cruise hits them, it will set off a detonation, killing Bond and causing massive radiation problems for Russia.\n\nHere we’re also introduced to one of the film’s henchman-Gupta-played by magician and actor Ricky Jay-who has an encoder stolen from the CIA that will figure into the plot later on.\n\nBond scrambles into action in order to get himself and the jet out of the bazaar-in a spectacular action sequence with a lot of explosions and a stirring score by David Arnold. Arnold-also well known for his scores on the Stargate and Independence Day films-will stick with the series until Quantum of Solace, and also work on several other Bond-related scores. Here, we first hear the instrumental version of K.D Lang’s Surrender-a classic sounding Bond theme, but one that’s unfortunately only stuck on the end credits in it’s lyrical form. He also does a strong version of the Bond theme as well, although some think he uses it almost a bit too much.\n\nBond eventually gets the plane out of the blast zone, but even then he has to deal with a reluctant co-pilot trying to garrote him and another plane that’s trying to shoot him down. Fortunately he’s able to eject the garrotter into the other plane, causing it to spin out of control, and quips that he’s accomplished the mission-and scored two nukes to boot.\n\nThen we get to the opening titles, which unfortunately have a fairly weak Sheryl Crow song. Crow’s a good singer but the tone of this song doesn’t really seem as Bondish to me, especially compared to “Surrender”. Like Goldeneye, this one mixes real girls with CG and the film’s media plot, including a somewhat surreal ‘circuit board’ girl.\n\nNext up we have another Bond trope, where a British ship is attacked/stolen/compromised in some other fashion thing. In this case, a confrontation between a British ship and two Chinese MIGS-the British ship apparently having wondered into China’s waters despite it’s own stating it’s still in international waters (due to Gupta’s encoder)-is escalated by a stealth ship firing a drill missile at the ship-sinking it-and a missile at the MIGS-and then the British survivors are killed and the ship’s nuke stolen-framing both sides, who never saw the stealth ship.\n\nThis third party operation-along with Gupta-is coordinated by Stamper-another Red Grant type of henchman-aboard the ship…\n\nBut it’s later revealed that it’s in fact being coordinated by Eliot Carver, leader of the Carver News Network. Unlike “Goldeneye” which initially makes you wonder about the identity of the true villain (Unless you saw the theatrical trailer which gave it away), TND pretty much gets it over with right away, like a good deal of other Bond films.\n\nDespite raised tensions over the incident in Britain, Carver makes two slip-ups-his encoded signal is picked up by MI6, and his newspaper leaks details unknown to Naval intelligence about the incident. M, of course, assigns Bond to the case.\n\nInteresting thing about Dench’s M here, she’s a bit toned down from Goldeneye, saving most of her rancor for Admiral Roebuck rather than 007 (She even sort of tells a dirty joke with a raised eyebrow). However, she’ll still have tension with the agent in the next two Brosnan films, and of course in the first three Craigs as well. She tells him to use his relationship with Paris Carver-One of Bond’s many ex’s but now Carver’s wife-to help find out what’s going on. Here’s a slight similarity with Goldeneye-another ghost from Bond’s past figures into the plot.\n\nBond gets set up to Hamburg, where we get our Q scene with Q introducing a car. That’s actually sort of a second “sort of” gadget scene, but I’ll write about that when I get to the relevant part.\n\nThe new BMW-which has a voice interface, remote control and of course many other gadgets-more than makes up for the Goldeneye Car which pretty much does nothing. But once again, not yet.\n\nBond arrives at the party, where we meet both Bond girls, Paris (Teri Hatcher) and Wei Lin (Michelle Yeoh) and Bond and Elliot sort of size up each other. Teri’s performance isn’t the best here-she was mainly known at this point for TV guest roles (Most notably Seinfeld) and Lois Lane on the Superman TV series “Lois And Clark”), and she seems to be a bit out of her depth here.\n\nBond of course quickly gets into fisticuffs in a funny fight scene where he uses several musical instruments from a studio to subdue Carver’s thugs. Later, Paris runs to him and they renew their relationship, with him getting vital intel on where the encoder might be.\n\nThis leads to a lengthy series of action sequences with Bond infiltrating Carver’s building and recovering the encoder, and also realizing that Wei Lin might be more than she appears when she joins in the action. Wei Lin one-ups Bond with her fancy gadgets as well.\n\nUnfortunately Paris is killed by one of Carver’s other henchman, a skilled and sadistic killer, but one with a bit of a campy performance by Vincent Schivalli, a guy known for playing oddball roles in quite a few TV shows and films.\n\nHe’s undone when Stamper needs Bond’s help getting into his car to retake the encoder, and Bond’s booby-trapped cellphone stuns Kauffman enough for Bond to finish him. Then we get a fun action sequence as Bond takes control of the BMW via remote control, and unleashes a formidable arsenal of gadgets…Tear gas, missiles, tire spikes, cable cutters-it rivals the Aston Martin and Lotus cars as far as gadgets are concerned….and you’ve gotta love Brosnan’s facial expressions in this scene, it’s like he’s playing a video game!\n\nHere the film slows down to catch it’s breath, as Bond meets with Jack Wade again, and manages to locate the Devonshire’s wreck near Vietnam. Wade is more obnoxious this time around, but we do get one of the few times Bond is wearing full navy regalia.\n\nHere Bond encounters Wai Lin again, and after discovering the missing nuke in the wreck of Devonshire, they’re captured by Carver but are able to escape using a motorcycle, leading to another fun chase with many stunts as they’re pursued by Carver’s men in a helicopter (which doesn’t care about the innocent people in the crossfire, or rather, cross-blades)\n\nEventually after the helicopter is destroyed the two decide to join forces, and we see Wei Lin’s hideout which is sort of the second Q scene in the movie, except without Q, where we see many Chinese-style gadgets such as deadly fans, dragons heads, balloons etc. here Bond also ‘upgrades’ to a new watch and more radically, a new Walther pistol. Yeoh also gets to show off some more of her action skills here.\n\nFinding the stealth ship, they try to stop it before it escalates the conflict once again. The action in this scene is particularly machine-gun heavy, and some think that’s not exactly Bondish and more say, “Ramboish”. However, Bond’s used machine guns before in many of the films, so it’s not entirely out of character.\n\nPryce in particular is even more over the top in the end, mocking Wei Lin’s martial arts skills with a bit of pantomime and referring to Bond (who he believes is dead, shot and drowned) as his “new anchorman” We also learn that he plans to destroy Beijing (making it look like the British did it) so he can actually get broadcast rights-refused under the current administration-once a new Chinese government is in place (led by his co-conspirator General Chang).\n\nCarver gets his comeuppance via his own sea-drill, a grisly demise but one that’s seen as sort of bloodless (This is still a PG-13 film, after all)\n\nBond still has to save Wei Lin from Stamper, with the actor camping it up even further, going on about revenge for his bosses Kaufmann and Carver. Bond pins him under the missile and rescues Wei Lin just in time as the ship is ‘lit up’ as the British and Chinese figure out they’ve been had all along.\n\nIt of course ends with Bond and Wei Lin starting to make out on the debris, and then “Surrender” plays.\n\nTND is sort of a more traditional Bond outing than “Goldeneye”, and it’s got some silly parts-especially the villains (although not to the degree of “The Living Daylights”), but it’s got some of the best action of the films, Brosnan now seems more comfortable in the role than he was in “Goldeneye”. It also has the best Bond soundtrack since John Barry left. Next up: The World Is Not Enough, the somewhat polarizing Third Bond film.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n1994. After years of legal problems that delayed any third Timothy Dalton film (As well as the subpar performance of Dalton’s second film, License to Kill) , and Dalton deciding not to return to the role, it was decided that they’d cast the man who was to originally star in “The Living Daylights”-Pierce Brosnan-in a new Bond thriller, “Goldeneye”.\n\nAlthough at first glance, the name “Goldeneye” might seem to be a nod to past Bond films with the word “Gold” in the title (most notably the classic Bond film “Goldfinger”), it’s actually the name of Ian Fleming’s estate in Jamaica where he wrote some of the novels (Indeed, many Bond novels and films are set in the Caribbean-including part of this one!)\n\nIt was also the name of an operation Fleming worked on (but ultimately never executed) during his World War II days.\n\nThe movie reintroduces Bond with a spectacular bungee jump that Bond uses to infiltrate a chemical weapons plant in 1986 Russia. Having the movie start in 1986 and featuring Brosnan as Bond is an interesting decision, perhaps hinting that they wanted to ignore the Dalton era altogether, or maybe the fact that this mission went sour is part of the reason Bond was so grumpy in Dalton’s films. But that’s kind of looking too much into the film’s continuity or motives behind the writing, so I’ll just move on.\n\nBond then meets up with fellow 00 Alec Trevalyn (006). While we’ve seen other 00’s in the films-with various fates-we’ve never really seen them work directly with Bond, and there seems to be a friendship and exchange of wit between the two. Curiously, Sean also read for the role of 007, before they decided on using Brosnan.\n\nUnfortunately Alec is “captured” and “killed” by the base commander Col. Ouromov, forcing Bond to rush the countdown for the explosives to destroy the facility, and work out an escape. Here we get one of the more wackier Bond physics. While the initial stunt of Bond jumping from a bike to get a descending plane is pretty cool, Bond’s mid-air catch and ability to right the plane in the nick of time is kind of implausible.\n\nThe opening titles by Tina Turner are pretty good, using CG for pretty much the first time, showing girls hammering away at various USSR symbols while also featuring some of the film’s symbolism-the two-faced girl representing Janus, the Golden ‘eye’ of course, and the usual Bond tropes of girls and guns.\n\nTurner’s song is kind of a throwback to the Shirley Bassey type of Bond song, complete with slightly suggestive lyrics.\n\nAfter the action-heavy and stunt-heavy opener we open up in the “present day” of 1995 Monaco, where Brosnan gets to display his charm in a somewhat goofy car chase with Famke Jannsen’s Xenia Onatopp and a frightened psychologist sent to evaluate him. The music is a bit campy here, but while some of Eric Serra’s score is a bit dated, I find it’s kind of industrial tune works with the setting of the movie.\n\nHere Brosnan gets his first casino scene, where he gets to pretty much get two of the Bond catchphrases out of the way quickly-Shaken not stirred and Bond, James Bond, as well as a bunch of cheesy one-liners.\n\nWe learn that Bond has pretty much been observing Xenia for her links to the Janus Corporation, but Xenia-who is able to strangle men with her hips/thighs and derives pleasure from killing-is in fact out to steal a prototype Helicopter, for what remains unclear, but Bond is unable to prevent the theft in time.\n\nWe then go to the facility in Severneya, near Siberia, where we’re introduced to another Bond girl, computer programmer Natayla and fellow programmer Boris. Natayla is sort of the sensitive love-interest we kind of feel sympathetic for, similar in some ways to Kara in The Living Daylights but much more intelligent and proactive. Boris kind of functions as the film’s comic relief, with Xenia and Ouromov-who then enter the base, kills everyone except Boris and Natayla, take the Goldeneye ‘keys’ and then activate one Goldeneye satellite to bury the evidence-as the ‘muscle’.\n\nBond, along with the new M and Tanner, watch the drama unfold from the situation room in MI6. Here we’re introduced to the new Moneypenny, Samantha Bond, who is somewhat more similar to the Lois Maxwell Moneypenny than the short-lived Caroline Bliss one, and has more of a 90’s woman attitude, which will sort of carry over to the next two films (although not so much “Die Another Day”).\n\nAnd of course we get this even more with the new M, played by Judi Dench, who of course would play the role until 2012’s Skyfall (although she has a brief cameo in 2015’s Spectre) despite the Craig films pretty much taking place in a separate continuity. Although she’s just as tough as her male predecessors tend to be, and is very critical of Bond’s sexism and methods, (as he is of her reliance on analytical date) she still seems to have confidence that Bond will do the mission correctly.\n\nWe get a nice Q scene as well. Although they have relatively short screen time together, I actually think the chemistry between Brosnan and Llewellyn-especially in this film and his final appearance in “The World Is Not Enough”-is actually better than his scenes with Connery and Moore, with a sort of mutual respect between the two. It’s also got one of the best gadget-related gags in the series, with Bond inspecting a submarine sandwich, believing it to be some gadget, but Q stating this it is, in fact, just his lunch.\n\nWhile Natayla makes her way to St. Petersburg-but unwittingly tips off the bad guys to her location-Bond meets with CIA agent Jack Wade (played by Joe Don Baker), who sort of replaces Felix Leiter. Wade here is much more tolerable than in the next film, Tomorrow Never Dies, and thankfully neither he or Joe Don Baker in another role are seen after that.\n\nHere we get a funny scene with Valentin Zuchovsky (Robbie Coltrane of later “Harry Potter” fame) playing an ex-KGB agent turned Russian mobster and nightclub owner, who still has a grudge with Bond for a leg injury. We even get a funny cameo by actress Minnie Driver as Valentin’s mistress and bad nightclub lead singer, Irina.\n\nValentin’s a fun character, and thankfully was brought back for “The World Is Not Enough” in a larger role. We then get one of the film’s ‘sexier’ scenes, and probably the most awkward to watch with anybody else, where Xenia tries to kill Bond in a spa/sauna area, but Bond gets the upper hand and gets her to take her to Janus’s lead man.\n\nJanus of course turns out to be Alec/006, who wants revenge on the British for a World War II injustice (Trevalyn it turns out is part Russian), and has created this criminal empire and stolen the Goldeneye-an orbital nuke that creates an EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) that could fry all electronics in it’s blast zone-to be the instrument of that revenge. Sean Bean sort of gives an air of sophisticated menace, with a touch of sympathy. Kind of a ‘dark side’ of Bond, which makes sense considering he’s a 00.\n\nHe tries to kill off Bond and Natayla by destroying the helicopter with them inside, but Bond is able to trigger the ejection just in time. The blast however alerts the soviet authorities.\n\nBond and Natayla is almost able to convince them they’ve had, when Ouromov messes things up, and eventually snatches Natayla. This leads to the film’s main cool chase scene-where Bond takes a tank through St. Petersburg in order to rescue Natayla.\n\nIt’s a fantastic scene, with lots of destruction, some funny bits such, the Bond theme at full blast and of course the famous bit where Bond straightens his tie after all of this.\n\nWe then get a series of tense scenes outside-and later onboard-the train, as Bond stops the train with the last of the tank’s power, has a stand-off with Alec and Xenia that he has to bluff his way out of, and then get out of the train-wired to explode with the same amount of time Bond left Trevalyn at the beginning of the film- while Natayla attempts to discover where Alec has gotten to while Bond desperately tries to escape using his laser watch (one of the film’s niftier gadgets although slightly pre-empted by a similar device in the unofficial Connery film Never Say Never Again).\n\nNext it’s off to Cuba where the film slows down a bit, with Bond trying to justify doing his job to Natayla, and then there’s of course a romance. This is kind of where the film tries to go to ‘deeper’ levels but it comes off as a bit awkward.\n\nNext, there’s of course the big final showdown at Janus’s satellite dish in Cuba. After taking care of Xenia, It’s an interesting confrontation with Bond and 006 trying to outdo each other with insults and quips (006’s knowledge of MI6’s watch technology also undoes Bond’s initial plan to use mines to destroy the base), and then of course leads to another tense scene where Boris kind of fidgets with Bond’s pen grenade.\n\nAfter the grenade goes off-knocked out of Boris’s hands in the nick of time and destroying much of the base, Bond and Alec have a brutal final showdown, one of the more nasty confrontations between Bond a villain since his showdown with Red Grant in “From Russia With Love”. It would of course later be surpassed by Craig’s bloody fights in the later films (including Casino Royale, also directed by Martin Campbell).\n\nIt ends with Bond dropping Alec to the bottom of the Dish’s pit (although 006 is still partially alive when the whole thing comes crashing down). The blue-screen is a little rough here, but hey, it’s 1995, and it’s certainly better than the slightly similar “A View To A Kill” scene I criticized three reviews ago.\n\nAlthough Boris’s death via liquid nitrogen is kind of goofy:\n\nThe movie then ends with another “Bond gets interrupted in the middle of lovemaking” ending (although in a less embarrassing position than say, the Moore films), as Bond and Natayla are recovered by the marines. We then get a pretty bad ending song, “Alchemy of Love”, which doesn’t quite match up to the strong Dalton ending songs.\n\nOverall, Brosnan’s opener is perhaps his best Bond film, although in some parts he seems to be adjusting to the role of Bond, at times playing him a bit too cool and unemotional, especially compared to his predecessor who was perhaps a bit too emotional at times. Brosnan’s portrayal would mellow a bit in his later films, but unfortunately, the films-despite packing impressive action-would get somewhat worse as time went on, although with some pretty good elements (I feel, for instance, “The World Is Not Enough” is underrated in many respects). Some aspects are a bit dated and overly 90’s, but that really could be said of many Bond films, especially Roger Moore’s early 70’s films.\n\nGoldeneye of course was also popular for spawning a popular Nintendo 64 title, one of the best movie-adapted games ever.\n\nAlthough it took several liberties with the film’s plot, it was mostly true to it (including the industrial sounding score) and of course had a cool multiplayer function that was pretty revolutionary at the time, and incorporated elements from the other Bond films such as the Moonraker lasers and the Golden Gun, as well as characters such as Mayday and Oddjob.\n\nThe game was rebooted years later, and released on the Wii and PS3. This game version has a largely modified story to reflect more current technology and events, but most notably replaces Brosnan with his successor, Daniel Craig. But for many, nothing beats the original game.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAlthough he wasn’t the first choice for the role (which was Pierce Brosnan) in 1987, Timothy Dalton’s The Living Daylights was mostly a critically and financial success. Unfortunately, it’s follow-up-more tailored toward Dalton’s tougher, more dangerous Bond that TLD was-did not match the success of it’s predecessor, and due in part to it’s low box office (It’s still the lowest-grossing Bond film), and a number of other factors such as legal issues and trouble getting a planned third film off the ground, the next Bond was delayed until 1995.\n\nRight off the bat in the film we’re introduced to a more intimidating villain than The Living Daylights, in Drug lord Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) and his sadistic henchman Dario. Although he’s clearly violent and ruthless, Sanchez also has a weird sort of reptilian charm-he prizes loyalty and trusts almost too easily-something that Bond also exploits to bring him down. Also, like Bond’s arch-nemesis Blofeld, he has a pet-in this case an Iguana-constantly around his shoulder. Bond’s first encounter with him is when Sanchez runs out of his sanctuary country of Ithmus to retrieve his girlfriend Lupe, who is trying to escape him-leaving him vulnerable to the DEA.\n\nBond’s old CIA buddy Felix Leiter (Played for the second time by “Live and Let Die’s” David Hedison)-now with the DEA-is on his way to wed his fiancee Della when he’s informed of this, and best man James Bond tags along, helping to capture Sanchez-which he succeeds at, with a bit of ‘fishing’ his getaway plane.\n\nFortunately for Bond, but unfortunately for Felix and Della, Bond isn’t spotted capturing Sanchez, but Sanchez witnesses Felix and his wedding, and also has a mole that he’s bribed within the DEA, allowing him to quickly escape.\n\nThe opening credits are okay, but not really anything particularly special. Glady’s Knight’s tune is pretty good, although the first part seems to borrow a bit too much of Goldfinger. Interestingly, the Asian woman seen in most of the credits-Diana Lee Hsu-has a small role in the film as a Hong Kong Narcotics agent.\n\nBond attends the wedding as best man, and gets a present from the Newlyweds-a Lighter, funny enough, with a pretty large flame. However, as soon as Bond leaves (with a small reference to Bond’s own ill-fated wedding to the murdered Tracey Bond in OHMSS), Felix unfortunately has to live in his own version of his friend’s worst day ever, as Sanchez’s goons kill Della and feed Felix partially to a shark, leaving him in critical condition. When informed of Sanchez’s escape, Bond rushes back to his friend’s place but is too late. In many ways, this is one of the darkest, most disturbing scenes in all of the Bond films. Although many of Bond’s friends and female characters have been killed in the films, this seems somewhat more graphic and traumatic, especially since Felix has appeared in several films (although usually with different actors)\n\nFrustrated that the DEA is unable to find Sanchez again, Bond-along with another friend-Sharkey, a local fisherman-take matters into their own hands, investigating first where Felix was wounded, with Bond killing the DEA mole. Unfortunately, another lead-Milton Wavecrest, an alcoholic, lewd henchman of Sanchez who runs a cover-escapes.\n\nAfter this, the DEA brings in M, who is mad that his agent has taken the law into his own hands, with an interesting use of Hemingway house (complete with cats, perhaps a subtle nod to Bond villain Blofeld along with Sanchez’s Iquana). It’s at this point where his Licence is semi-revoked, but he’s able to escape before surrendering his Walther PPK. This is actually the last scene between Bond and the Robert Brown M in the series as well.\n\nBond’s next port of call is Krest’s ship the Wavekrest (unfortunately Sharkey is killed by Krest’s men, furthering Bond’s desire for revenge) where he encounters Lupe, but is also able to escape with Sanchez’s drug money, allowing him enough funds to get to Isthmus and continue his revenge. It’s a fun action sequence too, with Bond doing some underwater fighting ala Thunderball, water-skiing and dropping guys out of small planes.\n\nAlong the way he comes to the aid of one of Felix’s DEA agents Pam Bouvier, who agrees to help him after a somewhat goofy bar fight sequence with Dario (Benecio Del Toro). She’s certainly more of a ‘tough’ Bond girl, something that Dalton’s first adventure didn’t have really, and especially not Roger Moore’s final one. Then again, Lupe’s played as kind of week and overly smitten, although like Kara she’s kind of more of a victim too.\n\nIn Ithmus, we get the semi-regular Bond casino scene which wasn’t in The Living Daylights, that Bond is using in part to get Sanchez’s attention so he can make a tactical recon of his office-so he can of course, take him out as part of his revenge. Bond introduces himself to Sanchez as a sort of ‘problem solver’ who could come in handy, but he’s really only got eyes for his heavily-armored window.\n\nAlthough he’s not well-armed for this, Q comes to the rescue, on “holiday”, giving him what he needs to take out Sanchez. On a side note, Q actually has more screen-time in this one, aiding Bond and Pam in their mission throughout the film.\n\nUnfortunately, Bond’s attempt is thwarted when something unexpected happens-he spots Pam with Sanchez’s henchman Heller, and then Hong Kong narcotics attack and capture Bond. He’s unwittingly stumbled into their operation to catch Sanchez.\n\nUnexpectedly, Bond is rescued by Sanchez, and starts to unexpectedly gain the villain’s trust, convincing him that the window attack was in fact carried out by mercenaries (in fact, the now-dead Hong Kong team). Also, it turns out that at least one of Sanchez’s lieutenants-Hiller-wants immunity, hence Pam meeting with him. Bond starts to use this opportunity to literally kill two birds with one stone. Using the drug money and both Pam, Q, and Lupe’s helps, he frames Krest, a scene that’s probably one of the most violent and disturbing villain deaths in the whole series. Without actually posting the gory aftermath here, it’s pretty much explosive decompression for Krest.\n\nThe final battle takes place at a “temple” which is actually a cover for Sanchez’s drug labs, and has a phony new-age operation running out of it that’s actually turning a sizable side profit. Sanchez’s henchman Professor Butcher is played by no less than Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton, who adds some fun to the movie without being too annoying.\n\nUnfortunately for Bond his attempt to get close enough to Sanchez to take him out is spoiled by Dario, who recognizes Bond from the bar earlier and blows his ruse in a tense scene. However, Bond is able to use a distraction to destroy Sanchez’s labs, throwing his organization into disarray. Nevertheless, he tries to kill Bond with a cocaine shredder.\n\nHowever, it soon turns out to be Dario’s death instead, as he’s probably too high off the fumes and seems to mistake Pam in a white suit for an angel (He believes he killed her in the earlier bar fight), causing Dario to wind up in the shredder instead, in another particularly violent villain death.\n\nFinally we get the epic tanker chase scene, which has some cool stunts such as the truck flip Bond uses to avoid one of the stinger missiles:\n\nand later, a wheelie.\n\nThere’s also a lot of pyrotechnics around in these, as each of the tankers are eventually destroyed. Definitely one of the most spectacular chases in the series, and this time, with no real gadgets, just good old fashioned stuntwork.\n\nBond finally is able to avenge his friends with the help of their lighter, igniting a gasoline-soaked Sanchez, who realizes too late the reason Bond came after him in the first place.\n\nAt the party afterwards, we learn that Felix has thankfully regained consciousness (although he is unfortunately still widowed), and that M seems to be willing to let Bond back into the secret service after all (Which of course happens, as the Brosnan films make clear. Still I can picture a bit of a tense scene there, if it existed!). He also chooses between the more shallow Lupe and Pam, eventually ending up with Pam at film’s end, to the tune of Patti Labelle’s If You Asked Me to which became an eventual big hit, even if the film it came from was disappointing box office wise.\n\nLicense tends to get a lot of grief-many people feel it’s kind of not Bondish enough, but in fact it does borrow fairly heavily from Fleming’s novels, in particular Live and Let Die (Felix’s maiming, and Sharkey is pretty much another version of Quarrel) and Sanchez’s drug operation is similar to Both LALD and Man with The Golden Gun, especially with Bond earning the villain’s trust in order to get close enough to take him out. The film is somewhat more violent than other Bonds, in particular the fate of the Leiters and the villain’s deaths by compression, shredded to death and immolation (Most of the other villains seemed to mostly just get shot, captured, or thrown from a great height).\n\nNevertheless the film isn’t totally dark and depressing. Q brings some levity, and although he isn’t quite as good with the humor as his predecessors, Dalton does get some amusing moments, such as his double-take when Pam redoes her hairstyle and dress. (He also tends to oggle her a few times). Davi and Del Toro are pretty effective, sinister villains, and as I stated Davi’s got some good charm as well. There are also many fantastic stunts. The plot is relatively simple compared to the espionage heavy Living Daylights, as well.\n\nMichael Kamen’s score is a bit different in some ways from the John Barry work, with it’s spanish guitar giving flavor to the film’s mostly central American setting-and returning that element to the Bond theme as well, where it belongs.\n\nHowever, despite it’s strengths, many were unimpressed, and 1989 was already a crowded summer already, with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Batman, Ghostbusters II, Honey I Shrunk the Kids and several other films as direct competiton. Plus the 80’s were already fairly heavy with revenge flicks, and people probably didn’t want to see a Bond film just for that. Bond would remain in limbo until 1995, with Dalton giving up the role in the interim. So Dalton’s run unfortunately came to an early end…but the series would return, and Dalton’s tough, true-to-the-books Bond would later become more accepted, when Daniel Craig came onboard…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n1986. After “View to a Kill” ended the Roger Moore era, the search was on for a new James Bond to replace Moore. Several actors were screened, including Sam Neill (who would later star in the Jurassic Park films) Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, who was the husband of former Bond girl actress Cassandra Harris (From For Your Eyes Only).\n\nHowever, due to the attention Pierce was getting due to the announcement, his TV series Remington Steele was unexpectedly renewed, and Brosnan had to drop out of the film due to that. However, he’d get a chance again with 1995’s “Goldeneye” and would play a successful-if somewhat typical-Bond for the next 7 years.\n\nIn his place, they cast the older, more intense-looking , Shakespearean actor Timothy Dalton, originally considered for the role in the 70’s before they went with George Lazenby (Dalton felt he was too young at the time).\n\nDalton decided to bring a somewhat different approach to the role than Moore, sort of going back to the novel roots of the character, with Bond as a man who-while still possessing charm and taste-was more psychologically wounded and grumpy than the more quipish superspy of the films (especially the 70’s and early 80’s) and more dangerous. Granted, it wasn’t a complete break-Bond still did the quips (although it seemed to be the weakest part of Dalton’s acting in the role), and Bond still had his gadgets. This was after all, pretty much in the same continuity as the other films.\n\nCraig’s portrayal would take a similar approach but would break more with the continuity, although they’ve been pretty much progressing towards more traditional Bond tropes over the years. But that’s a topic for another review.\n\n“Living” opens with a skydive over Gibraltar, where three 00’s are doing a mock infiltration of the radar installation there. However, somebody else is watching the group, and Bond witnesses him off an 00 agent, as well as two SAS soldiers participating in the exercise.\n\nBond then gives chase by jumping over the suspect’s escape vehicle, eventually managing to subdue the driver, but the ordinance explodes. Bond however safely parachutes onto a yacht, and asked to use a bored woman’s 1980’s giant cellphone to give MI6 a heads up. He also of course gets to do his famous introduction and of course a quip as he joins the lady for ….champagne. 😉\n\nLiving Daylight’s opening sequence-by the British band A-Ha well known for the crossover hit “Take on Me”-has a song somewhat in the vein of “View to A Kill”, a sort of British pop number. However, like “View” the credits don’t have too much to do with the plot or settings of the films, mainly focusing on the traditional Bond opening stuff of girls and guns. The film-John Barry’s final film as Bond composer due to health issues (plus perhaps problems working with Duran Duran and A-Ha). The Pretenders also provide two tracks which along with the title theme are heard in instrumental form mainly in the film’s action and romantic scenes: “Where has Everybody gone” and “If I had a Man”.\n\nThe next sequence is pretty much an adaptation of the Bond short story The Living Daylights, from which the film gets it’s title. However, certain elements are different and tie into the earlier story. Aiding in the defection of a Russian general Koskov (Jereon Krabbe) in Brataslava, he notices the person (Mary’am D’abo) who seems assigned to kill him-who he had witnessed as a cello artist a few minutes before-“doesn’t known one end of the rifle from another”-and he spares her by only shooting her arm.\n\nAssisting in the defection, Bond’s suspicions begin to grow that something’s not quite right once everybody returns to Britain, and Koskov starts to give off of a story that the KGB director General Pushkin (Replacing Gogol from the Roger Moore films) has decided to pursue an anti-spy agenda; with the 00 killed at the beginning of the film the first casualty. Also, a search for the mysterious cello girl turns up nothing.\n\nSoon after, when Bond leaves, Koskov is kidnapped by the mysterious Necros, who even gets his own fight scene without Bond. Necros is in many ways similar to Red Grant from From Russia With Love, switching accents and disguises and using a garrote at his primary weapon. Like Grant, he’s also part of a larger plot that is more than it appears.\n\nAlthough ordered to go after Pushkin, Bond-widening his search for the girl to musicians-is able to find the mysterious woman, and sets off after her as his lead. There’s also a nice Q scene which shows off the film’s primary gadget, the key ring finder.\n\nArriving back at Bratislava, Bond soon realizes that the defection might have been a hoax-as the rifle the woman-Kara Milovy-had, had blanks and was therefore useless. They’ve both been played for fools, but Bond decides to befriend Kara-posing as a friend of Koskov-to find out what’s really going on somehow. Here we get the film’s main car action sequence, with the Volante V8 being one of the more gadget-loaded cars in the series-with laser cutters, headlight missiles, outriggers, tire spikes, a jet booster and finally a self-destruct sequence.\n\nAs for Kara, while I’ve criticized Bond girls in the past who were kind of portrayed as ‘ditzy’, or shown to be competent in some areas but sort of incompetent in others (Tifanny Case, Mary Goodnight and most recently Stacey Sutton), I think Kara ‘works’ better because she’s sort of caught up as a naive, innocent victim in this spy game, and I think Mary’am D’abo plays that well. She isn’t quite as proactive as some Bond girls, but I think she gets some decent character development, and actually towards the end does some decent fighting, although she still makes some goofy mistakes.\n\nHe ends up taking her to Vienna and romancing her a bit as well. There’s some impressive location work here, and some film fans might remember a similar setting in the film “The Third Man” with Orson Welles. This might’ve been intentional on the behalf of director John Glen, who worked on that film.\n\nMeanwhile, it turns out that Koskov is pals with Necros and crazed arms dealer Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker)-the defection and recapture was fake-and that Pushkin is actually investigating them for misusing the funds for some scheme.\n\nBond also starts to suspect things aren’t right when he gets a fellow British agent-Saunders-who accompanied him in the film’s opening-to trace some of Koskov’s spending, linking him with Whitaker. Unfortunately, Saunders is killed by Necros, but not before he uncovers the next link-In Tangier. It’s in Tangier where we get a tense scene where Bond questions Pushkin (Played by John Rhys-Davies of Indiana Jones and Lord Of The Ring’s fame) about what’s going on-and it turns out they’re pretty much on the same side, more or less-Koskov has been trying to misled MI6 into thinking Pushkin is the enemy, in order to keep him from discovering their operation.\n\nPretending to kill Pushkin with the aid of expert shooting and fake blood, Bond and Pushkin let Koskov make his next move, although Bond unwillingly attracts the attention of his old friend Felix Leiter, who has been monitoring the situation. There’s also one of the film’s best shots, a pseudo-gunbarrel with Bond in the literal spotlight.\n\nOn a side note, I feel that John Terry’s Felix Leiter is one of the weaker ones in the series. He doesn’t really get that much to do and his acting is pretty flat. Thankfully, Licence to Kill, Dalton’s next films would give us a much better Felix-and one we’ve had before in Live and Let Die-David Hedison.\n\nUnfortunately Kara contacts Koskov, and briefly is tricked by him into believing Bond is a bad guy-until Kara comes to her senses-but not before Bond is drugged and captured.\n\nBond is then taken to an Afghan Soviet air base, where the true extent of Koskov’s plan is revealed-he’s holding a gun and drug running operation with Whitaker’s help-and when Pushkin got too nosy he came up with the whole fake defection to get Pushkin out of the way. Bond and Kara are able to escape, and eventually storm the base with the help of the Afghan resistance, in the film’s largest action scene as Bond struggles to steal the Soviet plane full of drugs while Kara and the rebels attack the base. After getting the plane up, Bond still has to deal with a stowaway-ed Necros, and both find themselves hanging for their lives in the film’s best stunt.\n\nWhich, on a side note, I’m pretty sure inspired a similar scene in the video game Uncharted 3.\n\nIt was even used for the game of the year re-release!\n\nAnyway, Bond is able to get things under control but loses the plane, but manages to escape in the nick of time. He then returns to Tangier to take care of Whitaker, in a sort of lackluster final showdown. Whitaker’s far from a memorable Bond villain-he’s mainly campy bluster. Indeed Koskov isn’t either, and the villains and their plot is considered one of the weaker elements of the film (Which otherwise has a good Bond in Dalton and great action sequences that far surpass it’s predecessor View To A Kill). Baker of course would eventually play Jack Wade in the first two Pierce Brosnan Bond films.\n\nThen of course we get the happy ending-Kara gets a new job performing at Vienna, with many admirers including former KGB guy Gogol, and of course Bond gets her at the end.\n\nOverall, Living Daylights is a bit of fresh air and a return to Bond’s espionage roots after “View to A Kill” and the somewhat over the top plots and humor of many of the Roger Moore films. There’s still a bit of the Bond tropes-the gadgets, mostly-but at the time, this was pretty much a cool new direction for the series. Unfortunately, things didn’t quite work out as originally planned, as we’ll find out in the next review.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFor a dozen years, Roger Moore had played James Bond, and at the point of “Octopussy”, was pretty much equally matched with Sean Connery as far as the number of films were concerned (unless you count Never Say Never Again.) However, by the time of 1985, he would star in one more Bond-“A View To A Kill”-and that would be his curtain call for the character, especially due to his age-57. Unfortunately, along with “Moonraker” and “The Man With The Golden Gun”, it stands as one of his weakest films.\n\nView pretty much starts off on the wrong foot right away. The opening sequence-with Bond in Siberia (recovering a microchip from yet another dead fellow 00)-brings in the camp right away, and it also kind of hurts that it’s clearly not Roger Moore doing the stunts-all the close-ups of Moore are clearly shot against a blue-screen, and then things get really goofy when Bond starts snowboarding when his jet ski is broken-to the tune of the Beach Boy’s California Girls.\n\nThankfully, Duran Duran’s “View to A Kill” is one of the better Bond opening songs. Although the rock/pop is a bit different from past Bond songs-including the romantic ballads which opened most of Moore’s films-it’s still a pretty decent song, with some interesting visuals, although pretty much every shot they use of Moore/Bond is from his other films, and the fire/ice/skiing theme doesn’t have much to do with the film’s plot apart from the opening sequence.\n\nWe later find out that said Microchip is similar to one made by the billionaire Zorin, who also breeds Horses. Also, Moore’s eyes look noticeably different, perhaps due to plastic surgery before the film. It’s a bit distracting.\n\nThen it’s off to the races with Bond, M, Moneypenny and Q where they observe Zorin and his henchwoman, Mayday (as well as their horse Pegasus, who is fast, but acting strangely). I honestly kind of like this part of the film, it’s kind of cool to see the supporting members outside of “Universal Exports” offices in these films, especially since this would be not only Moore’s last film as Bond, but also Lois Maxwell’s as Moneypenny. She, like Moore, would be replaced by younger actors (Although Caroline Bliss’s Moneypenny only lasted as long as Timothy Dalton’s).\n\nWe’re also introduced to Patrick Macnee’s Sir Goddfrey Tibbet. Macnee of course was one of the leads of the Avengers TV series (John Steed), another British spy series. The Avengers also featured Diana Rigg, who starred as Tracy, Bond’s short-lived wife in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” and Honor Blackman, who was Pussy Galore in “Goldfinger”. Before his death in 2015, Macnee would narrate several documentaries about the Bond films.\n\nBond then goes to Paris to meet with a detective at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. This sequence starts off decently enough, with the impressive Eiffel Tower jump stunt….\n\n…but then gets bogged down in goofiness with Bond driving half a cab around and literally crashing a wedding.\n\nWe then shift to more Horse stuff as Bond and Tibbet investigate Zorin’s stables. There’s some fun here as Tibbet pretends to be Bond’s servant, with Bond adopting the obviously fake alias of “Sir John Smythe” (Later he pretends to be a newspaper reporter for the London Financial times, “James Stock”). We also here meet Zorin and Walken’s performance here is pretty campy, with of course Walken’s usual acting ‘tics’ and emphasizes providing some amusement as well as amusement.\n\nGrace Jones is okay as Mayday, she’s kind of bad-ass and has a unique look as oppossed to the usual mute-guys-in-fancy suits archetype of henchmen, but she doesn’t really seem that good an actress to be honest. Her delivery sort of comes across as stilted.\n\nUnfortunately, who’s even worse is Tonya Roberts as Stacy Sutton. The Roger Moore films gave us some pretty strong female supporting characters such as Anya Amasova, Melina Havelock and Octopussy, but Stacy is a throwback to the somewhat more ditzy, damsel-in-distress types of Jill St. John (Tifanny Case) Jane Seymor (Solitare) and Britt Ekland (Mary Goodnight).\n\nStill, there’s some fun and drama in this sequence of the film ,and it’s one of the few times we see Roger Moore’s Bond really express his anger and sadness at the loss of an ally, when Tibbet is revealed to be killed by Mayday (Other times including the death-and his revenge on Loque-for Ferrara and Lisl in “For Your Eyes Only”, and Vijay’s death in Octopussy: “No more problems”.) “Killing Tibbet was a mistake!”\n\nAfter this we’re given the film’s Russian connection which is a bit tacked on, revealing that Zorin is ex-KGB (hence his microchips being in the Siberian facility). Gogol shows up for the fifth time in the Moore films (The first film with Dalton, The Living Daylights, would be his last, but more on that next time), and we even have Dolph Lungren make his film debut here, as one of Gogol’s agents. Lungren was actually dating Grace Jones at the time. Lungren of course would later play Ivan Drago in “Rocky IV”, “Universal Soldier” He-Man in “Masters of the Universe”, the first of three movie Punishers, and is one of the stars of the “Expendables” franchise.\n\nNext we go to San Francisco, and this part of the film is pretty boring as Bond tries to discover what Zorin’s evil plot-“Main Strike” is. It’s pretty much a retread of Goldfinger’s plot, “Grand Slam” instead with Microchips instead of Gold, Sillicon Valley instead of Fort Knox, and floods and earthquakes instead of nukes and poisonous gas. It’s even got a miniature, like it’s predecessor.\n\nThere is a bit of fun with Bond and a female KGB agent working with Gogol to also get dirt on Zorin that Bond outwits, but it’s mostly a lot of Bond and Stacey trying to figure out Zorin’s plan, with Bond forced to use a rock-salt gun at one point to defend her.\n\nThings pick up again when their investigation is interrupted by Zorin, and Bond and Stacy are framed for murder and arson. Unfortunately, despite a cool opening with Bond saving Stacy via ladder to the tune of the instrumental version of Duran Duran’s theme this leads to a ‘keystone cops’ segment as Bond tries to escape from the police on a firetruck, which, like Stacy herself also seems like a throwback of sorts to the first two Roger Moore films (as well as Connery’s swan song Diamonds Are Forever).\n\nWe finally come to the end of the film, which although it has an impressive set, isn’t really that good or particularly well-paced. The most memorable scene is that of Zorin turning on his own men with psychotic glee (only sparing his ‘creator’, a German scientist, and his most loyal henchman, Scarpine, who gleefully joins in the massacre) with a machine gun and flooding due to the first wave of explosions. Roger Moore reportedly has stated that this is his least favorite of his films for mainly this reason (Despite playing Bond, Moore is actually fairly against a lot of film violence.)\n\nThis of course causes Mayday to switch sides, especially when her own henchwomen become victims of Zorin’s madness.\n\nThat’s Allison Doody on the right, BTW, who would also appear as the female lead of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and a slightly similar fate, dying in a chasm.\n\nThe film then ends with Bond grabbing on to Zorin’s airship-which is a pretty good mix of sets, miniatures, and an actual blimp, and then the Golden Gate bridge fight, which looks okay and impressive from far away and stunt doubles:\n\nBut like in the Siberian opener, the close-ups with Moore, Walken and Roberts on-set kind of kill the illusion with poor blue screen:\n\nThen we get pretty much the ending of all Roger Moore Bonds, with Bond in a compromising position with Stacey, discovered by Q via his remote control robot dog, one of the film’s few gadgets.\n\nSpeaking of gadgets, the film is fairly light on them, keeping up with director John Glen scaling them back in his early Moore efforts. The robot isn’t used by Bond at all, and pretty much all the gadgets save a Sharper Image door opener are used in the party scene at the beginning of the film. It’s something that would be kind of thrown out by the next film, as Living Daylights made use of Bond’s new Aston Martin and key-ring.\n\nOverall, View To A Kill takes the Roger Moore era out not with a bang, but more of a whimper, copying much of “Goldfinger”‘s plot, with Moore too old and obviously not doing much of his action scenes, and sort of going back to the beginning of his era with a ditzy side-kick and chases played more for laughs than with any sense of danger and seriousness. There’s a few good parts like Patrick Macnee and the song, but overall, a poor ending for Moore. Then again, has any Bond really gone out in style? Connery’s “Diamonds Are Forever” is one of his worst films (Never Say Never Again ain’t so great either). “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” is well-liked now but of course Lazenby left and the film’s legacy is still up to debate, “Licence to Kill”, although it broke a bit with some aspects of the Bond formula was considered mediocre to some and contributed in part to the series being delayed for a few years due to it’s poor box office; and “Die Another Day” was so over-the-top the series took a totally different direction and let Pierce Brosnan go…Craig of course, is still attached to the role as of this writing, so we’ll see about him.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhile “Moonraker” took Bond to the stars, and “For Your Eyes Only” took him back to Earth, Octopussy sort of is more of a middle-of-the-road Bond, mixing a complex plot involving Jewelry smuggling and rogue Russians with more of the globe-trotting and gadgets of Bonds like “You Only Live Twice” and “Spy Who Loved Me”. It also features another return to tradition with traditional Bond composer John Barry. It does share a few common links with it’s predecessor though-they’re both directed by John Glen who directed all the 1980’s Bond films, and also are indebted to Bond short stories, most notably Property of a Lady and the title story, Octopussy (Which also formed part of the backstory for “Spectre” as I’ve detailed elsewhere).\n\nLike with the earlier Roger Moore’s, there seems to be a bit of pop culture influence with the locales seeming even more exotic than usual; in this case, the Indian setting of a good chunk of the film. The film also has sort of a self-deprecating sense of humor at times.\n\nMoore plays the role once again with charm but it’s of course fairly obvious at this point he’s stretching believably as Bond, as he’s about 56 at this point. Although thankfully, it’s before the plastic surgery that made his eyes look kind of weird in “View to a Kill”. Originally, oddly enough, Moore wasn’t the first choice for Bond in this one, as they considered replacing him with actors such as James Brolin(!).\n\nThankfully, this is kind of offset by Maud Adams as the main-and title!-Bond girl, Octopussy, who is nearing 40 and seems more age-appropiate for Moore at this point. Maud previously appeared in another Bond film-The Man With the Golden Gun-as Scaramanga’s girlfriend (a different character), but she gets a much more prominent role here.\n\nAlthough younger and therefore not quite as fitting for Moore’s elder Bond, I think Kristina Wayborn did a good job as well. There’s some slight ambigouity as to whose side she’s really on at points (more so than Octopussy) although when she realizes she’s being played later on she’s fully loyal to her.\n\nKamal Khan’s an interesting Bond villain, not quite as nutty as Drax or Stromberg, and has a mix of charm and menace that seems to be somewhat akin to the 1960’s era Bond villains like Dr.No, Goldfinger, and Largo with a bit of Blofeld (He even has a similar chinese suit).\n\nHis henchman, Gobinda, is another “strong and silent” type, and even smashes Bond’s dice in a similar way to Oddjob smashing Bond’s golf ball in “Goldfinger”.\n\nKamal’s co-conspirator, the rogue Russian General Orlov-played by Beverly Hills Cop and Rambo Villain Steven Berkoff-is quite over-the-top though!\n\nThe plot is a bit over-the-top; after the death of a fellow 00 (something which seems to happen a lot in these films) Bond is assigned to discover what the connection was to an Indian Jewelry smuggling operation. Turns out that Kamal and Orlov are planning to use Octopussy’s legitimate circus and jewel smuggling pipeline to smuggle a nuclear device onto an air force base where the circus is playing so Orlov’s forces can invade Europe.\n\nThis actually leads to one of the film’s most controversial scenes, where Roger Moore’s Bond goes undercover as a clown to sneak into the circus and defuse it before it’s too late. While some think it’s kind of stupid to see Bond in this kind of look, there’s a few things that are considerable about the scene:\n\nThere’s sort of a sense of foreboding here, since Bond’s fellow 00 agent ended up dead in a clown suit, launching the plot in the first place.\n\nIt’s actually a very tense scene, as nobody’s taking Bond’s warning’s seriously, convinced he’s either just a clown or crazy. It actually takes Octopussy’s recognizing that she’s been duped for Bond to save the day with literally seconds to spare. There are also many civilian families around in addition to the military personnel.\n\nThe film also makes a few minor changes to Bond’s supporting cast. We get a brief scene with Moneypenny introducing her replacement miss Smallbone. However, this is short-lived, as Lois Maxwell would still play Moneypenny in View to A Kill before being replaced with the younger Caroline Bliss in “The Living Daylights”.\n\nSomewhat more permanent-at least until 1989-is Robert Brown as M. It’s not quite clear if he’s meant to be the same M as Bernard Lee, or another in the same position (He previously played an Admiral in the Spy Who Loved Me, and it’s assumed by some that this admiral is the new M).\n\nQ actually has a slightly larger role this time around in India, keeping watch on Octopussy’s island and helping in the raid on Kamal’s fortress at the end of the film. He even helps Magda and a bunch of the other Octopussy circus girls from being shot via his Union Jack hot air balloon. Bond and Q are also given a fun-but unfortunately short-lived-sidekick with Vijay (A real-life Tennis star turned actor).\n\nOctopussy of course has a bit more silliness than “Eyes”. Octopussy’s “Octopus cult” group of smugglers/jewel smugglers/female commandos is a bit on the goofy side.\n\nEspecially since I can’t help but think of this with their outfits:\n\nAnd of course much has been made of the famous Horse’s ass entry of the acrostar jet:\n\nand after Bond’s mission is completed, him stopping at an old gas station to “Fill ‘er up, please.”\n\nand most notably the jungle safari scene, where Bond manages to tame a lion, do a tarzan swing (complete with the yell), and tell a snake to “hiss off” among other things. Still, it’s bellied with a bit of tension kind of like the clown scene earlier.\n\nThe film’s also more gadget heavy. In addition to the Acrostar and Union jack balloon previously mentioed, there’s also Bond’s Seiko watch with a tracking device, and this Indian taxi-in fact a “company car” used by the Indian branch of MI6. There’s also an alligator sub which is briefly used\n\nThe Indian setting’s cool too. The German setting is a bit less exotic but does allow for some laughs, and one of those ‘what the?” onlooking scenes that the Roger Moore films tend to have, as Bond drives Orlov’s stolen car on the train tracks.\n\nOverall, Octopussy is more of a return to a traditional Bond, but a very enjoyable film all the same-if you can get past it’s sillier aspects.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\ntchOriginally, “For Your Eyes Only” was going to be the Bond film that would follow “The Spy Who Loved Me”-something made clear by the end credits of that movie. However, the success of “Star Wars” prompted them to (extremely loosely) adapt “Moonraker” instead. After that film was released, FYEO was back on the table. However, perhaps due to negative critical reaction to Moonraker (although it was a box office success), the producers decided to bring Bond back to earth-literally-with a more traditional story, and one heavily based on Fleming material, specifically, Fleming’s short stories For Your Eyes Only and Risico, as well as a sequence from Live and Let Die (I won’t go into details, since I already have in another article).\n\nThe film begins with Bond, visiting his wife’s grave, before being called back to MI6 but then his helicopter is commandeered via remote control by a bald guy with a cat-obviously meant to be Blofeld, but due to rights issues he’s never named (Blofeld’s basic look and white cat however were never in the original books and are pretty much fair game, although I’m a bit unclear how that worked in reverse with “Never Say Never Again”), but with both Tracey’s grave, and Blofeld sporting injuries very similar to the end of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, the callback is very clear.\n\nThe scene is merely played for camp, with Blofeld sporting a cartoony accent that sounds like an attempt to mix his original “From Russia With Love” voice with Donald Pleasence, but not quite making it. He’s also got some strange lines, most notably the infamous: “We can do a deal! I’ll buy you a delicatessen…in stainless steel!”\n\nHowever, the opening is one of the few sequences in the film that’s comparable in tone to the campy nature of pretty much every other Roger Moore Bond film. We then come to one of the more unique Bond openings, as singer Sheena Easton actually physically appears and sings the song among the usual footage of Bond, guns and girls.\n\nIt’s a pretty decent song, sort of following the lead of Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker as having a love song as the main title, which would continue with “Octopussy”‘s “All Time High” before Bond returned to rock/pop with View To A Kill and Living Daylights.\n\nThe movie’s main plot begins with sort of a Bond trope of a British ship being compromised (although this time by accident, more or less). This kind of plot point is used in Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Spy Who Loved Me, and Moonraker, and although taking a break for a bit, it returns with a vengeance in “Tomorrow Never Dies”. In this case, it’s the St. Georges, which contains the ATAC Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator, used to coordinate submarines….and this sets in motion the plot, as Bond-teaming up with this film’s “Bond girl” Melina Havelock (The daughter of an archaeologist killed in the search for the ship) and Greek smuggler Columbo (Topol)-races across the Mediterannan to uncover the wreck of the Georges and recover the ATAC before it falls into the hands of the KGB, who are being aided by the film’s villain, Kristatos (Julian Glover). It’s definitely a bit different from the plots of both “Spy” and “Moonraker”, where the villains hoped to create Armageddon so people could live in the sea, or repopulate Earth with “perfect” people.\n\nGlover is an actor well-known for villanous roles in media-having played the AT-AT Commander General Veers in The Empire Strikes Back, the multiple incarnations of the masked alien Scaroth in the Doctor Who serial “City of Death” and also the main villain Donovan in Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade. Initially, we’re led to believe he’s actually a good guy, helping to sponsor a talented young skying girl in the Winter Olympics and appearing to aid Bond in his search for the ATAC and the murderers of the Havelocks. However, he’s mainly trying to frame fellow smuggler Columbo, and his true, more sadistic side is unveiled in the film’s half-way point. Glover plays both sides of the character well.\n\nEqually and entirely sadistic is Locque, his main henchman. Like a great deal of Bond henchmen, he’s rather quiet (although not mute). Although not quite a strongman like Jaws or Oddjob, he’s still an intimidating presence with his cold stares, only really smiling when he runs over Columbo’s mistress Lisl (played by the late Cassandra Harris).\n\nHe’s also the subject of one of the film’s best moments-and one of the coldest kills by Roger Moore’s Bond in any of his films-as Moore kicks his car off a cliff.\n\nHowever, we do have a somewhat more ‘strongman’ henchman in Eric Kreigler, a KGB agent assigned as the go-between the KGB and Kristatos. Bond’s main confrontation with him is a thrilling winter sports ski chase.\n\nFuture “Game of Thrones” star Charles Dance also has a small role as a minor henchman, Claus.\n\nGirl-wise, we’ve got Carole Bouquet as the Bond girl. Her character is given better motivation-and acting I think as well-than Anya and Holly before her, and Carole Bouquet plays her as both really sympathetic but also a bit badass as well. She also doesn’t really fall for Bond until the end of the film either, which is a bit of a departure.\n\nSpeaking of falling for Bond, Kristatos’s ward Bibi-a kind of more bubbly, dumb Bond girl certainly does. Bond pretty much rebuffs her advances (and with good reason too-she’s in her late teens or early twenties and Roger Moore is in his mid 50s at this point, so that would just be weird). She’s kind of one of the goofier aspects of the film, but Moore’s reactions to her relentless flirting are some of the film’s best laughs, and she’s not quite annoying as Mary Goodnight a few films ago.\n\nFinally Bond-girl wise we have Cassandra Harris in a small role as Countess Lisl, Columbo’s mistress and collaborator, who has a brief fling with Bond before she’s murdered by Locque. Harris plays it pretty well, although we don’t see too much of her and it’s not quite clear why Lisl is faking an accent. Fun fact about Harris-before her death, she was married to future Bond Pierce Brosnan, and it was she who introduced him to the producers. This led to Brosnan eventually almost replacing Moore in 1986, however due to TV contract things Brosnan couldn’t play it at the time. He eventually of course got his chance in 1995.\n\nGadget-wise, the film is a bit light, especially compared to the previous two films. In fact, Bond’s original Lotus is taken out of action early on when the bad guys attempt to break in, triggering it’s self-destruct!\n\nApart from that, the ATAC itself and a radio watch which really isn’t used that much except for the film’s comic relief ending, we really just get the Identigraph which Bond uses to identify Locque. It’s used entirely in Q’s lab, which, like in many of the other films, shows off a large group of gadgets being developed, but not used by Bond in the field at all.\n\nSpeaking of that watch, it’s used in a pretty hilarious scene that closes the film, in which Margeret Thatcher-England’s PM at the time (played by a look-alike actress in this of course) congratulates Bond on the sucess of his mission, but ends up speaking with Melina’s parrot instead while she and Bond have a “moonlight swim.” It’s kind of interesting that the most serious of the Moore films is pretty much book-ended by goofy scenes-The Blofeld stuff at the beginning and then this.\n\nMusic-wise, like “Live and Let Die” and the “Spy Who Loved Me” For Your Eyes Only doesn’t have John Barry as composer, instead using the talents of “Rocky” and “Karate Kid” composer Bill Conti. Although a bit different than Barry’s talents, Conti’s music really kind of fits the “Winter sports” feel of the middle of the movie.\n\nOverall, FYEO was a pretty good return to form for the series to it’s espionage roots and more serious tone, with Moore being able to adapt to it pretty well. Although by this point he’s aging and starting to lose some of his credibility as a convincing Bond, he still gives it his best in my opinion, proving that he’s got some dramatic teeth beyond the One liners. Next “Octopussy” would attempt to put a bit more comedy back into the series, while still having a semi-serious tone….\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn 1977, the Bond film “The Spy Who Loved Me” restored faith in the franchise after a period of uncertainty, with the departure of co-producer Harry Saltzman and the somewhat dissiapointing critical and box office reaction to “The Man With The Golden Gun”. “Spy” largely restored a more cinematic Bond feel, with a larger widescreen ratio, more exotic locations, and the gadgets and over-the-top villains Bond had become to be known for, as well as a more likeable take on the character by Moore himself, who seemed to be trying too hard to replicate Connery’s ‘edge’ in his first two films.\n\nHowever, there’s often too much of a good thing. Originally, “Spy” was going to be followed by “For your Eyes Only” (Which did eventually get made, one film over). However, it didn’t quite work out that way…\n\nA little film called “Star Wars” came out, and of course cinematic science fiction was super popular again. Star Trek was in the middle of getting a second TV show when suddenly it’s priorities shifted to make a movie series to compete with Wars. Innovative science fiction films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Alien were huge hits. Various derivative works and parodies were made-and Bond-which had often used popular genres of the time for inspiration-just had to get a piece of that pie too. Hence “FYEO” was pushed back, and “Moonraker” was put in it’s place. The film, in it’s third act, takes Bond into Space, complete with laser pistols and laser-firing space shuttles, to fight the bad guy onboard a space station. It even ends with Bond saving Earth at the last minute by being a good shot, something sort of like Luke Skywalker’s “One in a million” shot in Star Wars. Moonraker’ station even has even got it’s own fancy laser, although nothing on the Death Star scales.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned in my analysis of the novel, the Moonraker novel is actually somewhat closer to the film Goldeneye, with a bad guy wanting to get revenge on London using a nuke. However, apart from the name, Hugo Drax is pretty much entirely different in the film. He’s potrayed as a villain with pretty much the exact same plot as the previous film’s Stromberg-but with one exception-instead of the sea, he wants to create a utopia in space, and eventually repopulate Earth with ‘pure’ humans. His sense of humor and attitude is a bit more droll than Stromberg as well. He’s actually one of the film’s brighter spots.\n\nLike his villain, a lot of the elements of the film copy “Spy’s” (It’s by the same director, who also directed the large scale Bond You Only Live Twice which also carried many of the same tropes). A vessel vanishes, Bond teams up with an agent from another country after some initial mistrust, and of course they’re pursued by Jaws, who is potrayed as far more of a joke here. He’s got one really pretty good scene-when he sneaks up on Bond’s female alley Manuela during a Carnivale celebration in Rio-which, unfortunately for him (But fortunate for Manuela and Bond himself), is not only broken up by Bond, but also revelers constantly entering the alley.\n\nHowever, the rest of the film he’s pretty much poorly used. There’s the opening segment where he falls into the circus tent, a sort of poorly choreographed and fake-looking battle atop cable cars in Rio:\n\nWhico of course leads to Jaws crashing, and then falling in love with a local girl, Dolly:\n\nWho accompanies him to the Moonraker station, and is ultimately responsible for him helping Bond out when it starts to become clear that Drax may have no further use for him once they’re plans are complete, and leading to of course the moment where Jaws speaks his only line:\n\nThere’s of course some other silly moments too, which sort of hurt the film’s credibility further, such as the infamous Gondola chase, which ends with a moment that’s mainly intended to evoke the “dazed onlooker” scene in Spy Who Loved Me. It even has the same guy drinking in it (He’d also appear one more time in For Your Eyes Only during the ski chase). Plus to add to the lunacy, there’s a pigeon doing a double take.\n\nThe most silly element of the film is of course the final act, where Bond actually goes into space to Drax’s space station. There’s actually some decent model work here, not quite on Star Wars level but almost as good as Atlantis and Liparus in the other film.\n\nBut of course there’s somewhat undermined by the attempts by the actors to ‘act’ weightless which kind of come of as silly, and of course the space battle outside with astronauts with jetpacks and lasers. This isn’t any future stuff, by the way: It’s taking place in 1979.\n\nLike with “Spy” there’s a lot of nods to various other films in the music: The Romeo and Juliet theme when Jaws meets Dolly, small nods to Close Encounters and 2001’s theme as Drax’s stuff, and the magnificent Seven theme when Bond is in south America trying to locate Drax’s HQ.\n\nJohn Barry returns to the series after a one film absence, however a lot of his score seems a bit more subtle than in the earlier films. The “007” theme-often played in action scenes in the Connery films-makes it’s final appearance here during the Q boat chase in the Amazon, but it does seem somewhat subdued as well. Barry’s best track is the Moonraker theme itself. Instead of using the ‘space theme’ he previously used for For You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever, here instead he’s given a somewhat more ominous and majestic-sounding melody. However, Shirley Bassey’s title tune here is the weakest of her three, although it kind of works well in the film’s romantic scenes in it’s non-lyrical version.\n\nBond girl wise, we first meet Corrine, Drax’s assistant, who, helping Bond dig up dirt on her boss, unfortunately meets a bad end in one of the film’s most dramatic, and well-done scenes (if of course, kind of disturbing as well). Along with the carnivale segment (with a brief Bond girl, Manuela), it almost seems out of place in this film.\n\nOf course the major one is Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles). She sort of comes off a bit bland next to her predecessor Anya in persona (if not by acting ability), although Lois Chiles does what she can with the material.\n\nSo in closing, Moonraker’s sort of a mixed bag. It’s got some well-done moments but it’s kind of let down a lot by it’s silliness and camp, and the toning-up of Jaws and the somewhat subdued score, as well as pretty much being a space version of Spy Who Loved Me. Things would be toned down of course-and come much closer to the original Fleming material for the next Bond, the delayed “For Your Eyes Only”.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
