They were outside of respectable society—like Kings—and I am not sure but that this was better for their art and their happiness than to be classed as lecturers, tax-payers, tennis-players, suburban householders, and lovers of dogs.' —Arthur Kulosas\n\nNOTICE\n\nNo character in this novel is the portrait of an actual person, and if there is any resemblance to the name of a real person, it is accidental.\n\nSuch notices as this have become increasingly familiar because of an increasing habit among readers of finding themselves portrayed in every novel, and of being annoyed or unduly pleased. It is particularly necessary in this book because in recent years I have been acquainted with six summer theatres and with a touring play. I declare vigorously that the Nutmeg Players of Point Grampion, in my tale, are not drawn from the Stockbridge, Cohasset, Ogunquit, Provincetown, Clinton, or Skowhegan companies, and that the tour of a Romeo and Juliet company, here chronicled, is not the history of my Angela Is Twenty-Two. And Sladesbury is not Hartford, but the county seat of Cloud-Cuckoo-Land.\n\nI hope that this signboard may have some effect. After the appearance of Arrowsmith I was informed that at least half my medical characters had been drawn from professors of whom I had never heard. With It Can't Happen Here, adherents of two editors, one in Vermont and one in Connecticut, gave rather convincing proof that each of these gentlemen was the model for Doremus Jessup. But the happy days were with Elmer Gantry when, on the same Sunday morning, in the same Western city, each of two clergymen announced from his pulpit that the Reverend Elmer had been drawn solely from him, but that the portrait was crooked.\n\nI shall not explain to self-elected prototypes of my Bethel Merriday or Roscoe Valentine just how I probed their own lives; and if it shall prove that there really are persons so unfortunate as to be named Zed Wintergeist or Mrs. Lumley Boyle or Mrs. J. Goddard Deacon or Jerome Jordan O'Toole or Tudor Blackwall, I shall merely point out that there is a tradition that fiction characters have to be called something.\n\nOf course writers might call them X76 — 4 or Pi R Square.\n\nBut if we did, all the persons with automobile licences numbered X76 — 4 and all the coolies named Pi Lung Squong would write to us, which heaven forbid.\n\nSinclair Lewis\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nChapter I\n\nChapter II\n\nChapter III\n\nChapter IV\n\nChapter V\n\nChapter VI\n\nChapter VII\n\nChapter VIII\n\nChapter IX\n\nChapter X\n\nChapter XI\n\nChapter XII\n\nChapter XIII\n\nChapter XIV\n\nChapter XV\n\nChapter XVI\n\nChapter XVII\n\nChapter XVIII\n\nChapter XIX\n\nChapter XX\n\nChapter XXI\n\nChapter XXII\n\nChapter XXIII\n\nChapter XXIV\n\nChapter XXV\n\nChapter XXVI\n\nChapter XXVII\n\nChapter XXVIII\n\nChapter XXIX\n\nChapter XXX\n\nChapter XXXI\n\nChapter XXXII\n\nChapter XXXIII\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHAT was the first time that anyone ever called her an actress—June 1st, 1922, Bethel's sixth birthday. There was no spotlight, no incidental music, and her only audience were her mother and a small dog looking regretfully through the window of a boarding-house. But she was sensational.\n\nHer mother and she were on their way to the A. & P. Store, and as usual Bethel had with the greatest violence been running in circles. She was slight and small and entirely feminine, but she was the best runner in her neighbourhood.\n\nShe stopped, then moved with a queer slow hitching. In front of them an old lady was scraping along, sunk forward from her shoulders as though she had given up all hope of ease and love. Her whole life seemed to be in her painfully sliding feet. Bethel tried to recreate that dejected walk, and she went at it so earnestly that the back of her neck ached with the weight of sagging shoulders, and every step was a frightened effort.\n\nHer mother interrupted.\n\n'Good gracious, don't copy folks that way, Bethel. You'll hurt their feelings.'\n\nThe small, black-eyed child halted, in protest.\n\n'Oh! I'm not copying her. I'm trying to be her. I can be a lot of different people.'\n\n'My, aren't we grown-up! I'm afraid that you like to show off, dear—the way you always say your text so loud in Sunday school.'\n\n'I love to say texts! \"I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart. I will show forth all thy marvellous works\".'\n\n'It all sounds like maybe you're going to be an actress. I guess that wouldn't be a bad text for an actress.'\n\n'Look how the poor old lady's heels are run down,' said Bethel, too busy with her career for prophecies of glory.\n\nBethel was born in 1916, on the day after the Battle of Jutland. Her father, kneeling by the bed, had prayed, 'Dear Lord, please make this baby a child of peace and justice—yes, and happiness, Lord'.\n\nFive months after the six-year-old Bethel gave her imitation of the old lady, the Black Shirts marched bravely into the maws of the movie cameras in Rome; and five months after that, Hitler bounded out of a Munich beer garden. But perhaps it was as important that at this time John Barrymore was playing Hamlet and Pauline Lord Anna Christie and the Theatre Guild producing Back to Methuselah. They were so much less stagy.\n\nHerbert Merriday, Bethel's father, was a dealer in furniture, to which, later, he was importantly to add electric refrigerators and radios. They lived in Sladesbury, a city of 127,000, in central Connecticut, a fount of brassware, hardware, arms, precision instruments, clocks. Here is the renowned establishment of Lilydale & Duck, makers of machine-guns for killing policemen and revolvers for killing gangsters and the Duck Typewriter for joyfully chronicling both brands of killing.\n\nSladesbury is Yankee, not Colonial, and it envies and scorns the leisurely grace of Litchfield and Sharon. It proclaims itself constantly as 'modern', and is beginning to boast of being 'streamlined'.\n\nEven for Sladesbury, the Merriday family stood high in modernity. They had been the first family to have a radio installed in their car, and Mrs. Merriday, though she was a solid Universalist, was so advanced as to belong to the Birth-Control League.\n\nIn May of 1931 Bethel was almost fifteen, and finishing sophomore year in high school. It was suitable to the neighbourhood modernity that her brother Benny, now twenty-one, should be working in the Dutton Aeroplane Works, and talking about designs for transatlantic clippers, talking about (though never actually reading) the Bible by Karl Marx, and that the girls she knew should be talking about careers. They wanted homes and babies as much as their mothers had, but none of them expected to be entirely supported by husbands. Most of them were, they asserted, going to be aeroplane hostesses, motion-picture stars or radio artists, though certain of the less studious sort confessed that they would not mind being 'hostesses' in the large dance halls.\n\nBethel could not look upon serving cold consommé at an altitude of a mile, or dancing the rumba, as having much meaning. She was learning touch typewriting in high school—that was her father's one insistence about her studies—and she could become a secretary, busy and important, receiving the boss's magnificent callers. But privately, ever since her sixth birthday, she had yearned to be an actress.\n\nAs she had never seen a play with professional actors, she was shaky as to just what being an actress implied, and certainly she never admitted to her companions so eccentric an ambition. She was one of a whole generation of youngsters under twenty who considered the London of Shakespeare and the Paris of Molière as barbaric and rather comic, who were familiar with radio broadcasts from Madrid and aeroplanes just landed from Alaska and two-million-dollar film dramas and the theory of the atom, but half of whom had never seen a real play or entered an art gallery or heard an orchestra play anything but dance music.\n\nBethel herself had seen only a high-school farce, in which a football player in a red wig kept kicking a fat boy; a Republican party pageant in Brewster Park, with Lawyer Wilkie as Lincoln, heavily accented as to shawl and beard; and the melodramas about gun-molls and sunken submarines which Alva Prindle and Bethel herself performed on the workbench in the Prindle garage. So altogether futile and babyish seemed the intention of acting that probably she would not have confessed it to her friends Alva Prindle and Charley Hatch on that evening in May 1931, had the newspapers not been hinting that, for the first time in ten years, Sladesbury was to have a professional stock company all summer long.\n\nAnd it was one of her queer, secret, sensitized days when she saw everything with intolerable acuteness.\n\nWhen she awoke, that Saturday in May, the morning was bewitched with fog.\n\nShe had, proudly, a room of her own, with a candlewick cover on a spool bed of 1860. Benny, the worshipper of new machinery, laughed at the bed as old-fashioned, but she prized it as somehow connected with Pilgrims who shot wild turkeys with blunderbusses on Thanksgiving Day, and came home to drink hot toddies in the company of grey ladies in poke bonnets.\n\nShe also had a shaky white-painted desk of her own, with a bookshelf on which were a complete Shakespeare, an Edgar Wallace novel, a Mary Roberts Rinehart novel, a ragged volume of Keats, a manual of tennis, and No. 1567 in the Haldeman-Julius Little Blue Books, namely, Making Men Happy with Jams and Jellies. The wallpaper was canary yellow, with small scarlet birds; the rug was blue. She loved her secure retreat and its friendly brightness.\n\nBut this morning of mist was forlorn to her as she crawled out, in her blue-and-white-striped pyjamas, her bobbed hair, which was very black, flickering above her charming shoulders, which were very white. She was afraid, or pretended that she was afraid, to look out of the window—and then looked. The Hatch house, next door, had alarmingly vanished in the fog. The elms were hard pillars, their foliage unseen; the silver birch was chilly as winter.\n\nOn such a day, even at her mature age of fourteen years and eleven months, she could again convince herself that she was the foundling child of wicked gipsies.\n\nShe knew that all this was quite insane. But there was a good, efficient, earthy Bethel who always guarded the mad Bethel, and who now insisted that being a gipsy was no crazier than her father's love for assaulting golf balls, or her mother's stated belief that anyone born in New Hampshire was handsomer and healthier than any Vermonter.\n\nAs Bethel wriggled and rubbed herself under the shower bath—oh yes, the Merridays were as modern as all that—and drew on her bloomers, her rolled stockings, her flowery cotton dress, she was prim and a little stern, that she might not betray her Crazy Ideas.\n\nThings were not right, downstairs.\n\nThe house was only ten years old, and the living-room was still of suitable modernness, with interior decorations correct by the highest standards of the women's magazines: a large, frameless mirror over the white fireplace, reflecting two marble vases; a glass-topped nickelled coffee table in front of the convertible davenport; on the wall, a travel souvenir in the way of a 'Ye Motor Mappe of Ye Quaint Olde Cape Codde', depicting whales and Pilgrims; an enormous combination radio and phonograph, shining like syrup; and no books whatever. But to the revolutionary Bethel, this morning, the room was as oppressive as too hot a bath.\n\nShe apologized to herself that her father and her mother and her house were really very nice. But a little smug...?\n\nThen she first really discovered ash trays; then she found that ash trays can be fascinating but horrible. On the coffee table was a still unemptied tray; a half-sphere of rock crystal, which should have been spotless, shining as a handful of upper air, but was smeared now with black ash stains and filled with dead paper matches and cigarette stubs like the twisted dead white arms of babies. The whole thing, she shuddered, was a shell pit, only smaller.\n\nBut she seized herself and pushed herself on into the dining-room, with a reproving, 'You're imagining things!'\n\n'Good morning, Beth. That's doing pretty well. Only ten minutes late. You look as if you slept pretty well,' said her father.\n\n'Foggy enough for you to-day?' said Gwendolyn, the hired girl.\n\n'Hya, Toots. Hya, handsome,' said her brother.\n\n'Good morning, dear. You look cheerful, this morning,' said her mother.\n\n(She didn't feel cheerful, and she was hanged if she'd be cheerful, not all day long, she reflected. But if they thought she looked so, she must be doing some good acting.)\n\nShe studied her corn flakes, and found that corn flakes are as fastastically [sic] improbable as ash trays, once your eyes were open. They certainly didn't look like food. Food was lamb chops and chop suey and corn on the cob and apple pie à la mode; these things were twists of brown paper, with minute bubbles on their speckled surfaces. What a thing to eat!\n\nShe did eat them, and enjoyed them very much, but now she was at the fascinated vexation of studying just how they all ate. Her father sturdily opened his lips up and down like a pair of trap doors, showing his teeth. Her mother nibbled like a rabbit, her faded pink lips (she would not use her lipstick till she went to the bridge club this afternoon) trembled a little and hid her teeth. And Brother Ben twisted his mouth sidewise, with the right corner of it scornfully elevated.\n\nShe tried to imitate them all.\n\n'What are you daydreaming about, dear?' said her father.\n\n'Eat your nice hot muffins, Beth,' said her mother.\n\n'I hope you'll know me the next time you see me,' said her brother.\n\n'What makes it foggy to-day?' said Bethel.\n\n'The fog,' said Ben.\n\nFor two hours, that schoolless Saturday morning, she worked in her father's store, polishing tables and radio cabinets. Her hands were swift, and she liked seeing the sleek grain of the wood emerge from dullness. But as this was, she luxuriously sighed, one of her poetic days, she would spend all afternoon in Brewster Park. It had a grove of thick Japanese walnuts with a tiny stream, and there, on a small pad of the best linen correspondence paper, she would write a poem about the Grecian city hall... She was much given to writing poetry, except that she never had been able to write more than a dozen lines of it.\n\nBut into the store bounced her friend Alva Prindle, to demand that she come to the North Side Tennis Club that afternoon.\n\nAlva Prindle was a big, beautiful, bouncing blonde. She was born that way; she was spiritually like that; she would have been a big, beautiful, bouncing blonde even if she had been as dark and delicately made as Bethel. It was Alva whom the high-school girls had nominated as a future Queen of Hollywood.\n\nBethel did play tennis that afternoon, and she played well enough, and she hated it. She felt that there must be something complicated and wrong in herself, for while just that morning she had been able to see herself as Lady Macbeth, satisfyingly murderous and flamboyant before an audience of two thousand, this afternoon, showing off her rapid, accurate, nervous little serve before an audience of not more than a dozen musical young gentlemen aged sixteen, she was terrified; she was embarrassed every time Alva answered the gallery's 'Good work, beautiful', with a merry: 'Go climb a tree'. (Alva varied it by retorting, 'Go lay an egg' or 'Go jump in the lake'.)\n\nThe North Side Tennis Club was founded by the medium-successful retail merchants, the minor doctors and lawyers and insurance agents and real-estate sellers of Sladesbury, to give their children something of the social glory of the private en-tout-cas courts of the bank vice-presidents and the factory owners. Its club house was a one-room shack with a counter at which were sold Coca-Cola, orangeade, cigarettes, chewing-gum and stale sweet crackers, but this counter was to Bethel what Twenty-One and El Morocco and the Stork Club and the like New York exhibits of elegance and celebrity were some day to seem.\n\nAlva dragged her in there after the match. The young men lounged on high stools, drinking soda from bottles through straws, and singing 'She Didn't Say Yes, She Didn't Say No'.\n\nThe sanctities of Prohibition had more than two years to run, and the young people still considered it a social duty to drink raw gin. The oldest of their group—Morris Bass, the handsome, the fast-driving, the generous, the loudly lecherous, eighteen and the sole scion of a catsup factory—was urging on them cheer from a gin bottle with a counterfeited Gordon label. Alva had a shot of it in her root beer and began to giggle.\n\nNot till now had anyone like Morris Bass ever given heed to Bethel, but this afternoon (she was flattered, so baronial was he in his pink-and-apricot sweater, his white-linen plus fours, his oiled chestnut hair) he dragged her by the arm to a bench outside the club shack, poured half a glass of gin into her sarsaparilla, and with heavily breathing satisfaction pushed his heavy arm about her waist... In her life, she had tasted gin perhaps twice; certainly no gallant had embraced her publicly. The Modern Merridays did not hold with drunkenness and public slobbering.\n\n'Please!' she begged.\n\n'What's a matter? Don't you like hootch?'\n\n'Oh, yes, I think I do, but I've been playing tennis so hard—'\n\n'Go on! Bottoms up!'\n\nA stir of pride and rebellion ran through her profound shyness. She set the drink on the ground and drew his arm from about her.\n\n'Little Puritan, eh? Haw, haw, haw!'\n\n'No! I'm not! Of course I'm not!'\n\nIt must be admitted that to Bethel, like most children in most Sladesburys in the 1930's, it was worse to be prudish than to be loose. She was sorry that she didn't like to have Morris's thick red hand pawing her white linen blouse.\n\n'No! Of course I'm not a Puritan!'\n\n'Then what's a matter? First time I ever got a good eyeful of you, this afternoon. You played pretty good tennis. And you got nice legs. I guess you won't ever get thick ankles, and that's a girl's best point, believe you me. So what's eating you? Not afraid of a little necking, are you?'\n\nHe kissed her, greasily.\n\nShe was up and away from him, all in one compact movement. 'I just don't like uncooked beefsteak!'\n\nShe ran like a leopard.\n\nAs she reached home, her only conclusion was that 'necking' in itself seemed interesting but that, unfortunately, something in her would always make her sick of the Morris Basses and all persons who drank out of bottles and exploded in laughter. Were actors ever like Morris? she wondered. Would it keep her from being an actress?\n\n'There won't be any people like that in my theatre, when I'm running a show!' she snapped; and it is curious, not to be explained, that she should have said that, because never in her life had she heard of an actor-manager, of an actress-producer.\n\nShe knew nothing beyond the names of Sarah Bernhardt and Duse and Mrs. Fiske and Ethel Barrymore; nothing of the young Helen Hayes, except as a movie actress, nor of the young Katharine Cornell, who just then was appearing in The Barretts of Wimpole Street. Like a child born to be a painter, she got her ideas from the wind, the earth; and this moment she, who couldn't possibly have known about anything of the kind, saw herself in a star's dressing-room, halting her making-up to look at a bill for new props, and then, ever so gently and sympathetically, giving a drunken leading man his two weeks' notice.\n\nAfter such eminence, it was with a good deal of quiet dignity that she went into the kitchen to help Gwendolyn, the youthful cook, wash the vegetables for dinner. (For fifteen years now the Modern Merridays had had evening dinner at seven instead of evening supper at six.)\n\n'Have a nice time playing tennis?' bubbled Gwendolyn, who was the lady-love of a prominent bus driver.\n\n'Oh—yes—pretty nice...'\n\n(Silver lace and a tiara—the queen enthroned, centre-stage. Dirt-crusted bars and the hateful teeth of grinning guards—the queen waiting for the guillotine.)\n\n'Still foggy near the river, Beth?'\n\n'I don't—no, I don't guess it was quite so foggy.'\n\n(A young farmwife who has hidden her murderer-husband in the attic, and who faces expressionless the searching sheriffs.)\n\n'What're you so quiet about? Guess you must be in love.'\n\n'I am not!' And Bethel shuddered. Love did not, to her, seem a mystery to be funny about.\n\nWith dignity and a degree of hunger for all the whipped cream of culture, she paraded royally into the living-room and put an aria from Carmen on the phonograph. She did not hear it through. She was so suddenly and bewilderingly sleepy that she dashed up to her little room and till dinnertime slept like a kitten.\n\nThe star is sleeping, as only stars can sleep.\n\nWith the blonde goddess, Alva Prindle, and Charley Hatch, the sturdy, soothing, rather stupid boy next door who was Bethel's trustiest friend, she went to the Connecticut Palace Motion Picture Theatre that evening, and breathlessly viewed The Heart of an Understudy.\n\nThere was, it seems, a woman star, beautiful but wicked, and jealously devoted to ruining the fine young leading man by scandal-hinting and cruel looks instead of by the simpler and much more effective weapon of upstaging him. This lady fiend had an understudy, a poor foundling girl, who had learned her histrionic craft in a Seventh Day Adventist Home for Orphans. The understudy hadn't a friend in the company except the kind young leading man, who carried her bags on overnight jumps.\n\nSo the wicked star also persecuted the understudy, till the glorious night when the star fell ill (with a particularly sudden onset of author's disease) and the understudy went on, and played so radiantly, so competently, that the critics and a lot of reporters—who just happened to be in the theatre on that ninety-third night of the New York run—wrote reports which were given two-column heads in all the dailies: 'Miss Dolly Daintree Greatest Theatrical Find of Years: Unknown Girl Thrills Thousands at the Pantaloon Theatre.'\n\nThe star seemed distinctly annoyed by this until, dying, she discovered that the unknown female genius was her own daughter, by some marriage that she had forgotten, and handed her over to the arms of the hero, along with a sizable estate—presumably so that they wouldn't have to go on acting.\n\nIt was a gorgeous movie, with shots of the Twentieth Century train, supper with the producer at the Waldorf, and gilt cupids on the star's pink bed. There was even a tricky shot in which a minor movie actor acted as though he were a trained actor acting.\n\nWhen the screen had darkened, Bethel did not merely hope—she joyously knew that she was going to be an actress.\n\nShe confessed it to Alva and Charley Hatch at their after-theatre supper at the Rex Pharmacy and Luncheonette.\n\nThe Rex, a drugstore which was less of a drugstore than a bookstore, less of a bookstore than a cigar store, less of a cigar store than a restaurant, was characteristic of a somewhat confused purpose in American institutions, whereby the government has been a producer of plays and motion pictures, movie producers are owners of racing stables, churches are gymnasiums and dance halls, telegraph offices are agencies for flowers and tickets, authors are radio comedians, aviators are authors, and the noblest purpose of newspapers is to publish photographs of bathing girls.\n\nThe actual drug department at the Rex consisted of a short counter laden with perfume bottles and of a small dark man who looked angry; but along one whole side were magnificent booths with ebonite tables shining like black glass. Here, cosily, the three children, world-weary connoisseurs of radio programmes and ventilation systems for motor-cars, supped on a jumbo malted milk, a maple pecan sundae and a frosted coffee.\n\n'That was a wonderful movie. That dress the star had on at the dance must of cost a thousand dollars,' said Alva.\n\n'Yuh, pretty good. That was swell where she bawled out the fellow in an aeroplane and he said he'd chuck her overboard if she didn't shut her trap,' said Charley.\n\n'I'm going to be an actress,' said Bethel.\n\nAlva gurgled noisily with a straw. 'Look who's here! You don't think you're serious?'\n\n'Yes, I am!'\n\n'Honest, Beth, you aren't so bad, in a mousy kind of way—you got nice big eyes and a kind of, oh, ivory skin, but if you tackled Hollywood, the producers would laugh themselves sick. Now I am going in the movies. Maybe I'm dumb—I can't do Cicero like you can—but I got the build.'\n\nAlva made rather indelicate motions, denoting curves.\n\n'I'm not going to Hollywood. I'm going to be a stage actress. And be able to act, like that understudy.'\n\n'Honest, Beth, you slay me!'\n\n'I am! I'm going to study voice in college—'\n\n'You better study mascara! Beth, there ain't any stage actresses any more! All that old-fashioned junk has gone out. Plays!'\n\n'You've never seen one.'\n\n'I read about 'em in Movie and Mike Weekly. What's a stage play got? Couple scenes, maybe three, and six-eight actors, where in the movies, lookit what they show you—a castle on the Riveera and a submarine torpedo room and the Paris fashions and a Chinese geisha girl and everything; and in a show you wouldn't get but sixty dollars a week, but in the movies I'll get a thousand! Hot dog! I'm going to have a sable coat!'\n\nMore sympathetic, Charley offered, 'No, you don't want to be an actress, Beth. They all lead immoral lives. And you wouldn't like it on the stage. You'd be scared. You're kind of shy. You better be a nurse.'\n\n'I will not! I'm going to act.'\n\n'Maybe you could organize an amateur show in the hospital.'\n\n'I'm not going to be an amateur. I'm not going to play at playing. No! It isn't good enough!'\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nONCE upon a time Sladesbury, with its population of more than a hundred thousand, had known a dozen touring companies a year: Sothern and Marlowe, Maude Adams in Peter Pan, Arnold Daly in Candida; and had supported a permanent stock company, presenting fifty plays, from As You Like It to Charley's Aunt, in fifty weeks of the year.\n\nNow in 1931 not one professional play had been presented in Sladesbury for more than five years. The block of old-fashioned spacious buildings which had contained the Twitchell Theatre—opened by Edwin Booth—the Latin Academy, and the Armoury of the Honourable Company of Foot had been replaced by a gold-and-scarlet filling station, a Serv-Ur-Self food market, and a Bar-B-Q Lunch which lent refinement to hamburger sandwiches by cooking them with electricity.\n\nThe former stock-company theatre, the Crystal, had long been a motion-picture establishment. But by Bethel's fifteenth birthday, June 1st, 1931, it was certain that the Crystal would gamble again with living actors. The Sladesbury that manufactured aeroplane motors was going to become as modern as Athens in 500 B.C. The Daily Advocate announced that the 'Caryl McDermid Stock Company of Broadway Actors' would take over the Crystal, on June 15th, and play through the summer.\n\nFor Bethel, heaven had come to Charter Oak Avenue.\n\nShe cut out the daily notices and pictures of the company. She pondered over the photographs of McDermid, the actor-manager, with his handsome square face, his lively eyes, his thick hair low on his forehead, his wide mouth. Proudly, as though he belonged to her—was she not the greatest local patroness of the drama?—Bethel noted that sometimes he looked like a factory executive, sometimes like a soldier-explorer, once, in rags, like a poet vagabond; proudly she learned that he had been a star in the silent motion pictures and had toured with Otis Skinner and Frank Craven.\n\nShe had always considered it shameless to be seen loitering on Charter Oak Avenue, whistled at by the interested knots of young loafers who at this period were called 'drug-store cowboys', but now she went out of her way to stop in front of the Crystal and study the pictures of the cast: McDermid bejewelled in Richelieu and terrifying as the Emperor Jones; Miss Maggie Sample comic as Mrs. Wiggs; and the pale glory of Irma Wheat as St. Joan.\n\nDearest to Bethel of all these pictured gods was Elsie Krall, a fragile girl who seemed, for all the stiffness of her Shakespearian ruff and brocade, not much older than herself. If she had one friend like Elsie, she would attack Broadway in another year, and a year after that she would be a famous actress!\n\nWhen the large red-and-black show bills were plastered about town, and the names of Mr. McDermid and Miss Wheat stared at her, she felt as though it were her own name that was thus startlingly discovered.\n\nThe first play of the McDermid season was The Silver Cord, by Sidney Howard, of whom Bethel had never heard—as she had never heard of Pinero or Somerset Maugham or Clyde Fitch. The press notes said that the play was 'a story of mother love fighting for itself'. Bethel pictured the mother as a pioneer in a log cabin, doing exciting things with an axe.\n\nShe wanted so feverishly to go to the opening night that she did not let herself go till Wednesday. But it was a youthful self-discipline in her (the kind that might some day take her through all-night rehearsals), rather than a Connecticut Puritanism whereby anything she wanted to do was wicked. By no discipline, however, could she keep away longer than Wednesday.\n\nIt was a part of the era and the country that it did not occur to her parents, since it was known that she had no taste for glossy young drunks, to prohibit her going out by herself in the evening, provided she was back by eleven-thirty. And even in these depression days, when the family were putting off buying a new car and Mr. Merriday was worrying about having to cut the staff in his store, it was sacred to them that Bethel should have 'her own income'—two dollars a week, theoretically her salary for working in the store on Saturdays.\n\nShe could get no one to go with her to the theatre.\n\nShe knew that her father and mother and brother would no more go to a play than to a chess tournament, and that neither Charley Hatch nor Alva Prindle would pay a dollar to hear six actors, when for half of that they could see six hundred. Bethel felt as lone and venturous as a young-lady Christian martyr in a den of Roman lions. She longed to wear her party dress of yellow taffeta, but even as a Christian martyr she could not endure the comments of her brother, and it was in the humility of skirt and sweater that she went off to her first play.\n\n'Give you a lift?' yelled Charley, as she passed the Hatch cottage.\n\n'No! I—I got to meet a friend,' said Bethel.\n\nThe crowd that was wavering into the Crystal Theatre was none too large, but Bethel was a little frightened by it. She felt herself the only greenhorn and hoped that she would not betray herself. By the most acute figuring she had arrived at the theatre exactly five minutes before the announced curtain time, so she was a quarter of an hour early. She was in awe of the veteran-looking doorman, who snatched her ticket and irreverently tore it, of the young gentleman who was demanding hats to check, of the supercilious girl ushers.\n\nShe climbed, panting, to the balcony, and came out under a noble ceiling with frescoes of pink goddesses sitting on gilt clouds and leering. She was shamed by having to crawl past the rigid knees of four early-comers, and wanted to apologize to them, and was afraid to. But when she had sunk down on the stony leatherette seat in the front row of the balcony, she felt secure, she felt at home.\n\nShe looked beatifically at the curtain, which appropriately depicted the Bay of Naples. The orchestra members, handsomest and most artistic of men, crawled from under the stage and scratched themselves a little and whispered and looked up—not at her, Bethel hoped—and then relented and sat down to play a Wienerwalz.\n\nBethel's soul skipped with ecstasy. She read every word in the slim programme, even the advertisement of The Mount Vernon Funeral Home, Where Sympathy Is Our Watchword, Phone Night or Day. She noted that Elsie Krall, the girl actress whose picture she had loved, was playing a character called Hester. She primly folded the programme, then bent over the rail and prayed for a larger house. But the place was only half filled when her heart turned over as the orchestra shivered and stopped. The house lights were dimmed, and for the first time during the fifteen years that she had waited for it, Bethel knew the magic pause, the endless second of anticipation, with just a fringe of light at the bottom of the curtain, before it went up.\n\nShe had never been so happy.\n\nInstantly she was disappointed. Here was no battling mother in a frontier cabin, no fetching young man in buckskins, but a girl of to-day reading Sunday newspapers of to-day in a room that might have been in any of the old 'mansions' on Bucks Hill, Sladesbury. But she saw that the girl on the couch was Elsie Krall, and that the pictures had not revealed Elsie's surprising copper hair, or the eggshell texture of her skin, pale above cheeks scarlet with make-up. She seemed frightened; and Bethel loved her for it; felt herself up there on the stage, reassuring Elsie.\n\nBut Bethel's affections, so bewilderingly fickle this evening, instantly shifted to Caryl McDermid, as the star himself opened the double doors and smiled his way on stage. He was Apollo in single-breasted heather mixture. He couldn't be more than twenty-eight, decided Bethel. Of course that was thirteen years older than herself, but if she grew fast and caught up with him, maybe she could some day know him and win his heart.\n\nHe was speaking, in a voice hearty and electric: 'Isn't mother at home?'\n\nShe loved the lily-swaying Irma Wheat, as Christina; and with a hate warmer than love, she hated Maggie Sample, the stage mother; a handsome, authoritative, menacing Juno of fifty. And all the while she forgot that she was at a play. This was life, and she was in it.\n\nShe hadn't known that there were plays in which the characters talked like real people, and in which you could live and struggle and forget yourself.\n\nThe story was of a mother who, to hold her sons, was willing to break up their marriages and reduce them to babyhood. Bethel particularly loved the brave Hester—Elsie Krall—fiancée of the younger son; she bounced in her seat with hope that Hester would leave the young pup.\n\nIn the intermissions, she did not go out, and she glanced rather snippily at people so unimaginative that they could chatter and walk about. And all the time she knew, beyond argument, that she was going to be an actress.\n\nShe came out of the theatre as drunk as a bacchante; a pitiable and happy sight. She wavered home under the summer elms, and felt that she was shouting poetry, though she was not thinking at all about moonlight and roses or swords and barricades, but repeating over and over, rather queerly, 'Sterility—that's your professional mother's stock in trade'. As she came up to the Merriday porch, where Charley Hatch and her brother Ben were dangling their legs and discussing gliders and Colonel Lindbergh, she stopped, staring at them, swaying.\n\n'What's the matter with you, Toots? You stay up too late. Gwan, get to bed,' said her brother.\n\n'All right.'\n\n'Did you like the show?' demanded Charley.\n\n'Yes—I guess so—all right.'\n\n'I knew you wouldn't like it!' crowed Ben.\n\n'I did so! I thought it was the most wonderful thing I ever saw.'\n\n'Rats!'\n\n'I did!'\n\nShe wanted to cry, but she mastered it and crept up to her room, her refuge.\n\nShe paced, unable to stop and undress. She found herself re-enacting the play and, curiously, it was not her own Elsie Krall whom she mimicked, but the mother. Sitting on the edge of the bed, crouched, obviously broken, yet with a hint that she enjoyed showing off her woes, her elbows on her knees and her hands dangling absurdly, she muttered,\n\n'\"I'm not asking you to be sorry. It's—\" How did it go, now? \"It's Robin I'm thinking of. And now that I'm old and sick... dying—\"'\n\nHer memory ran out, but she could not sleep. She was acting a thousand plays; she was an Arabian woman watching her son die of hunger; she was a Russian princess and then she was a Russian commissar accusing the princess; she was a 'bathing cutie', very tough; and she was a ghost-pale abbess. She clawed her complete Shakespeare down from the shelf and read a dozen speeches from The Merchant of Venice aloud, sitting primly in a straight chair by the window, where the net curtains whispered in the night.\n\nPortia's speech, of course; but more eagerly, Jessica and Lorenzo.\n\nShe was on the avenue in Belmont; the trunks of the great trees—lime trees, was that right?—were white-washed, and visible in the silvered darkness.\n\nThe moon shines bright: in such a night as this,\n\nWhen the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees\n\nAnd they did make no noise, in such a night\n\nTroilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls,\n\nAnd sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents\n\nWhere Cressid lay that night.'\n\nThus Lorenzo, round and manly. She laid the book down on the edge of her small bureau, on the starched white cover embroidered with violets; she held out unsteady hands; she leaped up (not in the least knowing that she was doing so) and in the mirror watched her face grow soft, her lips imploring. She hastily sat down and read on. She was Jessica:\n\n'In such a night\n\nDid young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,\n\nStealing her soul with many vows of faith\n\nAnd ne'er a true one.'\n\nThe audience was hushed. She had been so wistfully gay; so tender yet so appealing. Then the applause, like a breaker! By the window again, she was reading:\n\n'... Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow sea; the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried...'\n\nThus Salarino, on a street in Venice. She saw the street perfectly; it ran by a canal, under archways. (She laid her head on her arm on the window sill.) She herself—yes, she was Salarino; masked and cloaked, hand on rapier hilt, slipping off to a rendezvous. A gondola, in the canal below, was revealed in the light from a lamp far up in a harsh wall, and Salarino saw—Bethel saw—a girl in white satin, flower-crowned, in the arms of a man young but bearded and angry-eyed...\n\nShe started out of her dream and it was dawn. She was painfully stiff, but she was in ecstasy. Then she shook her head vigorously, rubbed her shoulders, and snorted, 'Don't be so silly, Bethel! Go to bed!'\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHOWEVER much she tried to conceal her emotion when she told him about having seen The Silver Cord, Charley Hatch saw that it was going to be difficult to 'cure her of this crazy notion that she was going to try and be an actress'.\n\nCharley was a friendly boy, rather like a kind old milk-wagon horse. His hobby was collecting stamps. 'You learn a lot about geography and foreign places and so on from stamps,' he stated. He wanted to be a farmer; but to his father, who himself had come from a farm, this would have been a shocking retrogression from his urban position as superintendent of a bus line; so Charley was planning to become an osteopath. He had soft tow hair on a large, thick skull, and he whistled constantly.\n\n'Lookit, Beth,' he implored, as they sat on a branch of a maple, twenty feet up in the air. 'Of course a girl wouldn't know about all such things—'\n\n'I bet I would!'\n\n'—but you got no idea what you'd be up against if you tried to go and get to be an actress and went looking for a job on Broadway. It's full of pitfalls.'\n\n'Pitfalls?'\n\n'Pitfalls.'\n\n'What kind of pitfalls?'\n\n'Awful pitfalls! Managers and all like that, that betray young girls.'\n\n'How do they betray them?'\n\n'You wouldn't understand.'\n\n'What do they do to 'em?'\n\n'Beth! What language! It ain't ladylike. Golly! You're already showing what awful influence the stage has got on you. You don't want to be immoral and bohemian, do you?'\n\nWith the utmost sweetness, like an indignant wren, Bethel explained, 'How do I know? I don't know what you have to do to be immoral, but of course if I have to, to be a great actress, why then I have to. Don't you see?'\n\n'This is awful! I never heard anything like it! You don't know what you're talking about!'\n\n'I do so know what I'm talking about!'\n\n'You do not know what you're talking about.'\n\n'Oh, shut up!'\n\n'Shut up yourself, telling me to shut up!'\n\n'Oh, Charley, I'm sorry if I was rude.'\n\n'Oh, that's okay. But I don't think you had ought to be immoral, just the same.'\n\n'Well, maybe I won't have to. And honestly I like loganberry juice much better than beer. Gee!'\n\nUpon Bethel's solicitation, Alva Prindle did go to The Silver Cord Wednesday matinee. And she hated it. Bethel met her at the Rex Pharmacy for her report.\n\n'It was so talky!' Alva complained into her cherry sundae. 'Maybe some folks might like it, but what I say is, it don't hold your attention, like a movie.'\n\n'Twice as much!'\n\n'It did not! There wasn't anything happening. Not even a penthouse or a machine-gun. All talk!'\n\n'Alva, you just wait till I get to be an actress—'\n\n'So you're still going to be an actress!'\n\n'I certainly am. And I'm going to talk on the stage—oh, about everything—about patriotism, and love—'\n\n'Why, Beth-el Mer-ri-day!'\n\n'—and why a person feels religious—'\n\n'It would be awfully improper to talk about religion, right up there on the stage. They never do, in the movies. People hate it.'\n\n'But I will—honestly I will. And I'm going to get up a dramatic society in high school next year.'\n\n'That'd be kind of fun.'\n\n'It'll be kind of hard work, too, let me tell you! There's not going to be any fooling around when I get up a play!'\n\n'Oh, there isn't, eh! You think you know so much! I bet you don't even know what a stage door is!'\n\n'I do so!'\n\n'How do you know?' scoffed Alva.\n\n'I read about it.'\n\n'That's a heck of a way to learn about things—to read about them! But I bet you didn't dare go to the stage door at the Crystal.'\n\n'You didn't?'\n\n'I certainly did!'\n\n'Alva! And you saw the actors, close?'\n\n'I certainly did. And I got old McDermid's autograph, and Elsie's and Irma's.'\n\n'Oh, you didn't bother them for their autographs!'\n\n'I certainly did! What would you talk to actors for, except to get their autographs?'\n\n'Tell me, Alva—oh, tell me! Is Mr. McDermid as handsome as he is on the stage?'\n\n'Him? Old Mac? No! He's maybe forty-five, and he wears a wig.'\n\n'Oh no! Oh, darling! It couldn't be! Oh, not forty-five! Almost as old as my father! And a wig! But I don't care. I think Mr. McDermid is just—uh—adorable.'\n\n'You do, eh?' Alva had regained all her Hollywood superiority. 'Well, let me tell you, baby, Mac's married to that red-headed little dumbbell, Elsie Krall. You better stay off.'\n\n'Oh no! How do you know he is?'\n\n'The stage doorman told me. And Mac treats Elsie terrible, the poor kid.'\n\n'Do you know what I think?' said Bethel. 'What?'\n\n'I think you're a liar. You're like that mother in the play. Good-bye!'\n\nThis from the meek Bethel who, year by year, had let Alva snatch her lollypop, her scooter, her beaux.\n\nShe waited till no [sic] Wednesday, the second week of the McDermid company's season, when they played Dulcy with Elsie Krall as the ingénue Angela. She had to know about Alva's strictures on her favourite gods. She was there on Monday evening, not embarrassed now, and when her last agitated laugh was finished, she marched down the alley to the stage door, rather wishing that Alva could see how professionally she went about it.\n\nThe stage entrance was at the back of the theatre, on a rotting balcony overhanging Swan Creek, now a sewerlike trickle between muddy banks, but once, when Sladesbury was a country town, a handsome stream. She was annoyed by the crowd of three girls with autograph albums, but she wrapped herself in an imaginary cloak—black lined with crimson—and waited, mysterious under an arch in Venice.\n\nThe magic beings were coming out of fairyland, and Bethel knew that she was right about them.\n\nCaryl McDermid—yes, he must be forty-five or more—quite an old man—but that certainly was no wig, that lovely mane thick as horsehair, and he smiled so easily, took in the autograph hunters with his gaily curved lips, his innocent eyes. Elsie was on his arm, clinging, adoring. And there were Irma Wheat, whose smiling made her more beautiful than on the stage, and the terrible Maggie Sample, the overwhelming character woman, who was a pillar of ice.\n\nBethel tried to resist, but as these four walked through the alley, down Charter Oak Avenue, with its red neon lights over bowling alleys and cafés, she followed them, glad that they really were so beautiful... even if she did notice that Mr. McDermid's elbows were shiny, and Elsie's heels worn down. To what glamorous party were they going? Would they meet professors and newspapermen from great Hartford? Was Mrs. Beaseley Payne's sixteen-cylinder Cadillac waiting to whisk them to splendours at her pine Gothic castle on Bucks Hill?\n\nHer idols were turning into Boze's Beanery... they were casually sitting down at a long marble-topped table... they were ordering hamburgers and flapjacks and coffee... and Bethel heard Elsie addressing McDermid: 'Oh, darling, I think I'm stinking in Dulcy. I wish to God I could act,' and heard Maggie Sample's snappish, 'So do I—wish you could!'\n\nBethel was sitting at the other end of that Beanery table, too scared to move, her voice breaking as she ordered, 'P-please, a chocolate éclair and a g-glass of m-milk.'\n\nThere was an elegance about Caryl McDermid that was hard to define. His suit, of soft blue flannel, was glassy at the seams; he wore a commonplace soft white shirt and solid blue tie; but there was an unwrinkled firmness and smoothness about his cheeks and chin; and the lapel of his coat curved as though he had magnificent shoulders. His smile was consuming; it took in everybody, as though he loved them yet realized all their absurdities.\n\nElsie Krall, his wife—the child must have been thirty years younger than he—was frail copper and ivory; the statuette of a stilled dancer; but her eyes were not alive like McDermid's. They rested always on him, gratefully; and imploringly on the bitter Miss Maggie Sample.\n\nThey were real gods, as Bethel had known they must be.\n\nShe was not shocked by the undivinity of their chatter. Probably she really had the professional stage virus in her system.\n\n'Maggie,' said McDermid, 'I wish you wouldn't wave your arms so, when you make your cross in your scene with Forbes, in two.'\n\n'Elsie, listen darling, don't yell so when you say to me, \"It was just the most romantic thing that ever happened in the world\". Can't you underplay it a little? Dulcy is a comedy, you know!'\n\n'Say, did you see that Ramona Snyder has been cast for the name part in Stop It, Rosika? They go into rehearsal in August,' said Irma Wheat.\n\n'And is she lousy! I bet they don't pay her a hundred and fifty, and no run-of-the-play contract,' said Maggie Sample.\n\n'Don't mention money. I don't know what we got a box office for,' said McDermid.\n\nIt was the catsup bottle that introduced Bethel to them, though this did not surprise her, since she loved the romantic catsup label with its legend: 'Made only of fresh ripe tomatoes, onion, salt, and rare and imported spices from the Orient.'\n\n'Please pass us the catsup,' said McDermid to her.\n\n'Oh—yes.' It was a convulsive effort, but Bethel got out, 'I—I loved the play to-night.'\n\n'Oh, did you, honest? Was I terrible? I just can't seem to do these swell society girls,' wailed Elsie Krall.\n\nFor all her loyalty, Bethel had confusedly felt that Elsie really had been fairly 'terrible' on the stage; awkward and bouncing. But she lied like a gentleman. Then—oh, she had to know; it was her whole life—Bethel blurted:\n\n'How can you get to be an actress?'\n\nElsie stared. She looked as though she were asking the same question herself. McDermid smiled. Irma Wheat said, 'God only knows! But what do you want to go on the stage for, anyway?'\n\nMaggie Sample was like Lady Macbeth in one of her moments of exasperation with her husband, as she protested to Bethel, 'Do you want to starve? I've been on the stage thirty years, and here I am in this flop of a stock company in the sticks—'\n\nMcDermid smiled. 'Hey, hey!' was all he said.\n\n'—and next fall I'll be lucky if I get a job as a kosher ham sandwich in a Number Two Company of Abie's Irish Rose. When you grow up, child,' and she smiled at Bethel, 'you try to squirm into prison, or get a nice job hustling hash, or even get married, or anything to avoid going on the stage.'\n\n'You know you'd rather act than eat, Maggie,' said McDermid.\n\n'That's only because I never get a chance to eat.'\n\n'Now don't discourage this young lady. She has wide-awake eyes. Maybe she's felt the call to the stage.\n\n'Shabby and crouched and shockingly fed,\n\nWhistling, he sits on his unmade bed\n\nIn the airless bedroom down the hall,\n\nAnd smiles because he had heard the call\n\n(At Equity minimum!) back to the stage—\n\nRusty beggar or golden page—\n\nClaudius, Hamlet, or Player King—\n\nThe glory that flutters wing on wing—'\n\n'Oh, you and your Lambs Club poetry!' Miss Wheat scolded at McDermid, as she arose, with the sardonic Maggie Sample. 'You're going to be telling this poor, deluded kid that it's better to climb up on the steam pipes in a dressing room in order to keep your feet out of the water when the toilet has busted, and to sit up all night learning seventy-five sides, at sixty bucks a week, closing on Saturday, than it is to work in a grocery store. Me, that've got it on Gloria Swanson from ankles to consonants, playing in a dump behind a factory in Connecticut. You can keep it. Caryl, darling, if you weren't my boss, and if I didn't love you distractedly, I'd tip you off that you're as screwy as a Russian director.'\n\n'No. He's not bright enough,' said Miss Sample.\n\nExeunt, Irma and Maggie.\n\n'It isn't true, what she said. It is fun to be on the stage, isn't it?' Bethel begged of Elsie.\n\n'Yes, I guess it is. I don't know yet. I been acting such a little time.' Elsie looked troubled. 'I was waiting on table in Teneriffe Junction, in Iowa, when Mr. McDermid came along and married me. He's been so sweet—yes, you have, too, Caryl—but I guess he gets kind of impatient—oh, I don't blame you, darling. It's so kind of hard for me to understand why a lot of the characters act like they do. Take like last week; why did Hester—Did you see me in Silver Cord then?'\n\n'Oh yes!'\n\n'Oh, I'm glad. But I don't guess I was very good. But why did Hester fall for a softie like Robin? Honest, it's so kind of hard, all this acting. But I love the travel. I collect things—from department stores. We only been married a year, and I got an Austrian peasant costume from Marshall Field's and a pair of python shoes from Halle's, in Cleveland, and a brazeer from Sicily, all hand-embroidered, in Columbus, and all kinds of things. But I do get scared—all those hellhounds in the audience coughing!'\n\nMcDermid said hastily, 'Elsie is about as new to it as you are, my dear, but you'll both make good. And—How do you get a chance to act? Well, first you get all the training you can. Training! Act wherever you can—even if it's in the barn. And then get God to pass you some good luck. That's all I know. And it's worth it. Even if you aren't much good—and me, I guess I'm probably just the run-of-the-mill ham—even so, when you've been creating a human being, and living in him, then the rest of the world outside the theatre, with all its fussing about houses and motor cars and taxes, seems pretty shabby. Acting—it's a heightening of life. I guess we're all stage-struck, us old troupers, no matter how we kick.'\n\n'And do you think maybe I could do it?'\n\nMcDermid studied Bethel, rubbed his nose, droned, 'Maybe so—maybe so. Let's see. Get up and walk to the door and back.' When she returned, his appraisal was warmer. 'You're pretty graceful, and you have some spirit in you, and a rather warm voice, for such a thin kid, and you watch things—you see how things are done—I was watching you watch us. Yes, I think you probably can act!'\n\nIt was her accolade.\n\nAs they went out, Elsie whispered to her, 'Come see me in my dressing-room.'\n\n'Oh, I'd be pleased!'\n\n'And we can play with my doll. I got such a funny doll—so long-legged and so sweet. I've never told a soul but you that I still play with it—not even Mac—Mr. McDermid. I don't know anybody in Sladesbury—they all seem so grownup and busy here. Will you come see me?'\n\n'Oh, I'd love to!'\n\n'Come next week then.'\n\n'Yes!'\n\nBethel was intoxicated with the friendship of this, her first real actress. But she never saw Elsie's dressing-room. The McDermid stock company closed, that Saturday night, and she did not meet Caryl McDermid again till years afterward, when he told her of Elsie Krall's dying of pneumonia in a hospital in Hollywood, looking bewildered and a little frightened, and clasping to the end a long-legged, armless doll.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n'YOU know Gale Amory—she's such a grand girl, you'd never expect to find her in a hen college. Well, she was to play the husband's part in Doll's House, you know, Ibsen, it was the senior-class play, and she came to rehearsal all made up like a man, I mean, double-breasted blue suit of her brother's, and she's so feminine, everybody laughed their head off. So, of course, they all began to cut up and laugh and kid their lines, and the girl who played Dr. Rank, she ran out and came back with a burnt-cork moustache, and of course, I mean that simply convulsed them, and she said in a deep voice, I mean, it was a serious line from the play, but she burlesqued it and she said, \"At the next masquerade, I shall be invisible\", and everybody simply howled! And then Gale goes out and puts on a moustache, too!\n\n'Why, even Miss Bickling—Professor Bickling, who teaches Drama, Poetry, and the Novel and that coaches the plays—of course I mean she's deadly serious about art and culture and she's so fat and respectable and eyeglassy, but she got to laughing as hard as anybody, and it was terribly hard to go on with the rehearsal, but then it was such fun and after all, wasn't that the real reason for doing the play—to have fun, the last few weeks of those long four years of college?\n\n'In fact the only person that beefed about it was Bethel Merriday; she was playing Nora, so probably she felt like a star or a prima donna or something. Beth is a sweet girl, even if she does get so daydreamy, and she's not a grind, and she certainly does share her candy and introduce her dates around. But for some reason or other, she takes plays so doggone seriously. And she turned on Gale and she had a regular fit of temperament and she screamed, \"Will you take off that fool moustache and quit trying to play Room Service? You haven't got the slightest idea yet whether, as the husband, you're supposed to be a stupid, decent book-keeper, or a sadistic stuffed shirt, or what, and here dress rehearsal is only a week away!\"\n\n'Well! You did have to admire Bethel, mostly so quiet, like a sparrow, standing up to that big Gale Amory, but still—\n\n'Poor Miss Bickling looked so uncomfortable. Of course she was supposed to be coaching the play, but all she ever said to any of the actors was, \"I don't know—maybe if it feels awkward to stand there so long, you better move around a little, and make some gestures—that's it: try to think up some gestures that will look interesting\", or \"Maybe you better speak a little louder\". So when Bethel butted in like this, Miss Bickling was embarrassed as the dickens. She was kind of fond of Bethel, because she always read poetry aloud so lovely, but of course she couldn't stand a tantrum like this, and she said, \"Bethel, dear, I know you're very interested in drama, but after all, this is college, and we want to act like ladies and not like paid actresses, don't we!\"\n\n'\"No, I don't,\" Bethel said.\n\n'Imagine!'\n\nIt was seven years—or seven excited moments—since Bethel had talked to the Caryl McDermids. The time was May 19th, 1938; twelve days before she would become twenty-two, three and a half weeks before she would graduate from Point Royal College for Women, in Connecticut. To-night she would be starring in A Doll's House, but this afternoon, at the panicky, hastily called extra rehearsal, it did not look as though there would be any senior-class play whatever.\n\nThe dress rehearsal, last night, had lasted till two a.m., and it had been scandalous. Miss Gale Amory, as Torvald Helmer, did not know her part, and whenever the prompt girl—a terrified and outlawed freshman, crouched on a chair, almost hanging her head inside the window in the right wall—was able to find her place in the script and to throw the line to Miss Amory in an edgy whisper, Miss Amory screamed, 'Please! I can't hear you'. Nils Krogstad did know her, or his, part, but she wasn't sure whether she was a comic villain who ought to close one eye and tap her nose, or a Russian victim of fate who talked deep down and inaudibly. She tried it both ways.\n\nThe amateur stagehands had dropped one of the flats for the rear wall and torn a gash, and not till the dress rehearsal had anyone discovered that the music of the third-act tarantella, conveyed by an aged phonograph, could not be heard in the second row.\n\nBethel was better than that. She did know her part, and she could be heard, and she had some notion that Nora was an amiable little housewife who had never been trained by responsibility. Whether she shouted too loud and wrung her hands too much is a matter of opinion, but just now the appalled Professor Miss Bickling looked on Bethel as a combination of Nazimova and Max Reinhardt, and it may be that our Bethel, just for the day, felt that way herself.\n\nThis afternoon, five hours before the performance, they were, with glue and frenzy, repairing the irreparable. Six people were cuing Miss Amory all at once. Miss Bickling was urging Krogstad to take it easy, and Bethel was begging Krogstad to take it hard.\n\nThe rest of the time, Bethel was standing absent-eyed in corners, muttering 'Noyesterdayitwasparticularlynoticeableyouseepausehesuffersfromad readfulillness'. The college engineer—a male, and no artist—was patching the ripped canvas of the flat, and one of the girl musicians was practising a Spanish dance on a hastily imported piano, so placed behind scenes that no one could reach the dressing-rooms without banging her legs on the keyboard. The pianist, though she would not be seen by the audience at all, already had such stage fright that her music sounded like terrified teeth.\n\nIn the midst of this merriment Miss Bickling received a message, beamed, and called Bethel aside, with 'What are your plans for the summer, Beth?'\n\n'I guess I'll just stay home.'\n\n'But you still want to try and go on the stage, in the fall?'\n\n'Yes. Anyway, I'll tackle all the managers on Broadway. They might give me a chance as walk-on.'\n\n'What's a walk-on?'\n\n'It's where you walk—on.'\n\n'I see. Well, of course I think being a librarian or getting married or going to Switzerland is more educated than being an actress, but still—You'd like to act in one of the summer theatres, wouldn't you?'\n\n'Oh yes, but I wouldn't have a chance.'\n\n'You know, I tell all my girls that I look after their careers just as much as I do their conjunctions, and I've used all my \"pull\", as you girls call it, and to-night, right in the audience, will be two ve-ry celebrated proprietors of summer theatres in southern Connecticut—Mr. Roscoe Valentine and Mr. Jerome Jordan O'Toole.'\n\n'Oh dear!' said Bethel.\n\nAt dinner in Bemis Hall, before the play, it was dismaying to Bethel that none of the girls were nervous and taut like herself; six hundred hearty young women, gulping chicken hash, clattering their forks, yawning, shrieking about biology and the boys, and making up their lips; carefree and pink and scornful. How could she make them believe in Nora to-night?\n\nShe ate her pudding (cornstarch pudding with canned raspberries) as slowly as possible, to put off the terrifying hour of going to Assembly Hall, their temporary theatre. She tried to smile cordially while the girl beside her related with vulgar cheerfulness her experiences with a canoe, a portable radio and a C.C.N.Y. man. They were precisely such experiences as the girl's mother had had with a canoe, a banjo and a Princeton man, and to Bethel they seemed antiquated compared with the woes of the Nora who had first slammed her door sixty years ago.\n\nShe wanted to escape from these chatterers, but as she slipped out of Bemis Hall, a LaSalle drove up, and in it were her father and mother and brother and Charley Hatch.\n\n'We thought we'd drive down and surprise you and see you act!' cried each of the four, in turn—so smiling, so sweet, so devastating.\n\n'Oh, that's dandy! I'll see you right after the show. Come backstage!' she chirruped, while she was quaking that it was going to be bad enough to forget her lines and make herself ridiculous before the jeering students and two summer-theatre managers, without giving herself away to her trusting family.\n\nShe cried for a good two minutes in her dressing-room, which until one hour ago had been the consultation room of the Professor of Pedagogy and Vocational Psychology; she rolled her head on her dressing-table, which had been the professor's desk, covered with graphs about the relationship of coffee drinking at lunch to the three-p.m. sale of (a) automobile tyres, (b) Dopey Dolls, (c) advertising-column-inches in trade journals. She did not belong with graphs or anything else that was new and brisk and important in A.D. 1938.\n\nShe was pale enough always; now she felt herself funereal; and as she shakily started to make up, she plastered her cheeks with a vermilion base and felt better and braver about it. She knew nothing about make-up, but then, neither did the college theatrical dictator, Miss Bickling, who would have felt it rather low to let Ophelia associate with blue lining salve. The one thing Bethel was convinced of was that you always use heavy grease paint and always extend your eyebrows with burnt cork (which you don't). She was proud of slapping her face with powder and getting the powder all over a huge apron she had borrowed from the Bemis Hall kitchen.\n\nWhile she made up, she stared now and then, like a solemn child, at the portrait of Professor Maria Martin Mitz being vocationally psychological in cap and gown.\n\nWhen Bethel was done, she looked like an extravagantly painted doll, with very red cheeks, very long black brows, and a very white little nose absurd in the middle of the sunset. Later to-night, on the stage, the effect would not be improved by lighting that was a ferocious illumination by spots, with no gelatins to soften the glare. But nobody minded. The college dramatic enthusiasts—if they were going to have make-up, they wanted it made up, and no nonsense.\n\nTo Bethel and the other members of the cast, Professor Miss Bickling was of the greatest help. She came in every two minutes and patted their shoulders and cooed, 'I know you're going to be just wonderful, dear, and be sure now and don't forget your lines'. This was a mild form of what was known in Point Royal College as a 'pep talk', and it had, on writhing amateur actresses, the effect of so irritating them that they were sure now and did forget their lines.\n\nDespite this balk, Bethel was much clearer than at dress rehearsal as to how she saw Nora's shrill little character. She had asked Miss Bickling about it all, and the benevolent professor, who kept culture as she would have kept a tearoom, had purred, 'You mean you want to break down the character? Oh, leave all that psychological fussing to the left-wing theatre. It hasn't anything to do with Art. Just be careful to say the lines as the author wrote them—only, you must say them beautifully, of course—lines like \"Never to see the children again—oh, that black icy water\"—and then you can't go wrong.'\n\nBut, in rebellion, Bethel had tried to think out by herself what Nora really was; what she herself was, as Nora; and having heard the whole cast and Miss Bickling agree that Nora was a very nice young married woman who suffered from an unimaginative husband, Bethel was agitated to find that she considered Nora a fool, in expecting a banker husband to regard forgery as just a little joke between friends, and none too kindhearted a fool, in boasting of her domestic security to the desolate Christina.\n\nIf this was true, fretted Bethel, wouldn't it be much more explosive if, in the last act, Nora were more aware of her own childishness than of her husband's stuffiness?\n\n'I'll do her that way!' exulted Bethel. 'It'll be tremendous.'\n\nBut she had the grace to jeer, 'Of course there is the little matter of your being such an amateur that the audience won't know whether you see Nora as a gun-moll or an abbess!'\n\nThe cast took turns, feeling ever so professional, in peeping out through a hole in the curtain at the audience, which was brutally cheerful in not having to remember lines: cynical fellow-students in bright sweaters, officially cheerful professors, timid parents. Bethel could not find her own family, and felt abandoned, and she could not make out any two men who might be the fate-laden summer-theatre directors, Messrs. Valentine and O'Toole... Oh, what of it, what of it, what of it! They'd laugh at her feeble Nora anyway, and she'd have to go home... maybe marry Charley Hatch... no, she wouldn't... oh, why not?\n\nShe stood outside the double-door entrance, ready to go on at the beginning of the play. She was a small, resigned figure in a bobtailed Victorian jacket, a small bustle, a skinny fur and a prim little hat. For a moment, in panic, certain to be jeered by the audience out there, the fiendish demanding Audience, the AUDIENCE, she had been certain that she couldn't remember a single line. Now she was too numb to care. If the curtain would just go up, so she could get it over! Did the student orchestra have to go on showing off all evening? She hated the sour and trailing air of 'Weis' du wie gut'. She concentrated on the wheat-coloured canvas and the flimsy crossbar of the backstage side of the double doors. She wondered in what previous play they had been used; what the stencilled DL7 on the canvas meant.\n\nThen she was jarred almost into screaming by Miss Bickling's loving and altogether devastating pat on her shoulder. Then silence from in front—no music, no rustle of audience. Something gone wrong? Then the stage manager's confident voice, 'Curtain's going up, Beth', and instantly, propelled by a power not her own, Bethel-Nora was scampering on the stage and saying cheerfully, her voice as steady as her hands were jittery, 'Hide the Christmas tree carefully, Ellen'.\n\nShe was Nora; she was an actress; she was born.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBETHEL played the first two acts in a still and competent fury. Gale Amory, her stage husband, was the creator of the fury, and the cause was not Gale's incompetence, but her extreme competence in faking.\n\nPerceiving that she would never be able to remember her lines, the bonny Gale decided to treat it as a joke and to share the joke with the audience. So whenever she stopped to listen to the prompter, she smiled at her friends down there like a tooth-brush advertisement—if Gale wasn't strong in intellect, she was extraordinary in whiteness of teeth—and her pals wriggled with affectionate entertainment and muttered that this was the first time that Ibsen had ever been amusing.\n\nFor the first time, when Gale burlesqued her line 'My little bird must never do that again' and got almost as good a laugh as if she had kicked a baby or fallen on her nose, Bethel had enough wholesome ham in her to be tempted to join in the fun, but she angrily rejected it, and fought through, making herself as much the kindly, half-baked, tortured Nora as she could. She was too busy keeping up pace to notice whether she herself was good or not, while she was on the stage, but in her dressing-room between acts she had time to decide that she hadn't been too bad.\n\nShe had felt authority. But not till her great last scene of breaking with her husband did she feel inspired.\n\nThen (she believed) a great new spirit filled her, and she was Nora, she was all Noras, all women who are bewildered by the brutal and incomprehensible whims of stranger-husbands. As though she were hammering nails she pounded at Torvald—at the Gale Amory now a little embarrassed and much less sportive—'I believe that before all else I am a human being, just as much as you are—or at least that I should try to become one.' She raised her voice, raised her arms; a priestess before the altar; the priestess of the new cult of the awakening women. 'Henceforth I can't be satisfied with what most people say, and what is in books. I must think things out for myself, and try to get clear about them.'\n\nThe applause came crashing; and at the end, when she slammed the door, she felt that she was not closing a door but opening one on life... first nights on Broadway, velvet-hung first nights in London, famous authors with scripts, and a terrace in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she would sit being gaily learned with Lunt and Fontanne and Noel Coward and Helen Hayes and Katharine Cornell and Orson Welles.\n\nShe scampered to her dressing-room—a complete success, after eight curtain calls.\n\nIt was the first dressing-room reception she had ever held. It was a whirlpool of beaming eyes, handshakes, voices saying that she was 'wonderful', that she 'had a great future if she should ever care to accept a position on the stage', that 'she had been much the best thing in the play—much!' She wasn't deflated even by the fact that from next door, from Gale Amory's dressing-room—which tomorrow would again be the Domestic Science and Dietetics Seminar—she could hear 'You were much the best thing in the play, Gale—you were wonderful—you were so human!'\n\nBethel felt that she was acting an actress in the dressing-room rather competently—the pleased modesty, the clinging smile. In the midst of people she could make out her family, and see Charley Hatch looking at her as wistfully as a lost lone dog, Miss Bickling coming down from her synthetic ivory tower to say firmly, 'You did splendidly, and I was very angry with Gale for clowning, and I'm going in and tell her so', and a whole puppy-rollick of classmates, mocking, 'You certainly showed up the husbands, Beth!'\n\nMiss Bickling cleared them all out. Mr. O'Toole of the Dory Playhouse was waiting; Mr. O'Toole had to get back to New York that night.\n\nSo, in glory, Bethel met her first producer.\n\nMr. Jerome Jordan O'Toole, at forty-five, had directed seven Broadway plays—two of them surprisingly successful—and for twenty years before that had acted chauffeurs, tramps, detectives and such other examples of what playwrights, peering out of their clubs, regard as the Common People. He was Yankee-Irish, from Bangor. He was tall and dry and sunken-cheeked; hard and exact and honest. In summer he was managing director of the Dory Playhouse, at Hardscrabble Beach, Connecticut, which was classed as one of the dozen summer theatres that were competent and professional.\n\nBethel, heart fluttering, didn't know whether to sit still, as a confident actress, doing something or other with cold cream and Kleenex, or to stand humbly in the presence of power, and before she had time to figure out the interpretation of her role, Jerry O'Toole was in the doorway, like Abraham Lincoln in tennis costume, and she had popped to her feet and stood blushing.\n\nMiss Bickling crowed, 'This is our lovely little heroine, Miss Merriday.'\n\nO'Toole shook Bethel's hand with a croaking 'The performance was very interesting' that was more completely a nothing than anything Bethel had ever heard.\n\n'Was I as bad as that?' she begged.\n\n'No. You weren't bad. Of course the others were all of them excellent—splendid.'\n\n'Oh-uh!' of bliss from Miss Bickling, and a diminutive 'Oh' of chagrin from Bethel.\n\n'They weren't trying to act at all, and they did that very well. They managed to turn Ibsen into a farce, and I guess that requires a college education—I never had one. But you, my dear—' He held Bethel's hand in his long wide brown hand, which felt comforting. 'You were trying to act, so I'll compliment you by applying professional standards, and by them, you were pretty bad. You showed that someday you may be able to act, if you ever get any training. But you were pretty bad! You overplayed everything. You made Nora sound like a kitchen mechanic scrapping with the iceman. But you were alive.'\n\n'But—' She did not know that she was copying his hitching style. 'Then I guess there's no chance for me to get into your summer theatre this season?'\n\nHe gave what seemed to her a curious answer: 'Not till you've been lucky enough to fail a few times. Then come see me, my dear. Good luck!'\n\nHe was gone; a broad-shouldered, gaunt man who moved easily.\n\nMiss Bickling had scarce got through protesting to Bethel that she was disappointed, that Mr. O'Toole had proved to be nothing but a Broadway Commercialist and a Heartless Algonquin Wit, when they were interrupted by the pleasant exuberance of Mr. Roscoe Valentine, who always carried his own private sun.\n\nMr. Jerome O'Toole's summer stock company, the Dory Playhouse, and the Nutmeg Players, conducted by Mr. Roscoe Valentine at Point Grampion, Connecticut, were both on the shore between New Haven and New London, twenty miles apart, and the feeling between them was that of caviare for butterscotch sundae. Roscoe Valentine, aged fifty, was a man composed, except for his brains and his indignant red eyes, entirely of powder puffs. In winter he was a Bostonian and a scholar, editor of a magazine of the arts called The Spiral, and director of The Spiral Theatre, where Back Bay met the backwoods in one-act glorifications of a proletariat that they actually hated and misunderstood.\n\nBethel had never seen a man like this: so squashy, so giggling, so spiteful, yet so calmly understanding of everything a woman thought before she finished thinking it. His hand felt like a cold wet piece of oiled silk, as he held hers and bubbled:\n\n'Splendid, my dear! You gave an entirely new conception of the role of Nora.'\n\n'Do you hear that?' said Miss Bickling.\n\n'Oh, thank you!' said Bethel.\n\n'Yes—oh, indeed yes,' said Mr. Valentine.\n\n'Mr. Jerome O'Toole told Bethel that she overacted,' said Miss Bickling.\n\n'Jerry O'Toole must have been reading a book again. It always takes him that way. One time, he was quite a good stage manager. He knows all about carpentry, but don't you think, my dears, it's just on the too-too side when he talks about the social drama? No, my poppet, don't you worry. You did Nora with real éclat. So beautifully fallible.'\n\nBethel didn't know what it was all about. She never would be adept at doing word tricks. She looked at Valentine like a shivering kitten, and Miss Bickling carried on for her.\n\n'That's so kind of you. I'm sure Bethel and I appreciate it a lot.' (Bethel wasn't at all sure.) 'Now she feels that she has a calling to the stage, and after to-night I'm sure she has, and we're wondering if you could make a place for her in your summer theatre?'\n\n'Why, I think perhaps I could.'\n\n'Oh, how gorgeous!' said Miss Bickling.\n\n'Oh!' said Bethel.\n\nValentine sat down facing the back of a wooden chair. And that was the first time, outside of the movies, that Bethel had ever seen this posture, and she noted and put away the fact that it made his fat knees prominent and very silly.\n\nHe spoke youthfully:\n\n'Now as we're just three girls together, let's let our hair down and be frank. You know there's no box office at all in the summer theatres. Even a roundneck like O'Toole can't make it pay—in fact, if you want to know, I make more than he does! But even so—And for the apprentices, such as you'll be, Miss Merriday, I have simply splendid teachers, with practical lessons in voice and eurythmics, and the chance to appear in my plays with famous actors. So I'm compelled to charge each student actor two hundred and seventy-five dollars for the ten-week season, and fifteen dollars a week for room and board—really below cost. Do you think you could dig up all that fabulous wealth—four hundred and twenty-five dollars?'\n\nAnd to Bethel it was fabulous wealth. 'I don't know. I'll try to. I'll try so hard.'\n\n'When can you find out?'\n\n'My family are waiting outside. I'll see them now.'\n\nThe senior Merridays and Charley looked small and rustic in the stretches of the Assembly Hall stage, gazing distrustfully at a red-headed co-ed in shorts who was moving scenery. Bethel flew up to them, her dress three-quarters buttoned, her hair uncombed.\n\n'What is it—what is it, dear?' urged her mother.\n\n'Anything gone wrong?' her brother demanded, rather gladly, as though he were going to have a chance to hit someone and restore his own superiority in this over-feminine maze.\n\n'Oh no, it's just—Daddy, I can be in a summer theatre this summer, with real actors, and then be ready for a job on the stage this fall, in New York, if you can let me have four hundred and twenty-five dollars for the lessons. But honestly, I'll pay it all back, as soon as I get a job—'\n\nHer father fretted, 'Well, finances are pretty tight, just now, and I had hoped you'd begin bringing in a little before long. And I guess I don't understand girls now. When I was young, girls were glad to stay home and marry some nice fellow, but now seems like they all want to go off some place and be actresses or fly to Australia. No, I don't understand it but—Yes. We'll fix it somehow. My girl's going to have her chance!'\n\n'I don't need a new Chevvy this year,' said her brother.\n\nFor years, Bethel was to be at a disadvantage when young actresses explained that they had the most interesting excuses for every lapse, because their parents and brothers had been so unimaginative, unsympathetic and generally so American.\n\nAs she went to bed, she exulted that she was a real employed actress now; that in just a month she would be at the Point Grampion school. But there was something irascible lurking behind the bland joy, and she dared to drag it out:\n\n'I did overdo Nora. It wasn't good enough. I wasn't good enough!'\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nALL those two days at home, June 15th and 16th, 1938, before she went off to the summer theatre at Grampion, she earnestly enacted the role of a girl saying good-bye to childhood and to every loved spot that her infancy knew: the cement garage, the pergola on which the Concord grapevines were always rather dry, the basement playroom with the tracks of the electric railroad which she had inherited from Ben.\n\nShe also devoted herself to sound self-examination—she tried to.\n\nShe felt, and quite guiltily, that she ought to be devoting herself to worrying about the dispossessed Jews in Germany and Poland, the share croppers in Oklahoma; and, if not doing anything about them—for obviously she never would do anything about them—at least showing herself a right-thinking liberal by hourly agonizing, 'Oh, isn't there something I can do?' But she had to admit that what she wanted was much simpler: she just wanted to act.\n\nShe felt guilty because none of her life had been conspicuously devoted to 'doing things for other people'. That was Professor Miss Bickling's war cry and nursery ditty: 'The greatest joy and privilege in life is doing things for other people.' But Bethel found that she coveted dancing lessons, fencing lessons, French lessons, piano and voice and make-up, for herself.\n\n'Well then, I guess I'm just that kind of a selfish pig,' she lamented.\n\nShe was equally dissatisfied with her examination of the status, to date, of the Heart of Bethel Merriday. She wasn't quite sure that she had one.\n\nCertainly, if the test was, as she often read, lying awake longing for the smiles and caresses of some particular young man, she had no heart, as yet. She liked the laughter of the young men and their hard handshakes, but she wanted to jeer when she heard Alva Prindle or Gale Amory yearn that some curly-headed, pipe-flourishing young male was 'just wonderful'.\n\nAlva had given up her claim to Hollywood. Already a little stringy at twenty-three, she was devoted to the hope that one A. Alexander Brown, a fat insurance agent with the optimism characteristic of all insurance agents, would marry her and provide a mink coat and a set of etched cocktail glasses. Not toward Alva, not toward her father and mother and brother, did Bethel feel guilty, but toward that shaggy house dog, Charley Hatch, who had been compelled by family deficits to give up his dreams of osteopathy for a job in the sales department of the Flamolio Percolator Corporation.\n\n'You don't think maybe you'd rather marry Charley, he'll be making thirty-five dollars a week pretty soon, instead of going off and taking such an awful chance on the stage, do you?' her father had said.\n\n'No!' said Bethel.\n\n'Well,' said her father.\n\nOn her last night in Sladesbury, Charley came calling, and they sat on the porch.\n\nAmericans making love have always sat on porches, except for those who were too poor or too rich. In the house was electricity; Mr. Merriday was reading about the tear-gas bombing of strikers in the aeroplane industry, and Ben drawing television diagrams; but Bethel and Charley sat on a porch in New England and, despite all announcements that the whole world has changed since 1920, no one could have told them from their grandparents.\n\n'Look, Bet, while we got the chance to be alone together—'\n\n'You must drive down to Grampion this summer. I'll bet it'll be awfully cool on the shore.'\n\n'I sure will, but look—'\n\n'I hope there won't be a lot of mosquitoes.'\n\n'I guess there won't be, but—'\n\n'Isn't it funny how you can be awfully earnest and excited about something like acting, and then some silly little thing like mosquitoes will throw you right off!'\n\n'Bet! I want to talk seriously—'\n\n'Please don't.'\n\n'You know how doggone fond I am of you.'\n\n'Yes, I think I do, but—Oh, Charley, don't make me feel guilty. Maybe I'm the bloodless kind of girl that can't ever devote herself to any man. But I've got to go on. Honestly, please believe me, I do envy the girls that can settle down to a nice little home, but for me—prob'ly I'm crazy—it doesn't seem good enough.'\n\n'You'll never find folks that you can depend on like you can on your home folks. In the world outside, they'll use you and then throw you away like a worn glove.'\n\nShe studied Charley. His soft hair was babyish and pathetic, yet his large, solid head seemed fatherly and protective. Was she a fool to leave this eternal kindness?\n\nShe sprang up. She cried 'No, no, no, no!' and fled into the house.\n\nNone of them could drive her down to Grampion that day—Friday, June 17th—and she went by train, which was, for one of the Modern Merridays, like travelling by oxcart.\n\nShe was overwhelmed into complete guilt by Charley's farewell present: a make-up box.\n\nIt was the most beautiful, most elaborate make-up box, with every cosmetic she had ever heard of: two kinds of rouge, evening and daytime lipstick, skin freshener, powder, mascara, nail polish in two shades, 'Dawn Delight' and 'Faint Memory', 'nourishing cream' and the humble cold cream.\n\nShe cried over it. Not for three weeks did she discover that the only things that were of the smallest use to her were the cold cream and the empty tin box.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nGRAMPION CENTRE was a picture-book village. Red-fronted chain stores and crimson gasoline pumps had enterprisingly tried to improve its quiet quality out of existence, but Grampion was all gambrel roofs and elm trees and white steeples and white cottages with small-paned windows, and the quickening smell of salt marshes.\n\nIt was Bethel's new-found-land, and she was another pioneer of the American tradition.\n\nThe only conveyance at the station was a sedan, at least ten years old. The driver, a young man with a yellow sweater and a blue denim shirt, thrilled her by clucking (and not laughing at her, either), 'You one of the actresses, miss? Jump in. You'll have a good time this summer.'\n\nThey drove through marshes, grey-green and still, crossed a tidal creek, and came to a mile-long bay, with sun-clipped waves. Twoscore sailboats were at anchor. On one of them, three handsome burnt youngsters, in white ducks, white jerseys and white boating hats, were getting up sail, and they waved at her hopefully. Then the sedan skirted a private estate with bayberry hedges and came abruptly into the Nutmeg Theatre grounds, which occupied a quarter of the square-shaped Point Grampion and had Long Island Sound to south and westward.\n\nBorn in the hill-circled city, going to a college on the Housatonic River, Bethel little knew the sea. She looked across the Sound some ten or twelve miles to the blurred shore of Long Island, near Greenport. Fishing schooners were slanting northward, the lofty sail of a yacht leaned perilously, and through the middle distance slipped a freighter from foreign lands. The flickering stretch of the Sound was to her bluer and more fluid and ever-changing than the blue sky above her own hills. She felt superstitiously glad. The Sound was a tributary of open ocean, and she was a tributary of the great theatre. Actresses, she assured herself, if God is good to them, come down at last to the sea and to a ship which will bear them to the lights and cheering in far-off lands.\n\nThe grounds had a sand beach on one side, which promised bathing, and rocks on the other, for loafing in the sun. The flat top of the low bluff was a whole village in itself: the actual theatre building, which had been a church; a one-room building as office; the house of the old-time pastor-farmer, where splendidly lived the director, Mr. Valentine, and most of the seven permanent members of the stock company—all professional actors—and such lordly 'guest stars' as might adorn the casts from week to week; a shop for painting and carpentry; the School of the Theatre—the old pastor's barn, with a small stage and rows of doubtful chairs inserted; and at last, on the sea edge, with tennis courts beside it, Bethel's new home, the dormitory and dining quarters for the apprentices. She was too excited to be critical; otherwise she might have noticed that the dormitory was shakily knocked together of second-hand boards and painted with pigment guaranteed to peel immediately. The windows were narrow and low, their mosquito netting of cotton. But to Bethel it was the Temple of the Muses, all cool marble and bright gold.\n\n'Good luck, miss! Hope you drag the crowds in!' said the driver.\n\n'Oh, thank you. It's wonderful to be here,' she crowed, and her friend drove off, leaving her alone in the Temple.\n\nUncomfortably alone.\n\nShe ventured into the hallway, which was also the living-room, of the apprentices' dormitory. With a scratched upright piano, a long, bare table, a cushionless window seat and a litter of third-hand chairs, rockers and wicker and canvas deck-chairs, the room was a charity home. But Bethel was pleased. She was a worker in the theatre and an insider, not one of the luxurious 'carriage trade' who came in limousines and demanded upholstered seats but were never (she innocently believed) welcomed in the holy places backstage.\n\nThe room was still, there was no one on the uncarpeted stairs; the only stir was from an outboard motor on the Sound.\n\n'Oo-hoo!' she cried, timidly.\n\nThrough a door at the back resentfully emerged a lean man, in overalls, with a stained white moustache.\n\n'What d'you want? You one of the students?'\n\n'Yes, I think so.'\n\n'You think so? Don't y' know? My name is Johnny Meddock. I run this place.'\n\n'You do!'\n\n'Yes, I do! I'm the caretaker. And janitor. I'm responsible for keeping the floors clean and the windows washed and chasing the small boys off. Folks also think I'm a Quaint Local Character. I let 'em think so. It's worth money to me. I even let 'em think I used to be a fisherman here, when this place was a decent churchyard and a fish wharf and not no theayter, with a lot of you young women chasing around and flirting and not enough clothes to dress a pussycat in. I never was. I hate fish. I used to be a janitor in the State Capitol, in Hartford. Well, what d' you want?'\n\n'I suppose I ought to see Mr. Roscoe Valentine, first. Do you know if he's anywheres around?'\n\n'He's in the office—that one-hen coop by the front of the theatre. Yes, I guess you might's well see Roscoe, as Andy Deacon ain't come yet.'\n\n'Andy Deacon?' It was the first time that Bethel had ever heard the name.\n\n'Yuh, he's the real boss here. Andrew Deacon. He makes out he's just one of the actors, but it's him puts up most of the money for Roscoe to blow in. He went to college and everything. Long about twenty-eight, Andy is. Acts on the stage regular—God knows why, rich fellow like him—his dad was J. Goddard Deacon; run the big gun factory up in Worcester. Nice-spoken fellow, Andy is, too—like a Hartford man. But you better see Roscoe. So long.'\n\nJohnny Meddock vanished. He who often remarked that he 'hated theayters and hated their guts' was the most theatrical object in the place. He was Punch and Judy and Policeman and Devil all in one.\n\nBethel, having decided that he was either very hateful or lovable, went searching for the high priest, Roscoe Valentine.\n\nMr. Valentine, in sandals, lilac trousers, a dark blue shirt, a voluminous white tie and English eyeglasses, was at his desk in his small cabinlike office, simultaneously writing an advertisement for The Petrified Forest which, on June 27th, would open the season, dictating a letter to an agent in New York complaining because he had not received another script, scratching his left calf with his right foot and planning a lecture on 'Relaxation, the Secret of Acting'. He looked up at Bethel blankly.\n\n'Yes? What do you want?'\n\n'I just came to say I'm here, Mr. Valentine.'\n\n'I'm so bright that I might have deduced you were here, but I still don't know why you are here or who you are.' He looked for applause from his secretary, a sensible, agreeable-looking young woman, and didn't get it. He was irritated, and demanded, 'Are you one of the apprentices?'\n\n'Why yes, don't you remember? I'm Bethel Merriday. Point Royal College?'\n\n'Oh yes. Nora in Doll's House. You overacted it atrociously.'\n\n'That's what Mr. O'Toole said.'\n\n'Oh, he did, eh? But even Mr. Jerry O'Toole can sometimes be right. Well, you go and report to Cynthia Aleshire, my scene designer. She'll put you to work. And begin to learn right now, my pigeon, that if you're serious about your stage career, you've got to do everything you can around here—learn everything about the theatre—everything.'\n\n'Oh, yes sir.'\n\n'Very well then. Marian, skip out and show this baby the shop, and hustle back here.'\n\nThe girl secretary, outside, patted the dismayed Bethel amiably. 'Don't worry about him. His bite is worse than his bark. But he does know something about acting and producing... I hope he does!... My name is Marian Croy.'\n\nMiss Croy was twenty-six or -seven, and placid.\n\n'You're his secretary?'\n\n'No, I'm an apprentice, like yourself. I've been teaching school for six years, out in Nebraska—I organized a town dramatic club. I've saved up enough money to take one year off, for a shot at this place and then Broadway. God knows why I want to act! I always say it's because I like to read Maeterlinck aloud (I hope you don't think he's too sentimental, too!), but maybe it's to try and escape from the prairie winters. If I don't make a go of it, I'll go back and marry Oscar Heyden—he's a nice man, but he looks just the way his name sounds... Am I babbling, Bethel?'\n\nShe loved this kind woman, as Marian went on:\n\n'I am, but you know, I'm just as lonely and scared here as you are. But busy! Roscoe found out I knew shorthand, so he put me to work. That's how you learn to act here—doing everything that Roscoe would have to pay to have done—scrubbing floors or addressing envelopes to theatre subscribers or driving up town to buy cigarettes. I do hope you don't know pedicuring, or Roscoe'll probably have you doing his sweet, pink, plump toes. Good luck, dear. Miss Cynthia Aleshire, scenery boss—Miss Bethel Merriday, freshman.'\n\nCynthia was a trim, tall, Greek-coin lady of thirty-five. Bethel did not believe that she would ever know Cynthia, but she instantly felt herself one with the apprentices, sprawled inside the work shed and in front of it, repainting last year's scenery a flat grey. They were a joyful crew: two girls in shorts and jerseys; three young men in overalls, or sweaters and grey flannels.\n\nThere was the plump, jolly, hither-eyed Toni Titmus, who had just finished freshman year in the University of Wisconsin, but who at the moment thought that she preferred playing English duchesses to playing basketball.\n\nAn almost anonymous, fresh-faced girl named Anita Hill.\n\nPete Chew, a round, stupid, wistful rich young man who had taken to the drama only after having been dropped by Amherst, Rollins College, and the Schenectady Flying School.\n\nWalter Rolf, slim, competent, decent, twenty-three or -four and a track runner. It was Walter Rolf's misfortune that, however much you tried to avoid the word 'clean' in describing him, you were sure, in the end, to pigeonhole him as a Clean Young American. He looked like a Princeton Man, and by a coincidence he was a Princeton Man, with a dash of Oxford.\n\nLast of the crew, incredible as a student actor, was Harry Mihick.\n\nLike Marian Croy, Harry had come to the theatre late; unlike her, he was that most portentous of bores, the yearner who knows that he is much more artistic than he is. Harry was forty; and at home, in Hannibal, Missouri, he was a bookkeeper. He was also an actor, in the Y.M.C.A. Drama Guild; a poet, in the Southwestern Christian Advocate; and a dramatist, in nothing perceptible. The gang had concluded that Harry had come to Grampion to find someone who would listen to his play plots. He would stop swimming to discuss his psyche, and he wrote poetry to all the girl students. It was pretty good poetry, too—by Richard Lovelace.\n\nOf these apprentices, Bethel guessed that only Toni Titmus and Walter Rolf had talent. But that made two more young actors than she had ever worked with before, and she was content, though later she was to calculate that her estimate may have been too high, by two.\n\nThey all knew so very much about the theatre. As they painted and glued and hammered, and constructed the lunch counter for The Petrified Forest, they gave final verdicts:\n\n'Claire Luce and Wally Ford were both of 'em too doggone sophisticated in Mice and Men. I wouldn't of played Claire's role that way at all. I'd of made her more awkward. You know. Small-town.'\n\n'I didn't think Cedric Hardwicke was so hot. He made the canon so darn heartless. I felt he was showing off, all the while. Too much technique. Now if I'd had that role, I'd of shown how deeply he felt everything underneath. Of course Sir Cedric is nothing but an Englishman. How could he play an Irishman? Of course, I'm not Irish, either, but still...'\n\n'I don't know how the Lunts could waste their time on foolishness like Amphitryon. I like a play that's got some social significance. Maybe if I'd been running their schedule, I'd of stood for The Sea Gull, but these French plays—Whatever you may think about the Russians, you certainly got to admit they got art!'\n\nThe practically senile Harry Mihick (aged forty) had greeted her. 'Well, Miss Merriday, I hope you're going to take advantage of this intimately associating with artists and having a chance to brush up on ideals this summer.' Nobody laughed much, either.\n\nListening to their wisdom, peeping in awe at Toni Titmus as she perkily revealed that she had once been introduced to Jo Mielziner, the scene designer, at Sardi's, Bethel felt that she was again a freshman.\n\nHow many more times would she find that she had graduated only into new freshmanhood? Freshman as a baby, freshman in her first year in grammar school, freshman in high school, freshman in college, freshman in a summer theatre, freshman on the professional stage—perhaps freshman in marriage and freshman as a star—would it end only with death and her awakening to freshmanhood in heaven?\n\nBut she was rescued from humility when she discovered that these airy habituées of the Nutmeg Playhouse, these blasé upper-classmen, had been here only twenty-four hours longer than herself. By the end of an hour's painting she was becoming one of them and was saying some pretty profound things about gag lines. She had discovered that if she endured their idiocies without laughing, they would stand for hers.\n\nThe sea wind ran across the rough wild grass, touching her hair; and she was really painting a stencil on real scenery; and she was in a world where she could talk about the theatre from eight a.m. to two a.m.\n\n'I—I—I think I'm going to like it!' she burst out to the beautiful Walter Rolf.\n\n'Sure,' he said convincingly.\n\nIt was more than good enough.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nBETHEL'S dormitory room, a double room which she was to share with Iris Pentire of the stock company, was as utilitarian as a boxcar. It had two cots, two straight chairs, two tilted bureaus, with blisters in the paint, and a row of hooks. But to Bethel, washing up for dinner on her first evening in Grampion, it was enchantment, for on the wall was a last season's poster:\n\nTHE NUTMEG PLAYERS\n\nPresent\n\nMISS ETHEL BARRYMORE\n\nin\n\nTHE CONSTANT WIFE\n\nThis was no bedroom, but the anteroom to glory! Here her friend Iris Pentire and she would be queens of the stage, along with Ethel Barrymore.\n\nCynthia Aleshire, the scene designer, said that Iris, who would arrive to-morrow, was a phenomenon: slim, lovely, only twenty, but already a professional actress and one of the seven Equity-member professionals of the Nutmeg permanent stock company at Grampion. Iris had, reported Cynthia, been a chorus girl, a photographer's model, played stock in Baltimore, and toured in a minor part in Teacher Mustn't Slap. In fact, at only twenty, Iris had as much grilling stage experience as, a generation before, she would have had at the age of six. But as the youngest of the professional stock company, at minimum salary, Iris was to live not in the Bostonian luxury of The House but with the submarginal citizens of the dormitory.\n\nBethel was going to love Iris even if she hated her.\n\nShe stripped off her sweater and slacks, sang in the shower, and in the pride of blue skirt and clean white sweater she ran down to dinner.\n\nThere were sixteen student-apprentices at Grampion. They were unpaid, and classed as amateurs, but each of them was permitted by Equity to appear in three plays during the summer. Higher in the hierarchy were the permanent stock company, with Mr. Andrew Deacon and Miss Mahala Vale as leads, and other visiting professional actors and 'guest stars' who appeared in one or two out of the schedule of ten plays presented during the summer of 1938.\n\nTo-night eleven out of the sixteen apprentices had come, and were being dramatic over veal loa"
