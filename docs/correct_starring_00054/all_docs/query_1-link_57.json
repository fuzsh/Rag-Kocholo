        "text": "I met Maryam d'Abo in July 2006 at Pinewood Studios, when they held their special 'Bond Girls' day.\n\nShe signed my progamme, my Jeff Marshall lithograph and also my 'Bond Girls Are Forever' book, which she co-wrote with Bond expert, John Cork.\n\nLinks\n\nOther film roles followed, including The Browning Version (1994) with Sir Albert Finney, and Solitaire For 2 (1996). More recently, she has appeared in a number of TV dramas.\n\nAlthough her name is unusual, Maryam d'Abo was born in London. Her father is English but her mother is Georgian.\n\nFor The Living Daylights, Maryam had to learn to play the cello \"...without making any sound, otherwise I would have driven everyone crazy. The secret? We used soap on the bow.\"\n\nMaryam did some of her own stunts, including skidding down the snow in a cello case, with Timothy Dalton. She said of this, \"It took three days to film our escape in the cello case. It was scariest for me because I felt out of control, and I was the one steering and controllling the speed!\"\n\nHer first film role was in a forgettable horror film called Xtra, but in 1986 she met Cubby Broccoli who offered her the part of cello-playing Kara Milovy in The Living Daylights (1987).\n\nLike a number of Bond girls, she first started working as a model, but this was really to pay for her studies at drama school.\n\nShe is married to film director Hugh Hudson, famous for Chariots Of Fire (1981) and Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984)\n\nEscape by Cello Case!\n\nMaryam d'Abo signed this page of\n\nmy Bond Girls Are Forever book for me\n\nClick on a name below to take you to that page\n\nMaryam d'Abo\n\nYour browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames."
