At school, once awakened, Winnie meets up with Kevin and acts friendly, but Kevin is still hurt that Winnie chose Kirk McCray over him, and gives her the cold shoulder.\n\nWhen Kevin allows cool kid Gary Cosay to cheat off his test paper, over Paul's protests, the three boys end up in detention. That night, Kevin has another nightmare in the cavern, and, within the dream, he appears in a classroom wearing nothing but his underwear. Next day, Gary convinces Kevin and Paul to join him on an all night camping trip that Friday. The night before the campout, Kevin dreams he's back in the cave, carrying Winnie, who appears to have a broken leg. Suddenly he's back in the schoolroom, carrying a large stuffed rabbit.\n\nThe night of the big campout. Kevin and Paul have brought a variety of snacks, while Gary has brought beer and cigarettes. Kevin tries to fit in with Gary while Paul resists, although he does end up drinking some beer and getting toasted. Paul voices his desire to do «something,» and Gary leads them to a cave - actually a storm drain - he knows of, which of course sends Kevin into a panic, as it reminds him of his dream. As the boys make their way through the dank drain pipe, Gary starts telling them of someone who was killed in these pipes. He fills them with terror. In fear, Paul trips and hurts his leg. Gary's only response is to make fun of their fear, and in disgust Kevin helps Paul get out of the pipe, their friendship with the cool kid severed. They come back to the Arnold household to sleep. Next morning, after we've learned that Kevin did not have the cave dream, Winnie greets he and Paul in the street, and finally the cold shoulder warms, friendships reestablished.\n\nIn every junior high school there's a kid like Gary Cosay; the cool kid who is, for all intents and purposes, without friends or any kind of family to speak of. In retaliation, they strike out against everyone, seeking companionship while spuming it at the same time. Kevin and Paul basically give him every break they possibly can, allowing themselves to enter his world of rebellion, while he seems to go out of his way to prevent entrance into theirs.\n\n«An interesting episode,» notes story editor Todd W. Langen. «Very dark in certain respects and it had a dream-like element to it. I think it was a good attempt at doing something different, something very tonal and different in terms of atmosphere. I guess the episode worked for the most part, but it didn't bowl me over. I think they tried to push the envelope on things, which is admirable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I think this episode worked, but it wasn't quite what I expected. Maybe what I'm talking about is the expectations. The first six episodes, particularly the first three, were so brilliant. I watched the pilot and said, ‹This is fantastic, but there's no way they'll be able to keep this kind of quality up.› Then the second episode aired and I said, ‹God, they did it again. No way they'll do it a third time. It's impossible.› But they did it again, and continued to do so.»\n\nDirector Steve Miner adds, «The network bleeped out the word fart, twice, and I think it was kind of silly. The producers took a stand not to listen to the network, but the bleeping ruins a couple of jokes in there and, for me, I can't watch that show because it makes me crazy. They sell laxatives in between the acts, but you can't say fart on the air. It's kind of bizarre. The kid's mouth is moving but you don't hear anything. As far as the episode goes, we all knew kids like Gary in junior high. It was a fun episode, and I enjoyed doing it.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Eight\n\n«Our Miss White»\n\nOriginal Airdate 12/7/88\n\nWritten by Carol Black and Neal Marlens\n\nDirected by Steve Miner\n\nGuest Starring: Wendel Meldrum (Miss White), E'Lon (Young Martin Luther King), Krista Murphy (Carla Healy), Shea Farrell (Steven)\n\n«Our Miss White» chronicles Kevin's crush on his English teacher. In school, Kevin and his classmates are watching film footage of the recently assassinated Martin Luther King, Jr., and it's obvious that everyone is moved by what they're watching, including Miss White. As the lights come up, we instantly become aware of Kevin's crush.\n\nClass ends and she reminds the students that there's still time for them to try out for the school play. No takers, but as the children depart, she asks Kevin if he would consider taking a role in the political drama she's written, because he would be perfect as Robert F. Kennedy. The older Kevin informs us that he hated every aspect of plays, but the boy says, «Sure.» At home, Jack doesn't understand why Kevin would want to be in a play, but he does agree to pick him up at school after rehearsal each day.\n\nRehearsal. Kevin does the cutest little «Kennedy accent» you can imagine. Afterwards, using Karen's words to him the previous night, Kevin tries to impress Miss White with the statement that «plays like this can raise people's consciousness about racial oppression.» She's pleased to hear his comments, and his feelings for her swell. The «moment» is interrupted by the arrival of Jack. Next day, Jack shows up at the same time and Kevin gets the feeling that Miss White is interested in his father, which falls him with jealousy.\n\nThe following afternoon, Kevin calls his father at work and tells him that he's got a ride home. Then he mopes about not having a ride until Miss White offers to give him one. Once they reach his house, Kevin fantasizes that she reaches over and massages the inside of his leg. Undoubtedly the fantasy probably would have gone further, but one can imagine the letters ABC would have received. Then, abruptly, Kevin considers the image of he and Miss White together, and realizes how ridiculous the idea is.\n\nNight of the play. Kevin is moved to tears by everything he's been through emotionally, and yet this propels him to perform his Kennedy speech perfectly. Afterwards, Kevin walks offstage and it looks like Miss White is about to give him a hug, when her boyfriend steps in front of Kevin and the couple embrace. Kevin and the other actors go on stage for a curtain call, and Jack - the proud father - leads a standing ovation.\n\nThis potentially sappy story of a first crush is surprisingly fresh in the capable hands of the production team. It is handled with tenderness and a sense of vitality that elevates it above what could have been a cliché.\n\nTodd Langen explains, «We talked some times about that episode. The ending isn't necessarily linked strongly to a lot of the other things that happened in the story. In some respects, the ending sort of comes from a different place than the rest of the episode. Yet the ending, because it's so visually powerful, works, even though it's not necessarily born of the story. You wouldn't necessarily think it would work, but it's visually so interesting with the audience, the applause, the cheers and stuff like that. I learned something from that episode. Sometimes imagery and using the right music or words, even if they're not quite correct in terms of context, can still make the ending have an emotional impact.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Nine\n\n«Christmas»\n\nOriginal Airdate 12/14/88\n\nWritten by Bob Brush\n\nDirected by Steve Miner\n\nGuest Starring: Liz Torres (Mrs. Gambino), Mary Gregory (Woman), Tyde Kierney (TV Salesman), Michael Landes (Kirk McCray), Gary McGurk (Tree Man), Robina Suwol (Perfume Lady)\n\n«Christmas» with the Arnolds. Jack is buying a tree - and arguing with the salesman over the price - while the rest of the family is mesmerized by the department store's color TVs, something they have not really seen much of before. This opening scene can't help but raise a smile, particularly for the MTV Generation, which probably can't imagine television without color.\n\nWhile Jack is tying a tree to the car, the boys ask him if they can get a color TV, to which he replies that color TVs cost money and money doesn't grow on trees. In school the next day, Kevin stares at the clock which (humorously) is ticking backwards as the students await dismissal for the Christmas holiday. He meets Winnie in the hall, and she gives him a present. Lying, he says he has something for her and will bring it over to her house. Back at home, Jack is putting together the Christmas tree, growing grumpier by the moment, although Norma's recollections of Kevin's performance in a school play does its share in cheering him up. Leave it to Wayne, though, to ruin the moment by bringing up the color TV again and again. Jack finally discusses the subject, saying that he would probably like a color TV more than any of them, but they simply cannot afford it. That night, Kevin overhears his mother trying to convince Jack to buy the TV because it would make him feel good, and the kids so very happy.\n\nNext night, the Arnolds go Christmas shopping. Kevin and Paul go off on their own to buy Winnie a present. He ultimately chooses a snow shaker housing a ballerina. On Christmas Eve, Kevin wraps his present for Winnie, while Wayne continues to make comments about their black and white television set. Things are rather tense, but Norma does her best to keep things light. As the older Kevin comments, maybe each family is only given so much Christmas cheer, and this year his family had run out.\n\nKevin heads over to Winnie's house, and fantasizes that she embraces him passionately. Upon arriving, though, he's told by a housesitter that the Coopers suddenly decided to spend the holidays away, mostly due to feelings over Brian's not being there to celebrate with them. He leaves the present with the woman. On his way back home, Kevin sees the rest of his family singing carols with the neighbors and joins them Then it starts pouring and everyone but the Arnolds run off, Jack deciding to stand there. They break out laughing and head back home, where the celebratory mood continues.\n\nAlone, Kevin opens up his present from Winnie, only to find a four-leafed clover. He contemplates this for a moment and smiles, the older Kevin noting that sometimes maybe the best you can do is wish someone a Merry Christmas ... and good luck.\n\n«A tough show,» admits Steve Miner. «We had restricted time and hours that you could shoot the kids, and we had a lot of night exterior with rain. We had like eight cameras on that one scene. We had technical problems on that show, but I liked the fantasy when Winnie opens the door. I think that's great, as was the whole idea of the color TV.»\n\nEnthuses Todd Langen, «I thought the ending was brilliant. The whole thing setting up the package with Winnie ... you knew it had to be special when it was opened, because it was built up throughout the episode, and the words and the way it was shot and the whole feel at the end of the episode where the narrator is talking about the fact that at Christmas, the best we can do in life, basically, is wish each other luck. Then he opens the box and there is a four-leafed clover in there. I still get goose bumps when I think of it. I think it was such a beautiful image and a beautiful way to end the episode. It turns out that there was an entire end narration where the camera comes out through the window, shows the Christmas tree glowing and the other houses. It was beautifully written and very poetic. It was about our lives being in black and white and our memories in color, relating to the fact that the episode was about the color TV. It was beautiful. I'm not quite sure why they took it out. Maybe they thought the four-leafed clover was a stronger ending. I have to tell you that I was very impressed with Bob Brush, whose approach was to make the mundane poetic at the ending. That was basically our goal in a lot of episodes, and that came from Neal and Carol as well.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Ten\n\n«Steady As She Goes»\n\nOriginal Airdate 11/1/89\n\nWritten by David M. Stern\n\nDirected by Steve Miner\n\nGuest Starring: William Lanteau (Mr. Frace), Crystal McKellar (Becky Slater), Michael Landes (Kirk McCray), Krista Murphy (Carla Healy), Robin Thicke (Boy), Melissa Clayton (Girl), Michael Tricario (Kid), Jason Miyashiro (2nd Kid), Jeremy Vecs (Kid in Line), Karin Woodward (Waitress)\n\n«Steady As She Goes» provides a rather unique look at the wonderful junior high school Tradition of going steady. In the school cafeteria, Becky Slater informs Paul that Carla Healey is interested in him, and will be at the skating rink that night. Paul feigns disinterest, but mentions to Kevin that they should do something that night ... why not go skating?\n\nThat night, Kevin is feeling kind of lonely as Paul skates with Carla, and he sees Winnie dating with Kirk. Then Winnie blurts out that Becky Slater wants to skate with him. Not quite sure why he does it, Kevin skates over to Becky and asks her to go steady. Almost as soon as he does so, he regrets it. The feeling intensifies over the next few days as Becky's feelings for him start to grow. Acting selfishly, he starts using Becky to make Winnie jealous, and then learns from Paul and Carla that Becky is going to break up with him. Carla points out that he certainly can't blame Becky, because it's obvious that he still likes Winnie.\n\nOutside, he finds a tearful Becky and tells her that he doesn't like Winnie, but at the same time he doesn't really know Becky well enough to like her. Then, she wonders, why did he ask her to go steady in the first place? Kevin doesn't have an answer. They do walk home together, leaving the status of their relationship ambiguous for the moment.\n\nThis is an episode that demonstrates that our hero, Kevin Arnold, is not always such a nice guy, as he clearly does take advantage of Becky's feelings for him to, hopefully, manipulate Winnie's. The end result is that he doesn't get Winnie back, and hurts Becky's feelings in the process.\n\nSteve Miner enthuses, «I really think that's one of my favorite shows. I'm crazy about Danica. Personally, I like her and what she did with that show. I just like certain moments, like when Kevin skates over to Becky Slater and says, ‹Let's skate!› Fred plays those moments really well. Then there's the whole ice-skating rink...it's hard to do stuff like that in half hour television, because you have very little time to do it. I just think this was a really funny show.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Eleven\n\n«Just Between You and Me .... and Kirk and Paul and Carla and Becky»\n\nOriginal Airdate 11/8/89\n\nWritten by Matthew Carlson\n\nDirected by Peter Baldwin\n\nGuest Starring: Donnie Jeffcoat (Eric Antonio), Michael Landes (Kirk McCray), Crystal McKellar (Becky Slater), Krista Murphy (Carla Healy)\n\n«Just Between You and Me .... And Kirk and Paul and Carla and Becky» begins with Kevin and Becky, and Paul and Carla in the Arnold basement, watching a first-run episode of Star Trek and making out. Next day at school, Kirk McCray asks Kevin to speak to Winnie to make sure she still likes him. He barely manages to get the question out, and Winnie responds that she likes Kirk, she just doesn't know if she likes him. Eventually she does break up with Kirk, which gets Kevin's hopes up that she still likes him. He asks Paul to find out whether or not she does.\n\nThen, Kevin is surprised to see Winnie making out with Kirk, and learns that she's going skating with yet another guy that night. Kevin is interrupted by Carla, who wants to know if he's mad at Becky. Kevin catches up with Becky and breaks up with her, claiming that he still likes Winnie Cooper. In response, Becky punches his lights out, which leads to a Star Trek fantasy in which Paul as Mr. Spock tells Kevin as Captain Kirk that they're on a planet of mysterious beings known as women, a race they cannot possibly hope to understand. With that, the women, led by a strangely garbed Winnie and Becky, use a device to stun them. Fantasy over, Kevin goes home to dwell in self-pity.\n\nThat night, he meets up with Winnie and learns that she's confused by what she's feeling. Kevin comes right out and asks if she likes him, to which she responds that she really doesn't know. They do joke around with each other, and the episode ends with Kevin looking hopefully to the future.\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twelve\n\n«Pottery Will Get You Nowhere»\n\nOriginal Airdate 2/1/89\n\nWritten by Matthew Carlson\n\nDirected by Daniel Stern\n\nGuest Starring: Ben Stein (Mr. Cantwell)\n\nAt the outset of «Pottery Will Get You Nowhere,» Kevin's narration discusses the relationship between his parents, noting that they never yelled at each other in front of the kids. He never really thought of his parents being in love, knowing that it was always there, like the ground you walk on.\n\nAs the episode proceeds, we learn that Norma has begun a pottery class and is making bowls, ashtrays, etc., and the only one in the family showing any support whatsoever is Karen, although Kevin does his best. Things grow a little tense when Jack can't find his favorite cup. He eventually does, but learns that Norma has made him a new one, which he uses despite the fact that it's obvious he doesn't care to make a change. A few moments later, Jack accidentally knocks Norma's cup to the floor, where it shatters. Norma is terribly hurt by this, feeling as though he did it on purpose. Things grow even tenser between his parents, a completely new experience for Kevin.\n\nNext day, the argument from the night before turns into a full-fledged screaming match between Norma and Jack, in which we get the feeling that Jack simply doesn't want his wife doing anything but stay home and take care of the family. A moment later, she accidentally burns her hand and breaks down, crying. Jack takes her into his arms and they hug each other, effectively making up. The kids watch, witnessing this open expression of love for one of the first times.\n\nIncredibly moving. That's the only way to describe «Pottery Will Get You Nowhere.» Although through Kevin's eyes, we see other cast members really getting the opportunity to shine. Alley Mills and Dan Lauria deserve a great deal of the credit for breathing such life into these characters.\n\nObserves Todd Langen, «One of the finest episodes in that first complete season, and it was the script that got Matthew Carlson nominated for everything in the book, including the Emmy. What was interesting from a series perspective in terms of the mechanics and the way the series works, is that Kevin was not a main protagonist in the story. It was a departure. It was a case where Kevin was more an observer to what was happening in his family, rather than directly involved in the story. There were times in the season that followed where we tried to adhere to the main rule that Kevin has to be the main man all the time, and we ended up forcing things a bit. I wish we could have done a couple of more episodes like ‹Pottery› where it was freer and he could just be an observer.»\n\n«Television,» he adds, «tends to be very much filled with exposition and people talking. The old saying is that for television you can close your eyes for half an hour and still get the main story. In a movie, if you close your eyes you don't get it, because movies are a much more visual medium. Here was a case in a half hour television show where they used the visual at the end, where Jack and Norma have this final reunion after Norma burns her hand. It was a very subtle, non spoken sequence where he takes her and hugs her, and you understand it somehow without there being words to cover. I like that.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirteen\n\n«Coda»\n\nOriginal Airdate 2/8/89\n\nWritten by Todd W. Langen\n\nDirected by Beth Hillshafer\n\nGuest Starring: Maxine Stuart (Mrs. Carples), Joseph Dammann (Ronald Hershmuller), Brandon Crane (Doug), Alexis Fish (Recital Student), Jake Jundeff (Recital Student), Michael Weiner (Recital Student)\n\n«Coda» begins with Kevin at his weekly piano lesson, the older Kevin informing us that the student there before him, Ronald Hershmuller, is great at the instrument, a fact the boy's mother makes sure everyone knows. The instructor, Mrs. Carples, tells Kevin that he could be a good piano player, if he would give more time to practice. She asks Kevin if he's ready for the recital, but he doesn't want to play, because he can't be as good as Ronald.\n\nWith a little «encouragement» from Jack, who's paying the bills, Kevin practices piano more steadily, although his older self says that it was pointless, because there would always be a Ronald Hershmuller in his way. He relates this to Mrs. Carples, who says that Ronald is a machine, while Kevin has a feel for music, which can be developed and enhanced. She gets him to play a number on the piano, and it goes so well it builds his confidence. In the following weeks, he practices like he never has before, his playing improving constantly. He finally decides to play in the recital at Mrs. Carples' house.\n\nAt the dress rehearsal, Kevin is stunned to learn that Ronald is playing the same piece that he is. Ronald goes first and does very well, which serves to shake Kevin's confidence. When Kevin begins to play, he starts screwing up and can't stop. This results in his deciding not to play in the recital after all, and giving up the piano. The next day, after hanging out with Paul, he rides his bike by Mrs. Carples' house and through the window sees Ronald playing the piano.\n\nAs older Kevin notes, «I never did forget that night. I remember the light glowing from Miss Carples' window, and I remember the darkness falling as I sat out there listening. Now, more than 20 years later, I still remember every note of music that wandered out into the still night air. The only thing is, I can't remember how to play it anymore.»\n\nThe Wonder Years serves up another winner, this time a bittersweet tale of unfulfilled dreams and untapped potential.\n\n«This was from the first group of ideas I pitched to them,» relates Todd Langen. «I used to play the trumpet back in high school and college, and I pitched this story about Kevin being in band class, playing the trumpet and about the troubles he has playing in a band recital, how he freezes up and can't play. The idea got turned around in ‹Coda,› an episode about Kevin taking piano lessons. Neal and Carol felt the piano was a bit more recognizable, that more people had taken piano lessons than trumpet lessons. It sort of comes a little from personal experience in that Kevin has this big failure during his piano recital, and it's about giving up the instrument for the wrong reason after that.»\n\n«One of the nicest things about ‹Coda› is the way it resonates with the audience, especially at the end where Kevin says he gave up music. I think it hits people, because it's about giving up something for the wrong reasons; having something that you thought yon might have been good at as a kid, but were afraid to find out and just kind of left it. I think that, more than any other episode, touched a chord with the audience. A great experience all around. There was, however, originally a fantasy sequence in that episode that got cut. Kevin imagined himself playing in this recital. He ends up on stage in this tuxedo and there's a grand piano up there with him, and he's playing before a crowd. We were going to do all these cute little inserts, like crowd scenes in Carnegie Hall and shots of Queen Elizabeth and Nixon applauding like crazy. Then he was going to get up, this beautiful girl was going to give him flowers and kiss him, and as he walked off stage he was going to pass the janitor, who turned out to be Ronald Hershmuller. It got filmed, but cut. I don't know how it happened, but ‹Coda› ended up almost 10 minutes too long in the rough cut. That's just an incredible amount of time in a half hour show. So they ended up cutting out a lot of the humor.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Fourteen\n\n«Hiroshima, Mon Frere»\n\nOriginal Airdate 2/15/89\n\nWritten by Matthew Carlson\n\nDirected by Steve Miner\n\nGuest Starring: Ben Stein (Mr. Cantwell), Laura Mooney (Girl in Science Class), Sarah Jo Martin (Angela), Ian Fried (Doug), Erin Reed (Angela's Friend), Addie Friedman (Kevin-as an Old Man), Sam Bernstein (Wayne as an Old Man)\n\nAt the outset of «Hiroshima, Mon Frere,» the narrator details the history of the relationship between he and his brother Wayne, in which his older brother is constantly beating him up, probably because Kevin was born in the first place.\n\nIn school, Kevin and Paul try to come up with an idea for their science experiment. Paul's thought is to use the school's hamster in some way, and Kevin gives in to him. On the bus, Paul takes the hamster out of its cage and talks to it, when Wayne pulls the rodent out of his hand and threatens to hurt it if Kevin and Paul don't back off. Then he uses it to make breast jokes about one of the girls on the bus. That night, Kevin and Paul are doing their experiment in the Arnold household. Jack and Norma are going out to the movies, and Wayne, who thinks a girl named Angela is coming over, wants them out of the kitchen. After the parental units leave, Wayne pulls the hamster out of the cage and threatens to drop it down the garbage disposal, unless Kevin agrees to move the experiment into his bedroom.\n\nTwo hours pass. Kevin goes downstairs to get some water, and he sees Wayne on the phone basically begging Angela to come over, and pretty depressed that she won't. Making sure he isn't seen, Kevin sneaks back upstairs, wanting to spare his brother any embarrassment. A moment later, however, Wayne bursts in, «armed» with a vacuum cleaner. The noise startles Paul, who lets the hamster loose. Being as obnoxious as ever, Wayne turns the vacuum on, jokes around and accidentally sucks the hamster up, killing it. All of Kevin's anger swells up, and he confronts Wayne, the narrator informing us that he didn't hate his brother's gut .... he hated his brother!\n\n«You know why Angela didn't come over, Wayne?» asks Kevin. «Because she doesn't like you. She doesn't. Nobody does. You may be bigger than me and stronger than me, but I have friends. Nobody likes you, Wayne. You're just mean to everybody all of the time, because nobody likes you. You're pathetic!» Then we get the image of an atomic explosion, and Wayne is reduced to near tears.\n\nNext day, Kevin and Paul bury the hamster. Several days later, Kevin and Wayne finally talk about the situation. Wayne gives his best attempt at an apology, noting that he hopes Kevin doesn't think he meant to do it. Kevin accepts this, the older version informing us from that day forward the two brothers knew that their relationship would never be the same, because, now, Kevin had the means to hurt Wayne.\n\n«The first big Kevin/Wayne episode,» says Todd Langen. «It was a great idea and great execution. The entire script had originally been presented as a ‹March of Time› old newsreel where the narrator is sot of in and out, doing this whole thing, so the entire metaphor of the episode was about war. It was really clever and well done, but for some reason they backed away from that a little bit. You still have the metaphor of war, but it's interesting to see how things evolve sometimes. What is interesting in the metaphoric message is that Kevin, who is beleaguered by his older brother and set upon all the time, gains a weapon in his arsenal that he can use it to hurt Wayne - ‹Nobody likes you, Wayne!› Yet what happens is that he learns that having that weapon can be an awesome and dangerous thing, and it alters the relationship. He sort of disarms a little bit at the end and goes back to conventional warfare, which is like belting each other and rolling around in the park. I like that metaphoric relationship. In fact, some of the episodes that work best are when there is a metaphoric relationship between what is happening on the surface in the episode and what's really happening beneath. More than any other episode, ‹Hiroshima, Mon Frere› got more negative mail than any other because of the sucking up of the hamster. You can do anything you want to the people, but, man, you hurt a pet, watch out!»\n\nAdds Steve Miner, «The thing about that show is that it kind of pissed off a lot of people, because we killed a hamster. We didn't really, but some people thought we did and accused us of being barbaric. I think it was kind of daring to do that kind of story at 8:30 at night. I thought Jason was real good as Wayne, there was some funny stuff in it and the hamster was a real pain in the ass. You can't tell a rat what to do. You did see just a touch of humanity in Wayne, but there's a lot more in Kevin than there is in him. I think it has some interesting cinematic moments in it. I'm an older brother, so I'm sure my brother felt the same way about me. It brought back some memories and made me feel guilty about some of the things I did to my brother. The show definitely brings all that kind of stuff back.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Fifteen\n\n«Loosiers»\n\nOriginal Airdate 2/28/89\n\nWritten by David M. Stern\n\nDirected by Steve Miner\n\nGuest Starring: Robert Picardo (Coach Cutlip), Dustin Diamond (Joey Harris), Salim Grant (Patkus), Johnny Green (Stetson), Art Hoffman (Grimly), Adam Jeffries (Simeonee), Matt Norero (O'Hara), Marshall Raduziner (Norklen), Larenz Tate (Basketball Player), Kyle Thompson (Rygot)\n\nKevin gets his ire up in «Loosiers,» first when Coach Cutlip takes all of the fun out of basketball by insisting on doing a wide variety of diagrams on the blackboard, which serves to all but put his students to sleep. Then he chooses four captains to pick players, and Paul is the next to last to be chosen. He performs poorly on the floor. This continues for several weeks, and his confidence is completely shaken. Kevin complains about the «system» to Cutlip who, in response to having his method called unfair, decides to make Kevin a captain.\n\nKevin's first choice of player is Paul, which causes the other students to laugh. From there he starts picking all of the supposed «losers» of the class; the ones that everyone saves for last choice. Naturally this results in a disastrous score for Kevin's team, but at least he got the chance to make his statement, and things don't turn out too badly when Paul throws a ball that hits Cutlip on the head, sending him out of the gym. Suddenly, the game becomes fun again as everyone shares a laugh.\n\nWe cut to Kevin's backyard, where he and Paul play a game of one-on-one, and then there's a dissolve to the two of the in silhouette-as adults, playing the same game. The friendship, despite its occasional humps, will last.\n\n«I shot more film for that show than anyone has probably ever shot for half hour television,» laughs Steve Miner. «I had three cameras going at high speed on all the basketball stuff, so I shot about a feature's worth of film on that. Everyday the studio was saying, ‹What the hell's he doing?› We had the kids playing basketball, tried to stage those sequences to look right, shot it in slow motion and got coverage at the same time so it would all match. Bob Picardo was also so good in that show as the coach. When the ball hits him on the head, you're watching it at regular speed and it looked like it was going to be great, but to see it in slow motion in the screening room, you see how funny it really was.»\n\nExplains Todd Langen, «A very interesting idea, that sometimes you have to go back to just having fun when things get too serious. Using basketball and the whole gym experience to show how things can go wrong and how your friendships can be upset by that, was a clever idea. It was a fun episode to examine the friendship between Kevin and Paul. One of the best images was the ending, and the final shot of Kevin and Paul playing one-on-one basketball as adults, silhouetted against a great sunset. That was one of the most beautiful images that ever ended an episode, and it's great to see that they're still going to be friends.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Sixteen\n\n«Walk Out»\n\nOriginal Airdate 3/7/89\n\nWritten by Matthew Carlson\n\nDirected by Steve Miner\n\nGuest Starring: Denis Arndt (Mr. Tyler), Linda Hoy (Mrs. Ritvo), Raye Birk (Mr. Diperna), Michael Manasseri (Mark Hooper), Paul Harkins (Rusty), Melissa Clayton (Karen), Linsay Price (Lori), David Brian Markus (Student Body President), Kyle Thompson (1st Boy), Brandon Crane (2nd Boy), Robin Thicke (3rd Boy), Sean DeVertich (4th Boy), Tanya Fenmore (1st Girl), Misty McCoy (2nd Girl), Sheila Pinkham (Strange Woman)\n\nAs «Walk Out» begins, older Kevin observes that by 1969, the population was getting Vietnam for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In a sense, they were becoming immune to the images projected on the TV screen.\n\nPaul and Kevin (involuntarily) become their respective homeroom representatives for the Student Council. Most of the council is worried about things like ice cream and a jukebox in the Cafeteria but one kid suggests they be a part of the national protest to walk out during class - which is the aspect that gains unanimous support.\n\nAt an ensuing meeting on this subject, the assistant principal addresses the council, stating that all the students who walk out will get suspended and it will go on their permanent record (incidentally, just what the heck is the fabled permanent record that school authority figures always talk about?). Afterwards, this leads to a discussion of why they should protest Vietnam (which happens to awaken Kevin's desire to understand the subject a little better), and leads them to gather over 400 signatures in support of a walk out. The assistant principal doesn't care, as he makes clear to them. He then talks to Mr. Tyler, who cautions the students that if they go through with this, there could be consequences.\n\nThat night, Kevin remembers the principal's words, and fantasizes that he is an Astronaut about to get on a rocket, but is pulled off at the last second because of what's on his seventh grade permanent record. He nonetheless decides to go through with the walk out, but Mr. Tyler doesn't come in that day, which is a shocking blow. At the appointed time, however, Kevin walks out of the classroom, and he races into the bathroom where he thinks he'll be ill. However, other students who have seen him start to walk out of their classroom, and it's only a short matter of time before all 800 students go out to the football field, singing John Lennon's «Give Peace a Chance.»\n\nAn effective episode, but what really happened to Mr. Tyler? Was he sick? Fearful of losing his job? Or perhaps he was letting the students make the decision regarding the walk out on their own. There is no mention of this whatsoever, and there should be.\n\n«Fun to do, but I don't remember a lot about it,» admits Steve Miner, «except that we did a lot of location work for it. I do wish I'd gotten to do the last shot over again. That shot with all the kids walking out .... no matter how many years you're doing this stuff, you can always learn something new every day you're on the set. I just would have staged it differently.»\n\nConcurs Todd Langen, «I had a little bit of a problem with the ending of the episode. Just the idea of an entire school walking out like that, I had a bit of trouble buying. But I did like the idea of the episode. I did like the idea of Kevin's being picked for a committee, like a juke box committee and all these different ones, and his saying, ‹Let's go to the Vietnam committee, because the line is shorter.› I like that, because it's true to life.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Seventeen\n\n«Nemesis»\n\nOriginal Airdate 3/14/89\n\nWritten by Matthew Carlson\n\nDirected by Daniel Stern\n\nGuest Starring: Wendel Meldrum (Miss White), Crystal McKellar (Becky Slater), Krista Murphy (Carla Healy), Michael Landes (Kirk McCray), B.J. Barie (Huge Kid), Skip O'Brien (Bus Driver), Sean DeVeritch (Bobby), Laura Mooney (Donna)\n\nIn the beginning of «Nemesis,» we are reminded that love has no fury like a woman scorned. At the same time, Kevin shares meaningful glances with Winnie in class. Suddenly we see Becky Slater, and it's obvious that she is not happy about being dumped. A flashback shows that Kevin had done his impressions of just about everyone, and she takes great pleasure in making his life hell by sharing these little revelations with all those concerned. The timing for this couldn't be worse, because things are really moving between he and Winnie, particularly since she's been sick and he's been taking care of her. Upset that he would talk about other people in such a bad way, she suggests he apologize to everyone.\n\nKevin begins by apologizing to Paul, who «pays him back» by letting loose with a wide stream of insults. From there he meets Becky outside the school, with the theme for Clint Eastwood's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly playing on the soundtrack. They approach each other like gunslingers, sagebrush actually blowing by the camera. Kevin asks why she's doing this, and apologizes yet again for hurting her. She has not gotten over the pain of being used to get to Winnie. Kevin tries to tell her he did like her, but the words don't mean anything. It turns out that she didn't tell Winnie how Kevin had made fun of her, because she didn't want her to be hurt. She does, however, list the people she did tell, and Kevin feels sick.\n\nNext day, Kevin tells his mother what happened and she tries to provide him with some encouraging words. Then, Winnie shows up and when they're alone in his room, she yells at him, obviously having been told by someone of his comments. She storms out of the house, leaving Kevin convinced that she truly does love him, although the audience believes otherwise.\n\n«My favorite beat,» Todd Langen smiles, «is when they're facing each other, doing the whole Clint Eastwood thing, and the sagebrush blows by. That's fun. When you can do a surrealistic thing like that, it gives you a lot of latitude in a series and that's fun stuff to do.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Eighteen\n\n«Fate»\n\nOriginal Airdate 3/28/89\n\nWritten by Bob Brush\n\nDirected by Steve Miner\n\nGuest Starring: Bobby Jacoby (Eddie Pinetti), Nat Bernstein (Mr. Skenk), Raye Birk (Mr. Diperna), Krista Murphy (Carla Healy), Matt Levin (2nd Henchman), Justin Whalin (1st Henchman), Ryan Rushton (Kid), Erica Gayle (Girl)\n\nTwo elements are immediately introduced in «Fate»: the school bully, Eddie Pinetti, is pushing kids around, and Winnie is still furious with Kevin over the events of «Nemesis.»\n\nIn class, Kevin is asked to describe what war is, and he gives a thinly veiled analogy of the fight between he and Winnie. In the hallway, he catches sight of Pinetti in Winnie's locker. Kevin tries to stop him and is about to be punched out, when he's «saved» by the assistant principal. There's no doubt that Pinetti is going to want revenge. To make matters worse, Kevin learns that Winnie has been dating the bully for the past week.\n\nKevin tries to make amends, but Eddie punches him in the face and sends him sprawling to the ground. The bullying continues over the next few days, which Kevin accepts until he sees Pinetti and his friends teasing Winnie in a very nasty way. He comes up to Eddie and delivers a slow motion punch that .... misses its target, striking Eddie's shoulder. As a result, Kevin is knocked down to the ground yet again and pummeled. When Eddie departs, Winnie comes over to see if he's okay, and at that moment it seems that she has finally forgiven him.\n\n«What's really great about the show,» relates Steve Miner, «is that those moments that are TV moments, we tend not to do. In bullshit TV, Kevin would deck the guy and get the girl. I think what The Wonder Years did so well was play those moments the way they'd really happen to you, and make them touching and funny.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Nineteen\n\n«Birthday Boy»\n\nOriginal Airdate 4/11/89\n\nWritten by David M. Stern\n\nDirected by Steve Miner\n\nGuest Starring: Philip Sterling (Grandpa Pfeiffer), John C. Moskoff (Mr. Pfeiffer), Stephanie Satie (Ida Pfeiffer), Torrey Ann Cook (Debbie Pfeiffer), Gregory «Mars» Martin (Steve), Roger Nolan (Car Salesman), Zachary Benjamin (Young Kevin), Benjamin Diskin (Young Paul)\n\nIn «Birthday Boy» Paul's Barmitzvah is coming, and from Kevin's reaction we can see that he's a little jealous, particularly after Paul mentions that he'll be getting over a hundred presents, and probably a thousand dollars.\n\nOne night, Kevin has dinner with the Pfeiffers and during the meal Paul's grandfather tells tales of the family's background and says that he has a gift for Paul. Kevin is thinking that it may be money or the keys to a car, but it turns out to be the prayer book of his grandfather's, which has been handed down from generation to generation.\n\nNext day, Kevin tries to get a feel for his family's heritage, but Jack is more concerned about the expenses of getting a new car or fixing the old one. Norma does her best to piece together the family background for Kevin, with somewhat embarrassing results.\n\nAt school, Paul gives Kevin his invitation for the Barmitzvah, and Kevin is startled to find that it falls on his birthday. In a truly selfish (albeit normal for an adolescent) moment, Kevin states that he won't be able to come, which obviously cuts Paul deeply, particularly after he's told that Kevin won't even be there for the ceremony. Kevin walks off in anger. Later, he's helping his father fix the family car. He tells his mother he doesn't want to talk to Paul when told that Paul is on the phone, and then tries to get some sympathy from his father regarding this whole Barmitzvah thing. But, again, Jack is too wrapped up in the task at hand to really listen to him. Changing the subject, and desperate to find some sort of family tradition, Kevin asks his father how he learned to fix cars («Just something I picked up along the way,» he responds) and whether or not grandpa was good at cars, which he was. Jack then starts teaching Kevin how to do some of the repairs. Older Kevin lets us know that all he had been looking for was someone to acknowledge that he was growing up, moving towards manhood.\n\nKevin's birthday. The family gathers in the living room, where Norma serves the cake as they await Jack's arrival in the newly repaired car. Karen gives Kevin a rather depressing poem and leaves, and Kevin opens his other presents, which include a turtle neck, bathrobe, wallet and a thesaurus. Going up to his room, we can see - and older Kevin informs us - that he's very disappointed in his birthday as a whole.\n\nWe cut to Paul's Barmitzvah, where he's reciting his prayers in front of family and friends. In the middle of this, Kevin shows up and a smile crosses Paul's face. After the ceremony the two friends greet each other and join the others in celebration. The narrator lets us know that in a sense this felt like it was his Barmitzvah as well, as he gets swept up in the moment, gaining a fuller understanding of the concept of Tradition. The ending is absolutely beautiful, everyone dancing in slow motion and the moment being frozen as if in a variety of photographs.\n\n«‹Birthday Boy› changed more than any of the others as far as the structure and the elimination of scenes,» says Steve Miner. «It's funny, but that and ‹Loosiers› are my favorites. The scenes cut weren't critical, but it went through some transformations. Neal and Carol both spent a lot of time in the editing room on that one, and did a good job. I had to do that show really fast, because we had run over on the previous show, and I only had four and a half days. When you have to rush to finish a show, you do compromise more than you would normally like to do. That's a problem with doing episodic television. But a great show. When I read the script I knew it would be a great show, if I didn't screw it up. I think it turned out to be a legitimately touching episode.»\n\nAdds Todd Langen, «What was particularly interesting for me about that episode is what you didn't see as much as what you did see. Paul is having his Barmitzvah, which signals his manhood, and Kevin is looking for something like that too. What happens is that there's the scene where Jack is working on the car with Kevin and Wayne and he won't let Kevin start the engine. At the end, there was supposed to be a scene after the Barmitzvah where dad pulls up in a new car and he takes Kevin out to a little parking lot and lets him drive the car. That becomes sort of Kevin's Barmitzvah, because his father is letting him drive the new car. I thought that was really nice. For my money, this ending was more expectable than the ending I just described. We tried not to do the status quo.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty\n\n«Brightwing»\n\nOriginal Airdate 4/18/89\n\nWritten by Matthew Carlson\n\nDirected by Daniel Stern\n\nGuest Starring: Darren Powell (George), Kyra Stempel (Julie), Devon Pierce (Sandy), Jodi Rae (Young Karen), Trevor Owen (1st Guy at the Rock)\n\n«Brightwing» is a Karen episode, beginning with the Arnold daughter decked out in her hippie clothes, and Kevin wondering why the two of them live in such different worlds. The narrator lets us know that it wasn't always this way; that there was a time when brother and sister were very close and used to enjoy spending time with each other. Those days, it would seem, are gone forever.\n\nA couple of days later, Karen and her friends pick Paul and Kevin up on their way to school and ask Kevin to stop by their high school and place some notes in a certain locker for them. Then the girls drop the kids off at school and everything seems fine. That evening Kevin thinks that he and Karen have struck a chord, but is disappointed to learn that everything is exactly the same as it was.\n\nA week passes, and Kevin reluctantly agrees to do the same favor again. Only this time he reads the note he's dropping off, and finds out about a place called «The Hill.» After school, Kevin goes to this place, where he finds Karen and a group of her hippie friends playing guitar, painting, etc. Amazingly, Karen seems delighted to see him. The note placing continues, and Kevin is continually welcomed to this special place, where he basically immerses himself in Karen's lifestyle. For the first time, we're seeing some genuine affection between brother and sister.\n\nThings do seem to be getting overwhelming as he lies to his parents and Paul about his whereabouts. One night, perhaps plagued by guilt, Kevin has a nightmare in which his parents are cops who come to his house to arrest him from his hippie existence. His fears aren't put to rest, however, when Norma gets a call from Karen's guidance counselor. He starts to panic, but Karen assures him that everything will be alright. In the middle of the night, he discovers that she lied to him, as a note states she's gone to San Francisco with her friends. Hours later, however, she shows up at home again, crying to her parents. Kevin's narration explains that in 1969 people often tried to find themselves, and got lost along the way.\n\n«I never understood what was going on,» smiles a perplexed Todd Langen. «Why did Kevin have to drop these notes off in the locker? What does that have to do with anything? I did like the ending where we didn't use a lot of words, and you have that scene where Kevin is in the kitchen, with Jack and Norma standing on either side of him. As he walks out, she gives him this little bit of a smile. In that moment, everything sort of wraps up without a lot of dialogue. I like that. Bob Brush's idea was that we should set everything up earlier, so that the endings sort of play by themselves without being doused in exposition.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty One\n\n«Square Dance»\n\nOriginal Airdate 5/2/89\n\nWritten by Todd W. Langen\n\nDirected by Tom Moore\n\nGuest Starring: Robert Picardo (Coach Cutlip), Lindsay Fisher (Margaret Farquhar), Michael Tricario (Randy), Johnny Green (Mike), Ashlie Walker (Heidi), Wendy Bowers (Miss Bruntley)\n\nCoach Cutlip announces to his class that they will begin learning the art of the square dance in the episode entitled «Square Dance.» Girls enter the gym, with the coaches assigning partners. Kevin is upset at getting paired up with the most unpopular girl in school, Margaret Farquhar. As the narrator notes, «Margaret Farquhar could get on the nerves of any teacher. Even Gandhi.»\n\nLater, in the halls, a bunch of kids start giving Kevin a hard time about being paired up with Margaret. He gets home, only to have Wayne give him the same treatment. Kevin's ready to dump her as his partner, until Norma guilts him out of the decision. In gym the next day, Kevin's unhappiness is apparent on his face. He walks through the halls and Margaret stops him, asking him all sorts of bizarre questions («Do you go to the bathroom a lot?» «Do you like bats?»), and then shocks Kevin by plopping down on the seat next to him in the cafeteria, which mortifies him. He tries to get her to take off, but she just keeps on talking, ignoring his protests. The iceing on his cake is when a group of girls asks him if he and Margaret are going steady. The only way out of the situation, in his mind, is to snub Margaret, not talking to her, refusing to touch her, etc. It seems to work, until that afternoon when Margaret shows up at Kevin's house, bringing her bat named Mortimer in a box. Kevin wants to get rid of her, but Norma, being a good person by nature, asks Margaret to stay a little while, but she, too, makes a quick retreat when she learns that Margaret's brought her bat.\n\nThey spend an hour together in the Arnold house, and Kevin becomes fascinated by her quirkiness, and touched by the fact that she has spent most of her life moving from army base to army base and has never had any real ties. This is interrupted by the realization that Wayne will be home at any moment, and Kevin is abruptly rushing her out the backdoor. The only way he can truly get rid of her, though, is to agree to come over her house later that evening to see her tarantula, Isabelle. He keeps his promise and gets to the front door, paranoid that someone will see him. He slips into another fantasy, in which his friends are all there laughing at him, spotlights shine down and a helicopter flies overhead, alerting the neighborhood to the fact that he's over Margaret's house. Fantasy ended, he runs away just as Margaret answers the door.\n\nNext day, Kevin sees Margaret and, because of peer pressure, tells her that he can't talk to her anymore or be seen with her. They can be secret friends, which, he claims, is even better. As weird as she is, Margaret is not stupid. She starts to yell at him and all the kids gather around, starting to taunt both of them. Kevin doesn't defend her. She says, «I thought you were different,» and walks off in tears. The last day of square dancing, Kevin dances alone, Margaret not acknowledging his existence.\n\nOlder Kevin informs us that in seventh grade you are what other seventh graders think you are. Ironically, it's difficult to remember the names of the kids you spent so much time trying to impress, but you don't forget someone like Margaret Farquar, «professor of biology, mother of six .... friend to bats.»\n\n«This one was based much more on personal experience,» says Todd Langen. «I used to have to take square dancing in elementary school and junior high school, and I pretty much hated it. So that was one aspect of the story that I wanted to inject. The other thing was that Kevin sort of rejects this little girl, the butt of everyone's jokes because she's different. I was sort of in a similar situation in elementary school. I used to tease rather mercilessly this little girl and I guess this is sort of my way of doing penance for that. Again, it's the sort of story that everyone could recognize because it's about someone who was not afraid to be an individual and ended up being an outcast because of that. More importantly, it's about Kevin giving up on someone because of peer pressure; someone who could have been a friend and could have been an interesting sort of acquaintance for him. Even when Kevin begins to like her, he can't bring himself to like her in public. Again, because of this sort of sad, realistic ending it touched the audience more than your standard, happy sitcom ending approach. Generally, with the exception of when it was going out for humor all the way, The Wonder Years tried to round out the ending and make it touch people somehow.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty Two\n\n«Whose Woods Are These?»\n\nOriginal Airdate 5/9/89\n\nWritten by Bob Brush\n\nDirected by Peter Horton\n\nGuest Starring: Madison Mason (Foreman), Matthew Faison (City Hall Official), Raye Birk (Mr. Diperna), Angela Paton (Woman at City Hall), Charles Kahlenberg (2nd Man at City Hall), Jeremy Yablan (Young Kevin), Daniel Lee (Young Paul), Jenny Drugan (Young Winnie)\n\nIn «Whose Woods Are These?» Kevin and Winnie take a walk to their old stomping grounds, Harper's Woods, the place they shared their first kiss. They're interrupted by Paul, who informs them that Harper's Woods is going to be torn down to make way for a shopping center. The trio are horrified. After all, it was their woods, right? Kevin races home and confronts his family with the news, but they aren't concerned at all. How can this be? seems to be the look on his face.\n\nKaren suggests that they go to the Planning Board meeting Sunday night and state their case; demand to be heard; fight for what's important and take action. On Sunday, the three kids arrive and wait for an opportunity to speak. First, Kevin fantasizes that he addresses the crowd and they listen in rapt attention to his every word, giving him a standing ovation and ripping up the construction blueprints. In reality, the kids never even get a chance to speak. In school, they come up with radical approaches, Winnie suggesting they pour sand in the gas tanks of the bulldozers, Paul recommending they hijack the vehicles. Everyone starts fighting with each other.\n\nLate at night, Kevin sneaks out to the construction sight and is joined by Winnie and Paul, each of them having come on their own. With flashlights they lock on to the tree trunk and read all their initials carved there. Paul offers a few more radical ideas, but Kevin makes them face the fact that Harper's Woods will be a memory in a couple of years. Winnie tries to instigate a game of hide and seek, and Kevin reluctantly joins in on the game being played out one last time. The final image of the episode flashes forward to the time when the shopping center is complete and there, carved in the cement, are the initials of Kevin, Winnie and Paul. The final result is another terrific episode, looking at the loss of youth and our attempts even in adolescence - to hold on to it a little bit longer.\n\nTodd Langen points out, «Here was a wonderful ending, about giving up a little bit of your childhood. That last dissolve made between the woods and the initials in the cement, I thought was a very well conceived moment on Bob's part and was touching. We tried to keep the fantasies down to only one per episode, if that much.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty Three\n\n«How I'm Spending My Summer Vacation»\n\nOriginal Airdate 5/16/89\n\nWritten by Jane Anderson\n\nDirected by Michael Dinner\n\nGuest Starring: Lynn Milgrim (Mrs. Cooper), Richard H. Greene (Mr. Cooper), Raye Birk (Mr. Diperna), Ben Slack (Mr. Ermin), Ben Stein (Mr. Cantwell), Brandon Crane (Doug), Ian Fried (Nerd), Risa Littman (Girl), Danny McMurphy (Greaser), Bentley Mitchum (Brian Cooper), Robert Picardo (Coach Cutlip)\n\n«How I'm Spending My Summer Vacation» begins with the end of school, and Kevin's enthusiasm regarding the coming summer. In his mind he's developing big plans, but the forces of nature and those around him seem to be conspiring to ruin it for him. The disappointment sets in when he learns that Paul is going to be spending the summer on vacation with his family. At least, he considers, he's got Winnie, whose yearbook he fills a page of, concluding with the words, ‹l love you.› More disappointment follows when Winnie signs his book, «have a neat summer.» Kevin doesn't understand this, and is truly hurt.\n\nMeanwhile, the Coopers are planning a barbecue, which Kevin no longer wants to attend, but his parents force him to. There he finds Winnie to be extremely distant from him, and acting as a go-between for her parents. Finally she and Kevin get the opportunity to talk, and she announces that she's going away with- her mother for the summer. Again, Kevin is stunned, and he starts complaining about the way his summer is shaping up, until he realizes that Winnie's parents are separating, and she can't handle it. Finally, he tries to console her in the best way that he possibly can. Despite all this, his summer isn't half bad.\n\nDirector Michael Dinner says, «My recollection of that show is the scene at the end between Kevin and Winnie. He kind of figures out that her parents are getting divorced and she says, ‹I miss my brother.› that, to me, is the moment we were going for. Seeing these two people together at the end, I found very emotional.»\n\n«We've been talking about endings,» notes Todd Langen, «and that is absolutely one of my favorites. I guess one of the things the show does so well is the use of period music to accentuate the show and, especially, the ending. You can't go wrong with a piece like ‹Scarborough Fair.› There's just something so nice about the way it was filmed, the whole way it was put together at the end where the camera cranes up from Winnie's house at night. Kevin's got his arm around her because he can't do anything else but be there for her, and then you dissolve to the next day. The camera comes down through these beautiful trees and sunlight, past these billowing sheets on the clothesline. In one continuous movement, the camera travels underneath Kevin's hammock to his side, where he is swinging back and forth. There's that wonderful narration, ‹I guess I had a pretty good summer after all. I mowed Mr. Erman's lawn, dad and I went fishing, a man stepped on the moon.› He's got an Archie comic over his face and he's just swinging, saying, ‹I guess, all in all, it wasn't a bad summer.› Meaning that after all his complaints that Paul and Winnie wouldn't be there, he learns that he has not had it so bad. Just the way it was filmed, the music ‹Scarborough Fair,› and the narration .... everything worked so well in conjunction with that episode. I watched the ending over and over and over again. Every time I watched it, I would get goose bumps. The first time I ever met Michael Dinner was at the Emmy Awards. I congratulated him for the episode, because it was the perfect ending for the season.»\n\ngo to top\n\n24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 | 42 | 43 | 44 | 45 | 46\n\nFollowing year two of The Wonder Years, Neal Marlens and Carol Black elected to pull back from day to day involvement with the series in order to pursue other creative directions. Filling the gap in in the wake of their departure was Bob Brush, who had been involved with the series from its early days.\n\n«It's always tough when you have a change at the top, because most television, especially television these days, needs to have a central clearing house at the top,» explains Bob Brush. «Certainly I was concerned, because I didn't want the show to radically change and I didn't want it to slip. I can't praise Neal and Carol highly enough for their creative talents, but when they left, it was up to me to use mine. I never really compared myself. I'm here and now I've got to do it. That's the only way it can happen.»\n\nAlso departing the series was supervising producer Steve Miner. «It was time to move on. How many times can you stage three kids and a locker?» he asks rhetorically. «Even though the scripts were fresh and good. Plus, Carol and Neal left for their own reasons, and I mainly did the show because I wanted to work with them. We're good friends, and I enjoy spending time with them, which is why I did the show. Series television is a real grind when you try to do it well, and I suppose it's a grind even when you do it badly. It's a man-eater for energy and time. I wasn't seeing my family as much as I wanted to, so when they left, a lot of the reasons for me to stay on the show was gone as well.»\n\nThe one positive of all this is that Bob Brush managed to maintain the quality established by Marlens and Black, continuing The Wonder Years on its journey through time.\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty Four\n\n«Summer Song»\n\nOriginal Airdate 10/3/89\n\nWritten by Mark B. Perry\n\nDirected by Michael Dinner\n\nGuest Starring: Holly Sampson (Teri Winchell), Juliette Lewis (Dolores), Jodi Raye (Young Karen)\n\n«Summer Song» begins with the feeling that the Arnold family unit is having trouble again, as Karen and Wayne really don't want to go on the annual vacation to Ocean City. Kevin doesn't really care one way or the other, as a letter from Winnie, who's living in Maine with her mother, states that she'll be coming home soon, and that she's met a guy named Chip. Moments later, the family, plus Paul, sets off for the journey, with Paul getting carsick on the way. They arrive and the bickering starts. Jack quickly gets upset at the way the prices for everything has gone up.\n\nKevin's fun is kind of taken down a peg as well when Paul breaks out from eating fish, and has to stay inside for a day or two. Kevin is left wondering what had happened to the vacations the family used to take, when everyone was happy. Things do improve somewhat when he meets a slightly older girl named Teri, and the two of them hit it off. This is good news, as the rest of the family still seems to be splintering apart. Through a montage of scenes, we see Kevin and Teri having a great time, riding rides, taking photos in one of those little booths and playing games. That night, they go under the boardwalk and kiss each other. Moments later, Teri drops the bombshell that she has to leave the next day, to go back home. She promises to write him, they kiss again and she departs.\n\nBy episode's end, Kevin joins up with the rest of the family, who seem to have wrapped up the trip in a much more positive way than they spent most of it. Kevin gets home from vacation and finds that Winnie has arrived at home, and he's overjoyed to see her. He asks about Chip and is told that they broke up, as it was probably «one of those summer things.»\n\nSeveral days later, Kevin is reading a letter Teri sent him, which describes how much she misses him, how she couldn't wait to see him again and what that night meant to her. Older Kevin informs us that it's the only letter she ever wrote to him, and he keeps it in an old shoebox with the photos they took that night.\n\n«This was a spec script I wrote for the show which they bought,» says Mark Perry. «I wrote that before I'd had a break in the business. I was thrilled and elated with the way the show came out. ‹Summer Song› was a dream come true for me. To see scenes I had written with the hope the script would sell, actually being filmed and actually playing out was quite an experience.»\n\nNotes Todd Langen, «Interesting, and based on personal experience for Mark Perry. He actually met an ‹older woman› like that at a beachside resort. One of the most fascinating things to me and the thing I loved about the episode-and again, I thought the ending was beautiful where he says he keeps the photo in a shoebox and it was the only letter she'd ever sent him-was that it was bittersweet in a nice, warm sort of way. Mark Perry can actually take one of the pictures out of his pocket of he and this girl in the photo booth. I think it's so great when somebody can take something that's real and personal like that, put it up on the screen and make it work in the context of different characters.»\n\n«I do all the summer shows,» laughs Michael Dinner. «The thing about ‹Summer Song› I remember is that kiss underneath the boardwalk. To me, that was a show about that one moment. It was also a show about the family, and the dissolution of the family, and then its coming back together at the end. I think both of those things are very powerful in that show. I think we all have recollections of that kind of thing, whether it's a girl under the boardwalk or a girl you met one summer. I think that's very powerful.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty Five\n\n«Math Class»\n\nOriginal Airdate 10/10/89\n\nWritten by Tom Gammill and Max Pross\n\nDirected by Andy Tennant\n\nGuest Starring: Steven Gilborn (Mr. Collins), Robert Picardo (Coach Cutlip), Joie Magidow (Miss Martinson), Francia DiMase (Hippie Teacher), Siera Samuel (Girl), Josh Berman (Boy), Chris Fielder (Eager Beaver), Ian Wade (Kid)\n\n«Math Class» turns out to be algebra for Kevin, and an instructor named Mr. Collins who dives right into the lessons and gives every indication that this is not going to be an easy course. Kevin nonetheless seems confident. Days later, Kevin gets back a pop quiz and is stunned to see that he has received a «D» grade. He tries talking to Mr. Collins about this, not understanding how his grade could be so low. Collins points out that if he's having a problem in class, there are extra help sessions available. Appalled that someone would think he needs extra help, Kevin declines.\n\nKevin goes home and really tries hitting the books. The next pop quiz results in another «D,» while Paul is scoring «As.» Time goes on and Kevin's grades aren't improving. Paranoia starts to grip him, resulting in a dinner table fantasy in which the Twilight Zone theme plays while Norma asks him algebra questions. Next day, he nearly goes into Mr. Collins' extra help session, until he sees a group of class losers there. He bumps into Collins, who suggests that he take part as there is a major test coming up, and this would be a good opportunity for him to bring up his grade. He refuses. At home, Kevin and Paul are playing basketball, with Kevin taking great delight in beating Paul, just to prove his superiority, and putting his friend down for being so «mathletic.»\n\nThe following day, Kevin takes his test and finds that he really doesn't understand anything on the page. He hands in the paper, telling Mr. Collins he got an «F.» Finally, he admits to the teacher that he doesn't understand math. Mr. Collins responds, «Good, now maybe you're ready to start,» and he crumples up Kevin's test paper, adding that there will be another test in two weeks. Over that time period, he seeks out the help of Paul, his father and Mr. Collins, and things seem to be looking up.\n\n«Math Class» is an important episode of The Wonder Years, in that it forces Kevin to recognize his own limitations as a human being, and teaches him that it's perfectly alright to look to others for help in life; that, in a sense, you cannot always depend on yourself for everything.\n\n«I liked the episode very much,» enthuses director Andy Tennant. «It was one of the first shows that I'd seen that had dealt with Kevin actually learning something we all- whether it's math class, English or even gym-have to: where we confront, finally, an adult who demands from us something we haven't been asked to do before. What I find remarkable about the Wonder Years is the writing. The writers somehow capture their memories and put it on paper, but they always find the little tiny nuance that makes it poetic. They're the best. I hope they can keep it up, because I think that's where the magic of the show is. I've never seen such a dedication to quality. These guys work so hard, and that kind of integrity and passion for the work reflects on the air. Everyone thinks it's such a mystery why a show takes off, but I don't think it's that big a mystery.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty Six\n\n«Wayne on Wheels»\n\nOriginal Airdate 10/24/89\n\nWritten by Mark B. Perry\n\nDirected by Beth Hillshafer\n\nGuest Starring: Juliette Lewis (Dolores), Jennifer Baron (Dream Girl), Elyse Eberstein (Nerdy Girl)\n\nKevin's ultimate nightmare comes true in «Wayne on Wheels,» as Wayne finally gets his driver's license. This coupled with the fact that he has a girlfriend is enough to scare anyone, particularly Kevin as now Wayne has to drive him places, which does not please the older boy at all. He drops Kevin and Paul off at the mall, and warns them to be ready at 6:30 or «be prepared to spend the night.» At the mall, Kevin pursues a pretty girl he had seen the previous Saturday. He and Paul go into a theatre playing Romeo and Juliet and sit near the girl and her friend. After the movie, he starts to speak to her but Wayne pulls up and embarrasses the hell out of him (and you can just imagine that when they get older, Kevin is going to take a hammer to this guy's skull). When Jack finds out about Wayne's abusive behavior, all driving privileges are suspended, which don't make things any easier for Kevin.\n\nAt school, Paul tells Kevin that he spoke to the pretty girl's friend, and found out that the two of them will be at the mall that night. It's Paul's recommendation that they go to the mall, and Kevin asks his mother for a ride. Then he finds out that Wayne is allowed to drive, and has to take him to the mall. Enroute, Wayne stops the car and tells Kevin to get out, because he has a date and doesn't want to be late. Kevin refuses, a fight develops between them and Paul gets out of the car. Wayne finally agrees to take Kevin, but acts like his typical moronic self in an effort to scare him, resulting in their nearly crashing into a stalled car. By avoiding it, they crash into a corn field. The front end of the car is damaged pretty badly, and when they get home Jack is less than happy about the situation. He demands an explanation and Kevin claims there was a blowout, which probably earns him about a minute's worth of respect from Wayne. The narrator notes, «Wayne and I didn't have to be friends, but we would always be brothers.»\n\n«That turned out to be a very funny show and I was very pleased with it,» says Mark Perry. «I think Wayne is such a fascinating character, it's interesting to see how he figures into Kevin's life. Getting his driver's license is a milestone in Wayne's life, and it's interesting to see how it immediately complicates Kevin's. I thought that worked very well too. Generally, as in ‹Wayne on Wheels,› a funny episode comes around to being about brothers, so I felt like it had a little something to say about human relationships. There's a certain universal quality to the experience that Kevin has.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty Seven\n\n«Mom Wars»\n\nOriginal Airdate 10/31/89\n\nWritten by Todd W. Langen\n\nDirected by Daniel Stern\n\nGuest Starring: Sean Baca (Craig), Michael Tricario (Randy), Brandon Crane (Doug), Jim Bullock (Salesman)\n\n«Mom Wars» represents the point where Kevin feels he has to convince his mother that he's growing up and not just a little kid anymore. We cut to the afternoon, where Kevin, Paul and their friends are playing contact football, and just enjoying being boys at play. At dinner, Wayne mentions the football game, and Norma expresses her displeasure at the fact that Kevin is playing, fearful that someone might get hurt.\n\nAfter school the next day, Kevin and the guys are getting ready to play again, when Norma meets him outside school in the family station wagon, wanting to take him clothes shopping. Mortified, he goes with her but as he keeps trying on clothes, we can see that he's getting angrier. She wants to take him shopping for shoes the following afternoon, which infuriates him. To make matters worse, Norma won't let him play football with his friends that night.\n\nThe following afternoon, Kevin purposely comes home on the school bus, acting as though he was supposed to meet her at home. Then, finding no on there, he gets on his bike and rides to the park to play football. Suddenly, Norma shows up, angry that he «forgot» to meet her. She still wants to go shopping, but Kevin refuses and when she voices her disapproval over his playing football, he demands that she stop babying him. A very hurt Norma leaves. Unfortunately, Kevin does indeed get injured during the game, cutting his hand open. He walks his bike home, enters the house and starts bandaging his hand by himself, despite Norma's obvious desire to help him. She has taken him at his request, and is trying to let him grow up.\n\n«Up to this point,» details Todd Langen, «there had been a story about Kevin plus every other main character in the show, but there really hadn't been an episode yet that dealt specifically with Kevin and his mother. I remember thinking that that might be the proper approach to take. I thought, ‹This is a story about Kevin having problems with his mother when he's at the age when you want to start cutting the apron strings.› That was really the kernel of the idea. We just built it from there, the whole conflict about Kevin playing football, just for the vivaciousness of slamming into other kids. Mothers are dead set against that, and this is what causes the final conflict and the explosion by Kevin in which he tells her to basically back off. Again, I thought there was a very nice moment at the end, when he's bandaging his own hand when it's hurt, and his mother has decided not to help him because he doesn't want her to. And he says, ‹The funny thing is, it's hard to tie a bandage with just one hand ... but you learn.› That's the point of the episode. At some point, you do learn and the apron strings gradually fall away.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty Eight\n\n«On the Spot»\n\nOriginal Airdate 1/17/89\n\nWritten by Matthew Carlson\n\nDirected by Matia Karrell\n\nGuest Starring: Nicholas Hormann (Mr. Weber), Richard H. Greene (Mr. Cooper), Lynn Milgrim (Mrs. Cooper), Sean Baca (Craig Hobson), Joe Elrady (Stage Manager), Parker Jacobs (Mr. Webb), Ryan Francis (George)\n\nIn «On the Spot,» the school is doing the play Our Town, which Kevin, like the majority of the students, could care less about. Winnie wants to try out for a role, but Kevin discourages her. Paul wants to join up as well, and Kevin even decides to give it a crack when he learns that rehearsal will get him out of seventh period-gym.\n\nWhile Kevin gets the position of spotlight manager, Paul is unable to be picked for a role. Winnie reads for Emily, the lead character, and gets it. She is so excited about this, but Kevin doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm. Then Paul shows up, dejected. Kevin suggests that Paul work the spotlight with him, which Paul jumps at the opportunity to do, although he does get carried away with the whole idea.\n\nFor Winnie, things are a little difficult. During rehearsal she has problems remembering her lines, and goes to Kevin with her frustration. Kevin comments that it's only a play and since it's an excuse to get out of seventh period, she shouldn't worry about it. Winnie thinks that's the most insensitive thing she's ever heard. Later, she wants to quit, but her father is flying in from Chicago just to see her performance. Since her parents haven't seen each other in two months, it's an opportunity she doesn't want to blow.\n\nOn the night of the performance, Paul is stricken with «backstage fright,» and Kevin, who hasn't done any preparing because he's allowed Paul to do it all, has to run the spots. At first he is simply awful, but eventually he manages to coordinate the light, particularly after Winnie comes out on stage. In a sense, he feels that via the light he has become one with Winnie, and in his mind he would like to think that he helped her through the performance.\n\nOur Town is a success, Mr. and Mrs. Cooper seem to be connected (indeed, we learn that a week later Mr. Cooper moved back home), and Kevin's feelings for Winnie have never been stronger.\n\n«I thought this was a beautiful episode, and I'm surprised Matthew Carlson didn't get another Emmy nomination for it,» opines Todd Langen. «Matthew actually wrote the first draft of the script with the play being Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie, so they did Our Town. Of course, Our Town works equally as well, if not better. What's fascinating to me as a writer, and again it just shows how enormously talented a writer Matthew is, is that The Glass Menagerie draft he wrote is equally as good as the later draft, and of course they're two totally different metaphors that you have to integrate in terms of the humor and the action. I just thought ‹On the Spot› was a beautiful concept and episode, the idea of Kevin holding her up with that spotlight, and Winnie playing out a scene that reflects her own personal situation while her estranged parents are sitting in the audience and bonding together again. It's a very well constructed, emotional piece and I thought they executed it very, very well.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Twenty Nine\n\n«Odd Man Out»\n\nOriginal Airdate 11/14/89\n\nWritten by David M. Stern\n\nDirected by Peter Baldwin\n\nThe Kevin/Paul friendship hits hard times in «Odd Man Out.» The two best friends start fighting over baseball card swapping, which leads to personal insult and a supposed severing of their bond. What follows is a pretty basic plot in which the duo set about getting new best friends, and then making the other guy jealous. Ironically, Kevin's choice of best friend, Doug Porter, is driving him crazy, and he basically tells him off, resulting in guilt-filled dreams. He tries to stop by Doug's house to apologize, but is told that he can't come to the door. As he's leaving, Kevin hears laughter from Doug's room and glances in a window, only to see Doug having a great time with Paul's supposed new best friend. Suddenly, he feels the odd man out, recognizing that Paul is his perfect counterbalance in life. By episode's end, they're buddies again.\n\n«Odd Man Out» is probably the most linear story done in the course of the series. Very simple, it deals with one theme: boy has best friend, boy loses best friend, boy gets best friend back again.\n\nNotes Todd Langen, «The thing that struck me about it is the character of Doug Porter, a character I supposedly created in ‹Coda.› Here was a kid that I immediately recognized from my own past. The kid who is dying for love and affection, and would give you the shirt off his back and tell you how great you are, almost to a sickening degree. Everybody knows that kind of kid, but until I read it in David Stem's episode, I hadn't remembered. I would never have thought of it myself, but there it was on the page and it very much impressed me.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirty\n\n«The Family Car»\n\nOriginal Airdate 11/21/89\n\nWritten by Debra Frank and Jack Weinstein\n\nDirected by Michael Dinner\n\nGuest Starring: Patrick Cronin (Marvin Lutz), Sean Baca (Craig Hobson), Biff Yeager (Man), Jodi Rae (Young Karen)\n\nAs «The Family Car» begins, Jack is once again working on the station wagon, doing his damnedest to keep the vehicle running. The neighbor across the street has just gotten a new car, and Wayne suggests they get one as well. Jack refuses, despite the fact that it continually breaks down and sounds like a tank. That night, Norma brings up the subject again, and Jack reluctantly agrees to look for a new car.\n\nThe Arnolds go to a dealership. Jack wants to get another station wagon, but the family is taken by the image of a red '69 Mustang. The salesman points out that with his family is growing up and Jack probably doesn't need a station wagon as much as he thinks he does. Jack leaves in a huff, though, because he doesn't like the amount of money the salesman offers him for the station wagon. The next night, Norma suggests that perhaps the offer was not as bad as Jack. thinks it was, and he finally agrees. The entire family pitches in to clean the station wagon up before its sale; to make it look as good as it possibly can. Unfortunately, everyone who expresses interest in the car leaves laughing once they hear the price that Jack wants for it. Karen accuses him of being cheap and Jack tries to leave, but the car won't let him get out of the driveway. Norma meets him in the driveway, praises him for all he's done to keep the car going but points out that now it's time to move on. Both of them realize that what Jack is really afraid of is letting go of the past, but he recognizes that it's something he has to do.\n\nThe episode ends with Jack pulling up in a new Ford Fairlane, and the family gathers as the old station wagon is towed away.\n\n«I just remember the image of the car going down the street,» reflects Michael Dinner, «and the feeling that they were moving on to something new, but that was a piece of them going away. I think it was another family show, about the family in a state of flux. To a certain extent, that theme runs through a number of our shows. Even the treehouse show I did, which you could say was about male bonding, also dealt with a father and son really talking for the first time.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirty One\n\n«The Pimple»\n\nOriginal Airdate 11/28/89\n\nWritten by David M. Stern and Todd W. Langen\n\nDirected by Matia Karrell\n\nGuest Starring: Heather Green (Gina Pruitt), Ben Stein (Mr. Cantwell), Tony Nittoll (Tony Barbella), Patricia Nickell (Claire Pruitt)\n\n«The Pimple» raises its ugly head at the most inopportune time for Kevin. Now going through puberty, the young Mr. Arnold is having enough problems to deal with, which he compares to a clip from I Was a Teenage Werewolf. One morning, Norma receives a letter stating that old family friends -who they haven't seen for several years- are going to be in town. Kevin is particularly excited, because the daughter of that family has aged beautifully and she is someone that he had played «Ben Casey» with.\n\nKevin's world collapses around him when he finds his first pimple, and it's a real beauty. He tries to convince himself that it's not that noticeable, but Norma makes a comment, as does Karen and Wayne, who takes the greatest pleasure. At the bus stop, Paul makes several observations about it, including the fact that the timing couldn't be worse because Gina, is coming to town that weekend. Things don't improve once he gets to school, when Mr. Cantwell, the science teacher, shows a film about volcanos, which Kevin compares to an erupting pimple.\n\nWhen he gets home, Kevin is horrified to learn that Gina will be arriving in two days rather than a week. That night, he tries every method he can think of to get rid of the pimple, but nothing works. He stares at his reflection and remembers the transformation clip from I Was a Teenaged Werewolf. Out of desperation he goes to Wayne, who says that he should pop it, but then goes on to discuss the potential gruesome consequences. After that, Kevin is led into the bathroom where Wayne shows him his various skin care products, but then charges him a buck for its use. Humorously, when the drawer is opened, we hear the sound of a Geiger counter doing its thing.\n\nWhile applying the cream, Kevin fantasizes that he and Gina are running toward each other in slow motion, and miss. Next morning, the pimple is bigger than ever and he goes to school with a bandaid covering it. He tells Winnie that he's wearing the bandaid because he got into a fight with a school bully, who gets really annoyed when he hears this story. Going home, Kevin hopes more than anything that this night will pass quickly without his coming out of his room, but Gina and her family arrive. Norma comes to get him and demands that he come out of his room. He comes face to face with Gina and is delighted to find that she has a large pimple on her forehead. The couple get along great, and Kevin realizes that in life there are going to be little .... bumps .... along the way.\n\n«This is one of the things you hear about, a one sentence idea, and this one came from Bob Brush,» explains Todd Langen. «We were sitting around the table one day and Bob said, ‹Guys, we've been doing all these deep episodes. We need to break it up a little bit where something silly and recognizable happens. This is it. Kevin gets a pimple.› That's all we had. From that basis, we built an episode. It turns out we were starting to get pressed for time at that point in the season, so Dave Stem and I teamed up to write that episode. It was a simple story. It's just the familiar and recognizable tale of getting the first pimple at the most inopportune time you can imagine, when a pretty girl is coming to visit. That's all the episode was. No deep message. I did like the moment when Kevin opens up the drawer in the bathroom where Wayne keeps all his Clearasil, and you hear the sound of a Geiger counter going. Just silly stuff like that. We also used the classroom situation, where they're talking about a volcano ready to explode, as a metaphor for what's going on. We do that a lot on the show.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirty Two\n\n«Math Class Squared»\n\nOriginal Airdate 12/12/89\n\nWritten by Matthew Carlson\n\nDirected by Daniel Stern\n\nGuest Starring: Steven Gilborn (Mr. Collins), Robert Picardo (Coach Cutlip), Chris Demetral (McCormick), Joshua Smith (Bob), Eric Ratican (Ken), April Dawn McCaffrey (The Girl)\n\n«Math Class Squared» is essentially a sequel to the earlier episode «Math Class.» Older Kevin discusses the concept of heroes and we see photos of astronauts, John Kennedy, comic book super heroes and then his algebra book. As we dissolve to Mr. Collins' classroom, we learn that Kevin has really gotten to like the teacher, who's as hard as ever but someone that inspires Kevin to do his best.\n\nWhile studying with Paul, Kevin overhears a group of kids who have gotten their hands on a teacher's edition of the algebra textbook which has all the answers. Their plan is to cheat on Collins' tests, as the man takes his exams straight from the textbook. Later, during gym class, one of the kids asks Kevin if he wants in but Kevin refuses, pointing out that they'll never get away with it, and proceeding that way will mean death at Collins' hands.\n\nDuring the next test, the trio of cheaters use their crip sheets and Kevin thinks Collins is aware of this, but he fails to catch them. Kevin's frustration grows even more intense when the cheaters are affecting the grade curve, thus lowering his «C» average down to a «D.» After this happens a second time, he goes to Collins and expresses his feelings about the curve, but Collins doesn't seem to understand what he's getting out.\n\n«Thank you for your feedback,» says Collins. «I would suggest that you not concern yourself with the rest of the class. Every problem contains its own solution, Mr. Arnold.»\n\nKevin is stunned, realizing that this wasn't a hero. Mr. Collins was apparently human after all. Disillusioned, he walks out of the classroom and tells McCormick, one of the cheaters, that he wants to have the answers to the next exam. That test, Kevin gets a «B,» but he feels lousy about it. Then he gets an «A,» and Collins make things worse by saying he would like to put him in the honor's math class, an offer Kevin sees no choice but to accept. Needless to say, he is totally confused. During class, Collins asks Kevin a specific algebra question and he imagines that everyone is speaking to him in numbers, and then we have Paul imitating Rod Serling who is introducing an episode of The Twilight Zone.\n\nKevin races into the bathroom to splash water on his face, where the three cheaters come in and we learn they got an «F» on the unit test, which counts for 50% of their grade, because Collins did not take it out of the book. When he gets home, Kevin realizes that if he had just stayed put, his «C» would have become a «B» thanks to the curve.\n\nNext day, Kevin goes to see Collins, who asks, «Had enough? Every problem contains its own solution, Mr. Arnold.» Kevin moves back to his old class and starts pulling in his old grades again. Why Collins chose to pick him and provide this incredible break, he doesn't know. But one-thing Kevin is aware of is the simple fact that Collins is indeed a hero; a mentor among teachers.\n\n«That script went through a tremendous amount of angst and agony in the formulation stages,» reflects Todd Langen, «because everybody was so wary and so concerned about Kevin cheating. Would that soil the character permanently? They went through every single device they could think of that he had to cheat, he had no choice. I disagreed with that approach a little bit, in that I thought we could have been a little more realistic and gotten away with it, because our character is realistic and people would have accepted and loved him anyway. He's a great person and that's what people do. That's television, I guess.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirty Three\n\n«Rock 'n' Roll»\n\nOriginal Airdate 1/2/90\n\nWritten by Bob Stevens\n\nDirected by Michael Dinner\n\nGuest Starring: Sean Baca (Craig Hobson), Joshua Miller (Larry Beeman), Ben Slack (Mr. Ermin), Casey Ellison (Mark Bernstein), Dana Young (Neal Rhodes), Stefanie Scott (Amy Ermin)\n\n«Rock 'n' Roll» is the long awaited Beatles episode of The Wonder Years. The show begins with footage of the moptops on the Ed Sullivan Show, and has older Kevin detail some of the ways that rock 'n' roll had an impact on the people of the sixties.\n\nWhen some of his friends start a rock and roll band, Kevin decides to take a crack at it. To this end, perhaps dreaming of Beatle-like stardom, he gets his hands on an electric guitar and decides to practice at home. Unfortunately he strums one chord and all the power is knocked out of the house. Still, he is not discouraged. No, this does not come until he and the other members start practicing and he realizes just how truly bad they are. Kevin elects to quit, even after hearing that the band has got a gig at a local party. However, when Kevin learns that the Beatles are about to break up, he realizes that he's got to go through with it-for the sake of rock 'n' roll!\n\nThis moment of fame never takes place, however, when police officers break up the party before they are able to play anything.\n\n«That was kind of like going home for me,» admits Michael Dinner. «I started a long time ago as a musician. There were two things I wanted to be when I grew up. One was Keith Richards and the other was to make movies and be John Ford or somebody like that. I actually worked as a musician and was a studio musician on a couple of albums during the early to mid-seventies, so I guess it was fate I ended up doing that show. I guess it was that image of his buying the guitar, coming home and plugging it in on an ear shattering volume that comes to mind, He hits that one powerful chord and all the lights go out in the house. I think I lived through that myself. My parents were very tolerant when I was growing up. They'd lock me in a room and let me crank up the volume to the point where they couldn't stand it anymore. I think it was a part of me that I hadn't dealt with in a long time.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirty Four\n\n«Don't You Know Anything About Women?»\n\nOriginal Airdate 1/16/90\n\nWritten by Tammy Ader\n\nDirected by Jeff Brown Guest Starring: Maia Brewton (Linda Sloan), Kelly Packard (Susan Fisher), Christa Murphy (Carla Healy), Ben Stein (Mr. Cantwell), Andy Howard (Steve Padway), Sean Wohland (Donald Wallach)\n\nIn «Don't You Know Anything About Women?» Kevin wants to ask the like of his life, Susan Fisher, to the school dance, but he realizes he hasn't got a chance. Instead, he asks his buddy, Linda Sloan, to go as friends.\n\nOn the night of the dance, Kevin stops by Linda's house to pick her up and discovers that in a dress, with her hair down, she really is a cute girl. He's impressed. At the dance itself, Linda ends up dancing with a guy named Steve (which is okay, since she and Kevin are, after all, just friends). Suddenly, Susan Fisher comes over and asks for a dance. Afterwards they have some punch and discover that they have absolutely nothing to speak about. Susan excuses herself for a minute and Linda comes over, thinking that one of the cups of punch he's holding is for her but he bluntly lets her know that one of them is Susan's, although he doesn't mean to hurt her feelings. Then Kevin sees Susan dancing with her supposed exboyfriend and at that moment, Kevin realizes just how alone he is at the moment. There is a beautiful closing shot of he and Winnie just missing each other on the dance floor.\n\nTodd Langen points out, «Here's a case where, again, the music can make the ending. They used ‹Unchained Melody,› the music that's in Ghost, to great effect, because the whole last scene is at this dance. Kevin has just lost this girl, Linda, who liked him, but he wasn't in love with her. He's sort of wandering around the dance floor, and in the last minute or so you use ‹Unchained Melody,› pumping it up, pumping it up, slowly increasing it until it reaches its climax, and it has this tremendous swelling effect that you feel. And yet-here's the point-the words the narrator was speaking, in my mind, in some respects are totally false. The narrator's saying things like, ‹All our young lives we look for someone to love and someone to love us back,› and I'm thinking to myself, ‹But that's not true. When I was 13-years-old, I wasn't looking for someone to love me for the rest of my life. I was trying to figure out what second base was.› It's interesting, because that totally gets swamped by everything else that's happening at the end: the music, the imagery, Winnie walking in ... all of it gives a tremendous emotional impact, yet what's being spoken, in some respects, is incorrect.»\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirty Five\n\n«The Powers That Be»\n\nOriginal Airdate 1/23/90\n\nWritten by David M. Stern\n\nDirected by Daniel Stern\n\nGuest Starring: David Huddleston (Grandpa Arnold), Gary Grossman (Mr. Corey), Jodi Raye (Young Karen)\n\nGrandpa Arnold arrives in «The Powers That Be,» and tensions become immediately apparent. Jack starts avoiding him, occupying himself with household chores, while grandpa greets the rest of the family. He gives Kevin a puppy, which Jack says they can't keep. Kevin promises that he'll take care of the dog, but Jack won't hear anything of it, until grandpa claims that he can't bring the dog back for a week, so therefore they're stuck with it for that amount of time.\n\nAs the episode proceeds, we see a constant stream of arguments between grandpa and Jack over some of the most mundane things imaginable. While this is going on, we're witnessing Kevin's dealing with the responsibility of the dog, which is not always a fun one. As the fights continue, however, Kevin gives the dog back to his grandfather, believing that that is the catalyst of the arguing.\n\nThe next morning, grandpa leaves before Kevin awakens. When he steps outside, Jack is walking the puppy and explains that he and grandpa had a long talk that morning. He thinks it's a good idea that Kevin keep the dog. Although Jack doesn't come out and say it, this is a symbolic way of mending the fences between he and his father; of righting disagreements of the past.\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirty Six\n\n«She, My Friend and I»\n\nOriginal Airdate 2/6/90\n\nWritten by Kerry Ehrin\n\nDirected by Peter Baldwin\n\nGuest Starring: Robert Picardo (Coach Cutlip), Juliette Lewis (Dolores), Krista Murphy (Carla Healy)\n\nThe title «She, My Friend and l» refers to Winnie, Paul and Kevin. As the episode opens, Carla breaks up with Paul because she doesn't have enough time to spend with her friends. He's totally depressed, and Kevin tries to come to the rescue. He and Paul start to go over potential girls he could ask out, but Paul finds something to criticize in each one of them. The only one he would like to ask, but doesn't have the guts to, is Winnie. Convincing himself that he no longer has feelings for her, Kevin decides to come to the rescue and asks Winnie to ask Paul out. Reluctantly she does so, and in fact things go so well on this «date» that the two of them are going out again the coming weekend. This raises Kevin's jealousy, despite himself. Maybe his feelings aren't as deeply buried as he thinks they are.\n\nIn school a few days later, Paul is still walking on cloud nine, particularly when he catches up to Winnie in the halls. Kevin views this and is joined by Carla, who's angry at him for having arranged this in the first place. At home, Kevin's jealousy gets worse. Watching an episode of Mr. Ed, he imagines that Ed is talking about the situation between him, Winnie and Paul. From there we cut to gym where Coach Cutlip is teaching wrestling. Kevin and Paul are pitted against each other, and it turns into an actual fist fight which has to be broken apart.\n\nThat night, Kevin is riding his bike in the neighborhood when he catches sight of Winnie and Paul sitting outside her house. Moments later she goes inside, and Paul walks off. Kevin rides up to him and apologizes, expressing his concern that he and Winnie be very happy. Paul tells Kevin that she dumped him, because she likes somebody else. Paul bids him goodnight, and Kevin is suddenly filled with optimism that Winnie is very deeply in love with him. Paul won't tell him for sure, because he promised Winnie he wouldn't. Moments pass and he goes to Winnie's door, the two of them smiling brightly at each other. Kevin loudly announces, «Paul told me, Winnie. You're crazy about me!» And with that, she slams the door in his face.\n\nNothing like true love.\n\ngo to top\n\nEpisode Thirty Seven\n\n«St. Valentine's Massacre»\n\nOriginal Airdate 2/13/90\n\nWritten by Mark B. Perry\n\nDirected by Matia Karrell\n\nGuest Starring: Wendel Meldrum (Mrs. Heimer), Crystal McKellar (Becky Slater), Sean Baca (Craig Hobson), Ben Savage (Curtis Hartsell), Krista Murphy (Carla Healy), Elyse Eberstein (Melissa Bemil), Jean Palmerton (Mrs. Dougherty), Tony Nittoli (Tony Barbella)\n\nThe «St. Valentine's Day Massacre» begins with Winnie calling Kevin rude, insensitive and smug (among other things), and Kevin desperately wanting to talk to her. He comes up with the idea of giving Winnie a valentine and has a seventh grader place it in .... the wrong locker! Kevin waits until the owner of that locker shows up, but is horrified to find that that person is Becky Slater.\n\nAt lunchtime, Becky sits down next to Kevin in the cafeteria, stating that she forgives Kevin for the pain he caused her and then kisses him. The rumor mill starts immediately, and Kevin takes off trying to head it off before it reaches the table that Winnie is sitting at. Unfortunately, the same freshman who put the valentine in the wrong locker gets in his way and trips him to the ground. Winnie stands over Kevin and announces, «I hope you and Becky Slater will be very happy.»\n\nNow finding himself trapped with Becky Slater, and afraid of telling her to take a hike for fear of getting punched out like in the past, Kevin tries to get advice from Miss White, but that does no good. In the library he tries to talk to Winnie, but Becky shows up. Facing up to facts, he tells Becky the truth, and she says she can take it gracefully. Becky gives the valentine back to Kevin and he tries handing it to Winnie, stating, again, that they could work out their problems because he knows she likes him. Winnie announces that she only told Paul that so as to not hurt his feelings too badly. Kevin is crushed as he walks out of school. Suddenly, in a great parody of The Wizard of Oz, Becky Slater tears down the street on her bike, intent on running Kevin over. That same freshman suddenly appears in her way, she swerves and e"
