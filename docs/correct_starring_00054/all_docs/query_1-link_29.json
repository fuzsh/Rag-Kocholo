        "text": "Olivia D'Abo (born January 22, 1967 although she claims to have been born in 1971 according to her own personal website in London, England) is a former child actress (aged 13?-17), and sometime singer, whose career has continued into her adulthood. She has had numerous supporting roles, especially in science fiction, fantasy, and horror TV programs and movies, such as Star Trek: The Next Generation (1992), The Twilight Zone (2002), and Conan the Destroyer (1984).\n\nAs a teenager, d'Abo had the misfortune in 1984 of being given a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for \"Worst New Star\" for her work in both Conan the Destroyer and in Bolero, in which she did a controversial nude scene at the age of sixteen, or at age thirteen, if she correctly lists her own birth year.\n\nD'Abo is married to music producer and songwriter Patrick Leonard. She is a second cousin of actress Maryam d'Abo, also noted for her science fiction and horror film work, and is the daughter of the model Maggie London and Mike d'Abo of the Manfred Mann band. She has an older brother, Benjamin d'Abo, and a son Oliver William Leonard, born in 1996.\n\nShe appeared in the Broadway show \"The Odd Couple\" in 2005 with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane."
