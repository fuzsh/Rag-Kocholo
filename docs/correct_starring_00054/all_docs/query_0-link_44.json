        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nIn past years we've broken the International Feature Oscar category down into lots of different articles but we should probably calm down. So herewith the lists we usually provide in several articles in a more condensed all-in-one format! 93 films are competing for the nomination in this category. Given the field, consider this a year for fresh voices. Only eight countries (Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Iran, Italy, Mongolia, North Macedonia, Russia) chose directors who have previously helmed Oscar-nominated or finalist films. Since we've already covered the previously Oscar-honored directors, let's look at the others.\n\nWe'll divvy it up into three categories: debuts, female directors, and the rest of the field.\n\nTHE DEBUT DIRECTORS LIST\n\nAmjad Abu Alala (You Will Die at 20 for Sudan)\n\nSudan's first-ever Oscar submission comes from a first-time director. He previously worked as a producer.\n\nShahad Ameen (Scales for Saudi Arabia)\n\nThough IMDb lists Scales as her second feature, they have zero info about the first so we'll trust Variety who calls this a debut feature. It's a film that draws on Arabic folklore to tell the story of a rebellious young woman and a tradition of sacrificing female children to monstrous mermaids lurking in the sea.\n\nAlaa Eddine Aljem (The Unknown Saint for Morocco)\n\nHe's 32 years old and previously wrote, directed and edited one documentary short and produced two documentary features. The Unknown Saint is his directorial feature debut.\n\nGregor Bozic (Stories from the Chestnut Moon for Slovenia)\n\nThe 36 year-old previously directed two shorts. For his directorial feature debut he also serves as screenwriter and editor.\n\nMamadou Dia (Nafi's Father from Senegal)\n\nHe's previously made a few shorts and shot movies for other directors but this is a debut feature. He got his MFA at Tisch here in NYC a few years back. This film received the Best First Feature prize at Locarno.\n\nDzintars Dreibergs (Blizzard of Souls/The Rifleman for Latvia)\n\nWhile he's previously made 3 documentaries this is the narrative feature debut for the 39 year-old Latvian. This war drama was a true blockbuster at home in Latvia.\n\nEmir Ezwan (Soul/Roh for Malaysia)\n\nEzwan had worked on a couple films as a visual effects artist before calling the shots on this horror film.\n\nHugo Gimenez (Killing the Dead for Paraguay)\n\nAge unknown. He previously made one documentary prior to this narrative debut.\n\nKarolis Kaupinis (Nova Lituania or Lithuania)\n\nA debut film from a 33 year-old filmmaker. Nova Lithuania played several fests including Karlovy and won the top prize at the Athens Film Festival.\n\nJimmy Keyrouz (Broken Keys for Lebanon)\n\nA debut feature from this 32 year-old who was previously honored with three major student film awards (Academy Award, BAFTA, DGA) for his 2016 short Nocturne in Black. That same short made the finalist list for the Oscars in Live Action Short but wasn't nominated.\n\nUlrike Kofler (What We Wanted for Austria)\n\nThis 46 year-old was previously an editor on features, docs, and shorts. The marital drama What We Wanted, currently streaming on Netflix, is her writing/directing debut.\n\nDea Kulumbegashvili (Beginning for Georgia)\n\nHer two previous shorts Ukhilavi Sivrtseebi (2014) and Léthé (2016) had successful festival runs including appearances at Cannes. This 34 year-old's feature debut has been racking up festival prizes and arrives Jan 29th to stream on MUBI. [Reviewed]\n\nMaia Lekow and Chris King (The Letter for Kenya)\n\nThis documentary about a man in rural Kenya confronting allegations against his Grandma is the debut directorial effort for this married couple (ages unknown). Lekow is a native Kenyan. King is originally from Australia though he's lived in Kenya for over a decade. [Reviewed]\n\nMelina León (Song Without a Name for Peru)\n\nShe had previously made shorts but this, her feature debut, played at Cannes where it was well-received. It's currently available to rent online.\n\nFilippo Meneghetti (Two of Us for France)\n\nAge unknown. He had previously made shorts and one documentary feature but this is his narrative feature debut. It's won strong reviews, some calling it a new queer classic.
