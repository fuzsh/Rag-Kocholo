SXSW Online will bring attendees a multifaceted event that speaks to so many areas of creativity in one five-day experience that everyone can access on their laptops, phones, and TVs. While we won’t have the wonderful in-person SXSW that we know and love, we can gather together to be inspired by the work.”\n\nThe Narrative Feature Competition includes: Here Before directed by Stacey Gregg; I’m Fine (Thanks For Asking) directed by Kelley Kali, Angelique Molina; Islands directed by Martin Edralin; Our Father directed by Bradley Grant Smith; Potato Dreams of America directed by Wes Hurley; The End Of Us directed by Henry Loevner, Steven Kanter; The Fallout directed by Megan Park; and Women is Losers directed by Lissette Feliciano.\n\nThe Documentary Feature Competition includes: Introducing, Selma Blair directed by Rachel Fleit; Kid Candidate directed by Jasmine Stodel; Lily Topples The World directed by Jeremy Workman; Not Going Quietly directed by Nicholas Bruckman; The Oxy Kingpins directed by Brendan FitzGerald; The Return: Life After ISIS directed by Alba Sotorra Clua; Subjects of Desire directed by Jennifer Holness; and United States vs. Reality Winner directed by Sonia Kennebeck.\n\nHEADLINERS\n\nThis year’s Headliners: Opening and Closing Night Films and a Centerpiece Film with associated Special Events on our Live Channel.\n\nDemi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil\n\nDirector: Michael D.
