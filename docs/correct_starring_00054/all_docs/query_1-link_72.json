The links are https://www.janetruthheller.com/review-of-the-downton-abbey-movie/ and https://www.janetruthheller.com/a-review-of-sanditon-by-jane-austen-as-revised-by-andrew-davies-on-pbss-masterpiece/\n\nHere is the first paragraph of my review of the Downton Abbey movie.\n\nBoth the Downton Abbey movie and the television series have the same strengths and weaknesses. The acting is superb and the costumes are wonderful; however, the dialogue sounds flat and the plots are melodramatic and sometimes illogical. Audience members who have not watched the television series will be overwhelmed by the number of characters in the film.\n\nHere is a summary of my discussion of Sanditon.\n\nIn various interviews broadcast after each episode, Davies brags that he can easily duplicate Austen’s dialogue, and he claims that what attracts men to women in her novels is sexual magnetism. Following his theory, Davies adds sexually explicit scenes to Sanditon, which Austen never would have sanctioned. Also, some of Davies’ dialogue seems transplanted from the twenty-first century, he does not understand Austen’s emphasis on her couples’ intellectual compatibility, and he completely misses the novelist’s disdain for mercenary marriages."
