        "text": "Some songs are just fun…and this is one of them. Yes, I like the Manfred Mann version a bunch and I also like Bob Dylan’s released version. It’s a live version with The Band at the Isle of Wight. Bob’s voice fits this song so well…he is over the top, sloppy, and loud but it works. It’s an irresistible melody and hook that Bob wrote in this song. Bob’s version is the only version I knew for a long time.\n\nBob Dylan wrote this song and I first heard it through his Greatest Hits II album, and then the Basement Tapes of him and The Band. Some time later I heard the Manfred Mann version of it. Something different though…Manfred Mann was the first to release it. This usually didn’t happen but Mike D’abo from Manfred Mann explains it: “We met in a publisher’s house as Bob Dylan was making some new material available to other artists, we heard about 10 songs and I thought ‘This Wheel’s On Fire’ would be the one to do, but Manfred liked The Mighty Quinn, which was called ‘Quinn The Eskimo’ then. It was sung in a rambling monotone but Manfred had recognized its potential. He sold me on the idea of doing this song, but I had to make up some of the words as I couldn’t make out everything he was saying. It was like learning a song phonetically in a foreign language. I have never had the first idea what the song is about except that it seems to be ‘Hey, gang, gather round, something exciting is going to happen ’cause the big man’s coming.’ As to who the big man is and why he is an Eskimo, I don’t know.”\n\nThe Basement Tapes version is much more mellow. This is probably the demo that Manfred Mann received.\n\nIt is thought that Bob Dylan came up with the song after seeing the 1959 movie The Savage Innocents. In that movie, Anthony Quinn plays an Eskimo named Inuk…that would explain Quinn and why he mentions an Eskimo in a pop song. That film also was the screen debut of Peter O’Toole.\n\nBob released the song in 1970 on his Self Portrait album… a live version recorded at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1969, with The Band backing him. His voice is great on this…it fits the song. The “heeyyyyyyyys” and the “whooooaaaas”s are perfect for it.\n\nManfred Mann released this in 1968 and it was a huge hit for them. The song peaked at #1 in the UK, #3 in Canada, #1 in New Zealand, and #10 on the Billboard 100 in 1968.\n\nA little trivia for Beatle fans…Klaus Voormann who drew the Revolver cover, was on this song, he played the flute part on the Manfred Mann version. I also believe he played bass but I can’t verify…that is what instrument he played.\n\nHaving turned down offers from bands like the Hollies and the Moody Blues, Voormann agreed to become a part of Manfred Mann. He got to know the Beatles when they arrived in Germany. When Stuart Sutcliffe quit playing bass…McCartney took over and a little while later Stuart volunteered…if he had spoken up sooner…you never know what could have happened.\n\nRon Cornelius who played on the Self Portrait album: “There’s everybody and his brother flying into Nashville to play on that thing. If you look at the credits, it’s amazing how many people were delighted to come and play on it. Out of everybody I’ve worked with, I don’t know of anyone who’s been any nicer than Bob Dylan.”\n\nThe Mighty Quinn\n\nCome all without, come all within\n\nYou’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn\n\nCome all without, come all within\n\nYou’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn\n\nEverybody’s building ships and boats\n\nSome are building monuments\n\nOthers jotting down notes\n\nEverybody’s in despair\n\nEvery girl and boy\n\nBut when Quinn the Eskimo gets here\n\nEverybody’s gonna jump for joy\n\nCome all without, come all within\n\nYou’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn\n\nI like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet\n\nBut jumping queues and making haste\n\nJust ain’t my cup of meat\n\nEveryone’s beneath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb\n\nBut when Quinn the Eskimo gets here\n\nAll the pigeons gonna run to him\n\nCome all without, come all within\n\nYou’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn\n\nCome all without, come all within\n\nYou’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn\n\nLet me do what I wanna do, I can’t decide ’em all\n\nJust tell me where to put ’em and I’ll tell you who to call\n\nNobody can get no sleep, there’s someone on everyone’s toes\n\nBut when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody’s gonna wanna doze\n\nCome all without, come all within\n\nYou’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn\n\nCome all without, come all within\n\nYou’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn"
