        "text": "supplied by Andre Palfrey-Martin Collection L-R:John Gaydon, John Baker, Andrew Petre, David Wilkinson, Mike d’Abo.\n\nHere is the 18th March 1966 extra report –\n\nAs you can see we are looking at Hastings 7 St Leonards some 50 years ago, although it only seems like it was yesterday. We at the local college – Hastings College of Further Education had planned for the college Rag would coincide with the 900th celebrations of that famous battle around 14 October. Because of the term dates, our main entertainments were scheduled for June and would be a 3 nighter on Hastings Pier, the Big event being the Friday All Nighter. To start the ball rolling we decided that something in March would be a good idea, and looking for a theme, decided against St Patricks Night and went for 18th March – “ The Ides of March “ the entertainments committee organised this, and for some unknown reason decided to book the Dolphin Ballroom on the floor below the Witch Doctor, at the last minute this was changed and we had a very successful night. The Programme was top of the bill, Pye Recording artistes and old Harrovians “ A Band of Angels” supported by two excellent local groups The Defiants and The Victors and the record spinning was left in my capable hands.[ its strange that the word Disco does still not appear anywhere] As we had 2 members of the d’Abo family amongst the college student body, the addition of Mike in A Band of Angels, would ensure that Mrs d’Abo would be along to see the boys appearing on the night, she was a real trouper and all the noise, lights and great number of young people, never flinched the whole evening – she was a Star!\n\nWe arrange for a personal visit from the boys to Alan Jensen in the Disc Jockey in the afternoon for PR exercise, record & photo signing etc – these were always popular and you could rely on a very happy smiling Alan to be buzzing around the shop, and he came along to the club that night as one of our guests. On another personal level, that turned out to be the start of another interesting time for me, as I was asked to take over the organisation of the entertainments for the Rag 3 Day event later in the year, so great things ahead. A Band of Angels were a great act and I think one of their best records, and one that in subsequent years would get a big following on the Northern Soul Circuit was” Invitation” As this was a Friday night – “Ready Steady Go” had set the scene, and on the show that week, we saw Billy Fury-“I’ll never quite get over you” : Barbara Lewis : Bob Lind “Elusive Butterfly”: Spencer Davis “Somebody Help Me”[ has to one of my all time favourite records of the year ] Irma Thomas and The Who “ Substitute “ – which was the first single that I played that night, having been given a copy earlier in the week by Alan Jensen as Reaction records were doing a heavy promotion at the time. It was an excellent way to start the night. For those of you who remember that night, I hope this addition to my weekly blog has brought back good memories, I certainly remember that weekend for all sorts of reasons. Back to normal in the next couple days when we look at the weekend of 19 March 1966 Andre Palfrey-Martin© 2016.\n\nAlan Esdaile …..Not sure if this record was a hit but was big with the Northern Soul crowd. I used to go and play the piano for Mike ‘d’Abo’s mum ‘Primrose’. A lovely lady and very much missed.\n\nAndre Martin….Very true – now being played in Japan in the Northern Clubs ! Hope Mike and the Boys are getting their Yen.\n\n04/11/2014 Marty Wilde’s Rock N Roll Party – Marty Wilde, Eden Kane and John Leyton with The Wildcats\n\n18/11/2014 Sixties Gold – Gerry & The Pacemakers, The Searchers, PJ Proby, The Fortunes, Brian Poole & Chip Hawkes.\n\n02/12/2014. 5.4.3.2.1. It’s The Manfreds – In Concert featuring Paul Jones & Mike d’Abo\n\nfor more information… http://www.eastbournetheatres.co.uk/What’s_On/index.asp?ID=all&enq=diary&v=WHAT’S%20ON\n\nMick O’Dowd… Just like taking a trip in the Tardis!\n\nDave Natress…If anyone wants to see a 101% top quality show, go see “The Manfreds”. Its a shame a few of this original Manfreds show line-up have retired from the show tour – but then, none of us are getting any younger but…..it’s a truly fabulous show. Top musicianship all round and top vocals from the true Peter Pan of Pop – Paul Jones – forget the other claimants to this title!! Paul, as some of you will surely know, is also a world class harmonica player.\n\nAlan Esdaile… Saw the show at The White Rock Pavilion a couple of years ago and it was excellent. Had Alan Price and Maggie Bell also on the bill. Paul Jones still looks like he did in the sixties and doesn’t age.\n\nRontenn…I was a teenager for most of the 1960′s. I loved the music that came out in that decade whether it was from the U.K. or the U.S.A. Glad to see that there are lots of artistes from those magical years still around & still performing. Sadly many have “left the building” including two in the last couple of days Alvin Stardust & Jack Bruce. My personal top favourite of all the solo singers still around is P.J.Proby. The Beatles intoduced him to us all back in 1964. On November 6th P.J. will be 76. He’s still an amazing performer & if you get the chance to see him perform please take it. He’s up there in the same category & class as Elvis.\n\nRontenn…Manfred Mann were an absolute top group. I see Manfred himself has a new CD out called “Lone Arranger”. When did he leave his own group & why?\n\nSteve Kinch… if you’re referring to the original Manfred Mann group, they split in the late 60s. If you mean MM’s Earth Band – They are still going strong. The Lone Arranger is a Manfred solo album with contributions by numerous artists and musicians, including Kris Kristofferson and members of the Earth Band.\n\nAlan Esdaile… I think they wanted to know why Manfred Mann split in the first place. I think it was down to musical differences and he was not happy playing pop songs but maybe wrong?\n\nSteve Kinch… Alan, that’s about right! Soon after Manfred mann (the pop group) folded Manfred formed MM’s Chapter Three, which was probably as far away from “pop” as it’s possible to get: A kind of jazz/rock outfit relying heavily on band members ability to improvise."
