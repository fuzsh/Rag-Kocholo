        "text": "The Devil’s Doorbell is an erotic anthology made up of seven stories by authors that I’ve heard of and/or read. The stories are all contemporary but they aren’t really connected, save for the explanation of “the devil’s doorbell.” Each story has some reference to the fact that “the devil’s doorbell” is another term for a woman’s clitoris.\n\nRecently, I was going through a heavy reading slump and an anthology seemed exactly what I needed. I could read a short story, take a break, and then come back to it. Anthologies don’t seem to demand a lot of attention from me and I don’t think I’ve ever read one—cover to cover—in one sitting.\n\nOverall, the anthology was pretty mixed. The book both begins and ends with the best stories in the bunch. The middle ones were average, as I felt some aspect was always missing, and only one story truly made me fume with anger.\n\nSo here’s a breakdown and mini review of each story, length varies according to squee or “flames on the side of my face” anger. Trigger warnings for abuse as a backstory and rape for a couple of these.\n\nIn the Garden by Anne Calhoun; Grade: A\n\nKelsey at an English estate for a friend’s wedding and she cannot stop staring at one of the guests. That’s because the guest in question, Julian, looks just like the last boyfriend to really shit on her heart. Throughout the festivities, Julian keeps catching Kelsey’s stares and finally calls her out on it. She plays it off as just attraction, but it comes out that she’s having conflicted feelings.\n\nShe’s attracted to him because he looks like her ex, but she’s pretty fucking pissed at her ex. So Julian offers to be a stand-in. No-strings-attached rough sex so she can stick it to her memory of her previous boyfriend.\n\nThey wind up getting it on in an abandoned church on the estate and Julian nicks a very expensive bottle of champagne from the reception, as you do. But Kelsey and Julian have amazing chemistry. It’s cheeky and light. I’m of the opinion that sex should be fun and these two characters captured that element so well.\n\nKelsey and Julian’s one-time fling is over and the wedding week ends, but there is still some excitement lingering between the two and Julian offers Kelsey a lift back to the city. It was a story that left me wanting more, but not in an unresolved way. But in a way that makes me smile because you just know these two people are going to hump like rabbits and enjoy doing it.\n\nFavorite quote:\n\nThe thing about a one-time thing is that sometimes it happens twice. Or several times. Because you liked something far more than you anticipated, and want to do it again. Not necessarily the sex that makes us look like we were in a motorbike accident, although I wouldn’t say no to that.\n\nExact Warm Unholy by Jeffe Kennedy; Grade: F\n\nIf the grade wasn’t any indication, I hated this story. I’m going to spoil it to explain why.\n\nRachel was raised as part of the Orthodox Jewish community and had an arranged marriage. Upon her wedding night, the sex was painful and unsatisfying. Her marriage was unfulfilling and her husband was frequently unfaithful.\n\nShow Spoiler\n\nShe divorced her husband and was shunned by the community. You don’t find this until the end of the story as a way of justifying the unattached way Rachel treats sex.\n\nRegularly, Rachel becomes someone else when she’s hoping to find someone to sleep with. She’ll don a wig, contacts, and create a whole different personality. She’ll become someone else. She also always goes to the same bar, because it’s frequented by business travelers, so she doesn’t have to worry about them being local or running into them again.\n\nThe fact that she has to become someone else in order to enjoy sex, to me, is a sign of trauma and some mental health issues. And there was one scene that really disturbed me. Please be warned that the description of this next scene might be triggering.\n\nIf you’re curious about the hero, he’s the bartender at the bar Rachel frequents. I didn’t really buy his attraction to Rachel, considering she was usually posing as someone else when she came in.\n\nNo favorite quote because of my raging.\n\nRed Leather by Delphine Dryden; Grade B\n\nAfter a particular shitty break up from a long-term relationship in which her partner reveals he’s been having an affair and is in love with someone else, Maggie is lusting after a pair of red leather boots. The shoes are just enough to kick her confidence into high gear and I do enjoy a good “Stella getting her groove back” story.\n\nMaggie has a crush on the “shy-but-hot mail room guy” Tim, but is mortified when Tim delivers a box at the end of the day. A box with a vibrator in it. It seems that her ex’s new girlfriend found some of her old stuff at his place and took the liberty of mailing them back to Maggie—at her place of work.\n\nTim has crushed on Maggie for a long time and the whole vibrator package (heh) just pushes him over the edge. After hours, thinking the office is empty, he tries to engage in a little “me time” in the supplies closet. And of course, he gets caught by Maggie. Cue sexytimes.\n\nThis one was cute, but I found Tim to be a little too beta for my liking. And also, control yourself, man! I did find Maggie to be adorable and I liked seeing her reclaim her confidence as a single woman.\n\nFavorite quote:\n\nI’m going to do what I want because I like myself—instead of, How can I find out what this person wants to they’ll like me.\n\nDrowning on Dry Land by Megan Hart; Grade: B-\n\nBette is a Domme who is currently in a relationship with Damian, but she’s still feeling the effects of a previous relationship. There are brief flashbacks as Bette recounts the different moments and emotions tied with kissing her former lover. It’s really heartbreaking and I can empathize with her.\n\nShe’s struggling to give Damian all of herself when she’s still hung up on her ex (I don’t think he ever gets a name). But when she receives an email from him, Damian allows her to explore the possibility that maybe she’d rather be with him again. Kind of like, if you love something, let it go, and if it comes back, then it was meant to be yours all along.\n\nI hate that phrase by the way and I would never allow someone to be with their ex to see if they still had feelings. No way, no how. In short, Bette meets him, she retains her power in the bedroom and he comments how she’s become a different woman. She shows him, through sex, that he has no power over her anymore. And then she returns home to Damian. There’s not quite an HEA here, to me, since Bette seems to be unresolved in her feelings for her current lover.\n\nI also wonder if Bette has to be in a position of control with Damian because of the skewed power dynamic she had with her former lover, but that’s never fully explored. But hot damn, if this wasn’t packed with emotions that echoed my own feelings of my last relationship.\n\nFavorite quote (SO MANY):\n\nSometimes, the thing that’s for the best is the one that feels the worst.\n\nDevil in the Dark by Christine d’Abo; Grade B+\n\nI looooooved the heroine in this one. She’s funny and all about business. Shona is developing a hook-up app where women list what sort of kinks they’re looking for and a man responds. It’s also location based (i.e. if you’re looking to hook-up at a certain bar). The man supplies a photo of himself if he’s interested, and the woman decides if she wants to pursue it any further. As someone who has used Tinder, I like that the woman is in control.\n\nShona and co-developer Chandra have a meeting coming up to secure financial backing, so they want to take the app out for a test drive at a local club. Shona sets her kink parameters and someone responds. Turns out, the guy who responds is the club’s owner, Kevin. He heard about the app and wanted to test it, considering people would probably be using it while in his establishment.\n\nThis story was definitely more sex-focused than the others and it left off with a feeling of, “That was fun. Maybe we’ll do it again. Or maybe we won’t.” Which is usually the general feeling of a good hook-up. Some of the dirty talk felt a little stilted and odd, but overall, I loved the app idea and one-and-done sex approach definitely worked well for the anthology.\n\nFavorite quote:\n\nMy cell phone was currently tucked into my cleavage, which I’m sure wasn’t very good for the screen.\n\nLondon Calling by Megan Mulry; Grade C-\n\nAfter losing her design firm in her divorce, Lana relocates to London to start over. Unfortunately, making ends meet is harder than she realizes, considering she refuses to rely on her family’s money and her design connections (which I totally did not understand as she still seemed to like design work).\n\nAs a joke, she browses the Craigslist personal ads and finds someone is looking for a live-in facesitter. The person travels and wants to have a dedicated paramour when they come home. Lana emails the person about the ad and soon, she has an arrangement in a public place at a swanky bar to meet. In fairness, she does bring a couple friends to keep watch.\n\nOf course, we all assume it’s a dude. But it turns out to be a married woman, Cybelle. She and her husband, David, have a sexual understanding. Her husband had a previous arrangement with a man, who also lives in their home, and who Lana is also welcome to sleep with if they wish. (Everyone gets to sleep with everyone, which is a pretty sweet deal, admittedly.)\n\nWhile I enjoyed the twist of the “love interest” being a woman, a lot of it felt reminiscent of Fifty Shades of Grey. Cybelle does a background check on Lana and mentions Lana’s divorce upon first meeting her, which is awkward and frankly, none of her goddamned business to bring up. There’s also mention of a contract.\n\nFurthermore, Lana also describes herself as a “unicorn” several times because she’s bisexual and wouldn’t mind be shared by a husband and wife. My eyes felt strained from all the rolling.\n\nFavorite quote:\n\nDespite the lingering disapproval of long-dead grandmothers and the probably legitimate concern of best friends back in Brooklyn, I’d started thinking seriously about answering a few really perverted Craigslist adverts.\n\n(I was living in London, so I got to say advert. Leave me alone.)\n\nWe Are All Found Things by M. O’Keefe; Grade: A\n\nM. O’Keefe continues to be amazing. This is also (I think) the only story in the anthology with a diverse heroine. Trigger warning in this story, by the way, for abuse and rape as a backstory.\n\nRennie is an artist who uses welding to make her pieces. Recently, her studio has suffered some burglaries and is looking for someone to live in the studio’s apartment at night to keep an eye on the place. Enter Luka, a soft-spoken, Viking-esque man, who also happens to be a virgin.\n\nRennie thinks he looks familiar, but can seem to place it until it hits her in the middle of the night.\n\nLuka was part of a news story. He was raised in a rural, backwoods area, by a father who was abusive to women as well as him. His father kidnapped and raped a woman, who Luka discovered and took to safety.\n\nLuka and Rennie dance around each other so carefully, as they both have secrets and painful memories tied to their fathers. Rennie’s was shot during a convenience store robbery; she was with him when it happened. This one was easily my favorite out of the bunch—the slow burn, Rennie’s conflict of how to help Luka, Luka’s mistrust of people and his social anxiety. He was like a scared animal, wanting to be loved but unsure of how to bridge that gap.\n\nIt had a lot going on in terms of characterization, but it was handled so delicately that it didn’t feel overdramatic or like ten pounds of plot in a five pound bag. Seriously, I think the anthology is worth this story alone.\n\nPlus, there’s a dog that ruins a perfectly sexy moment.\n\nFavorite quote:\n\nI walked away. Because I wanted to fuck him and I wanted to take care of him and I wanted to hear his secrets. And I kind of wanted to tell him mine. My pain was attracted to his pain. And maybe some part of me wanted to heal him with my magic vagina or the power of a blow job or some shit.\n\nLike most anthologies, this one had stories that ranked all across the grading spectrum, but I’m glad it both started and ended on a high note. I also think your enjoyment of the stories will depend on your reading tastes. For example, I’m very picky about the types of Beta heroes, so Tim in “Red Leather” didn’t quite do it for me, but I loved Luka in “We Are All Found Things.” If you pick (or have already picked) this one up, let me know which were your favorites!"
