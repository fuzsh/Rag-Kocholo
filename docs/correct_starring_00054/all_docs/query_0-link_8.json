        "text": "The TRUTH about the BEATLES’ girls! HOW DID PATTIE “NAB” GEORGE? Pattie Boyd was tailor-made to be a Beatle girl, but she needed some very special qualities to attract George Harrison. Here’s what Pattie is really like - and why she is the girl for George! LATE LAST SUMMER a stunning young couple walked into the L’Escale restaurant, seated themselves and ordered iced drinks - and the whole room turned to stare at them! L’Escale is the most in, popular cafe in sunny St. Tropez. St. Tropez is the most in, popular - and expensive - French Riviera resort, frequented by royalty, jilti jillionaires and the jet set. The stunning couple were Mr. George Harrison and Miss Pattie Boyd (they may even be Mr. and Mrs. by now!) of London, England. Two years ago it is highly unlikely that anyone would have turned to stare at George and Pattie. In fact, it is highly unlikely that these two children of England’s “provinces” would be allowed (or could afford) to go into L’Escale. But time has changed all that - and Fate has once again proved that anybody in the world can make it to the top if they have talent and luck enough! Pattie Boyd was tailor-made for the role of a “Beatle girl.” She is very much up on everything, is slim and has lovely long blonde hair. She is five feet five inches tall and measures 34-23-35. She has sparkling blue-green eyes. But being tailor-made for a Beatle is not enough. There must be other qualities and other reasons (than the obvious) to attract and hold a particular and unusual individual like George Harrison. What are these qualities? And how does Pattie use them to keep her romance with “the most difficult Beatle” going along smoothly and continuously? It all began when Pattie heard via her modeling agency, that Richard Lester, director of A Hard Day's Night, was looking for young girls to do “walk-ons” in that famous Beatle movie. Pattie, contrary to what has been printed before, was curious about the Beatles. She was one of the top model girls at her agency, so when she expressed a desire to get a part in the film, an extra effort was made on her behalf. The extra effort wasn’t needed, however, for Dick Lester spotted Pattie for just the hip schoolgirl type he was looking for - and she was in. Tina Williams, who was in the film, recalls, “Pattie was very nice to work with. George was different than the other Beatles - quieter. He didn’t lark about and joke as much as Paul, John and Ringo did. I noticed that he used to like to sit in a quiet corner and have long conversations. I think this is what attracted Pattie to him - and she was much the same, as George was attracted to her. I still see them about in clubs together and they still seem to enjoy a dark corner and conversing.” George, of course, was also attracted by Pattie’s beauty. Pattie never lets herself go. She always wears - sparingly - the right make-up. She washes her hair every day. She keeps her nails and teeth and body spotless. Pattie has a great sense of clothes style and often sets a trend. She is a perfect “mod.” As Pattie and George grew more fond of each other, he discovered that she shared all his interests, including watching movies (in a private screening room) and cars. She loves beautiful sports cars and knows enough about them to share a conversation concerning their merits, etc. About the only interest Pattie and George don’t share is her enthusiasm for dancing. George would just as soon sit them all out. But he enjoys watching Pattie cut a rug now and again. George loves elegant, well-prepared dishes. He and Pattie often dine at expensive, exclusive retaurants in London, and - when they first started doing this - George was very impressed by the fact that Pattie knew which dish was what and how to order them. Dining out was something that Pattie had got onto as a popular model, and she had forced herself to learn to “read menus.” So her learning paid off! Cooking in has been the easiest thing for Pattie to learn. When she shared a flat with a girl friend many months ago, she practiced and practiced until she could turn out a good - though simple - steak dinner for George. He not only profusely complimented her on the results, but he felt proud that she had made such an effort on his behalf. When Pattie goes out for an evening with George, he is always proud of the way she looks and the way she conducts herself. She is very lady-like, yet still warm and friendly. She was not always a good conversationalist, but she made up her mind to master that, too - and started reading a lot between modeling bookings. It must have worked for, as was mentioned before, Pattie and George never seem at a loss for conversation when they are together. Pattie knows that George does not like to have attention called to himself (or her), so she sometimes wears a short black wig if she thinks they are going to a place where they might be recognized. Pattie never discusses George with anyone - another of the qualities he deeply appreciates. On top of all the enchantments of Pattie Boyd, there is one crowning glory that outshines rest and that has made her dearer and dearer to George as time has gone by. It is aptly described by a close friend of Pattie’s: “Pattie is a thoroughly nice person - and nice is a big word. That is why everyone adores her.” At a recent interview in England, George complimented Pattie in a simple but beautiful way when he said, “Of course, I’ll get married one day. I don’t want to end up like Elvis. Who to? Well, that’s obvious, isn’t it? You don’t go around with a girl for months and months unless you feel serious about her.”"
