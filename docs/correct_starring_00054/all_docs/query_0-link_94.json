        "text": "By Marc S. Sanders\n\nIt’s time for the man in the red cape and blue tights to fall in love with Lois Lane, but wouldn’t you know it? Three Krytonian criminals possessing the same powers as our hero have arrived on Earth with a means to dominate the planet and exact revenge on the son of their jailer. Superman II picks up where Richard Donner’s original 1978 smash left off. It remains a fantastically fun and breathless sequel.\n\nRichard Lester (A Hard Day’s Night) gets the directing credit on this film following one of Hollywood’s most infamous behind-the-scenes stories. While I’m a big admirer of Donner’s body of work, I think it was a blessing that Lester finished the job. I’ve seen what Donner was intending to do on a special Blu Ray cut, and it just does not work. The characters make odd choices that seem inconsistent with how they were perceived in the first film. That’s all I need to say about that comparison right now, though.\n\nIn the original theatrical release, the story expands on the relationship between Superman & Lois (Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder) as well as Clark Kent and Lois. Eventually, both relationships intersect with one another, and Lois realizes the man she’s been admiring and the one she hardly takes notice of are one and the same. The problem for Superman, known by his krypton name Kal-El, son of Jor-El, is if it is acceptable to be intimate with an earthling.\n\nMeanwhile, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has escaped prison to entice three villains from Krypton into a partnership that will allow them to take over the Earth and destroy Superman. The trio is led by General Zod (Terence Stamp) with the wicked Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and the mindless and mute Non (Jack O’Halloran). Following their attack on Houston, or as they call it the “Planet Huuston,” and the White House, it is on to Metropolis in search of Kal-El.\n\nI’ve offered up quite a bit of what Superman II provides and I am not even close to sharing all it’s adventurous features and character dynamics. This is a solid picture all the way through, and it begins with the casting.\n\nI’ll be bold by declaring that Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman is one of the best casting decisions in film history. Think about this for a moment. As good as Henry Cavill was in Zach Snyder’s films, thirty years later, and how well some of the WB iterations have been, the contrary point that most people make is that none of them are Christopher Reeve. From the smile, his handsome face, clear voice with perfect enunciation and even the signature hair curl over the forehead, no one has looked as good as a superhero come to life better than Mr. Reeve. When he’s flying, even with outdated visual effect backgrounds, you are still convinced that Christopher Reeve knows exactly how to fly.\n\nFollowing the director shake up on this picture, it is said Gene Hackman refused to shoot some scenes or do follow up edits. You can tell when there is a double in place for him and you can hear the different vocal sound bites from Lex Luthor. Nevertheless, what survived from Hackman’s participation is silly and twisted like you would expect from a modern-day, dastardly villain or as he declares himself to be “the greatest criminal mind of our age.” Some of these lines look hokey on paper, but Hackman invests his showmanship once again in the character. I love it. On all of those top ten lists, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor is the one that everyone is regrettably forgetting about.\n\nMargot Kidder is just as committed. Lois Lane is best when she is the go-getter and Kidder is thoroughly convincing at not just being seen in the stunts and action but actually performing through Lois’ fears, sense of daring, and adoration for the love of her life. Near the beginning of the film, there’s a great close up of Kidder looking up into the heights of the Eiffel Tower as Superman flies a hydrogen bomb out of danger. No dialogue, but you can read it all over Margot Kidder’s face. There goes my hero. Watch him as he goes. Few love interests in superhero films have ever matched what Margot Kidder accomplished in these pictures.\n\nThe action scenes are great set ups. I get a chill down my spine every time I watch the showdown in Metropolis between the three baddies against the man in blue and red. However, Richard Lester never neglects the acting throughout the whole two hours, particularly by the leads, as well as the Shakespearean maniacal performances from Stamp and Douglas. Furthermore, the extras throughout Metropolis, Houston and even in Niagara Falls are performing very well and therefore turning the various settings into characters themselves. Just as the fight over Metropolis is to begin, a cabbie declares “Man, this is gonna be good!” Isn’t that guy speaking for the audience? I remember the room applauding in the theater at that line. When Superman rescues a child in Niagara Falls, a woman utters “What a nice man!” Clifton James, from a couple of James Bond movies, resurrects that redneck persona and it works better here as the guy who clashes with the imposing new visitors. All of these walk on characters further shape the purpose of the visitors from space. None of it depends on B-movie tripe like declaring “Peace!” The personality of the folks meet the strangers from a strange land. Sometimes it is done for means of slapstick, but it is always very entertaining.\n\nSuperman II is a perfect complement to the original film thanks especially to the cast. Reeve gives multiple performances of Clark and Kal-El that could not be more different. Kidder takes her character in new directions upon learning the surprises the script has in store for Lois. Hackman is doing the same routine, but fortunately it’s welcome because I can not get enough of his antics.\n\nThis sequel really set the bar high and the next installments for Reeve came nowhere close. Though I actually have an affection for Superman III with that internal struggle depicted in the junk yard scene; one for the ages.\n\nThe first two movies are legendary and Warner Bros/DC films realize they still have not superseded what was done over forty years ago. The studios are not trying hard enough. However, more to the point, the filmmakers back then got it absolutely perfect, and you cannot beat Superman, nor can you beat perfection."
