        "text": "THE GIRLS OF A HARD DAY’S NIGHT\n\nHighlighting the uncredited lucky girls with bit parts in the Beatles’ first film!\n\n* * * *\n\nMAGGIE LONDON\n\nMaggie London, born Margaret E. Lyndon in 1937, was a swinging London model when cast for a small role in A Hard Day's Night. In the Twist club scenes Maggie is the blonde shown dancing first with Ringo, next with George, and then dancing again with Ringo. Another scene in which Ringo helps her with her glove was cut from the final edit much to Maggie's disappointment.\n\nAs a successful model Maggie London was listed in the International Model 1964 book for casting agents with the Jean Bell agency. Her listing described her as: 5 ft. 6 in. tall, blue eyes, red hair, Bust: 34 in., Waist: 23 in., Hips: 36 in. Specializes in Hair and Legs.\n\nPrior to A Hard Day's Night Maggie had worked in a couple of uncredited parts and went on to act in several television episodes through 1970 - including a 1968 appearance in The Saint (see Maggie London's IMDb listing for details).\n\nIn 1967 Maggie London married Mike d'Abo of the group Manfred Mann. They became parents of son Ben and actress daughter, Olivia d'Abo (who in the 90's dated Julian Lennon).\n\n* * * *\n\n-16 Magazine's January 1965 issue featured the following article on Maggie London telling about her audition for A Hard Day's Night, getting to know the Beatles, dating Ringo - then meeting his girlfriend Maureen Cox and the latest London trends:\n\nTHE LATEST FROM LONDON! Intimate news and views on the Beatles and other of your favorite British people!\n\nMAGGIE LONDON, a stunning English model, has just crossed the Atlantic to continue her career in New York City. Naturally, Maggie is up on all the very latest happenings in England, and she is the perfect person to fill you in on what’s new in the home of the fab “Beat Groups.” This blonde-haired beauty is still breathless over the exciting time she had playing a bit part in the Beatles’ flick, A Hard Day's Night. An actor friend of Maggie’s was in the film and tipped her off as to when they were trying out girls for the bit parts.\n\n“I went down to the Scarlet* Theatre,” Maggie recalls, “where they were filming. I sat in the auditorium while we waited for Dick Lester, and I almost fell over when Paul and George walked in and sat down right in front of me! You see, I had been a Beatlemaniac for two years. I really was among the first to discover them. My best friend, actor Terence Stamp, and myself had been raving about the boys from the start, so you can imagine how I felt when I suddenly found myself sitting right behind two living, beautiful Beatles!\n\n(*this is probably the Scala Theatre.)\n\n“When Dick Lester got around to me, he started thumbing through my modeling picture book. George and Paul turned around and looked over his shoulder. Paul kept muttering, ‘Yes, yes - they are lovely pictures’ - then he looked mischieviously up at me and quipped, ‘But can you play an old man?’”\n\nMaggie was thrilled when she learned that she was among those selected to appear in two scenes - one was in the Twist Club (where she danced with Ringo) and the other was backstage, where Ringo stops and helps her put her glove on. The last scene was cut, much to Maggie’s sorrow.\n\nThe first time Maggie had a real conversation with a real Beatle was when Ringo sat at her table during lunch break one day. He took a lot of photos of her. “Ringo is always snapping pictures - just like he does in the film,” Maggie explains.\n\nA short time later the still photographer for the movie invited Maggie to a dinner party at his home. When she arrived she was pleased to see Ringo there. Neither of them knew any of the other people there very well, so Maggie had a ball dancing and talking with Richie Starr! Maggie had a couple of dates with Ringo after that, but she knew they were nothing serious for he often spent the evening telling her about another girl. You guessed it - Maureen Cox.\n\n“I actually got to meet Maureen a few months later,” says Maggie. “It was at the Ad Lib, a night club where most of the London kids hang out each evening. There is one very informal corner, and one night when my date and I headed for it, we saw Ringo and Maureen in the group there. I got to talk with Maureen and found her to be a soft-spoken, charming girl. She is so very much ‘herself,’ and has a distinctive style of her very own. I could easily see why any guy would fall for her. I learned later that Ringo has a huge picture of her framed and hanging in his Knightsbridge flat. Lucky girl!\n\n“The absolute rage in London now is ‘hair.’ Every bird and chap is very conscious about their bonnet (as hair-do is called there). Vidal Sassoon is the top hair-stylist and does Cilla Black and Dusty Springfield. At night he does the fellows! His customers include Dave Clark, Michael Caine, Eden Kane and Terry Stamp. The Stones haven’t gotten around to Vidal yet! Cilla really sets the pace. She’s considered absolutely top dollie (that’s the way we say the living end!). Everyone copies Cilla!”\n\nEND"
