        "text": "With the upcoming Dakar Rally set to ignite the landscapes of Saudi Arabia on January 5, anticipation is soaring among drivers and riders preparing for this grand spectacle. Among them is Saudi rally champion Dania Akeel, a trailblazer in the multifaceted world of motorsports.\n\nDiverse Racing Journey: From the UAE National Sports Bike Superseries to the Dakar Rally, Dania began as a leisure motorcyclist in the UAE. The transition to rally racing felt natural, rooted in her off-road desert experiences.\n\nDakar Rally Challenges: Dania reflects on her first Dakar race, emphasising the joy amid toughness. Overcoming challenges, like navigating water and heat, is about developing skills and maintaining a positive mentality.\n\nBenefits of the Dakar: Dania highlights the physical and healthy camaraderie among drivers and riders. The Dakar Rally fosters discipline, commitment, and personal growth, not just as competitors but as a team.\n\nLessons Learnt: Recalling her 2022 Dakar experience, Dania stresses the importance of staying focused on the present moment. An initial setback with her car’s turbo became a valuable lesson in resilience and concentration.\n\nInspiring Women in Motorsports: Dania underscores the inclusivity of motorsports, rejecting the burden of individual athletes representing entire categories. She encourages aspiring female drivers to pursue their passion without hesitation.\n\nDakar’s Cultural Impact: Being a Saudi, Dania cherishes the Dakar Rally’s role in showcasing diverse regions of her country. It’s a cultural exploration, breaking stereotypes, and fostering connections with people from around the world.\n\nYour racing journey, from the UAE National Sports Bike Superseries to the Dakar Rally, has been diverse. What drew you to rally racing and inspired you to take on the Dakar?\n\nI started racing motorcycles in circuits in the United Arab Emirates as a leisure activity. I used to go to the track on weekends, and it was just a lot of fun. I switched to rally because I saw that Saudi Arabia hosted international events, such as the Dakar Rally – which is hugely popular there.\n\nIt looked like a very exciting sport, and since I grew up riding quad bikes in the desert off-road, rallying felt familiar. Starting from bikes on the track sets you up for speed. You become accustomed to it, and get comfortable in a car, making it a nice entry point to racing.\n\nAt the time, it was 2021, and the borders were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. That’s when I seriously started considering rallying as travel was limited. I thought, ‘Okay, what can I do in racing at this moment?’ I looked at Saudi Arabia, and this was what was going on. It was a change, but everything felt very natural and like a very organic transition. Since then, it’s just been so much fun.\n\nThe Dakar Rally is known for its extreme conditions. Can you share some of the biggest challenges you have faced?\n\nIn my first Dakar race, many people kept telling me how tough [of a competition] it was. But when I got in the car and started driving, I wondered why they weren’t emphasising how fun it actually was. After all, we love driving and spending the whole day in the car. Yes, it is a challenging race, but in the end, the basic reason you are there is your love for the sport. Whatever difficulties or obstacles you think you’ll have to face, they become lessons on how to become a better driver or how to develop your character.\n\nFor example, during my first year of rally, 400 kilometres felt like a lot, and I remember counting the kilometres. But today, 400 kilometres are more or less standard, and I no longer have to coach myself through the distances as often because they’ve become familiar.\n\nWhen it comes to terrain or weather conditions, it can be tricky to go through the water in rally cars; and if it’s hot, you’re behind a windscreen and you don’t get much air, how do you maintain your focus when you feel uncomfortable physically? You have a choice on how to face those challenges, and you can try your best to learn how to pass through them – whether you need to be a more patient driver through the water, or need to be a bit more responsible in how you hydrate when it’s hot, or a bit more careful with how you approach the dunes. This just forces you to develop your skills, and with that mentality, it’s easier to have a good time. If you keep thinking ‘This is a difficult race,’ then it is easy for the fun to leave the picture.\n\nWhat are some positive aspects or benefits of participating in the Dakar, besides the love for driving?\n\nDrivers and riders are all coming together for a really healthy and physical purpose. They wake up early in the morning, concentrate, and perform. Setting targets and goals, they execute them with discipline and commitment. They have responsibilities towards their sponsor and teammates, and, in the face of daily challenges, they must find the maturity to overcome them. They also must communicate effectively to build a good team. It’s a really rich environment for personal growth.\n\nReflecting on your first Dakar Rally in 2022, what were the standout moments or lessons that you carry with you into the upcoming races?\n\nIn the first week, I was having a great time driving without focusing on results. My goal was just to finish [the race]. By the end of week one, I discovered we made it to P6 in the T3 [lightweight vehicles category], which is good for a rookie – P6 out of 40 cars at the time, that’s promising. However, during the rest day, people told me I had a chance at the podium and I started thinking about the results. This changed my mentality.\n\nOn day seven I noticed the car had a turbo issue. Focused on results and stressed by the turbo lag, I [made the mistake of using] the brakes less to maintain the momentum and compensate for speed. I crashed the car, and we lost 4 hours fixing it as well as nine positions. We came back in 15th place from P6. And it was all because I took my focus away from the driving, started to get frustrated, and made a mistake.\n\nWith five days left in the race, I had a choice to make: either I could just give up and finish the race – and that would have probably been a miserable experience – or I could buckle up and focus. I thought ‘No, I have five days. Let me drive as best as I can, and enjoy every kilometre as it is a privilege to be in this race.’ Within five days we climbed back to the top ten and finished in P8.\n\nIf you’re driving a car and you’re thinking about the outcome instead of what you’re doing in that moment, it’s very likely you could encounter a problem – which is exactly what happened to me. That lesson will stay with me always.\n\nIn the traditionally male-dominated world of motorsports, your presence as a female driver is noteworthy. How do you view your role in inspiring women, not only in Saudi Arabia but globally? And what message do you have for aspiring female racers?\n\nThe point about being a woman is interesting. I never thought about it when I started racing. The International Automobile Federation (FIA) regulations state that men and women compete in the same category. What they ask you [when you want to participate] is a driver’s licence, a racing licence, safety equipment, a helmet, gloves, and shoes. I just focused on what the rules said, and that’s it. Anything that had to do with gender didn’t really cross my mind.\n\nAs one of the few women in rally, last year, I felt a sense of responsibility to represent women in the sport. On top of that, there was added pressure to perform well because I wanted people to think positively about women. Later, I realised that this was a mistake and was actually hindering my performance. It’s not realistic; one person cannot represent all. You are an athlete who is a woman, and you can only perform to the best of your ability.\n\nOf course, there aren’t as many women in motorsports compared to men, but I don’t see this as an issue. The category is open to both men and women. If women don’t see themselves in that category, one has to ask whether it’s because they’re not interested in motorsports or if there’s a perception that this sport is not for women.\n\nMy advice to aspiring female drivers is simple: if it’s a passion and they’re attracted to rally, then they should stick to the rulebook – which invites them in – and go for it.\n\nThe Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia is not just a race; it’s a cultural event. How do you think the Dakar impacts Saudi heritage and international perception, and how does that affect your approach to the race?\n\nBeing a Saudi, I’m truly grateful for the Dakar Rally taking place in Saudi Arabia, because it has allowed me to discover many parts of my country that I had never visited before. I have been a tourist in my own home through this event, being able to see the difference in culture between the East, West, North, and South – each region boasting different food, music, art, linguistic accents and ways of communicating with people. And that’s just all within one country. So, if someone from Saudi is gaining a deeper insight into their own country, I can only imagine how much a foreigner must be absorbing.\n\nIt’s a privilege to have access to all of these different places and to have a reason to visit them. When I drive through these towns with rally cars, locals are surprised to learn I am Saudi. This is something new for us, especially since women have been on the road only since 2018 – let alone finding a woman in a rally car. I love telling them I’m from Saudi Arabia, from Jeddah, and usually people are very friendly and hospitable. It’s quite an experience both for those people and me.\n\nAnd that’s in addition to the fact that you are crossing beautiful landscapes – from the beaches to the red rock canyons, the sandy dunes and the green mountains, to miles-long white rock flat lands that make you feel like you’re on the moon. In a world filled with technology, it’s always nice to be in nature, to be fully present outdoors, and to engage in something physical. It’s something invaluable, and the Dakar provides all of these things to us.\n\nAnother aspect I love about this race is how it brings people from all over the world together. I believe it’s really important to stay connected with different cultures and get to know individuals from various countries. This widens your perspective on life and enriches your overall experience. The Dakar is one big moving international gathering where you meet people exchange knowledge, and learn from one another – it’s truly a wonderful event. So it’s really not just a race. It’s a full experience.\n\nLearn more about Dania Akeel HERE.\n\nDelve into many more captivating Dakar Rally stories with the ‘In The Dust’ studio show.

Gemma later went on to win bronze at the prestigious Paris event in 2020, competing in the -70kg category.\n\nGemma went on to win a further two Grand Slam bronze medals and a silver at the 2022 Tel Aviv Grand Slam whilst on the Grand Prix stage, she has won 10 medals including gold medals in Zagreb and Budapest in 2019.\n\nGemma has overcome multiple injuries and eleven surgeries throughout her career. Gemma’s career highlight came in 2022 when she won gold at the European Championships in Sofia in the -63kg category; 4 years after taking bronze at the Championships in Tel Aviv in the -70kg category.\n\nUpon her retirement, Gemma said: “It is so hard to say this out loud and I will be honest, I have been dreading this moment, but I finally think it is time to start putting my health first and retire from judo.\n\n“I thought about stopping last year, after the last surgery, and never cried so much in my life. I know it wasn’t the right time then, but I do feel like now is the right time. It doesn’t make the decision any easier though.\n\n“If my body would let me, I would keep doing this sport forever. It is the best sport in the world.\n\nSpeaking about making the decision to retire 7 months ahead of Paris, Gemma said: “The surgeon said in the summer that my arm injury was ‘career-ending’ due to the timing required to return; but I choose to believe in the 1% chance that I could return and make Paris.\n\n“A recent diagnosis of Dupuytren’s contracture has resulted in me having 7 courses of radiotherapy, which has set me back even more. I think this is my bodies way of saying ‘enough is enough’.\n\nReflecting on her career, Gemma commented: “I am really proud of what I have achieved and how I have come back from all the injuries. Qualifying for London was massive, I can still recall picking up my Olympic kit.\n\n“The win at the European Championships is the best feeling I have ever had in my entire life. Knowing what I overcame to get to that point made it all the more special.\n\n“Whilst judo is an individual sport, I have so many people to thank who have helped me throughout my career, without whom, I would not have had the success that I have had. Bill Kelly was like a second dad to me since I started at Wolverhampton Judo Club aged 8. Growing up I idolised Kate Howey, so to have her as my coach is really special, not many people have a two-time Olympic medallist as a coach.\n\n“Finally, I have to thank Jamie Johnson for the support he has given me, he has helped me overcome so many injuries and to have him in the chair for the European victory was a special moment for us both.\n\nSpeaking about the next chapter, Gemma said: “It is going to take some time to get used to. Judo is my life, it’s my identity, it’s all I have ever known. I have plans to become a maths teacher, but I think it will take a while to get away from being ‘Judo Gemma’.”\n\nBritish Judo Performance Director, Nigel Donohue said: “It is always sad when a fighter’s career comes to an end, but Gemma can be extremely proud, as we are, of her achievements. Gemma has had many setbacks over the years, but I have never known a more determined and resilient athlete who kept coming back and remarkably, became European Champion just 18 months ago.\n\n“Gemma has just not been a formidable fighter on the mat as she is an inspiration to many to show just what you can achieve if you work hard and never give in.\n\n“Also, Gemma is one of the nicest and most caring people that you will ever meet who truly has a heart of gold. We wish Gemma all the very best as she transitions out of Elite Judo and who will always be a part of our Team.”\n\nJamie Johnson, GB Judo Women’s Lead Coach commented: “I have known Gemma since she was a member of the cadet squad. She has always given 100% no matter the situation, which as a coach, is all I could ever ask for.\n\n“Her family and club coach (Bill Kelly) have been the backbone of her very successful judo career. Together we have shared some very special moments, but her European gold is one I will always remember and treasure forever.\n\n“As a person, Gemma will go out of her way to help anybody; she is a very kind-hearted woman and an inspiration to everybody in judo. Whilst Gemma will be sorely missed around the British Judo Olympic and Paralympic National Training Centre, I know she will be a success as she embarks on her new journey as a maths teacher.”\n\nKate Howey MBE has worked with Gemma since she was in her early teens. Reflecting on their time together, she said: ‘I have been coaching and around Gemma for 20 years within the GB setup up and we have been on a journey with a fair few lows but some really good highs, from many operations to qualifying for two Olympic Games.\n\nGemma has had a fantastic career from winning a junior world bronze in Thailand (2008) to winning and becoming European Champion in 2022 and competing at two Olympic Games. It has been a privilege to be part of her journey and watch her grow into the amazing adult she is now and she will be missed around the WCPP programme and British Judo. I personally wish her well in the future and I hope she is as successful as a teacher as she was as a judoka.’\n\nWatch out for further news from British Judo by checking out our latest news section.

The Scottish athlete beat her nearest opponent by one minute and 23 seconds in one of the most dominant performances ever seen on the continental stage.\n\nBy the end of the second lap, she was already ahead by 21 seconds, and the gap just kept on growing with the gold looking more of a certainty as the race unfolded. In the end, she had time to give high fives to the crowd before crossing the line to win her first U23 cross country gold medal – matching her 5000m victory in the summer – following silver last year, and U20 gold in 2021.\n\nKeith joined Emma Pallant, Jess Piasecki (nee Coulson) and Rhona Auckland as champions in the age group at these championships.\n\nShe also contributed to U23 women’s team gold after some excellent performances from the squad. Alex Millard (Bill Foster, Invicta East Kent) – bronze medallist in 2022 – was 11th, while Eloise Walker (Trevor Painter, Edinburgh) was the third and final counter in 15th which saw the GB & NI team as clear winners ahead of Germany and Spain.\n\nTia Wilson (Bill Foster, Bedford & County) and Lynn McKenna (John Montgomery, Shettleston) were 34th and 35th on their debuts, while Olivia Mason (Graeme Mason, Border) was 44th on her return to the British team fold.\n\nAfterwards, a delighted Megan Keith said, “I am very happy with that one. Innes had a flyer this morning so that certainly inspired me, and I wanted to put in another solid run for the team. It was tough but I am very happy to have won the gold medal.\n\n“We knew it was a course that you could pay the price on if you started too fast, so I was intending to sit back on the first few laps and work on through, but I think everyone was a bit reluctant to go with the pace I set out at, so I committed to it and I am glad it paid off.\n\n“It will be a very proud moment for me to be on the podium. It was the first race this year that all my family came to watch, so it’s extra special to win today.”\n\nThe next race that followed was equally as exciting for the British perspective as Will Barnicoat (Aldershot Farnham and District) followed U20 gold from 2022’s edition of the Championships with U23 gold in Brussels after a superb performance to outsprint the Frenchman Valentin Bresc.\n\nMatt Stonier (Sonia and Chris McGeorge, Invicta East Kent) would also win a fantastic bronze to ensure that two Brits would be on the podium, with the team also winning gold.\n\nBarnicoat and Stonier were always main players in the contest, holding their place in the leading group for long periods, and as the race unfolded, the pair were part of a breakaway three that looked set to consolidate medal positions as they headed into the final lap. Barnicoat and Bresc opened a slight gap on Stonier as they entered the last 800m and the pair would ultimately become embroiled in a battle royale to the finish line with the Briton edging ahead to seal the title.\n\nStonier led the rest of the British charge in third overall, with James Kingston (Mark Hookway, Tonbridge) in 21st which confirmed the team’s gold medal. Tomer Tarragano (Dean Miller, Brighton & Hove) was 27th across the line, with Henry McLuckie (Geoff Watkin, Isle of Wight) in 57th. Unfortunately, Rory Leonard (Morpeth) withdrew from the race near the halfway stage.\n\nBarnicoat, who ensured the title stayed in GB & NI hands after Charles Hicks’ two consecutive U23 titles, said, “Last year I won the gold medal in the U20 race and people told me that it was a bit of a lucky win there. Today I confirmed that it wasn’t and that I can also win in the U23.\n\n“To be honest I didn’t know what to expect today, because I didn’t run that well in the trials. The course suited me perfectly because I like the mud. In the end it was a tight finish. I just waited to attack in the last downhill and I was able to keep off the French athlete in the end.”\n\nIn the first race of the day, Innes Fitzgerald (Gavin Pavey, Exeter) set the tone for the team as she dominated the U20 women’s race to take her maiden European title. The Devon athlete led from the early stages and always looked in control as her quality shone at Laeken Park. With her teammates packing well behind, it was double golden delight for Fitzgerald as the team also secured the gold medal.\n\nFitzgerald made her move to the head of the field on the first hill as the athletes sprinted away at the start, and she looked comfortable as she glided across the mud. As she moved away on the second lap, only France’s Jade Le Corre attempted to go with her pace, but that challenge soon faded as Fitzgerald pushed on to European success and become the seventh Briton to win a European women’s U20 title.\n\nJess Bailey (Matthew Long, Leven Valley) was the next British finisher across the line in eighth and in winning that team gold, she now holds international medals in cross country, on the track and in mountain running. Lizzie Wellsted (Colchester) was the third and final counter in the team standings, coming home in 13th place after a gutsy performance on her maiden appearance for GB & NI.\n\nKatie Pye (Mick Woods, Aldershot Farnham and District) was 28th with Moli Lyons (Chris Jones, Cardiff) and Zoe Hunter (Jethro McGraw, Leeds City) 31st and 32nd respectively.\n\nAfter celebrating with her teammates, Fitzgerald said, “I am really pleased and so happy to come away with the win, particularly as I wasn’t satisfied after last year. I think I showed everyone what I had, and this is more than I could dream of. I wasn’t intending on leading things, so when I saw that I was alone at front, I just kept going and kept pushing myself.\n\n“We had such a strong team, so I am very pleased to win team gold. We knew we had a chance, and everyone knew they had to push through and try the best that they could, so I am really proud.”\n\nThere was even more team gold success in the penultimate race of the day, this time for the senior women as Abbie Donnelly (Rob Lewis, Lincoln Wellington) secured her maiden European medal with individual bronze after a stunning performance.\n\nDonnelly, who has been a key member of British cross country teams for a number of years, got her breakthrough after committing in the early stages. She followed the breakaway move of Norway’s Karoline Bjerkeli Grovdal – who would eventually win – and it was a tactical decision which would pay the ultimate award. Although Nadia Battocletti would pass her for silver, Donnelly held on for her first senior international medal.\n\nJessica Warner-Judd (Mick Judd, Blackburn) – competing in her ninth European Cross Country Championships – was the next British scorer in fifth after a typically hard-fought performance. Izzy Fry (Chris and Sonia McGeorge, Newbury) was the third and final scorer in 10th, with a fast-finishing Poppy Tank (Luke Gunn, City of Plymouth) coming through in 11th, an improvement from 13th last year.\n\nAmelia Quirk (Mick Woods, Bracknell) and Niamh Bridson Hubbard (Philip O’Dell, Blackheath & Bromley) would back their teammates up with top 20 finishes themselves; 16th and 19th overall to complete a stellar team performance.\n\nThe U20 men’s team came agonisingly close to team gold, but it was Ireland who secured it by two points, however, it was an excellent effort from a team full of new and young talent.\n\nSam Mills (Exeter) – who was fourth in Turin last year – committed early on, and despite the eventual top three pulling clear of the rest of the field, Mills worked hard to match his fourth position. He battled well over the challenging course, and he’d eventually finish in fifth place.\n\nTrials winner Henry Dover (Shaftesbury Barnet) was very close behind his compatriot and was overjoyed with his sixth-place finish at his first European Cross Country Championships. Rowan Miell-Ingram (Wendy Miell-Ingram, Radley) was the third counter as he battled to 13th.\n\nNext across the line for GB & NI was Andrew McGill (Michael Johnston, Livingston) in 22nd, while Sam Hodgson (Shireen Higgins, Windsor Slough Eton & Hounslow) was 25th and Louis Small (Stella Bandu, Ashford) narrowly behind in 29th.\n\nIn the third race of the day, Khahisa Mhlanga (Andrew Hobdell, Herts Phoenix) produced a stellar effort to anchor the senior mixed relay team to the bronze medal.\n\nWith teams able to change their running orders during the legs as the race was ongoing, the British team led after three legs, and with Mhlanga entering the final lap with a 55 second lead, other teams had their male athletes lined up for the final lap which would prove significant. Despite a brave effort, she was just reeled in by France and Netherlands with over 150m to go.\n\nJoshua Lay (Anthony Love, Rugby and Northampton) got the team off to a fantastic start as he battled to hand over to the second leg in second place, and from there Bethan Morley (Bill Foster, Leeds City) extended GB & NI’s advantage as she took the lead in the early stages of her 1500m lap. The debutant enjoyed the second half of the contest and pulled away to give Adam Fogg (Coventry) the opportunity to open up a huge advantage on the rest of the field. And, that he did.\n\nMhlanga set off on the final lap with almost a minute advantage and ran an excellent 1500m but was just pipped in the final section heading into the finish, but it was a valiant effort which earned the quartet team bronze.\n\nA sterling run from Hugo Milner (Derby) saw him finish fourth, just pipped to the medals, in the senior men’s race as the team finished fifth overall.\n\nMilner was in the mix for an individual medal as he was in the leading group for much of the race, and even though Frenchman Yann Schrub accelerated away to win on the final lap, Milner still had a chance to win silver and bronze as he entered the final 1000m. However, he admitted he didn’t have the final acceleration like Magnus Tav Myhre (NOR) and Robin Hendrix (BEL) so would ultimately end the race in fourth place behind the pair.\n\nCalum Johnson (Gateshead) was the next Briton across the line after a strong finish, coming home in 23rd, just ahead of Zakariya Mahamed (Idris Hamud, Southampton) who was 27th in his first senior race at the Championships.\n\nDebutants Angus McMillan (Don McMillan, City of York) and Alfie Manthorpe (John Wood, Sheffield & Dearne) were 38th and 44th respectively, while team captain Callum Elson (Cambridge & Coleridge) finished his campaign in 59th.\n\nThe Great Britain and Northern Ireland medal tally:\n\nGold (7): Will Barnicoat [U23 Men],Innes Fitzgerald [U20 Women], Megan Keith [U23 Women], Senior Women’s Team, U23 Women’s Team, U23 Men’s Team, U20 Women’s Team\n\nSilver (1): U20 Men’s Team\n\nBronze (3): Abbie Donnelly [Senior women],Matt Stonier [U23 Men],Senior Mixed Relay Team\n\nThere will also be a highlights programme on BBC Two and the BBC iPlayer between 17:00-18:00 on Sunday 10 December.\n\nJeddah, 2 December 2023 – Alinghi Red Bull Racing started the final day at the Preliminary Regatta knowing they needed victories in their AC40 for a chance to reach the match race final. But Italy’s win in fleet race 7 to begin the afternoon put a top-two overall finish out of reach for the crew of Maxime Bachelin, Yves Detrey, Bryan Mettraux and Arnaud Psarofaghis. The Swiss team showed their fight in the final fleet race finishing second. Next up for the members of Alinghi Red Bull Racing, the focus will shift to training on the team’s AC75 BoatZero together with the power group sailors, who have been on-hand here in Jeddah this week.\n\nPietro Sibello, performance coach: “Big picture is that we are the third team in the America’s Cup at the moment. We have to acknowledge that. If we take it race by race, we didn’t perform as we had hoped. We definitely need to take some learnings from this regatta. I think one of the keys is that the team never gave up. The sailors, the shore team and everybody was pushing all the way to the end. We saw that in the last race, which was a key one to finish like we did. We learned a lot about the starts, which didn’t really work well for us this week. We also need to focus on communication which is super-important on this class of boats. Those are the big takeaway for us.”\n\nArnaud Psarofaghis, skipper: “Unfortunately, we dropped from the foils in the first race and it separated us from the fleet, so it was hard to come back. We had a good second race today because we sailed the way we wanted and were fighting for the win the whole way. It was nice to make the adjustments for that second race today and then secure third place overall.\n\nWe will take a lot of this experience into next year. Every aspect of this campaign will continue to be closely looked at. The main thing we need to focus on is to be able to react quickly from one day to the other when something might not be working as it should. In the end, we are in the mix. I think we are more in the top of the fleet rather than the back of the pack. To be in the top three at the moment, we don’t have to hold back from saying this.”\n\nYves Detrey, trimmer: “From a team point of view, we are happy to show that we’re absolutely in the mix – that’s the biggest learning. Our strength is that we have a strong group with such dependable tech guys taking care of our boat. We had no issues at all in Jeddah, the boat performed well. We know we have the speed and can trim the boat. It’s obviously different with the big boat but we know we can count on those guys.\n\nThere’s a little bit of frustration, but not so much about today, more about yesterday. We finished the regatta with a good race, putting everything in place the way we should have done it earlier in the regatta.\n\nTo keep us in racing mode through August, I think we will still race the AC40s between us and have some match races. It’s all subject to the program that is put together for next year. We will definitely have a strong program for 2024 to keep that race mindset.”\n\nStaying the Distance by Catherine Baker – a book I have been excited for since I heard Catherine was writing it, and it certainly did not disappoint! Staying the Distance is an insightful, inspiring and thought provoking view of what it takes to be a successful leader, whether that be in business or sport. Refreshingly for this type of book it was filled with plenty of accounts from female coaches, athletes and leaders and is crammed with lessons that everyone of us can take away and implement in our roles as leaders and coaches. The philosophy of the book is one that is pertinent in today’s world of workaholics, fast results and immediate feedback, which often leads leaders and coaches to burnout. Staying the Distance walks you through the path of sustainability, calm and intentional behaviours to ensure you stay at the top throughout your career. If you want to find out more about Catherines work and her book, watch our interview with Catherine from earlier in the year: CLICK HERE\n\nUnfair Play by Sharron Davies – Through the lens of Sharron Davies’ own experience as an Olympic Medallist from the 1980 Moscow Games, and co-author Craig Lord’s experience as a journalist covering the Olympic Games for over 30 years, Unfair Play is an incredibly well researched account of the discrimination women have faced throughout the modern Olympic Games. It is a candid, honest, and no BS deep dive into the fight for women’s sport and the current challenges of keeping women’s sport ring fenced for women. Unfair Play addresses topics such as the GDR doping of the 1970’s and 80’s, the delay in allowing women to compete in sports such as Cycling, Weightlifting and Boxing in the Olympics and the current transgender debate. The book does not shy away from the truth and the devastating impact that poor sports governance can have on women and girls around the Globe.\n\nMaster of Change by Brad Stulberg – Master of Change is a philosophical yet practical look at how we typically deal with change, and how we can excel during this change by shifting our focus from the need for homeostasis (returning to previous stability) to the need for allostasis (achieving new stability). Using examples from the high-performance world of business and sport, resilience-training, mindset-hacking, science, spirituality, philosophy and psychology – Brad takes us through the concept of cultivating a fluid sense of self, and the importance of implementing rugged flexibility. If we really do all buy into John Wooden’s coaching philosophy of “Your players must know that you care for them more than just as athletes.”, then shouldn’t change management and developing a fluid sense of self be part of what we coach our athletes? After reading Master of Change, I’d be surprised if any coach still says no.\n\nSecond Set of Eyes by Cody Royle – This is one of my top 3 books published this year, and feel that every Coach, Performance Director and Coach Developer needs to read it! Second Set of Eyes delves deep into where Cody believes this unintentionally designed system has lead us. Using examples from the NFL, English Football, NCAA Basketball, International Rugby and Aussie Rules, Cody shares with us stories of high performing coaches who are burned out due to ‘chronic individualism’, having sacrificed too much of their personal life for a job with no boundaries. Cody’s messaging throughout the book echos the messaging we are trying to get across through the Female Coaching Network, that is, the coaching system needs to change for the betterment of coaches and athletes. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, and in particular would recommend it to those in charge of designing high performance coaching systems. By designing a human centric system, and not one that treats coaches (and athletes) like robots, we can create an intentionally safe, efficient and effective system for all to thrive.\n\nHidden Potential – Adam Grant – Having read every one of Adam Grant’s books and enjoyed nearly all of his podcasts, I was thrilled to see the release of another gem from him. Hidden Potential is yet another thought provoking, sensible and wise take on people development from the master of organisational psychology. One of the things I love about Adam’s messaging is how tangible and thought provoking each one of his discussions are are. His books (podcasts and social media posts) are always backed up by scientific evidence and inspiring anecdotal stories. The premise of Hidden Potential is to challenge the notion that all high achievers were once child prodigies and that greatness is born. Adam Grant argues that in fact the opposite is true “we can all rise to achieve great things”, and that “if provided with appropriate conditions of learning”, we can become “freaks of nurture, not nature”. Another brilliant book by Adam Grant, highly recommend to coaches who are looking for inspired ways of supporting their athletes through the following season, and for administrators looking to create changes.\n\nThe Race to Be Myself by Caster Semenya – a heartbreaking, devastating and shameful retelling of the experience of one of track and field’s most well known and successful athletes, Caster Semenya. I am not going to use this review to dive into the conversation around women’s sport, what I am going to do is recommend everyone read this book. Athletes are humans and should never be treated like fodder for the media and governing bodies to experiment on. As someone who has spent my life in track and field as a coach and change maker, I was appalled to read in detail the experience Caster was put through. Whilst I have followed her story closely since she won the World Championships in 2009, sitting down reading her experience in her own words was powerful and truly heartbreaking. Caster has had no choice but to be brave, but her honesty throughout her book was astonishing. My only hope is that those who played their part in the atrocious way she has been treated take a moment to reflect on their behaviour and that no one else is put through what she was.\n\nPerformance Under Pressure by Ceri Evans – As a coach and avid reader, I have read a myriad of self help and mindset development books all with the aim of educating myself in how better to support the coaches I work with, but also to find effective ways of improving my own lifestyle. It has not been until I read the book Performance Under Pressure, that the penny dropped, and I felt I finally found a practical way of coping with pressure. The concept is simple: when you feel out of control, overwhelmed, overloaded and hot headed, you are in the RED brain, and when you feel in control, have clear thinking and are task focussed, you are in the BLUE brain. The model then provides you with the tools you need to move across the scale out of the RED and into the BLUE when you need it the most.\n\nDelete the Adjective by Lisa Jester – is an account of the journey of one of only three women to ever have made it through the US Rangers School. It is an exceptional story of grit and determination of one woman who wanted to show what she was made of. Lisa not only the oldest at 37, she was also a Mum of two – the average age of a trainee is 23 and male. Lisa volunteered for combat training when she discovered the Army Ranger course was being opened to women for the first time in 60 years as a U.S. government experiment to gauge how women would fare in the course. One of the key themes I took from the book is to not aim for being the best woman, aim for being the best. Lisa concludes by saying ‘I have a platform because I am old, female solider who passed Ranger school – but I want to use that platform to make the best voices heard on merit.”\n\nJoin in the discussion and share your favourite books of 2023"
