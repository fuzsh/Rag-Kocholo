        "text": "Michael’s collection contains many references to A Popular History of East Kerry (1931) by T M Donovan and includes Michael’s own handwritten index thereto (IE MOD-74-74.2), notes on the content of the book, genealogical notes on Donovan and a copy of an article by Donovan (IE MOD-74-74.5) published in the Westminster Review in 1902.\n\nIt is clear Michael appended a particular value to this work.\n\nCastleisland-born writer\n\nTeacher and author, T[imothy] M Donovan, who lived most of his adult life in Australia, was born in Castleisland c1863, son of Michael Donovan and Ellen Lenihan (or Linehan), the third of six children.1 He attended school in Castleisland and wrote an account of his experiences there:\n\nArchdeacon O’Connell built the beautiful parish church in Castleisland and also that of Cordal. He also built the present Castleisland National School … I had the doubtful honour of being the only boy in the national school whom he personally flogged and yet when I knelt by his bedside on the morning he died the tears flowed copiously for the loss of a good friend and a wise spiritual father.\n\nIn a description of Powell’s Road, Donovan revealed the following about his ancestry:\n\nThe limestone peninsula of Anna juts out into the big bogs of Annabeg and Annamore … near Anna is Ballygree where my great grandfather, Thade [Timothy] Donovan, had a farm between Lady Northcote and Mr William Powell of East Sandville. His son John Donovan and the latter’s six sons were born and reared at Ballygree but lest I should be accused of foolish pride at the fact that my people were living between such grand folk I hasten to add that a goodly share of the Donovan farm was cut-away bog and I dare say that some of the six brothers were glad to get work from their big Protestant neighbours.\n\nIn the same article, Donovan recorded the demise of his family in Castleisland:\n\nWhen reaping the Protestant corn my uncle John used to act as leader of the meitheal … the eldest of my uncles, Timothy, after whom I am called, was foreman and lodge keeper to Cardinal Wiseman in London. The Cardinal was nearly successful in making a priest of his eldest son John but in the very last year of his college course a young lady intervened and carried him off to the States … the children of all the six Donovan brothers of Ballygree went to the United States and I, after living forty years in Australia, am the last of the family of Castleisland.2\n\nAustralia bound\n\nDonovan left Castleisland for Australia in the 1880s when he was in his mid twenties:\n\nMy old mate and dear friend Jack Brosnan and I left Castleisland, Co Kerry in August 1887. The ship bound for Australia was to leave from the London docks at Blackwall so we went to London, via Cork and Bristol … We were emigrants nominated passages from a friend in Brisbane, Jack Riordan.3\n\nIn May 1888, Donovan was appointed teacher of a small country school in Queensland, later being promoted.4 His career in Australia is open to research.5\n\nIn 1916 Donovan was granted seven months leave of absence during which he returned ‘to see my old mother in the New Line in Castleisland’:6\n\nAfter a two months’ voyage we arrived in Castleisland about the middle of May … what a joy to breathe my native air once again, to meet old school mates, to kneel near the grave of my father. But the joy of all the joys was once more to hear my mother’s cry of welcome.7\n\nDonovan remarked on his mother’s piety and how, after her death, he wrote a sketch of her life for the Catholic Advocate:\n\nI have travelled the globe right round nearly five times and I have been in many lands – in every state of the Australian Commonwealth and through the United States, from ‘Frisco to New York and I have never met a man or a woman, priest or nun that loved Our Saviour more heartily and more humbly. Although a poor peasant woman she had the honour of giving a learned Jesuit Father and a hard-working Presentation Nun to the service of God.8\n\nPublication of first book\n\nDonovan’s first book, A Popular History of East Kerry, was a culmination of earlier articles. In two letters to the editor of the Kerryman in 1930, he outlined his publishing plan and sought subscription:\n\nIf I get any encouragement from East Kerrymen and women at home and abroad I would consider the project of publishing all my contributions to The Kerryman on the history of Castleisland and East Kerry in book form.9\n\nDonovan made ‘no claim to deep research or perfect accuracy … nearly all my facts have come to me through King’s History of Kerry and through the late Mr Jeremiah Nolan of Castleisland who died a few years ago at the great age of 91′.10\n\nOne of the more memorable sketches from A Popular History was Donovan’s depiction of John Mitchel entering the Maine Valley in the mid nineteenth century (p71).\n\nIn 1941 Donovan revived the scene again:\n\nMore than 100 years ago an English artillery officer, standing on the high road near Mount Eagle, said it was the finest landscape view in all Munster; and John Mitchel, coming down the Caol-na-Sprida from Cork said it was “a valley worth fighting for”.11\n\nDonovan was in poor health during the composition of his second book, God’s Glorious Universe: Excursions to the Stars (1932). He described how during a two week vacation at Kenmare he had to attend Cork for medical treatment:\n\nLast year when I was writing my book, God’s Glorious Universe, little I thought that the radium I described in one of its chapters would be used on my own body before a year had passed. Under the care of Dr James M O’Donovan, a professor in University College Cork a plaque of radium was applied to my face in order to cut away a growth that if not cleaned off might ultimately finish me off.12\n\nThird book ‘a study of the emotions’\n\nDespite this, another book, a work of fiction, was in progress and was published in 1933 under title The Two Mothers, or, Renunciation. It was reviewed in a local newspaper: ‘What Mrs Pender, Carlton, Griffin, Sheehan and Kickham have done for other parts of Ireland Mr Donovan is doing for dear delightful old Ciarraighe … we are given a study of the emotions of a typical Irish woman whose one ideal is to see her son a priest’.13\n\nA fourth book, Revolution: Christian or Communist (1937) was reviewed in the Irish Examiner, 16 June 1937.\n\nDonovan was vocal on public affairs. His letters and articles were published widely. In this letter to the editor in 1915, Donovan gave his view of local politics:\n\nBribery is rampant. It is a most scandalous fact that councillors are bought and the ratepayers are sold to the highest bidder. Sometimes a bottle of whiskey, sometimes a £5 note, and sometimes a life billet for a friend or relative. Worse still the river is tainted at its source. Many voters are bought for a treat or a crown or a bonham. The origin and font of power the polling booth is gerrymandered in face of and in spite of the laws against bribery and corruption … When a councillor takes a bribe he is surely dipping his hand feloniously into the taxpayers pocket as a pickpocket is when he steals a copper from the man in the street.14\n\nA thrashing from his father\n\nDonovan recalled how ‘even as a boy I had the itch of writing to the papers’. On one occasion that he did so, the result was not as he anticipated:\n\nA certain hotelkeeper, then posing as a great land-leaguer, allowed his two side-cars to take members of the RIC to an eviction … So I wrote a pretty hot letter to the editor denouncing the inconsistencies. Instead of printing my letter he handed it to the hotel-keeper and I got a severe thrashing from my father.15\n\nThe thrashing did not put him off. His contributions to the press were prolific and poetic:\n\nTo Die in Holy Ireland To die in holy Ireland, amid the friends I love Would be a crowning gift and grace from our dear Lord above, But, O, to die for Ireland and see her once more free, Would make my hope in Heaven be far more dear to me.16\n\nIn another of his numerous articles, Donovan included a note on Captain Monteith (‘Roger Casement’s Last Adventure, Details of the Kerry Part of this remarkable 1916 Exploit’, Kerryman, 16 December 1933 & Derry Journal, 14 December 1934) .\n\nLife and marriage\n\nLittle is known about Donovan’s personal life and no photograph of him can be traced. The likeness below was created from committee chairman Johnnie Roche’s recollection of Donovan. It is the work of his grandson, student Jack Roche.\n\nJohnnie described Donovan as ‘a thin, austere man, about 5′ 9″ tall’. Of this reconstructed image, he said, ‘the face is probably not a great resemblance, but generally, it’s a fair image’.\n\nNotes in the collection reveal Donovan married in 1892; no known children were born of this marriage, which Donovan described as ‘twenty years of great happiness’. His wife died in 1913 and he married secondly in 1922 in order to qualify for a school with a residence in Queensland:\n\nIt was a “made match” to a woman I knew nothing of. She turned out to be a nervous wreck: the doctors called it “major hysteria” which I later found, was “a ducas” – a family failing. My life with her was a living purgatory.17\n\nIn 1926 Donovan returned to live in his native town and in the years that followed, was described as ‘easily Castleisland’s doyen intellectual. History, philosophy, fiction, sociology, all have been enriched by his versatile pen’.18\n\nDonovan died in Castleisland on 13 June 1950. Notwithstanding his considerable contribution to the newspapers and indeed to literature, just a short notice appeared in the local press:\n\nThe death took place at his home in Church Street on Monday of Mr T M Donovan, aged around 90. He taught for many years in Australia and returned to his native town where he became interested in journalism. He wrote A History of Kerry and other books. He was a brother of the late Fr Donovan, SJ. The funeral took place to St Stephens’s on Tuesday. He is survived by his widow to whom deep sympathy is extended.19\n\nAn un-catalogued box of Donovan papers is held at the National library of Ireland (reference number PC 896). The material was deposited in the 1960s; details of depositor not known. It is not currently available to researchers.\n\n______________________________________________"
