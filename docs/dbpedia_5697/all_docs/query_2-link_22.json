        "text": "An affable sculptor best known for his naturalistic portraits, O’Donovan was at the epicenter of the New York art world in the 1870s. When he modeled this diminutive, yet truthful likeness of Homer from life, both men worked in the Tenth Street Studio Building, a locus for both older conservative and younger progressive artists. They were among the earliest members of the Tile Club, a group founded in 1877 ostensibly to paint decorative tiles, but mainly for camaraderie. O’Donovan exhibited Homer’s portrait at the establishment National Academy of Design in 1878, and again the following year at the upstart Society of American Artists; at that time he was elected to membership in each organization, testament to his knack for navigating differing artistic spheres."
