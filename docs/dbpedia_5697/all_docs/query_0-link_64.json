        "text": "Alan Rickman was born on a council estate in Acton, West London, to Margaret Doreen Rose (Bartlett), of English and Welsh descent, and Bernard Rickman, of Irish descent, who worked at a factory. Alan Rickman had an older brother (David), a younger brother (Michael), and a younger sister (Sheila). When Alan was 8 years old, his father died. He attended Latymer Upper School on a scholarship. He studied Graphic Design at Chelsea College of Art and Design, where he met Rima Horton, who would later become his longtime partner.\n\nAfter three years at Chelsea College, Rickman did graduate studies at the Royal College of Art. He opened a successful graphic design business, Graphiti, with friends and managed it for several years before his love of theatre led him to seek an audition with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). At the relatively late age of 26, Rickman received a scholarship to RADA, which started a professional acting career that has lasted nearly 40 years, a career which has spanned stage, screen and television, and overlapped into directing, as well. In 1987, he first came to the attention of American audiences as the Vicomte de Valmont in \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" on Broadway (he was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance in the role). Denied the role in the film version of the show, Rickman instead made his first film appearance opposite Bruce Willis in Stirb langsam (1988) as the villainous Hans Gruber. His take on the urbane villain set the standard for screen villains for decades to come.\n\nAlthough often cited as being a master of playing villains, Rickman actually played a wide variety of characters, such as the romantic cello-playing ghost Jamie in Anthony Minghella's Wie verrückt und aus tiefstem Herzen (1990) and the noble Colonel Brandon of Sinn und Sinnlichkeit (1995). He treated audiences to his comedic abilities in such films as Dogma (1999), Galaxy Quest - Planlos durchs Weltall (1999) and Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis (2005), and roles like Dr. Alfred Blalock in Ein Werk Gottes (2004), and as Alex Hughes in Snow Cake (2006), showcased his ability to play ordinary men in extraordinary situations. Rickman even conquered the daunting task of singing a role in a Stephen Sondheim musical as he took on the role of Judge Turpin in the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd: Der teuflische Barbier aus der Fleet Street (2007). In 2001, Rickman introduced himself to a whole new, younger generation of fans by taking on the role of Severus Snape in the film versions of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen (2001). He continued to play the role through the eighth and last movie Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 2 (2011).\n\nAlan Rickman died of pancreatic cancer on 14 January 2016. He was 69 years old.\n\nJack Palance quite often exemplified evil incarnate on film, portraying some of the most intensely feral villains witnessed in 1950s westerns and melodrama. Enhanced by his tall, powerful build, icy voice, and piercing eyes, he earned two \"Best Supporting Actor\" nominations early in his career. It would take a grizzled, eccentric comic performance 40 years later, however, for him to finally grab the coveted statuette.\n\nOf Ukrainian descent, Palance was born Volodymyr Ivanovich Palahniuk (later taking Walter Jack Palance as his legal name) on February 18, 1919 (although some sources, including his death certificate, cite 1920) in Lattimer Mines, Pennsylvania (coal country), one of six children born to Anna (nee Gramiak) and Ivan Palahniuk. His father, an anthracite miner, died of black lung disease. Palance worked in the mines in his early years but averted the same fate as his father. Athletics was his ticket out of the mines when he won a football scholarship to the University of North Carolina. He subsequently dropped out to try his hand at professional boxing. Fighting under the name \"Jack Brazzo\", he won his first 15 fights, 12 by knockout, before losing a 4th round decision to future heavyweight contender Joe Baksi on December 17, 1940.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, his boxing career ended and his military career began, serving in the Army Air Force as a bomber pilot. Wounded in combat and suffering severe injuries and burns, he received the Purple Heart, Good Conduct Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. He resumed college studies as a journalist at Stanford University and became a sportswriter for the San Francisco Chronicle. He also worked for a radio station until he was bit by the acting bug.\n\nPalance made his stage debut in \"The Big Two\" in 1947 and immediately followed it understudying Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski in the groundbreaking Broadway classic \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", a role he eventually took over. Following stage parts in \"Temporary Island\" (1948), \"The Vigil\" (1948), and \"The Silver Tassle\" (1949), Palance won a choice role in \"Darkness of Noon\" and a Theatre World Award for \"Promising New Personality.\" This recognition helped him secure a 20th Century-Fox contract. The facial burns and resulting reconstructive surgery following the crash and burn of his WWII bomber plane actually worked to his advantage. Out of contention as a glossy romantic leading man, Palance instead became the archetypal intimidating villain equipped with towering stance, imposing glare, and killer-shark smile.\n\nHe stood out among a powerhouse cast that included actors such as Richard Widmark, Zero Mostel and Paul Douglas in his movie debut in Elia Kazan's Unter Geheimbefehl (1950), as a plague-carrying fugitive. He was soon on his way. Briefly billed as Walter Jack Palance before eliminating the first name, the actor made fine use of his former boxing skills and war experience for the film Okinawa (1951) as a boxing Marine in Richard Widmark's platoon. He followed this with the first of his back-to-back Oscar nods. In Maskierte Herzen (1952), only his third film, he played rich-and-famous playwright Joan Crawford's struggling actor/husband who plots to murder her and run off with gorgeous Gloria Grahame. Finding just the right degree of intensity and menace to pretty much steal the proceedings without chewing the scenery, he followed this with arguably his finest villain of the decade, that of sadistic gunslinger Jack Wilson who takes on Alan Ladd's titular hero, played by Mein großer Freund Shane (1953), in a classic showdown.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Palance doled out strong leads and supports such as those in Der unheimliche Untermieter (1953) (his first lead), Hollywood-Story (1955) and the war classic Ardennen 1944 (1956). Mixed in were a few routine to highly mediocre parts in Flug nach Tanger (1953), Attila, der Hunnenkönig (1954) (as Attila the Hun), and the biblical bomb Basilus - Held von Rom (1954). In between filmmaking were a host of television roles, none better than his down-and-out boxer in Requiem for a Heavyweight (1956), a rare sympathetic role that earned him an Emmy Award.\n\nBack and forth overseas in the 1960s and 1970s, Palance would dominate foreign pictures in a number of different genres -- sandal-and-spear spectacles, biblical epics, war stories and \"spaghetti westerns.\" Such films included Austerlitz - Glanz einer Kaiserkrone (1960), Die Mongolen (1961), Barabbas (1961), Il criminale (1962), Die Verachtung (1963), Mercenario: Der Gefürchtete (1968), Marquis de Sade: Justine (1969), The Desperados (1969), Halleluja... Amigo (1972), Chatos Land (1972), Blut eines Bullen (1976), Willkommen in dieser blutigen Stadt (1977). Back home, he played Fidel Castro in Che! (1969) while also appearing in Monte Walsh (1970), Oklahoma, wie es ist (1973) and Das gnadenlose Spiel (1975).\n\nOn the made-for-television front, Jack played a number of nefarious nasties to perfection, ranging from Mr. Hyde (Die seltsame Geschichte von Dr. Jekyll und Mr. Hyde (1968)) to Dracula in Dracula (1974) to Ebenezer Scrooge in a \"Wild West\" version of the Dickens classic Weihnachten im wilden Westen (1998). He also played one of the Hatfields in The Hatfields and the McCoys (1975). Jack switched gears to star as a \"nice guy\" lieutenant in the single-season TV cop drama Bronk (1975). In later years, the actor mellowed with age, as exemplified by roles in Out of Rosenheim (1987), but could still display his bad side as he did as an evil rancher, crime boss or drug lord in, respectively, Young Guns - Sie fürchten weder Tod noch Teufel (1988), Batman (1989) and Tango und Cash (1989). Into his twilight years he showed a penchant for brash, quirky comedy capped by his Oscar-winning role in City Slickers - Die Großstadt-Helden (1991) and its sequel. He ended his film career playing Long John Silver in Die Schatzinsel (1999).\n\nHis three children by his first wife, actress Virginia Baker -- Holly Palance, Brooke Palance, and Cody Palance -- all pursued acting careers and appeared with their father at one time or another. A man of few words off the set, he owned his own cattle ranch and displayed other creative sides as a exhibited painter and published poet.\n\nHis last years were marred by both failing health and the 1998 death of his son Cody from melanoma. He was later diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died at the Santa Barbara County home of his daughter, Holly Palance, in 2006.\n\nGary Oldman is a talented English movie star and character actor, renowned for his expressive acting style. One of the most celebrated thespians of his generation, with a diverse career encompassing theatre, film and television, he is known for his roles as Sid Vicious in Sid & Nancy (1986), Drexl in True Romance (1993), George Smiley in Dame, König, As, Spion (2011), and Winston Churchill in Die dunkelste Stunde (2017), among many others. For much of his career, he was best-known for playing over-the-top antagonists, such as terrorist Egor Korshunov in the 1997 blockbuster Air Force One (1997), though he has reached a new audience with heroic roles in the Harry Potter and Dark Knight franchises. He is also a filmmaker, musician, and author.\n\nGary Leonard Oldman was born on March 21, 1958 in New Cross, London, England, to Kathleen (Cheriton), a homemaker, and Leonard Bertram Oldman, a welder. He won a scholarship to Britain's Rose Bruford Drama College, in Sidcup, Kent, where he received a B.A. in theatre arts in 1979. He subsequently studied with the Greenwich Young People's Theatre and went on to appear in a number of plays throughout the early '80s, including \"The Pope's Wedding,\" for which he received Time Out's Fringe Award for Best Newcomer of 1985-1986 and the British Theatre Association's Drama Magazine Award as Best Actor for 1985. Before fame, he was employed as a worker in assembly lines and as a porter in an operating theater. He also had jobs selling shoes and beheading pigs while supporting his early acting career.\n\nHis film debut was Remembrance (1982), though his most-memorable early role came when he played Sex Pistol Sid Vicious in the biopic Sid & Nancy (1986) picking up the Evening Standard Film Award as Best Newcomer. He then received a Best Actor nomination from BAFTA for his portrayal of '60s playwright Joe Orton in Das stürmische Leben des Joe Orton (1987).\n\nIn the 1990s, Oldman brought to life a series of iconic real-world and fictional villains including Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991), the title character in Bram Stokers Dracula (1992), Drexl Spivey in True Romance (1993), Stansfield in Léon: Der Profi (1994), Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg in Das fünfte Element (1997) and Ivan Korshunov in Air Force One (1997). That decade also saw Oldman portraying Ludwig van Beethoven in biopic Ludwig van B. - Meine unsterbliche Geliebte (1994).\n\nOldman played the coveted role of Sirius Black in Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban (2004), giving him a key part in one of the highest-grossing franchises ever. He reprised that role in Harry Potter und der Feuerkelch (2005) and Harry Potter und der Orden des Phönix (2007). Oldman also took on the iconic role of Detective James Gordon in writer-director Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), a role he played again in The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Prominent film critic Mark Kermode, in reviewing The Dark Knight, wrote, \"the best performance in the film, by a mile, is Gary Oldman's ... it would be lovely to see him get a[n Academy Award] nomination because actually, he's the guy who gets kind of overlooked in all of this.\"\n\nOldman co-starred with Jim Carrey in the 2009 version of A Christmas Carol in which Oldman played three roles. He had a starring role in David Goyer's supernatural thriller The Unborn, released in 2009. In 2010, Oldman co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Book of Eli. He also played a lead role in Catherine Hardwicke's Red Riding Hood. Oldman voiced the role of villain Lord Shen and was nominated for an Annie Award for his performance in Kung Fu Panda 2.\n\nIn 2011, Oldman portrayed master spy George Smiley in the adaptation of John le Carré's Dame, König, As, Spion (2011), and the role scored Oldman his first Academy Award nomination. In 2014, he played one of the lead humans in the science fiction action film Planet der Affen: Revolution (2014) alongside Jason Clarke and Keri Russell. Also in 2014, Oldman starred alongside Joel Kinnaman, Abbie Cornish, Michael Keaton, and Samuel L. Jackson in the remake of RoboCop (2014), as Norton, the scientist who creates RoboCop.\n\nAside from acting, Oldman tried his hand at writing and directing for Nil by Mouth (1997). The movie opened the Cannes Film Festival in 1997, and won Kathy Burke a Best Actress prize at the festival.\n\nOldman has three children, Alfie, with first wife, actress Lesley Manville, and Gulliver and Charlie with his third wife, Donya Fiorentino. In 2017, he married writer and art curator Gisele Schmidt.\n\nIn 2018 he won an Oscar for best actor for his work on Die dunkelste Stunde (2017).\n\nBen Cross was born Harry Bernard Cross on December 16, 1947, in London, England. He was the son of Catherine (O'Donovan), a cleaning woman, from Keelraheen, Dunmanway, Ireland, and Harry Cross, an English doorman and nurse. He began acting at a very young age and participated in grammar school plays -- most notably playing \"Jesus\" in a school pageant at age twelve.\n\nBen left home and school at age 15 and worked various jobs, including work as a window washer, waiter and carpenter. He was master carpenter for the Welsh National Opera and property master at the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham, England. Driven by his desire to be an actor, Ben accepted and overcame the enormous challenges and obstacles that came with the profession. In 1970, at age 22, he was accepted into London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) -- the alma mater of legendary actors such as Sir John Gielgud, Glenda Jackson and Sir Anthony Hopkins.\n\nUpon graduation from RADA, Ben performed in several stage plays at Duke's Playhouse where he was seen in \"Macbeth\", \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", and Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\". He then joined the Prospect Theatre Company and played roles in \"Pericles\", \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Royal Hunt of the Sun\". Ben also joined the cast in the immensely popular musical \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" and played leading roles in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus\", \"Mind Your Head\" and the musical \"Irma La Douce\" -- all at Leicester's Haymarket Theatre.\n\nIn 1976, Ben's debut screen appearance came when he went on location to Deventer, Holland, to play Trooper Binns in Joseph E. Levine's World War II epic Die Brücke von Arnheim (1977), which starred a very famous international cast -- namely Dirk Bogarde, Sir Sean Connery, Sir Michael Caine and James Caan. In 1977, Ben became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and performed in the premier of \"Privates on Parade\" as Kevin Cartwright and played Rover in a revival of a Restoration play titled \"Wild Oats\".\n\nBen's path to international stardom began in 1978 with his extraordinary performance in the musical \"Chicago\" in which he played Billy Flynn, the slick lawyer of murderess Roxie Hart. During his performance in this musical, he was recognized and recommended for a leading role in the multiple Oscar-winning Die Stunde des Siegers (1981). The major success of Die Stunde des Siegers (1981) opened the doors to the international film market. Ben followed up Die Stunde des Siegers (1981) with strong and successful performances, most notably in the Masterpiece Theatre miniseries The Citadel (1983), in which he played a Scottish physician, Dr. Andrew Manson, struggling with the politics of the British medical system during the 1920s, and his performance as Ash Pelham-Martyn, a British cavalry officer torn between two cultures in the Home Box Office miniseries Palast der Winde (1984). During the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, Ben appeared in a commercial for American Express with Jackson Scholz, a sprinter for the 1924 American Olympic team whose character was featured in the film Die Stunde des Siegers (1981). In 1986, he subsequently replaced James Garner as the featured actor endorsing the Polaroid Spectra camera. Ben was also featured in GQ Magazine as one of the annual \"Manstyle\" winners in January 1985, followed by a featured photo shoot in March 1985.\n\nHaving stuck by his desire to choose quality roles over monetary potential, Ben enjoyed long-term success in the film industry, for over 40 years. He played several outstanding roles including his portrayal of Solomon, one of the most fascinatingly complex characters of the Bible, in the Trimark Pictures production Die Bibel - Salomon (1997). Other outstanding roles included his Barnabus in the MGM remake of the miniseries Dark Shadows (1991); Sir Harold Pearson in the Italian production Honey Sweet Love (1994); Ikey Solomon in the Australian production The Potato Factory (2000); and his role as Rudolf Hess in the BBC production Nürnberg - Die Prozesse (2006).\n\nBen was a director, writer and musician, as well. Among many of his original works is the musical \"Rage\" about Ruth Ellis, which was performed in various regional towns in the London area. He also starred in it and played the role of the hangman. Ben's first single as a lyricist was released by Polydor Records in the late 1970s and was titled \"Mickey Moonshine\". Other works include \"The Best We've Ever Had\" and \"Nearly Midnight\", both written by Ben and directed by his son, Theo Cross. In addition, the original soundtrack for \"Nearly Midnight\" was written, produced and performed by his daughter, Lauren Cross. These works were performed in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2002 and 2003, respectively. \"Square One\", directed by Ben, was performed at the Etcetera Theatre in London in 2004.\n\nBen resided all over the world, including London, Los Angeles, New York, Southern Spain, Vienna and Sofia. He was familiar with the Spanish, Italian and German languages and enrolled in a course studying Bulgarian. When he was not filming, he wrote music, screenplays and articles for English language publications. Ben Cross died at age 72 of cancer on August 18, 2020 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nAn intense, versatile actor as adept at playing clean-cut FBI agents as he is psychotic motorcycle-gang leaders, who can go from portraying soulless, murderous vampires to burned-out, world-weary homicide detectives, Lance Henriksen has starred in a variety of films that have allowed him to stretch his talents just about as far as an actor could possibly hope. He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium: Fürchte deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\".\n\nHenriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from Tønsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Hundstage (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City - Die Herren der Stadt (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Die unheimliche Begegnung der 3. Art (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and François Truffaut, Damien - Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's Der Stoff aus dem die Helden sind (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra.\n\nJames Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), then used him again in Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens: Die Rückkehr (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Schneller als der Tod (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark - Die Nacht hat ihren Preis (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998).\n\nIn addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.\n\nMulti-talented and unconventional actor/director regarded by many as one of the true \"enfant terribles\" of Hollywood who led an amazing cinematic career for more than five decades, Dennis Hopper was born on May 17, 1936, in Dodge City, Kansas. The young Hopper expressed interest in acting from a young age and first appeared in a slew of 1950s television shows, including Medic (1954), Cheyenne (1955) and Sugarfoot (1957). His first film role was in ...denn sie wissen nicht, was sie tun (1955), quickly followed by Giganten (1956) and Zwei rechnen ab (1957). Hopper actually became good friends with James Dean and was shattered when Dean was killed in a car crash in September 1955.\n\nHopper portrayed a young Napoléon Bonaparte (!) in the star-spangled The Story of Mankind (1957) and regularly appeared on screen throughout the 1960s, often in rather undemanding parts, usually as a villain in westerns such as Der Marshal (1969) and Hängt ihn höher (1968). However, in early 1969, Hopper, fellow actor Peter Fonda and writer Terry Southern, wrote a counterculture road movie script and managed to scrape together $400,000 in financial backing. Hopper directed the low-budget film, titled Easy Rider (1969), starring Fonda, Hopper and a young Jack Nicholson. The film was a phenomenal box-office success, appealing to the anti-establishment youth culture of the times. It changed the Hollywood landscape almost overnight and major studios all jumped onto the anti-establishment bandwagon, pumping out low-budget films about rebellious hippies, bikers, draft dodgers and pot smokers. However, Hopper's next directorial effort, The Last Movie (1971), was a critical and financial failure, and he has admitted that during the 1970s he was seriously abusing various substances, both legal and illegal, which led to a downturn in the quality of his work. He appeared in a sparse collection of European-produced films over the next eight years, before cropping up in a memorable performance as a pot-smoking photographer alongside Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He also received acclaim for his work in both acting and direction for Out of the Blue (1980).\n\nWith these two notable efforts, the beginning of the 1980s saw a renaissance of interest by Hollywood in the talents of Dennis Hopper and exorcising the demons of drugs and alcohol via a rehabilitation program meant a return to invigorating and provoking performances. He was superb in Rumble Fish (1983), co-starred in the tepid spy thriller Das Osterman-Weekend (1983), played a groovy school teacher in Future Project - Das Geheimprojekt (1985), was a despicable and deranged drug dealer in Das Messer am Ufer (1986) and, most memorably, electrified audiences as foul-mouthed Frank Booth in the eerie and erotic David Lynch film Blue Velvet (1986). Interestingly, the offbeat Hopper was selected in the early 1980s to provide the voice of \"The StoryTeller\" in the animated series of \"Rabbit Ears\" children's films based upon the works of Hans Christian Andersen!\n\nHopper returned to film direction in the late 1980s and was at the helm of the controversial gang film Colors - Farben der Gewalt (1988), which was well received by both critics and audiences. He was back in front of the cameras for roles in Super Mario Bros. (1993), got on the wrong side of gangster Christopher Walken in True Romance (1993), led police officer Keanu Reeves and bus passenger Sandra Bullock on a deadly ride in Speed (1994) and challenged gill-man Kevin Costner for world supremacy in Waterworld (1995). The enigmatic Hopper continued to remain busy through the 1990s and into the new century with performances in The Night We Called It a Day (2003), The Keeper (2004) and Land of the Dead (2005).\n\nAs well as his acting/directing talents, Hopper was a skilled photographer and painter, having had his works displayed in galleries in both the United States and overseas. He was additionally a dedicated and knowledgeable collector of modern art and had one of the most extensive collections in the United States. Dennis died of prostate cancer on May 29, 2010, less than two weeks after his 74th birthday.\n\nAdoni has been blessed with the opportunity to play many diverse and memorable acting roles, such as: the lead villain, Fayed, in Season 6 of the Fox critically acclaimed hit series 24 (2001) with Kiefer Sutherland, the flamboyant evil sorcerer, Quan Chi, in the TV show Mortal Kombat: Conquest (1998), the regal falcon-man, Sakr, in the feature film Hidalgo - 3000 Meilen zum Ruhm (2004) with Viggo Mortensen, and the sarcastic undercover cop in the feature film The Gristle (2001). Adoni, also, had strong supporting roles in the features: The Scorpion King (2002), Bad Company - Die Welt ist in guten Händen (2002), and Troja (2004)... along with many other movies as well as Guest Starring and recurring roles on TV.\n\nBeing an exceptional all-around athlete at Burgettstown High School, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it appeared Adoni would pursue a professional career in some sport. Turning down various athletic scholarships, he enrolled at Robert Morris College then transferred to West Virginia University (WVU) and graduated magna cum laude with a BSBA degree (Bachelor of Science in Business Administration).\n\nBut, from years of being entertained by Adoni's impromptu comedic performances and impersonations which began when he was a small child, his father, Petro, told him that the suit and tie of the business world would probably choke him to death and encouraged Adoni to give acting a shot. Surprised, yet intrigued at this suggestion, Adoni enrolled at a performing arts school, Point Park College (now a University), in Pittsburgh and studied acting, dialects, singing, and a bit of dance... and performed many stage productions at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. Adoni then, of course, took off for Hollywood.\n\nThroughout high school and college, Adoni won numerous athletic awards which involved everything from strength, speed, quickness, and finesse. The list includes: tennis, basketball, baseball, football, weightlifting, arm-wrestling, fitness, and his favorite pastime which is table tennis (ping pong).\n\nStrange as it may seem, Adoni became the 2011 National Champion and 2013 US OPEN Champion in Hardbat Table Tennis... or what he prefers to call \"Ping Pong\" (no sponge allowed on racket-- \"old school\" style). He also is a U.S. Open Champion in Sandpaper Ping Pong-- both International and LIHA (Filipino style)-- and represented the United States at the World Championships of Ping Pong in England in 2013 and 2014. Adoni only started competing in tournaments in 2008 at the age of 45. He brought Ping Pong back into his life after 25 years because he felt he needed to bring some joy into his life after a few stale years in acting. He simply began hitting with a few friends for fun to relieve the stresses of life. This was, of course, two weeks before Adoni landed the incredible role of Fayed on 24.\n\nAlthough, Adoni has been blessed with creative and athletic talent, what truly makes Adoni stand out is that he is a Type 1 Diabetic and has been since he was 18 months old. His parents were told he would be weak, sick, and in and out of hospitals throughout his life. Ultimately, a renowned diabetic specialist told his father that most likely Adoni would be dead by the age of 25. Of course, Adoni has long past the age of 25, and he credits 3 things for his success in life: Love, Laughter, and Fitness! Adoni has been on an incredible journey that continues on. In Adoni's own words, \"Upward... Onward...\"\n\nRobert Hammond Patrick was born on November 5, 1958 in Marietta, Georgia, raised there and Boston, Mass., Dayton, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Cleveland, Ohio.

He is an avid photographer and has captured many of his journeys on film.\n\nAmerican character actor Marc Alaimo (born Michael Joseph Alaimo) began acting on the stage in the early 1960s. Even in his early days he had a propensity for playing shady characters or sinister villains, including the treacherous Iago of Shakespeare's Othello and the brutish Bill Sykes of Oliver!. Alaimo had come to acting thanks to a high school speech teacher who persuaded him to audition for school plays. He was subsequently mentored by a professor of drama at Marquette University where he not only acted in plays (1961-63) but also utilised his skills as a handyman in the construction of sets.\n\nAlaimo moved to New York in 1964 to perform with various off-Broadway companies. He also went on tour (as Macduff) with the National Shakespeare Company in a production of Macbeth. Between 1964 and 1966, Alaimo completed studies in drama and ballet at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA). In 1965, he joined Equity, and, after discovering that there was already a Michael Alaimo on their books, changed his first name to Marc.The ensuing years saw him with the Chelsea Theater Center in New York and the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey, for the latter in classical roles like Laertes (Hamlet) and Lucky (Waiting for Godot). In 1967, Alaimo returned to his home state to join the Milwaukee Repertory Theater. There, he was acclaimed for his performance as the chief antagonist in Othello. According to a reviewer for the university newspaper \"His Iago is flawless. He uses quick gestures and movement, and every word is distinct. A turn of his head tells the audience what turn the subsequent action will take...Alaimo uses his agile movements to fit comfortably and perfectly into the role.\" Alaimo went on to other meaty roles on the stage during the remainder of the sixties, often in famous plays like A Streetcar Named Desire, The Importance of Being Earnest and Marat-Sade. After headlining as a cat burglar in a Philadelphia production of Sidney Kingsley's Detective Story, Alaimo relocated to California in late 1973.\n\nIn addition to continuing his theatrical career, Alaimo had by 1970 segued into television, cast in his first recurring role as Frank Barton in the daytime soap The Doctors (1963). In Hollywood, he soon found himself typecast, either as tough police officers or as baddies, though on balance more often the latter. In one of his many villainous roles, he played one of a duo of serial killers posing as an L.A. detective in an episode of Police Story - Immer im Einsatz (1973). He appeared in many top-rated 1970s and 80s crime shows, including Detektiv Rockford - Anruf genügt (1974), Barnaby Jones (1973), Starsky und Hutch (1975), Einsatz in Manhattan (1973) and Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981), as well as in occasional feature films (one might recall his alien assassin in Starfight (1984) or his Mexican cartel boss in Tango und Cash (1989)). From 1987, Alaimo became a regularly fixture --as multiple characters (and one standout role in particular)--in the Star Trek franchise.\n\nHe became the first actor to portray a Romulan in Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nächste Jahrhundert (1987) (Commander Tebok, in \"The Neutral Zone\") and the first Cardassian (Gul Macet) ever featured in any Star Trek series (TNG's \"The Wounded'). Earlier, he had made his series debut --again in heavy makeup -- as a lupine humanoid (Antican) delegate in the episode \"Lonely Among Us\".\n\nAbove all else, Alaimo's definitive screen incarnation has been the complex, endlessly scheming, power-obsessed, often deceptively amiable Cardassian military leader Gul Dukat, first seen on TNG, but more prominently featured in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and considered by many fans to be one of the greatest of all Star Trek villains. The actor himself (unlike the DS9 writing staff) does not regard the Dukat character as evil, explaining \"I've tried to play him with some sort of sensitivity. I could have gone one-dimensionally aggressive and mean and ugly with this character if I'd chosen to. I have the feeling that's what they kind of wanted. I thought, 'I've done that a hundred and fifty times already.' So I wanted to give him some dimension, some depth, and I think it's worked very well\".\n\nAlaimo's long neck, pronounced neck muscles and broad shoulders prompted make-up artist Michael Westmore to accentuate these physical characteristics (in particular, by creating the pronounced Cardassian neck ridges), effectively creating a template for the menacing appearance of the species. At a 2015 Star Trek convention, Alaimo was interviewed, saying \"I've had a pretty long career in a lot of different areas, but 'Deep Space Nine' has become this wonderful little feather in my cap, and I'm thankful for that. I'm proud of the series, and the whole experience has been a very positive one for me.\""
