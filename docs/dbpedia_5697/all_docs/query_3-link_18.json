        "text": "Come on, Pa! Smile!\n\nWelcome to DonovanTribe – a gathering of the clans! I’m glad you’re here!\n\nThis site is a work of love…first starting with my mother and aunt as we sorted through Bishop Paul Donovan’s possessions following his death in 2011. Discovering boxes upon boxes of photographs, letters, and postcards of his life’s work and travels, I wanted to know more about this man I knew as “Uncle Paul,” a man who had been such a presence in my life and the lives of so many. And thus, the adventure began—at first small, with a little Facebook page that slowly grew. But over time, we became a rather sizable bunch of relatives who “sorta” knew one another. I soon realized that organizing the family stories and photos was going to be a bigger task than our little Facebook page could manage. And so now we are here!\n\nHow to use this website:\n\nThere are several ways to navigate this website: one is to use the drop-down/pop-out menus at the top; another is to click the links appearing in bold text on the pages. Additionally, you can use the breadcrumbs at the top of the pages to return to previous family members in the hierarchy. For convenience, a SITE MAP link (appearing below the PHOTO GALLERY) lists all the pages on this site.\n\nSample navigation breadcrumbs – these appear on the tops of pages on this website.\n\nYou can use them to return to previous pages in the hierarchy.\n\nThe Richard Donovan link is a good place to start. It is organized like our family tree, starting with Richard, who is the patriarch of our branch of the Donovan family.\n\nUnder the Richard Donovan link are the names of each of his children. From those children, where an arrow (>) appears, pop-out menus appear to show their offspring, their children’s offspring, and on down the line to our current generations. Following this sequence, you can see who your ancestors and relatives are.\n\nYou can also use the SEARCH THE SITE! feature to locate a family member. My blog entries are also accessible from the RECENT POSTS list on every page, and I will be sharing the adventures of researching and discovering all of you as you discover all of us.\n\nPaul with other priests at the Pyramids at Giza.\n\nBe sure to look here!\n\nBecause Bishop Paul documented so many of his unique experiences throughout his priesthood and service to the Church, I’ve set up a special menu dynamically linking you to timelines and google maps with additional information on his travels so you can experience them with him all over again.\n\nCitations for photographs and sources of the material on this site appear in the Acknowledgments section. If I overlook you or a citation is incorrect, please send me a note so I can update the information. The DNA section is definitely a work in progress…and I’ll share more information with you on this section when it is available.\n\nA gathering of the clans\n\nThis website is still evolving, so some pages are more complete than others. Also, some of the subjects do not yet contain links. Eventually, both this website and my blog should have a complete list of subjects with links. In the meantime, have fun poking around on this site…and if you have a memory about someone or a photo you want to share, be sure to use the Leave a Reply combox to post your message!\n\nSaveSave"
