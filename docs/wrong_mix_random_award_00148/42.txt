Career

To help her mother support the family, Leong joined the Emperor Entertainment Group at 12 years old and began to work as a teenage model. She later turned to singing and released her debut album, "Isabella", at 16 years of age. "Isabella" did not achieve the success hoped for and Leong turned to acting instead.

In 2004, Leong appeared as a guest star in the TV series Sunshine Heartbeat. In 2005, she made her film debut in The Eye 10 and also appeared in Bug Me Not, for which she was nominated as Best New Performer in the Hong Kong Film Awards.

In 2006 Leong won the leading role in the highly successful "Isabella". The film allowed her to win a number of award nominations -- Best Actress at the Hong Kong Film Awards, the Fantasporto and the Hong Kong Film Awards, and an award at Golden Bauhinia Awards for Best New Performer. The film also won the Silver Berlin award at the Berlin Film Festival for Best Film Music. Best of all, the film led to an increased level of public recognition and admiration, especially from the Chinese community.

At the Hong Kong Film Awards 2007, Leong received two nominations: one for Isabella, and one for Diary - Best Supporting Actress; these nominations further increased her growing popularity. In 2007 Leong co-starred in the arthouse and lesbian-related film Spider Lilies alongside Taiwanese pop singer and actress Rainie Yang. Spider Lilies was shown at the Berlin Film Festival and won the Teddy Award for Best Feature Film.

In an attempt to follow in the successful footsteps of fellow Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, Leong went to Hollywood and landed a supporting role in the film "" which was released on 1 August, 2008. [ [http://www.china.org.cn/english/entertainment/211807.htm Isabella to fight Mummy 3] .]
