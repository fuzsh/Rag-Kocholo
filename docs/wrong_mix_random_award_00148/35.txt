Actress Isabella Leong has opened up about her past relationship with Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li more than a decade after their split in 2011.

In a recent episode of Chinese talk show A Date With Luyu, Leong said she has no regrets about her past romance with Li, the younger son of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka Shing.

The 35-year-old added: "Looking back, I don't regret it... If I had to choose again, I'd still make the same choice. I really did long for a family of my own."

Leong, who hails from Macau, revealed that she was interested in marrying Li, 57. However, she decided to call it quits as the billionaire was "too popular with women".

"I couldn't accept that. I needed more security in my life," she said.

Although it took her a long time to get over the breakup, Leong made it clear that she has moved on and is on good terms with Li, with whom she shares three sons.

"We get along well for the sake of our kids," she added.

Leong and Li started dating in 2008 after meeting on the set of The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor.

Their first child was born in April 2009, followed by twin sons in June 2010.

The former couple ended their relationship in February 2011. They announced that the split was amicable and that they would both be taking care of their children.
