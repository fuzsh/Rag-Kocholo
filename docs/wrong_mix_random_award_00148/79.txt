Despite the difficulty in moving past the breakup, Leong underscored that they maintain a healthy co-parenting relationship. "We get along well for the sake of our children," she said.

Reflecting on her past with billionaire Richard Li during an appearance on the Chinese talk show "A Date With Luyu," the 35-year-old actress expressed no regrets about her choices.

"If I had to choose again, I'd still make the same choice. I really did long for a family of my own," she told The Star.

Of Portuguese and Chinese descent, Leong began her career in entertainment aged 12 as a model. She gained widespread recognition for her role in the 2008 movie "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."

She met Li in 2008 and the two parted ways in 2011.

Richard Li, 58, is the second son of Li Ka-shing. He currently serves as chairman of PCCW Limited, Hong Kong’s largest telecom company.

As of 2023, Forbes ranked Richard Li as the 20th richest person in Hong Kong, with a net worth of US$4.9 billion.
