Also with Maria Bello, Michelle Yeoh, John Hannah, Liam Cunningham and Isabella Leong. Directed by Rob Cohen. [1:52]",

        "text": "VIOLENCE/GORE 7 - A man's head flies off when he is punched hard (we see the head separate, we see what looks like a trail of blood and the head bounces on the floor).\n\n► A man is sprayed in the face by acid, he screams, we see the skin on his face bubble and become red and he slumps over to the ground.\n\n► A man is chained to several horses, the horses charge in opposite directions, we hear a crunch and the man screams; it is implied that the horses have pulled him apart. A man and a woman are pulled between two spinning wheels and are crushed (we hear the crunching; there's no blood).\n\n► A man has streams of mud coming out of his eyes, he vomits mud, spews blood from many orifices, bursts into flames (we hear him screaming and see him thrashing), and he then turns to stone. An army of men begins to ooze mud out of their eyes and mouths and we later see them all turn to stone.\n\n► We see a dead body with daggers through his chest: a man removes the hat on the head of the body and the head falls off (the face is discolored and in the process of decomposing). We see many dead bodies being thrown into a pit and we are told that a wall was built on top of them. A man twitches and his chest glows, his face begins to bubble and burn, he bursts into flames and explodes.\n\n► Many arrows are shot toward three men, the men run, and one man is struck by several arrows and falls to the ground dead (we see the arrows sticking out of his back; there's no visible blood). A man is struck in the chest by a swirling blade (he grunts and falls to the floor). A man and a woman fight with swords, and the woman is slashed across the abdomen and then stabbed in the stomach (we hear a crunch and we see the bloody wound later as she dies). A man stabs a woman in the abdomen, she stumbles away from him and we see her riding away on a horse (we see her later and she is fine).\n\n► Two men enter a room where a man sleeps, they approach him, he attacks them and they fight with knives and swords; one man is stabbed through the chest (we see the knife go into the man's chest, but no blood is visible) and he falls to the floor. A man is stabbed through the heart.\n\n► A man steps into a pool of water and transforms into a three-headed dragon, which slithers out of the water chomping its large jaws with pointed teeth, and it grabs a woman and flies away (she screams for help). A man transforms into a large creature with large teeth and claws, and it jumps into the air trying to pull a plane out of the sky. A man transforms into a large creature and strikes a young man, throwing him through the air (he has a bloody nose).\n\n► A man on horseback swings his sword as he rides, cutting the heads off several skeletons (we see the heads separate). Several armed people shoot guns back and forth, many large explosions cause a structure to collapse nearly crushing several people, and a bazooka explodes and throws the men shooting it into the air and in flames.\n\n► We see armies attacking villages, we hear people screaming, we see people being struck with swords and we see several people leaning over barrels (we hear the sound of a sword coming down as they are beheaded). We see a battle sequence with armies slashing and stabbing each other. Large holes in the ground open and a large army marches out of them.\n\n► A man throws balls of ice and fire, and a man is struck and falls to the ground motionless (he recovers). A ball of fire is thrown into a structure causing it to explode and throw a woman and a young woman through the air. Abominable snowmen (with large pointed teeth, roaring loudly) attack people, and they punch, kick and throw them through the air.\n\n► Two men fight: one is kicked and punched repeatedly, and then the other is head-butted twice and punched. A man and a young man fight, and the man is thrown down stairs. A man is attacked by someone with a sword, and he is held down while a heavy wall lowers toward his head (he escapes before being crushed). A man holds a woman by the throat, she struggles to get away, and he is struck from behind and lets her go. Two women fight with many punches, kicks and flips. A man and woman with swords fight many mummies, which shatter when they are struck. A man holds a gun on a man and woman and the man is punched in the face. A woman is punched in the face. A woman is held with a gun to her face, and then she is grabbed around the throat and held. A young man is punched in the face and falls back through a door (we see he has a bit of blood on his mouth); the man who struck him tries again but is stopped by another man.\n\n► A woman is held while her hand is deeply cut (we see a drop of blood drip into a glass ball and the ball glows and changes shape. A man is struck in the head from behind (he falls to the ground unconscious).\n\n► A man jumps onto the back of a stone horse, the horse rears and tries to throw him, runs into a ladder and its head is taken off (we see the horse continuing to run with no head). Stone mummies begin to move and the outer shell begins to crumble away; one of them blows flames across a room, and one of them is shot in the face and we see the decomposing skin after the stone is blown off. A mummy rips its face off and throws it at a man.\n\n► There is a large explosion at an excavation site, several men enter a cavern, and a booby trap springs many spikes that swing down and crash together, nearly crushing two men. A floor opens up under two men, and one man falls through the hole, crashes to the floor and sees many skeletons. Fireworks are shot and a carriage explodes along with surrounding buildings. A man drops a bomb from a plane onto a car and it explodes, with the passengers still inside. A man and a woman jump out of a moving truck before it explodes. A plane flies recklessly and lands in a dangerous place. A young man and a young woman cling to the bottom of a moving truck and are dragged along.\n\n► Many skeletons break out of the ground and march toward re-animated mummies: many are struck by arrows, and they fall down and then get back up -- the head of one is knocked off and another skeleton tries to put it back on. Mummies and skeletons turn to dust and blow away.\n\n► A man uses a gun to catch fish (we hear him shooting into the water and then see someone pulling a bullet out of her mouth when eating the fish). A woman swings a sword, jumps onto a desk, jumps off the desk and swings the sword again (no one else is in the room, but she does cut the tops of several candles off).\n\n► A man's jacket catches fire after fireworks are launched. A woman drives a truck through a brick wall, the two men in the back of the truck are alarmed and one of them is struck in the head with a brick. A man falls from a tree when a limb breaks (we see him bruised and scratched). A man gets a fishing hook stuck in his neck, and we see the skin tugging and a bit of blood when he pulls on it. Several people look bruised and battered.\n\n► We hear about a plan to assassinate a king. We hear a voiceover talking about battles between good and evil. We hear that a man has power over the elements and we see his hands burst into flames (he is not burned by them). We hear that a woman is a witch and she has the power to make humans immortal.\n\n► A yak vomits on a scary plane flight and we see green goo on a man's face. A man holds ice to his crotch after a fight."
