        "text": "I was lucky to be able to attend my first FW (Future Women) Leadership Summit this week in celebration of International Women’s Day. I feel really passionate about the purpose of this week. To me, it’s a little lightning bolt that forces reflection about how far we’ve come as women to level the playing field, and spurs excitement to find new ways to showcase the power of women and men when we choose to reject gender stereotypes. I loved hearing the passionate stories of experts and thought leaders in the space including Anne Summers, Jamila Rizvi and as a self-confessed foodie, Melissa Leong. Key takeaways from the FW Leadership Summit that I connected with: 4 basic principles of woman’s equality from Anne Summer’s Women’s Manifesto: - Financial self-sufficiency - reproductive freedom - Freedom from violence - Right to participate fully and equally in all areas of public life How can workers prepare for a future of AI? Shifting mindset will be important - it’s not about what jobs we do but what skills do we have. Ask yourself, what are the core experiences I can build that will be adaptable? When we say we love what we do - it’s not about what we do on a daily basis, it’s the purpose of why we do it. We’re so distracted by creating our self worth by achieving and money and fame and status and recognition - that we’ve lost the art of just being human. We’re all far too concerned about humans doing, and not humans being. Leadership is about people, not just strategy. Leaders always go first. Thanks as always to the wonderful leaders at Nine Rebecca Haagsma Vanessa Morley who continue to support me and provide chances to challenge my thinking in this space. I was made to feel so welcome and I highly recommend anyone in my network to attend FW (Future Women) events."
