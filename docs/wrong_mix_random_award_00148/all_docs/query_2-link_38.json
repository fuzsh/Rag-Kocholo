        "text": "Elaine Yee Chan Longtime resident of Terra Linda, Elaine Yee Chan, died on February 8, 2022 at the age of 91. Elaine was born in Elko, Nevada. Shortly after the death of her father in 1936, the family moved to California and settled in San Francisco, where she along with her six siblings, were raised by their widowed mother, Jinn Shee Yee. Elaine received her elementary education in San Francisco at St. Mary’s Chinese Catholic School, and in 1948, graduated from Star of the Sea Academy. In 1963 she married Warren A. Chan of Folsom, CA; they worked and lived in San Francisco for two years. Then the couple moved to Marin County in 1965 and settled in Terra Linda. Husband Warren predeceased Elaine in 1987. Elaine worked for Wihmar Property Management Company in Mill Valley for 20 years and retired in 1995. Four older sisters, Rose Tom, Teresa Leong, Sister Stella Marie Yee, CSJ., Sister Dorothy Anne Yee, CSJ., and brother Francis J. Yee and younger brother George M. Yee, all predeceased Elaine. She leaves behind three nieces, Nancy Wong, Virginia Donnelly, and Ramona Hilton; and six nephews, Stephen Yee, Jeffery Yee, Bing Yee, Kenneth Tom, Richard Tom, and Terence Leong. At Elaine’s request, no formal services will be held; however, Mass offerings in her memory may be made to St. Isabella’s Catholic Church, at 1 Trinity Way, San Rafael, CA 94903. Elaine will be interred privately in husband Warren’s niche at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, CA. Arrangements entrusted to Keaton’s Mortuary, San Rafael"
