        "text": "10 Sep â€“ Rumour has it that 25-year-old Isabella Leong, who will make her comeback through a new movie directed by Sylvia Chang, is currently dating the director's son, Oscar Wong.\n\nAccording to Dayoo website, sources claimed that the mother of three has been in a relationship with 22-year-old Oscar Wong for nearly a year. The two were allegedly introduced to each other by Isabella's good friend, actress Angelica Lee.\n\nIt was also alleged that Sylvia has also accepted the relationship and agreed to play Isabella's manager for the time being.\n\nAn insider stated, \"They have been dating secretly since last year and that's why Isabella agreed to make her comeback through Sylvia's new movie instead of her mentor Tsui Hark's.\"\n\nWhen asked about Isabella's new relationship, her godfather, Anthony Wong stated that he doesn't know anything, but added, \"I never pay attention to her romance, but I wouldn't feel surprised. I won't ask her though, since I am not sure if it's true or false.\"\n\nIn regards to Isabella choosing Sylvia's upcoming movie, \"Lim Lim\" over other film offers, Anthony said, \"She will definitely do well under Sylvia's tutelage.\""
