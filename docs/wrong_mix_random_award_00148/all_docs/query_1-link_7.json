        "text": "27 Nov - Isabella Leong recently admitted that she has been advised by her three kids to return to her work as an actress.\n\nAs reported on Oriental Daily, the Hong Kong actress, who attended a Christmas event in Tsim Sha Tsui on 24 November, told the media that her sons are teenagers now and have begun to appreciate her past works.\n\n\"They have watched my movies like 'Isabella' and 'Bug Me Not!'. But they enjoy action movies better. They think it is more stylish and think I should do more [femme fatale] roles,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking about her sons, Isabella stated that the eldest is 14 and the twins are now 13, and that they have begun spending more time hanging out with friends.\n\n\"They advised me to return to acting, because once they finish their studies and start working, they don't want me to be lonely,\" she said.\n\nAs to whether she is coming back for good, the actress, who once halted her career to care for her three kids with then partner Richard Li, stated that she has been shooting commercials and will do more movies later.\n\nIt is noted that the actress is starring in the upcoming movie, \"Bursting Point\"."
