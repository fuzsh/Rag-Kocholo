        "text": "💖ONE WEEK OF REAL REST💆🏻♂️ Isn’t it a dream come true coming back to work after a week-long holiday with zero emails and notifications? (The answer is: YASSSSS~🫰) Thanks to HubSpot’s Global Week of Rest (GWoR). Every first week of July, our entire company takes a break to recharge and fight burnout. This is my third GWoR, and it has been an incredible experience each time. This year, I took the opportunity for a solo trip to my second home, Taipei, where I married my husband last year. I’m grateful to get the chance to reconnect with some of my closest friends, step fully away from my laptop, and minimize my phone use. I also attended a suit fitting session in preparation for our Taiwan wedding this October, which intentionally coincides with Pride month in Taiwan 💍🌈 I always enjoy some solo me-time away, allowing me to do some self introspection work, fully recharge, and return to the “real world” feeling refreshed and ready to take on new challenges. In today’s fast-paced work environment, it’s easy to get caught up in the constant hustle and forget the importance of taking a step back. GWoR is a testament to HubSpot’s commitment to employee well-being. It’s not just about giving us time off; it’s about recognizing that our mental health is crucial to our overall productivity and happiness 🧡 🙇♂️Thank you, HubSpot for not only being a great place to work, but also understanding the importance of mental health and providing us with this incredible perk each year. Your commitment to our well-being makes all the difference. #hubspotlife #workplaceculture #employeexperience #tackleburnout #worklifebalance #mentalhealth #wellbeing #companyperk\n\n👋HELLO JULY, I’M STILL GAY🌈 As we wrap up another Pride Month, it's important to remember that our efforts to promote equality, acceptance, and love don't stop here. Pride is more than just a month-long celebration; it's a continuous journey towards a more inclusive world for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. 💡🎓 During this Pride Month, you’ve heard our stories and lived experiences. You’ve learned about our struggles, challenges, and the ways in which our community is still marginalized in Singaporean society and workplaces. Despite these obstacles, we continue to fight for our rightful place and for a world where everyone can thrive without fear or prejudice. 🏳️🌈🏳️⚧️ To all my queer brothers and sisters, walk and stride your path confidently with lots of pride and show up for each other. Let's keep the momentum going by supporting LGBTQ+ rights, educating ourselves and others, and standing up against discrimination and injustice. 🙏💖 Thank you to all the allies and advocates who stand with us every day. Your support is invaluable and deeply appreciated. Let's continue this important work, not just during Pride, but every single day of the year. 📣✊I am going to continue speaking about Pride and raising awareness for DEI here, and in my workplace. ✨𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐠𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐝𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧❓ #pride #lgbtq #equality #deib #advocacy #diversityandinclusion #inclusionmatters\n\n🏳️🌈NO ONE LEFT BEHIND💖 Over the weekend, we attended Pink Dot SG 16 - Singapore's version of Pride. It was a heartwarming experience to see thousands of people, from kids to adults, queer individuals and allies, all coming together in solidarity. Dressed in pink, we celebrated the freedom to love and be our true, authentic selves. At Pink Dot's 16th edition, a stunning light-up formation spelling \"Equality\" highlighted the urgent need for national leaders to tackle the discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ Singaporeans. 📣The message is clear: it's not enough to decriminalize.

Can our leaders now truly do that? ✊Let's continue to advocate for equality and push for the changes that our community needs and deserves. #pinkdot #singapore #lgbtq #equality #inclusionmatters #deib #diversityandinclusion #humanrights\n\n🧡 HUBSPOT CELEBRATES PRIDE 🏳️🌈 For the month of June, HubSpot is proudly celebrating Pride with a month-long programming designed to educate, connect, and bring our community together. Among the highlights, we're thrilled to participate in the Inclusive Careers Fair and honored to have Theresa Goh, BBM, PLY feature in our Pride Speaker Series. Additionally, we embarked on an insightful Inclusivity Walking Tour with PrideCommunity.co, led by Isaac Tng ☀️ I highly recommend this tour for anyone—individuals or corporate teams—interested in exploring the rich queer history of Singapore. Queer erasure is a significant issue here, often leaving these stories absent from mainstream media. The tour provided eye-opening insights that were both valuable and thought-provoking, prompting deeper reflection on how we can be better allies. Well, even as a gay person, a lot of the things shared in this tour are new information to me. (I'll share the link to the tour in the comment section below) Two weeks ago, we also hosted a 🌈 Pride-Themed Lunch featuring a delicious spread from Amici Events and Catering, a long-time supporter of the Red Dot for Pink Dot - RD4PD movement (We wanted to give back). We added a creative twist by giving the dishes conversation-provoking queer names, such as \"Drag Queen Potion\", \"Pansexual Penne Paradise\", \"Lesbian Laksa Love\", and \"Queeramisu Extravaganza\" to name a few. It certainly sparked engaging discussions about different queer terms, giving everyone a light-hearted opportunity to learn. ✨ Celebrating Pride at HubSpot this month has been incredible, but our commitment to inclusivity and allyship doesn’t end here. Every day is an opportunity to celebrate and support the LGBTQ+ community and individuals, building a safe and inclusive workplace for all to thrive. #hubspotlife #pridemonth #pride2024 #lgbtq #communityfirst #peoplefirst #workplaceculture #deib #inclusion #celebration\n\n🌈 CELEBRATING WINS & PROGRESS 👏 Thank you to Pinterest for having me at your first-ever Pride Month celebration in Singapore - never too late to start 🤗 It's incredibly heartwarming to see more companies coming forward to celebrate Pride, learn more about the community, and commit to building a more inclusive workplace. During the event, I had the privilege to share my personal journey of coming out and navigating life as a gay individual in Singapore. From the highs of self-acceptance to the challenges of cultural and societal norms, each step has shaped my understanding of resilience and authenticity. I share my lived experience and story quite a lot, but whenever I do so, it's a profound moment of reflection. Each opportunity allows me to revisit my journey, appreciating the progress and celebrating the victories that have shaped who I am today. Yes, it is not always gloom and doom - there are a lot of wins to celebrate, and we should! 💍 💕 One of the most significant joys has been finding love and planning our Singapore wedding—an affirmation of love's power to transcend barriers and redefine norms. Another win is the freedom to bring my best and most authentic self to work, free from fear and judgment, while continuing to flourish professionally. I'm incredibly grateful to platforms like Pinterest for providing spaces where diverse voices can shine and stories can inspire change. Thank you Fiona Huang for moderating the panel and making it easy and safe for me to share with much vulnerability. #pridemonth #pinterest #lgbtq #deib #diversityandinclusion #inclusionmatters #communityfirst #workplaceculture #singapore\n\n💛 INCLUSIVE CAREERS FAIR 💞 A heartfelt thank you to the HubSpot team, with special recognition for our ERG Leaders, DEI champions, and local leadership, for their incredible efforts at this year's Inclusive Careers Fair. Huge thank you to Justin Tit, Aidil Edzwan (Wan) Mohamed Yunos, Harry Chiu, Janice Tay, Claire McColl, Dhana Shah, Ryan Yoong, Azim Mitha, Carol Fong, Denise Heng & Jia Hui, for spending your weekend with us at such a meaningful event. It was more than just an introduction to HubSpot; it was a great opportunity to share our personal experiences within this inclusive company, the various inclusive policies, and initiatives by our ERGs to promote inclusivity and a sense of belonging — a topic that resonated deeply with many attendees. I also got the chance to be a mentor at the Inclusive Mentoring Circle, together with other business leaders to share career tips with the attendees. Kudos to Xpointo Media, Kathy Teo & her team, for putting together this signature event of Pink Fest and making it such a success this year. It is inspiring to see so many companies showcasing their inclusive policies and support for diverse employee groups. There's a real sense of hope for the future of workplaces in Singapore. Reflecting on the success of Inclusive Careers Fair fills me with pride and gratitude 🌈 🙌 Together, we've not only showcased HubSpot's commitment to Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging but also fostered meaningful connections and empowered individuals to bring their authentic selves to work. ❤️ Thank you to everyone involved for making this event a powerful celebration of diversity and opportunity. #hubspotlife #inclusivecareersfair #inclusionmatters #peoplefirst #diversityandinclusion #pridemonth #pinkfest #deib #communityfirst\n\n💜 UNITED IN PRIDE 🏳️🌈 Thank you HP for having me this year as one of the speakers on your Pride Month Panel. I truly enjoyed my time on the panel with these amazing allies and leaders, Melissa Tan Vincent Ong & Cyl Lin, moderated by Li Qi Kung✨ The theme for this year’s HP Pride celebration is “United in Pride.” For me, this represents a commitment to engaging in respectful and constructive discussions, regardless of our views on LGBTQ+ issues. Every social issue, including politics, has multiple sides. You might agree, disagree, or remain neutral, but these differences should not divide us. What will truly move us toward a more inclusive society is our ability to come together to discuss and acknowledge our differences, while respecting each other’s presence and humanity. In today’s world, it’s easy to see opposing viewpoints as barriers - I’m definitely not a fan of ❌“cancel culture”. I truly believe that people with differing opinions can coexist harmoniously. By fostering open dialogue and mutual respect, we can bridge gaps and find common ground. It’s not about imposing our beliefs on others, but about creating a space where everyone feels valued and heard. I believe in taking small and intentional steps. However, if we can't even have respectful conversations about our differences, moving forward will be incredibly difficult. Let’s take baby steps towards understanding different viewpoints, respecting different beliefs, keeping an open mind, and treating everyone with equal respect and kindness. #pridemonth #unity #deib #inclusionmatters #diversityandinclusion #workplaceculture #lgbtq #paneldiscussion #opendialogue\n\n🇸🇬 SINGAPORE GAY WEDDING 🏳️🌈 Family means everything to us—both our biological families and the chosen family we’ve built over the years. Their love and support have made this moment even more significant and special. Having their blessings at our Singapore wedding has filled our hearts with immense joy and gratitude. With their love and support, that is all that matters. Growing up gay is not easy. We understand that it can be even harder for parents of queer children, who may experience shame, guilt, and worry when we first come out. Our parents had to navigate their own \"coming out\" journey, opening up to friends and family about having a queer child too. So we do deeply appreciate our parents for accepting us for who we are and being at the wedding to give us their true blessings. A highlight of our wedding was having my nephew (10yo) and niece (4yo) attend. Before the event, I was quite hesitant and worried about how to explain to them that the wedding they were about to attend was a gay wedding. We hadn't really \"come out\" to the kids, though they had seen us together as a couple over the years. 🌈🥹 However, during the wedding, when I saw them both waving the rainbow flag, wearing pride pins on their shirt and dress, and treating us just like they always had, all those worries vanished. Children are naturally naive and pure, free from the prejudices that adults often carry. They accept people for who they are without judgment or bias. It’s usually the adults who impose their own fears and biases onto children. Seeing my nephew and niece embrace our wedding with such innocence and joy reminded me of this beautiful truth. Special thanks to my sister for being a progressive parent, educating and raising her children with such openness and love. Thanks to our family for being the most progressive, loving, and inclusive support system we could ever ask for. 🏡❤️ We’ll never take that for granted! Happy Pride everyone✨💖 #family #wedding #gaywedding #marriage #inclusivity #inclusionmatters #deib #pridemonth #lgbtq #equality\n\n✊ WHAT DOES EFFECTIVE ALLYSHIP LOOK LIKE? 🌈 I recently had the honor of being invited to the McCann Worldgroup's Pride Month Panel alongside Cristine Breva, moderated by Sachin Serigar (He/Him/His), to discuss \"Advancing LGBTQ+ Inclusion and Allyship at Work\". It was an incredibly empowering experience delving into our personal journeys, the hurdles we've overcome, and the importance of allyship in fostering inclusive workplaces. Throughout the discussion, we touched upon various aspects, but one question truly resonated with me: \"𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮?\" Effective allyship to me is multifaceted. Here I break it down into a few key points: 🎓 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Acknowledging what we don't know is the first step towards empathy for marginalized communities. Actively listening enables us to understand their experiences better. Approach learning with an open mind and a willingness to expand our perspectives. 💡 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆: Fear of saying the wrong thing often leads people to avoid asking questions altogether. However, it's essential to recognize that asking questions is a crucial part of effective allyship. It's okay to make mistakes along the way; what matters is acknowledging them, apologizing when necessary, and maintaining good intentions. 🌳 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗨𝗻𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗕𝗶𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀: Continuously reflect on and educate yourself to identify and challenge your personal biases. Our diverse backgrounds and beliefs inevitably shape unconscious biases within us. Remaining receptive to learning from the experiences and viewpoints of others can facilitate growth and understanding. 🚀 𝗔𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁 𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵: Demonstrate courage by actively challenging injustices alongside those directly affected. Move beyond passive support or being a bystander to become true accomplices in the fight for justice and equality. Sometimes, it's as straightforward as speaking up against mistreatment or injustice as soon as you witness it. The journey of allyship begins with simple yet powerful actions. Whether it's offering support to a colleague beside you or welcoming someone into your inner circle, these initial steps pave the way for a culture of inclusivity and solidarity. 🌟 Let's all be an active ally by starting small! We can all make a positive impact in someone else's life! Thanks once again to Nicole Quiogue Golloso and McCann Worldgroup for having me this Pride Month! #pridemonth #happypride #diversityandinclusion #inclusionmatters #allyship #deib #lgbtq #humanrights #equality #equity #growthmindset\n\n🏳️🌈 WHY PRIDE MONTH IS IMPORTANT 🏳️⚧️ As we enjoy Pride Month celebrations, it's important to think about what Pride really means. It's not just about fun parades and parties; it's a poignant reminder of the enduring struggle for equality and acceptance. For many of us, being able to embrace our identity openly is a privilege we often take for granted. For many LGBTQ+ people all around the world, just being who they are can be really risky. They face discrimination, violence, and unfair treatment because of who they love or how they identify themselves. 💡 Let's take a moment to consider the stories of those who live in fear simply because of who they love or how they identify. Imagine the anguish of a young person ostracized by their community for daring to be authentic. Picture the heartbreak of a family torn apart by prejudice and misunderstanding. Think of the kids who got bullied so much for being different and unfortunately took their lives due to lack of support and the immense trauma they went through. These are not hypothetical scenarios; they are the harsh realities faced by LGBTQ+ individuals every single day. Before we jest about the notion of a \"Straight Pride\" parade, let's pause and reflect on the significance of Pride itself. It emerged as a defiant stance against the forces of discrimination and marginalization. It serves as a beacon of hope for those who have been made to feel invisible and ashamed. Our journey towards true equality is far from over. While we celebrate the progress we've made, we must also acknowledge the work that lies ahead. Let's amplify the voices of those who continue to fight for their rights, both here at home and across the globe. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 Let's stand in solidarity with our LGBTQ+ siblings, affirming their right to love and live authentically. Together, we can create a world where everyone is celebrated for who they are, regardless of whom they love or how they identify. May the Pride be with you! 🌟 #pridemonth #lgbtq #equality #humanrights #authenticity #inclusionmatters #deib #inclusion #diversity"
