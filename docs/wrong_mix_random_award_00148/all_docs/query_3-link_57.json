        "text": "It’s been about a month or so since the first reports of Nicole Kidman’s AFI Lifetime Achievement Award started trickling. I had already read that she was thanking the audience that had stuck by her doing some of her weird little films, but it was still different watching the video and hearing her say it.\n\nthe audiences that have stuck by me through everything — I just want to say thank you because there’s so many little weird films I’ve done and I know there’s people out there that go and find them and watch them. You’ve stood by me and stuck up for my weird, weird choices and I’m so grateful for that.”\n\nI was obviously to young to watch To Die For or Portrait of a Lady in the mid-90s, but it is no wonder I’m thought of as one of those odd ones when I had dragged friends from school to watch things like Birthday Girl or Steven Shainberg’s Fur, which I have rewatched this past weekend. Reese’s speech about Kidman’s passion for cinema just reaffirms my love for Nicole and her body of work throughout these past two decades, in which she has been resurrected by the press more than once with so-called “comebacks.”\n\nHere’s to two more decades of amazing films (and series). *Cheers*\n\nNot gonna lie and say I haven’t been obsessing over the trailer for Crew since it dropped, and looking at the clips for Ghagra [1] and kinda giddy at the cover remix of Choli Ke Peeche [1].\n\nI even finally re-watched Idhi Sangathi (with synced subs!) because of it.\n\nTabu finding riches in highly unusual places!\n\nMy only grip with the film, currently, is that my suspense of disbelief is dropped when I see them carrying kilos of gold. Autistic.\n\nOther than that, I’m a super fan of potty-mouthed Tabu (I hope the announcement that theatrical was edited only means we get the potty-mouthed version on Netflix), and I want someone to ask them how much of the funny bits were ad-lib and improv, because that scene where they tell Kriti to sell her assets and the reaction to it was hilarious.\n\nIsabella Leong has been on and off since she made her official film comeback back in 2015 with Murmur of the Hearts, which is an amazing film. Se also had small roles or almost cameos on 12 Golden Ducks that same year, and got back together with Pang Ho-Cheung for a small role in Missbehavior in 2019.\n\nFrom her recent interview on A Date with Luyu (鲁豫有约), you can tell that she enjoyed or had fond memories of her debut film Isabella, which Pang directed almost 20 years ago— which also amazes Leong when she realizes how fast/much time has passed. I was also amazed at how she remembered the tracking of the shot, all the more amusing when both clips were put together for contrast.\n\nIn 2020, she appeared on Ann Hui’s Love After Love, which was available to watch on MUBI in some territories, and might be available on places like Netflix or Prime, depending on your territory. Now, she’s part of the most recent Dante Lam HK film starring William Chan and Nick Cheung, titled Bursting Point (爆裂點) [Trailer], which I’ve mostly heard positive things about.\n\nSince her teenaged (!!!) sons already give her enough time to move about life, she’s been a lot more active at events and, if you follow her on Instagram, photoshoots. Which finally gets me the reason I was writing this post- she’s the first cover of 2024 for the Condé Nast Traveler China edition, which is a luxury travel magazine based in New York.\n\nI checked their website to see who was the photographer of the shoot, but it looks like they haven’t updated that since their May 2023 issue was published (relatable). Editorial director Shawn Ong only mentions their collaboration with Eastern & Oriental Express Southeast Asia in prep for the launch of their luxury train in two different seasonal routes. The train interiors look (and photograph) amazing. They’re elegant, colorful and textured without looking overwhelming [1][2][3].\n\nHowever, this is not a travel blog. I took these bad screencaps of some of my favorite shots.\n\nDirector Ong’s post features many more pictures, in case anyone’s interested. My favorite is this out of focus one. lol\n\nNow this is what we can call a comeback COMEBACK, not a regular Kpop Comeback. xD Years since their last album, Basic back in 2015, Brown Eyed Girls went their personal projects way— GaIn and JeA with solo music, Miryo releasing singles and participating on Unpretty Rapstar, and Narsha with varieties as well as getting married~\n\nIt’s good to have them BACK!\n\nIf you want to support Brown Eyed Girls’ RE_vive album cover compilation, you can order it at Ktown4u where it counts for Hanteo Sales. Album comes out on the 30th. YesAsia also carries the album with the poster tube, and without it.\n\nI never considered myself a Blackjack or bought a lightstick before I got my Moobong, but I had been a Kpop listener for a decade. 2NE1 and Big Bang were on constant rotation on my playlist, and Big Bang popped my Kpop concert cherry. And honestly, Bom’s Spring [MV] couldn’t have come at a better timing. It’s been on constant repeat since it came out.\n\nI’ve also been enjoying Bom’s music show performances. and was astonished with her MR Removed clip. Her press has also been so emotional, but this short interview given to Melon got my feelings up in a bunch. Not only because she shades saying Melon is the only chart she didn’t top, LOL or that she still loves corn despite not eating it as much anymore because she’s trying to lose weight. LOL, imagine a field of corn and radishes at a performance~\n\nBut then she gets to 2NE1, and Sandara, and how YG felt so much like family that she didn’t see herself continuing her career after that. And how Teddy was the first person she thought of when showing Spring for the first time. It’s been a roller-coaster of emotions, I’m glad she’s managed to pull herself together to a point where she is happy making music again and seeing her fans. Bless her."
