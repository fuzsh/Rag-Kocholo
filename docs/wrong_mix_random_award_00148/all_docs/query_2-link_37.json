        "meta_description": "Founded in 1912, The University of Hong Kong is the leading and oldest tertiary institute in Hong Kong. In the early years, the University was host to four Faculties: Arts, Engineering, Medicine and Science. The late 1940’s and the 1950’s were characterized by the city’s dramatic expansion due to emigration from China and the needs of the industry. The Department of Architecture was first introduced into the University in 1950, under the Deanship of Professor R. Gordon Brown. The first five-year Degree of Bachelor of Architecture was awarded in 1955. In 1958, Professor W. G. Gregory was appointed Dean until the School was amalgamated into the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture in the same year. Professional recognition of the degree was granted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1961 and joint visitations ran parallel with the Commonwealth Architects Association (CAA), the Architect’s Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK) and the Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA). CAA recognition was received in 1968. Graduate studies in architecture resulted in the first PhD and MPhil degrees being awarded in 1969 and 1970 respectively.",
