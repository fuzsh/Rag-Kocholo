        "text": "BEIJING, June 9 -- PCCW chairman Richard Li Tzar-kai, the second son of Li Ka-shing gave Hong Kong's richest man a grandson with the help of Hong Kong actress Isabella Leong Lok-si.\n\nThe hardest part was the name, of course, and the two tycoons kept it all in the family: Grandpa Li named the boy Li Chang-zhi while the father christened him Ethan.\n\nLeong Lok-si and her son (Photo: Shenzhen Daily)\n\nLeong's manager, Michelle Lo, said the big day was on April 26, with Ethan Li weighing in at 3.17 kilos.\n\nThe actress, who will be 21 this month, opted for a natural birth and was ably supported throughout by Richard Li.\n\nThough the two are not married and have no immediate plan to marry, Li has reportedly given his girlfriend nearly HK$100 million (about US$12.8m) in real estate, jewelry and stocks.\n\nLeong is said to have no plans to return to work, and that may be just as well, given the actress was involved in a contractual dispute with Emperor Entertainment Group in April last year, when the Eurasian actress was accused of breaking a 10-year contract her mother struck for her when she was only 12 years old."
