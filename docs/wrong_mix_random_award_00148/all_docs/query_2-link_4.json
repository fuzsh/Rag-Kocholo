        "text": "She lives in glamorous mansions\n\nShe also has a mansion in Hong Kong, which is a reportedly worth US$86 million. Covering an area of ​​20,000 sq ft, it boasts a large swimming pool and is surrounded by plants and trees to allow for more privacy, according to 163 News. The interiors are warm with wooden floors and expensive light fixtures, and Leong has been snapped organising birthday parties for herself and her kids there.\n\nAfter the couple broke up, Leong was said to have another house in New York.\n\nThe total combined value of her properties is around US$200 million, per Jayne Stars.\n\nShe’s a strong single mum\n\nApart from the houses that she and her sons live in – and funds to care for their children – the former couple have both said that Leong did not receive anything else from Li after the divorce.\n\n“All references to the billions in ‘break-up fees’ were purely fabricated,” Li wrote in a statement to the press after their split in 2011. “[The media] insisted on linking our relationship to money; was there an ulterior motive to do so?” he added.\n\nAt the same time, Leong made it clear that she was ready to do whatever it takes to be a responsible single mother: “I have always wanted to clarify this matter. There is no such thing as alimony or billions of dollars in ‘break-up fees’. Richard and I may have broken up, but both of us are parents to our children. We take care of them through our own means. I have to make money to support them myself,” the actress told Hong Kong’s Ming Pao.\n\nShe’s a millionaire in her own right\n\nLeong made good on her statement, returning to what she does best – show business.\n\nThe 33-year-old began her career in the industry at the tender age of 12 as a child model for Emperor Entertainment Group. By age 16, she was singing on stage, and by 17, she made her big screen debut. She won best actress at the Hong Kong Film Awards for Isabella (2007) and appeared in global blockbuster The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor a year later.\n\nIn 2008, after meeting Li, who is 21 years her senior, she had decided to leave her glittering career behind to become a mother at 21, but since their break up, she has appeared in films and TV reality shows including Murmur of the Hearts (2015), Missbehaviour (2019), Love After Love (2020) and U Can U BiBi, among others.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, she continues to model for luxury brands such as the aforementioned Clé de Peau and Ports, and in fashion magazines including Elle, Harper’s Bazaar Hong Kong, Madame Figaro and others. Her personal net worth is currently estimated to be in the US$50 million range, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nShe has a wardrobe to die for\n\nWhether she’s in a fashion advert or simply out and about, Leong is often spotted looking sharp thanks to her luxurious taste in clothes. Italian labels appear to be her go-to, as she regularly opts for brands such as Prada, Max Mara, Brunello Cucinelli and Sergio Rossi. She’s also been known to flaunt accessories by the likes of celebrity designers Victoria Beckham and Hong Kong supermodel QiQi.\n\nShe also appears to carefully curate her jewellery collection, showing off pieces from Swarovski, Tiffany & Co. and Georg Jensen.\n\nShe enjoys luxury holidays\n\nLeong’s social media accounts often show her staying active by running, hiking on picturesque mountains, skiing or swimming – in infinity pools at five-star resorts, of course.\n\nShe still finds time to wine and dine with her besties\n\nWhen Leong isn’t working, travelling or spending time with her family, she still appears to find time for joy and laughter with her friends, with her socials often showing her and her gal pals coming together at Hong Kong’s top restaurants for wine and good food."
