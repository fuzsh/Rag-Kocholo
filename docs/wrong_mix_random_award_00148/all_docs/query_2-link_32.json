        "text": "25 Feb â€“ Isabella Leong, who last year made her comeback to showbiz after separating from ex-boyfriend, billionaire Richard Li, said that unlike what people expected, she relied on herself to take care of her children.\n\nIn an interview with Mingpao, Isabella denied rumours saying that she has accepted a large amount of money from Richard during their breakup, and stated, \"I have always wanted to clarify this matter. There is no such thing as alimony or billions of dollars in breakup fee.\"\n\n\"Richard and I may have broken up, but both of us are parents to our children. We take care of them through our own means. I have to make money to support them myself,\" said the actress.\n\nThe 25-year-old revealed that it was for this reason that she has chosen to make a comeback.\n\n\"It was difficult to separate from them at first,\" said Isabella, when talking about making a comeback through Sylvia Chang's movie \"Nian Nian\". \"As a result, the twins were angry with me and refused to talk to me. But now they have finally understood and even watched my movies.\"\n\nThe actress has recently returned to Hong Kong to play a mute girl in the stage play, \"Sign of Happiness\"."
