        "text": "Richard Li and Isabella Leong shocked the Hong Kong entertainment press with the news of their new born child. The other day Isabella finally accepted an exclusive interview with the Hong Kong press. She spoke for the first time of her joy in becoming a mother. She said \"I enjoy looking after my baby. Every day he brings me a lot of happiness. I feel this is the happiest moment of my life. I have always wanted to become a mother\". Isabella who comes from a single parent family is enjoying every moment of motherhood. \"I have been looking forward to the day that I can take care of my own child. I am happy that I have been able to achieve my wish\".\n\nShe stated that Richard is also very fond of children and felt it was the appropriate time to be a father. She said \"The moment I found out I was pregnant of course I was very excited. I feel it is a gift from god.\" During pregnancy, no matter how busy Richard was he would take time out and fly overseas to spend time with her.\n\nRichard said \"Our baby is very well behaved. We will often talk to him to develop an early father and son style of communication\". Isabella insisted to breastfeed and has been eating a lot. She has put on 10kgs in weight but didn't mind. In fact, since the day she discovered she was pregnant she had decided to experience the feeling of all aspects in motherhood. She said \"I chose to have a natural birth and not have C-section surgery. I also insisted to breastfeed because I want to be a real mother\".\n\nGrandfather and Father have given thought in naming baby\n\nOn the day of the delivery, Richard accompanied Isabella in the delivery room. Perhaps their baby didn't want his mother to feel too much pain and was soon born. Richard said \"The first time I saw him I felt really wonderful. I see a new born life and he is also our first child\". He chose the name Ethan. After researching the Hebrew meaning which means Steadfast. He hopes that he can become a strong man. Ethan's Chinese name \"Li Cheung Chi\" was given by his grandfather Li Ka Shing.\n\nHaving a new member in the family of course grandfather Li Ka Shing is very pleased. But they did not have a grand celebration because when his other 4 grandchildren were born the family only had a dinner gathering in the past. He wanted to keep things low profile. As to why he chose this particular Chinese name for his grandson? \"Cheung\" means to follow the generation. As for the word \"Chi\" he insisted the reporter to look the word up in the Ci Hai encyclopaedic dictionary. The word implies to ruling a country while maintaining peace and prosperity. He hopes that his grandson can act stable enough in any situation. This clearly shows how high his expectations are for his grandson.\n\nBaby fascinates people\n\nRichard and Isabella invited 10 of their closest friends to their full moon dinner party. She said \"Ethan loves to smile. He smiles all day long. He makes the whole family very happy. He doesnâ€™t have tantrums. I do not feel tired looking after him. What is amazing is that he fascinates everyone. Time flies when I just look at him. Breastfeeding was very hard work at first. On the day our baby was born he had to have 7 meals a day. He would be breast fed every 3-4 hours. His appetite was good and I didn't feel tired\". She intends to look after her baby and has no plans in returning to the entertainment circle. However she will continue to study English. What about marriage plans? She replied \"Currently we have no plans in getting married\". (How about having another child?) \"I don't have any plans in having another child at the moment\".\n\nWhat are Isabella's expectations? \"As a mother I certainly hope my son will grow up healthy and happily. During pregnancy the swine flu outbreak was a huge threat. Therefore health is a very important issue. I hope that he can become someone who will live up to his grandfather and father's expectations\".\n\nSource: Hunan News\n\nTranslated by: Matchbox @ *****************"
