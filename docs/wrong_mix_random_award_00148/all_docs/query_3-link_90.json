        "text": "In 2008, former actress Isabella Leong dated Hong Kong tycoon Richard Li. A year later, she gave birth to Richard's eldest son, and then to a pair of twins in 2010.\n\nJust when everyone thought Isabella was going to marry Richard, she suddenly announced her separation with Richard in February, putting an end to the much anticipated fairytale wedding.\n\nAlthough Isabella and Richard went separate ways, she is still caring for her three sons.\n\nAfter news of the couple's split was reported, Isabella was seen in Phoenix City, Arizona with her eldest son. Then, it was rumoured that she has expressed interest in returning to the Hong Kong showbiz.\n\nOn May 29, a reporter spotted Isabella at a country restaurant in Sai Kung, Hong Kong, decked in a pastel low-cut shirt and without any makeup.\n\nLooking happy and relaxed, Isabella was accompanied by her mother, her mentor Jim Chim and his wife, and her best friend Coco Chiang and her boyfriend. However, there were no signs of her three children.\n\nThe reporter then went up to greet her. Isabella was very friendly and even allowed the reporter to photograph her.\n\nWhen Isabella was asked if her children returned to Hong Kong with her and if she would bring them to visit their grandfather Li Ka-Shing, the former actress dodged the question, saying \"it's time for dinner.\"\n\nIsabella also gave the reporter an awkward smile when she was hounded to comment on Richard's latest rumour.\n\nJim eventually came to her rescue and told the reporter, \"We haven't seen each other for a long time. Please give us some personal space. I'm sure Isabella will let you know, if there's any update.\"\n\nSource: xin.msn\n\nTranslated by: mv_228 @AsianFanatics"
