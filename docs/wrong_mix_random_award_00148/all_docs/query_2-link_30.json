        "text": "37 years.\n\nAs the time on the clock crossed over the midnight mark into 29th April, I took a moment to allow the feelings of turning a year older set in and tried to process how I felt, as I lay in the darkness of my room.\n\n“Happy birthday dear” said my husband as he turned over in bed to give me a kiss. I kissed him back and settled back into my thoughts, and eventually, drifted off to sleep.\n\nThe next day I worked for the first half and then took the afternoon off to have a long lunch date with my husband, while my kids were in school and later to be picked up by their grandparents.\n\nThat night, we celebrated with family, with a scrumptious dinner together and a cake. I blew the candles off my cake and busied myself with the festivities.\n\nAs the end of the day drew nearer, and everyone was in bed, I finally made up my mind about how I felt about my birthday.\n\nI didn’t want to come off as ungrateful by saying these, but here are my honest feelings about it.\n\nIt was my birthday today, but I had mixed feelings about it."
