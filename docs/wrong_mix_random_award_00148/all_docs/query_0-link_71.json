        "text": "Hannah has struggled with mental health conditions since age 8. She had to leave school at 14-years-old due to her mental health worsening to the point she could no longer attend.\n\nAfter years of struggling for support and exhausting her options, Hannah felt defeated, but the pandemic gave her new motivation to support the next generation. After the schools closed due to COVID-19, she was still out of work but wanted to do all she could to help so she began to volunteer. In 2020, she volunteered 250 hours over six months.\n\nHannah then launched a youth-led access initiative, One/Third Project, and has since brought on several volunteers to help provide academic, employability and emotional services to young people with disrupted educational histories.\n\nHannah has since been nominated for a few awards, been featured in media outlets and been invited to a number of events as a guest speaker on behalf of young people across the UK. She is grateful to have a small platform to give a voice to those who may have been left behind by the systems in place currently. If her experiences can help just one young person, she has done a good job in her eyes.\n\nSince 2008, Steph has been volunteering in various ways with foodbanks, clothing banks and the Toy Rescue Mission. Her children all volunteer as well. Steph started the Food is Free Garden and Tacoma Food is Free Fortress during the summer of 2019. Before that she helped start The Pantry, which was a foodbank at Grace Place Church. Having been hungry a few times in her life and having experienced hardships like homelessness and real needs, Steph feels she has to help however she can, whenever she can. She said, “I honestly can’t NOT help.”\n\nNidhi cofounded a youth volunteering organization called Michigan Youth Volunteering Alliance, or “MYVA,” which focuses on engaging youth in community activities and serving people. This organization was started in pandemic times when she realized that youth and senior citizens are impacted with anxiety, stress, depression and isolation.\n\nNidhi founded MYVA initially with five youth members and now they’ve grown to 28 youths. MYVA’s main focus is on fighting hunger and as part of this they deliver meals to senior citizens who are homebound and unable to prepare meals for themselves. A friendly hello at the door can brighten the day for aged citizens and can even save lives. During the fall, MYVA teams help by raking leaves at retirement homes.\n\nIn Michigan, one in seven kids struggle with hunger. Through MYVA, youth have completed multiple donation drives to raise food and cereal for kids in need of food, and a can and bottle drive collecting around 1,000 bottles and cans. The money raised was used to buy 150 cleaning supplies for the local neighborhood care house.\n\nAnother project delivered virtual story reading for kids in Detroit schools who may not have access to a quality public library due to the pandemic.\n\nAmelia’s mom volunteered for foster care organizations and she had several friends that are foster parents. So Amelia understood that it might be scary to have to leave your home and go live with someone you don’t know. She thought that a night light may make that a little less scary.\n\nAmelia’s mom posted on Facebook that she was collecting lights and donations started coming in from all over the country. Amelia organized a day at school where every kid that brought $1 or a nightlight could wear a hat to school one Friday. A local business also donated an extra $200. Together they raised enough to donate over 500 nightlights to local children in foster care.\n\nThe news heard about her project and the story aired on the local channel went viral. Amelia ended up on the CBS national news. Munchkin Brand Toys in California heard about her story and sent an entire pallet of night lights to her house. Lisowe’s Lights was officially born. Since then they’ve donated 10,000 night lights to all 75 Arkansas counties, all 50 states and even 3 European countries. They work with over 200 foster care organizations to distribute lights in their communities.\n\nRajani founded Unite & Inspire, along with two other co-founders, Suchitra Tangirala and Deborah Banerjee, with a mission to unite and inspire people into giving back to the communities through volunteering services.\n\nIn 2020, she led the group of 200+ volunteers with a strategic partnership involving local nonprofits, designing and developing remote and virtual methods of addressing the needs of community. U&I team and youth volunteers distributed 25,000 pounds of food supplies, 5,000 school supplies,15 devices for online education and 1,500 hygiene supplies to 12,000 families in local communities affected by COVID-19.\n\nVolunteers served 1,000 health care workers with distribution of PPE, food and gratitude gift cards. During the snowstorm, they served 500 families with hot meals, essential supplies and recovery care packages. U&I volunteers conducted 3200 hours of educational workshops teaching math, science, digital arts, coding and computer languages to special needs children, underserved youth and community patrons in Houston and its suburb towns.\n\nThe team served 500 senior citizens during the pandemic, uplifting their spirits and keeping the mental health intact through remotely conducted interactive and engaging activities. Rajani inspired the volunteers to raise awareness about bone marrow registry and blood donation which were quite low during the pandemic.\n\nDynasty’s dysfunctional childhood motivated her to found the nonprofit organization Dynasty’s United Youth Association (DUYA) in 2014. DUYA’s mission is to ensure that all children and youth have access to quality programs that promote character and cultural competence. Dynasty partnered with the Los Angeles Public library to provide free tutoring, homework assistance, job-readiness workshops, college and career advisement and social-emotional support to youth ages 5-18 in urban communities.\n\nOver the past seven years, DUYA has helped over 800 students pass onto the next grade, recruited over 80 tutor volunteers, provided employment and internship opportunities, assisted over 20 students with college admission processes and provided college textbook grants for high school graduates. 90% of students return each year.\n\nIn March 2020, DUYA converted its entire curriculum to a virtual platform within one week to continue delivering services. To fund and execute a virtual program, DUYA launched its Virtual Learning Program with council member Herb Wesson and the L.A. Public Library to prevent students from falling behind grade level. DUYA also hosted a campaign called “closing the gap on educational inequalities,” where they raised $115,000 to sponsor more tutors and technological support for the youth who were severely academically affected by school closures.\n\nFrom a young age Ailiya has been close to nature. She has participated in clean up drives in school and currently works as a volunteer at Greenpeace India.\n\nAiliya’s realization that our planet is in a climate crisis came when she saw a jellyfish floating towards her – dead. Jellyfish are Ailiya’s favourite aquatic animals and she was saddened by the sight she had to witness. She was told that it was due to the intense heat waves passing through the state because of climate change.\n\nAiliya knew she had to do something for the betterment of the planet and created Youthopeian, an organization educating youth about the environment and technology. Ailiya strongly believes that technological solutions can be developed to tackle environmental problems. Through her initiative she raises awareness about the environment and motivates more people to pursue careers in environmental science and environmental engineering to create a real difference.\n\nAiliya was able to impact 7,000+ students from 30+ countries through Youthopeian and grew her team to more than 250 members. They’ve established seven chapters around the world and are actively hosting events such as webinars and competitions.\n\nWhen Lisa got an autism diagnosis for her daughter it was terrifying and lonely and she felt helpless. Lisa used the recovery time while battling breast cancer to build a nonprofit that would bring moms of special needs children together.\n\nLabeled & Loved’s mission is to embrace and strengthen families with special needs by providing connective experiences and educational resources.\n\nThey host a weekend retreat for special needs moms with nationally acclaimed speakers and breakout sessions. Their video channel, Sunshine in the Spectrum, provides parents with practical tips for positively parenting across all abilities, led by a board-certified behavior analyst.\n\nThe L&L Sticky Notes for the Heart was created to offer hope in the midst of parents’ most vulnerable days with intentional and inspirational texts filled with encouragement. In-person and virtual Moms Mingles offer connection through theme-inspired dinners and much-needed nights out. Their Podcast showcases stories of hope, inspiration and experts in the field with awe-inspiring guests each week.\n\nVirtual groups led by trained and background-checked volunteers will launch soon, as will a multimedia program inspired by the lack of resources available when teaching about puberty/maturity, sexual health and personal safety with application for the special needs population included.\n\nTwelve years ago, Saif started volunteering at the Women’s Intercultural Center in Anthony, NM. The executive director wanted Saif to update all of their technology. Thinking it would take about a week Saif volunteered for a month and brought in new computers, established a database to track participants and volunteers, made the technology eco-friendly by decreasing the amount of paper used and so on. In seeing their day to day operations, Saif saw the impact that they made and instantly fell in love with the organization and stayed.\n\nAt one time because of knowledge of the organization, Saif served as acting executive director. One notable program is the Border Awareness Experience which brings in high school, undergraduate and graduate university students and faculty from all over the country to be immersed in border life, culture, immigration issues and other areas of interest based on their degree plans. It introduces young people to true border life and erases those common misconceptions they have of the culture.\n\nThrough Saif’s time at the Center, there have been an array of opportunities to help the border region and lend helping hands to those in need.\n\nDion was enlisted in the US Marine Corps, serving as cook and infantry, from 1977 to 1983. Upon discharge, he joined the NYC culinary world and trained under David Burke at the Park Ave Cafe, receiving the true meaning of fine dining. Dion climbed the ranks and became an executive chef.\n\nIn 2011, Dion served as a football coach, mentor and creator of Culinary Cadets afterschool program at a local middle school in the Englewood, NJ community. In 2013 Disabled Combat Veterans Youth Program (DCVYP) was 501C3 incorporated by State Of New Jersey. This nonprofit is geared to empower youth with mentoring, leadership, academic strategies and a jump start into adulthood.\n\nIn 2014 Dion volunteered as a culinary arts professor at Bergen Community College (BCC) in Paramus, NJ for six years. In March 2020, when COVID-19 invaded the world, Dion went full throttle and created Table To Table Tuesday’s food distribution in the Englewood, NJ community, partnering with worship houses and local nonprofits. They distributed over 2 million meals to residents and military veterans in Bergen County, Jersey City and Passaic County.\n\nPaul is a longtime volunteer coach in the Durham RBI summer league, helping to revitalize baseball in the Inner City. Paul helps them play and practice baseball a few hours a day, giving them something to work on, developing them into successful teammates and young men, teaching them to work together for a common goal, to be an integral part of something special and to look forward to those days on the diamond for reasons more than just a game.\n\nThe team becomes friends and family, staying in touch for years. In the 2019 season, Paul had the honor of being a coach for the 16-18 division all-star team that became the first RBI team from North Carolina to advance to the RBI World Series in Vero Beach, Florida. For many of the players, it was their first real road trip, first time on a plane, first time away from home and their parents. Paul couldn’t have been prouder of the way they represented themselves, respected the opportunity to be in the national spotlight and embraced the other players from the other teams and other cultures from across the country as friends and interesting individuals more than just as competition.\n\nWhen the local school district started giving out meals to all children in the community, ages 1-18, regardless of homeschool, private school or public school, the Jewish community asked about Kosher meals.\n\nYoni took the initiative to find a local distributor to accommodate the Kosher-keeping community. Yoni started with giving out just under 12,000 meals per week and am now up to over 30,000 meals per week. By the middle of June 2021, Yoni will have given out over 1 million Kosher meals to the local South Jersey community.\n\nWhat started as a small couple-week project has blossomed into a 20 hour per week volunteer job to make sure that all children in the area are fed. Yoni also collaborates with the local food pantries to donate extra items including over 1 ton of milk each week to the local food pantry and is now working to fundraise to make this program permanent even after the pandemic is over.\n\nSara has seen firsthand the poverty endemic to an underclass of working poor in Cali, Colombia. 30% of Colombia’s economy depends on daily activities such as street sales and garbage recycling. These jobs provide just enough to cover basic daily needs in good times.\n\nThe pandemic has been devastating, as many in this underclass became unable to work due to sheltering restrictions. In June 2020, Sara decided to bake and sell cookies to generate money that could be donated to help those in dire need in Cali. She learned how to design a website through YouTube and created HumanKINDcookies.org.\n\nThe generosity of the US community to this initiative has been overwhelming; to date, Sara has baked and distributed 7,520 cookies, raising close to $10,000 for food. Her project continues to be not only a stable source of food for vulnerable families but also an inspiration for others to embark on similar activities. Three families joined her initiative and baked her cookie recipe in different geographic areas, while companies in Colombia have partnered with her for Christmas and art events to multiply the impact of her efforts. She has a rigorous academic schedule yet has never stopped baking to help others.\n\nAllan works to spur strategic philanthropic investment toward critical community groups and to catalyze positive change.\n\nHe led the Thornburg Foundation’s response to COVID: working quickly to provide more than $850,000 in relief to non-profits serving families experiencing hunger, homelessness and farmers critical to food supply, and to partner with state government to leverage $1 million in emergency food relief to native communities on lockdown.\n\nAllan co-chaired the NM Census Funders group, which raised $1.2M for 83 community-based organizations to encourage the state’s hardest-to-count communities to be counted. Recently, he helped start a pooled fund to support a healthy entry for asylees and another to support victims of domestic violence, which have both increased during the pandemic.\n\nThe foundation team uses bi-partisan, evidence-based approaches to catalyze meaningful and lasting change in the fields of education, governance, water, agriculture and social services. Allan firmly believes in service to others, starting from his time as a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala to now serving on local nonprofit and education advisory boards, advising social entrepreneurs and using his role to drive philanthropic action.\n\nAryan believes that the harder you work, the luckier you get and always tries his best in whatever he does. Aryan is a passionate individual who thrives to bring out the best in others as well. He’s been working with students since August 2020, helping them to have a better perspective of their actual skills, talents and strengths through his nonprofit, Optiverse.\n\nUntil May of 2021, Optiverse had mentored for 480 hours and expanded reach in 10 countries and nine states. Optiverse has also been conducting weekly workshops for underprivileged students and pediatric patients suffering from cancer.\n\nThe team also spreads awareness through various NGOs and trusts via collaborations. At Optiverse, the team also thrives to build one’s personality as well as enhance analytical, oratorical and writing skills. The Optiverse course includes design thinking, life maps, strength forms, free writing, skill worksheets, decision making, English strategies, identity building and gratitude journals.\n\nMentors are students from all around the world with a passion to connect and help other children. Since Optiverse is an organization devoted to provide accessible learning to all sections of the society, the course is 100% free for all!\n\nPranavi was inspired to start her project, Kindness4All, when she saw that not many people in her community were aware of the power of spreading kindness. Pranavi wanted to share this with them to create a movement to make kindness the norm.\n\nThrough Kindness4All, Pranavi aims to inspire other youth to participate in acts of kindness and community engagement to become leaders of change and positivity. To accomplish this, every week she conducts different “Kindness Projects” that people of all ages from all locations can participate in. Some of the previous projects include encouragement letters to women facing breast cancer, appreciation cards to local frontline workers and food pantry volunteers, fundraising money for Disney books for under-resourced elementary schools in the area, food drives for local food pantries, creating “Birthday Boxes” to help the underprivileged and “Kindness Packs” for children in hospitals.\n\nSince their founding, Kindness4All has conducted over 100 different “Kindness Projects” that people could participate in. Through Pranavi’s initiatives with Kindness4All, she’s been able to help make the lives of over 50,000 people better with acts of kindness while inspiring another 90,000 people about how kindness can make the world a better place.\n\nWhen Bridget had her first child in 2011, she was astounded by the amount of stuff required to take care of a baby and how expensive it could be. Meanwhile, she knew some of her neighbors were likely struggling to afford these things. Bridget learned that many parents have to make extremely tough choices when it comes to raising their babies – do they pay the electric bill or do they buy diapers? She decided that there had to be something she could do to help. Initially, she wanted to collect unneeded baby essentials and donate them to an organization who could deliver them to families in need. However, she realized quickly that there were no central agencies in New Jersey that were distributing diapers or any other baby essentials to families who couldn’t afford them. So she decided to do it herself, founding Moms Helping Moms Foundation – a NJ Diaper and Baby Supply that provides hundreds of thousands of free diapers, clothes, strollers, formula and other baby essentials each year to low income families all over New Jersey. They continue to be one of the only places these families can turn to for this type of support.\n\nTejasvi, a high school junior, is the founder and executive director of SHE: Sustainable, Heard, Empowered, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization which strives to eliminate period poverty and stigma in our society. She is directing four high school wide SHE chapters in California. Her initiative promotes the usage of reusable pads. Disposable pads contain dioxins from bleach that can harm the uterus. Statistics show that about 800,000 women die yearly due to lack of access to proper sanitation in the U.S. Each disposable pad contains the equivalent of about 4 plastic bags. That means every woman discards about 40,000-60,000 worth of plastic bags throughout her menstruating lifetime. Disposable pads are harmful to women’s health and the environment.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Tejasvi has conducted donation drives. Several care packages have been donated to women’s shelters, containing reusable pads, masks, hand sanitizers and dental care kits. Tejasvi is also focused on spreading awareness about women’s health and beauty standards through social media and other platforms.\n\nTejasvi aims to empower many women around her by conducting more such initiatives. She firmly believes that you empower yourself by empowering those around you.\n\nIn addition to overseeing the middle school’s athletic and extra-curricular programs, Kelly also implements service-learning into the district’s offerings. She has created the ‘Zionsville Do Days’, a span of several days in March where all classes (pre-school through high school), clubs and teams focus on a service project of their choosing, helping to serve organizations from all over the county. This past year, more than 30 organizations in the area were involved, including the local Humane Society, several nursing homes, the local park and food pantry.\n\nAdditionally, Kelly also leads students on service learning trips to Bolivia, Haiti, Nicaragua, Mexico and San Francisco. Over the course of the past 10 years, she has taken more than 400 students on these service-learning trips. While in these areas, students have the opportunities to work in medical clinics, volunteer with the homeless, host sports clinics, teach English and build homes.\n\nShe is relationship-focused, believing that students can discover passions and talents they never knew existed if they get outside of their comfort zones. By serving others, students are able to connect on unique levels for the betterment of their school, community and beyond.\n\nCynthia is the president of StarStyle® Productions, LLC. She was inspired by her dying farmer dad who said he lived his dreams. Cynthia’s mission is to empower women, families and youth. In 1999 she founded and is the executive director of the all-volunteer charity, Be the Star You Are!®. Without a salary, she orchestrated the assistance of thousands of individuals and distributed over $2 million in resources.\n\nCynthia produces and hosts the weekly life-affirming broadcast, StarStyle-Be the Star You Are! and gives youth a voice via Express Yourself! Teen Radio. Through Operation Disaster Relief, BTSYA provides emotional recovery to evacuees and survivors. During the pandemic with artistic community venues shuttered, Cynthia affords radio interviews to creatives. As a New York Times bestselling author, Cynthia published eight books. She raised chickens, drove tractors and picked fruit to fund college as the first in her family. She was the Outstanding Teenager of California and a teenage ambassador to Holland.\n\nCynthia’s goal is to inspire, encourage, inform and motivate others to be their unapologetically unique selves.\n\n14-year-old Ashley has dedicated herself to making a difference in her community through her 501(c)3 Sargeant’s Army. She started Sargeant’s Army to honor her cat, Sargeant, who died of cancer. She started by donating hand-sewn cat toys to local animal shelters. In 2020 she started sewing and donating masks to essential workers. After donating masks to a homeless outreach event she decided that she wanted to do more. She now creates and donates Hope Bags filled with hygiene items, socks and a kindness card to outreach programs throughout the state of Arizona. To date she has raised over $32,000 and donated over 12,000 Hope Bags to 21 different outreach programs in Arizona and neighboring states. Knowing how few volunteer events there are for younger children, she now hosts packing parties for the Hope Bags to provide volunteer opportunities for them.\n\nAnother way she gives back is by writing and illustrating children’s books on pressing social issues. She has published two books with a third on its way and all proceeds of the books are donated 100% to Sargeant’s Army. Each book sold equals a Hope Bag going to someone who needs it.\n\nSahana co-founded Foundation For Girls (FFG), a social impact organization to economically empower homeless single moms and support their children. FFG was founded in December 2014 and at the time, Sahana was 8 years old. Today, FFG invests in women to be financially savvy, digitally capable, career confident and socially connected for multi-generational change. FFG’s 4-pillar programming in financial well-being, career journey, digitally forward, and circle of care equips moms and their children with resources, relationships and recommendations for their journey to financial stability.\n\nDuring COVID, when the world was shutting down, FFG, with Sahana’s leadership and by leveraging technology, has expanded to nine states – CA, IA, WA, GA, NC, SC, TX, MD, DC. Over six years, Sahana has spearheaded FFG’s impact investing in over 2,500 homeless single moms and children (approximately 300 moms and 200 children per year) so they can become self-sufficient and financially resilient.\n\nGrowing up with a stuttering problem accompanied by severe anxiety, Kristin knew firsthand how it felt to freeze on hearing her name. She was relentlessly ridiculed by others, often taking flight when encountering difficult speaking moments. She gave presentations alone to teachers. She went to college to major in dance and after an ankle injury, was forced to create another path for her life.\n\nKristin is a role model of how persistence and perseverance result in resilience, and she has dedicated her life to evolving as a person and speech-language pathologist. After working with others who stutter for over twenty years, she co-founded, along with Julie Raynor, a non-profit program called Camp Shout Out. Approaching its eleventh year, this overnight program creates positive experiences communicating for kids ages 8-18 who stutter, and desperately needed hands-on training for both graduate students and professionals. As one parent shared, “It’s a game changer.”\n\nCaramia started Digging for Diversity in January 2021 to help combat increased social tension and lack of open forums to express viewpoints. Her community needed a safe space to speak one’s mind without fear of reprisal. She accomplished this by founding a program based on the Native American talking circle, an open-space allowing people from different backgrounds to discuss topics without judgement.\n\nHer team has hosted and broadly attended MLK Day of Service and Global Youth Service Day events. Digging for Diversity provides a planned hands-on service-learning component, themed cultural food-sampling and open discussion forum themed around current issues. “Speak and Paint Your Truth” GYSD event featured expression of personal feelings through painting of 38 canvases forming the sentence: Racism isn’t getting worse, it’s getting filmed. This powerful statement is on display at a regional youth center. Caramia and her team are focused on expanding their program to other communities.\n\nIt was the pathetic mews of a hungry mother cat, scrounging in a dumpster to feed her kittens that first caught Robert and Katherine’s attention. The chance meeting between the hungry strays and two computer programmers led to the creation of Rude Ranch Animal Rescue.\n\nSince 2001, Robert & Katherine have led the effort to improve animal welfare in their local jurisdiction and throughout Maryland by creating one of the first no-kill animal sanctuaries, a regional state-of-the-art high volume, low cost spay/neuter clinic (2012) spearheading creation of groundbreaking animal friendly legislation (2018).\n\nThanks to Robert & Katherine’s efforts, many local & government animal organizations have become no-kill entities. Animal euthanasia rates in their jurisdiction have dropped to almost zero. Animal Euthanasia rates in Maryland have dropped over 6% since 2012 when Rude Ranch began aggressively promoting spay/neuter for all animals.\n\nNesa was walking her child to school when an elderly crossing guard mentioned her A/C was not working. Nesa asked her husband to go to her home to take a look to see if he could repair it. They were shocked to see the condition of the house. No A/C, roof leaks, mold on the wall, septic backing up, stove/oven not working, and plumbing backed up. It was heartbreaking. The person that protected the couple’s children every day and was loved by so many needed help.\n\nNesa quickly set up a working committee assigning tasks and securing donations to renovate the home. Over six weeks with the Flower Mound Lady Softball team support, the group could replace the roof, replace all the windows, replace the A/C system, paint the interior, replace rotten wood, clear the septic system, and install new drywall and bathroom fixtures.\n\nIt was a fantastic feeling for Nesa and the team to know that they could provide a safe and comfortable home to someone who cares for and protects their children every day on their walk to and from school.\n\nQjiel founded Streets to Schools when he was only 15 years old in 2016. His work involves aligning the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) to ensure that the needs and rights of children, especially those in poverty, are addressed. In 2019, the Philippines ranked last in reading in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Qjiel and his team deemed that there was a great need to teach literacy to children as a lot of children in the Philippines graduate junior high school without ever learning how to read and write. Through his efforts, he has empowered children and adolescents aged 5 to 18 to proactively champion the 2030 agenda by publishing a storybook that advocates SDGs and literacy. Volunteers all over the world then story-tell these published books through online platforms to further inspire this generation to address our world’s most pressing problems. Being an agent of change, Qjiel celebrates the participatory rights of children as their model of innovation allows children to learn about community problems and contextualize SDGs in their situations. This allows young people to become global citizens while championing literacy at the same time.\n\nRylee is a 15 year old freshman in high school who, since the age of six, has selflessly given her time through community service through multiple projects of her own, as well as through service under other organizations.

In April 2020, Natalie learned that people with mental health conditions were struggling significantly more during COVID-19 due to feelings of isolation, increased stress and high-anxiety. Empathizing, she knew that she wanted to spread sunshine to people struggling with mental health conditions.\n\nIn May 2020, Natalie started her own international mental health organization, Solely Sunshine. The organization’s website provides the opportunity for anyone to volunteer to write virtual letters of encouragement, which get transcribed to paper by her team of over 100 teen volunteers.\n\nNatalie says, “The best part about running Solely Sunshine is hearing the positive feedback from the letter recipients. One recipient said, “I was desperate, I was even thinking about suicide… I sincerely thank you for your help. I’m really grateful. I will try my best, I will look at your message everyday.’” Since May 2020, with the help of people in over 50 countries and 43 states, Natalie and the team have mailed/received approximately 8,000 letters of sunshine, impacting over 10,000 people (the writers and recipients).\n\nChef Maria Loi has many titles (chef, entrepreneur, Greek food Ambassador, TV host & healthy lifestyle expert) and is passionate about changing the world one healthy bite at a time.

But Amandeep Kaur couldn’t be repressed and she knew she was going to pass this message on to other women in her household, community and globally. Amandeep chose this path when overhearing a single conversation at age 12 about her father providing free care to a female patient in an unfortunate situation.

Amandeep is fulfilling her grit by working towards a better today and an ideal future.\n\nThe heart of Chinmayi’s service lies in expanding the accessibility of online STEM events, opportunities, resources and mentorship for young students, especially within the field of neuroscience. Neuroscience (the study of the brain and nervous system) affects every single one of us on a daily basis, from the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep, yet many students do not gain exposure to understanding their brain until they are adults and well into college.\n\nExpanding our understanding of brain health from a young age is essential, and Chinmayi is on a personal mission to revolutionize the way we think about early student involvement in neuroscience through an interdisciplinary lens of education, outreach and awareness coming together. In 2019, Chinmayi founded an entirely student-led neuroscience non-profit organization known as Simply Neuroscience, and to date, we have been able to empower tens of thousands of fellow peers in making change at a grassroots level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Neuroscience holds great innovative potential, and as the next generation of physicians, scientists, politicians, creators, entrepreneurs and advocates, we are collaborating to unlock the future, one neuron at a time.\n\nHannah’s mom, an immigrant who raised her and her little brother alone, taught her that education can make the American Dream. Hannah grew up in the poorest metro area in the nation. There are very few educational resources available. At age 11, she was selected to the U.S. Team and won co-champions in the Primary Math World Contest in Hong Kong. For the first time, she knew that a girl from an underprivileged community can be an international champion.\n\nReturning from HK, Hannah founded San Antonio Math Include to offer greater access to STEM education to all students from different backgrounds, experiences, and cultural perspectives. In four years, she led SaMi to 7,183 students and 206 volunteers from 429 schools in 38 states and four continents.

They’ve raised $104,018 in funds and created 1,641 Casting Your Future Scholarship for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Collaborating with Stanford AI Lab, they’ll introduce Artificial Intelligence to 133 local high schools and 103,140 students in 2021-23. Through the partnership with the UN Major Group of Children, their online classes are accessible to 170 countries around the world.\n\nAfter 9th grade, Ellie tried to find an internship where she could apply her experience in graphic design, but for a variety of reasons she found that to be very difficult. Soon after, she met other teenagers who complained of similar difficulties in securing internships and/or volunteer opportunities that could fit into their busy schedules. So, she set out to find a solution.\n\nShe interviewed several local nonprofit organizations and learned that all needed help with one technology task or another — tasks that would be ideal projects for tech-savvy teen volunteers. With prize money from a social entrepreneurship competition, Ellie filed for nonprofit status. Then, she built a website and began advertising for high school students interested in volunteering and for charitable organizations in need of assistance. The response was overwhelming. To date, more than 10,000 students have signed up to help the organization’s 250 nonprofit partners with website design, programming, social media marketing, photo management and other technology projects. Ellie’s network also offers a tech hotline, lesson plans and homework assistance to help teachers, parents and students adapt to the new COVID-19 academic environment.\n\nFor thirty years, Judy has worked to improve the lives of children with special needs.

Like the rings on the center of a tree, the hurt is deep, but still there. Eva dedicated her life to helping children who endured abuse. They are not bad kids like she was not a bad kid. She was hurting, hungry and ignored by her community. So were her siblings. It was hard for her especially because her skin is black. Eva grew up in the south, but never gave up hope. Whenever she could, she helped others.\n\nThe thing is when you grow up with nothing, you don’t need much. Eva worked and worked, as a seamstress and as a mail carrier. Slowly, she saved enough to start charities that could give kids what I never had: a safe and loving home.\n\nFirst it was a daycare, then group homes for teen foster boys, whom nobody would help. Then a foster agency in Barstow, CA, a community whom nobody would help. The kids Eva has served she considers her own kids. She shows them unconditional love. The team at A Greater Hope continues to give children just that: A Greater Hope.\n\nAyo Handy-Kendi, aka The Breath Sekou and Mama Ayo, the Storyteller, has been a volunteer for most of her adult life, imitating her mom who served as a volunteer most of her life.

Jennifer went to Kenya in 2013 and over the years worked in various community projects. The after school girls meetings on topics such as leadership, boundaries and self worth, later bringing a community health worker along to discuss menstrual health, were growing. The adult women’s groups on income generating skills were also growing! Jennifer filed the project as a 501c3 and appointed a Board of Directors to support the work.\n\nAll of these years later, The Angaza Project has reached hundreds of women and girls, offered scholarships to High School (it is not free in Kenya and so many don’t get to go), created a path to higher education in universities partnering in Nairobi and connected to local master crafters for the women to train on skills that enable them to earn an income with dignity. Jennifer returns to Kenya several times a year to continue this work with the team and partners and even replicated the women’s empowerment in Mexico.\n\nIt has been said that the giving of one’s time to others is the best gift one can give.

After hearing and seeing veterans speak at a school Veterans Day assembly, Graci felt the need to support the U.S. military and let the men and women sacrificing their lives know that people back home cared about them. What started out as a school project collecting supplies from the community and sending care packages from home to the military overseas grew into a nonprofit.\n\nToday, Graci speaks to civic organizations and the military to let them know about OMM. Her efforts help raise support and donations to continue sending care packages to the military. More than 5,500 care packages have been sent to military members around the world and Graci has raised more than $130,000. Graci receives letters from the military telling her how much the care packages are appreciated. Here’s an example: “With COVID, being away from home and our workload we have all been a little down and unmotivated. We just got the packages about an hour ago and everyone’s morale has completely changed! Smiles and laughter all around!”\n\nEleanor’s story of community service started in September 2011 after reading in the newspaper that 19,000 healthy homeless pets were being killed each year in her border city.

India saw their mother buy food for the homeless and uncles donating their time and money, and India wanted to make sure that they continued to do that when they left home. It started when India began working at their school’s civic engagement office, and from there they learned more about giving back and doing for others outside of my community. Being a kind of coordinator instead of just a volunteer gave India insight that they never had before. India has learned a lot in their short time on this earth, and they can’t wait to learn and do more for not only their community, but for communities everywhere.\n\nWhile working for a national animal nonprofit in 2007, Dianne McGill received a call from a woman whose friend was dying and had no one to care for her two cats. Her friend’s hospice had no way to provide pet care and she was trying to find help for her friend. Her friend was heartbroken at the prospect of losing the loving companionship of her two cats and even more upset about what would happen to them after she died.\n\nDianne started searching for help but could not find any local or national program designed to help seriously ill patients with their pet care or rehoming needs. It was at that moment she knew it was time to solve the problem by starting a national program to help hospices provide care for the pets of seriously ill patients who had nowhere else to turn for assistance. McGill founded the national Pet Peace of Mind program in 2009 to ensure every seriously ill patient has access to the pet care assistance they need before and after they die so they can pass knowing their pets will continue to be loved and cared for in new homes. Today Pet Peace of Mind has chapters in 42 states and utilizes thousands of local pet care volunteers to serve more than 3,500 seriously ill patients and their pets each year.\n\nMichaela always had a deep-down need to serve her community. It started at age 3 as a desire to give money to homeless people so they knew they were not forgotten and that they are very loved. At age 5 she asked people who attended her birthday party to bring items she could use to create Christmas Eve boxes for kids living in shelters. In 4th grade she founded Bundles of Love Club. She realized just giving money to the homeless was not enough and she could do more. Now there are 16 chapters delivering bundles of survival supplies.\n\nShe decided to begin a new phase of her work. She calls it 144,000 Acts of Kindness. It’s her opinion that if she can engage that number of people all doing the same act of kindness, a paradigm shift will occur in the world’s consciousness. She created packets of golden nuggets with a card that is either passed on to someone or left to be found. People who perform acts of kindness feel good about themselves. People who receive feel good. That energy is passed on and on and on until a wave of positivity shifts the vibration of the world!\n\nMiran has always valued education and after realizing the need to improve schooling not only in his community but also internationally, he decided to create Strive2Thrive Edu.

After volunteering as an individual to assist people whose homes had been flooded by hurricane Harvey, Bill became aware of the work that Houston Responds was doing to bring together nonprofits and faith organizations. He saw the value in leveraging resources in his area so that people could be assisted more effectively with a reduced duplication of efforts.\n\nBill got together with his pastors and key members who had been involved after hurricane Harvey and identified the best ways First Pres could respond to a disaster. A half dozen focus areas were identified and teams were established for such things as laundry, meals, pre-event assistance, post-event disaster assistance, volunteer coordination and communication. He then recruited team leaders and co-leaders. This was followed by a churchwide survey to recruit members for these teams allowing people to serve where they felt called. Bill remains ready to serve but is praying we will escape hurricanes this fall.\n\nMicaella has been donating her time and resources since she was a young girl.

They also learned that a child dies every 15 seconds from unclean water. These facts caused them to start a project making origami Christmas ornaments and exchanging them for donations to raise money for water wells.\n\nIn 10 years, these two girls have raised over $2,500,000 and have helped fund over 300 water projects in 20 countries: Ethiopia, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Kenya, Liberia, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Peru, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and a Navajo Indian Reservation in Smith Lake, New Mexico. Isabelle and Katherine want nothing more than to educate the world about the clean water crisis and to make people realize that you don’t have to be a billionaire or a celebrity to make a permanent change in the life of someone who is thirsty.\n\nGodfrey Molen is the founder and executive director of Friendly Loving Opportunities (FLO), a nonprofit dedicated to providing a variety of services to the homeless and low-income communities of Baltimore.

She has always done service work with her family since she was young. Her first experience of service was when her family would go to a meal packing center and would pack hot meals for senior citizens on Christmas every year. She was often involved with service in school as well and liked to stay behind to help teachers clean up their classrooms or help the cafeteria staff run the after school cafe. One of her favorite parts of the school year was when her school would run a week of service and would send students out to various charities in Detroit to help others.\n\nShe, her mother and her brother all participate in food packing and delivery every weekend. She is always looking for different organizations where she can help out and even recently started her own organization to provide aid for her community.

Many clients are unaware of the assistance available to them or find the processes for applying confusing. All of this assistance helps people on limited fixed incomes to save on their health care costs and achieve peace of mind.\n\nMark and Paula are some of Northwest Assistance Ministries most faithful volunteers. When the pandemic hit, they knew where they needed to be. They have volunteered at the food pantry every day since the pandemic began, working tirelessly to make sure neighbors have food to sustain their families. Clients drive up and bags of groceries are loaded into their car. Preparing those bags and loading them into cars are just two of the roles they have filled. They also pick up donations, sort food, stock shelves and do it all with a cheerful, humble spirit.\n\n“It was not something we thought a lot about,” they say of their decision to continue volunteering during the pandemic. “It was the right thing to do; we knew we were needed.” Volunteering has become a family affair for Mark and Paula. Three of their grandchildren also volunteer at the pantry. The love they have for one another is evident in everything they do.\n\nEach day, at least one child dies from a home fire & almost 300 children injured from fires or burns. Dayna Hilton, a retired volunteer firefighter, has delivered innovative educational fire safety training to millions of children & their families since 2003. Volunteering 3,000 hours annually, Dayna & her canine companions, the Fire Safety Dogs, travel over 25,000 miles a year across the U.S. sharing their fire safety program.

One life saved was Angelica, 5, who shared, “Firefighter Dayna~ I was in bed under the ‘cobers’ and the smoke came. I crawled out of bed & crawled low, just like Sparkles [the FSD] showed me.” Immediately after getting her family outside, the home became totally engulfed in flames. Thanks to Angelica’s quick thinking, she is now a teenager. With the “power of the paw,” Dayna hopes to help keep more children like Angelica fire safe.\n\nService has been a part of Art’s life for decades.

Avni decided to curb childhood obesity by making exercise fun through dance. In 2017, she founded a 501c3 nonprofit organization called Change Will Happen. Her mission was to make the world healthier one dance step at a time. She partnered with the American Heart Association to form the first ever high school club called Stuy STEM Goes Red.

Since 2016 her organization has collected, sorted and redistributed over 26,000 batteries, saving them from landfills.\n\nIn summer 2020, Anirudh approached Ridgefield Music Parents with an intriguing idea. He had been thinking about how the complications of remote learning during the pandemic had been challenging for maintaining engagement and connection. He especially noticed, and personally experienced, the challenges when music programs and performance ensembles could no longer meet in-person. Music is a collaborative experience and eliminating the ability to meet in-person had been disheartening for students who thrive in school music programs.\n\nAnirudh brought together a small group of key organizing students and they established the structure for the program. In collaboration with Ridgefield music teachers, Anirudh coordinated the growth of the program into schools where high school and upper-level middle school music students provide remote mentoring twice per month to early middle-school and elementary students. Participation in the program is voluntary but it quickly expanded to over 200 students! In a time where students feel so disconnected, it’s been extremely powerful to connect younger students to high school musicians who can serve as practice coaches in these students’ music education.\n\nTheresa is a survivor of human trafficking and started The SOAP Project to educate people that it DOES happen in the United States, even in the suburbs. She wanted to help those still caught in the horrors of being sold to strangers. It takes a lot to convince people that there is no such thing as teen prostitution and that there are millions of runaways who are being victimized. Since the start of her nonprofit, she has had over 100,000 volunteers come to SOAP outreaches and given over 2 million bars of soap labeled with the national human trafficking hotline number to thousands of hotels and motels all across the U.S. They have attended 10 Super Bowls, 8 Detroit Auto Shows, NASCAR races, the Kentucky Derby and many more events where trafficking is rampant. Many young girls have been rescued by her courage and conviction. Due to her efforts, a law was named after her in Michigan where she was trafficked as a teenager. The ‘Theresa Flores Law’ removed the statute of limitations for minors who are trafficked so that they can persecute their trafficker whenever they are ready, no matter how many years have passed.\n\nJoseph Mahtab founded social media-based community platform “People’s Voice of Amtali – PVA” in 2017. PVA embarked on journey to highlight the potential of sub-district Amtali, Bangladesh to take effective initiatives to address local social issues and improve the quality of service by building a bridge between the general public through government, public representatives and policy makers via virtualization. The a2i division of the honbl. Prime Minister’s office has innovation talks about the success of this group, which currently has members in 101 countries around the world, with brand ambassadors in 6 countries.\n\nFollowing the success of the group, this model is being followed in Kenya and the initial work to follow this model has started in Andhar Pradesh in India. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Joseph and his team have warned people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and maintain social distance. During this time, approximately 200,000 masks, 3,500 hand sanitizers, 32,000 soaps and 1,000 baby foods were distributed with the financial help and material support of various individuals and social organizations.\n\nKaCey co-founded Helping Empower Youth (HEY!) with Marc “KD” Boyd in 2011. As two AmeriCorps alums they wanted to find a way to give back to children on what was once the poorest street in Georgia. As the organization grew, KaCey would continue to help provide wraparound services to youth and communities that are underserved, mainly communities of color. While most organizations were pulling back services at the height of the pandemic, KaCey and HEY! ramped up services. They engaged and worked with black male teens on Atlanta’s Westside who were selling water at intersections to make money in order to care for themselves and many times their families. After assessing the needs, KaCey and the dedicated team worked to create new programming, recruited advocates, helped to find jobs and connected youth to entrepreneurship training. KaCey is fully committed to changing the narrative for these young black teens who would have otherwise been lauded as creative entrepreneurs if not for the color of their skin and zip code. As a result, KaCey has been instrumental in affecting change in the lives of youth who now understand they have opportunity to chart their own course.\n\nVolunteering has offered a piece of sanity for Ashna over the past year. People all over the world have been confined to their homes, with limits placed on what they wished and were able to do. But through various programs, volunteering has given a means of connection with people within the community and across the world. For example Ashna spent 90+ hours speaking and tutoring students in Ukraine about English. Not only were the students in Ukraine delighted with the opportunity of honing their skills, Ashna was able to foster connections with the students — seeing some regulars over the months at each session and just having some excellent discussions. It was incredible to see that no matter how far apart people are, they all have similar experiences. It is a great reminder that we are all going though this time together and that we are not alone.\n\nVolunteering, serving others and having a servant’s heart has always been a large part of Jan’s life. Touching lives through the act of seeking to serve them in some way is touching hearts that are hurting and may possibly lead to changing someone’s life.

In 2018, the Pudukkottai District was badly affected by the Kaja Cyclone. Pristika collected food items from the students of her college that helped 300 families.\n\nMany people are suffering during the lockdown due to COVID-19 and Pristika raised money for donations and distributed food and hygienic kits that benefitted 500 people in her district. She associates with the local hospital to give homeopathic medical treatments for people who are asymptomatic or who have mild symptoms of COVID-19. She also participates as a part-time volunteer for programs promoted by the government and NGOS in her district to benefit girls and women.\n\nFor years, Cameron Climer has donated time to his local church, at a hippotherapy barn and by remodeling homes for those in tough situations. During the pandemic, he celebrated the town’s teachers by organizing “Think-o’ de Mayo.” Students made yard signs with appreciative messages and put out canned goods for the community food bank. He collected food and took pictures of the signs, amassing 400 pounds of food and countless pictures for the district’s teachers.\n\nThat same year, Cam began creating a comic book about teenage stress in high school. He wanted to help parents and their teenagers communicate about new stressors for students. He successfully created, wrote, published and promoted his comic book, 21st Century Teenager. To help people beyond his local community, he made the graphic novel digital, publishing it on Amazon. Now accessible anywhere, the project’s proceeds go to a youth mental health nonprofit. Cam was even asked to present about its subject material at a district-wide event about stress in high school. This is where Cam’s service story stops, but the tale is open ended; he expects to write many more stories in years to come!\n\nAfter being shaken the gruesome nature of the struggles that many homeless people in his hometown, San Jose, face every day, Ishan started going door to door, asking neighbors for donations of hygiene items. He was stunned by the positive impact one teenager could make in just under a month. When the tremendous potential of youth all over the world joining forces to make a positive impact struck him, he started an organization, Essentials For Homeless, to facilitate students in holding drives to collect and distribute toiletry items to the homeless. He contacted schools across the nation to join his cause and dozens more like-minded youth joined the movement to organize hygiene drives. He is now in charge of 33 chapters in 10 U.S. states and five countries. Through this work, his organization has collected over 11,000 toiletries for donation.\n\nWE STAND is an initiative that promotes inclusivity in education through diversifying the curriculum’s narrative. Alyssa’s story begins with her family’s nightly gatherings, where she learned about African-American history. Learning more about history piqued her interest. She became aware of the inconsistency in the history curriculum. As a result of this understanding, she was eager to learn more and was looking forward to February. For Black History Month, students would study black history. However, the discussion was limited to slavery and the impact of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks in the Civil Rights Movement. This aspect of history forced her to examine herself through the prism of the persecution she was subjected to, contradictory to the stories she had learned that showed black people in ways of strength.\n\nShe hopes to establish culturally relevant curricula through teaching youth through her initiative, and that as a result of her efforts, people of color will not have to go through what she did. She has recorded four public service announcements about Greenville’s black history, as well as collaborating with The Spot in Wilson, North Carolina to create an event for Juneteenth.\n\nVernelle has taught financial literacy classes since 2010 to those from 3-years-old to seniors. She finds it rewarding because it’s im"
