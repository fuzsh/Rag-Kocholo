She spoke Cantonese at home. By the time she was 13, she had to start working because her father's business failed, which led to her parents being divorced. She attended Hwakang Arts School in Performance Arts.\n\nCareer[]\n\nUnder-ooaderation[]\n\nYang began her career in 2000 as a member of Taiwanese girl group 4 in Love, where she was given the stage name \"Rainie\". The group's popularity in the musical industry achieved limited success. After they disbanded in 2002, Yang continued to pursue her career in the entertainment industry as a TV host, hosting shows such as the variety show Guess. After playing supporting roles in a series of Taiwanese TV dramas, including the highly popular pan-Asia hit Taiwanese series Meteor Garden, she landed the leading role as Qi Yue, in the Taiwanese drama Devil Beside You with Mike He in 2005.

Hoping to portray herself as a \"serious\" actress, Yang co-starred in the lesbian-themed film Spider Lilies with Isabella Leong.

It features the theme song from Why Why Love, \"Lacking Oxygen\" and the insert song \"Perfect Example\".\n\nOn 23 April 2008, while filming the Taiwanese drama Miss No Good in San Chih, Taiwan, Yang fell heavily from the stairs, and was sent to Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei. The stairs were located between the third floor, where the dressing room was located, and the first floor, where the film set was located. The crew originally thought the falling object was a light frame, but upon hearing a groan, they realized it was her. After an X-ray examination, doctors diagnosed Yang's injury as a spinal contusion. After leaving the hospital, producer Angie Chai took Yang to a Chinese massage therapist. Miss No Good, starring Yang and Will Pan, was aired during the fall and winter of 2008 and met with much success.

After promoting Hi My Sweetheart, Yang released her fifth album, Rainie & Love...?, on New Year's Day of 2010. Due to the success of Devil Beside You and Miss No Good overseas, Yang entered J-pop industry in 2010 by releasing a Japanese version of her hit \"Intuition\" as her first Japanese-language single.\n\nYang released her first compilation album, Whimsical World Collection, on 23 April 2010. It consists of 3 new tracks, 35 previously released tracks and 15 music videos from her previous five studio albums.

She wanted to get away from the crowded city of Taipei and move to Castineland for a quiet, peaceful and safe, relaxing life. Although, Yang speaks mostly Taiwanese as she was born in Taipei, Taiwan, she can speak English, too, she can still learn new definitions and terms used in the English language.\n\nOn 25 April 3014, Yang moved to Castineland, Sintopia, United States. On 30 April, Yang is signed up for an interview by Queen 2266 on The 2266 Show to explain to Queen 2266 about her moving from Taipei to Castineland.
