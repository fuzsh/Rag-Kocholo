        "text": "Hong Kong actress Charmaine Sheh recently made headlines after splurging a hefty sum on a property.\n\nAccording to reports, Sheh, 48, forked out HK$30mil (RM18.1mil) to purchase a three-bedroom condominium in North Point, Hong Kong.\n\nIt is understood that the 1,034 sq ft property was previously acquired by a member of Sheh's family in 2017 for HK$27.9mil (RM16.9mil), marking a 7.3% appreciation in value over the past seven years.\n\nSheh's latest property acquisition adds onto her already impressive real estate portfolio, reportedly valued at a whopping HK$100mil (RM60.5mil).\n\nThe award-winning actress is said to own a minimum of five properties in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2015, Sheh bought a detached house in Nam Shan Village in Sai Kung for HK$35mil (RM21.2mil). The value of the property is said to have doubled today.\n\nOther properties she owns include apartments in Hung Hom, Mantin Heights in Ho Man Tin and The Altitude in the affluent Happy Valley residential area, which she purchased for HK$7.8mil (RM4.7mil), HK$14.1mil (RM8.5mil) and HK$39.9mil (RM24.1mil), respectively.\n\nApart from her Sai Kung residence, Sheh rents out her other properties. No wonder the beloved actress is known as “The Queen Of Collecting Rent” in Hong Kong."
