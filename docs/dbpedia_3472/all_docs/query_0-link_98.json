        "text": "Sir Charles (Charlie) Spencer Chaplin was comedic actor, film director, composer and musician. He was born in the United Kingdom and moved to the United States of America (USA) in 1913 and eventually became one of the most creative and influential personalities of the silent-film era. His working life in entertainment spanned over 75 years, from the Victorian stage and the Music-hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer until his death at the age of 88. Chaplin’s most prolific creative activity occurred in the USA from 1914 to the mid 1940s. His most well-regarded movies were made with United Artists and include City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), The Great Dictator (1940) and Monsieur Verdoux (1947), although he made many other classic movies. Chaplin was critical to the development of film as an art form and he showed the potential of the medium to communicate complex themes. Chaplin, in his mature period, made intricate films, and provided an abrasive exploitation of p...\n\nAlthough many critics have discussed the influence of Chaplin on the theory and practice of Brecht’s epic theater, few have examined the political ramifications of this interaction. That such interaction spanned Brecht’s entire literary career suggests the importance of reciprocally reading these two figures, especially considering the politico-ethical concern they inherit from their nineteenth century forerunner, Karl Marx. If the Marx of The Eighteenth Brumaire is forced into satirical anger by the intrusive interruption of the lumpenproletariat, Chaplin and Brecht make this discontinuous, distracted and trampish figure the central object of their formal and narrative strategies. Beyond the teleology of Marxist science, the lumpen performs the political by exposing the repressed nonsense of social relations, thus suggesting their critique and transformation. This essay argues that epic theater screens these relations in a Chaplin-inflected montage of gestures, positions and attitudes, finding a means, to paraphrase Marx, to separate from the past cheerfully."
