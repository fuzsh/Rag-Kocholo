        "text": "An award-winning Danish documentary filmmaker known for “The Ballroom Dancer” (2011), “Albert’s Winter” (2009), and “At Home in the World” (2015). CIFF is pleased to welcome Koefoed to an innovative CIFF series called “Parallel Worlds: Art in Film,” and a screening of his compelling documentary, “The Lost Leonardo.” It tells the story of the sale of a painting at a Christie’s art auction for a whopping $450 million to Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman – the most expensive painting ever sold. Salvatore Mundi was much painted over when first discovered and thought to be of little value, but as time went on, museums and restoration experts who analyzed the painting made a shocking discovery: they believed it to be a long lost masterwork painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The record-breaking sales price was plastered all over the internet, distracting the world from one crucial detail: Not all experts were convinced it had actually been painted by da Vinci! See the movie!\n\nWas a big star in the days of the flapper at the biggest studio of the day, MGM. Page was born Anita Evelyn Pomares in Flushing, New York. Her lineage was Spanish. After moving to Hollywood, she got a contract at MGM and was a hit in her second film Our Dancing Daughters opposite Joan Crawford in 1928. Two more hits followed in this flapper film genre. In 1929 she made The Flying Fleet, the first film about Naval Aviation, filmed at Pensacola and North Island, which included scenes of Hotel del Coronado, Tent City, and San Diego bay. Anita retired from MGM in 1933. She married Navy Lt. (later Admiral) Hershel House in 1937 and moved to 717 A Avenue in Coronado where she and her husband lived many years.\n\nHas been a top composer and songwriter for film and TV for more than half a century and is the recipient of the CIFF 2022 Transcendent Award for his astonishing body of work. Fox and his frequent collaborator Norman Gimbel (who died in 2018) were nominated twice for Best Original Song Oscars (“Richard’s Window”/ The Other Side of the Mountain, and “Ready to Take a Chance Again”/ Foul Play), and were nominees or winners of multiple Emmy and Grammy Awards, including their most famous song, “Killing Me Softly With His Song,” which won the Grammy Song of the Year in 1973. Charles was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004, and has recently returned the board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after a hiatus. A documentary about his life, “Killing me Softly With His Songs, will be released later this year, and will screen at CIFF 2022.\n\nIn his prime Charlie Chaplin was the best-known movie star in the world. Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in London, England. He grew up in poverty and began working as a boy to help the family, and soon honed his entertainment skills in London music halls. He came to America at age 19 with a troupe and was signed up with the Keystone Studio. There he developed his Tramp persona in silent film that he kept throughout his career. Chaplin was a frequent guest at Hotel del Coronado and played on a local Polo team in the 1920s. Charlie Chaplin was given an Honorary Academy Award by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences in 1972 after being away from the USA for twenty years.\n\nOne of America’s most accomplished and beloved actresses, Cloris Leachman’s career spanned a whopping seven-plus decades. As comfortable with drama as she was with comedy, her range as an actress was astonishing, garnering a long list of awards for her work in film and television, including a 1972 best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in Peter Bogdonavich’s The Last Picture Show. After that came her unforgettable Frau Blucher in the Mel Brooks classic film Young Frankenstein, followed by Brooks’s hilarious High Anxiety. She won two primetime Emmys as Phyllis Lindstrom, Mary’s neighbor in The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\n\nLeachman was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2011, has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was granted an honorary doctorate in 2014 by her Alma Mater, Northwestern University. Her star turn as the oldest competitor on the ABC hit series, Dancing With the Stars, established her as the coolest octogenarian of all time.\n\nIn one of her final public appearances, Leonard Maltin presented Leachman with the Coronado Island Film Festival’s 2019 Legacy Award in the Crown Room of the iconic Hotel del Coronado. She literally brought the house down when she climbed onto Leonard Maltin’s lap during the presentation! RIP Funny Lady.\n\nDavid Janssen may be best remembered for portraying Dr. Richard Kimble in the television film series “The Fugitive” (1963-1967), but he also had title roles in three other detective services: “Richard Diamond, Private Detective;” “O’Hara, U.S. Treasury,” and “Harry O,” the latter in which he played a world-weary private investigator forced to leave the San Diego Police Department after a bullet became lodged near his spine. In Season One, appearing in 1973, Harry sets up practice out of his beach house on Coronado Island, and when he’s not working on cases, he spends his time fixing up his boat, “The Answer.” Harry O didn’t own a flashy car; he preferred to ride the bus. In Season Two, the series was retooled, moving Harry up to Los Angeles, and his beach house somewhere between Santa Monica and Malibu. That was Hollywood’s mistake: the show was canceled after the second season. A very disappointed Janssen nonetheless received kudos from critics for his performance that embodied a contemplative nature and loner personality, set off by a twisted smile and signature tweed sports coat.\n\nJanssen, a heavy smoker, died a sudden and early death at age 48, after being stricken with a heart attack. He had many friends in the entertainment field, including Clint Eastwood and Martin Milner, whom he met at boot camp at Fort Ord, and Richard Harris, who was so besot at Janssen’s passing that he sat for hours alone in the snow to assuage his grief.\n\nDon’t be surprised if you spy American filmmaker, painter, visual artist, musician and writer David Lynch out and about on the the streets of Coronado – his sister Martha Lynch Levacy is a longtime Coronado resident.\n\nA recipient of the Academy Honorary Award in 2019, Lynch has also received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, for “Mulholland Drive” (2001), “Blue Velvet” (1987) and “The Elephant Man” (1981), for which he also was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. After making several short subject films, his first feature length film, the surrealist “Eraserhead” (1977) became a cult favorite. He next directed “Elephant Man,” “Dune” (1984) and “Blue Velvet.”\n\nOther notable films include “Lost Highway” (1997) and “Inland Empire” (2006). Actress Laura Dern has starred in many of Lynch’s films.\n\nIn 1990, Lynch worked with television producer Mark Frost (Hill Street Blues) in developing a drama series with supernatural undertones, “Twin Peaks” (1990 -1991). The series, set in a small Washington town, seeks to discover who murdered high school student Laura Palmer. It was also made into a motion picture. Lynch is an avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation and in 2005 he founded the David Lynch Foundation, which seeks to fund the teaching of the practice in schools and to at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees\n\nBorn Desiderio Alberto Arnaz Y De Acha III – hailed from an affluent family in Santiago, Cuba. Following the 1933 Cuban revolution in which all their property was seized, the family fled to Miami, Florida. Five years later, Arnaz formed his own band in Miami Beach, which helped him gain popularity in the American music industry. In 1939 Arnaz was offered the opportunity to audition for a Broadway musical titled “Too Many Girls.” The following year, he went to Hollywood to act in the film adaptation of the musical, where he met Lucille Ball; the couple married in November 1940. They subsequently created their own production company, Desilu Productions, which, among its assets was the popular “I Love Lucy” show, which debuted on CBS in 1951.\n\nArnaz and Ball retreated to The Del in 1950 to polish their comedy routine under the direction of “Pepito the Spanish Clown,” a renowned vaudeville performer. They stayed at the hotel for a couple of weeks, where they also developed their “Ricky and Lucy” personas (he the serious Cuban bandleader; she, his zany star-struck wife). In one episode of “I Love Lucy”, Lucy and Ricky Ricardo stay at Hotel del Coronado with their friends, Fred and Ethel Mertz.\n\nBehind the scenes, Arnaz introduced many firsts to television including the first to film in front of a live studio audience, and the first with fixed adjacent sets.\n\nArnaz and Ball divorced in 1960. He and his second wife, Edith, eventually moved to Del Mar, California, where they lived in semi-retirement. He owned a horse-breeding farm in Corona, California and raced thoroughbreds. In his later years, he donated to several charities and nonprofit organizations, including San Diego State University.\n\nDiane Keaton is an Academy Award-winning actress known for her idiosyncratic personality and quirky fashion style. In addition to her 1978 Best Actress Oscar as the title character in Annie Hall (starring with Woody Allen, who also wrote and directed), she has won a British Film Academy Award, two Golden Globes, and the AFI Life Achievement Award. Her 2003 Something’s Gotta Give with Jack Nicholson earned her an Oscar nomination, and the 2018 Book Club with Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen was a fan favorite. Keaton, a well-informed aficionado of California art and architecture, is also the author of several books. She was a familiar site in Coronado in 2007, touring several historic homes while researching her coffee-table book, California Romantica. Upon publication, she held a book signing reception at Coronado Historical Association in return for CHA’s help with her architectural research and connection with local homeowners.\n\nProlific songwriter Diane Warren has garnered many prestigious awards in her impressive career. But in spite of being nominated for an Oscar twelve times, she is yet to win! Her comment was, “Yikes! Well at least I hold a record for something!” She has written nine Number 1 songs and thirty-two Top-10 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, including “If I Could Turn Back Time” (Cher, 1989), “Because You Loved Me,”(Celine Dion, 1986), and “How Do I Live” (Lee Ann Rimes, 1997). She is the first songwriter in history to have seven hits, all by different artists, on the singles chart at the same time. Warren was in Coronado to accept the Transcendent Award at Coronado Island Film Festival’s 2019 Leonard Maltin Celebrity Tribute Dinner at Hotel del Coronado. She also thrilled festival guests with a special piano performance of her best-known favorites, with singer Marisa Corvo.\n\nThe great swashbuckler and romantic lead Errol Flynn was born in Battery Point, Tasmania. His father was a professor and he said his mother was descended from “seafaring folk,” which is where his love of the sea came from. He attended school in London and Australia but was restless and worked odd jobs between Sydney and New Guinea. His looks got him a role as Fletcher Christian in an Australian film about the mutiny of the Bounty. He then made his way to Hollywood and Warner Bros. After a couple of very small roles, Captain Blood made him an instant star, along with Olivia de Havilland. The Adventures of Robin Hood in 1938, also with Olivia de Havilland made him one of the top stars of Warner Bros. Errol Flynn was also a famous yachtsman, sailing his yacht The Zaca to Coronado and living aboard in Glorietta Bay while he filmed Dive Bomber at North Island in 1941. His 17-minute film, The Cruise of the Zaca, screened at CIFF 2021, with his daughter Rory Flynn in attendance.\n\nFrank Wells was born in Coronado and traced his ancestry back to the Mayflower. He was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University and a graduate of Stanford Law School, becoming a lawyer. He was president and vice-chairman at Warner Bros. before being recruited by Roy E. Disney to become Disney’s president and chief operating officer (1984 until his death in 1994), alongside Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg. A born adventurer, Wells died in a helicopter crash at age 62 on Easter Sunday 1994 while returning from a heliskiing trip in Nevada’s Ruby Mountains. He was a good friend of Clint Eastwood, who had been skiing with him on that weekend. Eastwood had left in his own helicopter just an hour before Wells’ departure.\n\nBoth “The Lion King” (1994) and “Waking Sleeping Beauty” (2009) are dedicated to his memory, and the Frank G. Wells Building is a large five-story office building inside the main gate on Disney’s Burbank Studio lot. Members of the Wells family continue to live in Coronado.\n\nGary Cooper is considered to be one of the most natural actors of all time, with an innate ability to underplay and deliver restrained performances. He understood the camera’s ability to record slight gestures and facial movements; perhaps that came from his early ambition and training to become an artist.\n\nCooper’s acting career spanned thirty-six years, from 1925 to 1961. He appeared in eighty-four feature films, from the end of the silent film era to the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood. His specialty was Westerns, mirroring his preference for the outdoors and several years working in Yellowstone National Park.\n\nHe was nominated five times for Best Actor Oscars, and won for two, the first, Sergeant York (1942). In accepting the award, Cooper in his characteristic humble fashion, said: “It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Because to the best of my ability, I tried to be Sergeant York. Shucks, I’ve been in the business 16 years and sometimes dreamed I might get one of these things. That’s all I can say… Funny, when I was dreaming I always made a good speech.”\n\nHe also won an Oscar for High Noon (1953), playing opposite Grace Kelly, and asked John Wayne to accept for him. And, just two months before his death from cancer, Cooper was presented with an Honorary Oscar, accepted by his close friend Jimmy Stewart, who said, “Coop, I’ll get this to you right away.”\n\nCooper was also close friends with Ernest Hemingway and starred in two movies penned by the author, Farewell to Arms (1932) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943). Hemingway had said the lead character in the latter book was modeled in part on Cooper, with whom he often fished and hunted. Hemingway shot himself one month after Cooper’s death. Cooper made several visits to San Diego County. In a partnership that included Bing Crosby and Oliver Hardy, Cooper was responsible for the building of the Del Mar racetrack in 1937. Due to his age, Cooper did not serve in the military during World War II, but did get involved in the war effort by entertaining the troops, and in June 1943 he visited military hospitals in San Diego.\n\nWho doesn’t remember Geena in “Thelma and Louise” (1991) or “A League of Their Own” (1992), to name a few from her long list of movie credits? The recipient of this year’s Legacy Award at the Leonard Maltin Industry Tribute dinner, Davis also happens to be in town just in time to introduce her new memoir, “Dying of Politeness,” to festival attendees. The recipient of various awards, including an Oscar and a Golden Globe, in 2004 she founded the non-profit Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, based in Los Angeles, which has engaged in several large scale research projects concerning the current conditions for women in mass media, clearly raising awareness and beginning to make a difference. In 2022 the Institute was awarded the prestigious Governor’s Award by The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.\n\nGoldie Hawn rose to fame as part of the cast of “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-in” in which she played zany, bikini-clad Sparkle Farkle and showed America how big a smile could be. She received an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for her performance in “Cactus Flower” (1969). She also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her title role in “Private Benjamin” (1980). Other notable films are “Bird on a Wire” opposite Mel Gibson (1990), “Death Becomes Her” (1992) with Meryl Streep, “Housesitter” (1992) with Steve Martin and “The First Wives Club” (1996) with Diane Keaton and Bette Midler. In a movie entitled “$” (also known as “The Heist”) made in 1971, Hawn played opposite Warren Beatty, with the final hotel sequence filmed at Hotel del Coronado. Hawn has been in a relationship with actor Kurt Russell since 1983. They have a child together, actor Wyatt Russell; Hawn also has two children, actress Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson. Hawn and Russell have made three movies together, “Swing Shift” (1983); “Overboard” (1987) and “The Christmas Chronicles, Part II” (2020). She also made a cameo in “The Christmas Chronicles” (2018).\n\nThe great star of the silver screen (silent and sound) was born Greta Gustafsson in Stockholm Sweden. She studied at the Royal Dramatic Acting School in Stockholm and was spotted in a film by MGM’s boss L. B. Mayer, who invited her to come to Hollywood. Production head Irving Thalberg groomed her and costume designer Adrian created her image in one silent film hit after another. Her look was imitated around the world. Many silent film stars with accents tanked in the transition to talkie, but her husky voice and slight accent helped her sexy appeal. She starred in such classics as Romance, Mata Hari, Grand Hotel, Queen Christina, and Camille. Garbo was one of the many stars that vacationed at the Hotel del Coronado. She became extremely reclusive in her later years, wearing various disguises when out in public. True or not, her most famous quote, spoken in a deep, accented voice, is “I vont to be alone!”\n\nWho could ever forget Helen Hayes’ portrayal of stowaway Ada Quonsett in the movie “Airport” (1970), for which Hayes won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress! But it was not Hayes’ only Oscar – her first came way back 1932 for Best Actress in the film “The Sin of Madelon Claudet,” one of the film industry’s early “talkies” in which she played a prostitute sacrificing for her son. Hayes was bestowed the nickname “First Lady of American Theatre” for a career that spanned 80 years, beginning as a child actor at age five. She was one of just sixteen people who have achieved an “EGOT” –winning an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy and a Tony Award. She also was a 1980 Kennedy Center honoree. Hayes always seemed to have a twinkle in her eye, dropping several pearl of wisdom along the way, including “If you rest, you rust,” “The hardest years in life are those between ten and seventy” (stated when she was 73), and “Age is not important unless you’re a cheese.”\n\nJames Garner may best be remembered for starring in several memorable television series for over five decades, most notably Bret Maverick in the 1950’s Western series “Maverick” and as Jim Rockford in the 1970s private detective series “The Rockford Files.” But Garner also starred in more than 50 theatrical files over his career, including “The Great Escape” (1963) with Steve McQueen, “The Americanization of Emily” (1964) and Victor/Victoria (1982), both opposite Julie Andrews, and “Murphy’s Romance” (1985) with Sally Field and “Space Cowboys” with Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland.In 2004 Garner received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild. That same year, he also received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for “The Notebook,” in which he played opposite Gena Rowlands. Many television shows and made-for-TV movies were also filmed at The Del during the 1970s and ‘80s, including “Space,” with Garner, Blair Brown and Bruce Dern.\n\nWas an American singer, poet and songwriter who was the lead vocalist of the rock band the Doors. He was the estranged son of a retired Navy Admiral and his wife who lived in Coronado. Morrison died at age 27 of mysterious causes (no autopsy was performed) in Paris, where he had gone to continue to work on his poetry. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Paris. It has been reported that his father, before he died in 2008, made peace with his son by traveling to Paris to visit his grave, installing there a plaque of his own making. Translated from the Greek, it reads: “True to his own spirit.” The family continues to pay for upkeep of the gravesite.\n\nJoan Crawford once described her onscreen performances succinctly, saying “If you want to see the girl next door, go next door.” And the noted writer F. Scott Fitzgerald also offered his opinion: “Joan Crawford is doubtless the best example of the flapper, the girl you see in smart night clubs, gowned to the apex of sophistication, toying iced glasses with a remote, faintly bitter expression, dancing deliciously, laughing a great deal, with wide, hurt eyes. Young things with a talent for living.” That was the Crawford of the 1920s, when she married the first of three husbands, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., after she was cast in a few silent films, most notably opposite Lon Chaney in “The Unknown” (1927). She made several films at MGM Studios, including three cast opposite rising star Clark Gable, in the early 1930s. But by 1938, she was named “Box Office Poison,” although she fared better in 1939 with “The Women,” playing opposite her professional nemesis, Norma Shearer. Crawford redeemed her reputation, winning an Oscar in 1946 for “Mildred Pierce.” She notably was not present at the ceremony, as she feigned illness, but upon hearing on the radio that she had won, she ushered the press into her bedroom where she dramatically expressed her appreciation. Although they were rumored to disdain one another, Crawford and Bette Davis agreed to bite the bullet and star in “Whatever Happened to Baby Jane” (1962). When Davis was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award, Crawford got in touch with the four other nominated candidates, who were all situated on the East Coast, offering to accept the award on their behalf should they win. They all agreed and when the winner was announced, it was Crawford who mounted the stage, passing Davis, and warmly accepting the Oscar for Anne Bancroft (“The Miracle Worker”). Crawford adopted four children. Her oldest, Christina, penned a book, “Mommie Dearest,” in 1978, in which she alleged mental abuse by Crawford; it was made into a movie in 1981 of the same name starring Faye Dunaway.\n\nAlthough Johnny Downs was born in New York City, he was known locally as “Mr. Coronado.” He started his career in Hollywood as a child actor in the early Our Gang series for the Hal Roach studio. When he was to old for the part he started singing and dancing in clubs around the country until he got back into movies. He appeared in Coronado (1935) costarring Betty Burgess and Jack Haley (the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz). Coronado was set at the Hotel del Coronado. After Downs retired from film, he settled in Coronado with his family, where he sold real estate and began a television show for children, The Johnny Downs Show, on KFSD and later KOGO, which lasted seventeen years. He and his wife June were familiar fixtures in the lively Coronado tennis scene.\n\nWith nearly two decades of live television experience and 7 regional Emmy Awards to his name, John brings his high energy and award winning style to every project he touches. His career began in sports broadcasting as host of the San Diego Padres Pregame and Postgame shows, a job he held for 10 years. During that time he also covered the San Diego Chargers, SDSU Athletics, USD Athletics and countless other sporting events, including Super Bowl XXXVII.\n\nMore recently, John has shown his versatility as the host of Tiny House Nation on A&E and Netflix, where he helps families prepare for the extreme downsizing it takes to live in 500 sq. ft. or less. Married in 2008, he lives in San Diego with his wife Megan and their son Jake.\n\nActress, singer, and dancer Judy Garland, born Frances Gumm in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, packed a lifetime of achievements into a career that began as a child on vaudeville and ended with her premature death from an accidental barbiturate overdose when she was just 47 years old. Garland left us with a legacy of work that included her role as Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) and her immortal singing of “Over the Rainbow.” Of course, the Oz series of books were penned by L. Frank Baum, who wrote many of the stories while living in Coronado.\n\nGarland received an Academy Juvenile Award for her double performances in “The Wizard of Oz” and “Babes in Arms” (also 1939). She also received a Golden Globe, and a Special Tony Award and was the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, which she did in 1961 for “Judy at Carnegie Hall.”\n\nNotable films also included “Meet Me in St. Louis” (1944), “The Harvey Girls” (1946), and “A Star Is Born” (1954), all of which captured Garland singing memorable songs in her remarkable voice.\n\n“The Great Kate” was named in 1999 by the American Film Institute to be the greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema. Over the course of her 60-year career, she was nominated twelve times for an Academy Award, and won four times, the first in 1934 for “Morning Glory” (1933), then in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” (1967), “The Lion in Winter” (1969) in which she tied for the award with Barbra Streisand (“Funny Girl”) and “On Golden Pond” (1981). And still, there were other great films: “The Philadelphia Story,” “Little Women” and “The African Queen.” Hepburn was raised in Connecticut by wealthy, progressive parents, which may have been the seed for her own headstrong independence, and she came to choose onscreen roles that matched her values, often playing strong-willed, spirited women.\n\nIn nine films, most notably “Woman of the Year,” “Pat and Mike,” and “Adam’s Rib,” Hepburn played opposite Spencer Tracy, with whom she acknowledged a 26-year love affair. Their final film together was “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” Spencer, who was suffering from heart disease, died just 17 days after shooting their final scene together.\n\n“You know how to whistle, don’t you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.” Lauren Bacall, with her low, sultry voice, will always be remembered for her line in the 1944 film, “To Have And Have Not.” At just age 19, Bacall delivered that line to her love interest (and soon to be husband) Humphrey Bogart. That was her first Hollywood role, secured after she appeared on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar and was discovered by “Slim” Keith, who brought her to the attention of her producer/director husband Howard Hawks, who soon invited Bacall out to Hollywood for a screen test. She passed with raving marks and soon was making several “Bogie-Bacall” movies, including “Key Largo” (1948). Just after that film made its debut, the couple visited Hotel del Coronado, Bacall noticeably pregnant with their son John.\n\nFollowing Bogart’s death in 1957, Bacall alternately appeared on Broadway and on the silver screen. She won Tony Awards for her roles in Applause (1970) and “Woman of the Year (1981). In 1996, Bacall appeared in “The Mirror Has Two Faces,” opposite Barbra Streisand. For that role, Bacall was nominated as Best Actress in a Supporting Role both for an Academy Award and the Golden Globes, winning the Golden Globe for the role.\n\nWladziu Valentino Liberace was a child prodigy of Polish origin born in West Allis, Michigan. As a singer, actor and pianist, he enjoyed a successful career spanning four decades. In 1950, he was a popular entertainer at Hotel del Coronado, where he had been hired as a pianist. On a slow evening, with just a few in attendance, management gave him the option to cancel the night’s engagement. Fortunately he declined, and was “discovered” by a television producer in the audience, who recognized his ability to connect with intimate groups, making him perfect for “the small screen.” Remembered primarily for his glitzy outfits and signature chandelier atop his piano, Liberace was long derided for his effeminate ways, vehemently denying that he was gay in an era when that revelation would destroy a career. That fact was later confirmed, however, and, sadly, he died of Aids in 1987.\n\nWith her striking red hair and vibrant blue eyes, Lucille Ball could have been a Hollywood heartthrob, and as a contract player with RKO Radio Pictures, she did appear in several movies as a chorus girl or similar roles in the 1930s and ‘40s. But she married Cuban band director Desi Arnaz in 1940 and her career took a different direction. In 1948, the couple created their own production company, Desilu Productions, which organized their programs on stage, screen, and radio. After introducing a zany character on radio, Ball and Arnaz ventured into the new medium of television, creating the beloved CBS sitcom “I Love Lucy.”\n\nIn the 1950s, to prepare for her “I Love Lucy” role as “The Professor,” a vagabond musician who wanted to appear in husband Ricky Ricardo’s orchestra, Ball sequestered herself with her acting mentor, Buster Keaton, at the Hotel del Coronado. She and Arnaz also spent two weeks at the hotel, where they enjoyed playing tennis.\n\nFollowing her divorce from Arnaz in 1960, and buying out his share of Desilu, her company also produced other TV series, including “The Untouchables,” “Star Trek” and “Mission: Impossible” and “The Lucy Show.” Ball also returned to movies, most notably playing opposite Henry Fonda in “Yours, Mine and Ours” and the musical, “Mame.”\n\nBorn Norma Jean Mortenson, Marilyn Monroe was famous for playing comedic “blonde bombshell” characters. She was one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 60s, as well as an emblem of the era’s sexual revolution. She was married and divorced three times, most notably to baseball legend Joe DiMaggio (1954-1955) and playwright Arthur Miller (1956–1961). Coronado of course remembers her for her role as Sugar in “Some Like it Hot” (1958), shot at the Hotel Del, where locals lined the beach every day to watch the filming of her scenes with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. In August, 1962, Fox Studio fired her after repeated absences from the set of “Something’s Got to Give.” On August 5, 1962 Monroe was found dead in her Brentwood bungalow from an overdose of barbiturates. She was 36 years old.\n\nMary Pickford was the biggest female star of the silent screen. She was so popular that she was nicknamed “America’s Sweetheart.” She was born Gladys Marie Smith in Toronto, Canada. Her single mother’s poverty drove the family to hard work in the theater, in Canada and the U.S. She began appearing in bit roles in films and moved to Hollywood with the Biograph Co. and became known as “the Biograph Girl,” before stars had credited names. But she soon became so popular with the public that she had the first million-dollar contract with Famous Players/Lasky (later to become Paramount). She also started her own production company and then began a partnership, United Artists, with her husband Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Charlie Chaplin, and D.W. Griffith. She knew Coronado well. In 1915 she made the movie, A Girl from Yesterday, directed by Allan Dwan for Paramount Pictures. The movie featured scenes on John D. Spreckels’ own yacht. Spreckels owned the Hotel del Coronado as well as many other interests in San Diego. Pickford won the second Best Actress Award given in 1929 for Coquette.\n\nTrained as a dancer by her father who later moved the family to Hollywood where he opened a dance studio and trained stars like Jimmy Cagney. “Rita Cansino” began appearing in movies mostly as an exotic foreigner for Fox studios. But Columbia studio head Harry Cohn spotted her raw talent and took charge of her image; she was now Rita Hayworth with lustrous red hair. Her breakout role was playing opposite Cary Grant in the aviation drama, “Only Angels Have Wings.” She danced opposite Fred Astaire in the musical “You’ll Never Get Rich (1941) who later said she (not Ginger Rogers) was his favorite dance partner.\n\nIn August 1941, a Life magazine photo of Hayworth wearing a negligee with a black bodice, catapulted her into the No. 1 Pin-Up girl for GIs serving in World War II. Her image as the quintessential femme fatale, was cemented with her title role in the 1946 noir film, “Gilda,” where she played opposite Glenn Ford. She once quipped, “Every man I knew went to bed with Gilda… and woke up with me.”\n\nIn later years, Hayworth had problems with alcohol, but her second (of five) husbands, Orson Welles, didn’t think the problem was alcoholism “although it imitated alcoholism in every way” including her out-of-control rages. After her divorce from Welles, Hayworth married Prince Aly Khan, who was very involved in horse racing and the couple often visited the Del Mar Race Track, as well as Hotel del Coronado.\n\nBy 1972, when she was just 54, Hayworth could not remember lines in the movie “The Wrath of God” and co-star Robert Mitchum suggested they shoot just one line at a time. In 1980, it was disclosed that Hayworth had early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, leading to her death at age 68. The diagnosis drew attention to Alzheimer’s, which was largely unknown by most people at the time, and helped to increase public and private funding for Alzheimer’s research.\n\nActor, comedian, musician, art collector, writer and producer Steve Martin’s distinguished career includes a Primetime Emmy Award, five Grammy awards, the 2005 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, a 2007 Kennedy Center Honor, an Honorary Academy Award in 2014, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute in 2015.
