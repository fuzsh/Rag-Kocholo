        "text": "Charles (“Charlie”) Chaplin (1889–1977) was the most famous actor and filmmaker in the era of silent film. Chaplin wrote and starred in comedies such as The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925) and City Lights (1931). British by birth, he spent most of his career living and working in the USA. Chaplin is best known for his clumsy, kind-hearted character \"The Tramp\", the star of his silent films, as well as for his slapstick style of comedy. Chaplin produced all but one of his films himself. As well as being the writer, director and starring actor of his films, he also composed—and even performed—many of their soundtracks.\n\nEarly life\n\nCharles Chaplin was born on 16th April 1889 in London, England, the son of music-hall entertainers. Family life was unstable, and Charlie and his brother were sent to the workhouse twice. The children were raised alone by their mother, who encouraged Charlie’s talent for performing. When Charlie was 14, his mother became ill and he began looking for work as an actor to support the family."
