Tad is a young boy who wants to go to military school so he can grow up to be a great soldier, just like his dad. Little does he suspect that Slag (Wolheim), a bum and a thief, is actually his father. Slag, not wanting to reveal his true identity and thus destroy Tad's belief in his father as a war hero, robs a factory for the money to send his son to a fancy military academy. I order to stay close to Tad, he takes on a job at the academy's stable. This is a truly wonderful film with elements of comedy and drama. It's a moving tribute to the love between father and son. This film is presented with the original music and effects score as it was when released in 1929.\n\nTHE BIG TOWN starring Our Gang. This is a very rare and unusual early entry from the Our Gang series. After accidentally burning down a neighbor's barn and getting trapped on a freight train, the gang find themselves in New York City. They decide to see the sights and the film shows many of the city's landmarks including the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. After taking over a city bus for a wild drive through the streets, the police finally catch up with them and send them home. The return journey, this time on a passenger train, gives the gang a nice opportunity to cause mayhem for their fellow passengers!\n\nGRANDMA'S BOY (1922)\n\nand I DO (1921)\n\nHooray! Harold Lloyd on DVD!\n\nGRANDMA'S BOY starring Harold Lloyd, Anna Townsend and Mildred Davis. In this, Harold's first feature film, he is a coward. He's afraid of the bullying rival for Mildred's affections, he's afraid of tramps, he's even afraid of his own shadow. His loving grandmother takes pity on him and tells him the story of his grandfather (also a coward) who became a Civil War hero with the help of a magic charm which she gives to Harold. As long as Harold has the charm he's afraid of nothing! He marches forth to demonstrate his newfound courage in some of the funniest episodes ever in silent comedy! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nI DO starring Harold Lloyd, Mildred Davis and Noah Young. Harold becomes domesticated after his marriage and is soon seen walking down the street with Mildred pushing a baby carriage...full of bootleg hooch! When his brother-in-law drops off his kids at Harold's house, tranquillity comes to an end. Between his nephew sawing apart his furniture, nailing his shoes to the floor and setting off fireworks in the house, Harold has his hands full. At last, late at night, with the kids finally asleep...there's the burglar! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nTUMBLEWEEDS (1925)\n\nDirected by and starring William S. Hart; additional direction by King Baggott; taken from the story by Hal G. Evarts. With Barbara Bedford and Lucien Littlefield. \"Tumbleweeds\" was Hart's last film and it depicts, in exciting fashion, the opening of the Oklahoma Territory. Hart does some of his fastest riding in the scene of the mad race of the homesteaders to claim land in the Cherokee Strip. Includes a thrilling music score with effects and singing cowboys, but the highlight of our version is the eloquent spoken prologue delivered by Hart himself where he speaks about the glories of his career as a western star and describes, in his Shakespearean voice, how \"Tumbleweeds\" was made. At the end, he bids a moving farewell to his faithful fans .\n\nTHE HEADLESS HORSEMAN (1922)\n\nwith SPOOKS (1931)\n\nand THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN (1934)\n\nTHE HEADLESS HORSEMAN starring Will Rogers, Lois Meredith and Ben Hendricks, Jr. This version of the famous story by Washington Irving was actually shot in and around the environs of Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, New York. It's the story of a new school master, Ichabod Crane (Rogers), who falls in love with Katrina, the daughter of a wealthy farmer. This really annoys Brom Bones, the town roughneck, who wants Katrina for himself. Being the superstitious type, Ichabod believes in tales of ghosts and witches. He even believes in the local phantom, the evil Headless Horseman -- when he meets him one dark night! This re-mastered (October, 2007) version has improved contrast and puts an annoyingly misplaced intertitle back in its proper location. Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nSPOOKS In this sound cartoon, Flip the Frog and his trusty horse are caught outdoors on a stormy night. Seeking shelter, they come upon a spooky house filled with ghosts, skeletons and things that go bump in the night!\n\nTHE HEADLESS HORSEMAN What better to accompany \"The Headless Horseman\" than, well, \"The Headless Horseman\"? This sound Comiclor cartoon was released in the two-color Cinecolor process with very pleasing results. It does a wonderful job of encapsulating Irving's classic tale in only eight minutes time. Plenty of fun and spooky atmosphere!\n\nBIRTH OF A NATION (1915/1930)\n\nand BIRTH OF A NATION SOUND RE-ISSUE TRAILER\n\nTHE BIRTH OF A NATION starring Lillian Gish, Henry B. Walthall, Mae Marsh, George Siegmann, Miriam Cooper and Walter Long. Directed by D.W.Griffith. This is Griffith's controversial masterpiece which, after its release, gave new life to the Ku Klux Klan and caused riots in the streets. One of the first films to demonstrate the influence and strength of the motion picture. Justly famous for it's powerful depiction of the Civil War and justly infamous for it's depiction of black Americans. This version, running just under two hours, is the very rare 1930 sound re-issue with music and effects personally supervised by Griffith. The DVD also contains a rare sound re-issue trailer.\n\nSee below for our special edition of the original 1915 release!\n\nSix great silent shorts on one DVD!\n\nA FESTIVAL OF SILENT COMEDY\n\nAPRIL FOOL (1924) starring Charley Chase, Blanche Mehaffey and Noah Young. It's April 1st and everyone at the newspaper office is having fun with April Fool pranks. Charley, being the victim of most of them, tries to get even. This is a great film filled, naturally, with lots of sight gags. Long thought to be lost, our transfer is made from the only original print known to exist! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nCAUGHT IN THE RAIN (1914) starring Charlie Chaplin, Alice Davenport and Mack Swain. In this, Chaplin's first effort as a director, a drunken Charlie falls for another man's wife in the park. The other man, Mack Swain, is none too pleased when Charlie follows them home and it turns out he lives right across the hall. During the night, the wife walks in her sleep and winds up in Charlie's room! Chaplin's influence as a director is evident in this Keystone film. While there are plenty of laughs and action, the pace is not as frantic as the typical Sennett fare of the time. Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nRECKLESS ROSIE (1929) starring Frances Lee and Billy Engle. In this naughty little pre-code short from the Christie studios, the beautiful Frances Lee, a show girl, is hired to model lingerie at a local fashion show. She is entrusted with a revealing teddy, the new creation and the pride and joy of the lingerie designer. All goes well until the jealous rival of the designer steals the teddy! In addition to being a very good comedy, this film really pulls out the stops. It uses every excuse to show off Frances and her beautiful friends as scantily clad as possible. Guaranteed to raise your eyebrows! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nSMITHY (1924) starring Stan Laurel and James Finlayson. After being discharged from the army due to a bean shortage, Smithy (Stan Laurel) is hired as a house builder. The problem is he knows nothing about building houses which he quickly proves by destroying everything he gets his hands on. His former sergeant (Finlayson), is the unfortunate victim of most of his not so little accidents. When Smithy is mistakenly left in charge, he manages to actually finish the house. All that's left to do is remove the last supporting beam...Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nSOLD AT AUCTION (1923) starring Snub Pollard and James Finlayson. As a baby, Snub is left abandoned in a basket on a stranger's front stoop. Twenty five years later, he's still living in the basket! Snub gets a job helping an auction house sell off their merchandise. They have a large selection of brass knuckles and blackjacks. Snub's job is to demonstrate how these handy items are used -- on him! When Finlayson goes on vacation, Snub and his pals accidentally sell off his furniture. Now Snub's job is to get it all back. This film is absolutely hilarious! The action is almost impossible to describe! It's jammed with comedy, stunts and amazing special effects for the day. A real winner! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nWAR FEATHERS (1926) starring Our Gang. The gang, having a great time playing Cowboys and Indians, are traveling west. Unknown to their parents, they sneak off the train in Hot Dog, a western town full of the real thing! When they find themselves in the middle of a gun fight, they hide in a covered wagon which brings them to Whistling Clam Rancho - the bandits' hideout! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nTHE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1923) starring Lon Chaney, Patsy Ruth Miller, Norman Kerry and Ernest Torrence. Chaney is Quasimodo, the unfortunate deformed bell ringer of the cathedral of Notre Dame. He falls in love with Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer, after she takes pity on him and gives him water to drink when he is chained and whipped in the town square. Esmeralda is later accused of stabbing her lover. She is tortured into making a false confession and sentenced to be executed. Quasimodo rescues her on the very steps of Notre Dame! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nMY BOY (1921)\n\nand PLAYERS AT PLAY (1929)\n\nMY BOY starring Jackie Coogan and Claude Gillingwater. Directed by Albert Austin. Jackie Blair (Coogan) is a young immigrant on his way to America who is orphaned when his mother dies during the voyage. Upon his arrival at Ellis Island, with no guardian or relative to claim him, Jackie faces deportation. Learning of Jackie's misfortune from the officials, Old Captian Hicks (Gillingwater) takes pity on the boy and encourages him to play with the other children. When Jackie gets mixed up with a large family, he is accidentally released and finds himself alone on the city streets where he spots his \"friend\" the captain and follows him home. The captain isn't happy about his new guest and determines to return him to the authorities. That is, until Jackie's affection for the crusty old man begins to melt his heart. This is a lovely film and a great vehicle for Coogan. The sentiment and pathos you'd expect are here, but there are also liberal doses of comedy and action. Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nPLAYERS AT PLAY Here's a neat little short with more stars than you can shake a stick at! It's a \"behind the scenes\" film showing what some of the Hollywood stars do on their time off. We see Neil Hamilton boating, Robert Armstrong boxing, Junior Coghlan playing baseball, Phyllis Haver and Marie Provost playing croquet, Jackie Coogan swimming, Noah Beery fishing and Thelma Todd horseback riding! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nMABEL NORMAND AT THE HAL ROACH STUDIOS: THE 1926 \"SPECIALS\"\n\nThe spirited personality and charm of silent comedienne Mabel Normand and her work in numerous early Mack Sennett comedies is legendary. After a successful run of features for Samuel Goldwyn (and with a handful for Sennett) she took\n\na three year hiatus from films. Towards the end of Normand's short 35 years on earth, she returned to the screen in five starring vehicles for Hal Roach - these were to be her last appearances before a camera.\n\nThe first two of these five comedies were produced and released in late 1926 and were of unusual length for shorts (RAGGEDY ROSE is a five-reeler while THE NICKEL-HOPPER is three reels.) Displaying an interesting mix of soulfulness\n\nand slapstick, it is these Mabel Normand \"specials\" that are featured on this DVD.\n\nRAGGEDY ROSE (1926) The bedraggled Raggedy Rose (Mabel) has the misfortune of working for penny-pinching junk dealer, Moe Ginsberg (Max Davidson). A chance encounter with a wealthy playboy (Carl Miller) sets her dreaming of being a\n\ngrand lady to his prince charming - all the while sorting through mountains of old clothes on Poverty Row. Her dreaming leads to her dismissal. Forlorn and hungry - she meets with an accident and actually ends up convalescing in the posh home of the man of her dreams. But if she's to end up with him, she'll have to overcome his scheming fiance (Anita Garvin) and his loony butler (James Finlayson). Directed by Richard Wallace in collaboration with Stan Laurel!\n\nTHE NICKEL-HOPPER (1926) Overworked Paddy (Mabel) toils as a babysitter by day and a taxi dancer by night. Her drab life is forever complicated by the mashers she encounters at the dance hall (a swarthy Boris Karloff appears as a rather creepy one!) and her lazy and overbearing father (Michael Visaroff) who scares away any prospective suitors. Oliver Hardy appears as a crazed drummer in the dance hall band and James Finlayson as a rattled neighbor. Stan Laurel co-wrote the story and gags. Directed by F. Richard Jones.\n\nIncluded as an \"easter egg\" is the Mack Sennett directed Biograph subject, A DASH THROUGH THE CLOUDS (1912) which features one of Miss Normand's most beguiling early appearances.\n\nAll original music scores composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nLAUREL AND HARDY \"RARITIES\"\n\nThis DVD contains five interesting and unusual films with Stan and Ollie. There are two silent solo shorts in which the boys are prominently featured (but without top billing) each performing hilarious sequences in drag! TREE IN A TEST TUBE shows the boys together in their only existing color film. There's also a brief home movie of Stan and Ollie together in later years as well as footage of Stan Laurel's Funeral.\n\nCUPID'S RIVAL (1917) starring Billy West, Oliver Hardy and Leo White. Here's a rare treat! Billy West does his incredible \"dead-on\" Chaplin impersonation supported by a very young Oliver Hardy (billed here as Babe Hardy). Billy is the janitor and all 'round handy man at a rat infested hotel. Hardy is a starving artist who is so hungry he eats his own dinner plates! He suspects his girl friend (Ethel Burton) is having an affair with a rival artist across the hall and disguises himself as a woman to get to the bottom of things! West, meanwhile, drives everyone in the hotel crazy with his Chaplinesque accidents, stunts and gags. The film culminates in a wild chase and gunfight fueled by alcohol! The accuracy of West's Chaplin is truly uncanny! Presented with an old-time jazz music score.\n\nEVE'S LOVE LETTERS (1927) starring Agnes Ayers, Forrest Stanley and Stan Laurel. Eve and Adam (Ayers and Stanley) are a happily married couple until a mysterious blackmailer threatens to give Adam Eve's love letters to an old flame. Anotole, the butler (Laurel), joins forces with Eve to get the letters from the blackmailer before her husband can see them. This is a fun situation comedy with plenty of gags and Stan masquerading as a woman of loose morals! Presented with an old-time jazz music score.\n\nTREE IN A TEST TUBE (1943) starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Narrated by Pete Smith. This is a wartime film produced to promote wood conservation and is virtually the only existing color film featuring Stan and Ollie. Pete Smith encounters the boys on a quiet street and asks to examine the contents of their suitcase. As they drag out garments and personal belongings, Smith points out that everything they have has been manufactured, in some way, with wood products. It's a real treat seeing the boys in color and, although the film is brief, they find ample opportunity for a few gags! This film is essentially silent with the soundtrack consisting of music, sound effects and, of course, Smith's narration.\n\nLAUREL AND HARDY (1957) starring Laurel and Hardy. This is brief home movie footage made of the boys in their declining years. Hardy, though lively, was quite ill at the time and his thin physique is a bit of a shock. He would pass away in August of that year. In spite of this, the boys appear happy and in good humor. The film was shot by Andy Wade, who was a teenage friend of Stan's. Sadly, Wade also died shortly after making this film. Presented in black and white, silent.\n\nSTAN LAUREL FUNERAL (1965)\n\nThis is news footage from the funeral of Stan Laurel. Many of the stars from the past and present were in attendance including Dick Van Dyke, Buster Keaton, Patsy Kelly, Joe Flynn and Tim Conway (appearing in McHale's Navy at the time), Hal Roach, Jr., Pat Buttram and Alan Mowbray. Pesented in black and white, silent.\n\nLEAP YEAR (1922)\n\nand A CURE FOR POKERITIS (1912)\n\nLEAP YEAR starring Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle. Fatty is a wealthy young man who falls in love with his uncle's nurse. He also has a stutter which afflicts him at times of stress. Unfortunately, Fatty deals with lots of stress when he finds himself engaged to three women at once, none of whom is the woman he truly loves! With plenty of charm and laughter, this is a great example of Arbuckle's feature work. This film, however, was never released due to the scandal that descended upon the innocent star and the resulting public outrage. Presented with an old-time jazz music score.\n\nA CURE FOR POKERITIS starring John Bunny and Flora Finch. The screen's first beloved fat man, John Bunny, plays a\n\nchronic gambler in this fun silent short from Vitagraph, with Flora Finch as his disapproving wife. Bunny comes up with an elaborate scheme to escape the house and join the poker game with the boys. All goes well until he talks in his sleep!\n\nPresented with an old-time jazz music score.\n\nTRILBY (1915)\n\nand A HOUSE DIVIDED (1913)\n\nTRILBY starring Clara Kimball Young and Chester Barnett. Produced in Fort Lee, NJ and directed by Maurice Tournier. Based on the popular novel by George Du Maurier. This is a drama with touches of the supernatural set in Paris. Trilby is an artist's model who is in love with a young painter, but falls into the clutches of the evil hypnotist - Svengali! Presented with color tints and an original music score by Stuart Oderman.\n\nA HOUSE DIVIDED starring Marian Swayne and Fraunie Fraunholz. Directed by Alice Guy Blache. Also shot in Fort Lee, this charming little comedy from the Solax studio tells the story of young Mr. and Mrs. Hutton who have a falling out due to a mutual misunderstanding. They agree to continue living together, but will only communicate through (often insulting) notes. It takes the arrival of a \"burglar\" during a dinner party to bring them together again! Presented with an original music score by Stuart Oderman.\n\nTHE WISHING RING (1914)\n\nand A DAY WITH THE GIPSIES (1906)\n\nTHE WISHING RING starring Vivian Martin and Chester Barnett. Produced in Fort Lee, NJ and directed by Maurice Tournier. A charming little comedy which takes place in merry olde England, Sally (Martin), tries to reconcile the grouchy and gouty Earl of Bateson with his son, Giles (Burnett) who is always getting himself into trouble. Naturally, Sally and Giles fall in love. Together they venture out one evening and visit a band of Gypsies from whom they purchase a magical wishing ring! Presented with color tints and an original music score by Stuart Oderman.\n\nA DAY WITH THE GIPSIES Produced in England by Hepworth Studios, this little gem is an early example of subjective camera in which the viewer becomes a character in the film. A band of Gypsies agree to take a traveler along with them on a day's journey. We stop at a tavern, fortunes are told and we pass through some breathtaking scenery of the English countryside. A delightful and unique treat presented with color tints!\n\nSix great silent shorts on one DVD!\n\nA FESTIVAL OF SILENT COMEDY VOLUME TWO\n\nLUKES MOVIE MUDDLE (1916) starring Harold Lloyd, Snub Pollard and Bebe Daniels. Harold appears as Lonesome Luke in one of his earliest surviving films! Luke runs a movie house and doubles (or triples?) as box office attendant and usher. Snub is the sleepy and inept projectionist. Everything that can go wrong, well goes wrong! Wacky stunts and comic panic are on the program in this fast moving comedy gem! Made from a superb print, this is the very best quality available on DVD! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nHEAVY LOVE (1926) produced by Joe Rock. Starring \"A Ton of Fun\" (\"Fatty\" Alexander, \"Fat\" Karr and \"Kewpie\" Ross) with Lois Boyd. The \"Ton of Fun\" boys are three of the fattest, most inept carpenters who ever drove a nail through a skull. They get themselves a job working for a young lady (Boyd) and end up creating (and subsequently destroying) the wackiest house ever seen. This film is simply hilarious from beginning to end and has to be seen to be believed. It's full of amazing pratfalls, mishaps and terrific stunts. It's a wonder no one was killed making it! Total madness! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nTHE SOILERS (1923) starring Stan Laurel and James Finlayson. This spoof of THE SPOILERS, released earlier the same year, is nearly plotless and features Stan and Fin in a crazy brawl (occasionally interrupted by a rather \"swishy\" cowboy) through practically the entire film! A real knockabout comedy if there ever was one - and lots of fun! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nHE DID AND HE DIDNT (1916) starring Fatty Arbuckle and Mabel Normand. This is one of the most unusual \"comedies\" ever made. Fatty suspects Mabel is having an affair with an old school friend and strangles her in a fit of jealousy! A very dark film and daring for its time, its quite a departure from the usual Keystone fare. It is, however, a comedy. Lets just say eating lobster before bed might give one bad dreams! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nTHE NON-SKID KID (1922) starring Eddie Boland. Heres a very rare Hal Roach comedy featuring a man who is nearly forgotten as a starring comedian. Eddie Boland is, however, one of those \"familiar faces\" who popped up in many supporting roles throughout his career (SUNRISE, THE KID BROTHER). In this delightful film, Eddie stops for gas at a service station that is run entirely by attractive young women. Theyre running the station, by the way, to help out the owner who they accidentally ran over earlier in the day! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nSHOOTIN' INJUNS (1925) starring Our Gang. Another rare Hal Roach comedy in which the Gang, dreaming of being cowboys, embark on a journey to find real Indians to shoot. Along the way, however, they are forced to shelter from a storm in a novelty house intended for an amusement park! This film REALLY pulls out all the stops. Its one of those great scare comedies at which Our Gang excelled. Not only is the house full of elaborate devices, but the film contains some of the most amazing special effects ever seen! Jaw-dropping even by todays standards, this one should not be missed! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nDOCTOR JACK (1922)\n\nand CAPTAIN KIDDS KIDS (1919)\n\nDOCTOR JACK starring Harold Lloyd and Mildred Davis. Harold is a small town doctor whose kindness and homespun remedies endear him to the people of Magnolia Meadows. To cure an old woman of her depression, he summons her son (a busy lawyer) to visit explaining that HE is the cure. Delighted with the results and seeing his mother so happy, the lawyer refers Harold to a \"sick little well girl\" in the city who is currently being treated by a blustering quack. Soon Harolds quick thinking and a brush with \"Humpy Logan\", an escaped lunatic, save the day! Music score arranged and performed by Jack Theakston!\n\nCAPTAIN KIDDS KIDS starring Harold Lloyd and Bebe Daniels. To celebrate his betrothal, Harold throws a wild party and has the hangover to prove it! When his future mother-in-law learns of the escapade, she calls off the wedding and takes Bebe on an ocean voyage to the Canary Islands. Harold boards a ship in hot pursuit and gets tangled up with a crew of female pirates! Music score arranged and performed by Jack Theakston!\n\nSix great silent shorts on one DVD!\n\nA FESTIVAL OF SILENT COMEDY VOLUME THREE\n\nMUDDLED IN MUD (1913) Starring Mabel Normand, Ford Sterling, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy and the Keystone Kops. A Mack Sennett comedy. Here's one of the most famous early Sennett comedies! Ford is dead set on marrying Mabel until another suitor arrives and proposes first. The new couple sneak off to be married in a rowboat to escape Ford's drunken frenzy, but Ford catches on to their plan and drains the lake! Action, gunfire, cannon fire(!), the Keystone Kops and lots and lots of mud! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model! COPS (1922) starring Buster Keaton. Not your typical version, this special edition of COPS includes all of the original titles as well as the often censored \"goat gland\" sequence! Busters girl gives him the air until he can prove himself to be a good business man. In the process he accidentally steals a familys every possession, sets off a bomb and runs from every cop in the city. This is deservedly one of Busters most famous and beloved silent comedies. A real blast! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nWILD PUPPIES (1927) Supervised by George Marshall. A true rarity! After the tremendous success of Hal Roach's \"Our Gang\" series, many of the Hollywood studios tried to get into the act with their own imitations, often with disappointing results. This little film from Fox, however, is very, very good! Levitsky's gang, for playing football on the bully's turf, are threatened with a good pummeling. Our boys, however, are not so easily subdued. They wage an all out war on their rivals that includes trench warfare (with vegetables), a home-made bomber plane, a blimp and a very large, very angry goat! Lots of non-stop action and comedy! It doesn't let up for a second! A real treat! Made from an original amber tinted Kodascope. Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nORANGES AND LEMONS (1923) starring Stan Laurel, Katherine Grant and Eddie Baker. Stan is great in this early solo short! While working at a citrus grove, he manages to enrage his boss and everyone else! Fast moving and filled with great gags from beginning to end! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nBROMO AND JULIET (1926) starring Charley Chase, Oliver Hardy, Corliss Palmer and William Orlamond. Charley gets roped into playing Romeo in an amateur stage production, which is bad enough, but he must also round up his girls drunken dad and get to the show on time! This film is packed with terrific gags from beginning to end. Its simply hysterical and certainly one of Chases very best silent comedies! Oliver Hardy is the frustrated cab driver. Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nTHE BUCCANEERS (1924) starring Our Gang. Mickey and the gang build their own pirate ship and prepare to wreak havoc on the bounding main. Its a great plan until they launch the ship, which promptly sinks like a stone. To keep the gang happy, their pal, Captain Whalen, lets them play on his boat  provided they keep it tied to the dock. When their dog (an early incarnation of Pete without the eye circle) eats the rope, they find themselves drifting on the high seas! This presents no problem for the gang as they start the motor and attack the U.S. Navy! Original music score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nTHE GENERAL (1927)\n\nand SUNDOWN LTD. (1924)\n\nTHE GENERAL starring Buster Keaton and Marion Mack. Long prized by film collectors, this is the Griggs Moviedrome/Essex Films release. This version was justly sought after not only for its visual quality, but also for its wonderful sound track produced by Bob Lee in 1977. The track consists of a terrific Stuart Oderman piano score along with plenty of perfectly timed and appropriate sound effects. It's a real treat! Film prints of this version are still in high demand and command a high price on the used film market.\n\nIn the film, Buster plays a Civil War era railroad engineer who is not allowed to enlist in the Confederate Army since he's more valuable to the south driving his train. This doesn't stop Buster from getting into the action, however, as he foils a gang of Union spies single handed!\n\nSUNDOWN LTD. starring Our Gang. In this fitting companion piece to THE GENERAL, Mickey and the gang are having a blast playing in the railroad yard. After getting kicked out for taking a train on a wild ride, they decide to build one of their own. Their new dog-powered wonder is one of the most ingenious and elaborate contraptions ever seen in an Our Gang film! Jealous Toughy's continuous attempts to wreck it eventually send the gang and their train careening through the streets of Culver City!\n\nAs a bonus, this DVD also contains Keaton's 1961 hidden camera TV show appearance in which he amazes the customers in a diner with a series of hysterical mishaps!\n\nTHE ORIGINAL FELIX THE CAT (1922-1930)\n\nIt's impossible to overstate the immense popularity of Felix the Cat during the 1920s. His films spawned the first merchandising industry ever based on a cartoon character. Felix dolls, clocks and gimmicks were everywhere. In 1928 a figure of Felix was the first image ever transmitted by television. Charles Lindbergh even took a Felix doll mascot along on his historic transatlantic flight!\n\nLooking for a collection of great cartoons? Here's a full baker's dozen from Felix's heyday (don't worry, 13 is a lucky number for a black cat)! Many of these films have never before been released on DVD! Nutty, bizarre and even surreal, these reality-bending little gems are lots of fun. Vintage Felix at his best!\n\nFELIX MINDS THE KID (1922)\n\nFELIX DOPES IT OUT (1924)\n\nFELIX GETS THE CAN (1924)\n\nFELIX TRIFLES WITH TIME (1925)\n\nFELIX THE CAT HUNTS THE HUNTER (1926)\n\nTWO-LIP TIME (1926)\n\nFELIX THE CAT BUSTS A BUBBLE (1926)\n\nFLIM FLAM FILMS (1927)\n\nFELIX THE CAT HITS THE DECK (1927)\n\nOUTDOOR INDORE (1928)\n\nCOMICALAMITIES (1928)\n\nSURE-LOCKED HOMES (1928)\n\nTEE TIME (1930)\n\nELLA CINDERS (1926)\n\nand CINDERELLA CINDERS (1920)\n\nELLA CINDERS stars the cute as a button Colleen Moore in perhaps her best known picture - which casts her as a modern day Cinderella, toiling in a household of persnickety, demanding insufferables. The film diverges from the original fairytale when she wins a contest to work at a Hollywood studio - a plot device similar to that of the Mabel Normand vehicle, THE EXTRA GIRL released a few years prior. The film contains several memorable setpieces including an encounter with a Native American (where she's forced to smoke a cigar and appear to enjoy it) another with Harry Langdon (clearly during the shooting of TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) and the now famous eye exercise routine (via masterful camera trickery.)\n\nCINDERELLA CINDERS gives a rare glimpse of perky, frizzy-haired comedienne Alice Howell. This Reelcraft comedy has her playing a working girl who breaks into society through no fault of her own when asked to pose as royalty at a posh party. Spiked punch adds to the hilarity of the proceedings.\n\nAll original music scores composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nA MORMON MAID (1917)\n\nStarring Mae Murray, Frank Borzage, Hobart Bosworth and Noah Beery.Set in 1840s America, this film is an astonishing exercise in intolerance and bad taste. When the Hogue family are attacked by Indians, they are rescued by a group of Mormons. With their cabin burned to the ground, they join the Mormons to live in their Utah settlement - the borders of which are guarded, and the laws enforced, by the \"Avenging Angels\", four hundred oath-bound fanatics who dress just like the Ku-Klux-Klan.\n\nEverything is just fine for two years but, after that point, things start going down hill.\n\nSomehow resembling, with his remarkable beard, both Abraham Lincoln and the Wolf Man, the evil Mormom leader, Darius Burr, decides to wed the underage Dora Hogue (Murray), making her his fifth wife and child bride. Parental interference is no problem since the Avenging Angels have already killed her father and her mother blew out her own brains when the Mormons forced her husband to take a second wife.\n\nIf you're of the Mormon faith and easily offended, do not buy this DVD. Others should keep duct tape handy to prevent jaws from coming into contact with floors. Made from a gorgeous film source, this one is a real hoot!\n\nOriginal piano score composed and performed by Stuart Oderman.\n\nWILD AND WOOLY (1917)\n\nand SKY HIGH (1922)\n\nWILD AND WOOLY directed by John Emerson, story by Anita Loos. Starring Douglas Fairbanks, Eileen Percy, Sam deGrasse, Charles Stevens, Monte Blue and Bull Montana. Fairbanks is an Easterner in love with the West and when he finally takes a trip out west to oversee his father's railroad, he gets more than he bargained for. Lots of action and comedy. One of the best of the early Fairbanks features!\n\nSKY HIGH directed by Lynn Reynolds. Starring Tom Mix, J. Farrell MacDonald and Eva Novak. A government agent infiltrates a band of smugglers who are illegally transporting Chinese immigrants across the US border. Shot on location at the Grand Canyon, there's action and danger aplenty as Tom tries to protect the beautiful Estelle without blowing his cover. The film's climax comes as Tom races to her rescue by swooping through the canyon aboard a biplane!\n\nOriginal piano scores composed and performed by Stuart Oderman.\n\nTHE LANGDON COLLECTION\n\n\"...the most complex screen character of all the great clowns...\" - William K. Everson\n\nPresented with terrific music scores performed by Bernie Anderson on the Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ!\n\nOften considered in the same pantheon as Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd - Harry Langdon is practically forgotten today. For a short period in the mid-to-late 1920s he was a serious rival to the aforementioned big three with over twenty comedies for producer Mack Sennett, followed by three classic features for First National. The features are available on DVD from Kino as \"Harry Langdon...the forgotten clown\", but the Sennett films have been unavailable on DVD - until now....\n\nThis collection presents five of Langdon's best films from the Sennett Studios - showcasing his childlike elfin character in all his glory! All the films were directed by Harry Edwards - with writing by none other than the legendary Frank Capra. Each film features a magnificent Wurlitzer Theatre pipe organ score by Bernie Anderson, Jr. - which really brings these films to life.

It's all-out mayhem as team members from rival garages compete for a $25,000 purse in free for all road race! A great example of the Sennett studio doing what they did best. Crazy comedy, high speed thrills and breathtaking stunts!\n\nFORGOTTEN SWEETIES (1927) starring Charley Chase and Anita Garvin. Charley, the forgetful husband, discovers his old flame living in an apartment across the hall. This does not set well with Anita, his jealous wife, who decides she and Charley will move to a new home.

When things start looking bad for James, a riot ensues. The police chase Jack all over town as he uses a bicycle, a truck and his wits to get away! Things get a little warm for him when he hides in an outdoor incinerator! This is a very funny film with good production values, plenty of laughs and action! Very few of the comedies produced by Al Christie survive, but this film is a terrific example!\n\nMONKEY BUSINESS (1926) starring Our Gang. What could be better than an Our Gang Comedy? Why, an Our Gang comedy with a monkey, of course! Farina makes friends with a boxing-trained monkey and uses the Chimp's talents to help him beat up his enemies.

Hart, Maude George and Robert McKim. Directed by William S. Hart. Hart portrays \"Blue Blazes\" Rawden, a tough fighting lumber jack of the north woods. While he and his chums are carousing in the local dance hall, Blazes kills \"Ladyfingers\" Hilgard, the villainous proprietor, and becomes the new owner of the hall. When Hilgard's mother and brother arrive from England for a visit, Blazes convinces them that Ladyfingers was a good man who died an honorable death. When the conspiracy begins to crumble, Blazes finds his own life in danger. This is a taught, well acted drama - not typical material for Hart. Very entertaining with beautiful location camera work.\n\nLUBIN'S GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY made by Lubin Studios in 1904. This film was created to capitalize on Edison's wildly popular THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY released the previous year. Far from a new, original production, it's a near shot by shot rip-off of Edison's version which surely caused confusion with contemporary audiences. On its own, it's a well made and fascinating alternate version of one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nOriginal music scores composed and performed by Donald Sosin!\n\nWAY DOWN EAST (1920)\n\nStarring Lillian Gish, Richard Barthelmess and Lowell Sherman. Directed by D.W. Griffith.

When her disgrace is discovered, however, she is ejected from the Squire's house to face certain death in a raging snowstorm and the icy waters of the river! One of Griffith's greatest features, WAY DOWN EAST is still a powerful, moving film. Running 106 minutes, this is the original 1931 re-release with orchestral score.\n\nTHE CONFESSION (1920)\n\nand AMATEUR NIGHT ON THE ARK (1923)\n\nTHE CONFESSION starring Henry B. Walthall, Francis McDonald, William Clifford and Irene Aldwyn. A Catholic priest's faith is put to the test when he hears a confession of murder - a crime of which his brother is falsely accused. He is torn between keeping his holy vows and saving his brother from execution. The brother's escape sparks a manhunt through the Canadian wilderness, but his eventual capture means he must keep his undeserved date with the hangman. A good, solid film with high production values and beautiful location work, this release features a custom organ score and spoken introduction by John Griggs.\n\nAMATEUR NIGHT ON THE ARK In keeping with the theme of theology, here's a reverent re-telling of the story of Noah and his struggle to save humanity and all of God's creatures from...just kidding! This is an early and rare Paul Terry cartoon in which Noah and the animals put on their own crazy, unforgettable show!\n\nTHE SILENT MAN (1917)\n\nand MAKING A STETSON (c. 1925)\n\nTHE SILENT MAN starring William S. Hart, Vola Vale and Robert McKim. After years of toil, a lone prospector finally strikes it rich only to have his claim stolen by ruthless criminals in town. The prospector decides to regain his wealth by becoming a crook himself and stealing it back. One of Hart's very best Westerns and a film that helped define his character of the quiet hero who can only be pushed so far.\n\nMAKING A STETSON Ever wonder where Stetson hats come from? Well, wonder no more! Here's a fascinating tour of the Stetson factory which shows us how these famous hats are made!\n\nDigital orchestral scores composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nHOW MOLLY MALONE MADE GOOD (1915)\n\nStarring Marguerite Clark, Helen Hilton, John Reedy and James Bagley.

To prove herself worthy of the job, she's given the task to interview ten stars of the day within 72 hours. While attempting to complete her assignment, she is plagued by the outlandish schemes of a rival reporter and the unwelcome advances of a lecherous acquaintance. Very entertaining and lots of fun, this film was a clever vehicle to feature contemporary stage stars of the day in cameo appearances. Shot almost entirely on location, the film features fascinating scenery from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nHere are the stars that assist Molly to make good:\n\nLeo Ditrichstein\n\nHenrietta Crossman\n\nRobert Edison\n\nJulia Dean\n\nMabel Fenton\n\nCyril Scott\n\nJulian Eltinge\n\nLulu Glaser\n\nMay Robson\n\nHenry Kolker\n\nMadame Fjorde\n\nCharles J.

It's plot features an illicit affair, a carnival setting and murderous revenge!\n\nTHE GREAT WAR AND THE LITTLE TRAMP\n\nBefore World War II there was of course....World War I (and prior to WWII, it was known as \"The Great War\" - which gives one some idea of the gravitis this war once held in the public consciousness.) This DVD offers some important filmic documents of the period.\n\nAMERICA GOES OVER is \"The first officially released picture record of our part in the World War compiled by military experts.\" Our War Department made available this feature assemblage of riveting and remarkable footage (including scenes of combat) chronicling our WWI involvement, to the home market in 1927 (quite possibly to mark the 10th anniversary of America's entry into the fray.)\n\nSHOULDER ARMS (1918) was Charlie Chaplin's three-reel gift to survivors of The Great War. The comedy was released to great acclaim and success shortly before Armistice and provided very welcome laughter, particularly to returning soldiers. Charlie plays a lowly private who finds himself in the trenches of France, where living conditions are hilariously horrendous. Some of the many highlights include Charlie trying to sleep in flooded quarters, spying as a tree (!) behind enemy lines and posing as a German officer in disguise. The edition presented here is the Pathe reissue from the early 20s and is markedly different (and arguably superior) in takes, camera angles and performances than the later reconstituted version presented in 1959's THE CHAPLIN REVUE.\n\nTHE BOND (1918) [aka \"Charlie Chaplin in a Liberty Loan Appeal\"] Charlie Chaplin was one of a number of Hollywood stars who made live appearances at bond rallies, using their celebrity and popularity to raise funds for the war effort. Chaplin also made this one-reel film to be exhibited expressly for that same purpose. Charlie appears in a series of stylized comic vignettes that demonstrate the bonds of friendship, love, marriage...and the Liberty Bond. Charlie's brother Sydney appears as The Kaiser - a role he also played in SHOULDER ARMS.\n\nTHE SINKING OF THE LUSITANIA (1918) was created by the legendary pioneer animator Winsor McCay and remains a milestone of fluid animation as well as one of the most powerful pieces of wartime propaganda ever created. Despite being released over three years after the actual sinking in May 1915 - the film managed to pack a visceral emotional punch in much the same way that many of the most powerful wartime posters of the day accomplished.\n\nAll of the films in this collection are accompanied by original Wurlitzer pipe organ scores composed and performed by Bernie Anderson!\n\nTHE VAGABOND PRINCE (1916)\n\nand BRONCHO BILLY AND THE BABY (1915)\n\nTHE VAGABOND PRINCE starring H.B.

Some nitrate decomposition is visible.\n\nBoth films are accompanied by original Wurlitzer pipe organ scores composed and performed by Bernie Anderson!\n\nSix great silent shorts on one DVD!\n\nA FESTIVAL OF SILENT COMEDY VOLUME FIVE\n\nLAUGHING GAS (1914) starring Charlie Chaplin, Mack Swain and Slim Summerville.

A delightful and extremely rare feature based upon Defoe's classic tale. Robinson Crusoe is shipwrecked and forced to live alone on a deserted island. Despite his isolation, he finds companionship and adventure. Lively, touching and often humorous, this adaptation truly entertains!\n\nMYSTERY OF DEAD MAN'S ISLE starring Clyde Benson and Edith Johnson. Just off the coast lies the forbidding island known as \"Dead Man's Isle\". Everyone knows that it is uninhabited - or is it? What is the mysterious figure that is sometimes spotted upon its shores? Is it a woman or is it really something supernatural? One brave fisherman decides to find out. Another true rarity!\n\nLINDBERGH'S FLIGHT AND RETURN Rounding out our program of adventure and discovery, we present \"Lindbergh's Flight and Return\" which, through contemporary newsreel footage, chronicles the famous aviator's historic solo Atlantic flight!\n\nOriginal music scores composed and performed by John Mucci!\n\nSix great silent shorts on one DVD!\n\nA FESTIVAL OF SILENT COMEDY VOLUME SIX\n\nA CURE FOR POKERITIS (1912) starring John Bunny and Flora Finch. The screen's first beloved fat man, John Bunny, plays a\n\nchronic gambler in this fun silent short from Vitagraph, with Flora Finch as his disapproving wife. Bunny comes up with an elaborate scheme to escape the house and join the poker game with the boys. All goes well until he talks in his sleep!\n\nA BEDROOM SCANDAL (1921) starring Monty Banks. Newly married Monty works at a ladies fashion boutique where his wandering eyes, not to mention hands, get him into constant trouble. Matters are complicated when his new in-laws decide to visit and meet Monty for the first time.\n\nTHE BAKERY (1921) starring Larry Semon, Norma Nichols, Oliver Hardy and Frank Alexander.

When he gets on the bad side of the bakery's crooked manager (Hardy), however, the dough really starts to fly!\n\nTHE ROPIN FOOL (1922) starring Will Rogers. Not only does the Ropin' Fool (Rogers) lasso cattle, he lassos goats, dogs cats and mice! He even lassos in his sleep!

While staging a violent battle on an empty lot, the gang discover they can earn five dollars by acting in films at the adjacent movie studio. After being being turned down, they decide sneak into the studio and make a film of their own. They are assisted in their escape from a security guard by none other than Harold Lloyd, seen during the making of his classic feature, WHY WORRY?.\n\nMICKEY IN SCHOOL (1927) starring Mickey (Rooney) McGuire. Summer vacation over, Mickey and his gang reluctantly return to school. At first all goes well with Mickey (literally) glued to his seat during lessons. But panic ensues when a simple recess game of tug-o-war leaves the schoolhouse in flames!\n\nOriginal music scores composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nHARDY AS HEAVY (aka \"Bad Guy Babe\")\n\nNO MAN'S LAW (1927)\n\nand THE FALL GUY (1921)\n\nOliver \"Babe\" Hardy is of course best known and most famous for his starring films with Stan Laurel. However, for over a decade before his teaming with Stan, Hardy had already enjoyed quite an extensive career in motion pictures, having appeared in some 300 films. He was often cast as \"the heavy\" (read: villain) and was one of the most prolific character actors of the silent era. And yet no matter how much make-up (or lack thereof) or how his appearance was altered for a role - the telltale mannerisms of this consummate professional always shone through.\n\nTHE FALL GUY is a Vitagraph slapstick \"two-reeler\" starring Larry Semon that's a fine example of the kind of scene-stealing foil that was Hardy's stock and trade - especially in Semon comedies. Hardy plays a bullying \"root-beer hound\", replete with top hat, frock coat and handlebar mustache. He has several encounters with auto-challenged simp Semon - all within a western town setting - which makes an appropriate opener for the accompanying feature....\n\nNO MAN'S LAW is an unusual and ambitious Hal Roach production. A \"five-reeler\" - starring \"Rex - The King of Wild Horses\". The film is a rather hard-edged western (with comic undertones) which serves mostly as a character driven drama. Hardy is at his most scruffy and black-hearted as a wanted desperado - who along with a partner, is on the run. Hardy (who was only months away from his full blown teaming with Stan Laurel) is at his scenery-chewing best in this vehicle, facing off all the principals (including James Finlayson as a prospector and Rex the horse to boot!) Nowhere will you find a more nefarious Ollie then in this daring and imaginatively photographed western.\n\nOriginal music scores composed and performed by John Mucci!\n\nTEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE\n\nTHE AMERICANO (1916)\n\nand Douglas Fairbanks Outtakes\n\nThe always exuberant Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. (in one of his early starring five-reelers for Triangle - directed by John Emerson) plays a young, untried mining engineer sent from New York City to far-away Paragonia to oversee business relations. Doug arrives just in time to uncover a coup involving the imprisonment of the Presidente - who's daughter is about to be forced into a marriage with the head of the Army. All of this, of course, is no match for the ever-smiling, ever-resourceful Doug who will, no doubt, save the day - it's HOW he does it that makes the picture!\n\nThis edition includes a reel of extemely rare production \"rushes\" from two of Fairbanks' later Latin American excursions (THE GAUCHO and DON Q. SON OF ZORRO.)\n\nOriginal music scores composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nTEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE\n\nTHE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) NEW SPECIAL EDITION!\n\nTHE BIRTH OF A NATION starring Lillian Gish, Henry B. Walthall, Mae Marsh, George Siegmann, Miriam Cooper and Walter Long. Directed by D.W.Griffith. Photographed by G.W. Bitzer. In the entire history of the motion picture, no single film has been more praised and condemned than D.W. Griffith's masterpiece, The Birth of a Nation. Praised for its innovation, it's masterful direction and its powerful depiction of the American Civil War and its aftermath. Condemned for its brutal and cruel depiction of African Americans - portrayed mostly by whites in blackface - and for its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. It is also widely believed that The Birth of a Nation was directly responsible for the sudden re-birth of the long dormant Klan.\n\nRegardless of opinion, the effects of The Birth of a Nation on American film cannot be denied. So incredibly successful that the income it generated was beyond calculation. It made instant moguls of its investors and many Hollywood studios were built opon the profits. The Birth of a Nation forever changed the landscape of the motion picture industry.\n\nThis special edition derives from a brand-new digital film transfer. It is presented without tints to preserve and accentuate G.W. Bitzer's masterful black and white photography. This edition features a new original theatre organ score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\nThis is a two DVD set specially priced at $25.00!\n\nSee above for the 1930 re-release version.\n\nA GRIFFITH BIOGRAPH COLLECTION FEATURING MARY PICKFORD\n\nHere is a collection of 12 great films directed by D.W.

Here's a very special DVD set for those of you who think you have, but wish there were more!\n\nTHE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA directed by Rupert Julian with Lon Chaney, Norman Kerry, Mary Philbin, Arthur Edwin Carewe, Gibson Gowland, John Sainpolis and Snitz Edwards. A Universal Super-Jewel. Horror! Thrills! Macabre! \"The Phantom of the Opera\", one of the most famous films ever made, presents the story of a creepy misanthrope who kidnaps a prima donna of the Paris Opera so that she may bring him the love he so madly desires!\n\nThis edition presents a brand-new, needle-sharp transfer of the prized Essex Films/Griggs-Moviedrome version of the 1930 release. Complete with the famous \"man with the lantern\" opening (voiced by John Griggs) and the soaring, exciting pipe organ score performed by Lee Erwin - newly re-mixed for stereo! This is the only authorized release of this much esteemed, copyrighted, version of the film.\n\nThis set includes:\n\n\"Scream Scenes: The Phantom of the Opera\". A short film containing some very unusual title cards believed to be from an earlier version of the film as well as a brief \"lost\" scene of Lon Chaney at the organ. The boudoir scene, long ravaged by nitrate decomposition, appears here in near pristine condition.\n\n\"Theatrical Trailer\". Newly reconstructed. Available nowhere else, our version is taken from several sources and blended together to yield the best, most complete trailer possible.\n\n\"The Phantom of the Opera: 1930 vs. 1925\". An exclusive feature length production created and introduced for this edition by Keith Paynter. Using the 1930 re-release as a foundation, a wide-screen, side-by-side and scene-for-scene comparison is made between the 1930 and the 1925 releases. The sometimes subtle and often unmistakably distinct differences between camera angles, title cards and alternate takes are plainly seen. Fascinating!\n\nTwo complete versions of the 1930 release. Ever since the discovery of the early Technicolor Bal Masque footage, the black and white version of the scene (which is very different in content) has become rather rare. Here we present two versions of the film. One containing the color footage, the other in black and white.\n\nThe original 1925 release. The film as originally presented in 1925, more than 30 minutes longer than the 1930 release. This version contains additional scenes and a more complex story with title cards that also differ from the later release. Though existing sources are only fair in quality, many prefer this original version of the film. It is presented here with the color Bal Masque de l' Opera scene for historic accuracy and a brand-new, spine-tingling pipe organ score composed and performed by Ben Model!\n\n\"Color vs Black and White\". An amazing wide-screen, side-by-side comparison between the Bal Masque de l' Opera scene in color and its black and white counterpart. With commentary by Keith Paynter.\n\nBONUS CHANEY FILM: \"The Light of Faith\" (1922) starring Lon Chaney, Hope Hampton and Dorothy Walters. Directed by Clarence Brown. Chaney portrays Tony Pantelli, a small time crook, who cares for a sick girl and falls in love with her. In an effort to cure her, he steals the recently discovered Holy Grail which glows in the dark and has the power of healing the sick. The film was justifiably praised for it's beautiful photography and is presented here in a new razor-sharp transfer with the lovely original tints and a terrific piano score by Stuart Oderman which has been newly re-mastered for stereo.\n\nSCROOGE (1913)\n\nTHE STORY OF SANTA CLAUS (c. 1925)\n\nand THE TOY SHOP (1928)\n\nSCROOGE starring Seymour Hicks, Leedham Bantock and William Lugg. Seymour (later \"Sir Seymour\") Hicks made a career of portraying Ebenezer Scrooge, possibly Dickens' most memorable character, in \"A Christmas Carol\". He made the first sound film version of the story in 1935 but, twenty-two years earlier, he made this nearly forgotten silent version. Compact and utilizing some primitive but effective special effects, this is a fascinating presentation of the enduring, classic tale.\n\nTHE STORY OF SANTA CLAUS Produced by Cine Art Productions for the home movie market in the mid 1920s. Loosely based upon Clement Clarke Moore's \"The Night Before Christmas\", this delightful little film features scenes of Santa at the North Pole and his journey (through clever animation) to deliver gifts to the good children. He visits one family where dad lends a helping hand. Presented with its original color tints, \"The Story of Santa Claus\" is enchanting.\n\nTHE TOY SHOP Starring Virginia Marshall and Josef Swickard. Directed by Martin Justice. On Christmas Eve in a French village, a little beggar girl, abused by passers-by, is taken in and cared for by the kindly toy maker. Finally safe and warm, she dreams of adorable dancing dolls and toy soldiers. She awakens to a sumptuous Christmas dinner! Presented in its original two-color Technicolor process with the original score.\n\nOriginal music scores composed and performed by John Mucci!\n\nQUEEN OF THE CHORUS (1928)\n\nand LUCIA'S BROKEN ROMANCE (1911)\n\nQUEEN OF THE CHORUS starring Virginia Brown Faire, Rex Lease, Lloyd Whitlock, Betty Francisco and Charles Hill Mailes. Directed by Charles J. Hunt. Gordon Trent is a nasty, greedy millionaire who neglects his wife to philander around town with chorus girls. He relentlessly pursues Queenie Dale, who is actually in love with Trent's private secretary, Billy Cooke. When Trent learns of their romance, he blackmails Queenie into a compromising hotel rendezvous. His intention is to be discovered by his wife's detectives to facilitate his divorce, but also to destroy Queenie and Billy's love forever. Pre-code hijinks abound in this lively and extremely rare feature from the late silent era!\n\nLUCIA'S BROKEN ROMANCE A poor girl, living in a rundown tenement with her parents, has a great talent for the violin. Disgusted by her impoverished family and her surroundings, she runs off on her own to play her violin in the streets. When she is discovered by a great musician she claims to be an orphan and the two begin an affair. But her father, discovering her whereabouts, has other plans for his wayward daughter.\n\nAnother true rarity, very little is known about this Pathe Freres short. We do know that it was produced in the USA in 1911, Gertrude Norman appears in the cast and it was likely directed by James Young Deer.\n\nOriginal music scores composed and performed by John Mucci!\n\nNOSFERATU (1922)\n\nand UN CHIEN ANDALOU (1929)\n\nNOSFERATU starring Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, Greta Schroder and Alexander Granach. Directed by F.W. Murnau. The first and quite possibly the greatest screen version of Dracula, \"Nosferatu\" follows the story of a real estate agent who is sent to close a deal at the castle of a client residing in the wilds of Transylvania. The client, it turns out, is a nightmarish vampire who attacks the agent and then proceeds to spread horror and death throughout the land in his pursuit of his victim's innocent wife. Made without the consent of Bram Stoker's (the author of \"Dracula\") estate, this legendary film was mired in litigation and, consequently, nearly lost forever. This is the Essex Films version of the film, made from the original master print with original translations and titles by Bob Lee. Original music score composed and performed by Stuart Oderman.\n\nUN CHIEN ANDALOU (Le Chien Andalou/The Andalusian Dog) starring Simone Mareuil and Pierre Batcheff. If you find a severed hand in the street, is it OK to poke it with a stick? The creation of Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali, this surreal film is the groundbreaking landmark among avant garde motion pictures. Having virtually no plot, it presents a series of images and vignettes that are alternately funny, provocative and disturbing. Most famous, perhaps, for a scene in which an eye is slit with a razor. Music score compiled and produced by Bob Lee.\n\nMETROPOLIS (1927)\n\nand WILLIS O'BRIEN PRIMITIVES (1915 / 1916)\n\nMETROPOLIS starring Gustav Frohlich, Brigitte Helm, Rudolf Klein-Rogge and Alfred Abel. Directed by Fritz Lang. An outstanding motion picture portrayal of life in the future as envisioned by Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou. Full of amazing sets and imaginative special effects, METROPOLIS tells the story of the privileged leaders of the city and the monotonous, dangerous and burdensome daily life of the repressed workers. When the mad inventor, Rotwang, creates a robot to replace the living workers, the master of Metropolis directs the robot to wreak havoc among them. Our version is the 94 minute standard American release as presented by Essex Films, with original titles and translations created by Bob Lee. For years this version has been highly prized among the film collecting community and this is the only authorized DVD release. Original music score composed and performed by Stuart Oderman.\n\nFrom a glimpse of the distant future, to a glimpse of the distant past...\n\nWILLIS O'BRIEN PRIMITIVES\n\n\"The Dinosaur and the Missing Link\" (1915)\n\n\"R.F.D. 10,000 B.C.\" (1916)\n\n\"Prehistoric Poultry\" (1916)\n\nLong before his outstanding special effects work on such landmark films as THE LOST WORLD, KING KONG and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG, Willis O'Brien was already fascinated by animation and prehistoric life. In these three charming short comedies, we see cavemen interacting with dinosaurs and other primitive life through the use of O'Brien's stop-motion technique. A fascinating look at what was yet to come in the career of a true film pioneer. Presented with vintage jazz music scores..\n\nWHEN THE CLOUDS ROLL BY (1919)\n\nand BURGLARS BOLD (1921)\n\nWHEN THE CLOUDS ROLL BY starring Douglas Fairbanks, Kathleen Clifford, Herbert Grimwood, Frank Campeau and Ralph Lewis. Directed by Victor Fleming. Painfully superstitious Daniel Boone Brown (Doug) is, without his knowledge, being used as a human guinea pig by a crazy doctor who lives in the same New York apartment building. The doctor uses spies and confederates to drive him to the brink of madness. His miserable life improves upon meeting Lucette, who is just as superstitious as he is. When Doug is falsely implicated in a crooked business deal, Lucette leaves him for another man and Doug follows in desperate pursuit. Packed with lots of comedy, stunts and action, this is one of the very best Fairbanks features. Climaxed by an incredible flood scene on a giant scale, this is pure entertainment from beginning to end!\n\nBURGLARS BOLD starring Eddie Boland, Ethel Broadhurst and The Vanity Fair Girls. Directed by Nicholas T. Barrows and produced by Hal Roach. A burglar on the loose, stolen jewels, mistaken identity and a misfired practical joke are all factors that come into play in this delightful, rare short from the Hal Roach Studios. At stake is a jeweled garter with \"a four carat sapphire and over a half pint of rubies\".\n\nOriginal music scores composed and performed by Bernie Anderson!\n\nTEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE\n\nTHE CHAPLIN MUTUALS\n\nwith the famous VAN BEUREN scores and restored footage.\n\nIn terms of quality, presentation and content, this is the definitive DVD collection of the Van Beuren Mutuals! See highlights below.\n\n\"I just finished viewing the Chaplin Mutuals I am very impressed with what you have done with them!!! I cant thank you enough for preserving and restoring these super rare gems I have never seen these films looking so good and correct a REAL treat!!! These are the Mutuals I will be watching from now on!!!\n\nThank you again for all your hard work\n\nAndrea\n\nCharles Chaplin was launched into world fame through his work at Mack Sennett's Keystone studio, followed by fourteen films for Spoor and Anderson's Essanay Film Manufacturing Company. In 1916 he signed with the Mutual Film Company to produce a series of twelve two reel comedies. His salary was an unprecedented $10,000.00 per week in addition to $150,000.00 as a bonus for simply signing the contract.\n\nAfter their original release to great acclaim during 1916 and 1917, this group of films passed through the hands of several distributors for re-release until, in 1932, they were acquired by the Van Beuren Corporation for the sum of $60,000.00. At this point, now well into the sound era, new scores were recorded for the films by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples. The music was punctuated with an array of sound effects - often hilarious in themselves. Deriving from jazz, contemporary and classical pieces, these scores have become almost synonymous with the Chaplin Mutual film series.\n\nThe Chaplin Mutuals, individually and as a body of work, have long been considered a milestone of silent film comedy and acknowledged as among the greatest films ever made. Representing some of his finest work, Chaplin himself counted these films among his personal favorites.\n\nChaplin's classic stock company are all present and accounted for. Edna Purviance, the lovely leading lady, is joined by comedy troopers Albert Austin, Henry Bergman, Leo White, John Rand and James T. Kelly. Chaplin's greatest menace, the wonderful Eric Campbell, died tragically in a car accident at the age of 38 shortly after completing these films. The Chaplin Mutuals represent Campbell's complete body of work on screen.\n\nReelclassicdvd.com is proud to offer the Van Beuren Chaplin Mutuals, presented in the order of their release.\n\nTHE FLOORWALKER\n\n(May 15, 1916)\n\nTHE FIREMAN\n\n(June 12, 1916)\n\nTHE VAGABOND\n\n(July 10, 1916)\n\nONE A.M.\n\n(August 8, 1916)\n\nTHE COUNT\n\n(September 4, 1916)\n\nTHE PAWN SHOP\n\n(October 2, 1916)\n\nBEHIND THE SCREEN\n\n(November 13, 1916)\n\nTHE RINK\n\n(December 4, 1916)\n\nEASY STREET\n\n(January 22, 1917)\n\nTHE CURE\n\n(April 16, 1917)\n\nTHE IMMIGRANT\n\n(June 17, 1917)\n\nTHE ADVENTURER\n\n(October 22, 1917)\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\nThese are brand-new transfers, digitally mastered.\n\nThe films have been speed adjusted (as needed) to a pleasant, breezy pace, while preserving the pitch of the original sound tracks.\n\nMissing titles have been restored and/or replaced in their correct position.\n\nBrightness and contrast have been corrected wherever possible.\n\nMissing footage has been restored to THE IMMIGRANT and EASY STREET.\n\nThis 3 DVD set is specially priced at $34.99.\n\nBEFORE HOLLYWOOD, THERE WAS FORT LEE, NJ (1964)\n\nand THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY (1903)\n\nBEFORE HOLLYWOOD, THE WAS FORT LEE, NJ produced"
