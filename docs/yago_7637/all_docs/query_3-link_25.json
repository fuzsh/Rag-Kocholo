        "text": "Kazaoka becomes new chief aid to emperor\n\nNoriyuki Kazaoka, 65, became the new Grand Steward of the Imperial Household Agency at an attestation ceremony on Friday at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, succeeding Shingo Haketa, 70, who retired. Kazaoka, who served as the vice-grand steward since April 2005, will tackle such issues as reducing the duties of Emperor Akihito, who underwent heart surgery earlier this year, and dealing with proposals for creating imperial families led by female members. Shinichiro Yamamoto, 61, former administrative vice minister of the Cabinet Office, succeeded Kazaoka as the deputy chief of the agency.\n\nJune 01, 2012(Mainichi Japan)\n\n300-member Belgian economic mission to visit Japan in mid-June\n\nA Belgian economic mission of around 300 businesspeople and academics representing over 125 firms and universities will visit Japan from June 10 to 16 to promote bilateral business ties and technological development, the Belgian Embassy in Tokyo said Thursday. The mission, led by Belgian Crown Prince Philippe and accompanied by Didier Reynders, deputy prime minister and minister for foreign affairs, foreign trade, and European affairs, among other ministers, will be the largest such Belgian mission to Japan, the embassy said. [...]\n\nCrown Prince Philippe's visit, on which he will be accompanied by Crown Princess Mathilde, will be his first to Japan since 2005 when he attended the World Exposition in Aichi Prefecture. The royal couple is scheduled to meet members of the Japanese imperial family during the visit.\n\nJune 01, 2012(Mainichi Japan)\n\nPrince Tomohito receives blood transfusion, family visits hospital\n\nPrince Tomohito of Mikasa, a cousin of Emperor Akihito, received a blood transfusion last Friday after undergoing throat cancer-related surgeries earlier this year, sources close to the Imperial Household Agency said Monday. The 66-year-old prince has been hospitalized in Tokyo since December and underwent his 16th cancer-related surgery in March. He remained conscious as of Sunday, the sources said.\n\nOn Sunday, his 96-year-old father Prince Mikasa and mother Princess Yuriko, 89, visited the hospital along with Prince Tomohito's 28-year-old second daughter Princess Yoko.\n\nJune 05, 2012(Mainichi Japan)\n\nPrincess Akiko hastens return to Japan, in view of father's health\n\nPrincess Akiko will cut short her trip to Europe and return to Japan as early as Wednesday due to the worsening health of her father Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, a cousin of Emperor Akihito, Imperial Household Agency sources said Tuesday. The 30-year-old princess, who was initially set to return Friday, has decided on the early return after the 66-year-old prince vomited blood late last week at his hospital in Tokyo, apparently due to bleeding in his throat. [...]\n\nPrincess Akiko, the eldest daughter of the prince, left Japan for Germany last Wednesday to conduct research on Japanese art. She then traveled to Poland and had been staying in Warsaw, where she made a presentation at an international symposium Monday about the Japanese art collection at the British Museum.\n\nJune 05, 2012(Mainichi Japan)\n\nThere goes another of the few male members of the imperial family...\n\nJapan emperor's cousin Prince Tomohito dies at 66\n\nJapan's imperial palace says Prince Tomohito, a cousin of Emperor Akihito, has died after bouts with various ailments. He was 66. Tomohito died Wednesday at a Tokyo hospital. The Imperial Household Agency did not give a cause for his death, but he had battled several illnesses, including throat cancer.\n\nCBS June 06, 2012 07:53 GMT\n\nPrince Tomohito, Japanese emperor’s cousin, dies at 66 after bouts with various ailments\n\nPrince Tomohito, a cousin of Japanese Emperor Akihito, died Wednesday after bouts with various ailments, the Imperial Household Agency said. [...] The Imperial Household Agency did not give a cause of death, but Tomohito had battled several illnesses, including throat cancer. He had undergone several cancer-related operations since 1991 and was treated for alcoholism in 2007. Tomohito was the eldest son of Prince Mikasa and Princess Yuriko. Mikasa is the younger brother of Hirohito, the wartime emperor and father of Akihito.\n\nWashington Post, Wednesday, June 6, 10:18 AM\n\nPrince Tomohito passes away from organ failure\n\nAt 3:35 PM on Wednesday, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa passed away in a Chiyoda Ward hospital in Tokyo. The cousin of Emperor Akihito, 66 year old Prince Tomohito had long suffered from a struggle with alcoholism, and his official cause of death is being reported as multiple organ failure, specifically of the liver. [...]\n\nHis daughter, Princess Akiko, was notified earlier today. Currently researching art in Europe, the princess immediately cut her trip short to come be with her father. She was told that her father had been vomiting blood since late last week, due to complications in his throat. As the first member in the Imperial House of Japan to grow a full beard since the Meiji Emperor, Prince Tomohito was affectionately given the nickname of the “bearded prince” by the public. It is still unknown if Princess Akiko was able to make it back to Tokyo in time to be with her father.\n\nThe Japan Daily Press, June 6, 2012\n\nPrincess Akiko makes early return home in view of father's health\n\nPrincess Akiko returned to Japan from Poland on Wednesday after cutting short her trip to Europe due to the worsening health of her father Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, a cousin of Emperor Akihito. [...]\n\nThe doctor in charge of the prince said Tuesday night that the prince's level of consciousness has been falling, though the situation remains fluid after bleeding inside his mouth following a string of throat cancer-related operations. He added that \"lowering of kidney functions has become a primary concern\" and that doctors are continuing to monitor the situation.\n\nJune 06, 2012(Mainichi Japan)\n\nThe following article, published but five hours ago, is imo a striking example of an attempt to downplay the seriousness of the situation and to keep the public in the dark. Maybe the increase in openness concerning health issues of the imperial family (Emperor's care process grows more open) has, after all, not been so remarkable as some thought...\n\nGov't provides official statement on prince's health\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency said Tuesday that doctors in charge of Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, a cousin of Emperor Akihito, are working to stabilize his condition after bleeding took place inside his mouth on Friday following a string of throat cancer-related surgeries. As the first official statement on the 66-year-old prince's condition, Vice Grand Steward Shinichiro Yamamoto said at a news conference that the doctors \"applied appropriate medical treatments immediately after bleeding took place inside his mouth on Friday afternoon.\"\n\n\"At present, the prince is conscious and they (the doctors) are working to stabilize his condition,\" Yamamoto said. The bleeding \"was not of a large scale and we do not have detailed knowledge concerning its reasons. I hear that the blood was not from the esophagus or other organs,\" he said. Reporters covering imperial matters asked him to provide more details, but Yamamoto said, \"The chief physician will provide explanations when it's necessary to do so.\"\n\nJune 06, 2012(Mainichi Japan)\n\nPrince and Princess Mikasa must have suffered a lot because of their sons´ destinies. Their youngest died of a sudden heart attack when he was but 47, the middle one suffered a series of strokes at age 41 and has been paralyzed from the waist down ever since, and now the oldest has died, too, rather prematurely. But while Prince Takamado´s death came completely unexpected, I suppose that, regarding Prince Tomohito, the family, at least, knew that he would not live many years more. Besides, it cannot have been a very happy life lately, having to remain in hospital all the time...\n\nJapanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visit the residence of Prince Tomohito for mourning.\n\nPrince Tomohito of Mikasa, 66, dies\n\nPrince Tomohito, nicknamed \"the Bearded Prince,\" described his fight against cancer in his book \"Gan wo Kataru\" (\"Talking about Cancer\") published in 1991. He also served in various honorary positions, including as president of the Social Welfare Organization Saiseikai Imperial Gift Foundation.\n\nThe outspoken prince often caused a public stir with his straightforward remarks. In 1982, he said he wanted to renounce his Imperial status to \"devote myself to social activities.\" In November 2005, the prince expressed opposition to a government expert panel's proposal that the Diet revise the law to allow a female-line member of the Imperial family to ascend the throne. Prince Tomohito argued the idea goes against the long-held tradition of the male-line Imperial succession. Expressing any opinions on a political matter to be decided by the Diet is very rare for an Imperial family member.\n\nIn 2007, the prince made public that he was suffering from and was fighting alcoholism. In 2008, he lost his voice due to a cancer-related surgical operation. Even so, he practiced making speeches in English by using an artificial larynx device that generates sounds.\n\nJapan Times, Wednesday, June 6, 2012\n\nOutspoken Japan Prince Tomohito Dies\n\nThe grizzled, goateed prince grabbed headlines when he publicly admitted his problems with alcoholism: “I’m Prince Tomohito, the alcoholic,” he said, mimicking the self-introducing mantra of Alcoholics Anonymous, during a lecture in northern Japan in 2007. He continued to talk openly about his condition, considered a taboo subject in Japan, discussing it candidly during multiple press interviews. He said that it began as a teenager, but intensified later as problems arose within the imperial family, according to media reports at the time. His dependency was a ongoing struggle. In 2009, he was hospitalized for alcoholism five times within a six month period.\n\nMore than his alcoholism, the prince caused a stir for his fervent stance against allowing a female monarchy. [...] “The question is whether it is the right thing to change our unique tradition and history so easily,” Akihito’s cousin, Prince Tomohito, wrote in the private essay distributed to palace officials in the fall of 2005, according to local media reports at the time. “Using concubines, like we used to, is one option. I’m all for it, but this might be a little difficult considering the social climate in and outside the country.” He said concubines would increase the chances of producing a male heir—and was a successful method in the past. He also suggested bringing back former branches of the royal family that were abolished after World War II.\n\nDuring the prince’s life, he was on the organizing committee for the Sapporo Winter Olympics from 1970-1972. He also served as the honorary head of several social welfare organizations as well as of the Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Japan, June 6, 2012, 6:50 PM JST\n\nDo they have such a thing as \"court mourning\" in Japan where the entire family goes into mourning, wearing black and perhaps withdrawing behind palace walls for a period of time when a member of the Imperial Family dies? I would imagine the mourning period would vary depending on the seniority of the family member, an Imperial cousin vs an Emperor or Imperial son?\n\nNot that I know of it. As death is taboo in Shinto (one is rendered spiritually unclean by contact with death/dying), maybe the emperor and other imperial family members will be unable to conduct Shinto rites for some time. But as those rites are considered a private matter, we may in most cases never hear about them anyway, whether they take place or not.\n\nI think, though, that in Shinto there are anniversary ceremonies of the dying day of a person. Besides, in Shinto ancestors are highly revered. I do not know for sure but I suppose that Princess Tomohito and her daughters will have a home shrine where they will offer food, drink and fresh flowers.\n\nNot that I know of it.

After all, she has married into the imperial family who are supposed to be THE representatives of Shinto, \"Shinto incarnate\", so to speak, ever since the Meiji Restoration.\n\nSo would not it be Princess Nobuko´s duty to have a Shinto Shrine for her husband? Or is she free to do whatever she likes in private? Even to regularly hear the mass and go to confession? Would not that be a bit odd for a Shinto princess?\n\nBut would that mean that she would or could refuse to take part in Shinto rites?

Or is she free to do whatever she likes in private? Even to regularly hear the mass and go to confession? Would not that be a bit odd for a Shinto princess?\n\nPrincess's people are Catholic but she may have had to renounce her faith before/upon her marriage. It is not known that she goes to mass but her brother is a regular worshipper. Having said that, the Roman Catholic Church allows the Japanese Catholics to visit the Shinto shrines because they regard it as non-religion that it may not matter to the family. The Imperial Family's religious activities are kept very private because the state does not pay for their Shinto activities.\n\nTalking about the Princess, she is not well either.\n\nPrincess's people are Catholic but she may have had to renounce her faith before/upon her marriage.\n\nThat means it is not even publicly known if she had to renounce her faith or not?\n\nThat is very interesting indeed. As you probably know, in Europe many royal brides have in the past been obliged to convert to the faith of their future husbands´, and this was sometimes a huge problem (a famous example would be Alix of Hesse). In some cases a marriage did not take place for such reasons, sometimes the bride was allowed to keep her faith if she consented to raise her children in the faith of her husband etc. But whatever happened, it was always publicly known because it was considered a very important matter. Even today, I am rather sure that it is known about all European royals to which faith they belong. I am very amazed to hear that, for Japanese royals, this is a private matter.\n\nTalking about the Princess, she is not well either.\n\nDo you mean to say that she has something serious? I hope she is not suffering from cancer, too.\n\nThat means it is not even publicly known if she had to renounce her faith or not?\n\nThat is very interesting indeed.

I hope she is not suffering from cancer, too.\n\nPrincess has been suffering from broncial asthma since 2008 that she has been in and out of hospital.\n\nShintoism is not a religion in a strict sense but is more like a nature and ancestror worship very similar to the Greek and Roman mythologies that there is no code or doctrine to follow. So, accoding to the Vatican, the Catholics are allowed to go to places such as the Yasukuni Jinja. Noone knows if Empress Michiko's faith because she, too, comes from a Catholic family. Princess Takamado's people are supposed to be Anglicans, so I read somehwhere before. It's just so mysterious. Prince Akishino visited Sennyoji (Buddhist temple) recently because there are so many emperors being buried at the temple's ground. After the demise of the Emperor Taisho, the Empress Teimei said prayers from the Lotus Sutra (Kannonkyou) after she worshiped in from of the photograph of her late husband. Shintoism is a pantheic tradition that it may not matter if a person has a specific religious affinity. That may be why some Japanese people may choose to marry at a shinto shrine or a Christian church but may be happy to be sent off by the rite of Buddhism.\n\nI read about Alix of Hesse: it sounded very difficult for her to convert into Russian Orthodox faith from German Lutheran religion. Had she married into the Japanese Imperial Family, she might have been welcomed into the shintoism without conversion because in the world of shintoism, there is no conversion takes place. LOL"
