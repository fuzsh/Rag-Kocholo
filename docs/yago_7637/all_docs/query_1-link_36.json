She is the third daughter and youngest child of Takakichi Asō (麻生太賀吉, Asō Takakichi, 1911–1980), the chairman of the Aso Company (best known originally for its activities in the exploitation of coal mine and metallurgy, but today mainly specialized in cement and in the medical, environmental and real estate) and a member of the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1955. He was also a close associate of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. Her mother, Kazuko Yoshida (吉田和子, Yoshida Kazuko), was the daughter of Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. Her elder brother is the former Prime Minister and current Deputy Prime Minister Tarō Asō.\n\nThrough her paternal grandmother, she descends from a younger branch of the feudal clan Ichinomiya. She is the great-granddaughter of the diplomat Count Nobuaki Makino (牧野伸顕, Makino Nobuaki, 1861–1949) and the great-great-granddaughter of the samurai Ōkubo Toshimichi, famous for having been the cause of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877.\n\nShe studied in England and graduated from Rosslyn House College in 1973.
