        "text": "Japan’s Prince Mikasa, uncle of Emperor Akihito and brother of the wartime emperor Hirohito, turned 100 years old on Wednesday.\n\nThe prince is the oldest member of the imperial family, living through the reign of three different emperors in the Taisho, Showa and Heisei eras. He is the only living royal family member to have served in the military during the Sino-Japanese war and the Pacific theatre of the Second World War.\n\nHe was posted to Nanjing for about a year in 1943, and later expressed guilt over his inability at the time to appreciate the horrors of war. The city was the site of the infamous Nanjing Massacre by Japanese troops in late 1937 and early 1938.\n\n“Nothing will change just because I turn 100 years old,” the prince said in a statement issued through the Imperial Household Agency.\n\n“I'd like to spend my days pleasantly and peacefully while praying for the happiness of people around the world and thanking my wife Yuriko, who has been supporting me for more than 70 years,” the prince said.\n\nThe prince has been in good health after recovering from heart surgery in 2012, an agency official said.\n\nTogether with Princess Yuriko, 92, Prince Mikasa routinely exercises for about 30 minutes a day at their residence in Motoakasaka, Tokyo, according to the agency.\n\nThe prince often reads newspapers and enjoys watching sumo and music programmes on TV, and is often taken for outings in his wheelchair near his residence.\n\nHe rarely goes out for official duties due to his age. But last May, he watched a rehearsal of an ancient equestrian art show at the Imperial Palace and waived cheerfully.\n\nPrince Mikasa was born on December 2, 1915, the fourth son of Emperor Taisho. His eldest brother was Emperor Hirohito, posthumously called Emperor Showa.\n\nThe prince served as an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army after graduating from the army's college. He was posted to Nanjing, China, under a pseudonym for one year from 1943. In a book published after the end of the war, he expressed a sense of guilt over his failure to fully grasp the criminality of war.\n\nPrince Mikasa and Princess Yuriko had three sons and two daughters. Princes Takamado, Tomohito and Katsura have all died, in 2002, 2012, and 2014, respectively.\n\nHe has nine grandchildren, four of whom are official members of the imperial family, and four great-grandchildren.\n\nThe prince is known as a scholar of ancient Oriental history and currently serves as honorary president of the Middle Eastern Culture Centre in Japan and the Japan-Turkey Society."
