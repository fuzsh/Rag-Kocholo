        "text": "Prince Mikasa, the youngest brother of Emperor Hirohito (posthumously known as Emperor Showa) and uncle of Emperor Akihito, died of cardiac arrest on the morning of Oct. 27, the Imperial Household Agency said. He was 100.\n\nHe is the longest-lived member of the Imperial Family since the Meiji Era (1868-1912). All of Emperor Showa's three younger brothers have passed away.\n\nTakaharu Kachi, supervisor of the Imperial Princes' Household Affairs Division, and Hirokazu Nagawa, medical supervisor of the Imperial Household, held a news conference from 10:30 a.m. at the Imperial Household Agency and explained Prince Mikasa's condition in the period before he died.\n\nThey said the Prince had been conscious until around 7:40 a.m. However, his condition worsened after that and his heart pulse slowed down and fell in a state of cardiac arrest at around 8 a.m. His wife, Princess Yuriko, 93, who was also hospitalized at St. Luke's International Hospital in Chuo Ward, Tokyo, for a health checkup, was by his bedside as he passed away at 8:34 a.m.\n\nPrince Mikasa was admitted to St. Luke's on May 16 after being diagnosed with acute pneumonia. He had remained in the hospital because his heart's function declined.\n\n\"He had been in stable condition for a while. However, we were unable to do anything to respond to a decline in his heart function resulting from his advanced age,\" Nagawa said.\n\nPrince Mikasa was born on Dec. 2, 1915 as the fourth son of Emperor Taisho. His childhood name was Prince Sumi. After graduating from Gakushuin Primary School and Gakushuin Boys' Junior High School, the Prince went to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and then to Army War College. He was once stationed in Nanking, China. He was an army major when World War II ended.\n\nPrince Mikasa married Princess Yuriko, second daughter of viscount Masanari Takagi in October 1941 and had three sons and two daughters. Known as a researcher specializing in ancient Oriental history, the Prince had lectured at Tokyo Woman's Christian University and other places. He authored some books including \"Kodai Orientoshi to Watashi\" (\"Ancient Oriental history and me\").\n\nAs a historian, the Prince voiced opposition to reviving the Feb. 11 Empire Day, which was abolished in 1948, as National Founding Day.\n\nPrince Mikasa underwent surgery in July 2012 to treat a heart condition in which the mitral valve situated between left atrium and left ventricle could not be completely closed, causing blood to flow back.\n\nHe last appeared publicly when he waved to well-wishers from the balcony of the Imperial Palace with other members of the Imperial Family on Jan. 2 this year. His last official duty was his meeting with a diplomat, who was about to assume the post of Japanese ambassador to Turkey, at his palace on April 8 this year.\n\nPrince Mikasa's eldest son, Prince Tomohito, and second son, Prince Katsura, died in 2012 and 2014, respectively, both at the age of 66, and his third son, Prince Takamado, passed away in 2002 at the age of 47.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency announced on Oct. 27 that it would cancel Emperor Akihito's autumn garden party scheduled to be held at the Imperial Palace on Nov. 1."
