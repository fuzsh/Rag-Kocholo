        "text": "Japanese prince\n\nPrince Tomohito of Mikasa (寛仁親王, Tomohito Shinnō, 5 January 1946 – 6 June 2012) was a member of the Imperial House of Japan and the eldest son of Takahito, Prince Mikasa and Yuriko, Princess Mikasa. He was a first cousin of Emperor Akihito, and was formerly sixth in the line of succession to the Japanese throne and the heir apparent to the princely house of Mikasa-no-miya and the title \"Prince Mikasa\". Prince Tomohito was the first member of the Imperial House of Japan with a full beard since Emperor Meiji, thus earning him the popular nickname of the \"Bearded Prince\" (ヒゲの殿下 Hige no Denka).[1] He died of cancer on 6 June 2012, aged 66.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince Tomohito was born on 5 January 1946 at Prince Mikasa's family home. He graduated from the Department of Political Studies in the Faculty of Law of Gakushuin University in 1968. From 1968 – 1970, he studied at Magdalen College, University of Oxford, in the United Kingdom.\n\nMarriage and family\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Prince became engaged to Miss Nobuko Asō on 21 May 1980. She is the third daughter of the late Takakichi Asō, chairman of Asō Cement Co., and his wife, Kazuko, the daughter of former Prime Minister, Shigeru Yoshida. She is also the sister of former Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tarō Asō. The couple married on 7 November 1980. Miss Asō was given the title HIH Princess Tomohito of Mikasa. The Prince and Princess had two daughters:\n\nPrincess Akiko (彬子女王, Akiko Joō, born 20 December 1981 in Tokyo)\n\nPrincess Yōko (瑶子女王, Yōko Joō, born 25 October 1983 at Japanese Red Cross Medical Center in Tokyo)\n\nThe family lived in a compound within the Akasaka Estate complex, in Moto-Akasaka, Minato, Tokyo. In October 2009, his wife separated her residence from him and their children.[2]\n\nPublic service\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics, Prince Tomohito served as a committee member on the organizing committee from 1970 until 1972. He was also on the committee for the 1975 Okinawa World Fair.\n\nPrince Tomohito was president and honorary president of various organizations that concerned themselves with cancer research (the Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund), having himself suffered from the disease from 2003, youth education and promotion of international relations. He was also noted for his support of organizations which promoted the welfare of people with physical or mental disabilities through sporting activities, such as skiing, bowling, dancing and rugby. He traveled extensively abroad with the princess on charity, and support missions that concerned matters of illness and welfare. The Prince often gave lectures and contributed articles to national newspapers and magazines, and had also authored seven books. In December 1992, the Prince and Princess visited the United States to support a newly established cancer ward in the New York Medical College, and in 1994, visited Hawaii to support the reconstruction of Kuakini Hospital. In February 1994, the Prince and Princess visited Norway to attend the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.\n\nIn April 1998, the Prince and Princess visited Turkey to attend the opening ceremony of the Turkey-Japan Foundation Cultural Centre. They had previously visited Turkey in 1990 as part of the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of Japan-Turkey relations. The Prince strongly supported the establishment of a Japanese Institute of Anatolian Archaeology at the Middle Eastern Culture Center in Japan, and returned to Turkey again in October 2002, June 2003 and October 2003 leading three groups of benefactors on tours of the heritage of Turkey. In June 1998, Prince Tomohito visited Australia for fundraising activities for a medical science foundation to commemorate the Australian Nobel Prize winner Dr. Howard Walter Florey. In December of the same year, he visited Thailand to attend the 13th Asian Games.\n\nIn April 2003, Prince Tomohito visited Norway accompanied by his daughter, Princess Akiko to attend the World Cross Country Ski Championships for the Visually Disabled.\n\nHe appeared on the radio as a DJ in his younger days.[3]\n\nHealth problems and death\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Prince was first diagnosed with cancer in 1991, but later went into remission. He was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx in 2003, and immediately began treatment for it. In September 2006, he fractured his jaw, which had been weakened by his chemotherapy treatments. In 2007, the Prince made a public announcement that he was suffering from alcoholism, and was undergoing treatments at the Imperial Household Agency hospital.[1] In March 2008, his cancer spread to his pharynx, and he underwent surgery.[4] Although attempts were made to save his voice, he subsequently suffered from pneumonia caused by his inability to properly swallow food, and was thereafter only able to speak with the aid of a mechanical larynx.\n\nOn 6 June 2012, the Prince died from multiple organ failure at the Sasaki Institute Kyoundo Hospital in Tokyo, aged 66.[5] He had been hospitalized for some time, as a result of his multiple cancer diagnoses. Around 660 people attended his funeral, which was held at the Toshimagaoka Imperial Cemetery.[6]\n\nIn June 2013, the Imperial Household Agency stated that they had integrated his family into the household led by his father.[2]\n\nViews on the imperial succession\n\n[edit]\n\nAmid the Japanese imperial succession debate, then-Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi strongly supported the revision of the Imperial Household Law to allow a woman to ascend to the Imperial Throne, pledging to present a bill to the 2006 session of the parliament.[7] Some conservative lawmakers opposed Koizumi and said the debate was premature. Prince Tomohito also opposed the proposal, saying that the official male members of the Japanese imperial family might take up concubines in order to produce male members because it was previously possible for a male illegitimate child to assume the imperial throne. Later he said that this remark was just a joke.[8][9]\n\nTitles and styles\n\n[edit]\n\n5 January 1946 – 6 June 2012: His Imperial Highness Prince Tomohito of Mikasa\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nNational honours\n\n[edit]\n\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (05/06/1966)\n\nForeign honours\n\n[edit]\n\nItaly : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (09/03/1982)[10]\n\nHonorary degree\n\n[edit]\n\nAnkara University\n\nHonorary positions\n\n[edit]\n\nPresident of the Social Welfare Organization Yuai Jyuji Kai\n\nPresident of the Arinomama-sha\n\nPresident of the Social Welfare Organization Saiseikai Imperial Gift Foundation Inc.\n\nPresident of the New Technology Development Foundation\n\nPresident of the Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund\n\nPresident of the Nippon Billiard Association\n\nPresident of the Professional Ski Instructors Association of Japan\n\nPresident of the Collegiate Skating And Ice Hockey Federation\n\nPresident of the Japan-Turkey Society\n\nPresident of the Middle Eastern Culture Center in Japan\n\nHonorary President of the Japan Rugby Football Union\n\nHonorary President of the Japan-British Society\n\nHonorary President of the Norway-Japan Society\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nPatrilineal descent\n\n[edit]\n\nPatrilineal descent[11]\n\nImperial House of Japan\n\nDescent prior to Keitai is unclear to modern historians, but traditionally traced back patrilineally to Emperor Jimmu\n\nEmperor Keitai, ca. 450–534\n\nEmperor Kinmei, 509–571\n\nEmperor Bidatsu, 538–585\n\nPrince Oshisaka, ca. 556–???\n\nEmperor Jomei, 593–641\n\nEmperor Tenji, 626–671\n\nPrince Shiki, ???–716\n\nEmperor Kōnin, 709–786\n\nEmperor Kanmu, 737–806\n\nEmperor Saga, 786–842\n\nEmperor Ninmyō, 810–850\n\nEmperor Kōkō, 830–867\n\nEmperor Uda, 867–931\n\nEmperor Daigo, 885–930\n\nEmperor Murakami, 926–967\n\nEmperor En'yū, 959–991\n\nEmperor Ichijō, 980–1011\n\nEmperor Go-Suzaku, 1009–1045\n\nEmperor Go-Sanjō, 1034–1073\n\nEmperor Shirakawa, 1053–1129\n\nEmperor Horikawa, 1079–1107\n\nEmperor Toba, 1103–1156\n\nEmperor Go-Shirakawa, 1127–1192\n\nEmperor Takakura, 1161–1181\n\nEmperor Go-Toba, 1180–1239\n\nEmperor Tsuchimikado, 1196–1231\n\nEmperor Go-Saga, 1220–1272\n\nEmperor Go-Fukakusa, 1243–1304\n\nEmperor Fushimi, 1265–1317\n\nEmperor Go-Fushimi, 1288–1336\n\nEmperor Kōgon, 1313–1364\n\nEmperor Sukō, 1334–1398\n\nPrince Yoshihito Fushimi, 1351–1416\n\nPrince Sadafusa Fushimi, 1372–1456\n\nEmperor Go-Hanazono, 1419–1471\n\nEmperor Go-Tsuchimikado, 1442–1500\n\nEmperor Go-Kashiwabara, 1464–1526\n\nEmperor Go-Nara, 1495–1557\n\nEmperor Ōgimachi, 1517–1593\n\nPrince Masahito, 1552–1586\n\nEmperor Go-Yōzei, 1572–1617\n\nEmperor Go-Mizunoo, 1596–1680\n\nEmperor Reigen, 1654–1732\n\nEmperor Higashiyama, 1675–1710\n\nPrince Naohito Kanin, 1704–1753\n\nPrince Sukehito Kanin, 1733–1794\n\nEmperor Kōkaku, 1771–1840\n\nEmperor Ninkō, 1800–1846\n\nEmperor Kōmei, 1831–1867\n\nEmperor Meiji, 1852–1912\n\nEmperor Taishō, 1879–1926\n\nTakahito, Prince Mikasa\n\nPrince Tomohito of Mikasa\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
