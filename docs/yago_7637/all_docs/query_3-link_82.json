        "text": "Relatives of the Emperor of Japan\n\nBelow is a list of known relatives of the reigning Emperor of Japan (Akihito). The list includes persons related to the Emperor through blood and marriage. Readers should note the following. First, while Emperor Meiji was the progenitor of the modern Imperial Family, his official consort, the Empress Sh�ken, bore no children. Lady Yanagiwara Naruko, an imperial concubine, was the biological mother of Emperor Taisho and thus the paternal great grandmother of the current Emperor. Second, the list shows the Emperor's known living relatives in both the paternal and maternal lines. These include the surviving brother, nieces, and nephews of the Empress Kojun (Nagako). Third, not all persons on this list are currently (or were ever) members of the Imperial Family. Under the 1947 Imperial Household Law, princesses lose their rank and status upon marriage. The husbands and children of former princesses are not members of the Imperial Family (except in the case of females who may later marry into the Imperial Family).\n\nFather\n\nEmperor Sh�wa (Hirohito, 1901-1989)\n\nEmpress Kojun (born Kuni no miya Nagako Nyo�, 1903-2000)\n\nPaternal Grandparents\n\nEmperor Taish� (Yoshihito, 1879-1925)\n\nEmpress Teimei (born Lady Kujo Sadako, 1884-1951)\n\nMaternal Grandparents\n\nPrince Kuni Kuniyoshi (Kuni no miya Kuniyoshi ō, 1873-1929)\n\nLady Shimazu Chikako� (1879-1956)\n\nPaternal Great Grandparents\n\nEmperor Meiji (Mutsuhito, 1862-1912)\n\nLady Yanagiwara Naruko (1855-1943), imperial concubine\n\nMaternal Great Grandparents\n\nPrince Kuni Asahiko (Kuni no miya Asahiko Shinn�, 1824-1891)\n\nIzume Makiko\n\nLIVING RELATIVES\n\nWife\n\nThe Empress Michiko (nee Shoda Michiko)\n\nChildren\n\nThe Crown Prince (Hiro no miya Naruhito Shinn�), elder son\n\nPrince Akishino (Akishino no miya Fumihito Shinn�), younger son\n\nPrincess Nori (Nor no miya Sayako Naishinn�), daughter\n\nDaughters-in-Law\n\nThe Crown Princess (nee Owada Masako)\n\nPrincess Akishino (nee Kawashima Kiko)\n\nGrandchildren\n\nPrincess Toshi (Toshi no miya Aiko Naishinn�)\n\nPrincess Mako of Akishino (Akishino no miya Mako Naishinn�)\n\nPrincess Kako of Akishino (Akishino no miya Kako Naishinn�)\n\nBrother\n\nPrince Hitachi (Hitachi no miya Masahito Shinn�)\n\nSister-in-Law\n\nPrincess Hitachi (nee Tsugaru Hanako)\n\nSurviving Sisters\n\nMrs. Ikeda Takamasa (formerly Princess Yori; Yori no miya Atsuko Naishinn�)\n\nMrs. Shimazu Hisanaga (formerly Princess Suga; Suga no miya Takako Naishinn�)\n\nSurviving Brothers-in-Law\n\nMr. Ikeda Takamasa\n\nMr. Shimazu Hisanaga\n\nNieces and Nephews\n\nMr. Higashikuni Nobuhiko, eldest son of the late Mrs. Higashikuni Morihiro (formerly Princess Teru)\n\nMrs. Omura Kazutoshi (Fumiko), elder daughter of the late Mrs. Higashikuni Morihiro (formerly Princess Teru)\n\nMr. Higashikuni Naohiko, second son of the late Mrs. Higashikuni Morihiro (formerly Princess Teru)\n\nMr. Mibu Morihiro (nee Higashikuni Hidehiko), third son of the late Mrs. Higashikuni Morihiro (formerly Princess Teru); adopted heir of the Mibu family\n\nMr. Shimazu Yorihisa, only son of Mrs. Shimazu Hisanaga (formerly Princess Teru)\n\nSurviving Paternal Uncle\n\n� Prince Mikasa (Mikasa no miya Takahito Shinn�), youngest brother of Emperor Sh�wa\n\nSurviving Paternal Aunts\n\nPrincess Mikasa (nee Takagi Yoriko), wife of Prince Mikasa (Takahito)\n\nPrincess Takamatsu (nee Tokugawa Kikuko), widow of Prince Takamatsu\n\nSurviving Maternal Uncle\n\nMr. (formerly Count) Higashi-Fushimi Jigo, surviving brother of Empress Kojun\n\nSurviving Maternal Aunt\n\nMrs. (formerly Countess) Higashi-Fushimi Jigo (Yasuko), wife of Higashi-Fushimi Jigo\n\nPaternal First Cousins (children of Prince Mikasa)\n\nMrs. Konoe Tadateru (Yasuko), elder daughter of Prince Mikasa\n\nPrince Tomohito of Mikasa (Mikasa no miya Tomohito Shinn�), eldest son of Prince Mikasa\n\nPrince Katsura (Katsura no miya Yoshihito Shinn�), second son of Prince Mikasa\n\nPrince Takamado (Takamado no miya Norihito Shinn�), third son of Prince Mikasa\n\nMrs. Sen Masayuki (Masako), younger daughter of Prince Mikasa\n\nPaternal First Cousins Once-Removed (grandchildren of Prince Mikasa)\n\nMr. Konoe Tadahiro, only son of Mrs. Konoe Tadateru (Yasuko)\n\nPrincess Akiko (Mikasa no miya Akiko Nyo�), elder daughter of Prince Tomohito\n\nPrincess Yoko (Mikasa no miya Yuko Nyo�), younger daughter of Prince Tomohito\n\nPrincess Tsuguko (Takamado no miya Tsuguko Nyo�), eldest daughter of Prince Takamado\n\nPrincess Noriko (Takamado no miya Noriko Nyo�), second daughter of Prince Takamado\n\nPrincess Ayako (Takamado no miya Ayako Nyo�), third daughter of Prince Takamado\n\nMr. Sen Akifumi, son of Mrs. Sen Masayuki (Masako)\n\nMiss Sen Makiko, daughter of Mrs. Sen Masayuki\n\nMaternal First Cousins"
