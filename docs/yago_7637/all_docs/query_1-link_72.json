        "text": "The religious differences could be a problem. Were there any members of the Japanese Imperial Family who became Christians?\n\nI imagine they'd be in serious trouble with the rest of their kin, given how pre-WWII the Emperor was viewed as a god, but this could have a silver lining--if the Japanese wanted a marital alliance with a Christian state, it would now be much easier.\n\nThat being said, Japan's greater involvement with the outside world came at a time of greater \"scientific\" racism.\n\nNow, if Japan never went isolationist, this marital alliance could occur before the rise of \"scientific racism\" and be much easier, especially if there aren't religious differences.\n\nHowever, that's pre-1900.\n\nHow about if one of the nobility in Europe royally messes up or makes enemies and they are sent to live in Japan as a diplomat and the Japanese government decides to tie into the Royal Family or something.\n\nWhat would be even more interesting is a Romanov ends up marrying into the family and when the revolution sweeps Russia, Japan installs the Emperor as the \"next Romanov\" and keeps Vladivostok\n\nThat might be a good post-1900 scenario. Bonus points if said Romanov is cast out for his marriage (due to the bride being non-Orthodox, non-Christian period, or simply not asking permission), is made Emperor of some rump Siberian state, and we have a permanent split in House Romanov between powerless exiles who have a better dynastic claim and someone who is an actual Russian emperor, albeit a puppet.\n\nHere is an idea:\n\nKing Christian IX of Denmark's daughter Thyra marries into the Imperial family:\n\nThyra: born 1853 marries Emepror Komei (born 1846).\n\nThyra did marry August of Hannover, 3rd duke of Cumberland, but not in this.\n\nTHAT means that Europe/Asia looks like:\n\nFrederik VIII married to Louise from SWEDEN\n\nAlexandra marries Edward VII of UK\n\nGeorge marries Olga from Russia and becomes King of Greece\n\nDagmar marries Alexander III of Russia\n\nValdemar marries Orleans\n\nNow, that will mean than emperor Meiji is related to Nicholas II: Will war with Russia become impossible?\n\nAll will still meet in Denmark for the different shoots at that time. Chr IX was not called \"Europe's father-in-law\" for nothing.\n\nNow, what if one of th emeprors's family is marrying into the American power-circles?\n\nIvan\n\nThe religious differences could be a problem. Were there any members of the Japanese Imperial Family who became Christians?\n\nPrince Asaka converted to Roman Catholicism, but that was in 1951, so he was already a commoner by then. I was under the impression that he was Emperor Showa's uncle, but he's actually the Emperor's uncle-in-law. Also, a quick search on Wikipedia shows that Prince Asaka's claim to the imperial throne is through descent from Emperor Suko (r. 1348-1351), so I don't know if you would personally consider him a member of the Imperial Family (there's also a Northern and Southern Courts issue at play, but I doubt many people would care to discuss it).\n\nThere's at least one member of the Imperial Family that married a Catholic: Prince Mikasa's son Tomohito. I am unconvinced by rumors that the Akihito's brother and wife are actually Christians though. I mean, perhaps Empress Michiko's Catholic family actually did baptize her when she was born, contrary to official claims. To me, that's not enough to convince me that she is actually Catholic.\n\nThe current Empress is FROM a Catholic family, though I don't know if she still practices. Wikipedia lists her religion as simply Shinto.\n\nlink\n\nThe official stance is (at least when I checked 5 minutes ago) that Empress Michiko is not a Christian and that she was not baptized as a Christian. On the last part, I would think that good Catholic fathers and mothers would automatically have their kids baptized, so it seems unusual to me that the Empress' parents would have committed a technical violation of canon law, but I couldn't add anything definitive to this.\n\nMarrying outside the approved aristocratic group would have been unthinkable for the upper echelon of Japan. aside from religious & legal restrictions the politics of Japans leading families were intertwined with who married whom.. It was all as carefully contrived as a Kabuki play. The PoD would need to be in the 19th Century & involve a European power actually exerting enough military & political power to make Japan a colony, something like the British Raj in India. A shotgun marriage in the US vernacular.\n\nEven today the Japanese are loathe to admit the slightest possibility that the Royal family may have been 'contaminated' by Koreans during the ancient Korean invasion. The Korean version is they conquored much of Japan, and replaced a number of Japanese aristocratic families with their own, & intermarried with others. The Japanese version is Korean based pirates briefly disrupted parts of coastal Japan & then were exterminated. Back when I lived in Japan I heard claims Japanese acheologists avoided opening historic sites that might prove one version or another of that era.\n\nPerhaps some expert on Japanese history here can clarify all this for us.\n\nHere is an idea:\n\nKing Christian IX of Denmark's daughter Thyra marries into the Imperial family:\n\nThyra: born 1853 marries Emepror Komei (born 1846).\n\nThyra did marry August of Hannover, 3rd duke of Cumberland, but not in this.\n\nTHAT means that Europe/Asia looks like:\n\nFrederik VIII married to Louise from SWEDEN\n\nAlexandra marries Edward VII of UK\n\nGeorge marries Olga from Russia and becomes King of Greece\n\nDagmar marries Alexander III of Russia\n\nValdemar marries Orleans\n\nNow, that will mean than emperor Meiji is related to Nicholas II: Will war with Russia become impossible?\n\nAll will still meet in Denmark for the different shoots at that time.
