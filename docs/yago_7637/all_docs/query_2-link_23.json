        "text": "Masako Owada, who initially turned down Crown Prince Naruhito's offer of marriage because she was concerned about the life she would lead within the Imperial Family, faces a complex adjustment in her new role as an in-law of Japan's royals.\n\nWHEN Masako Owada pledges her troth to Crown Prince Naruhito, she will be taking on an awesome responsibility as an in-law to Japan's royal family.\n\nWhile she will be learning to adapt to the public pressures of royal life and all its inherent responsibilities, she will also be learning to adjust to a new family behind the scenes.\n\nSo, who are these in-laws? She will be marrying into a family headed by His Majesty Emperor Akihito, who acceded to the throne as Japan's emperor on January 7, 1989, upon the death of Emperor Hirohito (posthumously named Emperor Showa).\n\nIn his first audience with representatives of the nation, Emperor Akihito pledged to observe the constitution and expressed his wish for the further development of the nation, world peace and the promotion of human well-being.\n\nEmperor Akihito was born in Tokyo two days before Christmas, on December 23, 1933, the first son of Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako.\n\nWhile he was Crown Prince, Emperor Akihito studied at Gakushuin elementary, junior high, and senior high schools until 1952, and at Gakushuin University until 1956.\n\nIn addition to his education at Gakushuin, he received private tutoring on many subjects, including the Constitution of Japan.\n\nIn April, 1959, then Crown Prince Akihito married Shoda Michiko (now Her Majesty Empress Michiko), the eldest daughter of the former president of a major flour manufacturing company.\n\nThe late Emperor Hirohito, who was born in Tokyo on April 29, 1901, became the longest reigning (62 years) and the longest-living (87 years) emperor in Japanese history.\n\nHer Majesty, the Empress Dowager Nagako, the eldest daughter of the late Prince Kuni, was born in Tokyo on March 6, 1903.\n\nShe married then Crown Prince Hirohito on January 26, 1924, and became Empress in December, 1926.\n\nEmperor Akihito and Empress Michiko have three children.\n\nThe oldest, His Imperial Highness Crown Prince Naruhito (also known in Japanese as Prince Hiro), was born on February 23, 1960.\n\nTheir Majesties' other two children are Prince Fumihito, who was born on November 30, 1965, and has the title of Aya-no-Miya (Prince Aya), and Princess Sayako, who was born on April 18, 1969, and has the title of Nori-no-Miya (Princess Nori).\n\nPrince Akishino is married to commoner Kiko Kawashima, a university professor's daughter.\n\nEmperor Akihito's younger brother is Prince Hitachi, who married Princess Hanako in September, 1964.\n\nOther members of the Imperial Family include Princess Chichibu, Princess Takamatsu, Prince and Princess Mikasa, Prince and Princess Tomohito of Mikasa, Prince Katsura, and Prince and Princess Takamado.\n\nThe last three princes are sons of Prince Mikasa, who is the younger brother of the late Emperor Hirohito.\n\nPrince Chichibu and Prince Takamatsu, who were younger brothers of the late Emperor, are dead.\n\nWith the abolition of the peerage after the war, only members of the Imperial Family retain princely titles.\n\nThe daughters of the late Emperor Hirohito, who are married, no longer retain their imperial titles.\n\nWith only two years between them, the new Princess should certainly get on with her brother-in-law, Prince Fumihito.\n\nFor those who believe in astrology, the younger prince is, like Masako, a Sagittarian.\n\nAnd her father-in-law is on the cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn.\n\nOf course, marrying into the Imperial Family is a far more serious business than choosing a match by the stars - a fact that no one is more aware of than the bride herself, who, five years after meeting the prince, initially turned down his proposal ofmarriage, concerned about her future court life.\n\nBut he reportedly phoned her night after night to persuade her to accept.\n\nHe eventually won Ms Owada's heart and introduced her to the Emperor and Empress on Christmas Eve."
