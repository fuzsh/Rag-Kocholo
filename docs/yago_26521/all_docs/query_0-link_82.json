        "text": "LOTS 3072-3076 THE CHIA-CHU AND SIAO-MEI CHANG COLLECTION This collection of paintings come from Chia-chu (C.C.) and Siao-mei (S.M.) Chang, a couple on the forefront of China's new consciousness in the transitional period between Republican and Communist governments. Siao-mei Djang came from a wealthy Ningbo family, and was one of the first Chinese female doctoral graduates of the London School of Economics. Dr. Siao-mei Djang was hired by Chang Jia-ao (Chang Kia-ngau), Governor of the Central Bank of China, to be Director of the Research Department. Chang Jia-ao introduced his younger brother Chang Chia-chu, the acting director of the Foreign Trade Bureau to Siao-mei Djang. She was made Director of the Chinese Economics Research Institute due to her many publications focused on South-West China in raw materials and finance. C.C.and S.M. were married in 1934. Although C.C. is often overshadowed by his more famous older brothers, Carsun Chang (Zhang Junmai) and Chang Kia-ngau (Chang Jia-ao), and his wife Siao-mei Djang, Who's Who in China (1918-1950) and British documents on foreign affairs, among other publications describe C.C. Chang as an industrialist, a prominent businessman, promoter of China's foreign trade and General Manager of China Vegetable Oil. C.C. had a great passion for art, literature and music- in 1930, his brother Chang Jia-ao was the producing director for Chinese Opera singer Mei Lanfang in his American tour, and C.C. acted as the \"front man\" in that operation which he felt was one of the highlights of his life. His love for the poet Xu Zhimo was such that he requested one of Xu Zhimo's poems be read at his funeral. C.C.'s family included Chang Jia-sen, Chang Jia-ao, and two sisters, Chang Youyi, who was the first wife of the poet Xu Zhimo. C.C. and S.M. most likely became acquainted with Zhang Daqian in Chongqing, when they were there from 1942 to 1946. They moved to Shanghai in 1946 and from 1949, lived in Japan for four years, and then Sao Paulo, Brazil from 1953 to 1967, and finally to San Francisco from 1967 till 2000. The friendship with Zhang Daqian for C.C. and S.M. further developed when they were in Sao Paulo, Brazil and shared some meals together. The families got to know each other well, and they visited Zhang Daqian from San Francisco when he moved to Carmel. Zhang Daqian was particularly fond of the \"fish tail cooked in chicken fat\" in a favourite restaurant of his in New York, Canton Restaurant on Canal Street, which C.C. and Zhang dined at in 1963. C.C. passed away in 1985 and S.M. passed away in 2000.\n\nZHANG DAQIAN (1899-1983)\n\nTibetan Dancer"
