        "text": "1. Welcome to Cambridge - always pleased to be connected to China or Chinese friends Professor Alan Barrell Celebrating the life and work of a great and famous poet from China who will always be remembered here Honoured to be your guide on our special Cambridge tour\n\n2. Xu Zhimo and Cambridge - joining Nations and Cultures through the Art of Poetry By visiting together the places the poet loved as we reflect on his wonderful words Wandering through pictures, Cambridge, Grantchester and the River Cam - “taking a punt upstream” Reading together Xu Zhimo’s emotional “Goodbye to Cambridge” poem. Perhaps recalling our own “Goodbye”\n\n3. Changhsu Hamilton Hsu originally called Xu Zhangxu was born in Haining, Zhejiang in January 1897. He was educated at Hangzhou High School Peiyang University where he then studied is now Tianjin University. He studied Law in 1916 and moved to Peking University in 1917. Moving to Clark University in Massachusetts USA he earned his bachelor’s degree. After Peking and Clark in USA, Xu Zhimo took a graduate degree in political and social sciences at Columbia University. But he became disillusioned with America. “I find the USA intolerable” he said. He left New York in 1921 to study in England in Cambridge\n\n4. The Cambridge Phenomenon 50 Years of Innovation and Enterprise A Medieval and Creative City and now a Centre of Science and Technology Cambridge today is different in some ways but much is as Xu Zhimo found it in 1921\n\n5. Once in Cambridge, he would have crossed the Mathematical Bridge to enter and wonder at the ancient Tudor Court of Queens College\n\n6. Downing College in the city centre will have impressed him greatly\n\n7. Founded 1347 建立于1347年 Trinity College 三一学院 We don’t know what eventually stimulated Xu Zhimo in the choice of his Cambridge College We know he came here having decided he truly hated being in the USA He must have considered Trinity whose Great Gate is shown here. But a few minutes walk along Trinity Street - he found another College which captured his imagination and won his heart And Xu Zhimo fell in love with English romantic poetry and loved the poems of Keats and Shelley He did many translations into Chinese He became accepted an adopted by Cambridge - where he remains fondly remembered today\n\n8. It was the grandeur of Kings College that eventually won his heart Begun by King Henry 6th in 1441 - some progress through Henry 7th - completed by Henry 8th in 1544\n\n9. The magnificent Kings College Chapel 100 years in the building\n\n10. To live and work here meant Inspiration for a poet! Xu Zhimo loved Cambridge so much\n\n11. “The Backs” of the Colleges embrace the River Cam and Kings has a very special outlook on the river. Imagine Xu Zhumo strolling through these grounds - or resting to watch the punters slowly moving past - on a bright sunny day.\n\n12. The “Bridge of Sighs” St John’s College Like the famous Bridge of Sighs in Venice - linked with feelings of lovers and unrequited love It reminds us that Xu Zhimo’s romantic life was largely unhappy and messy as with other poets like Shelley His first arranged marriage went against his belief in free and simple love. It took a long time for him to escape and find romantic love\n\n13. And all around Cambridge - the peace and calm of Rural England Xu Zhimo came to love the countryside around Cambridge a love reflected in his poems\n\n14. The village and riverside fields of Grantchester - wonderful for walks and picnics A village remembered through the life and untimely death of a famous young English Poet - Rupert Brooke who lived there before his wartime experiences and wrote with passion about the first world war - 1914-1918.\n\n15. Puntung is part of the way of life in Cambridge Xu Zhimo love punting on the River Cam and wrote words about it in his most famous poem\n\n16. “Just to punt a boat upstream - to where the green grass is more verdant” Poetic words of Xu Zhimo which illustrate his passion for punting. So many idyllic spots to stop and enjoy the beauty of the open air\n\n17. Punting boats upstream The best way to visit the Colleges of Cambridge as well as enjoying the scenery around Just as it was when Xu Zhimo was here in Cambridge\n\n18. “The pool under the elm tress holds not water but the rainbow from the sky” Xu Zhimo saw colour and contrast and natural beauty in everything and his words bring us romantic images of simple elements of the natural world “Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight - to sing aloud in the splendour of starlight” The fields and waterways around the City of Cambridge can become more magical at twilight - and the moments joining day to night time\n\n19. Xu Zhimo’s untimely death robbed the world of a great poet. But his words are here forever with us, and his memory is celebrated every day in Cambridge - a great centre of learning and culture At Kings College, his life and times are celebrated in the Chapel and in the Xu Zhimo Memorial Garden where rests the Memorial Stone\n\n20. The beautiful Memorial Garden at Kings A life remembered and cherished - cut short we should remember by a tragic death in 1931 - a young man still - in a plane crash near Tai’an Shandong\n\n21. The memorial stone to Xu Zhimo in Kings College beside the bridge Place of pilgrimage for thousands of Chinese visitors every year\n\n22. So now - I am privileged to read for you the poem many of us know by heart Xu Zhimo’s “Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again”\n\n23. Saying Goodbye to Cambridge again Very quietly I take my leave, as quietly as I came here Quietly I wave goodbye to the rosy clouds in the western sky. The Golden willows by the riverside are young brides in the setting sun: Their reflections on the shining waves always linger in the depth of my heart The floating heart growing in the sludge sways leisurely under the water: In the gentle waves of Cambridge I would be a water plant That pool under the shade of elm trees , holds not water but the rainbow from the sky; Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream To seek a dream? Just to punt a boat upstream to where the green grass is more verdant: Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight, to sing aloud in the splendour of starlight. But I cannot sing aloud, Quietness is my farewell music ; Even summer insects keep silence fore me; Cambridge is soundless tonight! Very quietly I take my leave as quietly as I came here; Gently I flick my sleeves. Not even a wisp of cloud will I bring away\n\n24. Art and Culture connect the peoples of the World’s great Family in spirit and purpose Diversity enhances creativity and innovation. Great Poetry is for everyone Concluding thoughts for us all\n\n25. To emphasise my feelings - I recall being honoured during a visit of a group of students seeking information on Xu Zhimo, and to have my picture drawn by a talented member of the group The same student read the poems of Xu Zhimo together with me - she in Mandarin me in English. Chinese students read Xu Zhimo with far greater feeling and passion than I can manage in English"
