        "text": ".\n\nMeeting Xu Zhimo\n\nby Margaret Coats\n\nThree Chinese girls behind me in the line\n\nEscape King’s College Chapel evensong;\n\nThey show a phone, ask where, at once decline\n\nSought-after seats, to rush away headlong.\n\nThey’re seeking the poetic presence of\n\nNot Milton, not Wordsworth, but Xu Zhimo who wrote\n\nOf Cambridge as his lost, life-changing love\n\nIn lines that millions elsewhere know and quote.\n\nLike Lycidas, he met an early death\n\nSoon after he had visited anew\n\nThe place whose air supplied his poet’s breath:\n\nRomantic English spelled what he would do.\n\nKing’s College holds his words on cloudlike stone;\n\nA Chinese garden translates feelings flown.\n\n.\n\nPoet’s Note\n\nMilton and Wordsworth studied at Cambridge University, as did Edward King, the poet friend for whom Milton wrote the elegy “Lycidas.” Xu Zhimo (1897–1931) planned graduate study at King’s College in economics and politics, but became enthralled by English Romantic poetry. After a year, he returned to China writing romantic and modern verse. During a visit back to Cambridge in 1928, he composed his most famous poem, untitled but often called “A Second Farewell to Cambridge.” A few lines in Chinese are inscribed on a marble memorial stone near a bridge at King’s College. In a small adjacent garden, two stanzas appear line by line with this translation:\n\n.\n\nThe golden willow on the banks of the Cam\n\nStands like a bride in the sunset.\n\nHer reflection shimmers in the water\n\nAnd ripples in my heart.\n\nThe rushes in the soft riverbed\n\nSway and glisten underwater.\n\nI’d gladly be a river reed\n\nTossed by the current of the Cam.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nXu Zhimo’s Cambridge Farewell Poem\n\nparaphrased by Margaret Coats after reading\n\nseveral literal translations\n\nLightly, lightly I leave,\n\nAs lightly as I came,\n\nAnd lightly wave goodbye\n\nTo clouds in the western sky.\n\nThese willows gold at riverside,\n\nA bevy of brides in setting sun;\n\nTheir glimmers, mirrored on the flow,\n\nRippling through my heart have run.\n\nSmooth ribbon weeds with roots in mud,\n\nSplendidly, splendidly sway within\n\nThe gentle waves of River Cam;\n\nA water plant’s play I would win.\n\nUpon that pond in elm tree shade,\n\nA heavenly rainbow, not a spring,\n\nDissolves among the floating grass,\n\nRemains nearby, a dreamlike ring.\n\nWant dreams? Go out and pole a punt\n\nToward grass that’s greener still upstream,\n\nA skiff to glow among the stars,\n\nFreely loaded with sparkling light.\n\nBut freely I sing not.\n\nMy silence says farewell:\n\nThe summer crickets mute,\n\nThe Cambridge evening hushed.\n\nQuietly I leave,\n\nAs quiet as I came;\n\nI slightly shake my sleeve,\n\nTo take no wisp of cloud.\n\n.\n\nOriginal Chinese\n\n再别康橋\n\n輕輕的我走了，\n\n正如我輕輕的來；\n\n我輕輕的招手，\n\n作別西天的雲彩。\n\n那河畔的金柳，\n\n是夕陽中的新娘；\n\n波光裡的艷影，\n\n在我的心頭蕩漾。\n\n軟泥上的青荇，\n\n油油地在水底招搖；\n\n在康河的柔波裡，\n\n我甘心做一條水草！\n\n那榆蔭下的一潭，\n\n不是清泉，是天上虹；\n\n揉碎在浮藻間，\n\n沉澱著彩虹似的夢。\n\n尋夢？撐一支長篙，\n\n向青草更青處漫溯；\n\n滿載一船星輝，\n\n在星輝斑斕裡放歌。\n\n但我不能放歌，\n\n悄悄是別離的笙簫；\n\n夏蟲也為我沉默，\n\n沉默是今晚的康橋！\n\n悄悄的我走了，\n\n正如我悄悄的來；\n\n我揮一揮衣袖，\n\n不帶走一片雲彩。\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMargaret Coats lives in California. She holds a Ph.D. in English and American Literature and Language from Harvard University. She has retired from a career of teaching literature, languages, and writing that included considerable work in homeschooling for her own family and others.\n\nCODEC Stories:"
