        "text": "Tony S. Hsu is the grandson of Xu Zhimo. He was born in Shanghai shortly after the end of World War II. As a toddler, Hsu and his sisters were raised by his grandmother, Zhang Youyi, while his parents pursued their studies in America. In the late 1940s, Zhang and her young charges left China amidst national political turmoil and settled in Hong Kong. At age six, Hsu and his sisters emigrated to New York to join their parents and began a new life in America. Hsu ultimately received his BS in Electrical Engineering from University of Michigan and a Ph.D in Applied Physics from Yale University. He has been an executive for several technology companies. Hsu lives with his fashion designer wife, Lily Pao Hsu, and his filmmaker daughter, Alexandra, in Southern California. Chasing the Modern is his first book."
