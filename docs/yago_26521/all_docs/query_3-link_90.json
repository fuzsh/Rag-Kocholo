        "text": "Xu Zhimo distinguished himself in literary history as one of the most esteemed romantic Chinese poets. But despite his devotion to the written word, Xu proved unfaithful when it came to marital relations ‚Äî and his dalliances may have even extended to one notable literary figure from the West: Nobel Prize-winning author Pearl S. Buck.\n\nThat‚Äôs what Peter Conn, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania, argues in his book Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography:\n\nLossing was unfaithful to Pearl; she said that he ‚Äúhad his women,‚Äù both before and during his marriage to Pearl. Pearl believed that his assorted ‚Äúsilly secret episodes‚Äù repudiated ‚Äúall the mutual fine loyalty of feeling and understanding that makes a marriage real.‚Äù\n\nPerhaps in retaliation, Pearl took a lover, an extraordinary Chinese poet named Hsu Chih-mo (Xu Zhimo). The affair probably began in Shanghai and continued intermittently until Hsu‚Äôs death in a plane crash in November, 1931. The evidence suggests that Pearl had been faithful to Lossing throughout the decade of their marriage. She met Hsu at a time of intense personal need, and apparently found a brief joy that was canceled by the tragedy of his death. ‚Ä¶.\n\nThere was never any question of marriage between Pearl and Hsu. Both were married, and, despite the fantasies of Letter from Peking, neither of them would actually have married across racial lines.\n\nConn further writes that their relationship inspired Buck to commemorate it in her novel Letter from Peking.\n\nHowever, British literary biographer Hilary Spurling disagrees about the existence of such a romantic intrigue in her 2010 work Pearl Buck in China: Journey to the Good Earth:\n\n‚Ä¶[it] seems unlikely if only because he was one of the stars of his literary generation, while she was at best an onlooker on the sidelines, having published no more than a handful of pieces in mission publications and American magazines. None of his biographers have found a shred of evidence for this affair, and the only Chinese witness who knew them both‚Ä¶categorically denied the possibility that Pearl had been Xu‚Äôs lover. ‚Ä¶\n\nNo one in Pearl‚Äôs circle at the time in China, not even her husband, knew anything of this putative affair, apart from a vague assertion made fifty years later by Lillieth Bates that she had heard gossip linking their two names.\n\nSpurling also goes on to quote Pearl Buck‚Äôs late-life companion Theodore Harris (a man who supposedly first posited the idea that Buck‚Äôs awe for Xu Zhimo was more than just a fanciful notion), calling his testimony ‚Äúhighly ambivalent‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄúIt is the privilege of a writer to grasp a situation as it stands and complete it in her own mind,‚Äù he wrote of Pearl‚Äôs relationship with Xu. ‚ÄúIt could have happened. How much actually did is not for us to know.‚Äù\n\nAnd we may never know, unless someone happens to unearth a lost journal or letter that offers more convincing evidence that the two were lovers.\n\nFor those of you wondering what a tryst between Pearl Buck and Xu Zhimo might have looked like, you can read Anchee Min‚Äôs Pearl of China, which includes a fictionalized version of their supposed love affair, or pick up a copy of Pearl Buck‚Äôs Letter from Peking.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you believe Pearl Buck and Xu Zhimo were once lovers?\n\nPhoto credits:\n\nXu Zhimo: By Unknown ‚Äì http://www.dg163.cn/Files/File/2009-9/14/I7JF4K7G5E203339F8.jpg, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17163608\n\nPearl Buck: By Arnold Genthe ‚Äì This image is available from the United States Library of Congress‚Äôs Prints and Photographs division under the digital ID cph.3a12720.

I‚Äôd like to salute five of these women, who in my opinion will always be honorary yangxifu (foreign wives of Chinese men).\n\nPearl S. Buck\n\nPearl Buck didn‚Äôt just make her mark in the literary world with her novels about life in China ‚Äî she also was one of the first to write about love between Chinese men and Western women in East Wind: West Wind . Pearl married twice, both white American men, but some allege she was a secret lover of the famous Chinese poet Xu Chimo. Maybe her supposed affair inspired some of those on-the-page Chinese man-Western woman romances? Who knows, but she‚Äôll always be the ultimate honorary yangxifu in my book. Continue reading ‚ÄúYangxifu Pride: 5 Creative Women Who Should Be Honorary Yangxifu‚Äù\n\nIn lieu of the usual Q&A, I decided to do a post is inspired by a previous Q&A. Specifically, the question I answered two weeks ago about movies with Chinese men and Western women ‚Äî since many movies owe their existence to books, that ultimate writer‚Äôs labor of love (including at least two of the movies on that list). And, even if it is cliche to write this, well, the book usually IS better than the movie. üòâ\n\nSo, here‚Äôs a list of all the books I can think of with Chinese men and Western women in love:\n\nAs the Earth Turns Silver by Alison Wong\n\nAs Katherine struggles to care for two children in New Zealand in the wake of her husband‚Äôs death, she discovers love with the Chinese shopkeeper ‚Äî but must keep it secret because of the racism and prejudice of this era, just on the brink of World War I.
