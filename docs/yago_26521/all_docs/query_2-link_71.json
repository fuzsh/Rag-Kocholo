        "text": "Mr. Xu stood up and slammed the table heavily. \"What are you talking about?! Our child is insensible, but aren't you insensible too? If he's born without a status, he's not a child of our Xu Family. He's a bastard! Our child has to be born in a proper marriage! As for that woman, she just wants to become rich because of her son, so this child has to be aborted.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll get her to abort it.\"\n\n\"What do you plan to do next?\" Seeing that his son had agreed to abort the child, Mr. Xu's expression improved.\n\n\"I still want to marry Youyi.\"\n\nWith a bang, Mrs. Xu smashed a glass. \"She made it sound so unpleasant, but you still want to be with her? Is there something wrong with your brain?\"\n\n\"Mom, no matter what you say today, I want to marry Jiang Youyi.\"\n\n\"Then why are you still fooling around outside? You can't blame her for canceling the wedding now. You can only blame yourself!\" Mrs. Xu even wanted to slap him to wake him up.\n\n\"The woman was just my impulsive mistake. I have no feelings for her. I only love Youyi.\"\n\n\"Let's put this matter aside for now. The most important thing now is to get that woman to abort the child quickly and give her a sum of money to leave the corporation.\"\n\n\"Got it, Dad.\"\n\nAfter talking to his parents, Xu Yuning drove to look for Zhang Meng.\n\nAt this moment, Zhang Meng was still sitting at home, fantasizing about her life as a rich lady who would soar into the sky in the future. She did not know that everyone already knew about the existence of her child. In just one year, she entered the headquarters of the Xu Corporation and was even promoted and given a raise. Xu Yuning even bought her a high-end apartment. Her life now was completely different from before.\n\nZhang Meng could not be said to have exquisite and beautiful facial features, but she was a very charming woman. From a young age, she knew that her obedience and smile could save her a lot of detours. However, she still had to put in a lot of effort to catch a big fish like Xu Yuning.\n\nEveryone in the corporation knew that Xu Yuning had a beautiful girlfriend whom he had liked for five years. Hence, Zhang Meng could only lower Xu Yuning's guard bit by bit when everyone was drunk during the team building. In the end, under the ambiguous atmosphere and Zhang Meng's seduction, the two of them naturally rolled onto the bed.\n\nAfter that, she deliberately did not take any medicine. Indeed, the heavens had blessed her and made her pregnant with Xu Yuning's child.\n\nHence, when Zhang Meng opened the door and saw Xu Yuning, she went up to hug him and buried her head in his firm shoulder.\n\n\"Yuning, you haven't come to see me for a few days. I thought you didn't want me anymore.\"\n\n\"I came here today to tell you something.\"\n\nXu Yuning was not in the mood to date her now. He pulled the woman off him mercilessly and walked into the living room with his shoes on.\n\nZhang Meng had always been good at reading people's expressions. She could tell that there was something wrong with his attitude.\n\n\"Yuning, do you want something to drink?\"\n\n\"There's no need for anything. I'll leave after saying a few words.\"\n\n\"Alright, go ahead.\" Zhang Meng nodded obediently. However, in the next second, she suddenly started retching. She covered her mouth with her hand, and her eyes turned red.\n\nXu Yuning did not say anything, but he had mixed feelings.\n\n\"I've had serious morning sickness recently. I thought it was because the baby was not feeling well. However, the doctor told me that the more serious the morning sickness is, the healthier the baby will be. Looks like there's a naughty boy in my stomach. When he comes out, you must help me beat his butt.\" She was deliberately hinting to Xu Yuning that the child in her stomach was a boy.\n\nXu Yuning let out a shaky breath and said, \"My parents already know about the two of us.\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhang Meng was very surprised. Her eyes widened.\n\n\"Not only my parents, but even Youyi and her entire family already know. Youyi got someone to investigate you some time ago. She even saw your prenatal checkup. That's why she wanted to break up with me.\"\n\n\"How could this be…\" Zhang Meng looked a little confused. \"Yuning, don't tell me you suspect that I deliberately told Third Miss Jiang about us? I really didn't. I've never dreamed of getting any status. I just want to love you silently…\"\n\nXu Yuning sighed. \"I know it wasn't you. This has nothing to do with you.\"\n\n\"It's all my fault… If it weren't for me, Third Miss Jiang wouldn't have broken up with you. I'm a scourge as long as I'm alive. I might as well die.\" Zhang Meng cried as her tears fell to the ground.\n\nShe firmly believed that no man would not be soft-hearted when they saw her tear-stained appearance. Xu Yuning was no exception."
