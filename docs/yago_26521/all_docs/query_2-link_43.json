        "text": "February 15, 2014\n\nI really enjoy Chinese memoirs, but this one disappointed. There were some strong parts- for example, where Yu-i is forced to make it on her own in a foreign country with no knowledge of the language. But for the most part Yu-i conforms to the Confucian norms she grew up with, making for a dull tale of duty. She is not a rebellious character, and strives to the ideal wife, daughter, and daughter-in-law. It's an interesting insight into the mindset of the time, but if you're familiar with Confucian culture, nothing special.\n\nThe story seems to be centered not around Yu-i herself, but her husband Xu Zhimo. He is the one who forces change, he is the one who rebels against society. He behaves horrendously toward Yu-i, first ignoring her for years and then abandoning her and leaving her pregnant and without resources in a foreign country. But both the author and Yu-i herself seem to have the greatest admiration for him, excusing his cruelty as 'an artist's temperament.' At one point the author's grandfather asks her to 'Be kind to Xu Zhimo' and she certainly follows through. I did not enjoy hearing about about the achievements of a person I had grown to hate through the narrative.\n\nI am also disturbed how class is treated in the book. No mention is made of the fabulous wealth and power of Yu-i's social circle, and the reader might be misled to believe these are average people. When she becomes Vice President of China's first women's bank, the position is directly handed to her by her brother. True, she is a very capable person, but she certainly did not have to strive or rebel to achieve her position. In fact, she declines the presidency itself because one of her brothers is already a bank president, and she does not want to lessen the prestige of his position. For a truly powerful memoir of life and struggle in China, I would recommend 'The Spider Eaters' by Rae Yang.\n\nAugust 9, 2014\n\nI was expecting \"Memoirs of a Joy Luck Good Earth\". I was pleasantly disappointed.\n\nDecember 12, 2019\n\nAn interesting life’s story in a rapidly changing China, unevenly executed\n\nWatch people when they win, and you will learn something. But watch them when they lose, and you will learn even more.\n\nGeneral and setting\n\nThe impressive story of an elite Chinese family and how the 20th century influenced them. We follow Chang Yuyi, who looks back on her long life. From an influential family (priding itself on the gift of two palanquins from the emperor) in the vicinity of Shanghai, the Changs have a front row seat on history transforming China from a feudal to a communist country. They know Zhou Enlai, the later prime minister, and family members are factory owners, directors to the Bank of China, founders of the Kwomingtang and famous philosphers.\n\nAlready in the first chapter Yuyi emphasizes that women are nothing and she herself is engaged at age 13 and only narrowly escapes the feet binding. Her household maid is sold to her husbands family at eight, has a few casual gruesome abortions with sharpened twigs and ends up drowning her daughters to avoid starvation.\n\nRespect to elders and magical belief system are also core to the first few years of our narrator growing up. A rice bowl falling at new year foretells misfortune and soothsayers predict if our main character fits with her husband or not. When the answer is not as positive as required, a birth year is pragmatically rearranged to make the marriage between Yuyi and Hsu Chimo possible.\n\nMarriage and becoming independent\n\nHsu Chimo is poet to whom Yuyi initially looks up to, with him studying at Columbia and Cambridge. However he turns out to be unsympathetic and self centered.\n\nThis does lead Yuyi to end up in Cambridge, Paris, Berlin and Hamburg. Here her Chinese beliefs and sense of duty as instilled by her upbringing clash with the western views of her husband.\n\nThe experiences of our main character after her return to China were less interesting in my view. There are some burial rites that are described in fascinating detail. But how the story focusses on her development of a strong relationship with the family in law and the love interests of Hsu Chimo, while China is embroiled in war, feels strange. As reader you note very little of the historic context, people make frequent train trips to the countryside and regularly fly from Shanghai to Beijing like nothing is wrong in the outside world. Even the fall of Shanghai to the Japanese is described in no more than three paragraphs.\n\nThe reason might be that Yuyi is insulated by her family status and wealth; she even becomes a bank’s director because her brother is an important figure at the Bank of China. Not to say that what she achieves is not remarkable, also running a (family financed) clothing store in the evenings after her bank job, but it feels rather nepotistic. In this context her clever investing in certain dies for uniforms during the war, that increase in value hundredfold when supplies run out, feels uncomfortable as well.\n\nThe last chapter, with a surprisingly touching confession that Yuyi never said “I love you” to anyone, made her feel a bit more human and casts a light on her character. I got a faint feeling that more might have happened during the war, and that this might explain the emotional detachment of the narration. However this might be a generous interpretation.\n\nStyle and conclusion\n\nYuyi her story is tragic at times, but it is told in a unemotional and matter of fact way. The book really feels like a woman looking back at her life in a non-fiction/biography kind of way. Some of the deaths and events would not fit a novel well, overall the book is quite uneven in pacing and payoff. I feel that if the main character had not been married to a somewhat famous poet this book might not have been published.\n\nSometimes it was also unclear to me who was the narrator, the author or her great aunt, but then I realised they are in conversation at the start of chapters as the author starts the interview of her great aunt. After this epiphany the reading experience became more logical. However I did not feel that the weaving of the author her own story into the book makes Bound Feet & Western Dress more powerful as a whole.\n\nOverall I liked the first parts of the book due to the insights offered into the traditional Chinese culture, but I found the pacing uneven and the execution plain and sometimes even downright confusing. 2.5 stars rounded down.\n\nAugust 4, 2011\n\nListened to the audio version of this book. Was great to hear the author's voice even though the production quality wasn't all that great.\n\nI have been a fan of Xu Zhimo ever since I read his most famous poem \"Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again.\" It's a beautiful poem and even more beautiful in Chinese. My favorite stanza:\n\n\"Very quietly I take my leave,\n\nAs quietly as I came here;\n\nGently I flick my sleeves,\n\nNot even a wisp of cloud will I bring away.\"\n\nHis poetry is so enchanting, beautiful, fluid.\n\nWell, you can imagine that I was surprised to find out that he's actually kind of a jerk and an irresponsible father.\n\nThis book is about the first wife of the famous Xu Zhimo as told by her grand niece, Natasha Chang. It followed Zhang YouYi's hardships and how she dealt with betrayal, loss, and the ever-changing time period that she lived in. I love reading accounts of Chinese family history. Other books like \"Factory Girls\" by Leslie Chang and \"Falling Leaves\" Adeline Yeh Mah are other great examples where you can learn interesting Chinese family stories.\n\nThe narrative of Zhang YouYi is very well crafted and her grand niece does an excellent job in putting her own reflections without taking away from the main objective of the story. There was just enough of her voice but not too much to distract. She's a good story-teller.\n\nThis is a good read for those who are interested in the history and development of modern China and the thought process of those living in that period.\n\nThe amazing thing about family histories are that they follow one story and so you learn about history through a very focused lens, enough to interest a variety of readers. Stories are the most powerful tools of retelling history.\n\nIf you have any other recommendations of Chinese family histories you would like to share with me, please leave a comment below. I'm planning on reading \"On Gold Mountain\" by Lisa See soon.\n\nAugust 12, 2016\n\nVery enjoyable biography of the author's aunt, with just enough personal story from the author to make this a personal family story rather than a remote biography. This is a small story - the life story of the author's aunt. She's not a hero exactly, though she has moments of extreme grace and strength. She's not a revolutionary, though she was thrust into a more modern life than the one she'd envisioned when she found herself part of one of the first public no fault divorces in China. She lived in interesting times and thus her small story becomes a window into the turning point where China began to incorporate Western ideas. And there's power here.\n\nAnother reviewer called this a dull story of duty. I found it more nuanced than that. This is a story of the way that the political changes manifested and blended in the actions of an individual. On the one hand, Chang Yu-i cannot and does not want to abandon her sense of filial loyalty and responsibility for family, however complicated. On the other hand, she decides to be a modern woman, to stand on her own feet, to draw boundaries -- this I will do, this I will not.\n\nI'm glad I read this.\n\nDecember 5, 2022\n\nI really enjoyed reading this. It was quite sad at some points and I really felt for Chang Yu-i. This book exemplified her strength as being a woman in China going through divorce and the influence of western culture. She continuously kept being dealt bad hands in life but kept on going. Excellent book on Chinese culture and traditions from a female perspective through a woman’s struggle in China.\n\nJuly 26, 2012\n\nI have cried while reading this many times. There are good things to take away, like never, NEVER saying a negative word about your in-laws to ANYBODY. I can see where some hardships could be avoided by living this way. Some of the difficult things included not being able to nurse and raise your own infant/child. In contrast, I LOVED that she nursed until she was SIX, and credits that for her strength and not getting sick! Some of the rules of filiel piety would do the world good today (\"Your body with your hair and your skin is a gift form your parents. You must treasure this gift to be filial.\" kept her from suicide.), and some were sad. Then there were the \"Seven Outs\" for a man to divorce his wife: 1. if she disobeyed his parents, 2. if she could not bear him sons, 3. if she committed adultery, 4. if she acted jealous and was unwilling to take in a concubine, 5. if she were repulsively sick, 6. if she talked too much, 7. if she committed a theft. This glimpse of Chinese culture has shed light on so many areas of understanding for me. It makes me want to study Confucianism~not to adopt the ideas and put them into practice, but to further gain understanding.\n\nA quote that struck me as a Christian, a mom, and a wife was: \"What was it about marriage that turned a woman with a mind of her own into a woman who followed her husband? What was it about being a Chinese wife that you stopped becoming who you might have been?\" I have felt this same way many times~sometimes with a since of awe and pride even, sometimes with a twinge of sadness. (YES! I realize I am sooo blessed compared to the women of old~don't get me wrong!) As I work through my own life and struggle with how to handle feelings and saying too much I still so appreciate and respect the dignity portrayed by a degree stoicism. (My last sentence not having much to do with marriage at all...)\n\nI especially cried when I read of how she felt in America. Not American to the Americans, and not Chinese enough to the Chinese. I don't know how to express all the emotions that go with my thoughts on this, but they are heavy and great. Somehow it gets wrapped up in thoughts for my own children as well~will not being white/black enough be a prevalent struggle in their lives? They have been so blessedly sheltered from racial tension, but we have talked about it. We don't want it to come as a surprise, because it WILL come....\n\nLastly, it was sad to see the breakdown of societal values over time. The dedication and respect and commitment and support to the family and its name. The same thing is going on here today! Of course there are always views that need changing, but there are always some yuckies that creep in at the same time. I'm sure the broken household I was raised in helps to shape my view of sadness here....\n\nJune 18, 2022\n\ncrying . yu-i, I love you so much I hope wherever you are you are resting well 😞❤️ what a beautiful book. don't even know what to say I'm just really appreciative I was allowed to hear yu-i's story ❤️\n\nSeptember 5, 2021\n\nInteresting story, but the way the book is executed detracts from it. There is little insight into the feelings of the characters, which renders the text almost into a dry statement of facts. The duty bound main character personally made it hard for me to relate, and I had to cringe my way through the worse parts of meekly accepted female subservience and humiliation. One of the harshest culture shocks I ever experienced.\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nRead a quarter of this book for 9 days and finished it all off in 3 hours, I only paused for 5 minutes or so for tissues and hot tea. How can I not love this memoir?\n\nAs a wife, as a woman, I wish I could depict Chang Yu-I as a life mentor. And how true her take on love is... What is love, if it has no sense of responsibility!?\n\nJune 1, 2021\n\nSo, there is a mini genre called China Memoirs? Such as Wild Swans, Mao's Last Dancer and Falling Leaves, and Bound Feet and Western Dress is one of them? I found this book in a secondhand book sale at our local library and was surprised that I never heard of it before. I have heard and read many stories about the same historical figures, but I did not know Zhang Youyi (Chang Yu-i) had a biography written by her great-niece.\n\nChang Yu-i, born in a progressive family in China at the turn of 20th century, her feet was unbound, yet her upbringing was very traditional. The teachings she received included \"a woman is nothing\", \"a woman's sole purpose is to serve her men (father, husband and sons)\", etc... In the book, Chang summarized her story perfectly well:\n\nAnd now I understand what my Amah had meant about being \"neither three nor four.\" I was supposed to be a modern girl with big feet, but Hsu Chih-mo treated me as though I had bound feet. He thought me old-fashioned and uneducated, and did not care for me. Yes I was not traditional enough for Lao Taitai. With her bound feet, she was content to spend every day in the female quarters; I wanted to explore the streets of Xiashi.\n\nThis conflict can be seen throughout her life. Deep inside, she was very traditional, but every now and then a burst of courage shone through. After being abandoned while pregnant, she managed to survive and raise her baby son alone in Germany. She did not intend to pursue a banking career but when opportunity arrived, she seized it with no hesitation and proved herself to be worthy and capable. She was always attentive to the needs of her husbands, son and relatives, seldom put her own needs above all. She did things she thought \"proper\" in a time when the meaning of \"proper\" had changed.\n\nBound Feet and Western Dress is not about rebellious spirit or working against odds, which might disappoint readers today. Among her brothers, husband and husband's lovers, Chang Yu-i perhaps was the least famous. It's important to hear her story too. It completes the picture of Hsu Chih-mo, the first mega star of the New Poets of China, widely admired by intellectuals in China and beyond.\n\nToday Hsu Chih-mo is less known outside China and the circle of China scholars, nor is Chang Yu-i's brothers, nor is Lin Huiyin (Hsu romantic lover, who was a great architect). It is worth to mention that they were among the brightest cultural and political stars of pre-1949 China, and the makers of modern Chinese history.\n\nBound Feet & Western Dress also includes the rumination of the author, who, as an American Born Chinese, came to terms with her heritage and upbringing, and reached an understanding of how to be both--American and Chinese.\n\nOctober 29, 2011\n\nThis was possibly the best book that I've ever read. OMG. Okay, maybe not The best on my list, but possibly a tie for second. It was amazing: a lot of detail, great content, and much much more.\n\nI read this in a day, and let me tell you, it amazed me. In all the books on this genre that I'd read, this was a thriller.\n\nA switch between traditional and ancient times, two women, both marked down with 'no value' stand up for their beliefs and show their uniqueness. Strong, they stand up for their rights, and question their actions.\n\nAs culture is streamed through this book, leaking info. of their society and how they struggle reflect their amazing journey. Bound between faith and culture(I'm pretty sure I already said this), the women experience the worst-and their morality ad ethics teach us all--a lesson.\n\n...Okay, my summary might not have been that appealing as the book, but I would definitely recommend it.\n\nJune 26, 2019\n\n3.5 stars\n\nI loved the story and the author had a wonderful way of making me feel like an intimate friend. I learned a lot of interesting things about the Chinese culture, particularly what it was like to be a woman in twentieth century China. My only issue was the way the author/narrator switched between perspectives. It took me a few chapters to get into the swing of recognizing wether Yu-I or Natasha was “speaking”. I would have liked more info regarding Yu-i’s time at the bank and with Doctor. Those areas where only briefly covered which I think says quite a bit about the author. I would recommend for anyone who enjoys reading about the lives of women.\n\nNovember 11, 2019\n\nThis book was so much more enjoyable to read than I expected. I thought it would be depressing, but it's actually a really great story about success and perseverance.\n\nNovember 6, 2022\n\nPe Pang-Mei Natasha Chang am descoperit-o din întâmplate pe Pinterest când căutam cărți de pus pe “Lista cu cărți de citit”. 😅\n\nAm văzut titlul- da, titlul chiar vinde cartea, coperta este evident atrăgătoare din punct de vedere estetic- și mi-am zis: cred că aceasta carte are ceva al ei. Și am avut dreptate.\n\nI-am dat 4 stele fiindcă nu mi-a plăcut prea mult mentalitatea lui Yu-I, intr-un final tot ermetică a rămas, cu o cultură îngropată atât de adânc in ființa ei că nici măcar după ani de viață occidentală nu a putut fi schimbată.\n\nCultura chinezilor de la 1900 încoace, a suferit multe schimbări, însă mi-a fost oarecum greu sa citesc cartea din perspectiva unei tinere femei care trăia ca o “sclavă” la început de secol, intr-o țară plină de curente și schimbări inevitabile.\n\nPlină de informații utile pentru îmbogățirea culturii personale, cu un final destul de plăcut, povestea lui Yun-I te duce intr-o altă lume, care, deși pare îndepărtată, e foarte aproape de noi.\n\nCeea ce nu știm nu ne afectează, nu? Eu acum știu, și mă afectează.\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\nThis was an exercise in \"how long can I read this before I get too angry to continue and put it down until I can tolerate the stupidity and selfishness of the man in this woman's life?\" The answer was not long - I had to come back to this fairly short read several times because I was just so angry at the dismissive way people treated Chinese women back in the early 1900s. Yet at the same time, Yu-I is such a fascinating person; she made her own way without being defiant; she found success. What a life to lead. A fascinating look into the life of a Chinese woman as China started to come into the modern age. Worth reading despite the maddening effect it had on me...or maybe because of it.\n\nMay 14, 2023\n\nI got straight up culture shock from this book. I almost didn’t read it, thinking I wouldn’t be interested or able to understand, but I’m so happy I did! I felt like I learned so much, but it was just such a riveting story. This is definitely one of those books I wish I could read for the first time again.\n\nMay 15, 2022\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever connected to a character from a book so much as I did Yu-I. Her story (which is real) is beautiful, and heartfelt and I am completely in awe of her. Wonderfully written by Pang Mei. I love this book\n\nMarch 15, 2020\n\nTrue look into Chinese history\n\nA very honest and interesting glimpse into not only the central figure, born and raised .in China, but into the author’s struggles, as well, as an American born Chinese.\n\nJuly 3, 2017\n\nI bought this on a whim from a secondhand bookshop and had neither heard of the book, the author, or the subject matter. Despite having no previous reference to this story and the importance of Yu-I and her relationship (or more specifically, the breakdown of her relationship) with Hsü Chih-mo, the gravity of their divorce in 1920s China was clear from the very beginning. Considering this, I was struck by how down-to-earth both Yu-I and the author were about their lives. While I don't doubt that Chang loved to spend time with her Great-Aunt while she was growing up in the states, it was really striking how she had no idea about the cultural and historical importance of her life until she was studying Chinese history at university; I imagine that finding this out must have been a humbling experience for the author.\n\nNot wanting to include any spoilers in the review, I will simply say that Yu-i's life was fascinating and I was always disappointed at the end of a chapter. I particularly liked the sections of self-reflection whereby she questioned her belief in her modernity. My only issue was that the final 30 or so years of her life were whizzed through in a matter of paragraphs and I really feel like they would have been just as interesting to read about. Just because of the event of 1931, it doesn't mean that Yu-i's life had ended and therefore does not mean that the story should end. I'm not sure why her Great-Niece decided not to go into depth on the decades after the 1930s but, not being a fly on the wall of their conversations, I do not know whether Yu-I herself thought that these were not sufficiently interesting as to be written about.\n\nI think that my favourite element of the book was the way that each chapter began with an autobiographical section from Chang before moving on to Yu-i's story. This was a clever way to frame the book and remind me that this wasn't actually an autobiography of Yu-I. I especially liked it when Chang discussed periods of her life from which she drew parallels of Yu-I and, indeed, I found the author's life just as interesting to read about.\n\nNovember 28, 2015\n\nI watched 《人间四月天》/ \"April Rhapsody\" (2000), the 20-episode series based on the life of the famous 20th-century Chinese romantic poet, Xu Zhimo / Hsü Chih-mo (徐志摩 ), on YouTube a few months ago. Unlike most viewers, I liked the character of Hsü Chih-mo's ex-wife, Zhang Youyi / Chang Yu-i (张幼仪), the most. I was amazed by her sheer inner strength to endure all the hardships and cruelty forced upon her by her ex during their marriage. Deeply moved and wow-ed by her bravery and determination in not letting herself be crushed by her daily toil, but to take the chance to transform herself into this independent, accomplished, strong yet kind-hearted, graceful woman!\n\nI wanted to know more about her values and upbringings; to gain some insight into what went through her mind when she was living in Sawston with a husband who constantly reminded her of how much she was not wanted; to see how she struggled to stand on her own two feet, pregnant [with their 2nd son] and abandoned by that cold-hearted poet of a husband, on foreign soil; to find out about her and her son's lives after Hsü Chih-mo died in the fatal plane crash. My mother suggested that I read this memoir written by You-i's great-niece. This book certainly did all that for me. In my opinion, a great read - well-written, engaging, and informative. I see now that the Chinese TV series was very closely based on this book.\n\nNow my respect for You-i increased tenfold. Hsü Chih-mo was regarded as a talented poet, that, he was; but a terrible person, at best, a hypocrite.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 23, 2019\n\nOn the one hand, I truly enjoyed this book. I loved learning about Zhang Youyi 張幼儀 and what life was like for a woman in China in the early part of the 20th century. It was also fascinating to learn more about the famous poet, Xu Zhimo 徐志摩, who was her first husband.\n\nOn the other hand, I was very disappointed that the story basically ended after Xu Zhimo's death in 1931. Zhang Youyi lived until 1988, but the author only talked about her life from 1931 to 1988 in a few brief passages. I can understand that Zhang Youyi was a traditional woman and probably didn't want to consider her life apart from that of her husband, Xu Zhimo. But the author was my age, or even younger. Why didn't the author bother to gather details about the latter part of Zhang Youyi's life? The author had many hours to talk with Zhang Youyi. Why didn't the author ask her more questions about what went on from 1931 to 1988?\n\nIn failing to mention more about Zhang Youyi's life -- especially the part of her life that had nothing to do with the famous poet, Xu Zhimo -- the author seemed to say that Zhang Youyi's life only had meaning when it was connected with Xu Zhimo. That to me seems very sad.\n\nThe author gave many details about how Zhang Youyi was an incredibly strong, vivacious, and intelligent woman. It's too bad the author couldn't have built upon these details -- and wrote about many more! -- to tell the readers a much fuller story of Zhang Youyi's life.\n\nI give \"Bound Feet & Western Dress\" a 7 on a scale of 10.\n\n二零一九年： 第八本书\n\nNovember 15, 2014\n\nWhile the book cover calls this a dual memoir–that of the author and her Great Aunt Yu-i–to me this is more the memoir of Yu-i as verbally told and recreated on the page by her younger relative. It is mainly Yu-i’s story. And what a story it is.\n\nShe was born at the very beginning of the 20th century in China. Times were changing rapidly. During the course of Yu-i’s life, she must learn how to become a more “Western” woman and still show respect for her elders and her heritage by adhering to the traditions that were most important. Yu-i was the first woman in her family not to have her feet bound, and yet when she was married by her family to a man she didn’t know, she acted very traditional, as if she had bound feet.\n\nWhen he divorces her, she must learn to take care of herself and her responsibilities. She describes the change in herself this way:\n\nI always think of my life as “before Germany” and “after Germany.” Before Germany, I was afraid of everything. After Germany, I was afraid of nothing.\n\nYu-i’s story is a triumph of admirable traits, resilience, and a loving family.\n\nAnd who is this man who divorced her? Hsu Chih-mo, arguably the most famous Chinese poet of his time period. Check out this Wikipedia link about him. Why did he divorce her? What happened to her after the divorce? Read. the. book.\n\nApril 25, 2009\n\nAs the title suggests, this is a story that describes two related women, one young and one old, who have struggled with their own identity and their Chinese cultural values. The Chang family was a famous Chinese family. Most male members of the family were scholarly and sent to the west to study. Chang Yu-i, the older woman in the family, became scholarly as well, having been tutored inside and outside of China. The eldest daughter succumbed to an opium addiction.\n\nAlmost the entire family moved away from China, to finally settle in California. Chang Yu-i befriends a young woman in the Chang family and her incredible story is told to her from start to finish. The young woman is the author, Pang-Mei Natasha Chang. Through the elder member of the family, Pang-Mei finds and cherishes her own Chinese heritage, which had always felt uncomfortable for her in a white society that made fun of her frequently as a child.\n\nThis is a wonderful memoir, unlike the others I have read. And it takes place long before the Cultural Revolution, which gives a different aspect of China to the reader.\n\nFebruary 4, 2011\n\n***1/2 Finished Bound Feet and Western Dress today. It felt very conversational, as if you were sitting in on a conversation with Yu-i and Natasha, hearing how they struggled with their own identity, their own sense of self and cultural identity. Yu-i says that in traditional China a girl was nothing, and yet the girls in her family seem valued and well-loved, though due to the family's lack of resources at a critical point they don't end up with the same advantages of education as their brothers. It seemed to me that she was made nothing by the actions of a man seeking to be modern, seeking to be part of a world that he saw as valuing people individually, rather than according to duty and family. Although it is also through this man's actions that she eventually seizes upon her own identity and value and enters the broader world with full force. She is an amazing person in her strength and in her constant giving and support to those to whom she feels tied. I definitely feel the added insight into Chinese culture, into the feelings and reasons for action, that this book provides.\n\nMarch 15, 2014\n\nThe beautifully told story of a remarkable life. Chang Yu-i was born in 1900 to a wealthy Shanghai family, one of 12 children, the second of four daughters. She was the first girl in her family to refuse to have her feet bound, the first to get a divorce, a successful business woman, a bank vice-president, a dutiful daughter and daughter-in-law. Her story is told by her great-niece, a first generation Chinese American who learned of Yu-i's story in her Chinese studies courses at Harvard.\n\nYu-i was married at 15 to a scholar and poet, bore him a son, and left that son with her in-laws to follow her husband to England where he was continuing his studies. When she was pregnant with their second child, he informed her that he wanted a divorce. She was alone in Europe, pregnant, having to navigate her way through the obligations of daughter and daughter-in-law at a distance, finding a way to continue her education. Her return to China was followed by was war, revolution, family upheavals, yet through it all, Yu-i made her own way, maintained her family bonds and lived an exemplary life, ending up in New York where she died at the age of 89.\n\nMarch 26, 2015\n\nI love the idea behind this autobiographical/memoir which mostly focuses on Yu-i, a woman born in China at the beginning of the 20th century who grows up and comes of age as her country moves away from its more traditional ways such as foot binding, arranged marriages, socially accepted concubines, filial responsibilities, and a abhorrent preference for sons. Yu-i's story is told by her 20-something great-niece, Pang-Mei, who was born in Connecticut and is trying to understand her American and Chinese heritage. I loved the story; I loved Yu-i and watching her transform from a subservient woman to a strong independent one who tackled the responsibilities of her life with both Western sensibility and Eastern responsibilities. She truly was an incredible driving force of change and hope for so many Chinese women. That being said, minus one star because I didn't love the writing (this is a first novel) and I didn't love Pang-Mei's additions of her life throughout the book, I felt they were detracting. In creating a dual-perspective story Pang-Mei and/or her editor/publisher did not figure out a way to help the reader determine which woman was being discussed at any given time.\n\nNovember 9, 2014\n\nBound Feet & Western Dress is a nonfiction book telling the stories of Pang-Mei Natasha Chang, a young first generation Chinese American woman, and her great-aunt Chang Yu-i who was born in China in 1900. Pang-Mei Natasha Chang comes across her great-aunt's name in a history book while majoring in Chinese studies and discovers details she had never known about her great-aunt's life before she emigrated to the United States in 1974. After this discovery, she approaches her great-aunt and then writes the account of Chang Yu-i's life as told to her. The story of Chang Yu-i's life gives fascinating details on customs and traditions. Chang not only tells her great-aunt's story, but also tells her own story, transitioning back and forth between the her life and her great-aunt' life. The author describes her own struggles as a modern Chinese young woman growing up in America--the prejudices she encounters and her ongoing search to find her own identity---a mixture of both Chinese and American way. I found this book to be very interesting and well-written."
