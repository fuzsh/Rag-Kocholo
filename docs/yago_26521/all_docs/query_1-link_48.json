        "text": "If you’re a C-pop fan, you may have seen twentieth-century poet Xu Zhimo make an unlikely cameo recently. In the viral hit music video “Greatest Works of Art,” Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou sneaks into the Samaritaine department store in Paris in the middle of the night and plays a magical piano that sends him back in time. As Chou romps through Parisian cafes and elegant Haussmann apartments, he meets some of the greatest artists of the last century, such as René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, Claude Monet, Chinese painter Sanyu, and even piano superstar Lang Lang.\n\nOf course, the best is saved for last, when a bespectacled Xu Zhimo slides into the frame and onto a lush red banquette at an art deco cafe where Chou is enjoying an espresso. Xu Zhimo exuberantly flips through pages of his personal notebook and recites a few lines of poetry for the startled and admiring Chou; the pop star in turn impresses him with a trick of his own. Within the first two weeks the video was released, it received more than 200 million views in China , and many million more since then. Experience the magic for yourself—and then check out this behind-the-scenes making of the video.\n\nTony Hsu, Xu Zhimo’s only grandson, studied electrical engineering at University of Michigan and plasma physics at Yale. So you can imagine it was a surprise to many that Hsu went on to become the bestselling author of Chasing the Modern: The Twentieth-Century Life of Poet Xu Zhimo. The Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Michigan, his alma mater, was delighted by their 1968 graduate's career trajectory and interviewed him about how his years at U-M led him back onto the path of discovering his grandfather. Read all about it on U-M’s The Michigan Engineer.\n\nWe’re excited to announce that Tony Hsu will be speaking at the Center for Asian Studies, University of California at Irvine, as a part of the the Kiang Lecture Series on May 2, 2019. His talk will explore the decade-long journey he went on, traveling through China, England, Japan, Germany, Italy, Russia, and India, to retrace the footsteps of his legendary grandfather, the illustrious poet Xu Zhimo—a man who perished in a tragic plane crash 15 years before Hsu was born.\n\nThe lecture is open to the public and will include a meet-and-greet session afterwards where people can get a signed copy of Tony Hsu’s book Chasing the Modern (both English and Chinese editions will be available). RSVP for your seat here!\n\nIt was an exciting day for Xu Zhimo, the Crescent Moon Society, and Chasing the Modern at UCLA today. The crowds turned up to the Crescent Moon Symposium to hear Tony Hsu, Professor K.K. Cheung, Professor Michelle Yeh, Susan Chan Egan and author Sasha Su-ling Welland. This knowledgeable group spoke about Xu Zhimo's life and poetry, his great friendships with the Crescent Moon Society members and the Bloomsbury Group, and the tumultuous and fascinating period in China and the U.K. in which he lived.\n\nWhen it was Tony's turn at the podium, he spoke about the many journeys he took to discover who his grandfather truly was—a speech that seemed to surprise as well as inform. \"I felt I understood Xu Zhimo so much more deeply after Tony's talk,\" one audience member remarked. \"It was very moving to hear how a grandson searched the world over to get to know his mysterious poet grandfather.\"\n\nHere's a peek at the Crescent Moon festivities:"
