        "text": "8 Nov - Steven Ma was relieved that the first night of his stage play, \"By Chance: Xu Zhimo\", was received positively by the audience.\n\nAs reported on Mingpao News, the actor, who wrote, directed, and acted in the play alongside Mimi Lo and Joey Meng, stated that he was moved to tears to witness the enthusiastic response from the audience.\n\n\"At first I thought I could hold it in, but when I saw that the audience remained in their seats to the end of the show, I couldn't help but shed my tears. Nothing can make a stage actor happier than seeing the audience's reaction. But I shouldn't take the credit on my own,\" he said.\n\nCo-star Joey Meng was also touched by the reception. Her husband, Chan Sap Sam, shared that he was happy for Joey as well, since he knew that the actress didn't have enough time to prepare and was afraid of making mistakes on stage.\n\n\"Fortunately, she was able to give a smooth performance,\" he said.\n\nThe play tells the story of early 20th-century Chinese poet Xu Zhimo, who is well-known much for his poems as his love affairs with three women - Zhang Youyi, Lin Huiyin, and Lu Xiaoman."
