        "text": "Xu Hao's words stunned everyone except Jiang Youyi, including Xu Yuning himself.\n\nHe was shocked and afraid. How did Jiang Youyi discover that he had someone outside? He had always been very careful and had never been photographed by the paparazzi. Why did Jiang Youyi have such a photo?\n\nIgnoring the burning pain on his face, he picked up the documents on the table and flipped through them. It would be fine if he did not read them, but the more he read, the more flustered he became. There were even photos of Zhang Meng registering at the gynecology and obstetrics department. The hospital's blood test report was taken clearly. There were also a few photos taken from the surveillance cameras. They were of Xu Yuning driving into an apartment. The woman in the front passenger seat was Zhang Meng. There was also a photo of the two of them kissing in the car when they were waiting for a red light. All the physical evidence was clearly in front of him. There was no need for him to admit it.\n\n\"Is there anything else you want to say?\" Jiang Youyi looked at Xu Yuning calmly.\n\n\"That's impossible. Everyone knows that my son has been pursuing you humbly ever since he met you. How can he contact another woman in private?\" Mrs. Xu did not believe it. If Xu Yuning really cheated, how could she, as his mother, not know?\n\nHowever, she felt that this woman in the photo looked familiar, as if she had seen her somewhere before.\n\n\"Youyi, it's not what you think…\" Xu Yuning's mind went blank. He had thought of 10,000 possibilities regarding Jiang Youyi's insistence on breaking up with him. Perhaps she was tired of this relationship, or she liked another man, or she was forced to do so. However, he never expected her to discover that he had other women outside.\n\nHow was that possible? He had always been very careful. Usually, he would pick the dead of night when he met Zhang Meng. He even used his WeChat alternate account to contact her. He had never dared to go to a hotel to get a room. He had always been in Zhang Meng's apartment, and the two of them had only been together a few times.\n\n\"Xu Yuning, there's no point in lying anymore now that things have come to this. If you think that this evidence isn't enough for you to give up, I have other things. Do you want to see them?\" Jiang Youyi was very calm from the beginning to the end. She didn't show any pain from being betrayed and was very organized.\n\n\"Youyi, can you forgive me this time? I really know my mistake. I was just impulsive, but you will always be the only person I love. Believe me…\" Xu Yuning said these words with difficulty with a sobbing tone.\n\n\"Son… Is what she said true?\" Mrs. Xu looked at her son in disbelief. She had never expected things to turn out like this. For a moment, she no longer had the aggressive arrogance from before.\n\nXu Yuning did not know how Jiang Youyi got these things, but the only thing he knew was that he did not want to let go at all. He was not lying about one thing. The only person he loved from the beginning to the end was indeed Jiang Youyi. As for Zhang Meng, he really made a mistake out of passion. After all, five years of consideration and care could not be faked without love.\n\n\"You knew that this was wrong long ago, but you still did it. This is not a mistake, but your choice. There's no point in saying this now.\" Jiang Youyi looked at the man in front of her coldly.\n\n\"Sister Youyi, calm down first. Our entire family knows how much my brother likes you. Can you forgive him this time? I've long treated you as my sister-in-law. I'll help you keep an eye on him in the future. If he dares to make another mistake, our entire family won't let him off!\" Xu Pingping liked her sister-in-law from the bottom of her heart because Jiang Youyi was a simple and pure person.\n\n\"Pingping, if you were me and found out that your fiancé had an affair when you were about to get married and that woman was pregnant with his child, would you forgive him?\" Jiang Youyi asked calmly.\n\nXu Pingping couldn't say a word. If it were her, she would definitely make the other party pay a painful price! Just breaking off the engagement was too easy on him!\n\nNo woman could tolerate her fiancé having a mistress before marriage, and that woman was pregnant with his child. Unless it was a marriage that had no love at all and was only formed for benefits.\n\n\"Youyi, I deserve to die. I really deserve to die…\" Xu Yuning stood up and walked to Jiang Youyi, wanting to hold her hand.\n\nJiang Nian hurriedly stood up and shielded his sister. \"Stay away from my sister.\"\n\n\"Brother, I swear to you that I'll treat Youyi well after I get married and won't make similar mistakes again. Can you help me persuade her?\""
