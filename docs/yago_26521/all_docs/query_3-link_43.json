        "text": "(The last chapter felt poorly written, so I added another paragraph today.)\n\nTianjin, Nankai University.\n\nXu Zhimo, in a suit, is preaching his poetry concept to the school teachers and students: \"There are really good people, really bad people, fake people and useless people. Poetry, there are also real poems, bad poems and poems that look like poems. Really good people It is the character that is harmonious with the natural expression. A good poem is the product of emotional harmony and natural expression... The essence of poetry is inspiration, spirituality and experience. Whether it is from the eyebrows of a lover, or from a person who bends over to grow vegetables In the singing of a country girl, as soon as inspiration arrives, magic happens, and the result is poetry, beautiful, so beautiful that even the poet himself is surprised...\"\n\nXu Zhimo spoke on stage, students recorded off stage, and people raised their hands to raise their doubts from time to time, and Xu Zhimo answered them one by one easily.\n\nWell, Xu Zhimo is actually here to make money.\n\nHe is about to marry Lu Xiaoman, but his father Xu Shenru is firmly opposed. Later, he reluctantly agreed, but made a request that Xu Zhimo's marriage expenses must be settled by himself.\n\nIn order to raise money for the wedding, Xu Zhimo took jobs around during this time, and he had to give seven or eight speeches in a month.\n\n\"Clap clap clap!\" The audience applauded.\n\nXu Zhimo bowed down and saluted the stage, and was about to retreat when a student suddenly stood up and asked, \"Mr. Xu, can your poetry save the country?\"\n\nThis is obviously here to make trouble. Xu Zhimo's face was a little ugly, and he replied: \"Although poetry cannot save the country, poets can love the country.\"\n\nAnother student asked: \"What do you think of Concubine Dao's education?\"\n\nXu Zhimo said: \"I am deeply impressed by the sword concubine.\"\n\n\"The Southern Revolutionary Army is on the northern expedition, do you think they can succeed?\" the student continued to ask.\n\nXu Zhimo said: \"Today we only talk about poetry, not politics and military affairs.\"\n\nFeeling that he couldn’t stay any longer, Xu Zhimo bowed again and stepped down without giving the students time to ask questions. Immediately, there were many fans holding Xu Zhimo's poems and looking for his autograph.\n\nThe weather was hot in summer, Xu Zhi wiped his sweat and left the school, and called a rickshaw to deliver the wedding invitations. He also has a few friends in Tianjin, and this time he came to invite him personally.\n\nWhen the rickshaw passed the police station, Xu Zhimo saw a group of people surrounding the road, and there was a sound of beating and beating.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Peg the donation box.\"\n\n\"It's the Sword Concubine!\"\n\n\"The Sword Concubine is here too, everyone come and see!\"\n\n“…”\n\nI saw Wenxiu standing on the steps at the entrance of the police station, pointing to the wooden box that had just been fixed next to it, waving a small flag and saying, \"This is the donation box of hope. Every cent of money in it will be used for education. As long as With everyone's concerted efforts, one day, all children in China will be able to go to school...\"\n\n\"it is good!\"\n\nThere were cheers everywhere, but no one was willing to donate money, so everyone was watching the excitement.\n\nAt this moment, a beggar with ragged clothes and messy hair squeezed into the crowd and shouted: \"Let Rang, Rang Rang, I want to donate money!\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, beggars also donate money, which is unusual.\"\n\n\"Begging, you donate the big steamed buns you asked for today?\"\n\n\"Isn't this Feng San'er? After eating, drinking, prostitution and gambling, he lost all his family property, and now he is a beggar with a kind heart?\"\n\n“…”\n\n\"What's wrong with the beggars? What's wrong with the beggars!\" Feng San screamed, \"The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every man. The man will donate today!\"\n\nHe took out more than a dozen copper plates from his arms, and after thinking about it, he stuffed a few back, and put the rest into the donation box.\n\nThe copper slammed into the wooden box, making a \"chop chop chop\" sound, and the scene was suddenly quiet.\n\n\"it is good!\"\n\n\"Enough man!\"\n\nOnlookers suddenly burst into applause.\n\nFeng San greeted the crowd with fists clasped and grinned: \"My third son Feng is also a decent person today!\"\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nXu Zhimo looked at the beggar covered in filth and tattered clothes, and suddenly felt very emotional and had the urge to write poetry. He took out his money bag, counted ten silver dollars, walked to the donation box, and put it in carefully.\n\n\"Thank you, thank you two gentlemen!\" Wen Xiu bowed to the beggar and Xu Zhimo.\n\nFeng San saw Wenxiu saluting him, and hurriedly bowed in return, and then laughed: \"I see, the imperial concubine salutes me Feng Laosan!\"\n\n\"Good, I'll donate a few too!\" Someone responded immediately.\n\nThere are about 20 people donating money one after another, but they are all copper coins, adding up to one or two dollars at most.\n\nThere were also reporters taking pictures at the scene. Xu Zhimo didn’t want to interfere, so he silently returned to the rickshaw and let the driver continue on his way. After visiting a few friends, Xu Zhimo drove to the concession and went straight to the newspaper office of Ta Kung Pao.\n\nNow the serialization of \"Rise of Great Powers\" has ended, and the Russian and Japanese chapters have caused great controversy. Because Zhou Hexuan predicted the rise of Soviet Russia in the article, and discussed Japan's mainland policy. He also said that Soviet Russia and Japan are a great threat to China and are constantly encroaching on Chinese territory. He hoped that the government and local warlords would pay attention.\n\nThere are many Chinese people who hold this view, but Zhou Hexuan came to this conclusion after in-depth analysis. The article is reasonable and well-founded, and people have to believe it.\n\nThe pro-Soviet faction and the pro-Japanese faction both expressed their dissatisfaction with Zhou Hexuan more or less, and pushed Zhou Hexuan to the forefront for a while. As for the Soviet Union and Japan, there was no response. After all, Zhou Hexuan wrote an academic article, and it was published in a British newspaper. It is impossible for the two governments to ask Britain to protest.\n\nAlthough Xu Zhimo does not know such a famous person, he also wants to visit him. In addition to sending wedding invitations, he also had another task, that is, entrusted by Zheng Zhenduo, to invite Zhou Hexuan to join the Literature Research Association.\n\n\"Bang bang bang!\"\n\nXu Zhimo knocked on the door of the president's office.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nXu Zhimo pushed open the door and walked in. He adjusted his glasses and said, \"Hello, Mr. Zhou, my dear Xu Zhimo.\"\n\n\"It turned out to be the great poet Xu, please come in!\" Zhou Hexuan was quite surprised, not knowing what Xu Zhimo wanted him to do.\n\nXu Zhimo walked to the desk and sat down, glanced at the manuscript on the table and asked, \"Mr. Zhou is writing again?\"\n\n\"I'm compiling textbooks.\" Zhou Hexuan got up and poured water for Xu Zhimo.\n\nToday’s education in the Republic of China is extremely chaotic. There is not even a unified national textbook. Each region has its own way, and even what courses to teach are up to the principal.\n\n\"Mr. Zhou is really dedicated to education, and I admire him.\" Xu Zhimo sincerely praised. He is also a patriotic young man. He went abroad when he was fed up with the melee of warlords. At first, he wanted to find a way to save the country. He studied political economics. Unfortunately, his reading was crooked. In the end, he devoted himself to poetry creation.\n\nAfter chatting a few words with each other, Zhou Hexuan asked, \"Why is Mr. Xu looking for me?\"\n\n\"That's right, Mr. Zheng Zhenduo knew that I was coming to Tianjin, and specially entrusted me to invite Mr. Zhou to join the Literature Research Association,\" Xu Zhimo said and took out another invitation, \"And I am getting married on October 3, if Mr. Zhou If you have time, I hope to come to Peiping to attend my wedding.\""
