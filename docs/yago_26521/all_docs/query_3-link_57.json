        "text": "\"Outstanding poetry and excellent translations. The poems have a genuine simplicity and force that overlies the genius and layers of the lyrics.\" ~ Andrew Hamilton CONTAINS ENGLISH AND CHINESE TEXTS OF XU'S POEMS The first English edition of poems by China's foremost modern poet Xu Zhimo, who studied in Cambridge in the early 20th Century. Whilst here he became enchanted by the Romantic poets such as Keats and Shelley; this form of poetry was to infuse his work from that point on, inspiring him to break through traditional Chinese poetic reserve and constraints and changing the medium forever. His poetry is revered by young and old alike in China, but especially amongst the teenagers and young adults. One of the most renowned romantic poets of 20th-century Chinese literature, Xu Zhimo is known for his promotion of modern Chinese poetry and making great contributions to modern Chinese literature. This selection contains some of his most famous and well-loved works including By Chance, You Are in His Eyes, For Whom, The Weak Flame of a Star, A Pipa Tune in an Alley at Midnight and the seminal Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again. FEATURES XU'S TRANSLATIONS OF HIS FAVOURITE ENGLISH POEMS Xu Zhimo was an early 20th-century Chinese poet who sought to promote a modern Chinese poetry that broke with convention and followed Western forms, especially the style of the Romantic and Symbolist poets, with whose work he fell in love while studying at King’s College, Cambridge in 1922. Verses from his most famous poem, ‘Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again’, are inscribed on a monument to him behind King’s College Chapel in the city. In light of his immense and ongoing popularity in China, Xu Zhimo can be counted as one of Cambridge’s most influential alumni. The Oleander Press is proud to have produced this first collection of his poems with contemporary English translations, alongside many of his translations of the work of his favourite poets. XU's TRANSLATIONS OF HIS FAVOURITE ENGLISH POEMS William Blake - The Tiger Thomas Hardy - A Week, The Wound, The Division, Her Initials, To The Moon, I Look into My Glass Katherine Mansfield - The Meeting, The Gulf, Sleeping Together James Elroy Flecker - Tenebris Interlucentem V. II Matthew Arnold - Requiescat Christina Rossetti - Song, The Hour and the Ghost XU'S ORIGINAL POEMS - CHINESE & ENGLISH By Chance, Go, It is Not Easy to Survive Nowadays, Spring, Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again, Cricket, I Don’t Know Which Direction the Wind is Blowing, Insignificance, You Are in His Eyes, Wind in the Pines at Midnight, The Wide Sea, A P'i-pa Tune in an Alley at Midnight\n\nPlease Note- Chinese simplified characters are used in this title.\n\nXu was born in Haining, Zhejiang and graduated from the famous Hangzhou High School (浙江省杭州高级中学).\n\nIn 1915, he married Zhang Youyi and next year he went to Peiyang University (Beiyang University, now Tianjin University) to study Law. In 1917, he transferred to Peking University due to the law department of Peiyang University merging into Peking University. In 1918, after studying at Peking University, he traveled to the United States to study history in Clark University. Shortly afterwards, he transferred to Columbia University in New York to study economics and politics in 1919.\n\nFinding the States \"intolerable\", he left in 1921 to study at King's College, Cambridge in England, where he fell in love with English romantic poetry like that of Keats and Shelley, and was also influenced by the French romantic and symbolist poets, some of whose works he translated into Chinese. In 1922 he went back to China and became a leader of the modern poetry movement. In 1923, he founded the Crescent Moon Society.\n\nWhen the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore visited China, Xu Zhimo played the part of oral interpreter. Xu was also renowned for his use of the vernacular language. He was one of the first Chinese writers to successfully naturalize Western romantic forms into modern Chinese poetry.\n\nHe worked as an editor and professor at several schools before dying in a plane crash on November 19, 1931 near Tai'an, Shandong while flying from Nanjing to Beijing. He left behind four collections of verse and several volumes of translations from various languages.\n\nSee also Chinese entry 徐志摩"
