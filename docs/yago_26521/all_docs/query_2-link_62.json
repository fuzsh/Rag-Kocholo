        "text": "I figured putting up their names as a blog title would be most suiting since this post is about the audience’s perspective of the launch of Midnight Garden and ED-08.\n\nFirst of all thank you for the love, Harry, Charmaine, Sebastian, Youyi, Alvin & Zhang Ying both for the flowers and especially for coming down to the launch on Saturday. We cross paths during our various times at Safra radio and it’s kinda cool that we still keep in touch in someway. Although I must apologize to Ah Yee for missing your farewell cos I was crazy busy with this…..haha!\n\nAll these were taken through the lens of Zhang Ying who arrived early with Youyi. They managed to catch abit of our set up and also me goofing around yet again by carrying my own poster in Orchard Central around. Hahaha it’s not everyday you get your face in a shopping mall ok.\n\nSome pretty cool lighting thanks to OC and right where my guests from Safra Radio were seated I’d say the effect was pretty good.\n\nAs much as I wanted to avoid it, an ex-DJ has to babble and babble on stage. In fact my host Audrey was also a former DJ with 91.3fm. Hahaha it was a gathering of the ex-DJs but there you go, my ex-colleagues probably waiting for me to shut up…….as usual.\n\nThis was part of our finale to applaud for taking the time off to be environmentally responsible. If Zhang Ying caught this shot means she wasn’t clapping…..tsk tsk!\n\nSafra Radio, from my ex-program director Sebastian who thought me alot about running an event with style, to Alvin Yee who knew what good marketing was all about, Zhang Ying who allows me to annoy her every morning before i go on-air, Alvin Tan my Man Utd kaki and Youyi my coffee buddy……thanks guys!\n\nAnd that is love right there, too bad Harry and Charmaine couldn’t make it otherwise it would have been even more fun…….but then Harry might have finished all the food instead.\n\nStill alot more people to thank for coming……I’m getting there.\n\nOfficial photos coming soon!\n\nDanker out!"
