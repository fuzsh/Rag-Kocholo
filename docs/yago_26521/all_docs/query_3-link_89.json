        "text": "—— 《A Night in Florence》by Xu Zhimo.\n\nWithin Xu Zhimo’s poetry “Fei Leng Cui” is also known as Florence, like the translation, this city of poetry is filled with color and full of classical flavor. In the birthplace of renaissance, under the visible blue sky and white clouds every corner was filled with colorful buildings, dark green shutters with scarlet roof. Just taking a stroll was like living in a vast Museum of art. Leonardo da Vinci, Dante, Michelangelo ……Hearing these names for a thousand times, one day to suddenly have such close contact made Du Lisa feel super weird.\n\nThe station was originally more calm than their trip to Venice, there wasn’t any drowning nor catching a cold, however that night before leaving Florence to Rome, a clique event occurred.\n\nThat night at the hotel, Jungkook was in the bathroom taking a shower, while Du Lisa leisurely sat on bed sifting through the photos they took in these past few days, reminiscing was very fun.\n\nSuddenly, the camera ran out of battery, she got off from the bed to find the charger, searching her own belongings to the President’s, after a long time she still couldn’t find the charger, however she instead found a red velvet box.\n\nStrange, why does this box look so familiar? Curiously, Du Lisa opened the box to take a peek and was completely dumbfounded.\n\nThis, isn’t this the diamond ring that’s worth two million???\n\nWhen Jungkook finished showering and came out from the bathroom, he found Du Lisa had a weird expression on her face, upon seeing her holding the ring, all of a sudden he finally understood what was happening.\n\nThis ring, originally Jungkook intended to take advantage while they were on holiday to find a proper time give it to her, however he didn’t think she would uncover it herself, it appears his ears are not going to have a rest.\n\nSure enough, upon seeing him, Du Lisa angrily placed the ring in front of him: “This, what is this?”\n\nJungkook calmly replied: “A ring.”\n\nWhat’s with this attitude? Du Lisa angrily shouted: “This is not just a ring!”\n\n“Then what is it?”\n\n“It’s a ring valued of two million dollars!”\n\n“But isn’t that a ring?”\n\n“……”\n\nDu Lisa become angry from embarrassment: “I don’t care, give me an explanation, why is this diamond ring with you? Wasn’t it lost?” That time if wasn’t because she thought she lost the diamond ring, why would she so easily sell herself?? For the President to do so, it’s simply forcing marriage! Too hateful!\n\nBut this initiator of evil gave an indifferent expression and shrugged his shoulders: “It was lost, and I’ve found it back.”\n\n“Then why didn’t you say so?”\n\n“You didn’t ask.”\n\n“You!” Du Lisa grit her teeth in anger, however the word she wanted to say didn’t come out. This proves that the President absolutely have the ability to infuriate a person to death!\n\nUnable to outspeak him, it best if she didn’t speak at all, Du Lisa grit her teeth, stamp her feet and harden her heart saying: “I’m not going to pay any attention to you now!”"
