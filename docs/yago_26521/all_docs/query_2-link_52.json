        "text": "19 November marks the anniversary of Xu Zhimo's death. Indisputably one of modern China's greatest poets, Xu is best remembered for his poet \"Goodbye Again, Cambridge.\"\n\nBorn in Haining, Zhejiang in 1897, Xu was just 34 when his Beijing-bound flight crashed into the foothills of mighty Taishan. In his relatively short career, however, Xu managed to naturalize Western Romantic forms into Chinese poetry, written in the vernacular Baihua, like no other.\n\nAlthough he initially travelled Stateside to persue studies at Columbia University, Xu said that he found America \"intolerable\" (ouch) and left in 1921. England, however, was much more to his liking, and at King's College, Cambridge he fell in love not only with the ancient university town, but also with Keats, Shelley and the English Romantics, whose works he translated into Chinese.\n\nIndeed, Xu seemed to fall in love a lot, and unfortunately could never be as devoted a husband as he was a poet. While married to his first wife Zhang Youyi, Xu embarked on an affair Lin Huiyin. Lin, however, was promised to Liang Sicheng, the famed 'Father of Modern Chinese Architecture' and son of the great reformist Liang Qichao. Xu then became involved with a friend's wife, who later divorced her husband and married Xu. Xu, however, also became romantically linked with Pearl S. Buck, the Chinese-born American author of The Good Earth, and pro-Communist American journalist Agnes Smedley. Evidently, he didn't find American women as intolerable as the country itself.\n\nHis heart may always have belonged to the unattainable Lin, however, for it was to attend a given to be given by her that he boarded that ill-fated flight from Nanjing.\n\nTo this day, Xu Zhimo's most famous work remains a necessary part of Chinese children's education - which, if nothing else, has turned the backs of King's College, Cambridge into an unexpected must-see destination for Chinese travelers on their Grand Tours of Europe. A memorial stone has even been erected there with the first and last two lines of \"Goodbye Again, Cambridge\"...\n\nSoftly I am leaving,\n\nJust as softly as I came;\n\nI softly wave goodbye\n\nTo the clouds in the western sky.\n\nThe golden willows by the riverside\n\nAre young brides in the setting sun;\n\nTheir glittering reflections on the shimmering river\n\nKeep undulating in my heart.\n\nThe green tape grass rooted in the soft mud\n\nSways leisurely in the water;\n\nI am willing to be such a waterweed\n\nIn the gentle flow of the River Cam.\n\nThat pool in the shade of elm trees\n\nHolds not clear spring water, but a rainbow\n\nCrumpled in the midst of duckweeds,\n\nWhere rainbow-like dreams settle.\n\nTo seek a dream? Go punting with a long pole,\n\nUpstream to where green grass is greener,\n\nWith the punt laden with starlight,\n\nAnd sing out loud in its radiance.\n\nYet now I cannot sing out loud,\n\nPeace is my farewell music;\n\nEven crickets are now silent for me,\n\nFor Cambridge this evening is silent.\n\nQuietly I am leaving,\n\nJust as quietly as I came;\n\nGently waving my sleeve,\n\nI am not taking away a single cloud.\n\nSadly, but in no way surprisingly, much of the original work's magic is lost in translation. If you don't believe us, though, just listen to the poem set to music and performed Taiwanese singer Yoga Lin and the Nova Festival Choir."
