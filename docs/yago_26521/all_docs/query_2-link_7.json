        "text": "Zhejiang Drama Troupe performed a stage paly, A Date with XU Zhimo, about the love story of XU, an early 20th-century romantic Chinese poet, at the Auditorium in East Campus. Despite the drizzly weather, many came to enjoy the poetic vibes.\n\nOn the stage, with beautiful lighting and backdrop, a few young people, sometimes seriously, sometimes humorously, read XU's poems and performed his love story.\n\nThe cast photo of A Date with XU Zhimo.

In November 1928, XU wrote down his most famous poem Taking Leave of Cambridge Againâ\"Softly I am leaving, / Just as softly as I came; / I softly wave goodbye / To the clouds in the western sky.\"\n\n\"Fare thee well! Fare thee well! / In that farewell grows her sweet sorrowâ / Sayonara!\" With the touching poetry reading, the performance came to an end and the audience broke into a stormy applause.\n\nOne still during the play.

XU's classic poems and his correspondence with LU and LIN delineated a pure idealist, who was longing for love, freedom and beauty.\n\nAs director LI Bonan said, \"I want to show the poetic life of this talented man through spiritual communication between his poems and audience's heart.\"\n\nStudents in the audience had learnt Taking Leave of Cambridge Again before in their high school textbook, and now they felt they were reliving the poet's life.\n\n\"The poem can be so vivid,\" LI, a student in the audience, exclaimed after watching the performance.\n\nIn recent years, the University of Science and Technology of China has attached great importance to the culture and art education of students and has continuously introduced high-level and high-quality performances, which bring teachers and students a unique artistic feast and create a rich campus art atmosphere.\n\n(Writen by DUAN Qingrong, edited bu HU Dongyin, USTC News Center)"
