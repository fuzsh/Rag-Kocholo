At the Ballantyne Press, Edinburgh PREFACE 1158557 The Descendants of King Edward IV. and of his brother and sister, George, Duke of Clarence, and Anne, Duchess of Exeter, and of their aunt Isabel, Countess of Essex and Eu, having been given in the preceding volumes, the present volume of the PLANTAGENET ROLL OF THE BLOOD ROYAL treats of those of Lady Elizabeth Mortimer, wife first of Henry, Lord Percy, K.G., called \" Hotspur,\" and, secondly, of Thomas, Lord Camoys, K.G. The plan followed is identical with that adopted in the Clarence and Exeter Volumes. The lines from the Lady Elizabeth are traced out in a 1 ^ series of Tables until about the beginning of the last century ; then in the ' body of the book the descendants of the various persons last named in the ?y Tables are set out in the order of primogeniture. The full dates of birth, ,-v marriage, and death are given, and in the cases of married persons the names of the husband and wife, &c. In the Tables the dates of birth, marriage, and death are given when- ever possible, but as the object of the writer has been merely to trace out the living descendants of Edward III., and in order to keep the work within bounds, he has been obliged to omit (except in some few cases, where it has been thought desirable to show the descent of a title) the names of persons who died without issue, or whose issue subsequently failed, and also o . the parentage of the wives. In the case of a person having been married more than once, only the i name of the wife or wives (or husband or husbands) by whom he (or she) 0 had issue are given, the figure in round brackets immediately following the ■^ marriage mark ( = ) signifying whether she (or he) is first, second, or third wife ^ (or husband). Similarly, if the figure precedes the marriage mark, it signi- H fies that he (or she) married as first or second wife (or husband), as the case Qsjj may be. Wherever the compiler has been able to give the dates of birth ~^) and marriage, he has considered this sufficient indication of whether the \\. children are by the first or second marriage ; but where the dates have not \\ been obtainable, the figure before the names shows of which marriage they are the issue. When a name in the Tables is in italics, it signifies that they have a previous descent which has been already shown. In the Roll itself considerations of space have again rendered it necessary to adopt the briefest possible description, and the words \" and had issue \" must be held to refer only (with the exceptions mentioned above) to those children who are now living, or whose issue now survives, or those concerning whose issue, or possible issue, the author has been unable to obtain par- ticulars. Each Section is headed by the name of the person last named in the Tables, and their children are la, 2a, &c. The issue of the «'s, grand- children of the head of the line, are b's, and the children of these last, great-grandchildren of the head of the line, are similarly c's, and so on, the d's being children of the c's, and great-great-grandchildren of the head of the line, &c. preface The dates of birth and death immediately follow the names of the per- sons to whom they refer. In the cases of births, marriages, and deaths outside the United Kingdom, the author has endeavoured to give the place as well as the date. The surnames of noblemen are given in round brackets after then- Christian names, and the nationality of their title is indicated by the initials and names within square brackets immediately following them.1 The Lady Elizabeth Mortimer, whose descendants are here set out, was the elder daughter2 of Edmund (Mortimer), 3rd Earl of March, by his wife the Lady Philippa, only child and heir of Lionel (of Antwerp), Duke of Clarence, the eldest of the four sons of King Edward III. of whom issue now survives. Her brother Roger, 4th Earl of March, was declared heir to the crown of England by King Richard II., and was the father of the Lady Anne Mortimer, who by her marriage with Richard (Plantagenet), Earl of Cambridge, transmitted the hereditary right to the throne to the House of York, and was the ancestress of King Edward IV. and of all the successive sovereigns of England (with the exception of Henry VII.) from that day to this, and equally so of all those whose names are recorded in the Tudor Roll and in the Clarence, Exeter, and Essex Volumes of the present series. Lady Elizabeth was born at Usk, 12 February 1371, and married the famous Henry, Lord Percy, K.G., called \" Hotspur,\" son and heir of Henry, 1st Earl of Northumberland. He was descended in the male line from Josceline of Louvain, brother of Queen Adeliza, second wife of King Henry I., and younger son of Godfrey, sovereign Duke of Lorraine and Count of Brabant, who, marrying Maud, daughter and eventual heiress of William, 3rd feudal Lord Percy, assumed her name but retained his own paternal arms; and was himself of the Royal Blood, Henry, 3rd Lord Percy of Alnwick (father of the 1st Earl of Northumberland), having married the Lady Mary Plantagenet, daughter of Henry, Earl of Lancaster, and grand- daughter of Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, the second son of King Henry III. Lord Percy was born 20 May 1364; was knighted by King Edward III. in April 1377 along with the future Kings, Richard II. and Henry IV., who were almost exactly of his own age ; was made a KG. at the age of 24 in 1388, and won his sobriquet of \"Hotspur\" owing to the restless ac- tivity he displayed as Warden of the Marches in repressing the inroads of the Scottish Borderers.3 He was the English commander at the famous 1 The initials E., S., I., G.B., U.K., F., H.R.E., andP.S., standing for England, Scotland, Ireland, Great. Britain, the United Kingdom, Fiance, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Papal States. With regard to foreign titles of nobility, it was the original intention of the author to give these in the language of their nationality, hut it would have appeared absurd to have written Berzoy von Tech, or to have referred to the Freihrrr Heinrieli run Worms, M.P.; after much consideration, therefore, he decided to give them in English, adding the foreign equivalent in brackets immediately following, so, \"3rd Baron of Huge! (Freiherr von Hugel) \"— \" 7th Count of Salis (Graf von Salis),\" after the plan recently adopted in the Almanwh cle Unthu. It is to he wished that some settled rule might be adopted by the Press. To take one case, which might he multiplied without end, Due d' Orleans or Duke of Orleans are both equally correct, but the Duke it'Orlioiis, which one constantly sees, is eer- tainly a misnomer. The Spanish Minister is nearly always described as \"Marquis of Villalobar,\" while the Italian Ambassador figures as \" Marquis de San Giuliano.\" Surely it should be \" Marquis of\" or \" Marehese di.\" All the older writers used to translate the names and titles into English, and this appears to be the only way if any uniform plan is to be attempted, and is, moreover,'' the plan adopted to-day by such high authorities as the compilers of the British Museum Catalogue. 8 Her younger sister, Lady Philippa, born at Ludlow, 21 November 1375, married 1st, John (Hastings), Earl of Pembroke ; 2ndly, 15 August 1390, Richard (Fitzalan), 11th Earl of Arundel, and 3rdly. after April 1398, John (Poynings). Lord St. John, but d.s.p.s. at Halnaker, co. Sussex, 24 Sep- tember 1 101. ' Walsingham, ii. p. 144. vi preface Battle of Otterburn (Chevy Chase), 10 August 1388 — \" the best-fought and severest of all the battles I have related in my history,\" says Froissart — where, though Douglas, the Scottish commander, was slain, Percy himself was made prisoner; and of Homildon Hill, 14 September 1402, where he defeated the Scots and captured the Earl of Douglas. He joined his father in supporting Henry of Lancaster's usurpation of the crown, it being the subsequent boast of the Percies that they had placed Henry IV. on the throne ; but afterwards taking mortal offence at the King's refusal to allow him to ransom his brother-in-law Sir Edmund Mortimer whilst claiming the prisoners whom he (Percy) had taken at Homildon Hill, he rose in rebellion and was defeated and slain at the Battle of Shrewsbury, 23 July 1403, by an unknown hand, either by a spear or by an arrow which had pierced his brain. After that \" sory bataill,\" the fore- runner of the Wars of the Roses, was finished, his body, over which the King is said to have shed tears, was delivered to his kinsman Thomas (Nevill), Lord Furnival, who buried it in his family chapel at Whitchurch, sixteen miles from the battlefield. But a day or two later, in order to pre- vent any rumour that he was still alive, it was taken up and placed for public exhibition between two millstones near the pillory in Shrewsbury, somewhere near the present site of the Post Office, guarded by armed men, and then beheaded and quartered. His head was placed over the gate of York, '\" there to remain so long as it can last,\" and his four quarters were salted and sent in sacks to the Mayors of London, Bristol, Newcastle-on- Tyne, and Chester, the cost of their carriage being £13, 15s.1 On 3 November following, however, the King ordered that his head and quarters should be delivered to his widow, who buried them in the Northumberland tomb in York Minster. She was put under arrest after Hotspur's death,2 but was subsequently released, and married, secondly, as his second wife, Thomas (de Camoys), 1st Lord Camoys, K.G., who commanded the left wing of the army at the Battle of Agincourt. She was living 1417/8, and may have been the \" Isabel Camoyse, wife of Thomas Camoyse, Knt.,\" who died 1444, and was buried in the Friars Minors. Lord Camoys died 28 March 1419, and was buried at Trotton, co. Sussex, where there is a beautiful brass, with the effigies of himself and Lady Elizabeth, a photogravure of which, taken from a rubbing by Dr. Fairbank, is given as a frontispiece to this volume. She had issue by her first husband a son, Henry, who was restored as 2nd Earl of Northumberland by Henry V., 11 November 1414, and a daughter, Lady Elizabeth, wife first of John, 7th Lord Clifford, K.G., and 2ndly, of Ralph (Nevill), 2nd Earl of Westmorland ; and by her second another daughter, the Hon. Alice Camoys, wife of Sir Leonard Hastings, who all three had issue (see Table II). The statement sometimes made that she was the mother of Sir Richard de Camoys is incorrect. On the death of the 7th Earl of Northumberland in 15 72 the repre- sentation of Hotspur and Lady Elizabeth devolved upon his daughters and co-heirs. The elder Lady Elizabeth married Richard Woodruffe of Wolley, co. York, and had issue, but none of her descendants have been traced to the present day (see p. 567). The younger Lady Lucy married Sir Edward 1 ,; Battlefield Church, Salop, and the Battle of Shrewsbury,\" by the Rev. W. G. D. Fletcher, M.A., F.S.A., 1903, p. 13. * Fiedera, viii. p. 334. preface Stanley, K.B.., and her heir of line is Viscount Gage, who is thus the senior known representative of Lady Elizabeth Mortimer and Lord Percy. The descendants of Lady Elizabeth are very much more numerous than those of her brother the Earl of March. The present part of the Mortimer- Percy Volume deals with those of Henry, 4th Earl of Northumberland, K.G. (d. 1486) and of his sister, Lady Elizabeth Gascoigne, and contains between nine and ten thousand new names. The actual number of their living descendants who are traceable, however, amounts to some thirty or forty thousand, and they have between them 135,5 20 descents. Owing, how- ever, to the many inter-marriages with descendants of the Earl of March, the great majority of these have already appeared in one or other of the volumes previously published, in right of a senior descent from him ; and owing to the ever-increasing number of descendants and descents which naturally occur as the lines are carried further back, the compiler has in the present index been reluctantly compelled to abandon the plan he had hitherto followed of setting out in the index the name of every descendant whether or not they have already appeared in former volumes, and to con- fine the index to the present part to the names which actually appear in the body of the work. It will be easily understood how this course has been forced upon him when it is pointed out that all the Clarence,1 and that 14,478 Tudor,2 31,752 Exeter, and 12,176 Essex descents repeat in the present part. To prevent any inconvenience, however, a new plan has been adopted of adding an index of the numbers instead of the names which repeat, so that any one can at once see whether he or she is de- scended from Edward III. through the Mortimer-Percy marriage. This plan will be found fully explained on page 607, and is the plan Avhich will be followed with duplicate descents in all future volumes. With this part is included a Supplement, containing some further de- scendants of the Duchess of Exeter and the Countess of Essex, which the compiler has since succeeded in tracing. Summarising the five volumes already published, it will be found that some fifty thousand descendants 3 of King Edward III. have been traced, and that they have between them over 300,000 descents, all clearly shown by the numbers attached to each name. Included in the Roll are the names of all the crowned heads of Europe, with the exception of the King of Servia and the Prince of Montenegro; of the majority of our hereditary legislators ; of the members of all the royal and princely houses of Europe ; of many of the higher nobility of France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Belgium; and of 1 By the marriages respectively of the Hon. Jane Nevill and Henry. Lord Stafford (both descen- dants through the Mortimer- Percy marriage ; see the present Part, Tables XXVI. and XXI.) with Henry (Pole) Lord Montagu and the Lady Ursula Pole, grandchildren of George, Duke of Clarence (see Clarence Vol., Table II.). 2 Largely in consequence of the marriage nf Henry (Clifford), 2nd Earl of Cumberland (a Mortimer- Percy descendant; see Table VIII.), with the Lady Eleanor Brandon, a granddaughter of King Henry VII. (see Tudor Roll, Tabic XIV.). 3 As far as the compiler has been able to trace them, the living descendants of King Edward IV. appear to amount to some 12,000 ; and those of the Duke of Clarence, of the Duchess of Exeter, and the Countess of Essex to some 18,000, 25,500, and 18,000 respectively ; while the present instalment of Lady Elizabeth Mortimer's descendants number some 30,000. In consequence of inter-marriages, however, a considerable number, as already mentioned, are descended from all five, while others again are descended from lour, or three, or two of them. He has not had time to work out the exact number of these inter-marriages, but a rough estimate fixes the net number of the descendants of Edward III. already traced at the above number. viii preface the old aristocracy of the Southern States of America, together with many of those of our baronets and county families with their cadets, who so largely go to make up the professional classes ; but with some few exceptions, none have descended to or are at least traceable among the trading or labouring classes. While tracing hundreds of entirely new lines of descent, it has been the duty of the author to discard others which will not stand in the light of modern investigation. This has been especially so in the case of the Mortimer-Percy lines. For instance, the oft-repeated statement that Lady Eleanor Percy, a daughter of the 3rd Earl of Northumberland, married Reginald (West), 6th Lord De La Warr, is demonstratively incorrect, and this would have been at once seen had the old Peerage writers been more careful in comparing their dates. The will of Henry, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, is dated 1 November 1458, and in it he mentions his three daughters, Eleanor, Margaret, and Elizabeth, all then unmarried.1 Lord De La Warr died on the 27 August 1450, not 1451, as stated by Collins and others. The writs issued on his death are dated 1 September, 29 Hen. VI., which is clearly 1450, and the inquisitions in pursuance were taken in various counties within the next few weeks.2 From these we learn that Richard West, Esq., was his son and heir and over 19 years of age. Richard West was consequently born not later than 1431, in which year his supposed grandfather, the Earl of Northumberland, was six years of age ! The Lord De La Warr who died in 1450 was, moreover, at least 30 years older than his alleged father-in-law.3 This of course cuts out the many lines traced through the Wests, several of which have been printed. Equally incorrect are the lines traced through the marriage of Thomas Frewen, M.P., in 1671, with Bridget Laton,4 and through the alleged marriage of Thomas ap John Vaughan of Plas Thomas, co. Salop, with Joan, said to have been a daughter of Philip Jennings of Dudleston, by Diana, da. of Sir William Bowyer, Bt.5 1 Collins (\"Peerage of England,\" vol. ii. p. 373) quotes this will, and yet both at this reference and at vol. v. p. 382, proo Is to marry Eleanor to Lord De La Warr. 2 Ex inform. Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte. The author has also to thank Sir George Armytage, Bt., and Mr. Erskine E. West for assistance in running this statement to earth. 3 The Editor has not been able to trace the genesis of the statement of the alleged marriage, but Mr. Erskine K. West suggests that possibly Lady Eleanor Percy married Lord De La Warr's grand- son, Reginald West, whose name, and nothing more, appears in several MSS. in the British Museum. 4 See Burke's \"Landed Gentry,\" 1906, p. 635. The statement there is that Bridget was the sister and heir of Charles and the daughter of Sir Thomas Laton by his wile. Bridget Sandford. whii-h Sir Thomas was the son and heir of another Sir Thomas Laton of Laton and Sexhow, by his wife, the Hon. Mary Fairfax, the said Mary Fairfax being a descendant of Edward III., through Mortimer- Percy (see Table XV.). Bridget Sandford was', however, the seconil irife of the first-no, „al .Sir Thomas Laton. Sir Thomas married twice, first Mary Fairfax (who died 1636), by whom he had, with others (see Table XV.), a son, Thomas, incorrectly styled Sir Thomas in the above pedigree. This Thomas died s.p. (\"Hail. MS.,\" p. 2118). having married Anne, daughter of Ambrose Pudsey, who survived him, and married, sreondlv. Walt, r Stn.'kland (Whitaker's \"Craven,\" p. 126). Admon. of Thomas Laton, Esquire, of East Laton, Yorks, was granted to Anne Laton, his widow, 20 April 1659. Sir Thomas married. 2ndly. 1637, the said Bridget, widow of Ambrose Pudsey of Bolton, and daughter of Sir Richard Saudi. .id, l,y whom he bad is,ue Charles, who ./.>•./>, and Bridget, who married, 1671, Thomas Frewen. M.P., md had issue. The M.I. to the Rev. John Frewen at Sapcote, Leics., recites that his mother, Bridget l'i. ■». n. was the only (mV) daughter of Sir Thomas Laton of East Laton and Sexhow ... by Dame Bridget, his second wife, relict of Ambrose Pudsey . . . and daughter of Sir Richard Sandford, and the minutes of the. Committee for the advancing money, 1469/60, have a reference to Bridget, wife of Sir Thomas Layton, to the effect that she had a jointure, and that she applied for one-fifth and was refused. The pedigree at the Heralds' College gives Sir Thomas's marriages correctly, but seems itself to need verifying in other particulars. 5 See Burke's \"Royal Descents,\" ii., xev., and \"Landed Gentry\" (1906, p. 1718). According to this pedigree, Philip Vaughan, the great-grandson of Thomas ap John Vaughan, was bapt. 10 October 1690, while Diana Bowyer was bapt. 7 October 16S0, only ten years and three days before her great- grandson ! ix b preface The author has, of course, also ignored all the descents traced from Sir William St. Leger, Lord President of Munster, it having been clearly established now for some years that it was not Sir William's father, Sir Warharn St. Leger, but his great-uncle, another Sir Warham, who married the Ursula Nevil.1 The author hopes that those who find themselves omitted in consequence of the above will not consider him personally responsible, and he will hope in some future volume to have the pleasure of restoring their names in right of some other and more correct descent. The author must himself plead guilty to an unfortunate slip in the Clarence volume. Following Berry and others, he has in Table LXII. made Elizabeth Meux, the third wife (married at St. Dunstan's West, London, 2 May 1710) of Sir John Miller, 3rd Bt., the mother of all his children, whereas she appears to have had only one child to survive, viz. Elizabeth, wife of Sir Edward Worsley of Gatcombe. The other children appear to have all been by the first wife, Margaret, daughter of John Peachy, who died 23, and was buried in Chichester Cathedral, 25 September 1710. Sir Thomas, 4th Bt., was baptized 4 April 1689, and matriculated at Oxford 1706/7, aged 18. This cuts out sections 548 and 549 (pp. 500-515) and 556, 557, and 558 (p. 518), Nos. 21953-22365, a total of 413; but as Nos. 21987-22002 (Chichesters), 22003-22012 (Hortons), 22015-22020 (Carpenter-Garniers), 22041-22095 (Garniers), 22103- 22135 (Delrnes), and 22136-22305 (Keppels) reappear in right of their descents in the Essex (p. 632), Mortimer-Percy (pt. i. p. 306), Tudor (p. 171), and Exeter (pp. 243, 385, 243) vols, respectively, the actual number of names which come out is only 63. The author is indebted to Arthur E. Gamier, Esq., for calling his attention to this error. In the next part it is hoped to complete the other descendants of Lady Elizabeth Mortimer, and as this will at the same time finish all the lines from Lionel, Duke of Clarence, a further Supplement will be added, and the Editor will be very glad to hear of any omissions which may have been noticed in order that he may include them in this Supplement. Future volumes will deal with the descendants of John (Plantagenet, called of Gaunt), Duke of Lancaster; of Edmund (Plantagenet, called of Langley), Duke of York; of Thomas (Plantagenet, called of Woodstock), Duke of Gloucester ; and of the Lady Isabel Plantagenet, wife of Ingleram (de Courcy), Earl of Bedford. There are, of course, many who affect to laugh at any work treating of Royal descents, and a volume which is devoted to setting forth the individual descent of various more or less obscure personages is naturally of purely personal interest to those whose descent it sets forth, but the present series approaches the subject from a totally different point — from the historical, not from the personal, and aims at treating in a fairly exhaustive manner of all the descendants of, and descents from, the greatest of our Plantagenet kings. While preparing this work the author has received some hundreds of letters from persons in every quarter of the globe, descended not only from Edward III., but in many cases our early Norman and Saxon sovereigns, requesting that their descents may be included, and surprise has in some cases been expressed because the writer, 1 See Table XXVII. Tin' ( lpiler refers to this because descents through this alleged marriage figure so often in previously printed works on Royal descents, and he is being constantly referred to them. preface while casting no doubt on the genuineness of the particular descent, has been obliged to explain, either that it did not come within the scope of his work, or else that a descent from, say, John of Gaunt, could not be included in the volume dealing with those from George of Clarence. The author is always glad to receive copies of all Royal descents. They are all carefully arranged, and those coming from Edward III. will, if found correct, be duly included in their proper order. It is, however, impossible for him to say off-hand whether such and such a descent is correct. The work is not an easy one to prepare, and it is absolutely necessary for him to confine himself to the particular line of descent upon which he may for the moment be engaged. Others say that a Royal descent is of no interest, since so many enjoy it; but allowing that there are some 80,000 or even 100,000 descendants of Edward III. now living, what is that out of a total of, say, 100,000,000 per- sons of British descent ; and even if Edward I. may be justly termed the father of the British people, it is quite a different thing to be able to trace the line. Let it be remembered that while a word from the King can put one in \" the Peerage,\" or a successful financial speculation in the \" Landed Gentry,\" birth alone entitles one to a place in the Plantagenet Roll ; for on one side at least there must be a strain of gentle blood, through which it is possible to trace ancestry 1 to the feudal and crusading days. As the Rev. W. G. D. Fletcher, a well-known authority on the subject, so truly remarks2: \"The tracing and working out the descent of living persons from kings and princes of England is often of vastly greater interest than tracing their pedigrees back in the direct male line. A family pedigree is . too often a string of the names of almost unknown persons, with their place of abode, the dates of baptism and marriage and death, and the date and proof of their will Useful men, no doubt, these ancestors were in their day, but they were for the most part ' unknown to history.' It is given to but few to have in the male line a Marlborough, a Nelson, a Clivc, a Wellington, a Fox, a Burke, a Pitt, a Cromwell, a Lely, or a Reynolds for an ancestor. Whereas every Royal descent necessarily implies the possession of distinguished historical personages as ancestors — men and women who meet us in the pages of history, kings, warriors, statesmen, Knights of the Garter, canonised saints, and so forth. And if it be sometimes urged that, after all, the quantity of Royal blood that flows in any person's veins must be infinitesimally small, the same holds true of the blood of our paternal ancestors ; we only have one-half of our fathers' blood, one-quarter of our grandfathers', one-eighth of our great-grandfathers', and so on.\" Embracing, as this work does, all classes, from the sovereign to the peasant, it serves to unite all in a common interest in the traditions of the past. Who studying history, or visiting the tombs of the Edwards in Westminster Abbey, or reading Lytton's \" Last of the Barons,\" could fail to feel a better citizen, knowing that step by step, and link by link, he is descended in a clear unbroken line from those who built up the foundations of our mighty Empire, and is united by blood to our common sovereign. But putting on one side the question of the interest or value of a 1 It should be remembered that any one whose name occurs in this Roll can trace an ancestry back in an unbroken line to William the Conqueror and Alfred the Great, to St. Louis and to the Emperor Charlemagne. - See \" Notes on some Shropshii e Royal Descents,\" by the Rev. W. G. I). Fletcher, M.A. , F.S.A. xi preface Royal descent, this series forms a valuable means of recording the genea- logies of many important families which do not come within the scope of any of the other genealogical works, and of the cadet and colonial branches of those that do. The Peerages, &c. are naturally more concerned with the fortunes of the titled or landed lines, but the Plantagenet Roll aims at making the pedigrees of such families as come within its scope exhaustive ; and the Editor ventures to think that the pedigree here given will be found of use to future generations quite apart from Royal descent, and that the recording those branches settled beyond the seas equally with those at home will help to cement the feeling of kinship between the different parts of the Empire, and so help towards that closer union of the British-speaking States which it is the duty of all to promote. Every effort has been made to make the Roll as complete as possible, and to thoroughly revise and bring the particulars up to date, and for this purpose proofs have been submitted to all those named therein whose addresses the writer was able to ascertain, and he desires to return his most grateful thanks for the courtesy and assistance which have been extended to him on all hands. It is sometimes invidious to particularise, but he must especially acknowledge his indebtedness to the Rev. E. H. Fellowes, the Rev. W. G. D. Fletcher, F.S.A., Sir George Armytage, Bt., Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte, M. Bijlweld, Editor of the Nederlands Adchbock, the Rev. C. Moor, D.D., Sir Robert A. Morris, Bt., Major Raymond Smythies, Erskine E. West, Esq., Charles E. Lamb, Esq., Mrs. Seton, the Baroness Deichmann, Mrs. Lomas, Col. R. V. Riddell, Arthur G. Garnier, Esq., R. E. Elliott-Chambers, Esq., Miss Oswald (formerly Williamson), Miss Marcon, and some scores of others, far too numerous to enumerate, who have not only assisted with particulars concerning their own families, but have gone to considerable trouble in assisting him to trace out other lines of descent, in searching parish registers, and in obtaining dates. Nor must he omit to accord his grateful thanks to Sir James Balfour Paul, the Lord Lyon King of Arms, for his always prompt and ready replies to inquiries addressed to him ; to the Editor of Notes and Queries for inserting numerous questions ; or his indebtedness to works like Burke's \" Peerage \" and \" Landed Gentry,\" Debrett's \" Peerage,\" &c. In compiling this work, the author can truthfully say that he has made every effort to make it as complete as possible ; each descent is treated on its own merits, and no distinction is made, whether it be that of the peer or the yeoman ; and absolutely no charge or condition has been made for the insertion of any name or descent in this book. There are, of course, many lines which the writer has been unable to trace, the very magnitude of the task making all the conclusions arrived at of a more or less tentative nature, and he is only too fully aware of the number of other errors and imperfections which must, almost of necessity, occur in a first attempt of this kind ; but he asks for the kind indulgence of his readers, and he will be most grateful to all those who will point out to him omissions or other errors which may come under their notice. They will all be included in a supplementary volume with which the series will close.
