        "text": "Information/Write-up\n\nThe \"hurtin' Albertan\" returns with a stellar follow up to 2005's \"Hair in my Eyes like a Highland Steer,\" which won two Canadian Country Music Awards and a Juno for best roots and traditional album.\n\nRecorded in Nashville with producer/songwriter/musician Harry Stinson, Lund's latest is an extended ode to the role of the cavalry in wars throughout history. \"I Wanna Be in the Cavalry\" kicks off record and is a tour de force. The song mixes historical references with a country-Celtic vibe to create an epic country anthem; with this song alone, Lund declares he has arrived as Canada's next king of country.\n\nOther highs include the playful, \"Family Reunion,\" and the tongue-in-cheek poke at Mormons, \"Brother Brigham, Brother Young.\""
