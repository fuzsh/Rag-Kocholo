        "text": "Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The history of Spring Lake as we know it started on April 29, 1875 when Captain Samuel Forman and Elizabeth Osborn sold their farm to the Spring Lake Beach Improvement Company for the amount of $82,000 to begin the development of the Spring Lake Beach Resort. The Osborns were early settlers to the area, with family service in both the Revolutionary and Civil wars.Â Abraham Osborn purchased 150 acres in the southern part of town in 1838 and through the years added to his holdings.Â In 1845, the property was passed to his son Samuel Forman “in consideration of natural love and five dollars”.Â The family continued to expand their holdings to 286 acres by 1875, and at that time it was still under the ownership of Captain Forman Osborn. The irregular parcel extended from Wreck (Rack) Pond to property surrounding Spring Lake (Fresh Pond).Â It encompassed a major portion of what we refer to as the South End.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Robert Hunter Morris was the original patentee under the N.J. Eastern Board of Proprietors and there is documentation his shares were returned in 1760. Â Â Later the property was acquired by Jeremiah Chandler and sold by him to Samuel Emmons on April 23, 1832. Samuel Emmons sold Abraham Osborn 150 acres for $900 in 1838, reserving 37 acres for Alexander Luker whose acreage Abraham purchased in 1839. The Osborn’s added to their holdings by purchasing more land tracts of the original Morris parcel from owners Frances Brindley, and Annaniah Gifford. It was circa 1840, the house referred to in print as the Old Farm House, was most likely built; although it could predate 1800 if Robert Morris has constructed a house on his property.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Captain Forman Osborn, born in 1806 in Wall Township, was a prominent, well-known man of his day.Â The family of English and Irish descent is traced back to Col. Abraham Osborn the grandfather, a colonel during the Revolutionary War.Â When a young man, Forman Osborn came to Spring Lake and acquired the farm tract on which he resided during the greater part of his life.Â When eighteen, he was an officer on a sea vessel, having followed the water many years of his early life. He married Elizabeth Bailey of Manasquan in 1836 and they moved to Spring Lake (then Wall Township) about 1839. Â The couple had seven children who were born in the farmhouse and received their education in the area:Â Abram, Franklin, Cornelius, Ann, Adelaide, Charlotte, and Florence.Â Abram, a non-commissioned officer in service during the Civil War, took part in the hard fought battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Osborn Family, according to the records available, was prosperous and a large land owner.Â On the census records and map they appeared to be in residence in the area in 1830.Â In 1850, Forman Osborn is presented on the census as having assets of $10,000 and in 1860, it increased to $15,000.Â An accounting book dated 1851, 1852, and 1853, found in the old farmhouse and donated to the Spring Lake Historical Society, shows customers’ purchases of goods such as coffee, tobacco, sugar, molasses, fish, comb, calico, thread, etc.Â The account names are listed with their dated purchases and the charge for each item. However, it is not evidenced that it was the accounting of sales for the Osborn Farm.Â According to Captain Forman’s granddaughter, Florence Osborn Engelken, the farm included an orchard of fruit trees, particularly pears and apples, but no purchase of those items shows up in this accounting book. Either the orchard came after the 1850’s, or the produce was never sold for profit, or the book did not reflect this Osborn farm.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The house has a close affiliation with the sea.Â The construction of it, as related by Florence, stated it was made from salvaged materials from the wrecks of ships on the beach found especially in the springtime.Â She contended the floors were teakwood stripped from the decks of wrecked ships, and the dining room floor covering at one time was a sail cloth from a ship, the cloth had been given many coats of lacquer.Â The house once had a Widows Walk on its eastern side, a typical feature of homes by the ocean for family to look for the return of their seafaring loved ones. Â The main girders of the house are hand hewn beams, and the joists are secured with wooden pegs. The house was described as having a wing which had been the cabin of a ship found wrecked on the beach.Â The cabin was added to the house and at times used as a kitchen or guest quarters.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Amazingly, this oldest home in Spring Lake has kept most of its original interior features.Â The entry door is called cross and bible as it is styled as a cross dividing the door into the four books of the bible. One enters into a large foyer highlighted with original molding, and almost all the hardware in the home is original.Â The windows are the original six over six, with panes rippled and imperfect.Â The walls were finished in whatever materials were available including sand and eggshells.Â Natural brick fireplaces are found on the main floor and are graced with the same molding as in the foyer.Â The kitchen fireplace has the hearth once used for cooking.Â Fireplace heating was a difficult task according to Forman’s granddaughter, “Grandfather cut down great trees, and hauled them with oxen to the back door, where they were chopped to keep the fires burning.Â In the event the fire extinguished, a trip to a neighboring farm was made to obtain fire to relight.”Â Behind the kitchen in the “family room” there is an original stove, Dutch doors, and on the adjacent porch, shingles original to the building.Â The three sleeping rooms on the second floor were part of this c. 1840 structure.Â This was an era before closets so their modest wardrobes were hung on wooden wall pegs.Â The smallest bedroom has the design of a Captain’s Quarters.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The unique history of this home is its service as the Spring Lake Golf Clubhouse when the Club was established as a 9-Hole course in 1898.Â At that time, this structure was located at 411-413 Mercer Avenue and was only moved to its present location at 412 Sussex Avenue around 1912 â a move of one backyard to another.Â The golf course was laid over streets and between houses.Â Dr. Patterson said when he lived on Monmouth Avenue one could hear the balls when they struck the metal holes, and every once in a while a window was broken.Â The caddies received 15 cents for going around the course which started at the Osborn House, went south to Essex Avenue between 3rd and 4th Avenues, and continued south crossing Monmouth to Atlantic Avenue and crossing Salem following 3rd Avenue south until Wreck Pond, staying on the north side of the pond.Â Tee #5 started back on the east side of the first four holes heading north and the last hole, #9, diagonally cut northwest to end at 4th and Sussex Avenues. Â A sign was in front of the clubhouse, “Golf Club Rules Flag Pole”, and the pole was a ship’s mast. In 1909 the Club decided it was losing too much land to home building, bought the Thompson Farm and moved across Wreck Pond to Wall Township (Spring Lake Heights) about 1911.Â The Thompson Farmhouse, located on the east side of the Manasquan-Long Branch Turnpike (Route 71), became the new clubhouse with the golf course extending to the west.Â Eventually this building became the popular landmark known as Doolan’s, presently The Shore Club.Â In 1916, a new Spring Lake Golf Clubhouse was built at its present site on the course on Warren Avenue in Spring Lake Heights. Consequently the holes on the course had to be somewhat reconfigured to start the game at the newly built clubhouse.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Founding families and early settlers of Spring Lake Beach also helped mark this home as one of great importance in Spring Lake’s history.Â Upon the purchase of the farm tract, Dr. Willits of the Spring Lake Beach Improvement Company resided there while he built his lakeside home on Passaic Avenue. The Devine Family lived in the house for a year when they first arrived in Spring Lake.Â Â Richard Devine was one the first Councilmen upon the incorporation of Spring Lake as a town, and the park around the lake is named after the Devines.Â The Browns lived in the Old Farm House for a while. Oliver H. Brown was the mayor of North Spring Lake and later the mayor of the incorporated Borough of Spring Lake with a thriving business on Third Avenue in town. His brother Peter Brown was a very prosperous real estate developer along with his brother. Â Another well-known steward of the home was Benjamin Patterson, businessman and brother to Mayor Patterson and Secretary of the Spring Lake Country Club. In 1916, Mr. John K. Danby of Wilmington, Delaware purchased the home.Â Mr. Danby was an antique dealer and he opened it every year as an antique shop until he sold it in 1925.Â Early Spring Lake Gazette newspapers advertised it as, “Spring Lake, 412 Sussex Avenue, THE OLD FARM HOUSE,Â Antiques.”\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Regretfully, the town will be saying “Good Bye” to this historic house and just as the farm was divided up to allow for a resort town to be built, this too will become part of our past history.Â The Society is very grateful to all the previous owners and the present family who have kept the house “as it was” through all its years. Â It will be missed, but its ghosts and memories are still residing in our files and in the hearts of the surviving members of the families that lived in the OLD FARM HOUSE.\n\n~~~ Barbara Kolarsick-Harrigan, PresidentÂ Â Â Â\n\nSpring Lake Historical Society ArchivesÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Grand hotels and summer “cottages” that were built here in the early years defined the beginning of a resort from a farming/fishing area of Wall Township.Â Upon discovering “Fresh Creek Pond”, now called Spring Lake, Rev. Dr. Alphonso Willets of Philadelphia formed the Spring Lake Beach Improvement Company in 1875 to procure investors from Philadelphia to help develop the area as a resort known as Spring Lake Beach.Â His initial intention was to establish a Methodist Meeting Camp for religious purposes like Ocean Grove’s summer colony. Instead of a religious colony, business leaders of the company, including the Rev. Dr. Willits, focused on building hotels and guest cottages to accommodate the anticipated wealthy visitors expected to vacation at the beach and lake. The extension of the rail line south from Long Branch in 1875 contributed a lot to the growth of the resort.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The 266 acre Osborn Farm was purchased by the company and groundbreaking on the first and largest hotel, the Monmouth House, was started in November of 1875. It was situated between Spring Lake, “Fresh Creek Pond”, and the ocean. The Monmouth House opened for business in June of 1876. Â It catered to the wealthy, offered broad piazzas, large well-ventilated rooms, and electric calls in every apartment. The 250 room hotel featured a 1,000 seat dining room, two large ocean view parlors, heat, gas lights, a steam-operated elevator, and was 50 yards from the ocean.Â Furniture for the hotel had been brought in by May, 1876, and delivered by rail from Grand Rapids, Michigan, a popular supplier at that time.Â President Ulysses S. Grant was one of its visitors and early guests.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â On September 19, 1900, the Monmouth House and twelve other buildings were destroyed in the worst fire in Spring Lake’s history. Three years later, the hotel was completely rebuilt and renamed the New Monmouth Hotel.Â The New Monmouth Hotel was built at a cost of $350,000 funded by Philadelphia and Trenton capital. Marquis Martin Maloney, philanthropist and Philadelphia utilities mogul was the largest stockholder, State Senator O.H. Brown of Spring Lake Beach was a shareholder and director, and David R. Plummer of Lakewood served as general manager.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Over the years, the Monmouth was host to balls, week-end concerts, dinner dances, and Sunday night buffets where ice carvings of swans gracefully decorated the serving table.Â There was intimate dancing in the Bermuda Room, Thursday night galas, and Hawaiian luaus at poolside.Â The hotel was almost a town in itself; single and double tennis courts, grand ballroom, laundry, and three kitchens.Â It even had its own power generator.Â After three generations of ownership by the Duggan family, it was demolished in 1975, and the property sold for private building lots.Â Changing vacation habits which led to economic infeasibility was blamed for its demise.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â By 1877, more construction had been completed in Spring Lake Beach.Â The Carleton House, located diagonally across the street from the Monmouth House between Monmouth and Atlantic Avenues, was built at this time. This hotel would be destroyed by the fire of 1900 and never rebuilt. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Lake House had been bought from Philadelphia’s 1876 Centennial Exhibition and brought to the corner of Fifth and Warren Avenues, now Potter Park.Â This three-wing building had been used as an information center and meeting place at the U.S. 1876 celebration in Philadelphia.Â As a hotel, it featured a bowling alley, a popular sport at that time. The Lake House was demolished in 1904 and the bowling alley was saved and eventually ended up at Alexander’s, a popular establishment on Third Avenue.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Also, during this same period, many other cottages were being built by a number of developers. The Hastings Square Co., formed by Anna Baird, built 10 surf cottages on the block between Essex and Sussex Avenues on Ocean Avenue, extending back to First Avenue.Â Cottages were appealing to some people as they offered more privacy. The two largest cottages were the Essex House and the Sussex House, which had their own dining rooms and were essentially small hotels.Â They were all located on the block north of the Monmouth House. Â In 1891, Susan Urie purchased the Hastings Square block and was proprietor of the ten cottages.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The disastrous fire of 1900 burned the Essex House, but not the Sussex House nor the cottage in between the two corner cottages on the ocean.Â In 1901, the Sussex was damaged by fire, but restored and joined with the remaining cottage adjacent to it to become the Essex and Sussex Hotel.Â Other Urie-owned cottages were subsequently lost to fires, and, other than the Essex and Sussex Hotel, the last remaining cottage on the ocean, the Breakers, was destroyed in the fire of 1909. In 1913, to make room for Susan Urie’s ambitious project to build a grand hotel, the Essex and Sussex Hotel was moved to the north side of Essex Avenue, adjacent to First Avenue and facing the New Monmouth Hotel. (The present E & S parking lot area). The wooden sided cottages would be joined to the newly constructed mostly brick faÃ§ade hotel.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The new Essex & Sussex Hotel, built in 1914, opening on July 1 of that year, copied the previous lines, columns, porches, and roof lines of the original hotel, and along with the Monmouth was one of the largest hotels in town. Susan Urie sold it to The Hastings Square Hotel Company in March of 1914 before it opened in July.Â Officers and directors of the Hastings Square Company included wealthy and influential men: Mayor and former Senator Oliver H. Brown, Fred F. Schock, Sr., Benjamin Pearce, David Plummer, Samuel Heilner, and Alexander Hemphill.Â The building was planned with five stories and a basement; a foyer 148 feet long, 45 feet wide, with columns and two fireplaces; and, a main dining room to accommodate 240 guests.Â Also planned were a Palm Court, Music Room, Children’s Dining Room, Power Plant, Barber Shop, and staff rooms. Its garage was located on Morris Avenue between Second and Third Avenues because overnight parking was not allowed on the streets at that time, nor is it today. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This quote is from an early hotel brochure, Opened July 1, 1914, to those “seeking the highest class of summer season hospitality.”Â Those few words underscore what made the Essex and Sussex famous.Â As remembered by the late George Burton, a longtime bar manager at the Essex and Sussex, The Monmouth was a gracious place; it attracted the sporting crowd, a younger crowd.Â The Essex and Sussex was a little more formal, a little more staid.Â They used to come down on the train and bring big trunks with them.Â Â It took three or four hours to get here from North Jersey, New York, and Philadelphia, and guests often stayed the entire season.Â In 1929, the north wing was added to the hotel, providing an additional seventy-five guest rooms. Otherwise, the face of the 6-story structure had undergone only such cosmetic freshening as paint for the pillars, cupolas and shutters, and the addition of the three-story portico that dominated the view from the oceanfront.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â During the years of ownership by the Schock Family, an original investor, it flourished as the summer retreat of the socially and politically prominent, as well as the hosting of both private and public social events. In 1955, the Essex Lounge was opened to the public and offered dancing and entertainment for the guests. In 1964, the Fiftieth Anniversary was celebrated with a Ball.Â Among the invited guests were the Hon. And Mrs. Richard Nixon and Gov. and Mrs. Richard J. Hughes.Â The Schock Family sold the hotel to the Essex and Sussex Hotel Corporation in 1970, which in turn sold it in 1976 to Charles and Terri Carroll.Â They operated the hotel until 1985, the hotel’s final season.Â During this period, scenes from the movie, Ragtime, starring James Cagney, Pat O’Brien, and Mary Steenburgen were filmed at the hotel and on its beachfront.Â After the hotel complex was sold to be converted by the new owner into condominiums, the plans were halted in 1989 by the bank which held the mortgage.Â During bank ownership, the original Urie Essex & Sussex hotel/cottages, were taken down because they posed a safety hazard due to their deteriorated condition.Â In 1993, the Joseph Barry Applied Development Company purchased the hotel, rehabbed it and converted the building into the quite popular senior-owned, kitchen-restricted condominiums of today.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Another building which sprung up around the lake was the Hulett Cottage at 106 Sussex Avenue, one of about 10 buildings built by George Hulett, originally of Freehold. Hulett purchased lumber from the buildings of the 1876 Centennial Exhibit in Philadelphia so it is safe to assume this cottage was constructed using some of that lumber. It was later called the Wedgewood, and after that known as Ashling Cottage, operated until recently as a guest house.Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Missouri House on Ocean Road was bought and then shipped from the Centennial Exhibit in Philadelphia, and established first as a residence before becoming the Rainbow Cottage in 1921.Â Sometime later it was renamed Arragea Hytte.Â In WWII, it was used as a rest home for soldiers.Â The Missouri House is beautifully restored as a private residence and maintains the “M” identification on the front.Â Â At 207 Atlantic Avenue, in 1877, lumber from the Portuguese Pavilion of the 1876 Centennial Exhibit was used to re-erect that government building as a private home.Â By 1890, it had become a cottage called the Barry House; then, sometime later it was known as the Billows.Â This structure was torn down in the early 1980’s.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Located at First and Sussex Avenues, the Ocean House has a long standing history as an accommodating hotel/guest house. Margaret Devine of Philadelphia purchased the land and commissioned the building of a boarding cottage named Ocean House. The Sussex Avenue entrance leads to the reception lobby which includes the historic staircase transported in the late 1870’s from the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition.Â A ten foot portion of the staircase is in the Smithsonian as the full staircase did not fit in the building. This hotel closed the 19th century as the Baltimore, becoming the Colonial early in the 20th century with ownership passing to businessman O.H. Brown.Â Mr. Brown furnished it with some of the dressers and stands and accessories from his fine furniture shop on Third Avenue in town. The hotel was operated by Henry Taylor and Roscoe Jones. Henry and his wife, Margaret, purchased the hotel in 1928, added to the size and changed the faÃ§ade to stucco. Oliver H. Brown had given the Taylors a loan in 1928 to help finance the purchase, and the estate of O.H. Brown extended the loan through the Depression and up into the 1940’s. The Taylor’s son, Harold, and daughter-in-law, Dorothy, joined his parents in operating the hotel before it was sold to the Mitchells in the 1980’s, who then renamed it the Colonial Ocean House. In 1998 the Kaloostian Family purchased it, and today the Ocean House still operates under the capable proprietorship of the Kaloostian Family.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Records show that in the late 1880’s, James Sexton owned the land at Fifth and Warren Avenues, and had erected a building there.Â That building would subsequently be known as the Chateau Inn.Â Sexton had owned and operated a funeral home at that location for a short time, and according to The Seaside Gazette, he opened a cigar store and upholstering business there also. By 1905, maps indicate the property was known as the “Spring Lake Inn”.Â The Villa, a typical summer cottage, was built circa 1905 on Warren Avenue facing Potter Park.Â It would become annexed to the Chateau Inn and, the annex created a courtyard with the original Inn.Â Through the years, additions have extended the original building north along Fifth Avenue. At one point, it also was advertised as the Chateau Motel. It gained prominence the early 1950’s as “the summer home of the stars.” A number of rooms were named for celebrity guests such as Geraldine Page, Buster Keaton, Constance Bennett, and Basil Rathbone.Â Other guests have included Ann Margaret, Rod Laver, Arthur Treacher, Edward Everett Horton, Julius LaRosa, Hermione Gingold, and baseball player Gil McDougal.Â In 1988, a second story was added, along with a widow’s watch, to the original structure.Â Under the stewardship of the Smith family, dating back to 1951 and into the 21st century, the Chateau prospered, was preserved and is a notable landmark when entering Spring Lake.Â Today’s Chateau Inn and Suites’ charm and quality accommodations continue under the proprietorship of Scosmic Inc.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In 1892, Haddon Hall was built on Monmouth Avenue overlooking the south shore of Spring Lake and featured a “house-type” front. It was renamed The Gray Swan Inn in 1907.Â The guest house was bought in 1930 by Frank Van Brunt who added 60 rooms, a new dining room, and changed its name to the Shoreham Hotel.Â In 1953, George Pottle installed elevators, sprinklers, a pool, and a very popular cocktail lounge in the hotel.Â Guests were transported around town in a carriage with a surrey on top. Paul and Lorraine Sciurba bought it in 1982, refurbished and updated it, including air-conditioning, but sold it to Adeline Schofel in 1988.Â She renovated it some more; however, other problems caused her to declare bankruptcy in 1991 resulting in a mortgage foreclosure. During her proprietorship, evening entertainment included karaoke, live Broadway entertainment and a cozy cocktail lounge.Â Carmel Quinn, famed Irish entertainer, made the Shoreham her summer home. The Shoreham was torn down in the 1990’s and three residential houses were erected on the land.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â One of many of the early guest accommodating hotel/cottages was the Palmer House built in 1886. In 1923, the Palmer House was renamed the Lake View by its owner, M. L. Miller. The Lakeview and Shoreham were similar in size and architectural style. In 1950, Mr. & Mrs. Morris bought the hotel and also bought the house to the back of the Lake View called the Ridgewood and used it as an annex for additional guests. The front portion of the Lake View was once owned by Martin Maloney and was used by him as a summer house for his guests.Â The Lake View was torn down in 1981. Another early hotel was the Atlantic House which sat on the corner of Third and Atlantic Avenues until it was torn down about fourteen years ago.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â At 104 Salem Avenue is the Spring Lake Hotel, built by Timothy Hurley in 1888 and known as Timothy Hurley’s Grand Central Stables Carriage House, a stagecoach stop with hotel rooms on the top floor for the coachmen. Originally it was located at First and Atlantic Avenues across from the Monmouth Hotel before being moved and converted.Â Mr. Hurley was the town’s first dog pound keeper and part of the kennel still stands on Atlantic Avenue behind the hotel. Through the years it was upgraded and improvements were made by multiple different owners. The hotel still offers guests relaxing, charming accommodations.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In 1876, Smith Hughes of Germantown, PA began construction on cottages using the wood which had been used for the Agricultural Hall from the 1776 Centennial.Â Two cottages were joined and known as the Seaholm Hotel.Â Eventually four cottages would be joined and called the Hewitt-Wellington. It is still situated on West Lake and Monmouth Avenues. In 1900, the 3-story high columned entryway was not yet there, but early 1900 photos show the high entryway was soon added.Â There were various owners and operators of the hotel from 1882 â 1926.Â During this period it was noted as a luxurious holiday retreat for the wealthy.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In the early 1950’s the Hewitt-Wellington was purchased by Margaret and Michael Malone, who, along with their ten children operated the hotel.Â Upgrades were made to the hotel and rooms were given names which matched their dÃ©cor.Â There was the “Wicker Room”, the “Pink Room”, complete with a pink velvet sofa, and the “Soda Room” where guests could enjoy a soda from the old-fashioned ice chest.Â It was a family-oriented hotel and often included sing-alongs on rainy or cold evenings.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In 1978, the hotel was sold to Lynn and Ralph Davino and Lynn’s parents and brother, the Stantons.Â It was often used for weddings, conferences, and seminars.Â It was also used as a backdrop for multiple modeling shoots.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A partnership between CT Investments, Inc. and Prospect Ventures, Inc. purchased the property in 1987, and turned it into Spring Lake’s first condominium hotel, minus cooking facilities, consisting of 29 rooms and suites. Â Improvements were made including a new swimming pool.Â A gourmet restaurant, “Whispers,” is also located in the building.Â Â\n\nThe Breakers, not to be confused with present day Breakers, sat on Ocean Avenue north of the Sussex Cottage in Spring Lake Beach and was destroyed by fire in 1909, but was not rebuilt. Originally it was known as the Aldine and Louis N. Moss was the proprietor.Â It was similar in construction to the Shoreham Hotel with its circular porch and columned entranceway. It was a very upscale hotel and would have been in competition for the rich and famous with the Monmouth Hotel, a block away. (Maybe that’s why it was never rebuilt after the fire).\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Built Circa 1888, Moorehead Cottage on Atlantic Avenue across from the Monmouth Hotel would become the ever popular Sandpiper Hotel.Â To the east side and part of the cottage’s property was open space converted to a putting green, used by the many guests of both the Monmouth and the Sandpiper hotels.Â The Moorehead Cottage was spared in the great fire of 1900 which destroyed much of Atlantic and Monmouth Avenues, including the original Monmouth House and most of the business district around the Lake.Â In 1937, Edwin and Clara Alexander purchased the Sandpiper and began renovations.Â They changed the cottage’s structure by adding a ground level floor, and had the idea to create an upscale tea house, restaurant, with the hotel above. Â They hoped to attract diners walking to and from the South End Pavilion. The very popular place played host to Albert Einstein, who came from Princeton on weekends to enjoy the relaxing seaside resort.Â Unfortunately, the Sandpiper was torn down about five years ago.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The southern-most situated hotel in Spring Lake Beach was the Allaire at Ocean and Union Avenues.Â In 1886, the land was owned by Allen and Emily Richardson, and in 1895, Emily, one of many women landowners in town, opened the doors of the hotel for the first time. Â The Allaire was quite large, but at that time, only guests of Christian persuasion could enjoy a tennis court, bath houses, and a private beach. Â It featured a sunny southern entrance with a welcoming and comfortable lobby. With its magnificent oceanfront location and superb accommodations it earned its “first class hotel” reputation.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â During the 1940’s, the Allaire was run by Pearl and Orva Holmes of West Belmar, NJ.Â They both had married into the Colgate Toothpaste family, but were divorced when they became the hotel entrepreneurs.Â It was during this time that Jack Sullivan, of the later famous Sullivan’s Night Club, who was employed at the hotel, earned the reputation as “the host of the coast”. The Holmes sisters also hosted visiting stars such as Basil Rathbone, Arthur Treacher and Ruth Gordon, who stayed at the Allaire while performing for the Ivy Tower Playhouse at the Spring Lake Community House.Â John McNab succeeded the Holmes sisters as owner in 1950.Â Under his management the “Shipmate’s Room” became a famous watering hole for summer visitors.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â About five years after that, Lester Harvey, Sr. operated the hotel until Richard Carroll purchased the Allaire in 1969.Â Carroll’s other brothers owned and operated the Warren Hotel and the Essex and Sussex.Â It was during Richard’s management that Spring Lake is believed to have been advertised as the “Irish Riviera”; although, the phrase is attributed to Mr. Farrell, a former manager of the Monmouth.Â However, with changing times, the Allaire lost much of its earlier appeal and fell into disrepair. The hotel, long vacant and out of character with the surrounding neighborhood, was razed during the summer of 1989.Â There are now nine homes where the century-old landmark once stood.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Mrs. Emma Lucas, another business woman, purchased three lots in 1891 from James Moses and erected a double four-storied building that became known as the “Lucas Cottages.”Â The Warren Hotel was built in their place.Â Under different owners in 1921, the west and south portions were added to the original cottage.Â All the additions were framed to match the original building; the stucco finish was added later.Â An additional “Beach House” was purchased to give the Warren oceanfront lodging.Â This Victorian building had been erected for Mr. A. D. Logan in the 1880’s.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In 1939, Fred and Amelia Cosgrove purchased the furnished Warren Hotel.Â During this period, there were costume parties, scavenger hunts, and hayrides for the guests.Â It was a family-oriented clientele and the guests were not transient, often staying for a month at a time.Â The hotel was seasonal, only open from Memorial Day to Labor Day. The Warren once entertained famous personalities including Bob Hope and Rocky Marciano.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In the early 1970’s, the Warren was purchased by Chuck Carroll, who then sold it to his sister, Mary Carroll Long and her husband Thomas Long.Â It was one of the last full-American hotels which offered three meals a day included in the rate, and one of the last few “old-guard” hotels where guests could stay for the entire summer. The Longs upgraded all the two hundred rooms of the Victorian style hotel.Â A great deal of the Warren’s business was generated by its banquet facility, which could accommodate between 50 and 450 guests.Â The Warren was advertised as one of the last dining rooms between New York City and Atlantic City to offer live music and dancing. Â People who stayed there could attest that the Warren’s main hallway had changed very little over sixty-five years. Â As were most of the other bigger hotels in Spring Lake, the Warren was torn down in 2001, and the very popular Beach House met the same fate soon after.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Wilburton-By-The-Sea was built by C.W. Tuttle in 1882 on Ocean and Newark Avenues in the area then known as Brighton, part of North Spring Lake.Â It was a four-story structure with two high towers and wide verandas to enjoy the view. A telegraph office was also established at the hotel.Â In 1885, there was a lot of competition to buy it from a sheriff’s sale, and records show L. Nzaire Moss owned and operated it in 1909. Sometime between 1909 and 1914, it was renamed the Breakers following the destruction by fire of the Spring Lake Beach hotel by that name. The 110-room boarding house/hotel had a bathroom at the end of each hall, operating that way for many years.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Cosmos Scardino purchased it from the Cody family in 1980 and did extensive renovations. The interior was gutted and private baths, Jacuzzis, VCRs, and other modern amenities were added. With special allowance granted, it opened as a year-round hotel, cultivating corporate businesses, weddings, etc. In the later 20th century, in order for the Breakers and other similar resort hotels to remain solvent, it was necessary for these hotels to continue operation throughout the year. In 1989, a State Senate bill, nicknamed “The Breakers Bill,” was passed which has allowed hotels, guest houses, rooming houses and boarding houses on the Atlantic Ocean to operate on a year-round basis.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Letchworth hotel was erected circa 1883 and was named for John Letchworth of Philadelphia, who built and operated the hotel.Â It overlooked the bluffs (dunes) and its own private beach in the Brighton area of North Spring Lake, next to the Breakers.Â Sarah and Alice Letchworth operated the hotel from 1907 to 1926 when they sold it to two school teachers, Winifred Gilmartin and Kathryn Hyle of Glen Cove, NJ. They would teach from autumn to spring, then come down and open the hotel during the summer months. (These are two more examples of respectable women’s roles in the business of operating hotels in Spring Lake).\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In 1949, the Letchworth was purchased by Anna McCaffrey and Rosemary and William T. Schreck. They added a chef’s room and a bathroom to the third floor.Â On the outside, the Schrecks added a back porch and installed a driveway on the south side of the building.Â Subsequent owners, starting in 1967 have also remodeled, made changes, and operated this inn.Â It was renamed the Kenilworth in 1981 when it was purchased by Ross Mason, whose hometown in England was of that name.Â In 1989, a different owner’s manager embezzled over $18,000.Â 1990 saw a new owner who renamed it The Grand Victorian.Â It now operates as a year round inn with a restaurant open to the public.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There were numerous cottages/hotels that existed in Spring Lake with notable histories.Â This article has provided information on the ones most documented, starting in Spring Lake’s earliest times.Â Following is a list of others that the reader may recognize and remember:\n\nMoulton House, Ludlow Ave. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â La Maison, Jersey Ave. (Layton House)\n\nThe Normandy Inn, Tuttle Ave.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Sea Crest, Tuttle Ave. (Carolina House)\n\nThe Carriage House, Jersey Ave.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Sarann, First Ave.\n\nThe Johnson House Inn, Tuttle Ave.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Victoria House, Monmouth Ave.\n\nStone Post Inn, Washington Ave.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Beachcomber, Ocean Rd.\n\nThe Shamrock Lodge (White Lilac) Central Ave.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Pennsylvania Hotel, Ocean Rd.\n\nVilla Park Inn, Ocean Rd.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Tara House, Jersey Ave.\n\nJack Sullivan’s Lodge, Fifth& Passaic Aves.\n\nSpring Lake Historical Society Archives\n\nBarbara Kolarsick-Harrigan"
