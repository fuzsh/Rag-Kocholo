        "text": "OUR BOURBON\n\nHaving studied at some of the oldest distilleries, we decided to start American Freedom Distillery, where the spirit of our commitment and dedication to excellence lives on—and the journey has paid off. From grain to glass, Horse Soldier Bourbon Whiskey is handmade with all-natural ingredients, bottled in the heartland of America, and aged to perfection.\n\nOur bourbon is award-winning, having won accolades of the highest honors from world spirits competitions. Most recently, we won double gold three times in the 2022 San Francisco World Spirits Competition—an accomplishment we’re honored to have achieved.\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF\n\nHORSE SOLDIER\n\nThe story begins at ground zero.\n\nThe Horse Soldier Bourbon story is woven into the fabric of one of America’s most historic moments. Just days after 9/11, elite teams of Green Berets were inserted into Afghanistan, some on horseback. Dubbed the “Horse Soldiers”, their exploits were retold in the Hollywood blockbuster 12 strong, the CNN documentary \"Legion of Brothers\", and memorialized by America’s Response Monument located at Ground Zero in New York City.\n\nHorse Soldier Farms\n\nThe future of Horse Soldier Bourbon has brought us home to Somerset-Pulaski County in Kentucky. Many of us at Horse Soldier Bourbon are from the Bluegrass state, and naturally, our call to arms was sounded during a training mission on the Cumberland River after the first World Trade Center tower was hit. Pulaski County will soon be the location of Horse Soldier Farms, our world-class distillery and tourist experience for all to enjoy."
