        "text": "Canadian singer-songwriter\n\nCorb Lund is a Canadian country and western singer-songwriter from Taber, Alberta, Canada. He has released eleven albums, three of which are certified gold. Lund tours regularly in Canada, the United States and Australia, and has received several awards in Canada and abroad.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nCorb Lund grew up in Southern Alberta living on his family's farm and ranches near Taber, Cardston and Rosemary.[3] Lund left his hometown of Taber and moved to Edmonton, where he enrolled in the Grant MacEwan College to study jazz guitar and bass.\n\nLund was a founding member of The Smalls. The band retired in the fall of 2001 but reunited in 2014 for a string of shows, the so-called \"Slight Return\" tour.[4]\n\nLund formed his country trio, the Corb Lund Band, in 1995.[5] He turned his attention to his own band exclusively when the Smalls broke up in 2001.[5] The band changed its name to \"Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans\" in 2005[5] shortly after guitarist Grant Siemens joined the group, and has been touring and recording under that title ever since.\n\nOther media\n\n[edit]\n\nLund starred as the 50-year-old oilfield contractor Ray Mitchell in the 2022 Canadian film Guitar Lessons.[6]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLund currently lives in Lethbridge, Alberta, and spends much of his downtime at his family ranch east of Mountain View, Alberta.[7]\n\nThe Hurtin' Albertans\n\n[edit]\n\nCorb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans are a Canadian country music band, formerly known as the Corb Lund Band. The Hurtin' Albertans is Lund's touring band. They have released nine albums to critical acclaim.[8][9] The band tours regularly in Canada, the United States and Australia. Much of their time is spent in the Canadian Prairies and the American southwest.\n\nThe band's members are:\n\nSean Burns, bass\n\nGrant \"Demon\" Siemens, guitar and other strings\n\nLyle Molzan/Brady Valgardson, drums\n\nFormer Members:\n\nRyan \"Vik\" Vikedal, drums\n\nKurt Ciesla, bass\n\nKarie Brown, bass\n\nThe band has toured Europe, where they played the UK Glastonbury Festival, and Australia several times. The group was featured in the movie \"Slither\" (2006) and were part of the soundtrack to the 2008 documentary, \"Holler Back: (Not) Voting in an American Town.\" They have also provided accompaniment for an NBC special in 2006, on which former world figure skating champion and fellow Albertan, Kurt Browning, performed a routine to \"Expectation and the Blues\". Their music can also be heard in the ski film \"Nine Winters Old.\"\n\nLund signed a three-album deal with New West Records (home of Dwight Yoakam, Steve Earle, Kris Kristofferson and other major artists) in 2009. His first record on New West, Losin' Lately Gambler, was released in September 2009.\n\nCorb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans played their 2009 single \"Long Gone to Saskatchewan\" in Ottawa for the 2011 Canada Day ceremonies in the presence of the newlywed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their Royal visit to Canada.[10]\n\nCorb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans released their seventh studio album, Cabin Fever, on August 14, 2012. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Canadian Albums Chart. In June 2013, the album was longlisted for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize.\n\nCorb Lund released Things That Can't Be Undone in 2015. Lund worked with producer Dave Cobb (Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell) to explore new styles and sounds on the album.[11] The album appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 Chart in December that year.[12]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Album details Peak chart positions Certifications\n\n(sales threshold) CAN\n\n[13] US Country\n\n[14] US\n\nHeat\n\n[15] Modern Pain\n\nRelease date: October 13, 1995\n\nLabel: Outside\n\nFormats: CD, cassette\n\n— — — Unforgiving Mistress\n\nRelease date: October 22, 1999\n\nLabel: Outside\n\nFormats: CD, cassette\n\n— — — Five Dollar Bill\n\nRelease date: June 11, 2002\n\nLabel: Stony Plain, Loose (Europe)\n\nFormats: CD\n\n— — —\n\nCAN: Gold[16]\n\nHair in My Eyes Like a Highland Steer\n\nRelease date: September 6, 2005\n\nLabel: Stony Plain, Loose (Europe)\n\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\n— — —\n\nCAN: Gold[17]\n\nHorse Soldier!
