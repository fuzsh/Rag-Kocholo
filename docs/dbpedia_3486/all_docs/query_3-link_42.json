        "text": "“Legendary Men...Legendary Spirits...” identifies the pursuit of our passions and shows through in everything we do. Beginning in 2015, our team initially traveled to Yellowstone on a journey to discover our next chapters in life. That adventure led us to our first distillery tour sparking a passion that has since taken us across the globe seeking the best and brightest of the distilling world. We have trained with some of the best distillers in Kentucky, Ireland and Scotland. These lessons have been brought home to improve our distilling process and the selection of our key ingredients. This powerful combination of art and science is what separates us from others. Our bourbon is award-winning, having won accolades of the highest honors from world spirits competitions. Most recently, we won double gold three times in the 2022 San Francisco World Spirits Competition—an accomplishment we’re honored to have achieved. The Horse Soldier Bourbon story is woven into the fabric of one of America’s most historic moments. Just days after 9/11, elite teams of Green Berets were inserted into Afghanistan, some on horseback. Dubbed the “Horse Soldiers”, their exploits were retold in the Hollywood blockbuster 12 strong, the CNN documentary \"Legion of Brothers\", and memorialized by America’s Response Monument located at Ground Zero in New York City.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://horsesoldierbourbon.com/\n\nExternal link for Horse Soldier Bourbon\n\nIndustry\n\nFood and Beverage Services\n\nCompany size\n\n51-200 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nSt Petersburg, Florida\n\nType\n\nPrivately Held\n\nFounded\n\n2018\n\nSpecialties\n\nWHISKEY, BOURBON, DISTILLERY, LEGENDARY, GREEN BERETS, SPIRITS, 12 STRONG, HORSE SOLDIER, VETERANS, ADVENTURE, and INTEGRITY"
