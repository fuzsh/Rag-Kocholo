It's these same values that represent this ideal alignment between Horse Soldier Bourbon and Spirit of Gallo,\" said John Koko, CEO & Chairman of Horse Soldier Bourbon. He continued, \"From the hills of Afghanistan to the valleys of Somerset Kentucky, we've learned that you are only as good as the company you keep, and we are proud of this new partnership. It positions us for unprecedented growth and preserves our legacy through the best-in-class capabilities and commitment that the entire Spirit of Gallo organization brings to consumers across the country.\"\n\nTerms of the agreement were not disclosed.\n\n(*Based on 16-week IRI/MULO data ending 6/11/2022)\n\nAbout Horse Soldier Bourbon Whiskey\n\nHorse Soldier Bourbon is an authentic, all-American, award-winning, ultra-premium bourbon brand that is hand-crafted with a true sense of integrity, authenticity, and service.
