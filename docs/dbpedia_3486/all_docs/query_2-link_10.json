        "text": "Ripcord Records\n\nLOCATION: 4009 E. 18th Street, Vancouver, WA\n\nOWNER(s): Robert \"Bobby\" Gibson / Gene Breeden / Blaine Allen\n\nTIMESPAN: 1966-1982\n\nMISC NOTES: This was the \"flagship\" label at Gibson Studios / Ripcord Recording, Vancouver, WA. Others in the studio's portfolio of labels were: Vanco Records, Charter Records, and Family Records.\n\nHISTORY Part I: In the early 1960s Gibson Studios was created in a single-story, blue-painted, cinder block building that had previously housed Boyd's Cleaners. The studio was the brainchild of local country guitar ace, Robert \"Bobby\" Gibson. Born and raised in Vancouver - and a pilot almost since childhood - Gibson's interest in skydivers and skydiving inspired the name Ripcord Records, the studio's primary house label. During the Gibson years of ownership/operation, Ripcord's focus was primarily on presenting the recordings of Floyd Earl \"Buzz\" Martin. Martin created popular logger-themed singles and albums. Between 1967 and 1969 Richard \"Rick\" Keefer (b. 1946 - d. 2013) worked as an audio engineer at Gibson/Ripcord. [This was prior to Keefer moving to Seattle and founding Seattle West Recording, Sea-West Records, and Soul West Publishing. Keefer, his studio and Sea-West Records, later moved to Hawaii.]\n\nHISTORY Part II: In the late-1960s another country guitarist/singer, Bakersfield, CA's Gene Breeden, took over Gibson Studios. He changed the facility name to Ripcord Recording. During Breeden's tenure as studio owner/musician/engineer he assembled an in-house group of musicians and focused on reasonably priced \"package deals\" -- generally studio time plus X number of copies of a Ripcord 45 rpm single, a 33 1/3 rpm album, or at times, an album plus X number of a single featuring two tracks from the LP - which he oriented toward country and gospel artists. Under Breeden's reign the \"package\" concept thrived as individual performers and groups flocked to Ripcord from throughout the Northwest and beyond. In the late-1970s Breeden and his musical entourage departed Vancouver for Nashville, TN. At that time he sold the studio to house musician, studio manager and assistant engineer, Blaine Allen. Allen continued to offer recording packages, but sadly, for whatever reason, studio patrons seemed to think he did not have the audio engineering skills of Breeden. From the late-1960s up into into 1980, Ripcord Records had been one of the most prolific record labels in the Northwest. But, business declined until the studio -- and its family of labels: Ripcord, Vanco, Charter and Family -- faded from the Pacific Northwest country music scene.\n\n45 rpm SERIAL NUMBERS: Ripcord 45s started at #0001. The first three releases featured four digits beginning with 000. After #0003 the first 0 was dropped and the sequence continued with thee digits. Initially Ripcord labels had a blue background with black and white accents (0001 through 022). After #036 the series jumped to #101. Not long after Breeden took over the label background was switched to red with black-and-white accents (45-022). When asked why the numbering system change was made, Gene Breeden replied, something to the effect: \"No particular reason. Our secretary at the time just did it!!\" From #101 the series consecutively moved forward to at least #206 before jumping to #303, then ending. There are no known black-on-white labels - which is the promotional standard for most record companies - and only two 45 promotional singles known to have been released during the blue-label years:\n\n45-007 was issued in the traditional retail blue, black and white label format. As a promotional nod, on some discs a black star image was added to the right center of the spindle hole on side 1.\n\n45-010 appeared in an A - A format with a retail blue, black and white color scheme. Each label featured this text: Promotional Copy Not For Sale and PLUG SIDE.\n\n33-1/3 rpm SERIAL NUMBERS: Ripcord albums lunched with #001. Evidently, after #004, the series skipped to #101, and then to #1001. From there it progressed to at least #1092 before the label ceased production. It is believed all LP numbers from 1001 onward, were assigned. During both the blue and red eras there were only two Ripcord Records albums (#003 and #004) issued with a black logo, numerals and lettering on a white background. It is not known if these were \"official\" promotional releases or later pressing anomalies.\n\nSERIAL\n\nARTIST\n\nTITLE\n\nsearch by LABEL\n\nTO SEARCH, PLEASE EITHER SCROLL THE LABEL LIST BELOW (AT LEFT) â€“ OR USE THE SEARCH FIELD BELOW (AT CENTER).\n\nScroll to see all labels\n\nSearch for a name"
