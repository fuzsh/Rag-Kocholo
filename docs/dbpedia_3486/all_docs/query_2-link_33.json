Wild Horses at Stony Point\n\nMy most popular album over the years!\r\n\r\nOriginal liner notes: Dear Friends,\r\n\r\nIt has been more than 2 years since the release of my last album, &quot;Light of the Moon&quot;. That album was unique for me as it was my first project as a solo performer and thus very different from my stringband albums with the Boiled Buzzards. It was a pretty bold move to have gone from music supported by three other musicians to going it alone, but you have been clear to me that it was a success. Thank you.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, and after 5 years on the road as a solo performer, many of you have been asking me for an even bolder project - solo clawhammer banjo! Well, here it is. All instrumental, solo, plain, unadulterated Bare Naked Banjos - four of &#39;em! I sincerely hope you enjoy this one as much as my past projects. I know I enjoyed recording it. \r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\nAbout the recording:\r\n\r\nThis album was recorded by Wes Linenkugel at his home studio in Toledo, Ohio on April 26 &amp; 27, 2000. All of the tunes were played live to a Tascam DA - 30 DAT and appear without any cuts, edits, or punch-ins. The mic used was an Audio-Technica 4050 set about 1 foot from the head. A minimum of &quot;presence&quot; was added, but no other effects in order to maintain a natural sound. The same set-up was used for recording all of the banjos on this album.\r\n\r\nAbout the banjos:\r\n\r\nFour different banjos were played on this album and each tune lists the instrument played. The description of them follows:\r\n\r\n\tVega #2 - 1999 Vega Tubaphone #2 by Deering Banjo Co. - 11&#39; pot with a Tubaphone tone ring, calfskin head and No Knot tailpiece. The maple neck is a standard 26 1/4&quot; scale and has a frailing notch cut in from the 17th fret. It is strung with D&#39;Addario medium banjo stings. I have been amazed by the responsiveness and deep beautiful tone of this instrument. It is currently my main stage instrument. Several years ago, The Deering Banjo Co. of Lemon Grove, CA acquired the Vega Banjo Company and is now hand producing these fine new Vega banjos.\r\n\r\n\t11 13/16&quot; Tubaphone - 1915 (approx.) Vega pot with a Kevin Enoch neck - 11 13/16&quot; pot with Tubaphone tone ring, calfskin head and No Knot tailpiece. The maple neck was built in 1992 by Kevin Enoch of Beltsville, MD. It has a 25&quot; scale with a frailing notch cut in from the 17thfret and the Boiled Buzzard inlaid in the notch. Strung with D&#39;Addario medium banjo stings. It has a deep rich tone especially in the lower register though it is not quite as tonally responsive in the upper. It has a beautiful feel to the neck and the slightly shorter scale length makes it a bit easier to play.\r\n\r\n\tFlesher Fretless - 1990 Minstrel banjo built by Bob Flescher while he lived in Peach Tree City, GA. Bob now resides outside Los Angeles where he continues to make these instruments. The style is based in the 1850-60 Joseph Sweeney instruments and has a 12&quot; pot with calfskin head and wooden tailpiece. It is strung with D&#39;Addario Red classical guitar strings 1, 2, 3, 4, and a 1 for the 5th string. The stained maple neck is fretless with minstrel style peghead and violin tuning pegs. I love the rich deep sound I get by tuning it to open double G tuning.\r\n\r\n\tGoodtime - 1996 Deering Goodtime banjo. 11&quot; pot with Fyberskin head and No Knot tailpiece. The maple neck is low profile with a 26 1/4&quot; scale. Strung with light metal banjo strings. For years, I had been looking for a good sounding, inexpensive but quality instrument, primarily for my students. The Deering Banjo Co. of Lemon Grove, CA put this one out and I bought the first one to be sold in September 1996 at the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS. I find it a pleasure to play, lightweight to carry and just fine for that old time sound. Not as beefy sounding as the Tubaphones, but a nice banjo that is easy to play.",
