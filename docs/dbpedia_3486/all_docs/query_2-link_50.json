        "text": "Nevertheless, the same basic star patterns emerge as a common theme in the Rhineland countryside with a close inspection of the timber framing of homes, painted and carved furniture, the stonework of churches, cemeteries and tombs, and the widespread use of architectural inscriptions. Although smaller and more subtle than the large barn stars of Pennsylvania, these carved, painted, or inscribed stars are often found in significant locations, above doors and windows in centuries-old town houses, carved into arches and fenestration of city gates and churches, inscribed into the eaves or upper gables of timber-frame buildings, or integrated into elaborate house blessings.\n\nBut just as elements of the architecture of the Pennsylvania barn can be traced to parts of Switzerland, so too are Swiss alpine farmsteads, called folkhouses,23 some of the most decorated structures in Europe, combining a wide variety of house inscriptions, geometric motifs, religious emblems, and heraldry, or family crests. This combination of decorative and religious elements produces a decidedly different aesthetic than the barns of Pennsylvania, but the basic star patterns are still present, suggesting the likelihood of a common origin.24\n\nThe appearance of celestial elements on architectural inscriptions is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the European connection to Pennsylvania’s barn stars. Often featuring stars, dates, the names of the founding family or builder, and mottos or religious poetry, European house and barn inscriptions are the intersection point of the religious and the mundane, and the integration of belief into the domestic and agricultural spheres.\n\nLocated above the front door or façade of the house, at the transition between the inner and the outer worlds, separating the public and private, these inscriptions serve as public dedications of establishment and blessings of the house and occupants. While these blessing inscriptions are diverse in format and structure, common themes are present throughout the tradition, indicating a number of parallel approaches to the dedication of a building. Some of these European blessings are no more than date-stones, capturing the specifics of the time of construction, while others are literary and religious, alternately invoking divine protection or offering some inspirational message for those passing by.\n\nTwo excellent examples of these blessing inscriptions, written in tandem with circular star patterns remarkably similar in form and scale to the barn stars of Pennsylvania, adorn the façade of a sixteenth-century Swiss folkhouse in Aeschi, Canton Solothurn. Folkhouses are massive alpine farm dwellings combining the house, barn, stables, and grain storage under one roof for convenience during the harsh winter weather. The Blümlisalp Chalet folkhouse, built in 1571, bears the following prayerful inscription:\n\nHerr Höchster über uns mit deiner Gnaden Hand beschutz uns Haus und Dorf vor Krankheit, Sturm und Brand, Amen. (Highest Lord above us, with your graceful hand protect our house and village from sickness, storm, and fire, Amen.)25\n\nElsewhere on the same structure, an inspirational inscription is also proudly displayed in letters large enough to be read from a short distance:\n\nNicht im Feld und auf den Bäumen, in den Herzen muss es keimen, wann es besser werden soll. (It is not in the field nor in the trees, but it must germinate in the heart, if one is to become better.)\n\nThese two inscriptions characterize two primary genres of architectural blessing inscriptions in Europe, namely, those which serve to invoke the protection of the divine, and those which serve to inspire righteous living.\n\nEchoing the house-name of the Blümlisalp folkhouse in Aeschi, named after a so-called “floral” peak in the Bernese Alps, its latter message, that all true betterment must proceed from the heart, makes use of a botanical metaphor, comparing the refinement of the human soul to the blossoming of a flower. This clever connection may also shed light on two large geometric designs situated directly below the gable of the roof, which appear to blend both floral and celestial geometry, just as the two inscriptions alternately appeal to righteous living on earth and the protection of the heavens.\n\nWhile these two classic examples of European house blessing inscriptions are positively rife with symbolism of the sacred, not all European blessings offer such detailed explanations to accompany the geometric visual depictions of floral and celestial patterns found with them. Just like Pennsylvania’s barn stars, some of the alpine Swiss decorated folkhouses feature large star or floral patterns with no accompanying text to lend meaning to the art. Nevertheless, such stars are often placed in locations that suggest a silent blessing to the structure, such as under the roof overhang or at the upper gable apex, simulating the starry heavens above.\n\nSimilar uses of stars are found in the alpine architecture of Switzerland and Austria, and along the border with northern Italy, as well as in Alsace, France, bordering the Rhine to the west, and across the Rhine in the Black Forest of Germany. While no one region of Europe can claim to be the single point of origin of the Pennsylvania Dutch culture, such is also the case for the Pennsylvania barn star. Just as the Pennsylvania Dutch proceed from a wide variety of European roots to form a distinctly American culture, currents of artistic expressions from many regions poured into Pennsylvania to create new artistic traditions in America.\n\nIn a similar manner in Central Pennsylvania the Great Conewago Presbyterian Congregation established Henderson’s Meetinghouse for Scotch-Irish families and some Pennsylvania Dutch who settled in Adams County, and the structure included a large slate medallion featuring a six-pointed rosette along with the date of 1787 and the name of Joseph Henderson, the founder. The prominence of the rosette in the dedication stone suggests that the Calvinists may have ascribed similar meaning to the rosette.\n\nStars were also prominent in the churches of Europe, where many chapels and country churches were painted with star-ceilings depicting the canopy of the heavens complete with planets and constellations, as well as the sun and moon. These star-ceilings suggested to those worshipping within that the sanctuary mirrored the divine organization of the cosmos, as the creation and dwelling place of God. Star-ceilings were also documented in Pennsylvania churches, such as the Bern Reformed Church of Bern Township, Berks County; however, none of the original ceilings survive to this day.\n\nLater Federal style churches of the early nineteenth century continued the tradition of integrating star patterns into sacred architecture. The 1815 Belleman’s Union Church in Mohrsville, Berks County, once featured six-pointed rosettes in the configuration of clear glass windows on the upper gable ends of the meetinghouse.38 Similarly, sunbursts once accented the gable windows of the 1805 Bindnagel’s Lutheran Church of Palmyra, in Lebanon County. These elements were the standards of Protestant houses of worship up until the Victorian era, when the Gothic Revival reaffirmed the cathedral as a desirable architectural form and the cross once again returned to church architecture, and gradually to rural Pennsylvania communities.\n\nOne might easily observe that some of these expressions are in keeping with marks and ornamentation favored by the building trades, and that stone masons and woodworkers frequently embellished focal points of buildings or used geometric designs in their maker’s marks. However, one need only look to the churchyards and cemeteries to see that such imagery extended beyond the realm of the trades and featured prominently in the symbolism of early gravestones, which were equally an expression of sacred, consecrated space.\n\nGravestones\n\nThese early gravestones commonly record the biographical descriptions of the lives of the faithful departed, including the dates of birth and death, the age at the time of death, as well as the names of spouses or parents, the number of children, or even an occupation or locations of birth and death. These life stories, provided in more or less detail, are framed with varying degrees of ornamentation and religious symbolism.\n\nAgain, the earliest Protestant gravestones deliberately avoided the use of the cross,39 and instead a diverse range of images appeared to serve as reflections of mortality and rebirth. Angels and winged busts suggested the messengers of heaven and the passage of the spirit of the deceased to the afterlife. Hearts depicted the seat of the human soul and its capacity to experience both mortal and divine love, while the skull, crossed bones, the hourglass, and the sickle represented the death of the body, and the harvesting of the soul.40\n\nMany of these symbolic images were pictorial reminders of scriptural passages commonly read at the graveside, such as the image of the crown featured in the comforting words of Christ from the Revelation of John, “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,”41 or the gates of heaven.42 For the vast majority of gravestone symbols, biblical verses both inspired and reinforced the use of particular images, establishing a standard of meaning with the potential to be easily identified and widely recognized.\n\nMany early stones feature images of flowers, especially three blossoms rising out of a funerary urn. This particular motif is commonly accepted as a symbol of resurrection, and repetitions of three invoke the Trinity. But floral patterns as a whole have a wide range of possible interpretations, including the frailty of mortal life as described in the Psalms, “As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field;”43 or represent Christ, the Messiah as described by the Prophet Hosea, “he shall blossom like the lily,” or as the Bridegroom in the Song of Solomon: “I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.”44\n\nThese carved images of flowers also suggest the earthly realm of mortals, where in some gravestones the flowers are depicted at ground level, with a shining star above. One such gravestone, in the cemetery of Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church in Manheim, Lancaster County, was carved for Rosina McGartney, infant daughter of John and Elizabeth McGartney, who was born and died on the same day: May 27, 1784.45 This tragedy inspired the carved image on the stone, depicting the soul of the departed little girl under the illumination of a single star from above and surrounded by flowers below, suggesting her soul’s passage from the earthly realm to the celestial realm of the heavens.\n\nOtt was not only a painter, but the proprietor of the Lenhartsville Hotel, the walls of which featured his paintings and resounded with the jokes and tall-tales his visitors expected as he tended the bar. Ott first began as a painter of decorative tinware, specializing in the curvilinear patterns of birds, tulips, hearts, and flora. After successfully painting a chair for his wife sometime in the 1940s,84 featuring an elaborate hybrid of a star with his floral elements, he decided to take on the challenge of integrating the motifs of barn stars and his classic tinware patterns into something distinctly new. After first practicing on discarded hubcaps, he eventually settled on commercial signboard. By 1951, he was painting “hex signs” in the evening hours from a side porch studio, which visitors from the hotel frequented to buy his wares. His star patterns were an entirely different breed of art than the strictly geometric patterns used by barn painters. Ott never actually painted on barns, but loved to regale his customers with stories of how his paintings had magically provided fertility to the crops, or brought about miraculous life changes to those who bought and displayed them.85\n\nOne of his favorite of these stories was widely circulated in the national news, claiming that two of his hex signs created to magically increase rainfall had been left outside too long against his advice to the farmer, resulting in the flooding of the Delaware River and millions of dollars in damage.86\n\nWhile Ott certainly profited from his tall-tales and performative, artistic persona, he was not the originator of the widespread misconception that traditional barn star motifs held supernatural significance. Early in his career, Ott himself was openly skeptical about this when interviewed by the press, and even let it slip that he started the whole persona as a “joke,” which eventually evolved into a commercial success.87 Implicitly, this story suggests that Ott’s enterprise answered a commercial demand fueled by the interest and misconceptions of visiting tourists, but the history of this public perception predates Ott’s work by decades and is rooted in the tourist travelogues from the early twentieth century.\n\nMyth of the Hex Sign\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the invention of the automobile enabled tourists from all across the Mid-Atlantic to travel to rural Pennsylvania communities. For the first time, these unique communities were subject to the curiosity of visitors eager for explanations of the distinctive cultural landscape of the region. The decorated barns were a popular attraction, as they were easily visible from public roadways. In the absence of any widely disseminated information on the subject, authors and entrepreneurs hurried to fill the void with travel journalism that was often fraught with rampant misconceptions, commercialism, and dubious interpretations of the culture. Many myths about decorated barns originated during this time, and have been perpetuated into the present day.\n\nThis includes the mythology of the “hex sign,” a term that was coined in the 1920s by journalists from outside the area who promoted Pennsylvania as a tourist destination. By virtue of national audiences eager for tourist publications, readers throughout the United States became rapidly aware of the “hex sign” myth, and locals remain divided on the issue.\n\nIn 1924, an antiquarian, retired Congregational minister, and author of romanticized travelogues, Rev. Wallace Nutting (1861-1941) of Framingham, Massachusetts, released the first detailed explanation of the origins of southeastern Pennsylvania’s decorated barns to national audiences.\n\nThis piece of travel journalism was included in Nutting’s The States Beautiful series in a book entitled Pennsylvania Beautiful. The Reverend’s brief account of the barns, nearly hidden amidst his photographs of bucolic landscapes and line drawings of colonial antiques, was singlehandedly responsible for inspiring the myth that the region’s barn star decorations were supernatural in origin.88 Nutting wrote:\n\n“They are a decoration sometimes applied on the door heads or on or about the door. They are supposed to be a continuance of a very ancient tradition, according to which these decorative marks were potent to protect the barn, or more particularly the cattle, from the influence of witches. It is understood by those who are acquainted with witches that those ladies are particularly likely to harm cattle. As the wealth of the farmer was in his stock, contained in his remarkably substantial barn, the hexafoos was added to its decoration as a kind of spiritual or demoniac lightning-rod!”89\n\nIt was not long after Ott’s retirement that Claypoole took his place at the Kutztown Folk Festival, where he became a national sensation. Johnny Claypoole’s work was later commissioned for installations at the Smithsonian Institute in 1969, the British Embassy, and the Philadelphia Zoo, and was featured in widespread publications such as the National Geographic and The New York Times.103 Johnny also collaborated with Jacob Zook of Lancaster, the famous promoter of commercial silkscreen hex signs, so that thousands of his designs were mass produced for tourist markets. Despite this success, as Claypoole matured as an artist, his public persona gained a level of introspection and depth that was largely absent in Ott’s clever and quick-witted public persona.\n\nJohnny Claypoole continued to tell tall-tales about the effects of his commercial hex signs on his customers. For instance, it was said that a couple, who were struggling to have children, bought a hex sign for “fertility” from Johnny Claypoole at the Kutztown Folk Festival, and five years later the couple returned to Claypoole’s booth accompanied by six children and returned the sign to him saying they no longer wanted it in the house!\n\nAlthough the telling of these stories was a highlight of Claypoole’s promotional efforts, he also spoke plainly about his work, saying that any belief in the magical efficacy of his art was a form of “mind over matter.” He would often explain candidly that if customers wanted to believe that his paintings had the ability to affect their lives, that perhaps his art would function in a positive way for those people— because they believe it to be so, but not because his work was magical in any intentional sense. Thus Claypoole was able to participate in the artistic dialog of his era without compromising what he knew to be true about the origins of the tradition.\n\nAlthough the work of Johnny Claypoole closely resembled his teacher Johnny Ott’s work in many respects, Claypoole took his painting to another level. Instead of limiting his art to the commercial hex signs on signboard and tinware, Claypoole began to paint on barns whenever he could. He not only painted his original designs on barns, but he also undertook the repainting of historic barn stars.\n\nDespite the fact that Johnny Ott was often depicted in the popular media as being connected with the painting of barns, he never actually painted a barn in his life. Numerous commercial disks painted by Johnny Ott were installed on local barns, but these have seldom survived to the present day. It is interesting to note that it was this development in the career of Johnny Claypoole that enabled the cross-pollination of the commercial hex sign motifs with the strictly geometric motifs found on barns. Thus the two branches of the art form, both commercial and traditional, were able to blend in the work of Claypoole. While Johnny Ott’s work combined these two genres as early as the 1950s, artwork resulting from this synthesis never appeared directly painted on barn siding until Johnny Claypoole began painting barns.\n\nAccording to local legend, it is Claypoole who was credited with coining and popularizing the term “ghost” as a descriptor for historic barn stars that weathered into the wooden siding over time. A “ghost” as he described it, was this ephemeral relief that allowed for the old geometric designs to be distinctly visible, even when painted over. Certain forms of raking light, common in the early morning and late afternoon, would cause these star patterns to emerge visibly from the siding, and disappear from sight when the sun’s angle changed—giving rise to the idea of a “ghost.”\n\nSuch a weathering process takes place when barn stars are exposed to the elements, and the interaction between the rays of the sun and the surface of the wood produces a pronounced relief over the course of decades. Although many people have assumed that “ghosts” are intentionally carved, they are not. Instead, the relief is produced unintentionally by a natural process called differential solar weathering. Johnny Claypoole often repainted historic barns using the ghosts as a template for his restorations. This allowed him to maintain the local aesthetics of the landscape, while exploring up-close the geometric layouts of previous generations of painters, whose works were emblazoned on the wood.\n\nPerhaps Johnny Claypoole’s most visible evidence of success is that he never had to advertise for a pupil, as his teacher did, in order to find a suitable apprentice. All of Claypoole’s children grew up around the art, with many opportunities to work with their father and experiment with the trade. His son Eric had naturally gravitated to the work, and as a professional carpenter, he was perfectly suited to follow in the footsteps of his father. Eric had begun as all of his siblings did, helping his father as a boy, when he would cut and prime his father’s disks, as well as sand and prep his father’s milk cans. It was not long before his technical skill with wielding a brush also began to show.\n\nEric persevered in the artistic path, and soon became his father’s partner in the business by helping with the painting of barns, and learning everything there was to know about the traditional forms and patterns. As Johnny grew older Eric’s role increased, and after Johnny, at the age of 74, painted his last barn with Eric in 1995, Eric soon assumed full responsibility for the painting of the barns. Johnny continued to paint commercial disks until the time of his passing in 2004.\n\nToday Eric Claypoole has continued his father’s legacy, and has become the most prolific painter in the Dutch Country. He has painted stars on more than seventy-five barns in Berks, Lehigh, Schuylkill, Northampton, Montgomery, Bucks, and Dauphin counties, and the numbers are steadily increasing. Eric typically completes six barns per year, a rate which will allow him to reach the milestone of more than one hundred barns within less than a decade.\n\nAs a restoration carpenter and artist in wood by trade, Eric appreciates historic buildings and is restoration minded about his approach to painting barns. He supplements his primary daytime occupation with painting as side-work. Despite this secondary designation, painting is Eric’s passion. Methodical, process-oriented, and exacting, Eric is fascinated by geometry, and continually pushes the limitations of the tradition, by recombining celestial patterns in new and unique ways.\n\nEric Claypoole paints commercial hex sign disks on signboard in addition to barns, and demonstrates annually at the Kutztown Folk Festival. While the Festival is his largest annual exhibition, it is also an opportunity for Eric to raise awareness for a preservation effort called the Hex Tour Association, which operates in partnership with the Festival to generate thousands of dollars to assist with subsidizing the repainting of historic barns in the area immediately surrounding Kutztown—the epicenter of the largest concentration of decorated barns anywhere in the United States. Annually, about three or four barns are selected to receive a grant for half of the total cost of restoration of the historic barn stars. Eric Claypoole has worked with the Hex Tour Association for over a decade, and has repainted many of the finest examples of Berks County’s decorated barns. In this way, the Association is assisting Eric in his life’s work of bringing the ghosts of Pennsylvania’s barn stars back to lif—at a much faster rate than would otherwise be possible.\n\nEric’s process for painting each barn is systematic. Whether repainting an historic ghost, or starting from scratch on new barn siding, Eric begins by prepping the surface to remove any damaged paint or debris from the wood. Next he applies three coats of the highest quality white acrylic paint in order to create a solid foundation for the star pattern. If a ghost is present, this white background helps to unify the surface and bring out the weathered image of the geometry, serving as the basis for the next step in the process. Eric then uses a trammel compass, a straight edge, and a triangle pattern of 30° - 60° - 90° to create a basic layout in pencil for the star pattern. Each color layer is then applied individually starting with the lightest colors. A final touch-up helps to resolve any paint drips or inconsistencies in the weathered wood. A completed design lasts up to 25 years.\n\nWhile Eric is indeed a master painter, his sense of propriety does not interfere with his creative and intellectual generosity in sharing his techniques with others. Having come from a family of five brothers and two sisters who all grew up around their father’s artistic process, Eric is used to sharing and collaborating, encouraging his family and friends to try their hand at folk art painting. Eric has taught his techniques to his two daughters, his son, his nephew, dozens of his friends, and in recent years has collaborated with Andrew Shirk and Patrick J. Donmoyer in painting barns and demonstrating at the Kutztown Folk Festival. He takes great pleasure in his work, and offers lectures, workshops, and open studio visitations to educate the public and increase public awareness of the tradition.\n\nOne important element that characterizes Eric’s work is his love of learning and discovery. He is motivated to examine and understand the geometric layout of historic designs as a way to connect with the artistic and mental process of artists who came before him. To Eric, the angles and proportions of the historic designs are not random, but part of a subtle geometric language that affects the perception of movement and rhythm within the radial pattern. Eric perceives sequences and regionalisms in the historic designs that would be imperceptible to the casual viewer, and attempts whenever possible to compare the patterns that are spread throughout the Dutch Country.\n\nEric is interested in exploring all the possibilities of potential meanings in the designs, and remains open-minded about the history and cultural implications of the traditional patterns. For instance, he keeps in mind the meanings passed to his father from Johnny Ott, such as sun, rain, love, fertility, success, and good luck, as well as the religious implications favored by his Roman Catholic father, who thought of the red central point of each design as symbolic of the blood of Christ, the twelve points of a star as representing the apostles, and three lilies representing the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity. At the same time, he is fascinated by archeological evidence of such motifs in the ancient world, as well as the sacred geometry found in all the cultures of the world.\n\nThe Claypoole legacy has been a tremendous force for the present day preservation and revival of the barn star tradition. Scores of barns in southeastern Pennsylvania have been touched by the brushes and the hearts of the Claypooles, and the numbers are increasing each year. Eric’s energy and innovation will undoubtedly continue to transform the landscape for decades to come, inspiring younger generations of painters to advance the artistry and agricultural heritage of the Pennsylvania Dutch.\n\nIt is perhaps with this in mind that Eric offers a most compelling explanation of the rotational qualities of his stars. Eric maintains that the central radiating pinwheel of his classic star patterns, rendered in alternating colors, symbolizes the ages of humanity spinning through time.104 This metaphor expresses a sense of continuity in the human experience over the millennia, represented in the stars and their celestial courses through the heavens.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Among the first of these photographers to document the decorated barns of Southeastern and Central Pennsylvania was William E. Ferrell (1870-1949) of Bethlehem, President of the Easton Car and Construction Company, whose travels brought him into contact with over 700 decorated barns in the 1920s through the 40s, as indicated in a presentation given to the Pennsylvania German Folklore Society Annual Meeting, at the Bucks County Historical Society, in May of 1940. Other notable documentarians were Herman E. Wright, who photographed barns, but was better known for his display of miniature paintings of designs found on barns throughout the region, featured at the Kutztown Folk Festival in the 1950s; and Guy F.
