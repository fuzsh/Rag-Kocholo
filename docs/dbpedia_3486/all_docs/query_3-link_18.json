        "text": "History of American Freedom Distillery\n\nFounding and Inspiration\n\nAmerican Freedom Distillery, the creator of Horse Soldier Bourbon, was founded in 2015 by a team of former Green Berets. Their journey began with a distillery tour in Yellowstone, sparking a passion for distilling.\n\nThis led them to train with some of the best distillers in Kentucky, Ireland, and Scotland, bringing those lessons back to perfect their craft.\n\nThe Bourbon\n\nHorse Soldier Bourbon Whiskey, the distillery’s flagship product, is handmade with all-natural ingredients and bottled in America’s heartland.\n\nThe bourbon has garnered significant recognition, winning triple double gold in the 2022 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. It’s known for its distinct flavors, crafted from grain to glass with a commitment to excellence.\n\nThe Horse Soldier Story\n\nThe brand’s story is deeply connected to a pivotal moment in American history. Following the events of 9/11, elite Green Beret teams, known as the “Horse Soldiers,” were deployed to Afghanistan, some on horseback.\n\nTheir heroics were later depicted in the film “12 Strong” and the CNN documentary “Legion of Brothers.” This story is a fundamental part of the distillery’s identity.\n\nFuture Expansion\n\nThe distillery’s future includes the establishment of Horse Soldier Farms in Somerset-Pulaski County, Kentucky.\n\nMany team members hail from Kentucky, and the new location will feature a world-class distillery and tourist experience, celebrating the legacy and spirit of the Horse Soldiers.\n\nBourbon Varieties\n\nHorse Soldier Bourbon offers a range of bourbons, including Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Small Batch Bourbon Whiskey, and Barrel Strength Bourbon Whiskey, each with unique tasting notes like caramel, vanilla, toasted corn, honey, nutmeg, custard, spiced oak, creamy toffee, dark stone fruits, ginger, cola, oak, butterscotch, and floral notes.\n\nAwards Won by American Freedom Distillery\n\nTriple Double Gold at 2022 San Francisco World Spirits Competition: In this renowned competition, Horse Soldier Bourbon stood out by winning the Double Gold medal three times. A Double Gold signifies unanimous agreement among the judges on the gold quality of the product​ ​.\n\nAwards at 2021 USA Spirits Ratings: This event evaluates spirits based on quality, value, and packaging. Horse Soldier Bourbon received multiple accolades here:\n\nHorse Soldier Signature: Awarded a Silver Medal with a score of 88 points.\n\nHorse Soldier Reserve: Also earned a Silver Medal, scoring 84 points.\n\nHorse Soldier Premium: Gained a Silver Medal with 83 points​ ​.\n\nAmerican Freedom Distillery Tour Information and Experience\n\nLocation and Accessibility:\n\nThe distillery is located in St. Petersburg, Florida, near the beach and in the Warehouse Arts District.\n\nIt offers wheelchair-friendly inside walkways for accessibility.\n\nDistillery Features:\n\nVisitors can tour the distillery and try crafted spirits.\n\nIt features a full bar and a happy hour.\n\nLive music entertainment is available.\n\nEducational Experience:\n\nThe tour provides an insight into the distillery’s journey and the art of whiskey and rum tastings.\n\nVisitors learn about the global quest of the founders for distilling knowledge and their training with world-renowned distillers in Scotland and Ireland.\n\nDiscounts Offered:\n\nGroup discounts are available.\n\nMilitary discounts are provided as a gesture of appreciation for veterans.\n\nSignature Product – Horse Soldier Bourbon:\n\nThe distillery is known for its award-winning Horse Soldier Bourbon.\n\nIt has won multiple awards, including three double gold medals at the 2022 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.\n\nFlask & Barrel Review of American Freedom Distillery\n\nAs a seasoned whiskey collector who’s seen my fair share of distilleries, I’d give the American Freedom Distillery a solid 4.7 out of 5.
