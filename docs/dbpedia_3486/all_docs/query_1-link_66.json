        "text": "South by Southwest started with a rally Friday as dozens gathered outside the Convention Center to protest the festivalâs U.S. Army sponsorship and hosting of defense companies like Collins Aerospace in the midst of the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nCollins Aerospace is a subsidiary of RTX Corporation (formerly Raytheon), the latter of which has supplied weapons to the Israeli government. On the day of the protest, the festival presented the panel Driving Innovation: Technical Advances in Transportation, featuring Army veteran and former Raytheon employee JD Johnson. The festival did not respond to request for comment from the Chronicle. (Editorâs note: SXSW co-founder and part-owner Nick Barbaro also co-founded and owns The Austin Chronicle.)\n\nRepeating chants of âCeasefire now,â âNo business as usual,â and âFree Palestine,â event organizers the Party for Socialism and Liberation demanded that SXSW disinvite Department of Defense affiliates from the festival. Musicians Connor McCampbell of TC Superstar and Jon Siebels of Eve 6 also spoke, encouraging their fellow artists to join the wave of acts pulling out of official SXSW showcases in protest of the festivalâs military presence.\n\nâTheyâre not getting paid shit anyway, so they might as well [drop out],â Siebels said, referencing past efforts to increase SXSWâs artist pay.\n\nCollins Aerospace will co-host the Boundary Breakers: The Next Leap in Government and Defense Innovation event on March 10 alongside entrepreneur network MassChallenge and defense software company Second Front Systems. Defense contractors L3Harris present another panel featuring Department of Defense employee Travis Langster â while Sara Lazarus, a former member of Raytheon's Cyber Exploitation Unit, appears as an official mentor.\n\nThe U.S. Army is a super sponsor of SXSW 2024 and hosts several events at the festival, including a presentation on technology innovation featuring Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth and an official âThis Is Our Houseâ activation in collaboration with the U.S. Navy and SPIN magazine. Other SXSW super sponsors include Volkswagen, Porsche, Delta, C4 Energy, and The Austin Chronicle."
