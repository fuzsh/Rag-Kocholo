        "text": "Sergeant First Class Will Summers (USA, Ret.) is a former “12 Strong” Special Forces. A true American hero, today he promotes Horse Soldier Bourbon. Upon retiring in 2013 after 25 years of service in the U.S. Army, he and other veterans are dedicated to advancing Horse Soldier’s reputation as a superb bourbon and caring company.\n\nhttps://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/southernamericana/Horse_Soliders.mp3\n\nA Horse Soldier Is Born\n\nAmerica produces true heroes in many ways. Often our greatest heroes wear that distinction without seeking fame and glory. Will Summers grew up in Louisana and Texas, enlisting in the Army as a teenager in the late 1980s. Will completed Army Special Forces training through his decorated career, eventually landing with the Operational Detachment-Alpha (ODA) 595 Green Beret unit as a communications specialist.\n\nI sat down with Will and Horse Soldier bourbon sales manager Merrick Mirabella at SoWal House in Rosemary Beach, FL, on a mid-September morning to talk and taste their three award-winning bourbons. I’m fortunate that I own and get to taste some outstanding bourbons, so trust me when I say Horse Soldier’s product line is exceptional. However, Will’s journey over the last 20 years is equally impressive.\n\nRELATED: Know the Difference Between Bourbon and Whiskey\n\nMost of us can recall our exact location when we learned of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center high rise in mid-town Manhattan. Could a trained airline pilot mistakenly fly a plane into a New York City skyscraper? I would bet Vandy will win the SEC before I take that wager. When a second plane hit the other tower, everyone realized nothing accidental occurred.\n\nStationed at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, Will’s unit participated in a training exercise along the Cumberland River near Nashville, TN, on the morning of September 11, 2001. Until fellow soldiers arrived to pick up the team, they had no idea that Taliban operatives initiated multiple attacks on U.S. soil.\n\nThe twin World Trade Center buildings in the heart of New York City crumbled. Terrorists struck the Pentagon, and another plane heading for Washington, D.C. crashed in a Pennsylvania field because brave civilians struggled with their hijackers. These actions proved hero’s come from all walks of life.\n\nAmerica was now at war. One of the few units prepared to undertake a special mission so quickly was ODA 595. Will Summers, along with his fellow Special Forces unit, would soon stand on foreign soil.\n\n12 Strong\n\nAlong with 11 others in his Special Forces unit, the Green Beret landed in the Afghanistan mountains on October 19. Their mission was to fight alongside an Afghan tribe and disrupt the Taliban’s advance, eventually taking the city of Mazar-i-Sharif.\n\nSenior commanders informed the leader of the unit, Capt. Mark Nutsch, that the chances of some or all of the team might not return. The mission ventured into unfamiliar territory, both literally and figuratively. Undeterred, the unit completed their objective and advanced 100-miles in six weeks before mid-November snows made mountain passes impassable.\n\nSummers and 11 of his fellow Green Berets were featured in the movie “12 Strong,” as the first group of soldiers to fight the Taliban after 9/11. It’s easy to write a few paragraphs describing the mission. It’s impossible to capture the miserable conditions that ODA 595 endured. Will lost about 35 pounds, wore the same uniform, and didn’t shower for weeks.\n\nOh, and he had to learn to develop the skills of a 19th-century cavalry soldier. Besides their leader, Captain Mark Nutsch, none of the 11 others had experience with horses. Overnight, they became veteran horsemen not so much by choice but through necessity and the will to survive.\n\n“Before this mission, the only horse I have ever ridden had its nose in another horse’s tail,” Will gingerly explained. “The horses we rode in Afghanistan were poorly trained stallions (male horses) that spent more time bucking and biting at one another than focusing on giving us a smooth ride. It was a harrowing experience when navigating narrow mountain trails.”\n\nThat’s how the men of ODA-595 became known as the “Horse Soldiers.”\n\nRELATED: How to Score Premium Allocated Bourbons\n\nIn late August of this year, I learned that one of the original Horse Soldiers was visiting Shunk Gulley Liquor and Wine and Cork & Barrel, two upscale wine and liquor retailers along Florida’s scenic highway 30a, for a bottle signing event. I immediately started working to secure an interview.\n\nThe opportunity to talk with a true American war hero, who, by the way, sells an incredible bourbon, was too great to pass up. Tyler Parker, Shunk Gulley’s retail beverage manager, worked hard to secure the interview. The next step was finding a suitable location.\n\nI met Dave King, the creative force behind SOWAL House in Rosemary Beach, FL, a few days later. Dave’s phenomenal vision to design an innovative, creative space along 30a is a stroke of genius. Beautifully decorated and equipped with the latest audio and video technology, Dave and his team are creating 30a’s most unique space for special events, creative sessions, filming, music production, and more still in development. I would be remiss if I didn’t give a shout-out to SOWAL House creative talents Jon Page, Gavin Young, and Ashley Grimes.\n\nTalking & Tasting Horse Soldier Bourbon\n\nWhen Will left the Army in 2013, he focused on other ventures and raising his growing family of 11 children and one grandchild. After performing military contract work, Will occasionally promoted Horse Soldier’s product line until he came on board full-time in 2020. It’s an excellent move for Will and the Horse Soldier team, which, by the way, is full of veterans and first responders, such as Merrick, who joined the Horse Soldier team in 2018.\n\nI asked how they applied their prior experience in public and military service to the “dog-eat-dog-world” of making and selling bourbon.\n\n“I believe what makes us so successful based on our military experience is taking care of people,” explained Will. “You’ve got to build rapport; be genuine, be honest and be caring. When you take care of people, everybody wins, whether on the battlefield or in business. We have a great product – we didn’t want to sell a story or a bottle. We wanted to sell a great bottle with a great story behind it. All American, authentic, and award-winning are the pillars behind the Horse Soldier vision.”\n\nGoing Through the Fire\n\nAnother critical point Will mentioned is the ability to trust those close to you. So, what is the Horse Soldier success recipe?\n\n“First, you go through the fire together. If someone doesn’t come through the fire, you get rid of them. I know that sounds harsh, but if someone can’t make it through the tough part, you don’t want them on your team. The same holds true in business. We’ve faced many challenges at Horse Soldier. As former first responders and military guys, we know the only way we’re going to succeed is together, giving all of our talents to the good of others and not ourselves.”\n\n“We make what we like to drink, what we don’t drink, we sell,” added Merrick.\n\nInterestingly, Horse Soldier’s early research indicated 70 percent of the market were women buying and drinking brown spirits. The group’s mentor’s told them that three components are necessary for success in the spirit industry. First, you have to have a great history and story. Horse Soldier can check that one off the list.\n\nSecond, you need a great product. That’s another box to check off the list. The third is a compelling label.\n\nEvery bottle of Horse Soldier Bourbon is molded from a portion of a steel beam from one of the World Trade Center towers. Merrick refers to the product line’s design as “Bar Jewelry.” Interestingly, Elizabeth Pritchard, one of its co-founders, created the label design.\n\nTasting What You Talk About\n\nHorse Soldier’s Straight Bourbon is around 87 Proof with smooth aromas of apple and toffee. Where the bourbon arrives on the palate, you’ll sense a touch of oak. There’s also lots of honey, vanilla, and spicy oak. The mash bill, also known as the recipe, is 65% corn, 30% Rye, and 5% Malted Barley.\n\nThe distillery’s signature blend is the Horse Soldier Small Batch Bourbon. I recommend bourbon lovers, especially those new to more refined offerings, start with this product. At 95 proof, the Small Batch blend doesn’t overpower the palate. A deep amber color delivers stone fruits, ginger, vanilla, and some oak.\n\nHorse Soldier Barrel Strength Bourbon comes in around 120 proof, and every bottle is individually marked since there’s a slight variation depending on the barrel. A deep amber color produces a “hot” bourbon with butterscotch overtures. Honestly, I love the punch this bourbon brings forth.\n\nCommander’s Select is Horse Soldier’s top barrel. They use these proceeds through a 501(c)(3) to maintain America’s Response Monument at Ground Zero, unofficially known as the Horse Soldier Statue. Individuals can also apply for financial aid through the Commander’s Select website.\n\nI can honestly say interviewing Will and Merrick turned out to be a true blessing. When I texted Will a couple of days before finishing this article, his humility came forward when he thanked me for making him look like a hero to his kids. Thank you, Will. However, you’re already a hero, and I’m sure your kids already realize your hero status."
