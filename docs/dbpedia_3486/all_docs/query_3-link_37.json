        "text": "In the days after the events of September 11, 2001, a group of special operations officers answered their nationâs call to defend it. These officers soon found themselves riding horseback in a Green Beret insertion in Northern Afghanistan to fight the Taliban. These men are honored at the Americaâs Response Monument at Ground Zero and have been given the nickname Horse Soldiers.\n\nThese same men banded together to create American Freedom Distillery. Their 16,000 square-foot distillery is located in Downtown St. Petersburg, Florida, where they distill their Rekker Rum. Their whiskey is made in Ohio in conjunction with Middle West Spirits. A portion of the proceeds of every bottle sold by American Freedom goes towards maintaining the Americaâs Response Monument.\n\nA soft and sweet aroma makes up the heft of the nose, with touches of caramel, spice, and grain in tow. Itâs followed by a gentle tasting palate thatâs sweet and approachable, thanks to honey, vanilla, and lemon zest. It finishes with an impactful pop of oak and spice.\n\nHorse Soldier Bourbon Whiskey an easy sipper that non-bourbon drinkers will find very approachable. What the sip may lack in depth, it makes up in its easy drinkability.\n\nâThe sample used for this review was provided at no cost courtesy of American Freedom Distillery. We thank them for the sample and for allowing us to review it with no strings attached."
