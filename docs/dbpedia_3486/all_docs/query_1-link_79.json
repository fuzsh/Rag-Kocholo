        "text": "Trevante Rhodes has found his first role since breaking out with his starring turn in indie sensation Moonlight.\n\nThe actor is in negotiations to join Chris Hemsworth, Michael Pena and Michael Shannon in Horse Soldiers, Jerry Bruckheimer Films/Black Label Media’s true account of a U.S. cavalry charge that took place in Afghanistan against the Taliban.\n\nBased on the book by Doug Stanton, the events took place weeks after 9/11, when a team of U.S. Special Forces went to Afghanistan and were to take over the city of Mazar E Sharif. But their modern equipment proved to be worthless in the rugged, harsh Afghan terrain, so with local help, the soldiers retrained to fight using only horses and their personal gear and weapons.\n\nPeter Craig and Ted Tally wrote the script and Nicolai Fuglsig is directing.\n\nJerry Bruckheimer and his Jerry Bruckheimer Films banner will produce along with Black Label Media’s Molly Smith, Trent Luckinbill and Thad Luckinbill. Bruckheimer Films’ Chad Oman will executive produce. Black Label Media, the company behind the much buzzed-about Ryan Gosling-Emma Stone musical La La Land, also will finance.\n\nIn A24’s Moonlight, Rhodes plays a young gay man who comes of age in drug-addled Miami. The actor, who plays the oldest version of the main character, received critical acclaim for his work in the Barry Jenkins-helmed movie, which is doing strong business at the box office.\n\nHe also stars on the Tyler Perry show If Loving You Is Wrong, which airs on OWN. Rhodes, who also appeared on HBO’s Westworld and will be seen Terrence Malick’s upcoming film Weightless, is repped by CAA, GSA Entertainment and Jackoway Tyerman."
