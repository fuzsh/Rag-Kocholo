        "text": "Guy Davis\n\nThe Legend Of Sugarbelly\n\nM.C Records\n\nHonest, Authentic and Vividly Detailed Acoustic Blues\n\nBlues stalwart, Guy Davis celebrates his five album tenure on M.C Records with the release of The Legend Of Sugarbelly, a free-flowing, effortless affair containing ten originals, plus three covers he’s arranged from Sam Chatman, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Leadbelly, most of which have been part of his live sets over the last few years.\n\nThe Legend Of Sugarbelly follows his 2021 Grammy-nominated album, Be Ready When I Call You.\n\nDavis is one of those artists that’s pretty much done it all; he’s recorded a bunch of albums (there’s no less than nine albums released on Red House Records alone), featured on a string of compilation projects, written plays, performed on Broadway, Off-Broadway and had acting roles in movies.\n\nHis portrayal of Blues legend, Robert Johnson in Trick The Devil won him the Blues Foundation’s (1993) ‘Keeping The Blues Alive Award’.\n\n“My new record has a sound that rubs against your ears like soft Autumn kisses and goes down as smooth as the finest whiskey”, states Davis.\n\nDavis’ instrumental prowess on acoustic 6 and 12-string guitar, mandolin, harmonica and 5 and 6-string banjo is ably supported by Professor Louie (organ), (bass player) Mark Murphy and Chris James (mandolin, six-string banjo).\n\nSoaked in beautiful tones, the story-telling side of Davis is sampled in all it’s glory, opening with the banjo accompanied, Sugarbelly, where he tells the stellar story of a lady from Texas, that\n\n‘stood five feet from the ground’,\n\nand was chased by many men\n\n‘she was the prettiest girl I ever did see,\n\nand I want you to be ‘my’ Sugarbelly’ girl.\n\nPlease tell your other men to turn around and go back home”.\n\nTragedy struck when, she is killed by a jealousy lover.\n\nKokomo Alley is a jaunty, acoustic Blues piece, performed on a finger picked, acoustic guitar it glides along every bit as stylish, as Who’s Gonna Love You Tonight which enjoys ever present harmonica as he asks\n\n“who’s gonna love you tonight?\n\nBut that’s alright.\n\nI know you love another man,\n\nbut that’s alright,\n\nevery now and then I wonder who’s gonna love you tonight”.\n\nThe Gospel plied, Early In The Morning is a moving affair, warmed in gentle organ and harmonies he reflects on life, warm and tender it is steeped in hymnal properties. Loaded in fine lead vocals, and harmony vocals Davis brings grace, calm and serenity to the world on something Eric Bibb might have done.\n\nIn The Evening Time has something of a skip-a-long Mississippi John Hurt feel; even though it features more banjo than the guitar that accompanies him. Loose, jaunty and warm he speaks of how when the evening comes he goes,\n\n“I go a-walking just cool his mind,\n\njust to cool my mind,\n\nearly in the morning to hear the rooster crow,\n\nI drink my coffee and down the road I go”.\n\nIt’s time for reflection, to sit under a tree, musing on the road he’s on and the money he could have made.\n\nThe traditional piece Little David Play Your Harp enjoys some classy guitar, and with it he offers cheery lyrics as the time passes all too quickly.\n\nOn Firefly Davis plays the clawhammer banjo, and rattles along like an old Ford on a bumpy dirt road, the listener being caught up in a superbly crafted but simple melody, making it ‘vintage sounding’ unspoilt and pure\n\nLong Gone Riley Brown enjoys some sporty harmonica, and a quick fire familiar rhythm as Davis goes back in time for this delightful tune that bustles along as it echoes music of a bygone era. Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee among others readily come to mind.\n\nGreat entertainment.\n\nCome Glitch Some has a ragtime Blues slant to it, and with moonshine whiskey being the subject of the story a joyous, playful feel ensues, with guitar and banjo sharing the instrumental load.\n\nBlack Snake Moan has a solid, unbending rhythm as Davis performs an excellent cover of the 1927 Blind Lemon Jefferson recording of the guitar powered melody that’s reminiscent of a good few folk pop / pop songs over the years.\n\nThe jaunty Huddie Leadbetter song Laura is fuelled here by banjo, guitar and harmonica, and apart from cries of “Laura, Laura…” the players pretty much run the show, then skipping along happily through the old favourite Twelve Gates To The City and its powerful, relentless feelings as Davis turns his attention to Blues Gospel, that overflows in energy, banjo, bass, guitar and harmonica as he speaks of its virtues on this great song and version.\n\nDon’t Know Where I’m Bound is an A-typical acoustic Blues.., Davis singing,\n\n“If I had a sailing ship,\n\nI’d sail it all around”\n\n…“they never called my name.\n\nI got in line but when payday comes,\n\nthey never called my name”\n\nIt’s warm and soothing too throughout.\n\n“Got on the road,\n\ngot lost,\n\nbut don’t know where I’m bound”.\n\nAll this as he looks to have a woman cheat on her husband.\n\n“Give me one more time,\n\nsend for me when your husband is gone,”\n\nhe pleads.\n\nAll in all; like every previous Guy Davis album, there’s just nothing here to dislike, he’s honest and truly authentic in the way he arranges and performs old and new songs with grace and enthusiasm.\n\n*More good news ; Guy Davis is booked to tour the UK this autumn.\n\nReview by Our Man From Havana Mr Maurice Hope\n\nHome\n\nBUY DON’T SPOTIFY\n\nhttp://guydavis.com/wp/store/\n\nSonny Terry & Brownie McGhee\n\nLive From The Ash Grove\n\nLiberation Hall\n\nAn Excellent Taster From Two Early Exponents an Legends of the Folk Blues Scene\n\nWhen you talk about Blues and particularly Piedmont Blues legends, there’s no denying how easily the conversation will inevitably gravitate to blind harpist, Sonny Terry (born, in Greenboro, N.Carolina and, guitarist Brownie McGee (Knoxville, Tennessee).\n\nBetween them they have influenced countless budding exponents of the Folk Blues genre over the last sixty plus years, with the duo playing a huge part in the various Folk Blues revivals in that time.\n\nRecorded live in 1973 at the famed, Ash Grove (a number of fabulous recordings over the years have been made there over the years), in Hollywood the duo were well into their 35 year partnership when these eight (plus two from 1965) previously unreleased tracks were captured.\n\nStarting out in New York City, circa 1941; they rubbed shoulders with others of the Folk Blues crowd that would go onto become legends themselves, Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, Josh White, Paul Robeson, Cisco Houston and Woody Guthrie plus a bunch more.\n\nIt’s a little known fact that Sonny Terry was part of the original cast of the 1947 Broadway Musical, Finian’s Rainbow and the couple can be seen in the Steve Martin comedy, The Jerk, Steven Spielberg’s The Color Purple and, McGhee on his own in Alan Parker’s Angel Heart.\n\nIt’s no surprise Terry and McGhee are relaxed here, completely at ease and in charge on the stage of a venue they performed on at its opening in 1958.\n\nPiercing blasts on harmonica, chugging guitar tools coupled with genuine “working man’s” vocals and stories to match are a must here, for your listening pleasure; and they’re not only for followers of the genre, but for anyone with ‘catholic’ musical taste.\n\nMcGhee’s charismatic style offers huge appeal as he holds court on stage with great stories come from being survivors of WW2, constants of the 1960’s Folk and Blues ‘booms’ and of course the civil rights troubles, Cuban missile crisis and the loss of JFK, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr; plus their two-time Newport Folk Festival appearances helped cement their position.\n\nBiggies here include, Trouble In Mind, the humorous intro to Hootin’ The Blues.\n\n”I performed it every night for two and half years for Finian’s Rainbow”, says McGhee, and here it comes complete with a string of excitable hoots, alongside some sublime harp and guitar runs making it an instrumental of the highest order. That also goes for harp driven “Blowin’ The Fuses”; an incredible piece as Terry’s extraordinary work is warmly aided and abetted by McGhee’s sweet acoustic guitar (and hoots etc).\n\nMcGhee hands down some wisdom on My Father’s Words, and the rhythmic Blues Life’s A Gamble, Up Under The Hood\n\n“Only town in the world could afford this song is New York City; but I’m not in New York anymore, just a country boy from Oakland, California. I was walking down 42nd street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway.\n\nAll the New Yorkers call that the crossroad of the world…I looked back, and it was a lady cab driver.”\n\nThere’s more wonderful hilarious stuff elsewhere and he has the audience eating out of his hand.\n\nTheir stellar cover of Leadbelly’s Midnight Special cooks up a storm and bristling with energy Pack It Up And Go has Terry powering throughout and with McGhee at his shoulder it’s all muscle as they mop up and like so many songs it’s a truly commanding performance.\n\nOne of the bonus tracks, Baby, I Got My Mind Off You has a gritty, rustic edge to it as a foot pounding rhythm helps propel the number forward making it, like the album itself; an excellent taster of a legendary Blues duo.\n\nReview by ‘Our Man in Havana’ Maurice Hope\n\nReleased June 21st 2024\n\nhttp://www.liberationhall.com/index.php\n\nBUY DON’T SPOTIFY\n\nhttps://sonnyterryandbrowniemcgheelive.bandcamp.com/album/live-from-the-ash-grove\n\nReleased June 21st 2024\n\nVarious Artists\n\nThe Legacy Of Revered Gary Davis\n\nRiverlark Music\n\nAn Amazing Homage To One of the Blues’ Forefathers\n\nWhat we have here is a wonderful bunch of Blues and Gospel songs from Gary Davis’ students, grand-students and more; from acolytes that are black, white, American and Canadian, containing some old tunes, and some previously unreleased.\n\nBy all accounts, Rev. Gary Davis (1896-1972) was a remarkable musician, and among other things a teacher of music.\n\nBlind from infancy, Davis played piano rags and orchestral pieces on guitar, and ‘shouted’ gospel numbers on the street for forty years, plus he taught more than a thousand people one-to-one, over seventy years!\n\nEven if this style of Blues is not normally on your plate, its something you should consider because there’s much to savour.\n\nMany of those he taught went on to enjoy professional careers in music notes curator Adam Cohen, whose father, John Cohen (New Lost City Ramblers, producer, historian) actually made an album with Davis in 1953.\n\nDavis’ music came in via three fronts; Blues, Gospel and versatile guitar work; and on occasions all three get to combine!\n\nAs for crucial material compiled for this collection, it all starts with South Carolina Rag from Rolly Brown (vocals, stylish finger-picked guitar), Willie Walker penned the blues record that contains the hook,\n\n‘I’ll tell you, that’s no way to do’.\n\nBrown’s smokey tones set the tone for what is to follow.\n\nIronically, Davis had just been ordained when in 1935 a record label, ARC gave him the opportunity to record twelve gospel songs. In return he had to record one 78rpm single that was Blues.\n\nSouth Carolina-born Davis not only created a unique style as a guitar picker, but wrote a stellar set of durable songs too. None more so than Twelve Gates To The City; performed by John Cephus and Phil Wiggins – a bread and butter Blues-Gospel piece, and a signature song of Davis, which here is warmed in guitar and harmonica as the duo carve a deep niche.\n\nDavis made a tidy sum through royalties accumulated from folk act Peter, Paul and Mary recording his song, If I Had My Way (listed here as Samson & Delilah #1) in their trademarked folk fashion. Samson & Delilah #11 by Mitch Greenhill & Mayne Smith follows that version in the running order, Mitch Greenhill being the son of Davis’ manager, Manny Greenhill is on acoustic guitar, lead vocals and Mayne Smith acoustic guitar and backing vocals, featuring some dazzling picking as they return the song to Davis’ original style.\n\nKen Whitely and friends deliver a warm version of Davis’ gospel favourite Let Us All Get Together, which has a wonderful, free ’n easy feel run through its entirety. With jug band arrangements it flows ever so sweetly.\n\nDavis’ I Am The Light Of This World is performed, stellar fashion by gritty voiced, Maria Muldaur (supported by Ernie Hawkins on acoustic guitar), and like her former husband, Geoff Muldaur she enjoys a terrific understanding of the Blues, and here you couldn’t wish for a finer recording.\n\nAri Eisinger on vocals and acoustic guitar rumbles along like a train on, I’m Throwin’ Up My Hand, a relentless, typical Blues story about losing his woman.\n\nIt’s a winner.\n\nIt and Cross And Evil Woman Blues (performed by the versatile and gifted, Jack Dialesandro) were the blues songs that constituted the 78rpm record that came from Davis’ original record deal.\n\nNorth-East Ohio’s Eric Noden picks a mighty guitar on delivering the robust, Pure Religion.\n\nI Heard The Angels Singing from Bill Ellis (vocals, guitar) brings the music forward in line with later day Folk -Blues.\n\nErnie Hawkins comes through with an intriguing, guitar instrumental Will There Be Stars In My Crown (Eliza E. Hewitt) to illustrate the wealth of songs Davis played, but never actually recorded.\n\nThere’s another Instrumental Devil’s Dream where Pat Conte show off his banjo skills.\n\nUnited States March from Ellen Britten (guitar) rolls along ever so sweetly, with playful guitar licks decorating the tune in a crisp, vibrant fashion.\n\nNational finger-picking champion, Mary Flower learned Sit Down On The Banks / Buck Dance when she was living in Denver, Colorado in the 1960s. Her easy as an old fitting shoe vocals and dexterity on guitar are a delight.\n\nLittle known musician Ian Buchanin with the Otis Brothers (Pat Conte & Bob Guida) provide a mighty version of popular composition, Hesitation Blues.\n\nPerry Lederman just about clinches the mantle as supreme player, with his contribution, Gary Davis Style which is an amazing showcase for his guitar skills. He Knows How Much We Can Bear (Roberta Martin) may not be a Gary Davis original, but one he found, learned, played and has been picked up by many others. One such act appears here, Penny Lang (w/ friends), who learnt it on hearing Davis perform in at Montreal’s Yellow Door where he stopped the traffic.\n\nAmong those Davis associated with on the New York folk scene was Dave Van Ronk, another musical legend. His version of Davis’ Soon My Work Will All Be Done isn’t only a highlight of this album, but the his own long and industrious career. Supported by Eric Frandsen on acoustic guitar plus friends on harmony vocals it is quite exquisite.\n\nColumnist for Fingerstyle Guitar magazine, music teacher and more (backup singer to a then young singer, Joni Mitchell and guitarist with Olivia Newton John) Rick Ruskin rounds off the collection with soulful rendition of a heartfelt piece, I Will Do My Last Singing In This Land.\n\nThe copious notes that come with the collection; like the music are, both a joy, and hugely informative.\n\nReview by Maurice Hope\n\nReleased April 20th April 2024\n\nhttp://www.riverlark.com/blues/revivalists.html\n\nBUY DON’T SPOTIFY\n\nEric Bibb\n\nLive At The Scala Theatre, Stockholm\n\nRepute / Stony Pain Records\n\nA Masterclass in Acoustic Blues and Storytelling.\n\nThree time Grammy Nominee Blues man Eric Bibb opens with old favourite Goin’ Down The Road Feelin’ Bad (trad) and never looks back.\n\nRecorded in 2022 in Stockholm (his longtime adopted home) it finds New York raised, Eric Bibb at the peak of his powers and was, without doubt, the most ambitious gig and recording project of his career.\n\nOver the last 40 – 50 years Bibb has established a world wide following through his unique blend of Blues, Folk and Gospel music. During this period he’s recorded a good many records, going back to his debut on Swedish label, Opus 3 in 1977. Beforehand Bibb had made sporadic recordings, but his career had been a stop start affair.\n\nMy first recollection of seeing him play was at the Ropery, Sunderland and Newcastle’s famed Jumpin’ Hot Club.\n\nI was instantly hooked on his amazing ability to build a rhythm, with a pure sound from his guitar and equally warm vocals, and back then he had Goran Wennerbrandt alongside him, providing some amazing, sensitivity to his songs.\n\nHere, the enduring folk song, 500 Miles (trad) enjoys a remake as Bibb places his own stamp on the much covered song. The accompaniment on occasions features an all-star lineup of musicians including Eric’s longtime collaborator, Glen Scott on bass, keys, drums and backing vocals; Olle Linder on drums and acoustic bass; Johan Lindström on pedal steel and electric guitar; Christer Lyssarides on electric guitar and mandola; Esbjörn Hazelius on fiddle and cittern; Greger Andersson on harp; Lamine Cissokho on kora and vocals; special guest vocalists Sarah Dawn Finer, Rennie Mirro and Ulrika Bibb, as well as string arrangements performed by Hanna Helgegren and Sarah Cross on violins, Christopher Öhman on viola and Josef Ahlin on cello; yet it’s never over powering or over produced.\n\nBibb’s relaxed, warm persona is always at the forefront, and his gentle demeanour never gets better than when it’s a case of less is more.\n\nPiano, fiddle, harmonica, harmony vocals warm Mole In The Ground a song I first heard sung by Doc Watson. Bibb’s version is a beautiful cultured rendition, multi-textured and he even has the audience giving a little help..\n\n’you sound so good, one more time’, asks Bibb.\n\nWalter Vinson’s Things Is ‘Bout Comin’ My Way is your typical, lazy paced Blues shuffle, with some foreboding work on fiddle, plus some sharp as a tack moody harmonica too.\n\nRosewood and Whole World’s Got The Blues are co-writes with Glenvin Anthony Scott – the former a murderous affair that goes back to the family home as it speaks of an event back in time that saw people lose their lives.\n\nIn a bloody ballad he sings.\n\n‘the night they burned old Rosewood to the ground.\n\nBuried in the ashes of history.\n\nHad to put on heavy clothes,\n\nfast as we could.\n\nThere was shooting everywhere.\n\nHad to get out in the woods’.\n\nAdding,\n\n‘the numbers in the paper were nowhere near the truth,\n\ncould’a a been ten,\n\ncould’a been a hundred’\n\nhe sings in the horrific tale (from the 1920s in Florida).\n\nAs for the latter, Whole World’s Got The Blues it speaks of troubles from modern times. Restless and evocative, it chugs (alongside an electric guitar solo) along as Bibb rattles through some of today’s open sores.\n\nOne of, it not my favourite has to be the lilting Bring Me A Little Water, Sylvie (a Lead Belly song) that springs to life, with old-time fiddle, slide guitar, and a chugging killer rhythm accompany Bibb’s faultless tones. It’s an addictive sound. Timeless even, and when in the hands of Bibb something you just can’t get enough of.\n\nHis arrangement is nothing less than special, the sound made by the audience as they give their hearty approval thinking likewise.\n\nHis song, River Blues enjoys a gentle sway as Bibb sings of the soothing qualities of watching a river flow. Good company when one needs to get away from it all, let nature take its course.\n\nBibb’s talking blues Silver Spoon is aided by acoustic, electric, pedal steel guitar, creating a chunky rhythm and rippling guitar sings of playing the Blues, putting food on the table and having to pawn his guitar to make ends meet.\n\n‘Some people say I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth’\n\nsings Bibb as he recalls his struggle to gain acceptance, and respect, due to having to follow his father Leon Bibb who was a 1960s folk singer.\n\nBut, Eric on relocating to Europe stood up to show the world he could cut it on his own. What a moving piece of writing this song is.\n\nAlong The Way is another of his songs with a more calming feel.\n\nSophisticated and mellow he sings of\n\n‘talking your time, take your time to look at what you’ve learned along the way. Give yourself a pat on the back for making this far’. A wonderful reflective piece.\n\nThis is Eric Bibb’s 5th ‘live album’ and quite possibly his finest, as the musicians surrounding him support him like timbers in the eaves of a building; they are there and the songs wouldn’t be the same without them, but you barely notice them, such is the mastery that Eric Bibb and his acoustic guitar achieves on every track.\n\nReview courtesy Maurice Hope\n\nhttps://www.ericbibb.com/\n\nBUY DON’T SPOTIFY\n\nhttps://www.ericbibb.com/category/all-products\n\nhttps://stonyplain.labelstore.ca/releases/772532148726-live-at-the-scala-theatre-digital-mp3.html\n\nhttps://ericbibb.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-the-scala-theatre\n\nSue Foley\n\nOne Guitar Woman\n\nStony Plain Records\n\nA Gorgeous Gateway to the The Women That Were at The Forefront Of The Blues\n\nThe download of this album arrived late last week while I was busy editing photographs; but as I already own a couple of Sue Foley albums didn’t feel the need to check out the accompanying e-mail; but remember being a bit narked at it arriving so close to release day.\n\nAnyway, I was busy again yesterday and casually pressed ‘play’ and went back to work. It was about 5 songs in when I realised that these songs were the polar opposite of what I was expecting!\n\nI double checked; and in fairness to Ms Foley … there’s a clue on the album cover; she has put down her trademarked pink Telecaster and replaced it with a gorgeously tuned acoustic!\n\nSo, coffee in hand I had to start again and concentrate.\n\nWhen I first discovered Sue Foley via the Queen Bee compilation, alongside Bonie Raitt she was the only female I knew of that played the electric guitar… and what a way she played!!\n\nThis album finds Sue Foley paying homage to the Godmothers’ of Blues Music, with songs dating back as far as before WWI and from a fabulous cross section of Blues pioneers too.\n\nMy original problem was not recognising Sue’s unique voice on the opening track Oh Babe It Ain’t No Lie, the Elizabeth Cotten song (covered by both the Grateful Dead AND Gillian Welch!) … but now I’ve played it several times, it’s actually quite exquisite …. with Sue sounding a bit 1960’s Bob Dylanish in her phrasing and her guitar picking is seamlessly wonderful.\n\nThis is followed by the slower and darker, In My Girlish Ways (Memphis Minnie) one of four songs I have on a compilation album dating back to the turn of the century. It’s fair to say and true of a lot of songs here; Sue delves deep in her singing and playing, but also manages to make the song a lot easier on the ear than the original version not least her rendition of another Memphis Minnie song, Nothing in Rambling.\n\nWhat I like best here is that Sue’s versions of these songs, while obviously paying homage to her mentors, never sounds like a dry history lesson like others have done over the years; here she captures the frisson of excitement that Freight Train, Lonesome Homesick Blues and Motherless Child Blues must have generated ‘back in the day’, but make them easily accessible for a 21st Century audience who think they’ve ‘heard it all before.’\n\nI can’t find any reference to the stunning instrumentals Romance in A Minor or La Malaguena but they are both absolutely beautiful with hints of Howe Gelb’s Flamenco/Spanish album Alegrias from many years ago.\n\nIt’s not always a ‘given’ that an accomplished electric guitar player can transfer those skills to the acoustic; but Sue Foley manages that like a Mastercraftsman (Master Craftswoman does’t scan).\n\nThat’s what makes this very special, the combination of her guitar playing, and the way she fills the words and stories with a deep seated love that comes across in every groove.\n\nThere appears to be only one new song here; and Maybelle’s Guitar fits in like a delicate hand in a velvet glove and only narrowly misses out on being in the running for RMHQ Favourite Song.\n\nThat title is a coin toss between Sue’s heart crushing version of Sister Rosetta’s Tharpe’s My Journey To The Sky which simply breathtaking; and a song by someone I’ve never heard of, Geeshie Wiley and Last Kind Word Blues, a desperately emotional tale of a man going off to war and fearing he may not come back ….\n\n“If I get killed, if I get killed, please don’t bury my soul\n\nI prefer just leave me out, let the buzzards eat me whole\n\nWhen you see me comin’, look ‘cross the rich man’s field\n\nIf I don’t bring you flower, I’ll bring you bolted meal”\n\nWow!\n\nThere’s a lot of reasons to buy this album; but first and foremost it’s a gateway to the Blues, especially the women that were at the forefront but have sadly not been remembered as well as their male counterparts have done.\n\nReleased March 28th 2024\n\nhttps://suefoley.com/\n\nBUY DON’T SPOTIFY\n\nhttps://shop.suefoley.com/pages/albums-and-cds\n\nStruggle Buggy\n\nKeep It Clean\n\nSelf-Release\n\nSwaggering Cool, Old Timey Ragtime and Jug Band Blues …and more!\n\nI hope it’s not just me, but I’m pretty sure that we take a lot of excellent musicians for-granted, simply because they are ‘local’ and play somewhere close by most weeks; and sadly ‘for free.’\n\nI’m pretty sure that’s the case with the legendary Geordie purveyors of Good-Time Blues, 30’s and 40’s urban blues alongside a hefty dose of Hokum, Ragtime, and Jug Band Blues with a little Jazz, Western Swing and even Calypso thrown in for good luck!\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I give you Struggle Buggy!!\n\nIf you’re not already aux fait with the delights of Struggle Buggy, you are in for a rare treat starting with the lairy 4th Street Messaround, a song which I’m damned if I can describe; apart from saying it’s ‘a hoot and full of style and swagger!’\n\nOn track two Black Rat Swing we are treat to some stunning steel guitar and harmonica alongside some grizzly impassioned vocals as Lee Bates inhabits (as usual) the character in the song.\n\nI think I’ve stumbled on why Struggle Buggy are so good; they actually ‘believe in the music’ they are playing, whereas their contempories simply ‘sing songs.’\n\nThat’s the key to the likes of Flyin’ Airplane Blues, Keep Your Hair Parted and the brooding Come On Back which sound as if we’ve been transported back to a sleazy Honky-Tonk somewhere in the rough part of Chicago or Arkansas pre WWII.\n\nWith over 50 years to choose from, the only band that I can compare Struggle Buggy too would be the Lovin’ Spoonful; but only if John B Sebastian etc. had been born 20 years before they were!\n\nDon’t be fooled by the easy going and laid back sound here; it takes years of experience and a love of the music to make Custard Pie, Wonderful Time and Going Back To Arkansas sound so ‘simple’ when the construction and arrangements are nearly as complicated as anything Pink Floyd ever recorded IMHO.\n\nWhile the whole album is an absolute blast from start to finish, not least the charming Walking Cane; but there are two songs that I keep being drawn too, which means it’s a tie between the desperately emotional Panic Is On, first written and recorded by Hezekiah Jenkins in 1931 but is sadly a tale of our times here in 2024 too …\n\n“What this country is coming to,\n\nI sure would like to know,\n\nIf they don’t do something by and by,\n\nThe rich will live and the poor will die,\n\nDoggone, I mean the panic is on.Unemployment getting worser every day,\n\nNothing to eat and no place to sleep,\n\nAll night long, folks is walkin’ the street,\n\nDoggone, I mean the panic is on.‘\n\nT’other is the classic Crazy ‘Bout a Woman is obviously a lot more uptempo and as well as some fast and furious geetar pickin’ features some red hot harmonica wheezing and this is a first for RMHQ, Blues drenched Kazoo too!\n\nI’m sure that the cognoscenti (I’m thinking of you Gary Grainger) can tell you who first recorded every song here and who was walking past the studio, but for me and everyone who has ever witnessed a full blooded Struggle Buggy gig … these songs were all left to the band and are now theirs and theirs alone.\n\n*If Struggle Buggy lived in that there London you’d never stop hearing about them in the music press, and I’m pretty sure they’ have been invited to play the other stage or at least a marquee at Glastonbury, but they don’t; and are actually the worst kept secret in North East England, and it’s likely to stay that way too.\n\nRELEASED March 15th 2024\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/StruggleBuggyBlues/?locale=en_GB\n\nBUY DON’T SPOTIFY\n\nhttps://strugglebuggy1.bandcamp.com/album/keep-it-clean\n\nShipcote & Friends\n\nThe Aurora String Quartet\n\nBrick\n\nThe Cluny,\n\nNewcastle.\n\nFriday 1st March 2024\n\nShipcote aka Graham Anderson, musical troubadour and one half of the legendary Roots Promoters The Jumpin’ Hot Club, has had a varied and very interesting career spanning nearly 50 years; but tonight a ‘dream came true’, as he finally performed alongside a string quartet.\n\nHe’s primarily known for his laid back Country Swing music but scratch the surface you find a man brought up on Jazz, became a Soul Boy and performed in a number of bands that covered the whole Roots spectrum and then some, over the years.\n\nTonight’s ‘triple header’ started with Shipcote and Friends performing as a trio, with long term mates Bry and John playing double bass and acoustic guitar. It was a delightful warm up to the main event, with songs seemingly being plucked from the air on a whim (as usual), starting with the charming Why Worry then Texas Rose which I haven’t heard him play in years; and you’ve simply got to love a song that name checks the Carter Family, MC5 and The Partridge Family! In fairness I’ve only seen him play 4 or 5 times in the last year and he has an amazing back catalogue to draw from.\n\nNext up was his obligatory ‘lockdown song’, Open Your Eyes followed by his ‘only political song’, In This World Today, written 10 years ago; but every bit as apt and cutting today in 2024!\n\nThe short set ended with one of his finest songs; the jaunty toe-tapper, Crazy Country Fool.\n\nAfter a very short break, my other reason for being excited tonight, new duo Brick made their appearance; after playing their first two singles on the radio; the chance to see Bridie Jackson, ex-The Arbour and ‘her fella’ Nick Pierce play was something I simply couldn’t miss.\n\nI genuinely didn’t know what to expect and I’m pleased to report that Bridie in her sparkly bomber jacket and Nick looking very dapper, although more suited to a night at the opera, were wonderful.\n\nWhat they create is somewhere on the Lo-Fi/Avant Garde spectrum with a dash of Contemporary Folk in the lyrics; although they took the brave choice of starting their set with an as yet unnamed instrumental, featuring some beautiful violin playing from Mr Pierce and almost John Williamsesque guitar playing from Ms Jackson.\n\nThe first song of the evening was ‘about grief and grieving‘ according to Bridie; but because of certain things in my life at the moment; Some Days Are Better Than Other Days could easily be a theme tune for one of the mental health charities.\n\nIt’s one thing hearing someone sing on a record; and it’s been a good few years since I’ve seen Bridie play live; and I think it’s fair to say her voice has slightly mellowed but is even more delightful than ever; as proved during the enigmatic Winter Song (?) which saw Nick move onto the keyboards and provide warm harmonies to Bridie’s ghostly vocalising.\n\nPerhaps my Favourite Song of the night came next; a ‘love song’ called Slow Dancing On Quicksand which was heard in near silence, but as it ended the nearly full audience let out a round of applause that must have been heard in the packed Hall 1 50 yards away!\n\nTheir half hour closed out with another dark tale; You’ll Make It Home; which I took to be a metaphor for depression and if I’m being honest, I had a bit of dust in my eye half way through, that must of looked like I was crying …. but I wasn’t; honest.\n\nThere was a bit longer gap as the stage was re-set for the ensemble that had merited the ‘house full’ sign to be put on the door; which allowed long lost friends, many who had travelled down from Scotland and up from the Southlands of Yorkshire and Lancashire to catch up.\n\nThe man of the moment, Shipcote was now all ‘gussied up’ in a three piece suit, shirt and tie plus a dapper Panama hat.\n\nHis introduction explained the ‘dream of playing with a string quartet’ only coming to fruition because his Mother died and the sale of her house allowed him the opportunity to create the EP he was launching and the ‘one off performance’ with the Aurora String Quartet. I met his Mam a couple of times and I’m pretty sure this is what she would have wanted for him; as they say.\n\nThe EP songs were pretty much played in sequence, starting with one of my Favourites; Old Is Cool, which began pretty much as usual but after a minute or so the three violins and cello slid in like a warm breeze taking a very good song into unchartered territory … and the reception was so loud you’d have thought it was a Punk gig!\n\nThe ensemble were joined by Bridie Jackson for the second song, Anything For Me, which was dedicated to his Mam and it’s fair to say that the atmosphere in the small room was now ‘electrically charged’.\n\nClassical music has always passed me by; but I’ve always appreciated the quality on offer whenever I’ve seen bits n pieces on the TV, but being 12 or 13 feet away from this particular quartet was like hearing magic happen before my eyes, especially during Sweet Gal and the Geordie Gothic tale, Devil Song.\n\nAs a reviewer, I know what I like and can describe it reasonably articulately; but that’s where my imagination falters and I have the greatest admiration for people like Shippy; who can not just write a song out of nothing; but be able to take an old song like Measure of Life and rearrange it in such a complicated way as this, with a String Quartet proving an amazing interlude half way through, and then make it all sound as simple and natural as the musicians on stage made it sound, beggars belief.\n\nNo wonder the applause got even louder after each song.\n\nThere was an extra special treat, as the ensemble performed a song called That’s Enough, something I’ve only heard in a raw format a couple of years ago; and this full bodied performance was certainly with the entrance fee; then he surprised us the heartbreaking Amy; which was really befitting for the late *Amy Winehouse, whom it was about.\n\nThat song and the charming Swiftly Drift Away, which aren’t on the EP summed up what gig going has always been about; seeing and/or hearing no one else outside that room will ever witness and tonight was certainly ‘one of those nights.’\n\nBeing the guy he is; Shipcote let the Aurora String Quartet close the evening themselves; and I can’t think of a better ending than hearing them perform Etta James’ At Last.\n\nWhat a night; and one that will never be repeated, which is a sad state of affairs; but I can say ‘I was there.’\n\n*Who knew The Jumpin’ Hot Club once booked Amy Winehouse for the first Evolution Festival?\n\nPhoto-set https://www.harrisonaphotos.co.uk/Music/Shipcote-and-the-Aurora-Strings\n\nhttp://www.shipcote.com/\n\nhttps://www.bridiejackson.com/\n\nhttps://www.aurorastrings.org.uk/\n\nTinsley Ellis\n\nNaked Truth\n\nAlligator Records\n\nMaster Blues Rocker Goes Back To His Acoustic Roots With No Safety Net\n\nI’ve yet to see Tinsley Ellis play live; possibly worrying that he may be ‘too loud’ for my sensitive ears these days; so when I received his latest release the cover alone excited me and made my taste buds salivate.\n\nAs the album title suggests, Ellis has ‘gone back to his Roots’ and stripped a bunch of songs back to their ‘naked truth;’ as this is him alone with only a1969 Martin and a 1937 National Steel D-35 for company and absolutely no safety net.\n\nWhen I pressed ‘play’ I had absolutely no idea what to expect, as I only know Ellis via his blistering electric Blues, so was left open mouthed when I heard Devil In The Room for the first time; as it sounds like something unearthed by a Bluesoligist sometime between the 1930’s and 60’s …. not something written and recorded in 2023!\n\nSo right from the ‘git go’ Tinsley Ellis pays homage to the forefathers of the Blues with style, grace and a lot of passion.\n\nOf the 12 tracks here only three are cover versions; I say ‘only’ as I’d half expected that he would mostly do his versions of the Classics with a couple of clever rarities; but no sirree Tinsley Ellis has thrown down his own marker here with some outstanding Acoustic Blues songs of his own.\n\nAs everything is wound back to 2 or 3, Ellis’s voice steals the show somewhat as it sounds ever more desperately emotional on the raw Tallahassee Blues and Grown Ass Man than I’d ever have expected; and both songs are quite contemporary, while the melodies hark back to the middle of the last century; which is quite some achievement.\n\nEllis’s selection of songs/tunes to cover are as contrary as it comes. Does the world need a note for note recreation of Death Letter Blues? Probably not, but it actually works in this group of songs I suppose. I didn’t recognise the title of Willie Dixon’s Don’t Go No Further; but this punchy rendition sort of sounds familiar, so I wonder if I own a version under a different title? (It’s not uncommon).\n\nThe last of the triumvirate is a stunning Leo Kottke instrumental called A Sailor’s Grave on The Prairie which I’ve never heard before and really showcases Tinsley’s fluid and intricate guitar skills.\n\nAlthough it annoyed Mrs Magpie when I played NAKED TRUTH one day while she was reading; I’ve become totally immersed in it myself, as it’s come along at a difficult period in my life and tracks like Hoochie Mama and the genre-fusing instrumental Silver Mountain have taken me into a zone that was needed even if I didn’t know it.\n\nThere’s certainly a lot to like here for lovers of Acoustic Blues; not least the tragically beautiful instrumental Easter Song which closes the record, or the two songs vying for first place inside my head as a Favourite Song.\n\nThe first to tell you about is the tragic Windowpane; which features some timelessly gorgeous guitar picking and Ellis sounding brokenhearted and close to tears as he takes us on an unexpected backroads journey of lost love.\n\nThe other, Horseshoes and Handgrenades is another of the new songs that sounds so authentic you can picture Tinsley sitting on a back porch in front of a transfixed group of young and old family alike, listening to his wise words and tragedy laden voice.\n\nI love ‘discovering’ new music and ‘being surprised’ by either established acts like this trying something completely new and different from anything you ever expected when you picked the album sleeve up in a record shop …. and here; Tinsley Ellis certainly delivers the goods with style, reverence and passion.\n\nReleased 9th February2024\n\nhttps://tinsleyellis.com/\n\nBUY DON’T SPOTIFY\n\nhttps://www.alligator.com/albums/Naked-Truth-LP/\n\nhttps://tinsleyellis.com/store"
