        "text": "LaBARGE, Bernie\n\nBorn: Bernard Leo LaBarge on March 11, 1953 in Ottawa, Ontario\n\nBernie LaBarge started playing guitar at age 11. During the 1970s he was the frontman and/or guitarist for many popular Canadian bands (Bond, Rain, Sweet Blindness, Zwol, Stem, Stingaree). His first original recording was “Catwalk” by Rain and released the band’s self-titled album on Axe Records in 1972. LaBarge released a single entitled “Dream Away” (WEA) in 1981. It was produced by soon-to-be famous producer Daniel Lanois, and featured LaBarge on guitar, vocals, and electric piano, with Jim Vallance (Prism, Bryan Adams) on drums, and Jeff Jones (Red Rider, Carpet Frogs) on bass. The song became one of the most-played songs of 1981. LaBarge was signed to CBS Records in 1984 and released his debut album ‘Barging In’ that year. The album spawned two singles including the charting “Still In Love With You”. He would be nominated for ‘Most Promising Male Vocalist’ at the 1984 JUNO Awards. After winning the Canadian Songwriting Contest in 1986 (in the ‘Best R & B Song’ category) he was signed to RCA Records in 1987 where he released another two singles “Listen To A Boy In Love” and “Turn On the Lights Before You Leave”. Many top Canadian and International performers have covered his songs since then. Meanwhile, he was working in the jingle business performing on advertisements for Coke, Pepsi, GM, Ford, and Nissan. LaBarge has also played guitar on Jim Henson’s popular ‘Fraggle Rock’ TV series (1983 – 1987), ‘Smith & Smith’ (1979 – 1985), ‘Danger Bay’ (1985 – 1989) on CBC, and ‘Party With The Rovers’ (1983 – 1986) on Global Television. Recently he was guitarist on the world-syndicated ‘Doodlebops’ show. Currently Toronto-based, Bernie LaBarge is the lead guitarist for The Dexters and Danny B and the R & B All-Stars. In November 2014 The Dexters celebrated their 20th anniversary at The Orbit Room in Toronto with a farewell performance. He has the distinction of having played at The Orbit Room more than 1000 times. with notes from Bernie LaBarge.

He studied voice with several instructors in Montreal and began to develop a love for French-Canadian folk music. He made his first singing appearance at the age of 17 for Radio Canada’ show ‘Le Réveil rural’. In 1937 he began doing stage productions. By 1946 he signed with National Concerts and Artists of New York and toured the East Coast of Canada and the Maritimes. Labrecque would represent Canada in 1949 at a Venice folk festival which convinced him to pursue the genre full time. He released his first album, ‘French Operetta Airs’, on the Decca label in 1950. It was well received and Labrecque decided to set up a new home base in Paris, France and remained in Europe where he sang for the Robert Dhéry group at the Variétés theatre for the next seven years. The Alliance Française sent him on tour allowing him to appear on European and UK radio and television programs. A highlight for Labrecque was appearing at the London Hippodrome. Starting in 1955 he began a series of performances for the JMC with accompanist Jean Guillou on piano. Following no less than eighty performances in two years, he moved back to Montreal he sang and was producer/publisher for Musicana Records. In Autumn 1957, the CBC announced a brand new children’s show called ‘Chez Jacques’ featuring Labrecque which was to run every other week, alternating with the Golden Age Players. Labrecque was hired to greet young viewers and guests into his fieldstone farmhouse for a half-hour of music and dance. The program appeared only once – on October 7, 1957.Labrecque was replaced by singer Alan Mills and Helene Baillargeon under the new programme title ‘Chez Nous’. By 1958 he had signed a long-term recording deal with London Records and released two albums. The exposure allowed him to have a summer residency entertaining at the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario. His album of French Folk Songs during another visit to Radio Canada in 19 60 and another album for London in 1961 made him a desirable addition at the 1961 Mariposa Folk Festival. He began doing audiovisual shows for his next set of JMC tours from 1970 through 1972 after which he returned to Paris, France for the next three years on a grant from the government of France. He was soon teaching French-Canadian folksongs at the University de Paris VI to students in an effort to re-educate those with impaired psychomotor skills. Labrecque also managed to perform several high profile shows at the Canadian Cultural Centre in Brussels as well as at the JM Camp in Belgium. Following his work in Paris, Labrecque returned to Canada and settled in the Charlevoix region of Québec. In 1976 Labrecque was host of the 14-part series “Chansons voltigeantes…chansons dolentes” on Radio Canada. By the 1980s he was heading the Éditions et Disques Patrimoine where he made new albums and produced a series of ‘Géographie sonore du Québec’ compilations of folk music featuring songs by Labrecque as well as Ernest Gagnon, Marius Barbeau, and Carmen Roy. Labrecque also managed the Galerie du Patrimoine to showcase paintings and exhibits relating to regional heritage.\n\nSingles\n\n1959 Jos Monferrand (London) 45FC-459\n\n1960 Monsieur cinquante/L’abattage (London) 45FC-472\n\n1960 Le temps du carnaval/La bastringue du carnaval (London) 45FC-474\n\n1960 Emmenez-en d’la pitoune/Le grand Joe (London) 45FC-482\n\n1961 The Relatives/Road To Grand’mere (London) M-17203\n\n1984 La Parente/Le Temps Des Fetes (Patrimoine) PAT-3701\n\nAlbums\n\n1950 French Operetta Airs (Decca) LX-4527\n\n1953 Le Canada chante pour vous [10”] (Pathé) AT-1029\n\n1953 Chansons Populaires du Canada (London) LB-957\n\n1957 Folk Songs of France and French Canada/Chansons populaires de France et du Canada (Folkways) FG-3560\n\n1958 Carnaval à Québec avec Labrecque (London) MB-17\n\n1958 La Parenté est arrivée… (London) MLP-10014\n\n1959 L’Inimitable Jacques Labrecque (London) MLP-10025\n\n1959 Jacques Labrecque présente Ti-Jean (London) MB-52\n\n1960 Jacques Labrecque en France (London) SMB-40033\n\n1960 French Canadian Folk Songs Fentok Guitar (Radio Canada International) RCI-162\n\n1961 On viola t’y n’avoir du plaisir (London) APM-140\n\n1983 Géographie sonore du Québec – Charlevoix (Patrimoine) PAT-2001\n\n1984 Dans la serie: Auters-Compositeurs (Patrimoine) PAT-18004\n\n1984 Chante Gilles Vigneault (Patrimoine) PAT-18005\n\n1985 Géographie sonore du monde de la mer (Patrimoine) PAT-18007\n\n1986 Chansons Traditionnelles Avec Jacques Labrecque (Patrimoine) PAT-18010\n\n1986 Géographie sonore du monde francophone du Canada (Patrimoine) PAT-18011\n\n1995 Chansons traditionnelles (Fonovox) VOX-7832-2\n\n1996 Singers and songs: a folksong portrait of Canada/Chanteurs et chansons: un portrait folklorique (Mercury/Polygram) 974800\n\n2002 Chants du pays: Jacques Lebrecque (XXI-21) XXI-CD-2-1429.\n\nwith JACQUES LABRECQUE et LA MANÈCANTERIE MEILLEUR\n\n1959 Noël et Carillons (London) MB-1\n\nwith JACQUES LABRECQUE et BOUILLARD\n\n1983 Géographie sonore du Québec – Saguenay-Lac St-Jean (Patrimoine) PAT-2000\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1967 “Blanche comme la neige”, “Le Prince Eugène”, “Chanson de Louis Riel”, “Chantons pour y passer le temps”, “À l’abri d’une olive”, “À la claire fontaine”, “Rossignolet sauvage”, “Nanette”, “Je sais bien quelque chose”, “V’là l’bon vent”, “Dans les chantiers nous hivernerons”, “Les Raftsmen”, “Fringue, fringue, sur la rivière!”, “Partons, la mer est belle”, “Vive la Canadienne”, “Le bal chez Boulé” and “Un Canadien errant” on ‘Canadian Folk Songs: A Centennial Collection’ (RCA) CS-100/5-ACM-39\n\nLaBRIE, James\n\nBorn: Kevin James Labrie on May 5, 1963 in Penetanguishene, Ontario\n\nFrom the small Georgian Bay port town of Penetanguishene, Ontario, LaBrie drew inspiration from his father and started singing and playing drums at age five. By his teenage years he began pursuing his love of rock music and by age 21 he began vocal training with opera singer coach Rosemary Patricia Burns for four years. After working with several Canadian bands, including a reformed Coney Hatch, Labrie became the vocalist for Sebastian Bach’s solo band and replaced him following Bach’s enlistment with Skid Row stateside. The group was renamed Winter Rose and released one independent self-titled album. The record attracted the attention of Atlantic Records but after the negotiations dragged on (and finally fell through) the band split up. Then Pierre Paradis, who managed the band Voivod, approached LaBrie about recording a solo album with Aquarius Records and another open door with an American band, Dream Theater out of New York, who was looking for a vocalist. Along with John Myung (bass), John Petrucci (guitars), Mike Portnoy (drums, percussion), Kevin Moore (keyboards), and former vocalist Charlie Dominici, Dream Theater carved out a niche as a thinking man’s progressive rock band and become hugely successful in Japan of all places. They had released one album in 1989 called ‘When Dream and Day Unite’ on Mechanic/MCA. But conflicts with Mechanic and their lead vocalist caused them to sever ties with both and Dream Theater spent several years looking for a new singer. After flying to New York to audition in 1991, LaBrie was invited to join the band. Signing with Atco/Atlantic Records, Dream Theater released its second album, ‘Images & Words’, in 1992. The video for the song “Pull Me Under,” became a quick MTV hit. With their fanbase growing and a strong third album, ‘Awake’, released in 1994, the group continued to be hampered by personnel changes. The band had a new keyboardist, Derek Sherinian, by their next album ‘A Change of Seasons’, in September 1995. Following a mini tour in 1996 the members of Dream Theater became involved with a variety of outside projects. LaBrie worked with Mull Muzzler, a group formed with Matt Guillory and Mike Mangini. After re-convening, the band released ‘Falling Into Infinity’ in 1997. Following another keyboardist change, Dream Theater released ‘Scenes From a Memory’ in 1999. This was followed by ‘Live Scenes From New York’ in 2001, an album that stirred controversy when its original cover featured the city of New York burning and pulled from store shelves due to the unfortunate events of September 11. The group has continued a steady stream of albums since with 2002’s ‘Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence’, 2003’s ‘Train Of Thought’, and 2005’s ‘Octavarium’. Labrie still lives in north of Toronto in his hometown of Penetang with his wife. In recent years he has worked on Henning Pauly’s Frameshift release. In 1999 he began fronting a new Prog Rock band side project called Mullmuzzler with Americans Mike Keneally (guitar), Bryan Beller (bass), Mike Mangini (drums) and Matt Guillory (keyboards). Labrie has released three solo albums to date.\n\nSingles\n\nwith DREAM THEATER\n\n1992 Metropolis Part 1 (Atco)\n\n1992 Pull Me Under (Atco) PRCD-4624\n\n1992 Take the Time (Atco) PRCD-4911\n\n1992 Another Day (Atco) PRCD-5077\n\n1993 Live (Atco) PRCD-5340\n\n1994 Caught in a Web (Atco) PRCD-5965\n\n1994 Lie (Atco) PRCD-5807\n\n1994 The Silent Man (Atco) PRCD-9117\n\n1995 Tears (Atco) AACD-1\n\n1997 You Not Me (Atco) PRCD-9954\n\n1997 Burning My Soul (Atco) PRCD-9898\n\n1997 Metal Sampler (Atco) PRCD-9899\n\n1997 Hollow Years (Atco) PRCD-9999\n\n1999 Home (Atco) PRCD-7408\n\n2000 Through Her Eyes (WEA) AMCY-7145\n\n2003 As I Am (Elektra) PRCD-1927\n\n2005 These Walls/Panic Attack (Warner)\n\n2007 Constant Motion (Road Runner) RRPROMO-993\n\n2008 The Dark Eternal Night (Road Runner)\n\n2009 A Rite of Passage (Road Runner) RDRR-10256\n\n2009 Stargazer (Road Runner)\n\n2009 Tenement Funster/Flick of the Wrist/Lily of the Valley (Road Runner)\n\n2009 Odyssey (Road Runner)\n\n2009 Take Your Fingers From My Hair (Road Runner)\n\n2009 Larks Tongues in Aspic Part II (Road Runner)\n\n2009 To Tame a Land (Road Runner)\n\n2011 On the Backs of Angels (Road Runner) PRO-16929\n\nAlbums\n\n2005 Elements of Persuasion (InsideOut – US) IOMCD-204\n\n2010 Static Impulse (InsideOut – US) IOMCD-445\n\n2013 Impermanent Resonance (InsideOut – US) IOMCD-596\n\nwith DREAM THEATER\n\n1992 Images and Words (Warner) CD-92148\n\n1993 Live At the Marquee [EP] (Warner) CD-92286\n\n1994 Awake (Warner) CD-90126\n\n1995 A Change of Seasons [EP] (Warner) CD-61842\n\n1997 Falling Into Infinity (Warner) CD-62060\n\n1998 Once In a Livetime (Warner) CD-62308\n\n1999 Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From a Memory (Warner) CD-62448\n\n2001 Live Scenes From New York (Warner) CD-62661\n\n2002 Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (Warner) CD-62742\n\n2003 Train of Thought (Warner) CD-62891\n\n2004 Live At Budokan (Warner) R2-76546\n\n2005 Octavarium (Warner) 83793\n\n2007 Systematic Chaos (Road Runner) RR-7992\n\n2008 Greatest Hit (…And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs) (Rhino) R2-429948\n\n2008 Forsaken [EP] (Road Runner) RDRR-10215\n\n2009 Black Clouds & Silver Linings (Road Runner) RR-7883\n\n2009 Wither [EP] (Road Runner) RDRR-10275\n\n2011 A Dramatic Turn of Events (Road Runner) RR-7765\n\nwith MULLMUZZLER\n\n1999 Keep It To Yourself (Magna Carta) MA-9039\n\n2001 Mullmuzzler 2 (Magna Carta) MA-9040\n\nwith frame•shift\n\n2003 Unweaving the Rainbow (Prog Rock) PRR-130\n\nLADIES CHOICE\n\nGino “Johnny” D’Orazio / Tony Bentivegna\n\nMontreal, Québec-based studio project orchestrated and performed by Bentivegna and D’Orazio who used a series of vocalists.

His early music career saw him as a member of the Steel City Slickers. He moved to Mississauga in 1975 and formed the band Next with Roly Greenway (Crowbar). He was a support player for the late Stompin’ Tom Connors in the late 1990s and in 2011. He worked closely with Randall Cousins’ Roto-Noto Records label on recording projects for Jack Diamond, Diane Raeside, Grant Tingey, Lisa Logan, and more. He was also a staff writer for Chappell Music and wrote material for Gene Watson (the song “Git Along Little Doggies” co-written with Dallas Harms), Ronald Reagan’s daughter Patti Davis, Marty Butler and Harold MacIntyre. LaForme also had a modest solo career, initially on Roto Noto, but then through a signing on RCA Records. He charted nationally with the 1985 single “Here Comes Love (Or Here Comes Trouble)” then in 1987 with “I Don’t Know You Anymore,” follow by “Long Gone” (1988), and “The Road I Walk” and “Makin’ It Easy.” Mark LaForme died July 20, 2023. with additional notes from Larry Delaney.\n\nSingles\n\n1985 Nothing Can Stop Me/[same] (Roto Noto) RN-1053\n\n1985 Here Comes Love (Or Here Comes Trouble) (Roto Noto)\n\n1985 Here Comes Love (Or Here Comes Trouble)/[same] (RCA) JB-50831\n\n1985 I Don’t Know You Anymore/Here Comes Love (Or Here Comes Trouble)/[same (RCA) PB-50853\n\n1987 Nashville Dream/[same] (RCA) JB-50922\n\n1988 Long Gone/Nashville Dream (RCA) PB-50966\n\n1989 The Road I Walk/[same] (Roto Noto) RN-1070\n\n1991 Makin’ It Easy (Roto Noto)\n\n1993 I’ll Comfort You (Roto Noto)\n\n1999 Do It All Over Again (A-C-T)\n\nAlbums\n\n1985 Here Comes Trouble [cassette (Roto Noto) RC-10056\n\n1997 No Frills (Roto Noto)\n\n1999 True To Form [cassette (A-C-T ) ACT-07974\n\n2006 Vintage (Alleged Iguana) RCD-20172\n\nLAHTI AND THE COLTS, Sam\n\nFrom Sudbury, Ontario.\n\nSingles\n\n1969 Please For Me/That’s The Reason (Vintage) SCV-1104 1970 Maybelline/Singing The Blues (Vintage) SCV-1111\n\nLAINE, Paul\n\nPaul Laine left home at 13 and by the time he was 16, he was playing regularly in bars he wasn’t even old enough to be in. At 18 he started saving money and eventually recorded a three song demo to submit to record labels which was subsequently rejected by everyone. Discouraged, he formed a management company to help new bands but sold his share in it less than a year later. With the money he re-recorded the demo because of many comments about the production quality. This time the tape generated some interest but nothing came out of it. Laine went back to the drawing board with more cash and entered a 16 track studio where he produced an impressive demo that led to a major label bidding war with CBS Records and Elektra. MuchWest VJ Terry David Mulligan gave Laine’s demo to Bruce Allen (Bryan Adams, Anne Murray, Tom Cochrane, BTO) and a management deal was signed. Eight months later he was signed to Elektra Records and Laine immediately formed a backing band featuring Kenny Kaos (guitar), Scott Brown (bass), Pat Steward (drums) and Paul Gogo (keyboards) to record and perform his compositions. Bruce Fairbairn (Scorpions, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith) produced 1989’s ‘Stick It In Your Ear’ at Little Mountain Sound in Vancouver, British Columbia. The album featured special guest appearances by Mickey Curry (Bryan Adams) on drums and James Cotton on harmonica. He did a cross country tour with Kim Mitchell, but the album failed to ignite at radio or retail. Laine struggled back on the bar scene before an opening came up in 1993 to front US hard rock Danger Danger after they’d lost their singer and heard his solo album. Laine toured and recorded five albums with Danger Danger including European dates in 1998 in support of their album ‘Four the Hard Way’. He also did backing vocals on the Bruce Fairbairn produced ‘Face the Heat’ by The Scorpions and Poison’s ‘Flesh & Blood’ album. He finally left Danger Danger in 2004 to work with his own band Shugaazer featuring Chris Matheson (guitar), Shane Demers (bass), and Roland Churchill (drums). In 2006 he teamed up with André Andersen and David Readman for the Anderson-Laine-Readman one-off studio project ‘III’ that was released to AOR fans in Europe.

Laing would get his music break when he sat in on drums for legendary Doo-Wop group The Ink Spots when they visited Montreal in 1961. In 1965 he joined Gary Ship’s group Bartholomew Plus 3 who were initially signed to Quality Records for two singles before moving over to Can-Am Records in 1966 for two more singles. After being signed to Atlantic Records stateside in 1967, Cream producer Felix Pappalardi produced their 1967 single “When I Fall In Love. With the departure of BPlus3’s Barry Albert in the summer of 1968, the band carried on under the name Energy. Meanwhile, Laing had kept in touch with Pappalardi who was playing bass in Leslie West’s new project Mountain and when the drummer’s position opened up in 1969, Laing joined Mountain which effectively put an end to the band Energy. Mountain lasted from 1969 to 1972 and produced the massive radio hit “Mississippi Queen”. With the band’s demise Laing and Leslie West formed a power trio with Cream’s Jack Bruce called, simply, West, Bruce and Laing. The group would release two studio albums and one live album for Columbia Records between 1972 and 1974. With Mountain reforming fully in 1974 they released two more albums – ‘Avalanche’ and ‘Twin Peaks’ – only to break up again in 1975. Laing and Leslie West recruited bass player Don Kretmer and second guitarist Mick Jones (who would go on to co-found Foreigner) under the banner The Leslie West Band. They released one album in 1975. Following that group’s demise, Laing would then embark on a solo career with the release of his 1977 album ‘Makin’ It On the Street’ for Elektra Records. In 1985 Mountain reconvened again for the release ‘Go For Your Life’. The band has carried on with Laing on drums ever since. In addition to Mountain, he has recorded as part of the group Cork with Eric Schenkman (Spin Doctors) and Noel Redding (Jimi Hendrix). In 2003, Laing and Leslie West co-wrote the book ‘Nantucket Sleighride and Other Mountain On-the-Road Stories’ about their career in Mountain. Laing then published his autobiography ‘Stick It!’. Leslie West’s drums from the Mountain song “Long Red” have been recognized as the most sampled drums used by Hip-Hop/Rap artists. Laing also has his own record label called Voiceprint.\n\nSingles\n\n1977 Heaven/See Me Through (Elektra) E-45393\n\n1977 Makin’ It On the Street/Somebody Tol Me (Elektra) E-45423\n\nwith BARTHOLOMEW PLUS 3\n\n1965 She’s Mine/You’re Not There (Quality) 1728X\n\n1966 ‘Cause I’m Alone/On a Wintery Night (Quality) 1802X\n\n1966 Taboo/Why, Oh Why (Can-Am) CA-200\n\n1966 My Babe Before/Delilah (Can-Am) CA-205\n\n1967 When I Fall In Love/I Can’t Go Back (Atlantic) 2439\n\nwith MOUNTAIN\n\n1969 Long Red/Blood of the Sun (Windfall/Bell) 531\n\n1970 Mississippi Queen/The Laird (Windfall/Bell) 532\n\n1970 For Yasgur’s Farm/To My Friend (Windfall/Bell) 533\n\n1970 Sittin’ OT A Rainbow/To My Friend (Windfall/Bell) BLL 1125\n\n1971 The Animal Trainer and the Toad/Tired Angels (Windfall/Bell) 534\n\n1971 Travelin’ In the Dark/Silver Paper (Windfall/Bell) 535\n\n1972 Roll Over Beethoven/Crossroader (Windfall/Bell) 536\n\n1972 Waiting To Take You Away/Nantucket Sleighride (Live) (Windfall/Bell) 537\n\n1973 Theme For An Imaginary Western/Roll Over Beethoven (Windfall) BLPB-214-W\n\n1985 Hard Times/Makin’ It in Your Car (Scotti Bros.) 7Y0083\n\n1985 Spark/I Love Young Girls (Scotti Bros.) 7Y0089\n\n1995 Mississippi Queen/Solution (Columbia) CSK-7010\n\nwith WEST, BRUCE & LAING\n\n1972 Why Don’tcha/Mississippi Queen (Columbia) 4-45829\n\n1972 Shake Ma Thing (Rollin’ Jack)/The Doctor (Columbia) 4-45751\n\n1973 Dirty Shoes/Backfire (RSO) 2090-113\n\nwith THE LESLIE WEST BAND\n\n1974 Money/Dear Prudence//Get It Up/Setting Sun (Phantom/RCA) HB-10424\n\n1975 We Gotta Get Outta This Place/By the River (Phantom/RCA) HB-10522\n\nAlbums\n\n1977 Makin’ It On the Street (Elektra) 7E-1097\n\nwith MOUNTAIN\n\n1970 Climbing!

Her first love has always been singing and her pursuit of this passion led to a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1971. She is adept at both official languages and managed to gain a foothold in both Québec and Ontario. However, her first and only hit single, “A Corner of Your Heart”, was in English only to try and capture the remainder of the Canadian market. The song and its B-side were both written by famed songwriting duo Marty Butler and Bob Bilyk. Landry has continued her role as Québec chanteuse and has been recording material during the ’90’s with Avatar/OHM Records, an independent label in Québec. She’s also become a renowned photographer whose photos have graced brochures and special projects for Québec Culture & Communications. with notes from Diane Landry.\n\nSingles\n\n1970 A Corner of Your Heart/I’m Gonna Get Out (Columbia) C4-2993\n\n1971 Havin’ A Time of My Life/Everyday Faces and Everyday People (Columbia) C4-3026\n\nLANDRY, Ned\n\nBorn: Frederick Lawrence Landry on February 2, 1921 in St. John, New Brunswick\n\nDied: August 25, 2018\n\nA self-taught musician, Landry learned to play harmonica at age four and eventually fiddle. Landry first came to prominence in Canada after appearing on Don Messer’s CHSJ radio show ‘Backwoods Breakdown’ in 1934 as a harmonica player. With his band, The New Brunswick Lumberjacks, the group placed second on CBS Radio’s ‘Major Bowes’ Amateur Hour’ in New York City in 1939, but he took time off to join the Army. He rose to fame as a solo artist following the Second World War appearing in the early 1950s on CFBC radio, Saint John. By 1950 he’d also landed a recording contract with RCA Records where he released a series of 78 RPM and 7” singles and later eight albums before moving on to several smaller labels which eventually included his own Landry Records. He would then take awards as a three-time Canadian Open Fiddle Champion in 1956, 1957, and 1962. In the 1960s he teamed with Don Messer again, this time on ‘Don Messer’s Jubilee’ TV show. Aside from his extensive 40 years of touring he performed for the Prince of Wales in Fredericton on one occasion, and at Disney World in Florida. Among his accolades are Member of the Order of Canada (1991), the Dr. Helen Creighton Lifetime Achievement Award (2002), a lifetime contribution award from the Canadian Grand Masters Fiddling Championship which named a trophy after him, an induction into the North American Fiddlers Hall of Fame, the Nova Scotia Country Music Hall of Fame (2000), and the New Brunswick Hall of Fame (1983). He died peacefully at the age of 97 on August 25, 2018. Landry is survived by five children, 19 grandchildren, 34 great-grandchildren, and 11 great-great-grandchildren. with notes from John R.

She eventually relocated to Toronto after various musical and television projects failed to boost her profile. She soon met former Tenants member Andy McLean through a mutual friend. The duo began writing songs which they demoed for Gerry Young (Current Records) who shopped a deal through Polygram Records’ Vertigo label. In 1986 they released their self-titled debut and had some radio play with the single “Date With the Past”, but critics were unkind in their reviews of the album and a second single, “Can’t Hold On”, failed to crack the charts; Lands disappeared from the music industry spotlight for nearly 10 years doing a stint in the Toronto stage production of ‘Les Miserables’ as Eponine. Her recording comeback would be a well received and radio friendly solo album in 1996 called ‘Angels And Ordinary Men’ which also doubled as an enhanced CDRom. The release earned Lands a JUNO Award nomination. She then spent five years writing and recording in Los Angeles. She had been co-writing with songwriter Larry John McNally (Rod Stewart, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley) who saw her perform at The Mint in Los Angeles. Upon her return to Canada Emmy Award winning songwriter/pianist Don Breithaupt and JUNO Award winning producer Greg Kavanagh, relentlessly pursued Lands to work with her in some capacity. With her musical and life partner, Jim Gillard, they co-wrote 10 of 11 songs and headed to the studio to record 2011’s jazz album ‘Mumble’. In 2012, Lands auditioned and won the voice acting role as the character Black Widow in the mobile phone game app based on the Marvel Comics box-office hit movie ‘The Avengers’.

Robbie Lane And The Disciples received their big break in December 1963 when Ronnie Hawkins hired them as insurance for the soon to be defecting Hawks (who indeed did quit Hawkins’ side to become The Band). Hawkins would have the Disciples playing upstairs at the Hawks’ Nest while the Hawks themselves played downstairs at the Le Coq d’Or with Hawkins himself running sets between the two floors. With the departure of The Band, Robbie Lane And The Disciples ran double shift as Ronnie Hawkins And The Hawks while also maintaining their own name sake for recording purposes (though they did record three singles with Hawkins as The Hawks). Their first Disciples recording was on Hawkins’ Hawk Records label called “Fannie Mae” and was produced by Scott ‘Professor Piano’ Cushnie. The flipside, “She’s The One”, was a Dominic Troiano tune. The follow-up single in 1964 was “Ain’t Love A Funny Thing” and was produced by Hawkins alumnus Fred Carter and made the song a nominal hit. By June 1965 Robbie Lane And The Disciples parted company with Ronnie Hawkins (who would soon replace the band with musicians known better as Crowbar). They hit a slow year following this but came back publicly as house band for CTV-TV’s ‘It’s Happening’ show. Capitol Records saw them and soon signed them for an album and several singles of material. The first of these singles was the Dion (DiMucci) song “Sandy” in 1965 followed by “What Am I Gonna Do?” and finally the band’s first original song released as an A-side, “You Gotta Have Love”, both from 1966. The band would also take to recording the theme song “It’s Happening” as a single in 1967. The music director for the TV show was none other than Dr. Music himself, Doug Riley, who helped the Disciples land a television advertisement jingle for Baby Ruth chocolate bars. Members of the Disciples along with Riley recorded and released the song “Baby Ruth” under the pseudonym The Butterfingers. By the end of 60’s, Robbie Lane And The Disciples had become out of step with musical trends and the band split up. Lane, himself, continued on with ‘It’s Happening’ before embarking on a moderately successful solo career. He used members of the Canadian Downbeats when heading out west as his backing band. He recorded a solo album in Nashville in 1968 but the material never materialized until the ‘Backtrax – Best of Robbie Lane & The Disciples’ package by Pacemaker Records in 1996. His true solo career hit its stride in 1974 with the single “M’Lady” which was written by Brian Allen (of the group Toronto and Attic Records executive). The song was actually just Lane singing over the backing tracks of Allen’s old band Rose who had recorded the material but never released the song. His next outing was the Joey Miller song “Missing You” featuring full orchestration and vocal accompaniment by Dianne Brooks and Rhonda Silver. In the 1980’s the original version of Robbie Lane & The Disciples reunited and in the 90’s Lane, Bush and Trach continue on with new members to entertain at Toronto clubs frequently. The band released a live album in 1996 called ‘Ain’t Dead Yet’. with notes from Glenn Hill and Denis Thievin.

An enthusiastic rapper, Peterson nicknamed himself Tory Lanez (his last name coming from his childhood penchant for playing in the streets). He dropped out of high school in Grade 10 at the age of 16 and by 17 he was rapping at outdoor concerts. In 2009, Lanez released his debut mixtape, ‘T.L. 2 T.O.’ During time in Florida he began directing music videos and posting them on YouTube. This caught the attention of rapper/producer Sean Kingston who met with Lanez in February 2010. In 2010, Lanez released the mixtapes ‘Just Landed,’ ‘One Verse One Hearse,’ ‘Playing For Keeps,’ and ‘Mr. 1 Verse Killah.’ In 2011, Lanez signed a record deal with Kingston’s Time is Money Entertainment and released the mixtapes, ‘Mr. Peterson,’ ‘Chixtape,’ and ‘Swavey.’ He later left the label to be an independent artist. In 2012, he released the mixtapes ‘Sincerely Tory,’ then ‘Conflicts of My Soul: The 416 Story’ in 2013,’ and ‘Chixtape II’ in 2014. Lanez then released two episodes of the “Public Swave Announcement” showing behind the scenes footage of the ‘These Things Happen Tour’ featuring G-Eazy and Rockie Fresh. By summer 2014 he released the song, “Teyana, and “The Godfather.” The latter track was part of an announcement that Lanez was only releasing songs, albums, or videos on ‘Fargo Fridays’ through HotNewHipHop. The songs “I’ll Be There,” “Talk On Road,” and “Balenciagas” were released in late June 2014. “The Mission” was released in August to celebrate his first headlining tour, the “Lost Cause Tour,” on the heels of a new mixtape called ‘Lost Cause’ which would be released in October 2014. In April 2015, Lanez released the single “In For It” from his upcoming EP. This was followed by “Ric Flair” (featuring Rory Trustory) and “Acting Like” in May 2015. The EP, entitled ‘Cruel Intentions’ was released in late June 2015 along with the single “Karrueche.” In mid-July 2015 he released the first single “Say It” after signing with Mad Love/Interscope Records. Lanez released his mixtapes ‘Chixtape III’ and ‘The New Toronto’ on Christmas day 2015. “LA Confidential” was the next single released in January 2016 and on January 28, 2016 Tory Lanez performed “Say It” on Jimmy Kimmel Live! February 2016 saw the release of a remix of the track “Uber Everywhere” followed by the March 2016 release of the “Tim Duncan” as part of his Fargo Fridays series. “Real Addresses” was released the following week. On March 26, 2016, during violent scuffles between security and concertgoers at a concert in Midland, Texas, Lanez told the crowd to “fuck shit up,” which incited rioting the closing down of the show. Legal action from the venue and promoters is still pending. In April 2016, Tory Lanez and ASAP Ferg collaborated on the song, “Line Up the Flex” to promote their forthcoming ‘Level Up Tour.’In early May he released two songs, “For Real” and “Unforgetful” as a part of the Fargo Friday series. The single “Luv” was released in late July from his next full-length album ‘I Told You’ which was released in August followed by an extensive tour through 2016/2017. Lanez’ follow-up album, ‘Memories Don’t Die,’ in March 2018, followed in October that year with another album entitled ‘Love Me Now?’ ‘Chixtape 5’ followed in November 2019 and garnered several nomination for the 2020 JUNO Awards.

She decided to study music at Red Deer College, where she dabbled a bit in country and folk. Starring in a collegiate theatrical production of the life of Patsy Cline helped her refine her sound. Moving to Edmonton after graduation, she got into performance art and embraced feminism. After answering an ad in a newspaper looking for a country singer to entertain at a party she was partnered with an existing group called The Reclines featuring Dave Bjarnason (drums), Farley Scott (bass), Gordie Matthews (guitar), and Stewart MacDougall (piano, vocals). During the band’s shows, lang would go table to table at gigs to sell an independent single they’d recorded in 1983 called “Friday Dance Promenade”, and in 1984 they would record their debut album for manager Larray Wanagas’ Bumstead Records entitled ‘A Truly Western Experience’. Two singles from that album and their accompanying videos, “Bopalena” and “Hanky Panky”, attracted attention across Canada at college radio and MuchMusic, where lang began to gain a reputation for her slightly offbeat approach to both her image and her music. She was then teamed with former FM band member Ben Mink as writer/violinist. Over time The Reclines were let go and Mink began touring with her along with hired musicians. Eventually, Teddy Borowiecki, one of original Reclines, later rejoined her as a piano player. She garnered enough success with the album that she won the 1985 JUNO Award for ‘Most Promising Female Artist,’ which she accepted in a wedding dress. With all the attention k.d. lang was getting in Canada, Sire Records in the US sat up and took notice, and so in 1986, she signed with them worldwide. Her first album for the label was still designated a Reclines record entitled ‘Angel With A Lariat,’ and was produced by Dave Edmunds. It got excellent reviews from the rock critics, heavy support from college radio and cutting-edge country stations, and became a mainstream Canadian hit. It was also an underground US hit, but it was snubbed by Nashville for not being their version of country. However, her amazing voice and strong live show helped garner even more praise and attention. Her second album, ‘Shadowland’, was recorded in Nashville in 1987 and was produced by Patsy Cline’s producer, Owen Bradley. This combined with the inclusion of lang’s duet on “Crying” with Roy Orbison (originally recorded for the soundtrack of the film “Hiding Out”) made the traditional country audiences and industry sit up and take notice, and the first single, “I’m Down To My Last Cigarette”, went country top 40. The album itself went gold and she continued to knock out the critics with her voice and persona. 1988’s ‘Absolute Torch And Twang’, her third album, only helped to solidify her American country audience and showcased her increasingly strengthened voice. She won the Grammy Award in 1989 for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female, and had her first top 25 hit in the summer of that year with “Full Moon Of Love”. Because of her increasing notoriety, her decision to launch a campaign against eating meat in 1990 attracted a veritable media circus, and helped to establish her as a force to be reckoned with. This is part of the reason why, when she came out as a lesbian in an interview with The Advocate before the fourth album, she was able to deflect any slings and arrows that may have been lodged at her for doing so. However, anyone expecting her to continue in her country vein with her next album got a big surprise – 1992’s ‘Ingenue’ was not country at all but an album or adult-oriented pop that attracted a whole new audience to her unbelievable voice. The first single, “Constant Craving”, was her first top 40 pop hit in the US, she won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female, and the album went platinum in the US, the UK and Australia; in Canada it went double-platinum (200,000 copies). Following the success of Ingenue, many assumed that she would go right back into the studio and release something quickly to cash in on that success. However, she again took another career turn and recorded the soundtrack for the movie “Even Cowgirls Get The Blues”, which was released several months before the movie and was a critical if not commercial success. Her next studio album of new material was not released until 1995, and ‘All You Can Eat’ once again did not live up to the success of Ingenue. Her latest release was Drag in 1997, and she continues to be regarded as one of the strongest vocalists of her time. She returned in June 2000 with the breezy ‘Invincible Summer’. The tour for the album led to a VH-1 ‘Live By Request’ appearance that was released in 2001 as her next album. In 2004 she decided to pay tribute to Canadian songwriters with ‘Hymns of The 49th Parallel’ where her version of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” brought her back into the spotlight with performances of the song on various television shows including the 2005 JUNO Awards and the 2010 Winter Olympics. with notes from Liam Lacey.\n\nSingles\n\n1988 I’m Down To My Last Cigarette/Western Stars (Sire) 92-79197\n\n1988 Lock, Stock And Teardrops/Don’t Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes (Sire) 92-78137\n\n1988 Busy Being Blue/[same] (Sire) PRO-919\n\n1988 Sugar Moon/Honky Tonk Angel’s Medley (Sire – UK) W-7841\n\n1988 Western Stars/[same] (Sire – SPAIN) 955\n\n1991 Barefoot (Rhythmic Version)/Barefoot (Acoustic Version) [7″] (Sire – GERMANY) 5439-19137-7\n\n1992 Constant Craving/Season of Hollow Soul (Sire) 7-18942\n\n1992 Miss Chatelaine/Outside Myself (Sire) 9-40792\n\n1992 The Mind Of Love (Where Is Your Head Kathryn?)/Three Cigarettes In An Ashtray (Sire – UK) W-0170\n\n1993 Just Keep Me Moving/In Perfect Dreams (Sire) 9-41197\n\n1993 Hush Sweet Lover (Album Version) (Sire/Warner – US) PRO-CD-6748\n\n1993 Lifted By Love [4 mixes] (Sire/Warner) 9-41379\n\n1995 If I Were You/Get Some (Warner) 9-43624\n\n1996 You’re O.K./If I Were You [3 mixes] (Warner – US) WO-332CD\n\n1996 Sexuality (Radio Version) (Warner – US) PRO-CD-8050\n\n1996 Sexuality [6 mixes] (Warner) 9-43676-2\n\n1997 The Air That I Breathe (Warner)\n\n1997 The Joker (Warner) PRO-CD-8862\n\n1997 Theme From ‘The Valley of the Dolls’ (Warner) 9-43952\n\n1999 Anywhere But Here (Atlantic) PRCD-9059\n\n2000 The Consequences of Falling (Warner – Europe) 93624494\n\n2000 Summerfling (Warner) 9-44895\n\n2004 Helpless (Nonesuch) PRO-15040\n\n2004 Love Is Everything (Nonesuch) PRO-CDR-101518\n\n2004 Simple (Nonesuch) PR0-15449\n\n2007 I Dream of Spring (Nonesuch) NS-014CD\n\n2008 Coming Home (Nonesuch) PRO-CDR-516214\n\n2010 Hallelujah (Vancouver Winter Olympics 2010) (Nonesuch)\n\n2018 Sleeping Alone (Live From The Majestic Theatre) [DigiFile] (Nonesuch)\n\n2021 Constant Craving (Fashionably Late Remix)/Constant Craving (Fashionably Late Remix Edit) [feat.

After the separation of his parents in 1963, Lanois moved with his mother to Hamilton, Ontario where he learned the guitar. Lanois cut his teeth as a guitarist with Ray Materick’s band and later studio work with Willie P. Bennett and the Dixie Flyers as well as The Stringband. In 1972 he was the guitarist, along with future Grant Avenue studio engineer Bob Doidge, in the folk/country act Morgan with Lindsay and Jacqueline Morgan. Lanois’ interest in recording began in 1970, when he and his brother Bob Lanois bought a four-track recording machine which they set up in their laundry room as a make-shift recording studio offering local bands a place to record. By offering more than just engineering and production assistance in the form of songwriting and arranging, the Lanois brothers gained a reputation amongst the Hamilton area music industry. By the early ’80’s they had once again upgraded to a full-blown recording facility named Grant Avenue Studios. While working on material by such acts as Ian Tyson, Simply Saucer, The Shakers, Brian’s Children and Raffi, Lanois began working closely with King Crimson/Roxy Music keyboardist Brian Eno who taught Lanois the technique of guitar and studio ambience and sound manipulation techniques. Following Eno return to the UK, Lanois began applying his new techniques to the recordings of such acts as The Parachute Club, Martha And The Muffins, and in 1983, producing improvisational trumpet player Jon Hassell’s album ‘Aka Darbari Java (Magic Realism)’. In 1984, after working with Eno on guitarist Michael Brooks’ ‘Hybrid’ and Harold Budd’s ‘The Pearl’, Lanois was asked to co-produce U2’s ‘The Unforgettable Fire’. The success and overall production feel of the recording came to the attention of Peter Gabriel who invited Lanois to co-produce the ‘Birdy’ soundtrack. Lanois and Gabriel worked so well together that he was asked to produce Gabriel’s 1986’s million selling ‘So’ album which finally launched Gabriel as an accessible commercial recording artist. However, it would be his and Eno’s second co-production outing with U2 on ‘The Joshua Tree’ (1987) that would finally bring Lanois fame. With a Grammy for ‘The Joshua Tree’ and the immediate release of the Lanois co-produced ‘Robbie Robertson’ debut solo album, he found his dance card full. In 1989, he spearheaded Bob Dylan’s comeback album ‘Oh Mercy’ as well as the Neville Brothers’ ‘Yellow Moon’ considered to be a breakthrough for the New Orleans soul group. By this time Lanois had already built his own studio, Kingsway Studio, while living in New Orleans. It was here that he finally laid the foundation for his debut solo album – 1989’s ‘Acadie’. In 1991 he worked with U2 for a third time on their career altering ‘Achtung Baby’ followed by another Gabriel team-up in 1992 for the album ‘Us’. Lanois returned to his own musical muse in 1993 with ‘For The Beauty Of Wynona’ and toured as part of the Tragically Hip’s ‘Another Roadside Attraction’ but like ‘Acadie’ before it was a commercial failure. With one more lukewarm solo disc, ‘Cool Water’, Lanois returned to the non-stop production grind for others including Emmylou Harris’ ‘Wrecking Ball’ (1995), Luscious Jackson’s ‘Fever In, Fever Out’ (1996), and Dylan’s 1997 comeback ‘Time Out of Mind’. During all this activity he found time to record the soundtrack to 1996’s ‘Sling Blade’ movie. In the 2000’s he resumed production work with U2 on their album ‘No Line On the Horizon’ . His 2005 album ‘Belladonna’ was nominated for a Grammy Award and he was inducted into Canada’s ‘Walk of Fame’ the same year. He also provided an instrumental score for the Pixies documentary ‘LOUDquietLOUD’. Lanois released his own documentary ‘Here Is What Is’ at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2007 which is a behind-the-scenes chronicle of the recording of his album of the same name. Soon after, Lanois released a three-disc recording called Omni. In October 2009, Lanois started a project called Black Dub which features Lanois (guitar), Brian Blade (drums), Daryl Johnson (bass) and multi-instrumentalist/singer Trixie Whitley. They released a self-titled album in 2010 and played several live gigs including an appearance at the 2011 Bonnaroo Music Festival. While working on Neil Young’s record ‘Le Noise’ in June 2010 Lanois sustained life-threatening injuries in a motorcycle accident in Silverlake, California. After recovering, he packed up and returned to Canada. He has a new recording studio in Toronto that is located inside a Buddhist temple and he’s released his autobiography ‘Soul Mining’. with notes from Marc Hohmann.\n\nSingles\n\n1989 Jolie Louise/Little Sadie (Live) (Opal/WEA) 92-27627\n\n1989 Still Water [12″] (Opal/WEA) PRO-A-3942\n\n1990 The Maker/Still Water (Opal/Warner Music – UK) W-9844\n\n1993 Inedits (WEA)\n\n1993 Lotta Love to Give/The Messenger (WEA)\n\n1993 The Messenger (WEA) PRO-CD-6316\n\nwith THE LIVE IT UP BAND\n\n1979 Live It Up/Vanessa’s Dance (Boot) BTX-254\n\nwith BLACK DUB\n\n2010 I Believe In You (Radio Edit)/I Believe In You (Album Version) (Jive/Red – US) 88697-79293-2\n\n2010 Surely (Radio Edit) (Jive/Red – US)\n\nAlbums\n\n1989 Acadie (Opal/WEA) 25969\n\n1993 For The Beauty Of Wynona (WEA) 9-45030\n\n1994 Cool Water (ITM)\n\n2003 Shine (Anti-) 86661-2CV\n\n2004 Rockets (Anti-) 34457-16392\n\n2005 Belladonna (Anti-) 86767-1\n\n2008 Here Is What Is (Red Floor) CD-DLR-003\n\n2009 Omni Series – Steel / Purple Vista / Santiago [3CD] (Red Floor)\n\n2011 Harvest Festival 2011 (Daniel Lanois)\n\n2014 My Music For Billy Bob (Red Floor)\n\n2014 Flesh And Machine (Anti-) 87386-2\n\n2021 Heavy Sun [LP] (eOne) EMC-LP-28569\n\n2022 Player, Piano (Modern/BMG) 95306\n\nwith BLACK DUB\n\n2010 Black Dub (Jive/Sony) 88697-74094-2\n\nwith DANIEL LANOIS / ROCCO DELUCA\n\n2016 Goodbye To Language (Anti-/Red Floor) 87471-2\n\nwith VENETIAN SNARES X DANIEL LANOIS\n\n2018 Venetian Snares x Daniel Lanois [LP] (Timesig – UK) TIMESIG008X\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1993 “Still Water” on ‘New Frontiers (WEA – Italy) 831952\n\n2001 “Still Water” on ‘Oh What a Feeling 2: A Vital Collection of Canadian Music’ (CMC) 0885\n\nLARA\n\nBorn: Lara Arleninov\n\nQuebec singer whose backing performers featured future Les B.B. members François Jean and Patrick Bourgeois.\n\nSingles\n\nas LARA\n\n1986 Don’t Bother/I’ll Change (LongLegs) UR-4545\n\nLARK, Tobi\n\nBorn: Bessie Grace Upton in 1941 in Alabama, USA\n\nUpton was born in Alabama but raised in Detroit. She is the daughter of Gospel singer Emma Washington whom she sang with in the Emma Washington Gospel Singers group. After ten years with the group she got a job as backing vocalist for B.B.King. In 1963 she was signed to the Riverside label as Bessie Watson and released the single “Deed I Do” with the Cannon Ball Adderley Quintet as backing band. She then did two more singles with the Jay Pee label – “I’m In Your Corner” and “Wake Up Trying”. She then changed her name to Tobi Lark and released singles on the Palmer, Topper and USD labels. After a separation from her husband in the late 1960’s she and her young son relocated to Montreal, Québec. She performed in nightclubs and showcased at ‘Expo 67’ before moving to Toronto to become a backing vocalist for Ronnie Hawkins. She landed a lead role in the musical ‘Hair’ and established the Armageddon Revue at the Blue Orchid Club. She finally had a hit on the Mala label with the 1968 song “Time Will Pass You By” under the one-off name “Tobi Legend” for contractual reasons. She was an in-demand vocalist and did work with the Impressions, King Curtis, Four Tops, Ben E. King, Wilson Pickett and Duke Ellington among others. She then carried on as Tobi Lark and released two singles on Cotillion Records in 1969 “Shake a Hand” and “Just To Hold My Hand” stateside. Back in Canada she was signed to Jack Richardson’s Nimbus 9 Records who had her do a cover version of the Cat song “We’re All In This Together” which was recorded live with a gospel choir at St. Paul’s Cathedral in Toronto. The song peaked at No.38 on the RPM Top100 singles chart in November 1970. With a new deal on Arpeggio Records in 1972, Lark managed to scratch the bottom of the radio charts with “Here I Go Again” and “Bayou Children”. She has continued working in Toronto, Windsor and Detroit, and has performed with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Kenny Rogers among others. In 1995, she recorded a live CD and appeared at the Toronto Blues Society’s ‘Women’s Blues Revue’.\n\nSingles\n\n1965 I’ll Steal Your Heart/Talk To An Angel (Palmer – US) 5000\n\n1966 Happiness Is Here/Talkin’ About Love (Topper – US) 1011\n\n1966 Challenge My Love/Sweep It Out In The Shed (Topper – US) 1015\n\n1969 Just To Hold My Hand/Giving Up (Is Hard To Do) (Cotillion – US) 44059\n\n1972 Here I Go Again/Sing Out Sweet Jesus (Arpeggio) ARPS-1007\n\n1973 Bayou Children/Goin’ Home (Arpeggio) ARPS-1018\n\n2002 Challenge My Love/[split w/OC TOLBERT] [7″ (Kent – UK) TOWN-116\n\n2003 Happiness Is Here/[split w/DOTTIE & MILLIE] [7″ (Kent – UK) TOWN-120\n\n2006 True True Love/[split w/LITTLE ANN] (Kent Select – UK) CITY-001\n\n2007 Sweep It Out In The Shed/[split w/ DOTTIE & MILLIE] (Kent – UK) TOWN-134\n\nas BESSIE WATSON\n\n1963 Deed I Do/Cottage For Sale (Riverside) 4569\n\n1963 I’m In Your Corner/I’m Never Alone (Jay Pee – US) JU-1001\n\n1963 Wake Up Trying/Who’s Going To Miss You (Jay Pee – US) JU-1050\n\nas TOBY LARK\n\n1966 Lots Of Heart/A Woman’s Job (USD – US) 135\n\n1969 Shake A Hand/Twenty-Four Hours (Cotillion – US) 44025\n\nas TOBI LEGEND\n\n1968 Time Will Pass You By/Heartbreaker (Mala – US) MALA-591\n\n1968 No Good To Cry/Heartbreaker (Mala – US) M-12003\n\nas TOBI LARK WITH TORONTO\n\n1970 We’re All In This Together/Freedom Train (Nimbus) NNS-9011\n\nwith BESSIE WATSON WITH CANNONBALL ADDERLEY\n\n1962 Cottage For Sale/Deed I Do (Riverside) RF-4569\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1998 “Happiness Is Here” on ‘Soul Survivors 2: 25 Years of the Wigan Casino’ (Telstar TV – UK) TTVCD-2992\n\n1998 “Happiness Is Here”, “Sweep It Out In the Shed”, “Talking ‘Bout Love” on ‘Dave Hamilton’s Detroit Dancers (Kent – UK) CDKEND-154\n\n1999 “Challenge My Love” on ‘Dave Hamilton’s Detroit Dancers Volume 2’ (Kent – UK) CDKEND-177\n\n2005 “Happiness Is Here” on ‘Ace 30th Birthday Celebration – Soul and Funk’ (Ace – UK) CDCHK-1079\n\n2006 “True True Love” on ‘Dave Hamilton’s Detroit Dancers Volume 3 (Kent) CDKEND-257\n\n2007 “Happiness Is Here” on ‘Northern Monsters’ (Kent – US) CDKEND-272\n\nas TOBI LEGEND\n\n1994 “Time Will Pass You By” on ‘The Wigan Casino Story’ (Goldmine Soul Supply Ltd – UK) GSCD-51\n\n1997 “Time Will Pass You By” on ‘Soul Survivors’ (Telstar – UK) TCD- 2869\n\n2001 “Time Will Pass You By” on ‘Scootering Sounds’ (Anagram – UK) CDM- GRAM-144\n\n2001 “Time Will Pass You By” on ‘The Best Northern Soul All-Nighter…Ever!

They were all school chums and decided in 1965 to give the music business a shot. Graeme’s Dad, Keith, came up with the group name and helped the boys immensely with sound business advice. Keith introduced the group to Dave Marden (aka Jack London) who became their first manager. Formerly the leader of Jack London and The Sparrows, (who eventually morphed into Steppenwolf) Dave had many contacts and was instrumental in placing the group in Yorkville Village, the “hot spot” for Toronto in the 60’s. They wrote and produced three singles. The first, “The Laugh’s On Me” was recorded and released on the Canadian RCA label in late 1965, and received little air play. After a planned US tour fell through, the group then split with Dave Marsden, and in 1966 recorded their second single, “I Symbolize You”. Keith Box helped them obtain a distribution deal with Columbia and the single went to #1 in many Canadian cities. It reached No.14 on the prestigious CHUM chart in Toronto, no mean feat in the early days of Canadian rock. In 1967, the third, and what would become their final single, “Give Me Time”, was also successful. ARC Records took the group under it’s wing, and set them up with Brian Ahearn, Anne Murray’s producer. The chemistry wasn’t there, however, and nothing came of the deal. The Words tried to inject some fresh inspiration by adding two new members, vocalist/guitarist Bill Meisner (aka Bill Marion), formerly of The Paupers, and guitarist Neil Mattice. During rehearsals, this led to creative differences within the group, and they played their last engagement as a foursome on July 1, 1967 in London, Ontario. Bill Dureen left and the other original members continued with Meisner and Mattice for a short time. The final split came when bassist Campbell left to join The Paupers who were leaving to try their luck in New York with Albert G"
