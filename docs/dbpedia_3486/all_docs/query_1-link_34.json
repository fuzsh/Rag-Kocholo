        "text": "This outstanding vest came to us with a pair of mounted trousers, cavalry shell jacket and “pork-pie” style slouch hat with a cavalry hat cord. The group is from the well-known collection of the late James Stamatelos and can be seen on page 106 of “Echoes of Glory: Arms & Equipment of the Union.” Upon inspection we found that only the trousers were marked in the waistband with the name “D. E. Taft.” A search of internet records shows two soldiers with matching initials and last name. Both are Daniel E. Taft. One was in the 6th Vermont Infantry and the other in Battery K, 2nd Illinois Light Artillery. Not being able to make a good ID we decided to sell the items separately.\n\nThe collar and front of the vest is made of heavy sky-blue kersey wool while the back panel is made of white muslin. The left front has a breast pocket and one at the waist. The right side has the waist pocket only. Down the front are nine cuff sized General Service eagle buttons. All the buttons have plain backs and look to be original to the vest. The back of the vest has a strap with the proper period two pronged buckle for adjusting size. The inside of the vest is lined throughout with white muslin. The condition of this vest is excellent with only minor signs of wear around the shoulders.\n\nThis is one of the finest examples of a war-time vest that we have seen.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTHIS ITEM, AS WITH ALL OTHER ITEMS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEB SITE,\n\nMAY BE PURCHASED THROUGH OUR LAYAWAY PROGRAM.\n\nFOR OUR POLICIES AND TERMS,\n\nCLICK ON ‘CONTACT US’ AT THE TOP OF ANY PAGE ON THE SITE,\n\nTHEN ON ‘LAYAWAY POLICY’."
