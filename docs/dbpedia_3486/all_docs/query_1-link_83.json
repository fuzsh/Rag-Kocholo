He enlisted with the Shropshire Regiment Light Infantry and was asked to take his own horse. Although, unlike many others and he came back alive. He went on to have 8 children and died in mid 1950's, never really talking about his experiences in the war. Thank you to Andy and Lyn Prosser for their story to allow me to emphasise the horse in World War 1",
