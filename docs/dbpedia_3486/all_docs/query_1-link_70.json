        "text": "The Horse Soldiers – Original 1959 Motion Picture Movie Soundtrack.\n\nHand-signed by: John Wayne – William Holden.\n\nAUTHENTICITY\n\nThree Certificates support ALL hand-signed collectibles. A Certificate of Authenticity from ROCK STAR gallery assumes 100% of the responsibility for all items to be genuine. Most importantly, in this Big Buyer Beware Industry, ROCK STAR gallery is the “ONLY” company that chooses to use a third-party examiner. We use an independent, court-approved, forensic expert examiner. Examinations may include exemplary comparison, paper testing, ink testing, and the date of the item. In addition, included for insurance purposes, is a Valuation Letter referencing the market value for the artist.\n\nFRAMING\n\nOur custom-designed framing is of the highest quality in the industry. Also, we can customize the framing to suit your taste and needs. Framing designs include a Genuine RIAA Gold or Platinum Award Album. ROCK STAR gallery is the ONLY company in the industry to offer this. Plus, you may purchase an item unframed.\n\nGIFT WRAPPING\n\nGift wrapping with our unique wrapping paper is also an option. The paper is covered with Rock Star Signatures, therefore, opening the gift has rules. ALL signatures must be guessed before the gift may be opened! This truly makes it an EVENT!\n\nSHIPPING\n\nWe ship worldwide every day and we strive to meet your arrival date needs. Above all, our packaging is designed to make every effort that your purchase will arrive unharmed."
