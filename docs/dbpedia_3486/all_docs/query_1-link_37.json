        "text": "This week’s batch of new songs features a double-shot of hitmakers with Lainey Wilson teaming with Miranda Lambert for a new collaboration. Elsewhere, Orville Peck joins forces with Allison Russell on a song from Peck’s new album, while Alex Lambert and Gavin Adcock also offer new tunes.\n\nCheck out all these and more in Billboard’s roundup of the best country songs of the week below:\n\nLainey Wilson feat. Miranda Lambert, “Good Horses”\n\nTwo of country music’s most illustrious women artists team up for a double-shot of star power, as Wilson’s Louisiana drawl blends wondrously with Lambert’s Texas twang. On this laid-back song, they use the metaphor of a wild horse to acknowledge the wanderlust and draw of freedom and adventure amidst the need for the comforts of home, while offering a tender reminder to those they leave behind that “good horses always come home.” Sonically, this honeyed, hazy song lilts along with the grace, highlighting that not every star-powered song needs a high-voltage vocal performance — sometimes the gentle arc of direct, heartfelt words are made all the stronger for the gentleness.\n\nOrville Peck & Allison Russell, “Chemical Sunset”\n\nOn Orville Peck’s new album Stampede, he teams with Americana music luminary Allison Russell on this stomping, theatrical pairing. Their voices are tremendous, with Russell’s voice sultry and fluttering, and delicately cracking in just the right places with Peck’s vocal rendering a cavernous, steady foil, fusing to convey song’s brooding message of living life with desire and abandon, even as the world burns around them. “Chemical Sunset” marks an illustrious standout on this project.\n\nAlex Lambert, “She Ain’t Texas”\n\nTexan Lambert issues a bluesy country ballad that evokes trading the draw of home in the pursuit of ambition — in his case, leaving his home in Fort Worth, Texas to move to Nashville. His voice is at once rugged, wistful, soulful, and instantly commanding. Lambert wrote “She Ain’t Texas” with Jordan Lawhead, with production from Drew Allsbrook, Stefan Lit and Dylan Chambers. Lambert may be forlorn over the Lone Star State, but this track makes his Tennessee prospects favorable.\n\nKameron Marlowe & Marcus King, “High Hopes”\n\nThis song from Marlowe’s 2024 album Keepin’ the Lights On gets a bluesy reimagining, thanks to singer-songwriter-guitarist King. The song is a tightrope of mourning and longing as he moves through disappointment to the first glimmers of hope. On its surface, it’s a curious pairing between the mainstream country singer Marlowe and Americana stalwart King, but their voices blend mightily, while King’s guitar prowess gives the song a darker, moodier patina.\n\nChase Matthew with Fernando & Sorocaba, “Cold Blooded”\n\n“Casa Branca” hitmakers Fernando & Sorocaba team with country hitmaker Chase Matthew on their latest outing. Brazilian, EDM rhythms and country constructions weave together, turning heartache into a technicolor dancefloor anthem in this tale of a guy whose trying to earn the affections of someone whose “love is on lockdown,” as he toggles between hope and the knowledge that he’ll never break through her icy heart. Fernando & Sorocaba are set to release the upcoming project NASH, featuring more collabs with country artists including Dustin Lynch, LOCASH and more.\n\nGavin Adcock, “Run Your Mouth”\n\nGeorgia native and high school sports star-turned-singer Adcock broke through with the angsty ballad “A Cigarette,” but his new song conveys the embedded musical influence of Southern rock, as he growls and seethes his way through this moody, musical warning shot to someone who. “If you live like this, make sure that you don’t miss/ Your opportunity when you gotta go.” Adcock just released his album Actin’ Up Again, via Thrivin Here Records under exclusive license to Warner Music Nashville."
