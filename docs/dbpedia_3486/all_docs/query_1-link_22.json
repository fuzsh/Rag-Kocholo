        "text": "A nation of horses\n\nBetween 1811 and 1901, the number of horses in Britain grew from just over a million to more than 3 million. These animals were mighty draught horses, hard-working farm horses, racing thoroughbreds, old 'nags' and tiny Shetland ponies.\n\nIn the countryside they pulled ploughs and carts; in towns and cities they pulled omnibuses and cabs. Pit ponies hauled trucks of coal underground in mines. Horses were ridden in races and hunts, and for pleasure.\n\nHorses required\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, the Army needed thousands of civilian horses to serve alongside its soldiers.\n\nDifferent types were suited to different military roles. Riding horses were used in the cavalry and as officers’ mounts. Draught horses switched from pulling buses to hauling heavy artillery guns or supply wagons. Small but strong multi-purpose horses and ponies carried shells and ammunition.\n\nBy 1917, the Army employed over 368,000 horses on the Western Front. The vast majority of these were draught or pack animals rather than cavalry horses.\n\nThe Army’s Remount Department spent £67.5 million (about £3 billion in today’s money) purchasing, training and delivering horses and mules to the front. There were not enough horses in Britain that were fit for Army service, so large numbers had to be brought from abroad. Canada, for example, sent about 130,000 horses.\n\nSupply line\n\nHorses were part of a complex supply line. The British forces on the Western Front required a vast amount of ammunition, food and equipment.\n\nThe Army Service Corps was responsible for moving this material from the Channel ports, where it was collected in base depots. From there, supplies were moved by train to regulating stations, and then to either a railhead or advanced supply depot. For the final leg, they would be moved by horse, mule or motor transport to the quartermaster staff of front-line units.\n\nCarrying\n\nA horse can carry on its back only half the amount it can pull on a cart. However, unlike carts and other wheeled vehicles, horses and other pack animals can travel almost anywhere a soldier can go on foot.\n\nOn the Western Front, pack animals were often used to carry supplies to the front line, where roads had been destroyed by shelling or were swamped with mud.\n\nRough terrain\n\nOn the North-West Frontier of India and in East Africa, the nimble-footed mules of the Indian Army carried huge loads in mountainous terrain. This included special artillery guns that could be taken apart and transported by teams of eight mules.\n\nDuring the Sinai and Palestine campaigns, horses, mules and camels were used to carry supplies and ammunition across rough desert terrain that was impassable to carts or motor vehicles. But casualty rates were high in the unforgiving desert terrain. In 1916, the Army lost an average of 640 horses a week.\n\nPulling\n\nFor thousands of years, people have been harnessing horses to wheeled vehicles to efficiently transport heavy loads over long distances. Their huge power and strength made horses a valuable resource for the Army.\n\nThe success of the British war effort was largely dependent on draught horses. Often, the mud on the Western Front was so thick, or the desert sand of the Middle East so deep, that motor vehicles could not drive through it. Instead, it was left to horses to deliver cart loads of supplies, medicine, food and ammunition.\n\nTimber\n\nHorses also worked with the Forestry Corps, pulling felled logs and then moving cart loads of timber. Each forestry company had a team of 120 horses and there was great rivalry as to which team kept their horses in the best condition.\n\nWood was a vital resource for lining trenches and providing shelters for men and animals. It was used for the duckboards that enabled soldiers to cross the shell-scarred and muddy landscape. It was also used for railway sleepers on the narrow-gauge railways that transported troops and helped keep the Army supplied.\n\nDangers\n\nThousands of draught and pack animals succumbed to fatigue or diseases like mange. Others fell victim to the weapons of modern war.\n\nThe use of gas, artillery, mines, machine guns, mortars and tanks made the front a terrifying place for horses. In the early days of gas warfare, nose plugs were improvised for horses to help them survive. Later, special types of horse gas masks were developed.\n\nBarbed wire was used in vast quantities to protect trenches. But thousands of horses got caught up in it and suffered severe injuries as they struggled to escape. Leg wounds suffered by horses often failed to heal or became infected, and the animals would have to be shot."
