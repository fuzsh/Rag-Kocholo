        "text": "Horse Soldier Bourbon comes from the American Freedom Distillery, located in St. Petersberg, Florida. Founded by veterans, the Florida location is where they make rum and other spirits. The bourbon is distilled in Ohio in conjunction with Middle West Spirits. The mission statement and inspiration for the distillery is “Legendary men, legendary spirits.”\n\nThe name “Horse Soldier” was a term used in Afghanistan after the attacks of 9/11. The USA responded with the insertion of small teams of Green Berets into northern Afghanistan. The Northern Alliance successfully overthrew Mazar-i-Sharif, a Taliban stronghold, with the support of these brave men. This region’s inhospitable, mountainous terrain made efforts and enemy engagements on wild Afghan horses a necessity for one Special Operations team (ODA595). Nicknamed the “Horse Soldiers”, all these brave men are honored today by America’s Response Monument overlooking “Ground Zero” in New York City."
