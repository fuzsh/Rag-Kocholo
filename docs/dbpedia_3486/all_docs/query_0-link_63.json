Plus, regardless of how the weather goes, you know Swing’n’Country will be here for you All Winter Long and on into Spring!\n\nThere are many good songs for winter listening scattered throughout the show, from Glen Campbell, Kathy Mattea, Mickey Gilley, The Maddox Brothers and Rose, Buck Owens, and Connie Francis, to drop a few names. We begin with Merle Haggard's \"Big City\" and \"Hard Workin’ Woman\" from Cascade Sweethearts. Three hours later The Hot Club of Cowtown is on a \"Slow Boat to China\" and Dolly Parton explains why \"I Will Forever Hate Roses\" from her 2008 album Backwoods Barbie.\n\nKeep warm but be cool, and please join me for this week’s program on KBOO 90.7 fm. Thanks. Will"
