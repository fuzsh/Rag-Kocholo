The Horse Soldier is a family owned and operated antique store located in Gettysburg, PA. We specialize in Military Antiques with items dating from the American Revolution to World War II. Our strongest emphasis is on the American Civil War.

We have been involved in the trade since 1971 and issued some of the finest militaria print catalogs through 2003, when we established our internet presence with an extensive online catalog. We have many items for sale not listed here, so call (717-334-0347), fax (717-334-5016) or e-mail (info@horsesoldier) if you're looking for an item that you don't see here.
