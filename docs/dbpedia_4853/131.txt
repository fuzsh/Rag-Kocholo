As the world’s premier rugby event launches a much-anticipated return on 4th November after a 3-year hiatus Kukri Sports are delighted to continue in our 17th year as sponsor and official merchandise supplier.

The Cathay Pacific / HSBC Hong Kong Sevens is one of the most popular sporting events in Asia and attracts some of the world’s top rugby players and thousands of fans from around the globe to watch intense, fast paced rugby action in a carnival atmosphere at the famous Hong Kong Stadium.

The three-day event takes place from 4th – 6th November when 16 teams are set to compete on rugby’s greatest stage.

As well as supplying the official Hong Kong Sevens merchandise range, Kukri Sports are also official supplier to the Hong Kong Rugby Union teams across men’s, women, and national age grade teams.

This year we have produced a fashion forward range of leisure wear and accessories for every age of rugby fan including T-shirts, hoodies, and polo shirts, enabling everyone to take home a piece of history from the 2022 event, as well as a full range of replica home and away shirts for men, women, and kids.

As we move towards a more sustainable future, we have introduced the option of replica shirts made from recycled fabric giving the #HK7’s rugby fans a wider range to choose from and the chance to be part of the sustainable sportswear revolution.

Our online store is now open for you to purchase your merchandise ahead of the tournament or buy your memento at the event itself from one of the stalls located in the stadium.

Get a piece of history from the 2022 #HK7’s while stocks last and get ready for another truly memorable 3-day carnival of rugby.
