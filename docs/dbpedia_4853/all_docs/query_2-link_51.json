In his spare time, Kun likes reading and playing table tennis.\n\nWon Il Park\n\nVisiting professor (2013-2015)\n\nCurrent position: Professor, Hanyang University, South Korea\n\nWon Il Park received his B.S. degree (2000) from Materials Science and Engineering at Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, and his Ph.D. degree in Materials Science and Engineering from POSTECH in 2005. He then spent 2 years as a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Charles M. Lieber’s group at Harvard University. He started as an assistant professor of Materials Science and Engineering in March 2007 at Hanyang University Seoul, Korea. Currently he is an associate professor at the same university and leading ‘Nano Electronic and Photonic Laboratory’. As a visiting researcher in the Tian lab, he aims to explore the materials science interface between biological and physical systems, with a focus on the synthetic cellular interactions with nanoelectronics and the development of biomimetic nanoscale materials and devices.\n\nMichal Cifra\n\nVisiting professor (2014-2015)\n\nCurrent position: Professor, Institute of Photonics and Electronics, Czech Academy of Sciences\n\nDr. Cifra obtained his MSc. degree (2006) from Biomedical Engineering at the University of Zilina, Slovakia, and his Ph.D. degree (2009) from Radioelectronics, Czech Technical University in Prague. His postdoc project at the Institute of Photonics and Electronics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech republic, was focused on the research of cellular electrodynamics on the nanoscale. Currently he is a head of a newly established Bioelectrodynamics research team at the same institute. Michal is passionate about the research of biological endogenous electrodynamic and electronic phenomena and his current main interests are in microtubules, ultraweak photon emission and nanosensors. Dr. Cifra worked as a visiting researcher in Tian’s lab from August 2014-2015, where he explored the interaction of tubulin and microtubules with functionalized synthetic silicon nanostructures as potential probes of subcellular electrodynamics.\n\nFormer undergraduate students\n\nJj Abu-Halimah\n\nUndergraduate student\n\nJJ is an undergraduate student from Tennessee majoring in biochemistry on a pre-med track.
