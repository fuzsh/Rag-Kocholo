A Poland Under-23 international, he was brought in to fill the void left by Rory Fallon, who had left to join Plymouth. He made his debut as a substitute in a 2-0 win over Gillingham and scored his only goal for the Swans in a 2-1 victory at Rotherham in Roberto Martinez’s first game in charge. Abbott featured in the side that narrowly missed out on a place in the play-offs at the end of the 2006-07 season, before departing during the summer for Darlington after 18 appearances (nine as sub) and one goal. He went on to sign for Darlington, Oldham, Charlton and Polish clubs Ruch Chorzów and Zawisza Bydgoszcz.\n\nPETER ABBOTT\n\nStriker Peter Abbott was a member of Harry Gregg's squad at Swansea City. A former Manchester United apprentice, he turned professional in October 1970 but failed to secure a first-team slot and moved to the Vetch Field initially on loan in February 1974. He made his League debut in that month's 3-0 win at home to Stockport and netted three goals in 41 Fourth Division games for Swansea prior to joining Hartford Bi-Centennials in May 1976. Reuniting with Harry Gregg at Crewe Alexandra in August 1976, he joined Southend United in July 1977 and was a promotion winner in 1977-78, then returned to the United States.\n\nTAMMY ABRAHAM\n\nA tall, gangly striker, Abraham spent the 2017-18 season on loan with the Swans from parent club Chelsea. After a promising start to the campaign, Tammy and the team struggled, and he ended up with just five goals as the Swans were relegated from the Premier League. After leaving the Swans, the England international spent a season on loan at Aston Villa where he found his goalscoring form again to help the club secure promotion to the Premier League with a play-off victory over Derby County at Wembley. He has since gone on to make his mark in the Premier League with Chelsea, where he was an academy graduate; making two first-team appearances in 2016 before a successful loan move to Bristol City.\n\nREUBEN AGBOOLA\n\nVersatile left-back Reuben Agboola gained Nigerian international recognition whilst at Swansea City.

After suffering a horrific car crash in 2002 that saw him break his neck, the defender recovered well to continue his football career. Unfortunately, he didn’t really suit the style of then boss Kenny Jackett and he was eventually released by Roberto Martinez, going on to sign for Swindon Town after 29 appearances (six as sub).\n\nJORDI AMAT\n\nBarcelona-born centre back Jordi Amat joined the Swans after our League Cup winning campaign.
