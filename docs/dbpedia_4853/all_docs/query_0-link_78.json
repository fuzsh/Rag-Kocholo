        "text": "The Olympic Games Paris 2024 are happening this year!\n\nTaking place from 26 July to 11 August, more than 10,000 of the best athletes in the world will gather in the French capital for the four-yearly festival of sport.\n\nBut you don't have to wait until the Olympic Games to follow your favorite athletes.\n\nAll around the world, dozens of global events will offer world titles and Olympic quota spots during the six first months of 2024, giving sports enthusiasts a taste of what's to come at the XXXIII Olympiad.\n\nOlympics.com has therefore collated the main global sport events, some of which are crucial in the qualification process to Paris 2024, so you don't miss out on the pre-Games drama.\n\nIn this article, 'direct quotas' are the berths obtained by a National Olympic Committee (NOC) or under the name of an athlete in certain sports. NOCs have the exclusive authority for the representation of their respective countries at the Olympic Games, as athletes' participation at the Paris Games depends on their NOC selecting them to represent their delegation at Paris 2024.\n\nAlso taken into account are the competitions that give athletes points toward their Olympic rankings, and the ones in which the Olympic standards are crucial in the qualification process, including athletics and swimming."
