        "text": "Founded in 1908 through the merger of SK Veleslavín and Dynamo Vokovice, SK ARITMA Praha is a Czech football club based in Prague. The club currently plays in the Czech Fourth Division.\n\nOne of its most famous players was Jiří Tichý. A central defender, he entered the Czech Football Hall of Fame as part of the silver team from the World Championships in Chile.\n\nThe club also offers tennis, basketball, athletics, and volleyball facilities.\n\nThe challenge\n\nARITMA Praha needed to replace its lighting as it was old, costly to run, unreliable, and needed a great deal of expensive maintenance. The lighting levels the old system was providing also failed to meet what was required for the league competitions played there.\n\nThe new lighting solution needed would have to be able to dim lights smoothly whilst maintaining uniformity for the training pitches too.\n\nOther challenges we faced were:\n\nThe project was taking place in January, so we had to work in sub-zero conditions – where the daily temperature only ever rose to -10ᵒC. We also had to contend with strong winds and lots of snow. Not ideal if you’re working on high masts.\n\nThe wireless controls for dimming each pitch all needed to run from one mobile device.\n\nWe had to provide a retrofit solution as there was no budget for new masts.\n\nThe project needed to be delivered at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOur solution\n\nAs this needed to be a retrofit project, the first task was for our Lighting Design and Engineering teams to assess what masting was already there and how it could be used. Armed with this they then started to produce several potential layouts for the lighting using different types of our luminaires.\n\nThey decided our Modus R Series would be the perfect choice. Thanks to its low weight and the fact we could add ballast to the base of the masts, it meant the load on the mast booms was significantly reduced. Its modular design and its versatile control systems also meant it could provide the right amount of light exactly where, and when, it was needed using just one mobile control.\n\nYou’ll see from the technical ‘before and after’ comparison, also below, the energy savings were significant – almost 50%. This both reduced the daily running cost of the lighting and helped the club boost its environmental credentials.\n\nAs for completing the project during such bad weather conditions, as a global lighting company, we’re well used to operating in all extreme types of weather – hot and cold. So we know what safety measures need to be adhered to. Likewise for delivering the job during the COVID-19 pandemic. We’d already completed a large number of projects since the pandemic began and understood exactly what protocols were required to keep everyone safe."
