        "text": "What was it like to intern at Deloitte?\n\nI enjoyed my time very much as there was a good balance between work and play. Outside of work, I also bonded with my colleagues over lunch and dinner, which left me with many fond memories.\n\nWhat are your key takeaways from your internship?\n\nI have gained a lot of exposure in various aspects of Marketing & Communications, from events planning, to drafting communications for internal newsletters and external publications like this Decisions magazine. I also had the opportunity to try my hand at social media content marketing.\n\nI believe that having good time management skills is important in order to be able to juggle my assigned projects effectively. In addition, being committed to go the extra mile to help a colleague out at work would also benefit everyone on the team.\n\nWhich has been your favourite competition?\n\nIt would have to be the Hong Kong Series Competition as it took place in the middle of a nature park and all the competitors were incredibly friendly. It was great to take that few days off school to travel and catch up with my friends from around the world after the competition.\n\nWhat did you like most about Deloitte?\n\nI love being part of a cohesive and enjoyable Marketing & Communications team that feels like a mini family to me. It has been a privilege to meet everyone and getting to know each of them individually. They have truly made my internship experience even more special.\n\nWhat are some of the highlights of your internship experience?\n\nHelping to write some of the articles that got featured in Decisions magazine was definitely one of the key highlights of my internship. I also enjoyed supporting the events team in their preparations for the Year-End Party 2018 held at Zouk Singapore, as well as planning and executing the “Hello 2019!” event whereby our people received croissants and coffee as a welcome gift on their first day back to work in the New Year.\n\nDecision Magazine Issue 13\n\nIn issue 13, Czech out our Deloitte Singapore football teams – they competed in the 16th inter-Deloitte football tournament in Prague!
