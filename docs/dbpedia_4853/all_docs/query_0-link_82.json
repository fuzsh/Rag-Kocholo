Introduction The British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) has been in continuous existence, under various guises, since its inception on 1 October 1909. Originally it was designated the Foreign Section of the Secret Service Bureau, but during the First World War it adopted the military intelligence cover of MI I{c). Thereafter it became known as MI6, and that title has stuck, albeit unofficially, to the present day. To insiders it has always been known as 'the fiml' or, by the less respectful, 'the racket'. In more recent years initiated outsiders, mostly Foreign Office regulars and business contacts, have referred to the organization simply as 'the Friends'. This popular euphemism has extended to SIS's advice, which is often described as having come 'from friendly circles'. Today, as before?the Second World War, it is officially denied that SIS has a peacetime existence. Of course, this subterfuge fools no one, but it does enable government ministers to avoid awkward Parliamentary Questions and allow British Foreign Service officers to disavow the organization which, by its intrinsic nature, is distinctly undiplomatic and is not infrequently the cause of an embarrassing nunpus. In short, although the ruse of SIS's lack of acknowledgement appears a trifle anachronistic, while the initials of its Amer- icanand Soviet counterparts, the CIA and the KGB, are universally recognized, it does serve a practical purpose. Because SIS has no offidal peacetime existence it follows that there are, therefore, no documents or records to be placed in the Public Records Office, as is required by law of most government departments. And since there are no files, none can be declassified after the elapse of the appropriate period of time. Indeed, almost the only SIS documents ever known to have slipped past the ever-vigilant 'weeders', who scrutinize everything before it is shipped to the Public Records Office at Kew, is a batch of pre-war administrative Eiles relating to the Passport Control Office.l This now defunct department operated for several decades as SIS's main cover, thus allowing intelligence officers to be posted abroad as Passport Control Officers. Clearly the deception, although well known to Britain s enemies, was sufficiently effective to distract at least one of the ubiquitous 'weeders'. ?

In contrast, no less than eight former members have produced accounts of their work in the Security Service. Sir John Mastennan, Sir Percy Sillitoe, Derek Tangye, Lord Rothschild, Stephen Watts and, most recently, Peter Wright have all had their autobiographies published.Z Sir Gerald Glover even had his printed privately,' while the late Jack Morton's recollections on a career that continued until 1971 is still in manuscript form. The Cabinet Office has also officially allowed another MI5 officer, Anthony Simkins, who was Deputy Director-General between 1965 and 1971, to have his collaboration in the preparation of the final volume of British Intelligence in the Second World War4 acknowledged. He was also commissioned, with Pro- fessor Sir Harry Hinsley, to compile Security and Counter-Intelligence,5 a wartime history of the Security Service. SIS, on the other hand, is rather more strict in its approach to this sensitive issue, and the amount of printed material available from those with First-hand experience of SIS's operations is sufficiently limited to be listed here in full. The first person to make the attempt was (Sir) Compton Mackenzie, who tried to give a highly detailed account of his experiences of his tour of duty for MII(c) in the Eastern Mediterranean during the First World War. All copies of Greek Memories? were seized on publication day and the author was convicted of breaching the Official Secrets Act. He was fined ?100 with f100 costs, no mean figure in 1931, and all the books were ordered to be destroyed. Only a few valuable first editions survive, including one in the British Library which still cannot be read without MI5's permission! Two years later another MI1(c) veteran, Captain Henry Landau, avoided a similar prosecution by releasing All's Fair, the first of his three volumes of memoirs, in New York They were never brought out in England and, as the author was a South African living in America, there was little the British authorities could do to prevent him. During the post-war era only a handful of reminiscences have got through the net. The first to break ranks was Leslie Nicholson, who had long since retired from SIS and in 1966, persuaded a New York publisher to issue British Agent. As a precaution Nicholson concealed his identity under the pseudonym John Whitwell. Having already emigrated to America, like Landau, the author kept out of the jurisdiction of the British courts and thus escaped being prosecuted or injuncted. When an edition was published the following year in London, the Government, presented with a fait accompli, took no action. It had also received advance warning that Kim Philby, having defected to Moscow four years earlier, had held an auction for the rights to My Silent War. Once again, no attempt was made to prevent publication in England. ?

V. Jones, SIS's wartime scientific adviser who produced Most Secret War in 1978. Similar defiance was demonstrated by Philip Johns, another emigrant to the United States who in 1979 wrote Within Two Cloaks, his recollections as SIS's Head of Station in wartime Lisbon. Passing reference to their wartime service in SIS has been made by literary figures like Somerset Maugham, Graham Greene, Malcolm Muggeridge, A. J. Ayer and Hugh Trevor Roper, but none have risked going into matters in any depth. Other books by retired SIS officers with a peacetime contribution behind them, such as Nigel Clive, John Bruce Lockhart and David Cornwell (rather better known by his nom de plume John le Came), have discreetly omitted mention of anything other than their cover roles as regular diplomats from their autobiographical details. When Charles Ransom joined the team of Professor Hinsley's academics preparing the offiaal history of British intelligence for the Cabinet Office, his twenty-year career in SIS was referred to simply as having been'in the Foreign Service, 1946--66'; in fact, he had joined the Friends in 1946 and had served abroad only once, heading the Rome Station from 1958 to 1961. The unique exception is Monty Woodhouse, who succeeded in writing Something Ventured without official interference. This Fascinating book describes his activities as SIS's Head of Station in Tehran and his efforts to have Dr Mussadeq removed from power, after which he left the Friends and was elected the Conservative Member of Parliament for Oxford. More recently, two others, Anthony Cavendish, who was based in Germany after the wAr, and Desmond Bristow, latterly SIS's Head of Station in Madrid, have received stem warnings to discourage them from putting pen to paper. Daunting legal obstacles were placed in the path of the formers Inside /ntel- ligence, so the author chose to have his book printed and distributed privately. Bristow has yet to complete his project. The Friends are determined to prevent those seeking to capitalize on their secret careers and, when compared to the Security Service, have been quite effective in discouraging disclosures. Because of its structure of watertight compartments and the strict use of the 'need to know' rule, only a handful of senior SIS officers have ever been in a position to give anything like a comprehensive overview of its operations, even though the organization is itself, in number, a tiny fraction of the CIA, the KGB or even the French DGSE.

Only a few over-embroidered books have been published, the most recent being Break-In by Bill Graham,' the story of a contractor and part- time SIS agent who spent two years inside the Soviet trade delegation in London Fitting double-glazed windows while simultaneously accumulating useful order-of-battle data about Soviet personnel. Freelancers like Graham, hired for one-off operations, can only give a small snapshot of the organization and are never allowed to gain enough information to paint a complete picture. Where information can be traced directly to a particular insider, the Crown has the choice of wielding some awesome weapons: a criminal prosecution under the Official Secrets Act, which governments sometimes find politically uncomfortable, or the civil remedy of bringing a suit alleging breach of confidence. Unlike the Official Secrets altemative, the latter can be undertaken virtually anywhere and can be prohibitively costly to defend. Both merits were demonstrated recently in the Australian courts when the British Government tried to suppress the publication of Peter Wright's illicit memoirs, Spycatcher. That particular controversy achieved two unexpected goals, one foe either side. The Defence got aworld-wide bestseller, but the Plaintiffs showed the lengths they were prepared to go, regardless of cost or unpopularity, to impose silence on the Crown`s secret servants. The introduction of a publications review board along the lines operated by the CIA and FBI seems an attractive altemative to the present system for all concemed (apart from the lawyers), be they taxpayer, historians, frustrated memoirists or even those directly concemed with maintaining the nation's security. However, not even the most optimistic members of the intelligence establishment anticipate such an event for some years. One consequence is that histories like this one are bound to be incomplete, quite apart Erom the excisions made voluntarily after requests from 'the relevant authorities'. This account is not intended as a work of disclosure in the sense that the pages are filled with revelations of appalling wrong-doing, although some episodes, such as the ruthless sabotage campaign conducted by Harold Perkins from SIS's Rome Station against the Palestinian refugee ships in 1946, are hard to justify. Nor is it a whitewash. It is instead intended to be a factual account of Britain s efforts in the field of secret intelligence during the decades following the end of the war. No names of living agents are compromised and no secret sources in current use placed in jeopardy. But it is a nuts-and- bolts description of how the country's overseas, clandestine intelligence- gathering arm made the transformation from Empire to membership of the EEC. The question most frequently posed nowadays in this context is whether, post-Empire, and with a vast signals intelligence capability employing many thousands, Britain really needs a Secret Intelligence Service.

USE ONL follow it will become evident that successive governments of both persuasions have found SIS's arcane skills indispensable. Certainly, Ernest Bevin and Anthony Eden made heavy and persistent calls on the organization's resources. But is there still a requirement? The invasion of the Falklands in I98Z is surely eloquent testimony of a continuing necessity to acquire, collate and distribute, in a timely manner, secret information to the right quarters. As had previously been demonstrated at Pearl Harbor in 1941 (more than a decade and a half before the creation of the CIA), there had been plenty to indicate an impending attack if only there had been a properly responsive mechanism to interpret the signs. The shortcomings of Whitehall's modem intelligence structure were subsequently investigated by Lord Franks, whose rport? recommended significant improvements in the chain linking a covert source to the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (who, in turn, passes his staff's considered advice to his political masters), but did not suggest dramatic changes in SIS's role. Lord Franks's criticisms centred on what was perceived as a poor per- formance by the JIC's Assessments Staff when dealing with 'an area of low priority' like the Falklands before the Argentine invasion. In that instance SIS's advice never filtered up beyond the Latin America Central Intelligence Group, the conduit for drawing the JIC's attention to particular issues at its regular meeting in the Cabinet Office every Wednesday morning. This was one of the 'defects in the Joint Intelligence machinery' that was subsequently corrected by breaking the tradition requiring the JIC Chaimlan to be appointed from the Foreign Office. The Falklands intelligence lapse confirmed Peter Hennessy's truism that 'the shortcomings of the JIC and the secret agencies tend only to be exposed after the kind of failure they exist to prevent :' What made the Franks Report so remarkable was not just the fact that it went 'considerably further than any disclosures at the end of the statutory thirty years in the amount of intelligence material displayed',10 but that so much of it was released for public consump- tion. Previous post mortems on intelligence mistakes, like the complete absence of any secret intelligence during the Omani Campaign during the late 1960s, have ~ never been published. Indeed, Sir Edward Bridges's enquiry into the Buster Crabb affair in 1956 has never even been admitted as actually having taken place! The increased availability in recent years of previously classified documents, most notably in the United States, has done much to reveal the extent to which vital foreign policy decisions have been influenced by secret intelligence. Some have exposed the scale of covert operations mounted by administrations that only gave consent to them on the basis that the failures could be repudiated. Thus Dement Attlee's Government authorized a deadly counter- Approved For R~1~~$e 200 ~~RLCI~I~~P~~~'11728000100060001-5 Approved For Release 2005/08J,~4:CIA-RDP96B01172R000100060001-5 CIR INTERNAL USE ONLY terrorist action in Palestine and perpetuated what added up to a virtual guerrilla war in the Ukraine. Similarly, Eden made astonishing demands on SIS in the run-up to Suez. As we shall see, SIS not only masterminded the Anglo-French adventure in the first place, but later conveyed the devastating news that the Soviets intended to intervene, thus fuming a well stage-managed plot into a fiasco that wrecked the careers of both (Sir) Patrick Dean (then Chairman of the JIC) and Michael Williams (SIS's Foreign Office Adviser), to say nothing of Eden himself. It is SIS's task to pursue policy objectives by unorthodox means and to amass useful information from secret (and open) sources. The operation that goes wrong is an occupational hazard, although it is only accepted as such by politicians with reluctance. Usually both the triumphs and the disasters are kept under wraps. The infiltration of well-equipped partisan groups into the Soviet Union from the Baltic, and the joint Anglo-American sponsored attempt to undermine Enver Hoxha's regime in Albania, must be counted as failures. So should SIS's embarrassing endeavour to place a frogman under the Ord- zhonikidze during Nikita IChrushchev's goodwill visit in 1956. All were to have profound effects on 'the firm'. Yet there were also the achievements -the skilful management of Soviet defectors like Colonel Penkovsky and Oleg Gordievsky; the brilliant 'technical coverage' of Soviet diplomatic premises during the late 1960s; the elimination of Mussadeq and the manipulation of Greek policy towards Cyprus during the Emergency in 1955. Indeed, Britain's painful transition from a colonial power to a European leader with just nine possessions left scattered around the world might have been a lot more fraught without the rearguard intelligence battles won behind the scenes. Finally, for those who may have reservations about the advisability of telling this story, the reader is reminded that another routine danger of collecting intelligence is every agency's inevitable susceptibility to hostile penetration. All realistic case officers now recognize that dealing with emigre groups is, at best, a chancy affair. At one time they were considered excellent sources of information about their homeland and useful pools from which to recruit agents and foment subversion. Unfortunately, experience has shown that most Eastern Bloc emigre organizations have been hopelessly compro- mised, if not actually n,rn directly from Moscow. Nor has SIS been immune to the phenomenon of the mole, the ideollogically motivated convert to the opposition's cause. Both Philby and George Blake confessed to having betrayed every secret that ever passed over their desks, which means that what the KGB did not know about SIS during their periods of employment was probably not worth knowing. Nor did the damage stop when Blake was arrested in April I96I or when Philby vanished from Beirut in January 1963. There is plenty of evidence to show that after their respective escapes, both ?

Transition 'Deception has undeniably a part to play in diplomacy. In connection with gathering the intelligence on which to base a sound policy it is often essential, just as it is in war. But certain rules apply. It must be used selectively or it can become a bad habit' Geoffrey McDermott, The Eden Legacy' At the end of the war in Europe, the British intelligence community consisted of numerous separate organizations exercising either a security or an intelligence function, or a combination of both. Some, like Colin Gubbins's Special Oper- ationsExecutive (SOE), Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart's Political Warfare Executive (which co-ordinated psychological and propaganda operations) and Lord Sel- bome's Ministry of Economic Warfare, had no expectation of a peacetime existence. Their usefulness was judged to have come to an end, and they were to be dismantled and their personnel demobbed. SOE's task had been to foment resistance inside enemy-occupied territory and, at the conclusion of hostilities, had in theory at least, worked itself out of a job. Its very success had made it redundant. There was, nevertheless, a core of units which were destined to survive: the Secret Intelligence Service, otherwise known as MI6, and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which, at this point, was still under the departmental control of MI6's Chief, known by convention as the CSS, Chief of the Secret Service; the Security Service, more widely referred to by its cover military intelligence designation of MI5, under the leadership of its Director-General, Sir David Petrie; and the three service intelligence departments of the Air Ministry, the War Office and the Naval Intelligence Division (NID). One of the difficulties Eaced by the CSS, Sir Stewart Menzies, upon the German surrender in 1945 was the new administration's interest in returning people to their avilian occupations. During the previous five years, special Approved For Risl~a e'2~oT5T~812R~Cl~l~~P96B01172R000100060001-5 Approved For RC I R e I NTERNRL USE P~NLT 1728000100060001-5 ~ ~ The Friends arcane skills had been acquired in such diverse areas as irregular operations and psychological warfare. Menzies was anxious to retain a capability to conduct the former, while the Foreign Office recognized a continuing need for the latter. Accordingly, key officers from SOE, such as Robin Brook and Dickie Franks, were persuaded to join SIS and continue their clandestine interests. It was not until 1947, after the Political Warfare Executive had been dismembered, that its value was realized belatedly; the Government, therefore, reconstituted it as the Information Research Department (IRD) of the Foreign Office. Before embarking on a description of SIS's transition from peace to war, it might be as well to examine the scope of the three principal British intelligence machines which were themselves then under study, at Winston Churchill's request, by Sir Findlater Stewart, formerly the Chairman of the recently disbanded Home Defence Executive. Stewart's secret report, dated 27 November 1945, has never been published, but it was essentially a com- prehensive survey of British intelligence with recommendations,' based on evidence submitted by both Menzies and Petrie, for Britain's future intelligence requirements. By the time Stewart had completed his deliberations, Churchill had been replaced as Prime Minister by Clement Attlee; but the Cabinet Secretary was still Sir Edward Bridges, and it was to him that Stewart's report was delivered. In short, it favoured MI6's continued, covert life, with an added, limited capacity to undertake clandestine SOE-style operations. The time- honoured, parallel system, which had so neatly divided the nation's intelligence and security responsibilities since 1909 between MI5 within the Empire and SIS elsewhere in the world, was endorsed, although Stewart apparently suggested the construction of a combined headquarters in London so as to avoid wasteful duplication. At the time, SIS was still occupying its huge offices at 54 Broadway, in Victoria, and MI5 had transfenred from St James's Street to the recently vacated Headquarters London District in Curzon Street. The idea of combining the two was later dropped, although a convenient location - the site of some old gasometers in Horsefery Road -was earmarked for the stillborn project. Upon the advent of peace, or at least a cold war, SIS settled down to coping with two challenges: the threat to European independence posed by Josef Stalin and the Soviet Union, and the organization's own unwieldy structure. The war with Germany over, SIS now anticipated a period of struggle to contain Soviet territorial and political ambitions. The collective brainpower of its intellectuals - A. J. Ayer, Hugh Seton-Watson, Robert Carew-Hunt and David Footman - predicted a potential threat of global conflict from the Comintem's ideological successor, the Cominform. In their work can be found the recognition of the unpalatable fact that, whatever the cost of the recent Approved For F~el~~sei~~`~LCI~~P98B'011728000100060001-5 ? ? ? Approved For RC I R e I NTERNRL USE ON~~ 172R000100060001-5 ? war, Moscow was just as committed as ever to world revolution. for example, in 1944 Footman, a distinguished novelist,2 had published Red Prelude, a biography of Andrei Zhelyabov and the first of several scholarly books on Russian revolutionary history. Two years later, in The Primrose PaEh, he documented the life of Ferdinand Lasalle, founder of the German Labour Movement and a powerful influence on Marx and Engels. Footman was to comment that Marx had, he felt, discovered the scientific laws of historical development which made (world revolutions inevitable. The question was when it was going to happen. But the final and happy state of affairs that was to follow on after the proletarian revolution was so desirable that it was obviously one's duty to hung on the revolution by every possible means.' Footman's critical analysis was in line with Seton-Watson, who left SIS in 1946 to return to academic life at Oxford. He later wrote Neither War Nor Peace, The East European Revolution and The Pattern of Communist Resolution, each a study of the malign influence of totalitarianism. Carew-Hunt sub- sequently wrote Marxism Past and Present and The Theory and Practice of Communism, a textbook on modern Marxist philosophy which promised that 'the entire fabric of society is to be fumed upside down'.? However, in the first uncertain months of peace, SIS's intelligence bureau- crats were mainly preoccupied by matters of internal politics. That 'the firm' would contract at the conclusion of hostilities was to be expected. Most SIS members were only too anxious to get back to civilian life, where many had jobs waiting. SIS's greatest wartime expansion had taken place within Section V, aself-contained counter-intelligence adjunct whose sole function was the assessment and exploitation of intercepted Axis wireless signals. Since 1940, more than 450 specialists had been drafted into Section V, the London base of which was housed in Ryder Street, but the collapse of the Nazi regime had terminated their mission. As the Sicherheitsdienst's radio stations went off the air, and once the much vaunted 'Werewolf' guerrilla movement was evidently not. going to materialize, there was little reason for Section V to continue its operations. The head of Section V, Felix Cowgill, certainly saw the writing on the wall and took up anon-intelligence job with the military government in Munchen-Gladbach. The rest of the service prepared itself for a structural reorganization which would reflect the change in priorities brought about by peace. SIS's Broadway headquarters was essentially split into two halves: the SIS stations which were scattered around the globe and accommodated under diplomatic or military cover in missions overseas, and the ten 'consumer' headquarters sections. In brief, the individual stations gathered information Approved For F~I~~'se'20031'OS/24~CI~~P9'S6'0'1172R000100060001-5 Approved For Release 2005/08/24 :CIA-RDP96B01172R000100060001-5 CIA INTERNAL USE ONLY ~ 2 The Friends which the London sections collated, analysed and then distributed to the right quarters. Each section had a special responsibility for liaising with SIS's clients, the external services and government departments in need of a supply of secret intelligence. Thus Section I handled political matters, II the military, III the Royal Navy, I V the Air Ministry, Vcounter-intelligence, V I economic, VII financial, IX Soviet and X the press. Section VIII dealt with SIS's complex communications and provided a link with GCHQ. The hierarchy at Broadway was headed by the CSS, Sir Stewart Menzies, who had his own small department consisting of his Staff Officer (known as the CSO/CSS), Peter Koch de Gooreynd, who liaised with the Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Intelligence Committee, and his Foreign Office Adviser, Robert Cecil. Menzies had three Deputy Directors, each nominated by their respective services: John Cordeaux for the nary, Air Commodore Lionel Payne for the Air Ministry and Major-General William Beddington for the army. In addition, he had both aVice-Chief, Major-General John Sinclair, and a Deputy Chief, Air Commodore (Sir) James Easton. Cordeaux had reached the rank of lieutenant- colonel in the Royal Marines before his posting to naval intelligence in 1938, and had switched to SIS in 1942. 'Lousy' Payne, who had won the Air Force Cross in 1919, when he was twenty-five, was soon to leave SIS to become the air correspondent of the Daily Telegraph. Beddington, anEton- and Oxford- educated veteran of the First World War who had seen action at Gallipoli, was to retire to his country home in Northamptonshire in 1947 and devote himself to hunting foxes. 'Sinbad' Sinclair, a cricket enthusiast who had started his career in the navy, had come into SIS early in 1945 after just a year as the Director of Military Intelligence at the War Office; he was to be appointed Menzies's successor in I95Z. Easton remained in SIS until 1958, when he was knighted and given a regular diplomatic post abroad. During the summer of 1945, Menzies appointed six prominent SIS per- sonalities, under the chairmanship of Maurice Jeffes, to review the organization and recommend changes which would make 'the firm' more responsive to the needs of peacetime intelligence-gathering. Jeffes had been in SIS since 1919 and had served as Head of Station in both Paris and New York The other committee members were Christopher Amold- Forster, Captain Edward Hastings RN, David Footman, John Cordeaux and Kim Philby. Arnold-Forster, the SIS Chief Staff Officer, was shortly to take up his pre-war occupation of stockbroking in the City. Hastings, the CSS's personal representative at GCHQ, had spent much of the war at Bletchley Park masterminding the administration of the signals intelligence product codenamed ULTRA. This was to be his last significant contribution to SIS before his well-earned retirement to his Sussex estate in 1949. Footman, the ?

Cordeaux was briefly to succeed Arnold-Forster as CSO, before leaving SIS in 1946. He unsuccessfully con- tested the Bolsover constituency for the Conservatives in 1950 and 1951, but was eventually elected to Parliament in 1955 as the MP for Nottingham Central. Philby, the wartime recruit from SOE, had excelled in counter- intelligence work and, late the previous year, had been entrusted with the development of the new, anti-Soviet unit, Section IX. The Committee's sec- retary was Alurid Denne. Together these seven officers thrashed out a new, streamlined, internal order of battle, with 'R' and 'P', requirements and production, sections super- seding the old arrangements. The first would assess the demand Eor particular types of information in certain fields, leaving it to the production staff to acquire it. Section V, the counter-intelligence unit, was abolished along with Section IX, and RS became exclusively Soviet-orientated, absorbing an area that had previously been Section IX's parish. This particular recommendation had been initiated by Philby, who, of course, had his own motives, as he later admitted in his autobiography. His sole interest had been in 'keeping, for the time being at any rate, the whole field oEsnti-Soviet and anti-communist work under my own direct supervision' s RS liaised with the codebreaker at GCHQ and R9 embraced all scientific intelligence. The committee's lengthy report on reorganization suggested a simplified structure of five directorates: finance and administration, production, require- ments, training and development, and war planning. The CSS accepted much of the report and appointed Frank Slocum as his Director of Administration. Slocum had joined SIS from the Royal Naval Tactical School in 1937 and was to remain at Broadway until 1954, when he was posted abroad as Head of Station in Oslo. The new Director of Production (known simply by the abbreviation DP) was Kenneth Cohen, an old SIS hand who once claimed to have been the only Jew in the Royal Navy. He had joined SIS in 1935 and subsequently had headed the Vichy French country section. The Director of Training and Development was John Munn, formerly the commandant of SOE's training school at Beaulieu in Hampshire. His new department was established in Princes House, Princes Street, close to Oxford Circus, with additional facilities at Fort Monckton, Gosport. Subordinate to the post of DP were three Controller, who each looked after the stations in their individual geographical regions. Thus Simon Galienne, as Controller Western Area, handled France, Spain and North Africa. In converation and internal correspondence he was simply refen ed to by the initials CWA.

Between the Controllers and the stations was a second management tier of Production or 'P Officers'. Each P Officer supervised SIS's activities in two or three countries. Thus the P3, Peter Lunn, son of the veteran skier Arnold Lunn, supervised SIS operations in Austria and Germany, reporting to his immediate superior, the CEA.

From there it was the task of the requirements section to circulate information to its numerous clients, including the Joint Intelligence Committee and a newly created body, the Joint Intelligence Bureau (jIB). Late in 1945 the JIC's wartime Chairman, Victor ('Bill') Cavendish-Bentinck,? was appointed Ambassador to Warsaw and Harold (now Lord) Caccia took over the reins. The JIB was headed by Major-General Kenneth Strong, himself swell-established intelligence officer who had served as Eisenhower's intelligence chief at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). The JIB was intended to be the country's first attempt to integrate the handling and analysis of all types of intelligence, and Strong gathered an impressive quantity of skilled analysts from the services to launch it. He later said that 'the formation of the Bureau represented the first attempt at the unified handling and objective analysis of intelligence needed by more than one government department and a first step towards the integration of intelligence'.' Although he admitted that 'none of my friends thought that the Bureau would last longer than six months', the organization was to remain in existence until 1963, when it was swallowed up by the Defence Intelligence Staff at the Ministry of Defence. It was SIS's task to supply sufficient secret intelligence for the JIB staff to prepare their own assessments. Much of this material was to come from agents run by SIS's global network of stations. The stations themselves, consisting of a Head of Station, up to a dozen assistants and a small secretarial staff, provided coverage throughout the world. The tasks of a particular station could range from providing illicit support to a regime, carrying out reconnaissance missions in a neighbouring state, recruiting agents to penetrate a hostile target, or preparing local stay-behind resistance cells in anticipation of an invasion. Every station had a different set of priorities decided by the relevant Controller. In a typical station, such as Ankara, the Head of Station would be accredited at the relevant embassy, legation or consulate as a First or Second Secretary and would act as a link with the local authorities, from whom he might occasionally extract 'UA', the abbreviation for unofficial assistance. His role, of course, would be well known among the rest of the diplomatic mission and even the expatriate community, which were required to exercise discretion. The thorny problem of suitable concealment for professional intelligence officers, which had so dogged SIS before the war when the Foreign Office's Passport Control Department had provided cover of the most transparent variety, had been largely overcome. Intelligence-gathering was still regarded with distaste by some Foreign Service stalwarts, but the war had generally transformed the hostility of all but the most stubborn. The fact that SIS's epithet of 'the firm' changed to the more affectionate 'the Friends' is an indication of the transfom-ation in the regular Diplomatic Service's attitude. ?

The Passport Control Department survived within the Foreign Office until 1968, when it was finally merged with the regular Passport Office. Even more surprisingly, all three of the post-war Directors of Passport Control, Maurice Jeffes, John Teague and Leslie Mitchell, were really senior SIS officers. The Passport Control Department also provided Harold Caccia with a suitably misleading entry in the Diplomatic List, and several Heads of Station around the world still use 'Visa Officer as their local cover. In most Allied countries the identity of the Head of Station was well known to the local intelligence authorities with whom he was expected to develop a good working relationship. Usually he was not just tolerated, but actively welcomed and given every opportunity to capitalize on wartime friendships and favours. He also provided a useful alternative channel for semi-official, non-diplomatic communications. In some countries, such as the United States, SIS and MI5 both maintained permanent representatives. During the war, a combined office called British Security Co-ordination (BSC) had been run from New York by Sir William Stephenson, encompassing SOE, the Political Warfare Executive, MI5 and SIS; but the terms of a secret 'no poaching' Anglo-American security pact required that the BSC be wound up as soon as the Japanese had surrendered. An interesting feature of the post-war era was British and American respect for the jealously guarded sovereignty of each other s territory; SIS agreed not to recruit US citizens in return for an American undertaking not to conduct covert operations within the Empire without prior consent. The removal of Stephenson from New York, however, did not mean the end of a British intelligence presence in America. In fact, Peter Dwyer, formerly the SIS Head of Station in Panama, opened an SIS office at the British Embassy in Washington and ran it until 1949, when he retired to Ottawa. MI5's Security Liaison Officer (SLO) during the same period was Dick Thistlethwaite. They were then replaced by Philby and Geoffrey Paterson, respectively. In Singapore, the situation was a little more complex, as MI5 had its own intelligence unit there, the Counter-Intelligence Co-ordination Bureau (CICB). Headed by Colonel Dickie Dixon, the CICB's function was to mop up enemy stay-behind organizations. It had only a short life because the Japanese had been very unsuccessful in building up networks of agents. At the end of 1945, Dixon returned to London, leaving his two deputies, John Harrison and Courtney Young, MI5's only Japanese-speaker, to build Security Intelligence Far East. SIFE extended to Borneo, Kuala Lumpur, Colombo, Hong Kong, Rangoon and Australia, where SLOB maintained a link between the local police Speaal Branches and MI5's overseas branch in London, designated E Division.

SIS's parallel system, also based in Singapore, was headed by (Sir) Denys Page, the Oxford academic who was subsequently appointed Master of Jesus College, Cambridge. His Who's Who entry modestly recorded his brief role as 'I945-6 Head of a Command Unit, Intelligence Division, HQ South-East Asia'. His office had outposts in Canberra, Rangoon, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangkok (and, latterly, Vientiane and Hanoi), and answered to SIS's Controller Far East, who, until 1950, was Dick Ellis, another old intelligence hand who had first joined MI6 as an assistant Passport Control Officer in Berlin in 1924. In 1940, he had been posted to New York as Stephenson's deputy in BSC. When Malcolm MacDonald, the Govemor- General of Malaya, was appointed British Commissioner-General in South- East Asia in 1948, both MI5 and SIS's organizations reported to his local liaison committee, known as the Joint Intelligence Committee Far East, or JIC/FE. The set-up in Singapore, with a joint intelligence apparatus answering to the local British minister, was similar to the arrangements in the Middle East, where John Teague maintained a regional headquarters for SIS in Cairo masquerading as the Combined Research and Planning Office. This cover, usually known as CRPO (pronounced 'Creepo'), was a translucent successor to the Inter-Services Liaison Department (ISLD), which had long been compro- mised. CRPO operated within the British Middle East Office structure; had important stations in Beirut, Baghdad, Tehran, Amman, Basra, Port Said and Damascus; and worked closely with MI5's rather more overt outfit, Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME). Headed by Brigadier Douglas Roberts, a veteran SIS agent who had even worked under commer?al cover as an 'illegal' in Russia, SIME distributed staff in British territories throughout the Middle East, working closely with the colonial authorities in Aden, Cyprus, Pale3tine and the Sudan. They were usually in the guise of Defence Security Officers (DSOs), but other, more convenient covers.were employed when the occasion demanded. MI5's man in Iraq, for example, Jack Morton, was seconded as Civil Assistant on the Staff of the Air Officer Commanding RAF Habbaniyah. SIME was only to have a relatively short existence, but it played a cru?al role in the post-war development of British intelligence. Both Douglas Roberts and his deputy, Maurice Oldfield, were to transfer to 'the firm', bringing with them many of SIME's most talented case officers. Among them were Myles Ponsonby and Harold Shergold. Several other senior SIME officers, including Bill Magan, Alex Kellar, Philip Kirby Green and Bill Oughton, were to become directors of MI5. Immediately after the war, the practice of duplicating representatives was more common, with MI5 officers attached to overseas embassies to sort out old counter-espionage cases or research aspects of the Soviet apparatus exposed by Approved For Rel+e~ 20t~/~12'4R~IAR~P96'F#0~172R000100060001-5 Approved For Release 2005/08/24 :CIA-RDP96B01172R000100060001-5 CIR INTERNRL USE ONLY the Germans. Thus, when Charles de Salis and John Bruce Lockhart were manning the Paris Station during the immediate post-war period, there were also two Security Service officers on the staff: Jasper Harker, working from the Military Attache's office, and (Sir) Peter Hope, seconded as a temporary First Secretary. Unlike their counterparts in the NKVD, the Soviet intelligence and security apparatus, SIS staff behind the Iron Curtain made little attempt to avoid being identified for what they really were. George Berry, for example, who had taken over the Moscow Station in June 1943, remained there until I95I. Before the war he had served as British Passport Control Officer in Riga and Vienna, so he was thoroughly 'blown' long before he ever set foot in Russia. Similarly, Harold Gibson, another old stager with a long intelligence career who had been Head of Station in Prague for six years before the war, resumed his post in 1945. Concealment, of course, would have been somewhat futile, considering that up until January 1947, when Philby handed R5 over to Brigadier Roberts, responsibility for co-ordinating SIS's anti-Soviet operations was in the hands of a colleague who was to be revealed as a long-term NKVD 'mole'. In reality, it was not the Eastern Bloc stations that undertook the man- agement of anti-Soviet operations. The real 'front-line' stations in SIS's world- wide network were actually in the European zones of occupation. Many of the most dramatic post-war intelligence battles were fought in (and under) the Allied sectors of Germany and Austria. ? ?

Gem~any's post-war future had been the subject of three inter-Allied confer- ences, at Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam. It had been agreed that the country was to be divided into separate zones of occupation and, as soon as the enemy had been subdued, that the various forces were to withdraw to their own prearranged sectors. The Russians were to take the north-east, the British the north-west, leaving the Americans in command of the southem end, plus the port of Bremen on the North Sea. On 2I June 1945, American troops withdrew from their combat positions and the new zones formally came into being. As well as agreeing to carve up what was left of the Reich, the Allies had also decided to restore Austria's pre-war frontier, the country being regarded, somewhat controversially, as having been a victim of Nazi aggression rather than a willing participant in Hitler s Third Reich. This rather over-generous interpretation of Austria's role before and after the Anschluss in 1938 did not prevent the country from being divided into zones of occupation. The Soviets took the eastern third of the country, comprising of Lower Austria, Burgenland and Upper Austria north of the Danube. This left the British with Styria, Carinthia and the East Tyrol, with a zone extending from the Italian frontier, and the Americans with an area of the Alps, taking in the province of Salzburg and Upper Austria south of the Danube, which conveniently neighboured the southem limit of their German territory.

Berlin was to be divided into three zones, the British and Americans taking the western end of the city. Vienna was to be divided into four zones, with the fourth, the city centre, being under tripartite control. The Soviets had ratified the plan for Berlin at a meeting held at Lancaster House in London in September 1944, and so, on 4 July I945, they handed over control of the western sectors to British and American troops. None of these considerations took account of French sensibilities, eloquently expressed by General de Gaulle, who demanded, and obtained, part of the British and American zones in Germany, the North Tyrol and Vorarlberg in Austria, and part of the western sectors of Berlin and Vienna. Accordingly, the city centre of Vienna came under quadripartite control, and jeeps canying a representative from the military police of each of the four countries became a familiar sight.

Certainly, the Allied occupation was an extraordinary undertaking, which was generally expected to last for about twenty years. Germany was to be governed by the Allied Control Council, drawn from the separate Allied Control Commissions, and Berlin, some 200 miles into the Soviet zone, was to be run by a joint body known as the Kommandatura. Given Berlin's strategic position in the heart of East Germany, and considerably closer to Poland than Hamburg, it was inevitable that the city would become known as the agenfensumpf or'spy swamp'. Every country established at least one intelligence headquarters there. SIS had offices in the British Control Commission for Gemtany (BCCG) at Lancaster House on the Fehrbelliner-Platz and requi- sitioned abuilding adjoining the Olympic Stadium, where SIS opened a station in 1946. Since the BCCG was eventually to employ a total of 22,520 staff, it was easy enough to provide further cover by attaching SIS personnel to the BCCG's Intelligence Division (ID), a small unit non discreetly by Brigadier J.S. (Tubby') Lethbridge. For its part the NKVD, under the notorious Ivan Serov, took over the old Sankt Antonius hospital in Karlshorst, with the Soviet military intelligence service, the GRU, operating from an undamaged block in Wiinsdorf. The Fledgling American intelligence organization (which was not to be Formally created as the Central Intelligence Agency until September 1947) was to occupy a building that had once been the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, before moving to the C1ayAllee. In the year immediately following the German surrender, numerous British intelligence outposts were established. The main centre of SIS operations was located at Bad Salzuflen, with Harold Shergold in charge, with an outstation in the British Consulate at Dusseldorf. However, SIS by no means enjoyed a monopoly on British intelligence functions in the occupied territories. In overall command was the Director of Civil Affairs and Military Government at 2lst Army Group HQ, Major-General (later Field Marshal Sir) Gerald Templer. He had previously run SOE's disastrous German unit, X Section, which had attempted to infiltrate anti-Nazi agents back into the Third Reich with appalling losses, and had enjoyed considerable intelligence experience earlier in the war. His military intelligence staff commandeered an elegant gaming casino at Bad Oeynhausen, a small spa which, together with two neighbouring undamaged market towns, Lubeck and Bunde, had become the seat of the military govern- ment. There Templer and General Bill Williams, Field Marshal Montgomery's principal intelligence adviser, began to construct an impressive empire, which extended via the BCCG regional offices throughout the British zone.

His efforts were largely nullified by his then undiscovered dual role as a Soviet spy. The ID's task was chiefly liaison: to keep in close touch with MI5, SIS, the German Political Branch of the Foreign Office and the BCCG's regional offices, and to supply the newly set-up denazification tribunals with relevant information. It was a tall order and, given the difficult local working conditions, the BCCG's inadequate budget and the restrictive political limitations imposed by the Foreign Office, one that was impossible to achieve with any measure of success. It certainly left little opportunity for running anti-Soviet operations which, in any case, were doomed thanks to the activities of Leo Long and another well-placed Soviet spy in the BCCG's Press Department Z Another handicap was the presence of two left-wing MPs, Austen Albu and Konni Zilliacus, who haci both been attached to the BCCG by the incoming Labour Goven~unent in London. Their role, with Emest Bevin's apparent consent, was to ensure that when German political parties were eventually allowed to operate, only the Social Democrats would be in a position to take power. Zilliacus was a particularly sinister influence and was destined to be expelled from the Labour Party for his pro-Soviet views. The purposes of SIS's operations in Austria and Germany during the immediate post-war period were diffuse. On the security front there was a determination to uncover and eliminate ail the Nazi or Soviet networks which signals intelligence reliably indicated had been left behind. As far as the acquisition of information was concerned, this was limited to the insertion of individual short-term agents into the East to obtain details of the Soviet order of battle and possibly some indication of any military build-up which might betray a surprise move. There was also the political task of ensuring stability in the western zones and the additional objective of acquiring as much technical intelligence as might be available. Leading this latter mission was Sir Charles Hambro, formerly head of SOE, who, with help from an SIS team led by Eric Welsh, sought out physiasts and other scientists who were judged to be of use. Welsh used to boast of being the only regular SIS officer with a scientific degree; as a result, he had worked on Britain's secret attempts to frustrate the development of a Nazi atomic bomb. The German experts selected by Hambro and Welsh were either debriefed at a special centre at Gottingen or flown to RAF Tempsford, home of the wartime Moon Squadrons, where a secluded country house, Farm Hall, provided secure accommodation with microphones in every room. A large number of atomic researchers, including a few lacking anti-Nazi credentials, willingly passed along this route before obtaining a Approved For R~I~~e~0U~70812'4~^CI1~~P9'66D?1728000100060001-5 Approved For Release 2005/08/24 :CIA-RDP96B01172R000100060001-5 CIR INTERNRL USE ONLY security clearance and permanent employment on classified work in England and the United States. Another parallel project, codenamed BACKFIRE, recruited German experts to collaborate with Sir Alwyn Crow, in charge of Britain's top-secret guided missile programme at the Rocket Propulsion Research Establishment at Westcott, near Aylesbury. Werner von Braun was one of those who were taken to England for questioning. 'I must admit that I thought the British might be unfriendly to me, but [ found I was wrong the first day,' he recalled.' Nevertheless, he subsequently got a better offer from the Americans. Major Robert Slaver, who ran the London end of the US scientific intelligence operation, acknowledged that 'the British pulled a sneaky on us. Partly by chicanery, and partly through clever staff work, they were able to gain possession of many of the most important German engineers who they used on BACKFIRE.'4 Although this particular recruitment programme required the co-operation of the German experts, there was a quite separate operation run by the Americans, with the help of some rather desperate Eastern European emigres, to obtain technical expertise through coercion. In 1948 one such scheme, aimed at a senior Soviet technician named Colonel Grigori Tokaev, rebounded against them and provided SIS with its first important defector in the post- war era. Tokaev had been a lecturer in jet engine technology and rocket propulsion at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy in Moscow, and had enjoyed a long career at the elite Institute of Engineers and Geodesics. However, after the Nazi surrender, he had been transfen ed to Berlin with very precise orders to snatch German scientists who might assist Soviet missile research. Although a committed Communist, Tokaev had been a supporter of Trotsky and was what might be termed today a dissident. He was utterly opposed to his instructions and, when he learned that Professor Kurt Tank Focke-Wulf's chief aircraft designer, was to be grabbed by the NKVD, he underwent a crisis of conscience. At the very moment he considered defecting to the Americans, he himself nearly became the victim of a kidnapping by emigres working for them. He later recalled how he received further warnings to beware of being kidnapped. I was hunted by emigre organizations dating from the revolution; they asked me to put them in touch with underground movements in the USSR; they also tried to persuade me to desert to the West. I had met their kind when I first came to Gemtany, but now some of them were strongly backed by foreign money, and their arrogance had grown beyond belief. They showed me how closely I was shadowed from outside the Soviet zone as well as from inside it.? ?

Tokaev was alone in his car en route to Schwerin from Berlin when he was forced off the road by two ernigres. Luckily he was armed, and the two would- be kidnappers fled. Badly shaken, and convinced that the NKVD was planning to arrest him for his membership of a group of dissidents, he defected to the British with his wife and daughter. He was received in Berlin by the local SIS station and flown straight to London, where he was debriefed by the Special Liaison Centre headed by Commander Wilfred Dunderdale RNVR. 'Biffy' Dunderdale, in common with other senior SIS officers like Harold Gibson and Harry Carr, had been born in Russia and spoke the language rather better than he spoke English. Having joined SIS in Istanbul, Dunderdale had run the Paris Station for fourteen years until the outbreak of war and had unrivalled contacts within the White Russian emigre community in France. During the war he had liaised with the Free French, but afterwards he went back to his anti-Soviet calling and took over Section V's old offices in Ryder Street. It was there that he created a highly secret SIS sub-office, staffed mainly by elderly emigres, and sought to process defectors. His first subject, the head of the Soviet Reparations Mission in Bremen, Colonel J.D. Tasoev, came over to the West early in May 1948, but, much to SIS's embarrassment, changed his mind almost as soon as he reached London. He was promptly returned to the Russians, after enduring a spell in Hammersmith police station during which a lengthy debate was held at Broadway about the relative merits of dumping the recalcitrant Soviet into the North Sea from a height of 20,000 feet. Menzies vetoed that particular solution and Tasoev was delivered safely to the Kommandatura in Berlin, sparking off a minor diplomatic incident and a few awkward questions in Parliament. In contrast, Tokaev's defection proved entirely successful as he provided a wealth of detailed information about Soviet activities in Gemlany. He later collaborated with one of his debriefers to write two volumes of autobiography, Betrayal of an Ideal and Comrade X Tokaev was followed by others, but none were ever of his stature, so the Special Liaison Centre was eventually closed down. The other Western intelligence agenaes had their own particular priorities, with the Americans placing heavy reliance on the Gehlen organization, which had been granted an extended life in a special prisoner-of-war compound at Oberursel, near Frankfurt. There General Reinhard Gehlen, once the master- mind in charge of the Abwehr s wartime networks on the Russian front, willingly negotiated a pact with Brigadier-General Edwin Silbert, the senior US intelligence officer in Germany, and activated his long-term agents in the East to provide his new American masters with an apparatus that was to become the Bundesnachrichtendiest, a ready-made intelligence-gathering machine. SIS had considerable reservations about the deal struck between Approved For R~I~~e~~~CI~~P~@T172R000100060001-5 Approved For Release 2005/08/24 :CIA-RDP96B01172R000100060001-5 CIR INTERNAL USE ONLY 26 The Friends Silbert and Gehlen, but was powerless to raise formal objections. It was not so much the principle of collaborating with such a recent enemy, but the anxiety that the Americans might find themselves in a master/servant role reversal. After all, Gehlen had had vast experience, whereas the Americans were relative novices in the field of espionage, despite their huge resources. In fact, the pact was founded 'on a verbal agreement and a handshake'6 and had been endorsed by Kenneth Strong, who was 'asked not to enquire too closely into the matter'.' SIS had no such advantage, and it was not until late in 1949 that its chosen nominee, Otto John, was placed in charge of the BfV, the federal internal security unit which had previously been limited to the running of three refugee reception centres, where defectors and others with useful scientific, military or political information could be debriefed. In contrast to the Gehlen organization, which actively ran high-risk networks of agents into the East, SIS's approach was to concentrate its limited resources on the interrogation of escapees. The BfV was an ideal vehicle for such an operation, although John himself was an unpopular choice, especially with Gehlen, because he had switched sides in 1944 after the ZO July plot against Hitler had failed. He had managed to escape to Lisbon, where he surrendered to the local SIS station, and subsequently had been put to work on various 'black propaganda' projects by the Ministry of Economic Warfare. After the war, he had joined the prosecution staff at Nuremberg, which had not endeared him to his former friends, and had actually interrogated Field Marshal von IVlanstein. Gehlen thought him 'unsteady and rootless, he was not a professional in this field',\" and also despised him as a security risk John was to defect to the East in July 1954, but then returned five months later, claiming to have been the victim of a kidnapping. The schism between John and Gehlen did little to foster good relations between the local representatives of their respective paymasters, SIS and the CIA. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of SIS's post-war operations in Germany were those run from the British zone into the Russian heartland. Each mission was authorized by the CSS and his Deputy, Jack Easton, and received the Foreign Secretary's blessing. The reason for these missions was Whitehall's growing anxiety about Soviet intentions in Europe. Stalin's swift take-over in the recently 'liberated' countries, where he had undertaken to sponsor free and fair elections, was an unmistakable manifestation of old-style Russian expansionism. Liberal administrations throughout Central Europe were replaced ruthlessly with Communist regimes, and in the view of the pugnaaous Bevin, such behaviour could only be deterred by fomenting subversion. There were no illusions about overthrowing Communism or toppling Moscow's nominees, but there was a belief that a strategy of encouraging home-grown resistance would lead to more caution in the Kremlin. ? ?

A sympathetic Kriegsmarine veteran, Hans-Helmut ('H-H') Klose, had been recruited in Hamburg by Harold Gibson to run a clandestine ferry service from the Danish island of Bornholm, through the Baltic to Estonia and Latvia, using captured E-boats. The case officer in charge was a recruit from SIME, Anthony Cavendish, who worked closely with the Naval Intelligence Division's senior representative in Germany, Commander Anthony Courtney. The Admiralty concealed the operation as an alternate minesweeping and fishery protection exercise, but the reality was that SIS infiltrated a substantial number of heavily armed White Russian emigres into the Soviet Union, where they tried to organize a partisan resistance movement along the lines of those that had proved so successful against the Nazis. Among the Naval Intelligence personnel seconded to the operation was (Sir) John Harvey-Jones, a Russian interpreter who subsequently became Chairman of ICI. Courtney recalls providing the SIS with direct naval assistance in the Baltic. This work involved a close liaison with the Liirssen brothers of Vegesack, where I was struck by the potential capabilities of stripped-down ex-Kriegsmarine 'E' boat hulls, powered by the incomparable twin Mercedes-Benz 518 diesel engines. With my assistants, the Staff Officers (Intelligence) at Hamburg and Kiel, I was frequently at Lubeck and Flensburg and other smaller harbours such as Eckenforde and Kappeln, from which we mounted our operations. Little did I know that the penetration of the Foreign Office and the SIS by the Russian Intelligence Service must have not only doomed our efforts from the start, but had involved me personally in sending many a brave man into the jaws of a Soviet trap 9 SIS continued to support the operation long after it became clear to others that most of the missions were going hopelessly wrong and costing the lives of expensively trained agents. The drawback of these politically embarrassing, deniable covert operations is invariably the necessity to depend upon the participation of individuals who are unlikely to spark off a crisis when caught. Inevitably this limited deployment in the field to emigres, and restricted the really experienced operatives to routine training duties in safe areas where they were unlikely to cause embarrassment. This is exactly what happened with Easton s anti-Soviet operations, and it was not for some years that Broadway realized that almost all of the Russian emigre groups in Germany had been thoroughly penetrated and that its own organization was not exactly immune to the KGB.

The primary cause of our failure in Palestine was the failure of our intelligence service.' Lord Altrincham (formerly Sir Edward Grigg), British Minister in the Middle East SIS's bitterly unhappy experience in Palestine is a less than creditable chapter in Britain's post-war history. It was a frustrating and much misunderstood attempt to achieve the impossible by reconciling the conflicting aspirations of Arabs and Jews. Nowhere were the results of the 1945 general election, called by Churchill in July, more eagerly awaited than in Palestine, where the British Goverment had exercised its mandate for more than twenty years. Jewish demands for a homeland had been vocal since the Balfour Declaration in 1917, when the Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, had said that His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. Over the years, the first half of this policy statement had received rather more emphasis than the latter, much to the anxiety of the Arab states in the Middle East. In order to allay their fears, Chamberlains Government had issued a White Paper in May 1939, which proposed strict limits on Jewish immigration for five yeah, and what amounted to an Arab veto on further Jewish settlement thereafter. This reversal was a highly controversial decision, especially in the light of the systematic Nazi persecution of Jews in Germany, Approved For R~I~e ~~~~S~l'2~~1/~~~96~~Y172R000100060001-5 Approved For Ref I Re I NTERNRL USE P~~ i 1728000100060001-5 Ti~~~ Friends and had been denounced at the timi? by both Churchill and Attlee. It had also been the spark that had ignited Jewish extremism. Mot surprisingly, in view of the commitments given by the leaders of both Britain's political parties, Zionists around the world anticipate} a dramatic improvement in their fortunes immediately after the 1945 election. After all, both Attlee and Churchill had pledged themselves to oppose the t~olicy based on the 1939 White Paper, so the result was presumed to be good news, whoever won. In the event, Attlee was swept to power and promptly decided to continue with the existing policy. This was seen by many in the Jewish communities of Palestine and Europe as nothing less than a betrayal, and served to inflame the Zionists. The main representative body for Jewish opinion was the Jewish Agency Eor Palestine, headed by David Ben-Gurion, which also boasted a military wing, the Haganah. Technically the Haganah was illegal, but many of its members had been enrolled as armed special constables during the Arab revolts of 1936-9. By tradition the Haganah pursued a policy of havlagah, the Hebrew word for self-restraint, and as soon as war had been declared with Germany the Haganah had suspended its anti-British agitation for the duration. So too did the Irgun Zvai Leumi, asemi-independent underground organization, which had taken a more aggressive attitude to the question of a Jewish homeland in Palestine by carrying out armed attacks on Arab villages. Com- posed mainly of Polish 'illegals', many of the Irgun's members had volunteered for service in the British army, whilr others fought in resistance movements in Europe. One group of extremists, however, deaded to continue their campaign against what they perceived as the British occupation of Palestine. Led by Avraham Stem, the self-styled 'Frerdom Fighters of Israel' robbed banks, attacked military installations and murdered policemen. Stem was eventually tracked down on 13 February 1942 in an attic in Mizrachi Street, Tel Aviv, the home of another terrorist who ha~1 been wounded and captured two weeks earlier. During his arrest, Stem was shot dead by a British police officer but, undeterred the Stem Gang continu~?d its activities for a further six years achieving world-wide notoriety in November 1944 when the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Lord Moynr, was assassinated in a Cairo street by two young members of the gang. By the end of the war, some 130,000 Palestinian Jews had served with the British forces, of whom 32,000 had joi~led the army, which, in September 1944, had formed a Jewish Brigade. In short, the Jewish opposition to Britain's continued role in Palestine was sol?histicated, well-trained and brilliantly organized. Many, like Moshe Dayan of the Haganah's intelligence unit, the Sherut Yediot or Shai, had been taug}~t by either SIS or SOE.

Dayan's direct superior in the Shai was Isser Harel, a Future head of Mossad (Israel's intelligence service) who had himself been trained by the Palestine Police. He had been discharged for insubordination. Once hostilities in Europe ended, the Irgun renewed its activities under the leadership of a Polish immigrant, Menachem Begin. He selected his principal opponent, the Palestine Police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID), as his main target and wasted no time in masterminding a series of attacks on various police stations, including the CID's headquarters in Jaffa. In May 1945, the Anglo-Iraqi pipeline was bombed, and there were numerous other acts of sabotage perpetrated by the Irgun with the intention of making British rule untenable. The British, however, had anticipated an escalation in Jewish violence and, in a pre-emptive strike in October 1944, had airlifted 251 detainees from the Caftan internment camp to Kenya. This decisive move had left the Irgun with only an estimated thirty-forty activists in the field, but this was a sufficient number for the launch of a series of raids designed to build up a stockpile of arms. The campaign culminated on b March 1946 in an audacious operation in which Irgun members masqueraded as British personne! and penetrated the huge military compound at Sarafand. As well as being garrisoned by the crack 6th Airborne Division, the base also housed Britain's largest overseas signals interception facility. Without even being challenged, the raiders simply drove up to the camp's amtoury and loaded rifles, Bren guns and ammunition into a stolen truck while the quartermaster s staff were held at gunpoint. in spite of the presence of the paratroopers in the camp, the raiders escaped and all but two eluded arrest. When the Irgun realized that two of its members, Michael Ashbel and Joseph Simchon, had been caught, Begin responded by ordering the kidnapping of five British officers from the Yarkon Hotel in Tel Aviv to hold as hostages. A sixth, Major H. B. Chadwick, attached to SIME's office in Jerusalem, was also bundled into a car, but managed to negotiate his own release. The other five were freed when the death sentence on Ashbel and Simchor was lifted. The Sarafand incident was an eloquent demonstration that the Palestine Police were quite unable to cope with the combined, growing strength of the Haganah, the Irgun and the Stem Gang, so the Colonial Office requested SIS assistance. Stewart Menzies was asked to help achieve two important objec- tives: the formation of acounter-terrorist intelligence group to operate within Palestine, and the recruitment of a clandestine team to reduce the Flow of illegal immigrants from Europe.

Until his attachment to the Palestine Police as Assistant Inspector-General, Fergusson had been Chief of Combined Operations. Now he was given carte blanche to identify and eliminate the fanatics who had been widely condemned, especially by the Jewish Agency whose leadership generally regarded terrorism as a tactic to be counter- productive. As Fergusson minuted at the time: There is in the army a small number of officers, who have both technical and psychological knowledge of terrorism, having themselves been engaged in similar operations on what may be termed the kerrorist side in countries occupied by the enemy in the late war.` The problem of illegal immigration was rather more complex than the challenge of terrorism in Palestine. A substantial proportion of the survivors of the Nazi Holocaust were determined to settle in Palestine, yet British policy, as set out in the 1939 White Paper and enforced by Attlee's administration, was to reduce the number of entry certificates granted. In 1944, 14,600 certificates had been issued; by the end of the following year, the Figure had been brought down to I3, I00. Spurred by outbreaks of officially sponsored anti-Semitic violence in Poland, the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe were moving westwards and joining the many thousands of 'displaced persons' sheltering in makeshift refugee camps. The three main routes used and supported by the Haganah were through Gemlany to Berlin and then Hamburg in the British zone; through the French zone in Germany and onwards down to Marseilles; and, the most popular path, via Vienna and then Villach in the British sector. From there the Haganah ran two underground railroads, known as brycha, down the Adriatic coast of Italy, or to ports like Sizak in Yugoslavia. Having got thus far, the refugees weze ferried to beaches in Palestine in an assortment of patched-up, war-surplus tramp steamers. Between August 1945 and May 1946 some 73,000 'illegals' were believed to have been carried to thew homeland in around sixty-four unseaworthy ships. The Royal Nary attempted to enforce a blockade and intercept vessels thought to be carrying 'illegals', but its intelligence was inadequate and the highly publicized incidents involving the an:est of refugee ships in the Mediterranean and the internment of their human cargoes in Cyprus and Mauritius had a poor reception in the United States. This latter consideration was to become increasingly important as the Jewish community in America rallied to the Zionist cause.

As the Arabs controlled the oilfields, it was in Britain's long-tem1, strategic interests to be allied with its traditional friends and maintain a balance to ensure regional peace. Therefore numerous compromise solutions, such as the partition of Palestine, were under debate, but from the Jewish viewpoint no further discussion was necessary. A homeland had been promised to the Jews in the Balfour Declaration and, after the Nazi death- camp experience, any hardship could be endured in their escape from Europe and in the fulfilment of that promise. The Haganah aimed to ensure the safety of the refugees en route, and the Irgun vowed that it would bring the mandate to a swift end. In January 1946, Sir Noel Charles, Britain's Ambassador in Rome, reported to London that 'we are doing our utmost to check the clandestine influx of refugees from Austria',2 but he did not go into details. In fact, in response to a directive from Menzies, information from the SIS stations in Paris, Vienna, Milan and Trieste were being collated in Rome, which was SIS's largest European station, by Colonel Harold Perkins, who had devised a scheme to disrupt the traffic of weapons and refugees: limpet mines were to be attached to the refugee ships so as to prevent them from reaching Palestine. The man chosen to undertake this sensitive task was Frederick Vanden Heuvel, a Count of the Holy Roman Empire and a director of Eno's Fruit Salts, who until recently had been the long-serving SIS Head of Station in Beme. Vanden Heuvel had been replaced in Switzerland by Nicholas Elliott in 1945 and, upon his return to Broadway, had been assigned the Rome Station, where Kenneth Benton was, already in command, with secret instructions to launch ananti- Haganahoperation. Vanden Heuvel chose two other SIS officers to accompany him: Perkins and Wing-Commander Derek Verschoyle. Perkins had graduated from Prague University with a degree in engineering and had gone on to qualify as a master mariner. By the time war broke out, he had teamed some Polish and had become the owner-manager of a small textile mill in Bielsko, Silesia. He had an awesome reputation for toughness, and one of his SIS colleagues, Bickham Sweet-Escott, recalled that 'Perks' was 'the only man I have ever actually seen bend a poker in his hands'' He worked in the Polish section of SOE throughout the war and eventually headed it, along with the Czech and Hungarian sections. When the Germans evacuated Prague, Perkins had appointed himself the acting British Charge d'Affaires, a post he kept for some weeks until the pre-war SIS Head of Station, Harold Gibson, had flown out to relieve him. Although perhaps not quite as colourful as Perkins, Verschoyle was an Irishman, educated at Trinity, Dublin, who had been the literary editor of the SpecEator before he had joined the RAF in 1940. Thereafter, he had served Approved For F~e~selZOV5f08/24~- CIS~=FZDP9'6B01172R000100060001-5 Approved For Release 2005/08/24 :CIA-RDP96B01172R000100060001-5 CIR INTERNAL USE ONLY 34 The Fiends Bomber Command and the Mediterranean Allied Forces before transferring to SIS. His cover in Rome was First Secretary. His deputy, responsible For liaising with the Italian authorities, had formerly served in SIS's Dutch country section. Vanden Heuvel's plan was to infiltrate agents into the Haganah's network using the SIS representatives in Locamo and Milan, Lance de Garston and Edward de Haan. One early success was the discovery of an arms dump of over forty tons of weapons in the Magenta displaced-persons camp west of Milan. However, their main objective was to find out which Adriatic harbour had been selected Eor the 'illegals' next embarkation point. Once identified, Perkins's task was to procure the necessary equipment and then plant the explosives on the side of the vessel well below the waterline. A timer was used to ensure that the ship was sunk away from port in international waters. Apparently, one refugee ship was successfully attacked, but the operation was cancelled when the Haganah retaliated. Meanwhile, in Palestine, the level of violence had escalated. On I3 July 1945, a police constable was killed when a British army truck carrying detonators was ambushed. On 25 July, the Lydda-Kantara railway link was cut when a bridge was blown up. In the spring of 1946, two terrorists were killed in an attack on the police headquarters at Ramat Gan, and the Irgun launched its raid on Sarafand. This was the atmosphere in which Fergusson operated, but he experienced great difficulty in obtaining help from the community or in recruiting agents. As Begin later remarked: British Intelligence did its best to introduce informers into our ranks and to acquire agents from among our members. In all the years of the revolt theee were only three cases of treachery and the enemy Intelligence never once succeeded in introducing their own agents into the underground without their being discovered almost immediately. They never succeeded -and this is most important - in getting agents into positions high up in the direction of the struggle.' Certainly, the one useful source inside the Stem Gang, Israel Prizker, was shot for 'helping British Intelligence The British response to the Sarafand raid was Operation BROADSIDE, executed on Z9 June 1946, in which all the Jewish Agency offices in Palestine were occupied and 3,000 people were taken into custody and questioned at a special purpose-built camp at Rafiah, near the Egyptian border. The exercise yielded the first solid information about the composition of the Irgun and the Stem Gang, and led the Haganah to issue a formal statement withdrawing its support from armed conflict. Menachem Begin was identified as the Irgun's leader and Yaacov Meridor as his deputy. A list of 1,500 Irgun supporters i ?

Begin, who had a ?10,000 price on his head, was never caught by the authorities, but moved constantly from one safe-house to another in the Tel Aviv area, disguised as a bearded rabbi. He has subsequently described this period of his life in The Revolt, in which he admitted that, even though the Haganah had publicly dissociated itself Erom the Irgun, up to September 1946 they had maintained a close liaison and had held joint conferences to approve plans every fortnight. The Irgun reacted to BROADSIDE by striking at the heart of the British administration. Seven milk chums packed with high explosives were placed under the south wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which accom- modated the army's General Headquarters. Ninety-one were killed and IIO injured, including fifteen Jewish civilians, when the six-storey structure col- lapsed in the explosion. The King David Hotel bomb, which had been detonated before a proper warning could be given or the south wing evacuated, created outrage in Britain, among many of the Zionists and certainly among the security forces, which urged a crackdown and an end to further immigration. However, for political reasons, neither followed. Bevin was then attempting with President Truman to find a compromise solution, involving autonomous but separate Arab and Jewish provinces in Palestine. Despite endless meetings the negotiations came to little, apparently because of Zionist pressure on Truman's domestic supporters. Their plan was to demand partition and then create a Jewish state. The British response was to allow Perkins and his team in Italy a free hand in choking off the supply of arms and volunteers bound for Palestine, but the combined forces of the Irgun and the Haganah had antiapated the escalation. The first counter-attack took place on 9 September 1946, when the senior SIS officer in Tel Aviv, Major Desmond Doran, was assassinated by a grenade while sitting on the balcony of his house with his Romanian-born wife, Sanda, who was badly injured. Two other SIS officers escaped unhurt. Before the war Doran had served in Berlin and had been Head of Station in Bucharest before transferring to ISLD in Cairo. His death is thought to be the only 'active service' casualty SIS has suffered in the post-war era. On the same day, a Palestine Police CID sergeant with twelve years' experience was shot in the back outside the popular Windsor Hotel. He had recently masterminded the arrest, interrogation and deportation of Begin's principal lieutenant, an activist named Yitzhak Ysernitzky. The third incident occurred early in the morning of 3I October, when two suitcase bombs were placed against the front door of the British Embassy in Rome; the explosion rendered the building uninhabitable. The Italian police later aaested Israel Epstein, who was impri- soned for the offence.
