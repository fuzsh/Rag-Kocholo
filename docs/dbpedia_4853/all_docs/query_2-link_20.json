        "text": "Chinese investment group CITIC Europe Holdings have sold Slavia Prague and the club’s Fortuna Arena stadium to Czech investor, entrepreneur and lifelong Slavist Pavlo Tykač.\n\nSlavia Prague play in the Czech First League, the top division in Czech Republic football.\n\nTheir home stadium is the Fortuna Arena (formerly known as Sinobo Stadium, Eden Aréna and Synot Tip Arena) in Prague-Vršovice, Czech Republic.\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 19,370 and is the biggest and the most modern football stadium in the Czech Republic. It is the home venue of SK Slavia Prague and occasionally the Czech Republic national football team.\n\n59-year-old Tykač is the billionaire owner of the Sev.en Energy Group that has been expanding its operations in recent years.\n\nTykač, the new owner of SK Slavia Prague, said, “I am one of the loyal Slavist fans, just as my father and grandfather were. Being able to participate in the further development of Slavia is a great honor for me. I hope that my children will one day continue my work.\n\n“For me, Slavia is a symbol of courage, diligence and perseverance, which are qualities I am betting on. That is why it is more of a commitment than an investment. I also thank the seller, who was able to raise the club to the top Czech and European level again. However, when the opportunity arose to join Slavia, I did not hesitate.”\n\nCITIC Europe Holdings has been the majority shareholder of the club for the past five years, during which time Slavia Prague won three championship titles, claimed three victories in the Czech Cup and had appearances in three quarter-finals of prestigious European competitions.\n\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval in the Czech Republic and the People’s Republic of China and is expected at the end of February.\n\nJaroslav Tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Prague said, “We have undoubtedly passed the most successful period of modern Slavic history. We have become the leader of positive changes in Czech football and thanks to our activities, we have a strong name throughout Europe. Moreover, today we are a profitable club at the peak of sporting and financial performance.\n\n“Pavel Tykač is an experienced Czech entrepreneur, investor and lifelong fan of Slavia with a great family tradition in the stitched jersey. We all believe that his joining the club will be of great benefit to the further development of Slavia. We welcome Pavel and we are very much looking forward to mutual cooperation.”\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
