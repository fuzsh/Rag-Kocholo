        "text": "World Lacrosse today announced the hosting rights to three upcoming world championships, with the 2025 Men’s U20 Championship officially awarded to Korea, and the 2026 Women’s Championship and 2027 Men’s Championship awarded to Japan.\n\nKorea will host its first world championship, as the eighth edition of the men’s U20 championship will be held in mainland Asia for the second time in its history. The event will be held in Seoguipo on Jeju Island from July 18-27, 2025.\n\nJapan hosted the women’s championship in 1997 and as the 12th edition of the event returns to Japan, it joins the United States and England as multi-time hosts. Japan will host the men’s championship for the first time in its 15th edition, and joins a group of Australia, Canada, England and the United States that have hosted both the men’s and women’s championships.\n\nThe 2026 and 2027 events in Japan are each expected to take place in July, with a specific location that will host both championships to be announced at a later date. It will mark the first time the men’s and women’s championships have been held in the same city in consecutive years, a sustainable and equitable approach for World Lacrosse events.\n\nWorld Lacrosse CEO Jim Scherr said: “We are thrilled to award these championships to Korea and Japan, two of our model members that are both ready to stage world-class events in incredible cities. With our upcoming women’s U20 championship, we will have four championships in four years in Asia, which reflects how the game has grown at a breathtaking speed. I am excited for our global community to experience firsthand why the region is a new epicenter of lacrosse.”\n\nJapan has been a member of World Lacrosse since 1990 and Korea has been a member since 1995. Both organizations were founding members of the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union in 2004, which has grown to 19 members.\n\nJeju Island is known as “The Honeymoon Island” of Asia, and a hub for Korea’s fast-growing passion for sports and culture. The island is accessible with an international airport and Korea previously hosted the 2017 Asia Pacific Lacrosse Championship in Seogwipo with six men’s teams and five women’s teams competing, as well as the 2022 APLU Qualifier for the 2023 Men’s Championship with six teams in attendance.\n\nJapan has hosted many major international sports events, including recent editions of the Olympic Games and Rugby World Cup in recent years. The country boasts the world’s largest city and exceptional public infrastructure, including transportation, accommodations and a variety of sports facilities, as well as world-famous sightseeing destinations.\n\nThe three events will conclude the current four-year cycle of World Lacrosse Championships beginning in 2024 before the sport is contested at the Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028."
