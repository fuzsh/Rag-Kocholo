Currently however, they are acting as barriers to progression, with the woeful lack of diversity in our Chairs, CEO’s and Executive Leadership populations. The recent FTSE Women Leaders Review Feb 2022 again highlighted this issue especially in the CEO and Executive Leadership landscape.\n\n“The number of women in the very top job, that is the CEO remains flat and stubbornly low, and there is much more to do on Executive Committees.”\n\nThe annual Female FTSE Board Report by Cranfield University shows a positive gender progression at the NED Board level, but throws into stark relief the lack of progress on gender equality in the C-Suite, with the female Chairman leadership of our Boards at 11% in the FTSE 100 and 14% in the FTSE 250 and with only 8% female CEOs across the FTSE 350. Additionally, female participation in executive leadership has flatlined at 13.7% in the FTSE 100 and 11.2% in the FTSE 250.\n\nWe are relying on traditional and slow solutions to solve an unsustainable situation; we need to employ spiralling creativity and innovation to drive change. This should be a revolution of action, thought and imagination to break the mold and learn new ways of thinking and acting.\n\nThe classic rationalisation to the lack of progression for women in CEO, Executive Committees and Senior Leadership roles is the ‘supply deficiency.’ The research done by Assistant Professor Shirley Lu (Harvard Business School) indicates that we could be waiting a long time for the ‘supply side’ environment to change voluntarily. At the same time, we have the insight from the Cranfield Report of the many capable female leaders who are around, ready and able to fulfil these most senior roles.\n\nWhile the average tenure of CEO’s at 5 years, provides an insight into their short-term focus, there is little excuse for Chairman to ignore this inequality with their generational stewardship of the business.\n\nIn a recent article I suggested that Quotas was the only way to break this log jam, starting with the role of the Chairman at 40%, in order to drive diversity throughout our companies. The female Chairs are available, ready and waiting for these appointments as demonstrated by the Cranfield Report.\n\nIt is time to act, and let’s not kid ourselves that ‘voluntary’ action alone will solve this issue. The original 2011 Davis Review ‘Women on Boards’ was commissioned and driven by the Government who were concerned about the slow rate of progress of women onto Boards. It did not spontaneously emerge for companies, the FRC or Companies industry bodies seeking to drive change.\n\nThe FTSE Women Leaders Review which is supported by Government and builds on the work, and success, of the Davies and Hampton-Alexander Reviews, has recognised this dilemma. The Review has set a new recommendation for the Senior Leadership of the FTSE 350 business. Namely, that a women should be in at least one of the most senior roles in a FTSE 350 business by 2025. Those roles are the Chair, Senior Independent Director, CEO or CFO. While this is a good first move, it fails to recognise the dominance of the Chair and CEO roles as the primary driving force for diversity across our businesses.\n\nThe Chairman and CEOs have had their chance to progress voluntarily, and they have failed. It is now time for Governments, Regulators, Female Chairs, NEDs and the Diversity Lobbying Bodies, to say enough is enough, the time for substantive action to break the behavioural anchors has arrived. Only an immediate progress on the levels of Women Chairman will drive out this inequality of female CEO’s and Leadership Executives across our business landscape. I would be delighted to see the FTSE Women Leaders Review Recommendation drive a significant upward movement to a 40% target of women Chairs, I remain vigilant however, as to what will be achieved by the end of 2025.\n\nTony Whiteman IDP-C who joined the IDN Board in late 2021, will be supporting our IDN members. Get to know him!\n\nAfter growing up and being educated in New Zealand, I was given a one-way ticket to the UK to see the world. It was a fun journey experiencing London life, working in an advertising business and the obligatory ‘live/work’ in a pub. Sport has always been a big part of my life and it was rugby which took me to Luxembourg in 1993. I became an FX Dealer and met my wife during enjoyable years in Luxembourg. In 1997 we moved to London where I transitioned into the project management, consultancy field in the City operating independently. After completing an MBA, I embarked on a couple of roles in Interim Management for a corporate services provider and a community website for Physiotherapists. On the private investment side, I developed a small residential property portfolio and helped develop a wholesale insurance broker.\n\nBy 2004 our family had doubled (Oscar & Chloe), and we decided to relocate back to Luxembourg to enjoy the more sedate family life. After three years as Business Development Director for the corporate services provider in Luxembourg I was approached to act as an Independent Director for a number of Blackstone investment vehicles. The relationship with Blackstone has continued and I am currently involved with the Private Equity, Private Debt and\n\nAlternative Asset Management areas as an Independent Director. Over the years I have been engaged as an Independent Director to provide governance for a number of international investment, corporate and family office groups (including Deutsche Bank, Whirlpool, Abbot, SurveyMonkey). In 2014 I completed the INSEAD International Directors Program and became an IDP-C.\n\nI have continued to invest in private residential assets, engaged in personal private equity investment and providing seed capital for a small number of Luxembourg based startups.\n\nThe family has grown with Sophie & Hannah joining us. While the rugby stopped in 2009, I managed to continue competitive cricket representing and captaining Luxembourg till 2021. Golf is now the challenge, its way more difficult than I thought it would be so will keep me focused for many years\n\nto come.\n\nWhile a capitalist society is based on the financially fueled demand/supply functions there is still a real need for community volunteers. I have been involved with both the cricket club and federation committees, assisted the rugby club and have recently helped create the Australia, New Zealand Chamber of Commerce Luxembourg (ANZCCL). Also started mentoring potential Independent Directors via\n\nthe Luxembourg Institute of Directors.\n\nWith the family growing up and reducing the day-to-day need for Mum & Dad to be involved I was happy to consider being a candidate for the IDN Board. I look forward to learning the operations of the IDN Board and supporting the association in developing good governance around the globe via the INSEAD Directors Network.\n\nIn October 2021, INSEAD Directors Network (“IDN”) announced the three winners of the IDN Awards 2021.\n\nThe winner of IDN’s Good Governance Award, new in 2021 for excellence in governance, was Sadia Khan, Commissioner, Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan, MBA 1995, and IDP-C.\n\nSadia has pursued a versatile career path traversing investment banking, financial regulation, family businesses and entrepreneurship across three continents. In addition, she has been a passionate advocate of corporate governance for the past two decades. In 2018, she published The Corporate Governance Landscape of Pakistan, a historical anthology of work already accomplished under the realm of corporate governance as well as a reference book for future regulators, educators, and practitioners.\n\nWhile at the ADB, Sadia helped implement corporate governance reforms in a number of member countries in South East Asia. As a senior member of the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan, she was responsible for implementing the first Code of Corporate Governance in Pakistan. Since then, she has served as a member of various Task Force/Committees responsible for Revising the Code of Corporate Governance and introducing Guidelines for State Owned Enterprises.\n\nAs a corporate governance practitioner, she has served on various boards as an Independent Director. Sadia is also the immediate past global President of the INSEAD Alumni Association and has served as a member of many committees. In addition, she regularly contributes at international conferences and events as a speaker and panellist on issues ranging from multiculturalism to women entrepreneurs.\n\nWe recently asked Sadia for her views on several areas.\n\n1. You have had an illustrious career, working in investment banking, financial regulation, family businesses and entrepreneurship across three continents. You have also written extensively about corporate governance, and you are a corporate governance practitioner. What led to your interest in corporate governance?\n\nMy corporate governance journey began over 25 years ago when I was working with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Manila. The Asian Financial Crises of 1997 brought into focus the important role of corporate governance in averting widespread crises in confidence in financial institutions and the corporate sector. As a result, all the program lending designed by the ADB for its member countries in the aftermath of this crises had a very important component of corporate governance.\n\nSome years later, when I returned to Pakistan to take up a senior position with the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the apex regulator of the Corporate sector, one of the first tasks given to me was to finalize and implement the first Code of Corporate Governance for Pakistan. This was done in 2002 and ever since then, I have been closely involved with the subsequent iterations of the code and its implementation as an educator, regulator and practitioner. I decided to document this in a book entitled “Corporate Governance Landscape of Pakistan” published by Oxford University press in 2017.\n\n2. What lead to your interest in taking on independent director positions?\n\nWhen I initially left public service in 2005, I was approached by many corporate entities in Pakistan to serve as an independent director on their board. They needed somebody familiar with corporate governance policies and practices to steer their companies towards better implementation. The reputation of independence and integrity that I carried from my previous positions enabled me to play a meaningful role and I was progressively approached by more and more corporates over time. For me, it was a great opportunity to get insights into diverse sectors of our economy as well as help implement corporate governance policies that I had helped design in the first place.\n\nI was probably amongst the first Pakistani females to serve as an independent director of large listed companies, even before the provision of diversity was formally introduced in the country in 2017. Incidentally the last chapter of my book on corporate governance dealt with gender diversity on boards, and is seen by many as a precursor to the regulatory provisions introduced later the same year.\n\n3. In your view, what are some of the key factors which leads to a company or organization exhibiting “good governance”?\n\nIn my opinion the “tone from the top” matters a lot and if the board itself and senior management attempts to implement sound corporate governance practices in letter and spirit, that itself helps to inculcate the necessary corporate culture towards compliance with best practices. Unfortunately, most adherence to regulatory provisions vis a vis corporate governance becomes a mere box ticking exercise for the compliance departments of the corporates.\n\nCorporate governance centers around the board, and the board is as good as the people serving on it. Director selection is therefore of the utmost importance to ensure that they have the right level of knowledge, experience, integrity, and independence to make decisions in the interest of all stakeholders.\n\n4. What are some of the areas which companies and their directors should focus on in the coming few years?\n\nApart from being knowledgeable about governance practices, Directors need to continuously educate themselves about emerging trends effecting the corporate sector and indeed the world around them. As such Sustainability or ESG issues need to feature prominently in all board discussions, whether in terms of the corporates own environmental footprint or in terms of its larger role as a member of the community in which it operates. Formalized policies and action plans for Diversity and Inclusion are needed if the companies are to attract and retain the best talent and achieve operational efficiency. Finally, Technology, the threats and opportunities emanating out of its pervasive and expanding use has to remain in focus in all board deliberations.\n\n5. What is your advice to aspiring directors? What should they do to get themselves board-ready?\n\nMost progressive jurisdictions have already recognized the need for diversity in board decision making to achieve optimum outcomes. Board directorships are therefore potentially available for a much broader spectrum of diverse skill sets than in the past. At the same time, much greater responsibilities have been placed on the board directors to play their role in the implementation of sound corporate governance practices as well as comply with the legal and regulatory frameworks within which the institutions operate. As such, those desirous of playing a role in the highest forum of decision making within these institutions need to prepare themselves by demonstrating the appropriate level of knowledge and skills as well as relevant experience to facilitate their induction. They have to take the initiative of obtaining the appropriate director training, build up their portfolios and make it part of their career aspirations, while utilizing the appropriate networking forums at their disposal. Once in a position to become change agents on any board, they have to make sure that decision making is in the hands of a diverse group of innovative minds that not only improves shareholder value, but makes this world a better place.\n\nAs told to Karen Loon, IDN Board Member"
