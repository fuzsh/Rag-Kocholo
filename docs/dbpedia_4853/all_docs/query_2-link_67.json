        "text": "Here it is… The one you’ve all been waiting for… An In Profile special with ECA Treasurer, 110-time England player and all-round curling-expert – John Brown!\n\nJohn has not only had a long and successful career as a player, both in England and Scotland, but has also dedicated an admirable amount of time to the running and up-keep of English Curling. Read on for insight into John’s 50 years of curling experience and many years at the forefront of English Curling.\n\nName: John M L Brown\n\nPosition in team: I have played in all positions in a team – much of the time nowadays I am skip in the various teams I play in, but as a junior lead was my best and favourite position.\n\nYears Curled: I first started curling in 1967 and so I am starting my 51st season though I had a 5 year break in the early 1980s. Have been involved in English Curling since 1982.\n\nHow did you first get into curling?\n\nThe school I attended in Glasgow was across the road from an ice rink and curling was one of the sports offered to pupils from Year 9 upwards. From the list of rugby, cross-country running, swimming, rowing, ten-pin bowling, curling and chess my choice came down to ten-pin bowling or curling – as the curling was cheaper and much closer to school I gave it a try and the rest, they say, is history!\n\nOne of the first people I played with was Ken Bruce – the Radio 2 disc jockey who was a pupil at my school\n\nWhere do you now play most of your curling?\n\nI actually play most of my curling in Scotland at various competitions. I live about 120 miles from Fenton’s Rink in Kent and play there once every two weeks on average but over a season I probably play about 70% of my games in Scotland.\n\nWhat is your best curling memory?\n\nWinning the RCCC Rink Championship, the premier club championship in Scotland while still at school. The total age of our team was 62 which was the age of one of the players we beat in the final. This got us into the National Sunday papers in Scotland.\n\nWhat has been your proudest moment whilst representing England?\n\nOn the ice there are two which I rate equally – qualifying for the World Championship in 1985 and finishing 4th in the World Senior Championships in 2005. We only lost in the semi-final to the USA by 4-2.\n\nAs a member of the ECA, it was hearing that our Junior Women had qualified for the World Championships by winning the European Junior Championships. These were girls I had helped develop from their first steps on the ice and now they were achieving a dream for a country with such a small curling membership and few facilities.\n\nWho is your inspiration?\n\nSir Chris Bonington the mountaineer and explorer continues to climb and travel in his eighties and he has filled his life with so much adventure that I can only stand back in amazement to think that so much can be achieved. You are never too old to climb Everest and if I can continue to curl at a good level as long as he has climbed then I will be happy.\n\nOn a curling rink I have always been a great admirer of my skip at school, Graeme Adam, who has achieved every honour in Scottish Curling and represented Scotland at all levels from Junior to Senior.\n\nWho do you think the best curler in the world is?\n\nIt would be easy here to say that it must be Brad Gushue as he is World Champion but taking a wider look at a lifetime’s achievements by someone who is still playing then it must be Glenn Howard of Canada.\n\nI played against him in the 1987 World Championship and then there he was 25 years later winning the Championship again in 2012. That is an incredible length of time to be able to compete at the very top level and proves that it is not just the physical strength of youth that makes a great curler.\n\nDescribe your pre-match routine.\n\nArrive at rink, change shoes and trousers and go onto the ice. Afraid I have no physical warm up routine though at my age it is probably needed more than many years ago\n\nHave you ever had a curling related disaster?\n\nOn the ice the most disappointing time was losing out on the chance to return to the World Championship in 1986 after we were eliminated in a play-off against France. While we managed to qualify again the following year I can still remember how devastated I felt that we had lost.\n\nOne year, when organising the English Championships, I arranged for a meal to be available at the Ice Rink (Perth) for all the players and supporters after one of the games. When it came to the time to eat nobody wanted to partake because they were playing another game just a couple of hours later! A lesson learnt so that now when organising championships I only deal with the games, the players can organise their own meal breaks!\n\nDo you have any tips for juniors and less experienced curlers?\n\nWhile we all like to look as though we are the World Champion when delivering a stone remember that it is not how you look but where your stone ends up – as in golf, every player has their own delivery (swing) and as long as it works for you then it is a good delivery.\n\nThe best shot you will ever play is the next one – don’t look back and say I could have done better, look forward and say I will do better.\n\nWhat do you do when you aren’t curling?\n\nDuring the curling off-season I spent a lot of time going to watch all forms of motor racing (except Formula 1 which is not really racing!) all around the country. I have an extensive library (a large part of which is about motor racing and exploration/climbing) which always provides me with something interesting to read and I have recently resurrected my interest in stamp collecting.\n\nI have an interest in a diverse range of music and go to festivals/concerts regularly and I have a comprehensive collection of LPs and cassettes as well as CDs.\n\nI also see myself as the unofficial archivist of the ECA and maintain a pretty complete record of most things to do with the sport in England!\n\nI can also be persuaded to help look after our garden, do the odd domestic chore etc.. My wife still works and so I currently act as a bit of a househusband!\n\nWhat are your strengths and weaknesses on the ice?\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\nAbility to play in any position in a team and to be happy playing in that position\n\nKnowledge of many game set-ups and situations from years of playing\n\nAble to recognise when it is my fault that my stone has not finished where I wanted it to be, and not the fault of the sweepers/skip\n\nAble to sweep on both sides of the stone – helps if the other sweeper is only able to sweep on one side\n\nWEAKNESSES\n\nIf I told you my weaknesses then I would have to kill you so as not to reveal them to others!\n\nWhat do you love about curling?\n\nI love the thrill of being able to deliver a large lump of rock with delicacy to a specific point on the surface of a sheet of ice. The thrill of drawing precisely to the button or of hitting and getting a perfect roll never leave me – even more so these days as they seem to happen less often!\n\nThe only people I am still in touch with from my school days are those I curled with – you have a long life in the sport if you want it – it is maybe a cliché but you CAN play curling from 8 to 80 and play it with the same people at either end of your playing days, even if some of those have gone off and become World Champions. It gives me a few more years to keep on playing and hoping to win!\n\nJohn M L Brown bio\n\nCurrently Treasurer, World Curling Federation representative and Competitions Convenor for the English Curling Association (ECA). Previously President and Secretary of the ECA and also Chairman of the British Curling Association in the lead up to the 2006 Olympics.\n\nScottish Schools Champion 3 times, Scottish Rink Championships winner, English National Champion 4 times, English Senior Champion 3 times and English Mixed Doubles Champion once.\n\nRepresented England at 12 European Championships, 2 World Championships and 9 World Senior Championships and coached a variety of teams at Senior, Junior, Mixed Doubles and National level.\n\nEUROPEAN JUNIOR CHALLENGE\n\nAfter 6 previous attempts the England Junior Women qualified for the World Junior Championship with a fairly dominant display at the European Junior Challenge in Prague. A look at their scores emphasises how much better they were than the majority of the other teams they met, but it was the semi-final against Hungary that was a true measure of their improved quality and maturity. After wins by 14-1 against Spain, 9-1 against Slovenia and 8-1 against Slovakia there were two narrow wins against Poland (5-2) and Turkey (4-2) before a defeat by Italy (2-7) in the last round robin game when they had already guaranteed finishing top in their group.\n\nA quarter –final win against Latvia by 7-1 was followed by their toughest game of the competition against Hungary who were runners-up last year. It was 5-2 for England after 6 ends and then Hungary scored 3 at the 7th leaving Hetty Garnier with a hit and stick to win the game in the 8th end which she did perfectly. Against Turkey in the final it was back to routine with a staggering 9-1 win in just 6 ends rounding off an incredible week and sending the girls to the World Championships in Estonia at the beginning of March.\n\nCongratulations to Hetty Garnier, Angharad Ward, Naomi Robinson, Lucy Sparks and Niamh Fenton who were ably coached by Sara Jahodova. Unfortunately Sara cannot go to Estonia with them as coach owing to work commitments but they will be coached there by John Sharp who has worked with the majority of the team at the European Championships over the past couple of seasons.\n\nSix years ago John Brown took the first team of English girls to play in an International Competition to the European Junior Challenge in Copenhagen. Three times previously, (1993, 1998 and 1999) a team of boys had qualified to play in the World Championships with a best finish of 8th in both 1993 and 1998. They had had to play in a World Championship Challenge at that time as well – though their performance in 1998 qualified them direct for the Worlds in 1999.\n\nBut this was something new – since the opening of Fenton’s Rink in 2004 there had been a steady flow of junior curlers and now we had found a girl’s team to go out and challenge the World – well the rest of Europe initially! Here they are at Fenton’s before they set off:\n\nLeft to right – Anna Fowler (skip), Sophie Hickling (3rd), Kate McKenzie (2nd), Naomi Robinson (lead / alternate), Hetty Garnier (lead / alternate)\n\nAnd they had their supporting entourage as well – John Brown, Vicky McKenzie, Jules Fowler and Felicity Robinson all ready to wave the flags for England.\n\nIt was a small field that year – just 11 countries – and so the girls teams were split into 2 groups – we were in a group of 5 along with France, Germany, Finland and Slovakia – a tough task for our inexperienced team but they got off to the best possible start when they defeated Slovakia by 9-1! The Slovakians had played in a previous year and so had some experience at this level and so for Anna and her team this was an unbelievable start and spirits rose. One interesting thing about the Slovakian team was that at least 3 of them were deaf and they used various hand signals for sweeping calls.\n\nAfter a session off it was Finland next and reality struck hard – we were 7-0 down after 2 ends and eventually lost 11-2 after 7. Next it was France and 9-0 down after 2 ends led to a 16-3 defeat. Finally Germany and a 12-0 defeat after 6!! So a chastening end to a week that started off well but lessons were learnt and thoughts turned to Prague a year later.\n\nOne thing that was required was a coach and we found one in the form of Ian Baxter, who was living down South and playing at Fenton’s – Scottish Junior Champion in 1990 with Graeme Connal he went to Prague with a revised team. Sophie and Kate were gone and replaced by Lauren Pearce and Madeline Tuz, 2 more graduates from the Fenton’s junior programme. Hetty had moved to third and Naomi to second.\n\nHopes were high that progress would be made in a 10 team competition that meant 9 round-robin games before the play-offs – a tough schedule. By the end of the week though all dreams had been shattered when the team failed to register a win – Finland (3-7), Slovakia (4-8), Denmark (0-12), Italy (5-6), Spain (7-8), Norway (4-9), Germany (5-6), Estonia (4-6) and Poland (3-7). There were some close games in there though – the Spanish loss was at an extra end – but still some first end nightmares ( losing a 6 v Norway for example).\n\nIan Baxter was unable to commit to another year and so we approached Greg Dunn, a Canadian who was playing at Fenton’s and had experience of coaching / junior curling at home. Another Canadian recruit was a young girl, just 15 years old, who had been brought up in British Columbia and had taken up curling and been to various camps etc. over there. Her father is English and so when she appeared at Fenton’s, having moved to a village just 15 minutes away, she was eligible to represent England without any wait to achieve residency qualifications. Her name was Angharad Ward and she was immediately drafted into the team in place of Madeline Tuz.\n\nIt was back to Prague in 2011 and the new coach made his mark by getting the whole team (and the boy’s team) to do some runs around the rink as a penalty for being late for a meeting! John Brown also accompanied them on this occasion and we began to see that week the beginnings of the progress which had been absent the previous year. Another tough week with 8 games to be played in the round-robin and things did not start well – 2-6 v Spain and 1-10 v Italy, but then a win – against Slovakia by 8-3 and hopes rose. A loss against the top team, Germany, was followed by a second victory, against Estonia by 5-2, and then another one – 4-2 v Poland. Finally two more defeats – 3-5 v Norway and 0-6 v Denmark. So 3 wins and 5 losses and still not troubling the top teams – but the team were starting to understand the nuances of the game and to get the experience of International competition.\n\nCopenhagen called in 2012 and Greg needed some help and up stepped Kerr Alexander – nominally to coach the boys’ team but also assisting Greg with the girls. Angharad was unable to play this year as she was involved in the Winter Youth Olympics for the GB team and was needed for pre-Games practice and so Lucy Sparks came in as alternate. This was also Anna’s last year and she meant to go out on a high.\n\nLeft to right – Greg Dunn Lucy Sparks, Lauren Pearce, Naomi Robinson, Hetty Garnier and Anna Fowler. Compare to the last picture!!!\n\nNine teams again and another 8 game round-robin. This year wins were recorded against Denmark (5-2), Slovakia (6-2), Hungary (9-4), Spain (6-3), Poland (6-5) and Germany (8-6) and there were two defeats by Italy (3-5 after extra end) and Estonia (3-8). However this meant that England finished second in the round-robin and would play a semi-final against Denmark. This was a very low-scoring game with neither side willing to gamble but eventually Denmark won by 3-1though they then lost in the final to Italy who therefore went to the Worlds.\n\nIt was back to Prague in 2013 and the major change was, of course, that Anna was no longer a junior, and neither was Lauren, and so Hetty stepped up to the mark to lead the team, Angharad returned to the team at third, Naomi stayed at second, Lucy moved in at lead and Niamh Fenton was the new alternate. Neither Greg nor Kerr was able to commit the time to travel with the team and so John Brown and Andrew Woolston were this year’s coaches for both the girls and the boys.\n\nThere were 12 teams split into 2 groups of 6 and it started off extremely well, when following a close defeat by Hungary (3-4), there was a win over old rivals Denmark by 5-3 in a game where Hetty was marked as playing 95%. However this was followed by a 3-10 defeat by Poland although a victory over Latvia by 6-4 meant that there was still a chance of finishing in the top 2 of the group if Turkey could be beaten, but this was not to be and a 5-3 victory for Turkey left England 4th in the group when a win would actually have meant that they finished top based on the DSC which would have been needed to separate them from Denmark and Hungary. So 3 wins out of 5 – close but still not there.\n\nIt was a new venue for 2014 – Lohja in Finland and while the team stayed the same the coach changed again and Sara Jahodova was recruited. Sara is from the Czech Republic and has played for her country at the World Championship , though she currently lives in England. Her partner, Radek Bohac provided some assistance but it was a tough time for her to look after 2 teams.\n\nOnce again there were 12 teams divided into 2 groups of 6 and the English campaign got off to the worst possible start when they ran out of time in the first game against Hungary and automatically lost the game! However, the girls bounced back and won their next 4 games – Germany (4-3), Latvia (7-2), Estonia (6-4) and Finland (13-0) to finish second behind Hungary and next was a quarter-final v Norway which was won well by 8-2 but the semi-final against Italy saw a disappointing 2-9 loss. With a bronze medal at stake in their final game they won an extra end decision against Poland and those medals by 7-6. So all the time it was getting closer but time was running out a little bit – astonishingly Hetty had now played in 6 EJCC but she still had three years eligibility left, as had Angharad and Lucy, but Naomi was done to just 2 and so 2015 would be a critical year.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history!!!\n\nWCF CONGESS, RENO\n\nThe World Curling Federation Congress in Reno was attended by our WCF representatives, Alison Arthur and John Brown. John was also there as a member of the WCF Competition and Rules Commission.\n\nRULE CHANGES\n\nA number of changes were made to Competition Rules which will affect our Championships and the International Championships in which our teams participate.\n\nA number of the rules of the game were tidied up for consistency and a number of penalties were inserted into the rule book where there had been gaps previously. The main change to the rules of the game is that as soon as a stone is burnt after it has crossed the hog line at the playing end then no sweeping is allowed by either team of any stones.\n\nWith regard to the Competitions and Competition Rules the major changes are:\n\nThe European Mixed Championships will be replaced by a World Mixed Championship (open entry) from 2015-16.\n\nThe European, Pacific and American Junior Challenges will be replaced by a World Junior B Championship from 2015-16 – to be held at the same time as the current competitions (first week in January) and all flights will continue to be paid by the WCF.\n\nRules for Mixed curling will be added to the Rule Book– no changes to what are used at the moment but there are no rules for Mixed curling in the current rulebook – main rules – alternate gender play, skip and vice-skip must be of different genders, no alternates allowed.\n\nThe current ‘playing time’ system used when timeclocks are being used will be replaced by ‘thinking time’. A team’s clock will not run during the time the stone is in play but only during the period between the previous opponent’s stone coming to rest and your stone being delivered. The limit will be 38 minutes per team for a 10 end game, 32 minutes for an 8 end game. This will start from the European Championships in November 2014.\n\nWhen time clocks are being used a team will be able to call one time-out per game. This time-out will last for 1 minute plus the travel time from the coaches’ bench to the head which will be determined for each end of the ice at each venue and announced at the team meeting. This will start from the European Championships in November 2014.\n\nThere will be no more than one round of tie break games in any Championship – beginning immediately.\n\nThe Last Stone Draw procedure before the start of a game will be modified from 1st January 2015 (thus affecting the Junior Challenge). Two LSD stones will be thrown by a player before a game rather than one – one with each rotation and each player in a team must throw a minimum number of times during the round robin stages of a Championship.\n\nA new system will be introduced in 2015-16 for measuring LSD stones that cover or partially cover the button. This will involve two measurements rather than one.\n\nJohn will be happy to explain these rules further if required. The final detailed wording will be included in the new WCF rule book to be printed by end October.\n\nOTHER BUSINESS\n\nQatar and Hong Kong have been approved as Conditional members of the WCF\n\nKate Caithness of Scotland was elected unopposed for another 4 years as WCF President. Also appointed were Bent Ramsfjell of Norway as Vice President (Europe), Graham Prouse of Canada as VP (Americas) and Hugh Millikin of Australia as VP (Pacific and Asia). Four other directors appointed were Hew Chalmers (Scotland), Andy Anderson (USA), Laura Lochanski (Canada) and Toyu Ogawa (Japan).\n\nThe subscription levels which are graded according to membership numbers were changed and England will now pay $400 per year rather than $200. But we will now have 4 votes as opposed to 2, though still only 2 representatives.\n\nSochi in Russia will host the World Senior and World Mixed Doubles Championships in April 2015.\n\nBy John Brown."
