        "text": "COBNER, David\n\nDean and Director of Sport at Cardiff Metropolitan University for over 20 years, Dave developed and managed one of the largest and most successful sport departments in the UK and in 2016 was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame for services to Welsh sport. During his tenure, the Cardiff School of Sport expanded rapidly and his introduction of high-performance sport coaches and support staff resulted in ground-breaking community sport development programmes. Additionally, Dave has a long and varied career as a teacher educator, sports coach, coach educator and sport scientist. He coached rugby at the University, was Wales U21 Rugby Squad fitness coach for six years and is Chair of Wales Deaf Rugby.\n\nThompson, Steve MBE\n\nSteve Thompson played 73 times for England at hooker, and in 2003 won both the Grand Slam and most memorably the Rugby World Cup beating Australia in Sydney 20-17 with the now infamous extra time drop goal from Jonny Wilkinson. Steve, who played his club rugby for Northampton, Saints (with whom he won the Heineken Cup in 2000), Leeds, Wasps and Brive, and also won three British Lions caps during the 2005 tour to New Zealand. In December 2020, aged just 42, Steve revealed that he had been diagnosed with early onset dementia and probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). He has spoken how his condition means he can’t remember playing the RWC final and can struggle to remember his wife’s name and the names of his four children. He is part of the action against World Rugby and the RFU, and in September 2021 Thompson decided to donate his brain for CTE research.\n\nBilly, who retired due to concussion in 2018, tragically took his own life aged just 33 in May 2023, after suffering with ongoing issues that affected his mental health He became a posthumous member of Progressive Rugby in May 2024 with the blessing of his dad John and mum Stacey. Billy, who played for the Hurricanes, Crusaders and Blues and Māori All Black as a scrum half had suffered with numerous symptoms, and had been particularly crippled with anxiety, depression, mental confusion, light aversion and serious memory lapses. Following his death he was found Stage 2 Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), making Billy the first New Zealand professional rugby player to be diagnosed with the degenerative brain disease neuroscientists believe is linked to repetitive brain injury and contact sports. “It’s stories like Billy’s that fuel our drive to keep lobbying governing bodies for the off-field changes that can mitigate the risk to players at all levels of this wonderful game,” Professor John Fairclough at Progressive Rugby said.\n\nFormer lock/backrower Kiebie Smith is the first South African rugby player to go public with his diagnosis of early onset dementia and probable CTE. Growing up with a rugby ball in his pram, he was a ballboy at Loftus Versfield and started playing aged six. He played for the Blue Bulls U17 Youth, U18 Schools and U19 and U21 sides alongside future Springboks. After stopping playing at 25 due to neck trauma, Smith has suffered two strokes, suicidal thoughts, mood swings, anxiety, crippling migraines, blackouts and balance issues. He has no intentions of taking legal action against South Africa Rugby but is passionate about helping support other players and educating current players about looking after themselves.\n\nLisa is Head of Department of Sport, Exercise and Nutrition at the Atlantic Technological University (formerly the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT)), Ireland. She is currently leading a European Project focused on Females Concussion Education and Awareness in Sport. Lisa holds a first-class honours degree in Nutritional Science and completed her PhD in Nutritional Biochemistry at University College Cork (UCC), Ireland. She has worked as a lecturer at Bournemouth University, Oxford Brookes University and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Outside of her formal academic role Lisa has worked as a sports nutritionist for a number of rugby, hockey and AFL teams. Recent research projects have included a focus on understanding concussion across a range of sports.\n\nPETERS, Sam\n\nSam was rugby correspondent at the Mail on Sunday between 2013 and 2017, when he spearheaded their concussion in rugby campaign. During that period he was named in 2015 as one of Rugby World’s five most influential media figures and has been credited with changing rugby’s culture around head injuries while campaigning for improved player welfare. His unrelenting desire that player welfare be the game he love’s number one focus is inspiring.\n\nGOUGH, Ian\n\nAn abrasive second row, Ian Gough played for Pontypridd, Newport, NG Dragons, Ospreys and London Irish and made his debut for Wales against South Africa in 1998. Over the next 11 years he would go on to play 64 times for his country, including as a member of the 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. On the occasion of his 50th cap, Gough led Wales out for what was to be the game they clinched the 2008 Grand Slam, as Wales went on to beat France 29-12 in Cardiff. He announced his retirement from playing in May 2015.\n\nPeter’s world was turned upside down in 2011 when his 14-year-old son Benjamin died following a school rugby match. Ben was treated and assessed multiple times during the match for Head Injuries and on each occasion was permitted to play on. In the final minutes of the game Ben was knocked out and tragically never regained Consciousness (Second Impact Syndrome). The resulting inquest highlighted the need for more Education and Awareness around Concussion/Brain Injury in Schools. Since then, Peter has campaigned to raise awareness of the danger of concussion and brain injuries for young sportspeople and has been a constant voice behind the “If in doubt, sit them out” campaign that has taken hold in Scotland. He believes there should be mandatory concussion lessons in schools, just as there is now mandatory CPR training. In addition, Peter is on the Scottish concussion advisory board, and works with the Edinburgh University thinktank on concussion.\n\nCarl Hayman is a former New Zealand international who won 45 caps for the All Blacks at tighthead prop, playing against the British Lions in 2005 and in RWC 2007. Widely considered as one of the greatest tightheads of all time, he was known for his incredible strength, known for being able to box squat a staggering 250kg. After playing for Otago and Highlanders, he moved to the Newcastle Falcons in the UK before playing more than 150 games for Toulon, with whom he won the Heineken European Cup three times. He retired aged 35 in 2015, and aged 41 he was diagnosed with early onset dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) after being tested due to relentless headaches that had led to alcohol abuse, erratic behaviour and suicidal thoughts. Carl was only knocked out once during his career but is believed to have received in excess of 150,000 sub concussive blows during his 441-game career. He now campaigns for better protection for players and believes changes are needed to secure the future of the game. Carl is one of a number of players suing World Rugby and the RFU.\n\nCHRISTIE, Shane\n\nA hugely committed backrower, Shane played for Nelson and Tasman Mako before in 2013, aged 28, he was awarded a contract with the hugely successful Crusaders franchise where he competed for a shirt with the likes of Richie McCaw and Kieran Read. With limited opportunities, the following season Shane joined the Highlanders, where he immediately flourished and was part of the squad which lifted the Super Rugby title in 2015. The following season Shane was named co-captain alongside All Black Ben Smith. Shane has also represented the All Black Sevens and the Māori All Blacks. In 2018 Shane was forced to retire, aged 32, because of multiple concussions and campaigns passionately for player welfare in memory of his close friend and fellow professional Billy Guyton who was found to have CTE after tragically taking his own life in May 2023 aged 33.\n\nVictoria is an academic, researcher, and lecturer in Criminology at Swansea University and has spent 16 years researching violence in contact sports. Her recent work has focused on harms associated with contact sport such as the commodification and consumerism of sport in late capitalist society; as well as the prevalence of prescription drug use, depression, suicide, and brain injury. She is co-founder of SCORSS, The Swansea Centre of Research into Sport and Society, and has conducted interviews with local, national & international media on the topic of violence and concussion in sports. In 2023, she spoke at Hay Festival on ‘The Crisis in Concussion: How can Sport Respond?’\n\nStevie Ward played for Leeds Rhinos, becoming a three-time Super League champion and two-time Challenge Cup winner by 26 and was firmly on England’s radar. But on 2nd February 2020 he played his last game after suffering his second concussion in two weeks. While desperate to return to his boyhood club he suffered with migraines, dizziness, nausea, and sensitivity to light and noise. He retired from the game he loved in January 2021 and is now an outspoken and passionate advocate for player welfare.\n\nA talented flanker, Low went straight into professional rugby from school having already been identified by London Irish. Aged just 22, he made his debut for Scotland from the bench in November 2013 against Australia - a game he remembers little of after being concussed in his first carry but completed the match. During his career he also played for Glasgow Warriors and Saracens and added a further four caps before retiring in 2016 aged just 25 because of post concussion syndrome.\n\nThree-time capped Canadian Cameron Pierce is a board member of Provale (the French version of the RPA) alongside familiar names including Louis Picamoles and Guilhem Guirado. Having played Top 14 rugby with Pau, Cameron received a brain injury which resulted in memory problems, chronic migraines, insomnia and mood swings. He never played again. Cameron is one of the members of a lawsuit against the French Rugby Federation (FFR) and the National Rugby League (LNR) accusing the bodies of breaching safety and information obligations on concussion.\n\nWOODARD, Lenny\n\nBorn and bred in Wales, Woodard was a prolific winger who went on to play both rugby union and rugby league for his country. Academically-gifted, Woodard studied at Cardiff Metropolitan University where he was selected for Wales U21 (union), Wales Students (league) and Great Britain students (league).
