        "text": "The cultural landscape of Saudi Arabia is being enriched as the entertainment sector undergoes significant expansion.\n\n‘ARAB NEWS’ stated that the ambitious Saudi Vision 2030, which strives to diversify the economy and increase global engagement, is the driving force behind this broader cultural transformation.\n\nThe Saudi Vision 2030 is a Government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which aims to achieve the goal of increased diversification economically, socially and culturally in line with the vision of Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nOne prime example of the Kingdom’s initiatives aimed at propelling the entertainment sector is the Qiddiya giga project.\n\nLaunched in 2018 under the leadership of King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Qiddiya is an emerging capital for entertainment, sports and culture that aims to build destinations, programs and initiatives based on the power of play that will enhance the quality of life of the visitors and the residents.\n\nEntertainment Galore\n\n‘ARAB NEWS’ further stated that Qiddiya is just one of several large-scale entertainment projects in the Kingdom but dubbed the ‘Capital of Entertainment, Sports and the Arts’ there is no doubting its importance as one of the cornerstones of the sector.\n\nThe Canadian company AtkinsRéalis is the lead design consultancy for the project and the firm’s Global Director of Creative, Theming and Show Design Bradley Caruk set out his vision for Qiddiya.\n\nCommented Caruk, “Having worked in the global entertainment industry for the past 25 years, I have learnt we are all the same. Everyone wants to have fun. With major innovative parks like the Six Flags Qiddiya City (the largest theme park in the Middle East which is under construction), we have the unexpected – a fully immersive story-driven theme park experience.”\n\nCaruk added that the attraction will have “the world’s tallest, longest, fastest rides” and said, “We even support the storyline further by including original music compositions.”\n\nThe AtkinsRéalis Group Inc., previously known as the SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., is a Canadian company based in Montreal (City in Canada) that provides engineering, procurement and construction services to various industries, including mining and metallurgy, environment and water, infrastructure, and clean energy.\n\nSector expert Jamie Ryder, a partner at Entertainment & Media Industry Group at law firm Reed Smith, said that Qiddiya has a huge amount of “disruptive potential”.\n\nHe said, “In terms of Qiddiya’s disruptive potential, this is immediately clear when considering the sheer scale of the development. When complete, Qiddiya will be home to over 600,000 residents and aims to attract 48 million visits per year.”\n\nRemarked Ryder, “In addition to the specific, innovative – and in the case of the Dragon Ball theme park – the world’s first attractions Qiddiya will host, the focus on ‘play’ throughout the development, and the ability to host major sporting and entertainment events in cutting-edge venues means that Qiddiya’s disruptive potential is significant.”\n\nYoung Population\n\nOf those collaborations and partnerships that have been announced so far, it is very easy to quickly see the alignment with various elements of the Vision 2030 as well as reflecting the fact that the Saudi society is a young, connected and vibrant population.\n\nRyder highlighted the Dragon Ball theme park – based on the popular Japanese animated series – as something that will appeal directly to the young people in the Kingdom and beyond.\n\nHe noted, “Anime is incredibly popular in KSA with Saudi reported as having the largest share of anime viewers worldwide. With the UAE second in the world rankings for anime viewership this promises to be a popular attraction enticing the tourists from across the region.”\n\nRyder also cited the Six Flags theme park being the first outside of the Americas appealing to both the Saudi youth and the visitors.\n\nHe said one of the jewels in the crown of Qiddiya will be the Speed Park Track which garnered significant attention in the motor racing world when the design was unveiled. The attraction comes as the popularity of Formula 1 in the region grows.\n\nMaintained Ryder, “Add to this mix the cutting-edge mixed-use Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Stadium and the dedicated gaming and esports neighborhood and it is clear to see how Qiddiya will offer world-class attractions and experiences to the locals and the tourists.”\n\nLondon (UK)-based the Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA – governing body for many auto racing events, including Formula One).\n\nDestinations Unto Itself\n\nSeveral firms in the industry recognize Saudi Arabia’s vision of developing top attractions and world-class entertainment destinations in line with the high bar set from the big parks that have been around for over 50 years.\n\nFrom the AtkinsRéalis point of view, Caruk emphasized that the company’s multidisciplinary teams understand guests’ expectations and work towards exceeding those expectations – “We work as one team but there are hundreds of us taking a concept and turning it into a reality – all with a common goal to make experiences memorable and timely. When we hear the phrase ‘That was awesome, can we go back there again’ that’s when we know we’ve done something right. Nothing like witnessing guests leaving our designed theme park with a sense of awe and a desire to return. We expect to hear a lot of these reactions in the years to come.”\n\nHe was keen to emphasize the pride his firm has in working on the project, saying, “Our commitment to Saudi’s Vision 2030 is unwavering and we value our partnership with Qiddiya where we contribute to creating unparalleled fun.”\n\nEconomic Diversification\n\nThere is no doubt that Qiddiya plays a major role in Saudi Arabia’s 2030 vision aiming to become a leading destination for entertainment, work, sports, and daily life.\n\nWhile economic diversification is at the heart of Vision 2030, promoting culture and entertainment in the Kingdom was included as one of the key goals for Vision 2030 when it was first announced in 2016.\n\nA vibrant society, thriving economy and an ambitious nation are three key pillars of the Vision.\n\nFrom Reed Smith’s viewpoint, Ryder said, “As such, the role of Qiddiya is not just about economic diversification but, like so many of the projects in KSA, it is about enhancing the quality of life for the Saudi citizens and the tourists alike with the Quality of Life also being one of the Vision 2023 key Vision Realization Programs.”\n\nHe added, “The Quality of Life VRP was launched in 2018 with the aim of transforming Saudi Arabia into a world-renowned sports and entertainment location and a global tourism hotspot and there can be little doubt that Qiddiya is a key element of this program.”\n\nFrom AtkinsRéalis’ perspective, Caruk believes the Qiddiya City will be a “premier destination” for play, adding, “It has something for everyone – a rarity in this region. The complexity and diversity of experiences across the whole development are truly remarkable and will also set a precedent for future developments across the globe.”\n\nConcluded Caruk, “Today, entertainment is a multibillion-dollar industry and Qiddiya will play a major role in helping realize people’s dreams. At AtkinsRéalis, we feel fortunate to be hands-on and part of this groundbreaking project.”\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
