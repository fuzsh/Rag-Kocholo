        "text": "Czech soccer’s MOL Cup will be covered domestically by pay-TV’s O2 TV for the next five seasons.\n\nThe knockout competition, title sponsored by MOL, will move away from Česká Televize, the public-service broadcaster that held rights during the last cycle.\n\nThe new deal runs from the start of 2024-25, through 2028-29.\n\nThe 2024-25 MOL Cup was won by Sparta Prague, who beat Viktoria Plzeň in the final.\n\nO2 TV will also cover the top-tier Czech Fortuna Liga for the next five seasons, through a deal agreed last November.\n\nIn the last few months, international betting streaming rights to the top two Czech leagues have been snapped up by the Pragosport agency, while betting company Chance has been named as the title sponsor of the competitions for the next five seasons.\n\nChance, owned by Tipsport, will pay CZK250 million ($10.5 million) per year, with the deal covering the 2024-25 to 2028-29 cycle. The firm will replace rival betting company Fortuna, the league's title sponsor since the 2018-19 season.\n\nIn early June, meanwhile, the Czech league’s governing body launched a tender process covering rights to produce highlights and short-form clips from the next three seasons of the top-tier league."
