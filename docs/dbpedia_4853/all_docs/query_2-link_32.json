        "text": "Milwaukee Ballet II (MBII) is a unique program designed to take excellent ballet students and transform them into artists, ready for a professional career. Dancers from around the world are offered daily training with their own artistic staff led by Artistic Director Mireille Favarel (France) and Rehearsal Director Davit Hovhannisyan (Armenia). In addition to classes with the Company and artistic staff, there are multiple opportunities for master classes with visiting choreographers and guest teachers from various disciplines.\n\nThis program provides a safe place for growth, experimentation, and achievement in dance through rigorous training and performance opportunities. Developed in 1978, MBII has graduated dancers who have danced all over the country, who run their own companies and dance projects, who now make up over 60% of our own professional Company, and others who have gone on to new adventures and career paths.\n\nOver the course of a season with MBII dancers learn to live on their own and become a strong, united team working together for shared goals and individual dreams. They learn to advocate for their art form and to work with all kinds of people. They are in an environment where they can experiment with their artistry, open their minds and push their personal boundaries. They leave being ready for the professional worldâ€”in dance and in other areas."
