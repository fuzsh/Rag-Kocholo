        "text": "The CZRLA have announced a change in the position of national team coach, effective immediately. Milan Mrtynek has resigned from the on-field role although he will remain in the position of General Secretary of the governing body.\n\nAndrew Mulhall has taken over and his first duty will be to take the reins this Saturday for a friendly match against Catalonia XIII in Prague.\n\nAustralian born, long-term Czech resident Mulhall – currently one of two RLEF part-time Development Officers in the Republic – played for the inaugural Czech representative team in 2006 against the British Pioneers and, until this season, was the only player to have participated in every match undertaken by the national side.\n\nMrtynek cited an increasingly arduous work schedule for his inability to continue as coach and looked forward to change bringing fresh enthusiasm to the Czech RL scene.\n\nMulhall stated that he felt privileged to be offered the role in his adopted country and looked forward to guiding the expanding pool of domestically produced players onto the international stage.\n\n“I think that this is a pivotal point in Czech RL development,” he stated. “The Czech team is increasingly being made up of RL first players, as opposed to union players playing league during their summer break. I will endeavour to push this process along, starting with upcoming matches against Catalonia and Germany.”\n\n“Despite the limited amount of time we have available to us for preparation, I am confident that this is the route that will lead to the long-term consolidation of rugby league in the Czech Republic.”\n\n“I would like to thank Milan for all the hard work he has put in over the last five years in the face of a myriad of different challenges and I look forward to continuing to work with him as we solidify Czech RL development.”"
