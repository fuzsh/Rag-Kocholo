        "text": "In From the Vault, World Lacrosse is highlighting classic games from its world championships.\n\nIreland handed Hong Kong, China its first loss in Towson, 12-11, in overtime in one of the games of the championship so far.\n\nIreland led 8-6 heading into the fourth quarter, but Hong Kong scored four unanswered goals to take a two-goal lead in the fourth quarter. Trailing two with 3:45 to play, Ireland staged a furious comeback that ended with a dramatic free position shot from Cliodhna Kerr with seven seconds remaining.\n\nKerr went on to score the winner just 54 seconds into overtime on a pass from Margaret Egan. Kerr scored the last three goals of the game to finish with six, while Egan ended with seven assists, the most in a game in the championship."
