        "text": "Transport\n\nOur expertise in all forms of transport continues to bring us a huge range of projects. Our skills in rail systems, tunnelling, bridges, infrastructure finance and project management has enabled us to establish a position as one of the rail sectorâs leading players. We've added the Bergen light rail extension in Norway to our portfolio of metro projects, following ongoing work on similar light rail systems in the Netherlands, Azerbaijan and Czech Republic.\n\nWe led the design of a rail line in Bulgaria, while in Poland we upgraded a rail line for higher train speeds and supervising design and installation of European Train Control System signalling on the E65 railway between Warsaw and Katowice.\n\nWeâre at the forefront of the UKâs resurgent rail sector with leading roles on the countryâs principal projects â High Speed Two, Crossrail, East London Line, London Underground station upgrades, Thameslink upgrade and the Northern Hub project.\n\nIn the highways sector, we supervised construction of 70km of the motorway between Sofia and the port of Burgas and are managing the countryâs Transit Roads Project IV, involving upgrading, rehabilitation and reconstruction of 660km of roads. We're developing an integrated transport plan to improve sustainability and safety in Sofia.\n\nIn the UK our teams are working on projects for both Highways Agency and local councils, helping save money, satisfy briefs faster and improve conditions for drivers as well as save carbon.\n\nBuildings\n\nWe play a key role in the drive to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions from buildings â proven in a number of projects in UK such as the offices for Google in London, Amsterdam, and Dublin.\n\nIn the UK we helped two buildings attain the highest sustainability rating Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) âOutstandingâ â the Dogs Trust new rehoming centre and the Houghton-le-Spring Primary Care Centre, the first healthcare building to achieve this rating.\n\nWe were appointed as project manager for Abu Dhabi Plaza, Astana, Kazakhstan. The mixed-use scheme is 500,000sq m and consists of four levels of basement car parking, a retail podium and five towers.\n\nInfrastructure finance\n\nOur offices in Paris and Istanbul have achieved rapid success in the continentâs public private finance market.\n\nWe are established as the leading infrastructure finance consultancy in French-speaking Europe, with a portfolio including an 80,000 seat venue for the FÃ©dÃ©ration FranÃ§aise de Rugby, the iconic Nice Eco Stadium, and the Olympic-standard national velodrome at St Quentin, Paris. In Belgium, weâre engaged on prisons, hospitals, schools, renewable energy, highways and waste management projects.\n\nAdding to our track record in Turkeyâs airport sector, we developed the countryâs first ever healthcare public private partnership (PPP), the â¬440 million Kayseri Integrated Health Campus. This is the first of 28 planned PPP health campus projects in Turkey.\n\nEnergy\n\nWe continue to play a pivetol role in the privately financed renewable energy market, with wind turbine projects in Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, Spain and Turkey, and hydropower projects in Georgia, Albania and Turkey.\n\nAssisting with energy market reform in the Balkans, we have an ongoing role providing technical advice during privatisation of Kosovoâs Power Distribution & Supply Company and we are developing stronger regulation and pricing for Turkeyâs Energy Regulatory Authority.\n\nWe carried out planning, scheduling and cost estimating for the PyhÃ¤joki nuclear power plant in Finland, helping reduce technical and commercial risk for client Fennovoima Oy. In Hungary, we designed and supervised construction of the Bataapati nuclear waste repository serving the Park power station.\n\nIn the UK we've been working with National Grid on two electricity substation alliances, as well as maintaining and upgrading the gas transmission network.\n\nWater\n\nWe are working to improve water supply and quality while reducing the cost of operating and maintaining water and sewerage infrastructure with projects in Bulgaria, Ireland, and Romania.\n\nIn the UK we have close relationships with many of the countryâs water utilities including Thames Water, Anglian Water and Yorkshire Water, helping them meet regulatory requirements while finding cost and quality benefits through innovation.\n\nFollowing a major project in Albania to evaluate the safety of 195 dams supplying irrigation, the World Bank appointed us to study the economic feasibility of constructing 14 new agricultural dams."
