Came here with friends tons of times and always had a blast drinking, dancing, listening to great live music, and singing karaoke. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys fun and reasonably priced drinks.\n\nDee B\n\nDecent place to have a pint Fun bar. There are 3 floors but only the main and upstairs were open when we went. Top floor had younger folks doing karaoke. Main had a decent singer. Good place to have a pint\n\nPub Monster Neil\n\nGreat Irish pub, great staff My twin brother and I were exploring around the wonderful Old Town ( Stare Mesto ) of Prague when we decided to drop into Durty Nelly's ,been here before on previous holidays to Prague, always had a good time and so it proved on our latest visit. I love the look of this pub, interior is superb, multiple floors ,multi roomed ,great decor and furnishings, cool looking serving bar's,big screens to enjoy the sport and plenty of seating options spread throughout this pub, its just a really good pub to unwind in. We were here on a Thursday night, pub was packed with a great atmosphere, Sparta Prague v Liverpool F.C playing, vibrant atmosphere in this pub,we enjoyed pints of classic Czech pilsner, served in pristine condition being iced cold and sparkling and with the distinctive foamy head so characteristic of the way Czech beer is poured, we chilled out and soaked up the great vibe in this busy and popular Irish Pub. Beer served in here was spot on, golden, light and hoppy, bursting with taste and very easy to drink especially when served freezing cold as in this pub, its hardly surprising that this pub is so popular with beers served in this good a condition and by great staff who are genuinely pleased to see you in their pub and know how to serve a good pint. We stayed here for two pints each before moving on and as on every other visit to Durty Nelly's we had a great time. Durty Nelly's is a pub easy to locate along Melantrichova,a street and area teeming with pubs, bars, cafe's and restaurants and some amazing architecture and a major tourist destination. Opening hours are; Monday to Thursday, 1pm till 2am. Friday & Saturday, 1pm till 3am. Sunday, 1pm till 2am. A wonderful pub in a great location, well worth checking out if you're in the Old Town of Prague.\n\nStephen Kelly\n\nBusy Irish Pub A fantastic Irish pub in the old town thats in one of its liveliest areas of Prague and was a pub well worth visiting.We went to here in the evening when they had the Liverpool v Man City game and it was very busy. Op our visit we had a few glasses of Czech beers which were superb and were served in perfect condition and where well priced especially for an Irish pub.A fantastic Irish pub in a nice area and well worth going to. (This is my first reviews of Durty Nelly's Irish Pub).\n\nJames Street\n\nGood bar Lovely bar, nice staff, good beer, more expensive side of Prague as it was £4 a pint. But worth it compared to pilsner urquel served at the cheap bars.\n\ngerard w\n\nExcellent watering hole , well worth a visit Great spot for a few beers and lunch, staff were great especially Rossa who went out of his way to make a cocktail 🍸that wasn't on the menu for my wife Ger and Dolores, Dublin\n\nAraz K\n\nWonderful!! Great place , nice environment . This place really good for watching to football , grabing beer , speanding time woth friend and your partners or collegues .Akso you can go to upstair bar for drinks and the next of the bar has place for karaoke.\n\nGoosey G\n\nGreat service, a little gem! After walking miles around the sights we stopped for a little hydration. This lovely Irish bar was perfect. The staff were super friendly and regularly came to check if you needed anything without being pushy. Prices were very reasonable. We tried the jalapeño popper bar snacks which were super tasty. Cocktails were great. Music was live abd was just starting as we were leaving but it was very good what we heard. Would highly recommend this place."
