        "text": "Assaf Yona Olshansky-Gefen was born in Ramat Gan, Israel. In 2010, his family relocated to the Netherlands where he experienced an international school education in a small Dutch town called Wassenaar. He remained in the Netherlands for his undergraduate studies, and he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in World Politics and with a minor in Journalism from Leiden University College The Hague. His thesis on the 2022 FIFA World Cup and its impact on Qatari soft power was recognized with the Thesis of Merit award, and he has been working closely with his supervisor on publishing it as an academic article since graduation. Throughout his studies, he realized that his passion for journalism and storytelling was stronger than his interest in international affairs. After graduating, he moved to Amsterdam where he completed several internships in the journalism and film industries and dedicated time to working on several documentary short films. He is very excited about moving across the Atlantic and joining the news and documentary program in order to do more of what he loves most: meeting new people, hearing their stories, and sharing those stories with rest of the world.\n\nCarrie Johnson is an enrolled citizen of the Chickasaw Nation and a descendent of the Pawnee Nation. Her roots are in Oklahoma, but she grew up across the state of Texas. She is a 2024 graduate from Austin College in Sherman, Texas where she double majored in English and Media Studies. She played two years of college basketball and three years of college softball and was Captain of the softball team her senior year.\n\nFor her senior English thesis, she was selected as a fellow for the Mellon “Humanities For All Times” grant where she spent a year writing a book titled “to tell, for the sake of the birds.” The book is split into past, present, and future and focuses on southern Native American tribes and her personal introspect. Carrie also directed a short film called “The Wounds of a Dark-Eyed Junco” for her media capstone that focused on a group of four young women seeking their own sense of justice in a small town.\n\nShe has been a fellow and mentor-in-training for the Indigenous Journalist Association; a mentee and mentor for NPR’s Next Generation Radio: Indigenous; an intern for the Chickasaw Press; and was the 2023 recipient of the Underscore Indigenous Journalism Fellowship where she was based in Portland, Oregon. Most recently, she was one of ten Indigenous storytellers to receive the Running Strong for American Indian Youth “Dreamstarter” $20K grant to work on a year-long project which is to create a documentary called “A Breath on the Flames.” Carrie has a special passion and interest for her Native culture, creative writing, filmmaking, traveling, and dessert.\n\nIn the Chickasaw culture, there are individuals called “Keepers of the Flame,” who focus on preserving oral stories and passing them through generations to revitalize what was lost through Indian Boarding Schools – federally run institutions that sought to assimilate Native children into white society. Carrie is hungry to tell the stories of her people in a time when voices are rising and thriving. She is drawn to stories from all tribes, including athletic stories that act as symbols of resilience, the efforts of language preservation and revitalization, the drive for tribal sovereignty, and much more. Her experiences have ranged from print, audio, and broadcast journalism, and she is excited to begin the News & Documentary program at New York University.\n\nElena Xiang believes in the power of ideas. To constantly reflect on herself and the world around her she became a journalist. Elena attended University College London for a B.A Comparative Literature degree with a focus on German Literature and Film Studies. She studied four languages and read everything by Kafka, only finding out that visual language is the one she wants to express herself with.\n\nElena’s journalism career started with reporting at film festivals and interviewing directors. She has covered Berlinale, Cannes, and London Film Festival for two years and focused primarily on Middle Eastern Political Cinema. In 2022, she traveled around Italy, Germany and Eastern Europe to research and write about the Remnant of Fascist Architecture in Europe. Her visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau changes her perspective on filmmaking and journalism. For the very first time, she cannot unsee the weight of a reporter’s ethical responsibility. She reckons documentary filmmaking is a viable medium for tackling pressing social issues at this critical age. Her primary reporting interest lies in immigration, women’s rights, and international politics.\n\nElena has worked in multiple other roles (film set, museum, NGO, theatre, and art gallery), but she is happiest when she is working for herself.\n\nElliot Jinmin Zepeda Kim is a Chilean-Korean recent graduate from the Communication and Media bachelor’s program at Erasmus University Rotterdam. He is currently completing a documentary project that explores the diasporic identities of first and second-generation exiled Chileans in the Netherlands, in the context of the 50th anniversary of the military coup d’état. Elliot has contributed as a film reporter at both IDFA and IFFR, and most recently served as a Young Selector for the 53rd edition of the International Film Festival of Rotterdam. His commitment to amplifying the voices of underrepresented communities is currently reflected in his role at the New Producers Academy, where as a communications and branding coordinator, he has expanded the fellowship program to reach more diverse regions of the Netherlands, enabling a new wave of emerging producers to enter the Dutch media landscape.\n\nAt NYU’s NewsDoc program, Elliot aims to expand and solidify his filmmaking craft by learning innovative approaches to audiovisual storytelling. Through his films, Elliot seeks to address institutional challenges faced by marginalized communities, catalyzing tangible and meaningful changes in Chile and beyond.\n\nGabriela Pierina Pinasco is a journalist with 10 years of experience in digital and multiplatform journalism, with a focus on Human Rights. She specialized in Political Communication at the Argentine Catholic University and holds a master’s degree in Human Rights, Democracy, and International Justice from the University of Valencia in Spain. Since 2019, she has worked as the general digital editor of Ecuador’s oldest and most relevant political magazine, Vistazo. Since 2022, she has also been in charge of Vistazo’s audiovisual department. In that year, she premiered the documentary series “Hidden Paradises of Ecuador,” which explores the most remote destinations in the country, where residents seek to live off sustainable tourism to avoid the depletion of their natural resources. For six years, she was the host of the political analysis radio show “Al Borde de la Noche” and worked as a digital journalist on the Ecuadorian news channel Ecuavisa. She has been a fellow of the United Nations’ Reham Al Farra program and winner of fund for Research and New Narratives on Drugs of the Gabo Foundation and Open Society Foundations.\n\nSophia Stern graduated with honors from Colorado State University in 2024 with a B.A. in Journalism and Media Communications and a minor in Global Environmental Sustainability. Her work as a journalist, photographer, and videographer for Colorado State University’s newspaper, magazine, and the College of Agricultural Sciences, along with her internship at the Museum of Art Fort Collins, provided her with a broad understanding and experience, allowing her to experiment in several branches of media production. During her undergraduate studies, Sophia was awarded several academic journalism scholarships, including membership to and a scholarship from the Denver Press Club. Her first Documentary, We the Creators, where she filmed, produced, directed, edited, and collaborated with a team, was awarded the 2024 Broadcast Festival of Media Arts 3rd place award. It was while working on this film that her passion was ignited, and she realized that she had a talent for seeing the big picture and bringing all the elements of a project together. Sophia is driven by a desire to tell the stories, through her lens, of the people, cultures, species, and environmental issues worldwide. By documenting stories that act as catalysts for change through film and photography, she hopes to open people’s eyes to the world beyond their daily existence. Through NYU’s News and Documentary program, Sophia is excited to deepen her knowledge in the production field, expanding her understanding of the creative process and increasing her ability to capture and deliver meaningful storytelling from script to screen.\n\nStine Agnholt Andersen is a skilled television journalist with several years of experience from both regional and national media outlets in Denmark.

I’m currently making a documentary about cyclists on this 4,000-meter-high road, and this will be my final work in cycling.\n\nI’m an adventurous cyclist who loves climbing mountains. Despite my major in law, I co-founded a cycling film studio “”SevenMin_七分钟”” before graduating from Sichuan University. In three years, we’ve produced over 100 short films as well as advertisements for some of the world’s leading cycling brands.\n\nIn fact, the reason I started filming was I have imagination and emotional bond to cycling, and I learned everything through practice, starting with painting the walls of a humble flat that served as our first base. Since then, I’ve gradually discovered my passion for storytelling. My scalpel is to capture emotional shifts and the feeling of being on the road.\n\nSadly, the business was shut down during the pandemic. For now, we are gathering all that’s left to take one last shot, assuming our final form, and getting ready for the larger world.\n\nThat’s also why I chose New York, the larger world.\n\nEmily Oliver is a 2022 graduate of Edinburgh University where she gained a first-class honours degree in Biotechnology.

My name is Prabhat Seelamsetti and I am a 22-year-old incoming at New York University (Fall ‘23), pursuing a masters degree (MA) in News and Documentary.\n\nSince beginning in my career path, I have acquired fantastic experience and built strong relationships within the field. I studied sports journalism for my undergraduate and was able to intern with a variety of organizations, mainly the Dallas Mavericks as a media member, and become more confident and prominent in my craft.\n\nNow, I want to expand upon my skill set and learn about the Video/Documentary and News side of journalism.

As a student director, I tried documentaries with different themes, including history, humanities and social reality during my undergraduate years. “Self” has always been the core of my concern. From filming old people pursuing poems and distance in life to interpreting the emperor’s love choice under the system of imprisonment in the ancient Song dynasty; from recording the reflection of a suffering anti-cancer girl to observing the plight of ordinary middle-aged women, the “situation”,”choice”, “desire” and “contradiction” of these individuals have deeply attracted me. These experiences strengthened my belief to go as far as possible to be a documentary creator specializing in making female-theme documentaries, inspiring females to think and act differently.\n\nEvery filming and editing process is like living a different life, leading me out of prejudice and reinventing myself. I enjoy the resonance with interviewees by reaching their hearts during interviews. I have my insistence on the truth, and the courage to interpret the rough reality. I don’t look down upon the soft and fragile parts of human nature. I long for my works to be seen and heard by more audiences. From immature trial to my graduation work “Sunny was born” being nominated in The 12th China Academy Awards of Documentary Film, 29th College student of Beijing International Film Festival , 2022 Aranya Waves Film Festival and other film festivals, I have gained gratifying growth in actual practice.\n\nI believe that joining NYU will accelerate my steps to achieve my career goal of being an excellent documentary creator.\n\nRiver Zhang was born and raised in Beijing, China, and spent her college years in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and New York.

I was born in Queens, New York but grew up in Broward County/ Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Would often find myself going back and forth from Queens to Florida as a kid so I identify with both areas but Florida-man/Queens-boy don’t really mesh.\n\nI came up in a strict Jamaican household and became infatuated with news at an early age when I would sit and watch headlines pass with my grandfather most evenings. My interest turned into a commitment after witnessing Florida news outlets’ negligent coverage of Trayvon Martin’s death, their misrepresentation of the facts around Trayvon’s death and attempt to demonize a child inspired me to join the media industry to produce stories that accurately depict communities of color.\n\nAs I previously mentioned I did a lot of moving, and would transition to Northampton Mass during my sophomore year in high school. I’ve been living in the general Springfield-area for the past seven years now and graduated from UMass Amherst with a degree in journalism in Fall 2021.\n\nI began working at MassLive, the second biggest news outlet in Massachusetts behind the Globe, directly after graduation. I’ve enjoyed covering a whole host of topics in Massachusetts from schools, politics, small business, crimes and courts, but never really had my heart in the way fast-paced news was produced. My drive to tell deeper stories is what brought me to NYU.\n\nWhen I’m not caught up in reporting, you can catch me either playing my cello or listening to underground hip-hop heavy with samples over some Alchemist-type production, or relaxing to 70’s soul. I like to DJ too, haven’t performed at any shows since undergrad, but that may change when I get to New York.\n\nZhiying Deng is an independent documentary filmmaker in China with strong interest in social inequalities and marginalized groups.

After graduation, my passion for music and storytelling led me to work in NYC as a data analyst at Warner Music Group and then Soundcloud, using data to construct narratives about music trends. After 4 years in the workforce, I realized that I wanted to tell stories with broader scope, in the hopes of cultivating empathy for those around us. Inspired by my music classes in college and the diversity of cultures in New York, I began to write pieces about musical practices around the world and their intersections with social and political structures. Having grown up immersed in South Indian art forms, I have witnessed how the transformation of these art forms into “classical” systems by those with cultural power excluded many who practiced and developed them; it is my goal to portray the arts through the eyes of those excluded from the mainstream narrative.\n\nI view documentary journalism as the creative and personal medium through which I can focus on individual communities’ relationships with the world. At NYU, I hope to continue to grow as a storyteller, and create documentaries that promote empathy, challenge previously held beliefs and highlight the complexity of human beings.

Her interests in art especially in film developed as she encountered that the film industry in her country only features government campaigns, religious and education programs throughout the nation with its latest film, which was by the Ministry of Religious Affairs, was based on a citizenry guide. This allowed her to experiment in the digital field as a videographer, photographer, animator and a graphic designer for at least five years.

I’ve also developed interests in photography and traveling, which further facilitated my cultural exploration.\n\nIn this life journey, listening to and recording people’s stories has become the most important part of my life, and it defines how I encounter and reflect on the world. Every time I listen to a story, it’s like I experience a different life, whether it’s humble or glorious, full of joy or sorrow.

My Master of Political Science studies at La Sorbonne university in Paris confirmed my taste for journalism. During these two years, I studied sociology and especially the Chicago School and authors like Howard Becker and Erving Goffman. This teaching inspired me to explore and test theories in the field, and that’s exactly what I did in the USA and Israel. My study of Sarah Palin’s storytelling during the 2008 US election turned into a 50-page dissertation. Besides the study of her path, her communications and how US elections are run by a deeply plutocratic system, I drove through different states meeting voters seduced by her story. This is precisely what I enjoy about my work as a journalist today: being objective, not judging people for their actions and positions, but trying to identify and understand what makes them who they are.\n\nI repeated this challenge a year later for my 150-page graduation dissertation. I chose a different subject: the village of Neve Shalom Wahat al Salam in Israel, where 60 Jewish and Palestinian families have been living in peace for over 40 years. Shortly after, I worked as analyst for the bilateral cooperation division at the French Defense ministry. I have been a journalist for more than 4 years. I started at a web TV channel specialized in economy, finance and social issues. Since May 2013 I have been producing articles and editing reports on various topics for both the web-based channel M6info.com and M6 television.\n\nThe documentary project at NYU is a chance for me, first of all, to learn how to improve with camera in my hands. Secondly, it is the opportunity to work on a subject for several weeks, being able to study a topic in depth and test theories in the field, meeting people and following them in their journey.\n\nWhen I am not working, I can be found attending theatre, music festivals or at a café, writing down a tv show script.\n\nOlivia Wilson\n\nOlivia Wilson was raised in Brooklyn, New York and received her B.A. at Villanova University for Communication with a speciality in journalism.

She interned at New 12 New Jersey and Fox 29 in Philadelphia as a sports department intern, as well as a public relations intern for the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nShe is excited to attend NYU because she is ready to learn how to be an independent film maker. She hopes to be a cross between Michael Moore and Spike Lee, both of which have heavily influenced her style of interviewing and film making. She wants to focus on issues of racism and women’s rights.\n\nJing Liu\n\nI was born in a small city in China. It was actually not a serious city but an oilfield with the ever-stopping working units. They accompanied me every day of my childhood and my curiosity of what the world looks like grew day by day.\n\nSince I was a little kid, I was looking forward to knowing different stories. I knew it was impossible for me to experience various lives therefore I was eager to know others’ life stories which could also enrich my own insight and knowledge about life. While being interested in knowing all stories, I grew a strong interest towards literature. That is why I decided to finish my undergraduate education in Beijing Foreign Studies University in China, majoring in Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language, which prepares me rich knowledge in both Chinese and English. And this major broadens my vision in different culture studies, which triggered my interest in documenting the valuable moments of human beings.\n\nI worked as intern editors in new media industry in China. The experience reminds me of the importance of journalism. People need to know about the society they are living in and utter the voice of themselves. It was at that time when I determined to pursue a career as a journalist. However, my perception changed a little bit after I watched the famous documentary called Under The Dome produced by Jing Chai. I was pretty amazed by her investigation into the air pollution in China and wanted to try something like her in my own school. I independently made a documentary film and grew a strong interest of digging more into visual story-telling. I think video would be the most powerful expression of truth.\n\nI love traveling and talking to different people, their life experiences are worth delivering in many senses. Some are quite inspiring, some are really thought-provoking. So, I want to become a storyteller in my future career. I feel thrilled about going to NYU for further study in news and documentary.\n\nOlga Slobodchikova\n\nOlga Slobodchikova was born and raised in Kirov, a city along the Trans Siberian railway in Russia. She studied journalism at the Moscow State University, graduating with honors in 2012. Just after the first year of her studies, she was hired by TASS, one of the leading news agencies in the country. Throughout her time at the university, Olga has worked for various Russian media outlets and landed an internship at the Moscow bureau of the New York Times. There, she was researching and fact-checking stories for staff reporters, including Pulitzer-winning journalists. She contributed to the coverage of Vladimir Putin’s decision to run for the third term and mass protests that followed the parliamentary elections of 2011. This unique experience has determined her choice to work for international media.\n\nBy the time of graduation, Olga was already working as a producer at the BBC Russian Service, the BBC’s subdivision in Russian language. During her four years at the BBC Moscow bureau, she went on to become a bilingual correspondent who has covered social affairs and culture in both Russian and English languages. Olga has covered the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, the effect of the economic crisis and Western sanctions on the society and cultural tendencies of Putin’s Russia, which included interviewing the controversial culture minister. At the BBC, she has worked across multiple platforms, including online, video and radio. Her new goal is to perfect a set of skills that would allow her to work behind the camera as well as in front of it.\n\nTsering Wangmo\n\nMy name is Tsering Wangmo and I was born in exile in India to first generation Tibetan refugee parents. From a young age hearing the story of my parents and listening to folk stories of Tibet I developed a deep interest in storytelling and having spent my childhood in a tiny village I naturally understood the importance of mass media for people to connect to the outside world. When it was time for me to graduate from school I have already fathomed that Journalism was the right subject for me.\n\nI studied BA Journalism from Madras Christian College in south India during which time I interned with The Hindu and later after a year working for an NGO I joined Himachal Pradesh University in Shimla to study Mass Communication. Upon graduating from here, it was now time to follow my long planned dream project to document the lives of Tibetan nomads in exile. Although I graduated in 2014, I have already visited the nomadic plateaus in 2010 and 2011 to establish a better and a more deeper understand of their lifestyle and to also understand how government policies effects their way of life. In 2015, I received funding from The Rowell Fund for Tibet to carry on the project ‘Documenting the lives of Tibetan nomads in exile through photography.’ I strongly believe that the News and Doc course will prepare me to eventually make documentary films on Tibetan nomadic life.\n\nVeronica Wangshen\n\nVeronica was born and raised in China till she started another chapter of her life at the age of 16 in various countries including US, UK and Japan. She recently completed her M.A. Degree from Columbia University, specializing in history and film studies. Prior to that, she received a B.A. Degree from Michigan State University, where she focused on history, art history and anthropology, and later on worked in museums, galleries and subsequently the New York Public Library. The life experience living under different cultures and lifestyles offers her an open-minded perspective and the academic/professional training enables her to generate a strong passion in socio-cultural studies.\n\nThe long-term interest in documentaries of cultural, artistic and social issues was embedded in her since younger ages under her father’s influences. Through former collaborations with several documentary filmmakers, she gained increasing confidence and courage in pursuing documentary filmmaking. Currently she is highly passionate for the issues of the preservation of cultural heritage and endangered art worldwide, as well as the dysfunctional socio-legal systems and underrepresented population in East Asian society. She expects herself and her works to be a light shedding into the darkness.\n\nBesides work, travel is the second most important thing in her life and an alternative lifestyle for her to perceive the world and discover the issues worth further research or larger acknowledgment. If backpacking does not occupy all of her leisure time, she must be into either books or music. So feel free to join her.\n\nQingzi Fan\n\nQingzi Fan was born in a small city in China and raised in Shanghai. She holds a B.A. in Chinese Literature from Fudan University. In her college years, she spent most of the time traveling to the underdeveloped regions of China, where she saw underprivileged families struggling with life, children shouldering the responsibility of onerous farm work and town residents suffering from severe pollution. What she saw strengthened her belief that unless someone like a reporter brings the terrible conditions to light, things would never change.\n\nShe has been to Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hebei and Tibet as a volunteer photographer and teacher to help out the children who have no chance to receive proper education. She landed a 3-month internship in Shanghai Media Group yet found her freedom of speech hamstrung by the way Chinese media function. Then she started to intern at NBC Universal, where she focused on digital editing, researching and reporting.\n\nHer motto is “be brave and never compromise.” She envisions continuing her fighting for underserved populations and calling attention to issues of inequality, social illness and government corruption in China.\n\nJan Kobal\n\nI hold a BS in Biochemistry from the University of Southampton and an MS in immunology from University College London and this might surprise many an onlooker seeing as I’m moving towards documentary film. I’ve always felt out of place in the field of applied science and this reached a point soon after I moved to London. I reevaluated what it was I find myself doing most often, where my natural drive lies. I found it journalism.\n\nI was the music editor for a long running magazine in Southampton called The Edge and then proceeded to become the music editor at the London publication Savage. Suffice it to say music has always played a large part in my life. I’ve conducted many interviews of bands, scientists, artists and comedians on student radio and I’ve written many pieces on the music world today.\n\nMy desires weren’t satiated, however, with simply pursuing journalism as a hobby. Films have always fascinated me, both documentaries and works of fiction, and I struggled to find a way to pursue this creative outlet. With News and Documentary I want to attain the skills required to become a fully individual documentary filmmaker in the style of my idols – Werner Herzog, Erol Morris and Joshua Oppenheimer. In this vein I do not wish to focus on a particular format of documentary journalism, this is because I believe the field is ever evolving and varying lengths and styles of film are able to best capture an inherent narrative. I am interested in understanding what it is that makes us decide to do whatever it is we do – why do doctors spread pseudoscience whilst having sworn the Hippocratic oath? Why do disenchanted youths turn to drugs in one of the most beautiful cities in Norway, Bergen. I suppose you could say I’m blissfully curious and incredibly aware of how quixotic I can be at times, and I look forward to what NYC throws at me.\n\nQiuxuan Lyu\n\nQiuxuan Lyu (Lucille) recently earned her B.A degree from Beijing Foreign Studies University, majoring in Chinese Language and Literature and minoring in English. She found her interest in telling and writing stories during her first internship in a local media in Tianjin. She also tried to use video to tell stories and finished her first short documentary in 2014. This experience inspired her to pursue a career in documentary or video journalism. Then she joined APTN Beijing Bureau and landed a 6-month internship as an assistant video journalist. Later, she also did an internship in Xinhua News Network Corperation and tried to tell stories from different angles.\n\nBorn and raised in Tianjin, a city famous for folk art and humor, Qiuxuan has a strong interest in Chinese traditional art. She started to learn and play the Pipa (a traditional Chinese musical instrument) when she was seven and she still practices when she has time. Besides music, she developed a penchant for Chinese tea under her mother’s influence. With such a background, she wants to make a documentary about a Chinese art form or stories of Chinese artists.\n\nKimberly Jones\n\nKimberly Jones was born and raised in Paterson, NJ and received her B.A. from Cornell University in Sociology. During her undergraduate years, her love of journalism led her to found the Black Perspectives campus newsletter, which provided a forum for topic discussion relevant to students of color. After graduation, Kimberly worked as an editor for various trade publications and subsequently sharpened her print and digital editing skills at McGraw-Hill Education. During this time, Kimberly continued to develop her interest in journalism by working as a freelance reporter for North Jersey Media Group and earning a professional development certificate from MediaBistro in Digital Journalism. Inspired by documentaries such as “Waiting for Superman” and “Blackfish”, Kimberly is looking forward to completing her master’s degree with a particular emphasis on developing her long form storytelling skills and acquiring the finer points of video shooting and editing. When she is not busy perusing the news, Kimberly enjoys spending time with her family and trying out new cooking recipes.\n\nTeng Chen\n\nTeng comes from a region which is famous for its mafia groups all around the world – Fujian, China.

She studied French language in university, and studied Sociology in France for one year., After graduation in 2010 and until 2012, she tried around 20 jobs in different industries and found none of them satisfying, because of her restless nature and strong curiosity to know always more about the world.\n\nThen Teng finally decided to try journalism.. It was a crazy moment in her life but the door of lights was finally cracked open. Teng gradually found work as a full-time news assistant and producer for NRC (leading dutch newspaper), Canal+ (French TV), and the New York Times. She was lucky enough to have the opportunities to work with the highest journalistic prize winners from Netherlands, France and US (Pulitzer Prize). At the same time, she enriched her journalistic experiences by freelancing as a news assistant and producer for other big international media, such as the BBC, Financial Times, The Economist, Le Monde, Le Figaro, TF1, etc.\n\nHer journey as a China Producer for documentaries started in 2014, by working for the leading Dutch broadcaster VPRO. So far, she has produced a philosophical documentary series, voiced over by philosopher Alain de Botton (she produced one hour out of the total 7 hours in seven countries), as well as her beloved project: a traveling documentary series about China (she produced three hours out of the total six hours). Teng was the only China producer for all these projects.\n\nThe various experiences in print media gave Teng the sense to think with content and depth, and experiences in TV gave her the sense to tell stories through images. Teng feels very passionate about coming to NYU because she wants to put herself a step forward towards being an independent journalist and a documentary filmmaker, who can not only produce, but also shoot, edit.\n\nVeda Shastri\n\nVeda is a native of Boston, MA, but has been living & working in New Delhi, India since 2010.
