        "text": "A power ranking has each team ranked according to their current strength. After Week 11, the European League of Football is getting closer and closer to the playoffs. Who slides down and who moves up?\n\nLet’s see where I rank each team going into Week 12 of the 2024 season and why!\n\nPrevious Ranking: 1\n\nThe Surge dominated the Milano Seamen in Week 11. Will they do the same with the Raiders Tirol? Their last matchup against the playoff candidate was probably closer than they liked it to be. Will the Surge be able to dominate or are the Raiders again making it close just three weeks before the playoffs kick off?\n\nPrevious Ranking: 2\n\nRhein Fire come out of their bye week. They will face the Hamburg Sea Devils at home with their postseason ticket already secured.\n\nPrevious Ranking: 3\n\nThe Vikings are back. No slow start, no allowing a few points in trash time. The Vienna Vikings gave it their all against the Helvetic Mercenaries and are rightfully staying in my Top 3.\n\nPrevious Ranking: 4\n\nThe Spanish franchise handled business against the Hamburg Sea Devils at home. With a final score of 9-52, the Madrid Bravos showed what they are capable off. Their flexible offense with quarterback Steve Duncan and a functional running game can be a threat to any team in the ELF. But will they be able to make some noise in the postseason?\n\nPrevious Ranking: 5\n\nThe Paris Musketeers did their job last Sunday after losing against Rhein Fire in Week 10. Their game against the Berlin Thunder came down to the very last minute. But this win propels them further towards the playoffs. Will they be able get past the Cologne Centurions in Week 12 to secure their spot in the playoffs?\n\nPrevious Rank: 6\n\nThe Raiders Tirol have to be on point in Week 12 against the Stuttgart Surge. After a bye week, the Austrian franchise had the chance to lay their focus on one of the most important games of their season. If they get this win, they take a huge step towards the postseason. If they don’t, the Munich Ravens have the chance to steal their Wild Card spot.\n\nPrevious Rank: 7\n\nThe Munich Ravens are in the hunt for a spot in the playoffs. They are breathing down the neck of the Raiders Tirol and will look to make their upcoming bye week count.\n\nPrevious Rank: 8\n\nThe Thunder played against the Paris Musketeers at home and delivered a fight. For four straight quarters, the Thunder were right there to grab the win against their Western Conference opponent. But at the end, the Thunder did what they always do against good teams; lose. Will they have the edge over the Wroclaw Panthers coming to town on Sunday?\n\nPrevious Rank: 11\n\nThe Cologne Centurions were back in old form, beating the Frankfurt Galaxy for a second time this season alone. Their all-time record against the Galaxy went from 0-7 before the season to 2-7 after their game this Sunday. It was not only a great game, but the Centurions also managed to pull off the largest comeback in ELF history. But will they be able to fight for a playoff spot in the last three weeks of the regular season?\n\nPrevious Rank: 10\n\nThe Wroclaw Panthers enjoyed their bye week and therefore stay at rank 10 before they will meet the Thunder on the road this Sunday.\n\nPrevious Rank: 9\n\nThe Frankfurt Galaxy lost their second game of the season against the Cologne Centurions. With their 3-6 record, the German franchise has officially missed the postseason once again. What is going on with the 2021 ELF Champion?\n\nPrevious Rank: 12\n\nThe Helvetic Mercenaries lost again. But this time, they were overpowered in all four quarters of their game against the unbeaten Vienna Vikings. Will they use their bye week for a final push in the regular season?\n\nPrevious Rank: 13\n\nAnother week, another tough loss for the Hamburg Sea Devils. I know the Madrid Bravos are a great team, but four interceptions by Sea Devils quarterback D’Angelo Fullford, plus his fumbles, are just too many turnovers. Let’s see how they will close out the season in the last three weeks of the regular season.\n\nPrevious Rank: 15\n\nThe Milano Seamen gave up a lot of yards and points on defense against the Stuttgart Surge, my top team at the moment. However, the Italian franchise was able to hurt the Surge on defense with their rushing game. Over 200 rushing yards for the Seamen are quite the statement after a lot of coaches and players changes this season. Despite their loss, the Seamen move up one spot in my ranking.\n\nPrevious Rank: 14\n\nThe Enthroners move down one spot because the Seamen move up to spot 14 on my ranking. It will be interesting to see the Enthroners battling it out against the Prague Lions this upcoming weekend!\n\nPrevious Rank: 16\n\nThe Czech franchise was overpowered by the Munich Ravens on their mission to still reach the playoffs. For mey, the Lions stay at 16 after Week 11 and ahead of their matchupt against the Enthroners in Week 12.\n\nPrevious Rank: 17\n\nThe Barcelona Dragons do not look like they will get back to their 2022 form anytime soon. But let’s see if there is still light at the end of the tunnel against the Munich Ravens."
