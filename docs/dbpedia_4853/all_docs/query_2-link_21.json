comes just over two months before the 2024 World Lacrosse Box Championships in Utica, New York, USA that will see the first ever women’s tournament played alongside the sixth edition of the men’s competition as this indoor format of lacrosse continues to grow in the UK and around the world.\n\nFans of box lacrosse are welcome to attend the Battle of the Borders free of charge with doors open from 11:30am and the bar serving a range of refreshments.\n\nThe days are getting longer, the sun’s starting to peek through the clouds (finally), and there’s a general election around the corner but what we’re most excited about is a huge summer of lacrosse in 2024!\n\nNo less than five major tournaments featuring England teams and seven Triple Arrow Camps will be keeping us busy throughout July, August, and September and we’ve got all the information you need to know ahead of such a momentous few months.\n\n10-20 July | ELF Women’s Lacrosse Championship\n\nThe England senior women’s team are back in action at a major tournament in July for the first time since winning bronze at the 2022 World Lacrosse Women’s Championship as they look to win their eighth European title and lift the trophy

full to the brim with some of the most exciting young talent England has to offer.\n\nTaking on Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, and Denmark in Group A, the tournament will be the first opportunity for many of the selected players to showcase their talents on the international stage.\n\nCheck out the full squad HERE.\n\nSummer 2024 Triple Arrow Camps\n\nSummer means a long break from school for

way?\n\nWell, that’s exactly what’s on offer at Triple Arrow Camps this year with seven scheduled to take place throughout August hosted by schools all around England.\n\nIf you or your child is aged

Like England, they had won one and lost one of their first two games.\n\nMore superb defence from England, a theme throughout the E-Box event, saw the game tied at 3-3 with one quarter down.\n\nThe England offence then kicked into gear with powerful outside shooting and precision passing around the crease allowing England to jump to a 9-3 lead.\n\nCLL pulled a few back but England were now in control, scoring on transition as their opposition tired and, crucially, stayed out of the penalty box as the game finished 13-9 to England.\n\nWatch all the action from ShE-Box 2024 HERE.\n\nEngland (m) 13-12 Finland (5-2, 4-4, 1-3, 3-3)\n\nEngland scorers: Matt Marsh (3G), Oliver Allsop (2G), Silas Burke (1G), Jamie Powell (1G), Elliot Leonard (1G, 2A), Luke Mills-Doig (1G, 1A), Sam Perry (1G, 1A), Ming Trinh (1G, 1A), Taylor Harrison (1G), Albert Whitehead (1G), Ben Buchanan (3A), Tom Hallam (1A), Ben Page-Laycock (1A)\n\nCzechia 14-8 England (m) (3-0, 4-1, 4-3, 3-4)\n\nEngland scorers: Matt Marsh (3G), Ben Page-Laycock (2G), Jamie Powell (2G), Elliot Leonard (1G, 3A), Oliver Allsop (2A), Sam Perry (1A), Ming Trinh (1A)\n\nCLL 9-13 England (m) (3-3, 1-6, 3-3, 2-1)\n\nEngland scorers: Matt Marsh (3G, 1A), Elliot Leonard (3G), Ben Page-Laycock (2G), Jamie Powell (2G), Silas Burke (1G, 1A), Tom Roper (1G), Matt Tatton (1G), Ben Buchanan (2A), Ming Trinh (2A), Oliver Allsop (1A), Tom Roche (1A)\n\nEngland Top Scorers\n\nMatt Marsh | 10 (9G, 1A)\n\nElliot Leonard | 10 (5G, 5A)\n\nJamie Powell | 5 (5G)\n\nBen Page-Laycock | 5 (4G, 1A)\n\nOliver Allsop | 5 (2G, 3A)\n\nMing Trinh | 5 (1G, 4A)\n\nBen Buchanan | 5 (5A)\n\nSilas Burke | 3 (2G, 1A)\n\nSam Perry | 3 (1G, 2A)\n\nLuke Mills-Doig | 2 (1G, 1A)\n\nTaylor Harrison | 1 (1G)\n\nTom Roper | 1 (1G)\n\nMatt Tatton | 1 (1G)\n\nAlbert Whitehead | 1 (1G)\n\nTom Hallam | 1 (1A)\n\nTom Roche | 1 (1A)\n\nEngland women secured four wins in five games in their first ever competitive international fixtures at the annual ShE-Box event in Radotin, Czechia.\n\nVictories against Finland, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and Canada (WGN) mean England are in a good position ahead of the 2024 World Lacrosse Women’s Box Championship in Utica, USA in September.\n\nEngland took on Finland in their opening game and very quickly showed the amount of quality this fledgling side possesses as they overcame an early one goal deficit by hitting eight without reply to blow away the opposition.\n\nLauren Lewis, who had travelled to Czechia from England without using air travel, scored four goals and firmly established herself as one to watch on the international box lacrosse scene.\n\nEngland field player and star of The Fly, Laura Beaman, scored two and Lucy Ford, Ellie Racle, and Laura Wright all grabbed one each to see the game out at 9-2.\n\nLater on in a rescheduled match, England played fellow World Championship Pool A competitors Hong Kong and, despite a tough first half, came out on top with Lewis once again impressing, scoring six goals.\n\nBeaman, Fran Parshall, Rosie Bathrust, Hannah Foxcroft, and Tash Gage got their names on the scoresheet too with one goal each.\n\nAnother Pool A opponent came up next in Netherlands where England stormed into a 7-1 half-time lead after goals from Ford (x2), Racle (x2), Lewis, Wright, and Bathurst.\n\nEngland refused to slow in the second half and scored another seven goals to leave Netherlands battered and bruise; Katie Greenwood, Davina Emetulu, Lauren Hurley, Foxcroft, Zara Russell, Esme Breach, and Gage all hit the back of the Netherlands net as the game finished 14-3.\n\nEngland’s biggest test came in the form of unbeaten Germany who had already swept aside Canada (WGN) and Ireland in their opening two games.\n\nEngland more than matched their opposition in the first and third quarters but difficult second and fourth quarters saw them finish the game five goals behind, losing 11-6.\n\nThere was still chance for England to bounce back from that first defeat of the weekend the following day against Canada (WGN), however.\n\nA tight first half, with England goals from Ford, Alys Johns, and Lewis, ended with Canada (WGN) two goals ahead and the score sitting at 5-3 but a dogged second half performance that saw Ford score her second of the match, Lewis hit two, and Racle add one more took the game to a penalty shoot-out.\n\nUp stepped the unshakeable Beaman who ran direct to goal and feigned to shoot several times before firing into the bottom right-hand corner of the Canada (WGN) net.\n\nThe spotlight was on Lucy Mayers in the England goal as Erica Evans stepped up to take her penalty; Evans ran slowly towards goal and hit her shot direct at Mayers who stood firm to keep the ball out.\n\nEngland’s second penalty was taken by Bathurst who confidently strode towards goal and slammed the ball past the Canada (WGN) goalie.\n\nOne final hurdle: if Mayers could keep Canada’s second penalty out, England would claim the victory.\n\nBrianna Trembley headed towards the England goal, taking a wide run up. Mayers kept her body as wide as possible and forced Trembley into a tight angle; Trembley’s shot was fired wide, securing the win for England.\n\nWatch all the action from ShE-Box 2024 HERE.\n\nEngland Results\n\nEngland (w) 9-2 Finland (5-2, 4-0)\n\nEngland scorers: Lauren Lewis (4G), Laura Beaman (2G, 1A), Lucy Ford (1G, 2A), Ellie Racle (1G), Laura Wright (1G), Esme Breach (1A), Katie Greenwood (1A)\n\nHong Kong 4-11 England (w) (3-3, 1-8)\n\nEngland scorers: Lauren Lewis (6G), Laura Beaman (1G, 1A), Fran Parshall (1G, 1A), Lucy Ford (2A), Ellie Racle (2A), Rosie Bathurst (1G), Hannah Foxcroft (1G), Tash Gage (1G), Katie Greenwood (1A)\n\nEngland (w) 14-3 Netherlands (4-0, 3-1, 2-0, 5-2)\n\nEngland scorers: Lucy Ford (2G, 1A), Ellie Racle (2G, 1A), Lauren Lewis (1G, 2A), Rosie Bathurst (1G, 1A), Laura Wright (1G), Katie Greenwood (1G), Davina Emetulu (1G), Lauren Hurley (1G), Hannah Foxcroft (1G), Zara Russell (1G, 1A), Esme Breach (1G), Tash Gage (1G, 1A), Laura Beaman (1A)\n\nGermany 11-6 England (w) (1-1, 3-1, 1-2, 6-2)\n\nEngland scorers: Laura Beaman (2G), Hannah Foxcroft (2G), Laura Wright (1G), Lucy Ford (1G), Ellie Racle (1A)\n\nCanada (WGN) 7-8 England (w) (5-3, 2-4, 0-1)\n\nEngland scorers: Lauren Lewis (3G), Lucy Ford (2G, 2A), Ellie Racle (1G, 1A), Alys Johns (1G), Laura Beaman (1A), Katie Greenwood (1A)\n\nTop Scorers\n\nLauren Lewis | 16 (14G, 2A)\n\nLucy Ford | 13 (6G, 7A)\n\nLaura Beaman | 9 (5G, 4A)\n\nEllie Racle | 9 (4G, 3A)\n\nHannah Foxcroft | 4 (4G)\n\nKatie Greenwood | 4 (1G, 3A)\n\nLaura Wright | 3 (3G)\n\nRosie Bathurst | 3 (2G, 1A)\n\nTash Gage | 3 (2G, 1A)\n\nEsme Breach | 2 (1G,1A)\n\nFran Parshall | 2 (1G, 1A)\n\nZara Russell | 2 (1G, 1A)\n\nDavina Emetulu | 1 (1G)\n\nLauren Hurley | 1 (1G)\n\nAlys Johns | 1 (1G)\n\nEngland’s men and women’s box teams take to the field over the weekend at the annual E-Box/ShE-Box events in Radotin, Czechia.\n\nThe ShE-Box event will mark the first ever competitive fixtures played by the new England women’s box team as they take on Hong Kong, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, and a Women’s Global Network team made up of Canadian players.\n\n25 of the best women’s box lacrosse players in the country will head to Radotin as part of England’s preparations ahead of the inaugural World Lacrosse Women’s Box Championship in Utica, USA, in September.\n\nAt that competition, England will feature in Pool A alongside fellow ShE-Box competitors Netherlands and Hong Kong as well as formidable opponents USA and Haudenosaunee.\n\nShE-Box 2024 will give England Head Coach Rob Clark and his coaching staff an important look at the squad before he whittles the wider training squad down to just 23 players in the summer.\n\nThe men’s E-Box competition will see England take on Finland, Czechia, and Canada U20s as they also look to continue preparations ahead of the World Championship in September.\n\nHead Coach Walt Christianson will want to look at his team in a competitive environment as he deliberates over his final 23-player World Championship squad.\n\nHis side will be looking to challenge at the top end of the competition after a fourth-place finish in 2019 that saw them push USA all the way in the bronze medal match and a first major title at the European Championship two years ago.\n\nTo watch some of the matches at E-Box/ShE-Box 2024, click HERE.\n\nE-Box/ShE-Box Schedule\n\nFriday 19 April | England (w) v Hong Kong, China | 8am BST\n\nFriday 19 April | England (w) v Finland | 11:20am BST\n\nSaturday 20 April | England (w) v Netherlands | 1:40pm BST\n\nSaturday 20 April | England (m) v Finland | 6:30pm BST\n\nSunday 21 April | England (w) v Germany | 3pm BST\n\nSunday 21 April | England (m) v Czechia | 7pm BST\n\nMonday 22 April | England (w) v Canada (WGN) | 9am BST\n\nMonday 22 April | England (m) v Canada U20 | 9:50am BST\n\nVeteran England box lacrosse goalie, Eliot Pugh, has decided to call time on his international career after 11 years.\n\nPugh ends his England career after earning 35 caps and representing his country at four major championships including the 2019 World Championship and the 2015, 2017, and 2022 European Championships, the latter of which saw him win a gold medal after England stormed to the title.\n\nPugh’s box lacrosse journey started in 2013 when he first attended some England training sessions hosted by ex-England players Joe Darkins and Pete Dunits who were looking for the next generation of England goalies in the aftermath of the 2011 World Championship.\n\nFrom those first England training sessions, Pugh got more involved in box lacrosse and took part in the Tasko Cup for the first time in 2014, playing for DreadLax.\n\nAfter that, Pugh was thrown in at the deep end when he was selected as part of the England squad to travel to the Onondaga Nation, USA for the 2015 World Indoor Lacrosse Championship; at that tournament, Pugh played in two games, securing a 72% save ratio, as England finished fifth.\n\nPugh had firmly got the box lacrosse bug by now and was chosen to be part of the England squad competing at the 2017 European Championship in Finland where he played in five games (68% save ratio), helping England to another fifth place finish.\n\nAlongside his role as goalie, Pugh also took on the England Team Manager job ahead of the 2017 European Championship with fellow player Dave Cluney, a job which he continues to do now alongside Rob Gooch. This job involves organising the team ahead of training sessions and tournaments and booking accommodation and travel for the players and coaches.\n\nIn 2018, Pugh joined London Knights as they played in, and eventually won, the Tasko Cup that year; Pugh has played for London Knights in every Tasko Cup since then, claiming six titles.\n\n2019 saw Pugh once again selected to play for England at that year’s World Championship where he played in six games with a 72% save ratio as England pushed USA all the way in the bronze medal game but eventually finished fourth.\n\nIn 2022, Pugh played in his final major championship for England when he played two games with a massive 86% save ratio as England claimed their first trophy at the 2022 European Box Lacrosse Championship in Hanover, Germany.\n\nThe 36-year-old made his final three England appearances at his second E-Box Invitational event last year.\n\nOutside of box lacrosse, Pugh first picked up a lacrosse stick in 2007 while studying at Swansea University where he played in the mixed team and joined Swansea Hawks shortly after. In 2008, he helped to found the first men’s team at Swansea University before moving to Reading in 2010.\n\nWhile playing for Reading, Pugh played in two Flags Finals in three years, winning their player of year twice in a row before moving to Maidstone. After two years at Maidstone, Pugh played in the Premiership with Purley for one season and then moved to Milton Keynes where he retired as a field lacrosse player in 2022.\n\nNow he has retired as an international box player as well, Pugh intends on becoming a mentor and goalie coach in the future as well as continuing his role as the England Team Manager heading into this year’s World Championship.\n\nThe English game hasn’t seen the last of Pugh between the sticks though as he hopes to play as and when domestically and socially for London knights and the South team in the Tasko Cup and annual North v South games; he also hopes to have the opportunity to play at the Alex Hebresky Memorial one day.\n\nPugh leaves behind a huge legacy as when he joined the England box lacrosse team in 2013, not many people had heard of, let alone played, this indoor version of the sport.\n\nBut he, alongside several other pioneers of the game in England, helped to slowly grow the format and he leaves the England team, and box lacrosse in England more generally, in a much better place than when he started.\n\nIndeed, box lacrosse in England is now attracting the attention of many of the best lacrosse players in the country and an annual domestic league now takes place every winter.\n\nThanks for everything, Eliot!\n\nWorld Lacrosse today announced the schedule for the 2024 World Lacrosse Box Championships, set for 20-29 September in Utica, New York, with 133 games set to take place across the historic double world championship.\n\nThe event will feature 28 teams in the men’s competition split into seven pools and 10 teams in the first-ever women’s box championship grouped into two pools.\n\nCompetition will take place at two venues; the Utica University Nexus Center will serve as the main tournament hub, featuring three playing surfaces, and the Adirondack Bank Center will also host a full slate of games, including the opening night and medal matches. The two venues are connected via skyway.\n\nThe event will commence 20 September with eight games at the two venues – Germany will face Ireland in the opening game of the men’s competition, while Canada will take on Finland in the opener of the women’s tournament.\n\nThe United States makes its debut in the women’s box championship against the Netherlands later on opening day, followed by the USA men taking on the Haudenosaunee in a blockbuster matchup, as both teams have medaled in every edition of the men’s box championship.\n\nCanada – the defending champion in the men’s competition – will make its debut on Saturday, September 21 against England.\n\nThe top four seeded men’s teams make up the A pool: Canada, the Haudenosaunee, the United States and England. The remaining teams were split into pools B-G, which include the remaining top-10 teams from the last men’s box championship in 2019 and 11 first-time participants.\n\nThe top four ranked countries in women’s field lacrosse – the United States, Canada, Australia and England – are all participating in the women’s box championship, as well as No. 8 Haudenosaunee.\n\nIn the men's competition, pool play will take place over a five-day period. The top eight finishers will advance directly to the playoffs, while the teams ranked ninth through 16th will compete in a play-in round to determine the remaining four positions.\n\nThanks to England men being ranked fourth in the world, and placed in Pool A, their path to the quarter finals is guaranteed, with a likely quarter-final opponent being the highest ranked winning team from Pools B-G.\n\nThe first round of playoffs will take place 25 September.\n\nMeanwhile, the women’s competition will include pool play between the 10 teams. The top three finishers in each of the two pools will advance to the playoffs, while the teams finishing fourth and fifth in each pool will face off in a play-in round for the remaining two spots.\n\nThe quarter-finals, semi-finals and medal rounds for both championships will take place in parallel 26-29 September. The bronze medal doubleheader is slated for Saturday 28 September, with the gold medal doubleheader on Sunday 29 September.\n\nThe full schedule can be found here and is depicted below. Tickets will go on sale to the public in April.\n\nEngland men has been drawn in Pool A against Canada, the Haudenosaunee, and the United States and England women will play the Haudenosaunee, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and the United States also in Pool A in the respective 2024 World Lacrosse Men’s and Women’s Box Championships due to take place later this year.\n\nThe news comes after World Lacrosse today announced the pools for the 2024 Box Championships, set for 20-29 September in Utica, New York, USA with 28 teams in the men’s box championship and 10 teams in the first-ever women’s box championship.\n\nThe men’s field of 28 teams is split into seven pools of four and the women’s field is split into two groups of five teams.\n\nThe men’s field is the largest in the competition’s history, with 11 teams competing for the first time and three Continental Federations represented.\n\nAll top 10 finishers from the 2019 Men’s Box Championship return to this year’s event, including England who finished fourth in that competition.\n\nThe top four seeded men’s teams make up Pool A: Canada, the Haudenosaunee, the United States and England.\n\nThe remaining teams were split into pools B-G using snake seeding, with adjustments made for continental balance.\n\nFor seeding, final rankings from the last men’s box championship and finishes in past field world championships for teams making their first appearance were considered; for CF balance, teams from at least two continental federations were placed in each pool.\n\nIn the women’s competition, the teams were snake seeded based on final rankings from the 2022 Women’s Championship, also with adjustment for continental balance.\n\nThe schedule will be released later this week, as well as details on the format of the competition and progression into the playoffs.\n\nThe pools can be found below with teams listed alphabetically within each pool.\n\nMen’s Box Championship\n\nPool A\n\nCanada\n\nEngland\n\nHaudenosaunee\n\nUnited States\n\nPool B\n\nBelgium\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nIsrael\n\nMexico\n\nPool C\n\nFinland\n\nGreece\n\nJapan\n\nSwitzerland\n\nPool D\n\nCzech Republic\n\nJamaica\n\nChinese Taipei\n\nScotland\n\nPool E\n\nAustria\n\nItaly\n\nNetherlands\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\nPool F\n\nAustralia\n\nHungary\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nSlovakia\n\nPool G\n\nChina\n\nGermany\n\nIreland\n\nPoland\n\nWomen’s Box Championship\n\nPool A\n\nEngland\n\nHaudenosaunee\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nNetherlands\n\nUnited States\n\nPool B\n\nAustralia\n\nCanada\n\nFinland\n\nGermany\n\nIreland\n\nBritish Lacrosse has announced its men’s and women’s squads to compete at this year’s Euro Lax Sixes Cup, taking place from 23-25 February in Vila Real De Santo Antonio, Algarve, Portugal.\n\nThe men’s team Head Coach, Tom Wenham, has selected 12 players to make the journey to Portugal, including England’s field 2023 World Championship stars Hal Dwobeng, Drew Bickerton, and Cameron Major.\n\nThe squad also includes three of England box’s regular starters and 2022 European Championship winners in Ben Page-Laycock, Matt Tatton, and Ming Trinh.\n\nIndeed, all but one of the 12-player squad has played in The Fly Sixes Lacrosse league with nine of them returning to the competition in 2024.\n\nWomen’s Head Coach, Phil Collier, has selected a 14-player squad, with a two-player reserve list, for the Euro Lax Sixes Cup that includes nine players in the current 2024 England senior training squad and four 2022 World Championship bronze medallists.\n\nEvery single player in the 16-player wider squad has made an appearance in The Fly Sixes Lacrosse league with 15 of them set to represent one of the four teams once again later this year.\n\nThe Euro Lax Sixes Cup is a competition that has yielded some success for British Lacrosse teams over the years with both men’s and women’s teams lifting the inaugural trophies in 2022.\n\n2023 saw British Lacrosse men bring the title home once again after a 25-12 victory over Switzerland in the final.\n\nThat year, British Lacrosse women opted not to submit a team with two England teams taking their place instead; England red eventually won the competition after going unbeaten throughout the tournament.\n\n13 teams have been confirmed as taking part in the Euro Lax Sixes Cup this year, including hosts Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Turkey, Ireland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Switzerland, Scotland, Netherlands, Great Britain, and, for the first time, Brazil.\n\nYou can keep up to date with all the latest from the 2024 Euro Lax Sixes Cup on Instagram HERE.\n\nMiho Sakurai scored eight goals as she helped her Blaze team to a 16-9 victory over Ravens in the final game of the Southern Box Lacrosse (SBL) women’s Winter Box League.\n\nThe win saw Blaze overcome Ravens in the first ever women’s edition of the competition and win the four-game series 3-1.\n\nOther notable performers in the women’s final match were Lauren Lewis, who chipped in with four goals for Blaze, and Izzy Keane (Ravens) who added four goals to the six she had already scored in the first three games.\n\nIn the men’s competition, Knights retained the trophy they first won last year after a narrow 7-6 win over high-flyers Hornets in the final.\n\nHornets were unbeaten in this year’s Winter Box League before the final match and had even beaten Knights 4-3 in the group stage on the opening day.\n\nBut reigning champions Knights proved too strong in the final despite scoring in just two of the four quarters, with Tom Bracegirdle and Rob Harris each hitting a brace.\n\nOllie Allsop, representing Hornets this year, is certainly one to watch in the future as he rounded off his Winter Box League debut with two goals to take his total for the season to 10.\n\nSteelheads claimed third spot after seeing out a tense third place play-off match against Capitals, winning by a single goal and being helped along by the ever-dependable goal-scorer Louis Alhage who hit seven.\n\nBen Buchanan and Andy Thomas both scored hat-tricks in that one for Steelheads with Sam Perry and Jamie Powell doing the same for Capitals.\n\nWatch all the action from the final day at SBL’s Winter Box League on Lacrosse Live UK’s YouTube channel HERE.\n\nDay 3 results\n\n3rd Place Play-Off | Steelheads 14-13 Capitals (4-2, 3-3, 4-3, 3-5)\n\nSteelheads scorers | Alhage (7), Buchanan (3), Thomas (3), Murray\n\nCapitals scorers | Perry (3), Powell (3), Farrer (2), Watson (2), Payne, Rawlins, Rodberg\n\nFinal | Hornets 6-7 Knights (0-0, 1-4, 3-3, 2-0)\n\nHornets scorers | Allsop (2), Collins, Jefferies, Marsh, Schildt\n\nKnights scorers | Bracegirdle (2), Harris (2), Burke, Krommenhoek, Page-Laycock\n\nFinal | Blaze 16-9 Ravens (5-3, 4-4, 5-1, 2-1) Blaze win series 3-1\n\nBlaze scorers | Sakurai (8), Lewis (4), Bottrill, Gage, Racle, Wright\n\nRavens scorers | Keane (4), Bathurst (2), Beaman (2), Lee\n\nFinal standings\n\nMen’s\n\nKnights\n\nHornets\n\nSteelheads\n\nCapitals\n\nWomen’s\n\nBlaze\n\nRavens\n\nTop points scorers (points include goals and assists)\n\nMiho Sakurai (Blaze) 19\n\nLouis Alhage (Steelheads) 16\n\nOllie Allsop (Hornets) 15\n\nHarris (Knights) 14\n\nBen Page-Laycock (Knights) 13\n\nIzzy Keane (Ravens) 11\n\nMatt Marsh (Hornets) 10\n\nSam Perry (Capitals) 10\n\nJamie Powell (Capitals) 10\n\nLewis (Blaze) 10\n\nJane Lee (Ravens) 10\n\nHornets will take on reigning champions Knights in the Southern Box Lacrosse (SBL) Winter Box League men’s final on Sunday after both teams won their final group stage game to finish first and second respectively in the table.\n\nHornets made it three wins in three at this year’s competition with an impressive 10-4 victory over strugglers Capitals who end week three rock bottom of the table.\n\nKnights picked up a second victory in a row after a convincing 11-5 win over Steelheads who finish in third spot.\n\nOver in the women’s competition, Ravens ensured there is still something to play for on finals day as they claimed their first victory of this year’s series with an 8-4 win over Blaze.\n\nRavens now have the chance to level up the series at 2-2 when the teams meet for a fourth and final time in Oxford on Sunday.\n\nWatch all the action from week three on Lacrosse Live Uk’s YouTube channel HERE.\n\nDay 3 Results\n\nRavens 8-4 Blaze (1-1, 4-1, 1-2, 2-0)\n\nRavens scorers | Keane (4), Bolton (2), Lee, Reynard\n\nBlaze scorers | Sakurai (2), Bottrill, Ford\n\nKnights 11-5 Steelheads (3-2, 5-0, 0-1, 3-2)\n\nKnights scorers | Page-Laycock (4), Harris (3), Burke (2), Edwards, unknown\n\nSteelheads scorers | Alhage (3), Bruce, Thomas\n\nCapitals 4-10 Hornets (1-3, 2-2, 1-2, 0-3)\n\nCapitals scorers | Milner, Payne, Rodberg, Watson\n\nHornets scorers | Allsop (4), Roper (3), Marsh (2), Harrison\n\nFinals Day Fixtures\n\n12:30 | Steelheads v Capitals (3rd Place Play-Off)\n\n14:30 | Hornets v Knights (Final)\n\n16:30 | Blaze v Ravens (Final)\n\n2023 Winter Box League Final Table\n\n# Team Pl.
