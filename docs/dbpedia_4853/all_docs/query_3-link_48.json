        "text": "Depends a lot on what you like at games, if you like Ultras, Sparta has some, if you are a prawn sandwich brigade type they have that too. I personally go for the active fans, so behind the goal for that.\n\nBest way to get there is to take the Metro to Hradcanska stop and then take the tram one stop down which puts you right in front of the stadium. You can also walk from the metro, it's only a couple of blocks. In Prague, it's best to avoid taxis, they are a complete rip off.\n\nNot sure what else you want to know, but feel free to ask.\n\ni've read that often that stadium is half empty (will it be for this match v Teplice?), and having gone with the girlfriend in a side stand this weekend (aston villa v liverpool) i know i want some atmosphere. which is the home end?\n\nnot sure whether there is much trouble at (or outside) Czech games but if there is then any knowledge about places / nearby bars we should avoid would be appreciated.\n\nthough i guess we can avoid the issue by drinking in town n going straight to the match. worth sorting tickets now or just turn up? can u pay on the turnstile?\n\ncheers\n\nThere are a bunch of Ultras and they sit behind the goal. I liked being near them but not part of them (not into right wing politics). There should be not be much trouble, but as to atmosphere, well it's not going to be Anfield by any stretch. If you want a really good crowd that rivals the Premiership in the Czech Republic, go to a hockey game. As far as pubs, nothing I could tell you to avoid. I would say go to the U Kalicha, that's always fun for the Good Soldier Svejk stuff. Tickets should not be an issue. There are ticket windows that are easy to pick out. Other than when the National Team plays, games are rarely sold out. Other than that, the next biggest attended matches are agains Slavia. Teplice shouldn't be a huge one. You'll probably get about 9,000 or so. I would just turn up unless you think you may have trouble actually purchasing your ticket at a window. I never tried to purchase one without speaking Czech, so I couldn't tell you if that's going to be an issue or not.\n\nI don't really post much, but I figured this is a topic I might be able to give some info on. Hradcanska and Sparta area aren't that great for pre/post game bar/restaurants in my opinion, but if you go to Hradcanska and head to the end of Green line at Dejvicka there are many great places, really good pizza place (I think named Grosseto around their). If you sit with the \"Ultras\" you might want to move away if the game goes bad (especially if you aren't Czech and/or don't speak Czech), Sparta fans are benign compared to say Ostrava, but their is a bit of a right wing hooligan elemant mixed in with the die hard that become increasing Neo-Nazi and harsh if the came takes a bad turn. Crowd shouldn't be that big so finding a quieter section isn't a problem. Purchasing tickets at the window shouldn't be a problem speaking English, I briefly dated a British girl of Middle-Eastern ancestry with minimum Czech knowledge and she had gone to a few games with her friends even before we met. (Coincidently an experience with her is why I mention being careful when dealing with the Ultras section if things go bad). I lived in Hradcany (Prague 6) last year, I don't know where you will be staying but if in Prague 6, I can give more reccomendations.\n\nGrosseto is great. Also good is the Modra Zahrada on Parizska street about a block from Staromestske namesti, old town square."
