        "text": "New ICEJ offices open in Central African Republic, Cameroon\n\nThis past weekend, Dr. Mojmir Kallus, the ICEJ’s Vice President for International Affairs, began an extended visit to Africa, beginning with an interdenominational conference on Israel in Bangui, Central African Republic. The three-day gathering was attended by senior church leaders, the Mayor of Bangui, and hundreds of enthusiastic believers. It concluded with the installation of Firmin Ngatoua as national director of our new office for ICEJ-Central African Republic. Mojmir will now continue on to Cameroon for another Israel conference and the opening of our new representation there headed by Apostle Julius Ekie. The ministry trip will finish in Gabon, where our national director and central African regional coordinator, Judicael Monguengui, will host his second annual Israel conference for church leaders from throughout the region and continent.\n\nICEJ-Finland hosts Israel photo exhibit to aid children\n\nTo raise funds in support of ICEJ AID projects for needy children in Israel, our Finnish team led by Jani Salokangas opened a special exhibition last week displaying a selection of beautiful photographs ICEJ-Finland hosts Israel photo exhibit to aid children\n\ntaken in the Land of Israel by ICEJ staff members.\n\nThe exhibition will run for three weeks and is already generating a buzz after the opening night which drew a packed house.\n\nLiberian Christians celebrates Yom Hatzmaut\n\nIn May, ICEJ-Liberia national director Aaron Wright and his team hosted a banquet and a special women’s conference to mark Israel’s Independence Day.\n\nNorway conference features dynamic Israeli speakers\n\nRecently, ICEJ-Norway national director Dag Øyvind Juliussen and his team held a large pro-Israel conference featuring the dynamic Israeli guest speakers Hananya Naftali and Yosef Hadad.\n\nICEJ-UK hosts first of six conferences nationwide\n\nIn April, the ICEJ-UK branch hosted the first of six teaching conferences it has planned around the nation for 2022. David Parsons from the Jerusalem leadership team was the featured speaker at the opening Billinge conference. Over the coming months, other guest speakers will address conferences in Southampton, Lincoln, West Midlands, London and Glasgow. The UK team also has launched a regular “Jerusalem Dispatch” podcast and TV program on Revelation TV with cohosts Simon Barrett and branch director Rev. David Elms.\n\nCzechs and Germans hold Israel solidarity rally in Prague\n\nIn April, several hundred Czech and German citizens filled the streets of Prague in a solidarity march for Israel. Among them were 100 high school pupils from Germany and the Czech Republic who also went the next day to tour the infamous Terezin concentration camp. The main program was held in the garden of the Czech Parliament in Prague and featured the Israeli Ambassador to the Czech Republic, Anna Azari, and top political figures. The solidarity event’s highlight was undoubtedly the presence of Eva Erben, a 92-year-old Holocaust survivor originally from Czechoslovakia and now residing in Ashkelon. Fluent in Czech and German, the lively lady won respect for her charming way of recounting her own horrible story from the Shoah. She made it very clear for everyone why the State of Israel must exist – to protect every Jew who might face persecution. The annual Israel rally has been organized by the ICEJ’s Czech and German offices for 19 years running and has become a fixed tradition of pro-Israel advocacy in central Europe.\n\nICEJ-Fiji welcomes new Israeli Ambassador\n\nICEJ-Fiji recently hosted a welcome banquet for Roi Rosenblit, Israel’s new Ambassador to Fiji and the Pacific Island nations. The reception and dinner took place just after Amb Rosenblit presented his credentials to Fijian President Ratu William Katonivere and paid courtesy calls on the Prime Minister and other senior government figures. The ICEJ’s gala welcome was attended by numerous government, community, business and church leaders, including a previous prime minister plus several current and former cabinet ministers and parliament members. Also attending were medical doctors who received training at Hebrew University Med School through Israel’s Foreign Ministry, military officers who served with UN forces on the Golan, and several Fiji rugby players with Tel Aviv’s pro rugby club. Fine Ditoka, executive secretary at the ICEJ Headquarters in Jerusalem, traveled home for the occasion to coordinate the welcome event and the Ambassador’s official visit to Fiji. ICEJ-Fiji national director Mikaele Mudreilagi warmly welcomed the Ambassador and assured him of the overwhelming Christian support for Israel in Fiji. Amb Rosenblit responded by expressing his keen interest to engage with the Pacific Island nations, especially Fiji due to its strategic role in the region.\n\nWould you like to connect with an ICEJ office in your country?
