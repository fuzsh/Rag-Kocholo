        "text": "Wayne is a former international rugby union referee and has presided over more Rugby World Cup matches than anyone else in history, including the 2023 Rugby World Cup Final.\n\nWith his professional rugby background as one of the world’s leading international sports officials and his specialist legal practice, Wayne is able to bridge the worlds of law and sport. He is regularly instructed by national governing bodies, professional sports organisations, commercial sponsors and rights holders on all aspects of sports law, governance, ethics and safeguarding. He has recently conducted investigations and reviews for the British Judo Association, England Boxing and British Horseracing Authority.\n\nIn addition to sport, his work crosses a variety of industries, including publishing, logistics, energy and natural resources, and infrastructure. He has represented clients being investigated or prosecuted by law enforcement entities such as the UK Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice, and is often called upon to deliver training to companies and individuals on how to avoid regulatory intervention.\n\nWayne is a well-established speaker, presenter and pundit, offering in-depth, expert analysis from his unique position, with an ability to explain the technicalities of law and the nuances of the global game – often sharing his insight into leadership, facing adversity, dealing with pressure and building effective teams with leading international organisations."
