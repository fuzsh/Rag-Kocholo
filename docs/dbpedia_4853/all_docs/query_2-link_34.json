After registration, fill in all fields completely and upload your application documents.\n\nIn order for us to get a comprehensive picture, please submit a resume and, ideally, a covering letter, proof of internships and a current grade sheet or diploma.\n\nThe individual documents should not exceed a size of 5 MB.\n\nThe application process consists of three stages to allow you to best get to know us and us to get to know you. If your application has aroused our curiosity, you will receive an invitation to the online test. You then have 7 days to complete the test. This test includes logical thinking tasks and questions about your personality.\n\nThe second step involves you meeting representatives from the department and the recruiter in a video interview. If you have also successfully mastered this stage, you will be invited to an on-site application day at ZEISS.\n\nOur program is primarily aimed at graduates, so you should have completed your degree no more than 1.5 years ago. Alternatively, you can take a look at our careers page to get to work straightaway.\n\nThe stations you visit depend on the focus you have chosen. Some departments are key for your development at ZEISS, others can be determined by you and your manager. Your previous experience and current projects play a key role in that decision."
