just one goal up at the half-time break having trailed against Scotland, a shut-out second half and 12-goal scoring streak resulted in a comfortable looking 18-5 win.\n\nThey then followed this up with a professional 20-1 victory over Czechia before facing hosts Wales looking to finish on a win and retain the Home Internationals.\n\nEngland went ahead early with three goals in the first 10 minutes, and despite Wales always keeping the game close with strong defence, the result was rarely in doubt, bringing home a 13-7 win.\n\nThe England Senior Men’s final match against Wales became a winner takes all affair as both teams had beaten Scotland and Netherlands in their first two contests.\n\nEngland steamrollered Scotland in their opener, moving 10-0 up at half-time before settling in the second half for a 17-2 scoreline.\n\nThis was then followed again by a flying start against Netherlands, going 6-0 up at the 1/4 time to assert dominance over proceedings and never relinquishing their comfortable advantage to come home 14-4.\n\nIn the decider, Wales caused a stir by going a goal ahead, but England remained unfazed, consistently working to break down the Welsh defence to find the net scoring four in each of the first two quarters for an 8-1 HT lead, finishing the game 14-2 victors and Men’s Home Internationals champions.\n\nIt was a similar situation for our U20 Women as they stamped their authority on the competition with a big 23-5 win against Scotland, followed up by another strong 17-2 victory over guest nation Germany.\n\nThis again set up a decider against Wales who proved to be a step up in competition for the side preparing for this summer’s Women’s World U20 Championship.\n\nIt was relatively low-scoring with England dominating the ball for large periods but being held out by an organised, physical Welsh defence; England only 5-1 up at the half.\n\nThe narrative continued after the break with England never in free scoring mood, but Wales unable to exert little pressure at the attacking end of things and England continued to chip further ahead, ending the match 11-2 ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, a youthful England U20 Men’s side headed to Cardiff for their own international tests against senior opposition.\n\nTheir matchup against Netherlands proved to be one of the most exciting matches of the tournament as they held their own against their older opponents in a back and forth game that they always managed to just keep in front of, celebrating a hard-fought 10-9 win.\n\nThis was then followed up by an impressive 14-5 defeat of Scotland Seniors, even after falling behind early.\n\nScotland took 3-1 lead into the 1/4 time, but the U20s regrouped, slowly chipping away at the lead to eventually sneak 5-4 up at the half, and took that confidence into the third and fourth quarters where they ran out easy 14-5 winners with a 9-1 second half.\n\nPlenty of player and coach interviews with each of the teams from across the weekend can be found on the England Lacrosse YouTube channel.\n\nEngland will take on hosts Hong Kong, China, Ireland, Jamaica, and Japan in Group D at the 2024 World Lacrosse Women’s U20 Championship after World Lacrosse announced the full schedule earlier today.\n\nThey’ll play all four pool stage games over a five day period beginning with Jamaica on 16 August and finishing with a local derby with Ireland on 20 August.\n\nThe 64-game schedule for the Championship, set for 15-24 August, features 20 teams split into four groups for pool play, followed by play-offs that will include quarter-finals, semi-finals and medal games.\n\nThe teams were snake seeded into pools based on their finishes at the 2019 edition of the tournament and balanced by Continental Federation.\n\nCompetition will take place at four venues, highlighted by Mong Kok Stadium, which will host games on the opening day of the tournament, the semi-finals and medal round.\n\nMong Kok seats 6,000 spectators and serves as a regular venue for Hong Kong Premier League Football matches.\n\nThe other three venues – Sham Shui Po, Shek Kip Mei and Kowloon Tsai – are all located within 10 minutes of each other and Mong Kok Stadium.\n\nThe event will commence on 15 August with three games preceding the opening ceremony: Israel v China, Korea v Chinese Taipei, and Mexico v Italy. Following the ceremony, hosts Hong Kong, China will take on Jamaica at Mong Kok Stadium.\n\nThe three medalists from 2019 will make their debut the next day on 16 August as Australia battle New Zealand, Canada take on Wales, and the United States face Germany.\n\nPool play will take place over six days, with each team playing four games. The top two teams in each group will advance to the quarter-finals, which begin on Wednesday 21 August before the semi-finals and eventual medal round games on Saturday 24 August.\n\nThe format ensures high-stakes match-ups during pool play, as teams vie to finish in the top two to advance to the play-offs. Three out of the four groups contain three teams that finished in the top 10 at the last junior women’s championship in 2019, and 15 out of the 16 teams that qualified for the play-offs at the 2022 Women’s Championship are represented in the field.\n\nThe full schedule can be found HERE. Tickets will go on sale to the public in late April/early May.\n\nEngland Schedule (local times)\n\n16 August | Jamaica v England | 5pm\n\n17 August | Hong Kong, China v England | 5pm\n\n18 August |

under-20 World Championship training squad has been on tour in Florida, USA taking on top level opposition as they continue to prepare for the 2024 World Lacrosse Women’s U20 Championship in August.\n\nThe 29-player training squad travelled across the pond with four coaches, including Head Coach Vic Alexander, and took part in a programme of training sessions and scrimmages against American college teams.\n\nThe tour allowed the players to experience a performance environment similar to the one they’ll find at the World Championship in Hong Kong, China.\n\nIt also exposed the players to high-level situations against top quality NCAA athletes who are on the verge of their 2024 college seasons, allowing our England coaches to see how the players cope under pressure and in different match situations.\n\nEngland played five scrimmages in total against the University of South Florida (x2), Florida Southern College, Florida Institute of Technology, and the University of Tampa, with players rotated throughout matches in line with the wider training schedule.\n\nDespite five losses, including a narrow 14-12 defeat to Florida Institute of Technology, the players and coaches have learned a lot and come away with some invaluable experiences ahead of the World Championship.\n\nThe players have been able to build stronger bonds across the squad both on and off the field and the team has made some important connections with lacrosse players from the United States.\n\nFollowing the tour to Florida, the squad will continue to work hard in training sessions with the next big milestone being the annual Home Internationals Series in early April before the final 22-player World Championship squad is announced shortly after.\n\nFlorida Tour Results\n\nThursday 8

Prague on Sunday.\n\nAfter a tense start from both sides, Charlie Bell opened the scoring after 11 and a half minutes but with just 30 seconds left in the first quarter, Czechia were level after Eliška Hanzlová scored her fourth of the tournament.\n\nEngland came out in the second and were very assured in their possession but were unable to turn their control of the ball into goals until Grace Davison found herself high up the pitch and fired home from close range to ensure every single England out-field player scored at the tournament.\n\nCzechia were resolute in their game plan, remaining in the game, and they found themselves level once again when Ellen Pantazopoulou scored direct from a free position.\n\nBut, in what was a turning point in the game, captain Millie Cant put England back in front with the last play of the half.\n\nEngland returned to the field after half-time with renewed confidence and quickly punished Czechia with Sofia Wise keeping up her record of scoring in every game at the tournament before Molly Light capped a brilliant performance in midfield with a goal as well.\n\nCzechia remained within touching distance as Barbora Koděrová hit her team’s third of the day from a free position but England upped the pressure and pulled further ahead through Wise, Annie Mather, Rachael Ball, and Carys Johnson as the game entered the final 15 minutes.\n\nWith 10 minutes left on the clock, Pantazopoulou scored Czechia’s fourth but it proved to be too little, too late as England were able to see the game out and win the Championship title 9-5.\n\nWatch the game in full HERE.\n\nEngland points scorers | Wise (2G, 2A), Ball (1G, 2A), Bell (1G, 1A), Cant (1G, 1A), Davison (1G), Mather (1G), Light (1G), Johnson (1G), Renders

semi-finals in Prague.\n\nAnother four goal haul for Sofia Wise, a hat-trick from captain Millie Cant, and goals for Carys Johnson, Lara Renders, Molly Light, Lucy Evans, Charlie Bell, and Rachael Ball ensured England swept aside Sweden to reach a second successive European Championship final in this age group.\n\nEngland started in their usual quick manner and were 3-0 up with five minutes gone on the clock with goals through Johnson, Cant, and Renders.\n\nBut Sweden, who had scored a massive 64 goals in just four games before the semi-final, were not going to go down without a fight and finished the quarter strongly, getting to within one goal of England as Ava Main and Emma McCrea scored to make the score 3-2.\n\nJust before first quarter time, Bell eased any nerves for England as she fired home from a free-position to see her team go in at the break with their three goal lead still intact.\n\nEngland came back out for the second quarter smelling blood and played a perfect 15 minutes of lacrosse with Wise, Johnson, and Evans all adding to England’s tally within four minutes of the restart.\n\nThen a bizarre moment as England were gifted a goal as Maja Hunter attempted to pass the ball to her goalie under pressure from the England offence but instead played it into her own net.\n\nThis rocked Sweden and England saw out the half, adding another goal in the process through Wise.\n\nA barn-storming second quarter was followed by a slightly more leisurely third from England who eased off Sweden in the opening few minutes, conceding two in quick succession as Main and McCrea gave their team some hope with the score at 9-4.\n\nBut Wise was there again when England needed her, as she has been through the entire tournament, and scored her hat-trick goal followed shortly by her fourth of the game to increase England’s lead before Cant finished off the scoring in the third quarter with her second of the day.\n\nSweden did not lay down, however, and Main grabbed a deserved hat-trick goal early in the fourth before England’s quality and class shone through once again as they finished the game in style, hitting five goals without reply through Cant, Light, Evans, and Bell to see out the game and book a spot in the U21 European Championship final.\n\nEngland will play Czechia in the 2023 ELF Women’s U21 Lacrosse Championship at 2pm BST on

2023 ELF Women’s U21 Lacrosse Championship semi-finals with a huge 24-1 win over Italy in the quarter-final at the Pražačka Sports and Recreation Centre yesterday.\n\nAs has been the case in their previous games, England started on the front foot and found themselves 5-0 up after just nine and a half minutes through top goal-scorer Sofia Wise, Emma Pearce, and a hat-trick from Annie Mather.\n\nDespite their commanding lead, England continued to push for goals and finished the quarter strongly, scoring three more goals before quarter-time as Millie Cant and Molly Light got themselves on the scoresheet as well as a second of the game for Wise.\n\nThe second quarter played out in much the same way as the first with England dominating possession and working themselves into several good positions.\n\nCaptain Ana Green scored her first ever competitive goal for England after she won a foul and converted from the subsequent free position much to the delight of the England fans in the stadium and Green’s team mates; this was followed up with goals from Pearce, Lara Renders, Honor Ashby, and two for Lucy Evans before half-time.\n\nEngland came out after half-time and scored two more quick-fire goals through Ailsa Scott and Cant but as they began to tire slightly in the third, Italy were able to carve out a couple of good periods of possession that eventually led to their one and only goal as Casey Gilbert weaved through the England defence and scored with a brilliant finish.\n\nThat seemed to kick England into action once again and they finished the third quarter with another three goals as Charlie Bell got her name on the scoresheet before Wise and Light grabbed their third and second goals of the game respectively.\n\nAs the game began to wind down to a close in the final quarter, England continued to be ruthless in front of Italy’s goal and ended the game with another five goals as Mather and Wise each scored their fourth, Renders grabbed her second, Cant hit her hat-trick, and Carys Johnson scored her first.\n\nEngland will now play Sweden in the semi-final at 6pm BST tonight (Friday 7 July).\n\nYou can watch the quarter-final game in

Prague despite a spirited performance from the hosts.\n\nHat-tricks from Sofia Wise and Emma Pearce saw England finish the first quarter with a five goal cushion and the score at 6-1.\n\nBut Czechia showed their quality in the second and third, restricting England to just three goals in those periods and reducing the deficit to three.\n\nEngland regrouped in the fourth and final quarter and goals from Carys Johnson, Lara Renders, Pearce, and Ella Dimbylow ensured a 14-7 victory ahead of the team’s second Group A game on Tuesday against Wales.\n\nEngland started with intent in the opening minutes of the game quickly finding themselves a goal up after Johnson picked the ball up just behind the Czechia goal, drove inside and passed to an unmarked Wise who finished with ease.\n\nBefore long England had doubled their lead through Wise once again after she was played in brilliantly by Dimbylow who spotted Wise’s run from deep.\n\nEngland’s third and fourth goals came soon after the second - first through Pearce who finished from the edge of the fan after being played in from behind the goal by Annie Mather and then through Wise who scored her hat-trick goal after being picked out beautifully by captain, Rachael Ball.\n\nTo round off the first quarter, Emma Pearce scored her second of the match in exquisite style after driving toward goal and finishing from range and added her hat-trick goal soon after from a free position.\n\nIn a sign of things to come, Ellen Pantazopoulou scored Czechia’s first goal of the game from a free position with just a couple of seconds left of the first quarter.\n\nAs the game moved into the second and third quarters, Czechia found their stride with E. Pantazopoulou scoring twice either side of another Wise goal for England before Victorie Štědrá and E. Pantazopoulou grabbed another couple for the opposition moments after Rachael Ball had scored from close range for England.\n\nRight at the end of the third quarter, Lucy Evans added another for England just before a Markéta Fišerová goal ensured England went into the fourth with a slender three goal lead.\n\nAny nerves about England not being completely in control of this opening match of the tournament were put to bed at the start of the fourth quarter as Johnson, Mather, Renders, Pearce, and Dimbylow all scored with just one reply from Czechia through Sofie Pantazopoulou.\n\nThe victory sees England top of Group A after one game with Czechia and Wales battling it out in the late game tomorrow.\n\nYou can watch the entire game in full HERE.\n\nEngland points scorers | Wise (4G), Pearce (4G), Ball (1G, 2A), Johnson (1G, 1A), Mather (1G, 1A), Dimbylow (1G, 1A), Evans (1G), Renders (1G), Cant (1A)\n\nCzechia points scorers | E.
