        "text": "Our mission is to Inspire, Engage and Empower all learners and is realised through our compelling student profile, where our students are Curious, Competent, Compassionate Changemakers. Changemaking is at the core of who we are and what we do.\n\nProgrammatically, the International School of Prague is a full International Baccalaureate curriculum (IB) continuum school. Having been a Diploma Programme school for over 25 years, ISP is now authorised as a CP (Career-related Programme) School. We are also offering PYP (Primary Years Programme) for ECF â€“ Grade 5 and the MYP (Middle Years Programme) for Grades 6-10.\n\nElementary School:\n\nISP helps its students to develop a sense of themselves as lifelong learners and problem solvers. To do this, students must acquire skills in reading, writing, math and critical thinking. They must also be armed with the ability to become skillful decision-makers and responsible citizens in a global community. The diversity of our many cultures is a strength that the school uses to make ISP an exceptional educational environment that supports this development.\n\nMiddle School:\n\nThe Middle School program has been especially designed to meet the needs, talents and interests of the young adolescent. ISP believes that the middle school years can be the most productive and exciting of all, despite the stresses of physical change and the uncertainties of identity-formation associated with the age group. Thus, ISP tries to capitalize on the energy, enthusiasm and natural curiosity of emerging adolescents while, at the same time, providing the guidance and structure they need to deepen their knowledge and understanding and to enable them to take increasing responsibility for their own learning."
