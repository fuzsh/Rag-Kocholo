        "text": "Owing to the screen size of your device, you may obtain a better viewing experience by rotating your device a quarter-turn (to get the so-called “panorama” screen view).\n\n“‘The Observer will decide’, I said.”\n\n– Kiteworld,\n\nKeith Roberts\n\nWhy These Are Not Yet in the Lists\n\nRegrettably, I have in recent years been spared little time for further development of this site. While I hope and expect that I will be returning to a heavier commitment to it soon now, in the meantime I thought to augment the site a bit with a list of some books yet-unlisted here but by authors already in the lists.\n\nThe attentive visitor to this site will have noticed that the main lists already contain books not yet read by me—all duly marked with a # sign before the title—and so may wonder why the particular unread books here are not also in those lists. Well, there are some authors who are so good that anything by them can be trusted; and there are others who, if not “for the ages”, are both acceptably good and consistent. Works by either sort may, in my opinion, be recommended unread, subject to two provisos: first, that the recommender—me, in this case—makes it clear that the recommendation is based on repute, not an actual reading; and second, that the book eventually be read and, if regrettably it be necessary to remove it, be removed. Such, in my opinion, are the # books now in the lists.\n\nThere remain quite a number of authors who can at least on occasion rise to acceptable quality, as evidenced by their being represented in these lists at all, but whose output shows significant variations in quality (“quality” always, of course, meaning “quality as I perceive it”). That category naturally includes a number of writers of middling ability, who can now or then hit the bell; but it also includes a nontrivial number of authors of presumed excellence who nevertheless—to me—seem capable of producing occasional potboilers or worse along with their better work.\n\nLet us get one thing clear: this is emphatically not a list of “marginal” works of dubious quality. It is simply a list of works not yet read and evaluated, and (so far as I can tell) of unpredictable quality. So, while it doubtless contains some marginal work (possibly even some drek), it likely also contains not a few wondrous gems. I put it forth simply so that should anyone come to this site looking for some thoughts on where to expand their current reading acquaintance they can have the regular lists—necessarily limited by what one man can read in a given span—augmented by at least plausible suggestions about authors who have already proved, whether once or repeatedly, that they are capable of producing worthwhile reading. Note also that these are by no means complete bibliographies of these writers, even just with the field of speculative fiction.\n\nI also want to make a second thing quite clear: this is also emphatically not a complete bibliography of each of the authors listed here. Some of these authors have huge numbers of works in our fields, and I have not tried to list each and every yet-unread work by those authors. Rather, I have tried to present a reasonable-length sampling of their yet-unread (by me) output as a suggestion (both to you and to myself) of what of theirs to try next. If you want complete bibliographies, go to the Internet Speculative Fiction Database site.\n\nI have, in a few cases, included some limited comments about the author, but only as an aide-memoire, not as any sort of definitive analysis.\n\nAnd I say yet again: I really don’t know much about any of these books save that their respective authors have produced at least some work of merit.\n\n(Remember also that there is also a page here about other candidate authors, not yet represented here but pending consideration.)\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nThe List\n\nIn these listings:\n\nThe standard marks on this site also apply, notably that a * after a book title indicates that it is a collection of tales, not a novel.\n\nThe key distinction in these lists is that a title that is not boldfaced is a work that I am not sure qualifies as either science-fiction or fantasy. (It may also happen that a title that is boldfaced is not either, since I am going by general repute, not actual reading experience.)\n\nAckroyd, Peter *\n\nHawksmoor\n\nEnglish Music\n\nThe House of Dr. Dee\n\nThe Plato Papers\n\nThe Casebook of Victor Frankenstein\n\nMr Cadmus\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAdams, Richard ***\n\nTales From Watership Down *\n\nThe Plague Dogs\n\nTraveller\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAickman, Robert ****\n\nOriginal Collections:\n\nWe Are For The Dark *\n\nDark Entries *\n\nPowers of Darkness *\n\nSub Rosa *\n\nTales of Love and Death *\n\nIntrusions *\n\nNight Voices *\n\nThe Strangers and Other Writings *\n\nReprint Collections:\n\nPainted Devils *\n\nThe Wine-Dark Sea * (New York edition)\n\nThe Unsettled Dust *\n\nThe Collected Strange Stories * [set of two volumes]\n\nThe Late Breakfasters and Other Strange Stories *\n\nCompulsory Games *\n\nNovels:\n\nThe Late Breakfasters\n\nThe Model\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAiken, Joan *\n\nOmnibuses:\n\nAll and More *\n\nAll You’ve Ever Wanted *\n\nMore Than You Bargained For *\n\nFantasy:\n\nAll You’ve Ever Wanted * [see omnibus, above]\n\nMore Than You Bargained For * [see omnibus, above]\n\nA Small Pinch of Weather *\n\nSmoke from Cromwell’s Time *\n\nA Harp of Fishbones *\n\nNot What You Expected *\n\nThe Winter Sleepwalker *\n\nA Handful of Gold *\n\nMoon Cake *\n\nGhostly Beasts *\n\nSnow Horse *\n\nSupernatural:\n\nThe Windscreen Weepers *\n\nA Bundle of Nerves *\n\nDead Man’s Lane *\n\n“Picture Books” (children’s fantasy):\n\nKingdom Under the Sea *\n\nMice & Mendelson *\n\nTale of a One-Way Street *\n\nThe Kitchen Warriors *\n\nFog Hounds, Wind Cat, Sea Mice * aka Fog Hounds & Other Stories *\n\nPast Eight O’Clock *\n\nHelena and the Wild Man *\n\nServe Me Stefan *\n\nWise Girl *\n\nThe Wooden Dragon *\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAmis, Kingsley *\n\nStory Collections:\n\nCollected Short Stories *\n\nComplete Stories *\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAmis, Martin ***\n\nEinstein’s Monsters *\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nArnason, Eleanor **\n\nDaughter of the Bear King\n\nBig Mama Stories *\n\nHwarhath:\n\nHwarhath Stories: Transgressive Tales by Aliens *\n\nRing of Swords\n\nLydia Duluth:\n\nTomb of the Fathers\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nAttanasio, A.
