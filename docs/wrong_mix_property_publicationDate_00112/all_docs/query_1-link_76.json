Cane Island was originally named for the creek that ran through the budding settlement. It grew in earnest upon the arrival of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT) Railroad in 1895. The town later became known as Katy, derived from the “KT.”\n\nMore people settled into the area, most setting up farms and ranches around the town. In 1945, Katy was incorporated. Today, the city serves as the anchor for the Greater Katy area.\n\nFast forward to 2015, when Rise Communities opened Cane Island; Cane Island was the newest master-planned community within city limits. 7 smaller neighborhoods with homes from several reputable home builders were established.
