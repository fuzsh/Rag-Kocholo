The picture he was cleaning showed an armored figure standing in a desolate landscape. It had no weapon, but held a staff bearing a strange stiff banner. The visor of this figure’s helmet was entirely of gold, without eye slits or ventilation; in its polished surface the deathly desert could be seen in reflection, and nothing more.\n\nA later conversation makes clear to Severian, and perhaps the reader, what the image is: ‘See how nice it’s brightening up? There’s your blue Urth coming over his shoulder again, fresh as the Autarch’s fish’ . . . ‘Is that the moon? I have been told it is more fertile.’ ‘Now it is. This was done before they got it irrigated. See that graybrown? In those times that’s what you’d see if you looked up at her. Not green like she is now.’1\n\nThe picture on the wall is of an American astronaut standing on the Moon, near the end of the twentieth century of the Christian era. It is from thousands or millions of years in Severian’s past. This particular image of Earth viewed from another world— a photograph familiar to us from countless reproductions— stands as a complex symbol for different aspects of science fiction in the twentieth century, and therefore for this book. Through science fiction, writers have allowed the problems of humans and of the Earth to be viewed from a distance, as if from an­ other world, or by aliens. This may serve a satiric purpose; much more often, however, this deliberate distancing is intended\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nto offer the reader a refreshingly different, perhaps more ‘sci­ entific’, perspective on the human species and the world it inhabits, just as the passage from Wolfe cited above allows us to see a familiar image in a startlingly new way. This distanced perspective gives science fiction readers an experience very similar to (but much cheaper than) that gained by some Ameri­ can astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts, who have returned to Earth musing on the effects which the sight of Earth from space has had upon their attitudes to nationalism, human conflict, the environment, and the fragility of human achievement when placed in the infinite vastness of galactic space. In addition, this image illustrates the way in which science fiction in this century has prefigured many of the technological advances of the century. In some sense, indeed, science fiction made this image possible: a high proportion of the NASA scientists and engineers involved in the first manned voyage to the Moon were readers of science fiction, and had been inspired by its vision, particularly prevalent in their youth in the 1940s and 1950s, of the conquest of space. Science fiction, through most of this century, has been dominated by American writers; it was American scientists who solved the myriad technological problems which lie behind the taking of that photograph (with a Japanese camera). At the beginning of the twentieth century, that picture would have been science fiction; now, twenty years after the image was captured on film, and after the conquest of space has dwindled to the launching of satellites for commercial, military, or (occasionally) scientific purposes, it is history—and it seems almost as unreal as it had seemed before. The placing of men on the Moon encapsulates the immense scientific and technological changes of this century which have been a major impetus behind the development of science fiction; science fiction has been, above all, the literature which has realized the social and historical importance of those changes and the way in which they will affect the future de­ velopment of the human race. This book is an introduction to science fiction (henceforth usually ‘sf’), intended primarily for those who know little about it. It attempts to be as much a cultural history as a literary history. Indeed, sf is no longer simply a collection of texts which\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\ncan be analysed by a literary critic. Its ideas and icons have permeated the imagery of cinema, television, rock music, and advertising; have come to dominate the world of play, from Ninja Turtles and transformer robots to comics and computer games; and have helped to create religions (like scientology) and popular delusions (like flying saucers). Nor is sf just a col­ lection of texts to many of those who read it; it offers a different way of looking at the world, a substitute for, or complement to, religion and, like religion, a sense of community and of purpose. The book is about the sf o f the twentieth century (without excluding a brief discussion of the origins of sf, and reckoning the twentieth century to begin in 1895 with H, G. Wells’s The Time Machine), looked at from a literary point of view, with an analysis of a selection of key texts. But it is also about the historical relationship in the twentieth century between the growth of sf (and its community of writers and readers) and general cultural, political, and scientific developments. One of its constant concerns is the difference between sf in the United States and in the rest of the world; the history of sf in the latter part of the twentieth century is much involved with the inter­ action between American and other cultures. The main other culture discussed is that of the United Kingdom. The focus is sf in the English-speaking world, for various reasons: world sf remains dominated by Anglo-American sf; other traditions of sf have been much less studied by sf scholars; and, except for French-language sf, it is largely unfamiliar to me. The main underlying thesis of the book is that sf is a major cultural phe­ nomenon, an understanding of which is essential if one wants to comprehend the ways in which Western societies have come to terms with the rapid change and uncertainty which have characterized our century. Another possible title for the book —drawn from a remark of Doris Lessing’s—would have been ‘Science Fiction: A Dialect for Our Times’. If any new insights are forthcoming in what follows, they are likely to arise from the oddity of my background as compared with the backgrounds of other authors of other single-volume introductions to the subject. I am not an sf writer (like Brian W. Aldiss or Lester del Rey) or a full-time sf academic (like\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nEric S. Rabkin or Robert Scholes), let alone both (like James Gunn); most of my professional work has been as an early medievalist. But I have been reading sf now for just over forty years. My earliest reading memory of any kind is of the 27 June 1952 issue of the Eagle, with the first episode of Marooned on Mercury—the third graphic novel, as it would now be called, to feature Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future (hence the dedication of this book to Frank Hampson, Dan Dare’s creator). I joined the British Science Fiction Association ten years later, and became involved in the world of sf fandom: heady experiences for a teenager from the sheltered background of a minor British public school. Even today, I still float on the margins of fandom, go to the odd sf convention, review sf for a number of publications, publish academic articles on the history of sf, and belong to the Science Fiction Research Association (US). Since 1986 I have edited, on behalf of the Science Fiction Foundation (based until 1993 at the Polytechnic of East London, now at the University of Liverpool), Foundation: The Review o f Science Fiction. This journal, the only academic journal outside North America devoted to the history and criticism of sf, publishes some 400 pages of articles, reviews, and debates each year; through it, I have been privileged to get to know some of the most know­ ledgeable and perceptive critics of sf on three continents. Over the years I have found much valuable material in the extensive collection of the Science Fiction Foundation. As an early medievalist, I am used to approaching literary texts as historical documents; I am hardened to making wild generalizations backed by the minimum of data; I have, like many early medievalists, become a cultural historian almost without knowing it. And, most important, I stand outside the mainstream of sf academia, which has been not only strongly North American, but also firmly based within departments of English. Attitudes have certainly changed over the last decade, as the discipline of literary studies has begun to welcome spe­ cialists in popular literature as well as film and other non-print media; but hostility towards sf is still frequently to be found in departments of English. This is one reason why sf academics normally feel constrained to justify their existence by defending\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nsf as ‘high literature’. Authors who can be considered respect­ able, like J. G. Ballard, Philip K. Dick, or Ursula K. Le Guin, have thereby achieved a position in the canon out of all relation to their actual importance in the history of sf as a whole. A cultural historian has none of these worries: for her, Hendrik Dahl’s ‘Monsters of Neptune’ has just as much potential inter­ est as Samuel R. Delany’s ‘Time Considered as a Helix of Semi­ Precious Stones’, and she may not even share the unconscious privileging of print over other manifestations of the sciencefictional imagination. I should like to thank friends and scholars on both sides of the Atlantic—Marleen Barr, John Clute, Graham Ford, Colin Greenland, Eric Rabkin, Brian Stableford, James Walvin, and Gary Westfahl—who looked through the final draft of this book and made innumerable valuable corrections and suggestions. Some of their advice I have ignored; much of it I have accepted, sometimes regretfully, such as the near-unanimous opinion that I should not use ‘she’ and ‘her’ as the generic term for authors and critics (as at the end of the previous paragraph), because it is inappropriate when women remain in the minority in both professions. I should like to thank John Clute for his willing­ ness to share his encyclopaedic knowledge of the field over the telephone and for the timely arrival of John Clute and Peter Nicholls (eds.), The Encyclopedia o f Science Fiction (London, 1993) just as I was finishing my book. It is not only by far the best reference book on sf, but one of the best reference books I know. I have tried to follow its lead on matters of spelling and chronology, and if readers of this book want to follow up any­ thing I have discussed, there is a wealth of information and cross-reference in Clute and Nicholls. Last of all, I offer special thanks to Far ah Mendlesohn, for examining draft after draft of the text without complaint, and for offering me perceptive and informed advice, as well as much-valued encouragement and support. Numerous ideas in this book have emerged in discussions with her, and I hope that this acknowledgement gives her sufficient credit.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction 1 Browsing through the Categories Labels 7\n\n2\n\n1 The Development of a Genre, 1895-1940 12 Sf in 1895 12 1.

I will certainly not make the mistake of trying to begin, or conclude, with a simple definition. Attempts at definition usually seem to imply a belief in a Platonic idea of ‘science fiction’, rather than a bundle of perceptions about what constitutes sf—a bundle whose contents are constantly changing, from decade to decade, from critic to critic, and from country to country. Attempts at defi­ nitions, in other words, frequently appear to be laying down rules about what sf ought to be like, rather than offering some kind of all-embracing description of the great range and wide variety of texts which have been, and are, recognized as making up the body of sf. Definitions are thus frequently closely linked to the desire of sf critics to defend their interests in the face of hostile attacks by emphasizing one element of sf at the expense of others. A cartoon by MacNelly expresses the distance be­ tween the high-flown claims of some defenders of sf and the reality of the average ephemeral sf paperback. Shoe sees his friend reading a book and comments, ‘Not that dumb science fiction junk again. . . ’ ‘Dumb? Obviously your pathetic little pea brain cannot comprehend the intricacy of modern science fiction, Shoe . . . [And here Shoe’s friend moves into determined professor mode.] Science fiction not only allows us to escape our assigned space and time and step into other dimensions. It lets us examine our mundane, earthbound problems from a\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nfresh, original viewpoint. This isn’t comic book stuff here, Shoe! This is p h i l o s o p h y ! Mind-expanding, heavy philosophyW Shoe looks at the book: ‘The Feast o f the KhrooblesT The shame-faced response: ‘It’s about these creatures made of meatloaf who eat Toledo.’ Shoe stares speechlessly, but meaningfully, at the reader.1 ‘Sf’ is a label that can be applied to everything from heavy philosophy to invading meatloaf. Moreover, sf today is certainly very different from sf in 1970, let alone 1930. To understand sf, therefore, one is forced to be a historian. It is with history that I shall begin, looking not only at how sf developed in the first half of the century and how it emerged as a distinct genre in the United States, but also at how definitions of sf changed as sf itself changed; the development of sf as a literary category is bound up with attempts to define it and with attempts by writ­ ers to live up to those definitions. But, first of all, a practical experiment.\n\nBrowsing through the Categories Go into any bookshop or bookstore, and look at the section marked ‘SF’ or ‘Sci-Fi’. Often, to confuse you, the section will actually be called ‘SF and Fantasy’, or even ‘Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror’. In most cases the cover will leave the casual browser in little doubt as to which of those three possi­ ble categories a particular book belongs, at least in the mind of its publisher. A horror novel will bear skulls, teeth, gore, rotten flesh, and creeping things; a fantasy novel will display dragons, elves, wizards, and heroes (or heroines) with swords, mighty thews, and not very many clothes; an sf book can draw on a more varied range of images, but will often feature spaceships, futuristic machinery or architecture, robots, weird alien land­ scapes, and alien creatures. Sometimes covers may hint at a crossing of category boundaries by portraying an alien’s head with its teeth dripping gore, for instance, or a dragon flying across an alien landscape. But most of the covers represent the core of what each genre is ostensibly about, and may suggest to you some possible differences between genres. Horror calls\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\non, plays on, and perhaps exorcizes innate fears of pain, death, and the unknowable; fantasy draws its inspiration from mythol­ ogy and folklore and from popular images of medieval or pre­ industrial society, and often appeals to nostalgia and conserva­ tive values; much sf is concerned with the future and with the possibilities presented by scientific and technological change. And all three are clearly distinguished by their covers from what appears elsewhere nearby, in the sections devoted to popular fiction: corpses with daggers in their backs, men in battledress aiming bazookas, bejewelled women with fancy cars and other symbols of life among the rich and powerful, horsemen in check shirts chasing Indians, haughty Regency-clad gentlemen strid­ ing away from tearful women. Not one of these books, of course, is dealing with the real world; but only sf and fantasy seem to renounce the real world openly, and deal with imaginative alternatives to it. You, the casual browser, might think of all these brands of popular fiction as escapism, and might think that sf and fantasy were the most escapist of all; but if you did a careful comparative study of these books, you might note that only on sf shelves are there serious fictional discussions of the possibilities of survival after nuclear warfare or the consequences of the greenhouse effect or of overpopulation or of the possible dire consequences of genetic engineering. And if you thought about it, you might see that sf (and, to a lesser extent, fantasy), because they deal with imaginative alternatives to the real world, also frequently offer criticism of that world—and thus may, in short, be much more subversive than anything else that is marketed as ‘popular fiction’. Frank Cioffi, who has looked at early sf as ‘formula fiction’, has argued that the subversive qualities of sf and its estranging ‘other worldly’ qualities distin­ guish it from popular fiction; Far ah Mendlesohn has argued that it is rather more useful to think of sf as a form of elite fiction, the elite being of a technocratic, rather than a literary, intelligentsia.2 Sf is what is marketed as sf: that is a beginning, but no more. Almost everything which is labelled ‘sf’ is sf, but there is a great deal which is not so labelled which, in terms of approach and content, seems to belong to the same category. Move away\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nfrom the ‘SF’ section, and go to general fiction. Pick up Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park (1990). It would seem to be about the extraction of DNA from fossils and the re-creation of living dinosaurs for display in a theme park some time in the near future. It is a subject that has been treated before, by sf writers. Those in the know will be aware that Crichton has written other sf books, as well as being the director of several success­ ful sf films, such as Westworld and Coma. But the book is not marketed as sf; Crichton and his publishers know that his book will sell to a wider readership if it is marketed as a thriller. The label ‘s f , however proudly worn by many sf authors, is one that repels readers as frequently as it attracts. There are two categories of sf book in particular which es­ cape the label ‘sf’. The first are those books produced by sf authors who actually have ambitions at literary quality and at recognition by the critics who review ‘serious’ fiction in the weekly reviews or the Sunday review sections; they know the repellent characteristics of sf very well, and publishers are happy to conspire with them. A paperback original clearly labelled ‘sf’ has no chance of being taken seriously by literary reviewers; a hardback labelled ‘sf’ will usually be distributed only to special­ ist bookshops (a major non-specialist bookshop in New York solemnly assured Samuel R. Delany once that Isaac Asimov’s latest hardback couldn’t possibly be sf, because they stocked it3); a soberly presented hardback which avoids the letters ‘sf’ anywhere on its dust-jacket has some real chance of success. Pick up the UK hardback of George Turner’s The Sea and Summer (Faber and Faber, 1987; sadly, it is out of print, but this is an imaginary bookshop). The back cover tells us that it is set in the twenty-first century, as the greenhouse effect raises the sea-level and begins to drown Melbourne. But it is George Turner’s new ‘novel—marked as is all his work,not only by compelling imagination but by powerful intelligence’, not his new sf novel. The inside back flap reveals that Turner is ‘one of Australia’s leading novelists’, and mentions his other novels, without saying that all but one are sf, or that Turner is also one of Australia’s leading sf critics. Turn to J. G. Ballard’s most recent collection of short stories, War Fever (Collins, 1990).\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nAgain, the dust-jacket, with its biography of the writer, avoids all use of the terrible phrase ‘science fiction’, the only hint being the remark that Ballard’s first short story was published in New Worlds (the initiated will know that this was the most celebrated of the British sf magazines). Yet the stories, several of which were first published in genre sf magazines in the 1980s, are all, save one, sf, and very much more traditional sf than Ballard was writing in the early 1970s. But since Empire o f the Sun (1984), Ballard has been lionized by the British literary estab­ lishment, and therefore cannot be an sf writer. The second category is the situation in reverse. Every now and then authors who have made their names outside the field (and often without knowledge of the field) will produce a novel which every sf reader will recognize as sf—even if the author sometimes does not deal with the problems of subtly presenting an unfamiliar world to the reader as deftly as most professional sf writers do today. These authors will be indignant if the work is treated as sf; their loyal non-sf readers will be equally indig­ nant if the book is classed in the despized category. I am think­ ing of The Handmaid's Tale (1985) by the Canadian poet and novelist Margaret Atwood and The Children o f Men (1992) by the British writer of detective stories, P. D. James, but there are numerous others. In some ways this refusal to ghettoize by slapping the label ‘sf on a book is healthy, both for the reading public and for the author. More readers are, perhaps, introduced to the sciencefictional imagination (even if they may not realize that is what it is). Authors have the literary recognition that would be de­ nied to them within the ghetto, and may feel that they do not have the literary constraints that writing within the narrow confines of the sf genre would impose. Motifs and themes from sf are thus drawn into the world of contemporary fiction, fos­ tering a cross-fertilization that enriches both sf and the wider field of literature. In the 1960s both Kurt Vonnegut, jun., and John Wyndham (John Beynon Harris) managed to escape the sf label, even if they may have refused ghettoization for com­ mercial rather than artistic reasons, and thereby achieved a much wider readership than they would have received in the ghetto.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nGhettos are often culturally rich, of course, and their culture may well be destroyed by the breaking down of the ghetto walls. But for society as a whole, ghettoization, in any sense, can only be a cultural impoverishment, an exclusion, a refusal to admit the validity of different ideas or standards; and bringing a few names out of the ghetto does nothing to break down the walls or to help make sf better appreciated in the literary com­ munity. The standard reaction is: ‘This is good; therefore it can­ not be science fiction.’ The cultural reasons behind the common prejudice against sf, both among apparently informed readers and critics and also among the general reading public, will be examined later. Publishers have had an impact upon this preju­ dice, however. The popular image of sf is expressed in those spaceships, robots, or aliens on the covers of paperbacks which publishers have decided express the essence of the field; no matter that a spaceship may appear on the cover of an sf book which in fact deals with a pre-industrial and non-technological culture (a misrepresentation which, admittedly, was more common in the 1970s than now, and more so in the UK than the USA). Most publishers appear to want to define sf as no more than another genre of popular fiction, like westerns or romances; they believe it will help the many readers who want to be led quickly to the only type of fiction which they are prepared to read (even if it also discourages those with un­ tested prejudices from ever venturing into new areas). Publish­ ers treat sf as a genre: that is, a body of writing which has a consciousness of a shared range of conventions and approaches and themes. I have been suggesting above that there are works of sf which are produced and published outside the genre. But it is important to note that there are many writers, readers, critics, and academics who are prepared to accept this narrow publishers’ definition, and who thus effectively recognize as sf only those works which are consciously written as contributions to the genre, normally by writers who think of themselves pri­ marily as sf writers. Sf was first named, and first became a genre, in the sf magazines published in the United States before the Second World War; not surprisingly, it has thus tended to be American readers and critics who narrow the definition of sf in this way. Not surprisingly also, their image of sf is dominated\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nby American sf, and primarily American sf after 1926 (the year the first specialist sf magazine, Amazing Stories, was pub­ lished). The history of the development of the genre, which is also the history of the establishment of the ghetto walls, is certainly an extremely important part of the history of sf, and we shall examine it in the first chapter; it runs alongside the history of labels, the topic of the next section. But to exclude from the study of sf works which have avoided the label, either because they were written before the label’s invention or be­ cause they were deliberately written and published outside the ghetto, would be to distort the subject. It would devalue the contribution made by non-American writers: not only Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, but also Karel Capek, Olaf Stapledon, Doris Lessing, and many others. It would also deny sf—the child of Gothic horror, of utopian tract, of travellers’ tale, of scientific prognostication—some of its considerable variety. Perhaps even more seriously, it would deny the student of sf any opportunity to examine those writers who, in much more recent years, have written works which may well be sf, and certainly have much in common with it, who would never be found in our imaginary bookstore alongside the so-called big three, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Robert A. Heinlein: writers such as Peter Ackroyd, Donald Barthelme, Jorge Luis Borges, William Burroughs, Angela Carter, Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon, and many others. Sf is a genre, therefore; and genre sf (now produced all over the world and not just in the USA) stands at the core of the subject and of this book. But it does not constitute the whole of sf. And this is the nub of the problem of definition. We might agree on a definition of genre sf (though no one has, so far); but there have always been problems on the fringes, and there always will be, as long as there are some writers who refuse to write work which can be readily labelled. v\n\nLabels The phrase ‘science fiction’ first appears in 1851, in a treatise on the poetry of science by the English writer William Wilson:\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nCampbell [the Scottish poet Thomas Campbell] says that ‘Fiction in Poetry is not the reverse of truth, but her soft and enchanting resem­ blance’. Now this applies especially to Science Fiction, in which the revealed truths of Science may be given, interwoven with a pleasing story which may itself be poetical and true—thus circulating a knowledge of the Poetry of Science, clothed in a garb of the Poetry of Life.4\n\nWilson marvels at the poetry lying behind the wonders of crea­ tion—the fact that a tear-drop ‘holds locked in its transparent cells an amount of electric fire equal to that which is discharged during a storm from a thunder-cloud’, or that ‘minute insects have built whole islands of coral reefs up into light from the low deep bed of the vast ocean’; his musings have a close re­ lationship to the ‘sense of wonder’ which sf critics have dis­ cerned as one of the major pleasures of the genre (see below, p. 103). Wilson also finds poetry in current technological change, as no doubt did others in that year of the Great Exhibition: ‘The modern discoveries and applications of Science throw deeply into the shade the old romances and fanciful legends of our boyhood.’ And stories and poetry about science, replacing the old romances, will in future be a means of instruction for children. Except for an editorial response to a 1927 letter to Amazing Stories: The Magazine o f Scientifiction,5 no one used the phrase ‘science fiction’ again until 1929, when the New York publisher Hugo Gernsback, who had just lost control of Amazing Stories, decided to replace his own coinage ‘scientifiction’ by a less cumbersome term for his new magazine Science Wonder Sto­ ries. And, by an odd coincidence (for William Wilson had been long forgotten), Gernsback’s own prospectus for sf was not that different from Wilson’s: Not only is science fiction an idea of tremendous import, but it is to be an important factor in making the world a better place to live in, through educating the public to the possibilities of science and the influence of science on life. . . If every man, woman, boy and girl, could be induced to read science fiction right along, there would cer­ tainly be a great resulting benefit to the community .. . Science fiction\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nwould make people happier, give them a broader understanding of the world, make them more tolerant.6\n\nGernsback, arguably, not only invented the term for sf but also invented it as a self-conscious genre. But most modern com­ mentators are happy to use the phrase ‘science fiction’ for the very considerable number of stories of the same kind which pre-dated Gernsback, not only those by Verne and Wells (or, earlier, Mary Shelley and Edward Bulwer-Lytton), but also those by a host of other authors; the modern bibliographer Everett F. Bleiler lists over 3,000 sf stories and novels published in English before 1930. There was no generally accepted contemporary terminology for these stories of adventures in space or time, of amazing inventions, or of romances on other planets. The sto­ ries of Jules Verne, published as voyages extraordinaires in France, were published as ‘scientific romances’ in Britain, and Wells was using that term informally to describe his ‘sf’ as early as 1897; he sometimes referred to his less plausible stories as ‘scientific fantasies’. In Britain ‘sf’ books were often subtitled ‘A Romance’ or ‘A Romance of the Future’. There was more variety in the United States. ‘Romance’ was used, and, as early as 1876, ‘scientific fiction’. The prolific American publisher of dime novels, Frank Tousey, used the phrase ‘invention stories’ in the 1880s. Frank Munsey, publisher of the magazine Argosy, used phrases like ‘off-trail stories’ and ‘impossible stories’. The most frequent label was simply ‘different stories’; this contin­ ued until the 1920s, when it was replaced by ‘pseudo-scientific stories’. Gemsback’s Science and Invention magazine published some fiction, and after 1922 this was referred to as ‘scientific fiction’; Argosy itself started using the term in the late 1920s.7 The triumph of the term ‘science fiction’, after its introduction in 1929, was rapid in the United States, at least among readers and publishers of sf magazines. The first fan magazine, The Planet, which started in 1930, from the beginning favoured ‘sci­ ence fiction’, even though it continued to use ‘scientific fiction’ and ‘scientifiction’ (and sometimes used all three terms in one paragraph). Amazing shifted definitively to ‘science fiction’ at the end of 1932. By then there were few opponents to the new\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nterm within the field in the United States; the only disagree­ ment was about whether the two words should be hyphenated or not. The outside world was somewhat slower to recognize the term. The US librarians’ Readers3 Guide to Periodical Lit­ erature used ‘pseudo-scientific stories’ as a heading right through the 1930s and 1940s, and only in 1949 introduced ‘science fiction: see pseudo-scientific stories’. ‘Pseudo-scientific’ disappeared from the Readers’ Guide altogether only in 1961. By then ‘science fiction’ had become firmly established not only in the United States and Britain, but in much of the rest of the world as well. The importation of American sf magazines into Britain and, from August 1939, the publication of A s­ tounding Science-Fiction in a British edition introduced British readers to the term; ‘scientific romance’ disappeared as the American market began to dominate. ‘Science fiction’ neatly transferred into French and into countries where English terms were readily accepted, such as Sweden and Holland. ‘Science fic­ tion’ was eventually accepted in Germany, after a long struggle with utopische Romane. It is not the same in all languages, many of which have adopted some translation of ‘science fantasy’: this is true in Chinese and Italian (fantascienza), while the Rus­ sian nauchnaia fantastika (or just fantastika) has been the stan­ dard term since the 1920s. The Japanese just call it SF, ‘blithely adding the English acronym to their melange of Chinese characters and homegrown syllabaries’.8 Even as ‘science fiction’ was established, it became common to abbreviate it: stf (originating as an abbreviation of ‘scientifiction’, pronounced stef), sf (or SF or S-F, pronounced essef), and sci-fi (rhyming with its model, hi-fi). Stf reached its peak in the early 1940s, and has since faded away. The other two ab­ breviations have become something of a shibboleth, with those who use ‘sci-fi’ being dismissed as neophytes or outsiders by the initiates, who sometimes pronounce it ‘skiffy’ and use it to mean low-grade mass-market science fiction (like the film Star Wars, for instance), reserving ‘sf’ for science fiction of (to them) greater value. ‘Sci-fi’ has become common within film and television circles, however; it is not going to die out. The move towards ‘sf’ was not just a move to a shortened\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nform; its use became more widespread because of dissatisfaction with the term ‘science fiction’ itself. As we shall see in the following chapters, when the boundaries of science fiction grew, and as the aims of science fiction writers changed, particularly from the late 1940s, ‘science fiction’ began increasingly to seem an unhelpful label. ‘Sf’ had the advantage that it could be trans­ lated as ‘speculative fiction’ (by Robert Heinlein first, but by many others, particularly in the late 1960s and early 1970s) or ‘science fantasy’, ‘speculative fantasy’ (Alexei and Cory Panshin), ‘scientific fantasy’, ‘science fable’ (Judith Merril), or, most re­ cently, ‘structural fabulation’ (Robert Scholes). This freedom suited some people’s concepts of what the genre had become, or should be, much better than the old ‘science fiction’, with what many people saw as its off-putting technological and often technophilic associations. One could even begin to revel in the oxymoronic properties of a phrase, ‘science fiction’, which brought into union two incompatible concepts, ‘science’ and ‘fiction’: ‘basically, SF is a developed oxymoron, a realistic irreality, with humanized nonhumans, this-worldly Other Worlds, and so forth.’9 The establishment of a near-universal label (or labels) and discussions about the relative merits of ‘science fiction’ and ‘sf’ were closely tied up with the emergence of sf as a genre, and hence with a concern to determine what the genre actually was and what its boundaries were. That there is no generally agreed definition of sf is, of course, largely a result of the fact that since 1929 sf has been in a state of constant change.\n\n1 The Development of a Genre 1895-1940\n\nSF in 1895 This study of sf in the twentieth century begins not in 1900, but in 1895: the publication date of one of the greatest of all science fiction tales, and one of the earliest and best its author ever wrote— The Time Machine by H. G. Wells. Wells has some­ times been called the Father of Science Fiction. He was certain­ ly prominent in the field and immensely influential; but the force of this section is to show that he was mining what had become quite a familiar literary node, and that although he was the best, he was by no means the only contributor to the field in 1895. What would later be called sf was in fact in the middle of its first important boom when The Time Machine was pub­ lished. Fifty-two items of sf were published in English in that year, twenty-seven by British authors, twenty-two by Americans, one by an Australian, and two translated from French.1 Among them the stories represent most of the categories which we might recognize as sf, even though our problems of definition create disagreements concerning the boundaries. E. F. Bleiler, for instance, denies ‘prehistoric fiction’ the status of sf that other critics would allow, but accepts the ‘lost race’ story, which Darko Suvin would deny is ‘sf’ at all (see below, p. 109). The most important thing to remember, however, is that no one in 1895 would have thought that all these works belonged to a singie branch of fiction at all: all that they possess in common is th eir. similarity to works which, by the second half of the twentieth century, would be known as science fiction. It is useful to divide these fifty-two items, and the rest of nineteenth-century sf, into a number of categories based on\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n13\n\nsubject-matter; it was subject-matter, as much as objective or mode of narrative, which later determined membership of the genre. There was the extraordinary voyage (within which we might place the lost race story); the tale of the future (includ­ ing utopias, tales of future war, and what Stableford calls ‘eschatological fantasies’, like The Time Machine itself2); and the tale of science (notably concerned with marvellous inventions). But, as our 1895 sample shows, there are numerous cases of overlap: the extraordinary voyage often ends with the discovery of a utopia, for instance, or it may be dependent on a marvellous invention as a means of travel; while tales of future war may sometimes be about the impact of new inventions upon warfare, or have utopian elements. Moreover, there are some stories from 1895 which cannot be placed in categories, even though they may be seen as prefiguring twentieth-century categories. Thus, Castello N. Holford’s Aristopia (US) can hardly be seen as a standard utopian novel, in that his fictional utopia was founded in seventeenth-century America, according to Thomas More’s principles, in an alternative history framework which was to see the state of Aristopia take over all North America at the time of the Revolution in 1776. Alternative history is now a flourishing sub-genre within sf, but in 1895 this work stood alone. Despite the success of Mark Twain’s A Con­ necticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889; UK: A Con­ necticut Yankee at the Court o f King Arthur, 1889), there is no category of time-travel; Grant Allen’s The British Barbarians (UK), in which a time-traveller from the twenty-fifth century comments unfavourably on the barbaric customs of the British in 1895, is instead part of the strong satirical tradition in sf. As long as we are aware of the problems, some examination of the main categories may be helpful, above all, in establishing something of the ancestry of twentieth-century sf. 1. The Extraordinary Voyage Of the three main categories, the extraordinary voyage has probably the oldest history. The medieval tales about the voyages of Sir John Mandeville, much reprinted in the post-Caxton era, were, during the age of Columbus and the discoveries, to\n\n14\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\ndevelop into the full-blown genre of the imaginary voyage. Much early utopian writing, such as Thomas More’s Utopia, Sir Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, or Tommaso Campanella’s The City o f the Sun, fits very neatly into this genre, and utopian comment was indeed a frequent element of these imaginary voyages. There were at least 215 stories of imaginary voyages published in Western Europe and America in the eighteenth century,3 of which Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726) is undoubtedly the best known. Most of the stories of imaginary voyages written in the nineteenth century continued to be about the discovery of marvellous or mysterious people and places in the remoter parts of the world; it was not, after all, until the present century that the globe became too well known for people seriously to imagine that marvels still awaited discovery. There are nineteenthcentury tales of imaginary voyages which discover lost races in every conceivable corner of the Earth’s surface, as well as a large sub-genre which finds them inside a hollow Earth, following the once fashionable theories of John Cleves Symmes (d. 1829).4 Voyagers inside the hollow Earth found whole solar systems, the Garden of Eden, dog-headed humans, utopian societies, and prehistoric monsters. In one of the most interesting and impressive nineteenth-century examples, Mary E. Bradley Lane’s feminist Mizora (US, 1890), the heroine, Vera Zarovitch, found an all-female society, lacking not only men, but also crime, religion, class, disease, domestic animals, and brunettes (bru­ nettes were considered troublesome). In 1895 seventeen examples of the extraordinary voyage were published. Charles Dixon’s Fifteen Hundred Miles A n Hour (UK) was a boys’ story about a German inventor who took some young friends with 'him to Mars, to meet Martians. Gustavus Pope’s sequel to his Journey to Mars (1894), Journey to Venus (US), was an early example of what became a cliche, that Venus was the jungle home of prehistoric monsters and cavemen. Not all the travel was by spaceship: Edgar Fawcett’s The Ghost o f Guy Thyrle (US) had a drug which allowed a scientist to roam at will in his astral body, to the Moon and the stars; while Tremlett Carter’s The People o f the Moon (UK) used the occult device of astral projection in order to explore the\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n15\n\nMoon, and Willis Mitchell’s The Inhabitants o f Mars (US) had his protagonist study the utopian society of Mars under hypnosis. Earth had lost races galore: Howard De Vere’s A Trip to the Center o f the Earth (US) found one underground; Henry Clay Fairman’s The Third World (US) found it underground, at the North Pole; Andre Laurie’s The Crystal City under the Sea (translated from French) found Atlantis and the Atlanteans under the sea; A. S. Morton’s Beyond the Palaeocrystic Sea (US) found a lost race of Vikings beyond the polar sea; and Rider Haggard’s Heart o f the World (UK) found his lost race in Central America. Some of the lost race stories were making very obvious points: both R. D. Chetwode’s The Marble City (UK) and Paul Haedicke’s The Equalities o f Para-Para (US) parody and attack socialism, while in The Mysterious Mirage, a ‘Frank Reade, Jr.’ dime novel (US), the members of the lost race were blond, blue-eyed Hebrews, preserved in their origi­ nal form, because their remoteness had prevented any inter­ marriage with inferior races. Other ‘Frank Reade, Jr.’ dime novels of 1895—The Chase o f a Comet, The Electric Island, and Lost in a Comet’s Tail, one of the very first stories of space rescue—were extraordinary voyages concerned much more with adventure and marvellous machines. It ought to be obvious from these brief descriptions that some writers found inspiration in a contemporary writer who had made his living out of ‘extraordinary voyages’: Jules Verne. ‘Voyages extraordinaires’ was the general title of the series of books which Verne wrote for the publisher Jules Hetzel: one or two a year for over forty years following, the first novel in 1863. Verne’s voyages took him and his many readers all over the globe, from South America to Antarctica and to the centre of the Earth, from under the seas to the Moon and around it, and beyond into the further reaches of the solar system. Less than a quarter of his sixty-four novels (the later ones written with, or by, his son Michel) could be counted as sf, but it is notable that those were among the most widely read when they were first published, and have remained so. Verne, particularly in his early career, was an enthusiastic prophet of scientific progress, and saw his own ‘Voyages extraordinaires’—subtitled Les Mondes\n\n16\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nconnus et inconnus (Known and, Unknown Worlds)—as a di­ dactic work in many volumes which shows his readers how the universe was ‘forcibly linked to the idea of progress,. . . a universe where the line between the conquests already achieved by science, and those which have not yet been achieved, [was] constantly moving’. Verne was not interested in speculation or in using science to develop his fiction; for this reason, a dis­ tinction would be made by some critics between Verne’s scientific fiction and genuine sf.5 Verne and Wells have frequently been thought of as the pioneers of the tale of the extraordinary voyage into outer space, the most typical of all science-fictional themes. Stories of travel to the Moon have a venerable ancestry, going back to Lucian (second century c e ), Francis Godwin (The Man in the Moone, 1638), and Cyrano de Bergerac (LAutre Monde, 1657). But the popular impression has been that Verne and Wells were the first to raise this fable to the status of scientific prophecy. There are two points to be made about this. First, one might argue that neither Verne nor Wells took their space travel stories very seriously; both Verne’s Hector Servadac (cadavres backwards) and Wells’s The First Men in the Moon have far more than their authors’ normal ration of humour and satire in them. Second, and more to the point, by the time of Verne and Wells, tales of interplanetary and even interstellar travel had, in lesser hands, become familiar, if not commonplace. Nor should modem readers find it surprising that fictional travellers to other planets in the nineteenth century found life, intelligent and otherwise; many scientists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were convinced that such life could, and did, exist.6 (Although, in one of those information lags of'which several instances can be found in the history of sf, writers were elaborating the theme at the precise point, in the late nineteenth century, when more and more scientists were beginning to doubt the possibility of in­ telligent life, at least in our solar system.) One of the most interesting early tales of interplanetary travel was Percy Greg’s Across the Zodiac (1880), which is in many ways an astonishing prefiguration of twentieth-century sf. The English hero builds a spaceship, and deals with the problem of maintaining an air\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n17\n\nsupply by taking plants along with him to provide the oxygen. He travels to Mars, where he finds that the Martialists [s/c] have established a high-technology utopia, the details of which, including not only social arrangements but even language and proverbs, are worked out by Greg with considerable care. If Verne was not the only early writer of stories of extra­ ordinary voyages, there is no doubt that he had an enormous influence upon sf. His major science-fictional ‘Voyages extra­ ordinaires’ were translated into English soon after publica­ tion: A Journey to the Centre o f the Earth (1863) appeared in London in 1872 and New York in 1874; From the Earth to the Moon (1865) was published in Newark, New Jersey, in 1869 and with its sequel Round the Moon (1869) in London in 1873 and New York in 1874; Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (1870) was published in London and New York in 1873; and so on. He was also very widely imitated, in Europe and in the United States, and was an influence on the earliest American magazine sf some fifty years after his greatest works appeared (nearly all in the 1860s and 1870s). From its first issue in 1926 and for years thereafter, Amazing Stories had a drawing of Jules Verne’s tomb at Amiens on its title-page, the immortal Verne in the act of raising the lid of his tombstone to peer into his own future. 2. The Tale o f the Future Verne almost invariably set his science-fictional tales in the present or in a future indistinguishable from the present; he wanted to show his readers that scientific and technological changes were occurring in their own society, and that more were imminent. There is nothing in Verne of that vision of the far future which was to be found in The Time Machine. Wells was in a worthy tradition, one which went back, arguably, to Jewish apocalyptic writings like the book of Daniel and the New Testament book of Revelation: the prophecy of the end of all things, but seen in a secular, post-Darwinian, guise. An important predecessor, ‘an event of high significance in the history of secular eschatology, and in the history of the secularization of Western consciousness itself’,7 was Mary\n\n18\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nShelley’s The Last Man (1826). Taking her cue from the chol­ era epidemic of the 1820s and inspired also by Cousin de Grandville’s Le Dernier Homme (1805), Shelley described the course of a plague, how it destroyed a Europe on the brink of utopia at the end of the twenty-first century, and how her romantic hero, Verney, wandered in vain through Europe searching for other survivors, until, at last, having reached St Peter’s in Rome, he plans to carry his search to other continents. Musings upon the future death of civilization were to have a long history within sf: Richard Jefferies’ After London (1885) is the most distinguished nineteenth-century successor to Shelley, but the entire sub-genre of sf concerned with the destruction of civilization by nuclear holocaust or other disaster and the numerous sf magazine illustrations of drowned, mutilated, or toppled Statues of Liberty are in the same tradition. Sf writers have derived from the Gothic fiction of Shelley and her con­ temporaries a fascinated and appalled delight in the contem­ plation of death and destruction on a large scale: a considered reaction to complacency in the face of a dangerous universe. When Mary Shelley wrote, tales of the future had not themselves had a very long history. There are two texts from the mid-seventeenth century and two from the mid-eighteenth century, and that is all until Louis-Sebastien Mercier’s L A n 2440 (1771) (published in English as Memoirs o f the Year Two Thousand Five Hundred, 1772). In this story, the narrator falls asleep and wakes up some 750 years later, to find himself in a utopian society (utopia on French Enlightenment lines, natu­ rally, in which women were placed more firmly under their husbands’ control than in Mercier’s own France). ‘Rip Van Winkle’ (or, much earlier, ‘The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus’) is a literary device to be repeated often, right into the twentieth century, through Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward and Wells’s When the Sleeper Wakes. Mercier’s story is the first utopia ever set in the future. From his time the utopian tale increas­ ingly becomes a ‘tale of the future’ rather than an imaginary voyage: a shift, in the terminology of some utopian specialists, from eutopia (‘good place’) to euchronia (‘good time’). The change, of course, is linked to a realization that the past was\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n19\n\nvery different from the present (an idea that only slowly gained currency from the sixteenth century onwards) and that the future was going to be very different, too. When linked to the idea of progress, which became more and more a part of nineteenthcentury thought, the tale of the future almost inevitably had utopian overtones; very frequently, that utopianism was heavily tinged with socialism, an increasingly influential nineteenthcentury political philosophy and one of the first to dream de­ liberately of better futures. Paul Alkon has unearthed an early text by Felix Bodin which, astonishingly, laments how the tale of the future has fallen victim to the utopia and the apocalypse: why can’t we have novels set in the future, he asks in his Le Roman de Vavenir (1834)? If ever anyone succeeds in creating the novel, the epic of the future, he will have tapped a vast source of the marvelous, and of a marvelous entirely in accord with verisimilitude . .. which will dignify reason in­ stead of shocking it or deprecating it as all the marvelous epic machin­ ery conventionally employed up to now has done. In suggesting perfectibility through a picturesque, narrative, and dramatic form, he will have found a method of seizing, of moving the imagination and of hastening the progress of humanity in a manner very much more ef­ fective than the best expositions of systems presented with even the highest eloquence.8\n\nBodin is calling for sf as a tool for education in similar terms to those used by Hugo Gernsback a century later. His plea for something more than utopia was not heeded (indeed, his whole treatise had no discernible influence at all). There are still utopian tales of the future in our 1895 sample. There is Amelia Garland Mears’s Mercia, the Astronomer Royal (UK), which depicts Britain in 2002, where women are emancipated and can become astronomers-royal, like Mercia, and in which solar power, psychic science, a world tribunal, and (it is delicately implied) a rigid system of birth control have combined to produce a near perfect world. Other utopian fu­ tures include Edward Bellamy, ‘Christmas in the Year 2000’ (US), reflections on (and criticisms of) nineteenth-century Christmas by someone writing in 2000; Titus Smith, Altruria (US); and Albert Chavannes, In Brighter Climes, or, Life in\n\n20\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nSocioland. None of these would have been written had it not been for the tremendous success of another book: Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward, 2000-1887 (US, 1888), the most influential of all nineteenth-century utopias. Bellamy’s own 1895 piece was one of several postscripts to his own novel; the novels by Smith and Chavannes were two of the fifty or so utopian novels inspired by Looking Backward, both supporting and countering Bellamy’s arguments. The most famous of them was English: William Morris’s News from Nowhere (serialized, 1890; published as a book 1890, US, and 1891, UK), a utopian vision of a post-revolutionary England which itself inspired generations of British socialists. Reaction to Bellamy’s book today (as I learn each year from students) usually includes boredom with the lecturing style of Dr Leete and irritation at the coquettish­ ness of his heroine daughter, Edith; in the United States, one might add also hostility to its state socialism and its attacks on free market capitalism. But the reaction in the nineteenth century was mostly much more positive. There can be few sf books which have become such enormous best-sellers; there are certainly none which, within two years of publication, in­ spired the founding of 162 political clubs (Bellamy clubs) in twenty-seven states and the creation of political magazines like the Nationalist and the New Nation and of a political move­ ment, a specifically American version of socialism called, con­ fusingly, Nationalism. From our present point of view it is worth underlining that Looking Backward is indeed sf, by most definitions. The means by which Julian West was transported from 1887 to 2000 are perhaps not plausible even by nineteenth-century scientific standards; since West had insomnia, he was mesmerized each night, in an air-tight, sound-proof room underneath his Boston home, when one night a fire destroyed the house, and he slept on, until woken by Dr Leete in the year 2000. But thereafter the logic is maintained, and the standard nineteenth-century device whereby it is all discovered to be a dream at the end is neatly turned on its head: he ‘awakes’ near the end to find himself in his nightmarish capitalist Boston of 1887—but then discovers that this is a dream, and that, to his relief, he is still\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n21\n\nin 2000 with his beloved Edith. Most of the novel is taken up with his exploration of the social system in 2000, through the lengthy disquisitions of Dr Leete. It is a society that has shaken off the injustices and inequalities of the capitalist system (the few pages at the beginning which describe life under capitalism are the most passionate and memorable of the whole book); all adults have the same wage, which cannot be accumulated year by year or passed on to heirs; all alike must work in the indus­ trial army until retirement at the age of 45; the efficiency of the large scale (a few large department stores rather than large numbers of small-scale enterprises) ensures a high degree of prosperity for all. It is a middle-class utopia, and one that has arisen not out of revolution, but natural evolution: Bellamy extrapolated his future from current trends with as much care as any later writer of sf. And his middle-class utopia had considerable appeal for Americans in the 1890s. The huge readership it thus won for itself has importance as far as we are concerned, an importance which is rarely stressed in histories of sf. More than any other book, above all in the United States, it accustomed people to think about the future as something that could be rationally extrapolated, that could even be planned for, and, perhaps above all, that could serve as a setting for entertaining and instructive fiction. The second main type of the tale of the future in the nineteenth century was even more popular than the utopian novel: the future war story. This sub-genre was essentially created by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir George Tomkyns Chesney, when he published (anonymously, in Blackwood’s Magazine for May 1871), The Battle o f Dorking: Reminiscences o f a Volunteer. An old man tells his grandchildren about the collapse of the British Empire fifty years earlier (presumably around 1871). The British Army had been poorly prepared, and thinly stretched; a German invasion caught Britain unawares, and took over the entire country. Britain became a pauper nation; Ire­ land, India, and Australia achieved independence. The book came in the aftermath of the collapse of France in the FrancoPrussian War, which raised the spectre of the Paris Commune and the realization of the vulnerability of Britain. Its publication\n\n22\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\ncaused a furore, and it was rapidly translated into French, Italian, Dutch, Spanish—and German. Imitations followed equally rapidly; The Victory o f Tunbridge Wells, After the Battle of Dorking, and The Commune o f London all appeared before the year was out. There were not only direct imitations; there were also scores of other warnings of future war disguised as fiction which appeared between 1871 and 1914.9 Wells himself con­ tributed The War in the Air (1908). The future war story took different forms, according to his­ torical circumstance and the anxieties of the moment. As is so often the case in the history of sf, works of fiction purporting to be set in the future are actually ways of clarifying the mind about contemporary issues. Thus, in the 1880s a spate of British stories warned about the poor state of the British Navy; in France stories expressed not only fear of the Germans, but, in such stories as La Prise de Londres au XXe siecle (1891) and Mort aux Anglais (1892), an ill-disguised delight in the thought that Chesney might be right about Germany’s plans for Eng­ land. The view from America was rather more global (and, argu­ ably, more racial); there, stories of future invasion concerned the Chinese and Japanese, ‘the Yellow Peril’. In Ireland, on the other hand, the genre of future war concerned itself with the possibilities of Home Rule (the first Bill was introduced by Gladstone in 1886), and, from the Protestant point of view, the consequent breakup of the Empire and the victory of Papism in Ireland. Most of them were written by Protestants, and, natu­ rally, relate how good honest Orangemen invade southern Ireland, defeat the Catholic rabble, and restore law and order and British values to the misguided Irish.10 In 1895 this sub-genre was represented by a number of ex­ amples. The Australian writer Kenneth Mackay published in London The Yellow Wave: A Romance o f the Asiatic Invasion o f Australia, a yellow peril story of the type which was, in the twentieth century, to be more characteristic of the United States. Fred Jane (of Jane’s Fighting Ships) published Blake o f the ‘Rattlesnake\\ Or the Man Who Saved England (UK), which stressed the significance of naval torpedos, and told of the dan­ gers of the French and the Russians and of striking workers in\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n23\n\nEngland; James Eastwick published The New Centurion (UK), in which an advanced battleship sinks a large proportion of the French Navy; and George Griffith published The Outlaws o f the Air (UK), in which air warfare, between anarchists and Utopians, plays a major role, and in which the huge air fleet of the Utopians establishes world peace (in scenes which startlingly prefigure those filmed by Alexander Korda for Wells’s Things to Come, 1936). The decade before the Great War saw another spate of warnings of war, of which the most delightful is undoubtedly P. G. Wodehouse’s The Swoop! or How Clarence Saved England (1909), in which a Boy Scout saved the day against the Ger­ mans, Russians, Swiss, and Chinese and the combined troops of the Mad Mullah and the Prince of Monaco. It stands out in an otherwise largely humourless sub-genre, and one singularly lacking in literary merit. Future war stories tended to be writ­ ten by Army officers or journalists, who produced fictionalized polemics rather than novels. They are no doubt marginal as sf (and some would not include them in the category at all); but again, they are important in the growth of acceptance of the future as a setting for fiction. And with them we see the birth of the tale of the future as warning, a form of fiction that may be as much propaganda as entertainment. It has had many descendants in the twentieth century, in novels which are not just warnings about wars—above all nuclear war—but warnings about other modern plagues: pollution, over-population, and so on. The function of the sf novel as warning has had a long career which shows no signs of ending. It may be noted here that it was a common theme in the British scientific romances of the period after the First World War, the two greatest exam­ ples being Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932) and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), perhaps the only novels of warning which had such influence that, it could be argued, their message had the required effect. 3. The Tale o f Science The third category of sf represented in 1895, like the other two, has had a vast twentieth-century progeny: the tale of science,\n\n24\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nof the marvellous invention, of scientists at work. William Livingston Alden gave us T he Purple Death’ (UK), with its mad scientist and his plague virus; Robert Cromie’s The Crack o f Doom (UK) has a mad scientist who is prevented from de­ tonating the world; while in Robert Barr’s ‘The New Explosive’ (UK), a French minister blows up an inventor rather than allow armies to get hold of his new explosive. Mullett Ellis’s Zalma (UK) has an aristocratic woman anarchist who plans to sow anthrax bacilli from balloons over the capitals of Europe. Roy Rockwood’s The Wizard o f the Sea imitates Verne, introducing Captain Vindax and his submarine; Verne himself published ‘An Express of the Future’, a dream of an undersea railway to America, in The Strand. Robert W. Chambers’s ‘The Mask’ (US) is about a liquid that petrifies bodies; Alice Fuller’s ‘A Wife Manufactured to Order’ is a short story in which a husband tries living with a ‘robot’ wife (forerunner of numerous twen­ tieth-century tales); while Charles Hinton’s Stella, about an invisible woman, treats the same theme as does Wells in The Invisible Man, published two years later. No fewer than three of the 1895 publications—George Griffith’s The Romance o f Golden Star (UK), Grant Allen’s ‘The Dead Man Speaks’ (UK), and Frank Moore’s The Secret o f the Court (UK)—deal with scientific attempts to revive the dead, a variant of Frankenstein. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is indeed right at the start of this sub-genre, and colours its subsequent development. There was never a time in the history of sf when the scientist appeared unambiguously as the hero and the herald of progress. The scientist has always had the capacity to wreak evil, often con­ sciously, sometimes by accident, as well as to bring good. Frankenstein stands in a line which includes R. L. Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Wells’s Dr Moreau. Indeed, Dr Moreau is Wells’s comment on Frankenstein. Frankenstein succeeded in his ex­ periment to create life and a soul, even if he suffered isolation and despair as a consequence; Moreau failed, and in his failure shows the inhumanity of his desire, which resulted only in pain and madness. If Moreau is in a line begun by Frankenstein, then he in turn is at the head of a long line of fictional mad scientists, who always forget what every B-movie fan knows by\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n25\n\nheart, that there are things with which man is not meant to meddle. It can be seen from the plot descriptions in the previous paragraph that all our 1895 stories present science as something to be wary of and something that can be, and will be, abused; mad scientists were already commonplace in 1895. Most sf, in the nineteenth century and subsequently, con­ centrated its attention much less upon the scientist himself than upon his creations, his discoveries and inventions. Verne is a much better instance of this than Wells. Wells always had his eye upon the human impact of his fiction, but in some of Verne’s stories it is the machine that is the hero: the submarine Nautilus in Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea; the steam house pulled by its steam-driven elephant in The Steam House; the fly­ ing machine Albatross in The Clipper o f the Clouds; the huge paddle-wheel finer in The Floating City; even the spaceship in From the Earth to the Moon. Extraordinary voyages were carried out in extraordinary vehicles; one of the most extraordinary is to be found in Edward Everett Hale’s novella ‘The Brick Moon’ (US, 1869), about the world’s first artificial satellite (and if brick seems an odd material, one may note that the American space shuttle has an exterior covering of ceramic tiles). People at the end of the nineteenth century, seeing their world changed out of all recognition from earlier times by the steamengine, by the mechanized factory, by gas and increasingly by electricity, were fascinated by machines and gadgets, and fully conscious that the lives of their children, even more than their own, were going to be transformed by them. A set of fifty cigarette cards produced by Armand Gervais of Lyons in 189911 shows the range of expected wonders: personal flying appara­ tus, helicopters, children being taught via electric head-sets and news coming through a superphonograph, mechanized house cleaning and farming, and so on. The most extensive fictional manifestation of this fascination was the Frank Reade, jun., stories, most of them written by Luis Philip Senarens under the pseudonym ‘Noname’.12 He was born in 1863, and by 1877 had already written the first of around 1500 dime novels (forty million words, claims Moskowitz) which he produced in just over thirty years, using at least twenty-seven pseudonyms, according to the\n\n26\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nhazy memories of Senarens himself. In 1879 the publisher Frank Tousey called him in to put some life into Harry Enton’s series of dime novels about a mechanical man, the Steam Man of the Plains (itself a shameless plagiarization of Edward F. Ellis’s The Steam Man o f the Prairies, 1868). Sixteen-year-old Lu Senarens retired Enton’s hero Frank Reade, and replaced him by his son, Frank Reade, jun., who for some years had adven­ tures over the whole world with his steam carriage, electric boat, helicopter, submarine, and other miraculous contrivances. So successful was ‘the American Jules Verne’ that in 1892 Tousey founded a weekly, called the Frank Reade Library, to be de­ voted entirely to ‘invention stories’.13 Senarens wrote the better part of the 179 stories issued between 1892 and 1898: stories of electric and steam robots, submarines, armoured cars and tanks, and ‘more about the possibility of air flight, projecting regular winged planes and dirigibles as well as helicopters, than all the rest of American writers up to his time combined’.14 In many ways Senarens’s work typified the dime novel at its worst, with weak or no plotting, repetitiousness, bad writing, deliberate low­ ering of level, sloppy research into background, jingoism, sadism, and outrageous racial prejudice focused on blacks, Mexicans, and Jews.15\n\nIndeed, it was ‘invention stories’, above all by Senarens him­ self, that helped give dime novels a bad name, and which in the 1890s drew down the wrath of the moralists and reformers upon the whole category. Dime novels came to an end; but ‘invention stories’ contin­ ued to be a major element in early sf, particularly in the United States. Hugo Gernsback’s Ralph 124C 41+ (magazine publi­ cation 1911-12, book 1925) is the classic example of the sf novel written to extol the role of the gadget in creating a future uto­ pia; its inventor/hero Ralph (One-to-Foresee-for-One) is just one of many similar figures from the sf of the first decades of the century. Just as Robinson Crusoe gave his name to the Robinsonade (the story of a lone individual trying to survive on a desert island or alien planet), so John Clute has recently taken the American inventor Thomas Edison’s name to dub the pro­ lific sub-genre featuring the inventor hero the ‘Edisonade’: ‘Any\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n27\n\nstory which features a young US male inventor hero who uses his ingenuity to extricate himself from tight spots and who, by so doing, saves himself from defeat and corruption and his friends and nation from foreign oppressors.’16Robinsonades are frequently conservative in their effect, since the hero is trying to reproduce his home environment in a supposedly alien land; Edisonades are frequently progressive and radical, since these inventions inevitably change the home environment.17 The interest in ‘invention stories’ is part of what Neil Harris has called the ‘operational aesthetic’; he has suggested that it is a particular manifestation of American culture in the nineteenth century. Ordinary Americans were disturbed by beauty, sig­ nificance, spiritual values, but were fascinated by the absorp­ tion of knowledge; museums were much more popular than art galleries. ‘This was an aesthetic of the operational, a delight in observing process and examining for literal truth.’18 It is a significant element in the growth of sf. Readers then (as, fre­ quently, younger readers today) had insatiable appetites for learning about the universe, and the lengthy disquisitions about science which were to be found in early sf stories were not then seen, by most of their readers, as literary flaws, but as an essential part of their reading pleasure.\n\nHerbert George Wells Four publications of 1895 were not mentioned above: those written by H. G. Wells. ‘The Remarkable Case of Davidson’s Eyes’ is a short story about a man who discovers that he can see in the fourth dimension; ‘The Argonauts of the Air’ tells of the fatal crash of a new flying machine; The Stolen Bacillus is a collection of sf stories, mostly published first in 1894; and The Time Machine is one of that tiny number of nineteenth-century sf stories (most of them also by Wells) which can still be read with unalloyed pleasure today. Wells was 29, still at the begin­ ning of his career, and moving into what, for sf readers, was to be the most productive decade of his life. The influence of H. G. Wells himself upon the development of sf was enormous. In his early short stories and novels as well\n\n28\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nas in numerous short essays on the future, Wells not only reached and impressed a very large number of people—preparing an audience for sf—but also set the agenda in subject-matter and tone for much of the sf to come. In Wells’s oeuvre are to be found stories of time-travel (The Time Machine), the creation of new forms of life (The Island o f Dr Moreau, 1896), alien invasion ( The War o f the Worlds, 1898), space travel (The First Men in the Moon, 1901), utopia (A Modern Utopia, 1905, and Men Like Gods, 1923), dystopia (When the Sleeper Wakes, 1899), future warfare (‘The Land Ironclads’, 1903, and The War in the A ir, 1908), and cosmic events (‘The Star’, 1897, and In the Days o f the Comet, 1906), and numerous tales of future scientific inven­ tions, plausible and implausible, with unforeseen human conse­ quences: invisibility (The Invisible Man, 1897), a drug to speed up human motion (‘The New Accelerator’, 1901), new food to boost animal growth (The Food o f the Gods, 1904), and so on. In terms of subject-matter, the subsequent history of sf almost seems like a series of footnotes to Wells. The strength of his influence certainly has something to do with the complexities and uncertainties of his own mind. He was a great believer in the power of science to improve the lot of humanity, but was well aware of science’s potential for bringing destruction or despotism. He was the greatest utopian writer of the twentieth century, yet wrote enduring dystopias as well. His Fabian socialism persuaded him to think in utopian terms about the future, but his innate pessimism inclined him to think the worst. Above all, perhaps, he was a believer in the power of science to change the world, but—crucially for his development as a writer of ‘scientific romances’—saw science not as the creator of certainties and unveiler of mysteries, but as the great purveyor of mystery and wonder, just as religion had been in its time. He expresses this at the end of one of his early essays. ‘The Rediscovery of the Unique’ (1891), in an image which reflects the scene where the Time Traveller uses his matches to see in the world of the Morlocks: Science is a match that man has just got alight. He thought he was in a room—in moments of devotion, a temple—and that his light would\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n29\n\nbe reflected from and display walls inscribed with wonderful secrets and pillars carved with philosophical systems wrought into harmony. It is a curious sensation, now that the preliminary splutter is over and the flame burns up clear, to see his hands lit and just a glimpse of himself and the patch he stands on visible, and around him, in place of all that human comfort and beauty he anticipated—darkness still.19\n\nSome writers have seen Wells’s writing career in terms of his growing pessimism about man’s future, summed up in the title of his last work (Mind at the End o f its Tether, 1945) or in the epitaph he suggested for himself in a conversation with Sir Ernest Barker in 1939: ‘God damn you all—I told you so.’20 But that passage from ‘The Rediscovery of the Unique’ suggests that a bleak vision of the universe was with him from the beginning of his career, and his earliest and greatest scientific romance, The Time Machine, confirms the suspicion. The Time Traveller himself ‘thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Man­ kind, and saw in the growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end’. The narrator of the tale sees some hope for the future in the two withered flowers which had been given to the Traveller by the Eloi girl from a d 802,701, ‘to witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man’.21 But the future revealed by the Traveller encompassed not only the evolution of humanity into two degenerate races, the Eloi and the Morlocks (the final result, perhaps, of the capitalist division of labour), but, ultimately, the dying of the Sun and the disappear­ ance of all life on Earth: I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the Earth’s fate, watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the west­ ward sky, and the life of the old Earth ebb away. At last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens.. . . I saw noth­ ing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. . . The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east, and the showering\n\n30\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nwhite flakes in the air increased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over. 22\n\nThis description of the end of the world is contained in some of the greatest pages in all sf, which have hardly been surpassed in their visionary majesty. Wells’s understanding of the poetry and mystery of science, his realization of the puny nature of humans in the face of a cold and indifferent universe and of humanity at the whim of cold and indifferent processes such as evolution, his fascination with the future: all these things, manifested in The Time Ma­ chine as clearly as in anything else he wrote, have seemed to many to make Wells the obvious Father of Science Fiction. This is so even if he himself, in mature life, derided his scientific romances as slight juvenilia. Wells had an immense influence on the development of sf in the present century, not only in England (where the tradition of scientific romance was domi­ nated by the memory of Wells well into the 1950s, and where sf was not infrequently called ‘that Wells stuff’), but in the United States too, where, for instance, the first specialist sf magazine, Amazing, published twenty-six of his novels and stories in its first five years, between 1926 and 1930. But, as we have seen, he was by no means the only writer of sf in the 1890s, when most of his greatest sf was written; he stood out from the rest more for his intelligence and his literary ability than for his originality. *\n\nSF in Britain and America: Publishing History The 1890s was in fact a decade in which many writers began to express their thoughts about the future in fictional terms. The figures drawn from Bleiler’s study Science Fiction: The Early Years speak for themselves: between 1848 and 1859 there were 23 works of sf in English; in the 1860s there were also 23; in the 1870s, 91; in the 1880s, 215; and in the 1890s, 551.\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n31\n\nWhat are the reasons for this? No doubt the increased speed of technological change, together with the fin de siecle feeling that one age was over and another about to begin, led people to speculate more about the future. There was much anticipation of the coming twentieth century not only in fiction, but also in non-fictional essays and popular journalism. Familiarity with the idea of a fictional future, thanks to Verne, Bellamy, and others, clearly encouraged people to express their hopes and fears in those terms: the phrase ‘literature of ideas’ was current in the 1890s, and much of British sf in the 1890s was part of that. When the Fabian socialist Beatrice Webb was working on her history of trade unionism in 1895, for instance, it seemed to her perfectly natural to think of writing a novel called Sixty Years Hence. This would not be a utopia, she hastened to tell her diary (that is, not another News from Nowhere), but a tale of life in the future ‘if we go on “evoluting” in our humdrum way’: a collectivist future, and one in which ‘the fully-fledged woman engaged in a great career should be pictured just as we should now picture a man’.23 She never wrote it, but others did. General trends in fiction may also have helped prepare the ground for the scientific romance, in Britain at least. Elaine Showalter has recently argued that in the Britain of the 1880s there was a conscious move away from the realistic novel, as epitomized by women writers like George Eliot, concerned with domestic matters, love, marriage, and relationships between people, towards new forms of romance. Romance dealt with adventure, with Empire, with the deeds of men among men. Rider Haggard dedicated King Solomon’s Mines (1885) ‘to all the big and little boys who read’. Women were largely excluded from this world, as protagonists, as writers, and as potential readers. ‘If the critic is a woman’, Walter Besant wrote to Haggard after the publication of She (1886), ‘she will put down this book with the remark that it is impossible—almost all women have this feeling towards the marvellous.’24 R. L. Stevenson, G. A. Henty, Haggard, and Kipling all wrote stories in which male friendships are much more important than fe­ male relationships and in which the imperial quest is also a flight from domesticity and marriage. The almost exclusively\n\n32\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nmale writers of British ‘scientific romance’ in the period up to the First World War fit neatly into this trend. The differences between sf in the United States and Britain— marked in the nineteenth century and even more so in the early twentieth, and continuing until the victory of American sf in the 1950s—are important for the history of sf, and are a matter for discussion throughout this book. These differences concern not just the different political and cultural histories of the two countries, but also the different history of book publishing and the different ways in which both publishers and authors treated sf. In Britain, as is well known, the three-volume novel, the ‘three-decker’, dominated the respectable novel-writing scene in the nineteenth century, and there was an enormous unfilled gap in both price and quality between these and the penny dreadful market. Because three-deckers were so expensive, circulating libraries were established, which in turn dominated the field, fixing prices and causing writers to self-censor them­ selves in order to achieve publication. Sf was outside this sys­ tem. In Suvin’s list of 360 items of Victorian sf, only 11 are three-deckers.25 Even if the circulating libraries had been inter­ ested in such material on a large scale, the three-decker form simply did not lend itself to sf; the kind of detailed description and analysis required to fill hundreds of pages was very difficult to apply to scientific romance. At the other end of the scale, the penny dreadful (the English equivalent of the Senarens dime novel) did not adopt sf themes either; for different reasons, it too preferred the familiar. Sf as it existed in Victorian Britain therefore mostly survived outside the generally accepted forms: as novelettes published in magazines like Blackwood’s, as pamphlets, or as single-volume publications intended for boys (like the translations of Verne). But the situation changed radically in the 1890s, not only because the circulating libraries turned against the three-decker in favour of single-volume novels, but also because of the great expansion of middle-brow periodicals. The Strand, home of Sherlock Holmes from 1891 and of various sf short stories (including some by Doyle himself), is well known; but there were many\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n33\n\nothers. These weeklies and monthlies published much of the sf of the 1890s and 1900s. Pearson’s Weekly serialized George Griffith’s The Angel o f the Revolution from January 1893, the most imaginative yet in the ‘future war’ mould. (Griffith es­ tablished himself as the best-known writer of sf in Britain in the early 1890s, and Wells, wanting to be taken seriously, always fumed at the obvious comparisons made between him and the popular Griffith.) Wells himself had his short stories published by the Pall Mall Gazette and others, while his novels were serialized in the magazines before book publication: Pearson’s Weekly took his The Invisible Man, for instance, and Pearson’s Magazine published The War o f the Worlds. The proliferation of markets for imaginative romances was not just a British phenomenon. Magazines like the Strand and Pearson’s Magazine both had American editions, which helped introduce some of these British sf writers to a much larger readership, while American magazines of a similar type were created. There were all-fiction magazines too, like the Argosy (monthly from 1896) and All-Story Magazine (1905); there was also a smaller-circulation fiction magazine, published in Boston between 1895 and 1919, called the Black Cat, which specialized in fantasy fiction. These magazines allowed a large number of writers to establish themselves and to reach a very large number of readers; at its peak in 1907 the Argosy was offering some 135,000 words of fiction on coarse pulp paper, at a cost of 10 cents, to around 500,000 readers each month. In the United States the increasing number of popular magazines had not had the profound effect upon the kind of fiction produced that it had had in Britain. The three-decker had never been important, and the huge gap between ‘literature’ and the penny dreadful which existed in Britain until the 1890s had in the United States been filled by a wide variety of ‘popu­ lar’ literature. In the United States romance had never been so marginalized by the realistic novel as it had been, earlier in the century, in Britain. Throughout the century, most of the re­ spected (male) writers of fiction in the United States had dab­ bled in what we could call sf; Edgar Allan Poe is the most obvious example, but there are also Charles Brockden Brown,\n\n34\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nWashington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, James Fenimore Cooper, Fitz James O ’Brien, Oliver Wendell Holmes, as well as, somewhat later, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Henry James, and Ambrose Bierce. The American public was introduced to Wells and other English writers through these new periodicals, which also al­ lowed the republication of older material and the appearance of some newer American writers, such as George Allan England and Garrett P. Serviss. On the whole in this period, British writers had more of an impact on the American market than Americans on the British, but there was considerable cross­ fertilization, even if there were differences in taste. Our sam­ pling of the publications of 1895 suggested that the theme of utopia was more popular in the United States, the future war story in Britain, and that fiction aimed at a semi-literate read­ ership was more common in the former (in the form of dime novels). But the two markets also had a lot in common, and by the early part of the twentieth century it looked very much as if British and American markets and readerships had converged, and were destined to follow a similar evolution. By 1910, however, much had changed. In Britain, many of the periodicals disappeared with the rise of the popular daily press, and those that were left, like the Strand and the Pall Mall Gazette, were yearning for respectability, and became reluctant to publish anything like the quantity of speculative fiction which they had done before. The fad for scientific romance declined. Interplanetary tales virtually disappeared from the scene until Olaf Stapledon in the 1930s; when such stories were written, they tended to be published as ‘boys’ books’. Before the First World War, and particularly just after it, when scientific romance was written in Britain, it was published not in magazines, but in book form. It rarely appeared in a cheap hardback series, like Collins Shilling Fiction Library or Newnes’s Sevenpenny Series, just as, immediately before and after the Second World War, it very rarely appeared in paperback format, since scientific romance was regarded as unlikely to achieve mass-market interest. More­ over, British scientific romance tended to be published in fulllength novel form, not in the short story form which dominated *\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n35\n\nAmerican sf until the 1950s. Brian Stableford (whose excellent and indispensable Scientific Romance in Britain, 1890-1950 is the otherwise unacknowledged source for much of this section) sees a highpoint in the production of scientific romance in Britain in 1898, with a steady decline thereafter to the trough of 1918, and only a slow recovery to a new phase of popularity and a new generation of writers at the beginning of the 1930s. Publishing in the United States took a totally different direc­ tion. Books had been cheap even before the 1890s, and wide­ spread pirating of foreign books helped to keep prices down. The boom in periodicals, which the United States shared with Britain, continued long after the decline in Britain, and pub­ lishers deliberately aimed their publications at a wider public than in Britain. There had been considerable indignation at the low literary level of such dime novels as the Frank Reade Lib­ rary', but the result was the replacement of the dime novel by almost equally low-grade fiction magazines aimed at almost the same public—‘the pulps’. The average pulp was a magazine measuring 10 by 7 inches, printed on thick coarse paper; it was the development of the technique of producing cheap paper from wood-pulp, in the 1880s, that created the possibility of mass production of cheap magazines as well as the name by which they became known. The pulps often had ragged untrimmed pages and, later in their history, covers printed with cheap lurid coal-tar dyes. Now, yellowing and fragile, they are expensive collectors’ items; but when published, they were the kind of thing that respectable readers shunned, or kept hidden. The publishers of the more up-market middle-class magazines (printed on better quality, shinier paper, and hence known as ‘the slicks’) came to see the fast-paced adventure stories to be found in the pulps (which included sf) as tainted by their lowgrade associations, and they stopped printing them. While sf in Britain, when it was published, came out regularly in hardback, in America it was largely restricted to the pulps. Publishers of dime novels had realized that there were read­ ers who liked only one kind of fiction—westerns, perhaps, or detective novels—and eventually the pulps began to specialize as well. Thrill Book (which began and ended in 1919) was the\n\n36\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nfirst pulp to specialize in fantastic fiction; Amazing Stories (1926 to the present, in different guises) was the first ‘scientifiction’ pulp. In the 1920s specialization reached spectacular heights: ‘there were magazines specialising in railroad stories, sea stories, yellow peril stories, the exploits of crime-fighting superheroes, and even a short-lived pulp called Zeppelin Adventures.'26 Tradition has it that the most famous of all the pulps, originally called Astounding Stories o f Super-Science, came into existence almost by accident as the result of the pulp publishers’ spe­ cialization. William Clayton published some thirteen adventure magazines of different types. But his garishly coloured covers were printed on a large sheet of glossy paper with sixteen spaces on it. Looking around for three new titles so that he could do the colour printing most economically, he was advised by one of his editors, Harry Bates, to produce an imitation of Hugo Gernsback’s Amazing Stories: thus was Astounding born.27 Astounding has had an unbroken run into the 1990s, although in 1960 it changed its name to Analog in a final effort to disown its pulp past. The success of Amazing inspired not only A s­ tounding, but numerous other sf pulps. Although general fiction pulps like Argosy and All-Story continued to publish sf (the two merged in the 1920s), most American sf in the 1930s was published in the specialist pulps, and little ever reached book form. It is clear that the different publishing histories of sf in Brit­ ain and the United States has had a profound effect on the subsequent development of the genre in those two countries. The differences between American and British sf (and indeed between American and other European sf traditions), which had always existed, became much more marked, thanks to the pulps. As we shall see below, scientific romance in Britain in­ herited from Wells a seriousness that concerned itself with the future of humanity and with philosophical, as well as scientific, questions; the various visionary works by the philosopher Olaf Stapledon may stand as the epitome of this tradition. In the United States, sf before the Second World War was often fastmoving adventure and colourful romance, with rather more suspense and thrills than philosophy; Edgar Rice Burroughs is\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\n37\n\nthe typical example. Sf in the United States suffered profoundly from its restriction to the pulps; it reached a wide public, but denied itself any sort of respectability. It is true that in Britain scientific romance remained a minority interest, but it was one which, thanks largely to Wells, was accepted in some way as legitimate. Well-known writers and novelists in the United States could never have dabbled in the field in the 1920s and 1930s— or would never have thought of doing so—in the way that Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, C. S. Lewis, and J. B. Priestley did in Britain.\n\nSF between the Wars outside North America The history of American sf between the wars has often been written as if it were the history of a movement: a collective urge to produce sf which was given expression in magazines like Amazing and which culminated, at the beginning of the Second World War, in the inevitable emergence of modern sf, with the great names like Asimov and Heinlein. By the 1940s, as we shall see in Chapter 4, American sf fans had acquired a strong collective feeling; they helped give American sf writers the sense of being the spokespersons for an entire community and begin to construct the past history of the movement. Many of them viewed sf as a way of life and a way of thought as much as a type of popular literature, and they were often fervent mission­ aries for the cause. Sf writers were often drawn from this group of readers, and even if their background was different, they wrote for those readers in the manner which those readers preferred. A genre emerged. If this collective vision of the development of sf is a possible way of viewing developments in the United States, it certainly does not hold true anywhere else. Some authors in Europe no doubt had the feeling that they belonged to a tradition; but for many of them that tradition was dominated by the two great figures upon whose shoulders they perched, like pygmies: Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. Otherwise, authors wrote in isolation from one another, and usually wrote what we may call ‘sf as only part of their output; the type of market provided by the\n\n38\n\nThe Development o f a Genre\n\nAmerican pulps, by the 1930s at least, simply did not exist in Europe, except perhaps in the former Soviet Union, where, according to Patrick L. McGuire, there were full-time writers of sf by the 1920s.28 The influence of Wells and Verne was dominant in Britain and France, respectively, right up to the Second World War, even though Verne had died in 1905, and by 1905 Wells had published nearly all his great scientific romances (although he continued writing "
