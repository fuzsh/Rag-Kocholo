        "text": "DINOSAURS\n\nWalter Jon Williams\n\nCopyright (c) 1987, 2014 by Walter Jon Williams\n\nAll rights reserved\n\nCover art by Innovari\n\nSmashwords edition published by Walter Jon Williams\n\nDINOSAURS\n\nThe Shars seethed in the dim light of their ruddy sun. Pointed faces raised to the sky, they sniffed the faint wind for sign of the stranger and scented only hydrocarbons, far-off vegetations, damp fur, the sweat of excitement and fear. Weak eyes peered upward, glistened with hope, anxiety, apprehension, and saw only the faint pattern of stars. Short, excited barking sounds broke out here and there, but mostly the Shars crooned, a low ululation that told of sudden onslaught, destruction, war in distant reaches, and now the hope of peace.\n\nThe crowds surged left, then right. Individuals bounced high on their third legs, seeking a view, seeing only the wide sea of heads, the ears and muzzles pointed to the stars.\n\nSuddenly, a screaming. High-pitched howls, a bright chorus of barks. The crowds surged again.\n\nSomething was crossing the field of stars.\n\nThe human ship was huge, vaster than anything they’d seen, a moonlet descending. Shars closed their eyes and shuddered in terror. The screaming turned to moans. Individuals leaped high, baring their teeth, barking in defiance of their fear. The air smelled of terror, incipient panic, anger.\n\nWar! cried some. Peace! cried others.\n\nThe crooning went on. We mourn, we mourn, it said, we mourn our dead billions.\n\nWe fear, said others.\n\nSoundlessly, the human ship neared them, casting its vast shadow. Shars spilled outward from the spot beneath, bounding high on their third legs.\n\nThe human ship came to a silent rest. Dully, it reflected the dim red sun.\n\nThe Shars crooned their fear, their sorrow. And waited for the humans to emerge.\n\n*\n\nThese! Yes. These. Drill, the human ambassador, gazed through his video walls at the sea of Shars, the moaning, leaping thousands that surrounded him. Through the mass a group was moving with purpose, heading for the airlock as per his instructions. His new Memory crawled restlessly in the armored hollow atop his skull. Stand by, he broadcast.\n\nHis knees made painful crackling noises as he walked toward the airlock, the silver ball of his translator rolling along the ceiling ahead of him. The walls mutated as he passed, showing him violet sky, far-off polygonal buildings; cold distant green... and here, nearby, a vast, dim plain covered with a golden tissue of Shars.\n\nHe reached the airlock and it began to open. Drill snuffed wetly at the alien smells— heat,"
