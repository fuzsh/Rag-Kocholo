        "text": "I started to read Dread Empire's Fall - The Praxis... so far, and i'm almost to the middle of the book, it's all ballroom politics, high nobility intrigues, marriage arrangements and boring attempts at romance.\n\nEven the single action scene was stretched on long pages of boring space dynamics maneuveing descriptions...\n\nDoes it get better? it's boring the hell out of me.\n\nI know that later there is a war and stuff, but is there a twist to the story? or is it just a straight up war against some alien race?\n\nI liked Dread Empire but it could have been better - WJW recognized that for commercial reasons he did not let go all gonzo as in Aristoi or Implied Spaces which are excellent and that is the WJW you should read or the 2 book sequence Metropolitan and City on Fire which are superb too.\n\nThere is more action coming in the civil war, but there is a lot of boring stuff too and the universe is not that well developed - the aliens are so ridiculous that only WJW's style which I like a lot kept me reading.\n\nThe girl is cool though and the book is worth reading for her while you hope the main guy will get killed since he is a moron by and large, though true he is less moronic than most of the rest of the characters - though if you read the novella 3.5 you know how it ends...\n\nMaybe if Mr. Williams gets his past due commercial break in sff and can write more in this series, it will live to its potential - for now the series is postponed though it was intended as a multi-volume one which the ending of the trilogy clearly shows, it did not sell enough to go ahead-\n\nRegarding the original questions - I always found Mike Resnick's sf light and not worth bothering with, though I tried this and that. He has been on my avoid author list for many years, though I still try something that could tempt me like the new Starship series only to be reminded why I do not like his books. He is readable but there is so much better sff out there that I did not find reading his books worth the time. Since he is publishing so much there are people who buy his books, but I am not one of them.\n\nRegarding Nancy Kress - Probability was unreadable for me, but I liked a lot Beggars in Spain though the sequels became repetitive and boring so I gave up on the series. I also like some of her short fiction.\n\nFor me WJW is one of the top current sff authors and each of his novels are a must read. Though as mentioned above Dread Empire is mostly a second tier WJW work, it has great potential so if he will be able to continue it it may become a top tier work.\n\nThere are quite a number of novels set in the Santiago universe - I like them. It is kind of like a Western in space [Stephen R. Donaldson's \"Gap series\" should appeal to fans of the Santiago books].\n\nI have only read some of Nancy Kress's older stuff like 'An Alien Light' which was quite interesting.\n\nI haven't read 'The Praxis' yet, though I have read the sequel to it [this is because I got a copy cheap]- Resurgence, which I found okay but also one of those books that I don't remember much of after reading.\n\nNancy Kress has a new novel - Steal Across the Sky coming up soon and it's a return to the Beggars in Spain form with another big sf what-if idea. This time the \"what-if\" idea is part of the discovery process of the novel, so I won't say what is.\n\nIt starts with advanced aliens calling themselves Atoners building a base on the Moon and taking a Web ad asking for volunteers to go to some planets and *Witness* for them. They guarantee safe return and claim that the *Observers* will know what they have to see when they see it and they also claim that they have done humanity a great wrong 10k years ago, hence the name they use.\n\nWJW has a near-future sf with gaming overtones This is not a Game - WJW wrote dialog for the Spore game so he is into this - and it's a read on receive for me, but I did not get an arc yet.\n\nHowever if you are interested in that kind of book, there is an excellent near-future thriller/sf with gaming overtones Daemon by D. Suarez that's out there and is quite good, much better than the similar themed Stross' Halting State.\n\nI reviewed both Steal Across the Sky and Daemon for Robert at Fantasy Book Critic, though I think only the Daemon review has been up so far, and I also posted mini-reviews here in the Reading in January thread.\n\nSome possibilities . . . .\n\nThe few serious works by Williams I have essayed did not strike me as out of the top drawer, but his \"Drake Maijstral\" trio (The Crown Jewels; House of Shards; Rock of Ages) is good fun--not for the ages or brimming with originality, but pleasant and amusing, something I can see re-reading sometime soon.\n\nFor Kress, a little oddity one might want to look up is The Prince of Morning Bells. At times it edges toward use of The Great Hammer of Obviousness, but Kress mostly constrains it to more like a tackhammer, and the work is well more than readable--quirky and touching."
