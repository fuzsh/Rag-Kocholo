So, you believe the seller had probably just trow in that bookbinder booklet in the photo above from some other pair?\n\nYes, one of the specs is the uniform color, however I believe I've read somewhere that this type of a leather is hard on accepting any cream and waxes as it has some synthetic layer which prevents even the rain to enter the pores of the shoes. I wouldn't really want that ..\n\nJUAN MANUEL\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 12, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n1,470\n\nReaction score\n\n6,033\n\nAug 20, 2016\n\n#353\n\nI have just recieved a new pair of Consul in 173 last in walnut calf from Herrings (as always ecellent service). With this shoes my Oxfords stock is fullfilled, well, maybe a pair in dark brown will come in the future for navy suits. The 173 last is great for my feet and visually has the perfect balance of heft (without looking like a mailman shoe) or being too sleek. I own a pair of AS Armfield in 109 last in the same colour, but Church's 173 is the winner, eventhough I appreciate Sargent's craft and leather (love the Stepney and Ramsey).\n\nSo here you can see a pair of Consul in black in 103 last and chesnut in 73; black, brown suede and walnut in 173 last. All of them in F fit, all of them fron Herring's, the black one in 103 was my first pair of good shoes.\n\nNikola\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 29, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n2,074\n\nReaction score\n\n504\n\nAug 20, 2016\n\n#354\n\nWhoa, nice @JUAN MANUEL .. Always nice to see a guy sticking to what he likes most. I was lucky enough to acquire a pair of a 1984 completely unworn Black Calf 73 G fit lasted Consul, and the quality of those blows out of water the current line of Crockett Jones Oxford easily. I will post some photos when I get my new camera in a couple of weeks .. I was also considering the 173 lasted Consul in brown but was uncertain of their current quality. Seems like there is definitely no love for a post prada styles here ..\n\nZapasman\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 2, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n3,738\n\nReaction score\n\n2,946\n\nAug 21, 2016\n\n#355\n\nI have just recieved a new pair of Consul in 173 last in walnut calf from Herrings (as always ecellent service).

Always nice to see a guy sticking to what he likes most. I was lucky enough to acquire a pair of a 1984 completely unworn Black Calf 73 G fit lasted Consul, and the quality of those blows out of water the current line of Crockett Jones Oxford easily. I will post some photos when I get my new camera in a couple of weeks .. I was also considering the 173 lasted Consul in brown but was uncertain of their current quality. Seems like there is definitely no love for a post prada styles here ..\n\nI had them on my hands and they were very well made.\n\nAgain, Classic Churchs \"Custom Grade\" (Chestwynd/Grafton/Diplomat/Consul/etc) are brilliant shoes, yesterday and today. They are manufactured by Cheaney in England under the supervision of Mr. Church (the owner of that company that sold Church´s Shoes to Prada long ago).\n\nEnglishShoes\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 27, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n526\n\nReaction score\n\n331\n\nAug 21, 2016\n\n#357\n\nWait, the main Church models are made in the Cheaney factory?\n\nWhat is made in the Church's factory then?\n\nalexSF\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 10, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n3,363\n\nReaction score\n\n340\n\nAug 21, 2016\n\n#358\n\nWrong information...\n\nChurchs and Cheaney shoes are actually produced in different places and owned by different people.\n\nChurchs family used to own both brands and factories, then sold all to Prada (Bertelli) in the 90's\n\nLater they (Church family) reacquired the Cheaney company.\n\nThey are actually completely unrelated companies and they make shoes in two separate factories.\n\nFrom Cheaney website:\n\nIn August, 2009, cousins Jonathan and William Church conducted a management buy-out of Cheaney from Church & Co (by then a wholly owned subsidiary of Prada). They now own and operate the company and are committed to continuing the production of high quality shoes entirely made in Northamptonshire, from the cutting out of the leather to the final polishing, just as it was in 1886.\"\n\nWhere did you found this bizarre information?\n\nLast edited: Aug 21, 2016\n\nZapasman\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 2, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n3,738\n\nReaction score\n\n2,946\n\nAug 21, 2016\n\n#359\n\nI hope I will find the article for you. I just mentioned the custom grade line as I read so in an interview with the churchs family. Churchs makes shoes for other brands too and if I recall correctly, Prada group reached an agreement with the Church family to produce that line under their personal supervision in the Cheany factory. Give some time to find it, too late here sorry.."
