        "text": "When will you write a sequel to Hardwired?In point of fact, I already have, at novella length. It was called “Solip:System,” and was published both as a 900-copy limited edition by Axolotl Press in 1989 (with history’s ugliest cover art, I should add), and was reprinted byAsimov’s magazine in September 1990.\n\nThe story begins a few minutes before the conclusion of Hardwired and continues with a different protagonist, the downloaded computer personality Reno. The story is intended to show how the world of Hardwired evolved into that of Voice of the Whirlwind.\n\nI’m pleased to report that “Solip:System” is now back in print! It’s part of a new collection Frankensteins and Foreign Devils, out from NESFA Press. Check out the table of contents, or click on this link to NESFA Press to order a copy!"
