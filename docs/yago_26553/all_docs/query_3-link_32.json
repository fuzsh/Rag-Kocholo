        "text": "Experimental physicist Morgan Madhuku of Zimbabwe works on alloys obtained by combining either aluminum, gallium or indium with nitrogen.In 2013, he took advantage of an international scholarship for post doctoral fellowship with the National Centre for Physics (NCP) in Islamabad, Pakistan, as its first-ever recipient.\n\nPicture shows Morgan Madhuku, an experimental physicist from Zimbabwe being trained by Waheed Akram of the National Centre for Physics in Islamabad,Pakistan.\n\nMadhuku's fellowship gave him a chance to work at NCP, which has state-of-the-art equipment he needed to learn to use, including a tandem accelerator that fires ion beams.\n\nMadhuku said he was impressed by the sophistication of the Pakistani lab, especially considering that media reports of terror attacks initially made him nervous about the move. One African company even refused to give him life insurance while he was there. But in the end, his trip was both safe and extremely beneficial to his career. “I was very impressed by the state-of-art Tandem Accelerator facility and the dedicated team of scientists and technical staff who were always ready to assist me during the visit,” he said.\n\nNCP is a less known organization tucked away in Islamabad. It is one of the 12 organizations in Asia who provide remote computing facilities to CERN for partially procession 30,000 Terabytes of Data generated by CERN annual.\n\nNCP works closely with CERN in the field of research and instrumentation. The institution was involved in design testing and fabrication and installation of 432 Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) required for the CMS muon detector at CERN.\n\nThe Institution has expertise , equipment and Laboratories for following fields.\n\nTheoretical Physics\n\nHigh Energy Physics\n\nNano Science and Catalysis\n\nLaser Plasma Physics\n\nVacuum Science\n\nEarthquake Studies\n\ntraining to use sophisticated equiments required for his research.\n\nThat is internship.\n\nOn topic: Its a good step. With industry boom, will come a boom in research. Pakistan spends very less money on research and higher education. And on the top of that, an \"elected\" person sits on the top. And everything ends up in smokes.\n\nQabil log bhag jatay hain, or jinhain koi nahi lyta woh hamaray saron per sawar rehtay hain(but few exceptions are there, of course)"
