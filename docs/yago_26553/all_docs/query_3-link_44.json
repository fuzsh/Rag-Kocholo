Live-streamed evening events and lectures, roundtable discussions, and video screenings are scheduled throughout the week. TBH’s goals: explaining concepts of high-science and high-technology in simple Urdu and English; nurturing young people of exceptional talent in every field; and creating greater societal rationality.\n\nUnconnected with any political or religious organization, TBH is purposed towards helping all citizens of Pakistan to participate fully in the scientific, social, economic, and cultural life of their society."
