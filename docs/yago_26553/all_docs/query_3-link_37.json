        "text": "Today I'm finally moving back to my home. I spent a wonderful time at COMSATS University Islamabad. These four years have impacted my personality positively and I believe I have improved as a student and a human being. Living in an area full of students with different backgrounds and cultures helped me explore the and learn the cultural values of my country and I previously did not know. I made real life connections outside the classroom. Lived and enjoyed my time with friends who come from every city of Pakistan. Long talks and debates over the cup of tea with these friends is one of the things I will miss in coming days. I am grateful to the HEC Pakistan for their continuous support under the Science Talent Farming Scheme Scholarship. This contribution towards my education helped me become first person in my family tree to graduate with a bachelor's degree in science. List of the people I want to thank is very long. It would be unfair if I missed someone. But I acknowledge the support from my professors, friends and fellows who have supported me throughout my degree. I dedicate this achievement to my father Mr. Muhammad Arshad Javeed who always believed in me. He tops the list of my best friends with whom I can share my achievements, happiness, concerns, worries and what not. I only realised it when I moved to Islamabad that how much I love him and my family. He could not get education but dreamed of educating his children which he has successfully accomplished. I don't usually write about the things I have written above, but as I am writing this I feel I should have written this earlier. #university #students #education #pakistan #science #talent #hec #physics #graduation #graduated #father"
