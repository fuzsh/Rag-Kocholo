        "text": "The government announced that the National Centre for Physics at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad as the \"Professor Abdus Salam Center for Physics\". Sharif directed the education ministry to make a formal proposal for the move, which coincided with the 20th death anniversary of Salam.\n\nSharif also approved the grant of five annual fellowships in the name of Salam to Pakistani students pursuing a PhD in physics at reputed international universities. The decision was made in recognition of the great contributions of Salam, a major figure in 20th century theoretical physics. He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions in the field.\n\nSalam was also the second person from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize. However, Pakistan has usually shied away from owning Salam as he belonged to the Ahmadi minority, which was officially declared “non-Muslim” in 1974.\n\nLocal media reported Salam’s 20th death anniversary on Monday had passed without any significant mention of him. The only event in his memory was scheduled at his alma mater, the Government College University in Lahore, but that too was postponed.\n\nSalam died on November 21, 1996 in Oxford, Britain but not a single ceremony has ever been organised in Pakistan to commemorate his death or to praise his contributions in science because he belongs to the Ahmadi community, which has been attacked and persecuted since its members were declared non-Muslims.\n\nCommunity spokesperson Saleemudin told a newspaper that Salam, as an Ahmadi, faced this discrimination in his life and it had continued afterwards as well. “He was a hero for Pakistan. But I have never seen his portraits along with other national heroes put up on national days,” he said.\n\nDuring the recent selection of the new Pakistan Army chief, a whisper campaign had suggested Gen Qamar Bajwa - who was eventually chosen for the post - was an Ahmadi. However, the suggestion was dismissed by the official establishment."
