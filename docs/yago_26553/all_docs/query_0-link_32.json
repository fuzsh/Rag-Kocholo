Today I shall be talking about the Second Fossil and Second Nuclear Age; the thoughts I shall be presenting have been developed not only in our group at IIASA but also by other eminent scientists at MIT, Oak Ridge and Jülich. To begin with let us attempt to characterize the First Fossil and First Nuclear Age, as we have known it. Briefly, the First Fossil Age may be characterized by saying that oil was clean, abundantly available and essentially free (compared to other factors of production). The First Nuclear Age was based on the idea that nuclear power is only for large-scale production of electricity, cheaply (?) with light water reactors or other burners now, breeders in future and plutonium for ever."
