        "text": "Physics is a broad and highly developed subject today. Physics builds fundamental knowledge required for future developments in technology and it has a vital role in other fields like engineering, chemistry, medical science, environmental science and computer science. Department of physics aims to pursue excellence in physics through teaching and research. It is our goal to provide the best teaching as well as research facilities to our students. Faculty members of the department are committed for quality teaching and to improve critical thinking of students about science. The department diversifies its programs in order to deal with multifaceted requirements of the country. Physics department offers admission in BS Physics, BS (Weekend Admission to 5th Semester for B.Sc and ADP Degree Holders), MPhil Physics and PhD Physics levels. These programs offer students the opportunity to begin with BS physics and end their education till PhD level. In order to promote research culture various research groups have been formed in the department. Faculty members are actively engaged in advanced research across the different fields of physics like materials sciences, condensed matter physics, high energy physics, atomic and molecular physics, computational physics and plasma physics. In order to keep our students updated with present and ongoing advancements in physics, the department arranges seminars and workshops. These activities not only enhance knowledge of students about current developments in physics but it also offers opportunities to nourish their communication and presentation skills. On behalf of physics faculty, I welcome you to the Department of Physics, Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences Riphah International University Islamabad."
