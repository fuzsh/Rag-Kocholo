        "text": "Education\n\nBorn in Ludhiana, Fayyazuddin and Riazuddin received their intermediate education from there. Following the partition of India, the family migrated to Lahore, Pakistan. He along with his brother Riazuddin attended Punjab University. Fayyazuddin did his BA with honours in Mathematics from Punjab University, followed by his in MSc Mathematical physics under the supervision of Abdus Salam. His master's degree dissertation were written on the \"Methods of Mathematical Physics\", which was jointly written with Riazuddin. In 1953, he did his M.Phil. in Particle physics, writing his another master thesis on \"Energy Loss of Mesons in Crystals\", under the supervision of Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry from the same alma mater. After his MSc and M.Phil, Fayyaz moved to Karachi and joined the Karachi University where he became a lecturer of physics.\n\nAfter teaching Mathematics and Physics at the Karachi University, Fayyaz, on his brother's advice, travelled to United Kingdom in 1959. He attended Imperial College London where Abdus Salam and Riazuddin were also teaching. He was awarded his PhD. in theoretical Particle physics under the supervision of Prof. Abdus Salam (late) in 1962. Fayyazuddin's dissertation where written on \"Preliminary Analysis of Photoproduction of K Mesons in the Mandelstam Representation\". Following his PhD, Fayyaz came back to Pakistan and joined Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC).\n\nAcademic career\n\nFayyazuddin joined Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in 1962 where he worked under Abdus Salam. At the PAEC, he continued his research on the cosmic ray mu mesons. He then published his research journal on the basis of the Bethe-Bloch theory, in which the theory supports the idea of a logarithmic increase of ionization loss for relativistic particles. At the time he published his thesis, there was a controversy between two sets of experiments, Fayyazuddin founded interested to perform the experiment.\n\nFayyazuddin on a post-doctoral research went to United States where he joined his brother. Fayyaz was offered post doctoral research at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago where he also met a noted physicist Faheem Hussain. At the Institute, Fayyazuddin, along with Faheem Hussain, Riazuddin, Peter Rotteli formed \"The Relativity Group\" where the team of young scientists carried out the research to the fields of special relativity. In 1968, when the Institute of Physics was established at the then-University of Islamabad by the Abdus Salam's effort, the scientists returned the Pakistan reluctantly. Fayyazuddin, along with Faheem Hussain, Arif-uz-Zaman, and Sarwar Razmi, joined the Institute of Physics. Due to their contribution, the institute was an active centre of research in theoretical particle physics and its presence was felt at an international level.\n\nIn 1970, Fayyazuddin went to Great Britain where he joined the Rutherford Appleton Laboratories as a research associate scientist. In 1972, Fayyazudin returned to Pakistan where he joined the Institute of Physics of Quaid-e-Azam University. In 1972, Fayyazuddin, including with mathematician Munir Ahmad Rashid, attended the Multan meeting – a meeting in which Pakistan decided to developed the atomic weapon. He joined the Theoretical Physics Group under his brother's guidance, and, he took participation in Fast neutron calculations – a key calculation to developed the weapon – and contributed in the calculations in Neutron fluxes. In 1973, Fayyazuddin then travelled to Geneva, Switzerland where he became a visiting scientist European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). At CERN, he purposed the Calibrations and Fayyazuddin-Smith spacetimes, the theory describe intersecting M5-branes admits a generalised Kähler calibration. Equipped with this understanding, Fayyazuddin and Smith were able to construct spacetimes corresponding to further classes of calibrated p-brane world-volume solitons. The theory also noted that these classes of spacetimes also describe the fields of p-branes wrapping certain supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds. In 1977, he came back to Pakistan and joined Quaid-i-Azam University where he subsequently became a dean of Faculty of Natural Sciences whereas he also became a professor of physics. In 1980, he went to Saudi Arabia where he became a full professor of physics at the King Saud University at Riyadh; a full professor of physics at the Ummal Qura University at Mecca where he stayed till 1996. After teaching in Saudi Arabia for more than a decade, Fayyazuddin came back to Pakistan in 2005 where he joined Quaid-i-Azam University. In 2007, Fayyazuddin joined National Center for Physics as a senior scientist. In 2008, he was awarded HEC Distinguished Professor Award by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. In 2000, President of Pakistan General Pervez Musharraf conferred on him Pakistan's Second high civilian award Hilal-i-Imtiaz for his diverse contributions to research in physics and the contribution to science.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nHilal-i-Imtiaz, Government of Pakistan (2000)\n\nHEC Distinguished Professor Award (2007)\n\nKhawarzmi International Award in Physics (2003)\n\nGold Medal (Jointly with Riazuddin), Pakistan Academy of Sciences (1979)\n\nD.
