We at LUMS gear all our efforts towards assisting as many students as possible within our limited resources. Financial assistance is offered to students with demonstrated need. These awards at the Undergraduate level are available in the form of Tuition Fee Waivers and LUMS Interest-Free Loans.\n\nUndergraduate need-based assistance covers partial to full tuition fee expenses of the programme. The range of the amount of financial assistance over the last year has been between 20% and 100%. These awards are reassessed in each academic year based upon performance and demonstrated financial need. Financial Aid fee waiver is not required to be repaid whilst LUMS Interest-Free Loan will have to be paid back after six (6) months of graduation within a maximum period of five (5) years.\n\nRemember a loan is an obligation and is required to be paid back in instalments after graduation. Repayment of loan not only contributes towards the recirculation of Financial Aid to deserving students but also inculcates social responsibility and ethical values within the students.\n\nNational Outreach Programme\n\nIf you are a talented, brilliant and aspiring young student who excels academically yet is constricted by financial circumstances, then the National Outreach Programme (NOP) at LUMS is for you! The NOP was launched in 2001, with the motive to provide the talented yet financially challenged youth of Pakistan a chance to study at LUMS on full financial aid. We aim to bring the brightest minds together from every corner of Pakistan to study at the University. Since its establishment, the NOP has successfully instated approximately 1,450 brilliant students and continues to facilitate many more annually. Almost 1,000 graduated students have gone out to achieve, thrive and make an impact in their communities.\n\nIn order to be eligible for the NOP, a student must have at least 80% marks in Matric or the grade equivalent in O Levels and must have the basis of financial need. In order to spread the word of higher education and inform students of the opportunities available through the NOP, the NOP team visits schools and colleges in various cities, towns and villages all over Pakistan to give presentations about the programme and how students can apply and benefit from the same.\n\nClick here to visit NOP website\n\nMerit Scholarship\n\nLUMS not only recognises students' good academic performance but also distinguishes high achievers by providing them generous merit scholarships.
