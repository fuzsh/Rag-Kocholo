        "text": "Mohammad Abdus Salam[2] (Urdu: محمد عبد السلام) (January 29, 1926; Sahiwal, Punjab, British Raj (present-day Pakistan) – November 21, 1996; Oxford, England)[3] was a Pakistani theoretical physicist, astrophysicist and Nobel laureate in Physics for his work in Electro-Weak Theory. Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg shared the prize for this discovery. Salam holds the distinction of being the first Pakistani and the first Muslim Nobel Laureate to receive the prize in the Sciences. Even today, Salam is considered one of the most influential scientists and physicists in his country.\n\nContents\n\n[hide]\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Youth and education\n\n1.2 Later career\n\n1.3 Religion\n\n1.4 Death\n\n1.5 Legacy\n\n1.6 Documentary Film (Docufilm)\n\n2 Career in science\n\n2.1 Pakistan’s Space Program\n\n2.2 Involvement in Pakistan’s Nuclear Weapons Programme\n\n2.3 Contributions\n\n2.4 Awards[20]\n\n3 Institutes Named After Abdus Salam\n\n4 See also\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nBiography\n\nYouth and education\n\nSalam’s father was an officer in the Department of Education in a poor farming district. His family has a long tradition of piety and learning.\n\nAt age fourteen, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the Matriculation Examination at the Punjab University. He won a scholarship to the Government College, Punjab University, in Lahore. As a fourth-year student there, he published his work on Srinivasa Ramanujan.[4] He received his master’s degree from the Government College in 1946. That same year, he was awarded a scholarship to St. John’s College, Cambridge University, where he completed a BA degree with Double First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Physics in 1949. In 1950, he received the Smith’s Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to Physics.\n\nHe obtained a PhD degree in Theoretical Physics at Cambridge. His doctoral thesis contained fundamental work in Quantum Electrodynamics. By the time it was published in 1951, it had already gained him an international reputation and the Adams Prize.[5]\n\nDr. Salam receiving the Nobel Prize from the King of Sweden\n\nLater career\n\nHe returned to the Government College University, Lahore as a Professor of Mathematics from 1951 to 1954 and then went back to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics.\n\nIn 1956 he was invited to take a chair at Imperial College, London, where he and Paul Matthews created a lively theoretical physics group. He remained a professor at Imperial until his retirement.\n\nDuring the early 1960s Salam played a very significant role in establishing the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) – the atomic research agency of Pakistan – and Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) – the space research agency of Pakistan, of which he was the founding director. Due to Prof. Salam’s influence President Ayub Khan had the Nuclear Power Plant near Karachi (KANUPP) personally approved, against the wishes of his own Government[6]. Salam was also instrumental in setting up five Superior Science colleges throughout Pakistan to further the progress in science in the country. Salam was a firm believer that “scientific thought is the common heritage of mankind,” and that developing nations needed to help themselves and invest into their own scientists to boost development and reduce the gap between the Global South and the Global North, thus contributing to a more peaceful world. Salam also founded the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) and was a leading figure in the creation of a number of international centres dedicated to the advancement of science and technology.\n\nIn 1964, Salam founded International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, in the North-East of Italy. He was the Director of ICTP from 1964 to December 1993. The Centre has since been renamed to (The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics). In 1959, he became one of the youngest to be named Fellow of the Royal Society at the age of 33.\n\nIn 1998, the Government of Pakistan issued a stamp carrying his portrait as part of a series entitled “Scientists of Pakistan.”[7]. He was a foreign fellow of Bangladesh Academy of Sciences [8]\n\nSpeech at the Nobel Banquet\n\nDelivered on 10 December 1979.\n\nYour Majesties, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nOn behalf of my colleagues, Professors Glashow and Weinberg, I thank the Nobel Foundation and the Royal Academy of Sciences for the great honor and the courtesies extended to us, including the courtesy to me of being addressed in my language Urdu.\n\nٻاکستان اس کے لیے آٻ کا بھت مشکور ھے\n\nPakistan is deeply indebted to you for this.\n\nThe creation of physics is the shared heritage of all mankind. East and West, North and South have equally participated in it. In the Holy Book of Islam, Allah says:\n\nمَا تَرٰى فِىْ خَلْقِ الرَّحْمٰنِ مِنْ تَفٰوُتٍ‌ فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَۙ هَلْ تَرٰى مِنْ فُطُوْرٍ‏\n\nثُمَّ ارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ كَرَّتَيْنِ يَنْقَلِبْ اِلَيْكَ الْبَصَرُ خَاسِئًا وَّهُوَ حَسِيْرٌ‏\n\n‘Thou sees not, in the creation of the All-merciful any imperfection. Return thy gaze, seest thou any fissure. Then Return thy gaze, again and again. Thy gaze, Comes back to thee dazzled, aweary.’\n\nThis in effect is, the faith of all physicists; the deeper we seek, the more is our wonder excited, the more is the dazzlement for our gaze.\n\nI am saying this, not only to remind those here tonight of this, but also for those in the Third World, who feel they have lost out in the pursuit of scientific knowledge, for lack of opportunity and resource.\n\nAlfred Nobel stipulated that no distinction of race or color will determine who received of his generosity. On this occasion, let me say this to those, whom God has given His Bounty. Let us strive to provide equal opportunities to all so that they can engage in the creation of physics and science for the benefit of all mankind. This would exactly be in the spirit of Alfred Nobel. and the ideas which permeated his life. Bless You![4]\n\nReligion\n\nAbdus Salam was a devout Muslim, and a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community[9], who saw his religion as integral to his scientific work. He once wrote: “The Holy Quran enjoins us to reflect on the verities of Allah’s created laws of nature; however, that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of His design is a bounty and a grace for which I render thanks with a humble heart.”[5]\n\nDuring his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Salam quoted the following verses from the Quran:\n\n“ Thou seest not, in the creation of the All-merciful any imperfection, Return thy gaze, seest thou any fissure. Then Return thy gaze, again and again. Thy gaze, Comes back to thee dazzled, aweary. ”\n\nHe then said:\n\n“ This, in effect, is the faith of all physicists; the deeper we seek, the more is our wonder excited, the more is the dazzlement for our gaze.[10] ”\n\nIn 1974, when the Parliament of Pakistan declared Ahmadis to be non-Muslims, he left Pakistan for London in protest.\n\nDeath\n\nThe defaced grave of Abdus Salam in Rabwah\n\nSalam died on 21st November 1996 at the age of 70 in Oxford, England after a long illness. His body was brought to Pakistan and kept in Darul Ziafat, where some 13,000 men and women visited to pay their last respects. Some 30,000 people attended his funeral prayers.\n\nSalam was buried in the graveyard Bahishti Maqbara in Rabwah next to his parents’ graves. The epitaph on his tomb initially read “First Muslim Nobel Laureate” but, because of Salam’s adherence to the Ahmadiyya Muslim sect, the word “Muslim” was later erased on the orders of a local magistrate, leaving the non-sensical “First Nobel Laureate“.[11]\n\nSalam was responsible for laying the groundwork for the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, initiating research on problems of waterlogging and salinity, and agricultural research. He played a crucial role in PAEC and SUPARCO, the National Space Agency of Pakistan. He helped Pakistan’s scientists and engineers to be trained in nuclear applications and nuclear science.\n\nLegacy\n\nAbdus Salam’s work in Pakistan has been far reaching and influential. He has made extraordinary contributions to Pakistan’s nuclear, space and missile programs. Therefore, in 1998, the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp to honour the services of Abdus Salam as part of its “Scientists of Pakistan” series.\n\nAbdus Salam has been commemorated by Pakistan’s noted and prominent scientists, who were also his students. Many scientists have recalled their college experiences. Ghulam Murtaza, a professor of plasma physics at the Government College University, Lahore has said:\n\n” When Dr. Salam was to deliver a lecture, the hall would be packed and although the subject was Particle Physics, his manner and eloquence was such as if he was talking about literature. When he finished his lectures, listeners would often burst into spontaneous applause and give him a standing ovation. People from all parts of the world would come to Imperial College and seeks Dr. Salam’s help. He would give a patient hearing to everyone including those who were talking nonsense. He treated everyone with respect and compassion and never belittled or offended anyone. Dr. Salam’s strength was that he could “sift jewels from the sand” [12].\n\nIn August 1996, former chairman of PAEC and lifelong friend, Munir Ahmad Khan met with Salam in Oxford, United Kingdom along with dr. Ishfaq Ahmad. Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad, who is a former professor of nuclear physics at the Quaid-i-Azam University, recalls:\n\n“Dr. Abdus Salam was responsible for sending about 500 physicists, mathematicians and scientists from Pakistan, for PhD’s to the best institutions in UK and USA“ [1].\n\nThe late Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan, a famous Pakistani nuclear engineer and former PAEC chairman said:\n\n“My last meeting with Abdus Salam was only three months ago. His disease had taken its toll and he was unable to talk. Yet he understood what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him[12].”\n\nDocumentary Film (Docufilm)\n\nA documentary film on the life and science of Abdus Salam is in the works and will be directed by Sabiha Sumar[1] subject to collection of donations valued to $500,000.\n\nCareer in science\n\nSalam returned to Pakistan in 1951 to teach Mathematics at the Government College, Lahore. In 1952, he became the Head of the Mathematics Department of the Punjab University. In 1954, Salam went for a lectureship at Cambridge, although he visited Pakistan from time to time as an adviser on science policy to the Government of Pakistan. His work for Pakistan was far-reaching and influential. He was a member of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and work their as a chief scientist with his students, a member of the Scientific Commission of Pakistan, Founder Chairman of Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission and Chief Scientific Adviser to the President of Pakistan from 1961 to 1974.\n\nFrom 1957 onwards, he was Professor of Theoretical Physics at Imperial College, London. From 1964 onwards, has combined this position with that of Director of the International Centre For Theoretical Physics, a research institution in Trieste, Italy.\n\nSalam had a prolific research career in theoretical elementary particle physics. He either pioneered or was associated with all the important developments in this field. He also served on a number of United Nations committees concerning science and technology in developing countries.[5]. Many prominent scientists, which includes, Ghulam Murtaza, Riazuddin, Kamaluddin Ahmed, Faheem Hussain, Raziuddin Siddiqui, Munir Ahmad Khan, Ishfaq Ahmad, and I. H. Usmani, considered him as their chief mentor and a teacher. Abdus salam played a important and a crucial role in preparing and teaching of future pakistani engineers and scientists in the field of mathematics and physics.\n\nA moment of trial and disappointment in his career\n\nWhen we study biography of any successful person, the emphasis is on his or her strengths and achievements. There is also an element of legend and myth making knowingly and unknowingly. In this process, often the lesson for the ordinary person, as to how he or she can emulate the successful person is lost. In view of this the moments of disappointments are sometimes more revealing than the moments of victory, success and glory. Let me quote, about a phase of life of Salam from Gordon Fraser’s book, Cosmic Anger: Abdus Salam – The First Muslim Nobel Scientist:\n\nNow better informed, in December 1949 Salam went to see Kemmer and asked to be taken on as a research student in theoretical physics. He did not know that Kemmer was already trying to resist pressure from his peers to take him on as another research student – Salam’s examination performance could not be ignored. But with his hands already full with eight other research students, Kemmer did not want any more. He did not expect any newcomer to be as easy to manage as Paul Matthews had been. When he eventually met Salam, Kemmer was still not impressed by the subservient young applicant (‘I nearly refused Salam’, he said later), and suggested that he went instead to Rudolf Peierls in Birmingham. Some ten years before, Peierls had guided Fred Hoyle’s first steps in research at Cambridge, and had later played a key role in the development of the wartime atomic bomb, where he had been among the first to realize just how compact a critical mass of fissionable nuclear matter could be. Salam had been living in Britain for more than three years, but was uneasy about moving to a strange, large city. He knew Cambridge well, and felt comfortable in its great machine of learning. He wanted to do research and live in college, not to have to fend for himself in a place he did not know. In Pakistan, his wife was now expecting a child. Above all, he was confused and depressed after his fruitless tryst with experimental work, his sudden plunge into deep theoretical waters, and the cool reception from Kemmer. After having followed the advice of his colleagues who had told him to move into research, Salam was now angry and frustrated. His Indian contemporary Ram Prakash Bambah recalls Salam alleging that they had ‘misguided’ him, and using ‘very strong Punjabi expressions’ in his disappointments. Salam pleaded with the haughty Kemmer, asking to be taken on ‘peripherally’, and this time was told to go and talk to Matthews.[5]\n\nSalam’s meeting with Paul Matthews opened a new chapter of friendship and collaboration in the life of both.\n\nPakistan’s Space Program\n\nIt was Salam’s advice to the President of Pakistan, Ayub Khan, that led to the establishment of the national space agency of Pakistan. In 16 September 1961, Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission was established by an executive order. Salam was appointed its first chairman[13]. Salam also appointed Air Comm. Wladyslaw Turowicz, a noted Pakistani-Polish military scientist and an engineer, as Pakistan’s rocket firing head.\n\nInvolvement in Pakistan’s Nuclear Programme\n\nAbdus Salam knew the importance of nuclear technology in Pakistan. Salam was a central figure in Pakistan’s nuclear program. Abdus Salam was responsible for establishing the nuclear research institutes in Pakistan. In 1972, Government of Pakistan learned about the India’s nuclear weapon program. The then Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, formed a group of nuclear scientists and engineers, initially headed by Salam. He closely collaborated with his noted colleague and long-associated friend, Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan, in the field of nuclear technology in Pakistan.\n\nIn December 1972, two theoretical physicists working at the ICTP were asked by Salam to report to noted Pakistani nuclear scientist, Munir Ahmad Khan (late), then-PAEC chairman[14]. This marked the beginning of the “Theoretical Physics Group” or TPG. The TPG, in PAEC, was assigned to develop the theoretical designs Pakistan’s nuclear weapon devices. The TPG team under the leadership of Riazuddin, who is also Salam’s distinguished student, completed the work on the theoretical design of the Nuclear weapon device by 1977[15].\n\nContributions\n\nSalam’s primary focus was research on the physics of elementary particles. His particular contributions included:\n\ntwo-component neutrino theory and the prediction of the inevitable parity violation in weak interaction;\n\ngauge unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, the unified force is called the “Electroweak” force, a name given to it by Salam, and which forms the basis of the Standard Model in particle physics;\n\npredicted existence of weak neutral currents and W particles and Z particles before their experimental discovery;[16]\n\nsymmetry properties of elementary particles; unitary symmetry;\n\nrenormalization of meson theories;\n\ngravity theory and its role in particle physics; two tensor theory of gravity and strong interaction physics;\n\nunification of electroweak with strong nuclear forces, grand unification theory;\n\nrelated prediction of proton-decay;\n\nPati-Salam model, a grand unification theory;\n\nSupersymmetry theory, in particular formulation of Superspace and formalism of superfields in 1974;\n\nthe theory of supermanifolds, as a geometrical framework for understanding supersymmetry, in 1974;[17]\n\nSupergeometry, the geometric basis for supersymmetry, in 1974;[18]\n\napplication of the Higgs mechanism to the electroweak symmetry breaking;\n\nprediction of the magnetic photon in 1966;[19]\n\nAwards[20]\n\nHopkins Prize (Cambridge University) for “the most outstanding contribution to Physics during 1957-1958”\n\nAdams Prize (Cambridge University) (1958)\n\nSitara-e-Pakistan for contribution to science in Pakistan (1959).\n\nFirst recipient of Maxwell Medal and Award (Physical Society, London) (1961)\n\nHughes Medal (Royal Society, London) (1964)\n\nAtoms for Peace Award (Atoms for Peace Foundation) (1968)\n\nJ.
