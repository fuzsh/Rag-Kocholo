        "text": "by Pervez Hoodbhoy\n\nIt was mid-October 1973 when, after a grueling 26-hour train ride from Karachi, I reached the physics department of Islamabad University (or Quaid-e-Azam University, as it is now known). As I dumped my luggage and “hold-all” in front of the chairman's office, a tall, handsome man with twinkling eyes looked at me curiously. He was wearing a bright orange Che Guevara t-shirt and shocking green pants. His long beard, though shorter than mine, was just as unruly and unkempt. We struck up a conversation. At 23, I had just graduated from MIT and was to be a lecturer in the department; he had already been teaching as associate professor for five years. The conversation turned out to be the beginning of a lifelong friendship. Together with Abdul Hameed Nayyar – also bearded at the time – we became known as the Sufis of Physics. Thirty six years later, when Faheem Hussain lost his battle against prostate cancer, our sadness was beyond measure.\n\nRevolutionary, humanist, and scientist, Faheem Hussain embodied the political and social ferment of the late 1960's. With a Ph.D that he received in 1966 from Imperial College London, he had been well-placed for a solid career anywhere in the world. In a profession where names matter, he had worked under the famous P.T. Mathews in the group headed by the even better known Abdus Salam. After his degree, Faheem spent two years at the University of Chicago. This gave him a chance to work with some of the world's best physicists, but also brought him into contact with the American anti-Vietnam war movement and a powerful wave of revolutionary Marxist thinking. Even decades later, Faheem would describe himself as an “unreconstructed Marxist”. Participating in the mass anti-war demonstrations at UC had stirred his moral soul; he felt the urge to do more than just physics. Now married to Jane Steinfels, a like-minded soul who he met in Chicago, Faheem decided to return to Pakistan.\n\nFaheem and Jane made an amazing couple. Fully immersed in the outstanding causes of the times, they seemed to have a limitless amount of revolutionary energy. Long before I knew them, they had been protesting against the Pakistan Army's actions in East Pakistan. As Faheem would recount, this was a lonely fight. Many Marxists in those times, inspired by Mao's China, chose to understand the issue in geopolitical terms rather than as a popular struggle for independence. Some leftists ended up supporting the army's mass murder of Bengalis.\n\nWith Bangladesh now a reality, things moved on. Bhutto's rhetoric of\n\nsocialism and justice for the poor had inspired nascent trade union\n\nmovements to sprout across Pakistan's cities. Many, however, quickly\n\nturned into organizations for labour control rather than emancipation.\n\nThere were genuinely independent ones too, such as the Peoples Labour\n\nFederation (PLF), an independent Rawalpindi based trade union that saw\n\nthrough Bhutto's shallow rhetoric. In the early 1970's, Faheem and Jane\n\nwere highly influential in this organization, sometimes providing security\n\nand cover to its hunted leadership. Iqbal Bali, who passed away in the\n\nmiddle of this year, would vividly recount those days.\n\nVery soon, I joined the small group of leftwing activists that looked up\n\nto this couple for instruction and guidance. We formed study groups\n\noperating under the PLF, both for self-education and for spreading the\n\nmessage through small study groups of industrial workers. Some, including\n\nmyself, branched out further, working in distant villages. Gathering\n\nmaterial support for the Baloch nationalists, who were fighting an army\n\nrejuvenated by Bhutto, was yet another goal for the group. The dream was\n\nto bring about a socialist revolution in Pakistan.\n\nAll this crashed to an end with Bhutto's death by hanging in 1979 and the\n\nsubsequent consolidation of General Zia-ul-Haq's coup. Pakistan's Dark Age\n\nhad just begun. Although Bhutto's regime had turned repressive and violent\n\nin its last desperate days, it was gentle in comparison with what was to\n\nfollow. With dissent savagely muzzled, the only option was to operate\n\nunderground. On 3 November 1981, three of our QAU colleagues and friends\n\nwere caught, imprisoned, and savaged by the military regime. Jamil Omar, a\n\nlecturer in computer science and the “ring leader” – was tortured. Two\n\nothers – Tariq Ahsan and Mohammed Salim – were also imprisoned and their\n\ncareers destroyed. Their crime was involvement in the secret publication\n\nof “Jamhoori Pakistan”, a 4-page newsletter that demanded return to\n\ndemocracy and the end of army rule. A triumphant Zia-ul-Haq went on\n\nPakistan Television, congratulated the men who had succeeded in arresting\n\nthe teachers, and pledged to “eliminate the cancer of politics” from\n\nQuaid-e-Azam University.\n\nAlthough Faheem was not directly involved in “Jamhoori Pakistan”, we knew\n\nhe was being closely watched by the intelligence and could have chosen to\n\nhide. Instead, with characteristic fearlessness, he did all that was\n\npossible to help locate the abducted teachers, and then to secure their\n\nrelease. Tariq Ahsan wrote to me from Canada that “His solidarity during\n\nthose long years was an invaluable source of support for our families and\n\nfriends.”\n\nBut the struggle took its toll. By the mid 1980's, Faheem was in the\n\ndoldrums. Situated in an academically barren environment, he was able to\n\npublish little research of worth. Politically, there was no chance of\n\ndoing anything significant in the climate of repression. Things had gone\n\ndownhill in personal terms as well – his marriage with Jane was coming\n\napart. To the great sorrow of their friends, the couple parted ways and\n\nJane returned to America. Encouraged by Faheem, she had written school\n\nbooks on Pakistani history that are still sold and used today. In 1989,\n\nFaheem left QAU formally but his involvement in academic and political\n\nmatters had already dropped off in the year or two before that.\n\nFrom this low point in his life, Faheem struggled upwards. Initially in\n\nGermany, and then elsewhere later, he now concentrated solely upon his\n\nprofession and was able to learn an impressive amount of new physics.\n\nProfessor Abdus Salam, who by now had received a Nobel Prize for his work,\n\ninvited Faheem to become a permanent member of the theoretical physics\n\ngroup at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Italy. Faheem\n\nremained there until his retirement in 2004. Getting this position was no\n\nmean achievement: theoretical physics is a fiercely competitive and\n\nnotoriously difficult subject. Faheem was the first Pakistani to publish a\n\nresearch paper in one of its most challenging areas – superstring theory.\n\nWith a cheerful and positive disposition, and an abiding concern for the\n\nwelfare of others, Faheem quickly became popular at the ICTP. His laughter\n\nwould resonate in the institute's corridors. With time, he took on\n\nadministrative responsibilities as well and was instrumental in setting up\n\na “Diploma Programme” that admits students from third world countries for\n\nadvanced studies in various areas. Now married to Sara, a beautiful and\n\neven-tempered Italian woman, he was equally comfortable with Italians and\n\nPakistanis or, for that matter, Indians. To Faheem, a cultural amphibian,\n\ndifferences between nations carried no meaning.\n\nAnd then came retirement time. What to do? I wrote to Faheem: come back!\n\nHe agreed. Finding money was not a problem – Pakistan's higher education\n\nwas experiencing a budgetary boom. But his old university, plagued by base\n\nrivalries and a contemptuous disdain for learning, refused. Specious\n\narguments were given to prevent one of its own founding members, now one\n\nof Pakistan's most distinguished and active physicists, from being taken\n\non the faculty. Initially at the National Centre for Physics in Islamabad,\n\nFaheem was eventually offered a position at the newly established science\n\nfaculty of LUMS in Lahore.\n\nFaheem's unpretentious mannerisms and gentleness of spirit ensured that\n\nLUMS too was enamored of him. Asad Naqvi, one of Pakistan's leading\n\nphysicists and a faculty member at LUMS, wrote to me upon hearing of\n\nFaheem's death: “I am lost after hearing this. I only knew him for about 5\n\nyears, and in that short time, I had grown really fond of him. We are all\n\npoorer today, having lost such a lovely person who touched us so deeply.”\n\nSurely, there shall be many other such tributes from Faheem's many\n\nfriends. But, to be true to him as well as my own self, I must admit that\n\nin later years we did disagree on some important things – “unreconstructed\n\nMarxism” to me is an anachronism, a relic of the 1960's and still earlier,\n\nmeaningless in a world that has become far more complex than Marx could\n\nhave possibly imagined. Nor can I reflexively support today's so-called\n\n“anti-imperialism” of the left that ends up supporting the forces of\n\nregressive fundamentalism. But let these issues stand wherever they do.\n\nWhy is it necessary for friends to agree upon everything?\n\nFrom atoms to atoms – death is inevitable, the final victory of entropy\n\nover order. Meaningless? No! To have lived a full life, to have\n\nexperienced its richness, to have struggled not just for one-self but for\n\nothers as well, and to have earned the respect and love of those around\n\nyou. That is a life worth living for. Faheem, my friend, you are gone. May\n\nyou now rest in peace, with a job well done.\n\nPervez Hoodbhoy is the Chairman of the Department of Physics at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad."
