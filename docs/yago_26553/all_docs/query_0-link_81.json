        "text": "It is claimed that only one gluon is massless and the other seven gluons are massive. Out of eight gluons, six are colored and two are neutral. Among neutral gluons, one is massless and other one is massive. Massive neutral gluon is heavier than the colored gluons. Gluons can only be predicted by set theory but not by SU(3).\n\nThe study reviewed the course codes at undergraduate level in selected universities and Higher Education Commission (HEC). The objectives of the study were to investigate the coding system of courses and propose a system for coding the courses at tertiary level in Pakistan. The coding system of different universities, inside and outside Pakistan, was analyzed and a system of coding was proposed. The study found discrepancies in the coding of courses that cause difficulties for academic bodies and transfer of credits from one university to another. It is recommended that courses of a degree required may be divided in 1) General Education requirements, 2) Subject specific foundation courses, 3) subject specific major compulsory courses, and 4) subject specific major elective courses. For codes 2, 3 or 4 capital letters for a subject along with three numbers (xxx) may be used to specify each course of the university. The left digit of the three may be used for the hardship level. The...\n\nStudies on naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) in the limestone from the Margalla Hills have been carried out by measuring gamma activity and to access its radiological implications if any. For data acquisition, a High-Purity Germanium detector was employed. The activity concentrations of 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K were found to be 14.32±0.24, 2.05±0.04, and 13.80±0.20 Bq kg −1 , respectively. These values are relatively lower as compared to that in the limestone of other countries and much lower than the values reported for the natural building stones. The average specific activities due to 226 Ra were found to be higher when compared with 40 K and 232 Th. Indices of radium equivalent activity (Ra eq), internal hazard (H in), indoor absorbed gamma dose rate (D R,), and corresponding annual effective dose (E eff) were also determined for the limestone-made rooms. All of these indices were found to be in the lower ranges. The Margalla Hills limestone does not pose any excessive radiological health hazard as a building material and in industrial uses for a common man."
