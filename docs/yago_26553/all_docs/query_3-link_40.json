I like to focus on my students individual goals no matter what they may be. We are all different and that is an important thing. Some of us want to pursue trades school, some want to study the cosmos, both are equally important. I will personally tailor lessons towards your specific goals and help you reach them. Maybe you only need help with homework. Or, you want to improve in mathematics and problem solving in general. Perhaps you are looking to enter a STEM program and want to get the best preparation possible. In our first meeting we will discuss your goals and each lesson will be curated to reach them. Mathematics is often confusing because people do not see the pattern. Once the pattern is found, the math is clear. I will help guide you towards seeing the patterns and understanding the mathematics so you do not feel like your learning a million different things. One of my skills that i've developed over the many years as a math educator is being able to diagnose the underlying problem by asking a few simple questions. Once it is clear what you are misunderstanding, I will provide a set of problems and questions which are designed meticulously to bring you from your level to the level you want to be. I like to remind my students that they are smart and creative and they can become better at math just like any other activity or sport; through practice. In this case, guided practice. I will be a coach, a teacher, a tutor, and at times perhaps a peer since my students surprise me all the time with their unique abilities. I want to show you that you can be good at math and it might just require a change of perspective on the subject. Math can be fun and engaging and isnt just a bunch of recipes and instructions. I have lots of experience building fun and creative problems, puzzles and games for math contests and K12 math. I hope to share my passion for math with you!\n\nread more\n\nSubjects : AP Physics, Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Calculus, Competition Math, Elementary Math, Functions, Geometry, Math, PSLE Math, Physics, Pre-Algebra, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry\n\n15min Free Session\n\nPackage Deals\n\nAssignment Help"
