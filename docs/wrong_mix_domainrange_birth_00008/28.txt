Career

Thaniyavarthanam (1987)

A. K. Lohithadas and Sibi Malayil collaborated on the 1987 Malayalam drama film Thaniyavarthanam. It features Kaviyoor Ponnamma Mukesh as Gopinathan Thilakan as the matrilineal family's uncle and Mammootty as school teacher Balagopalan. After being released, it gained cult status. The Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor went to Thilakan.

An art instructor named Balan Mash resides in a small hamlet in Kerala. With two children, a wife, a mother and a revolutionary brother named Gopi, he leads a peaceful life in a typical Keralan joint household. A mentally challenged uncle of Balan Mash. After breaking up with his sweetheart, his uncle had a mental illness. This highlights the family's ingrained belief that one male will develop mental illness for every generation since a member of a previous generation sinned by tossing the idol of "Devi" in a well. The goddess cursed him, turning him insane. There would be a generational transmission of this curse.

When Balan Mash's uncle passed away, "Who would be next" became the topic of conversation. It all changed one night when Balan had a nightmare. Due to the fact that Balan's uncle experienced a mental illness and nightmares, many began to suspect Balan of following in his uncle's path toward insanity. Now, the people in Balan's neighbourhood judge every action he does; they think he's crazy and misinterpret what he's doing. He is eventually admitted to the asylum after his family joins the gang. He is deemed sane by the physician. However, society disagrees. Balan plays the fool because he is powerless. Balan's mother ultimately poisons him to sever him from the outside world.

It won praise from the critics after its debut. Superstition and orthodoxy in rural Kerala attitudes toward mental illness, the disparity in attitudes across generations and the downfall of once-proud Nair joint families are only a few of the subjects covered in the movie. Even now, the screenplay by Lohithadas stands out for its realistic portrayal and scientific veracity.

Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha (1989)

The 1989 Indian epic historical drama film Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha, written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair and directed by Hariharan stars Mammootty Suresh Gopi Balan K. Nair Captain Raju and Madhavi. The movie won eight Kerala State Film Awards in addition to four National Film Awards in 1989 for Best Actor (Mammootty), Best Screenplay (M. T. Vasudevan Nair), Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design.

It takes place in Northern Kerala in the sixteenth century. The event takes place at Puthooram, the legendary Kannappan Chekavar's home. After the boy loses both of his parents, Kannappan Chekavar adopts him and brings him to Puthooram, where he will live and study alongside his relatives. The quick-witted orphan youngster Chandu wins the love and respect of his uncle, but his cousin Aromal Chekavar despises him. Chandu is engaged to Unniyarcha, the daughter of Chekavar, as they get older. Chandu is eventually driven into a corner by his cousin after a series of events. Under the direction of Chekavar Aringodar, a Tulunadan expert and master, he flees to Kali.

This movie, which is frequently regarded as a masterpiece of Malayalam cinema, is based on a subplot of the North Malabar-based medieval poem Vadakkan Pattukal. The narrative retells the life of the fabled Chandu Chekavar, portraying him as an unfortunate, misunderstood but ultimately honourable man as opposed to the treacherous figure who gained him the folkloric moniker Chathiyan Chandu (literally Chandu the Betrayer).

Mathilukal (1990)

Adoor Gopalakrishnan wrote, directed and produced the 1990 Indian Malayalam film Mathilukal which is based on Vaikom Muhammad Basheer's autobiographical novel of the same name. In the movie, Mammootty portrays Vaikom Muhammad Basheer while K. P. A. C. Lalitha voices Narayani. The movie was shown at the Venice Film Festival. It was the third Malayalam film to receive four National Awards at the 1990 National Film Awards.

This movie, which is based on Vaikom Muhammad Basheer's autobiographical novella, revolves around the outspoken writer from 1940s India who openly criticises the British Empire's imperialist rule over his country in his writing. Bashir is imprisoned for what the British perceive to be treason because of his unrepentant disobedience. Vaikom starts a regular dialogue with an unseen female prisoner in a nearby prison while he is imprisoned. Love blossoms despite their captivity. Since they cannot see one another due to the high wall separating them, they must come up with creative means of communication. Bashir's love Narayani is portrayed by a female voice but never physically appears in the movie.

Mammootty's performance in the movie was listed as one of the 25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema by Forbes on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Indian cinema in April 2013.

Amaram (1991)

Amaram is a 1991 Indian Malayalam drama movie that was written and directed by Bharathan. The film's primary cast includes Mammootty Maathu K. P. A. C. Lalitha Ashokan Murali Chitra, and Kuthiravattam Pappu. Johnson wrote the film's score, and Raveendran wrote the songs.

The tale of Achootty, a fisherman and Radha, his daughter, is told in Amaram. The ignorant Achootty wants his daughter to go to school and pursue a career in medicine. When she falls in love with her childhood buddy, his hopes are dashed. The boyfriend of Achootys' daughter, she elopes and marries one fine day. Achootty initially dislikes his son-in-law and, after being disappointed, stops speaking to his daughter.

However, over time, the young man demonstrates that he is a skilled and diligent fisherman, earning Achootty's admiration. While not publicly acknowledging this, Achooty continues to harass his son-in-law by telling him to catch a shark and prove himself before he dares to speak to Achooty. The son-in-law finally decides that enough is enough and heads out to sea to catch a shark. He ventures out in his catamaran alone, yet he lacks experience and does it out of sheer audacity. People assume that Achootty, who had also gone to the water that day, killed him at sea when he didn't show up. Everyone is apprehensive about going to the sea to look for him because it is a windy night. Achootty's daughter now believes that her father has murdered her husband. Achootty decides to go to the sea because he has nothing to lose and discovers his son-in-law comatose on the wreckage of his boat. He is saved by Achootty, who returns him to the shore. Although everybody recognises Achootty's innocence, he still feels let down by them. Finally, they show him boarding his boat and heading out into the ocean, which, according to Achootty, is the only thing that has ever loved him unconditionally.

For playing, Bhargavi K. P. A. C. Lalitha got the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. The Filmfare Awards South Best Actor Award went to Mammotty for his performance. The movie is regarded as a masterpiece in Malayalam cinema and was a critical and financial success. More than 200 days were spent running it at Ragam Theatre.

Mammootty Siddique Geetha Janardhanan, Sunitha Ilavarasi Aboobacker, and Kaviyoor Ponnamma are among the actors who appear in it. The movie follows two brothers, Meledathu Raghavan Nair and Vijayakumaran Nair, and contrasts traditional and modern values.

Raghavan Nair, a farmer and family patriarch, steadily loses control of his household after his younger brother Vijayan receives his law degree and tries to establish his social status.

One of the first things Vijayan must do is rule out the option of getting married to the rural lady his older brother has picked out for him.

Vidheyan (1994)

Adoor Gopalakrishnan directed and wrote the drama film Vidheyan, which was released in 1994 in India's Malayalam language.

The lead actors are M. R. Gopakumar and Mammootty.

The violent authoritarian landlord Bhaskara Pattelar rules over Thommy, a Christian migrant worker from Kerala. Thommy complies with all instructions from his master, including those to kill Pattelar's benevolent wife, Saroja or to make his own wife sexually available to his master. Thommy follows Pattelar like a pet as he flees into a jungle as a result of his own actions. Thommy, however, rejoices in his freedom when Pattelar is killed.

Both the Best Actor Award for Mammootty and the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam went to the movie. Additionally, it received multiple honours from the Kerala State Film Awards, including Best Film.

Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar (2000)

The 2000 Indian feature film Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, which was directed by Jabbar Patel, is multilingual in English and Hindi. Mammootty plays the title character. The movie tells the story of B. R. Ambedkar, who is best known for his contributions to the emancipation of the oppressed castes and, as a result, the oppressed classes in India and for helping to draft the Indian Constitution while serving as the chairman of the Indian Constituent Assembly's Drafting Committee.

In the movie, the years 1901 and 1956 are covered. While Ambedkar's personal life is somewhat brushed over, the movie goes deeper into his life as a reformer. Ambedkar, the first graduate of his untouchable community, is a quiet young man. Even when he travels to New York for additional education, his only worry is that he is there to study and not participate in protests and political concerns. However, his interactions with Afro-Americans, his pro-human rights teachers and the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which grants rights to African Americans, awakened the reformer in him.

Ambedkar fought a social war against the Upper Caste Hindus as Mahatma Gandhi led India's political revolt against British rule. Gandhi and Ambedkar hold opposing ideologies. Nevertheless, Gandhi respected Ambedkar, and it was at his urging that Ambedkar was appointed the first Law Minister during Prime Minister Nehru's administration. The movie closes on a hopeful note with Ambedkar providing millions of untouchables with a different religion in which they can find respect, empathy and equality. He converted to Buddhism after loudly rejecting Hinduism.

The National Film Awards were given to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar in 1999 for Best English-language Feature Film Best Actor (Mammootty) and Best Art Direction (Nitin Chandrakant Desai). Retrospective screenings of the movie were held on August 15, 2016, in honour of the 70th anniversary of Indian Independence Day at the Independence Day Film Festival, which was organized by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and the Ministry of Defence.

On Republic Day, a little boy named Pavan travelled to Kerala after losing everything in the Gujarat earthquake. Operator Madhavan meets the youngster by chance while he is among the beggars. He doesn't like the youngster at first, but he soon warms to him, and the two grow close until the government chooses to send him back to Gujarat.

Controversies

Deleted Action Scene

Henry claimed in an interview with a well-known Malayalam channel that the Vandae Matharam team was forced to cut an action scene from the movie because Mammootty didn't do it justice. He continued by saying that the poorly executed scene had cost him Rs 20 lakh.

He further said that after the Vandae Maatharam incident, he resolved never to collaborate with an arrogant star like Mammootty again.

The action drama Vandae Maatharam was simultaneously shot in Tamil and Malayalam. It also had Arjun and Sneha in the lead roles in addition to Mammootty. It earned poor reviews after its debut and turned out to be one of Mammootty's biggest flops.

Kasaba Controversy

The debate started when Parvathy discussed a degrading scene in Kasaba during a Kerala film festival in December. She had expressed disappointment at witnessing an actor of the highest calibre in a scenario that denigrates women. Due to the comments, Parvathy was cruelly harassed online and even received rape and death threats. Two people were taken into custody by the police as a result of the complaint she filed. Only after everything had occurred did Mammootty make a statement about the situation. The actor claimed that he doesn't seek controversy and that serious arguments are needed. Furthermore, he claimed to have spoken to Parvathy.

Net Worth

Mammootty’s net worth in 2022 is $45 million US or 340 Crore Indian Rupees. The majority of Mammootty's revenue comes from movies and product endorsements. Mammootty receives 10 crore Indian rupees as payment for each film. He earns about Rs 1.5 to 2 crore for special parts in various languages. Mammootty has an opulent way of living.

Mammootty is the owner of several priceless properties throughout Kerala, in addition to a lavish and opulent home in a prime location in Kochi. According to sources, Mammootty is the owner of large agricultural holdings. Additionally, he owns a few guesthouses in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala.

Mammootty, a vehicle enthusiast, has a Mercedes Benz Caravan that is worth Rs. 1.70 crore (estimated). Along with these vehicles, he also owns a Porshe Cayenne valued at Rs. 1.20 crore, an Astron Martin Rapid S worth Rs. 3.29 crore, and a Porshe Panamera worth Rs. 2.1 crore, a Mini Cooper worth Rs. 36 lakhs, an Audi A7 worth Rs. 90 lakhs, a Toyota Land Cruiser worth Rs. 1.45 crore and a Mercedes S 450 worth Rs. 1.36 crore. According to sources, the Mammootty automobile collection is valued at about Rs 11 crore overall.
