        "text": "Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail, better known by his stage name Mammootty, is a Padma Shri awardee and one of the biggest stars in Mollywood in Kerala. Mammootty, often known as Mammooka, is a veteran actor who continues to make news with each new role he takes on, despite being 69 years old. His son Dulquer Salmaan has also become a well-known actor in Bollywood. The actor is now a major star in both Mollywood and Bollywood. It wasnâ€™t until the 2018 film Karwaan that he finally broke into Bollywood. Fans arenâ€™t just interested in Dulquer Salmaanâ€™s performing profession and lavish lifestyle; they also want to know more about the actorâ€™s home and the Mammootty family. The Kochi residences of superstars Mammootty and Dulquer Salmaan have been reviewed in depth for their legions of devoted fans.\n\nThings we covered for you\n\n+\n\n-\n\nExploring Mammoottyâ€™s Brand-New Kochi House\n\nBorn Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail, Mammootty is a household name in Malayalam as an actor, producer, and generous benefactor. He entered the film industry in the early 1980s and quickly climbed to popularity, eventually becoming the dominant force it is in Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu. The actor was just as impressive in films made in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English. His parents, Ismail and Fatima, are the sources of his five siblings. The films Maithilukal, Ponthan Mada, and Nerariyan CBI all star Mammootty.\n\nBoth of his kids, Dalquer and Maqbool, are actors, and he married Sulfath in 1979. The superstar is involved in a wide variety of humanitarian efforts and has won various prestigious awards, including the Padma Shri. Mammootty would rather not discuss his personal life. A lot of people admire his style. Starting at an early age, he relied only on his film work to make an impact. Mammootty is 70 years old, by the way.\n\nMammootty and his family (wife Sulfath, son and actor Dulquer Salmaan, daughter-in-law Amal Sufiya, and granddaughter Maryam Ameerah Salmaan, aged three) relocated to a new home last year. Before we show you around Mammoottyâ€™s new home, we thought you might be interested in learning that Dulquer Salmaanâ€™s wife, Amal Sufiya, is an architect.\n\nDulquer Salmaanâ€™s home, which is situated on the lakeâ€™s edge, is surrounded by a variety of interesting automobiles and motorcycles, all of which are kept in front of the front gate. However, the house is surrounded by stunning scenery. A solar panel-equipped terrace and a verdant panorama complement Dulquerâ€™s massive new homeâ€™s aesthetics.\n\nThe home that Dulquer Salmaan currently resides in has revolutionised the stereotype of a typical house in Kerala. Dalquer Salmaanâ€™s home has sleek modern furnishings and an understated design that belies the fact that he lives in a Muslim country. Both Dulquer Salmaan and Mammootty reportedly enjoy cutting-edge decor.\n\nThe Balcony Area in Mammoottyâ€™s House\n\nThe actor frequently visits this place for his morning and evening teatime rituals. On occasion, Mammootty will also direct morning guests to the same location. Mammootty enjoys taking photographs, thus he often does it while relaxing on the balcony. The houseâ€™s garden may be seen clearly from the balcony. The garden is surrounded by lovely vegetation, and it has been well cared for. There is a separate bench in the garden where you can sit and take in the scenery.\n\nA Look at Dulquer Salmaanâ€™s Living Room\n\nDulquer Salmaanâ€™s living room is a study in soothing tones. To begin, an L-shaped, beige couch that is in keeping with the rest of the roomâ€™s style.\n\nThe white paint on the walls of the living room is a beautiful backdrop for the framed artworks that decorate the room. A pink couch is a fun complement to the roomâ€™s beige sofa. However, by keeping the drapes the same colour as the walls, Mammoottyâ€™s new home is a sight to behold.\n\nThe living roomâ€™s furnishings and carpet are both dark in colour to complement the roomâ€™s overall design approach. Whenever Dulquer Salmaan wants to spend some quality time with his daughter, he heads to this nook in his house.\n\nDulquer Salmaanâ€™s kitchen\n\nNot only is the actor a master of the stage, but he also has a reputation as a culinary genius in the kitchen.\n\nDulquer Salmaanâ€™s kitchen reflects his passion for cooking. The kitchenâ€™s interior is minimalist in design, with marble used throughout.\n\nThe bookcase that doubles as a mini-library is yet another fascinating feature of the area. Dulquer is a bookworm who finds comfort in the written word. The actorâ€™s favourite books are displayed on several shelves of this black bookshelf. On a shelf, he keeps model vehicles, which he uses to satisfy his passion for the automobile.\n\nDulquer Salmaan has a home gym where he works on his strength and conditioning. The actor always finds time to work out, regardless of how hectic his schedule may be.\n\nThe Mammootty House has a Beautiful, Crystal-clear pool.\n\nA beautiful backyard pool has the potential to be both restorative and stimulating. From the comfort of your own home, patio, or porch, even a glimpse of the water can work its calming magic. Because of this, Mammootty and his family had a pool installed in their backyard.\n\nThe pool at Mammootty House is beautiful, and the patio furniture is comfortable and stylish. Theyâ€™ve got some cool garden ornaments around the pool that provide a bit of eccentricity.\n\nA Look Inside the Posh Theatre in the Massive Mansion\n\nThe popularity of home theatres and other forms of entertainment space has increased in recent years. They are professional Mammootty entertainers, and their villa features a single theatre for their use.\n\nThe texture, lines, and colours of this room work so well together. You can go about your normal housework without worrying about any disturbances coming from this location. Although it is located in the basement, the space feels warm and inviting because of the artwork and high-quality furnishings. The home theatreâ€™s audio equipment is discreetly disguised behind custom-made speaker grills; ambient lighting and motorised drapes create the perfect viewing environment day or night.\n\nThe Fascinating Mammootty New House Interior Library\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this house is the bookcase that may be used as a small library. Incorporating books about work and the literary world into your personal library is a natural first step. The inky stained wood, sleek side chair, and minimalist accents provide a beautiful modern take on a traditional library. The built-ins give off the impression of unity thanks to the decorative accents on the bookcases. When space is at a premium, such as in a home office or study, this unit is perfect. In addition to his many books about cars, he also collects miniature replicas of automobiles and displays them on shelves.\n\nMachines galore in the Mammootty Houseâ€™s top-of-the-line private gym\n\nThe actor uses the gyms at both Mammoottyâ€™s and Dulquerhouse to stay in shape. The actor makes time in his busy schedule to exercise regularly. The fitness centre iscompact but has all the essentials for him to get a good workout in. The consistent colour scheme elevates the overall aesthetic without compromising functionality. They can get more done and provide the impression of more space with the help of a wall-to-wall mirror in the gym. Itâ€™s perfect for yin yoga and other forms of floorwork aimed towards relaxation.\n\nHouse Address of Mammootty and Dulquer Salmaan\n\nPanampilly Nagar in Kochi, Kerala is home to Mammootyâ€™s House. Inexpensive and high-quality, Mammootyâ€™s residence address is a steal for so many reasons.\n\nThe famous Panampilly Nagar area of Ernakulam. Some of Panampilly Nagarâ€™s neighbouring neighbourhoods are Vyttila and Vytilla. Many famous people from the worlds of politics, film, and commerce have called the wealthy suburb of the Housing Board (HB) home. The HB is home to seven parks. Thereâ€™s lots of space for parking. Just a few neighbourhoods in Kochi have indeed been master-planned, and Panampilly Nagar is one among them. The Mammooty-house address is, thus, ideal.\n\nExtremely High Home Costs\n\nThe luxurious Mammootty home would set you back INR 4 crore. The solar panels and the luxurious furnishings in Mammootty House are two of the many things that make this home worth admiring. Mammootty House has all the top-shelf amenities, from high-end furniture to luxurious lighting, making it an excellent value-for-money transaction.\n\nGet Your Dream House Like Dulquer Salmaan and Mammoottyâ€™s House With NoBroker\n\nMammootty owns several prestigious properties in Kerala, including his lavish residence in Kochi.
