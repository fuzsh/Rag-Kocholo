        "text": "Just saw the movie. This is what BR would call an ‘interesting movie’. It gives you a lot of things to talk about. But is this an engaging movie? I doubt it.\n\nVJS should be lauded for taking up this role. Only someone truly dedicated to the art form will agree to do those scenes of Shilpa. And Samantha also manages to break many barriers regarding what (married) heroines are supposed to do. But these constantly depressing scenes involving amoral characters are a bit too much to take. As someone remarked in my theatre, why is EVERYONE’s house so unclean and dingy?\n\nI had three main problems with this movie:\n\n1. the flow and the intercutting of the multiple stories is not done well.. . it is like random scenes keep happening, some of which will turn out to be good and in which a few clapworthy (mostly) A-rated dialogues would emerge.\n\n2.there is lot of philosophising dialogues in the movie (which contributes to the sluggishness). I am surprised that BR, who rants about Cheran and Samuthirakani’s lectures, is forgiving of this director’s sermons.\n\n3. The ‘Tsunami Andavar’ track is a clear reference to Christianity. If you want to criticise ‘blind faith’ worship, you could have as easily done it without using what looks (and doesn’t look) like a Jesus statue and without using ‘Christian Tamil’ words.\n\nThe movie has many interesting scenes and dialogues which would amount to 45 minutes – 1 hour of screen time. But the remaining 2hrs was difficult to sit through. That along with this being an A rated movie means that this movie is not going to do well in the box office.\n\nI loved the things I loved about Super Deluxe and hated the things I hated about it unlike Aaranya Kandam which I loved from top to toe. Some epic performances courtesy Faahadh, VJS, Ramya Krishnan, and the kids, the deliciously dark humor which had me clutching my sides and the succulence of the anthology style narrative deserve all the love in the world. I adored the philosophy and funky fundas when it was casually slipped in.\n\nThere were problems though. I always get suspicious of people who wear their progressiveness like a badge of honor though it would seem to appear that the wanton wokeness is an effective armour against negative reviews from otherwise trigger happy critics. Kumararaja seems to have taken an earnest shot at being tolerant and non – judgemental but, but, and a big ol’ but… The adulterous wife is not exactly torn apart by remorse. So far so good. And yet when her husband and a vile cop take it in turns to slut shame her, it feels like this character is being deliberately brutalized for a misdemeanor. If that were not bad enough she is blackmailed into agreeing to provide sexual favours and her husband tries to talk her into it. That is just plain ugly! Sure she gets a happy ending but her punishment for being guilty of adultery feels gritty and all too real while the manufactured happily ever after feels like the director was blowing fairy dust at the camera while playing at being an ungainly and unconvincing fairy Godmother.\n\nDitto Shilpa. Her excruciating ordeal at the police station again makes it clear that she is being punished for her ‘transgressions’ and selfishness for abandoning the sweet wife and precious son. Then there is the ‘confession’ where Arputham informs her that there can be no forgiveness for the likes of her and the nature of her crime is so appalling and grotesque the audience has no choice but to agree. Cut to an abrupt and absurd happy ending which is really hard to buy unlike her violation. Even when Shilpa blows up like a volcano she is less an avenging Goddess and more of a much loathed, current jailbird who launched a thousand memes with her ‘saabam’ at a beloved leader’s samadhi.\n\nDitto Leela… Sure she gets some superb lines pertaining to teddy bears, Goddesses and whores but she does not escape her ‘wrongdoing’ either. Her son calls her a whore and tries to off her. Even worse, she lives in a hovel with barely a buck to her name let alone the funds needed to save her son. But why worry when the faux tooth fairy is just around the corner?\n\nAnd BR, we can split hairs all we want about tonal, functional differences but sermonizing/summing up is irritating whether it is Cheran, Samuthirakani or Kumararaja simply because it has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer driving home the message which you usually deplore.\n\nAs for the damn alien, it is just crap wrapped in arty, farty gauze. And yet, there was a farting corpse and so many such redemptive moments in the midst of the self – indulgent muck and pseudo intellectual jerking off. So yeah, I loved the movie every bit as much as I hated it.\n\nWalking out of the theatre I overheard a group of friends talking about the movie. One guy went “ Kadaisiya ennadhaanda solla varaaru?” and another replied “ Edhuvume thappu kedayaadhaan da”.\n\nWhich is not far away from a direct quote from the end of the movie. When filmmakers make such vague claims about questions that have daunted us since our inception, like existence of morality, it’s hard not to call them preachy.\n\nI’m all for artists exploring the big questions. Vikram vedha did it really well in my opinion. It managed to shake our moral code by placing us in a gangster’s shoe. And it also left the question open for audience to ponder.\n\nEven films that push this idea to the extreme like Kim ki duk’s human time space and human and lars Von trier’s House that jack built (Just picking examples from last year), don’t make any concrete claims. They take the audience to the darkest places and leave us there to figure out for ourselves.\n\nBut in this case, the filmmaker does not even push the idea far. I mean none of it’s lead characters even actually “pottu thallify” anybody. Everybody is happy at the end and the only conventionally bad guy in the film dies. To name this film “Aneedhi kadhaigal” would have been absurd. It would have been based on the assumption that being an adulterer or a transgender person or a porn actor by itself is considered immoral. At a time when a culturally conservative country like India accepts sunny leone as a mainstream actress and casual sex is pop culture, I don’t think he’s pushing people into a moral dilemma. And then to go on a conclude the movie with claims about morality just seems desperate.\n\nI love the direction Tamil filmmakers are headed. It’s refreshing to see so much new content. But we do need to help them stay on track and not become too over the top.\n\nSuper Deluxe was clearly a mixed experience for me; part great, part underwhelming. Don’t know whether I have a solid answer yet. But on the internet, this film is being portrayed as the best film in tamil cinema. So I will quietly drop some of the issues that marred my viewing experiences. This doesn’t denounce the laurels the movie is receiving. I agree with most of them.\n\nWhile watching Super Deluxe, amongst the countless thoughts swirling my head, one thought occupied my mind predominantly. It wasn’t the seamless performance of Vijay Sethupathi or that of Fahad Fazil. It wasn’t the demonic performance of Bagavathi Perumal, who makes me ponder through his no holds bar, yet subtle performance in this film, whether this is how Kamal would have performed Red Chitti in Enthiran. It wasn’t the wacky directions and unexpected/ unexplored characters the movie was showcasing. The question was more fundamental: it was about the pacing of the film.\n\nEvery scene in the film is painstakingly slow. By slow, what I mean is that after the crux of the information and emotion is conveyed, the scene goes on and on. The worst one was Myskkin’s stoned revelation scene. Is it fear or apprehension which led TK to decide this pace for the movie? For unknown reasons (at least unknown to me), a marvellous debut by TK didn’t mint gold at the box-office. Did TK think the pace of narration in Aranya Kandam was the culprit? We may never know. But I am shocked to see that his indulgences to extract the last drop of nectar from each scene has led to this outcome in Super Deluxe. As an outsider, if I was shown individual scenes from this film, I would have been glob struck by the depth of work. But as a complete film, I can’t say the same. That’s because of how we subconsciously consume content. In short, it has to do with the theory of relativity. If we are watching only a scene, our mind is tuned to expect the end pretty soon. Hence, the indulgences in showcasing the emotions through body language and creating multiple points of focus will look mouthwatering for a cinema connoisseur. But if that same strategy is used for a 3hrs film, it becomes restless. Game of Thrones which has the same pacing issue smartly solved this age-old problem by ending on a high in most of the episodes. Thus the satisfaction overrides the snail-paced screenplay. Here, the climatic wacky idea (Nalan Kumarasamy) doesn’t translate well on screen to deliver that expected high. Incidentally, another Nalan Kumarasamy screenplay (Mayavan) faced the same problem. Could it be that the only person who could direct a Nalan’s screenplay is Nalan? If you think otherwise, I urge you to look at Nalan’s short film, Thurumbilum Errupar to understand why he was brought in to writing this portion and what Nalan is capable of.\n\nThis reminds me of another problem with the movie: it spoon feeds many of the twists. Again, the stoned revelation by Mysskin and that which happens to the boy needed better filmmaking and certainly fewer dialogues. When Mysskin utters, ‘do you know what happened the other day’ to narrate a flashback, I facepalmed at the tackiness of the narrative. It felt as if the director got into the characters’ body to explain to us why things are going bizarre. Sorry, TK you don’t have to breathe in our ears. We are perfectly capable of understanding your ideas.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, the weakest ones are allocated for Fahad & Samantha during their car journey. The motive behind the last journey (pun intended) was to create an arc where two people understand each other when placed in an extraordinary situation. Unfortunately, this romantic idea becomes a cliché since lines are aimed at completing arc and not to speak the mind of the characters. It also reminded me of the ineffective climatic car journey in OK Kanmani which suffered from the same problem. There is another reason for saying the dialogues during the car journey are the weakest in the film. It’s because the couple also gets the best dialogues of the film when they are in their home. The theatre went down in laughter and claps for every quibble of Fahad’s. The icing on the cake was Fahad’s explanation as to why he speaks about the system when angry. For a director who is so astute in perfecting the periphery, I was surprised he went for cliché in the core arc of the couple. The religious angle too suffers due to the same problem, especially if one is exposed to a healthy dose of Kamal’s filmography.\n\nOn the whole, while I was underwhelmed keeping Aranya Kandam as a benchmark, by other Tamil directors’ standards, Super Deluxe is certainly a class above.\n\nI didn’t have a problem with the tonality of the film – it was quite impressive and the spillovers from one storyline to another was absorbing. But except for a couple of scenes (including the one you mention where that boy was consumed with rage – the whole sequence was beautifully shot), this film is horribly staged.\n\nthe writing is so over-the-top, bungling, clumsy, amateurish, and just incompetent.\n\nOf course, you are free to call this film “unique,” “insanely detailed,” “blessedly amoral,” that is “as epic as it is intimate.”\n\nBut do realize that using such terms to describe a cultural product in a film/literary milieu that had produced works ranging from Iruvar to Pudhupettai to Onayum Aatukuttiyum to Visaaranai (in the case of films) or from G.Nagarajan’s “Naalay Matroru Naalae”, Aadhavan’s “Kaagidha Malargal,” Asokamitran’s 18th parallel to the more recent Pa. Venkatesan’s “Bhagirathiyin Madhiyam” is an unfortunate insult made out of sheer ignorance about the multi-layered writing and literary achievements made within TN over the past three decades.\n\nThis pseudo-philosophical rambling-BS of a film is what you’d call “blessedly amoral,” that is “as epic as it is intimate,” then I just can’t help but wonder if Indian film critics should be forced to undergo an elaborate remedial education on literature and aesthetic sensibility. Pauline Kael had that sensibility, so did Alexander Mackendrick. And even Roger Ebert did\n\nfor e.g. his review of La meglio gioventù https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-best-of-youth-2005\n\nThey understood that film language & grammar is different from literary style & grammar, but they were also well aware that underlying both these art forms is a more fundamental aesthetic sensibility – and therefore, they didn’t mask their ignorance through inane statements such as “film is different from literature etc etc.” They slogged their ass off and read more literature, went to multiple galleries, and developed their own aesthetic sensibilities – not just through watching a gazillion films with no other points of reference.\n\nTherefore, their reviews did not sound like some self-referential circus, where only prior films are used to make sense of/evaluate a current film. Instead, their scale and writing was a lot more nuanced and grounded in the broader art/literary history – a far complex tapestry that was sublime and a joy to read. But more than that, such reviews showed some respect and awareness about the historical achievements – both literature and filmmaking – of a milieu – something that is lacking in tamil/indian film criticism.\n\nSo BR-please, you are writing about tamil films, so do make an attempt to read more (or at least learn second-hand) about tamil literature (beyond Sujatha). You’ll then perhaps understand the fundamental flaw in the writing of this film.\n\nSaw a post on FB in Tamil. Sharing the link here . Heavy spoiler alert!\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2260070740680696&id=100000333770088\n\nMy translation of the post in the above link\n\nThe tiger, snake and the bottomless pit mentioned in the trailer are nothing but the unnecessary constraints/norms created by us the humans.If you care a damn about these, then life is akin to tasting the drop of honey is what SUPER DELUXE is in a nutshell. If you remove the societal construed norms from all the four tracks of the film, there is no actual crisis in any of them. Only when the characters try to overcome or deal with the imaginary crises do they give rise to actual problems.\n\nVembu/Samantha (who is now married to Mugil/ Fahadh) has sex with her boyfriend from college days and the guy ends up dead during the ‘act’. That this was not a murder could have been easily proved through a post mortem. What prevents them from taking this straight route is the fear of society and in trying to cover up it only puts Vembu in a situation where she is being forced to have non-consensual sex (bordering on rape) with a blackmailing stranger. How is this in anyway better than your neighbours commenting that you slept outside marriage?\n\nThe problem with Arputham/Mysskin is that he creates a belief system for himself based on an event that happened to him long ago and holds on to it tightly without any rationale. I have a personal experience on these lines. My father attempted suicide after a series of failures and was saved by a priest. My father converted to Christianity 15 years back but his problems have not ended. But when questioned now he says that these are God’s ways of testing his trust on HIM. He would often get out from the house saying that ‘Satan’ resides there. For my mother her religion is very important. Both my parents cannot digest the fact that their partner follows a different faith. Even after 15 years this problem continues. Both have lost their peace in giving importance to something that should actually mean nothing. I married a christian girl 10 years ago and we haven’t had any conflicts with respect to religion between us because we care a damn for it. Life is honey for us.\n\nIn the Manikam/Shilpa(Vijay Sethupathy) track the last scene is the solution. In hindsight there was no problem in the first place for a solution to be identified. The only thing that the child wanted was that his father should ring the door bell and he should come out and hug him/her. The gender of his father is immaterial to him. This should have happened naturally in the beginning itself. But why isn’t it happening? Why do people give more importance to norms than what is right?\n\nAs Leela/Ramya Krishnan says, “For 4 lakh consumers to view porn there need to be 4 persons to act in it”. Who are the ones that need to be ashamed? Or is there anything here to be ashamed at all?\n\nWhat is the actual problem?\n\nRELIGION is UNNECESSARY\n\nThe norms bestowed upon WOMEN in the name of PURITY are UNNECESSARY\n\nThe general attitude of looking at the THIRD GENDER DIFFERENTLY is UNNECESSARY\n\nThere are numerous other UNNECESSARIES in this world that we keep fighting for and lose our PEACE.\n\nLIFE keeps dropping HONEY on us. It is left to us if we want to taste it or keep fighting for irrelevant things\n\nI noticed how the movie deliberately tries to break the conventions of how people think. The film does this on several levels. Here are a few examples I could recollect.\n\nBreaking the cinematic conventions (Clichés)\n\nThe entire Berlin in the warehouse scene is an elaborate exercise in showcasing this. First deliberately showing Berlin’s gun placed on scooter, then asking Vaembu to handcuff Mugil so we expect some sort of cheating, and then the bottle behind Vaembu which Berlin even calls out. It’s all there for us to think of a conventional twist only to be blown away by the actual twist.\n\nIt also happens in earlier scenes like when Leela is shown pulling the screw driver out from son’s stomach. Usually leads to Leela being framed for murder. But it is immediately broken.\n\nWhen the dead body in the bed slips from their hands, we expect some sort of disaster but we get the most fun rendition of Star Wars theme.\n\nBreaking character conventions (Stereotypes)\n\nVaembu hides the body seeing Mugil coming home. So we expect a dishonest wife. But she immediately confesses.\n\nWhen Shilpa shows up, we’d expect the conflict to be within the family. But wife and son turn out to be non judgemental.\n\nIn the hospital we would expect Leela to offer her body to save son at some point. She does. But not sexually.\n\nBreaking social conventions\n\nThe entire plot. The way people think about adultery, transgender people, religion and porn.\n\nThe alien showing up at the end even talks about the convention it is breaking.\n\nThis is just one layer of the film. I guess there’s many more.\n\nLike @Manikandan V and @Akash Balakrishnan had mentioned above, there is some sort of meta layer. The Gaaji character is a strange one. He never complains. He is accepting and clear headed no matter what goes on around him. His statement “Yes naan already indha padam paathutten” could refer to Super Deluxe or even life itself. Like he is a person who has already lived a full life and has taken rebirth to experience it again. Hence, no complains.\n\nMORE SPOILERSSS (These are good!!!)\n\nSaw it for the second time today. Unlike earlier spots, in the flea market with “Sinthanai Sirpi Singaperumai” Kanneer Anjali posters, the words MAGIC EVENT can be found on the corner those walls. After shilpa goes away from us to look for her son and return to the same point, the words “REAL LIFE” surreally appear over MAGIC EVENT as she crosses it 😀 WATCH! IT’S INCREDIBLE HOW MUCH HE TOYS WITH US.\n\nAlso the same market has a RED board that says “Asuthham Seibavargal Dhandikkapaduvargal” with the dhandanai part broken/destroyed. And so he clearly doesn’t agree with that moral centre and neither does this film, which keeps growing 😀\n\nI also found Arpudham’s prayers and the warehouse scene rather perfectly paced this time around, now that you know what happens plotwise. I believe both scenes do require that kind of breathing space before Shilpa and Arpudham’s worlds meeting and the tv curse with Berlin.\n\nThey put YOU the viewerr in an uncomfortable space the way the characters are at that moment, before Vaembu’s and Arputham’s respective breaking points. I found that bit of exhaustion incredibly effective!\n\nAlso the Title (in its exact font) appears in many forms – Vaembu’s neighbour’s screen saver, The blue icecream cart, the ice cream AD in the theatre screening ManushyaPuthran’s film (with the tagline LIFE IS SUPER DELUXE – Kadaisi Thuli Varai something) How cheeky was his wink after that monologue? 😀 (Makes a WORLD of difference) and the gigantic neon light over the settu alien’s terrace, which I’m guessing stands for the ice cream brand as well.\n\nAnd both Rasukutty and Surya’s friend (Mohan?) get to enjoy the orange ice-cream at the end, unlike Kodukapuli who had to drop it, before running after his dad in Aaranya Kaandam 😉\n\nSo, to one set of an audience, the title’s just an ice cream brand, like how cinema is just a product and to us, I think it is all-encompassing and in various sizes/forms depending on where you choose to look and in it’s multifold pleasures like cinema, it’s life itself 🙂\n\nSpoiler alert!\n\nSaw the movie yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had an issue with the messages, but more on it towards the end. First off, I, personally, could not see the main characters(Shilpa, Vaembu, Leela and the boys) around whom the stories happen as amoral people. Maybe w.r.t “conventional tamizh cinema”, they are, but seeing them as characters in a story, real or imaginary, I wouldn’t call them amoral. I see them either as people with moral values who commit mistakes at a particular point in their lives and later repent(Shilpa, Vaembu) or people who are victims of circumstance(the boys and Leela). I think calling Vaembu’s act as simply cheating on her husband is a bit too harsh. I don’t fully justify her act, but then again it’s not fully unjustified either. She is forcefully thrust into an arranged marriage when she loves another guy, and she finds out after some time that her lover is depressed. She feels guilty and that prompts her to call him over and they end up making love before he dies. This sequence of events makes all the difference between simple adultery and what Vaembu actually does. That Vaembu is not amoral is very much visible in the warehouse, where she squirms as if surrounded by worms, when cornered by Berlin into providing sexual favours.\n\nManickam gives more importance to his own feelings over that of his wife and son, flees to Mumbai and ends up being the reason(unknowingly) for two boys getting maimed and converted to beggars. Comes back home as Shilpa. That Shilpa is not amoral comes about when(already guilt-ridden on seeing the boys as maimed beggars), she loses her son and, naturally imagining a similar fate for him, begs for forgiveness.\n\nIn Leela’s case, its not as much a question of morality as a question of being practical. As she herself says, when there are lakhs of people asking for porn, there obviously has to be four or five people doing it. Isn’t the morality of a person questioning the same in only the people making porn itself questionable? Leela comes across as a very practical and level-headed person as opposed to her husband who is an unreasonable crackpot! If Arputham’s thoughts on religion and God are indeed a reflection of general public thoughts on the same(I don’t think so!), then no God can help us!\n\nAnd the boys steal only to escape from being reprimanded for breaking a television set. Like Vaembu, their act is not completely unjustified. The only truly amoral, evil person in this film is the SI Berlin. The only compassion he shows is towards a centipede, if you can call that compassion as opposed to being averse about a squashed insect in the police station.\n\nWhich brings me to the messages at the end. I did not find the messages to be preachy, and, while I would never compare them to Cheran’s and Samudrakani’s rants, I did have a slight bother. Given that I see the characters as moral, I was able to see their happy endings ALSO as providence rather than just as random chance. I mean there are two interpretations equally possible, and the messages(partly) rudely intervene into my imagination and start dictating how I should interpret the stories/ endings. If TK had shown Berlin succeed in his scheme in the end, ideally by having the tv set just miss his head, then I would have bought into his messages about chance. And by providence, I don’t mean simply a judgemental entity sitting up there deciding things. That is Arputham’s viewpoint that is, IMO, rightly debunked by Leela. It could very well be much more complicated than that. Given that we, even today, don’t have a complete understanding of an everyday phenomenon as Gravity, how can we hope to have a clear picture on the universe and it’s workings? To be honest, the real world always keeps me confused and searching, whereas the universe of Super Deluxe allows me to root for providence.\n\nLAST ROUND OF SPOILERS/EASTER EGGS (stick with me):\n\nThe porn actor walking upstairs in Mallu Uncut is Vaembu’s LOVER. He’s holding the key as he walks upstairs in silhouette!! And the same key is hanging on his car that Sam and Fahadh drive. It’s also on the poster of the porno. And on the official poster of super deluxe 🙂 And And! You can find it hanging in Aaranya kaandam’s car 🙂 He’s also in the flea market (with Shilpa searching) asking for more time to fix his loans. The disclaimer before Mallu Uncut says “idhu oru thanimanidha uzhaippu” and asks for donations, too. So that explains his predicament.\n\nIt certainly explains Vaembu and Leela (Ramya Krishnan) sharing a look at the end.\n\nThe alien foreshadowing also harks back to the video game in Aaranya Kaandam where Subbu says “Indha game la Vara maari nambalum Vera ulaguthukku pona nalla irukum” la? And Jackie Shroff mentions a “settu” in the beginning whom we never see in either film, but it’s possibly this one.\n\nAlso the alien-duality thing rings true. The porno the boys watch has a CD cover with Senthamarai written twice – the alien has two doors with – you guessed it – blooming flowers, and two of everything – furry chairs, large symmetrical windows on either side of the long mirror and two wallets. She has another set of her blue dress hanging right there!\n\nGaaji’s tale even says that he came to town with Two URGA JAADIS! The plastic bags must be multiple cloning trials and errors, as the fat guy with her is busy examining all of them. Infact if there’s one cat in her house, the other one should be with the gangsters, which is why we hear the meowing offscreen 🙂\n\nFinally, the guy Berlin talks to at the warehouse over the phone (some video in a “little boys” WhatsApp group which sounds just as scary/horrendous) – Maiyilvaaganam is likely the corrupt cop from Aaranya Kaandam 🙂\n\n^and the inverted t-shirt after censoring reads “BUCK” but that’s how the kid in the Fahad story pronounces it! 😀 hopefully this answers all your questions. Thanks for reading!\n\nA contradiction exists at least when it comes to philosophy?\n\nInconsistencies in writing like Aliens exist but god doesn’t? Mocking theism and elevating fantasy (alien) and luck by chance, both the fallacy of mind? This movie seems like creative writing for an award – “A rationalist fantasy”- “Christian Science”\n\nThere is someone above us who watches everything, but it ain’t “God”, it is an Alien with the ability to sermonize and mock a commoner. God is attributable to the associative schema of our psyche but Aliens form an integral part of his muse consolidating and psychoanalyzing human misgivings? or Is it a desperate attempt at a sermon to humans by someone beyond them as humans don’t give a crap about one another?. In the eyes of a rationalist, a believer cannot refute the theories of an alien?.\n\nThe child understands “test tube baby” but does not have a problem with Trans-dad being laughed at by his fellow mates. I understand the part of happy with dad. But It is more of a sculpted lesson of a mature person empathizing a transgender using the ill portrayed innocence of a child who seems to know a bit too much and is a tad little too mature for his age. Or maybe that’s innocence. That’s a Ding dong for me.\n\nHis movies showcase the desperation of men, Mugil still craves for her attention maybe he loves her after all ain’t he, despite all that has passed. He is psycho shamed for suggesting a way out. What would indicate Chivalry is for Mugil to have laid down his life defending her “honour” but that was not written to pamper Tamil pride. Guess Idhuvum kadandhu pogum\n\nThe threads still show, the stitches of fantasy – the television, the diamonds from Tsunami Andavar, the cash from an alien – with four writers collaborating was there a need for the connections to be this absurd?\n\nIf its my ignorance talking – Forgive me in the name of “God”\n\nThe innocence carried by his characters in his movies ❤ Innocence is pure ,it makes you forget all the shady things in the world .\n\nFor me Kumararaja is Raaskutty , who still believes world is one and the same for everyone . Innocence respects everyone and expects the same from everyone.\n\nFor me Kumararaja is Vembu , who accepts what she has done and feels nothing wrong about it . She is not begging anyone for forgiveness . Innocence gives you the guts to accept things as it is and make no fuss about it .\n\nFor me Kumararaja is those 4 school going adults , who still have their innocence safeguarded in them from the society . Society kills it ofcourse.\n\nFor me Kumararaja is Arpudham (aka) dhanasekar , who fights within himself to find the truth about God and the miracles . He even calls God “Alpam”. Innocence searches for truth .\n\nFor me Kumararaja is Leela, who says ” people can have their own opinions about me ,but I am what I am . I don’t feel guilty for anything “. Innocent conscience fears nothing.\n\nFor me Kumararaja is Mukil , who questions the system and criticizes mob mentality . Innocence always questions .\n\nFor me Kumararaja is Shilpa, who explains to her kid about her situation . She is not complaining about God for creating her like this , instead she forgives him/her and says that it’s an human error like sometimes how we used to wear “right” slipper for left foot and vice versa . Life is not all about left and right . It’s sometimes right being left 😅 . Innocence forgives people .\n\n“For me Super deluxe is all about Innocence “. Innocence has its own charm , so do Kumararaja 😘\n\nFor me “A Thiyagarajan Kumararaja film” means a kid with his innocent smile saying **** *** 😁\n\nIf you admire something,you have the innocence in you . Keep admiring things , there is nothing wrong in being innocent.\n\nStill not able to come out of this hangover man .\n\nNote: People often confuse Innocence with Ignorance. Innocence is questioning to know something , ignorance is answering without knowing something. You can be an innocent ,but make sure you are not becoming an ignorant.\n\nHey BR, really thanks to you for having this platform for all cinema buffs to discuss, debate and dissect cinema and the philosophy behind it. Yes…I am the same person from Mumbai who hasn’t watched a single Tamil video, forget a movie, and was clueless about people like TK & VJS, until a 4 weeks back. And yes, I have been regularly reading your this blog since around 5 years now and this is my just second comment here. the first one being the one I wrote few days ago on this movie.\n\nOk, so coming to the point now 🙂 I watched Super Deluxe 1st Day last Show and liked it, though not loved it. And since then until yesterday, I have been devouring all the reviews, comments, ASK BR video, IMDB reviews, etc. That is when I realised that I missed out on few intricacies and few scenes altogether. Then, it suddenly struck me that since I have zero knowledge of Tamil language. all along the movie, I was mostly engrossed in reading the subtitles and hence couldn’t really imbibe each and every scene. So, yesterday again I watched this movie in Cinepolis, last show. And yes, this time, I liked the movie more than I had the 1st time. Still, somehow I cannot really say that I loved the movie, TBH.\n\nMay be, may be….I got swayed by yours and others’ reviews and had very high expectations and so now feeling slightly disappointed. May be I should have read your review as ‘This is among the best movie in Tamil’ and not necessarily among the best movies in India. Nevertheless, the technical aspects of the film like cinematography (color pallette, framing), BGM, character arcs, acting, production values, broad themes are really good and have been already discussed and dissected here in this forum and hence won’t be able to contribute anything new from my side. However, one issue which I am not able to digest are few incongruities in few scenes and feel TK could have been slightly more honest as a director. Below are few of my observations and questions I have. Request BR and readers to pls help me to understand this movie better. (These are just few humble aspects and in no way meant to disrespect BR, TK or the readers. 🙂 I just intend to learn Cinema, more from a technical and artistic viewpoint)\n\nSamantha’s Boyfriend:\n\nIs he the porn actor in the movie along with Ramya. Few readers have pointed this out but I did not feel so, even when watching the movie second time.\n\nWhy is he visible during the scene when VJS searches for his son in the market area? Does his visibility in this scene anyway related to the storyline. If yes, how? If no, then does this indicate Director’s dishonesty in showing him just as an easter egg.\n\nMany have pointed out that the steel key hanging in the boyfriend’s vehicle is kind of key to the storyline. Even after 2nd watch, I could not really find anything as such. Then why did TK focus on it prominently during the scenes between Fahad & Samantha, and on the official movie poster\n\nVJS:\n\nTsunami occured in 2004 which VJS had witnessed firsthand that means VJS had by then left Chennai and his family. And he has come back after 7 years. That means, the current movie timeline is 2011. Did a middle class household in 2011 really have flat LCD/LED TVs (at the boy’s home, which was broken). Also the price of the TV is shown to be around 28k, which is almost 2017 year price. Am I missing something in the year timelines?\n\nAlso, Ramaswamy keeps on saying that 12 years back Dhanashekar went onto commit suicide in the sea. Assuming this is true, it means the timeline year in the movie is around 2017\n\nWhen VJS got out of the taxi, he was all beaming happily. Didn’t he anticipate that his wife, son and other family members would be shocked as hell, seeing him as a Transgender\n\nRamya:\n\nDoes the current technology allow to watch a 3D movie on a TV, forget on a cheap 30k priced TV? Ramya’s movie ‘Mallu Uncut’ would have released not later than 2004 (Tsunami Year). Were porn movies in India made using 3D technology in 2004?\n\nWhy does Ramya look at Samantha with a knowing glance, while she is walking with Fahad on the road,after disposing Berlin? If it was just a coincidence, then is TK right in putting that scene and thus putting audience in a dilemma, with no payoff.\n\nBerlin\n\nDoes any sub-inspector cadre officer come twice in 2-3 hours, just for passport verification? In any case, it is only a constable who generally comes for passport verification. Did TK take this liberty to show us how powerful (in the police station/abandoned factory) Berlin is? If he was a constable, the powerplay (between him & other constables and between him & Fahad-Samantha) and subsequent scene tensions, would not have happened. Is this a major flaw in the storyline, since lot of subsequent incidents happen because he is NOT JUST A contable.\n\nHow Berlin knew Samantha’s mobile number when he called for the 1st time when Fahad-Samantha are waiting at the railway tracks? How did Berlin know that the person sitting in the backseat is DEAD, since Berlin was around 100 metres away from the vehicle when he was recording them on his phone\n\nSamantha- Fahad\n\nWhy don’t they both just goto police station and surrender since the autopsy will anyway clearly reveal the death reason as heart attack? Why does Fahad take a huge risk on himself and his budding acting career by helping unfaithful Samantha in concealing the death\n\nAlien presence:\n\nThere was mention of alien in Aaranya Kandam, and shown in the posters behind the 3 boys and also playing on a TV near Gaaji. Just because of these aspects where aliens is just a blurry background, mean that the movie can completely take off onto a different tangent of Aliens. Was it really necessary to add the whole alien angle? Could the movie been as effective without aliens? Specially since the whole movie is meant to be a real-life like story/situations and then suddenly taking a alien/miracle route. The closest example I can think of is Nolan’s movie The Prestige. Many people argued that showing a miracle (teleportation) in a movie as a crucial plot pint when the whole movie otherwise is real life situations, was incorrect. However, you can still give the benefit of doubt to Nolan because the broad theme of the movie itself is about magic.\n\nBGM:\n\nIs BGM or actual sound of a nearby heavy machinery that plays in the police station?\n\nOverall, we can make out that the spatial location of the scenes is around 10 km radius if we carefully observe the time taken by characters to move from one location to another location and it seems all these locations are somewhere near to railway tracks..in fact even the houses of boys, Ramya and Fahad all look like railway quarters. Then, why do we hear the railway engine/horn sound only once in the beginning when Samantha cries seeing her boyfriend dead\n\nDoes Idi Amin have a cat at his home or is it just BGM? What is the cinematic significance in either case of having cat meow sounds while characters are speaking\n\nFew scenes:\n\nWhy is the aeroplane shown prominently in the movie? Does it have any relevance to the proceedings? Showing an aeroplane flying above, from exactly the same roof-hole from which the TV fell, is misleading and some audience felt that TV fell from the aeroplane. Is TK misleading the audience with no real motive?\n\nThe boys threw the TV down against a vertical wall whereas when the TV hits Berlin, he is standing in the centre of the factory with no vertical wall nearby at all. How did the TV then land on Berlin\n\nHow does Rasukutty know that VJS has taken a ticket to Bombay to go back permanently, due to which Rasukutty thought of absconding, which then leads VJS to the subway where he meets Aruputham and the story completely turns.\n\nIs showing all the 3 story characters (Rasukutty, 3 Boys and Ramya’s son’s friend in the Hospital eating ice-cream) in the last scenes adds any explicit value to the storyline\n\nThis all for now 🙂\n\nApologies for the extremely extremely long post but just wanted to learn and understand the movie better.\n\n“Isai: The ‘Tsunami Andavar’ track is a clear reference to Christianity. If you want to criticise ‘blind faith’ worship, you could have as easily done it without using what looks (and doesn’t look) like a Jesus statue and without using ‘Christian Tamil’ words.”\n\nWhy not Christianity? Max instances of faith healing.\n\n“Baldmonk & sai Ashwin – I had to talk out the chronological order of events in the movie with my wife to establish the timeline. I realized late y’day that it’s a movie happening over two days because of one of the major factors – Shilpa’s story doesn’t affect any if the other 3 stories except creating a doubt in Arputham’s mind about his self founded religion. In retrospect, all the 4 stories don’t intertwine with each other at all. 1 or 2 of the 4 stories merely graze against each other and that’s why I feel the movie would’ve been equally satisfying as an anthology with common plot threads. Would it have had the same impact – I don’t know.”\n\nAgreed! The stories intertwining did not work for me – 2 of the stories hardly did, in fact. The Arputham track was the most flabby, though I enjoyed Myskin’s acting very much – he’s a great presence on screen.\n\n“@BR , I also did not get why FAhad is helping Samantha in getting rid of the corpse when it is not a murder and also when Samantha is being honest about the episode. Especially when they are not in good terms , why would any guy want to put up with such a situation? He could have easily walked away. Is shame the only reason? Isn’t dealing with shame a lot easier than dealing with this ordeal?”\n\nDude, she’s still his wife! There’s so many complicated feelings there. You can’t just abandon your wife in her hour of need.\n\n@Bharath Vijayakumar: That summing up was great! That’s definitely one of the overarching meanings in the movie, apart from how everything from ants to aliens is one.\n\n“Tsunami occured in 2004 which VJS had witnessed firsthand that means VJS had by then left Chennai and his family. And he has come back after 7 years. That means, the current movie timeline is 2011. Did a middle class household in 2011 really have flat LCD/LED TVs (at the boy’s home, which was broken). Also the price of the TV is shown to be around 28k, which is almost 2017 year price. Am I missing something in the year timelines?”\n\n2011 is most deifintely NOT the timeline, because I saw posters about Edapaadi Plananisamy in one of the scenes where Shilpa is searching for her son. Timeline is 2016-17 for sure.\n\n@Paras: Very good questions. The hype for this movie is because it has many things (like a popular hero playing a transgender parent, heroine having an affair, nihilism, aliens, lots of easter eggs like Schrodinger’s cat etc.) which one would probably have not seen in Indian movies. I feel BR would have usually rated this movie as ‘Parts greater than the sum’ but something (perhaps nihilism?) seems to have struck an emotional chord with him.\n\n@paras,anon: When the movie starts, Samantha in a voice-over, asks her ex to come to her home, promising him that ‘I WILL make you happy’ while also mentioning that her husband won’t be there. (Why not invite him to a coffee shop?). She is encouraging him for a 2nd ride when she realises that he is dead. She later says that the sex happened in the spur of the moment due to guilt and that she was forcibly married to Fahad, who is a struggling actor (why??). She appears to have not told her husband about the forced marriage either before or after the marriage. But, we are told by reviewers that ‘this is not just an affair’ because…she says so. (Except that the scenes shown makes her statement look more like a lame excuse).\n\nWhat I don’t get is why don’t Samantha and Fahad clean up the man and tell police that he died of an heart attack. I don’t think his post mortem would reveal about the sex.\n\n@Anon: They don’t seem to have bonded at all. Fahad asks her for an immediate divorce post body disposal which shows that he is neither the ‘forgiving type’ nor has strong feelings for her.\n\nSo, a person like Fahad taking a huge risk for such a wife seems unrealistic to me. If he was caught after the train crushed the body, then he would be suspected of killing the ex after discovering the affair. Why take such a huge risk?\n\nWatched it for second time today and I still felt so thrilled towards the end. The movie delivered a lot during the second viewing. I could connect more dots.Few moments that stood in the second viewing:\n\n1) “Tasting the ice-cream” becomes a beautiful motif connecting all the three stories deeply. Loved the framing in that portion when the camera is behind the hospital bed ( teenagers story) and then it segues into the shilpa story and then moves to vaembu’s story. All of them ( except probably Vaembu and Mugil) have ice-cream (Super Deluxe one ofcourse) towards the end and their arcs are complete. They have transformed. From the teenage boys taking the ice-cream to the victoria theater screening “Vaazhkaiyin Ragasiyam” ( Directed by Karnan, couldn’t help but notice all the trivia this time) to Rasukutti asking Dad if they can have ice-cream and watch TV to the friend who took Ramya Krishnan’s son joking with him with an ice-cream.\n\n2) I could appreciate BR’s point about payoff better this time with the Shilpa scene in the subway.\n\n3) I loved the fact that Manushyaputhran thathuvam was beautifully interspersed with actual references of the thathuvam being played out in the protagonist lies.\n\n4) Immediately after the diamonds are revealed, we are taken to the saettu house and there is a radio broadcast ( before they meet the alien) regaling us with a story of a longlost mystery affair of some diamonds from Africa that were lost in Indian Ocean forever. Here is a director, giving so much effort to add more depth to the proceedings. My respect for TK grew many fold and I literally hooted like a rajini fan more joyously this time in the end.\n\n5) Ten tonne impact scenes ( courtesy BR) were very moving in the second viewing as well. I felt Berlin with his affable presence, made it somewhat softer. I didn’t fear for him so much.\n\n6) I liked thooyavan this time. It reminded me of my childhood days. I used to be like Thooyavan.\n\n7) Throughout the movie, almost every scene which had some reference to some name of the street and it was deliberately hidden, plastered with some poster. I could identify the road opposite the luz anjaneyar temple ( I am from Mylapore) when the three teen heads towards thooyavan house. However, there was a death obituary poster posted on that road plaque entrance as well. TK deliberately wanted to remove all spatial references and featured spaces ( Govt. colonies like Foreshore Estate and the likes) that are lost in time. What does that do to a movie like this? Is it his way of saying this kind of stories could happen anywhere, anytime?\n\nOne more unexplored easter eggs\n\n1) When the 3 teens get to watch the first porn movie featuring Ramya Krishnan, it starts offf with a long philosophical disclaimer with words like “அழகியல்” ( Aesthetics). I wished I could pause the movie at that moment and read through. Could anyone decipher that disclaimer?\n\nSaw the film yesterday & here I am to say Aagggaa – to the film, BR & the amazing commenters here.\n\nI havent watched #AskBR, so I could have missed some discussions, but some points I thought I could add (illa, to be honest, I want to say something here – and be part of this superb thread!)\n\nMugil goes to Koothupattarai for acting classes. Vijay Sethupathi is from Koothu Pattarai background (though he started as an acct there). If you notice, when his neighbor says “periya star aanaa nyabagam vechukunga”, Mugil says “Commmmedy pannadheenga sirrrr” which sounded like the slang which VJS speaks (and Mugil doesnt speak like that normally). And VJS is the star who constantly gives his opinions on Society, Injustice etc – and Mugil too takes off on such rants – often in inappropriate situations! Was TK playfully ribbing on VJS?\n\nThat Pookkari paati outside Rasukutti’s school – was she that infamous lady who appeared in both the ADMK & DMK propaganda video in 2016? If so, her words to VJS about social persecution make more sense. Same with Manushya Puthran (the matter doctor) who is a differently abled person – who had a traumatic life, but has turned out to be a successful media person now.\n\nJust two varuthams:\n\nAs anon says – Berlin should have hit on Mugil too – more explicitly. He should have handcuffed Vembu and instead taken on Mugil. TK has put a twist on so many things in the film – why not the traditional abuse scene too.\n\nAnd instead of Bugs, they could have had someone more charming, suave & conventionally handsome play the depraved SI. Say, Prithviraj (who aced as the villain in kana kanden). That would kinda put a twist on Vembu’s complaints on Mugil for not been suave.\n\n@Paras: Good dissection. Let me try to explain a few things which might have slipped your attention due to subtitle dependency.\n\na)) How does Rasukutty know that his father is going to fly back to Bombay? Rasukutty says, during his outburst, that he saw the travel ticket to Bombay in his dad’s purse when he was paying for his Paan. It was after this realization, did he leave his dad & go missing (deliberately!)\n\nb)) Timeline: There is a newspaper poster that shows Edappadi Palanisamy (our Chief Minister) who came to the forefront only after Feb 2017 i.e after Jayalalita’s demise in Dec 2016. Till then he was an unknown entity, atleast in Chennai. So it is definitely 2017-18. Tsunami happens in 2004 – at that time Shilpa/Manickam had also attempted suicide (probably knowing his orientation & embarrassed by it). Arputham also had a near death experience at that time – knowing his wife’s profession.\n\nHowever Leela is still in the same profession – and so Mallu Uncut is not a 2004 movie, but a recent one. Possibly shot in 3-D too 🙂\n\nRegarding the TV – the children dont go to any branded showroom, but to a flea market electronics shop & so the 3D set too could be got at 30k (an assembled Flying Monkey brand!)\n\nc)) Easter eggs: There are quite a few clever and subtle things placed in the film just to intrigue the viewers (i.e those who catch them). No explicit revelation are kept for them & to be honest, those explanations arent required at all. Take this: The nuisance guests who walk into Mugil Vembu’s house mention that “Balaji” also uses the same word (fuck) to swear. Now in just about one or two scenes later – we see Leela rush her injured son to a local doctor – and his name board reads Dr. Balaji. These things are just for the heck of it.\n\nThe Alien – this trick is similar to the Rabbit in Andhadhun (and the rabbit head on Ayushamn’s walking stick). It could be a figment of the boys’ imagination – remember they also bought booze in the beginning. So having taken the money from the Seth’s house there was no logical need for the alien, except to make us think. And you can notice Alien movie posters all over the place – so the boys could have watched that film as well & conjured up images. Or, like someone mentioned, as in Honeymoon travels – to put a spin on things, the alien is for real.\n\nd)) As for Mugil supporting Vembu, had the guests not been there – he would have probably burst out & walked her to the police. But there were people with them & the neighbour too had nice words to say about Mugil (that he would be a hero soon). So maybe he steps up to support her. Mugil says he likes Vembu to the corpse, but keeps taunting her too. The quirks of an arranged marriage where the couple doesnt have enough reasons to separate & fewer to stay together. In the end too, they are shown being just cordial & not romantic yet.\n\n4)) Leela giving a glance at Vembu – I thought it was just a glance & not a knowing glance. Or as someone said, the key could have been Mugil’s and Mugil was the porn star who is shown to be twirling a key. He even wears a cap to cover his high forehead in the Mallu uncut scene (maybe!)\n\n5)) Berlin is recently promoted. So that could explain his visit (as part of his original duty). Or Vembu’s picture could have lured him (or even Fahad’s – given his preferences). And he would have her number wont he? (The application could have been for Vembu and Mugil)\n\nI definitely have to watch this again! And again!\n\n@Isai: Two things:\n\nIn the beginning, they keep reiterating that Arpudham is not a Christian. As BR mentions, he has started a cult with his own holy-book. But yes, those are just distractions, for one could clearly see it is Christianity that they are alluding to. Plus Leela, in the end, says Dhanasekar became a Christian as he hugged an Aandavar idol, what would he have turned if it were a teddy bear. Yeah, but atleast they attempt to make it sound like a new belief system headed by Tsunami Andavar (like how they show Sidhdhar or some Baba in other films)\n\nSecondly, it is shown that Arpudham gains a windfall, thanks to his Idol. Even in our old Tamizh mythological films, God will test the Bhakta’s devotion & only when he is about to snap or has snapped, would He intervene. So to a believer like me (of God), I see it as a reward for Arpudham’s single minded persistence. To an atheist, it might seem like an affirmation of his non belief. I feel that this is TK’s point – not to fret too much over these things. Plus, I dont know about audience elsewhere, but those in my theater did not let out even a chuckle when Arpudham prayed vociferously. (Unlike in Paradesi, where the preachers were made a caricature)\n\nWhich is why I dont mind Ulaganayagan’s anti-God rants. Because before coming to that portion, he would have definitely shown a lot of faith-reaffirming scenes (Dasavataram – how the vial goes into the idol & is kept safe, Anbe Sivam – the scenes with the Nun, Viswaroopam – the devout Muslim’s prayer & faith before embarking on his journey etc). His final customary naathigam, is just his signoff which I skip for the things depicted before (in Tamil very few mainstream movies these days show providence or divine intervention.)\n\n@V\n\nThanks for the exposition 🙂 Few scenes really makes sense to me now. There are still few inconsistencies in the timeline. VJS says that he was in Bombay when he escorted 2 kids to Kalyan railway station (which is 20 km away from Bombay) and then he realised his folly and out of guilt he wanted to commit suicide, for which he went to sea to drown himself. So, my question is why would he come all the way to a Tamil Nadu sea (and get struck by Tsunami) when Bombay also has a huge sea coast to drown 🙂 This is the 1st inconsistency with regard to timelines.\n\nSecondly, it means during the period of Tsunami (i.e the year 2004) he was already a eunuch in Bombay ( since he was ‘escorting’ 2 kids ) That means he left away his family around the year 2004. And since he has come back to him wife after 7-8 years, that means the movie timeline is year 2011-12.\n\nMy wild guess is that TK wanted to connect the 2 stories (Mysskin and VJS in the subway) desperately and somehow used Tsunami as a link. As a result of which, the timelines are inconsistent. Also, Rasukutty looks to be around 7-8 year old boy, which is consistent with the fact that VJS left the family after his birth, ie around 8 years back and if take the movie timeline as 2017-18 that means VJS left his home to Bombay in 2010. But then Tsunami didn’t happen in 2010\n\nComing to your suggestion that Ramya’s 3D porn movie is a recent one, I feel that cannot be, due to 4 reasons. First, after Mysskin tried to commit suicide in 2004 (after knowing her porn background), why would she still continue to act in porn movies and risk rift with husband. Secondly, her son who looks to be aged 14-15 years which means he would have been born around 2004-05 and after his birth I wonder if a woman would still act in porn movies. Thirdly, I feel looking at her home/locality and the way she struggles to arrange money in the Hospital shows that financially they are very poor, which means she left porn industry long back ie right after Mysskin suicide attempt and birth of her son. Lastly, in the prom movie she looks young around (30 years) whereas in the movie timeline she looks to be around 45 years.\n\nAbout the TV replacement, the boy whose TV was broken clearly says that his father will kill him if gets to know if this and hence I assumed they wanted to buy an exact replica and not a random assembled piece called Flying Monkey. I wonder if a lower middle class household in Chennai has a 3D home..Don’t know Just asking.\n\nHowever, your explanation of Berlin’s visit is bang on and is pretty convincing since now in hindsight I realise How arrogant and overconfident he was during the scenes.\n\n@RamG\n\nAbout your query 2:\n\nEven I introspected on this during my 2nd viewing. Not only does he wear a formal attire in his intro scene but also has a garland in his hands/neck. Stretching my imagination, I guess he has been called as a chief guest at some forum or may have been appreciated and honoured by his colleagues on his promotion. Also note that during the Mugil-Vaembu scene in the abandoned factory, he says that he has got a promotion recently and hence will not get any promotion for next few years..And this can also be the reason why he keeps on referring to himself as Officer Berlin, quite a few times. Thus, he has self-grandiose illusions about himself and hence he unabashedly abuses Shilpa in the police station and that too during day time\n\nAbout your query 3:\n\nThat was just TK’s way of inducing some fun moments in a tense situation and the same time keep us guessing (obviously with no pay-off as her count of boyfriends is immaterial to the story-line)\n\nSomeone has already pointed out how TK uses few visuals during the Vaembu-Mugil-Berlin scene at the end. Camera shows us a close-up shot of Berlin’s revolver when he places it on the bike. Similary, camera shows mid close-up when Vamebu is handcuffing Mugil so that we assume that she will slyly not cuff him. And then when Berlin asks Vaembu to stand near the bottle, we intend to think that she will pick up the bottle, break it and harm him. I think these are all TK’s genius masterstrokes which enhance the taste of this super yummy dish called Super Deluxe\n\nI finally got around to watching this Super Long movie on Netflix and absolutely loved every minute of it. I had to adjust the screen for colour saturation after the first 2 minutes and then could enjoy the roller coaster ride. This direction in Tamil cinema is so exhilarating, like Aruvi or Peranbu, it goes in daring magical and absurd directions, just trusting the audience to abandon themselves to the experience. A little more trust would have made for less exposition but even that was done in a fun way.\n\nThe comments above on this excellent review are almost as amazing and brilliant as the movie itself. The timeline nitpicking aside; that part sort of just fell into place for me. So many new insights.\n\nAshwanth Ashokkumar as Rasukutty, the little boy was the star of the show, so innocent and heartbreaking. His mother got the least characterisation and felt really conventionally written, so I wonder why so much praise for her acting, she is just looking on from the sidelines.\n\nI do agree that the other women’s punishments felt all too real but that is what really happens, right? It did not upset the tonal balance for me. The alien appearance did not bother me either, but by then I was just into total acceptance of everything being thrown on the screen. I remember with the alien appearance in Spielberg ‘s AI (another super long one, filled with similar themes) throwing my hands up saying wtf but now a couple decades later I’m just okay cool, aliens are people too.\n\nHave to make time to watch again, really looking forward to it."
