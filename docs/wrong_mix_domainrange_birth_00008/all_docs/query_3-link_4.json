He has acted in more than 400 films in Malayalam and other languages including Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, English and Kannada films. He has starred in both art house and blockbuster films.\n\nIn 1971, he made his onscreen debut as an extra in K. S. Sethumadhavan's Anubhavangal Paalichakal while studying law in Maharaja's College, Ernakulam. After his debut, he appeared in an uncredited role in Kaalachakram (1973).[1] In 1979, while he was practising law in Manjeri he was offered a pivotal role in M. T. Vasudevan Nair's Devalokam.[1] However, this film was never released.[2]\n\nIn 1980, Mammootty landed his first credited role in the film Vilkkanundu Swapnangal.[3] He continued to act in minor roles in several films such as Mela (1980) and Sphodanam (1981). His first film as an independent lead actor came with I. V. Sasi's Thrishna.[4] Following that, he starred in lead and supporting roles. His role as Vasu in I. V. Sasi's Ahimsa (1981) won him the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor.[5] His breakthrough in Malayalam cinema came with P. G. Vishwambharan's Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu (1983).[6] Between 1984 and 2000, he won six Filmfare Awards including two consecutive wins for the Best Actor (Malayalam). Mammootty turned producer for Adiyozhukkukal (1984), in which he played the lead role of a fisherman back from jail.[7] The film was produced under the Casino Films banner.[8]\n\nMammootty debuted in Tamil cinema with Mounam Sammadham (1989).[9] He made his Telugu film debut with Swathi Kiranam (1992). He made his Bollywood debut in the same year with Dhartiputra.[10]\n\nHe won 3 National Film Awards for Best Actor, 9 Kerala State Film Awards, 11 Kerala Film Critics Awards and 13 Filmfare Awards South.[11] His 2010 film Kutty Srank won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film, while his 2006 film Karutha Pakshikal won the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.[11] In 1998, the government of India honoured him with its fourth highest civilian award, Padma Shri for his contribution to Indian cinema.[12] He was conferred with the Doctor of Letters degree by the University of Calicut and the University of Kerala in 2010.[13] In 2005, Asianet called him \"The greatest method actor to grace Indian cinema.\"[14]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nList of Malayalam film credits Year Title Role Notes Ref. 1971 Anubhavangal Paalichakal Background crowd Uncredited [15] 1973 Kaalachakram Boatman Uncredited [16] 1980 Vilkkanundu Swapnangal Madhavan Kutty [17][18] Mela Vijayan [19] 1981 Sphodanam Thankappan [4] Munnettam Rajappan [20] Thrishna Krishna Das [4] Oothikachiya Ponnu Thoman Kutty [21] Ahimsa Vasu Won Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor [5][22][23] 1982 Yavanika Jacob Eerally [4] Vidhichathum Kothichathum Vasu [24][25] Veedu Rajasekhara Menon [26][25] Thadaakam Jabbar [23] Sindoora Sandhyakku Mounam Bitpart [27][25] Saravarsham Rajashekharan [28][25] Post Mortem Johny [29][25] Pooviriyum Pulari Ramesh [30][25] Ponnum Poovum Salim [31][25] Padayottam Kammaran First film with Mohanlal [32][33] Oru Thira Pinneyum Thira Jayadevan [34][25] Komaram Babu [35] Keni Babu [36][25] John Jaffer Janardhanan Janardhanan [37][25] Idiyum Minnalum Prabhakaran [38][25] Enthino Pookunna Pookal Sivaraman [39][25] Ee Nadu Salim [23] Chiriyo Chiri Himself Guest appearance [40][25] Chambalkadu Beeran [41][25] Amrutha Geetham Suresh [42][25] Aa Divasam Balachandran [43][25] Balloon Muthukoya [44][25] Innallenkil Naale Rahim [45][25] 1983 Visa Sharif [46][25] Theeram Thedunna Thira Madhu [25] Sesham Kazhchayil Jagadish [47][25] Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu Jayamohan [48] Saagaram Shaantham Ananthan [49][25] Rugma Raghu [50][25] Rachana Gopi [51][25] Prathijnja Hamsa [52][25] Pinnilavu Unni [53][25] Oru Swakaryam Usman [54][25] Oru Mukham Pala Mukham Muralidhran Thambi [55][25] Oru Madapravinte Katha Balachandran [56][25] Onnu Chirikku Unnikrishnan [57] Nathi Muthal Nathi Vare Raju [58][25] Nanayam Raju [23] Marakkillorikkalum Man at the park (uncredited) Cameo [59][25] Manassoru Mahasamudram Venugopal [60][25] Maniyara Shameer [61][25] Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback Prem Sagar [62] Saagaram Santham Ananthan [63][25] Koodevide Captain Thomas [64] Kodunkattu Musthafa [65][25] Kinnaram Balachandran [66][25] Kattaruvi Vasu [67][25] Iniyenkilum Divakaran [68] Himavahini Gopi [69][25] Guru Dakshina John [70][25] Ente Katha Babu [citation needed] Coolie Kunchali [71] Changatham Tony Francis [72] Chakravalam Chuvannappol Vasu [73] Asthram Balu [74] America America Ramesh [75] Aadaminte Vaariyellu Jose [76] Aa Rathri Ravi [4] Eettillam Sivan [77] 1984 Vikatakavi Usman [78] Vetta Rathish [79] Veendum Chalikkunna Chakram Jose [80] Thirakkil Alppa Samayam Jose [81] Sandarbham Ravi [82] Sandyakkenthinu Sindhooram Raghunathan [83] Paavam Poornima Jayaraj [84] Oru Kochukatha Aarum Parayatha Katha Dr. Surendran [85] Onnum Mindatha Bharya Achuthan Nair [86] Onnanu Nammal Sethu [87] Manithali Zulfikar [88] Mangalam Nerunnu Babu [89] Lakshmana Rekha Sukumaran Nair [90] Koottinilamkili Krishnanunni [91] Kanamarayathu Roy Varghese [23] Ithiri Poove Chuvannapoove Balagopalan [92] Itha Innu Muthal Adv.
