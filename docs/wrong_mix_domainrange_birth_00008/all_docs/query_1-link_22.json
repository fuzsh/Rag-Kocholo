        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIf the city acknowledges a governing deity it is overwhelmingly Ganesha, so perhaps the Hindutva agenda should have been to rename the city Ganeshnagar.\n\nMUMBAI: Perhaps the most notable aspect of the decision by the UK newspaper The Independent to refer to Mumbai as Bombay again was realising how archaic the latter term now feels. Even when the political point being made by the paper’s Indian born editor, Amol Rajan, about not supporting the Hindutva activists who he says made the change, is understood, the old name still feels odd now. Mumbai has moved on. Bombay is still used these days only by those determinedly stuck in the past or for technical reasons, like in stories set in the period when the old name still applied, or by institutions like the Bombay High Court or Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) which, for multiple reasons, are finding it hard to change their name. Those living in city switch easily in conversation between Bombay and Mumbai, but increasingly it is Mumbai which Mumbaikars use. And few would think they were acquiescing in a Hindutva agenda by doing so. It’s true that Mumbai is seen to reference Mumba-devi, the folk goddess worshipped in one of the city’s oldest temples, but only a very small proportion of the devout in Mumbai have ever been to worship there, or particularly think of her in their prayers.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nIf the city acknowledges a governing deity it is overwhelmingly Ganesha, so perhaps the Hindutva agenda should have been to rename the city Ganeshnagar.\n\nMumbai was always the Marathi term for the city, and its imposition was muscle flexing by the nativist Maharashtrian Shiv Sena party after it finally came to power in the state in 1995. The Sena has unquestionably embraced hardline Hindutva politics, which is presumably where Mr.Rajan is coming from, but the mistake he makes is to assume it is just another Hindutva party, and that is certainly never going to be true of the Sena.\n\nThe Sena didn’t start off as a hardline Hindutva party, and in many small ways from its proud non-vegetarianism to its current turf battles with the BJP, it has staked out its difference.\n\nWhat really defined the party was its aggression which looked for targets to blame for the perceived marginalisation of Maharashtrians. In its prehistory, as part of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, where the father of the Sena’s founder Bal Thackeray was one of the leaders, the target was the Gujarati traders who opposed the bifurcation of Bombay Presidency to create the current state. When the Sena was launched in the 1960s, the main target was South Indians who were vilified for taking the clerical jobs that the party’s middle-class supporters felt should be their due.\n\nAnd when the party was seeking to build its working-class base, it was the Leftist trade unions that dominated the city’s mills. The Sena was once rebuked by the union leader SA Dange for having no ideology – to which Thackeray countered by asking what was the point of an ideology if it didn’t lead to power? Looking at the current state of the Left, it is a jibe that has only got stronger with the years.\n\nAs Thackeray know, this was reasoning made for a city built and sustained by a fundamental struggle to survive. The islands of Bombay/Mumbai had little deep history before the British, quite reluctantly, arrived to build the settlement. It was seen as a liability for Surat, where the real wealth lay, at the termination point of various trade routes. It was only with Surat’s decline, as its port silted up and its location embroiled it in the turmoil of the collapse of the Mughal Empire that shifted attention to the more defensible island with its deep water harbour. Even then Bombay’s success was by no means guaranteed, and depended on several lucky breaks that were smartly exploited by its traders, whether British, Indian, Arab, Persian or whoever else landed up and was willing to take a chance. From wars in China that required opium or in the USA, which raised demand for cotton (both sourced from the fields of Central India) or the endless British conflicts in Arabia and Africa which could be lucratively supplied from Bombay, anything that could be exploited by the city’s businessmen was.\n\nBombay was quite different from Calcutta, for example, whose position as the headquarters for the British Raj in India, and agricultural wealth derived from plantations (indigo, tea) created a far less entrepreneurial climate. Bombay’s survival instinct was built into its soil, with the reclamation schemes that joined the islands into the peninsula that was the modern city, and whose stock issue helped fuel the hectic trading on the BSE.\n\nThe city values survival far above things like tradition or established structures. This can have its drawbacks, for example, in the way it has never managed to adopt a development plan that builds logically on its existing structure, instead going for various quick fixes, like the flyovers that keep erupting and which only really shift traffic chaos to different points.\n\nBut it did mean that when the renaming to Mumbai happened, many commentators mourned and wrote impassioned pieces, but the city as a whole just shrugged and moved on.\n\nIt helped that the 1990s also marked a profound shift in Mumbai’s geography. The closure of the mills and the development of the milllands, while chaotically and unfairly managed like most things in the city, decreased the importance of the Southern end of the city, the part most people thought of as ‘Bombay’. This was also the era when large residential developments in suburbs like Powai and Ghatkopar in the East and Goregaon and Malad in the West came to fruition, creating a continuous stretch of dense development that connected with the satellite cities of Thane and Navi Mumbai. Today this is where most of Mumbai actually lives, and even works, as iconic Mumbai companies like Hindustan Lever, Colgate, all the ad agencies, have moved to, alongside entirely new businesses like call centres and technology companies. Bollywood was, in any case, always located in the suburbs because of the studios and it has now been supplemented by the TV industry that both physically and mentally was always located in the suburbs. Bollywood still occasionally shows South Mumbai, but TV serials, even when set in Mumbai, never do.\n\nThis trend has only accelerated. The city’s main foreign consulates now have offices in the Bandra Kurla complex, removing one important reason to go to South Mumbai. BSE’s Fort location matters little in an era of online trading. Suburban hospitals like Kokilaben Ambani challenge the South Mumbai stalwarts like Breach Candy and Jaslok.\n\nThe High Court and the state government offices are in South Mumbai, but who goes there unless they absolutely must? Suburban multiplexes are packed with South Mumbai’s single-screen cinemas are struggling.\n\nThe same is true for South Mumbai restaurants – except those smart enough to open suburban operations. Cricket matches increasingly happen in Nerul’s expansive D.Y.Patil stadium rather than in crowded in Wankhede.\n\nAll this has made it easier to draw a line below Bombay. For those who live here, that is the city of the past, when neighbourhoods like Colaba were the only place to hang out in, rather than the Paharganj like place, best left to backpackers, which is what it is today The city is Mumbai now, looking to its north and east, embracing – purely for reasons of property prices – the hinterland that it always denied. And looking at the development creeping along the highways leading from the city it isn’t hard to imagine a future where the existing Mumbai Metropolitan Region becomes a mega urban conurbation of Mumbai-Pune-Nashik.\n\nBut while all this has happened, one essential part has not changed in the city. This is still a city made by and for survivors, from the strugglers of Bollywood to the start-up samurais of IIT to the dynamic denizens of Dharavi who have made what seems to be a slum into what is actually an ‘arrival city’, a place where outsiders land, not comfortably, but with a chance to make a foothold and move on to another place. The Independent’s Rajan tried to suggest that this was what defined the Bombay of the past and not the Mumbai of today, but he couldn’t be more wrong. He mistakes the tensions that will always arise when so many people are crammed together, but ignores the pragmatic way people deal with them and move on.\n\nBombay’s past openness and the chance it gave those willing to struggle in it remain in the Mumbai of today, and for those who are still ready to take that chance, it is what really matters, and not its name.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nIt took 42 years of grit and finesse to turn a 2-minute promise into an INR9,000 crore brand whose taste unites India\n\nWhat this Sebi proposal for discerning investors means for MFs and PMS\n\nEconomic Survey’s plan to drop food from inflation targeting is a bad idea\n\nDollar bear cycle may fuel emerging markets rally till 2029: Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nRBI sets stage for the first shift in monetary policy stance since April 2022\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
