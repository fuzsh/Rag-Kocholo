        "text": "Time was when there were no women in the Indian Army. It was from 1992 that women officers began to be recruited into the Army. Sajita Nair was one of the young women who joined the Short Service Commission in 1994. A few months ago, she published her first novel, She's a Jolly Good Fellow — little wonder it is about women in the Army.\n\n“It is not autobiographical, though some of my experiences are fictionalised in the book. I have also drawn from the experiences of my father, who served in the Indian Air Force, and my husband, who is in the Indian Navy,” Sajita told The Hindu on Saturday, a few hours before she read out excerpts from her book at a function in Kozhikode, where she was born.\n\n“Yesterday I had another interesting interactive session with the students of Providence Women's College where I did B.A..,” she said. “I am glad that I could have a reading session in Kozhikode, my hometown. Since my father has worked all over India, I have not lived much in Kerala. This time around I had an extended stay here as my son, Tejas Abraham, was playing the All-India chess tournament at Payyannur.”\n\nAbout She's a Jolly Good Fellow , published by Hachette India, Sajita says the book is not autobiographical. “It is about two women who joined the Indian Army — Deepa Shekhar and Anjali Sharma. While Deepa is a tomboy who does not want to take any advantage of the fact she is a woman, the more feminine Anjali's attitude is just the opposite,” Sajita explains. “Yes, you could say that Deepa's character resembles me in certain ways, and I decided to bring in Anjali to contrast her.”\n\nThe retired Captain says the book has been received well, including by her friends in the Army. “Though I wanted to write long before I joined the Army, I decided that my first book should be about something that I had first-hand knowledge,” she elaborates. “My next book though would be entirely different — it is about an ancient Nair family and the ‘marumakkathayam' (matrilineal system of inheritance).”\n\nLooking back at her career in the Army, she says she had a great time: “I chose to quit after five years because of my marriage. I was only the 79{+t}{+h} lady officer in the Indian Army. In my days, there used to be only 25 women for the 200 or 250 men in the Short Service Commission. Now that ratio is far more flattering for women. I feel the Army is an excellent career option for young women; you will not have to fight a war, you will be posted in an administrative or managerial job in which you can work as well, if not better, than your male counterpart.”"
