        "text": "Continuing with last year’s themes of topsy-turviness and trending slowdowns, real estate markets around the globe remain in flux. And, while hardly dormant, the multibillion-dollar ultraluxury market has not been immune to the pressures of inflation and high interest rates, not to mention political tension and financial unrest in many parts of the world. As Bloomberg recently put it, “It’s not a great time to sell a mega-mansion.”\n\nStill, while fewer in number than in recent years, eye-popping sales of extraordinary trophy residences were not unheard of, at least not in the U.S., where Jay-Z and Beyoncé splashed out $190 million (in cash!) for a Tadao Ando-designed compound in Malibu, nor in London, where Aberconway House in Mayfair was recently sold for a reported £138 million (about $177 million) to Indian billionaire Adar Poonawalla by Dominika Kulczyk, the daughter of late businessman Jan Kulczyk, who was Poland’s richest man.\n\nAnd even though several of the properties on this year’s list remain unsold and/or have undergone significant downward adjustments in price this year, there seems to be some optimism that the ultrawealthy will continue to shop for extraordinary homes to add to their portfolios. All but three homes on this year’s list are priced in excess of $100 million; the average asking price weighs in at roughly $160 million; and the sky-high price of the top property clocks in at $314 million, almost 25 percent more than last year’s $250 million.\n\nSo, whether you’re looking for a trophy estate in Los Angeles, a penthouse in Dubai, or a 45-bedroom mansion in London (or maybe just dreaming of one), here you’ll find Robb Report’s annual round-up of the 25 most expensive homes currently on the market around the world."
