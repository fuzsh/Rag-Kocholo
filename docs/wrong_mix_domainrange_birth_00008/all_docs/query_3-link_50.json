        "text": "Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail, known by his moniker Mammootty, is a renowned Indian actor and film producer predominantly active in Malayalam and Tamil cinema. Born on September 7, 1951, Mammootty has also made notable appearances in Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and English-language films. Over a career spanning five decades, he has graced the screen in more than 410 films, often in leading roles, earning numerous accolades including three National Film Awards, nine Kerala State Film Awards, eleven Kerala Film Critics Awards, and thirteen Filmfare Awards South. In recognition of his contributions to cinema, he was honored with the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1998, and in 2022, he received the prestigious Kerala Prabha Award, the second-highest honor bestowed by the Government of Kerala. Mammootty embarked on his acting journey with the Malayalam film “Anubhavangal Paalichakal” in 1971. His breakthrough came in 1981 with the film “Ahimsa,” for which he received the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor. Subsequent commercial successes such as “Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu” and “Aa Raathri” solidified his position in the industry. Despite facing setbacks with box office failures, the 1987 crime thriller “New Delhi” revitalized his commercial standing. Throughout the following decade, Mammootty emerged as one of the leading stars of Malayalam cinema. The 2000s marked a period of both critical acclaim and commercial triumph for Mammootty. His portrayal in the bilingual biopic “Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar” garnered him the National Film Award for Best Actor. Notable performances in films like “Kaazcha” (2004) and “Paleri Manikyam” (2009) earned him further accolades. His roles in “Pranchiyettan & the Saint” (2010), “Varsham” (2014), “Pathemari” (2015), and “Unda” (2019) were lauded by critics, with Mammootty clinching Filmfare Awards for Best Actor for the first three. Among his highest-grossing releases are action-packed ventures like “Madhura Raja” (2019), “Bheeshma Parvam” (2022), and “Kannur Squad” (2023). Beyond acting, Mammootty serves as the chairman of Malayalam Communications, overseeing channels like Kairali TV, Kairali News, and Kairali We. He is also involved in various production ventures, including the distribution-production banner Playhouse and the Mammootty Kampany."
