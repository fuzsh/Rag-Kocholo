In the night he eats wheat or oats dosa but he won’t eat more than three dosas.Along with dosa, he takes country (nadan) chicken curry without masala but added with coconut milk. If that is not available , chutney is enough for him. After that, he takes mushroom soup,\" revealed the chef.\n\nAmid the lockdown in 2020, Mammootty had also shared a post workout selfie of himself which broke the internet and made netizens go gaga.

He is consistently training and has always been good about his fitness, gym and diet. My mom, wife, sister, all the family members were surprised how good he looked and we thought he should post it. But we didn't know it would create a storm and everybody, across the industry reached out to him. It was great to see him being loved so much even for a picture and it was more like a film release.”"
