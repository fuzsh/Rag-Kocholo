        "text": "Full unedited version that was published in The Quint\n\nIn many countries across the world, the events in the past months have pulled the plug on their usual daily tasks of governance. For a majority of them, a pandemic is good news in a perverse sense, it allows them to cry hoarse at a seemingly invisible enemy rather than focus on the usual nitty gritty of boring, yawn inducing rituals of governance. As a result, long ranging pent up concerns that were at hand; be it struggling economies, spikes in unemployment rates, intensified democratic dissent, welfare of the citizens at large especially the vulnerable and disadvantaged are now minor quibbles, a mirage swept under, in the face of the monstrous pandemic, a welcome diversion. As being analyzed and debated present global institutions and much touted resilience anchored development frameworks have been caught on the wrong foot as the virus struts about globally with a devious mind of its own. Straggling developing and low-income countries are currently on course for a deep dive with respect to all growth and development indicators at least for the next three quarters, if not for a whole year. Sample these pictures from the dailies in India; a migrant worker scouring food waste in search of anything edible, humongous lines to get their hands on what is likely to be the only meal for a day in front of a community service kitchen, police raining blows over a humanity of migrants just wanting to return home, laborers with family in tow traversing vast distances on foot, all robbed of dignity; these scenes are courtesy a blank, despairing failure of governance accompanied by a national lockdown without virtually no planning or appropriate systems in place to back the countrywide call. But then what is a lockdown for a country that is already wrenching under the chains of communal passion, inhumaneness, bigotry and soullessness we may ask, but just another hashtag trending word in vogue for the buccaneering armchair twitterati and for random brain dead celebrities to dish out inane antics from the comfort of their lavish living pods.\n\nFollowing the daily press briefings from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) over the past few weeks since COVID-19 began its global scourge and entered India, the concern for the stability and accountability of our country’s administrative systems and public institutions is strikingly far greater than the scare of the pandemic itself. As health ministers and premiers engage with the citizens in their respective countries providing updates and throwing light on measures taken to fight COVID-19 we have to settle for junior officials of ministries and central medical research institutions to host press meets. These press meets are usual standard lines, static answers to whatever kind of questions may be asked with a cut, copy, paste alacrity of a pre-recorded answering machine. Journalists who probe further are ignored and as the façade of government of the people, by the people and for the people continues the majority are content gazing at a chimera that they are indeed in safe hands. Impeccable callousness and a cavalier attitude in confronting critical challenges of resuscitating the informal economy that has borne the brunt of the pandemic disaster coupled with a total disregard for the urban and rural poor ask serious questions of our democratic polity. In the meantime, regurgitation of our national past time continues unabated; the hounding and arrests of human rights activists and writers, vilifying muslims, flooding hatred and misinformation on social media handles, media houses mollycoddling at the bedside of the power and authority. Preliminary evidence coming in from the United Kingdom shows how the minorities, black and ethnic populations are impacted the most in terms of fatalities due to the virus, while in India it is the rural and urban poor who are the hardest hit, not by the virus itself but by a harsh state that revels in seeking forgiveness for its idiocy.\n\nContrast this with a federal constituent deep down south, Kerala that has been on its toes since late January when the first coronavirus patient was identified. Steered by the steely assertiveness of a chief minister and his team spanning across key departments, the battle was waged early and it is clear now with the flattening of the curve that the war will be won against COVID19, at least in this current stretch. Each fatality resulting in a demise is not merely a statistic in Kerala, there is a pause, the moment lends itself to remember the family left behind, an admission from the state government that this should not have been and that a life could have been saved. Each life is valued, whether it be the mere two year old Anvitha who had to be transported to Hyderabad from her home in Alleppey for emergency cancer treatment to Thomas, 93 and his wife Mary, 88 who marched out of Kottayam Medical College albeit in a wheelchair having crushed and overcome the corona onslaught. A state many wish that could have been their country in times such as these. A fellow traveler that resides in an imperfect whole of a nation’s edifice, crafting bespoke solutions to address disasters the magnitude of which towers over neighboring Western Ghats, a hundred times over. The core state leadership held daily press briefs with meticulous updates on the spread of the virus in the state, measures being taken to prevent its spread and has won accolades world over for its proactive and measured response to the COVID19 scourge. It has successfully managed to uphold the asset of democratic ‘trust’ that the people bestowed on its political leaders. Political thinker Pierre Rosanvallon in Good Government – Democracy beyond Elections writes, “…for to govern is also to speak – in order to explain oneself, to look forward, to set a course, to account for ones’s actions…to govern is to speak.” Further he adds, “ a genuinely democratic politics gives voice to the lives people actually live, makes the purposes of public policy legible and the obstacles to successfully carrying it out understood, finds the words to express the nation’s feeling at moments both of trial and triumph.” Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan is undoubtedly on song and would have wrested an unimaginable feat, in the upcoming assembly elections a year from now, an outright bolt to the finish line to rule the state for two consecutive terms, at the cost of a forlorn opposition a cohort of the Congress party that delights being in the shadow of its former shadow.\n\nFinally for once this pandemic ends and till the next one raises its wiry tentacles, and for always, to thwart the machinations of the deep state, we need perceptive citizens. As eminent journalist, author, professor Gary Younge said, “ the farther you are away from power, the more you see.”\n\nPublished in Deshkal Vabna, Vol.11, Issue 1 25 April, 2020\n\nIn one of the most heart-warming scenes to have come out over the past week, two elderly patients (93 and 83 years) emerged out of the Kottayam Medical College in Kerala, having conquered the coronavirus. Under treatment for over 25 days since early March, this triumph underlined a landmark moment for the people of the state. The virulent novel coronavirus pandemic of 2020 that has touched almost every part of the globalized world has affected more than 260 persons in Kerala as per the latest figures with around 55 recoveries and two deaths. Maharashtra and Kerala lead in the number of confirmed cases in India as of now. On a year to year screening for disasters, this is the fourth the state is facing since 2018. It witnessed its worst drought in 1917 and a hundred years later came the floods in 20018 that ravaged almost all the districts in Kerala. Last year too there were floods and landslides that almost reflected the disaster of the previous year. The impact of climate change and the unfettered path of development that the state was taking turning a blind eye to the damage this was causing to its fragile natural eco systems lead the state to introspect and review its future course. In between this calamity the Nipah outbreak reared its head, a virus that spread to humans from fruit bats that was concentrated mainly in the districts of Kozhikode and Malappuram. The state’s political and governance structures responded admirably to mitigate the effects of these disasters with the top leadership and various sector departments and the administrative machinery coming together to manage the crises. Now the beginning of the new decade has thrown up yet another challenge.\n\nHow did Kerala manage these shocks thus far and what are the lessons for other states especially now when the COVID -19 pandemic is unsparing in its reach and impact? Incidentally, more than 25 lakhs Keralites are working abroad of which a staggering 90 per cent are in the middle east. For one, Kerala began its planning well ahead of any other state or even the central government to mitigate the spread and effect of this pandemic and currently is the only state that is testing the maximum number of people. Early monitoring and isolation of coronavirus patients lead the way for the state to thwart its deadly march. The police, health department along with critical inputs from the home department deployed surveillance and mitigation measures quickly and were supported by community health workers in the respective wards to isolate and transport positive cases into hospitals. Contact tracing became the norm as intricate flow charts were prepared to ascertain the places where the patient had been to and tag all those they had come in contact with. These charts were rigorously updated and monitored to stem any kind of community transmission that even a single half measure could entail. With the diaspora spread globally, the state comprehended the gigantic task at hand even before lockdowns and social distancing became the norm. The health department swung early to set up corona isolation wards and establish standard operating procedures (SOP) to be followed as suspected cases began trickling in.\n\nThe Kasargod district in the north was one of the hotspots in the state with over 140 cases and as a result the administration block of Kasargod Medical College was converted into a stand-alone Covid19 hospital. Presently one lakh and a half citizens are under observation and have been quarantined. The state has now nine testing centres with a full-fledged COVID hospital functional now in Kasargode and at the same time ramping up the number of people being tested for the virus. The current issue facing the state administration is the lack of sufficient testing kits and the government is trying its best to address this challenge. Kerala’s evolution of a strong public health system laid the foundation for the state to address this current pandemic crisis. On the plank of its Ardaram mission that focused on providing quality health care accessible to the poorest of the poor, 500 primary health centres were upgraded to community health centres and over 170 health centres in the state were converted into family health centres, government hospitals were made patient friendly and over 20 hospitals in the state have been certified with National Quality Standard Certification (NQSC). Even as private entities swarmed the tertiary health sector in the state, the government continued focusing on strengthening its public health utilities and frontline grassroots medical personnel through important reform initiatives synergized with active collaboration with the local governments and health ancillary support units across the state.\n\nThe ethos of decentralised governance and people’s participation and a sustained localized democratic churning had ensured that Kerala had comparatively stronger local government institutions of governance as compared to other states in the country. The institutionalization of the local government process thereby meant transitioning and embedding critical procedures and protocols and bringing them within the ambit of local governments. The result was that the state was better equipped to address these challenges. Of course the response was not perfect in many situations and there were panchayats and municipalities who were caught out, but over a majority of them showcased efficiency in their planning and ensuring people’s involvement and implementing programmes as were needed locally. The local self-governments in Kerala have the capacity through its skilled human resources, infrastructure, citizen support and financial base, to address problems that seem insurmountable. The comparative advantage of the state in the local government landscape enabled the state to oversee and focus on crisis management holistically. The local government set-up along with the strong and proactive support of the district administrative machinery ensured that these measures reached each and every village panchayat or urban part of the state.\n\nAccording to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) that was prepared by United Nations, ADB, Government of Kerala, The World Bank and the European Union after the 2018 floods, the local governments had a paramount role in achieving the vision of Nava Keralam ( New Kerala). The report recognised the Panchayats’ role in restoring services, reconstructing houses, supporting local economic recovery and other public services. It said that the local government actions “ will go a long way not only in restoring normalcy but also in rebuilding a resilient Kerala”, stated the PDNA report.\n\nPresently there are about 2.6 lakhs migrant workers from other states in Kerala, whom the present government calls: ‘guest workers’. The state has taken positive steps to provide a social and welfare safety net for them. Apart from providing medical support, education and housing solutions, the focus is on important measures to integrate them into a Keralan way of life. In the aftermath of the unplanned lockdown that was declared by the centre, there was consternation among the guest workers as they tried to leave back to their respective states. This also led to a showdown with district police authorities in one of the districts, who tried to prevent them from leaving. However presently there are about 1200 camps across the state where the guest workers have been lodged and each of these are under the direct supervision of senior IAS officers of the state.\n\n“Social Unity amid Physical distancing” is the slogan of Kerala in the current crisis wanting to imbibe the spirit of unity and oneness amongst its people. The untiring and exemplary leadership of the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan along with the Health Minister K.K. Shailaja has gone a long way in assuaging the people of Kerala that they are in safe hands. From holding daily press briefs with meticulous updates on the spread of the virus in the state, to the measures being taken, the state leadership has won accolades world over for its proactive and measured response to the COVID-19 scourge. Ms. Shailaja a teacher by profession and popularly known and referred to as Shailaja Teacher, has also won widespread praise for her role in overseeing the public health machinery in the state and providing critical handholding to all the crucial district headquarters and below to stem the rise in the coronavirus cases. The state of Kerala has successfully managed to uphold the asset of democratic ‘trust’ that the people bestowed on its political leaders.\n\nKerala which was already reeling under a huge financial resource crunch has also announced a 20,000 crore financial package to address the pandemic situation. The aim is to ensure that no one in the state goes hungry – providing free rations, food kits, providing loans to families under the kudumbashree programme and transferring pensions for April and May in a single tranche. All this is despite a miserly sum of 157 crores that the central government has announced for the state as part of the pandemic relief. The state’s fiery finance minister, Thomas Isaac wrote recently that the state, ” …is harnessing its abundant social capital to overcome the limited fiscal space in which state governments are forced to operate in quasi-federal India. Led by a state government with commitment and actualisation of synergies between local governments and civic society, the outcome has been yet another marvellous social intervention for which Kerala is famous”\n\nAt the panchayat level ASHA and Kudumbashree workers have been given the responsibility to track people who have returned from foreign countries in their areas. Frontline health workers, local state administrative officers, police officials and health volunteers visit each home where persons are quarantined. Enrolled volunteers from every panchayat are there to assist the health department, after they get special training by the officials. The response to the call for volunteers has been overwhelming. A unique programme in Kerala is the community kitchens in every panchayat. They are powered by the network of the Kudumbashree that has a history of over 23 years. They feed migrant workers, homeless persons and those who need food with the aim that even in this alarming crisis no one shall sleep hungry. Kudumbashree in the last 20 years developed micro finance and is mobilising 2000 crores from Banks for providing additional consumption loans to member families. It has a membership of 32 lakhs families and manage 1479Kudumbashree cafes and 946 catering units as part of their micro enterprise program. Kerala’s public health system (PHS) comes under the local governments. The PHS network consists of 6000 doctors, 9000 nurses and 15000 health workers. Then there is a second line of health workers: Asha workers, Kudmbasree health volunteers, Anganwadi workers, hospital development committee members, palliative volunteers and health activists. In recent years there has been an investment of Rs. 4000 crores in hospitals across the state.\n\nTo conclude, the lessons from Kerala are many and the most important one in the era of populist, chest thumping narratives of hollow nationalism is to edify your critical sectors like health and education and invest in people. It is simply to walk the talk of development for the poor and needy, buttress the hardships of guest workers from other states by providing them critical social benefits, treat them as your own. Last but not the least, strengthen and have trust in your local governance systems for when disaster strikes, the last mile challenge is best left to them to take on.\n\n(Anand Mathew is a social development consultant, based in New Delhi.Email:anandmatthew@gmail.com)\n\n“Why are cities, towns or villages signified by the people who live there? Why is it that these places are not known or remembered more by their common sites or structures, places of interest, historical monuments and its tourist attractions but by persons who inhabit them. Why is it that often the name of a place is dwarfed by an individual’s profile unknowingly super imposed over it, is it because we identify a place more closely with an individual rather than an event, a popular landmark or a specific period in time, and that it gets so deeply connected with one’s psyche over time that the person overshadows all else to lay claim to that place, even its memories, as hers or his own.\n\nWhat do I remember? Did I see you as a newly-wed, a chirpy bride in all your glorious floral decor? Were there frosty doves, cooing and trotting around in their home cast atop a wooden pole at your home in Mundakayam? You were holding Babychayan’s sweaty palms leading him to embark on an unknown future, fully in charge of the situation at hand. Is this from a photograph or was I there to see it? Later, the casualness of your sluggish stride, the effortless majestic gait as you waltzed into a room, everyone looking to take notice.\n\nThe Travancore royals of yore would have whole heartedly approved of your demeanor, the well-meaning, authoritative earnestness put to use in deciding both important and mundane matters of life, a blunt and economical approach that easily out-maneuvered, out-talked all the pointless and plebeian debates to sway and ultimately side with your point of view.\n\nI was there to see it; the laugh, your laugh, and it is addictive. Full-throated, pure, laughter with the head thrown back on one of the wicker chairs caressed by your jet-black hair, slightly oily, curly long twirls flailing, freshly drenched after a warm bath. You like to laugh, love to laugh and those around soaked in your carefree laughter. You laughed for yourself and would laugh even more to make up for Babychayan’s grunt and a half smile, a tepid response he assumed was par for a barrel full of laughter, one that you ultimately filled. If free flowing laughter needs an icon it is you. It could easily disarm and as one laid down one’s defenses willingly, there would be a strike. You did not mince words, often shot arrow-straight, piercing whatever false halo we had built around ourselves, whoever it was and whatsoever the situation. You said what you wanted to say, we had to take it just as it was intended to and later, we could go and cry around the nearest bend available, unnoticed. It was good, because you had that much less baggage to carry around then, no?\n\nYou are a winner in your conversations, aren’t you, the legendary breezy and sharp repartees that even Joychayan or Sunnychayan struggled to prevail in straight-talking discourses with you. When they knew things were getting tough, they would often sheepishly but skillfully digress from the topic and give up.\n\nDid I see you step on to the bike perched behind as Babychayan raced the pedal, holding your bag and pointing to something on Babychayan’s short stretch of a moustache? Did he look into the rear-view mirror and pull out that seemingly errant single grey strand that was looking for company among an all-black bushy array nestled below his nostrils? Did you laugh as both of you trailed away, yes you did, I could hear you, but I could not see much as the bike leapt forward leaving a misty smokescreen coughed out from the bulky steel exhausts.\n\nYour charm, magnetic and effervescent, the calling of “Vechaya” still rings, a call so lazily vivacious in tenor that it has Babychayan scampering to you from where-ever he was or whatever he was doing.\n\nYou love the movies and I often over-heard impromptu oral movie summaries of the latest Malayalam films playing in town shared with mummy without a pause. Stopping sometimes to pepper your monologue with a few doses of that lovely, crinkling laughs in between, justifiably I think to prick a few holes in the overbearing masculinity of the so-called heroes of those days. I didn’t have the technology at hand to record this or you would definitely have been the first you-tuber of your generation. But the mind and its memories, it sorts itself out now and then, rewinds and plays back moments that are preserved somewhere, it’s just that we have to stroll back and look for it.\n\nNaturally then, you took the lead in choosing the movies to be seen when we were in Cochin. Abhi, Anil, Suresh and I would be given a hasty supper during which conversations hovered around hideous anecdotes of a creature covered in black coming to kidnap naughty boys who did not sleep soon enough, a smart ploy as you adults rushed to catch a late-night show at Shenoy’s maybe, all by yourselves.\n\nVisits to Cochin, always began with a session of part serious questions and answers revolving around school that I had to be a part of just for being the eldest of the lot. Do you remember that? The trade-off was often the definitive spread of lip-smacking fish, seafood and helpings of ample roast beef that would find its way on the dining table every time. The questions were mostly regarding studies, the subjects in school and also marks that I had the liberty to inflate at my own free will, which I bet you found out later. You would probe further incisively and then I would be lost as I looked out for help to see if mummy was around to take over and provide cover. It never happened. I would leave the session, often bruised, the north Indian urban city slicker ego taking a bashing. In retrospect this had its positives for as soon I joined Abhi, Anil and Suresh in our usual bouts of road-side cricket, the fours and sixes flew off my bat as the pent-up frustration gave way. I also remember that as I stood and answered your questions, Anil would dart in front of us letting out a high pitched wail after being hit by an intentional swipe of the cricket bat wielded by Abhi who followed him and as Suresh completed the trio looking completely clueless and enlightened at the same time to the many uses of the medium sized wooden plank. You would however carry on with the questions unmindful of the mild interruption.\n\nYou are usually unforgiving in your retribution and Abhi and Anil provided you with a lot of fodder didn’t they with their usual boisterous childhood uncivil activities around the house. I remember and feel your pinch, and you did pinch hard when we were up to no good. It helped your boys to turn the all-important corner in life, where it mattered, and for that you are a very proud mother.\n\nThe next time, if there is a next time, as the pilot summarizes the weather over Cochin and requests seat belts to be fastened, we will look out and see. For in those ever stretching, ever-lasting, never-ending sea of soft sailing clouds, eyes will search, the ears will listen and we will hear, a distant tinkle, peals of laughter gently reverberating across the vast expanse.”\n\n…… lots of love and take care till we meet on the other side.\n\nWe had been warned. The mind boggling trailer held the key to the movie, just like the lonesome key dangling on the rear-view mirror of a dark green splashed Mahindra that a cohort of characters traverse in. Or so we thought. The trailer of Super Deluxe, in a voice over by one of the movie’s principal actors, begins as a normal drone before transforming into a searingly breathless bluster. Delivered by Vijay Sethupathi, it is about a tiger chasing a man in the backdrop of a potpourri of sequences from the movie; the truth be told, it is the zany brilliance of the team behind the film chasing the audience, a willing prey. It is a reckless pursuit through a rabid screenplay that has our insides rupturing with ecstasy, a camera that pries into and hovers above illuminating at times sometimes dropping a veil over the characters, scenes that smolder casually but makes us levitate in its orgasmic rush. Ultimately we hurtle down a cliff in a roller-coaster-like tumble, tripping and brushing over wild overhangs as its vines of ecstasy coil around and strangle us, we submit humbly. Near the climax of it all a luscious dangling honeycomb beckons and we lick, slurp it all in, a dribble at first, yearning for a flood of it later. Come to the End-um and because we have to take the Exit-um, we don’t. Bappi Lahiri is now serenading us, we sit bush whacked, in a pool of sweeping wetness of sweat, spent. And then we yearn to do it all over once more.\n\nWritten by a trio of Nalan Kumaraswamy, Neelan K Shekhar and Mysskin, and singly orchestrated by Thiagarajan Kumararaja this is something so beautifully original that you want to cry, seeped as we are in a sea of mediocrity these days when it comes to big screen writing.\n\nSuper Deluxe is essentially a rebelling Madras Kumaran in gay abandon, never Chennai. At first you think the buildings, the sensibilities of the characters, the emotions are so nineties Madras, but 3D blinkers to watch educational videos of human biology on compact discs? No way they had those then. The whole plot then urbanizes in another story track where Mugil (Fahadh Faasil) complains of the painful web of surveillance cameras, which is so now. The trapeze artistes behind Super Deluxe go on to torment us with another trajectory of Manickam/Shilpa (Vijay Sethupathi) and Raasukutty, that is a gem of the keystone in many ways that keeps the other exquisite pearls on the tiara lodged together. We are induced, drawn in, the adrenaline flowing as the camera voyeuristically follows a Chengalpattu or maybe a Thiruvanmiyur famous five whose only aim and purpose at their lives specific juncture is to get high and off on those scientifically and at the same time practically validated educational compact discs. One such episode of this harmless hobby sends Soori running hellishly homeward bound, his soul strung out, the colored glasses still on, before being stabbed by his own horniness, a pert pointed knob entering him sharply. His mother (Ramya Krishnan), the target of his ambush had played parts in the above videos has now changed track, wife to a raving disciple in search of his god who had saved him from an all consuming tsunami, the same one that had cleansed Manickam, who inside a dim fleetingly lit subway finally rubs sense into Arputham/Dhanasekaran (Mysskin).\n\nThe Vaembu – Mugil story is the one full of edgy thrills with a hairy cadaver that had earlier sent a woman on top into fierce spasms during the introduction, putting in a comely performance of its young lifespan. Here the camera is uninterested in the act, as it surveys the environs within which this beautiful organic human propulsion is taking place. Later in a cocky scene, the deceived Mugil delivers a soliloquy to his nemesis now in a lifeless head tilt with black shades on, wondering aloud what Vaembu (Samantha Akkineni) saw in him, all the while gazing enviously at it’s nether region housing the flaccidness, a major partner in crime. Vaembu entices but the obsessive crush with her eyeliner and the Maybelline eyes seem way too chiseled and stay on too long on a character that is at once saturnine, martial maybe a wee lunatic. The writing here, as the repartees between Mugil and Vaembu stretch on about who is in in the wrong as their life races to tip above a marital precipice, gets labored and you really want this to segue into another groove.\n\nThere are motifs strewn all around, on a t-shirt it was surely the head of a Paralititan dinosaur rearing its head with its first two hinds, looming in the white sketch, but wait that’s only the tail going around the back belonging to a pussy. Now a pussy is the pet of the local gully don that has the gall to meow so often when the boss is busy verbally disposing of three random dudes, and the don does a repeat, this time with stock leather kissing their cheeks. Look for claustrophobic shots of intensely peopled streets with all sorts of businesses as the camera halts on a petrified Manickam and right behind on a dated, abused yellow wall, the eyes pick out the words magic event (these appear earlier in another earlier shot) scrawled across, what a mojo. Wait for the nude alien, appearing to the risqué trio, as she clones one of them to keep her company in this big bad human infested earth.\n\nThe adorable Raasukutty’s house is a museum of artifacts in itself; there are tales yelling out in the assemblage of articles and knick-knacks, the paraphernalia that adorn the walls bolstered safely by massive black pillars. Here we are immersed in witty ripostes by a maverick grandmother uttering such marvelous one liners at her spouse that the lackadaisical English subtitling gasps to keep itself abreast of what is unfolding. In the most emotionally shattering act of all the pieces, Manickam’s repeated earthy intonation of his child’s name splinters the heart, the impassioned kisses of a father, cemented as a failure, stooping to conquer the boy’s heart. Manickam, now Shilpa, a trans woman exhibits, no shows off nonchalantly the intricacies of folding a sari that has to travel a great deal to conceal quite a girth of a stomach, while the gob smacked wife looks on with eyes welling with sadness or is it jealousy. In another affecting scene a schoolmaster patiently conducts a masque on the word ‘go’ to a distraught Manickam beseeching to be allowed inside to meet Raasukutty’s friends. Manickam struts around in Shilpa’s world with the perfect 56 incher, the broadness ebulliently pitched for by Vijay Sethupathi himself. This my friends is the real thing anything else we have been marauded with in times recent can now be deemed a con.\n\nIf there is something you begin to feel awfully sorry for it is the two child actors, the inordinately long time they will have to wait to be witness to an enterprise in which they were a part of. Unforgivable. By the time they major it out in life and probably take to film school, the works of their creator would be the perfect material to begin with, no doubt.\n\nSo the next time you are in Madras or near about, make it a point to hunt for a tea-shop that’s located just across a police station, enjoy the tea but relish it with a few coconut biscuits and since you are already there just look around a nook here or a cranny there, for a television brand being surreptitiously sold by the name of Flying Monkey. While at it, take a detour back to the police station once more and ask them if the case involving the death of one Inspector Berlin had been solved yet.\n\n© Anand Mathew\n\nPublished in The Quint\n\nAs the car decelerated, the dense view of rubber trees that lined both sides began to clear gradually, my eyes caught the flashing white speck somewhere faraway through a narrow cleavage amidst the thick green foliage to the right; we prepared for the descent along a stony pebble laden, mud and gravel trail, a tubular island of wild grass middling its way through, wet and glossy from the afternoon rain, as we rode the decline on the left water steadily flowed along a two-stepped cavernous dark opening, the first sign that there would be enough water in our stream down below, some frogs croaked about hidden in the leafy vegetation that surrounded us all around, above a truck sped its way past on the main dirt road that we had just deviated from, its engine drowned out the welcome shouts of eager spectators from the house on the right, I waved glimpsing rotund Shaji running out of the side door, breasts jiggling on a bare sweaty torso as his hands swooped down on both sides to pick the fallen folds of the striped faded blue kailee flicking, folding it around the waist all in one swift action, his mother stood by their well pouring freshly drawn water from a decrepit iron bucket into a nearby cooking pot, his father Phillip Saar stopped leveling the sod around a banana tree and let the spade rest along one of his burly legs as he unfastened the towel wrapped around his head to dab bulging sweat beads on his forehead, they all stood smiling as our black Ambassador trailed away from their sight, now going faster tumbling downhill as if out of control skidding on the slack gravel and muddy slush; on the left we passed more rubber trees standing in sublime attention, birds flew around flapping their wings tweeting, singing choruses under a blanket of shade, a ramshackle once pinkish small room came to sight, patchy black and grimy with dried tan-brown rubber sheets hanging around its outer perimeter, someone was furiously working within probably running the roller machine that processed the milky white latex blubber into ribbed rubber mats; a path stretched upwards turning further right on to another house, the car now came to a complete stand still as negotiating the next immediate right was a tricky one; we were now stationed on a platform that acted as a rugged bridge over pristine water flowing from a longish culvert with knee high retaining walls on either sides made of black and grey rocks on the left, free falling into a larger, broader brook on the right below from a decent height, its torrential flow and resulting splash resonated loudly and one had to literally scream to be heard; Sunnychayan clicked the gear into the right slot and sitting upright lunged forward, his face almost kissing the windscreen to get a clearer view of the ground ahead, the front pair of wheels gained traction and the rear left wheel spun losing gravity almost airborne as he teased the accelerator, I could feel my mother at the back clutching at the front seat’s leatherette backrest of the car’s funky red interior in desperation and my father asking no one in particular as to when the treacherous route would be overhauled; the negotiation of the nearly blind curve was instant and masterful and the car rolled down sedately now on another slight decline, suddenly the thick vegetation narrowed on both sides and closed in on us as wet dew covered leaves skimmed our cheeks, the shrubbery gave way to a massive granite and rock edifice to the left covered sparingly with clumps of grass tufts that we could reach out and touch; more gigantic trees sprung up on the right its swollen roots snaked out of the earth intruding into the path we were on, as we passed one more tapering stretch of watercourse streaming downwards on the left a musky, pungent and at once sweet smell invaded the car, a huge jackfruit tree with its bulky overhangs stood shadowing us, a decaying jackfruit lay aground splayed open bursting with the half-gnawed fleshy yellow fruit that was being skimmed over by a bevy of flies, maggots and picnic beetles, the smell had now taken on an aromatic hue, the car continued to ride over brittle twigs that snapped under its wheels; ‘there’s water’ screamed my brother as we craned our necks, standing up and looking down beyond on the right falling over onto the weary driver in the process, along straggling rocks and boulders that outlined our stream people washing clothes stopped and looked at us curiously, the car now eased into another halt as we braced ourselves for the final ascent; my brother and I pressed the three-spoke steel ring set within the steering wheel blaring the horn to announce our arrival, up ahead excited conversations rang within ear-shot, people flitted in between the dense undergrowth of trees, familiar faces peered down from the mossy parapet wall eagerly looking down at the occupants of the approaching vehicle; around us banana, papaya, tapioca, ginger plants and coconut trees pirouetted in the evening breeze, a string of birds flew away forming an arc into the now dimming sky, ahead the mostly wet grassy track conjured to lend itself an almost vertical tangent skywards, Sunnychayan after a few twitches of the gear lever slotted the car into first and pushed down the accelerator hard, this propelled the vehicle into a sudden thrust forward, under the bonnet the Mark II’s engine complied grudgingly and grunted as it heaved itself along straight and then weaving and hugging a curve around the steep climb leftwards; we passed what looked like a make-shift wooden electric pole that had a big reddish yellow leaf stuck in between its overhead lines like a lonely note on a musical notation, there was a narrow way towards the right besides which more tapioca stood planted with immaculate precision, the pathway we were on now altered with humongous rocks out-lining the edges of the track with more gravel and less grass, towards the right the rose apple tree stood showing off its bell shaped pinkish red fruit waiting to be plucked, lines of yet more rubber trees stood adorning vast acres of land beyond as the familiar mud tile roof came into view; the car continued swerving to the left as it pulled and stalled into the front porch, its wheels scrubbing noisily over tiny black, greyish cobblestones that lay nestled amidst a mat of grainy beach sand; we tumbled out exhausted and exhilarated.\n\n**\n\nWe had reached our salvation from the unsettling city chaos. Ammachi stood waiting to greet us breathing love as pure as her whites. The welcoming hug, was more of a joyful, stony grip with a wet sniffle on the cheek as my nostrils took in a potpourri of her well starched whites’ steamy tinge nudging the smoky coconut oil in her hair both serenading the peaty ayurvedic body oil that had seeped into her arms. The short hug was followed by rapid fire questions ranging from school, extended relatives back in the capital to our elaborate train journey, the answers shouted out breathless along the walkway down to the stream that we had passed on our way up.\n\n**\n\n13 June 1984\n\n‘Do you want to come with me?’ she asked. Hesitatingly I said yes, thinking of the long tiresome stretch to be covered on foot. I took the long black umbrella she gave me and we set off. ‘It is required that once in a while the retiree presents himself/herself in person. This is to ensure that the person is still alive and that no one indulges in any mal practice’. Ammachi crackled a laugh as she said the last line. Our main destination was the town post office to collect her pension money, but she was also keen to see if there was fresh fish available en route to be brought back. Uninterested, I was deep in other thoughts, thinking of which movie poster would be plastered on the side wall of a certain building, or which pretty girl I would pass by. Ammachi walks fastest. I had to hop; skip and jump even run a couple of steps to keep abreast of her. On our way we paused at a neighboring roadside house to enquire as to when the Malayalam textbook for the new academic year would be available. Ammachi would stop every minute to acknowledge and speak to someone going the opposite way. It seems there was no one she didn’t know in town. So we returned a good three to four hours after having left home.\n\nThere were three of us on the return journey back. A man followed us carrying some tender coconuts in a brown sack and a half sliced jackfruit on his head. He was also ferrying some fish and vegetables. Ammachi had temporarily employed him on our way back and he had cheerfully obliged. He trooped straight to the yard outside the kitchen laid down his burden and washed his legs with the water from the well nearby. I don’t know if Ammachi knew him from before or not but they spent a good amount of time talking while he was served black tea and some snacks. Finally she thrust some money into his hands and he left.\n\n**\n\n18 June 1984\n\nPrasannachechi was not keeping too well; even then she was in the kitchen. Something was not right. Ammachi kept saying something on and on.\n\nIn the evening we heard Sunnychayan’s bike approaching and ran out. Prasannachechi was already standing there and waiting near the rose apple tree.\n\nThey talked for some time and Sunnychayan came inside. He looked angry. I think he has forgotten to bring the comics we had asked him to today also.\n\nBut we didn’t ask.\n\n**\n\n22 June 1984\n\nThis morning we brushed out teeth with a black charcoal like powder (made from rice husks, I learnt) called ummikari, a pinch of it was placed on the forefinger that was to be used as a brush, it had an awful taste but made the teeth really white and squeaky clean.\n\nAmmachi knows magic; she could foretell when it would rain. The late afternoon’s bright sunshine quickly gave way to dense heavy clouds that we could see moving from left to right. Across the front verandah the rains arrived storm like gradually sweeping from the western horizon. It was a glorious sight.\n\nIt came hard as she predicted. There were dried leaves, spices and jackfruit seeds that had been spread out in round edged brown flat shallow baskets outside.\n\nWe ran out scampering to pick them up while Ammachi rescued the clothes put out to dry.\n\n**\n\n23 June 1984\n\nToday was a bad day. I discovered an old tire behind the car shed. I wheeled it around the front porch and down the walkway a couple of times. Then an idea struck me, to see it roll and jump high as it sped across the hedges of vegetation beside the main pathway. I would stand at the top near the area where the cassava plants stood and push it down, it would bump and jump slowly at first and then gain speed as it hit each succeeding verge on its way downwards, once it even crashed and splashed into the stream way below. It was fun.\n\nIn the evening Ammachi came to know somehow what I had been up to and pinched my ears for destroying some of her beloved plants with the cruel pastime.\n\n**\n\n25 June 1984\n\nAmmachi’s sugar was high today. In the morning Sunnychayan tested her urine that was put into a test tube containing a solution. The mixture in the tube was placed above a low flame till it changed color. Depending upon the color it would alter to, one could ascertain the level of glucose in the body.\n\nShe got a lot of scolding from Sunnychayan. Ammachi was relatively quiet today and mostly took rest.\n\n**\n\n27 June 1984\n\nI spent most of the time today in the enormous kitchen. Narayani, Radha’s mother had come and mostly spent time cutting and peeling vegetables and cooking. She was of a jolly nature and always spoke with a high-pitched shriek, her teeth were all jumbled up and the front two jutted out as if in protest. She was unlike her husband Nanu who worked sometimes in our fields; he was harsh and scared me often.\n\nI would always be fascinated watching her chew areca nut, at times rolled in a beetle leaf kept within a tight fold of her kailee tucked into her midriff and the resultant red spittle that she whistled out in perfect straight lines near the plants beside the bathroom. I wondered how Ammachi let her indulge in this curious activity. She usually did this in the afternoon after lunch when Ammachi would be resting.\n\nNarayani pounded rice on the big black stone mortar (the base with a rounded hole in the middle where the damp rice is kept) using the pestle (a long black stone tool rounded at the bottom) turning it into flour. I watched with rapt attention as she pounded the rice, with the pestle swinging in mid air after each grind from one arm to the other. An oblong grinding stone and a roller was present atop a slab near the kitchen sink where chutney and other dry spices would be grounded. There were innumerable people in the kitchen’s vicinity or working in the yard beside the well, chipping firewood, husking coconuts, cleaning fish and so on. Ammachi had an eagle’s eye over everybody. Each one of them would be provided generous portions of lunch, some even forcibly fed; no one could leave hungry or escape without having something to eat. She occasionally went over to the cooking area where huge earthen pots were placed over burning logs of wood and blew with a black flute shaped tool that transformed the low simmering flame into a huge blaze that rose and licked the bottom of the pots. A few rubber mats hung around over the sooty fireplace soaking in the heat.\n\n**\n\n20 May 1985\n\n“ I will just slip into a state of unconsciousness and be back,” she announced after lunch using her pet phrase for a nap. We sat in the living room flicking through old magazines that Sunnychayan had kept carefully in one of the rooms.\n\nThe front entrance’s two lower square doors were latched closed with a wooden stub, the remaining top two were left open to let in the breeze and afternoon light. After a while someone came asking if anyone was at home.\n\nAmmachi got up and after talking to him for a couple of minutes went into her room. It turned out he was a wandering evangelist preacher of sorts. She returned with her delicate small muslin cloth with red flowers outlining its edges that was used as a head scarf and some notes that she placed in between the pages of the black cloth covered bible he had taken out from his worn out square satchel. He then proceeded to sing and pray, feverishly clapping his hands. When he prayed for Ammachi and her family, his voice broke, almost on the verge of tears. He prayed with passion and much feeling that his face twitched and arms kept making all kinds of frantic movements. Ammachi too would mumble along with her own prayer. I stood with eyes open staring wondering when he would stop. When it was over he said something again and Ammachi went into her room once more. Beside the chair he was sitting on was a cloth sack that he now brought forward and loosened the strings around its mouth. She returned with a cup of brown rice filled to the brim and tilted the grains into the open bag.\n\n**\n\n23 May 1985\n\nRadha, my brother and I visited the local market today. There were many things to buy on the list that Ammachi had given us. We went from one grocery shop to another and finally to the open vegetable market that was opposite the Federal Bank. On the way Radha got us some colored hard- boiled candy and a glass of lemonade. Back home, Radha had to read out the price of each item that was bought while Ammachi noted it in one of her diaries. She would be happy when Radha returned the exact balance amount. I wondered how Radha managed to buy the candy and the drink because she had not mentioned that to Ammachi.\n\nRadha went to school staying from our home and it seems Ammachi and Sunnychayan took care of her fees, uniforms and books. She had her room that was actually the kitchen storeroom. We spent a lot of time here as she studied, poring over her books and listening to her stories.\n\n“Son, come and press my legs.” It was my job to massage Ammachi’s legs whenever I was around. I sat at the foot of the bed and pressed as hard and best as I could.\n\nShe reminded me to tell Sunnychayan to get batteries for her torchlight, which was kept tucked away under her pillow. I said yes and went on rubbing for some more time and feeling tired I left.\n\n**\n\n10 May 1986\n\nAmmachi preferred to have her bath quite early in the evening to avoid getting a cold. She would oil herself and wait for some time before asking for her hot water. Radha poured it into a large round brass vessel in the bathroom. The smell of the dark and dank bathroom was a mixture of the moss-topped wet floor and a misty smoky whiff of the boiling hot water in the vessel. Often there would be black millipedes and spiders crawling around resulting in the occupant having a hasty bath.\n\n**\n\n15 May 1990\n\nRadha, my brother and I sat huddled together reading the Malayalam newspaper. “ Missing – A woman in her mid twenties has been reported missing since the last one week,” Radha read out loudly. Ammachi was seated on the yellow wicker chair beside the entrance to the dining room fanning herself with a magazine, asked her to repeat what she had said. Ammachi was shown the picture of the lost girl and she lamented about her and the family’s misfortune and prayed for them.\n\n**\n\n22 May 1990\n\nThe news and picture about the missing girl appeared today too and we promptly made sure it was brought to the notice of Ammachi once more. She was furious with the girl’s parents for being so careless, the police and the government of the day for not being able to find her after so many days.\n\nRadha, Suresh and I suppressed our laughter as she fumed about the inefficient system and how dangerous the world had become. The news item was actually a publicity trick for a Padmarajan movie called ‘Innale’ in which one of the protagonists played by actor Shobana is unaccounted for after a bus mishap. Sometimes it was easy to fool Ammachi.\n\n**\n\nMy only native mother-tongue teacher strict grandmother, ever so often cloaked in antiquity, an affectionate and tender matriarch with streaks of authoritarianism, perhaps only natural given all that life had put her through; never wallowing in grief or anguish for too long, letting the scars sit lightly within her; life had a design for her, hurling tragedies and despair but Ammachi endured, picking herself up, rarely crumbling; she amicably crushed any brewing domestic dissent. A pacifist, doting and at the same time perceptive mother in law to her sons’ wives, the invisible line that was drawn respected by everyone. All arguments and conflicts were best left sorted out between the respective couples or brothers in a hush on the sidelines under the vast reassuring shade of trees in the vicinity of the household or behind closed doors late at nights.\n\nShe was a talker. She invested a lot in her conversations with people even if it was some random person she had met. One could not get away with short or mono syllabic answers to her questions, she probed deep wanting to catch every nuance of what you wanted to convey. Ammachi expected the same reciprocity from those she engaged in discussions with, many failed her, countless times so did I.\n\nA ruthless disciplinarian but how can you be restrained on vacations? When it was time to leave our paradise, the departure hugs were often imprecise and awkward, battling the rush of tears welling around my eyes and trying to soothe the lump forming in the throat, the hope of coming back again kept me going. She bade goodbyes standing near the lemon tree and blowing into her muslin headscarf never knowing that she had turned her life into a story that we all were lucky to be a part of. However within the melting pot of enigmas, secrets, anecdotes and stories a mystery remains, was Ammachi a good cook? I may never know, but she marshaled whatever resources she had at hand well, both human and material, to ensure that there was a delicious variety of food for everyone. Anything that made its way to the dining table had to pass the approval of her taste buds. There were at times just too many cooks in the kitchen but never ever was anything mediocre laid on the dining table. As her daughters-in-law ventured to whip up their trademark fares she went out of her way to sing hallelujahs to each culinary offering irrespective of its outcome.\n\n22 June 2017\n\nIn my mind’s eye I saw her, calling her clucking chickens to roost at the onset of dusk as I stood flashing the torch to help her find the missing adventurous hen that was yet to return, I stood near the coop as tiny red ants bit into my legs; I saw her talking to her cows asking if everything was fine; she gave a hearty laugh listening to my broken Malayalam and then would proceed to correct the pronunciations; I saw her untethering the grazing cow from the electric pole along the walkway as darkness approached, patting and guiding it on the way back to the cow shed as I ran behind holding the trailing end of the rope leash; I saw her prompting me to repeat lines from the news reports I read out loud from the Malayalam newspaper, especially events in places torn by strife, letting out a forlorn whimper and with a silent prayer on her lips she cried for the people ravaged by conflict, famine and destitution; I saw her flashing a naughty smile as I handed her a banana on the sly after dinner; a wider grin dawned on her face as I gave a warm freshly laid egg taken from beneath the hen as it poked my fingers.\n\nThen she sat beside me and said lets pray. Wrapping the white knitted towel around her silvery mane, she closed her eyes, pressing them hard as if forcibly shutting out the world around her. She intoned, “Prarthanekkuttharam Nalgiyone, Ninte Sannidhiyil Njan Varunne…Swargiyanugraha Bhandharathil Vaathil Thurakkannamme, ‘ ‘ O the one that provides answers to my prayer, nearer to you I come, let the heavens be blessed, keep the door ajar for me,’\n\nAs I opened my eyes, she became distant, a whitish speck once more. The next moment she was gone.\n\nAn ode to my grandmother appears in the Amazon Kindle edition of “Amma” edited by George Abraham"
