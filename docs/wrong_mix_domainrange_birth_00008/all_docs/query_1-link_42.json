        "text": "Born in Yemen, Mukesh Ambani, the son of legendary visionary and entrepreneur Dhirubhai Ambani, inherited his name and position but not his wealth. He was born with a silver spoon, but turning it into gold was all Mukesh’s passion, hard work, and business sense. The Mukesh Ambani house was built on a multi-billion empire, brick by brick where he poured his blood, sweat, and tears into everything he did. And it was this perseverance, and his drive to achieve better things that motivated him and his family to move from a small 2-bedroom apartment to a 27-floor megastructure, in one of the best and most expensive neighbourhoods of India. Today, the building stands tall and shines with pride as a symbol of Ambani’s wealth, power, and stature as one of the richest men in Asia and the world with a net worth of 2.2 billion USD. If you want to know more about Antilla than just the given Mukesh Ambani house name, read on!\n\nThings we covered for you\n\n+\n\n-\n\nLooking Back at Antilia, The House of Mukesh Ambani\n\nThe 4,00,000 square-ft plot was purchased in July 2002 by Antilia Commercial Private Limited, a commercial business entity owned by Mukesh Ambani. The property was bought for a whopping 215 million rupees; which is approximately 3 million USD.\n\nThere was a slew of architects involved in the planning process. While Chicago-based architectural firm Perkins & Will and California-based interior design firm Hirsch Bedner Associates took care of the design of the house, Leighton Contractors, the Australian company, was outsourced for its construction. However, the building was eventually completed by B.E. Billimoria & Company Limited.\n\nAntilia currently hosts residence to Mukesh Ambani, his wife Nita Ambani, his two sons, Akash Ambani, his wife Shloka Mehta and their new-born Prithvi Akash Ambani, Anand Ambani, and his only daughter, Isha Ambani and her husband, Anand Piramal.\n\nMukesh Ambani’s House Price\n\nAccording to the recent estimate, each square foot of real estate can cost anywhere between 80,000 to 85,000 rupees. Mukesh Ambani’s Antilia is built on an area of 400,000 square feet. The Ambani family residence is estimated to cost around one to two billion USD that is between 6,000 crores to 12,000 crore rupees. This estimate was delivered by Forbes magazine.\n\nMukesh Ambani House Mumbai Address\n\nAntilia, Mukesh Ambani’s house is located in one of Mumbai’s prime cuts of land; the most expensive property coming second only to Buckingham Palace. If you want to know the Mukesh Ambani house location, it stands majestically on Altamount Road on Cumballa Hill situated in the Southern part of Mumbai.\n\nMukesh Ambani’s House Interior\n\nA house as grand as the man himself, the phrase ‘living large’ got a whole new meaning when Antilia house came along with her 27 floors decked in grandiose. The skyscraper was built to withstand an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 on the Richter scale. Even though it is a 27-floor building, its estimated height is that of a 60-story building owing to its height and massive high ceilings; each floor is said to be as tall as a 2-story building. It is said to be the tallest house owned by a single family in the world standing at 173 metres which are around 568 feet. But that point is constantly argued upon as Antilia also houses around 600 staff members. These staff members including bodyguards, assistants, and other security personnel have a huge room allocated for their relaxation.\n\nThe Ambani’s moved into their new residence in September 2011, after a grand puja and Vastu ceremony that was conducted by 50 renowned pandits.\n\nThe interior of the Mukesh Ambani House is said to be inspired by a mythical Atlantic Island. The theme is primarily focused on the sun and the lotus engraved into marble, stone, crystals, and mother-of-pearl.\n\nMukesh Ambani House Inside Features and Amenities\n\nIf you are wondering about the Mukesh Ambani house features, his passion for cars is well-known and that is reflected in the six floors dedicated to parking alone! His garage space can accommodate 168 cars. Not just this, Ambani has his own private car service station on the seventh floor. As you probably cannot see from the images, we can inform you from news reports that the house was decked with a beautiful and prominent temple, an ice cream parlour, a salon, a dance studio, a health spa, a ballroom, a yoga studio, and multiple suites meant to host guests. The mansion also houses 3 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The top six floors of the Ambani’s mansion have been sealed off as their private, residential living space.\n\nNot just that, the Antilla boasts of not one, two, but three rooftop helipads, as well as a 50-seater movie theatre, a Babylon themed hanging gardens, nine elevators, and accommodation for nearly 600 staff members of the property. One other area in the Antilia maze is the Ambani family’s snow room where they go to get away from the life-sucking Mumbai heat. The walls of the snow room are designed to dispense artificial snowflakes that give out Antarctic vibes. How cool is that!\n\nWondering how the family members move from one area to another without breaking a sweat? Well, thanks to the 9 elevators that run at super speed. These elevators are assigned to different sets of floors. There are separate elevators for the Ambani family, staff members, and guests. And in case, this would not suffice, there are three helipads built on the megastructure. However, they are not yet functional as permits from the Director-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Central defence and Environment ministries are still pending.\n\nMukesh Ambani House Interior Design\n\nThe Mukesh Ambani house interior design is not to be taken lightly as the designers for the interiors and construction were chosen after much research. We cannot give you a single Mukesh Ambani house interior designer name, as it required not one but two companies to make this home happen. Impressed by the work of two renowned companies in the United States i.e. Hirsch Bedner Associates, and Perkins & Will at the Mandarin Oriental New York, Nita Ambani handed over the monumental task to them. The construction for which, began in 2004 by Leighton Asia. After altering the floor plans and design concepts, the 27-storeyed cantilevered beam designed house, makes it as tall as a building with 60 floors, at a gigantic 570 feet. Keeping the design of the sun and lotus in mind, the interior of the Mukesh Ambani house is abundant with marbles and crystals, with no room being similar to another. No wonder the construction took about 7 years to complete!\n\nMukesh Ambani house theme is based on pastels, which adds a serene vibe to the whole mansion; with a majority of its premises set in different hues of brown, beige, and cream, Antilia is truly a sight to behold. The aesthetic furniture complements the serenity of the interior and the finishing touch is given by the chandeliers that hang from every ceiling.\n\nMukesh Ambani’s House Images\n\nAfter hearing so much about the multi-billion-dollar structure, is your curiosity getting the better of you? We’ve got you covered. Here are some photos of Antilia, the Mukesh Ambani house in all its glory.\n\nAntilla Construction Dates\n\nBeginning in 2004, the Ambani residence Antilia underwent intense development that lasted for seven years, until 2010. The Ambani family didn’t actually move in until the end of 2011, which fueled rumours that the mansion had Vastu-related problems.\n\nThen Mukesh Ambani House Land and Vastu Shastra Controversy\n\nMost of us are very religious and believe in the almighty above for our well-being more than riches and fame. The same is true for the Ambani house floors. There was even some controversy in 2011 as to whyMukesh Ambani’s family hadn’t moved out of their Sea Wind apartment and moved into Antilia. The most popular reason cited in news reports was that the property was not completely compliant with the ancient Indian architectural doctrine of the Vastu, or the Vastu Shastra. As great believers in the Vastu Shastra for home, they moved into Antilia in 2011 only after the complete pujas were done to remove Vastu defects or Vastu Doshas in the home with a team of about 50 pandits, led by their family priest, over 10 days. As we can see today, the family is still thriving in a happy home. Not just that, India’s second richest man has also built a second home for his family in a 300-acre land in Buckinghamshire.\n\nThen Mukesh Ambani House Land and Vastu Shastra Controversy\n\nMost of us are very religious and believe in the almighty above for our well-being more than riches and fame.

So, they decided to spend a nominal amount of Rs. 592 crores, with about 49 bedrooms, as well as a modern medical facility.
