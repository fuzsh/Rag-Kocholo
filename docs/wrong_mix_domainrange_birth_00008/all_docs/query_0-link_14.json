        "text": "4. Welcome to the fourth year of operations of Providence College of Engineering - the most promising technical education institute in Kerala. The campus has matured, a fact recognised by JCI India with the best campus award in the South Zone. Our staff strength has grown in quantity and quality with more capable and experienced minds guiding our trainee engineers into the future. Our trainee engineers have grown into finer and more mature individuals than when they first entered the campus. With accolades not just limited to academics, they are growing into refined citizens through their cultural and sporting achievements as well. Providence’s dedication to excellence is recognised at the state and national level by the fact that we are now the preferred hosts for many projects of the state and central education authorities. Our halls continue to be graced by luminaries from the world of academics, science, culture and public affairs. Being the only private engineering college in Kerala with its own space observatory, symbolises our desire to aim for the stars and dream of a better world. As our first batch of trainee engineers prepare to face the professional world, we are ardently working on training and placement opportunities to equip them with the skills and knowledge they need to compete at the global level. We are driven on this journey to excellence by our commitment to be the home of innovation, learning and development. This brochure will give you just a glimpse of what life at Providence is like. I invite you to visit us and see for yourself. Join us on this journey, as we nurture the globally competent, socially committed innovative engineers of tomorrow - for a better India and a better world. Best regards, Mariamma George Chairperson Life Begins Here\n\n5. A toddler institution in India, Providence College of Engineering, with an ambitious vision is preparing for our glittering engineers to walk away with glorified dignity and matured emotions. The voice of the precision CNC machines, screaming of UTM under pressure, cracking sound of generators and motors are melodious utterances for our final year students. Arduino board based silent designs, and active artificial intelligence are creative mementos for this new generation engineers to march ahead with confidence. The theory–tutorial blend of teaching along with micro projects every semester added industrial flavor to Providence teaching methodology with creative thinking capability. We the dedicated faculty and staff march ahead with prosperity under the leadership of highly devoted management. Let Providence shine like a star on the banks of the Pampa creating comets of energetic engineers for years to come.

Dr. Balakrishnan has a wide range of industrial and academic work experience and his patents and research have been used by corporations around the world. Message From The Director\n\n6. \"There are far far better things ahead than any we leave behind\" - CS Lewis. It's three years since we commenced operations with a vision to nurture globally competent, socially committed, innovative engineers. Within this short span, we have made a mark and Providence is a name to be reckoned with, among the best engineering colleges in Kerala. Our academic results have been excellent, projects have been recognised at larger forums and our international workshops/ exhibitions have received much attention and appreciation. Many high ranking officials from AICTE and KTU, who have visited our campus, are highly appreciative of the progress that we are making. We have also initiated many socially relevant activities in collaboration with NSS, SAGY and PMKVY for the people in our neighborhood. Our choir, music band, arts and sports teams have also performed well. Providence Angeli, Providence United and Providence Lakers are all names that are being spoken of. The vibrant young men and women studying here are not referred to as 'students'. They are called \"Trainee Engineers\". In every sense, we train them to be competent engineers. We give specific training in core areas and in soft skills to ensure the placement of all who pass out from here. We have also tied up with various companies for internship and placement. Yes, there are far far better things ahead. We are moving forward with a clear plan to make Providence College of Engineering a globally recognized institution of repute. I am sure, with the commitment of our Trainee Engineers, their parents and blessings of the Almighty, we will achieve this goal. Best wishes and a warm welcome to the Providence family. Dr Santhosh P. Mathew BE, MS, PhD Principal An Assurance For Life Dr. Santhosh P Mathew is a dynamic leader and globally connected academic and researcher with over 25 years of experience with leading engineering institutes around Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\n\n7. I consider it a great blessing and privilege for me to be entrusted with the responsibility of developing the research initiatives at this great institution. With majestic buildings radiating the glory of the Lord, the college campus has an academic atmosphere vibrant with enthusiasm and energy with eagerness to learn, develop, perform and contribute to society, locally or globally. Having done my postgraduate education at IIT Madras and having worked 50+ years in academic institutions all over the world in academic/research/consultancy, I have been gifted with definite and specific plans for charting its research journey ahead. The beautiful landscape and water bodies around the campus, give wide scope not only for recreation facilities, but also for building models of oil & gas platforms and floating facilities for tests related to research. Our trainee engineers are given individual personal attention for every course, with necessary remedies being implemented at the appropriate time. Our final year projects are planned to be product oriented as well as relevant, using local materials, indigenous technology and addressing current issues. These are supervised by energetic faculty with very good research standing and number of publications. It is aimed to publish the results of final year projects in relevant in indexed conference proceedings and journals. Hailing from Chengannur, I am greatly committed to input all my wisdom and insight for developing this institution into a premier technological university! Best wishes and warm welcome to the Providence family!
