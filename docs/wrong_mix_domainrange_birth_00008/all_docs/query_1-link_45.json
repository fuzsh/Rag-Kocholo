        "text": "Neil Young & Crazy Horse will make a national road trip for the first time in a decade this spring, making good on plans that were being laid for the band to hit the road before the pandemic interrupted the reunion. The 16-date tour begins with two nights in San Diego April 24-25 and wraps up May 23 in Chicago.\n\nThe tour will come on the heels of the release of a new Neil Young & Crazy Horse album, “Fu##in’ Up,” which will get a limited release on vinyl for Record Store Day April 20 before getting an all-format release April 26. The album is said to consist of songs from the band’s past, newly recorded in 2023.\n\nThe month-long tour is too short to hit all the cities fans might hope for, missing major touring tentpoles like Los Angeles, for instance (although San Diego is not too far a drive, for those who can score tickets to the amphitheater shows there). Other urban areas included in the routing are Queens, Toronto, Boston, Detroit, Phoenix, Austin, Dallas, Nashville, Atlanta, Huntsville, Bristow, Camden and Bridgeport.\n\nA Neil Young Archives pre-sale has already begun for subscribers to his site, with other advance sales to continue throughout the week before a general onsale Friday at 10 a.m. ET at livenation.com. Buyers can opt to receive a CD copy of the new album with their tickets at no additional cost, the announcement said.\n\nTo avoid secondary market scalping, tickets will be mobile-only and restricted from transfer, except through the Ticketmaster Face Value Exchange, where no markups will be allowed.\n\nThe last full tour by Young with Crazy Horse in tow was in 2014. In 2018, they did a handful of shows in central California (including a Bakersfield concert reviewed by Variety), followed by a couple of Canadian gigs in early 2019. They were believed to be gearing up for a wider tour in 2020 when the pandemic hit, and even after it abated, Young made it clear through statements on his website that he did not want to subject his audience to possible exposure by putting on a tour. Following a solo tour in summer 2023, he brought the band back together for two shows commemorating the 50th anniversary of L.A.’s Roxy, and the group did a short private show in Toronto for a birthday party this past November.\n\nThe current lineup of Crazy Horse has Nils Lofgren joining original members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina.\n\nA tracklist of songs on the new album of “familiar songs” — beyond, obviously, the title cut — has yet to be revealed, but it will include nine tracks, spread across two LPs on the vinyl version. Young said, “In the spirit it’s offered… made this for the Horse lovers. I can’t stop it. The horse is runnin’. What a ride we have. I don’t want to mess with the vibe. I am so happy to have this to share.” The initial RSD release will be on limited colored vinyl. (Other RSD titles set for April 20 have yet to be revealed, though the list is believed to be coming soon.)\n\nThe tour itinerary:\n\nWed Apr 24 – San Diego, CA – Cal Coast Credit Union Open Air Theatre\n\nThu Apr 25 – San Diego, CA – Cal Coast Credit Union Open Air Theatre\n\nSat Apr 27 – Phoenix, AZ – Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre\n\nWed May 01 – Austin, TX – Germania Insurance Amphitheater\n\nThu May 02 – Dallas, TX – Dos Equis Pavilion\n\nSun May 05 – Huntsville, AL – Orion Amphitheater\n\nTue May 07 – Atlanta, GA – Ameris Bank Amphitheatre\n\nWed May 08 – Franklin, TN – FirstBank Amphitheater\n\nSat May 11 – Bristow, VA – Jiffy Lube Live\n\nSun May 12 – Camden, NJ – Freedom Mortgage Pavilion\n\nTue May 14 – Queens, NY – Forest Hills Stadium\n\nFri May 17 – Mansfield, MA – Xfinity Center\n\nSat May 18 – Bridgeport, CT – Hartford Healthcare Amphitheater\n\nMon May 20 – Toronto, ON – Budweiser Stage\n\nWed May 22 – Clarkston, MI – Pine Knob Music Theatre\n\nThu May 23 – Chicago, IL – Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island"
