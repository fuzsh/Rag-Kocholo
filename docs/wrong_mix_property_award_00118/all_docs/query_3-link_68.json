        "text": "During these residencies authors enter into the life of the museum for a period of between three and six weeks. Over this period they expand their knowledge of the collections and the functioning of the museum through contact with its professionals and access to normally restricted spaces such as the restoration studios, laboratories and art storage areas. That experience provides the basis for the creation of an original text which the museum will be publishing in the Writing the Prado collection.\n\nThe next stories in the collection will be those by the Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk, 2018 Nobel Prize for Literature, and the Irish writer John Banville, 2014 Prince of Asturias Prize for Literature, who will participate in the Writing the Prado residency in October 2024.\n\nAdditionally, as part of its collaboration with this project the magazine Granta will publish J. M. Coetzee's text in its English version in its summer issue.\n\nThe Museum Guard /J. M. Coetzee\n\nWritten by J. M. Coetzee as part of the residency for writers program “Writing the Prado”, organized by the Museo Nacional del Prado sponsored by the Fundación Loewe and in collaboration with Granta en español. His residency in the Museum took place from the end of June to mid July 2023.\n\nJ. M. Coetzee was born in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1940. One of the world’s most renowned novelists, he is also a linguist, literary critic and translator. In 2003 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, earning praise from the Swedish Academy for the “analytic brilliance” of his literary work and the fact that his “intellectual honesty erodes all basis of consolation.” His work has also been awarded the prestigious Booker Prize on two occasions.\n\nThe Spirit Level /Chloe Aridjis\n\nThe Spirit Level by Chloe Aridjis, is the second book of the “Writing the Prado” collection. This story is part of the residency for writers organized by the Museo Nacional del Prado with the sponsorship of the Fundación Loewe and in collaboration with Granta en español. Chloe Aridjis stayed in the museum from the begining of October till the end of November 2023."
