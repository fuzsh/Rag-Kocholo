        "text": "Elizabeth Costello.\n\nCOETZEE, J.M.\n\nItem Number: 103641\n\nLondon: Secker & Warburg, 2003.\n\nFirst British edition of this novel by the Nobel Prize-winning author. Octavo, original cloth. Signed by J.M. Coetzee on the title page. Near fine in a fine dust jacket.\n\nBilled as fiction, this puzzling book by the new Nobel laureate in literature is more nebulously a collection of essays, all but two previously published, embedded within the story of an aging novelist, Elizabeth Costello, as she goes on the lecture circuit. Costello first appeared in Coetzee's slender 1999 volume \"The Lives of Animals,\" in which she delivered a college address on animal rights, and that text is reprised here as part of eight \"lessons\" that she must give or receive, ranging in subject from literary realism to the problem of evil. Coetzee's work has always been distinguished by cerebral rigor, which in his strongest novels propels narratives of claustrophobic and often savage intimacy. But here he seems to have lost faith in the power of storytelling; his heroine's journey takes place almost entirely in the realm of the mind, and the effect is that of exploring a cold, depopulated planet."
