As a schoolboy in early 1980s, before Desmond Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, I heard him preach at the Cathedral of St. Andrew and St. Michael in Bloemfontein, South Africa. I’d gone with a group of friends mainly to avoid another Sunday evening in the school hostel; I left the Cathedral forever changed. [Also available as an eAudiobook] Show less\n\nAll copies in use.

L’etranger (The Stranger or The Outsider) is possibly the best-known among his books and an obvious one to include on a reading list. But doing so allows us to forget the intense exploration of his commitment to Algeria, the land of his birth, in Algerian Chronicles, and to overlook his significant ability as a short story writer in Exile and the Kingdom.

I followed it up with a heavily redacted copy of Fatima Meer’s biography, Higher than Hope (published in 1988 by Skotaville Publishers—two years before the international version appeared). Both Long Walk to Freedom and Conversations with Myself continue the conversation started in No Easy Walk, offering words of hope and inspiration insights from one of the most the world’s most iconic figures.

His heartfelt account of the UN’s successes (a global effort to combat HIV) and failures (Rwanda) is a testament to the difficulties that beset international co-operation, while also highlighting its importance, especially now. This remains a book for our times as we find ourselves in the middle of a global pandemic. Annan won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.

Nadine Gordimer, another African Nobel laureate, writes in Writing and Being how Mahfouz and Chinua Achebe present another world, one in which “the postcolonial world … bears on the face of ancient Egypt and old Africa the paint and patches of foreign occupations.” There is little more to say. There is much more to say. Mahfouz (Nobel Prize for Literature, 1988) completes the trilogy with Palace of Desire and Sugar Street.

Gordimer (Nobel Prize for Literature, 1991) takes us into the heart of the Soweto protests in 1976, a moment that sparked a renewed sense of anti-apartheid activism. Commitment and complicity are laid bare as two sides of what we now call “white allyship”.

Gbowee’s book needs to be read in conjunction with Ellen Sirleaf Johnson’s biography (This Child Will Be Great), with whom she shared the Peace Prize in 2011. Where Gbowee offers insights from the perspective of a grassroots activist, Sirleaf Johnson provides an account of the same struggle from the perspective of a career politician.

Also by Coetzee, Life and Times of Michael K is a devastating book. The gradual descent into threadbare existence is terrifying. Rarely has such an apocalyptic vision haunted fiction. To contrast that, read Nthikeng Mohlele’s Michael K, in which Mohlele unpacks the disconnected world of Michael K from the perspective of a black writer. Between them, Mohlele and Snyckers render powerful critiques of the literary establishment. [Also available in print] Show less\n\nAvailable\n\nCheck out"
