        "text": "An album heralded as a return from Bob Dylan's born-again proselytizing, the Mark Knopfler-produced Infidels began Bob Dylan's journey back toward mainstream music making — and it may have been even better except for some last-minute tinkering.\n\nLuckily, the final track listing included the stand-out song \"Jokerman,\" which found Dylan using themes both Biblical and secular to tear down political charlatans. Or was it a dark reflection on Judaism? A rumination on false messiahs? A cutting indictment of his own career missteps?\n\nSuch are the enduring mysteries of classic Dylan, the singer-songwriter’s wild card. In a way, that makes Infidels, released on Oct. 27, 1983, , the earliest indication of the long-hoped-for bounce-back moment that would finally coalesce into the '90s.\n\nREAD MORE: Top 10 Bob Dylan Lyrics\n\nTwo key moments, however, were left on the cutting room floor as Dylan continued editing and re-recording Infidels, long after Knopfler had left to pursue his own separate musical interests. The outtake \"Blind Willie McTell,\" for instance, later gained a talismanic import among fans before finally appearing on 1991's The Bootleg Series Vol 1-3.\n\nWatch Bob Dylan's 'Jokerman' Video\n\nLeaving Religious Recordings Behind\n\nThe sessions also included \"Foot of Pride,\" a perfectly executed Dylan put-down about those trapped in ego. (\"Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart\" was subsequently re-drafted for 1985's Empire Burlesque.) In their place went \"Union Sundown,\" a much lesser effort – though still one that exhibited a tougher political bent than had a previous trio of faith-focused recordings dating back to 1979's Slow Train Coming.\n\nElsewhere, Infidels made room for \"Sweetheart Like You,\" which was talking down to a woman or else the wayward church; \"License to Kill,\" which seemed to question the wisdom of space travel when there are still so many unsolved issues down below; and the now-expected album-closing paean to a lover, \"Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight.\"\n\nEach of them had a sleek approach that updated his sound without dismantling its foundational wit. Credit there goes to Knopfler, and an all-star cast that included Mick Taylor, Robbie Shakespeare and Sly Dunbar — the latter of whom give \"Jokerman\" in particular a bouncy island feel.\n\nIn manner and tone, that track connected back to the promise of Dylan's mid-'70s work, and gave us the first concrete hint at the third-act successes to come beginning with 1989's Oh Mercy."
