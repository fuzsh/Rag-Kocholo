        "text": "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter, author, poet, and visual artist who has been a major figure in popular culture for more than fifty years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the Civil Rights Movement and anti-war movement. His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture.\n\nThe Residents respected him and planned on making a tribute album to him in the 1980s.\n\nUse in Residents projects[]\n\nIn 1971 The Residents recorded a heavily altered cover version of his 1965 song \"Maggie's Farm\" for their Warner Brothers Album.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1987 The Residents planned on recording a tribute album to Bob Dylan and Barry White, titled Bob & The Blob, however, the project was abandoned with the American Composers Series.\n\nIn 2003 The Residents remixed their version of Maggie's Farm and released it on WB:RMX\n\nCredits On Residents Albums[]"
