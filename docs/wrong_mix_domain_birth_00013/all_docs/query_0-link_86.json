How can you put it?\n\nHe was kind of like a hustler type on the street, you know, somebody... You know, trying to make a deal about this and make a deal about that.\n\nHe was a fast talker.\n\nWell, I saw him perform all the time.\n\nI hung out with him.\n\nI was the guy.\n\nI was his manager.\n\nI mean...\n\nSo I was there wearing, at that time, as was my practice, I was the only one in the entire Village that wore a suit.\n\nEveryone else was in jeans, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nBut I had my little outfit and so forth... that I wore.\n\nSo, I saw him all the time.\n\nI mean, we met on a daily basis, trying to figure out what to do next.\n\nAnd I was trying to...\n\nThere was no question.\n\nI was trying to make him a star, and I knew that he could and would be a star.\n\nIn the '60s, it was...\n\nIt was great.\n\nThere was so much talent around at that point, and in an undiscovered area, folk music.\n\nMy God, who knew from folk music?\n\nI mean, the only person that was alive that any of us knew with Pete Seeger.\n\nNo one understood what was happening at that time.\n\nI mean, no one woke up and said, \"Oh, my God, it's folk music!\"\n\nWe were just out there.\n\nI mean, Pete Seeger was God, and we were just people working and trying to make a buck and hoping that this would all turn into something fabulous.\n\nAnd it did.\n\nYou could smell it, that there was something going on at that period of time that would do away with the old stuff.\n\nNo one ever thought, no one that I remember at that time period ever thought that this was one day going to who'd be Bob Dylan.\n\nI remember that he was strange and that I was not going to...\n\nThis was not anyone that I was going to have an easy time communicating with.\n\nThis would be...\n\nI'd have to pull everything out of him because he didn't know where he was or what he was doing, and so forth and so on.\n\nI mean, he was new to the Village.\n\nGerde's Folk City was the highest his dreams had ever gone to.\n\nSo, you know, it was hard to figure out where we were all going to go with this.\n\nWith Bob, I took a piece of paper out of whatever, or I asked someone, and wrote down that, \"I, Bob Dylan, do hereby \"agree to be managed by Roy Silver for 20%.\"\n\nI forget what the period of time was and so forth.\n\nAnd Bobby signed it.\n\nIt was really no big deal.\n\nHe was strange.\n\nYou were dealing with a guy who had a strange voice, who had a strange rhythm, who was playing a guitar in a strange, humdrum fashion.\n\nI mean, that was really the response.\n\nNo one leaped up from their seat at the end of the show and said, \"My God, the Messiah has come.\"\n\nNo one.\n\nI mean, it was hard.\n\nHe went up.\n\nHe did a show.\n\nHe came off.\n\nHe didn't do a show.\n\nNo one ever accused Bob of being a great performer.\n\nI mean, at any time.\n\nBob came running up to see me to play a new song for me.\n\nSo I said okay, and I sat there, and Bob whipped out his rusty guitar and he played this song for me and I said, \"This is the greatest song I've ever heard.\"\n\nAnd he was thrilled that I said to him that this was a great song, and I said, \"We have to record it immediately \"because I know a place where this should go.\"\n\n\"I'm going to call Artie Mogull and everything, \"but first, we've got to go in and record it.\"\n\nAnd my memory tells me that we went...\n\nI went downstairs at Third Avenue, at the place that we were at.\n\nIt was a Chinese laundry, and I borrowed $50, 'cause no one had any money then.\n\nI borrowed $50 so that I could go to 1619 Broadway, or wherever it was, to make a record.\n\nThat's how we spoke in those days.\n\nWe were going to make an acetate.\n\nBob would sing and play simultaneously, and we would run and record it.\n\nAnd I did that, and then I sent him home because he was boring to be with and I didn't want to hang out anymore with him.\n\nAnd then I went over to... the publishing company, Witmark.\n\nIt was one of those songs that you knew, if you were in the music business, you knew that a gold mine had just been discovered.\n\nWe just arbitrarily decided that we would do it with Peter, Paul and Mary.\n\nCame out three weeks later, a little song called Blowin' in the Wind, went on to absolutely establish who Bob was and what his place was in the world, and deservedly so.\n\nI mean it was, to this day...\n\nI mean, I can listen to it.\n\nI just heard it the other day on someone and it just... Blowin' in the Wind.\n\nI mean, it brings tears to your eyes.\n\nHow he could think of all of that, how he made that all work.\n\nThis nice little Jewish kid, with nice little Jewish parents, who had changed his name, which was a big enough shanda, that means \"disgrace,\" at that time period, you know.\n\nAnd then it was onward and upward.\n\n♪ How many roads must a man walk down ♪ Before you call him a man?\n\n♪ How many seas must the white dove sail ♪ Before she sleeps in the sand?\n\n♪ Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly ♪ Before they're forever banned?\n\n♪ The answer, my friend is blowin' in the wind ♪ The answer is blowin' in the wind ♪ Yes, and how many years must a mountain exist ♪ Before it is washed to the sea?\n\n♪ And how many years can some people exist ♪ Before they're allowed to be free?\n\n♪ Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head ♪ And pretend that he just doesn't see?\n\n♪ The answer, my friend is blowin' in the wind ♪ The answer is blowin' in the wind [COUGHS] ♪ Yes, and how many times must a man look up ♪ Before he can see the sky?\n\n♪ And how many ears must one man have ♪ Before he can hear people cry?\n\n♪ Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows ♪ That too many people have died?\n\n♪ The answer, my friend is blowin' in the wind ♪ The answer is blowin' in the wind ♪ [CHUCKLING] Albert Grossman.\n\nThe thing that I love the most about Albert.\n\nAlbert had this trick.\n\nHe could sit there in a room longer than anyone in the world and not say a word.\n\nIt was such an amazing...\n\nSo that people would find themselves all of a sudden getting up and saying, \"I did it, I killed him.\"\n\nI mean, they would confess to anything so as not to have to sit in a room with Albert and let that silence swell out.\n\nHe had an office.\n\n[WHISTLES] [LAUGHS] Not many people had offices at that point.\n\nWe were all living in the Village.\n\nSo, Albert and I went into business together.\n\nI could see that Albert Grossman really wanted to take over... Dylan.\n\nI could see that.\n\nI mean, and he... Albert had the money to do it.\n\nAlbert is, at best, a strange guy, and I have no money.\n\nAnd I see that Bobby, who is easily, in my opinion, manipulated because he didn't give a... in any way.\n\nHe was just busy \"writing them songs.\"\n\nI see that I'm going to lose out on this.\n\nThat it's not going to work the way that I want it to work.\n\nSo I better move quickly, and I come up with the scheme of selling my share of Dylan's contract.\n\nWe had split it 50-50, and my share should be sold, and I should get $10,000.\n\nI have to tell you that $10,000 in 1961 was a fortune.\n\nThat was a lot of money at that point.\n\nBut he was always very sweet to me, you know, after the dissolution and so forth and so on.\n\nAnd I felt that, my own personal feeling...\n\nI always thought that Albert took away so much of the fun of him.\n\nBut that's my opinion.\n\nI thought he was a warmer, more mellow guy than Albert had turned him into.\n\nThe song Blowin' in the Wind, my favorite song.\n\nAnd I was there.\n\n\"How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?\n\n\"Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail \"before she sleeps in the sand?\n\n\"Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly \"before they're forever banned?\n\n\"The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind.\n\n\"The answer is blowing in the wind.\"\n\nOkay.\n\nIt's so funny to read this lyric now.\n\nThat's 100 years old.\n\nWe've all heard it for, you know, so long.\n\nNow it's become...\n\nIt's moved beyond what it was in a strange kind of a way.\n\nAlthough, I told you, I heard it the other day.\n\nI forget where, and I started to cry.\n\nDYLAN: I got out of the current George Washington Bridge, took the subway down the road.\n\nWent to the Cafe Wha?, I looked out at the crowd.\n\n\"Does anybody know where a couple of people could stay tonight?\"\n\nI was ready for New York.\n\nIZZY YOUNG: So, this guy comes in.\n\nHe didn't look too prepossessing, didn't look the wild sort.\n\nHe looked like an ordinary kid.\n\nHe said, \"Listen, I got some songs I want you to hear.\"\n\nSo I was, \"Oh, God.\n\nCan you come tomorrow?\n\nGet out of here.\"\n\nHe said, \"No, I want to sing you a song.\"\n\nSo I let him sing the song.\n\nAnd then I started pointing people.\n\nI said, \"Listen, see that guy in the back room?\n\n\"His name is Bob Dylan.\n\nYou should listen to him.\n\n\"The guy's writing good songs, he's terrific.\"\n\nAl Jolson was the first successful folk manager who knew how to make money out of the singles.\n\nARTIE MOGUL: Albert tells me one day they're going to send a guy over to see me named Bob Dylan.\n\nHe's got a guitar with some kind of a contraption around his neck, so that the harmonica is up to his mouth.\n\nNow, believe me when I tell you, nobody had ever seen this before.\n\nAnd he starts singing for me.\n\n♪ How many roads must a man walk down ♪ Before you call him a man?\n\n♪ How many seas must the white dove sail...\n\nThe music business per se was dominated by music publishers.\n\nIn those days, the song was important.\n\n♪ ...must the cannonballs fly...\n\nWhen I heard \"How many ears must one man have \"before he can hear people cry?\"\n\nI flipped.\n\nI can't even remember what the songs were that he played me that day.\n\nBut I said, \"Okay, that's it.\n\nI want you.\n\n\"I'll give you a writer's contract.\"\n\nAnd we got a contract ready and he signed it.\n\nDYLAN: I didn't tell anybody for a bit because, you know, I almost wasn't sure it was happening myself.\n\nSo I don't think I really told anybody until I actually went through with the sessions.\n\n♪ ...is blowin' in the wind ♪ The answer is blowin' in the wind ♪ Now, Bob, when he started to bring me songs, the lyrics were written on this long yellow legal-size paper.\n\nEvery one of the songs came to me that way.\n\nThe Times They Are A-Changin', all the classics.\n\nAnd we would take him into this little tiny studio that was across from my office and he would make a tape, singing the song, playing the guitar.\n\nI would then take the tape and give it to our head copyist, who was a guy named Simeon Saber.\n\nSimeon Saber was about 65 years old, and he'd been sitting there with his green eyeshade for 45 years, copying the songs of Victor Herbert, Rudolf Friml, and now I'm bringing him songs about rats eating babies.\n\nHe comes to me one day and he says, \"We've got to get a young copyist in.\n\nI just can't do this.\"\n\nStrangely enough, even the old people there, everybody got on the Dylan bandwagon.\n\nEverybody started to record Bob Dylan songs.\n\nHelped, of course, by the fact that Peter, Paul and Mary did Blowin' in the Wind and then Don't Think Twice.\n\nAnd I think it was the fact that all these other artists did Bob, is what made him start to become so big.\n\n♪ 'Cause the times they are a-changing ♪ Come mothers and fathers... ♪ He was the first artist who could record an album of 10 or 12 songs and be the writer and publisher of all the songs.\n\nPrevious to that, if Nat Cole recorded an album of 12 songs, 12 different writers and 12 different publishers wrote those songs.\n\nIn Bob's case, he really was writing all these great original songs and on all the publishing and all the writing.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end of what used to be known as Tin Pan Alley.\n\n♪ Well, I ain't got my childhood ♪ Or friends I once did know ♪ But I still... DYLAN: I wrote a lot of songs in a quick amount of time.\n\nI could do that then.\n\nBecause the process was new to me.\n\n♪ Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doin' fine ♪ Yes, I don't think a lot of people realize.\n\nEven I question, where did this come from?\n\nHow does he come up with these?\n\nHow did this kid from Hibbing, Minnesota... How was this in him?\n\nI'll tell you something else interesting about those demos that we used to make with Bob.\n\nSomeplace there exists the tapes on those.\n\nMAN: I have the tapes.\n\nMOGULL: You actually found the tapes from those demos he made?\n\nMAN: We have all the original tapes from the demos in the original boxes.\n\nMOGULL: Well, that could be a great album.\n\nANNOUNCER: Today's young people have more leisure time than any previous generation, and more ways to fill those hours between work and play.\n\nFor practically everyone twixt 12 and 20, one activity to beat the band is music.\n\nWhether blasting from a transistor radio at the beach or the record player in your bedroom, music is in the air that teenagers breathe.\n\nBut like any healthy teenage activity, music could be corrupted by unscrupulous profiteers out to push the latest dubious gimmick in the name of progress.\n\nYou kids have to be careful of these snake oil salesmen trying to sell you stereo sound.\n\nIt's just a scam to raise the price of records.\n\nBut my boyfriend says that stereo makes it sound like a group is playing right in your bedroom.\n\nYeah, and how would your dad feel if one of these rock groups did come and play in your bedroom?\n\nWell, I guess he wouldn't really go for that.\n\nANNOUNCER: Darn right he wouldn't, and neither would your neighbors.\n\nStereo sound purports to split the signal between two speakers, putting half the music in one side and half in the other.\n\nThey claim that when the music is reassembled in your brain, it fools you into thinking you're hearing a band spread out around the room.\n\nWhy would I want to fool my brain?\n\nANNOUNCER: Exactly, Scottie.\n\nBy introducing deceptive patterns into the adolescent mind, stereo sound plays havoc with the still-developing tissue of the teenage brain.\n\nStereo is designed to lie to you.\n\nThe fallacy of the stereo sales pitch is that it's based on the false syllogism that two speakers equal your two ears.\n\nBut what it ignores is that you only have one brain, and you don't listen to music with your ears, you listen with your brain.\n\nANNOUNCER: What is the antidote to stereo?\n\nWell, it's been right in your home all along.\n\nGood old American mono.\n\nIn the recording studio, each instrument has its own microphone.\n\nTrained technicians on the other side of the protective window balance the volume levels to achieve an ideal blend.\n\nWith mono recording, you hear that same perfect blend wherever you're standing.\n\nHowever, with stereo recording, you may hear a blaring trumpet in the left speaker, an out-of-tune electric guitar in the right speaker, and a honking Lowrey organ somewhere on the ceiling.\n\nANNOUNCER: And here's something you may not know.\n\nToday's most with-it groups mix all their records in mono.\n\nThat's the true recording.\n\nStereo mixes are often done after the musicians you love have left the room.\n\nThis whole stereo stampede is nothing but a flimflam to trick teenagers into paying more for records.\n\n$3.50?\n\nThat's more than my whole allowance.\n\nOnce customers swallow high stereo prices, many stores may stop selling mono records altogether.\n\nThey can't do that, can they?\n\nANNOUNCER: Teenagers are the future of America.\n\nThese young twisters, swingers and go-go kids will someday be our senators, astronauts and homemakers, but to live in the future, everyone will need a fully functioning brain.\n\nEveryone will need to be able to think clearly, straightforwardly in mono.\n\nI'm sticking with mono.\n\nI'm sticking with mono.\n\nANNOUNCER: Let's all stick with mono.\n\n♪ Columbia That's the magic word ♪ For the greatest records you've ever heard ♪ You even get past the hi-lo on

♪ NARRATOR: Between 1965 and 1966, Bob Dylan recorded three albums that many believe changed the course of modern music.\n\nBringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde.\n\nThe Cutting Edge, The Bootleg Series Volume 12 takes you inside the studio during the recording of these three legendary albums.\n\n♪ Well, the rainman's coming and he's waving his wand ♪ And the judge says \"Mona can't have no bond\" ♪ Mona, she starts to cry ♪ Rainman leaves in a wolf's disguise... ♪ NARRATOR: With a staggering wealth of unreleased songs, outtakes, rehearsals and alternate versions, The Cutting Edge provides a unique look into one man's astonishing creative process.\n\nMAN: My Girl, take one.\n\nNARRATOR: January 1965, Dylan arrives at CBS Recording Studios in Manhattan looking for a new sound.\n\n♪ She's got everything she needs ♪ She's an artist She don't look back ♪ She's got everything she needs ♪ She's an artist She don't look back ♪ She can take the dark out of the night time ♪ And paint the day time black ♪ NARRATOR: On The Cutting Edge, we follow that journey as the elements of Bringing It All Back Home fall into place.\n\n♪ Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?\n\n♪ ♪ Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me... ♪ DYLAN: Hey, I can't... Hey, the drumming is driving me mad.\n\nI'm going out of my brain.\n\nNARRATOR: Six months later, Bob Dylan is back in the studio.\n\n♪ People call, say \"Beware doll ♪ \"You're bound to fall\" ♪ You thought they were all kiddin' you ♪ DYLAN: At this point, his switch to electric music has already alienated some fans, at the same time created a whole new audience.\n\nThe resulting album, Highway 61 Revisited is Dylan's first fully realized rock album.\n\n♪ Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby ♪ Can't buy no thrill ♪ I've been up all night, baby ♪ Leanin' on the windowsill ♪ Well, if I die on top

record album covers were made.\n\nToday we're going to look at Bob Dylan's Bringing It All back Home.\n\nNow, today I'm on Minetta Street in Greenwich Village, the center of the folk movement, and I'm standing next to what used to be called The Commons.\n\nAnd in 1962, Dylan wrote Blowin' in the Wind right here.\n\nNow, back in that era, he was a scruffy looking kid who just blew in from the Midwest, and he would be photographed that way.\n\nBut three years later, he's a changed guy.\n\nRock 'n' roll has come.\n\nThe Beatles have come, The Rolling Stones have come.\n\nNew fashions have come.\n\nWhen he put out this album, he's dressed like a country squire.\n\nHe's in the middle of a nice, beautiful house next to a beautiful woman, he's got a Persian cat.\n\nBasically, what he's trying to do here is say, \"I'm past the folk movement.\n\n\"I'm moving on.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, half the record is acoustic, that's the old world, and half is electric.\n\nRight here, this is Sally Grossman.\n\nBob's manager was Albert Grossman and that was his wife.\n\nThis photograph is taken on the Grossman's estate up in Bearsville, New York, which is just west of Woodstock.\n\nHow many pictures did you take like this?\n\nTen.\n\nAnd how did you decide on this particular shot?\n\n-The only one in which the cat was looking at the lens.\n\n-[CHUCKLES] How'd you get that yellow circle of light?\n\nAs I explained to Bob that what would happen if we do this effect, -we will have things blurry and moving... -Yeah.\n\n...but you won't be moving because you're the center.\n\nYou know what's going on.\n\nBut around you, there's the turning of the world.\n\nAlso the turning of the record.\n\nAny reason why you put Dylan's own album in the back?\n\nJust kind of like his history, is that it?\n\nMy back pages.\n\nKRAMER: Bob put a lot of things in that had some meaning for him.\n\nBob Dylan with Daniel Kramer, they spent about three hours going through the house, just picking up all sorts of old stuff, including the record album and, you know, movies.\n\nAnd then, you know, like old world paintings.\n\nHe's got these pink cufflinks.\n\nThey were a present to him by Joan Baez.\n\nAnd he's got, you know, a lot of the objects of his past, including one of his old albums in the middle.\n\nHi, I'm Bob Egan of PopSpots, and on my website, I searched down where famous record album covers were done.\n\nToday I'm sitting on the front steps of where Bob Dylan lived for two years, starting in 1961.\n\nToday we're going to go look at the location of Highway 61 Revisited.\n\nBob lived here and he took this photograph right down these steps, down the street, right over to the corner of Jones Street.\n\nThey probably walked right by this spot, where they took the shot for Freewheelin' several years before.\n\nSo now follow me and we're gonna go see the rest of where the other part of the shoot was for Highway 61.\n\nThe street corner at Sixth Avenue and West Fourth Street.\n\nAnd where they went, this place called O' Henry's.\n\nAnd it was a famous, old fashioned, you know, kind of barbershop-quartet-era type restaurant that was located right here.\n\nAfter lunch, Bob and Daniel went up to Gramercy Park.\n\nSo, I'm always on the lookout for different locations, you know, where album covers were done and I saw a book that said that Janis Joplin used to sit on the front steps of the building where it was taken, and look out at Gramercy Park.\n\nWhen I found that Janis Joplin had been at Albert Grossman's apartment, I zoomed in on the door and I said, \"This is the same door.\"\n\nI couldn't believe it because the whole time that I was thinking about this album, I thought that it was done indoors inside of a stage, because it looks like it's kind of like a theater arch on the right hand side.\n\nSo I was... My mind was blown when it turns out that it's outdoors after all this time.\n\nThis is a place where Dylan stayed for, you know, long periods of time.\n\nWhen they got here, Dylan said, \"I want to go in and have you take a picture \"using my new Triumph T-shirt.\"\n\nSo he went and got the Triumph T-shirt and he sat down.\n\nUsually, you have a plan, especially for a cover.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd this wasn't the plan.\n\nThis was kind of all naked here.\n\nSo I asked Neuwirth if he'd stand here.\n\nSo I grabbed my camera and I said, \"Bob, hold this camera.\"\n\nNow, once he did that, it seems like something's going on.\n\nNot that we're taking a picture, but there's a making of a picture.\n\nThere's a photographer, he's got his camera.\n\nThis wasn't the plan.\n\nThis wasn't even expected that we would do a picture like this.\n\nKramer then took two different pictures and one of the pictures... You know, the last picture of the day that they shot was the one that became the album cover.\n\n♪ And have it on Highway 61 ♪ This is Bob Egan from PopSpots.\n\nIt's a website where I track down where famous record album covers were done.\n\nToday we're gonna look at where Blonde On Blonde from 1966, Bob Dylan's album, was photographed.\n\nStanding next to Jerry Schatzberg, who took that photograph.\n\nThis is your studio.\n\nIt was right up here.\n\nDylan picked you and one of your assistants up.\n\nAnd where did you go to take the picture?\n\nWhat I remember was the Meatpacking District downtown.\n\n-Okay, that's about 14th Street.\n\n-Possibly.\n\nWay over on the west side.\n\nLet's go check it out.\n\nWe're going to the Meatpacking District because I know that I photographed Dylan there for Blonde on Blonde.\n\nOr I think I photographed him there.\n\nWe're just trying to discover where because they've gentrified the areas so much.\n\nWe're hoping to uncover the mystery.\n\nTell me exactly why the pictures are blurred on the cover.\n\nIt was pretty cold out, you know.\n\nI know all the critics, everybody trying to figure, \"Oh, they were trying to do a drug shot or something.\"\n\nIt's not true.\n\nIt was February.\n\nHe was wearing just that jacket.\n\nI was wearing something similar.\n\nThe two of us were really cold.\n\nAnd to his credit, he's the one that chose that photograph.\n\nSomeplace in here might be the building, but it's totally disguised now.\n\nSo far, this is the closest thing that I've seen in all these years.\n\nThey covered over the brick here.\n\nIt could be this building, too, without this top.\n\nI think this building looks very possible.\n\nIt's been a good experience for me because I really thought that the building would be torn down.\n\nNow I think that it might be up here somewhere.\n\n-Still might be up... -I think the job is up to you now.\n\n-I'll see you.\n\nThanks, guys.\n\n-Okay.\n\n♪ I'm pledging my time to you ♪ Hopin' you'll come through, too... ♪ ♪ Ain't it just like the night ♪ To play tricks when you're tryin' to be quiet?\n\n♪ We sit here stranded ♪ Though we're all doin' our best to deny it ♪ And Louise holds a handful of rain ♪ Temptin' you to defy it ♪ Lights flicker from the opposite loft ♪ In this room the heat pipes, they cough ♪ The country music station plays soft ♪ But there's nothing Really nothing to turn off ♪ Just Louise and her lover so entwined ♪ And these visions of Johanna ♪ That conquer my mind ♪ The fiddler now speaks ♪ To the princess who's pretending to care for him ♪ He says, \"Name me someone that's not a parasite ♪ \"And I'll say a prayer for him\" ♪ And like Louise always says ♪ \"Ya can't look at much can ya, man?\"\n\n♪ As she prepares for him ♪ Madonna, she still has not showed ♪ And we see the empty cage now corrode ♪ Where her cape of the stage once had flowed ♪ The peddler he steps to the road ♪ Everything's gone which was owed ♪ He examines the nightingale's cold ♪ Still written on a fish truck that loads ♪ My conscience explodes ♪ The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain ♪ And these visions of Johanna ♪ Are all that remain ♪ -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -[RHYTHMIC CLAPPING] MAN: The big show special!\n\nDYLAN: Well, if it isn't the Hunchback of Notre Dame himself.\n\nHow's it going to sound tonight?\n\n-[CHUCKLES] -MAN: Great.\n\nBetter than it has in days.\n\nINTERVIEWER: Well, what was life like on the road then?\n\n-You know, on that tour?\n\n- ALDERSON: Hectic.\n\nHard, sleepless, driving.\n\nCrazy.\n\n[CHUCKLES] [CROWD SHOUTING] You talking to me?\n\nCome up here and say that.\n\nDYLAN: It was the worst thing anyone could go through, man.\n\nCan't even hear the guitar to put it in tune.\n\nThere's something wrong with the sound system.\n\nIt has got to be fixed.\n\nALDERSON: It never occurred to me to question it.\n\nI was just doing it.\n\nThey asked me to do it and I did it.\n\n[CHUCKLES] -You can follow him.\n\n-On the other side.\n\n-Show him what side.\n\n-On the other side.\n\nYou want me to show you where I'm plugged in?\n\nI'll show you where I'm plugged in, over here.\n\nI was always about the music.\n\nI was never about the mechanics of being a sound man.\n\nSo if the music was good, I was happy.\n\n♪ He looks so truthful ♪ Is this how he feels ♪ As he tries to peel the moon and expose it?\n\n♪ I can't...

wires.\n\nALDERSON: I lived in a fifth floor walk-up on Bleecker Street, right across the street from where the Village Gate was.\n\nAnd I just hung out in the Village.\n\nAnd I met Bob for the first time when he was just playing folk music and hanging out.\n\nMy friend introduced me to the new owners of the Gaslight.\n\nThey had me put in the sound system, and then somebody said, \"Well, Dylan's going to premiere a bunch of songs after hours \"and you should come and tape it.\"\n\nThe atmosphere was so wonderful in the Gaslight.\n\nAnd it had a special quality that studio recordings could never have.\n\n♪ Oh, where have you been my blue-eyed son?\n\n♪ Where have you been my darling young one?\n\n♪ It was just overwhelming.\n\nI mean, I had seen all kinds of people perform, and nobody gave me chills like that.\n\nNothing even came close to it.\n\nTito, listen, we seem to have a problem.\n\nALDERSON: I'd done a lot of live sound work for Grossman.\n\nWhen it came time for Dylan to go on tour, Grossman asked me to build the sound system and I said yes.\n\nI need an electrician.\n\nMy power's all gone.\n\nIt's Richard's power, man.\n\nCome on.\n\nALDERSON: I fit perfectly into that situation because I was really a kind of hi-fi purist as far as sound is concerned.\n\nDYLAN: Richard's power.\n\nGive him his power back.\n\nLet's have the power.\n\nI had no rehearsals with Dylan because I was busy getting the gear together and setting it up.\n\nI built the sound system.\n\nI had to make up the tables and I had to connect everything and I had to put it into the road cases and get it on the plane.\n\nIt was shipped to Honolulu.\n\nThe first time I used the whole sound system was on the stage in Honolulu.\n\nAnd I was still soldering wires on the stage in Stockholm.\n\nI remember that very well.\n\nJust give me time to get across to the other side.\n\nI mean, I barely had time to get everything set up at every venue we were at.\n\nI knew that he had been performing electric, but I had no idea that the second half was going to be what it turned out to be.\n\n♪ Once upon a time you dressed so fine ♪ You threw the bums a dime in your prime ♪ Didn't you?\n\n♪ Richard.\n\nALDERSON: Everybody knew that they came to see the Bob Dylan that they were expecting.\n\nRock 'n' roll was something that no one expected.\n\nThere was a lot of booing.\n\nI mean, it was practically everywhere we went.\n\nThe audiences were hostile.\n\nAnd the band responded to the hostility of the audience by playing more aggressively.\n\n♪ You walk into the room ♪ With your pencil in your hand ♪ You see somebody naked ♪ And you say \"Who is that man?\"\n\n♪ The audience reaction, that was mystifying... to everybody.\n\nIt was mystifying to me.\n\nI can remember, like, \"Why doesn't everybody think this stuff is as great as I do?\"\n\n[CHUCKLES] The tapings began when we were in Europe because Bob wanted to make a movie.\n\n♪ I'd stand by her roil ♪ In the lonely water ♪ I've stood there many times before this, you see ALDERSON: He wanted to make kind of a nouvelle vague movie of the whole process.\n\nNobody ever thought that those tapes would ever be issued in the way they're being issued.\n\nMAN: All the stuff that came from Paris is still being cleared through customs.\n\nThere's nothing here?\n\n-I can't believe it.\n\n-ALDERSON: It's a 7:30 show.\n\n-Nothing is there now?\n\n-That's right.\n\nJust the stuff that was left here.\n\nTwo speakers and the organ, and that's all set up.\n\nThe stage is all set up, but there's nothing else there.\n\nThe gear was just the gear that I was used to using.\n\nIt was good microphones.\n\nThey were all individually mic'ed.\n\nThere was one microphone for everybody, maybe two microphones for Bob.\n\nDYLAN: Thank you.\n\nALDERSON: There wasn't any theory.\n\nThere wasn't any map to follow about how you mic an electric band.\n\nIt was just the way the music sounded on stage.\n\nThere was all one mix, so I had to compromise.\n\nI mean, most of the concern was about the music and about the performances, and the recordings were just whatever went out into the hall.\n\nWe'd all listen to the tapes afterwards.\n\nI made some changes and it definitely got better.\n\nHe was singing wonderfully and performing wonderfully, and the songs were very exciting, and I was wrapped up in that.\n\nI don't know.\n\nYou put good microphones up in front of good music and it sounds good.\n\n♪ Yes, but the joke was on me ♪ There was nobody even there to call my bluff ♪ I'm going back to New York City ♪ I do believe I've had enough ♪ ALDERSON: I mean, obviously, the musicians played their asses off.\n\nIt wasn't even like the studio recordings or like the performance at Newport because Mickey Jones was a much louder drummer and much more aggressive drummer than anybody else that had played with him before.\n\nAnd it drove the music harder.\n\nIt made Robbie play some of the greatest stuff he ever played in his life.\n\n[CROWD CHEERING] The Paris show was problematic for any number of reasons.\n\n[STRUMMING] [TUNING] You see, my electric guitar never goes out of tune.\n\n[CROWD LAUGHS] ALDERSON: Bob took forever tuning his guitar, I think, just to irritate everybody.\n\nHe took like 20 minutes to tune his guitar.\n\nThe audience was hostile from the get-go.\n\n-[CHUCKLES] -[CROWD SHOUTING] Oh, I love you.\n\n[LAUGHS DRYLY] You're all so wonderful.\n\nALDERSON: They had an attitude about America already, that we were a bunch of fascist warmongers.\n\nThey opened the second half with the biggest American flag that Bob could find in Paris.\n\nAnd the audience didn't get the joke at all.\n\n♪ Tell me, momma ♪ Tell me, momma ♪ Tell me, momma, what is it?\n\n♪ What's wrong with you this time?\n\n♪ ALDERSON: It was kind of dismissed.\n\nThe recordings weren't very important.\n\nIt broke my heart.\n\nAnd Columbia just mishandled it because they wanted to use their tapes.\n\nAnd they'd sent expensive crews over.\n\nAnd the fact that Bob wanted to use my recording was not compatible with their desires.\n\nI think Grossman told me to take the tapes to Columbia and turn them over, and that was it.\n\nI never saw them again.\n\nI wanted the tapes to sound good.\n\nI don't know why because... [LAUGHS] I didn't know till now that they would ever become anything.\n\nAnd I'm glad that it's getting appreciated after all this time.\n\n♪ Just Louise ♪ And her lover so entwined ♪ And these visions of Johanna ♪ That conquer my mind ♪ NARRATOR: The year is 1967.\n\nIt's winter in West Saugerties, a small town about a two-hour drive north of Manhattan.\n\nHere, Bob Dylan is laid up recovering from a motorcycle accident, a canceled tour and the newfound pressures of fame.\n\n\"Escaping the rat race,\" Dylan said.\n\nHis touring group lived nearby.\n\nThey're called The Hawks, but we'd soon come to know them as \"The Band.\"\n\n♪ With another tale to tell ♪ And you know that we shall meet again... NARRATOR: Together with Bob Dylan in the basement of a little country house called Big Pink, they start recording originals, country, folk and rockabilly classics, song sketches and ideas.\n\nOver the course of a year, they have reels of new songs, but none of it would see the light of day.\n\nNo, these were demos made to hand over to Dylan's publishing company.\n\nMusic for other artists to record.\n\nThe cover versions come almost overnight.\n\nAnd what happens next surprises everyone.\n\n♪ If your memory serves you well ♪ I was goin' to... NARRATOR: The songs, they spark a public demand.\n\nThey want the originals.\n\nDemo tapes recorded in a country basement have found a following.\n\nAnd by 1969 the first bootleg of the modern rock 'n' roll age appears called Great White Wonder.\n\nThe album compiles the basement recordings and some lesser known Dylan tracks into one album.\n\nMore bootlegs follow more demand, and soon an underground industry is born.\n\nEventually, in 1975, Dylan and The Band bend to the demand for the real deal and they release The Basement Tapes.\n\nThe record is an instant success, but you know how it goes.\n\nThe fans, [CHUCKLES] they want more, to hear it all, to know it all.\n\n♪ ...next of kin ♪ This wheel shall explode... NARRATOR: It's been 47 years since Bob Dylan and The Band made that two-hour drive north of New York City to Big Pink.\n\nAnd the fans [CHUCKLES] were still curious about The Basement Tapes.\n\nAre there more hidden reels to be discovered?\n\nWhat do the original recordings really sound like?\n\nForty-seven years we've wondered, and now we get to find out.\n\n♪ This wheel's on fire ♪ It's rolling down the road ♪ Best notify my next of kin ♪ This wheel shall explode ♪ GREIL MARCUS: In early '68, this guy calls me up and we do the equivalent of a dope deal, except there's no money involved.\n\nHe surreptitiously hands me this cassette and said, \"Don't tell anybody where you got this.\"\n\nAnd I take it home and listen to it and call up all my friends and they come over and we all listen to it, completely awestruck.\n\n[HARMONICA PLAYING] CLINTON HEYLIN: To me, it's always been the Holy Grail to actually fondle the original reel.\n\nTo actually... To say, \"Yeah, this is it.\n\n\"This is the real thing.\"\n\nThe goal was to get as much out of the tapes as possible and to allow you to be on the stairs that led down to the basement so you could hear, \"What are those guys playing?\"\n\nYou're in the room.\n\nYou're right there.\n\nYou feel people breathing.\n\nEverything that's been mythologized or turned into legend on behalf of what happened in that Woodstock basement in the summer of '67 is true.\n\nThe history of the reels themselves.\n\nIt's like a detective story.\n\nRobbie told me he remembered Bob saying, \"We ought to destroy this stuff.\n\nWe ought to just erase it.\"\n\nWhat if we recorded songs that could never be released?\n\nWhat would they sound like?\n\nThat's what you're hearing.\n\nI think The Basement Tapes stars.\n\nI think there's no question with that world tour of '65-'66.\n\nHEYLIN: They were unbelievably grueling shows because, of course, everywhere Bob went, he was badly received by sections of the audience.\n\nAt some shows, a large section of the audience turned on him.\n\n[CROWD SHOUTING] Usually during the electric set.\n\nDYLAN: This is a folk song.\n\nThis is a folk song.\n\nI wanna sing a folk song now.\n\n[CROWD CHEERING] People did feel that something had been taken away from them.\n\nOr something beautiful had been destroyed by Bob Dylan leaving the music of the people behind and going for the charts.\n\nIt's taken as this outrage, as this sellout, as this betrayal.\n\nDylan talked about it afterwards, he talked about it with a sense of great defiance.\n\nDon't you think your first records were much better than the ones that you do now?\n\nWho said that?\n\nMARCUS: The sense of, you know... \"This is the music I'm making, this is the music I want to sing, \"this is the music I want to play.\n\n\"If you don't like it, stay away.\"\n\nDidn't you boo me last night?\n\n-I didn't, I didn't.\n\nPlease, just a minute.\n\n-We didn't boo you, Bob.\n\nDYLAN: Well, I want the names of all of people that booed me.\n\nDYLAN: First half, when they're all so quiet.\n\nI'll just break it, right?\n\nI'll play four or five songs.\n\nThey just don't make a sound.\n\nAll of a sudden, \"Boo.\"\n\n[LAUGHTER] Boo.\n\nMARCUS: Robbie Robertson, Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, Garth Hudson Levon Helm, they become Bob Dylan's band.\n\nThese guys are now a band of brothers.\n\nThis brings these people together.\n\nBy the time they reach the United Kingdom in the spring of April 1966, they're meeting audiences that made the angry audiences they faced before look like nothing.\n\nThis is a war.\n\nPeople come in organized groups in order to stage walkouts.\n\nIn other words, they're paying money not to see the show.\n\nWe paid to see a flipping folk singer, not a... Not a big loser.\n\nMAN: Judas!\n\n[CROWD SHOUTING] I don't believe you.\n\nYou're a liar.\n\nMARCUS: The effects were apocalyptic.\n\nIn Torrance it's July '65, with people booing him.\n\nYou can't do that for a year without it getting to you at some point.\n\nEffectively, you can carry on for so long like that.\n\nBut when you get to the end, there's a crash.\n\nAnd the crash can be metaphoric, or, as proved to be the case in Dylan's life, literal.\n\nGRIFFIN: After that long, grueling tour, he was going to take a break.\n\nJune 1st, 1966.\n\nHe was going to kick back up at the Yale Bowl on August 2, 1966, another whole leg of shows, and Dylan went back to Woodstock to relax.\n\nThey're supposed to be going back on the road to promote his new album, which had only come out a couple of weeks before the accident, Blonde on Blonde.\n\nExcept Bob didn't want to go back on the road.\n\nHe decides, \"I'm not going back to this crazy life, \"at least for a while.\n\nI'm gone.\"\n\nThis is 1966.\n\nHe doesn't go back on the road again till 1974.\n\nThat's a long time.\n\nDylan took a year-a-half between Blonde on Blonde and John Wesley Harding.\n\nPeople referred to this as the period of silence.\n\nAs if is that this was some kind of a strange violation of the rules of time and space.\n\nIn record business terms, it was.\n\nGRIFFIN: The guy's 25 years old.\n\nHe's had this motorcycle accident.\n\nHe has to come up with some sort of a battle plan.\n\nAnd this is one reason I find him so infatuating.\n\nI think in a way, he does it.\n\nHe knows he wants to regress but he doesn't know exactly how.\n\nWhen he finally gets better, I think it was that point that Dylan had the moment of, \"What am I doing with my life?\n\n\"Could we not stop for a moment and reassess where we are \"and where I, Bob Dylan, want to go?\"\n\nMARCUS: Dylan is saying, \"No, I'm not giving you a new album.\n\n\"No, I'm not going back on tour.\n\n\"No, no.\n\n\"I've got a note from my doctor says I don't have to do this.\n\n\"I can stay home.\"\n\nAnd that's what he did.\n\nHEYLIN: This is January '67.\n\nSo they have been recording and Bob had ideas for a film.\n\nOriginally, the idea of getting the guys to come up to Woodstock was actually to work on that.\n\nGRIFFIN: And they're initially filmed backing Tiny Tim singing in the snow one morning.\n\nAnd then they continue on with other things.\n\nMARCUS: And they work on the movie or they don't work on the movie.\n\nAnd they're bored.\n\nWhat are they going to do?\n\nThat's the way these songs came together.\n\nHEYLIN: Initially, it was just that, getting back into playing music.\n\nNot making music, but playing music.\n\nGRIFFIN: Initial sessions are held in the Red Room, Bob Dylan's own house.\n\nAnd in typical Bob Dylan fashion, I can report to you now that the Red Room wasn't red.\n\nIt had previously been red, but it had been painted by the Dylans.\n\nThe point of the Red Room sessions is it's where Bob Dylan starts to get his mojo back.\n\n♪ Ooh, baby, ooh... ♪ They got all this equipment together to record this stuff, and I can just see all The Hawks going...

Next.\n\nIt's not a great recording.\n\nSome of the basement tape songs, they're running fast.\n\nThey didn't cut the record particularly well.\n\nBut how could they?\n\nThey were enthusiastic amateurs that loved Bob Dylan.\n\nWho would have dreamed that in Sweden, a guy took their stuff, added a couple things and put out another one?\n\nWho would've known a guy in New York would have, you know... And this whole thing was like throwing a pebble in the placid lake and the waves go like this... People start bootlegging the bootleg.\n\nHEYLIN: Almost immediately, and possibly even simultaneously, other people who'd got hold of the full acetate started issuing just the acetate.\n\nAnd the proliferation was so extreme that there's no way of cataloging who was doing what.\n\nGRIFFIN: It didn't just start a minor Bob Dylan fan club.\n\nIt started a whole bootleg industry.\n\nMARCUS: There was a cover story in Rolling Stone by Jan Wenner saying Bob Dylan's Basement Tape, and that's what it was referred to, as The Tape, The Basement Tape, not \"tapes,\" should be released.\n\nAnd he made an argument about how this music not only was terrific, it was a different way of looking at the world, and it had to be released.\n\nAnd why in the world wasn't it?\n\nDidn't make any sense.\n\nIt was a secret hidden in plain sight.\n\nAll these songs were on the radio so why not put it out?\n\nGood question.\n\nBy 1975, the band needed a boost, and I think putting this stuff out was a way to make that happen.\n\nPlus, the music was obviously stuff that the world ought to hear.\n\nEven if Bob Dylan said he didn't understand why it made the top 10, he thought everybody already had them.\n\nHEYLIN: And Bob agreed to let them put it out.\n\nGRIFFIN: I remember John Rockwell in New York Times said it was the greatest record of the Western popular music sphere, period.\n\nThat's a paraphrasing.\n\nBut he did, he wrote that.\n\nWhen the two LP-set came out in 1975, it should have, in theory, one might think quench the thirst of the public for The Basement Tapes... A-ha!\n\nPeople are going, \"What the hell is this?\"\n\nProbably the two most famous songs on The Basement Tapes are missing.\n\nI mean I Should Be Released and Mighty Quinn are not on.\n\nGRIFFIN: If anything, it was like putting kerosene on that flame and The Basement Tapes myth got another rocket boost.\n\nHEYLIN: Very quickly... people realized that, \"This isn't it.\n\n\"We need more.\"\n\n\"There must be more.\n\nCan't there be more?\"\n\n\"Sure, there's more.\n\nWe hope there's more.\"\n\nAnd the fans got out there and doing their detective work soon found out these guys recorded for months.\n\nAnybody else, the two-LP set would have come out, \"Oh, great, that's what they did.\n\nThis is great.\n\nNow we've got it.\"\n\nBut the Dylan fans, they began to dig, dig, dig, and they found out there was a lot more stuff done there, and it took 40-something years, but here we are.\n\n♪ Ain't no more cane on the Brazos... ♪ Stuff came out in dribs and drabs on LPs that included tons of other stuff.\n\nOn tapes that people passed from hand to hand.\n\nThen in 1986, several reel to reels turned up recordings of Dylan and the band doing reams and reams of country and folk and all this amazing material that nobody knew about.\n\nAnd they came out on two famous double albums, bootleg.\n\nThose tapes originally came from an ex-roadie of the band.\n\nAnd then, six years later, another ex-roadie of the band helped himself to another bunch of tapes that were lying around in Garth's locker and released those.\n\nSuddenly, the scale of the amount of material that had been recorded becomes more than one could necessarily comprehend.\n\n♪ Down the street the dogs are barkin' ♪ And the day is growing dark ♪ 'Cause I'm one too many mornings ♪ And a thousand miles ♪ Behind ♪ From the crossroads of my doorstep ♪ My eyes, they begin to fade BERKOWITZ: One Too Many Mornings with Richard and Bob singing.\n\nThe Richard part has been inaudible.\n\nYou cannot hear it because the left channel was recorded so low, and we're able to raise and level the channels and then get rid of a lot of the swirl of the hiss on top so that their voices could be equal.\n\nNow, for the first time on this set, you can hear Richard and Dylan sing that song at the same time.\n\n♪ Behind... ♪ We finally are getting the real basement tapes because they're off the real reels.\n\nAnd even in the instances where they can't get access to the real reels, nothing is more than first generation.\n\n♪ ...someone must explain ♪ That as long as it takes to do this...

he called me one day and asked me if I would help him try out a studio.\n\nTrying out the studio turned out to be recording Self Portrait.\n\nThe studio that I went to was one of the Columbia Studios, so I'm sure he'd been in there many times before.\n\nI'm sure of that now, I wasn't then.\n\n-Bob?\n\n-DYLAN: Yeah.\n\nBROMBERG: Let's just take this one.\n\nYou ready?\n\n[GUITAR PLAYING] ♪ Down in

we're working on a session, Bob is specifically always Bob.\n\nI was there, I think, for three, four days in a row.\n\nAnd it was different than the other sessions I had done.\n\nI thought the album

very critical of it, have realized that there's some marvelous things, they just weren't the things that they wanted to get out of a Bob Dylan album.\n\nSelf Portrait, you know, stood by itself.\n\nIt was very different.\n\nAs far as I could tell, New Morning was a reaction to the criticism of Self Portrait.\n\nIt was more like another album, and it was very comfortable, and that's why it was hurried, if you will.\n\nBut it wasn't really hurried.\n\nDidn't rush anything.\n\nWhen he got through, that's when...\n\nWhen he said, \"That's it, Bob,\" that's when it came out.\n\nAt the time, there was a brief...\n\nFlirtation with writing the songs for a Broadway show.\n\nI once accompanied him to Archibald MacLeish's house where they had a discussion about that.\n\nAnd it was some sort of collaboration between the two of them.\n\nAnd then he decided not to do that.\n\nBut he had written the songs.\n\nThat's what comprised New Morning.\n\n♪ Time passes slowly up here in the daylight ♪ We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right ♪ Like a cloud drifting over that covers the day ♪ Time passes slowly and fades away ♪ I was hearing the songs for the very first time.\n\nAnd sometimes those first times through are what was on this album.\n\nI never heard Bob do rehearsal with the band.\n\nHe knew what he wanted.\n\nHe didn't necessarily tell us, but he knew.\n\nI told everybody, \"Never quit playing.\"\n\nIf you quit playing, get some boot briefcase, and your hat and go out the door and wave goodbye at us.\n\nIt's like taking off in a rocket ship to ever go in with Bob Dylan.\n\nI was not at the sessions that George Harrison did with Bob.\n\nHe was very careful about working out every note that he played.\n\nBob is very spontaneous, and he he wants you to...\n\nHe wants to hear what your first thought is.\n\nSo the sessions that they did must have been very different.\n\nIt was nice to hear him improvising, and I thought I could hear at a point, I thought I could hear him thinking, \"What's he doing now?\"\n\n[LAUGHS] ♪ Looking for a guru ♪ Working on a guru ♪ Working on a guru ♪ Before the sun goes down ♪ Play it again.\n\nWe had cut New Morning, and I said to Bob, \"I have a really good horn arrangement for this.\n\n\"Can I do that?\"\n\nAnd he said yeah.\n\nAnd I brought in the horn session for New Morning.\n\nAnd he kept just the French horn playing a downward scale.\n\nAll the rest of it, he said, \"No, I'm just going to erase it.\"\n\n♪ So happy just to be alive ♪ Underneath the sky of blue ♪ On this new morning ♪ New morning ♪ On this new morning ♪ I'm so delighted that horns were still there so I could mix it, properly.\n\nSame thing happened with the strings in Sign on the Window.\n\nOn the original session, I played an organ solo.\n\nAnd my intention was to take the organ out altogether.\n\nHe kept that.\n\nAnd threw all those strings out.\n\n♪ Looks like a-nothing but rain ♪ Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street ♪ Hope that it don't sleet ♪ I love the vocals.\n\nThe way he sings the word \"sleet\" is amazing.\n\nHe puts \"sleet\" in his voice.\n\nThose two tracks specifically I've coveted for 40 years.\n\nAnd then to find that I could remix them because he didn't erase them, it was great to come back to it and sit at my desk and listen to the isolated vocal and go, \"Boy, this is great.\"\n\nNew Morning I thought was a great time of his singing.\n\nI don't think that Bob has gotten credit for what a great singer he is.\n\nHe is a great singer.\n\nThere's a difference between having a great voice and being a great singer.\n\nThe man can put across a song like no one else can.\n\nIt just comes through.\n\n♪ Sylvie came here Wednesday ♪ She came this morning by the light of

been asked to play on those records, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nThat's the way it was.\n\nIt was a complete and utter joyous trip.\n\nBob is the equivalent of William Shakespeare.\n\nWhat Shakespeare did in his time, Bob does it in his time.\n\nYou think of all this huge period of time in which he's continued to deliver, it's pretty amazing.\n\nDown the curve and around the bend, he came.\n\nAnd it'll never end now 'cause he's been on this roller coaster ride ever since he left Minnesota.\n\nHe's been brutalized, sunrised, baptized in the waters of the Village.\n\nStill, it goes on from Soho to Moscow to Oslo.\n\nThey speak of this trip, this battleship who sailed in the harbor of Tin Pan Alley and sank it with his Subterranean Homesick Blues.\n\nThere is none but one Bob Dylan.\n\n♪ Someday everything is gonna be different ♪ When I paint that masterpiece ♪ When Bob was signed in '61, he really changed the whole image of Columbia Records.\n\nColumbia was a MOR company.\n\nIt was sing-along with Mitch, with Johnny Mathis.\n\nIt was the tried and true.\n\nAnd suddenly Bob came along with a revolutionary outlook for a new generation.\n\nWhat's wonderful about having Bob back now is he tried making it away from the company, and he found out that Columbia was his home.\n\nAnd I think the album is going to prove how different Bob is when he's completely comfortable with his surroundings.\n\nThan he was, last year.\n\nI get phone calls every day.\n\nReviewers wants to hear it and certain retail accounts where the clerks, are aware that it's going on, have called.\n\nIt's just become everywhere.\n\nThere's a great deal of anticipation and a great deal of excitement about this new Blood on the Tracks album.\n\nI was in the dentist chair some morning...\n\nSome afternoon in May.\n\nI got a frantic call from Owen Stegalstein's secretary saying, \"John, Bob Dylan is in the building.\n\n\"Owen wants to know if you could come right over.\"\n\nI said, \"I can't come right over.\n\nI'll be over as soon as I can.\"\n\nI guess they called me because some 13 years ago, I was the guy who sort of stuck my neck out and signed Bobby originally to Columbia.\n\nAnd they thought it might be a nice idea if I were around at some certain point in this thing, so...\n\nI got back to the office about 45 minutes later.\n\nAnd Bobby and Owen were just finishing what looked like an extremely successful and friendly talk.\n\nAnd they were going into Goddard Lieberson's office.\n\nAnd Dylan has always had a sort of very special respect for Lieberson.\n\nAnd they came in and Bobby was very effusive with Goddard.\n\nAnd Goddard looked up at Bobby and said, \"Well, Bobby, same temple, new rabbi\".\n\nWhen Bob came into the studio this time, he was prepared.\n\nNot only was he prepared, he was marvelously certain of what exactly he wanted to do.\n\nWhen I used to record Bob in '61 and '62, it was a very different story.\n\nBob would come up, he was writing about 11 to 15 songs a week in those days.\n\nAnd every time he had something, he wanted to put it on tape.\n\nAnd it was simple in those days.\n\nThat was before the time when people had to pay for studio time, editing.\n\nAll the rest of the things that happen now days, and this didn't cost Bob anything.\n\nEvery time he had something new, I'd put 'em in.\n\nHe was sort of sloppy about the way he worked.\n\nWe had to build a special guard around the microphone because he popped so many P's.\n\nPoor George Kanawa, who was the engineer at that time, was going crazy.\n\nSo Bob had to work further away from a microphone.\n\nBut Bob, of course, was just absolutely unique, sensational, marvelous artist in those days.\n\nAnd he turned out to be even more of a unique, sensational and marvelous artist this time.\n\nBob's always coming up with a really unusual surprise.\n\nOn this one, he asked me to get in touch with Pete Hamill because we had talked about liner notes, and he said he wanted Pete Hamill to write the liner notes.\n\nAnd we made some maneuvers to contact Pete.\n\nIt was a little difficult at first.\n\nBob and Pete hit it off immediately.\n\nPete took notes and wrote incredible liner notes for the album.\n\nSo, we've got a really unusual merchandising support there.\n\nIt kind of explains a little bit about the music, a little bit about the society in which we live.\n\nAnd Bob's music is kind of a portrait on life.\n\nHe covers so many areas of music.\n\nFor example, his hard blues numbers like Meet Me in the Morning.\n\nPart of the album is acoustic.\n\nPart of it has Eric Weissberg's band.\n\nOn a few cuts, Buddy Cage from the New Riders plays steel guitar.\n\nAnd as a matter of fact, we should touch on some things that John had talked about, with other musicians or artists doing Bob's music.\n\nThe New Riders have recorded You Angel You.\n\nThey used Bob's rough lyric, as opposed to his finished lyric on the Planet Wave album.\n\nBut they did a Dylan tune.\n\nDave Mason recorded All Along the Watchtower.\n\nAnd Richie Havens, Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.\n\nSo people are still recording his music.\n\nNothing has changed.\n\nHe's evolving, it's all growing.\n\nAnd this album, there'll be tons of songs that people are going to record.\n\nMany artists will record the songs in Blood on the Tracks.\n\nThere's a tune called Idiot Wind, which you have to listen to.\n\nYou must listen to it several times to get the significance of it.\n\nThere's a tune, Lily Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts, which touches on some of the... You know, life is a gamble, type of life that we all lead.\n\nAnd the conflict between women, men, and just life in general.\n\nBut it kind of paints a picture, a story as it were that's very different than some of the things he's done before, and yet it's very familiar.\n\nSo...\n\nThe album has a continuity, a cohesiveness that's exciting.\n\nAnd there's an enthusiasm that just builds the difference of having a little bit of acoustic music and a bit of music with a band, steel guitar, organ, etcetera.\n\nKind of creates a contrast that in itself is exciting.\n\nI don't think Bob consciously plans this sort of thing.\n\nBut it came off beautifully, really came off beautifully.\n\nLet me tell you about this album.\n\nThis album, unlike any album that's cut with groups these days, was finished in five days and mixed in two days.\n\nNow this is, you know, absolutely unprecedented the way Columbia works nowadays.\n\nA Simon and Garfunkel album or a Bruce Springsteen album.\n\nThis is six or seven months in a studio of, you know, experimentation, of discarding this, adding that, overdubbing.\n\nNone of that with Bob.\n\nAnd this album has a flow that you won't find in any other album recorded in 1974.\n\nThe album cover is a cover that lends itself to everything, the merchandiser's dream.\n\nHis name is big, the title is big.\n\nHe has liner notes on the package.\n\nWe're going to be ready with point of purchase support before the album ships.\n\nWe'll have time-buys ready to run the day the album hits the stores.\n\nWe'll have all our print ads.\n\nWe've really done a job up-front on this album because Bob has allowed us the time in a very professional... \"Professional enthusiasm,\" I think, might be a good phrase.\n\nHe just loves being back, and he just knows that we can do the job for him, and it's going to be really exciting.\n\nAnd you'll get to hear the album.\n\nAnd when you hear the album, you know everything that John and I have said relates to an exciting future with Bob Dylan.\n\nThis album, of course, will get immediate airplay.\n\nThat's not unusual for Bob.\n\nI think where the difference comes here is this album will stay on the air for quite a while.\n\nAnd it's certainly accessible to Top 40 radio.\n\nPart of this enthusiasm for the new release is generated in the company.\n\nWe've played the tapes for in-house personnel, of course, and Larry Sloman wrote the interview in Rolling Stone, which you've probably all read by now.\n\nAnd part of what Larry talked about was that this is the Dylan that people have been hungering for.\n\nSo there have been some little rumbles of apprehension about, \"How are we going to sell a new Dylan album?\"\n\nWe've seen the problems electors had the way they handle it.\n\nI think we're unique.\n\nWe handle Bob differently.\n\nWe know Bob and we understand Bob.\n\nWe know what to do with his music.\n\nWe know how to handle the reaction to the airplay, and the reaction in the market place.\n\nSo we're going to go out there well-prepared, better prepared than we've ever been probably, and really do a number with this album.\n\nAnd it's going to be accepted.\n\nPeople are waiting for this album.\n\nNARRATOR : Over 2,000 concerts.\n\nSix hundred songs.\n\nForty-four albums.\n\nFive decades.\n\nOne artist.\n\n♪ Johnny's in the basement mixing up
