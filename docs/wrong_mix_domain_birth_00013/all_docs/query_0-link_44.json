        "text": "Bob Dylan spoke not a single word during a stellar performance at the Desert Trip music festival in Indio on Friday, but then you don’t win the Nobel Prize in Literature for your between-song banter, do you, Mr. Jones?\n\nThe legendary singer-songwriter on Thursday was named the 2016 Nobel laureate, and though he’s certainly an unexpected and controversial pick in some literary quarters — never before has a songwriter been so honored by the Swedish Academy — if anyone from the world of popular music deserved this, it’s Bob Dylan.\n\nBefore Dylan, lyrics were just words.\n\nAfter Dylan, there was poetry set to music in dozens of songs, from early works such as “Ballad of a Thin Man” and “Mr. Tambourine Man” to midperiod classics like “Tangled Up In Blue” or “Simple Twist Of Fate” and in more recent songs, including “High Water (For Charley Patton)” and “Love Sick.”\n\n“Bob Dylan writes poetry for the ear,” said Sarah Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, announcing the award. “But it’s perfectly fine to read his works as poetry.”\n\nHis work, said Danius and others, including Salman Rushdie, himself viewed as a possible Nobel winner this year, harks back to the ancient Greek bards, whose poetry was meant to be heard live.\n\n“It’s an extraordinary example of his brilliant way of rhyming and his pictorial thinking,” Danius said. “If you look back, far back, you discover Homer and Sappho, and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to. They were meant to be performed.\n\n“It’s the same way with Bob Dylan. But we still read Homer and Sappho. He can be read and should be read. He is a great poet in the grand English tradition. I know the music, and I’ve started to appreciate him much more now.\n\n“Today, I’m a lover of Bob Dylan.”\n\nI’m with her completely; you certainly can read Dylan’s lyrics and find literature, from the early, folk-inspired songs that carried on the social and political causes of a people’s troubadour to the later stream-of-consciousness impressionistic tales that required time to absorb and decipher, but Dylan never explained ’em.\n\nI’d also argue that hearing them with the music is always the better way to go. There, with his acoustic guitar as accompaniment or eventually with any of the ace rock bands that backed him later on, the repetitions common to song lyrics don’t slow the flow, and the instruments add feelings that words cannot express.\n\nIn other words, feel bad for Homer and Sappho that the Greeks didn’t have recording studios, but don’t discredit Dylan because he did.\n\nTwitter, the forum for public opinion nowadays, was hoppin’ all morning after the news broke. Besides Rushdie, who praised Dylan, 75, as a “brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition,” the novelist Joyce Carol Oates, who also has been mentioned as a contender for the prize, was equally supportive of him.\n\nBritish fantasy writer Philip Pullman praised Dylan in hopes that the door that has cracked open a bit for songwriters might continue to widen, tweeting: “Bob Dylan is a great choice for the Nobel Prize. One result might be to open the prize to genre fiction as well as the ‘literary’ sort.”\n\nOther writers were leery of the decision.\n\n“I’m a Dylan fan, but this is an ill-conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies,” wrote Irvine Welsh, the Scottish author of “Trainspotting,” who would surely win the\n\nDylan returns to Desert Trip tonight for the second weekend of the festival that also includes artists of the same generation, including Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, the Who and Roger Waters.\n\nUnlike his last few times through Southern California, when he played most songs from his Frank Sinatra-inspired albums of classic pop covers, at Desert Trip last week he gave the crowd what it wanted to hear: 11 of the 16 numbers he performed were drawn from classic albums such as “Blonde On Blonde,” “Highway 61 Revisited” and “Blood On The Tracks.”\n\nHe didn’t let them see him, though. After the sixth song the minimal video coverage of Dylan and his band was turned off for the rest of the show, black-and-white noir-tinged film clips filling the screens for the 75,000 or so who packed the Empire Polo Club.\n\nWill he mention the Nobel Prize on stage? I’d bet he doesn’t; it’s just not his style."
