        "text": "For those who love or have collected early Bob Dylan bootleg albums, an archive of never before published photographs of the young Dylan, when he first moved to New York City in the early 1960s. It was in late 1961, photographer Ted Russell recalls, that he first heard about an \"up-and-coming young fellow who was coming out with his first album.\" A freelance photographer on the lookout for good subjects, Russell was intrigued by a rave review from The New York Times of the raw-voiced folk singer. Russell’s subject was a twenty-year-old Bob Dylan, a young folk singer whom nobody knew, and Russell photographed Dylan in 1961. Bob Dylan is a window into the singer/songwriter who would go on to become one of America’s greatest musical treasures: the book contains photos of Dylan in his tiny Greenwich Village apartment, writing and practicing; snuggling with girlfriend Suze Rotolo; and performing at celebrated folk club Gerde’s. Bob Dylan is an important chronicle of the days just prior to Bob Dylan’s celebrity and the perfect tribute both for Dylan and rock history fans.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nTed Russell is an American photographer and photojournalist whose work has appeared on the covers of Life, Newsweek, Time, and New York magazines, to name only a few. Donovan is a Scottish folk singer and songwriter best known for his hit songs \"Catch the Wind,\" \"Sunshine Superman,\" and \"Mellow Yellow.\" In 2012, Donovan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Chris Murray is a writer and founder of Govinda Gallery, which represents some of the best rock music–related fine art photography and photographers in the world."
