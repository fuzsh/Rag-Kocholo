        "text": "(born 1941). From the early 1960s Bob Dylan was one of the most influential—and at times controversial—performers in American music. After emerging on the folk scene with politically charged anthems, he turned to rock and began writing more unconventional songs with lyrics that brought poetry to pop music. He went on to reinvent his sound and his persona several more times in a career that stretched over five decades. In 2016 he became the first singer and songwriter to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nDylan was born Robert Alan Zimmerman on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota. He grew up in the mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota, to which he moved with his family at age 6. Although at one time he told tales of having been a rebellious child who often ran away from home, Dylan later disavowed such stories. In reality he lived a fairly normal, middle-class childhood, during which he developed a love of music that inspired him to take up guitar, harmonica, and piano. Dylan formed a rock and roll band, the Golden Chords, as a freshman in high school. He briefly attended the University of Minnesota, where he began performing in coffeehouses as Bob Dylan, a name he took in honor of poet Dylan Thomas. He legally adopted the name several years later.\n\nDylan moved to New York City in 1961. His performances in Greenwich Village coffeehouses won him a cult following and soon caught the attention of John Hammond, who signed him to Columbia Records. His debut album, Bob Dylan (1962), consisted mostly of raw renditions of traditional folk songs. It was his second album, The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan (1963), that revealed Dylan as an exceptional talent. It featured his own compositions and included the protest songs “A Hard Rain’s Gonna Fall,” “Masters of War,” and “Blowin’ in the Wind.” The latter song became a huge hit for the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. The title song of Dylan’s next album, The Times They Are A-Changin’ (1964), was another instant anthem.\n\nDylan’s next album signaled a change in direction that would alienate much of his old audience while drawing in a whole new set of listeners. In place of protest songs, Another Side of Bob Dylan (1964) mainly featured music of a personal nature. His transition from folk music continued on Bringing It All Back Home (1965), the first Dylan album to include electric instruments. The folk rock group the Byrds had a number-one hit with their cover of “Mr. Tambourine Man” from that album. The single “Like a Rolling Stone” and the album from which it came, Highway 61 Revisited (1965), completed Dylan’s break from his folk past. He showcased his electric sound in his headlining set at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, where he was backed primarily by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After just three songs Dylan left the stage to a hail of booing, which has been interpreted as a response either to Dylan’s unexpectedly brief performance or to his supposed betrayal of folk music. This event is widely regarded as one of the pivotal moments in the history of rock music. On his 1965–66 tours with backing band the Hawks (later to become the Band), Dylan heard both cheers and boos from his sold-out audiences. Blonde on Blonde, released in 1966, completed a remarkable trio of albums and contained some of Dylan’s finest work.\n\nAfter a motorcycle accident in 1966, Dylan went into temporary seclusion. He reemerged with the stripped-down album John Wesley Harding (1968) and the mellow, country-influenced Nashville Skyline (1969). In 1973 Dylan scored a hit with “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” from the film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. His next studio album, Blood on the Tracks (1975), was hailed a return to lyrical form. It topped the Billboard album chart, as did Desire, released a year later. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Dylan again shifted gears, releasing three albums reflecting his conversion to born-again Christianity.\n\nDylan continued to record albums and tour through the 1980s, but both his impact and the quality of his work were diminished. A notable exception was the well-received album Oh Mercy (1989). It was the 1997 release Time Out of Mind, however, that was hailed as Dylan’s finest work since the 1970s. The album earned him three Grammy Awards, including album of the year. His next two studio albums, Love and Theft (2001) and Modern Times (2006), also won Grammys. His late-career revival continued with Together Through Life (2009), Tempest (2012), and two albums of standards popularized by Frank Sinatra, Shadows in the Night (2015) and Fallen Angels (2016). Meanwhile, Dylan performed steadily throughout the world on what became known as the Never Ending Tour, played for the pope at the Vatican (1997), released the autobiography Chronicles: Volume 1 (2004), and hosted the weekly Theme Time Radio Hour (2006–09)."
