        "text": "Bob Dylan and New Jersey have had a unique relationship over the years.\n\nYou see, there’s been an undue amount of intrigue when it comes to the Bard in Jersey — strange things seem to happen when he’s here. And he’ll be here Saturday, Nov. 17, when he plays the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City.\n\nMystery shows, phantom performances and run-ins with the law all have added to the Dylan mystique here in the Garden State.\n\nTo be fair, Dylan’s air of mystery does extend beyond our humble borders.\n\nMore: Remembering Jim Nabors: When Gomer Pyle sang Bob Dylan with hippies\n\n“Everything with Bob Dylan is just kind of mysterious and people are still trying to figure him out,” said Harold Lepidus, author of “Friends and Other Strangers: Bob Dylan Examined.” “When he came to New York, he was this scruffy kid and he called himself Dylan and no one knew his background. He said his parents were dead. He created this mythology. I don’t know how much people believed him, but he certainly was this interesting character.”\n\nA character people are still trying to figure out, even at 77 years old. A recent article in the Argus Leader determined that Dylan did not attend Washington High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in the 1950s.\n\nWhat we know for sure is that Dylan is playing Atlantic City as part of a Bob Dylan and his Band fall tour that includes seven shows, Nov. 23 to Dec. 1, at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, and Dec. 3 at the new Met venue, aka the Metropolitan Opera House, in Philadelphia.\n\nThere’s also a new box-set reissue of 1975’s landmark “Blood on the Tracks,” called “More Blood, More Tracks,” that’s just been released.\n\nSo let’s explore the Bob mystique here in Jersey to get us in the mood for our autumn of Dylan.\n\nBob Dylan and Johnny Cash at Rutgers in 1965\n\nMuch about Dylan is a mystery, and that includes his shows — especially concerts from the early part of his career.\n\nBut did Dylan play at Rutgers University’s College Avenue gym in 1965 with Johnny Cash in the audience? The answer is yes.\n\nDylan fan Michael Perlin, Class of ’66, was there. Perlin relayed his story to Lepidus in 2013.\n\n“He was for some time sure he had seen Bob Dylan at Rutgers in a concert that was not chronicled in any books or websites,” Lepidus said. “So he spent a lot of time doing research just because he’s a big Dylan fan and he wanted to help with the chronicling of Bob Dylan’s career.”\n\nMore: Johnny Cash kids to neo-Nazis: Don't put dad on your T-shirts\n\nPerlin unearthed articles about the show from Rutgers newspapers the Daily Targum and the Douglass Caellian, and he was able to track down other attendees of the show. He then contacted Lepidus for his Bob Dylan Examiner column, which makes up the content of “Friends and Other Strangers: Bob Dylan Examined.”\n\nThe Cash connection to the show originated from another source — a 1999 book of photographs called “Early Dylan,” which features pics of Dylan and Cash backstage at a “concert in New Brunswick, New Jersey” and the two at a Chinese restaurant in New Brunswick by Daniel Kramer.\n\n“After the concert, I got some shots of them backstage and later we all went to a Chinese restaurant. Bob returned to New York in Cash’s limousine so he could hear Johnny’s latest album,” Kramer wrote.\n\nBob Dylan and the Inkwell\n\nThe Inkwell Coffeehouse in the West End section of Long Branch has a storied history. It’s been frequented by Rock and Roll Hall of Famers and movie stars over the years, but, no, Bob Dylan never performed there.\n\nAs such, it makes the reference to the “inkwell” in his hit “Subterranean Homesick Blues” extremely unlikely that it’s the Inkwell in Long Branch.\n\n“I definitely thought that when I was younger,” said Anthony Esposito, the current owner of the Inkwell. “It was a beatnik kind of place. This was the place for the Monmouth (College) kids. They would come and congregate to talk about the issues of the day, and he was the president of the issues of the day as far as they were concerned.\"\n\nMore: A Jersey Shore institution: The Inkwell Coffeehouse\n\nStill, a mural of Dylan with the “Subterranean Homesick Blues” lyrics stands proudly in the Inkwell’s outdoor courtyard. It speaks to the creative energy of the Inkwell, which still features open-mics and poetry readings.\n\nAn irony about the Inkwell Dylan story is that the “next Dylan,” Bruce Springsteen, has frequented the spot, at both the former Second and Brighton avenues in Long Branch location and its current location at 665 2nd Ave., for decades.\n\nIt’s right around the corner from 7½ West End Court, where Springsteen wrote “Born to Run.”\n\nDylan picked up by Long Branch police\n\nA rainy July day on the Jersey Shore was the setting for one of the strangest stories of Bob Dylan’s career — and rock ’n’ roll lore.\n\nDylan was picked up by members of the Long Branch Police Department on July 23, 2009, after a “suspicious person” was reported in the neighborhood of Our Lady Star of the Sea Church.\n\n“It was the afternoon and it was pouring rain on a cold day and this strange guy was peering into houses,” said former Long Branch Mayor Adam Schneider. “The officer knew who Bob Dylan was, but what he looked like on an album cover in the 1970s was a lot different than what he looked 40 years later (in the rain).”\n\nThe officers were skeptical that Dylan was indeed Dylan, but they took him back to the Ocean Place Resort & Spa, where he was staying. Dylan, Willie Nelson, and John Mellencamp were there to play FirstEnergy Park, home of the Blueclaws minor league baseball team, in Lakewood at the time.\n\nIt turned out it was really him.\n\n“His manager came running out to us and flipped out,” police officer Kristie Buble told Esquire in 2014. “Being a total jerk. He grabbed Bob out of the car and said, ‘Don’t talk to them anymore, come with me.’ I was like, ‘Sorry! Sorry, Bob!’ — for my Dad, a fan. ‘I didn’t mean to not believe you.’ I couldn’t talk to him anymore because the manager wouldn’t let me have anything to do with him.”\n\nNews of the incident broke about a month later and it went worldwide.\n\nBut a question remains: Was Dylan on that rainy day looking for the house at 7½ West End Court where Springsteen wrote, “Born to Run?”\n\nMore: Bruce Springsteen 1973 to 1986: Jersey Shore to stardom through the lens of David Gahr\n\nYes, said Lepidus, who noted that Dylan had previously visited the early homes of John Lennon and Neil Young.\n\n“It seemed like something he was doing,” Lepidus said. “When he went to England he just got on the tour bus to visit John Lennon’s home just like any other tourist.”\n\nNo, officer Buble told Esquire.\n\n“I read some things afterward, that he was looking for Bruce Springsteen’s childhood house, but it’s not even in that neighborhood,” Buble said. “It’s in the West End side of town. This was the center of Long Branch. There’s nice houses, but they’re kind of old and rickety — I don’t know what he was looking at. I have no idea.”\n\nA Dylan Jersey mystery endures.\n\nChris Jordan: cjordan@app.com; Twitter: @chrisfhjordan\n\nBob Dylan and his Band, 8 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 17, Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Boardwalk, Atlantic City. $50 and up. www.hardrockhotelatlanticcity.com."
