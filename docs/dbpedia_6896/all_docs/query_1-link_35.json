        "text": "Capgemini Invent at the Microsoft Envision AI Connection in Munich. Lots of inspiring sessions and conversations. An event that gives a foretaste of the upcoming GenAI topics from Microsoft. It was a pleasure to be on stage together with Stephan Quitschau and Dr. Nikita Golubnichii from our customer Riverty and Anton Lengle from Microsoft to share exciting insights from our Microsoft Copilot for Sales project. My four key takeaways from the two days: üìà GenAI in the Microsoft environment is currently developing so quickly and companies have to deal with it in order not to have any competitive disadvantages ü§ù The topic of GenAI is not just an IT topic, but rather a business-relevant one, as it has concrete effects on business processes today and even more so tomorrow üìä The quantity and quality of the data is the basis for the use of GenAI and all subsequent processes üöÄ In order to properly utilize the potential of these new possibilities, targeted change and enablement management is required to empower users I'm really excited to see what comes next and how Microsoft's innovative solutions will continue to revolutionize the world of work. #getthefutureyouwant #CapgeminiInvent #Capgemini #GenAI #Microsoft #Copilot #Dynamics #CRM\n\nWe had a wonderful #sko2024 in Austin this last week! Aisera is ready to dive into a real #AI strategy with customers and partners! I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll keep saying - the time for your customer‚Äôs AI Strategy is right NOW! A big thank you to our leadership! Muddu Sudhakar Jeff Mitchell Jeff Baum Monty Waltz George Christian Nick Russo Gigi Goodall Jyoti Kukreja Puru Amradkar Antonio Nucci, PhD Karthik Sj Jared Lucas Stefani Zoller Ellen Harbour To my partners CDW, SHI International Corp., Stratascale ‚Äì An SHI Company, and ITsavvy - let‚Äôs continue to work together to benefit your customers.

Ping me, let‚Äôs have a discussion, and let‚Äôs help your customers roll out a true, cost effective, and company wide AI strategy. -Casey #GenAI #DomainSpecificLLMs #IndustrySpecificLLMs #UniversalBots #CX #EX\n\nSuperhero Team-Up for Business? Let's face it: the world of AI can sometimes feel like a tech arms race. Every company is scrambling to develop the next big thing. But recently, I‚Äôve noticed a refreshing shift towards collaboration over competition. ü§ù Take the recent SAP Sapphire announcements (https://lnkd.in/euzgmPmi ), for example. Here, we have a major player in enterprise software teaming up with industry giants like Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. It‚Äôs like a superhero team-up for the business world! ü¶∏‚ôÄÔ∏è Imagine SAP's enterprise solutions combined with cutting-edge AI from Google and NVIDIA. This collaboration is a recipe for richer insights and more powerful tools for businesses everywhere. It's not just about throwing tech at the wall and hoping something sticks. This collaborative spirit creates a space where everyone contributes their best, leading to advancements that might be impossible solo. üöÄ The beauty of collaboration is that everyone brings their A-game. SAP leverages its deep understanding of enterprise needs, while partners like Microsoft and NVIDIA contribute their expertise in AI-powered insights and sophisticated models. This synergy allows for breakthroughs that might have been unachievable alone. Remember that college project where you pulled an all-nighter only to realize your teammate had a much better approach? Collaboration in AI is like that, but with way cooler tech and potentially world-changing results. Finally, It's not just about speed ‚Äì it's about quality. These alliances ensure that the solutions developed are robust, scalable, and built with ethical considerations. That's something we can all get behind. By prioritizing collaboration over competition, the entire industry benefits. We get faster progress, more agile solutions, and, ultimately, a smoother digital transformation for everyone. Collaboration is the new cool!! üòé #AI #Collaboration #Innovation #DigitalTransformation #SAP #TechPartners #Sapphire2024 #sapsapphire2024\n\nAvanade's qualifications as the number one strategic partner for #MicrosoftFabric extend beyond integrating the technology for clients. Fabric is the technical framework for Avanade's own internal data strategy, and the journey to migrating all enterprise workloads to Fabric-native services has informed a unique perspective on best practices. At the recent Fabric Community Conference in Las Vegas, Avanade hosted an executive roundtable where our experts shared point-of-view lessons from building the largest instance of Microsoft Fabric in the world. 733,000 digital users comprise the scope of Fabric provisioning within Accenture and Avanade, shaping our approach to scaling the technology for other businesses. Together with Accenture, Avanade has the people, processes, and technology assets to maximize value for companies beginning their Fabric journeys. Take a look at Avanade's Microsoft Fabric guide using the link in the comments to learn about industry-aligned solutions from Avanade's dedicated practice of more than 5,000 Fabric-certified professionals. #microsoft #fabric #avanade #enterprisedata #AI #innovation\n\nThis week we hosted the Dutch Executive Briefing for partners. Obviously we learned a lot about #AI and #Copilot for M365. TO ensure we share the learnings with a broader community you will see some findings below. ‚úÖ AI is disrupting the IT industry but also the way partners need to offer their services to customers ‚úÖ Partners need to collaborate with other partners to ensure they can serve our joint customers ‚úÖ The pace of innovation is unknown and we need to create joint business models to cease the AI momentum ‚úÖ We need to skill up as soon as we can. To skill up I have found useful documents I want to share with you. Recently we created the Copilot for Microsoft 365 Adoption playbook which has been created for business leaders, offering guidance on everything from reskilling to how to build an organization‚Äôs capacity to drive its own AI innovations. üîó The Copilot for Microsoft 365 Adoption playbook can be found here: https://lnkd.in/eVcDwN4J Next to this we want to share real use cases for HR, Finance, IT, Marketing and Sales (Shared by Jack R.) Each department kit includes: ‚úÖ Goals and challenges ‚úÖ Real life scenarios ‚úÖ Measurable KPIs and business value ‚úÖ Day in a life by role üîó Check out the Copilot Scenario Library: https://lnkd.in/d5dXdRFx üîó Download the department kits here: https://lnkd.in/dvNpZkRQ Please let me know what you think of this great content and share with those that are interested. #partners #artificialntelligence #MicrosoftCopilot #AI #microsoft #copilotformicrosoft365 #copilot #copilotstudio #technology #generativeai Avanade Accenture Cognizant TCS EY PwC CGI Wipro Capgemini Sogeti Schuberg Philis KPMG NTT DATA"
