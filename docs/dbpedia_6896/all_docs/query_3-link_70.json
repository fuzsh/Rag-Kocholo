        "text": "Oh dear, Narcos – looks like not everyone's a fan of taking artistic licence.\n\nAccording to Pablo Escobar's actual son Sebastian Marroquin, the hit Netflix cartel series is not only \"insulting\" to his father's memory but it's also riddled with inaccuracies.\n\nPosting on Facebook, Sebastian listed a whole 28 'mistakes' and 'outright lies' regarding his infamous father that have apparently been peddled by the series.\n\nFrom trivial matters to the more serious portrayal of an attack on a rival cartel, Sebastian pointed out some issues with Narcos's depiction of the Colombian drug lord.\n\nThe inaccuracies according to Escobar's son - kindly translated by The Telegraph - are as follows. (We hope you're sitting comfortably.)\n\nCarlos Henao, Escobar's brother-in-law, was not a drug-dealer like he is shown on the show. Sebastian describes his uncle as as \"an honest, noble man and father\" who was never involved in any illicit activities. He says that Carlos never dealt drugs and never lived in Miami.\n\nSmall but important point – Sebastian says Pablo Escobar was not a fan of Atletico Nacional, but Deportivo Independiente Medellin.\n\nLa Quica was in prison in New York at the time of Escobar's escape from La Catedral in July 1992, having been jailed in September 1991 for falsifying documents. Sebastian says he was later \"unjustly accused and sentenced for the Avianca bombing, which killed 100 passengers and crew\".\n\nThere was no huge confrontation during Escobar's escape from La Catedral – Sebastian says only one guard was killed. \"My father had no contacts, no help from the law to escape,\" Sebastian writes, and says that his dad escaped by asking for some bricks in the cell to be left loose.\n\nLimon worked as a driver for Roberto 'Osito', Pablo Escobar's older brother for 20 years. Sebastian says he'd been in the family's service for many years, rather than being recruited later.\n\nSebastian says that \"it is not certain that the Medellin and Cali cartels will negotiate to stay in Miami and New York to sell drugs\".\n\nThe CIA did not propose the creation of Los Pepes to the Castano brothers – according to Sebastian, it was Fidel Castano who decided to create them, with the support of the Cali cartel, plus local and foreign authorities.\n\nSebastian says any suggestion his mother bought or used a weapon is a lie.\n\nEscobar did not personally kill Colonel Carrillo, as he is called on the show. Sebastian – who says he is \"not proud at all\" of his father's violence – confirms that Escobar attacked many policemen and killed over 500 in one month in Medellin in the late 1980s, but Carrillo was not one of them.\n\nSebastian says his father's involvement in the deaths of his partners and lenders, Moncada and Galeano, played out as follows: \"The pair were kidnapped by the Cali cartel, and in order to be released alive, they promised to deliver Pablo and his men and cut off their financial support to him\". According to Sebastian, Escobar decided at the last minute to spare Moncada – but too late to stop his death.\n\nSebastian says that his father was on his own in his final days and most of his allies, apart from Angelito and Chopo, were dead.\n\nHe says they didn't have a comfortable life after Escobar escaped La Catedral, writing: \"We were living in slums, not mansions.\"\n\nSebastian says Leon's story as told in the series isn't accurate. He didn't live in the US, and Sebastian says he was \"loyal and valiant\" to Escobar, dying after being captured and tortured by the Castanos.\n\nEscobar never threatened the people of Cali, but only fought the Cartel, and Sebastian says his father put out a statement explaining \"that his wife and part of his family were also originally from the area\".\n\nRicardo Prisco was already dead in real life at the time period they showed him on the series. He had a brother who was a doctor (and was stigmatised by his actions) - he was no criminal.\n\nSebastian says that Escobar \"never attacked the daughter of Gilberto Rodriguez at her wedding\", or indeed any member of his family at all. \"He complied with the agreement not to attack family members,\" despite Escobar's apparent belief that they put a bomb in a building where his mother and little sister were staying in 1988.\n\nEscobar also never forced his son or children to get involved in clandestine activities. Sebastian says his parents placed a heavy emphasis on education, and other opportunities they didn't have.\n\nSebastian confirms he was in one firefight with his father – but not like the one shown in Narcos.\n\nThe show puts Escobar's bomb attacks on the Discount Drugs pharmaceutical chain run by Gilberto Rodriguez in the year 1993, when in fact they were in 1988 and 1989.\n\nHis paternal grandmother betrayed his father and aligned with his older brother Roberto. Sebastian says they struck a deal with Los Pepes so that they could live peacefully in Colombia, while those loyal to Pablo continue to live in exile. He added he would have loved the \"sweet\" version on the series to have been a reality, but it wasn't.\n\nSebastian says his paternal grandmother did not fly with them to Germany, and their trip wasn't as shown on the series.\n\nThe district attorney of Colombia did not help Escobar's family as shown on the programme, according to Sebastian, who says the family were effectively hostages by association.\n\nSebastian disputes the suggestion that Virginia Vallejo was so in love that she refused Escobar's money. He says his mother didn't speak to her after the La Caterdal escape, and his father wasn't in contact with her for 10 years.\n\nEscobar never sent phones to Sebastian and his family in the Tequendama hotel. They used the phones there, and hung up each time he called to protect him because he knew the phones were tapped. Escobar used to always tell Sebastian: \"The phone is death\". One day, \"he asked to speak to my mother and sister,\" Sebastian continues. They had a long conversations - as it would probably be their last call – speaking on the day of Escobar's final battle in the Los Olivos neighbourhood of Medellin. Sebastian also reaffirmed his belief that his father committed suicide and was not killed by police.\n\nNo journalists were killed in front of the Tequendama Hotel.\n\nSebastian says that Escobar never treated his parents badly.\n\nAfter Escobar's death, Sebastian's mum arranged a meeting with the Cali cartel, which he says was attended by 40 big Mafia bosses. Miguel Rodriquez, not Gilberto, saved his mother – but on this occasion they stripped their family of their property and split it among themselves, \"shared as part of the spoils of war\".\n\nOn the show, Marroquin's grandmother said that it was Sebastian's mother who betrayed his father. But he says in reality, it was his grandmother and her children who secretly contacted the Cali cartel.\n\nDespite Narcos' many apparent mistakes, the show has been a huge hit with audiences. Although its second season debuted mere days ago, it's already been renewed for a third and fourth.\n\nNarcos seasons one and two are available for streaming on Netflix right now. Watch a trailer for season two below.\n\nRianne Houghton is a freelance news writer at Digital Spy."
