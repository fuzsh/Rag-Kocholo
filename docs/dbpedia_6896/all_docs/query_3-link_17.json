        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe place of death is a crucial indicator that incorporates the idea of end-of-life care quality, mainly in developed countries with healthcare systems capable of offering efficient support for palliative care at home.1,2 Despite being relatively understudied, this outcome has piqued the interest of the scientific community, particularly in the context of cancer, which stands as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally.3 When appropriate support is provided, the incidence of home death is often connected with expanded prospects of receiving physical and emotional assistance, maintaining privacy, and exerting a greater sense of control over the surroundings. Moreover, it is also linked to lower healthcare costs and reduced risks of aggressive and futile treatments.4, 5, 6\n\nHowever, within the framework of developing nations and resource-limited areas like Brazil, the absence of a robust system for home-based palliative care, combined with challenging clinical, socioeconomic, and environmental circumstances, may lead to the perception of home deaths as an unsettling sociodemographic indicator. Vulnerable housing structures of patients, limited access to specialised palliative care health teams, and diminished physical and emotional capabilities of families to provide necessary end-of-life care, all seem to contribute to heightening the concern in this situation.7, 8, 9\n\nConfirming the notable differences in the frequency of home deaths across various countries and regions, a comprehensive analysis of United States death records from 2003 to 2015 revealed that 49% of women with gynaecological cancer died at home or in hospices.10 In Brazil, according to a study conducted in São Paulo, 80% of deaths by cancer occurred in hospitals, with only 20% occurring in a home setting. Additionally, the domicile was not the preferred location for the majority of patients to die, particularly those with poorly managed symptoms.7\n\nConsidering the extensive Brazilian national territory and the social and health disparities among different regions of Brazil, as elucidated by Barbosa et al.,11 and recognising that researching on end-of-life care for cancer patients can significantly contribute to the formulation of nationwide public policies, there is an outstanding need for a detailed understanding the place of death by cancer of occurrence nationwide. In this context, the study assumes particular importance as it aims to elucidate factors associated with the place of death by cancer and current trends in Brazil.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study addresses a critical gap in research by examining data on the place of death by cancer in Brazil, a country often overlooked in existing literature dominated by European and North American focus. Consequently, the trends and factors influencing the place of death by cancer in Brazil are not comprehensively understood. The main findings indicate that hospitals are the primary setting for place of death by cancer in Brazil, with fewer deaths occurring at home, displaying varying patterns over time. Herein, contributing factors to home deaths include low literacy rates, indigenous ethnicity, and residency in underdeveloped regions, highlighting considerable socio-demographic disparities. Given the absence of a well-coordinated national program to ensure dignified end-of-life care for patients with cancer in Brazil, these results objectively highlight home-based deaths in cancer care as a negative indicator of the country’s public health system.\n\nOn the contrary, in developed nations with adequate healthcare support, dying at home may indicate better end-of-life care. In this context, a favourable passing encompasses various dimensions and is centred around providing a comforting transition that aligns with the preferences of the dying individual, thereby honouring the principle of self-determination.1,22,23 The dying process is complex and subjective, influenced by factors such as social stigma, cultural norms, and personal experiences.22 Extensive research has elucidated individuals’ preferences regarding end-of-life care, showing that a significant proportion, ranging from 49% to 100% of surveyed participants, express a desire to receive care and pass away in their own homes.4,8,24, 25, 26, 27\n\nAn important assessment, based on insights from 181 experts representing 81 countries, equivalent to over 80% of the global population, highlighted Brazil’s ranking at 79th place in palliative care quality. This designation emphasizes Brazil as one of the least favourable locations for end-of-life care, only surpassing nations facing significant developmental challenges or strong socio-political crises like Lebanon (80th) and Paraguay (81st) on a global scale. In contrast, the top three countries were the United Kingdom (1st), Ireland (2nd), and Taiwan (3rd), all falling into the high-income nation classification.28\n\nThe identified rate of 17.7% of deaths occurring in residential settings within the current study is in line with previously reported findings.7,29 It is important to note that the distribution of home deaths varies significantly across countries, influenced by factors such as disparities in resources, varying stages of palliative care development, and nation-specific regulations concerning end-of-life care.30 Reflecting the national reality of insufficiently integrated end-of-life care programs, the high frequency of home deaths reported in underdeveloped countries is concerning. For instance, Seitz et al.31 studied 12 Latin American countries and found varying rates of cancer-related deaths at home, with Guatemala reaching an alarming 80.3% for home deaths. In another analysis of death certificates from 14 countries, Mexico recorded 57% of deaths occurring at home.30 Similarly, a study in Africa reported that the majority of cancer-related deaths (42.9%) took place in residential settings.32\n\nBrant and Silbermann33 underscored the vulnerabilities stemming from economic disparities that significantly affect the quality of end-of-life care for cancer patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), aligning with Soto-Perez-de-Celis et al.34 on challenges in end-of-life care in Latin America and insights from Murray et al.35 on cancer patient care in Kenya. The documented resource constraints, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and underfunded programs pose obstacles to comprehensive palliative services, impacting place of death, pain management and psychosocial support. The economic gap not only widens care access discrepancies but also jeopardizes standards, potentially compromising pain control and psychosocial assistance. As studies suggest the viability of cost-effective palliative care models, they collectively emphasise the urgency for enhanced legislative frameworks, better infrastructure, and culturally sensitive practices to navigate the intricate challenges faced by patients in LMICs like Kenya and Latin American nations.\n\nThe study reveals a consistent annual decrease of 1.9% in the rate of cancer deaths at home from 2002 to 2018, corresponding with the findings from the research conducted in the state of Paraná which showcased a decline in home deaths between 1996 and 2010.29 In their study, Leite et al.36 noted a significant reduction in the proportion of elderly individuals with cancer who passed away at home in the state of São Paulo–the percentage decreased from 10.3% in 2006 to 8.1% in 2012, indicating a notable shift. These collective results point towards a positive trend away from home deaths for cancer patients, suggesting potential improvements in end-of-life care practices within these regions, supposedly taking place in hospital settings.\n\nNevertheless, there was a significant surge of 10.7% in the rate of home deaths in Brazil between 2018 and 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, associated with the collapse of medical services, may have strongly contributed to this change. Furthermore, the implementation of social isolation measures combined with the reorganization of healthcare services to prioritize patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 may have created barriers to hospital access for cancer patients nearing the end of life.37 Results of a recent study conducted by Teasdale et al.38 in the USA demonstrated that, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an 11% increase in the general hospital death (relative risk—RR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.05–1.17), with non–COVID-19 in-hospital death decreasing by 13% (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.82–0.93), and a 19% increase in non–COVID-19 home deaths (RR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.13–1.26).\n\nIn the current study, a robust association was identified between deaths occurring at home and specific sociodemographic characteristics, namely no formal education (OR = 3.38, p-value < 0.001), indigenous ethnicity (OR = 2.19, p-value < 0.001), and residence in the North, Northeast, and Central-West regions of the country (OR = 2.32, p-value < 0.001). These results are consistent with the comprehensive analysis conducted by Seitz et al.,31 where the likelihood of home deaths, regardless of the underlying cause (beyond cancer-specific cases), consistently increased with advancing age, rural residency, and lower educational attainment. Moreover, an observed moderate negative correlation surfaced between the regional proportion of home deaths and the availability of hospital beds. Altogether, this suggests that individuals with greater financial means and social support in Latin American contexts tend to have enhanced access to hospital-based care.31\n\nIn 2022, there was a notable 22.5% rise in the overall count of palliative care services in Brazil when compared to the figures from 2018. Nonetheless, with only 234 services currently operational, it is evident that this number remains inadequate for the country’s population (equating to approximately 2 services per 100,000 inhabitants).39 Furthermore, these services are geographically disparate, with approximately 60% concentrated in the South and Southeast regions. Additionally, only 83 of these services (35.4%) offer home care facilities.40 The impending implementation of the National Palliative Care Policy within the Brazilian Public Health System, which has received approval in various forums and is currently undergoing final review in the technical departments of the Ministry of Health for imminent publication, holds promise for effectively addressing this situation.\n\nLimitations and strengths\n\nSome limitations need to be addressed. Firstly, the extent of death registration coverage in the country and the completeness of the investigation of the cases of the records used in this study, as SIM is a secondary database, should be taken into consideration. Despite ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Health to enhance data completeness and SIM coverage,41 under-registration persists in certain regions, particularly in the North and Northeast.14,42 Additionally, the outcome examined in this study cannot be easily translated into the quality of death. A more comprehensive assessment of death quality would ideally involve evaluating various factors such as physical and psychological symptoms, personal care, spirituality, relationships, preparation for death circumstances, and the choice of end-of-life care and location of death.1,9,22,43 Investigating the association between the availability of palliative care services at home and the probability of home deaths in Brazil would be an intriguing area for study. However, the lack of a national database with accurate regional data on services of palliative care at home made such analyses unfeasible.\n\nWhen analysing extensive datasets such as the one in this study, there is an increased likelihood of identifying statistically significant results that may not correspond to clinically meaningful associations.44,45 In this context, evaluating effect size should be used to determine the clinical importance of the results. As such, the data analysis was conducted by taking into account effect size, which, unlike the p-value, is not influenced by sample size.46 Notably, owing to the cross-sectional design employed, the identified associations between variables might have exhibited variations across different time periods. Ultimately, the data format used did not support an adjusted analysis because disaggregated data, which was unavailable on the on-line data collected, is essential for this type of multivariate analysis.\n\nIt is crucial to highlight that this study represents one of the most comprehensive investigations concerning the place of death in Latin America, utilizing a robust and credible dataset. The research draws upon data from a reputable source of sociodemographic information, offering a detailed time series dataset for thorough analysis. To guarantee data accuracy and relevance, the study implemented stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Furthermore, various advanced statistical analysis techniques were applied to the data, enriching the reliability and validity of the study’s outcomes.\n\nFuture perspectives\n\nThis research aims to unveil the intricate dynamics at play and advocates for educational institutions and researchers to delve deeper into this crucial area using diverse methodological approaches, thereby enriching the comprehension of end-of-life care quality. The study is anticipated to prompt governmental bodies into action, facilitating the formation of strategic solutions and public policies for the efficient allocation of resources towards end-of-life care. Special attention must be directed towards supporting marginalized groups, including Black and Indigenous communities, individuals with limited educational backgrounds, and residents in underserved regions. Alongside upholding investments in continuous medical education initiatives to ensure meticulous death certificate completion, targeted research focusing on disadvantaged populations is deemed imperative. Embracing this evidence-driven strategy to tackle prevailing challenges has the potential to cultivate a more equitable and compassionate healthcare system.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe study underscores the concerning rate of cancer deaths occurring at home in Brazil, shedding light on the absence of a well-organized national end-of-life care program for home settings, as well as structured palliative care teams in more underdeveloped regions. This deficiency potentially compromises the quality of care and support for individuals in their terminal stages. To address this issue, there is a pressing need for a coordinated national program that prioritizes dignified end-of-life care at home for cancer patients. Implementing targeted strategies focused on enhancing home-based care services, facilitating improved access to medical resources, and providing support to vulnerable populations can significantly bolster the quality of end-of-life care. Such a program has the potential to foster a more compassionate and efficient healthcare system, especially for individuals grappling with end-of-life challenges in Brazil."
