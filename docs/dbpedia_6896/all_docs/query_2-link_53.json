        "text": "Companies are interested in investing in Brazilian infrastructure assets and a pipeline of projects should continue to attract money to the sector provided that investors are confident the country’s fiscal situation is solid, a top Brazilian investment banker told LatinFinance.\n\n“The fiscal question always casts a shadow,” said Marcelo Girão, managing director and head of project finance at Itaú BBA. “The government has recently announced spending cuts and said that it will do what is necessary to deliver the promised levels deficit. That is positive but not simple.”\n\nBrazil’s Financial minister Fernando Haddad recently said that more than BRL15 billion ($2.65 billion) of discretionary spending from this year’s budget will be frozen, signaling to investors that the government will try and rein in its finances.\n\nHowever, analysts continue to express doubts about President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s commitment to fiscal discipline, with some saying the administration appears more eager to raise tax revenues than lower spending.\n\nThe fear is that, if the budget deficit is not kept under control, the central bank will have to maintain interest rates at high levels and may even increase them, pushing up the cost of money for infrastructure projects.\n\n“If the market sees signs of fiscal deterioration, the cost of capital and the risk will go up, and projects may have to be redesigned to remain attractive,” Girão said.\n\nWith the right conditions, investments would pour into sectors such as data centers, which have gained attention from markets thanks to the emergence of artificial intelligence, and for which Brazil presents particularly favorable conditions, he added.\n\nGirão said that Brazil can offer renewable energy at competitive prices for data centre projects, a key factor as AI consumes enormous amounts of energy.\n\nInvestors will also be drawn to the sector if data centers are able to sell a new type of infrastructure debentures offering tax benefits to issuers, though Girão stressed that it is not yet clear whether this is indeed the case.\n\nHowever, Frederico Moura, a partner at the Stocche Forbes law office in São Paulo, said some data center projects will be able to issue the debentures provided they get a license or concession to operate as an infrastructure company.\n\n“It is not something complicated to obtain,” he said."
