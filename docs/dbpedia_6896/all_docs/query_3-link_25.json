        "text": "𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗿𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗵! The 2023 World Health Organization Global Status Report on #RoadSafety is now available. It indicates a modest decline in the number of road traffic deaths to 1.19 million per year. Although progress is apparent, road traffic deaths and injuries persist as a global health and development challenge, retaining their status as the 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗿𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗱 𝟱–𝟮𝟵 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀. It is shocking to think, but more #young people are killed on the roads each year than from any other cause: more than all the wars worldwide; more than TB; more than Malaria, etc. Yet compared with these other crises, very little is done. We cannot fail our #children anymore, we need to intensify our #actions, and we need to it #now! This slight reduction in fatalities underscores that initiatives to enhance road safety are making an impact, particularly in regions adopting the #SafeSystem approach – placing people and safety at the core of mobility systems. Remarkably, ten countries have successfully #halved deaths between 2010 and 2021, demonstrating that ambitious fatality-reduction targets are achievable with the right #political will and #effective measures. #RoadSafety is an ongoing commitment that demands our continuous dedication! Every death or serious injury in a traffic collision is premature and largely preventable. There is no excuse for inaction! https://lnkd.in/dhXJ6m-k #EveryLife #SafeSystem #VisionZero #SaveKidsLives #WalkTheTalk #MobilityForHumanity\n\nWhy is Manchester so bad for childhood asthma? The mother of a six year old boy with breathing difficulties has called for local governments to prioritise reducing air pollution. It comes as figures show the North West has the highest proportion of children being hospitalised with asthma anywhere in England. Those under 19 finding themselves in hospital with the condition is 65% worse than the average, Public Health England says, with almost 4,000 children admitted between 2022 and 2023. Tameside, Oldham and Manchester city centre have some the highest rates of asthma hospital admissions for children under 19. We continually see reports of the links between air pollution and childhood asthma, let's support air pollution campaigns to change the lives of our children. #childhealth #asthma #airpollution #pollution #airquality #manchester #greatermanchester #health\n\n\"Today marks World Mosquito Day, a crucial reminder of the significant impact mosquitoes have on global health. As professionals in the healthcare industry, it's essential we acknowledge the devastating effects of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika. Let's work together to raise awareness and drive prevention efforts. By sharing knowledge, resources, and best practices, we can make a tangible difference in combating these diseases. Join me in recognizing World Mosquito Day and let's commit to creating a healthier, safer world for all. #WorldMosquitoDay #GlobalHealth #MosquitoBorneDiseases #HealthcareProfessionals #DiseasePrevention\"\n\nAs the wet and windy weather continues, and we approach a potentially much colder spell towards the end of February, we would like to highlight our recent article again titled: \"Preparing For Winter: Reducing The Impact Of Falls\". Read More: https://ow.ly/1FM450QxXsL As outlined in previous articles, delays in mobilising a fallen person can have critical consequences for them. It is imperative for first responders to react quickly to a fall even if there is no apparent emergency, to avoid a ‘long lie’ and the detrimental impact this can have on the faller’s long-term health. #vividcare #fallsresponse #emergencyservices #nhs"
