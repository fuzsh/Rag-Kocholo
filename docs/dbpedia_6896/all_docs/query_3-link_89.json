        "text": "Lygia Fagundes Telles, one of Brazil’s most popular writers, whose stories of women trapped in unsatisfying relationships could also be read as allegories of her country’s political situation, died on Sunday at her home in São Paulo. She was 98.\n\nThe Brazilian Academy of Letters announced her death.\n\nOne of the first Brazilian writers to address female sexuality from a woman’s perspective, Ms. Telles was also the rare writer whose work appealed to both intellectuals and the general public.\n\nTrained as a lawyer — she was one of only six women in her class of more than 100 at the University of São Paulo Law School — she was acutely aware that she was a trailblazer in both her chosen fields, but did not overtly identify as a feminist. Despite her literary success, she continued working as a lawyer in civil service for much of her career.\n\nIn a 1980 memoir, “The Discipline of Love,” Ms. Telles recalled that an early critic found her stories suffered only from lacking a “bearded author.”\n\n“I was super happy: To write a text that deserved to come from the pen of a man, that was the greatest thing for a girl in a bonnet in 1944,” she wrote. “I worked, I studied and I chose two vocations that were clearly masculine: I was an unconscious feminist but I was a feminist.”\n\nIn the 1970s, her stories often obliquely criticized Brazil’s military regime, which was in power from 1964 to 1985. Her short story “Rat Seminar” (1977), which imagines rats and humans trading places, was an allegory of Brazil under the dictatorship.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
