The two pieces of work share some key differences. Other than being two different types of works, there differences go deeper than that.

Crane is writing about the civil war while Komunyakaa wrote about his experience of the Vietnam war. Crane’s historical background is inspired by reading about soldiers and their experience first handedly. “The Red Badge of Courage” is more of a psychological portrait of the main character’s perception in a time of war relating to Henry Fleming's experience in combat.

Douglass and Henry run from their own difficult situations, but this act of fear and cowardice makes them realize that nothing good will come from running away.\n\nThroughout The Red Badge of Courage, by Stephen Crane, Henry Fleming makes mistakes and has to relearn what he is capable of. His transgressions include running from a battle, abandoning a dying man, and lying to his comrades. Tim O’Brien defines what a true war story is in his book The Things They Carried, and states that, “A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior…” Although the youth makes many mistakes throughout The Red Badge of Courage, and many immoral acts are portrayed, it is not a true war story according to Tim O’Brien’s definition.\n\nBook Report On The Red Badge Of Courage\n\n663 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe Red Badge of Courage, by Stephen Crane, is the story of a teenager, named Henry Fleming, that enlists in the Union army for the glory of being a soldier.

He does not report his actions to anyone but rather describes what it looked like in the field from a soldier’s prospective.
