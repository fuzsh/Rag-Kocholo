        "text": "Hardcover. Condition: Fair. [6], 233, [1], [4 pages of advertisements], [2] pages. No dust jacket. Cover has some wear and soiling. Spine worn soiled and frayed at top and bottom. Some page discoloration. Previous owner's stamp inside front and rear covers. Ink notation inside front cover and on fep. Pencil notation (name and date) on second fep. For those who wish to know more, this copy has 4 pages of ads beginning with \"The Exploits f Brigadier Gerard,\" \"bank\" instead of \"bunk\" on line 11, p. 4 and a bit blurred (lat)ed on line 6 on page 225. An abbreviated version of Crane's story was first serialized in The Philadelphia Press in December 1894. This version of the story, which was culled to 18,000 words by an editor specifically for the serialization, was reprinted in newspapers across America, establishing Crane's fame. In October 1895, a version, which was 5,000 words shorter than the original manuscript, was printed in book form by D. Appleton & Company. This version of the novel differed greatly from Crane's original manuscript; the deletions were thought by some scholars to be due to demands by an Appleton employee who was afraid of public disapproval of the novel's content. Parts of the original manuscript removed from the 1895 version include all of the twelfth chapter, as well as the endings to chapters seven, ten and fifteen. Appleton's 1895 publication went through ten editions in the first year alone. Appleton republished the novel again in 1917, shortly after the US entered World War I, reissuing it three additional times that same year. The Red Badge of Courage is a war novel by American author Stephen Crane (1871-1900). Taking place during the American Civil War, the story is about a young private of the Union Army, Henry Fleming, who flees from the field of battle. Overcome with shame, he longs for a wound, a \"red badge of courage,\" to counteract his cowardice. When his regiment once again faces the enemy, Henry acts as standard-bearer, who carries a flag. Although Crane was born after the war, and had not at the time experienced battle first-hand, the novel is known for its realism and naturalism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1894, using various contemporary and written accounts (such as those published previously by Century Magazine) as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. The novel is known for its distinctive style, which includes realistic battle sequences as well as the repeated use of color imagery, and ironic tone. Separating itself from a traditional war narrative, Crane's story reflects the inner experience of its protagonist (a soldier fleeing from combat) rather than the external world around him. Also notable for its use of what Crane called a \"psychological portrayal of fear\", the novel's allegorical and symbolic qualities are often debated by critics. Several of the themes that the story explores are maturation, heroism, cowardice, and the indifference of nature. The Red Badge of Courage garnered widespread acclaim, what H. G. Wells called \"an orgy of praise\", shortly after its publication, making Crane an instant celebrity at the age of twenty-four. The novel and its author did have their initial detractors, however, including author and veteran Ambrose Bierce. Never out of print, it is Crane's most important work and a major American text. Early printing [First edition was published in October 1895].\n\nFirst Edition with matching dates of 1895 on the title and copyright pages. Second printing with \"The Red Badge of Courage\" listed as the first title in the 4 pages of Appleton Ads at the rear of the book. Also with the battered type in the word \"lated\" on the last line of p. 225. Still a very scarce copy published in the first edition year of 1895. With the previous owner's name in ink at the top of the free front endpaper: \"W.H. Forbes. Milton 1897.\" Perhaps the forebear of this distinguished Forbes: William Hathaway Forbes was born in Milton, Massachusetts in 1902 and attended Milton Academy and Harvard College. Forbes joined the staff of the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory (the \"LabÓ) in 1930 and in 1935 served as a member of the LabÕs International High Altitude Expedition to Aucanquilcha in the Chilean Andes, an expedition staffed by David Bruce Dill (then the ÒunofficialÓ director of the Lab) and Ancel Keyes (the expedition leader). This expedition was undertaken to study blood chemistry, the effects of exercise on respiration and circulation, and mental impairments at high altitudes. A relatively worn and soiled binding; in the original finely woven linen cloth stamped in red and black on the front boards and on the spine. The illuminated letter \"T\" is very brightly gilded. There is light wear and rubbing to the top and bottom of the spine ends but without any loss of cloth. The spine is darkened and lightly stained as are the front and rear boards. Internally the book is clean and tight with clean light brown endpapers. The front hinge is very good, but the rear hinge is beginning to split. First Edition with matching dates of 1895 on the title and copyright pages. Second printing with \"The Red Badge of Courage\" listed as the first title in the 4 pages of Appleton Ads at the rear of the book. Also with the battered type in the word \"lated\" on the last line of p. 225. Still a very scarce copy published in the first edition year of 1895.\n\nCondition: Very good. First edition, second issue, of the most influential piece of war fiction in American literature, with the armorial engraved bookplate of Theodore Roosevelt on the front pastedown, and Roosevelt's clipped signature additionally tipped onto the front free endpaper. The publication of RED BADGE made Crane an instant celebrity. As a journalist, editors \"'who would not have wiped their old shoes on him before then' suddenly wanted to meet him\" (Sorrentino 149). In the year of the book's publication, long before he became the 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt was the New York City Police Commissioner. In this role he would meet Stephen Crane, whose book he enjoyed so much that he would send the author a congratulatory letter and later ask him to sign a copy of the book. Roosevelt was a famously voracious reader and bibliophile who kept multiple libraries. As police commissioner, Roosevelt met with Crane a few times, once for an interview and another time for dinner along with Jacob Riis. RED BADGE was one of Roosevelt's favorites until a local trial on police brutality put him at odds with Crane. When Crane wrote a dispatch criticizing the Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War, he sounded the death knell of their short friendship. A terrific association copy between two Gilded Age men who changed American letters and history. Octavo. 7.25'' x 4.75''. Original full tan cloth lettered in red, black, and gilt with red-stamped ornaments. Brown coated endpapers. Top edge gilt. Publisher's catalogue at rear. 233, [1], [4] pages. Engraved bookplate of Theodore Roosevelt bearing his motto, \"Qui plantavit curabit,\" on front pastedown; clipped signature of Roosevelt additionally tipped onto front endpaper. Housed in custom quarter blue gilt-lettered goatskin slipcase and blue cloth chemise. Slight spine lean, some spotting to top edge of front board, typical light soilingto cloth, spine a bit toned: interior clean and fresh."
