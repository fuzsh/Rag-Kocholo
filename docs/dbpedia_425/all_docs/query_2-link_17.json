        "text": "Activity 1. \"Keenan's Charge\" vs. Chapter 23\n\nThe Red Badge of Courage took a non-traditional approach to the war story. In addition to stylistic differences (which are treated in detail in the companion EDSITEment lesson The Red Badge of Courage: A New Kind of Realism), Crane eschews the didacticism readers were accustomed to finding in pieces about war. In the course of the novel, Henry Fleming is, in turn, cowardly, selfish, loyal, and courageous.\n\nShare with your students the poem \"Keenan's Charge\" by George Parsons Lathrop (page 257 page 258 Scribner's Monthly, Volume XXII, May 1881 to Oct. 1881, inclusive), available on The Nineteenth Century in Print Periodicals collection of the EDSITEment-reviewed website American Memory. Part II of \"Keenan's Charge\" describes an assault that took place during the Battle of Chancellorsville. Chapter 23 of The Red Badge of Courage also describes a battle charge, probably based on events at Chancellorsville.\n\nDownload, copy, and distribute to students the chart The Red Badge of Courage on pages 1–2 of the PDF (see \"Preparation Instructions\", above, for download instructions). Have students look through \"Keenan's Charge\" and Chapter 23 carefully as they find evidence from each to complete the chart and answer the questions. When they are finished, refer to student answers as you and the class make comparisons between the two works. Does one or the other make the participants seem more or less realistic? Brave? Patriotic?\n\nActivity 2. Controversy: Cowardly and Unpatriotic?\n\nAccording to the Red Badge Home Page of the EDSITEment resource American Studies at the University of Virginia:\n\nShare with students General Alexander C. McClurg's letter to the Dial, April 16, 1896, XX, 227–28, available on the EDSITEment-reviewed website American Studies at the University of Virginia. Provide students with the handout \"Is The Red Badge of Courage Cowardly and Unpatriotic?,\" on page 3 of the PDF, which lists many of McClurg's specific allegations against The Red Badge of Courage. Give students time to complete the chart on their own or in small groups. Then discuss evidence from the text that corroborates or contradicts McClurg's allegations.\n\nCrane's consideration of values in The Red Badge of Courage is one that can't be framed as simply as either cowardly and unpatriotic or courageous and patriotic. On the one hand, the last page of the most well-known version of the text says that Henry\n\n\"… felt a quiet manhood, nonassertive but of sturdy and strong blood. He knew that he would no more quail before his guides wherever they should point. He had been to touch the great death, and found that, after all, it was but the great death. He was a man.\"\n\nBut he also had\n\n\"... rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks-an existence of soft and eternal peace.\"\n\nWhat is going on in these passages? How can they be reconciled in terms of the text?\n\nGeneral Alexander C. McClurg (1832–1901), soldier, publisher, book collector, headed the publishing firm which owned \"The Dial.\" His letter, written April 11, 1896, is in response to critics who took The Red Badge seriously, including the reviewer for \"The Dial.\" McClurg [attacked] … English reviewers and magazines, cowards and deserters, and the lack of proper censorship of modern literature …\n\nActivity 3. The Red Badge of Courage: Choose Your Own Ending\n\nShare with the class the following:\n\n\"… in commending the book I should dwell rather upon the skill shown in evolving from the youth's crude expectations and ambitions a quiet honesty and self-possession manlier and nobler than any heroism he had imagined.\"\n\n—From William Dean Howells' review of The Red Badge of Courage, Harper's Weekly, October 26, 1895, xxxix, 1013\n\nA work like \"Keenan's Charge\" can be seen as a demonstration of the author's cherished values about character. As Howell suggests, The Red Badge of Courage is more about the process of character development, a young person \"evolving.\" [Here character development is meant in the sense of the process of growth we all go through in which a person matures and decides what values to endorse as opposed to the literary term \"character development.\"] What can the students point to in the text or its plot to support that way of looking at the book? \"Courage\" is certainly the foremost value the book explores, but include in your discussion complementary character traits such as loyalty, patriotism, duty, determination, and self-awareness. What other character traits are treated in the novel?\n\nA different ending was used for each of three publications of The Red Badge of Courage. Each ending is available online via a link from the EDSITEment resource American Studies at the University of Virginia. Assume, for the sake of discussion, that in writing the book, Crane was sorting out his feelings about characteristics such as courage and patriotism and that while he was still uncertain, he composed three endings. Eventually, of course, he would have to choose the one ending most faithful to what he learned in the course of writing the book. Share with the class the endings published in the book (top of page), manuscript (page 191, page 192, page 193 and serial. Which ending was featured in the text the students read? Help students explore the different effects of the alternate endings. How does each ending reflect how Henry has changed during the book? Which ending do students think is most faithful to what Crane learned by writing the novel? In what way? What did Crane learn?"
