        "text": "There are few, if any, old men now living who know from experience the exact look and \"feel\" of a battle in the War Between the States. Such knowledge, so common to so many until a few years ago, must now be derived from descriptions that are vivid in so many texts; from old photographs of battles, such as those that Matthew Brady made, and from the wells of imagination that have been fed by countless legends and tales.Certainly a classic description, not only of a battle in full blast but of the tormenting fears and emotions of an untried youth in the ranks, is Stephen Crane's \"The Red Badge of Courage,\" which says all that ever need be said about the terror of a man first entering battle, no matter which side he's on or in what war. Now, thanks to Metro and John Huston, \"The Red Badge of Courage\" has been transferred to the screen with almost literal fidelity. It opened here at the Trans-Lux Fifty-second Street yesterday.Don't expect too much from it in the way of emotional punch—at least, not as much as is compacted in Mr. Crane's thin little book. For, of course, Mr. Crane was conveying the reactions of his hero to war in almost stream-of-consciousness descriptions, which is a technique that works best with words. When it is a matter of telling precisely how a young soldier feels at a time, for instance, when awaiting an enemy attack or when wandering behind the lines after lamming, it is easier to do so with words than with a camera going around with the soldier and frequently looking at his face.This is a technical problem Mr. Huston has not been able to lick, even with his sensitive direction, in view of his sticking to the book. Audie Murphy, who plays the Young Soldier, does as well as anyone could expect as a virtual photographer's model upon whom the camera is mostly turned. And his stupefied facial expressions and erratic attitudes when grim experiences crowd upon him suggest what goes on in his mind. These, coupled with the visual evidence of all that surrounds him and all he sees, plus the help of an occasional narration that sketchily tells us what he feels, do all that can be expected to give us the inner sight of Mr. Crane's book.But the major achievement of this picture is the whole scene, it re-creates of a battlefield near the Rappahannock (Chancellorsville) from the soldier's point of view—the ragged and nondescript infantry, the marches, the battlelines, the din, the dust, the cavalry charges, the enemy surging out of the clouds of smoke, and the pitiful, wretched lines of the wounded reaching and stumbling toward the rear. Mr. Huston, who made \"San Pietro,\" one of the great documentaries of World War II, can conceive a Civil War battle, and he has done so magnificently in this film.Furthermore, he has got the sense of soldiers in that long-ago day and war—their looks, their attitudes, their idioms—as suggested in the writings of the times. John Dierkes, as the Tall Soldier; Bill Maudlin as the loud, uneasy one, and Douglas Dick as the Lieutenant stand out in a small but excellent cast. All are the sort of soldiers that one's mind visions on those battlefields.Also, Mr. Huston has captured and etched vividly most of the major encounters of the hero that Mr. Crane described—the heart-breaking death of the Tall Soldier, the stunning blow on the head—all but the shocking discovery of the rotting corpse in the woods. This is out of the picture as it is being shown here, probably out of deference for the squeamish.But, in most respects, Mr. Huston has put \"The Red Badge of Courage\" on the screen, and that means a major achievement that should command admiration for years and years.\n\nTHE RED BADGE OF COURAGE, screen play by John Huston, adapted by Albert Band from the novel by Stephen Crane; directed by Mr. Huston; produced by Gottfried Reinhardt.
