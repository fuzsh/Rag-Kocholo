        "text": "Throughout Red Badge of Courage, we see our protagonist Henry (who is more often than not referred to simply as “the young soldier”) mature due to his experience in the American civil war. At the start of the book, Henry is what can best be described as an angsty teenager. He joins the army not out of patriotism or a sense of responsibility but rather for excitement and admiration from others. His beliefs and opinions constantly change depending on his circumstance. For example, how he feels about himself after he runs from the first battle alternates between a sense of superiority to a sense of guild depending on how he thinks the battle is going. Henry is also incredibly unsure of himself and whether or not he is brave enough to stand and fight when needed. However, as the story continues and Henry experiences the trials and tribulations of war, he grows as a person and truly becomes a man, able to face death and suffering and come out the other side standing. To quote the last page of the book, “With this conviction came a store of assurance. He felt a quiet manhood, nonassertive but of sturdy and strong blood. He knew that he would no more quail before his guides wherever they should point. He had been to touch the great death, and found that, after all, it was but the great death. He was a man”(118). This narrative of manhood through combat stands in contrast to other anti-war messages found in the book."
