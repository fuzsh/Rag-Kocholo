        "text": "I have a vague memory of reading The Red Badge of Courage in high school, which I’m not sure is due to my age or that we never truly absorb literature as teenagers the same way we do as adults. Nevertheless, I thought it was time to dust if off and give Stephen Crane’s tale of the Civil War a reread. Published in 1895 when war was treated as a subject of romance, Stephen Crane’s work was one of the first non-romantic war novels to attain a wide popularity. Literary giants, such as Joseph Conrad and later Ernest Hemingway, would sing the praises of this novel, with the latter referring to it as “one of the finest books of American literature.” While reading it, I found myself swept away by this tale of young solider Henry Fleming. I found the language to be at times beautiful yet devastating.\n\nThe Red Badge of Courage is the story of Henry Fleming, a young boy who leaves his mother’s farm with dreams of becoming a war hero. During his regiment’s first battle, he flees in fear believing the battle to be a lost cause. It is only after his escape that he hears a general announce the Union Victory. While trying to work through his shame of being a coward, Henry encounters both dead and injured soldiers. In panic, a soldier hits Henry on the head with his rifle, which later is mistaken by the other soldiers as an injury inflicted from battle. I was impressed with how this book was just as much a psychological novel as one about war. Throughout the novel, Henry’s character is laid bare as he attempts to process his act of cowardice with later acts of bravery. Crane’s writing is done in such a way that we often feel sympathy towards Henry’s reactions to events as they unfold.\n\nNature is used to great effect in telling the story. From the use of trees to the weather, the setting is an important character in itself. I love the following passage:\n\n“Sometimes the brambles formed chains and tried to hold him back. Trees, confronting him, stretched out their arms and forbade him to pass. After its previous hostility this new resistance of the forest filled him with a fine bitterness. It seemed that Nature could not be quite ready to kill him.”\n\nAnother scene that stood out for me is the one where Henry throws a pine cone at a squirrel to prove the point to himself that, when faced with danger, an animal’s natural instinct is to run away. Henry goes through a gamut of thoughts and emotions in trying to justify his actions to himself. I thought the encounters with both the dead and the wounded were powerful. While the language might be considered timid by today’s standards, I think the writing has held up well even today.\n\nI noticed while reading that many of the characters, Henry included, are not referred to by name but rather, as physical descriptions, such as “the youth,” “the tattered soldier,” “the loud soldier,” and many others. Perhaps, Crane used those terms in order to depersonalize this large grouping of so many soldiers on the battlefield.\n\nStephen Crane wrote The Red Badge of Courage in only 10 days, an impressive feat considering the longevity of this novel. He would later find himself in demand as a war correspondent. Sadly, he would die at the age of 29 due to complications from tuberculosis. His goal of penning a novel reminiscent of the books he read as a boy resulted in a deeply psychological work that could be considered as the ultimate anti-war novel.\n\n“He vaguely desired to walk around and around the body and stare; the impulse of the living to try to read in dead eyes the answer to the Question.”\n\nThis book counts as my “19th Century Classic” for the Back to the Classics Challenge."
