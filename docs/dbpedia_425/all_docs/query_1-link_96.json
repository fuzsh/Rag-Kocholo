The story is set during the American Civil War and follows the experiences of a young soldier named Henry Fleming.\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Henry is eager to enlist in the Union Army and fight in the war, believing that it will be a grand adventure. However, as he experiences the realities of battle and witnesses the horrors of war, his idealism begins to crumble and he becomes consumed by fear and doubt.\n\nThroughout the novel, Henry struggles with feelings of cowardice and shame, as he witnesses other soldiers being wounded and killed in battle. However, he eventually finds the courage to face his fears and fight alongside his comrades.\n\nThe novel is known for its vivid portrayal of the psychological effects of war on soldiers, as well as its realistic depiction of the chaos and brutality of battle. It also explores themes of courage, honor, and the nature of heroism.\n\nMineola. NY. Dover Thrift Editions. 1990. 101p."
