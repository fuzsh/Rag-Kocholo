[iv], 233, [1], [4 ads] pp. Bound in publisher's tan buckram stamped in black, red, and gilt. Good, heavy foxing and some soiling to boards, former owner's name on front free endpaper, tidemark to inner margins of pages towards end. In the very rare original dust jacket, which appears to have been the same design throughout printings of the first edition. Jacket is a little better than Fair with tape stains and recent Japanese paper repair to verso, re-attaching the panels together. Verso is unsightly but rectos presents OK. Chipped along edges, small interior chip to spine panel, toning to spine as well.\n\nA major work of American fiction in its rare dust jacket, one of the most iconic of the rare 19th century dust jackets.\n\nItem #140944867"
