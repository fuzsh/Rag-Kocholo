Directed by John Huston, it was produced by Gottfried Reinhardt with Dore Schary as executive producer. The screenplay is by John Huston, adapted by Albert Band from Stephen Crane's 1895 novel of the same name. The cinematography is by Harold Rosson, and the music score by Bronislau Kaper. The making of this film is the subject of Lillian Ross's 1952 book Picture, originally in The New Yorker.\n\nThe American Civil War film is a sparse but faithful retelling of the story, incorporating narration from the text to move the plot forward. Audie Murphy, a hero of World War II who later went into acting, played the lead role of Henry Fleming. Other actors include cartoonist Bill Mauldin, Andy Devine, Arthur Hunnicutt and Royal Dano.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1862, a regiment of the Union Army, the 304th New York Infantry, is encamped near the Rappahannock River in Virginia. Orders direct the 304th to move upriver and engage a large Confederate force. Private Henry Fleming tells his comrades he is not afraid of dying. While on sentry duty, Henry exchanges words with an unseen Confederate soldier stationed across the river who tells Henry to watch out for the \"red badge,\" meaning a battle wound. The regiment confidently sets out, but Henry becomes increasingly pensive as the hour of battle approaches. His friend, Tom Wilson, tells Henry to give his watch to his parents if he is killed. During the battle, Henry is overcome with fear and deserts. He learns his outfit won the battle, but fears derision if he returns.\n\nHenry sees his wounded comrades, and wishes he, too, had a \"red badge of courage.\" Henry slips back into the regiment as they march. One of his comrades, Jim Conklin, is delusional from his injuries and dies from blood loss. Henry becomes separated from his unit when they run into a Union column attempting a hasty, disorganized retreat. A soldier becomes panic-stricken when Henry tries to calm him down and strikes him in the head with the stock of his rifle. Regaining consciousness, Henry meets a fellow soldier who escorts him back to the 304th. Henry falsely tells Tom his head injury was received in battle, and that their friend Jim is dead. Tom tells Henry his absence was not noticed due to the heavy casualties suffered. Confident in his lie, Henry is able to talk with the rest of his unit as if he too fought in the battle.\n\nThe 304th are sent back into battle to support a Union offensive. This time, Henry wildly charges toward the enemy with passion until he is ordered back into ranks. Henry and Tom fetch water at a creek and overhear an unnamed General plotting to sacrifice the 304th in a suicide attack. They report the news back to their regiment, but the soldiers chose to honor their duty and fight regardless. As men die around him, Henry sees the color sergeant get shot down, takes up the flag, and tries to rally his comrades. Henry meets the flag bearer for the Confederate troops, who falls dead. Henry briefly holds both flags as the 304th secures the defeated rebels. A soldier tells Henry and the regiment that he overheard their commanding officers lauding Henry's bravery. Henry admits to Tom that he deserted the day before, and that his shame made him return. Tom admits he deserted, too, but was caught and forced back into the battle. The 304th marches on as Henry contemplates the hope of a peaceful future.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAudie Murphy as Henry Fleming (aka The Youth)\n\nBill Mauldin as Tom Wilson (aka The Loud Soldier)\n\nDouglas Dick as The Lieutenant\n\nRoyal Dano as The Tattered Man\n\nJohn Dierkes as Jim Conklin (aka The Tall Soldier)\n\nArthur Hunnicutt as Bill Porter\n\nTim Durant as The General\n\nAndy Devine as The Cheery Soldier\n\nRobert Easton as Thompson\n\nWhit Bissell as Wounded Officer (uncredited)\n\nJohn Huston as Grizzled Union Veteran (uncredited)\n\nWilliam Phipps as Union Soldier (uncredited)\n\nWilliam Schallert as Union Soldier (uncredited)\n\nJames Whitmore as Narrator (voice, uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDirector John Huston used unusual compositions and camera angles drawn from film noir to create an alienating battlefield environment. He became frustrated when the studio cut the film's length to 70 minutes and added narration taken from the original novel following supposedly poor audience test screenings.[3]\n\nMuch of the history of the making of this film, considered by some a mutilated masterpiece, is found in Lillian Ross' critically acclaimed book Picture.[4] Of the stars who appear in the film, three served in World War II: Bill Mauldin the editorial cartoonist who created \"Up Front\", Audie Murphy served with the U.S. Army in Europe, and narrator James Whitmore served with the U.S. Marine Corps.[3]\n\nJohn Huston had high hopes for this movie, and even considered the original two-hour cut of the film as the best he had ever made as a director. After a power struggle at the top of MGM management, the film was cut from a two-hour epic to the 69-minute version released to theaters in response to its alleged universally disastrous previews. It never was released as an \"A\" feature but was instead shown as a second-feature \"B\" picture. Both Huston and star Audie Murphy tried unsuccessfully to purchase the film so that it could be re-edited to its original length. Huston did not waste any time fighting over it because he was focused on the pre-production of his next picture, The African Queen. The studio claimed that the cut footage was destroyed, probably in the 1965 MGM vault fire. Huston later was asked by MGM in 1975 if he had an original cut because the studio wanted to re-release it. Huston told them he didn't have one, and that it didn't exist. However, after this he instructed his agent Paul Kohner to include in all his future contracts a stipulation that he receive a 16 mm print of the first cut of any film he made.[5]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $789,000 in the US and Canada and $291,000 in other countries, resulting in a loss of $1,018,000. This made it one of the studio's least successful films of the year although it did not lose as much money as Calling Bulldog Drummond, Mr Imperium or Inside Straight.[1]\n\nComic book adaptation\n\n[edit]\n\nFawcett Motion Picture Comics #105 (July 1951)[6]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Red Badge of Courage\n\nList of films cut over the director's opposition\n\nList of incomplete or partially lost films\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
