        "text": "The Red Badge of Courage is based on the novel of the same name. The film tells the story of a Union soldier who is thrust into battle without proper preparation. He initially flees from the battle but desires to redeem himself and prove his courage.\n\nThe director, John Huston, used the film noir style that was popular at the time. In the post-World War II era, United States citizens were interested in reexamining their understanding of war and conflict. The issues of courage and desertion also reflect the era’s gendered values and definition of what it meant to be a brave, male soldier.\n\nThe film received modest acclaim and has been remembered as one of the first films seeking to show the experience of a Union soldier in the Civil War. While some film critics were unhappy with the muted display of war and battle, others found it to be a faithful adaptation of the novel.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nBooks\n\nStephen Crane, The Red Badge of Courage, Cambridge: W.W.
