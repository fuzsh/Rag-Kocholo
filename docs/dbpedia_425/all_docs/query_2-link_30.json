        "text": "Published thirty years after the Civil War, this \"impressionistic\" American classic tells a war story in a thoroughly modern way - without a trace of romanticizing. Through the eyes of ordinary soldier Henry Fleming, we follow his psychological turmoil, from the excitement of patriotism to the bloody realities of battle and his flight from it. In the end, he overcomes his fear and disillusionment, and fights with courage. The first great 'modern' novel of war by an American. For Sr. Highschool readers.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nStephen Crane (1871-1900) was a war correspondent, novelist, short story writer and poet. He is the author of Maggie, The Red Badge of Courage, George's Mother, and The Black Riders. Ernest Hemingway on The Red Badge of Courage: \"One of the finest books of our literature . . . it is all as much of one piece as a great poem is.\""
