In the story The Red Badge of Courage Stephen Crane shows the importance of having courage during this time period.

Additionally, Truth explains how equal rights for African - Americans is also important. The text states, “Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place!” This shows that white women get more respect than her just because she is African - American. Therefore, achieving equal rights during this time period is important according to Sojourner"
