        "text": "A teenager with dreams of glory enlists with the Union army in the American Civil War. With not much in the way of immediate action, Henry Fleming begins to have doubt and fear while waiting.\n\nThe author, Stephen Crane, was only 25 years old himself, and although he had no personal experience, he was able to give vivid descriptions that created suspense. It was a distinctive and naturalistic presentation that emphasized the true nature of war. Young Fleming eventually experienced his first battle and was caught up in fear unlike anything he had anticipated; no longer a case of “vague and bloody conflicts”, but a frightening reality. He displayed some early cowardice in running backwards from a battle. He saw firsthand the cursing and groaning of wounded men, was wounded himself, and witnessed the death of a close friend. He was ashamed of his early reaction but recovered his bravery and helped lead government forces back into battle to indeed win his “red badge of courage”. Listen now to the heart-rending story.\n\nOriginally published in 1895."
