        "text": "It’s shameful to admit, but I’ve not yet read Stephen Crane’s (1871-1900) great Civil War novel Red Badge of Courage (1895). This used to be required reading for high school students. Lord knows where I was that month. So, it was college where I first made Crane’s acquaintance, and this through his short stories and novellas.\n\nOne in particular remains seared in my memory, his “The Veteran,” (1896) which of all things happens to be the sequel to Red Badge of Courage. And while I cannot—for obvious reasons—draw out the connections between both texts, I’m saved by the fact that this short story is very much a stand-alone tale. It needs no context, and on account of its length, can be consumed in a few minutes.\n\nIt was presented first in McClure’s Magazine (1893-1929), which, like the Harper’s of old, used to publish the great literary lights of the day. I could not find early reactions to the story, though one might imagine—the fame of Red Badge notwithstanding—it touching a nerve. After all, the Civil War generation was very much alive as the turn of the century approached, and like the subject of the tale, Henry Fleming, were just now settling into their role as elder statesman in both private and public life.\n\nFleming, the subject of “The Veteran,” is now a grandfather. He talks before a small crowd of neighbors and his grandson who ask him about the war, curious if he ever felt fear.\n\n\"That was at Chancellorsville. Of course, afterward I got kind of used to it. A man does. Lots of men, though, seem to feel all right from the start. I did, as soon as I 'got on to it,' as they say now; but at first I was pretty well flustered.”\n\nThe conversation dances (everyone is polite to the war hero) around courage and fear. Fleming is not so different from his peers. If we take him at his word, he was made of ordinary stuff prior to the war. But the experience changed him. He learned, if that is the right word, courage. The virtue of courage, Crane forces the reader to reflect, is a curious. One cannot learn it theoretically. Reading Red Badge over and again will not turn the coward bold. And yet it still seems important for us to be reminded of courageous men and women. We delight and admire their stories. They serve as national models in every country.\n\nOld man Fleming, declined now in years, still retains the courage learned on the battlefield. The second part of “The Veteran” demonstrates this, as he rushes into a burning barn to save the livestock. He accomplishes this mission, a mission that ultimately takes his life, while other farmhands run in circles. He alone acts decisively. But he does not act wholly alone. His example spurs all the men (save one drunk Swede) to help as they are able. There is a lesson here.\n\n“The Veteran” provides much to think about. It is more, I think, than a straightforward tale about respect for our elders, respect for our veterans. It is that, of course, but it also presents the deeper philosophic problem that the virtues cannot be taught. They are not magically transmitted from one generation to the next without work. And this is real-life work, not classroom work.\n\nOne wonders today if Crane would despair at how this most enduring of projects is going in modern America."
