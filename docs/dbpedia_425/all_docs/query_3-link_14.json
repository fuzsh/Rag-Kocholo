But his dreams of valor are outweighed by his fear, and after one battle, Harry runs away. As he runs, he meets several wounded men whose “red badges of courage” make him even more ashamed of his cowardice. Henry returns to the front line and, inspired by the men who sacrificed their limbs and lives, fights with a passion he never knew he had. This is an unabridged version of the classic Civil War novel by American author Stephen Crane, first published in 1895."
