The Cincinnati Center City Development Corp. is replacing newspaper boxes it seized from CityBeat and other publications after city officials told the group to put them back.

Known as 3CDC, the non-profit development corporation last month began seizing distribution boxes belonging to CityBeat and other publications from sidewalks Downtown and in Over-the-Rhine.

The development group said it removed the boxes it described as abandoned and unsightly as part of its directive to help beautify the city through its recent merger with Downtown Cincinnati Inc.

But the City of Cincinnati did not sanction 3CDC’s actions and directed the organization to stop removing the boxes after learning of the situation, according to an email from City Solicitor Paula Boggs Muething, responding to an inquiry from Councilman David Mann.

3CDC had no right to remove the boxes in the first place, according to the city solicitor.

And while the City of Cincinnati has an ordinance regulating the news racks by creating special districts for them, the city hasn’t created the districts to allow it to enforce the ordinance.

3CDC had collected more than 100 boxes, including eight or nine belonging to CityBeat, a 3CDC spokesman said earlier this week. Other boxes seized included those for apartment and car advertising publications.

CityBeat, a weekly alternative newspaper in Cincinnati, accused 3CDC of violating its First Amendment rights by removing the boxes and restricting access to CityBeat's and others' content, which is protected under the U.S. Constitution.

"The First Amendment implications of the news rack removal would turn on whether 3CDC is a deemed a state actor, because the First Amendment only applies to entities acting in that capacity,'' Muething wrote in her email to Mann. "This is likely a question that will require interpretation by the federal courts.''
