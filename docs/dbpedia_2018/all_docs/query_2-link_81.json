        "text": "In the midst of the contemporary economic crisis for American commercial journalism, foundation-supported nonprofit media are widely hailed as the solution. But are they? And if so, what kind of solution do they offer? Foundation-supported nonprofit news media are deeply incorporated into the U.S. highly commercialized system of news production and circulation, in which most of the public is provided a steady menu of infotainment and sponsored content, while a small sector of in-depth (limited) critical news remains largely within the provinces of high cultural capital elites. Foundations provide the shaky bridge whereby nonprofits can find their footing between these sectors, without fundamentally challenging this stratified media system nor the broader finance-led capitalist order upon which it depends. This, in short, is the kind of “solution” foundations offer to the crisis of U.S. journalism.\n\nThis study of the explanatory report attempts to make a meaningful contribution to the history of the American newspaper by synthesizing existing historical knowledge of the form, documenting the history of the Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Journalism, and analyzing the explanatory reports that have won the Pulitzer Prize in this category. This study also offers insights from that history to suggest how newspapers in America might improve their products in the service of democracy. A fundamental strategy, as demonstrated in the exemplary reports identified by the Pulitzer juries, is the greater use of storytelling in explanatory journalism. Such a change might help increase readership and better serve the mandate of the American press to strengthen democracy through fostering discourse in the public sphere."
