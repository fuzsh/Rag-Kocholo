        "text": "66th Scripps Howard Awards\n\nJoin the Scripps Howard Foundation and host Michelle Miller, correspondent and co-host of “CBS Morning News” and “CBS This Morning: Saturday,” for the 66th Annual Scripps Howard Awards honoring excellence in American journalism.\n\nThe show will honor award-winning journalists who have changed outlooks, laws, political practices and our world. They represent the proudest tradition of a free press and exemplify the Scripps Howard Foundation’s purpose of “Giving light. Changing lives.”\n\nThe 2018 winners include news organizations large and small, from The New York Times, ProPublica and Frontline PBS, to the South Florida Sun Sentinel and The Dallas Morning News. (View the full list of 2018 winners.)\n\nReserve your tickets to the show:https://www.memorialhallotr.com/cincinnati-shows/scripps-howard-awards/ (Tickets are available on a first come, first served basis.)\n\nEvent details:\n\nApril 18, 2019\n\nMemorial Hall\n\n1225 Elm St.\n\nAwards Show: 6:45 p.m.\n\nAfter-party: 8:30 p.m.\n\nThe event is cocktail attire. Immediately after the show, guests are invited to a reception in Memorial Hall’s ballrooms. The show will be broadcast live on WCPO.com, Facebook and YouTube and rebroadcast on Newsy April 21.\n\nAbout the Awards\n\nWith a focus on high-impact reporting, the awards recognize journalism that spurs action, news organizations that go the extra mile to expose previously undisclosed or misunderstood information and journalists who embrace new tools, channels, technologies and approaches to provide more immersive experiences for their audiences.\n\nAmong categories including Visual Journalism, Environmental Reporting, Breaking News and Community Journalism, the Awards’ 66th competition continues with the Topic of the Year category, which will be announced at the live awards show April 18. The focus of the 2018 “Topic of the Year” category is “The Midterm Elections.”\n\nThe Scripps Howard Awards honor work from television stations, networks, radio and podcasts, visual media, online media outlets, independent producers, newspapers and print publications.\n\nThe Foundation’s corporate parent, The E.W. Scripps Company, is the presenting sponsor of the Awards. The Scripps Howard Awards show is produced in partnership with media sponsors, WCPO and Newsy.\n\nAbout Michelle Miller\n\nMiller’s reporting has earned her prestigious journalism awards including an Emmy for her reporting on the National Guard’s Youth Challenge Academy and an Edward R. Murrow Award for her coverage of a daycare center standoff in New Orleans. She was part of the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Award-winning team for coverage of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting. Miller earned a Salute to Excellence Award from the National Association of Black Journalists and was voted Woman of the Year by the National Sports Foundation. She has served on the Board of Advisors at Hampton University’s Scripps Howard School of Journalism and Communications.\n\nNearly 20 veteran journalists from newsrooms around the world made up the 2019 class of Kiplinger Fellows at Ohio University.\n\nThe newest class includes staff from national newspapers, large-market television and radio outlets, major daily newspapers as well as exclusive online journalists from the U.S. and abroad.\n\nSeveral fellows were chosen from outside the United States – including Spain, Moldova, Costa Rica, Belgium, and two from Canada. Nearly 400 journalists applied for the fellowship program, which took place April 7-12 at the Ohio University Scripps School of Journalism in Athens.\n\n“The talented pool of journalists wanting to participate in our fellowship is inspiring, but makes the selection process all the more challenging,” executive director Kevin Z. Smith said. “It’s always a difficult process to select the few who come. We believe this class is a great representation of the current state of global journalism with freelancers, online producers as well as those from legacy media coming to Ohio. These are excellent fellows.”\n\nSmith said the fellowship’s mission is to train and return the Kiplinger Fellows to their newsrooms (or home offices) armed with a new set of digital skills and the motivation to train others and improve the level of journalism worldwide.\n\nThe international 2019 Kiplinger Fellows include:\n\nAndrea Baillie, managing editor, The Canadian Press; Toronto, Canada\n\nJane Gerster, national features reporter, Global News; Toronto, Canada\n\nMadalin Necsutu, editor-in-chief, Evenimentul Zilei; Chisinau, Moldova\n\nCindy Regidor, correspondent, France 24; San Jose, Costa Rica\n\nTeri Schultz, freelance reporter, NPR, Deutsche Welle; Brussels, Belgium\n\nMiguel Toral, director, sinfiltros.com; Madrid, Spain\n\nThe U.S. 2019 Kiplinger Fellows include:\n\nKate Cook, city editor, Herald-Citizen; Cookeville, Tennessee\n\nBeth Fertig, senior reporter, WNYC public radio; New York, New York\n\nJoe Hernandez, reporter, WHYY public radio; Trenton, New Jersey\n\nJon Horn, reporter, KGTV; San Diego, California\n\nSrividya Kalyanaraman, editor, BostInno, Boston, Massachusetts\n\nLuz Lazo, transportation reporter, Washington Post, Washington, DC\n\nGinny McCabe, freelance reporter; Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nMegan Pratz, producer, Cheddar; Washington, DC\n\nMaria Luisa Rossel, correspondent, UNO-TV; Washington, DC\n\nColleen Shalby, engagement editor, Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles, California\n\nCharlotte West, freelance reporter; Seattle, Washington\n\nMax White, digital producer, WXYZ; Detroit, Michigan\n\nThe Kiplinger Program in Public Affairs Journalism is in its 46th year, spending the first 45 at Ohio State University. It has evolved since its founding, transitioning from a nine-month master’s program to a digital media fellowships in 2011. In addition to the weeklong fellowship, the program offers workshops and training across the globe. In 2018, the Kiplinger Program training reached nearly 1,200 journalists. Full information about the Kiplinger Program is available at www.kiplingerprogram.org.\n\nThe Kiplinger Program was endowed at Ohio State in 1973 by Austin Kiplinger in honor of his father, W.M. Kiplinger, one of the university’s first journalism graduates in 1912. W.M. Kiplinger pioneered a new kind of journalism when he became publisher of The Kiplinger Letter and later Kiplinger’s Personal Finance. He has been described by his son as “a dedicated journalist, a muckraker and an inspiration to young journalists… a very original thinker.”\n\nPulitzer Prize Administration Dana Canedy Gives Keynote Speech at SPJ Region 4 Conference\n\n“There Are No Shortcuts For Excellence,” She Tells Journalists In Cleveland\n\nBy Tom McKee\n\nWhen Dana Canedy talks, people listen. That’s because her life’s story is compelling. The career path that she’s followed in journalism is lined with awards. There’s been heartbreak as well.\n\nThrough it all, she’s always demanded excellence of herself as a reporter, writer, Pulitzer Prize Administrator, author and mother to a teenage son.\n\nThat’s why her message to 150 professional and student journalists at the Society of Professional Journalists Region 4 Spring Conference in Cleveland was so well-received.\n\n“You can’t give up. You can’t be deterred. Run in your own lane,” she said in a keynote speech at Cleveland State University. “Only compete with yourself.”\n\nCanedy’s journey began with her birth to a military family in Indianapolis, continued in the small Kentucky town of Radcliff and led her to the University of Kentucky to study journalism.\n\nHer first newspaper job was with the Palm Beach Post in Florida, then the Cleveland Plain Dealer and the New York Times in 1996. She was named a senior editor 10 years later.\n\n“I killed myself producing two or three stories a day,” she said. “I kept my head down. You can’t fake it in a room full of valedictorians.”\n\nShe described herself as an insecure overachiever – driven to write the best possible stories, but always wondering if they were good enough. She shrugged off criticism as learning opportunities.\n\nHer advice to both the professional and student journalists in the room was simple. Training, hard work and a willingness to take calculated risks will always produce spectacular results.\n\n“When you’re comfortable, it’s time to shake things up,” she added. “Don’t be afraid to do that.”\n\nSitting in the audience listening to the speech was a 13-year-old-boy who had heard that advice before.\n\nIt came from his mother, whom he accompanied to Cleveland.\n\n“My son is my religion,” Canedy proudly declared as the teenage Jordan beamed and blushed.\n\nIt’s a relationship that began with hope, was tested through tragedy and will soon be a story that every movie lover knows.\n\nJordan’s father was First Sergeant Charles Monroe King, Canedy’s fiancé. When King left for a tour of duty in Iraq, she gave him a journal to record his experiences for his then six-month-old son. The advice penned was about becoming a man, being responsible for your actions and other fatherly hopes and dreams. Nobody knew at the time how important the journal would become.\n\nThirty days before completing his tour, First Sergeant King was killed in action.\n\n“I collapsed on the floor when I heard the news,” Canedy said. She wondered how to turn such devastating loss into something positive.\n\nSuccess began by getting back on her feet and writing – turning the story into a New York Times essay.\n\nThen, the words of her fiancé became a book: “A Journal For Jordan: A Story of Love and Honor.”\n\nIt’s been translated into eight languages and published in 10 countries.\n\nThe book has been so well received that it will soon become a movie directed and co-produced by Denzel Washington.\n\n“I don’t know who is going to play me,” Caney quipped.\n\nIn the meantime, the job as Pulitzer Prize Administrator occupies her time along with helping counter the claims of President Trump that the mainstream media is fake news and journalists are the enemy of the people.\n\n“Nothing will change the need for quality journalism,” she said, adding that while jobs are being created that simply didn’t exist before, it’s tough to find sustainable financial models to pay for them.\n\nThe solution will be in collaboration and sharing resources to support local journalism. Caney says she remains hopeful about the state of the business for three reasons.\n\n“Look for opportunities for create good will with citizens, take a page out of President Trump’s playbook and use social media and marketing for our own good and find one thing a year to devote resources to.” She said.\n\n“Once you do that, apply for a Pulitzer Prize,” she concluded. “What we look for is excellence. Make us say, ‘I didn’t know that.’”"
