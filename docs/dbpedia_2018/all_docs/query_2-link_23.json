        "text": "More than 300 news publications across the United States have committed to a Boston Globe-coordinated effort to run editorials Thursday promoting the freedom of the press, in light of President Trump’s frequent attacks on the media.\n\nSome of the most respected and widely circulated newspapers in the country have committed to taking a stand in their editorial pages, including The New York Times, The Dallas Morning News, The Denver Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and the Chicago Sun-Times. The list ranges from large metropolitan dailies to small weekly papers with circulations as low as 4,000.\n\nThe Globe initiative comes amid the president’s repeated verbal attacks on journalists, calling mainstream press organizations “fake news” and “the enemy of the American people.” Tensions came to a boil in early August when CNN reporter Jim Acosta walked out of a press briefing after White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders refused to refute Trump’s “enemy of the people” comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta said he walked out of Thursday’s White House press briefing.\n\n‘‘We are not the enemy of the people,’’ Marjorie Pritchard, deputy managing editor of the Globe’s opinion page, told the AP last week.\n\nThe Globe’s request to denounce the “dirty war against the free press” has been promoted by industry groups such as the American Society of News Editors, as well as regional groups like the New England Newspaper and Press Association. The request also suggested editorial boards take a stand against Trump’s words regardless of their politics, or whether they generally editorialized in support of or in opposition to the president’s policies.\n\n‘‘Our words will differ. But at least we can agree that such attacks are alarming,’’ the Globe appeal said.\n\nAs of last Friday, 70 newspapers had committed to the initiative. By Tuesday, that number had grown to about 200, and the number jumped again to more than 300 on Wednesday.\n\nPritchard previously said the decision to reach out to newspapers was reached after Trump appeared to step up his rhetoric in recent weeks. He called the media “fake, fake disgusting news” at an Aug. 2 rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.\n\n‘‘Whatever happened to the free press? Whatever happened to honest reporting?’’ he asked at the rally, pointing to journalists covering the event. ‘‘They don’t report it. They only make up stories.’’\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPritchard said she hoped the editorials would make an impression on Americans.\n\n‘‘I hope it would educate readers to realize that an attack on the First Amendment is unacceptable,’’ she said. ‘‘We are a free and independent press; it is one of the most sacred principles enshrined in the Constitution.’’\n\nThis isn’t the first time the Globe’s opinion board has taken a stand against Trump and his policies. In April 2016, while Trump was still campaigning for president, the Globe’s opinion page ran a scathing editorial in its Sunday edition, accompanied by a satirical front page envisioning an America under a Trump presidency. Trump called the Globe “stupid” and “worthless” that Sunday during a rally in New York.\n\nThe following is a list, updated Wednesday afternoon, of news organizations that have committed to running editorials on Aug. 16:\n\nAkron Beacon Journal\n\nAlbuquerque Journal\n\nAlpena News\n\nAmerican News\n\nAmes Tribune\n\nAnderson Observer\n\nAnniston Star\n\nArizona Daily Star\n\nArizona Daily Sun\n\nAthens News\n\nAthol Daily News\n\nAtlantic City Weekly\n\nAustin American Statesman\n\nBaltimore Sun\n\nBangor Daily News\n\nBeaverton Valley Times\n\nBerkshire Eagle, Bennington Banner, Brattleboro Reformer, Manchester Journal\n\nBig Bend Sentinel and Presidio International\n\nBismarck Tribune\n\nBluff Country Newspaper Group (six separate newspapers)\n\nBoise Weekly\n\nBoston Business Journal\n\nBozeman Chronicle\n\nBristol Herald Courier\n\nBrockton Enterprise\n\nBrunswick News\n\nBucks County Courier Times\n\nBurlington County Times\n\nCannon Beach Gazette\n\nCape Cod Chronicle\n\nCape Cod Times\n\nCape Cod Times\n\nCapeCodWave.com\n\nCenter for Public Integrity\n\nChagrin Valley Times\n\nChicago Sun Times\n\nChico News and Review\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChronicle Express\n\nChronicle-Telegram\n\nCincinnati City Beat\n\nCitizen Chronicle\n\nCitrus County Chronicle\n\nCoachella Valley Independent\n\nColumbian Progress\n\nColumbus Dispatch\n\nCommercial News\n\nCommercial Review\n\nCommonwealth Journal\n\nConcord Monitor\n\nConnersville News-Examiner\n\nCourier Sentinel\n\nCrawford County Independent\n\nDaily Free Press\n\nDaily Globe\n\nDaily Hampshire Gazette\n\nDaily Herald\n\nDaily Ledger\n\nDaily News\n\nDaily Times\n\nDallas News\n\nDalles Chronicle\n\nDarien Times\n\nDaytona Beach News-Journal\n\nDeadline Detroit\n\nDeerfield Valley News\n\nDenton Record-Chronicle\n\nDenver Post\n\nDes Moines Register\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nDeWitt Observer\n\nDixon’s Independent Voice\n\nDodgeville Chronicle\n\nDuluth News Tribune\n\nDyersville Commercial, Manchester Press, and Cascade Pioneer\n\nEau Claire Leader-Telegram\n\nEcho Press\n\nEdgefield Advertiser\n\nEl Diario\n\nErie Times News\n\nEssex Media Group\n\nEstacada News\n\nEugene Weekly\n\nExaminer Media: The Examiner, White Plains Examiner, Northern Westchester Examiner, Putnam Examiner\n\nFalls City Journal\n\nFarmington Daily Times\n\nFayette Advocate\n\nFenimore Times\n\nFinger Lakes Times\n\nFolio weekly\n\nForest Grove News-Times\n\nForum Home\n\nFrancesville Tribune\n\nFreeman South Dakota Editorial\n\nFresno Bee\n\nFulton County News\n\nGarden City News\n\nGarretson Gazette\n\nGaston Gazette\n\nGettysbrug Times\n\nGlasgow Daily Times\n\nGrant County Herald\n\nGreenboro Reporter\n\nGreenwood Commonwealth\n\nGresham Outlook\n\nGriggs County Courier and Steel County Press\n\nGrosse Pointe News\n\nHardwick Gazette\n\nHartford Courant\n\nHighlands News Sun\n\nHillsboro Free Press\n\nHillsboro Tribune\n\nHolland Sentinel\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat\n\nHood River News\n\nHoughton Lake Resorter\n\nHouston Chronicle\n\nIdyllwild Town Crier\n\nInsider NJ\n\nIslip Bulletin and Long Island Advance and Suffolk County News\n\nJackson Citizen Patriot\n\nJamestown Sun\n\nJennings Daily News\n\nJersey Journal\n\nJohnson Newspaper Corp.
