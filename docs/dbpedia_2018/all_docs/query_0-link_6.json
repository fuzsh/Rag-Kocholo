By the way, how is Comrade Bushki on immigration? Let 'em in? Sounds socialist to me...........\n\nActually, the Post hasn't been much of an alternative political voice for some time, and that's pretty much the only way a paper can be an alternative voice, in editorials. The Enquirer has been crap for a long time, and it will be the next one down the chute.\n\nShame, either way, it was nice having two papers.\n\nWe old folks can remember when the Post would endorse every non -Gop candidate regardless of qualifications for the job while the Enquirer would endorse every GOP candidate.\n\nFunny, but maybe City Beat could fill that void if it were not so anti-everything.\n\nCan we expect anything from Peter Bronson other than his usual conservative posturing? Probably not. That's what the old dinsaurs around here want.\n\nMy conservative friends, I have been making an effort to watch Meet the Press and the other Sunday a.m shows when candidates are interviewed at length. I saw Giuliani the other day, and will keep watching. Should be interesting.[/i]"
