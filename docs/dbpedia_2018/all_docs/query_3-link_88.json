        "text": "Like most local news media right now, our readership is at an all-time high, but revenues are at a new low.\n\nSince we are a free publication and website, 100% of the CityBeat’s’ revenue comes from locals being able to gather in public — in restaurants, bars, theatres, museums, parks and at our own events and festivals. We've always loved bringing people together and our livelihood depends on it. But now, everything has changed. Advertising revenues from restaurants, bars, theaters, concerts, festivals and retail have completely dried up. And our “side hustle” of events isn’t going to do the trick while we are all practicing healthy social distancing.\n\nTo ensure that we can continue to keep our doors open and deliver local news to you for free, we have launched the CityBeat Press Club. This donation-based membership group has been created to build a community around our readers and strongest supporters at a time that local media across the country has been struggling, and to help underwrite our work in the face of the devastating loss of revenue caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWe are asking, if you believe in what we do and want to see us continue doing it, that you consider showing your support financially, and join us. We want to meet you at the next local concert or town hall. We want to see you in local restaurants and your favorite Cincinnati bars. And most of all, we want you to keep reading, and we want to keep informing you, our community, about what’s going on in this city that we call home.\n\nCityBeat is committed to keeping our print and digital products free, and now we’re asking the community we serve to support the local journalism you deserve and have come to expect. This campaign has been in the works for some time, but present circumstances have increased our urgency. Once this passes, we want to make sure we’ll still be here with you. And we appreciate your support.\n\nHow do you join? It’s simple -- donate to our Editorial team by clicking on the donate button below. You can choose a one-time of $15+ or recurring donation, in increments of $6/mo. or more.\n\nWhat’s in it for you? As if the warm and fuzzy feeling that comes with knowing that you’re supporting local journalism wasn’t enough, you’ll receive exclusive content, perks and swag throughout the year.\n\nAt a time when local reporting is critically important, support from our readers is essential to our future.
