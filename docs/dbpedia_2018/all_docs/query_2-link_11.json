        "text": "Overview of mass media in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States\n\nThe Cincinnati metropolitan area is a large, three-state media market centered on Cincinnati, Ohio, slightly overlapping the Dayton media market to the north. The Cincinnati market is served by one daily newspaper, The Cincinnati Enquirer, and a variety of weekly and monthly print publications. The area is home to 12 television stations and numerous radio stations. The E. W. Scripps Company was founded in Cincinnati as a newspaper chain and remains there as a national television and radio broadcaster. The term \"soap opera\" originally referred to Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble, which created some of the first programs in this genre.[1]\n\nDaily\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer (known as The Kentucky Enquirer in Northern Kentucky)\n\nWeekly\n\n[edit]\n\nCincinnati Business Courier\n\nCincinnati CityBeat\n\nJournal-News Pulse\n\nLa Jornada Latina\n\nThe American Israelite\n\nThe Cincinnati Herald\n\nThe Miami Student (biweekly)\n\nThe News Record (thrice-weekly)\n\nThe Northerner\n\nXavier Newswire\n\nMonthly\n\n[edit]\n\nCincinnati\n\nThe Catholic Telegraph\n\nSuburban\n\n[edit]\n\nJournal-News\n\nDefunct\n\n[edit]\n\nFairfield Echo\n\nHamilton JournalNews\n\nThe Cincinnati Post (known as The Kentucky Post in Northern Kentucky)\n\nThe Middletown Journal\n\nThe Western Star\n\nBroadcast radio\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 13-county Cincinnati metropolitan area (including Northern Kentucky and Southeast Indiana) is the 30th largest radio market in the United States, with an estimated 1.8 million listeners aged 12 and above as of September 2016 .[2] Of the market's 22 metered radio stations, iHeartMedia owns seven, Cumulus Media owns five, Hubbard Broadcasting owns four, Urban One owns three, and Cincinnati Public Radio owns two.\n\nCurrently, radio stations that primarily serve the Cincinnati metropolitan area include:[3][4]\n\nAM stations\n\n[edit]\n\n550 WKRC Cincinnati (Conservative talk)\n\n700 WLW Cincinnati (Talk/sports)1\n\n740 WNOP Newport, KY (Catholic-EWTN)\n\n910 WPFB Middletown (Catholic-EWTN)\n\n1050 WGRI Cincinnati (Gospel)\n\n1160 WCVX Florence, KY (Christian)\n\n1230 WDBZ Cincinnati (Urban talk)\n\n1320 WCVG Covington, KY (Gospel/brokered)\n\n1360 WSAI Cincinnati (Sports)\n\n1450 WMOH Hamilton (Conservative talk)\n\n1480 WDJO Cincinnati (Oldies)\n\n1530 WCKY Cincinnati (Sports)1\n\n1 clear-channel station\n\n2 daytime-only station\n\nFM stations\n\n[edit]\n\nAsterisk (*) indicates a non-commercial (public radio/campus/educational) broadcast.\n\n88.3 WAIF Cincinnati (Community/variety)*\n\n88.9 WMWX Miamitown (Community/classic rock)*\n\n89.1 WKCX Crittenden, KY (Christian)*\n\n89.3 WMKV Reading (Adult standards/MOR)*\n\n89.7 WYHH Highland Heights, KY (BBN)*\n\n89.9 WLHS West Chester (Adult standards/MOR)*\n\n90.1 WORI Harrison (Air1)*\n\n90.9 WGUC Cincinnati (NPR/classical)*\n\n91.7 WVXU Cincinnati (NPR/talk)*\n\n92.5 WOFX-FM Cincinnati (Classic rock)\n\n93.3 WAKW Cincinnati (Contemporary Christian)*\n\n94.1 WNNF Cincinnati (Country)\n\n94.9 WREW Fairfield (Adult contemporary)\n\n95.7 WVQC-LP Cincinnati (LPFM/variety)*\n\n96.5 WFTK Lebanon (Active rock)\n\n97.3 WYGY Fort Thomas, KY (Country)\n\n97.7 WOXY Mason (Regional Mexican)\n\n98.5 WRRM Cincinnati (Adult contemporary)\n\n99.1 WHKO Dayton (Country)\n\n100.3 WOSL Norwood (Urban AC)\n\n101.1 WIZF Erlanger, KY (Mainstream urban)\n\n101.9 WKRQ Cincinnati (Contemporary hit radio)\n\n102.7 WEBN Cincinnati (Mainstream rock)\n\n103.5 WGRR Hamilton (Classic hits)\n\n104.3 WNLT Delhi Hills (K-Love)*\n\n105.1 WUBE-FM Cincinnati (Country)\n\n105.9 WNKN Middletown (Classic country)\n\n106.7 WNKR Williamstown (Classic country)\n\n107.1 WKFS Milford (Contemporary hit radio)\n\nDefunct\n\n[edit]\n\nWJVS/Cincinnati\n\nWLMH/Morrow\n\nWMH/Cincinnati (1921–23)\n\nWNSD/Cincinnati (1972–78)\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 15-county Cincinnati metropolitan area (including Northern Kentucky and Southeast Indiana) is the 36th largest local television market in the United States, with an estimated 868,900 television-viewing households and cable penetration at 56.5% as of January 2016 .[5][6]\n\nThe Cincinnati market is served by the following television stations:\n\nBroadcast\n\n[edit]\n\n5 WLWT-TV Cincinnati (NBC) (Cable 5)\n\n9 WCPO-TV Cincinnati (ABC) (Cable 9)\n\n12 WKRC-TV Cincinnati (CBS) (Cable 12)\n\n14 WPTO Oxford (PBS)\n\n19 WXIX-TV Cincinnati (Fox) (Cable 3)\n\n25 WBQC-LD Cincinnati (Telemundo)\n\n36 WDYC-LD Cincinnati (Daystar)*\n\n43 WKOI-TV Richmond, IN (Ion Television)*\n\n48 WCET-TV Cincinnati (PBS) (Cable 13)\n\n54 WCVN Covington, KY (KET)\n\n64 WSTR-TV Cincinnati (MyNetworkTV) (Cable 11)\n\nAsterisk (*) indicates channel is a network owned-and-operated station.\n\nCable\n\n[edit]\n\nBally Sports Ohio\n\nSpectrum News 1 (Kentucky)\n\nDefunct\n\n[edit]\n\nWOTH-CD/Cincinnati (1998–2018)\n\nSportsChannel Cincinnati\n\nSpectrum Sports\n\nDayton television stations are also available over the air and on cable systems in Cincinnati's northern suburbs.\n\nPublishing companies\n\n[edit]\n\nCBD Media\n\nFranciscan Media\n\nStandard Publishing\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
