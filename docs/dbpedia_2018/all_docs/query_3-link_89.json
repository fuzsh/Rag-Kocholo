        "text": "This morning, CityBeat launched its brand new website at citybeat.com, showcasing the same award-winning local journalism, but with a sleeker, more user-friendly design.\n\nHosted by Foundation, the new site is just plain faster, more responsive and features friendlier URLs for sharing. But readers will also notice quite a few improvements, like better search functionality, streamlined content categorization, vertical scrolling on slideshows (which means no more clicking from right to left!), easier ways to find and upload local events, and more robust theater, film and music listings.\n\nWe also think you’ll enjoy the improved Best Of Cincinnati presentation, and the redesigned location pages, featuring maps, information, related stories and related events. Plus, if you’re a business owner, there’s an option to submit your own updates for new locations.\n\n“This new site is such an exciting development for CityBeat. CityBeat is and always has been Greater Cincinnati’s completely free source of independent news, culture, music, arts and eats since we began 27 years ago. Our core mission is to be an alternative voice in the media landscape and to share informative, thought-provoking, investigative and entertaining stories — all accessible to every single person, both in print and online, without any kind of paywall,” Maija Zummo, Editor-In-Chief, said. “This new version of citybeat.com is an extension of that belief, offering all the information we provide with the added bonus of being more streamlined and easier to use than ever before.”\n\nWe encourage you to explore the new site, kick the wheels and let us know if there’s anything we missed.\n\nAbout CityBeat"
