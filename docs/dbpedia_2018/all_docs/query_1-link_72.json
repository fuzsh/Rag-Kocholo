        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - The Kansas City Chiefs and kicker Harrison Butker have agreed on a contract extension that makes the three-time Super Bowl champion the highest-paid kicker in the NFL.\n\nButker, 29, announced on social media Monday that he’d agreed to a four-year deal. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported the deal keeps Butker in Kansas City through the 2028 season.\n\n“There’s no place I’d rather be than with the Chiefs,” the now eighth-year kicker said in a post on X. “Excited to finalize a 4 year extension. To the Heights!”\n\nBLOG: Chiefs resume training camp in St. Joseph as first preseason game nears\n\nButker’s 89.14 percent career field goal percentage is second-best in NFL history among qualified kickers.\n\nThe Georgia Tech product has been a part of all three Super Bowl-winning Chiefs teams in the past five seasons. In Super Bowl LVIII, Butker made the longest field goal in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe 29-year-old made the game-winning kick in Super Bowl LVII when the Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles -- and made a game-winning field goal to help them reach that game when Kansas City beat the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship Game two seasons ago.\n\nThis off-season, Butker made headlines after giving a controversial commencement speech at Benedictine College. In the fallout, Butker’s jersey became one of the most popular jerseys in the NFL.\n\nNFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport said Butker represented himself in the negotiations. Butker joins Chris Jones as members of the Kansas City Chiefs who are the highest paid at their position heading into the 2024 season."
