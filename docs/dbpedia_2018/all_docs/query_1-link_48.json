The Enquirer won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for local reporting for its project titled “Seven Days of Heroin.”\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nFunded by / Ownership\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer is owned by the Gannett Company, best known for its flagship newspaper USA Today. The paper is funded through a subscription and advertising model.\n\nAnalysis / Bias\n\nIn review, local news is covered by journalists with minimal bias, such as this: Two Cincinnati Police vice unit officers under federal investigation, prosecutor confirms. The national news is covered with a link to USA Today. Editorially, the Cincinnati Enquirer endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for President, though they have endorsed a balanced mix of left and right candidates in the past. In general, the opinion page leans left with more stories favoring the left but still balanced.\n\nIn general, straight news is low biased, and editorially, there is a slight lean left.\n\nFailed Fact Checks\n\nNone in the Last 5 years\n\nOverall, we rate the Cincinnati Enquirer as Least Biased based on neutral news reporting and a minimal left-lean editorially. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact-check record. (7/12/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 01/19/2024)"
