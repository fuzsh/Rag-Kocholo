The constantly changing merchandise selection includes antique doors and windows, funky Atomic Age-colored sinks and toilets, vintage ranges and even authentic clawfoot tubs — like real period-piece tubs removed from historic homes. And besides doing good by reusing and recycling old materials, Building Value is also a funnel to benefit the Easterseals, which is committed to breaking down barriers to employment for people with disabilities.”"
