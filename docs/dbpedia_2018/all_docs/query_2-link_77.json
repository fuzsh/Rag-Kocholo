        "text": "In keeping with the Ethics/Religion and Society Focus' purpose of encouraging the ethical and religious analysis of socially significant issues, Xavier University has established a speaker series to bring to campus prominent intellectuals and public leaders having diverse perspectives on a specific issue. The speakers present a public lecture or presentation, followed by discussion and a reception. E/RS also sponsors community roundtables and other forms of public discussion.

But now is not a time to tear down. It is a time to build and rebuild by committing ourselves to the institutions around us. From the personal and local to the national and political, these institutions provide the forms and structures we need to be free. By taking concrete steps to help them be more trustworthy, we can renew the ties that bind Americans to one another.\n\nYuval Levin is director of Social, Cultural, and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute; editor of National Affairs; and author of A Time to Build: From Family and Community to Congress and the Campus, How Recommitting to Our Institutions Can Revive the American Dream.\n\nMonday, April 5, 2021, 4:30-5:45 pm\n\nco-sponsored by the Stephen S.

How Cincinnati Journalists Earn it and Keep it\n\nWho do you trust? How Cincinnati Journalists earn it and keep it. Between print, broadcast, digital and social media, we have access to more news and information than ever before. The upside if a wealth of opportunities to learn and grow. The downside is a wealth of mis- and dis-information. From cries of 'fake news' to propaganda placement, how do citizens know what information to trust?

He will give a talk, \"The Habit Stance: Cultivating Ethical Implicit Attitudes,\" in the evening and a workshop on implicit bias and higher education during the afternoon in the Center for Teaching Excellence.\n\nLecture (7 p.m.): \"The Habit Stance: Cultivating Ethical Implicit Attitudes\"\n\nWhile it is clear that implicit attitudes are malleable, there is much to learn about the most effective techniques for changing them. Brownstein argues for treating implicit attitudes as if they are habits. The cultivation of ethical habits involves at least three elements: pre-commitment to plans; rote practice; and attention to situational influences on behavior. He considers current research on these techniques, identifies open questions for future experimentation, and addresses conceptual concerns about the nature of ethical action.\n\nCTE Workshop (3 p.m.): \"Simple Strategies for Complex Problems: Implicit Bias and Higher Education\"\n\nResearch suggests that implicit biases affect higher education in a number of ways: in faculty hiring, grading, classroom atmosphere, and more. While there is no single easy fix for these problems, university faculty and staff can embrace simple solutions to combat unintended biases. Brownstein will present both \"institutional\" and \"individual\" tactics for promoting more inclusive and egalitarian outcomes in higher education. Room CLC 309.\n\nOctober 25: Adam Konopka on Sustainability and Philosophy\n\nAdam Konopka is the Besl Chair in Ethics/Religion and Society. He is currently completing his manuscript Ecological Investigations: A Phenomenology of Habitat (Routledge, forthcoming) and teaches courses on ethics and environmental philosophy at Xavier.\n\nLecture (7 p.m.): \"What is Sustainability? A Philosophical Perspective.\"\n\nSustainability has become the central theme of recent mainstream environmental discourses and practices and has been defined in various economic, scientific, and policy terms. A common element in the various definitions of sustainability concerns an inter-temporal relationship to future human generations. The Brundtland Commission, for example, defines sustainable development as \"the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability the future generations to meet their own needs.\" This talk examines the relationship between present and future generations and clarifies some of the philosophical assumptions involved in this relation. In particular, the clarification of the some of the structures of intergenerational relationships helps address some of the interdisciplinary puzzles involved in sustainability discourses and imagine newer and more authentic sustainable practices.\n\nNovember 15: Carlos Eire on \"Mysticism as Anit-Protestantism\"\n\nNovember 16: Sally Haslanger on Feminism and Racism\n\nSally Haslanger is Ford Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT, and an affiliate in the MIT Women's and Gender Studies Program. Her research interests include analytic metaphysics and epistemology, ancient philosophy (especially Aristotle), and social and political philosophy, feminist theory and critical race theory. Haslanger's book Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique (Oxford 2012), collects papers published over the course of twenty years that link work in contemporary metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language with social and political issues concerning gender, race, and the family. It was awarded the 2014 Joseph B. Gittler Prize for \"outstanding scholarly contribution in the field of the philosophy of one or more of the social sciences.\"\n\nLecture (7 p.m.): \"Disrupting Racism: Social Meaning and Social Movements\"\n\nDescription: Racism and other forms of injustice are more than just bad attitudes; after all, such injustice also involves unfair distributions of goods and resources. But attitudes play a role. How central is that role? The cognitivist argues that racism is an ideology that consists in false beliefs that arise out of and serve pernicious social conditions. In this lecture Haslanger agrees that racism is an ideology, but in her view, ideology is deeply rooted in social practices. Social practices are patterns of interaction that distribute things of value, guided by cultural meanings. Unjust practices rely on social meanings that are internalized as habits of mind that distort, obscure, and occlude important facts and result in a failure to recognize the interests of subordinated groups. How do we disrupt such practices to achieve greater justice? Haslanger argues that this is sometimes, but not always, best achieved by argument or challenging false beliefs, so social movements legitimately seek other means.\n\nIn addition to the evening talk, Dr. Haslanger will offer an afternoon workshop on Feminist Epistemology at 2pm in CLC 308.\n\nSeptember 10 - The E/RS Interviews: \"The American Experience: Community, Equality, Environment\"\n\nIn the first of six E/RS interviews, Father Graham and Paul Colella (Philosophy) will discuss dimensions of \"the American experience\" based on both their personal experiences and academic pursuits.

In Consumed Barber examines how markets \"corrupt children, infantilize adults, and swallow citizens whole\" effectively undermining the health of our democracy and the environment. Co-sponsored by the Brueggeman Center and Sustainability Committee.\n\nDr. Barber will be a part of two events on September 14. The first event is Xavier's Sustainability Day, where Barber will discuss issues of Consumption Justice and his book Consumed.

Poetry Reading, Community Blend (Coffee Shop in Evanston), 7 p.m.\n\nNovember 12 - The Cooperative Economy: A Panel on Cooperatives in Cincinnati\n\nIn spring 2016, E/RS will host a major conference on cooperative business. As a lead up to the conference, there will be a panel session focusing on the blossoming cooperative movement in Cincinnati. How do we build a more inclusive and cooperative economy? With a shrinking middle class, growing inequalities, and fluctuating global markets what kind of social and economic models can sustainably support communities in need? There are three standard social and economic models available: 1) government models, 2) for-profit models, and 3) non-profit models. But, these models are not meeting the needs of many struggling communities. A fourth additional option is the cooperative model, which is inclusive, compassionate, environmentally sustainable, and collaborative in ways the standard three models are not. The aim of the panel is to investigate the fourth model as an option for communities in Cincinnati.\n\nThe Cintas Center, Duff Banquet Room, 7 p.m. Free and open to the public.

The \"yellow peril\" is one of the most long-standing and pervasive racist ideas in Western culture-indeed, his book traces its history to the Enlightenment era. While Fu Manchu evokes a fading historical memory, yellow peril ideology persists, animating, for example, campaign commercials from the 2012 presidential election.\n\nKennedy Auditorium, CLC, 7pm.\n\n2013-2014 Speakers\n\nGayatri Spivak\n\nSeptember, 19, 2013 at 7:00 PM\n\nJames and Carolin Duff Banquet Center in the Cintas Center\n\nProf. Spivak is director of the Center for Comparative Literature at Columbia University.
