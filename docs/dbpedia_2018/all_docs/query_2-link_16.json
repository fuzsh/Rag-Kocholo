        "text": "The Cincinnati Fringe Festival (Cincy Fringe) is a 13-day theatre and arts festival produced by Know Theatre of Cincinnati. Live performances occur in over a dozen locations in and around the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, just north of Downtown. Every Festival features 200+ performances of over 40 productions from local, national, and international artists, each featuring unqie styles or disciplines and a wide variety of subject matter.\n\nDuring the festival we also have one-night-only Special Event presentations, like True Theatre’s storyingtelling event featuring artists,trueFRINGE, and a performance by Know’s house improv team, OTRimprov. We also have Visual Fringe projects, including photography/art installations and a brand new mural each year on the side of Know Theatre by the talented folks at Higher Level Art. On top of all that, each night concludes with the Cincy Fringe Bar Series, a post-performances party at Know Theatre (Fringe Headquarters) which starts off with an installment of the Channel Fringe Hard-Hitting Action News Update — your infotaining source for all Fringe news — and features special themes and events like 60-Second Previews, Fringe Olympics, Fringe Prom, Fringe-a-oke, and a lot of other opportunities for artists, audience, volunteers, and staff to mingle, drink, and have a great time.\n\nCincinnati is proud to be among the hundreds of cities in the world that can call themselves home to a Fringe Festival.\n\nWait, wait, wait…there's more than one? What the heck are these Fringe Festivals all about?\n\nIt's often hard to supply one concise definition for Fringe theatre, but, succienctly, it's safe to say that Fringe productions are usually very experimental, whether in style or subject matter, and vary greatly from performances you usually see in mainstream theatre. Fringe shows are also very barebones, meaning there are few complicated technical aspects. All Fringes trace their roots back to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, which began in 1947 and has inspired countless other Fringe Festivals around the world since.\n\nFor more information about the history of Fringe theatre, check out this handy Wikipedia article!\n\nGetting Around\n\nWhere can I park?\n\nOur beloved neighborhood has seen quite the increase in visitors over the past few years, making parking a bit more difficult.\n\nWe recommend parking at the Gateway Quarter/Kroger parking garage located at 10 E Central Parkway, the Gateway Quarter Parking Lot located at the corner of 12th and Vine Street, the Mercer Commons Parking Garage off of Vine, or the garage below Washington Park next to Music Hall. Any of these options put with within walking distance of all venues in the festival.\n\nIf you DO park on the streets, however, please keep in mind that meters in Downtown/OTR now run until 9pm every day of the week. Fortunately, there is a handy smartphone app available now so you can pay your meter remotely. For more information on street parking rules, regulations, and payment options, visit the City of Cincinnati's website.\n\nCan I walk to the venues?\n\nYes! We work hard to keep all venues at Cincy Fringe with a walkable distance. All performances space are typically within a six block radius (~10 minute walk) of the Fringe Headquarters at 1120 Jackson St. 45223.\n\nIs there a map of the venues?\n\nThere is a map on the back of the Offical Fringe Guide, distributed by our Media Partner, Cincinnati CityBeat. The guide is issued in the mid-May edition of CityBeat and can subsequently be found at all venues around the festival, including Know Theatre. You can also download a .pdf of just the map once the guide is available. This map also includes discount at business you'll see in our neighborhood. Bring in your ticket stubs or passes and tell them the Fringe sent you!\n\nBox Office Information\n\nHow can I buy tickets or passes?\n\nYou can purchase tickets or passes online by visiting our Performance page. You can also call 513.300.KNOW(5669) to reserve your tickets or passes in advance over the phone.\n\nWhat are your box office hours?\n\nBefore May 31, Know Theatre's box office is typically open 11am – 6pm Monday through Saturday. From May 31 – June 11 (during the Festival) the box office hours are 10am – 10pm.\n\nWhere can I buy tickets in person?\n\nYou can visit the Festival Headquarters box office at Know Theatre during normal business hours for any ticket or pass purchase needs. Venue box offices can only sell certain passes and only tickets for their upcoming performance, so prevent anguish by purchasing everything you need in advance!\n\nIn advance\n\nAdvance tickets can be purchased at the Fringe Festival Headquarters (Know Theatre of Cincinnati, 1120 Jackson Street) prior to 2pm on the day of the performance in person or over the phone. After 2pm on the day of the performance, advance tickets can no longer be purchased until the venue box office opens, thirty minute prior to the performance time.\n\nAt the venues\n\nVenue box offices will open thirty minutes prior to the performance time. After 2pm on the day of the performance, advance tickets can no longer be purchased until the venue box office opens.\n\nDo I have to buy my tickets in advance?\n\nYou don't have to! Sometimes the spirit of Fringe moves you to suddenly see a show you weren't expecting. BUT, if you know exactly what you want to see and when, we strongly reccomend reserving your tickets in advance.\n\nHow do the passes work?\n\nFull Frontal: All Access Pass\n\nFull Frontal passes are non-transferable passes (meaning one per person) that can be used to both reserve tickets in advance at Headquarters and gain entry at venue box offices. Full Frontal passholders also get to vote for their very own Pick of the Fringe Award.\n\nVoyeur: Six Show Pass\n\nVoyeur six show passes can be used flexibly (more than one person can use a single pass) for six entries into any festival event. These passes can only be used in ONE of two ways: 1) Six advance tickets may be reserved over the phone or in person with box office headquarters for pick-up at venue box offices. 2) Voyeur pass can be used as a punch card for tickets at venue box offices. Once a physical voyeur pass is issued, advance reservations can no longer be made over the phone. Patron must bring physical pass to Festival Headquarters to reserve advance tickets.\n\nWhen does the venue house open?\n\nVenue houses will open fifteen minutes prior to the scheduled show time.\n\nWhat if I get there late?\n\nNO LATECOMERS WILL BE SEATED. Avoid disappointment. Be on time.\n\nWhen I purchase a ticket, where does the money go?\n\nEvery time you purchase a ticket for a Fringe Festival performance, 50% of your admission price goes directly to the artists who created that show. The Fringe Festival exists to foster the creation of new work. Thank you for helping to support independent artists with every ticket you buy."
