Revenue is derived from advertising.\n\nAnalysis / Bias\n\nThe Cincinnati CityBeat covers local arts, food, culture, music, entertainment, and news for the Cincinnati Metro Area. Local news is generally reported via staff writers, with some in-depth pieces. Straight news uses minimally loaded words such as this: Fifty West Brewing Announces Reopening of Original Brewpub in Columbia Township. News stories are generally sourced through quotes, first-hand accounts, or hyperlinks.\n\nEditorially, the Cincinnati CityBeat leans strongly left with progressive opinion/news pieces such as these: In Abortion Rights Victory, Kentucky Voters Shoot Down Constitutional Amendment and My Gift to my Grandson is to Sound the Alarm of the Impending Climate Disaster. Generally, story selection moderately favors the left, while opinion-oriented pieces use strong emotional wording to denigrate the right. Most information is sourced properly.\n\nFailed Fact Checks\n\nNone in the Last 5 years\n\nOverall, we rate the Cincinnati CityBeat Left Biased based on story selection that mostly favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.
