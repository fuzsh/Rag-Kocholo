Life in Cincinnati has a discernible rhythm. A pulse. A beat. It takes a wily alternative newspaper to measure the contradictions and rhythms of daily life here. And that’s why CityBeat exists. To pick up on the beat of a city struggling to compete in the new millennium while firmly rooted in — some would say shackled to — traditions of the past.

Our overriding goal has always been and remains to give voice — through the news, arts and entertainment sections — to those in the community who are under-covered or ignored by Cincinnati’s conservative mainstream media.
