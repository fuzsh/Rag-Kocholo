Over those years, he enjoyed several stints on the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies board of directors and was president of the Society of Professional Journalists Cincinnati chapter. He later joined 3CDC to open, staff and program Washington Park, immersing himself in Over-the-Rhineâ€™s economic renaissance and entrepreneurial spirit.
