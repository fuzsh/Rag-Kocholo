        "text": "Only Fools and Horses' Cassandra Trotter, played by Gwyneth Strong, had a turbulent on-screen relationship with Rodney Trotter, marked by numerous break-ups often sparked by false infidelity accusations or her ambitious nature.\n\nThe couple also faced the heartbreak of a miscarriage during their time together.\n\nHowever, they eventually found their happy ending, welcoming a daughter named Joan, in tribute to Del Boy Trotter and Rodney's late mother.\n\nOff-screen, Gwyneth leads a blissful life with her TV star husband, Jesse Birdsall, known for his roles in Footballers' Wives and Hollyoaks.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in 2000 and have two children together - Oscar, born in 1988, and Lottie, born in 1991.\n\nJesse rose to fame playing playboy Marcus Tandy in the BBC soap Eldorado, which followed the lives of wealthy expats in Spain.\n\nDespite the show only running for a year, it gave Jesse significant exposure, leading to his role as manager Roger Webb in Footballers' Wives.\n\nJesse Birdsall, known for his roles in popular soaps and dramas, has had a few brushes with the law, including a conviction for actual bodily harm in 1981 and a Â£1,000 fine in 1999 following an unprovoked attack on a pub-goer in London.\n\nBoth Jesse and Gwyneth Strong have starred in EastEnders, but at different times, reports the Daily Star.\n\nJesse first appeared on the soap in 2012 as the jilted fiance of Sharon Watts.\n\nGwyneth made her entrance to Walford in 2016, portraying Geraldine Clough, the head of The Vic's rival darts team. Jesse took on the role of Fraser Black in Hollyoaks between 2013 and 2014 before moving to Holby City as Steven Fletcher in 2018.\n\nHe also stars as Ali in the film The Pebble and the Boy."
