        "text": "Every comedy fan across the UK, and beyond, will know exactly who Cassandra Trotter from Only Fools and Horses is. From 1989 until the final episode of the BBC sitcom in 2003, actor Gwyneth Strong portrayed the wife to Rodney Trotter and the long-suffering sister-in-law to cockney Del Boy, mangetout!\n\nDespite marrying into a wheeling-dealing family from Peckham, Cassandra is a sensible, intelligent, and rather boujee addition to the Trotter clan and is completely spoiled by her businessman dad, Alan, who sees her as the apple of his eye. In Rodney and Cassandra's romance, opposites did really attract!\n\nGwyneth, 63, has racked up a brilliant long list of television credits during her acting career including parts in EastEnders, Casualty, New Tricks, Doctors, and many more. But the Londoner isn't the only one in her family to hit television screens, as her husband is also a very famous actor!\n\nREAD MORE: Grange Hill and Only Fools and Horses actress Paula-Ann Bland unrecognisable after quitting showbiz\n\nSo who is Gwyneth married to?\n\nLet's rewind the clock to before Towie and Love Island ever hit our TV screens and Footballers' Wives was the drama of the noughties. The ITV show followed the woes of the women married to members of the Earls Park football team.\n\nNever short of gripping drama or a plot twist, it had everything from murder, love, and lust and aired between 2002 and 2006. Football manager Roger Webb was played by Jesse Birdsall. Gwyneth married Jesse back in 2000 and they share two children together.\n\nTV actor Jesse, 58, from Highbury, kicked off an acting career back in 1970s with roles in the series Headmaster, Centre Play and Graham's Gang, and has been in showbiz ever since. During the early 90's he landed the part in BBC soap Eldorado as Marcus Tandy.\n\nLike his wife Gwyneth, he has also starred in EastEnders as John Hewland in 2012, with other acting roles including Doctors, Casualty, Foyle's War, As If, Bugs, and The Bill.\n\nMost recently Jesse played Fraser Black in Hollyoaks between 2013 and 2014 before joining Holby City as Steven Fletcher in 2018. He also plays Ali in new movie The Pebble & the Boy.\n\nWant more from MyLondon? Sign up to our daily newsletters for all the latest and greatest from across London here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
