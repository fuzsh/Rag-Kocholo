Now Jesse has been signed up by Hollyoaks producers to play the love interest of Sandy Roscoe, played by Gillian, according to The Sun.\n\nJesse also played Costa del Sol bad boy Marcus Tandy in the BBC soap flop Eldorado, which ran for just one year until 1993, and he also appeared in a couple of episodes of EastEnders in 2012.\n\nSandy's son Joe (Ayden Callaghan) sets up Jesse's character Fraser Black with his mum to try to tempt her away from Dodger Savage (Danny Mac) and towards someone her own age.\n\nA source said: \"Fraser's arrival will really shake things up."
