        "text": "Only Fools and Horses first hit our screens four decades ago and has been the centre of British television ever since.\n\nThe laugh-out-loud comedy, created and written by the late great John Sullivan, is centred around the chaotic lives of wheeler-dealer Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter and his younger brother Rodney.\n\nA staggering ratings hit, the legendary show still holds the record for the highest UK audience for a sitcom episode with 24.3 million viewers tuning in for 'Time on Our Hands' in 1996.\n\nRead more TV and film news here\n\nIt was such a popular sitcom that it led to a number of spin-offs, including The Green Green Grass, prequel Rock & Chips, and even a musical adaptation in 2019.\n\nStars such as David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst became instant household names as they delved through their trials and tribulations.\n\nFollowing the sad news that actor Patrick Murray, who starred as Mickey Pearce in the sitcom, has been diagnosed with cancer, we take a look at where the stars of Only Fools and Horses are now.\n\nDavid Jason - Del Boy\n\nOne of the most iconic characters in the history of television, Del Boy was the charismatic trader who could sell just about anything to anyone.\n\nThe sarcastic salesman was always up to some sort of scam before he eventually decided to settle down with his wife Raquel.\n\nAlthough he made a household name for himself as Del Boy, Sir David Jason was actually only considered for the part after the original star who was cast for the role turned it down.\n\nDavid made the part his own, even introducing Del's cheap gold jewellery and trademark camel coat on a whim.\n\nHe has indicated he would love to take up the role of Del Boy one last time.\n\nSir David was knighted for services to acting and comedy in 2005 and has won four BAFTAs, four British Comedy Awards and seven NTAs.\n\nMore recently, he appeared as Detective Inspector Jack Frost until retiring from the role in 2010 and has also starred as Granville in Open All Hours and was part of the cast for The Darling Buds of May.\n\nNicholas Lyndhurst - Rodney Trotter\n\nRodney, who was played by Nicholas Lyndhurst, was Del Boy's awkward and sometimes ‘dumb’ younger brother who often fell for his sibling’s pranks and scams.\n\nHaving been raised by Del, Rodney was very dependent on his brother during the show.\n\nAlthough he attempted to lead a much straighter life, and get away from his get-rich-quick schemes, Rodney could never seem to escape his brother’s wrath.\n\nPopular actor Nicholas went on to star in an array of sitcoms including Goodnight Sweetheart, The Two of Us and After You've Gone.\n\nLyndhurst's family suffered a heart-breaking tragedy in 2020 when 19-year-old son Archie died in his sleep from a brain haemorrhage caused by acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukaemia.\n\nIt was recently rumoured that Nicholas had quit acting after the tragedy, but his representatives have since denied this.\n\nJohn Challis - Boycie\n\nJohn Challis tragically passed away at 79 years old following a long battle with cancer in September last year.\n\nHis family said in a statement at the time that the actor died \"peacefully in his sleep, after a long battle with cancer\".\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we bring you such sad news,\" the family statement read.\n\n\"Our dear friend and yours, John Challis, has died peacefully in his sleep, after a long battle with cancer.\n\n\"He will always be loved for being 'Boycie' and leaves a great legacy of work that will continue to bring pleasure and smiles for many years to come.\"\n\nJohn was in his late 30s when he landed the role of Boycie, with the part initially just for one scene before his character became more prominent in the series.\n\nThe much-loved actor also starred in its spin-off The Green Green Grass from 2005 to 2009 and the ITV sitcom Benidorm from the seventh series onwards.\n\nLennard Pearce - Grandad\n\nOne of the original cast members, Lennard Pearce played Grandad from the very beginning of the sitcom.\n\nBefore appearing on the comedy, the actor had worked alongside the likes of Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins and appeared in plays including My Fair Lady and Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nGrandad was rarely seen out of his armchair in front of his TV sets but he was treated as a butler by Del Boy and Rodney.\n\nTragically, Lennard unexpectedly died midway through filming the fourth series in 1988 from a heart attack aged 69, leaving the entire cast and crew devastated.\n\nBuster Merryfield - Uncle Albert\n\nUncle Albert was introduced into the sitcom after the sad death of Lennard Pearce.\n\nAlthough he did not have much acting experience, actor Buster Merryfield was chosen for the part due to his distinctive white beard.\n\nBuster had been an amateur dramatics actor and did not make it his main profession until he was 57.\n\nHis character could be mostly found reminiscing about his wartime experiences with the Royal Navy.\n\nAlbert, who was Grandad's estranged brother, became famous for his catchphrase \"during the war...\"\n\nBuster died in 1999 at the age of 78 as a result of a brain tumour.\n\nUncle Albert's death was then written into the next episode as a tribute.\n\nTessa Peake-Jones - Raquel Turner\n\nRaquel first appeared in the 'Dates' special and her appearance was intended on being a one-off.\n\nHowever, she quickly became a permanent character due to the fact producers wanted to bring in more female characters to the sitcom.\n\nRaquel also soon became a recurring love interest of Del Boy.\n\nThe pair remained the central romance on the series and the lovebirds eventually welcomed their son, Damien.\n\nActress Tessa stayed with the sitcom until it ended in 1996 with the episode 'Time on Our Hands'.\n\nShe then went on to return for the revival specials from 2001, making her final appearance as Raquel in 2003 special 'Sleepless in Peckham'.\n\nThe actress has since starred in a number of UK dramas including Midsomer Murders, Doctors, Casualty, Holby City and Doctor Who.\n\nTess actually got married to co-star Douglas Hodge who played an adult version of her on-screen son Damien in Only Fools special 'Heroes and Villains'.\n\nThe couple have two children together and were together for 27 years until they split in February 2013.\n\nSue Holderness -

This has since been removed.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he would not have been able to tweet his message if he had not have had the ultrasound and urged people to get checked before he thanked the NHS for their hard work.\n\nPatrick made a total of 20 appearances on the show and went on to land roles in big-screen productions, including The Firm and Curse Of The Pink Panther.\n\nAfter his acting career, he became a taxi driver in Kent before quitting work altogether amid his battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nKenneth MacDonald - Mike the Landlord\n\nMike Fisher was the long-suffering although slightly dim-witted landlord of the Nags Head in Only Fools and Horses.\n\nGood-natured Mike was often subjected to Del Boy's scams and always struggled to get him to pay off his bar tab.\n\nActor Kenneth MacDonald died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 2001 aged just 50 while on holiday with his family in Hawaii.\n\nOn hearing of MacDonald's death, David Jason said: \"It is a terrible shock.
