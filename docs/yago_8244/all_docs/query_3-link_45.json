        "text": "If you've never heard of the soap Eldorado (it's likely the younger amongst you haven't), it's down to the fact that its existence was short-lived as the show was axed after only two seasons when it briefly began airing on BBC One back in 1992. After 156 episodes, the show was pulled from the schedule as it failed to produce high enough ratings to continue on.\n\nThe soap can only be described as being a bit like EastEnders but without the iconic Queen Vic and the gloomy buildings, and instead replaced with blue skies and beautiful beaches. Actually on second thought, it's a bit of a stretch to compare in to Walford.\n\nJesse Birdsall - Marcus Tandy\n\nFor many of the actors who had roles on the soap, it was a stepping stone for greater success in their career paths later in the future. Actor Jesse Birdsall played lead character Marcus Tandy. The 59-year-old went on to star in a few British hits such as The Bill, Midsomer Murders, and Holby City.\n\nREAD MORE: This Morning slammed by viewers over 'boring' cleaning segment\n\nJesse is married to a famous actress loads will know from her popular sitcom Only Fools and Horses. The actor wed Gwyneth Strong, who played Cassandra on the show and have been together ever since. The couple share two children, son Oscar and a daughter named Lottie.\n\nJulie Mare Fernandez - Vanessa Lockhead\n\nAnother El Dorado star was Julie Mare Fernandez, from London, who had a major part in the show portraying Vanessa Lockhead. Eight years after the soap's cancellation, Julie bagged herself a role in the much-loved British sitcom, The Office, starring alongside Ricky Gervais.\n\nDerek Martin - Alex Morris\n\nDerek Martin, best-known for playing Charlie Slater on EastEnders, was also part of the cast. Derek starred in Eldorado as Alex Morris, and the 88-year-old made guest appearances in many television programmes, including Doctor Who.\n\nHe was also in The Sweeney episode \"Messenger of the Gods\" as the villain Spooner, Upstairs, Downstairs, The Bill and Only Fools and Horses.\n\nPatricia Brake - Gwen Lockhead\n\nMeanwhile actress Patricia Brake played Gwen Lockhead on the soap. Ever since then, she appeared in TV series such as No Hiding Place and A Sharp Intake of Breath with David Jason, and also had film roles in My Lover, My Son, The Optimists of Nine Elms.\n\nCampbell Morrison - Drew Lockhead\n\nScottish actor Campbell, who played Patricia's on screen other half, Drew, had plenty of TV experience before he was given a part on the show. He appeared in the likes of Taggart and The Bill and, after Eldorado, returned to The Bill as well as appearing in EastEnders playing DCI Charlie Mason in 1996 and Sky's cult favourite football drama Dream Team.\n\nSadly, the actor died in 2008 at the age of 55.\n\nLeslee Udwin - Joy Slater\n\nJoy Slater actress Leslee Udwin was famous for owning her own bar - just like Linda Carter from EastEnders. Since the show, Joy has gone on to set up her own production company called Assassin Films. The actress produced some renowned filmed including hits such as East is East, Mrs Radcliffe's Revolution and West is West.\n\nRoger Walker - Bunny Charlson\n\nSome will remember Roger for playing Bunny as they watched him first rock up in Spain with 17-year-old bride Fizz in 1992. Before the soap, Roger had appeared in countless shows including The Darling Buds of May, Bodger and Badger and Emmerdale as well as having roles in Casualty, Peak Practice, The Bill and EastEnders.\n\nSandra Sandri - Pilar Montero\n\nSandra Sandri, who played Tandy's girlfriend Pilar Montero, was one of the few cast members actually from Spain. Apart from starring in the film 'Searching for Love' in 2004, it is not known what Sandra has done since then.\n\nPolly Perkins\n\nAs one of Eldorado's most iconic characters, Trish who was played by Polly Perkins, had an memorable storyline focused on her relationship with toy boy Dieter. Since her Eldorado days, Polly, now 78, become famous for appearing on EastEnders as Dot's half sister Rose in 2011 and 2012.\n\nWant more from MyLondon?
