        "text": "Soap fans from the 1990s will remember Eldorado which followed the lives of British ex-pats living in Los Barcos, Spain. Produced by EastEnders creator Tony Holland, the BBC show launched in 1992 and lasted a year before being pulled after 156 episodes.\n\nEldorado viewers will recall Marcus Tandy, the shady wheeler-dealer who had a keen eye for the ladies. The attractive lothario delivered the show's final line as he prepared to sail off into the sunset and told his girlfriend Pilar: \"you can't trust anyone these days, can you?\".\n\nActor Jesse Birdsall played Marcus Tandy in the BBC One soap before famously starring as Roger Webb in the ITV drama Footballers' Wives between 2004 and 2006. The 59-year-old has also starred in a long list of popular TV shows including The Bill, Casualty, New Tricks, Bugs and Midsomer's Murders.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders Alice Branning star Jasmyn Banks is unrecognisable with stunning new look 9 years after soap exit\n\nIn 2012, Jesse arrived in EastEnders as John Hewland, the fiancé of Sharon Watts, for a short stint, and most recently, he played Fraser Black in Hollyoaks and Steven Fletcher in Holby City. However, off-screen the actor is married to another very famous TV Star.\n\nJesse is the husband of Only Fools and Horses icon Gwyneth Strong who played Cassandra Trotter in the famous BBC sitcom. The 62-year-old arrived on the show in 1989 and played the role of Rodney Trotter's wife Cassandra until the final Only Fools episode aired in 2003.\n\nJesse and Gwyneth, from London, got married in 2000 and have two children together - Oscar, born in 1988, and Lottie, born in 1991.\n\nLike her other half, actress Gwyneth has racked up a long list of television credits during her acting career including parts in EastEnders, Casualty, New Tricks, Doctors, and many more.\n\nAlthough their relationship is generally kept out of the public eye, the happy couple appeared on ITV's All-Star Mr & Mrs, presented by Phillip Schofield, in 2015.\n\nFor more Only Fools and Horses stories click here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
