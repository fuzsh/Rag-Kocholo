Maude told us about her time at 111 where the family moved when Maude was 9. Maude remembers the great wooden doors between their house and the neighbours which served the three houses on each side until the bomb which hit Bean street “blew them to smithereens”. (The mine dropped on Bean street the night of Friday 14th/Saturday 15th March 1941 caused extensive damage. Casualties included 19 killed and 22 seriously injured). She remembers the Street as rather well-to-do until after the war when the Council bought two houses (198 and 199 she thinks) and moved in some families whose children played in the street and threw tin cans “not like us”. She thought perhaps they had been evicted from elsewhere. Maude (jun.) left in 1947 but it appears her father continued to live here at least until the 1952 electoral roll [before the properties were turned into flats].\n\n1938 Robinson: May Foster; Boynton, Gladys Ada.\n\n1938-1945-1946 Robinson: Maude.\n\n1938-1945-1946-1952-1959 Robinson: George T. {There are flats in 1965/81 with no Robinsons listed-RBH}.\n\n1953 Alteration to flats by Wm.

Hull Truck was started By Mike Bradwell and John Lee who knew each other from schooldays in Doncaster. After each of them had completed their further education they got together and started an unnamed Theatre company in London. They wanted to produce plays which were outside the regular theatre circuit, playing in universities, schools, pubs and clubs. this was at the time a new approach. Since London was expensive and the boys were young and hard up, they moved with the ‘game’ half of their theatre company to Hull. Here they found it cheaper to rent the whole of 71 than it was to rent a tiny flat in London. This gave them the opportunity of living in two of the flats whilst using the “freezing cold” attic as rehearsal space. In the early months they had only a paraffin heater for warmth. The Hull Truck Theatre Company was born with the help of generous donations from some of the famous people they wrote to asking for funding. Notable among these benefactors were Warren Mitchell and The Samuel Beckett Foundation with £50 and best wishes from each. During their brief stay in Coltman Street (around twenty months) They wrote and produced three plays, two childrens’ plays and a cabaret. They finally left because “they forgot to pay the rent”. Even though they were gaining excellent reviews they were still a young theatre company with a tight budget!\n\n1976 Flat 1 – Fuller: Audrey, Joseph L.\n\n1981 Flat 1 – Dickson, Andrew W.

Max was a shipowner by trade and little is known of how he came to work for the secret service. He was arrested for running a spy ring in Germany in 1911 where he served seven years hard labour. Unfortunately, the people of Hull didn’t realise what Max was doing for us and his family (as many other German Jews did at the time) suffered abuse and the house was stoned. [Have we changed much?] The family name was changed to Hilton and Max’s efforts took a heavy toll on his relationships with his family. He died aged 49 from the stress of his spy agency work, even whilst a prisoner, and the treatment of his family for their German Jewish heritage.\n\n1905-1906 Hathaway, Joseph.\n\n1920 Hilton, George.\n\n1920-1930 Shultz/Hilton, Mrs. Sarah.\n\n1938 Harper: George Nelson..\n\n1938-1939-1946 Harper: Frank.\n\n1938-1939-1945-1946 Harper: Ena Lois.\n\n1938-1939-1946-1952 Harper: George William; Gertrude Hannah, Ivy.\n\n1952 Harper: Elizabeth, Ronald.\n\n1959 Salmon: Malcolm A.\n\n1959-1965 Salmon: Albert A\n\n1959-1965-1970-1976 Salmon: Mary A.\n\n1965 Salmon: Joan M.\n\n1965-1970 Salmon: Mary S.\n\n1970 Salmon: Daniel R., Keith L., Sylvia E.\n\n1970-1976 Salmon: Kathleen S.\n\nc. 1988 Beech close built.\n\nNo. 83\n\nThe original house no longer exists.
