He was also on the Royals, a championship basketball team at the Waterville Boys Club.\n\nTom and Susan traveled to remote regions worldwide while officiating the international Eco Challenge adventure races, providing medical and wilderness rescue for this televised event. They hiked thousands of miles on the Appalachian trail system. When Scott Paper Mill closed, Tom served as a ranger at Baxter State Park, a job he loved. Tom and Susan were a remarkable team who volunteered countless hours with the Wilderness Rescue Team. Tom loved golfing with his friends, always playing with fairness and good humor. He was never at a loss to tell a joke, quick to lend a helping hand, laugh, and forgive.\n\nIn 1967, at the age of 20, Tom served as a combat Marine, 3rd battalion, 3rd Marine, Mike company, engaging in brutal warfare in Quang Tri Province, Dong Ha, Con Thien, The Rock Pile, and lastly Hill 861, in Khe San, where his battalion was the first of three divisions required to take the hill, with devastating losses. It was there he was wounded a second time. In a letter written home he said, “It was the worst day of my life.” Tom endured the loss of numerous friends (his band of brothers). Suffering two combat wounds, Tom received the Purple Heart. His life was altered permanently by the brutality of war.\n\nTom was able to rise above this and live an exemplary life – quick witted and free with his welcoming smile. Tom fostered countless friendships including an international circle of friends at their vacation destinations in South Carolina. Tom led by example: he stood tall and true to his convictions. He was a man of his word and truthful to a fault. As a loyal friend, he stood rock solid. As a husband and father, he was a tender hearted, gentle, loving man. He was someone to feel safe with. He was a fierce protector and lover of animals and nature.\n\nIn his 33 years as a millwright at Scott Paper Co., Tom maintained good-natured relationships. If there was a prank, Tom was involved. Tom was the president of his Union of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for several years. Tom’s negotiations bridged gaps between management and labor. His skills encompassed a talent for compromise with respect and professionalism.\n\nAt work he was called “TL”, to his siblings and lifelong friends he was “Tommy”, and to his children he was “Daddy” and “Pappa”. As within most loving marriages that have spanned 54 years, the terms of endearment grew and were only voiced in private. July 19 of this year marked what should have been 55 years.\n\nTom is survived by his wife Susan; and two children, son, Christopher, of Lewiston, and daughter, Jennifer Assaf, of Oakland, and husband Rony Assaf; sisters Helen Lohnes Berman, of New York, and Susan Jane Lohnes Graves (husband, Greg), of Bloomington, Indiana; brother, Barry Lohnes (wife, Susan Mullhuland Lohnes), of Topsham; as well as three generations of extended family.\n\nTom will be interred at the Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery, 163 Mount Vernon Rd., Augusta, on Tuesday, October 10, at 10 a.m., with full military honors.

CYR\n\nWATERVILLE – Theresa Rita Cyr, 98, passed away peacefully on Saturday evening, August 12, 2023, at the Alfond Center for Health, Augusta. She was the last surviving sibling of 14 children. Born December 30, 1924, in Fairfield, the daughter of Azarie and Amanda (Quirion) Julia, Theresa spent her childhood on the family farm and graduated from Lawrence High School.\n\nHer strong musical interests led her to play the trombone in the band, the violin in the orchestra, and her singing in the Glee Club. Neighbors always noted that Theresa and her two sisters, when walking to and from school, would always be singing in harmony. On Saturday nights the sisters would sing and entertain the guests that came to the family farm on the upper Ridge Road. It is notable to credit Theresa, as a freshman in high school, with her winning first prize in the Spring Junior Reading contest for her dramatic presentation of The Seagulls Are Calling poem. Also athletic, and, carrying on the Julia tradition, she played basketball and was a cheerleader.\n\nFollowing high school, Theresa worked at the C. F. Hathaway Shirt Factory, in Waterville, as a collar stamper and quickly decided to become a nurse. She studied at Sisters Hospital, in Waterville, and did her internship at Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital, in New Jersey. They liked her so much they offered her a job, but she wanted to come home. She did so and began working at Sisters Hospital.\n\nAs fate would have it, Sisters Hospital would put on an annual Nurses Ball. The one year she decided not to go to the event, her best friend, Christine Connally, convinced her to go because she wanted to introduce Theresa to a handsome French-speaking gentleman named Real Cyr. She accepted the blind date, met Real (the love of her life) and the two were married during the coldest, stormiest day of the year that next January.\n\nTheresa continued as a maternity ward nurse until the first of her five children arrived that December. Theresa was a strong advocate for her children and taught her children about the great value of a good education. Mother and wonderful homemaker, she later returned to her nursing career that lasted 25 years.\n\nTheresa lived in Winslow most of her life and attended St. John Catholic Church, where she sang bass in the choir for years. She loved being with people and enjoyed her sweet doll collection full of baby faces, lace, and personality. Her hobbies included reading, knitting, baking, ceramics, golfing, and she enjoyed traveling with her family. Theresa loved having guests over to the house and together would sing and play the piano. Living very close to the high school football field, on game day Theresa, with open arms, invited friends over to warm their toes during many a cold football halftime. Many memorable and rousing Whist and bid Whist card games were played where cards being placed on the table “WITH VIGOR” would cause the table to jolt, shake, and bounce up off the floor.\n\nShe loved being around people and shared her zest for life with all. Helping people whenever she could, and, having an infectious and loving smile, her typical good humor and nature brought simple joys to others each day. Being kind and forgiving, Theresa truly cared about people and loved company. Expect correction if you said “goodbye” instead of “au revoir” as you went out the door. She would always end your visit by saying “I’ll see you out the window.” As you left her home, be it Beacon Street or Woodlands, you would most times see Theresa peeking out the window and waving. It was a loving wave and meant “enjoyed your company, love you and hope you come back soon.” Theresa Rita Cyr knew what was important in life.\n\nTheresa was predeceased by her parents; her husband, Real; her eight brothers, Azarie Julia, Jr., Phil Julia, Edmund Julia, Norman Julia, Roland Julia, Florian Julia, Alexander Julia, Arthur Julia; and her five sisters, Lillian Gilbert, Adrienne Poulin, Bernadette Perry, Evangeline Vigue and Florence Sears.\n\nShe is survived by her children, Richard Cyr and wife MaryEtta, Jeanne Pelletier and husband Alan, Susan Cyr, Victoria Dute-Martinez and husband Nicholas, Andrew Cyr and wife Susan; many grand and great-grandchildren.\n\nA Mass of Christian burial was held on Wednesday, August 23, at Notre Dame Church, 116 Silver St., Waterville. Burial followed at St. Francis Cemetery, Grove Street, Waterville.\n\nFond memories and expressions of sympathy may be shared at http://www.VeilleuxFuneralHome.com for the Cyr family.\n\nArrangements are under the care and direction of Veilleux and Redington Funeral Home.\n\nMARY FESSENDEN\n\nOAKLAND – Mary Fessenden died peacefully in her own home on Tuesday, August 15, 2023, following a long fight with cancer.\n\nMary was very proud that she had earned her Massage Therapist certification in Virginia Beach, Virginia, in 2010, and kept her Maine license current. She used her training and knowledge to start a small Maine business she called Mary’s Therapies. She loved helping people improve their health and live a more eco-friendly life style. She made soaps, lotions, bug sprays, and other custom products using all natural ingredients and essential oils.\n\nMary worked at Thomas College, in Waterville, for more than five years, where she was the face of the food service division and in close daily contact with the entire student body and staff. She was well known on the campus and loved by all. Her friendly demeanor, ready smile, and a hug when needed helped many an incoming freshman to adjust to the pace of campus life.\n\nBefore moving to Maine in 2012, Mary was a long-time resident of Norfolk, Virginia, where she ran the local VFW canteen for over 10 years. It was there that she met her future husband, Landon St. Peter. She was a lifetime member of VFW Auxiliary Post #3160, in Ocean View, Virginia, and was well respected in the veteran community for all her volunteer work and organizational skills.\n\nMary loved a party and she loved to cook for friends and family. A small gathering could become a major event because she wanted to invite everyone. A recent Easter dinner for 12 became dinner for 28 before everyone sat down to eat. Folding chairs and trays were rounded up, folks ate in the kitchen and living room and a great time was had.\n\nHer wit and good nature will be sorely missed.\n\nA Celebration of Life was held at Wheeler Funeral Home, in Oakland, Saturday August 19, from 2 to 4 p.m. Please share your memories and pictures on her memorial page https://my.gather.app/remember/mary-fessenden\n\nArrangements are under the care of Wheeler Funeral Home, 26 Church St., Oakland, ME 04963.\n\nRONALD R.

Born July 13, 1927, in Anson, Lois was the first-born child and only daughter of Paris Leroy and Martha Ellen (Dudley) Mosher.\n\nAt the age of two, young Lois and her family would move back to the family farm on Mosher Hill, in Rome. It was in this farmhouse, passed down from several generations of the Mosher family, that Lois and her brother would be raised. Lois cherished every memory of her childhood growing up and “raising Cain” on the farm with her younger brother “Bud.” As a girl, Lois would work on the family farm and waitress at Jamaica Point Camps.\n\nShe would begin her formal education in a one-room schoolhouse in Rome; in 1945, she graduated from Williams High School, in Oakland. Looking to expand her future, Lois furthered her education at Thomas College, in Waterville, living with her Aunt Louise during her time there. In 1946, she graduated from the school’s business program. For a short while, Lois went to work as an assistant to James Boyle, of Waterville.\n\nSoon after she finished her formal schooling, a young man began courting her. Just back from the Navy serving in the Second World War, Richard “Dick” H. LaBelle found the love of his life. On November 25, 1950, the Rev. George Wolf would marry Richard and Lois, in Fairfield. Lois and Dick would settle with their young and growing family on their panoramic Jamaica Point farm. Lois could look just north and see her childhood homestead, then south to see the beauty of Great Pond.\n\nIn 1969, Lois would join her husband in founding Dick LaBelle’s Plumbing. While “Dad” went off to plumb each day, Lois would remain back in the home to keep the business finances and maintain a watchful eye on her five young children. She would also spend a tremendous amount of time devoted to keeping the farm.\n\nLois was born and raised in a Christian family and she lived every day well-grounded in the Lord. She would see every moment as an opportunity to witness about her faith and show the power of God’s love. Lois strived to be a faithful testimony to all those she was around. For over 45 years, Lois attended the Rome Baptist Church. It was at this small church in Rome Hollow that Lois would follow in her mother’s faithful footsteps as a Sunday School teacher to share God’s Word with young children.\n\nIn 1991, Lois and Dick found a new home church in North Belgrade Baptist Church. Pastor Terry and Jackie Tiner would guide the church and become dear friends of the family. In their later years, North Belgrade Baptist Church would become Lakes Christian Fellowship, and the new leadership, Pastor George and Barbara Finnemore would play a most important role in shepherding Lois through her final years and days.\n\nLois loved the family farm and she loved Jamaica Point. In the winter, you would enter her kitchen and be overcome by the aroma of a fresh-baked treat just out of the oven. She would always keep an eye on the stove, ensuring there was always a fresh stick of wood ready to keep the great heat churning. There were countless conversations to be had around the kitchen table with so many friends and family. Each spring, Lois would begin the process of cleaning the yard, preparing for the summer guests to pass by. Once a week throughout the summer, one would find that Lois had traded in her signature skirts and heels for a pair of dungarees and a ball cap; she spent countless hours riding her Wheel Horse tractor, manicuring the vast lawn surrounding the farmhouse. As the garden came to fruition, “Gram” would can an assortment of vegetables, relishes, and pickles to fill the pantry.\n\nLois is survived by her husband of 72 years, Richard “Dick” Hamlin LaBelle; five children, all of Jamaica Point, Rome, Susan LaBelle, Cynthia and husband Gary Wilkie, Sandra LaBelle, Sara LaBelle, and Alan and wife Lynn (Buzzell) LaBelle; eight grandchildren, Joshua Desrosiers and wife Kahlie, Dr. Jessica Desrosiers and husband Ramel Dennis, Andrew Wilkie and wife Molly, Chapin LaBelle and wife Rebekah, Paige Collier, Alyssa and husband Ryan Bell, Richard LaBelle, and Chena and husband Jacob Bean; great-grandchildren, Jessica Dennis, Elsie Bell, Ander Bell, River Wilkie, Aiden Desrosiers, Nevaeh Dennis, Peri Wilkie, Emilyn Desrosiers, Adaline Bean, Quinn LaBelle, and Warren Bean.\n\nLois was predeceased by her parents; her great-grandson, Isaiah Hamlin Dennis; and her brother, Alton “Bud” Mosher and his wife, Alice.\n\nVisiting hours will be held on Friday, Aug. 18, 3 to 6 p.m., at Wheeler Funeral Home, 26 Church St., in Oakland.
