In between El Dorado and Bugs, so possibly a bit down in the dumps and hunched. 5'9\" absolute tops.\n\nScott said on 17/Aug/07\n\nIncorrect. He lives in the same area as me in London and I see him very regularly in Sainsburys (I guess he's between jobs!) ... he's 5'9 exactly.\n\nlappers84 said on 21/Apr/06\n\nna i'm pretty sure he's about 5'9 or 5'10 no way is he 5'11, i was a big bugs fan he seemed about that height\n\nPaul said on 5/Apr/06\n\nWas in 'Eldorado', the Spanish Los Barcos style soap (1992-1993) that everyone used to either love or hate. Looked about 5'11-6'0."
