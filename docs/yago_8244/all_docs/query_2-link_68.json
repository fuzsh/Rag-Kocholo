        "text": "Only Fools and Horses is one of the UK's much-loved comedies - but where are some of the big stars now?\n\nThe beloved BBC series focused on dodgy market trader Derek “Del Boy” Trotter and his family.\n\nThe show gloriously ran from 1981 to 1991 and continued with successful Christmas specials until 2003.\n\nThe hit programme gave some of the most iconic scenes ever shown on British TV and is still a fan fave to this day.\n\nOnly Fools and Horses became such a household name that it even had pubs named after it, in this country and abroad.\n\nDaily Star has taken a look at what happened to the show's biggest stars, from their careers in pantomimes to a huge tragedy.\n\nJohn Challis\n\nThe actor, best known for playing Terrance Aubrey \"Boycie\" Boyce in the beloved sitcom and his roles in The Green Green Grass and Benidorm, died \"peacefully\" in his sleep in September 2021, after a long battle with cancer.\n\nA statement from John's family read: \"A statement issued by his family published on Sunday afternoon read: \"It is with heavy hearts that we bring you such sad news. Our dear friend and yours, John Challis, has died peacefully in his sleep, after a long battle with cancer.\n\n\"He will always be loved for being 'Boycie' and leaves a great legacy of work that will continue to bring pleasure and smiles for many years to come.\n\nThe message ended: \"As Boycie would have said... 'you know it makes sense'.\"\n\nTributes quickly came pouring in from his co-stars, including Sue Holderness and Sir David Jason, as well as rapper and actor Ice-T, who he had struck up an unusual friendship with.\n\nChallis had no children, but married four times, and was married to wife Carol Davies from 1995 to his death 26 years later.\n\nSir David Jason\n\nThe cushty role made a star out of Jason and he has gone on to become one of Britain’s best-loved actors.\n\nSince then he’s probably best known as Detective Inspector Jack Frost in police drama A Touch Of Frost, which aired from 1992 to 2010.\n\nPre-Only Fools, he played Granville in Open All hours with Ronnie Barker – he reprised this in a 2013 sequel Still Open All hours which is still running today.\n\nJason, now 83, lived with his long-term girlfriend, Welsh actress Myfanwy Talog, for 18 years and nursed her through breast cancer until she died in 1995.\n\nIn 2001, the award-winning actor became a dad for the first time aged 61 when his wife Gill Hinchcliffe gave birth to their daughter Sophie Mae.\n\nThough this week, David found out he had another \"secret\" daughter called Abi aged 52.
