        "text": "Recent ethnographical studies have pointed out that in Latin American countries consumers frequently subvert the consumption-driven design of shopping malls in numerous and unexpected ways.1 Engaging in activities such as dating, studying, kissing, picnicking, fighting, protesting, etcetera, they carve out different meanings for shopping malls and charge retail developers as well as architects with the task of responding to the mall’s expanded role. To tackle this challenge, retail developers have commonly tried to blend the imported consumer logics with traditional places within the city, such as parks, traditional squares, train stations, universities, hospitals, libraries, museums, and traditional markets. This blending occurs in two ways: either literally, when shopping malls merge with, for instance, parks and train stations, or in a metaphorical way, when shopping malls adopt formal references to traditional commerce in downtown. This cultural translation process has changed the way that shopping malls are perceived and built in Latin American cities, and has given rise to an urban retail typology that differs from what is commonly understood as a shopping mall in other latitudes, especially in its place of birth: the North American suburb. Current discussions raise the idea that the ‘retailization’ of urban landscapes is the result of a cultural battle between local culture and global interest, in which shopping malls become instruments for the spreading of a broader system whose logic is the reproduction of global capital. In that sense, the assimilation of shopping malls embodies the cultural hegemony that the global economic model set up in Latin American countries. But nevertheless, local culture persists through a not so evident hybridization of practices related to consumption and socialization in retail spaces, as well as in the typology of the shopping centre itself, as the Chilean case in this chapter exemplifies. This chapter chronicles the arrival of the first enclosed shopping centre in a Latin American city – Paseo Las Mercedes in Caracas, Venezuela in 1956 – and the subsequent dispersion of this retail phenomenon across South America, highlighting the important role that Nelson Rockefeller played in its proliferation across the continent. Tracing the shopping malls’ steps, the chapter unpacks how in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Peru and Chile this imported typology was acculturated and transformed into a novel retail format. Rather than offering a detailed historical account that documents which shopping mall came first in each of these countries, the chapter traces the relationships that existed between the ideologies underpinning the retail project in different Latin American countries, and also uncovers connections between the implementation strategies that were employed on the continent. Special attention is given to the Chilean case because of the leading role that its retail model assumed in the region in the past decade, which is today replicated in Peru and Colombia. Documenting the introduction and development of shopping centres in Latin America, this chapter also makes a case for reviewing the history of commercial infrastructures in a global perspective in order to understand how the shopping mall – a prototype imported from the US – became a natural part of the daily routines in Latin America. By investigating the relation between the evolution of retail spaces in different countries, the chapter aims to trace the paths of hybridization of the original US malls to domestic models, and to point to relations between different cases and the interaction between the Latin American retail investors, making a case for the development of an assimilation process of foreign retail into a ‘Latino mall’ typology."
