        "text": "The StoryTeller: Greek Myths Air Date December 22, 1990 Written by Nigel Williams Director Tony Smith\n\nThe Storyteller tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. One day, Orpheus plays his music in the forest and wakes Eurydice, a wood nymph, and they fall in love and marry. After a short while, Eurydice is struck dead by the bite of a snake. Orpheus, determined to get her back, goes down into the Underworld to convince Hades to give her back. However, there is a catch: Orpheus must leave the Underworld and not look back. If he can reach the sunlit world, trusting that Eurydice is behind him, she is his, but if he looks back, she returns to the underworld forever.\n\nCredits[]\n\nMichael Gambon as The Storyteller\n\nBrian Henson as Dog\n\nArt Malik as Orpheus\n\nGina Bellman as Eurydice\n\nJesse Birdsall as Aristaeus\n\nMel Martin as Persephone\n\nRobert Stephens as Hades\n\nTrevor Peacock as Charon\n\nDavid Greenaway: Puppeteer\n\nAngela Taylor: Dancer\n\nMichael Small: Dancer\n\nRossana Sen: Dancer\n\nMartin Rekab: Dancer\n\nMarko Nunes: Dancer\n\nIkky Maas: Dancer\n\nAnita Griffin: Dancer\n\nBetsy Gregory: Dancer\n\nSue Glasser: Dancer\n\nNelson Fernandez: Dancer\n\nLucy Fawcett: Dancer\n\nMark Ashman: Dancer\n\nProduced by Jim Henson & Duncan Kenworthy\n\nMusic by Rachel Portman\n\n[]\n\nTV.com article\n\nIMDb"
