He debuted on 8th August 2013 and became the show's main antagonist from then onwards and throughout 2014 before serving as an overarching antagonist for the rest of the year.\n\nHe was portrayed by Jesse Birdsall.\n\nBiography[]\n\nFraser Black was born on 13th January 1963. Over the next few decades, he grew up into a dangerous gangland figure with a notorious reputation for trafficking and murder. He established many associates such as Ray McCormick and Glenn Donovan, as well as ex-gang member Sydney Royle before the latter was eventually killed by Fraser for becoming a liability.\n\nIt was then following Sydney's murder that Fraser had groomed his son Trevor Royle in becoming his henchman, often getting Trevor to perpetuate kidnap and murder on his behalf. This mainly resulted in Trevor becoming an infamous gangster himself.\n\nDuring the course of his gangland reign, Fraser married a woman named Tracey Donovan and she gave birth to their two daughters - Grace Black and Claire Devine respectively. They soon divorced years later, but then in the following decades Fraser seduced his girlfriend Sandy Roscoe into marrying him. However, it soon turned out that Fraser had previously slept with Tegan Lomax and she gave birth to their daughter Dee Dee Hutchinson not long afterwards. Moreover, Fraser joined Tegan in adopting a girl named Rose at that point as well.\n\nBy 2014, Fraser appeared to have edluded justice for many of his crimes due to his influence in the criminal underworld; he later admitted to having \"Friends in High Places\" in the police department and court room as well. Soon enough he gained numerous enemies before aliening most of his own family and friends due to his volatile streak. Then one night in April 2014, Fraser is murdered by an unknown assailant and he is found dead by the next day. His death remained a mystery for months up until it was revealed on July 2014 that his killer was Freddie Roscoe, his stepson and also Sandy's son who had shot Fraser dead to stop him from harming his family.\n\nNavigation[]\n\nSoap Opera Villains EastEnders\n\nAaron | Abi | Abs | Adam | Ahmet | Alanagh | Alan | Alex | Alfie | Al | Ali | Johnny Allen | Ruby Allen | Allen's unnamed henchmen | DCI
