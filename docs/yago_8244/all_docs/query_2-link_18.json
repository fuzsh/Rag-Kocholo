        "text": "Jensen Ross Ackles, better known as simply Jensen Ackles, was born on March 1, 1978, in Dallas, Texas, to Donna Joan (Shaffer) and actor Alan Ackles. He has English, German, and Scottish ancestry. Jensen grew up in Richardson, Texas, together with his older brother, Joshua, and a younger sister, Mackenzie. Jensen graduated from Dartmouth Elementary School in 1990, he graduated from Apollo Junior High School in 1993, and LV Berkner High School in 1996.\n\nJensen is a sports junkie. He loves football, lacrosse, baseball and basketball. He even played on the baseball and lacrosse teams in high school. The 6' 1\" actor first started modeling when he was just 2 years old. When he turned 4, he started appearing in TV commercials for Nabisco, RadioShack and Wal-Mart. He caught the acting bug because he was mostly influenced by his father, who was an actor in Dallas. He used to watch his father study scripts, and that taught him a few things about the industry. During his later years in high school, he started taking theater classes, where he claimed he was the only \"jock\" in that department. When he was just a sophomore, a friend of Jensen had asked him to attend a local acting seminar. Two guys, Craig Wargo, and an agent, 'Michael Einfeld', were interested in Jensen's talent and wanted him to go to Los Angeles with them.\n\nJensen had to say no to the offer and admitted at one point, he thought they would forget about him but, eventually, when he went to Los Angeles, he still managed to get help from them. Prior to that, Jensen actually planned to study sports medicine at Texas Tech University and become a physical therapist, before he decided to move to Los Angeles to give acting a try. In 1996, he managed to secure guest roles on several TV shows, which included Wishbone (1995), Mr. Rhodes (1996) and Sweet Valley High (1994). Jensen's big break came when he was cast in the NBC soap opera, Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965), as Eric Brady in 1997. He won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer in 1998, and was nominated three times in 1998, 1999, and 2000 for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his work on Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965). After spending about three years on a soap set, he left Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965) and went on to appear in the mini-series Blond (2001), which was about the life of Marilyn Monroe, playing Eddie G. He also auditioned for the role of Clark Kent on Smallville (2001), but lost the part to Tom Welling, instead.\n\nNot giving up hope, he went for a few auditions and managed to secure a guest role on the popular James Cameron TV series, Dark Angel (2000), as serial killer Ben/X5-493, the brother of main character Max/X5-452, who was played by Jessica Alba. His character died in the episode, but Jensen eventually returned to the show as a regular in the second season as Ben's clone, Alec/X5-494 and continued on until the show's cancellation in 2002. In 2003, he joined the cast of Dawsons Creek (1998), playing the role of C.J., Jen Lindley's lover. He also filmed episodes of the TV series, Still Life (2003), playing the role of Max Morgan, not knowing that the series was actually dropped. He also had a small role in the short film, The Plight of Clownana (2004), playing the role of Jensen. That same year, he was offered the part of Eliza Dushku's love interest on the second season of Tru Calling: Schicksal reloaded! (2003). Jensen, however, turned down the role which was later offered to another actor, Eric Christian Olsen. He was subsequently cast on Smallville (2001), as Assistant football coach Jason Teague, the new love interest of Lana Lang. In 2005, Jensen managed to earn a lead role in the movie, Devour - Der schwarze Pfad (2005), playing the role of Jake Gray. Jensen also earned the opportunity to work his father, actor Alan Ackles, who happened to play his character's father, Paul Kilton. The movie, however, received mixed reviews from the public.\n\nThat same year, Jensen joined the cast of the CW series, Supernatural: Zur Hölle mit dem Bösen (2005), where he plays the role of Dean Winchester. Dean and his brother Sam, who is played by Jared Padalecki, are brothers who drive throughout the United States hunting paranormal predators, sometimes with their father, John Winchester, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It was reported that the creator of the show, Eric Kripke, mentioned that the show will last for a maximum of five seasons. In 2006, Jensen took on a role in the Independently filmed comedy/drama movie, Ten Inch Hero (2007), which explores the theme of honesty and the flaw of judging by appearances. In 2007 the film began a limited run at number of film festivals including the Newport Beach Film Festival, Phoenix Film Festival and the Santa Cruz Film Festival but never made it into major mainstream theatrical release. In the Spring of 2008 Ten Inch Hero was released onto DVD exclusively through Blockbuster. Jensen however, received high praise for his work as Priestly, who one of the movie's more quirky characters.\n\nFrom June 5-10 in 2007 Jensen had his professional stage debut as Lt. Daniel Kaffee in \"A Few Good Men\" at Casa Manana Theatre in Fort Worth, Texas, working along side Lou Diamond Phillips. This proved to be another successful acting venture for Jensen, as critics were impressed with his work in this role. During his free time, Jensen enjoys golfing, horseback riding, scuba diving and photography. He is also a big fan of country music. His favorite musician is Garth Brooks. He even sang back-up vocals on good friend Steve Carlson's albums \"Spot in the Corner\" and \"Rollin' On.\" In the summer of 2008 Jensen traveled to Kittaning, PA to film the horror/thriller movie, My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), which was filmed in the cutting edge Real D technology, Jensen played the lead role of Tom Hanniger and starred alongside Jaime King and Kerr Smith.\n\nJensen splits his time between Vancouver, British Columbia where he films Supernatural (2005) and his home in Austin, Texas.\n\nAmanda Laura Bynes was born on April 3, 1986, in Thousand Oaks, California, the youngest of three children of Lynn (Organ), a dental assistant, and Richard Bynes, a dentist. Her father is of Lithuanian, Irish, and Polish descent, and her mother is from an Ashkenazi Jewish family from Toronto. Amanda became interested in acting and performing from the age of three, when she would say her older sister Jillian's lines with her while she performed in plays. It was from then on that her family and friends knew that she would be a star someday.\n\nHer acting debut was in 1996, when she auditioned for and got the role as a newcomer on All That (1994). Right away, she became very popular as people enjoyed her acting in skits, especially Ask Ashley, where she played a little girl running an advice column who would get very angry every time she read a letter.\n\nIn 1999, 13-year-old Amanda was given her own variety show, The Amanda Show (1999), in which she starred in all of the skits except Totally Kyle. In 2001, she co-starred with Frankie Muniz in Lügen haben kurze beine (2002) as Kaylee, Jason's friend who helps him prove that he really did write the essay \"Big Fat Liar\" and regain his father's trust. It was also in 2001 that she began dating Taran Killam from The Amanda Show (1999) and Lügen haben kurze beine (2002), who is four years and two days older than she is. She also won a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award and, at age 15, The Amanda Show (1999) ended its run.\n\nIn 2002, she began co-starring with Jennie Garth in Hallo Holly (2002) as Holly, a 16-year-old girl who moves in with her sister after their father decides to move to Japan. She also celebrated her Sweet 16th birthday and got her driver's license on April 3, 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Amanda won two KCA Awards and starred as Daphne, a girl searching for her father, in Was Mädchen wollen (2003) with Colin Firth and Kelly Preston as her parents. She continued acting in Hallo Holly (2002) and broke up with Taran.\n\nA prodigiously talented comedienne, on April 3, 2004, Amanda celebrated her 18th birthday on the 17th Annual KCA Awards, where she won an award for best actress for her role in Was Mädchen wollen (2003). She graduated from Thousand Oaks High School's independent study program on June 10, 2004, and filmed Lovewrecked - Liebe über Bord (2005) in 2004.\n\nJennifer Connelly was born in the Catskill Mountains, New York, to Ilene (Schuman), a dealer of antiques, and Gerard Connelly, a clothing manufacturer. Her father had Irish and Norwegian ancestry, and her mother was from a Jewish immigrant family. Jennifer grew up in Brooklyn Heights, just across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, except for the four years her parents spent in Woodstock, New York. Back in Brooklyn Heights, she attended St. Ann's school. A close friend of the family was an advertising executive. When Jennifer was ten, he suggested that her parents take her to a modeling audition. She began appearing in newspaper and magazine ads (among them \"Seventeen\" magazine), and soon moved on to television commercials. A casting director saw her and introduced her to Sergio Leone, who was seeking a young girl to dance in his gangster epic Es war einmal in Amerika (1984). Although having little screen time, the few minutes she was on-screen were enough to reveal her talent. Her next role after that was an episode of the British horror anthology TV series Die unglaublichen Geschichten von Roald Dahl (1979) in 1984.\n\nAfter Leone's movie, horror master Dario Argento signed her to play her first starring role in his thriller Phenomena (1985). The film made a lot of money in Europe but, unfortunately, was heavily cut for American distribution. Around the same time, she appeared in the rock video \"I Drove All Night,\" a Roy Orbison song, co-starring Jason Priestley. She released a single called \"Monologue of Love\" in Japan in the mid-1980s, in which she sings in Japanese a charming little song with semi-classical instruments arrangement. On the B-side is \"Message Of Love,\" which is an interview with music in background. She also appeared in television commercials in Japan.\n\nShe enrolled at Yale, and then transferred two years later to Stanford. She trained in classical theater and improvisation, studying with the late drama coach Roy London, Howard Fine, and Harold Guskin.\n\nThe late 1980s saw her starring in a hit and three lesser seen films. Amongst the latter was her roles in Ballet (1989), as a ballerina and in Some Girls (1988), where she played a self-absorbed college freshman. The hit was Die Reise ins Labyrinth (1986), released in 1986. Jennifer got the job after a nationwide talent search for the lead in this fantasy directed by Jim Henson and produced by George Lucas. Her career entered in a calm phase after those films, until Dennis Hopper, who was impressed after having seen her in \"Some Girls\", cast Jennifer as an ingénue small-town girl in The Hot Spot - Spiel mit dem Feuer (1990), based upon the 1950s crime novel \"Hell Hath No Fury\". It received mixed critical reviews, but it was not a box office success.\n\nRocketeer (1991), an ambitious Touchstone super-production, came to the rescue. The film was an old-fashioned adventure flick about a man capable of flying with rockets on his back. Critics saw in \"Rocketeer\" a top-quality movie, a homage to those old films of the 1930s in which the likes of Errol Flynn starred. After \"Rocketeer,\" Jennifer made Kevins Cousin allein im Supermarkt (1991), Im Herzen der Rache (1992), Nach eigenen Regeln (1996), her first collaboration with Nick Nolte and Die Abbotts - Wenn Haß die Liebe tötet (1997). In 1998, she was invited by director Alex Proyas to make Dark City (1998), a strange, visually stunning science-fiction extravaganza. In this movie, Jennifer played the main character's wife, and she delivered an acclaimed performance. The film itself didn't break any box-office record but received positive reviews. This led Jennifer to a contract with Fox for the television series The $treet - Wer bietet mehr? (2000), a main part in the memorable and dramatic love-story Im Auftrag der Toten (2000) and, more important, a breakthrough part in the polemic and applauded independent Requiem for a Dream (2000), a tale about the haunting lives of drug addicts and the subsequent process of decadence and destruction. In \"Requiem for a Dream,\" Jennifer had her career's most courageous, difficult part, a performance that earned her a Spirit Award Nomination. She followed this role with Pollock (2000), in which she played Pollock's mistress, Ruth Klingman. In 2001, Ron Howard chose her to co-star with Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind: Genie und Wahnsinn (2001), the film that tells the true story of John Nash, a man who suffered from mental illness but eventually beats this and wins the Nobel Prize in 1994. Jennifer played Nash's wife and won a Golden Globe, BAFTA, AFI and Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Connelly continued her career with films including Hulk (2003), her second collaboration with Nick Nolte, Dark Water - Dunkle Wasser (2005), Blood Diamond (2006), Der Tag, an dem die Erde stillstand (2008), Er steht einfach nicht auf Dich (2009) and Noah (2014), where she did her second collaboration with both Darren Aronofsky and Russell Crowe and made her third collaboration with Nick Nolte in that same film.\n\nJennifer lives in New York. She is 5'7\", and speaks fluent Italian and French. She enjoys physical activities such as swimming, gymnastics, and bike riding. She is also an outdoors person -- camping, hiking and walking, and is interested in quantum physics and philosophy. She likes horses, Pearl Jam, SoundGarden, Jesus Jones, and occasionally wears a small picture of the The Dalai Lama on a necklace. Her favorite colors are cobalt blue, forest green, and \"very pale green/gray -- sort of like the color of the sea\". She likes to draw.\n\nTall, slim and exceedingly good-looking American leading man Robert Culp, a former cartoonist in his teen years, appeared off-Broadway in the 1950s before settling into polished, clean-cut film leads and \"other man\" supports a decade later. Hitting the popular TV boards in the hip, racially ground-breaking espionage program Tennisschläger und Kanonen (1965), he made a slick (but never smarmy), sardonic name for himself during his over five-decade career with his sly humor, casual banter and tongue-in-cheek sexiness. Though he had the requisite looks and smooth, manly appeal (not to mention acting talent) for superstardom, a cool but cynical and somewhat detached persona may have prevented him from attaining it full-out.\n\nHe was born Robert Martin Culp on August 16, 1930, in Oakland California. The son of attorney Crozie Culp and his wife, Bethel Collins, who was employed at a Berkeley chemical company, he offset his only-child loneliness by playacting in local theater productions. Culp also showed a talent for art while young and earned money as a cartoonist for Bay Area magazines and newspapers in high school, but the fascination with becoming an actor proved much stronger. He attended Berkeley High School and graduated in 1947. The athletically-inclined Culp dominated at track and field events and, as a result, earned athletic scholarships to six different universities. He selected the relatively minor College of the Pacific in Stockton, California primarily because of its active theater department. Transferring to various other colleges of higher learning (including San Francisco State in 1949), he never earned a degree. After performing in some theatre in the San Francisco area, he moved to Seattle and then New York in 1951.\n\nStudying under famed teacher Herbert Berghof and supporting himself during this time teaching speech and phonetics, Bob eventually found work on the theatre scene, making his 1953 Broadway debut (as Robert M. Culp) in \"The Prescott Proposals\" with Katharine Cornell. He eventually returned to Broadway with \"Diary of a Scoundrel\" starring Blanche Yurka and Roddy McDowall in 1956 and with a strong role in \"A Clearing in the Woods\" (alongside Kim Stanley) a year later. He earned an off-Broadway Obie Award for his very fine work in \"He Who Gets Slapped\" in 1956, and also appeared in the plays \"Daily Life\" and \"Easter\".\n\nGracing a few live-TV dramas during his New York days, he returned to his native California for his first major TV role. It was an auspicious one as post-Civil War Texas Ranger \"Hoby Gilman\" in the western series Trackdown (1957). He earned widespread attention in the series that based many of its stories from actual Texas Ranger files, and the show itself received the official approval not only of the Rangers themselves but by the State of Texas. The series led to a CBS spin-off of its own: Der Kopfgeldjäger (1958), which made a TV star out of Steve McQueen.\n\nFrom there, Culp guested on a number of series dramas: Bonanza (1959), Westlich von Santa Fe (1958), Tausend Meilen Staub (1959), Kein Fall für FBI (1959), Ben Casey (1961), The Outer Limits (1963), Gnadenlose Stadt (1958) and Combat! (1962). He also starred in the two-part Disney family-styled program \"Sammy the Way Out Seal\" (1962), which was subsequently released as a feature in Europe. He and Patricia Barry played the hapless parents of precocious Bill Mumy and Michael McGreevey whose \"adopted\" pet animal unleashes major chaos in their suburban neighborhood.\n\nDuring this time, Bob began to seek lead and supporting work in films. Despite his co-starring with Cliff Robertson, Rod Taylor and the very perky Jane Fonda (as her straight-laced boyfriend) in the sparkling Broadway-based sexcapade Sonntag in New York (1963); playing Robertson's naval mate in the popular John F. Kennedy biopic Patrouillenboot PT 109 (1963); recreating the legendary \"Wild Bill\" Hickok in the western tale Die rauhen Reiter von Texas (1963); and heading up the adventurous cast of the Ivan Tors' African yarn Safari zur Hölle (1964) (which included Harry Guardino and the very fetching British import Shirley Eaton), Culp wasn't able to make a serious dent in the medium.\n\nTV remained his best arena and gave him more lucrative offers, professionally. It rewarded him quite richly in 1965 with the debonair series lead \"Kelly Robinson\", a jet-setting, pro-circuit tennis player who leads a double life as an international secret agent in Tennisschläger und Kanonen (1965). Running three seasons, Culp co-starred with fellow secret agent Bill Cosby, who, as \"Alexander Scott\", posed as Culp's tennis trainer. The role was tailor-made for the suave, Ivy-League-looking actor. He looked effortlessly cool posing in sunglasses amid the posh continental settings and remained handsomely unflinching in the face of danger. It was the first U.S. prime-time network drama to feature an African-American actor in a full-out starring role and the relationship between the two meshed perfectly and charismatically on screen. Both were nominated for acting Emmys in all three of its seasons, with Cosby coming out the victor each time. Filmed on location in such cities as Hong Kong, Acapulco and Tokyo, Culp also wrote and directed certain episodes of the show He also met his third wife, the gorgeous Eurasian actress France Nuyen, while on the set. They married in 1967 but divorced three years later. At this stage, the actor already had four children (by second wife, sometime actress Nancy Ashe).\n\nFollowing the series' demise, Culp took on perhaps his most-famous and controversial film role as Natalie Wood's husband \"Bob\" in the titillating but ultimately teasing \"flower power\" era film Bob & Caroline & Ted & Alice (1969), with Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon as the other-half couple who examine the late 60s \"free love\" idea of wife-swapping. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards (two went to supporting actors Gould and Cannon). The movie did not reignite Culp's popularity on the large screen, but it did lead to his rather strange pairing with buxom Raquel Welch in the violent-edged western In einem Sattel mit dem Tod (1971) and a reunion with his Tennisschläger und Kanonen (1965) pal Cosby in the far-more entertaining Magnum Heat (1972), which reestablished their great tongue-in-cheek rapport as two weary-eyed private eyes. Culp also directed the film while his real-life wife, actress Sheila Sullivan, played his screen wife as well.\n\nThe late 1970s produced a flood of routine mini-movies and B-pictures, the latter including Inside Out - Ein genialer Bluff (1975), Auf der Fährte des Adlers (1976), Ein Orkan von Blei (1976), Der Supermann des Wilden Westens (1976), Die Flut bricht los (1976), Der Agent (1979) and Hot Rod (1979). While he remained a sturdy and standard presence in such mini-movies as Houston, bitte kommen... (1974), Spectre (1977) and Der Model-Killer (1984), his better TV-movie roles were in Der eiskalte Tod (1973), Outrage (1973), A Cry for Help (1975) and as \"Lyle Pettyjohn\" in the acclaimed mini-series sequel Roots - Die nächsten Generationen (1979).\n\nBob returned to series TV as stern FBI Special Agent \"Bill Maxwell\", whose job was to work with handsome William Katt, who starred as an ersatz The Greatest American Hero (1981). The show lasted three seasons. Other series guest spots, both comedic and dramatic, included Hotel (1983), Ein Engel auf Erden (1984), Golden Girls (1985) and an episode of his old buddy's show Die Bill Cosby Show (1984). He was also a guest murderer in three of the \"Columbo\" episodes. Although he was relegated to appearing in such film fodder as Das Schlitzohr (1985), Big Bad Mama 2 (1987) and Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog (1989), the 1990s offered him one of his best film roles in years as the ill-fated President in the Denzel Washington/Julia Roberts political thriller Die Akte (1993). A year later, he again reteamed with Cosby in the TV-movie Bill Cosby & Co. - Die Rückkehr der Superspione (1994).\n\nCulp became very active in the 1960s Civil Rights movement and later became a prominent face in local civic causes, joining in a lawsuit to cease construction of an elephant exhibit at the Los Angeles Zoo and accusing officials there of mistreatment. In the long run, however, the construction was given the green light. Culp also married a fifth time to Candace Faulkner and, by her, had daughter Samantha Culp in 1982. Older sons Jason Culp (born 1961) and Joseph Culp (born 1963) became actors, while another son, Joshua Culp (born 1958), entered the visual effects field. Daughter Rachel, an outré clothing designer for rock stars, was born in 1964.\n\nIn later years, Culp could be seen occasionally as Ray Romano's father-in-law on the hugely popular Alle lieben Raymond (1996). His last film, the family drama The Assignment (2010), was unreleased at the time of his death. On March 24, 2010, the 79-year-old Culp collapsed from an apparent heart attack while walking near the lower entrance to Runyon Canyon Park, a popular hiking area in the Hollywood Hills. Found by a hiker, Culp was transported to a nearby hospital where he died from the head injuries he sustained in the fall. Five grandchildren also survive.\n\nBorn and raised on the south side of Chicago, comedian-turned-actor DeRay Davis can most recently be \"scene\" starring opposite Taraji P. Henson's \"Cookie Lyons\" as her go-to hitman/cousin \"Jermel\" in seasons 1 and 2 of the Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, creative collaboration, Empire on the FOX network. After his wildly successful 1 hour Showtime Comedy Special, DeRay Davis: Power Play that aired to rave reviews, Davis continues to ascend on what can only be described as the Samuel E. Jackson Formula; a path and pattern of consistent, feature film and network television roles! After his first, single card credit, as \"Spooner\" in John Carpenter's remake of The Fog (2005), it has been eleven years (and counting) of back to back, prominently featured/starring roles in both film (32+) and television (50+) staring opposite Hollywood heavy hitters. License to Wed opposite John Krasinski, Semi-Pro opposite Will Ferrell, Imagine That opposite Eddie Murphy, Life As We Know It opposite Katherine Heigl, Old Dogs opposite Robin Williams & John Travolta, 21 Jump Street (2012) opposite Channing Tatum & Johnny Depp, G.I. Joe: Retaliation opposite Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson - just to name a few. Between takes, on the afore mentioned nationally released feature films, Davis continued to star and sometimes contribute as producer/writer in a steady stream of network television movies, mini-series, variety shows and sitcoms. One of DeRay's first credited writer/ Voice Over roles was on Kanye West earlier Albums (and you thought that was Bernie Mac, didn't you?) Davis contributed 5+ Voice Over Character roles on Multi Seasons of The Boondocks , Adult Swim's Black Dynamite and continued sharpening his comedic craft by starring on almost every season of Nick Cannon's Wild n Out from its conception to current airing on MTV as well as Hip-Hop Squares, Short Circuitz and Hosting the game show Mind of a Man on GSN. This led to his currently starring as Host on MTV2's Joking Off currently in its second season (release date TBA)! Davis transformed his torridly rough upbringing, status as a working actor and fatherhood into a live show that stays fresh and ever changing according to whatever is happening in his daily life while he continues to develop and hone his streetwise mentality smoothly and efficiently onto the comedy-club circuit. He achieved his career breakthrough at the Laffapalooza Festival in Atlanta, GA, and then scored a 3-peat by winning the Comedy Central Laugh Riots Competition and landing covetable spots in the Montreal Just for Laughs Festival as well as the Budweiser Def Comedy Jam Competition. From the Hood to Hollywood - nothing is off limits and no one is safe from DeRay's hilarious, sidesplitting anecdotes. He continues to sell out venues both domestically and internationally. His highly anticipated 1st ever Netflix special \"DeRay Davis: How to Act Black\" smashed the cultural landscape on November 14, 2017 and was so popular it shut down the Netflix server TWICE! Davis is continuing to ascend.\n\nFrom the time he was a young lad, Gary Dourdan knew that he wanted to be an actor. Despite a myriad of interests, which included music, athletics and even break dancing, Dourdan focused much of his passion centered on acting. His determination, of course, eventually paid off - after an increasing series of television guest spots that led to regular series roles, he came to prominence in the \"Alien\" film franchise in 1997, officially starting him on the path towards stardom. While the one-time New Jersey native worked steadily, it was his role as forensic investigator Warrick Brown on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (CBS, 2000-15) that put him on the map, introducing Dourdan to a large audience week after week and establishing him as a top-notch television star.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Dourdan was raised by his creative-minded mother, a fashion designer, and father, an agent who represented jazz musicians. Dourdan was the youngest child in a family of five; a mixture of various ethnicity's including, among others, African, European and Native American . As a child, he excelled in music, playing a variety of instruments including piano, guitar and saxophone. Dourdan studied with legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg, and by the end of the 1980s, began performing in off-Broadway plays. After meeting \"A Different World\" (1987-1993) producer Debbie Allen in Paris, Dourdan was cast in the role of Shazza Zulu, a recurring gig he played for over two seasons. Dourdan was then plucked by pop star Janet Jackson to be the object of desire in the 1993 video for her single \"Again.\"\n\nIn 1996, Dourdan landed the role of Yates in the Touchstone Pictures-based action drama \"Playing God\" (1997), then was part of a six-month shoot in Los Angeles for \"Alien: Resurrection\" (1997) and the independent drama \"Thursday\" (1998). Dourdan later decided to return to television. In 2000, he appeared in the ABC movie \"Muhammad Ali: King of the World,\" taking on the formidable role of the iconic Malcolm X. Back in features, Dourdan headlined the independent drama thriller \"Trois\" (2000), then appeared in Reggie Bythewood's Hollywood drama \"Dancing in September\" (2000). By April 2000, Dourdan had been recruited for the crime procedural, \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\" Picked up for the fall season, the series revolved around a forensics investigating unit in Las Vegas, with Dourdan playing Warrick Brown, a smart, complex and moody investigator with a shaky past as a gambler. The show quickly took off with critics and viewers, later paving the way for two successful \"CSI\" spin-offs.\n\nAs part of a dramatic ensemble, Dourdan and his cast mates were acknowledged with Screen Actors Guild Award nominations in successive ceremonies between 2002 and 2005, with the team finally taking home the statue in 2005. Dourdan himself was singled out by NAACP's Image Awards for nominations five years running, between 2002-07. In 2003 and 2006, he won his category as \"Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.\" He next essayed another real-life political figure, Black Panther George Jackson, in \"Black August\" (2003). With little time for outside screen work beyond his day job, he made an appearance as Captain Burke in the oft-re shot sci-fi thriller \"Imposter\" (2002). In 2006, Dourdan co-starred opposite Halle Berry as her on-again, off-again boyfriend in the thriller \"Perfect Stranger\" (2007).\n\nRecently, Dourdan has been seen on the ABC series \"Mistresses\" BET's \"Being Mary Jane\" and Starz \"Power\" and the soon to be released \"Redemption Day \" Gary has kept busy with recording and performing live music."
