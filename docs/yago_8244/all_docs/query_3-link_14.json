        "text": "Who Are Those Guys? - Jesse Birdsall\n\nJesse Birdsall was born in Highbury, London, Englad on February 13, 1963. The son of Penguin Books designer Derek Birdsall, Birdsall attended Hampstead School in North London. He is the brother of actor Simon Birdsall.\n\nAs a child, he attended the Anna Scher children's theatre school in Islington, and in his teens appeared in Nanette Newman's children's cooking program, ‘Fun Food Factory’ and on several television plays and series, usually with his trademark rockabilly look. Birdsall was also an extra with one line, (\"Watch it mate!\"), in an episode of ‘Minder’ in 1980 entitled \"Don't Tell Them Willie Boy was Here\". He first came to wider public attention in the serial ‘Annika’ in 1984, his first notable television role. He then subsequently appeared in the films “Wish You Were Here” (1987), directed by David Leland and co-starring Emily Lloyd and “Getting It Right”. Another notable television role was his portrayal of slick playboy Marcus Tandy in the infamous BBC1 soap opera ‘Eldorado’, which ran for just one year from 1992–93 and gained a reputation as one of the biggest television flops of all time. Nonetheless, the amount of coverage the program received for its perceived low quality and lack of success would gain Birdsall much exposure, and from 1995 to 1999 he played one of the lead characters in another BBC1 program, the successful futuristic action/adventure series ‘Bugs’.\n\nJesse has appeared in one Euro-western playing the lead role in the 1991 film “The Ballad of Kid Divine”.\n\nJesse appeared in several episodes of the ITV police drama ‘The Bill’ in 2003 as a character named Ron Gregory, a convicted pedophile, and for the same network appeared as a regular in series 3-5 of the popular drama ‘Footballer's Wives’. He had a small role in the BBC One soap opera ‘EastEnders’ in August 2012, playing John Hewland, jilted fiancé of Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), in two episodes. He currently plays the role of Fraser Black in Channel 4 soap ‘Hollyoaks’.\n\nBirdsall has been married to actress Gwyneth Strong since July 15, 2000 and they have two children.\n\nBIRDSALL, Jesse [2/13/1963, Highbury, London, England, U.K. - ] - TV actor, brother of actor Simon Birdsall, married to actress Gwyneth Strong [1959- ] (2000- ), father of Oscar Birdsall [1988- ], Lottie Birdsall [1991- ], son-in-law of producer, director Colin Strong, brother-in-law of assistant director, actress Catrin Strong and production coordinator Elian Strong.\n\nThe Ballad of Kid Divine - 1991 (Kid Divine)"
