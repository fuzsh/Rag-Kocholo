        "text": "01 of 17\n\nMatthew Fox as Jack Shephard\n\nMatthew Fox's role as Dr. Jack Shephard, the group's tortured leader, was his TV comeback after playing Charlie Salinger on Party of Five.\n\nAfter Lost, he appeared in films like 2012's Alex Cross and 2013's World War Z. After some personal setbacks — Fox was charged with a DUI in Oregon in 2012 — he took a break from the spotlight. Fox returned to the small screen on the Peacock series Last Light, which premiered in 2022.\n\nIn an October 2023 interview with the Telegraph, Fox shared how he feels about fans of Lost wondering where he'd been during his break from acting.\n\n\"I am very comfortable with that. If I could continue to work on projects that I love, with great people, and still have that question pop up, it’d be pretty cool,\" he said.\n\nHe and his wife Margherita Ronchi share two children, Kyle and Byron.\n\n02 of 17\n\nEvangeline Lilly as Kate Austen\n\nPlaying the tough, conflicted and fearless Kate Austen became Evangeline Lilly's breakout role.\n\nShe went on to play Tauriel in the Hobbit film series, and then the Avengers came calling; Lilly stars as Hope van Dyne a.k.a. The Wasp in Marvel's Ant-Man franchise.\n\nLilly announced that she would be \"stepping away\" from Hollywood in June 2024 in a post on Instagram.\n\n\"Stepping away from what seems like the obvious choice (wealth and fame) can feel scary at times, but stepping into your dharma replaces the fear with fulfillment,\" she explained in her caption. \"I might return to Hollywood one day, but, for now, this is where I belong.\"\n\nShe and her longtime partner Norman Kali have two children.\n\n03 of 17\n\nJorge Garcia as Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes\n\nJorge Garcia was fan-favorite Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes, whose cursed lottery numbers would become one of Lost's greatest mysteries.\n\nAfter the show wrapped, Garcia appeared on several TV shows, including Alcatraz, How I Met Your Mother and Hawaii Five-0. He also had a cameo in David Spade's Netflix comedy The Wrong Missy as the \"guy on plane\" — appropriate for the Lost alum. In 2022, he appeared on season 7 of The Masked Singer.\n\nGarcia tied the knot to actress Rebecca Birdsall in June 2019 in Ireland, and the couple welcomed a baby girl in 2021.\n\n04 of 17\n\nJosh Holloway as James \"Sawyer\" Ford\n\nAs the rugged, sexy James \"Sawyer\" Ford, Josh Holloway was both an antagonist to Jack and a romantic interest for Kate and, eventually, Juliet.\n\nHolloway went on to star opposite Tom Cruise in 2011's Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and appeared on Paramount Network's Western drama Yellowstone.\n\nHe and his wife, Yessica Kumala, share two children.\n\n05 of 17\n\nYunjin Kim as Sun-Hwa Kwon\n\nYunjin Kim played Sun-Hwa Kwon, one-half of the show's central married couple.\n\nAfter Lost, Kim went on to star opposite Alyssa Milano on Mistresses for four seasons, as well as in several Korean films and TV series. In May 2024, she appeared in two episodes of the final season of Station 19.\n\nShe wed her former manager, Jeong Hyeok Park, in 2010 in Hawaii.\n\n06 of 17\n\nDaniel Dae Kim as Jin-Soo Kwon\n\nSun-Hwa's husband, Jin-Soo Kwon, was played by Daniel Dae Kim.\n\nDaniel Dae remained in Hawaii — where much of Lost was filmed — following the series to star in Hawaii Five-0 for seven seasons from 2010 to 2017. He appeared on New Amsterdam and has also had roles in the Divergent film franchise and 2019's Hellboy and Always Be My Maybe. He and his wife, Mia Haeyoung Rhee, have been married since 1993 and share two children.\n\nThe actor has spoken out about attacks on the AAPI community in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and was named to the White House's AAPI Visibility Task Force. He even opened up about speaking to the creators of Lost about the Asian stereotypes that could've played out on the show.\n\n\"While we were shooting, I remember sitting down with Damon Lindelof and J.J. Abrams and saying, 'Guys, this character cannot progress in this same way,'\" he said. \"They basically said, 'Trust us.' I did, and it turned out for the best.\"\n\nHe continued, \"As an Asian actor, you're just looking to get hired. It's about working within the system to try and change it when you have the opportunity ... The character grew to a place where I don't think you'd call him a stereotype by the end.\"\n\nDaniel Dae has been married to his wife, Kim, since 1993, with whom he shares two children. In May 2024, he celebrated son Jackson's graduation from his alma mater, New York University.\n\n07 of 17\n\nTerry O'Quinn as John Locke\n\nTerry O'Quinn was the mysterious John Locke, named for the famous English philosopher. In 2007, he earned an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor for his role on the show.\n\nFollowing the show, he has steadily worked on TV, appearing in series including 666 Park Avenue, Hawaii Five-0 (alongside Lost costar Daniel Dae), Emergence and FBI: Most Wanted.\n\nHe and his ex-wife Lori share two sons.\n\n08 of 17\n\nNaveen Andrews as Sayid Jarrah\n\nNaveen Andrews (and his biceps) starred as former Iraqi soldier Sayid Jarrah.\n\nWhen Lost wrapped, he continued to star on several series, notably Sense8, Instinct, The Dropout and The Cleaning Lady.\n\nHe has two children from previous relationships.\n\n09 of 17\n\nDominic Monaghan as Charlie Pace\n\nAfter starring in the Lord of the Rings franchise, Dominic Monaghan took on the role of rocker Charlie Pace on Lost.\n\nHe then went on to appear in several other films and series, including another time-jumping show, Flashforward, and the crime drama 100 Code. Monaghan also hosted his own BBC nature series, Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan. In 2019, he again joined forces (get it?) with Lost co-creator Abrams to play Beaumont Kin in 2019's Star Wars: Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.\n\n10 of 17\n\nEmilie de Ravin as Claire Littleton\n\nEmilie de Ravin starred as the expecting — and eventual new mom — Claire Littleton (one of flight 815's few Australian passengers, despite the Sydney to Los Angeles flight path).\n\nIn 2010, she costarred with Robert Pattinson in the romantic drama Remember Me before moving on to play Belle on Once Upon a Time and the Australian miniseries True Colours.\n\nShe has been engaged to director Eric Bilitch since 2016, with whom she has two children.\n\n11 of 17\n\nHarold Perrineau as Michael Dawson\n\nHarold Perrineau played Michael Dawson, the dedicated dad to his son, Walt.\n\nPerrineau has had several TV roles since Lost on shows like Sons of Anarchy, Criminal Minds, Wedding Band, Constantine, Claws, Star, The Rookie and Peacock's The Best Man: The Final Chapters, the limited series following the 1999 film The Best Man and its sequel. He has also appeared in films like Zero Dark Thirty (2012) and Dumplin' (2018).\n\nHe and his wife Brittany have three children.\n\n12 of 17\n\nMalcolm David Kelley as Walt Lloyd\n\nMalcolm David Kelley played Walt Lloyd, a.k.a. \"WAAAALT!\", the only surviving child on flight 815.\n\nHe has continued to act, appearing in the 2017 film Detroit and on shows like Blindspot, Insecure and the 2023 BET+ series Angel.\n\nHe is also half of the pop-rap duo MKTO with his former Gigantic costar Tony Oller.\n\n13 of 17\n\nMichael Emerson as Ben Linus\n\nAs one of \"the Others,\" Ben Linus, Michael Emerson was one of the most enigmatic characters on the show.\n\nAfter Lost, he starred opposite Jim Caviezel in Person of Interest for five seasons. He also appeared on Arrow and starred on the Paramount+ series Evil.\n\nHe wed actress Carrie Preston in September 1998, who also appeared on one episode of Lost as Ben's mother.\n\n14 of 17\n\nHenry Ian Cusick as Desmond Hume\n\nHenry Ian Cusick played Desmond Hume, hatch dweller and Penny's lover.\n\nHe has remained on the small screen since Lost ended, with roles on Scandal, Inhumans, The Passage, The 100 and MacGyver, the latter of which he starred on for six seasons. Cusick has also had a few film roles in moves like The Girl On The Train (2016), Rememory (2017) and The Wind & the Reckoning (2022).\n\nHe and his wife Annie have three children.\n\n15 of 17\n\nIan Somerhalder as Boone Carlyle\n\nIan Somerhalder played original castaway Boone Carlyle, but he was — spoiler alert! — killed off on season 2 (although typical of Lost, he made a few more appearances on the show).\n\nLuckily, his character's death did little to hinder his career. Somerhalder later starred on the HBO series Tell Me You Love Me, but it was his role as Damon Salvatore on The Vampire Diaries that cemented his pop culture status. He also starred on the short-lived Netflix series V Wars.\n\nHe retired from acting to live on a farm with his family, and told E! News in January 2024, \"I love what I did for a really long time. I love making films, I just did it for so long. We had an amazing run.\"\n\nSomerhalder married actress Nikki Reed in 2015, and the couple shares two children.\n\n16 of 17\n\nMaggie Grace as Shannon Rutherford\n\nAs Boone's stepsister Shannon Rutherford, Maggie Grace's time on the island was also relatively short-lived.\n\nIn June 2024, Grace told The Independent that she was \"devastated\" to leave the series.\n\n“I thought they were gonna take her a little further. It’s still the worst heartbreak of my career,\" she said.\n\nHowever, the former model has since appeared in both the Taken and Twilight franchises and starred on Californication, Susanna and Fear the Walking Dead.\n\nShe and her husband, Brent Bushnell, welcomed their son in 2020."
