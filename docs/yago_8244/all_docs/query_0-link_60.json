Susie (Michelle Collins) whose hen night they go out on in the first episode, is worried that her colourful past is about to catch up with her.\n\nDowntrodden Mandy (Pauline Quirke) has found happiness, but in an illicit affair. Teacher Karen (Lesley Manville) is afraid to tell the others she's gay, and high-flier Anna (Frances Barber) doesn't know where her life is going any more.\n\nBest-known, of course, as Cassandra in Only Fools And Horses, Gwyneth says playing Janet presented her with a challenge actresses are, she believes, seldom given.\n\n\"In terms of reading the script and getting excited, it was Janet's anger that really made me think 'fantastic!',\" she explains. \"You rarely see women's anger, either in real life or on the screen. It's almost as if it's frowned upon. When I've seen other actresses playing 'angry' in the past I've always really wanted to do it.\"\n\nNot that Gwyneth is herself prey to Janet-style eruptions. \"The difference between us in that respect is that whereas I can get angry, I don't really have a temper. She just snaps and struggles to control hers in a way I don't. Janet and Steve have a successful relationship, but they haven't dealt with the possibility that they might not be able to have a baby, and it's beginning to tear them apart. Thank God Steve doesn't have a temper as well, otherwise they might have already split up. He's really reasonable and Janet is very lucky to have him.\"\n\nIt's not the first time that the London-born actress has played a woman aching to have a child. She starred as one, alongside Real Women's director Phil Davis, in the sinister BBC2 drama Nice Town. And more than 24million viewers shared Rodney and Cassandra's heartache over a miscarriage in the award-winning Only Fools And Horses 1996 Christmas mini-series, shown again last January.\n\n\"I think it's just a coincidence,\" Gwyneth smiles. \"I certainly didn't see myself as someone who specialises in playing women who are desperate to conceive! But those parts have made me realise how lucky I was with my own kids.\"\n\nGwyneth has a son, Oscar, aged 9, and a seven-year-old daughter Lottie, from her relationship with Bugs star Jesse Birdsall. The couple parted after 15 years together but remain friends.\n\n\"Couples tend to assume that they will be able to have children when they choose. I, for one, never thought for a moment that I wouldn't be able to, which is frightening when I think, through playing Janet, what it might actually be like in that situation.\n\n\"With both Oscar and Lottie, Jesse and I just decided the time was right and that was it, so I'm very fortunate to have never known that feeling. I'd like to take Janet to one side and say 'relax', but that's easier to say than do if you've been trying for a baby for as long as she has.\"\n\nGwyneth stresses, however, that Real Women is about so much more than just the sadness in its characters' lives. \"The serious side of their stories tends to be played out in the home and the fun and laughter happens when they get together,\" she says.\n\n\"In a way, they meet up to forget about the painful things in their lives, but that doesn't mean they don't talk about them. What I think happens with women is they will divulge masses one-to-one but not necessarily in a group. In Janet's case, Pauline'scharacter, Mandy, is the one she confides in.\"\n\nGwyneth admits that, at first, the meaning behind the title Real Women didn't really register with her. \"But when I'd finished reading the script I did kind of think it was about 'real' women, as opposed to how women are often portrayed on television.\n\n\"On one level, Real Women portrays the blood and guts of what it's like to be a woman in today's society, but it's also about the fun and games of it as well.\"\n\nShe agrees that men are still expected to hide emotions that women aren't afraid to show. \"I sympathise with them in that respect, especially as I have a son who's growing up fast, so I hope it gets easier for men.\n\n\"Why shouldn't they be able to talk about what they're going through, in the same way that women do, with their friends? If you can't talk about those things to anyone, you bottle up your true feelings and that ultimately makes things worse.\"\n\nGwyneth adds that she and her \"fellow\" Real Women stars are now as firm friends off screen as they appear on it. \"I already knew Frances and Lesley very well, and I think I worked with Pauline when we were teenagers, but we're not quite sure. I'd never met Michelle before, but we all got on fantastically well.\n\n\"People seem to think, though, that we socialised all the time when we were filming Real Women, but I'd just like to set the record straight and say we went out together twice, maybe three times. Mind you,\" she laughs, \"when we did, we had a ball!\"\n\nReal Women starts on Thursday on BBC1."
