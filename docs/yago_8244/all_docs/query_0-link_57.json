        "text": "Only Fools and Horses still leaves us all in stitches despite coming to a close almost 20 years ago.\n\nThe laugh out loud comedy, created and written by the late great John Sullivan, centred around the chaotic lives of wheeler dealer Del Boy Trotter and his younger brother Rodney.\n\nA staggering ratings hit, the legendary show still holds the record for the highest UK audience for a sitcom episode - with 24.3 million viewers tuning in for 'Time on Our Hands' in 1996.\n\nOnly Fools and Horses was so popular it led to a number of spin-offs, including The Green Green Grass, prequel Rock & Chips and even a musical adaptation in 2019.\n\nWhile the Trotter family were the main focus, there was a strong catalogue of supporting characters including dopey Trigger and the untrustworthy Boycie.\n\nThe original series came to and end in 1991 but spawned a large number of specials until finally coming to a close in 2003.\n\nWhile the sitcom was the peak for some of its stars' careers, many went on to become major successes in the acting world.\n\nHowever, there has been a lot of tragedy as many member of the cast and crew have died young.\n\nDel Boy actor David Jason previously confessed he believes Only Fools and Horses was jinxed by a 'death curse' that saw many of his close friends pass away too soon.\n\nHere is a look at what happened to the cast once the series came to an end.\n\nDel Boy Trotter - David Jason\n\nOne of the most iconic characters in the history of television, Del Boy was the charismatic trader who could sell ice to the eskimos.\n\nThe quick-witted salesman, who struggled with his French, was always up to some sort of scam and eventually settled down with wife Raquel.\n\nActor Sir David Jason was only considered for the part late on but made it his own, even bringing in Del's cheap gold jewellery and trademark camel coat.\n\nSir David has was knighted for services to acting and comedy in 2005 and has won four BAFTAs, four British Comedy Awards and seven NTAs.\n\nHe appeared as Detective Inspector Jack Frost until retiring from the role in 2010 and has also starred in Granville, Open All Hours and The Darling Buds of May.\n\nRodney Trotter - Nicholas Lyndhurst\n\nRodney was Del Boy's awkward younger brother who was often treated as his sidekick and dogsbody.\n\nHaving been raised by Del, Rodney was very dependent on his brother and tried to get away from his get-rich-quick schemes, and after a lack of success with the ladies he eventually married Cassandra.\n\nPopular actor Nicholas Lyndhurst went on to star in many other sitcoms such as Goodnight Sweetheart, The Twof of Us and After You've Gone.\n\nHe also played his character's gangster father Freddie Robdal in Only Fools prequel series Rock & Chips in 2010.\n\nLyndhurst's family suffered a heartbreaking tragedy this year when 19-year-old son Archie died in his sleep from a brain haemorrhage caused by acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukaemia.\n\nThe grieving father shared on his painful loss in a statement, saying: \"Lucy and I are utterly grief stricken and respectfully request privacy.\"\n\nGrandad - Lennard Pierce\n\nOne of the original cast members, Lennard Pearce played Grandad from the start of the show.\n\nBefore appearing on the comedy, the actor had been an esteemed stag ester - working alongside the likes of Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins and appearing in plays including My Fair Lady and Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nGrandad was rarely seen out of his armchair in front of hisTV sets but he was treated as a butler by Del By and Rodney.\n\nTragically, Lennard unexpectedly died midway through filming the fourth series in 1988 from a heart attack aged 69, leaving the entire cast and crew devastated.\n\nScenes he had filmed on location prior to his death were re-shot with Buster Merryfield playing new character Uncle Albert.\n\nUncle Albert - Buster Merryfield\n\nUncle Albert was drafted in to the sitcom after the sad death of Lennard Pearce so that an older member of the Trotter family remained.\n\nWhile not having much acting experience, actor Buster Merryfield was chosen for the part due to his distinctive white beard.\n\nBuster had been an amateur dramatics actor and didn't seriously take on the acting profession until he was 57.\n\nOften found reminiscing about his wartime experiences with the Royal Navy, Albert was Grandad's estranged brother and became famous for his catchphrase \"during the war...\"\n\nSadly, Buster died in 1999 at the age of 78 as a result of a brain tumour - with Albert's death written into the next episode as a tribute.\n\nRaquel Turner - Tessa Peake-Jones\n\nIntroduced because the writers wanted more female characters, Raquel appeared in the 'Dates' special and was intended to be a one-off.\n\nBut she became a permanent character and became a recurring love interest of Del Boy.\n\nDespite their ups and downs, the pair remained a central romance on the series and Raquel eventually became the mother to Del Boy's son, Damien.\n\nTessa stayed with the sitcom until it ended in 1996 episode 'Time on Our Hands' then went on to return for the revival specials from 2001, making her final appearance as Raquel in 2003 special 'Sleepless in Peckham'.\n\nThe actress went on to appear in Midsomer Murders, Doctors, Casualty, Holby City and Doctor Who.\n\nTess actually got married to co-star Douglas Hodge who played an adult version of her on-screen son Damien in Only Fools special 'Heroes and Villains'.\n\nThe couple have two children together and were a couple for 27 years until they split in February 2013.\n\nTrigger - Roger Lloyd-Pack\n\nTrigger was the dim-witted but loveable friend of Del Boy, who got his name because he looks like a horse.\n\nThe 'village idiot' could never get Rodney's name right and always referred to him as Dave.\n\nRoger Lloyd-Pack’s character Trigger was the major supporting actor of Only Fools and Horses - starring in 39 episodes.\n\nRoger enjoyed an incredible career - gaining stand out roles in BBC comedy The Vicar of Dibley and lavish US TV show The Borgias.\n\nHe also became known to a new generation of fans through his Doctor Who appearances and for his role of Barty Crouch, Sr. in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\n\nRoger also had roles in The Catherine Tate Show, The Bill and Doc Martin - with his final role in an episode of Law & Order: UK in 2014.\n\nThe popular actor tragically died from pancreatic cancer in January 2014 at the age of 69, with Only Fools co-stars David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst attending his funeral.\n\nBoycie - John Challis\n\nUntrustworthy care salesman Boycie loved boasting about his wealth and popped up in 33 episodes.\n\nHe was so popular that actor John Challis continued to play the role in his own Only Fools and Horses spin-off The Green Green Grass.\n\nIn The Green Green Grass, Boycie and his wife Marlene were on the run from a criminal gang -
