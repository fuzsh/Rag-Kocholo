You were the island\n\nVenus made with her first smile,\n\nZakynthos, the moment she was born.\n\nNo song embraced your leafy sky,\n\nnot even his who sang the fatal storm\n\nand how Ulysses, his misfortunes past\n\nand beautiful with fame, sailed home at last.\n\nSome will not return: I too\n\noffend the powers that be, am banned\n\nfrom home. Oh maternal land,\n\nmy words are all I have to send to you\n\nA tribute to his birthplace, written while in exile © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes\n\n- Believe the title should read \"To Zacinto\", since Foscolo is writing about a specific place. Moving piece in which the poet's love is easily understood. His love was eventually rewarded when his body was returned to his country. Many of his words have been set to music, and his image has graced postal stamps. I find myself moved often by the poetry of exiled poets; how they maintain a love for the country that, for whatever reason, shuns them.\n\nThis sonnet embraces gentleness of memory, a tribute with a myth figure(Venus), and a literary figure (Ulysses). His gift of words have been cherished for over 100 years. Quite an ode; quite a tribute.\n\non Jan 28 2007 04:08 AM PST edit\n\nRead more →"
