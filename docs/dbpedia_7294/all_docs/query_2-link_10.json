        "text": "Ugo Foscolo\n\nUgo Foscolo (Italian: ˈuːɡo ˈfoskolo; 6 February 1778 in Zakynthos – 10 September 1827 in Turnham Green), born Niccolò Foscolo, was an Italian writer, freemason, revolutionary and poet.[1]\n\nUgo Foscolo, En\n\nNote of his birth and name:\n\nDate 06 Feb 1778 is incorrect date of his birth in lots of sources (such as wikipedia, etc..; a Vittorio Turri and Umberto Renda wote at their \"Dizionario storico-critico della literatura itlaliana\"), it is date of his baptism.\n\nCorrect date of his birth: he was born at 26.1.1778, bapt. 6 Feb 1778\n\nHis real name was a Niccolò Foscolo (Nicolo Foscolo), later he took a name Ugo in the memory of revolutionist Ugo Bassville (Ugo di Basseville)\n\nHe is remembered especially for his 1807 long poem Dei Sepolcri.\n\nDuring the eleven years spent by Foscolo in London, until his death there, he enjoyed all the social distinction which the most brilliant circles of the English capital confer on foreigners of political and literary renown, and experienced all the misery which follows on a disregard of the first conditions of domestic economy. His contributions to the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly Review, his dissertations in Italian on the text of Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio, and still more his English essays on Petrarch, of which the value was enhanced by Barbarina Brand's admirable translations of some of Petrarch’s finest sonnets, heightened his previous fame as a Man of Letters. However, he was frequently accused of financial sloppiness, and ended up spending time in debtors' prison, which affected his social standing after his release."
