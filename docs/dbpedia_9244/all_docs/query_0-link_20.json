        "text": "Moscow is the capital city of Russia, the northernmost megacity in the world, the most populous city in Europe, and with a population of over 11,000,000, the 6th largest city proper in the world. From its origins in the 12th century, Moscow served as the capital of the medieval Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Tsardom of Russian and the Soviet Union. Strategically located on the Moskva River, Moscow is the site of the Kremlin, an ancient fortress that is now a World Heritage Site. The image was acquired September 25, 2010, covers an area of 21 x 23 km, and is located at 55.8 degrees north latitude, 37.7 degrees east longitude.\n\nWith its 14 spectral bands from the visible to the thermal infrared wavelength region and its high spatial resolution of 15 to 90 meters (about 50 to 300 feet), ASTER images Earth to map and monitor the changing surface of our planet. ASTER is one of five Earth-observing instruments launched Dec. 18, 1999, on Terra. The instrument was built by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. A joint U.S./Japan science team is responsible for validation and calibration of the instrument and data products.\n\nThe broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution of ASTER provides scientists in numerous disciplines with critical information for surface mapping and monitoring of dynamic conditions and temporal change. Example applications are: monitoring glacial advances and retreats; monitoring potentially active volcanoes; identifying crop stress; determining cloud morphology and physical properties; wetlands evaluation; thermal pollution monitoring; coral reef degradation; surface temperature mapping of soils and geology; and measuring surface heat balance.\n\nThe U.S. science team is located at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. The Terra mission is part of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C."
