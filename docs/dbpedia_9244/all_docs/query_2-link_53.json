        "text": "Soviet Union Information Bureau\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nINDUSTRIAL production in the U.S.S.R. definitely passed the pre-war level during the fiscal year [The Soviet fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30.] 1926-27 for the first time since the Revolution. The recovery crowned a steady upward struggle of over five years from the winter of 1921-22, when, as a result of the World War, the civil struggles and foreign invasions, the output of industry had fallen to i per cent of the output for 1913. Industrial production for the fiscal year 1927-28 was approximately 125 per cent of that of 1913. The recovery has been effected without the aid of a single foreign loan.\n\nDuring the later years of the reconstruction period the advance in industrial production was particularly rapid. In 1924-25 the output increased Go per cent over the previous year, in 1925-26 it showed a gain of 40 per cent over 1924-25. By the end of 1925-26 in most instances existing plants and equipment were being utilized to full capacity. Further advances had to be effected largely through new construction and machinery plus greater efficiency. In this respect the year 1926-27 was a crucial year. However, the increase in production during the year was nearly 20 per cent. During 1927-28 the increase held close to 23 per cent, as compared with the same period in 1926-27.\n\nDuring the past three years considerable sums have been made available for capital improvements and expansion in State industry. During 1925-26 upwards of $400,000,000 was so spent. During 1926-27 the expenditure was over $550,000,000. During the year 1927-28 over $650,000,000 was devoted to this purpose. The figures are exclusive of expenditures for the development of electrification and for new railway construction.\n\nIn the above figure for 1928, 60 per cent of the allotment comes from the resources of industry (net profits and depreciation funds), 25 per cent from assignments from the Federal budget, the remainder from long-term loans to industry.\n\nThe amounts expended for new construction, equipment and capital repairs in the various industries during the past three years are as follows (in rubles):\n\n1925-26 1926-27 1927-28 Industries Rubles Rubles Rubles Coal 77,080,000 157,800,000 119,700,000 Oil 150,200,000 180,400,000 197,200,000 Mining (other than above) 14,670,000 14,700,000 15,400,000 Metal 88,910,000 284,900,000 359,900,000 Electro-Technical 13,070,000 17,200,000 17,700,000 Chemical 48,310,000 60,100,000 78,200,000 Timber 17,240,000 29,500,000 39,100,000 Paper 23,920,000 37,600,000 38,200,000 Silicate 33,080,000 42,900,000 80,700,000 Textile 147,150,000 176,500,000 191,400,000 Food 67,600,000 64,700,000 77,800,000 Leather 21,680,000 16,500,000 18,600,000 Other 8,080,000 7,200,000 29,600,000 Total 810,990,000 1,090,000,000 1,263,500,000\n\nIn dollars the above totals are respectively $417,659,850, $561,350,000 and $650,702,500.\n\nFor 1928-29 the new capital allotments for industry, on preliminary figures, were from $775,000,000 to $850,000,000, including $125,000,000 for the metal industry, $114,000,000 for the oil industry, $112,000,000 for the textile industry and $82,000,000 for the coal industry.\n\nThe allotment for 1927-28 was expended in the following categories: Capital repairs 11 per cent, reequipment 56 per cent, new construction 24 per cent, housing 9 per cent. The percentage allotted for new construction has doubled in the past two years.\n\nIn 1927 the Supreme Economic Council published its program for the development of Soviet State industry during the five-year period from October 1, 1927, to October 1, 1932. The plans call for an expenditure of $3,650,000,000 on capital improvements during the period, including $1,406,000,000 for new plants. The plans contemplate a doubling of the industrial output during the five-year period, with a steady reduction of manufacturing costs and prices.\n\nThe investment fund is anticipated to come principally from the profits of State industry and from depreciation funds, which are regularly included in the costs of the industries. The total net profits of State industry for 1926-27 were upwards of $550,000,000. The depreciation funds are scheduled to yield about $1,500,000,000 during the five years. The State budget will be called on to allot from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 annually. Long-term loans will make up the balance.\n\nThe entire industrial activities of pre-war Russia, exclusive of mining, in the present territory of the Soviet Union, were carried on by approximately 13,000 factory establishments. This figure includes only establishments employing 16 or more workers, excepting establishments employing fewer workers and also using mechanical power. During the war period many of these enterprises were liquidated, merged or reorganized. To-day the number of large enterprises operated directly by the State is estimated at 8,750. Enterprises large and small operated by the State have an output of 90 per cent of the total value of industrial production. Many small industrial establishments are operated by industrial cooperatives or by private enterprise.\n\nThe State trusts, which operate as autonomous units for production, are held responsible by the Government through the Supreme Economic Council for results in economy, efficiency, development and profits. There may be several of these trusts operating in a single industry, divided according to geographic or other reasons. Certain trusts may also be responsible only in the Constituent Republic in which they operate. For marketing purposes and for the purchase of raw material and equipment, each individual industry is organized in a syndicate, in which the producing trusts have representation.\n\nThe trusts are built chiefly on the horizontal principle, combining industrial units of uniform type. A smaller number are trusts of the vertical type, merging interdependent industrial units in the consecutive phases of the production process.\n\nAt present there is a twofold trend in State industry. There is a tendency to give more power and initiative to the management of individual plants and to localize responsibility. A decree issued in 1927 embodied this principle. It was designed to promote productive elasticity and cut down bureaucratic procedure. There is also a second trend towards concentration and mergers, which is resulting in more unified management and reduction of production costs.\n\nPrivate interests are free to enter the industrial field. Any citizen may start without formality a private enterprise employing not over 20 workers and clerks. Private enterprises employing over 20 persons and not over ioo persons may be opened with the permission of the local authorities. For larger enterprises a special leasing or concession agreement is necessary.\n\nPrivate concessions for developing the natural resources of the country are operated under leases for a limited period of years (see section under Concessions). Numerous productive enterprises are conducted by cooperative organizations.\n\nIndustry is controlled and coordinated by certain specially created Government organs. Chief of these are the Supreme Economic Council and the Council of Labor and Defense.\n\nThe functions of the S.E.C. are twofold, both regulatory and directive. Its regulatory activity extends over all industries, State, co-operative and private. It publishes regulations for all industries and exercises a general supervision in accord with the working out of a general industrial policy. In its directive function the S.E.C. exercises a centralized direction over all State industries of federal scope, which include the greater part of the large industries. The S.E.C. exercises control over the Supreme Economic Councils of the six Constituent Republics, which direct industrial enterprises of republican scope, and, through regional and local organs, enterprises of localized activity.\n\nThe Council of Labor and Defense includes in its functions the standardization of products, inspections, tests, etc. Its most important activity, that of planning production in all branches along the lines of a scientifically worked out scheme designed to meet the needs of consumption, is exercised through a special organ, Gosplan (the State Planning Commission). Gosplan has become of great importance in the task of achieving a balanced economy. Through its work the country has been able to eliminate waste production and to direct new capital investment along the lines of most urgent need.\n\nGosplan (with its six coordinated bodies in the Constituent Republics) prepares \"control figures\" which make it possible to ascertain the main tendencies of economic development and to outline the fundamental lines of economic policy. These \"control figures\" bearing upon the entire national economy of the U.S.S.R. first appeared in 1925 for the fiscal year 1925-26. The experiment proved of great value, despite the imperfections inevitable in a first attempt. The figures for 1926-27 and 1927-28 represented a solid achievement in economic balance. A general five-year plan of economic development (beginning from October 1, 1927) has also been worked out.\n\nStatistics on the output of industry (in millions of rubles):\n\n1924-25 1925- 26 1926- 27 Census industry (1) 6,758 9,956 11,115 Per cent increase over preceding year ... 47.3 11.6 Of this: State 6,109 8,918 10,154 Co-operative 383 639 691 Private (including concessions) 266 399 270 Small scale industry 1,718 1,963 2,038 Per cent increase over preceding year ... 14.3 3.3 Of this: State 1,325 1,526 1,579 Cooperative 348 389 412 Private (including concessions) 45 48 47 Total industry 8,476 11,919 13,153\n\nIndexes of the physical volume of output of large-scale State industry:\n\nYear Per cent 1921-22 Per cent Gain over Preceding Year 1921-22 100 ... 1922-23 145.8 45.8 1923-24 190.7 30.8 1924-25 310.9 63.0 1925-26 443.8 42.7 1926-27 520.1 17.2 1927-28 629.3\n\nFinances of large State industries:\n\n1924-25\n\nRubles 1925-26\n\nRubles 1926-27\n\nRubles Profits 521,000,000 676,000,000 680,000,000 Losses 63,000,000 66,000,000 80,000,000 Net Profit 458,000,000 610,000,000 600,000,000 Depreciation Fund 277,000,000 360,000,000 398,000,000 Taxes paid to govt 169,000,000 259,000,000 379,000,000 Financing by govt 125,000,000 325,000,000 536,000,000 Net receipts from or payments to the govt − 44,000,000 + 66,000,000 + 157,000,000 Credits 564,000,000 431,000,000 454,000,000 Total Net Income 1,255,000,000 1,467,000,000 1,609,000,000 Of this: Capital expenditures 385,000,000 810,000,000 1,090,000,000 Operating Funds 870,000,000 657,000,000 519,000,000 Total 1,255,000,000 1,467,000,000 1,609,000,000\n\nThirty-five new scientific industrial institutes have been created since the Revolution to carry on research in various branches of industry. These include chemical, radio, silicate, automobile, mineral, thermo-technical, electro-technical, peat, leather, tobacco, metallurgical, mining, geophysical, hydraulic, oil, physico-technical, sugar, coal and agricultural institutes.

Its output in 1927-28 was nearly 25 per cent above pre-war production.\n\nFor purposes of production the oil industry is mainly conducted by three State Trusts, operating respectively in the fields of Baku, Grozny and Emba. The Oil Syndicate, in which the three trusts have representation, handles the marketing. Before the war the Russian oil industry was hampered materially by uneconomic methods and the clashes of small economic units. Labor conditions were bad and early in the century a series of strikes crippled production. The nationalization of the fields under the new régime brought to the industry cohesion and a rational plan of development, incidentally making possible large economies of operation. Since nationalization the industry has been developed conservatively for the future, rather than for snap profits, and substantial technical improvements have been effected.\n\nDuring 1926-27 close to $100,000,000 was spent for new construction, equipment and capital repairs in the industry. A similar sum was allotted for 1927-28. In Grozny in the early part of 1928 only 0.2 per cent of the output was from wells in operation when the fields were nationalized in 1918. In Baku the percentage was somewhat higher.\n\nThe output for the year increased 17 per cent in 1925-26, nearly 25 per cent in 1926-27 and 13 per cent in 1927-28.\n\nThe steady increase in output is shown in the following table:\n\nYear Metric Tons 1913 9,215,911 1920 3,893,000 1921-22 4,629,000 1922-23 5,166,372 1923-24 5,942,290 1924-25 6,960,600 1925-26 8,142,000 1926-27 10,184,000 1927-28 11,502,000\n\nProduction during 1926-27 was divided among the different fields as follows (in metric tons):\n\nBaku 6,893,000 Grozny 2,956,000 Etnba 252,000 Kuban 83,000 Total 10,184,000\n\nThough the oil output increased nearly 25 per cent in 1926-27, the average number of workers employed decreased from 37,444 in 1925-26 to 36,598 in 1926-27.\n\nNew drillings in 1926-27 were 367,567 meters, as compared with 286,958 meters in 1925-26 and 185,265 meters in 1924-25 - a gain of 100 per cent in two years. The drillings for 1926-27 exceeded by nearly 50 per cent the figure of 249,000 meters in 1914.\n\nAverage number of wells in daily operation: 1924-25, 2,278; 1925-26, 2,720; 1926-27, 3,168.\n\nThe improved technical condition of the fields as compared with pre-war conditions is notable. Electrification is general whereas only one-fourth of the wells were electrified before the war. Deep pumping is rapidly replacing the old baling method of exploitation. Rotary drilling, virtually unknown before the war, was used for two-thirds of the drilling in Baku and Grozny in 1927. Hermetic exploitation, unknown before the fields were nationalized, is now in general use, with a resultant great saving in gas and the lighter oils.\n\nDuring the past few years the refineries at Baku and Grozny have been largely refitted and modernized. They are steadily being enlarged. New refineries are under construction at Batum and Tuapse. New cracking plants are being built at both Batum and Grozny.\n\nOil refined at Baku and Grozny (metric tons):\n\n1925-26 1926-27 Per cent increase Baku 3,481,000 3,988,000 14.9 Grozny 2,148,000 2,642,000 23.0 Total 5,629,000 6,630,000 17.8\n\nRefining operations in 1927-28 aggregated 8,760,000 metric tons.\n\nThe pipe line from Grozny to the Black Sea port of Tuapse, 391 miles, was completed early in November, 1928. The existing Baku-Batum pipe line is being remodeled to carry crude oil instead of kerosene and an additional pipe line is now under construction.\n\nOil exports for 1927-28 were nearly triple those of the year 1913. The increased exports are attributable to the increased production, combined with the fact that the present population of the U.S.S.R. is 18 per cent less than that of the former Russian Empire in 1912, plus the fact that the spread of electrification has cut down the domestic demand for kerosene. The character of the exports has greatly changed since prewar days. In 1913 kerosene and lubricating oils made up 77.4 per cent of the exports. By 1926-27 the percentage of kerosene and lubricating oil had fallen to 31.2 per cent, while gasoline nearly equalled both combined.\n\nThe Amtorg Trading Corporation of New York, American representatives of the Soviet Naphtha Syndicate, announced in the spring of 1928 that various contracts with the Standard Oil Company of New York and the Vacuum Oil Company had brought the purchases by those corporations of Soviet oil products to about $10,000,000 per year. The oil is used in markets in the Near East.\n\nOn January 1, 1928, a contract between the Soviet Naphtha Syndicate and the Spanish Oil Monopoly went into effect whereby the Naphtha Syndicate will supply the Spanish Monopoly with 520,000 tons of Soviet oil products, or about 6o per cent of the requirements of the Monopoly.\n\nSoviet oil exports during recent years:\n\nYear Metric Tons 1913 947,700 1922-23 309,716 1923-24 723,176 1924-25 1,337,100 1925-26 1,473,150 1926-27 2,038,800 1927-28 2,683,700\n\nOil exports, classified, for the past few years and for 1913 (metric tons):\n\n1926- 27 1925- 26 1913 Kerosene 438,400 305,500 440,200 Gasoline and Ligroin 599,400 406,300 152,200 Lubricating Oils 167,800 140,300 238,700 Heavy Solar Oil 30,900 50,200 51,000 Mazut (Fuel Oil) 549,800 358,500 64,900 Gasoil 125,000 103,5001 Crude Oil 127,500 109,500 700 TOTAL 2,038,800 1,473,800 947,700\n\nItaly was the leading country for Soviet oil exports in 1926-27, taking over 23 per cent of the total. France and England were next, each with about 19 per cent. A feature of the export trade for 1926-27 was the by France, Spain, Egypt and India.\n\nExports by countries in metric tons:\n\nCountry 1926- 27 1925- 26 1913 Italy 477,700 380,600 12,000 France 386,100 179,400 112,400 England 381,000 384,700 178,300 Germany, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia 346,300 241,400 137,000 Egypt and India 156,200 84,500 123,000 Belgium and Holland 69,400 62,300 116,000 Spain 69,200 14,800 ...

Other countries and bunker Oil 38,200 18,600 73,000 TOTAL 2,038,800 1,473,800 947,700\n\nIn 1927-28 the principal countries receiving Soviet oil exports were Italy 493,900 metric tons, Great Britain 387,400, France 354,800, Germany 344,200, Egypt 218,700, Spain 206,200 (a three-fold increase), India 154,900 (a six-fold increase).\n\nSoviet petroleum products in 1926-27 filled about a half of the requirement of the Italian market, about 18 per cent of the French, 15 per cent of the Spanish, 16.5 per cent of the German and 17 per cent of the Belgian requirements. English imports of Soviet oil products made up about per cent of England's total oil imports and 10.3 per cent of imports of those varieties of oil imported from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe value of Soviet oil exports in 1926-27 was 83,300,000 rubles, an increase of nearly 18 per cent over the previous year. The increase in the volume of exports was 38.4 per cent. In 1927-28 the value of Soviet oil exports was 97,878,000 rubles.\n\nDuring 1926-27 the value of machinery and equipment imported from the United States by the Soviet oil industry was $4,646,177.\n\nCOAL.-The Soviet coal industry has quadrupled its production during the past seven years. The output of the State trusts in 1926-27 was 30,940,000 metric tons, and various private enterprises, operating under leases, brought the total production to 32,500,000 metric tons, or 15 per cent above the production for 1913 in the present territory of the Soviet Union. The increase in output for the year, as compared with 1925-26, in the State trusts, was 27 per cent. In 1927-28 the output of the State trusts was 34,111,000 metric tons.\n\nMany mines, with their equipment, were destroyed during the civil wars and intervention, and in 1920 production had fallen to about 8,000,000 tons.\n\nThough the bulk of the country's coal reserves are in the Asiatic section, 75 per cent of the output comes from the coal mines of the Donetz Basin in the Ukraine.\n\nAbout $80,000,000 was invested in 1926-27 for capital improvements in the coal industry. For 1927-28 about $65,000,000 was allotted and for 1927-28 the sum of $77,000,000. The money comes mainly from the profits of the industry.\n\nWith the expected development of existing and new mines annual production is expected to increase by 1932 to 57,000,000 metric tons, or more than double the pre-war rate.\n\nMany technical improvements unknown before the war have been introduced into the industry. Coal-cutting machines, of which there were none in 1913, accounted for 11.4 per cent of the production in 1926-27--in the Donetz Basin 16 per cent. Production by cutting machines will provide nearly one-third of the output in the Donetz Basin in 1928-29. The Donugol Trust reported that 75 per cent of its mechanical installations were driven by electricity in 192627.\n\nA number of American engineers have been engaged to assist in the development of plans for the opening of new mines. The consultant American firms include Stuart, James and Cooke of New York and Allen and Garcia of Chicago. The Government's plans for the industry for the next five years call for the opening of a large number of mines fully supplied with modern production and loading equipment. This program will cost about $350,000,000.\n\nThere were 217,061 workers employed in the coal industry in 1926-27. Production per man is still very low by western standards, though in the past two years it has increased 32 per cent. The monthly coal output per surface miner in the Donetz Basin in 1913 was 58.2 metric tons; in 1927-28 it was 62.1 metric tons. However, production per man for all workers was still below that of 1913, due to the reduction of working hours. In 1913 surface workers had a workday of 10 to 12 hours and underground men 8 to 10 hours. At present surface men have a workday of 8 hours and underground men 6 hours. Wages are double those of 1913, plus cheap rent, vacations with pay and social insurance.\n\nCoal production in U.S.S.R. by State trusts, with comparison of production in present territory in 1913:\n\nYear Thousands of metric tons Percentage of 1913 1913 28,356 100.00 1920 8,193 28.8 1921-22 9935 35.0 1922-23 12,132 42.7 1923-24 16,189 57.1 1924-25 16,474 58.1 1925-26 24,389 86.0 1926-27 30,950 109.1 1927-28 34,198 120.3\n\nCoal exports, European frontiers (metric tons):\n\n1925-26 247,571 1926-27 272,218 1927-28 219,289\n\nPEAT.- The exploitation of the peat fields in the central section of the European portion of the Soviet Union has increased rapidly during recent years. The output:\n\nYear Metric Tons 1913 1,500,000 1924-25 2,439,000 1925-26 3,110,000 1926-27 4,703,000 1927-28 4,900,000\n\nMETAL ORES.- The metal mining industry has been one of the slowest to recover in the Soviet Union, owing to the destruction of heavy industry during the war period, and to deterioration, etc.\n\nThe production of Iron Ore, which fell to practically nothing during the years of civil war, has made a rapid recovery during recent years. The deposits of Krivoi Rog in the Ukraine furnish about 70 per cent of the production, those of the Urals supply about 27 per cent. The output:\n\nYear Metric Tons 1913 8,689,000 1923-24 948,000 1924-25 2,207,000 1925-26 3,308,000 1926-27 4,815,000 1927-28 5,977,000\n\nOutput of Manganese Ore, in thousands of metric tons:\n\n1913 1923-24 1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 Nikopol 251 100 380 815 925 Chiaturi 970 320 436 772 693 1,221 420 816 1,587 1,618\n\nProduction of manganese concentrates in 1926-27 was: Nikopol, 472,000 metric tons; Chiatur1, 338,000; total, 810,000.\n\nExports of manganese (metric tons):\n\n1913 91,000 1926-27 785,000 1927-28 499,000\n\nThe non-ferrous metal industries in Tsarist Russia were never highly developed. In 1913 Russia produced only 27 per cent of the zinc consumed in the country, 2 per cent of the lead and 80 per cent of the copper. Four-fifths of the zinc was supplied in what is now Polish territory. Some of the large copper smelting plants in Transcaucasia were taken over by Turkey as a result of war-time changes of territory. Of recent years the non-ferrous metal industries have been rebuilt. Capital expenditures were $13,700,000 in 1927-28; they will be $22,600,000 in 1928-29. The output of copper, zinc and lead:\n\nCopper Zinc Lead Production (metric tons) Per cent of Total Consumption Production (metric tons) Per cent of Total Consumption Production (metric tons) Per cent of Total Consumption 1913 33,700 80 10,500 27 1,321 2 1921-22 877 --- --- --- --- --- 1922-23 2,710 --- 187 --- 190 --- 1923-24 5,720 --- 517 --- 231 --- 1924-25 12,578 42 1,493 8 644 3 1925-26 18,102 54 1,893 9.5 1,034 4 1926-27 21,926 50 2,210 8 1,274 3.6 1927-28 23,680 47 4,300 13 3,000 7\n\nVirtually no tin or aluminum is produced in the Soviet Union.

The largest producers are the Olekma-Vitim district in the Lena-Baikal region, and the Aldan region. In the former the Lena Goldflelds concession produces about 35 per cent of the total output of the country. The Lena Goldflelds Company, which received a long-term concession from the Soviet Government in 1925, is making considerable progress in mechanizing its industrial processes.\n\nRecently the nine former State trusts operating in the industry have been united in one large company, and an extensive development is planned.\n\nFavorable conditions, including exemption from taxes and equipment loans, are offered by the State to individual prospectors.\n\nProduction in kilograms:\n\n1913 49,239 1924-25 25,258 1925-26 25,149 1926-27 23,152\n\nPlatinum production before the war was carried on mainly in the Ural mines near Nizhne-Turinsk. The annual output was 27,000 pounds avoirdupois. Production was carried on by unsystematic, wildcat methods with primitive apparatus and the employment of hand labor, chiefly women. The cheap exploitation was exceedingly wasteful. Owing to the lack of capital the revival of the industry was not begun until 1924.\n\nProduction:\n\nYear Ounces 1924 56,900 1925 94,800 1926 92,700 1927 100,000\n\nPlatinum exports in kilograms:\n\n1924-25 2,924.6 1925-26 4,098.3 1926-27 5,073.1 1927-28 2,454.9\n\nMINERAL SALT.- Found in the Soviet Union in salt lakes, salt wells and rock salt. The Donetz Basin is the principal producing area. Lake salt is obtained principally in the Perm and Astrakhan provinces and the Artemovsk and Slavyansk districts.

Export in 1926-27 was 9,947 metric tons; in 1925-26, 7,215 metric tons.\n\nTEXTILES.- The restorative process in the textile industry was completed at the end of 1925-26. In 1926-27 the production of cotton goods was 113.9 per cent of that of 1913, of woolen goods 91.5 per cent and of flax, hemp and other fibers 120.6 per cent. All branches of the industry showed a healthy growth during the year.\n\nCapital construction in the textile industry, which made it possible for the industry to surpass the pre-war rate of production, was carried out as follows during the reconstruction years (in millions of rubles):\n\n1922-23 1923-24 1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 Total Capital repairs 5.0 14.0 23.0 40.6 26.5 109.1 Re-equipment and broadining out\n\nof existing mills 3.0 20.5 35.0 82.0 100.4 240.9 New mills ... ... ... 11.5 28.0 39.5 Total 8.0 34.5 58.0 134.1 154.9 389.5 Millions of dollars 4.1 17.8 29.9 69.1 79.8 199.7\n\nThe sum of $101,182,000 was devoted to capital expenditures in the industry during the year 1927-28.\n\nThe textile industry showed net profits of $100,425,000 in 1925-26 and $109,695,000 in 1926-27. Between January 1 and October 1, 1927, the wholesale prices of textiles were reduced 10.8 per cent.\n\nThe seven-hour day for workers had been largely introduced in the textile industry by the spring of 1928.\n\nStatistics of production follow:\n\nCOTTON FABRICS 1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 Number of Factories 159 177 199 Production: Cotton Yarn, metric tons 178,476 232,700 268,40 Unbleached cloth, meters 1,604,500,000 2,132,500,000 2,458,300,000 Finished Cloth, meters 499,000,000,367,800 2,030,300,000 2,342,600,000 Number of workers 367,800 458,500 474,100\n\nWOOLEN FABRICS 1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 Number of Factories 81 76 75 Production: Woolen Yarn, metric tons 27,664 32,943 41,248 Unbleached Cloth, meters 52,580,000 67,501,000 84,142,000 Finished Cloth, meters 49,287,000 64,814,000 85,379,000 Number of Workers 62,000 63,300 62,400\n\nLINEN FABRICS 1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 Number of Factories 55 60 62 Production: Linen Yarn, metric tons 47,536 66,003 67,612 Linen Cloth, sq. meters 134,076,000 171,184,000 194,669,000 Capital Expenditures of the entire textile industry, rubles 52,300,000 147,150,000 176,500,000\n\nFor 1927-28 the output of cotton yarn was 314,000 metric tons, an increase of 23.5 per cent, cotton cloth 2,536 million meters, an increase of 8 per cent. The output of woolen yarn was 48,100 metric tons, an increase of 16.9 per cent, woolen cloth 9 million meters, an increase of 15.8 per cent. Production of linen fabrics decreased 2 per cent.\n\nMETAL INDUSTRY.- In the three years from 1924-25 to 1927-28 the Soviet metal industry increased its output of pig iron, steel and rolled iron 250 per cent. The output of steel and rolled iron now equals pre-war production; pig iron is So per cent of pre-war. Production of agricultural machinery and of several kinds of technical machinery has progressed far beyond the pre-war level. Many new plants with the newest technical apparatus are under construction. An ambitious program for the expansion of the industry has been adopted for the next five years. The sum of $175,000,000 was allotted for capital improvements in the industry during the year 1927-28, including mining.\n\nStatistics of the industry:\n\nNumber of Units in Operation (Maximum) 1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 Blast Furnaces 45 59 68 Open Hearths 115 152 io6 Rolling Mills 241 245 244 Production, metric tons Pig Iron 1,291,511 2,194,665 2,963,253 Steel 1,868,342 2,910,949 3,586,249 Rolled Iron 1,390,203 2,249,922 2,730,547 Output of Iron Ore, metric tons 2,132,830 3,306,534 4,816,703 Capital Expenditures for the Whole Metal Industry, rubles 60,000,000 188,910,000 284,900,000 Average Number of Workers 362,555 483,159 513,658\n\nIn 1927-28 theoutput of pig iron was 3,281,000 metric tons, steel 4,150,000 metric tons, rolled iron 3,367,000 metric tons, iron ore 5,977,000 metric tons.\n\nProduction of locomotives and railroad cars:\n\nLocomotives Cars 1923-24 141 433 1924-25 186 750 1925-26 305 1,701\n\nProduction of industrial machinery has shown great advances in the past few years. Production of agricultural machinery in 1927-28 was more than double the pre-war output. The value was 132,100,000 rubles, as compared with 99,600,000 rubles in 1926-27.\n\nProduction of agricultural implements:\n\n1925-26 1926-27 Plows 933,458 1,000,000 Drills 60,641 60,000 Threshers 56,492 69,000 Binders 106,643 174,000 Scythes 3,067,000 3,700,000 Sickles 1,867,000 993,000\n\nELECTRO-TECHNICAL INDUSTRY.- The output of this industry is nearly double the pre-war production. Equipment and technical efficiency are well above the pre-war standard. The Electro-technical Trust has plants at Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov and in the Urals. The output of 1926-27 included four io,000 horsepower hydraulic turbines. During the year the Trust completed the electrical installations for the first electrified railroad in the Soviet Union, running from Baku to Surakhany, in the heart of the oil fields.\n\nProduction, value in rubles:\n\n1925-26 143,518,000 1926-27 167,454,000 1927-28 (estimate) 220,890,000\n\nProduction of electrical equipment:\n\nProduction 1925-26 1926-27 Motors and Generators, kw. capacity 177,605 300,000 Transformers, kw. capacity 257,995 270,000 Insulating cable meters 25,845,907 31,500,000 Cable, meters 1,961,122 2,400,000 Electric lamps 14,422,398 15,000,000 Telephone apparatus, sets 57,097 95,000\n\nIn 1927-28 the output of the electro-technical industry increased 32.5 per cent. Production of telephone, telegraph and radio apparatus increased 46 per cent. Production of electric lamps reached 15,500,000.\n\nPAPER INDUSTRY.- Paper consumption in the Soviet Union has risen with the spread of literacy. In 1927-28 the per capita consumption of paper was estimated at 3.5 kilograms, as compared with 2.7 kilograms in 1913. The paper industry has tripled its output in the past three years. In 1926-27 production of paper was 6.8 per cent above that of 1913. In 1913, 40 per cent of the paper used was imported, in 1926-27 Only 25 per cent. Only 3 per cent of the newsprint paper used in 1926-27 was of domestic manufacture, but the opening of several new plants increased this to 20 per cent in 1927-28.\n\nThe two principal new plants are the Balakhna plant near Nizhi-Novgorod, opened to partial operation in 1928, and the plant at Kondapoga in Karelia, now nearing completion. The Balakhna plant will have an annual output of 60,000 tons of newsprint by 1930-31. These new plants with their modern equipment will cut the cost of newsprint nearly o per cent. By the end of 1928 for the first time Soviet newspapers in the central district had a full supply of domestic newsprint paper.\n\nThe paper plants now in construction assure a domestic supply of paper of all kinds aggregating 7,5,000 tons annually by 1930-31 or six times the pre-war supply.\n\nOutput, in thousands of metric tons:\n\nPaper Cardboard Cellulose Woodpulp 1923-24 117.9 12.4 35.5 44.4 1924-25 213.2 20.2 54.0 54.2 1925-26 257.3 26.4 68.4 68.0 1926-27 267.5 39.0 75.6 73.2\n\nImports of paper in 1926-27 were 107,856 metric tons, as compared with 141,300 metric tons in 1925-26 and 157,400 metric tons in 1913.\n\nCHEMICAL INDU5TRY.- Statistics of output of the heavy chemical industry, in metric tons:\n\nYear Acids Alkalis Superphosphates Other Salts 1923-24 132,977 116,207 26,653 59,608 1924-25 165,344 150,482 52,997 69,851 1925-26 220,785 199,634 80,618 89,653 1926-27 256,116 242,612 89,975 103,538\n\nOutput of alkalis for the first half of 1927-28 was 137,700 metric tons, an increase of 19 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year.\n\nLEATHER INDUSTRY- The leather industry is comparatively new in Russia. Before the war the country exported raw hides and imported large quantities of leather. To-day the industry is able to handle the domestic requirements for sole leather and part of the requirements for upper leather. During the three years ending September 30, 1927, over $16,500,000 was spent for capital construction in the State leather factories. The capacity of the tanning factories has been raised to nearly 11,000,000 hides per annum. Pre-war production in the industry was passed in 1925-26. The output has more than doubled in the past few years.\n\nDuring 1926-2 7 the output of hides in the U.S.S.R. was 10,200,000. Of these about two million were used locally by peasants, 7,350,000 were used in large State industries, 2,000,000 in small handicraft industries and the remainder by cooperatives and private enterprises.\n\nStatistics of census (includes all industries employing 16 or more workers and using mechanical power, or employing 30 or more wokers without mechanical power) leather factories:\n\nNumber of Enterprises Number of Employees Value of output 1922-23 580 31,599 $75,190,000 1923-24 555 29,225 83,430,000 1924-25 559 33,956 112,270,000 1925-26 553 35,374 164,800,000 1926-27 487 34,178 182,310,000\n\nIn addition to the above, the output of small hand enterprises in 1926-27 is estimated at $58,710,000 or nearly a third of the census industry.\n\nOutput of hides and skins in large-scale leather factories, in thousands:\n\nYear Hides Skins 1924-25 7,798 5,886 1925-26 8,299 8,656 1926-27 8,968 10,964 1927-28 10,000 15,600\n\nOutput of shoes (pairs):\n\n1916 10,800,000 1926-27 14,700,000 1927-28 23,000,000\n\nImports of dressed leather were $2,107,380 in 1926-27, as compared with $2,861,340 in 1925-26.\n\nRUBBER INDUSTRY.- The rubber industry passed the prewar volume in 1926-27.

Much of he output was in territory lost as a result of the war. Within he plants that still remained there had been much destruction nd deterioration. In 1920 the output of the glass industry was 3.2 per cent of pre-war and in the china industry 4.5 per cent. By 1926-27 the glass industry reached 5 per cent of pre-war production and the china industry 105 per cent.\n\nThe output, in rubles:\n\nYear Glass China 1925-26 76,985,000 30,870,000 1926-27 90,682,000 38,323,000\n\nOutput in metric tons:\n\nYear Glass China 1913 85,000 44,000 1924-25 175,000 28,000 1925-26 246,000 35,000 1926-27 282,000 45,000\n\nCEMENT INDUSTRY.- The output in recent years, in metric tons:\n\n1924-25 716,468 1925-26 1,317,600 1926-27 1,556,700 1927-28 1,836,900\n\nExport of cement, in metric tons:\n\n1913 6,903 1924-25 30,078 1925-26 38,612 1926-27 48,522\n\nMATCH INDUSTRY.- During the past few years there has been a great improvement in equipment and standardization in the industry, and in the quality of the product. An export trade is being developed to Denmark, Finland, China, Great Britain, the United States and North Africa. The output, in cases of 1,000 boxes:\n\n1913 3,703,000 1922-23 1,425,233 1923-24 1,882,587 1924-25 3,162,100 1925-26 3,593,900 1926-27 4,199,700 1927-28 5,457,100\n\nExports for 1926-27 were 82,000 cases.

In addition, during the World War and the civil conflicts, many sugar factories were destroyed or severely damaged. In 1921 sugar production fell to 2.9 per cent of the pre-war rate. The recovery of the industry was belated, but the output is now apidly approaching the pre-war rate. During the past three years $20,000,000 has been spent on capital improvements in the industry.\n\nIn technical organization the industry has made much progress in recent years. The number of workers employed in the industry per unit of production was 20 per cent less in 1926-27 than in 1914. Fuel consumption expressed as a percentage of weight of sugar beets was 8.5 per cent, as compared with 22 per cent in 1920 and 8.7 per cent in 1914.\n\nPlants in operation in 1926-27 numbered 155.\n\nStatistics of output, in metric tons:\n\n1910-13 (average) 1,513,000 1924 411,000 1925 963,000 1926 871,019 1927 1,336,570\n\nPersia and Afghanistan are the main markets for sugar export, but Soviet sugar is now finding its way to the border countries and as far west as France.

Alcoholic beverages are sold under severe restrictions regarding quantity to one person, etc. The sale to minors or intoxicated persons is prohibited.\n\nProduction of vodka, in hectoliters:\n\n1913 4,636,000 1925-26 1,577,000 1926-27 1,804,000\n\nFISHING INDUSTRY- The annual fish catch in the Soviet Union is now about equal to pre-war. Eleven State trusts in the various fishing centers of the country, with a capital of $25,000,000 and an annual output of $50,000,000 handle more than half of the fish put on the market. The largest trust is the Volga-Caspian Fish Trust which operates at the mouth of the Volga.\n\nOf the total catch at present only 10 per cent is frozen, 2 per cent canned, the remainder salted or smoked.\n\nAnnual catch, in metric tons:\n\n1913 887,600 1923 490,000 1924 535,600 1925 635,500 1926 758,500 1927 787,900\n\nExports of fish products, value in rubles:\n\n1925-26 1926-27 Fish 4,507,000 3,823,000 Black Caviar 4,191,000 2,887,000 Red Caviar 1,674,000 618,000 Fish Glue 84,000 125,000\n\nThe value of exports of fish products for 1927-28 was 12,458,000 rubles, an increase of nearly 6o per cent over the previous year.\n\nA Fisheries Convention between the Soviet Union and Japan was signed January, 1928. The Convention settled questions relating to the operation of fisheries in Soviet Pacific waters by Japanese nationals, which had been pending for some years. The output of Japanese salmon canneries on the shores of Kamchatka amounts annually to between 40 and 50 million yen.\n\nTIMBER INDUSTRY.- The timber industry has made notable advances during the past few years, though it has not yet reached the pre-war rate of production. The industry suffered a complete collapse during the period of the World War and the civil conflicts. The reconstruction of the industry began in 1921. The concentration of a major portion of the industry in a small number of State trusts, replacing the hundreds of small units of pre-war days, has resulted in effective economies and more orderly development. In 1926-27 the trusts produced over 71 per cent of the output of sawmills. They accounted for only 20 per cent of the logging and 31 per cent of the output of wood fuel, such operations being conducted largely by cooperative and private groups.\n\nThe six principal trusts are:\n\n1. Severoles, operating in the northern part of European Russia in the region of the White Sea;\n\n2. Karelles, operating in the territory of the Karelian Republic;\n\n3. Sevzaples, in the northwestern part of Russia with Leningrad as its export center;\n\n4. Dvinoles, operating in the region of the river Western Dvina;\n\n5. Lesbel, operating in the territory of the White Russian Republic; and\n\n6. Dalles, operating in the Far East.\n\nTotal of lumber production (In Millions of Cubic Feet):\n\n1924-23 1925-26 1926-27 Logs 614.0 893 812 Of this produced by trusts 148.2 300.5 251 Per cent of total 24 33.6 31 W00d for Fuel 1550 1885 2400 Of this produced by trusts 142 264 477 Per cent of total 9 14 20\n\nProduction of saw-mills:\n\nYear Cubic fee 1913 441,219,01 1924-25 196,000,01 1925-26 282,000,000 1926-27 370,000,000\n\nThe progress of the operations of saw-mills controlled by trusts during the past six years has been as follows:\n\nNo. of saw mills in operation Total No. of workers Production (thousands of cubic feet) Production per gang-saw (1,000 cubic feet) 1921-22 480 .... 61,360 71 1922-23 327 36,600 105,787 148 1923-24 362 36,763 135,211 174 1924-25 294 34,231 168,600 236 1925-26 332 38,960 209,900 269 1926-27 339 48,627 263,100 303\n\nThe production of veneer in the U.S.S.R., which is largely concentrated in the hands of the Veneer Trust, has shown an increase of 49 per cent over the pre-war production. During the past five years the industry increased its output nearly sixfold. Production of veneer:\n\nCubic meters 1922-23 21,484 1923-24 49,877 1924-25 69,615 1925-26 90,100 1926-27 122,600\n\nThe normal rate of annual growth of the pulpwood forests in the U.S.S.R. is about 4,910,000 metric tons, of which only about '5 per cent is exploited.\n\nEngland takes over half the timber exports of the Soviet Union. Other countries of export are France, Germany, Japan, Egypt, South Africa, the United States. Total exports over the European frontier:\n\nMetric tons Value 1925-26 1,666,700$26,795,000 1926-27 2,133,200 36,185,000 1927-28 2,495,218 41,337,000\n\nTimber products worth $60,000 were exported to the United States in 1925-26 and $120,000 in 1926-27.\n\nBUILDING INDUSTRY- With the general rise of industrial production has come a rapid advance in the building industry, though this advance is still behind the rapidly increasing requirements of the country.\n\nStatistics of amounts spent for new construction and capital repairs, in millions of rubles:\n\nYear Urban and Industrial Rural Housing Total 1924-25 860 1,216 2,076 1925-26 1,485 1,341 2,826 1926-27 1,942 1,369 3,311\n\nOf the 4,300,000,000 rubles ($2,200,000,000) spent for building construction outside of the villages during the past three years, 30 per cent was accounted for by industrial, electrification and trade enterprises, 30 per cent for housing, 20 per cent for buildings for transport and communications, 12 per cent for public utility and Government buildings, S per cent for health and educational institutions.\n\nThe sources of finances for the entire building program of the Soviet Union are shown in the following table (in millions of rubles):\n\n1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 1927-28 (program) State Budget 382 548 764 994 Local Budgets 118 209 280 344 Own Resources of Industry and Population 1576 2069 2267 2367 Total 2076 2826 3311 3705\n\nThe housing shortage in the cities, inherited from the old régime, is still acute but is being markedly reduced by increasing new construction. Figures for new construction in cities and industrial communities follow:\n\n1924-25 1925-26 1926-27 Expenditures for New Housing (rubles) 156,00,000 286,700,000 393,000,000 Dwellings Built (in sq. meters) 1,840,000 3,160,000 4,200,000 Per cent increase over previous year's expenditure 72.0 83.3 36.9\n\nIn addition to these sums expended for new housing considerable outlays have been made for capital and other repairs to houses. These amounted to the following (in rubles):\n\n1924-25 108,000,000 1925-26 164,000,000 1926-27 185,000,000\n\nThe proportion of the expenditures for new housing in urban centers made by the various groups of builders during the past three years was as follows:\n\nPer Cent Industry and Power Companies 31.4 Commissariat for Transport 7.8 Municipal Authorities 22.7 Cooperatives 8.5 Private Parties 29.6 Total 100.0\n\nSHIPBUILDING.- The building of commercial ships in the Soviet Union is an industry of recent origin. Before the war shipbuilding was confined almost entirely to the building of war vessels. In 1925-26 fabricated metal utilized in the construction of merchant ships amounted to 9,500 metric tons; in 1926-27 it was 25,700 metric tons. The maximum pre-war tonnage so used was 6,000 tons.\n\nIn 1924-25 nine vessels were launched in Soviet shipyards, 26 vessels in 1925-26, 27 vessels in 1926-27. The average tonnage was 3,700 tons as compared with 1,000 tons in prewar days. Most of the new ships are equipped with Diesel engines.\n\nThere are four large groups of shipbuilding plants, under the supervision of the Chief Metals Administration. They are located in the northwest, central, south and Far Eastern regions. The Leningrad Ship Trust is the most important.\n\nThe five-year plan for the industry calls for the completion by 1931-32 of 299 vessels with a dead weight tonnage of 994,000 tons at a total cost of $200,000,000. The new ships will be distributed as follows: 163 for Sovtorgflot (Soviet trading fleet), 117 for the Caspian service, 19 for the Naphtha Syndicate. During the fiscal year 1927-28 $27,000,000 was expended on new building.\n\nFur Trade- The fur trade is of increasing importance in the Soviet Union, and exports of furs have increased o per cent during the past three years.\n\nState and co-operative organizations furnish 8 per cent of fur procurements. Private traders handle the remainder.\n\nValue of exports, in rubles:\n\n1923-24 51,400,000 1924-25 63,400,000 1925-26 67,537,253 1926-27 86,969,775 1927-28 120,000,000\n\nOf the recent export the major part was handled by the State trading organizations of the Constituent Republics, nearly a fourth by the cooperatives, about 4 per cent by mixed companies (foreign private capital and Soviet State capital).\n\nFor the first time Germany replaced England as the largest customer in 1926-27, and further consolidated this position in 1927-28. In the latter year, Germany took 45 per cent of the fur export, England 25 per cent, the United States zo per cent, France 8 per cent. The major part of the furs, however, eventually found their way to the United States. In 1927-28 for the first time there was fur export to South America.\n\nExport of various furs in 1926-27 and 1925-26:\n\nQuantity 1926-271925-26 Squirrel 8,582,760 10,389,059 Dressed Squirrel 11,038 16,807 Fox 348,436 385,792 White Fox 103,845 62,172 Marten 28,691 55,828 Ermine 595,101 680,951 Kolinsky 259,244 344,071 Mink 50,226 48,331 Sable 11,415 18,166 Fitch 917,222 961,611 Hare 6,654,912 3,371,125 Marmot 466,218 650,289 Korsuk 22,836 71,629 Peschanik 4,240,065 5,439,407 Suslik 2,659,519 275,303 Wolf 14,234 20,857 Otter 896 Bear 3,090 2,343 Lynx 3,371 3,039 Wolverine 1,271 1,677 Cat 6,233 14,845 Jackal 3,259 8,406 Dog 109,019 3,398 Burunduk 681,942 405,799 Weasel 46,379 42,094 Mole 66,860 8,092 Sea Lion 1,742 14,706 Dressed Suslik 21,628 8,637 Dressed Squirrel spines 46,780 Badger 66,062 54,721 Karakul 804,723 287,408 Krimmer 10,606 32,694 Pony 296,016 213,766 Muflon 234,987 95,705 Merlushka 900,552 77,378\n\nCensus industry includes all industries employing 16 or more workers and using mechanical power, or employing 30 or more workers without mechanical power."
