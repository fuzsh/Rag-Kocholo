        "text": "Yes. Originally, Moscow became a center of power as a defensive measure against Mongols, since it was seen as a \"remote, forested location\" for the descendants of Kievan Rus. One Wikipedia article says that \"a number of rivers provided access to the Baltic and Black Seas and to the Caucasus region\", but it seems to me it is in the Volga basin, so the best access would be to the Caspian Sea. Anyway, it does seem like a somewhat random place, with the location presently known as Nizhny Novgorod being a more obvious alternative at the time.\n\nIn the modern time, the immediate reason to move the capital to Moscow was an anticipated loss of Petrograd to the German offensive. In February 1918, Lenin's military situation was desperate and he was in fact lucky to achieve a peace at a cost of \"only\" Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine.\n\nMoving the capital of the Soviet Russia to Kiev was out of the question, because it was a Ukrainian city. Despite strong russification (especially in the 19th century), it remained Ukrainian. Even after establishment of the USSR, Russia remained a dominant republic, having more people and industry than Ukraine, so there was no reason to move the center of political power to a not-so-sure location.\n\nIf the question specifically asks about how Moscow became more influential than Kiev, the answer is in the history of Eastern politics. First of all, Kiev never was a \"Russian\" city per say. Yes, it was the center of eastern Slavs and the center of Slavic civilization for thousands of years. Yes, it introduced Christianity to that part of the world and was considered to be the first state in the Slavic world. However, it never was \"Russian\" in that \"Russians\" as we know them now didn't emerge as an entity until much later in time.\n\nMoscow as a state was established by a small clan of northern Slavs led by Rurikoviches. In time it became relatively strong and Moscow began to compete against surrounding city states such as Kiev, Novgorod and others. As a result, Kiev and Moscow were always competing parties. The peak of this competition came during the reign of the most famous of Rurikoviches, Ivan the Terrible, who was able to conquer most of the Slavic cities and some Lithuanian, with the exception of Kiev. Kiev was always coveted by the Russian Empire, mostly for the greater agricultural and labor resources that were surrounding the city. Later the passage to the Black Sea became crucial since Russians were land locked.\n\nThe dream of Russian kings and queens to add Ukraine to the collection of their trophies didn't come through until 1648, when Ukrainian Ccossacks, being worn out by constant Polish invaders, had to make the choice between Catholic Pols and Orthodox Russians. The question of religion prevailed and they chose to join Russia. Since then, Russia did anything possible to diminish the importance of Kiev and Ukraine. They even came up with a different name for Ukrainians, calling them \"small Russians\". Ukrainians on the other hand never stopped fighting the Russians.\n\nDuring the time of the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, Ukrainian people revolted against the Russian Empire and were able to establish an independent Ukrainian state. Unfortunately the communist invasion of 1919 ended Ukraine's independence and unleashed a streak of bloodshed and genocide against Ukrainians. Kiev could never become a capitol of the Soviet Union for the simple reason that doing so would mean having to acknowledge the importance of Ukraine. Neither Lenin nor Stalin would do that, as they didn't consider Ukrainians to be human beings.\n\nLenin bargained at the end of WWI by giving away the Ukrainian land to Germans. Stalin caused the two largest famines in the history of the world on the territory of Ukraine and starved to death approximately 3 million people. Because of this, I think the answer to why Moscow was so dominant is obvious: it builds its power on the bones of others. This is past history of course, but I don't think that many things changed since then.\n\nIn the medieval times, Moscow wasn't exactly \"in the middle of nowhere\". In the times of the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality, before it became a capital, Moscow was already at the crossing of important trade routes including acces to the river trade route.\n\nAs for the security reasons, location was good because of existence of the Principality of Ryazan and the lands of the Mordvins on the way of Tatars' rides. But that was also good in another aspect - barbarian invasions stopped rivals of Moscow from developing a stronger economy, so it was later relatively easier for Muscovy to take over its neighbors.\n\nAll of that led to situation where for both craftsmen and peasants it was the best option to settle in or around Moscow.\n\nAnother reason worth to mention were simply smart leaders, who were better politicians and had stronger ambitions than their rivals from surrounding countries. This way they could win e.g. the rivalisation with the strongest local opponent of Moscow, which in 14th century was the Principality of Tver. In the beginnings the city of Tver was more important than Moscow, but thanks to good foreign policy, Moscow was able to change that.\n\nI recommend you a good Polish language article on that matter. With help of Google Translate you'll receive some good information.\n\nMichaelF, to answer the second part of your question, or just maybe an aside to your post, St. Petersburg was originally created by Peter the Great who was seen as extremely progressive, and had an interest in western culture.\n\nSt. Petersburg was originally, as DVK had stated earlier, swamp land. Peter needed to fill in this area with sand and clay in order to build his city. With that said, the capital was moved from Moscow to Peter's new city during his reign. Although this was the capital until the 20th century, the coronations of the rulers like Catherine the Great and Peter III were still conducted in Moscow.\n\nNonetheless, the anti-capitalist Lenin had no interest in moving the capital back to the \"westernized\"city.\n\nBefore it was Leningrad, it was Tsar Nicholas II who changed the name of St. Petersburg to Petrograd. Nicholas was a arguably a patriotic Russian who wished, during WWI, to separate the west from Russia.\n\nIt was also mentioned by that it was moved away from the front during WWI.\n\nInterestingly enough, from what I can remember, Kiev was originally one of the first Christian (Orthodoxy) cities in the east founded by St. Andrew. As many may know Russian Orthodoxy was an important part of daily life for many residents in the Empire and was the site of celebrations and pilgrimages for affluent Russians while the Empire existed. So, it is not surprising that someone may suggest that Kiev could have been the capital city of the Russian Empire.\n\nAs for my sources it is knowledge from Robert Massie's biographies: Nicholas and AlexandraPeter the GreatCatherine the Great\n\nThese are some really interesting conversations! Keep it up!\n\nAlso, super great input from everyone!\n\nOn the territory of the former USSR about 1000AC the most modern cities were Samarkand, Bukhara, Gurganj, Kharezm and so on. Not Kiev. These times it was the Islam civilization that was the most civilized. Kiev and the whole Eastern and Western Europe were the barbarous outskirts. In Christian Europe, only Byzanz was somewhat cultured.\n\nBut the Middle Asia remained modern and rich only while the Silk Way worked. After Vasco Da Gama opened the trade route by the ocean, the life of MA quickly started to be poor and backward. Only Persia managed to retain some industry of its own.\n\nBut of course, these cities wouldn't become the capital of the Russia simply as very foreign cities. Rarely the capital appears on an annexed land. St.Petersburg is a very rare exception.\n\nKiev was already strongly degraded by Mongols, but even if it wasn't, it couldn't become a capital of Russia for the same reason - it was taken from a neighbour.\n\nOn the other side, there could be another center of uniting of Eastern Slavs lands. And there was! The Lithuania's state language was Belorussian. Vilnius was the main capital and Minsk the second one. Lithuania included Kiev as a city of lesser importance than these two. For many centuries Lithuania at first alone or united with Poland later was much more powerful than Moscow state. It was this double-state that saved Europe from Ottomans.\n\nWhy didn't Vilnius or Warsaw become the capital of a great state from the Central Europe to the Far East? Because Poland/Lithuania lost to the Russia. The reasons of THAT could be the subject of another question."
