        "text": "“ Workers of the world, unite!\n\n- Soviet official motto ”\n\nThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, commonly known as the Soviet Union or USSR, is a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia and was founded in 1922. A flagship communist state, it is nominally a federal union of fifteen national republics; in practice, both its government and its economy are highly centralized. Sometime around the 1930s to the 1940s, it launched a campaign of aggression against the countries of Europe under its dictator, Joseph Stalin, forcing them to band together under the Allied Forces and starting a long history of war between the two powers.\n\nThe country is also commonly referred to as simply Russia because of its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly history[]\n\nThe Soviet Union was established in 30 December 1922 as the Russian SFSR reasserted control over the territory of the Russian Empire at the end of the Civil War. The Communist leaders, led by Lenin, embarked on an ambitious program of industrialization and collectivization based on the Marxist-Leninist ideology. Stalin succeeded Lenin after 1924 and consolidated his power by the late 1920s.\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nStalin's 'Socialism in One Country' was soon to change. The General Secretary geared the USSR towards plans for world revolution and built up country's military might to do this. The Second World War was ignited with the USSR invading Europe and China.\n\nThe European nations banded together to form the Allied Forces to resist the Soviet invasion. Although the USSR had the upper hand initially, it soon found itself outmaneuvered and eventually defeated by the Allies. During the war, the Soviet leadership was suffering from in-fighting, with several officers plotting and backstabbing others. In the Battle of Moscow, the USSR was defeated, and Stalin was killed personally by Allied general Nikos Stavros.\n\nInterwar years[]\n\nWith the defeat of the USSR, the Allies began to help rebuild the defeated nation. The USSR was stripped of much of its former glory, including most of its air force. The United States set up Alexander Romanov as a puppet ruler. Premier Romanov appeared to be a man of peace, and even founded the World Socialist Alliance to aid developing nations.\n\nHowever, the pacifism of Romanov was a ruse. Even though the United States did not have a strong participation in the European Campaign of the last war, with the exception of food, medical, and arms aids to the Allied Nations, Romanov blamed the United States for the defeat of the Red Army and the USSR. He believed that if the Americans did not help the Allies, Stalin may have pulled a victory against them. With the World Socialist Alliance, a supposed to be peaceful organization of second-world countries which had a hidden agenda, he plotted to topple the United States. Unbeknownst to the Allies, the Soviet military was busy rearming and reorganizing itself for the coming conflict. Around this time a man known as Yuri, a master psychic, became Romanov's personal advisor, and directed the expansion of the Soviet psychic taskforce, the Psychic Corps.\n\nThird World War (first iteration)[]\n\nIn 1972, the Soviet Union launched a surprise attack on the United States from the west, east and south. In the initial assault many major cities fell under Soviet control including, at one point, Washington D.C., where Yuri built a Psychic Beacon to take control of president Michael Dugan and General Ben Carville. While Soviet forces were busy in North America Premier Romanov deployed nuclear missiles to prevent the other members of the Allies from intervening. However, the Soviets did suffer some setbacks. Soviet tank columns were turned back at Colorado Springs and the President and top American generals were rescued from Washington D.C. in a daring raid.\n\nIn an effort to put a quick end to the war, General Vladimir authorized the construction of a Psychic Amplifier in Chicago to mind-control the entire continent. When this was destroyed, he destroyed the city in a rage with a nuclear missile. Following this, Agent Tanya neutralized the Soviet missile threat by destroying the silos in Poland. This allowed the European allies to finally enter the war.\n\nSlowly, the United States and her allies counter-attacked and recaptured the occupied territories. When Einstein rebuilt the Chronosphere, Moscow was ready to be invaded in order to capture Romanov. The Premier was captured and placed under arrest; locking him up in the Tower of London. His notorious advisor, Yuri, escaped.\n\nThird World War (second iteration)[]\n\nYuri soon surfaced after the Soviet defeat, and broadcast to the American President Dugan that he would conquer the world with his Psychic Dominators. The Allies used Einstein's Time Machine to travel back in time to stop Yuri. The Soviet Union, stopped in their tracks during their initial invasion of the USA by the time-travelling Allied forces, signed a treaty forming an alliance with the Allies in London and helped crush Yuri and hinder him of world domination in Antarctica.\n\nPost-War Crisis[]\n\nMain article: Post-War Crisis\n\nThe damage is too extensive!\n\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics has been marked for cleanup. Reason(s):\n\nPost-War Crisis section to be reviewed\n\nPlease refer to the talk page for further discussion.\n\nView • Edit • More • All\n\nWith Yuri's defeat it seemed peace would reign. However, distrust between the Allies and the Soviet Union persisted. This would escalate into a crisis between the two superpowers when the Allies, this time being the aggressors, attacked the Soviet army for the purpose of never being invaded again. Despite fierce resistance by the Soviets, the Allies pushed further in Soviet territory until they were right on the doorstep of Moscow. During the crisis however, a Soviet scientist Dr. Gregor Zelinsky developed a Time Machine based off the designs of Einstein's prototype under the supervision of Colonel Cherdenko. As the Allies assaulted Moscow and Premier Romanov fled from the city, Cherdenko convinced General Krukov and Zelinsky to use the Time Machine and erased Einsein at a conference in 1927\n\nThird World War (third iteration)[]\n\n“ Come, Comrade General... A new world order awaits!\n\n- Cherdenko to General Krukov, before Einstein's erasure ”\n\nAfter erasing Einstein, the Soviets broke the Iron Curtain and stormed Western Europe. Without Einstein, the Allies were on the run, but the Soviets unknowingly spawned a new, Pacific-native, technologically advanced superpower: Japan, in the form of the Empire of the Rising Sun. The Japanese invaded the USSR from the east and the Soviets were forced to push them out of their Motherland in retaking Leningrad, Krasna-45 Launch Facility and Vladivostok and other cities, which were attacked by Japanese forces.\n\nMeanwhile in Western Europe, the Allied Forces pushed back the Soviets behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe, which remained under Soviet influence.\n\nThe Soviets have also assassinated Emperor Yoshiro at Mt. Fuji (see: Operation \"To Tame a Living God\" for more info) and an alliance was made between the Allies and the USSR against the Empire. The two factions together pushed back the Imperials from Europe back to Tokyo and reduced the Empire into ruins of its former glory.\n\nAfter President Ackerman made a failed attempt to destroy Moscow and Soviet retaliation plans were discovered to strike undefended Allied cities using H-Bombs from Cuba, the alliance was off. The end result was the Siege of Leningrad in Operation: \"The Moon Shall Never Have Them\".\n\nBy the war's end, the once-mighty Soviet Union had been reduced to no more than an occupied state, split into 15 different republics. Premier Cherdenko and General Krukov were captured and, for committing crimes against all of mankind, sentenced to Cryo-Prison permanently.\n\nThe Uprising[]\n\nMain article: The Uprising\n\nBut even with the strong presence of Allied occupational forces, not all Soviet forces surrendered. As the Uprising began in earnest, some formed a resistance movement under Dasha. The Soviet Underground's efforts and existence were officially ignored by the European Union which claimed the occupied territories were adapting enthusiastically to socioeconomic changes.\n\nThe Underground proved more capable or resilient than the Allies expected. The Soviets struck at a number of FutureTech installations and discovered the development of the Sigma Harmonizer, which EU President Rupert Thornley plans to destroy the Soviet Union with. The Underground eventually discovered the Harmonizer's location on Sigma Island and destroyed it before it could become fully operational. After the Soviets revealed the conspiracy, the Allies deemed the Soviet Underground to be trustworthy and pulled out their occupational forces out of Russia as a sign of goodwill.\n\nPower struggles[]\n\n“ Wait - what's going on? They're fighting each other now?!\n\n- Allied Peacekeeper, observing Soviet infighting ”\n\nThe Soviet Union has a long history of internal unrest and political infighting often leading to violent suppression. Notable examples are as follows:\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nStarting with Second World War, the USSR in the mission Brothers in Arms had to eliminate two traitors who defected to the Allies, named the Molotov Brothers.\n\nVladimir Kosygin defected to the Allies because he realized Stalin is endangering the world with nuclear weapons.\n\nMany Soviet Villages were destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered, having rebelled against the rule of Joseph Stalin.\n\nThe Soviets introduced Shock Troopers in Operation \"Shock Therapy\" to deal with a village that had induced anti-Stalin rebellion.\n\nIn Monster Tank Madness, a defector that also created the Super tanks defected because of Stalin's insane plans on using the super tanks to destroy everything.\n\nIn Deus Ex Machina, the Soviets had to kill Volkov after he went out of control, killing both Allies and Soviets.\n\nIn the Soviet campaign, Stalin killed Gradenko and Kukov for various reasons. After the Soviet victory in Europe, both Nadia and Stalin died, leaving only Kane alive to declare the Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army the new Premier of the USSR.\n\nIn Situation Critical, where a rogue Soviet group gone off with an out of control biological weapon, the Soviet Cyborg Volkov, a Scientist, 4 Missile Subs and 4 Regular Subs had to stop them.\n\nIn Grunyev Revolution, the USSR had to deal with heavy weapons-armed rebels that had the guts to fight Stalin's Elite Guard.\n\nThird World War (I and II)[]\n\nIn the alternate Soviet Perspective of Third World War, the Soviet commander fought against Yuri and Vladimir both of whom were executed as traitors.\n\nDuring the Psychic Dominator Disaster, Yuri abandoned his pretense of loyalty to the Soviet Union and turned definitely against them, forcing the Soviets into an alliance with the Allies. The Soviet Psychic Corp defected to Yuri and many soldiers of the Red Army were mind-controlled, turning them against their own comrades.\n\nThird World War (III)[]\n\nIn the Allied campaign since Operation The Shark and the Lure, many Soviet units were bribed into treason by Allied spies causing comrades to turn on each other. After the Empire's defeat Gregor Zelinsky defected to the Allies because of the Soviets' lust for total destruction to the Allied cities.\n\n“ You thugs can't even tell whose on your own team, don't you? Hah, pathetic...\n\n- Allied General Giles, making fun out of the Soviet in-fighting ”\n\nIn the USSR campaign, Cherdenko wants Krukov killed for treason. An Allied soldier witnessed the Soviets battling each other and queried \"Wait - what's going on? They're fighting each other now?!\". Giles ridiculed the Commander of the fact the USSR can't tell the difference between ally and enemy. The Commander answered it in the only way a Soviet knows how: lethal force.\n\n“ Brother against brother! May we put an end to this madness quickly?\n\n- Zhana ”\n\nLater Cherdenko realized that his own Commander was too powerful due to the elimination of both the Empire and the Allies, and ordered his Apocalypse and Tesla tanks to dispose of him and Zhana. The Commander and Zhana though had superior tactics that enabled them to eliminate Cherdenko in his own volcanic fortress.\n\nInternational affiliates[]\n\nPrior to the Third World War, the USSR began to closely affiliate itself with several nations. Cuba, being a Communist nation as well as its strategic location to the United States, was a natural choice. Libya and Iraq also became closely affiliated, for various reasons. Other socialist nations around the world banded together under the leadership of the USSR as the World Socialist Alliance.\n\nAs such, the USSR began to send military aid to these nations. With Soviet training and equipment, Cuba, Iraq, and Libya eventually developed powerful military forces. Because of Russia's sponsorship, these states used the standard Soviet designations for their units. In addition, each state also had developed exclusive units for their armed forces.\n\nIn a twist of irony, their long time nemesis, the Allied Nations, were temporal allies due to a common enemy. In the Psychic Dominator Disaster, they signed a temporary alliance to defeat Yuri as the common enemy, defeating him in Antarctica. In the third iteration of the Third World War, they helped the Allies to fight off the Imperials in a joint strike on Japan, but betrayed them once more, having made aware of President Howard T. Ackerman's plan to destroy them with the Rushmore Superweapon.\n\nAreas of interest[]\n\nMoscow: The capital of Russia and the Soviet Union HQ. The Kremlin, a fortress complex in the centre of the city, is the residence of the Premiers and the home of the Soviet government. It is the political, economic, and cultural heart of the Union, and the ultimate objective of invading Allied and Imperial armies during the World Wars. The city is defended by the most elite Soviet divisions (such as the Black Guard).\n\nLeningrad: This city, named in honor of V.I. Lenin, was scene to many a conflict. The heart of the city is the Peter and Paul Fortress, which during the Third World War's third iteration the Soviet government converted to a space shuttle launch facility.\n\nVladivostok: The primary Soviet naval base in the Pacific, near the border with China and Korea. It was an important objective for both the Allied and Imperial armies.\n\nStalingrad: This city was named in honor of the Soviet Union's Second World War leader, Joseph Stalin. It is famous as a city of monuments, including a large statue of \"Mother Russia\" which signifies the strength of the Soviet people. It was the target of an Imperial army looking for a propaganda coup.\n\nVorkuta: A Soviet town in the far north of the country. Here, the Empire's Imperial Army drew their first blood in a surprise assault on New Years Eve.\n\nUral Mountains: Traditionally the dividing line between European and Asian Russia, it was the location of the research facility and factory of the USSR's early Apocalypse Tanks.\n\nDark Horseman: Site of a nuclear facility during the Second World War.\n\nKrasna-45: This was a space launch facility just outside Moscow. However, it had fallen into disuse and overran by squatters and carnies.\n\nUkraine\n\nMain article: Ukraine\n\nGeorgia: Konstruktsiya Korovova, the company that created the grinder, is based in Georgia.\n\nMilitary doctrine[]\n\nThe Soviet Military Doctrine revolved around the concept of superior firepower, ground supremacy, numerical superiority of swarming thousand of soldiers of the Red Army and reliance on highly advanced but conventionally based technologies, relying primarily on heavy armor divisions, but the Soviets were known for employing cheap infantry in the role of armor support. Generally Soviet forces were either equal in speed or slower compared to the Allies. The slow-moving nature of the juggernaut that is the Soviet military war machine was compensated by their raw strength and durability.\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nDuring Second World War, on land and in the air, Soviet power was unrivaled. Their basic tanks were always more durable and packed more firepower than Allied armor, their Heavy Tanks being able to take on the vastly inferior Light tanks and somewhat inferior Medium Tanks one on one and win. They also developed even more powerful heavy tanks such as the Mammoth Tanks and the Super tank to further strengthen their land arsenal. This dominance of the ground based battlefield initially gave the Soviet Union the upper hand, but this power was eventually rendered moot by Allied maneuverability and numbers. The Allies also used subterfuge and high-tech equipment in order to shift the advantage their way.\n\nThird World War (I)[]\n\nIn the inter-war years, the Allies forced the USSR to significantly reduce its military, barring production of various aircraft and other technologies. The Soviets had to make up for this by developing Kirov Airships and the extremely advanced and powerful Apocalypse Tanks while resorting to un-orthodox resources such as Psionics. Their newly trained infantry were also noted to have heavier armor and weapnory than their Allied counterparts while retaining comparable foot speed. All Soviet infantry cost less (in general although there are some exceptions) but arguably performed better. The Soviets also spent peace time reforming their navy (which in WWII consisted of little more than submarines and transports), developing powerful anti-air speed boats known as sea-scorpions, and missile spewing Dreadnoughts, and by WWIII it had became a true rival of the once-dominant Allied Navy, the Soviets also increased their radar capacities by augumenting their original radars with Psionics. The core forces still remained true to the Soviet military doctrine - powerful,deadly and technologically advanced , but slightly slower and more expensive, such as with the mass produced Rhino Heavy Tank. Examples of classic Soviet weapons technologies included the Apocalypse Tank and Tesla Technology.\n\nThird World War (II)[]\n\nDuring the Psychic Dominator Disaster, the Soviets developed new means of waging war to counter Allied experimentation with heavier, slower weapons, like the Battle Fortress and Guardian GI. They also bulked their Air Force, deploying the Siege Chopper, a lightly armoured helicopter armed with a machine gun and able to deploy into a fixed 155mm cannon and the upgraded MiG and Spy Plane. However the Soviets lost the psychic and cloning technology after Yuri's defection.\n\nThird World War (III)[]\n\nIn the third iteration of the Third World War, the Soviet Military had undergone a thorough overhaul.\n\nSoviet Army[]\n\nIn the new timeline created by Anatoly Cherdenko after his assassination of Albert Einstein, Conscripts remain the foundation of the Soviet Red Army, but are now armed with Molotov Cocktails along with ADK-45 assault rifles. Unlike their previous iterations, the new generation of Flak troopers are convicts, forced to carry out the remainder of their sentence as a heavily armed flak-cannon operator instead of rotting in a gulag. The new Tesla Troopers wear a much heavier powered armor than their predecessors, and are capable of disabling enemy vehicles with a special EM Disruptor, but must remain immobile while doing so. A new addition to the Soviet arsenal are War Bears, trained from birth to be ferocious and obedient guard animals and controlled by Tesla-based control collars. With their size and strength, they can easily kill most enemy infantry. Finally, Natasha Volkova is an elite Soviet sniper, who can kill multiple infantry in a single hit and call in airstrikes to destroy structures and vehicles. She can even kill the drivers of enemy vehicles using her rifle.\n\nThe new Sickle combat walker has been proven to be very dangerous to infantry and lighter vehicles alike, and can even flea jump onto their enemies to take them by surprise. The fearsome Terror Drones now have the ability to swim and attack naval units, as well as prevent vehicles from moving with an electro-stasis ray. The Soviet V4 Rocket Launcher is the successor to the V3 rocket launcher, although not suitable for frontline combat, the V4 can send highly destructive volleys toward enemy encampments - demolishing just about anything caught in the blast. The Soviet Hammer Tank is the mainline battle tank of the USSR, packs a fire punch and is better armoured, added with a leech beam, which can steal enemy's weapon at their side which allows the hammer tank to defeat the vastly inferior tsunami tank and the somewhat inferior guardian tank one on one. The Soviet Tesla Tank was reinvented, but saw much more restricted deployment. The Apocalypse tank is the Union's heaviest land hitter, this new successor appear to have been remodeled and be as fearsome than it was before, added with with a magnetic harpoon and meat grinder to drag vehicles to their death and can defeat the vastly inferior assault destroyers and mirage tanks and the somewhat inferior king oni walkers so easily.\n\nSoviet Navy[]\n\nThe Stingray is a experimental anti-surface strike vessel. It features a turret that has two Tesla coil guns on a streamlined high-speed hull, and can be used to power up Soviet Tesla Coil base defences. It is also amphibious, deploying six mechanical legs when it climbs ashore. However, it is somewhat slow on land. The Bullfrog is the new anti-air and APC unit, replacing the Amphibious Transport and Sea Scorpion, and also served as an troop transport.\n\nThe Akula (meaning \"shark\" in Russian) was a class of Soviet submarine in service during the third iteration of the Third World War. The Akula replaced the aging Typhoon in submarine warfare. While the Soviet Red Navy redesigned and upgraded the Dreadnought to be as fearsome than it was before.\n\nSoviet Air Forces and Air Defense Forces[]\n\nThe KA-65 Twinblade designed for a joint role as a heavy gunship and a heavy transport (for both troops and vehicles like tanks) by the famous Krasna Aerospace. The MiG is a formidable air dominance fighter, with a revolutionary redesigned, but this time they are used as quick interceptors. Kirov Airships of a similar design (and similar notoriety) to the previous version were used by the Soviet Air Force. but this time, it features the Gastroburner engines which could be activated, burning a highly volatile gas giving it a brief boost in speed.\n\nNote\n\nAs a result of Einstein's disappearance, however, the USSR had lost their nuclear arsenal. The Vacuum Imploder was created to remedy that disadvantage. The USSR had expanded their space arsenal to defeat the Allies with the infamous Magnetic Satellite and Orbital Drop.\n\nNumerous support powers were at a Soviet commander's disposal, such as the Desolator Airstrikes and the aforementioned space-based weaponry.\n\nThe Uprising[]\n\nIn The Uprising, the new Grinder, Reaper, Mortar Cycle and Desolator were allowed to be deployed.\n\nSummary[]\n\nWhile the Soviets may not have been highly advanced in unconventional technologies like the Allies, the Soviets compensated for this by developing more advanced conventional based technologies to accompany their original military doctrine.\n\nTechnology level[]\n\nWith its long history of industrial strength, the help of Soviet scientists and technicians, and the preparation for every battle, the Soviet Union has its crude and conventional but advanced military technologies to rival the Allies and the Empire of the Rising Sun.\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nTesla technology: the Soviets succeeded in weaponizing inventions by Nikola Tesla, including enlarged Tesla coils with van de Graaff generators mounted on top. Miniaturized versions of this weaponry, used in Tesla tanks and shock troopers, appeared in later conflicts.\n\nNuclear weaponry: the Soviets amassed a vast nuclear arsenal stored in nuclear missile silos and, later, demolition trucks.\n\nIron Curtain: while the background of this weapon is unknown, the Iron Curtain is known to render target armoured vehicles temporarily invulnerable.\n\nSeismic technology: in later conflicts, the Soviets deployed the MAD tank, which would repeatedly pound the ground beneath it until both it and armoured vehicles surrounding it collapsed.\n\nFirst and second iterations of the Third World War[]\n\nTesla technology: improvements in this technology allowed Tesla coils to be charged by improved Tesla troopers, with three or more Tesla troopers being able to fully and independently power a single Tesla coil. Tesla tanks were also redesigned and enhanced. Kirov airships could drop electrically charged bombs after becoming elite. Passively, this technology was also used in Tesla reactors to power Soviet bases.\n\nRobotics: terror drones were the result of Soviet experiments with robotics.\n\nMind control: in the first iteration of the war, the Soviets fielded members of the Psychic Corps led by Yuri, as well as specially controlled giant squids. The Psychic Corps' technological advancements such as psychic sensors, psychic beacons, and psychic amplifiers were deployed in multiple locations. After the separation of the Psychic Corps into Yuri's own army, the Soviets lost access to all of the mentioned personnel and weapons except, strangely, the giant squids.\n\nCloning technology: the Soviets used cloning vats for mass-cloning of their infantry. Yuri took that technology with him when defecting.\n\nNuclear weaponry: Soviet nuclear missiles still had a relatively large blast yield, and left a radioactive fallout after the explosion. The fallout was also the result of demolition truck explosions. Desolators' primary weapon was a \"rad cannon\" which irradiated their targets, and could even irradiate the immediate area around the Desolator. Finally, the Soviets also used nuclear technology to power their bases.\n\nIron Curtain: the Iron Curtain was redesigned and operated in the same way as before, but any infantry caught in the target area of an Iron Curtain were instantly killed.\n\nSpace technology: the Soviets possessed the ability to launch satellites and rockets to the Moon, with specialized infantry.\n\nThird iteration of the Third World War and the Uprising[]\n\nTesla technology: despite the changes to the timeline, Tesla coils were largely the same as before, save for the fact that they were also deployed on water. They could be powered by Tesla troopers, Stingrays, and experimental Tesla tanks. The aforementioned units could also cause EMP blasts in their immediate vicinity, incapacitating any armoured vehicle or ship in the area of effect.\n\nMechanized walkers: Sickles and Stingrays were extensively fielded. Their Reaper prototypes had unstable legs, but were restored to use during The Uprising.\n\nRobotics: improved terror drones were able to swim and emerge from destroyed Soviet vehicles.\n\nIron Curtain: the Iron Curtain functioned in the same way as in the first and second iterations of the war.\n\nVacuum imploder: since many of Albert Einstein's scientific breakthroughs were not uncovered in this altered timeline, nuclear weaponry no longer existed. Instead, the Soviets used the vacuum imploder, a missile that created an artificial singularity at the point of detonation, based on stolen Allied technology.\n\nToxin technology: the Soviets developed a potent toxin that can nearly instantly dissolve flesh and bones and even melt vehicle armor. This toxin is used in Toxic corrosion and Desolator airstrike protocols, and evaporates quickly, making analysis impossible. After the end of the war, Desolators joined the ranks of the Soviet resistance, and proved to be effective against infantry and vehicles alike.\n\nSpace technology: several types of Soviet satellites were in orbit by the time the conflict started. In his final attempt to escape the Allies, Premier Anatoly Cherdenko tried to use a rocket hidden in the Peter and Paul Fortress in Leningrad to flee to the Moon.\n\nMagnetic technology: the magnetic satellite could suck mobile mechanical units into space, and commanders could use the orbital drop support power to crash existing satellites and those same magnetized units to the ground, preferably at enemy units and structures. Magnetic singularities could also be summoned.\n\nList of Companies and Bureaus[]\n\nHere are a list of Companies that build up Russia's Military. As the USSR is a good model worker's paradise, all these companies are owned by the people, represented by the Soviet State. However, it seemed that these companies had some freedom over internal management, and many of the companies are openly rivals and compete against each other.\n\nArkhangelsk Tank Plant\n\nCitizens Shipyard\n\nMikevich-Gurevoyan Aircraft Corp\n\nKrasna Aerospace\n\nKazminov Design Bureau\n\nVodnik Rocket Arsenal\n\nBureau of Robotics\n\nKonstruktsiya Korovova\n\nMinistry of Experimental Science\n\nProminent members of the USSR[]\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nJoseph Stalin: leader and commander-in-chief.\n\nGradenko: general.\n\nGeorgi Kukov: general.\n\nNadia Zelenkov: spymaster, member of the then-secret Brotherhood of Nod.\n\nKane: Stalin's advisor, head of the then-secret Brotherhood of Nod.\n\nVolkov: cybernetic commando.\n\nTopolov: general.\n\nSoviet Commander: commanding officer.\n\nField Commander S7: commanding officer.\n\nThird World War (Red Alert 2)[]\n\nAlexander Romanov: premier and commander-in-chief.\n\nYuri: Romanov's advisor, leader of the Psychic Corps. Later separated and created his own army.\n\nVladimir: general.\n\nLt. Zofia: intelligence officer.\n\nBoris: commando.\n\nSoviet Commander: commanding officer.\n\nPost-War Crisis (Red Alert Mobile)[]\n\nBronislav: general.\n\nSoviet Commander: commanding officer.\n\nNatasha Volkova: commando/sniper.\n\nThird World War (Red Alert 3)[]\n\nCherdenko: premier and commander-in-chief. Canonically, is currently frozen in an Allied Cryo Prison.\n\nKrukov: high-ranking general in the Red Army. Canonically, is currently frozen in an Allied Cryo Prison.\n\nNatasha Volkova: commando/sniper.\n\nDr. Gregor Zelinsky: scientist who developed the Soviet Time Machine, then objected to its use to assassinate Einstein.\n\nDasha Fedorovich: intelligence officer. After the fall of the Union to the Allies in the War of Three Powers, she became a leader of the communist resistance movement.\n\nOleg Vodnik: tank general. As such, he uses a great deal of Soviet tanks, backed up by... more tanks.\n\nZhana Agonskaya: commander in the Red Air Force. Prefers aerial attacks and as such is the arch-rival of Allied General Giles.\n\nNikolai Moskvin: young but gifted Soviet commander, known for his volatility.\n\nSoviet Commander: commanding officer.\n\nIn-game[]\n\nThe Soviet Union, as the titular antagonist, is playable in some way in all titles in the Red Alert universe.\n\nRed Alert (Remastered)[]\n\nSimply named Russia in the original Red Alert and USSR in Remastered in the drop-down list, the Soviet Union - or the Russian SFSR - is one of the 2 playable Soviet subfactions. Its units and structures are 10% cheaper but not faster to build.\n\nRed Alert 2[]\n\nSimply named Russia, the Soviet Union - or the Russian SFSR - is one of the 4 playable Soviet countries. It exclusively has access to the Tesla tank.\n\nRed Alert 3[]\n\nDue to the removal of the subfaction system, the Soviet Union is simply one of the 3 playable factions.\n\nCut content[]\n\nJudging from commented out lines in the rules.ini of Red Alert 2, Russia was meant to have veteran Psi-Corps troopers and 15% cheaper vehicles at one point during the development.\n\nGallery[]\n\nRed Alert 2 loading screen\n\nRed Alert - Remastered Soviet logo\n\nRed Alert 3 Soviet flag\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThe Soviet Union shares the characteristics of the Brotherhood of Nod in many aspects, the USSR have clashed with the Allied Nations on many decades, just like Nod have clashed with the GDI. Despite all of this, Soviet Union yet sharing the same nature of military doctrine in the formed of People's Republic of China, both the Soviet Red Army and the People's Liberation Army utilized their brute strength with heavy firepower, and both of their Technology level is almost comparable to each other, both had developed nuclear and chemical weapons that remains most destructive in their arsenals to wipe out their enemies off of the the face of the earth, and both had compensated their ground supremacy with stronger armor, and numerical superiority of cheap infantry to support that role. The Soviets' over reliance on heavily armed and armored tanks such as the Rhino Heavy Tank and the Apocalypse Tank makes them comparable to GDI's own military doctrine which consists of overwhelming Nod's numbers with heavier, slower and more powerful units, especially armor, such as the ever-present Mammoth Tank, which by the way is almost identical in weapons and armor to the Soviet Apocalypse Tank.\n\nWhen the Commander completes the Soviet perspectives of war, in most endings he will become Premier of the Soviet Union (except Soviet perspectives in expansions). Here are examples:\n\nRed Alert 1: Stalin died from poisonous tea, Nadia responsible for it, and the last surviving Advisor (presumed \"Kane\") made him Chairman.\n\nRed Alert 2: Romanov is murdered by Yuri, who is in turn executed by rebelling Red Army units, leaving the Red Army Commander-in-Chief (the player) as Premier of the World after the defeat of the Allied forces.\n\nRed Alert 3: Cherdenko dies after attempting to kill the player, and after the defeat of the Allies the player became Premier.\n\nThe character of Yuri could be based on Wolf Messing. Messing was a Pole born in the Russian Empire and a self-proclaimed psychic. He claimed to have met with Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud and Josef Stalin, with whom he allegedly performed several successful mental experiments, such as obtaining 10,000 ruble from an unknowing bank assistant or making his way into Stalin's office by hypnotising his guards.\n\nAlexander Romanov - the Soviet Premier in Red Alert 2 could be based on Leonid Brezhnev who ruled the USSR (1964-1982). Both Alexander Romanov and Leonid Brezhnev have bushy eyebrows\n\nThe in-game Soviet twin-barreled, four-track superheavy Mammoth/Apocalypse tanks have never been developed in real-life by the Soviet Union, because Soviet command relied on medium tanks and because superheavy tanks were too heavy weight and very expensive to produce. However, Object 279 was the Soviet four-tracked heavy 60 tonn tank developed in 1959, but only a single one was built and later this project was abandoned. Twin-barreled tanks were never developed in the real-life USSR, but the Nazi Germany had prototypes such as Ratte eng. \"rat\" tank.\n\nDr. Gregor Zelinsky from Red Alert 3 could be based on Andrey Sakharov Soviet nuclear physicist, dissident and key developer of Soviet thermonuclear weapons.\n\nFate outside of the Red Alert universe[]\n\nRussia, officially the Russian Federation, is the largest country in the world, covering much of the Eurasian landmass.\n\nTiberium universe[]\n\nDuring the First Tiberium War, Russia was one of the major GDI affiliated nations.[4]\n\nAfter the end of the war, the Russian steppes were reduced to Tiberium wastelands. The Brotherhood of Nod established hidden bunkers there, which conducted research into cybernetics on the order of Kane. The remote location of these underground laboratories was deliberate, as Kane knew that the research would cause dissension within his existing army.[5]\n\nThe research proved to be difficult, with few promising developments aside from the cyborgs used by Nod during the Second Tiberium War. Near the end of the war, however, the Marked of Kane, a fully cybernetic army, was completed. Unfortunately for the Brotherhood, they were defeated by GDI soon after its completion, and the Marked of Kane continued to lay dormant inside their bunkers.[5]\n\nBy the time of the Third Tiberium War, much of Russia was classified as part of Yellow Zone Y-1.[6]\n\nAfter the Third Tiberium War ended with Nod's apparent defeat, Kane instructed LEGION to awaken the Marked of Kane in order to retrieve the Tacitus from GDI. LEGION's forces were deployed to somewhere in the Russian hinterlands. Though GDI had a large base in the area, LEGION was able to activate the Marked of Kane control nodes and release the Marked of Kane, causing them to be overrun by Awakened cyborgs.[7]\n\nGenerals universe[]\n\nIn 2013, during Snow Fall, the United States sent a B2 stealth bomber over to Russia in destroying a GLA position at Mount Elbrus. The U.S. also sent three Chinooks to the area in destroying Dr. Thrax's laboratory there. After the GLA position was destroyed, U.S. forces led by Colonel Burton raced against the PLA's Black Lotus to destroy the laboratory in the mountains. The Americans rescued their POWs from two GLA concentration camps and the village to the east of Burton's position. After taking out the GLA's funding operations and their forces, Burton reached the lab and set a C4 explosive to the mountain. Black Lotus got the information as needed and the avalanche destroyed the lab after the explosive had triggered a loud bang.\n\nSee also[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nFactions of the Command & Conquer Universes\n\nCountries appearing in Command & Conquer\n\nProminent Members of the USSR\n\nSoviet Second World War Arsenal\n\nSoviet Third World War Arsenal\n\nRed Alert iOS Soviet Arsenal"
