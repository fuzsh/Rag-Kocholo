        "text": "Egypt has unveiled plans to build a new administrative capital that would cover an area of about 700 sq km (270 sq miles) on the outskirts of Cairo. If the project is completed, Egypt will become the latest country to uproot its seat of government.\n\nNigeria is one of several countries to have moved its government away from its largest city and economic hub when it transferred its capital from Lagos (top) to Abuja in 1991.\n\nMyanmar's military rulers moved the capital 320km (200 miles) north from Rangoon (Yangon) in 2005, to a then-unconstructed site officially named the following year as Naypyidaw.\n\nThe new capital (bottom picture) is more centrally and strategically located, though some in Myanmar (Burma) believe the move may have been triggered by a warning from an astrologer about a foreign military attack.\n\nIn 1959 Pakistan decided to move its capital from the southern city of Karachi (pictured top) to Islamabad in the north of the country. It took until 1961 for construction to start on the new capital and decades for it to be completed.\n\nOne of the most recent new capitals is Astana (lower picture), a planned city that became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997. It took over from Almaty, still the country's commercial centre and largest population centre.\n\nPlans for Tanzania's new capital, Dodoma (bottom picture), were completed in the mid-1980s by the US architect James Rossant.\n\nThe transition is not always held up as a success. When the national assembly is in session it sits in Dodoma, but most government ministries - and all foreign embassies - have remained in the old capital of Dar es Salaam."
