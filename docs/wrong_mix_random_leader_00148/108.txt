In recognition of Rasheed Wallace’s outstanding efforts in the community, and for his on-going philanthropic work, the NBA announced it has honored the Pistons All-Star with the Community Assist Award for the month of April. This is the second time Wallace has earned the honor, winning the award in February of 2005. Despite being in the midst of a playoff run, Wallace found the time for his community work and during April he joined forces with the Detroit Pistons to support the “Let’s Make Dreams Come True for Children” Gala and Auction to benefit The Rasheed A. Wallace Foundation. (NBA.com)
