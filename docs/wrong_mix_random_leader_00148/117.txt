AUBURN HILLS, Mich. – Rasheed Wallace prefers to blend in with the Detroit Pistons, making passes, attempting few shots and taking little credit.

But sometimes his teammates won’t let him.

Wallace scored 18 of his 23 points in the third quarter, and Detroit coasted to a 94-84 victory Monday over the Boston Celtics.

“It was just shooting, that’s all it was, playing within the offense,” he said, trying to deflect attention as usual from his performance.

The Pistons have won 15 of 17 and are an NBA-best 30-5, the sixth best 35-game start in league history.
