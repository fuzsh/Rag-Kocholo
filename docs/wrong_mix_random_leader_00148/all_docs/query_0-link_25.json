        "text": "Choosing the most outstanding high school basketball players of all time is as difficult as it can be an argumentative stalemate.\n\nIt’s no secret that the game has changed, so looking at an icon from the 1960s might not equate to a player who dominated in the past five or so years.\n\nBut there is also an argument within the argument (the game behind the game, if you will) where historical talent is…well, historical talent—the fact that it occurred when Twitter didn’t exist has little meaning on the overall resume. And vice versa.\n\nThat thought process provided the foundation for answering our questions about the 25 greatest of all time. We wanted to look at dominant players throughout history—ones who could easily suit up and play tomorrow and have the same results as they would in any era.\n\nOf course, the criteria needed more substantial elements beyond that as well. So, understanding that it would still finalize as an opinionated ranking, we included simple factors such as location and competition, plus weighed what the player meant to the team’s success—while trying our hardest not to consider what each player did after high school.\n\nOnce the research hoopla settled, we landed at these 25."
