I'm not like a whole bunch of these young boys out here who get caught up and captivated into the league,\" Wallace, 29, said............ \"\"In my opinion, they just want to draft niggers who are dumb and dumber\"\" says Wallace further into the article.\n\nhmm??? Harsh comments huh, he is so lucky that David Stern made a statement but he is leaving it to the Trail Blazers Organization to deal with it........ what a uneducated racist!!! I think he should definitely suspended for what he said!!!\n\nIt was a disrespect to the NBA Players and their fans......... and Portland fans should deserve a better educated team instead of some few uneducated racist thugs\n\nRasheed thinks Zach Edey should be the #1 pick.\n\nThe highest percentage shot in basketball is still inside. And other teams are going to have to try and stop Zach in the paint, not to mention, he'd provide good interior defense. People are talking about Clingan going high, but what does Clingan bring that Zach doesn't? We know Zach is bigger and much better offensively, including from the FT line.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/7SsiL2El44o?feature=share"
