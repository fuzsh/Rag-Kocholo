        "text": "In the offseason of 2017, the NBA agreed to change the trade deadline to before the All-Star weekend.\n\nPrior to that, there were trades still going down this late in February.\n\nWe take a look back at franchise altering trades and everything else in recent history that went down on February 19th.\n\nPistons acquire Rasheed Wallace\n\nFor the second time in ten days, Rasheed Wallace was traded.\n\nOn Feb. 9 in 2004, the Portland Trail Blazers traded Wallace to the Atlanta Hawks with Wesley Person in exchange for Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Theo Ratliff, and Dan Dickau.\n\nThe second time, he was shipped to Detroit as part of a huge three-team deal involving the Hawks and the Boston Celtics. The deal also included the Pistons sending Lindsey Hunter, Chucky Atkins, and a 2004 first round pick along with cash to Boston.\n\nThe Celtics, on the other hand, sent forward Chris Mills to the Hawks, and guard Mike James to the Pistons. Meanwhile, the Hawks also received center Zeljko Rebraca, guard Bob Sura and a\n\nfirst-round draft pick (Milwaukee pick if they make the Playoffs) from the Pistons.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons had already made the Conference Finals in 2003 but they got swept by the New Jersey Nets. In an attempt to strengthen their quest for a championship, team executive Joe Dumars made the move to trade for Wallace.\n\nDespite landing Wallace so late in the season, the Pistons went finished the season on a 20-6 with him in the lineup.\n\nIn the Playoffs, other than a seven-game series against the Indiana Pacers in the Conference Semifinals, it was smooth sailing for the Pistons. They made it to the franchise's first NBA Finals since 1990 and upset the heavily favoured Los Angeles Lakers in 5 games to win the third championship in franchise history.\n\nWallace would remain with the team until 2009, making the Conference Finals in all but the final season with the team.\n\nThis trade easily ranks among the most influential mid-season deals made in the 2000s, and possibly in NBA history.\n\nJason Kidd traded to Dallas in 2008\n\nThe Dallas Maverickcs, after being the best team in the West and bowing out in the first round of the 2007 Playoffs, acquired Jason Kidd, Malik Allen, and Antoine Wright from the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Maurice Ager, DeSagana Diop, Devin Harris, Trenton Hassell, Keith Van Horn, a 2008 1st round draft pick and a 2010 first round pick.\n\nOver the next four Playoffs, Kidd and the Mavericks made the Playoffs each year with the last one ending in a NBA Championship, the franchise's first and only.\n\nThis deal might not have had an immediate impact like Detroit's did but Jason Kidd did play a key role in the Mavericks' title run.\n\nDamian Lillard drops 51 on 73-9 Warriors\n\nIn the 2015-16 season, the reigning champions in the Golden State Warriors made NBA history, winning a record 73 regular season games.\n\nBy losing just nine teams, they eclipsed the previous league record of 72-10 set by Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the 1995-96 season.\n\nOne of those nine losses came against the Trail Blazers in Portland when Damian Lillard went off for 51 points:\n\nNot only did Lillard drop a then career-high points tally but he also registered a career-high in steals (6) and a near career-high in 3-pointers made (9)."
