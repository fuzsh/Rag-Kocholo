        "text": "It's hard to say when Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson\n\nstarted to lose his mojo. Maybe it was when he signed that\n\nmonstrous five-year $30 million contract. Maybe it was when he\n\nstarted spending less time on his Harley and more time in his\n\nSUV. Maybe it was when the same man who wore a Panama hat\n\nadorned with a macaw feather to his initial interview with the\n\nChicago Bulls started shilling for an on-line brokerage. Sure,\n\nJackson may again be coaching the best team in basketball, but\n\nhis mystique has diminished, the Zen thing has gotten old, those\n\nenigmatic pronouncements no longer seem so profound.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs guard Terry Porter spoke for many when he said\n\nlast month, \"I would like to see if all that Zen stuff would\n\nwork in Vancouver or Dallas.\" Every team in the league has\n\ngrasped the fundamentals of the vaunted triangle offense, the\n\nfoundation for the Bulls' six titles--\"It's not exactly brain\n\nsurgery,\" Portland Trail Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy claimed\n\nlast week. Even members of Jackson's current ashram have been\n\nsurprised by the coach's taste for convention. \"I expected him\n\nto do more far-out stuff,\" says Lakers forward Robert Horry.\n\n\"About the weirdest thing Phil's had us do is yoga. That's just\n\nstretching and breathing, things I've been doing all my life.\"\n\nStill, before dismissing Jackson by suggesting he's more sham\n\nthan shaman, we must acknowledge that he has imparted one\n\nfundamental Zen quality to this Lakers team: preternatural calm.\n\nOn the heels of an embarrassing 29-point home loss in Game 2 of\n\nthe Western Conference finals, the Lakers ventured to Portland\n\nlast weekend for two crucial games. But if the games were so\n\nimportant that 5,000 Blazermaniacs congregated in downtown\n\nPortland for a rally, the hype was lost on Jackson. No sense of\n\ndesperation in evidence, he simply told his minions to relax,\n\nhave fun and enjoy the challenge. \"Last year we might have\n\npushed the panic button,\" says L.A. guard Derek Fisher. \"With\n\nPhil, he's so loose and confident, you can't help but be that\n\nway too. Our attitude was, What do we have to be worried about?\"\n\nNot much, it turned out. Withstanding a furious first-quarter\n\noutburst by Portland in each game, the Lakers prevailed twice to\n\nseize a commanding 3-1 series lead, draining the drama from what\n\nmany considered the de facto NBA Finals. Bearing all the\n\nhallmarks of a Jackson-coached team, Los Angeles won with\n\nsuperior team defense, impressive efforts from two stars, key\n\ncontributions from reserves and, above all, grace under\n\npressure. \"Staying cool and winning tight games, that's what\n\nchampionship teams do,\" says Lakers guard Ron Harper, who played\n\non three (1995-96 to '97-98) under Jackson in Chicago. \"That\n\nstarts with Phil and rubs off on everyone else.\"\n\nTake Shaquille O'Neal. He not only made a mockery of Dunleavy's\n\nHack-a-Shaq ploy by calmly sinking all nine of his free throw\n\nattempts in Game 4 (\"I felt like Pete Maravich,\" he joked), but\n\nalso was masterly at passing out of the double team. Or consider\n\nforward Glen Rice, a nonfactor in Games 2 and 3, who lit up\n\nBlazers guard Steve Smith, a boyhood AAU rival in Michigan, for\n\n12 points in the decisive third quarter of Game 4. Or Kobe\n\nBryant, who scored 25 points in Game 3--mostly on fallaways that\n\ncalled to mind another shooting guard Jackson once coached--and\n\nresisted forcing the issue when his shot wasn't falling in Game\n\n4. \"We had to start making some kind of statement,\" said\n\nJackson, who through Sunday had the highest playoff winning\n\npercentage (.729) of any coach in NBA history. \"We stayed poised\n\nand made the plays when we had to.\"\n\nHarper, though, showed the most composure. In the second half of\n\nGame 3, Portland's combustible forward, Rasheed Wallace, blocked\n\none of Harper's shots and unleashed an R-rated trash-talk\n\nmonologue, mocking Harper's speech impediment. It was an\n\nunconscionable cheap shot, but Harper, who speaks with a\n\nstutter, laughed it off. \"I've been getting that since I was\n\nfive years old, so whatever words he uses will never get to me,\"\n\nHarper says. \"That just shows what kind of guy he is.\" (Wallace\n\nrefused to discuss the incident, and Blazers p.r. personnel\n\ndenied it took place despite confirmation of Harper's account by\n\na number of courtside observers.)\n\nLater, with 29.9 seconds left and the score tied at 91, Harper\n\nagain showed his poise. After Bryant departed from the triangle\n\nand found an opening in the Portland defense, he zipped a pass\n\nto Harper. Without hesitation, Harper let fly perhaps the\n\nbiggest shot of his 14-year career: a dead-on, 19-foot baseline\n\njumper that stood up as the game-winning shot. \"When you've\n\nplayed as long as I have, you've gotta make that shot,\" Harper\n\nsaid last Saturday, his head covered by a hat with the\n\ninscription DREAMS ARE MEANT TO COME TRUE. He followed those\n\nheroics by scoring 18 points--more than double his season\n\nscoring average--and grabbing seven rebounds in Game 4.\n\nAt 36, having endured a series of knee operations, Harper is but\n\na shadow of the dunking dervish who averaged nearly 23 points as\n\na rookie with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1986-87. (\"I can still\n\ndunk,\" he says, \"it's just that I'm sore the next day.\")\n\nNevertheless, he is precisely the type of battle-tested warrior\n\nwho can emerge as a postseason x factor. \"I'm always one of\n\nthose guys who gets forgotten,\" says Harper, who claims he's\n\nmulling retirement. \"It was the same way in Chicago. But here I\n\nam, trying to get my fourth ring.\"\n\nHarper isn't the only former Bull who has given a strong\n\naccounting of himself in this series. Buoyed by nearly a decade\n\nof experience in Jackson's system, Blazers forward Scottie\n\nPippen has played heroically on defense, often single-handedly\n\naltering the geometry of the Lakers' triangle offense. Roving\n\nthe court like a free safety, Pippen has double-teamed O'Neal\n\nwhen the ball arrives in the post, forcing the Lakers to spread\n\ntheir offense halfway to Corvallis. When O'Neal kicks the ball\n\nback outside, Pippen jumps back out and plays exceptional\n\nperimeter defense. \"I always thought you could only guard one\n\nman at a time, maybe one and a half,\" says Jackson. \"Scottie has\n\nbeen all over the place.\"\n\nNot so offensively. As Jackson insinuated in a psychological\n\ngambit before the series, Pippen might be an exquisite player,\n\nbut he is not comfortable carrying a team. Although he brought\n\nhis sextet of championship rings to practice last week in hopes\n\nof motivating his teammates, he demonstrated little interest in\n\ntaking charge on the court. Defiantly youthful at 34, Pippen is\n\nstill capable of taking his man off the dribble and driving to\n\nthe basket. He is also a three-point threat. Yet when his team\n\nneeded him most, he passed up scads of scoring opportunities,\n\ntotaling only 23 points in last weekend's games. \"I need to be\n\nmore aggressive,\" he said. \"But I also feel like I need to get\n\nmy teammates involved in the flow.\"\n\nAs a team, Portland's great strength is also its great weakness.\n\nThe Blazers' $73.9 million roster boasts the kind of balance\n\nthat would, well, make a Zen master proud. (Portland dropped\n\njust two games in reaching the conference finals, but no Blazer\n\nranked among the league's top 20 playoff scorers.) The depth and\n\nthe democratic attack present Dunleavy with a battery of options\n\nand matchup possibilities and take the pressure off players who\n\nmight be having an off night.\n\nOn the other hand, the lack of a hierarchy and the absence of a\n\ngo-to guy become liabilities at crunch time. With L.A. nursing a\n\n93-91 lead in the final seconds of Game 3, Portland center\n\nArvydas Sabonis, endowed with the mobility of Mount Hood,\n\nfoolishly tried to penetrate, only to have the ball knocked away\n\nby Bryant. Ball game. In a decisive third-quarter stretch of\n\nGame 4, two Dream Teamers, Pippen and Smith, stood by idly while\n\nsecond-year reserve Bonzi Wells tried unsuccessfully to be the\n\nfocal point of the offense. Suddenly a three-point deficit\n\nburgeoned to 10. \"You've got to have players who know their\n\nroles,\" says Harper. \"Not everyone can be the star.\"\n\nAs for the Lakers, after Sunday's final buzzer sounded, they\n\nstrolled regally off the floor, led by their coach, who was\n\nwearing his usual look of supreme confidence. The Rose Garden\n\ncrowd, which hours earlier had been raucous and hostile, was\n\nhushed. There was little booing or taunting; one could sense the\n\nfans' grudging recognition that the Lakers were more centered\n\nand composed--in short, more deserving--than the home team. This\n\neerie quiet? Perhaps it was the sound of one hand clapping.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPHS BY JOHN W.
