        "text": "Celtics big-man Rasheed Wallace had an expensive holiday weekend.\n\nAccording to a story on Boston.com, the league's leader in technical fouls was fined $30,000 for his comments following Friday's win over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIn the game, Wallace was whistled for a technical after calling Toronto’s Hedo Turkoglu a flopper. Later, Paul Pierce received a technical foul after taunting Chris Bosh following a dunk. The combination of the two calls led Wallace to make comments that the league deemed “public criticism of officials.’’\n\nThat’s not to say Wallace will be reaching into his wallet without a little further explanation from the league.\n\n• Future Hall of Famer Ray Allen is marketing his new t-shirt, a “What Would Jesus Shuttlesworth Do?” shirt, for charity at\n\nmuzeconnects.com\n\n.\n\nA tribute to his lead role in the cult classic Spike Lee film “He Got Game,” the T is being used to raise money for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nJuvenile Diabetes is a topic of great interest in the Allen household. Allen’s 2-year-old son, Walker, was released from a four-day diabetes-related hospital stay just hours before Sunday’s game in Miami."
