        "text": "WALTHAM – He had scored a total of 21 points in 78 minutes, 39 seconds of these playoffs, but in Game 2 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Rasheed Wallace managed to squeeze 17 points into 18:11.\n\nCoach Doc Rivers just shrugged.\n\n“Maybe he went into the ‘Hot Tub Time Machine,’ ” Rivers said. “I’m not sure.”\n\nOr a shower. Kevin Garnett revealed on the team’s radio broadcast following Monday night’s 104-86 Game 2 win in Cleveland that he accosted Wallace in the bathing area after Game 1 and said the team needed more out of him. Garnett specifically requested 10 points and 10 rebounds, but the 17 with two boards were good enough.\n\n“That probably screwed him up,” a laughing Rivers said. “Whatever works, I’m all for it. But the guys talk to each other a lot. When a guy’s not playing well for the team, obviously that guy has to have a meeting with the coach at some point. But what’s going to get the guy going more is his teammates. That hasn’t changed in 50 years.”\n\nAnd considering the way Sheed had been playing, he’s probably relieved this wasn’t the “Psycho” shower scene. His 1-for-5, two-point, three-foul “effort” in Game 1 might have been the low point in a somnambulant season.\n\nPerhaps this latest game was simply a Sheedshank Redemption (copyright the Herald’s Mark Murphy, second quarter, Monday).\n\nRivers was asked if Wallace was mentally into it during the season.\n\n“I don’t know,” Rivers said. “I guess. With his play, you can say not. To me, I’m not going to go there. How does that benefit me? I’m into (tomorrow night’s) Game 3. So you can answer it any way you want to. Did he play as well as we wanted him to? No. But can he do anything about that? No. All he can do is what the next game gives him.”\n\nThat’s probably the way Wallace is looking at it, too, but he didn’t share many deep thoughts yesterday. He went through his usual post-practice routing, accepting feeds from assistant coach Clifford Ray and taking shots from the post and 3-point line before ending with free throws.\n\nHis practice shirt was on backward, and he was wearing sweatpants cut off at the low end of his calf. His pockets were turned out and flapping. Sheed happened on this look a number of years ago. The look is, well, unique.\n\nLike the player.\n\nWallace was interviewed as he slowly moved out the door that separates the practice court from the trainer’s room.\n\n“Man, just playing,” he said when asked about the last game and building off it. “I ain’t worried about last game. Last game’s over with. Just got to play.”\n\nOn the change in his effectiveness (7-of-8 shooting from the floor), he said, “I don’t know. Who knows? Making shots.”\n\nOn grasping his importance: “Just hoopin’, man. I mean, that’s all. I knew it was going to be like that from Day One. Just hoopin’. Nothing different.”\n\nOn the effect of the shower talk with Garnett: “No, it’s stuff we’ve been saying to each other all season, so it’s nothing new.”\n\nSomeone else took a shot at the Game 2 difference.\n\n“Just shootin’, man,” Wallace said. “That’s all. Just made shots. Ain’t nothing different. Y’all think it’s just one facet of the game. It’s not. There’s two facets of this game. You know, if I’m not making shots, OK, then I have to do something on defense. So if I’m missing shots or making shots, it doesn’t affect my overall game.”\n\nWallace was asked again about the Garnett chat.\n\n“Man, stuff we’ve been talking about all year,” Wallace said as he slipped out of sight.\n\nHis teammates like Sheed and laugh about this stuff, just as long as he stays in view of the stat sheet."
