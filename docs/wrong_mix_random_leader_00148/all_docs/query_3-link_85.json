        "text": "AUBURN HILLS – Many great players have worn the Pistons uniform. George Yardley, Dave Bing, Bob Lanier, Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars and Grant Hill, to name a few, were some of the dominant players at their positions during their years as Pistons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil Wednesday, the franchise never had two of their players make the All-NBA team. That changed when both Ben Wallace and Chauncey Billups were voted to the All-NBA second team.\n\n“Good things come to those who wait,” Wallace said after being informed of the dual honor. “I thought maybe it would have happened before, but it’s one of those things. If you continue to bring in guys who go out there and work hard, good things usually happen.”\n\nFor Wallace, it was the fifth straight season he made an All-NBA team. He was a second teamer in 2003 and 2004 and a third-team selection in 2002 and 2005. This is Billups’ first All-NBA selection in his nine-year career.\n\n“We had a lot of guys deserving of getting it, and both of those guys had very, very good years,” Saunders said. “It’s a direct refl ection of the success the team has had.”\n\nWallace nearly edged out Shaquille O’Neal for first-team honors at center. O’Neal received 45 first-place votes and 402 points; Wallace had 44 first-place votes and 363 points.\n\nKobe Bryant and Steve Nash were the only guards who had more points that Billups’ 378. Billups had 21 first-place votes and was joined on the second team by Dwyane Wade.\n\n“A lot of people knew he was going to make something because most of the year he was mentioned as an MVP candidate,” Saunders said.\n\nWallace would have felt better about the accolade if the Pistons hadn’t lost two straight playoff games.\n\n“You appreciate it and all that but we’ve got bigger things going on right now < the playoffs and trying to find a way to win games,” he said. “You don’t want to let that sidetrack you and you go out there thinking somebody owes you something.”\n\nRasheed Wallace earns community award\n\nRasheed Wallace’s Game 4 guarantee fell flat, but his efforts in the community guaranteed him the league’s Community Assist Award for April. He also earned the award in February 2005.\n\n“From a coaching standpoint, an award like that to me is as important as a guy making second team all-league because athletes at our level have an opportunity to help people, and kids especially,” Saunders said. “When players step up and do those things, they’ve having a direct positive influence on our community.”\n\nWallace did numerous charitable acts to gain the honor. He spearheaded efforts for the “Let’s Make Dreams Come True for Children” Gala and\n\nAuction to benefi t The Rasheed A. Wallace Foundation. He and his wife Fatima hosted the event, which raised more than $100,000 for his foundation.\n\nIn late March, Wallace unveiled a 5,000 square-foot library at Detroit’s Kettering High School that his foundation renovated in partnership with the Pistons-Palace Foundation and Detroit Pistons Read to Achieve program. This season, Wallace also purchased 25 season tickets distributed to a different local non-profit organization or inner city school for each Pistons home game.\n\nWallace shies away from publicity for these events. He’s known mainly to the public for his brash comments and his propensity for picking up technicals.\n\n“People don’t know him,” Saunders said. “What you see sometimes is not how somebody really is.”\n\nMaxiell put on active list\n\nRookie Jason Maxiell benefi ted from Rasheed Wallace’s sprained right ankle. Maxiell, the Pistons’ first-round draft pick, was activated for the first time in the postseason. He replaced center Kelvin Cato.\n\n“In case something happened to Sheed, we wanted another forward that was quicker and more active, to be able to put in there in there if we had to against one of their more athletic, quicker forwards,” Saunders said."
