My Mom probably never imagined how serious I would get about the sport. Watching the Knicks in the early 1990s motivated me to play as soon as I attended Friends Seminary. I was on  the middle school and the JV teams (7th-10th grade). It was one of the hardest periods of my teenage years, because I was forcing myself to be the player I thought I should be. My missed shots and turnovers brought out so much anger and frustration. Like a young Rasheed Wallace, my temper got me benched more times than I can remember. And rightfully so‚Ä¶ Having coached middle school this past season, I now understand what my JV coach had to put up with. Back then, I couldn‚Äôt be mad at my Mom for not being able to play, and I couldn‚Äôt blame my Dad for not being present to teach and coach me‚Ä¶ it had to start with my will to believe in my abilities; to dedicate myself to being a better version of myself with each possession. I knew a lot of other kids also raised by single mothers that grinded harder than me. Going to basketball camp, or weekends playing pick-up games at NYU, I took full advantage of the time to improve my mind and my skills. \n\nWe are now a true basketball family. We are a ‚ÄúBig 3,‚Äù with our son as our star point guard. Tiffany‚Äôs role on our ‚Äúteam‚Äù is like General Manager. We are so fortunate to have another passionate family member who will go the extra mile to get us to Knicks games, and enroll Cassius in hoop camps. She encouraged me to coach this year; taking in every detail of our games. Her shouting from the sidelines brought smiles to my face. Her excitement reminds me of my Mom‚Äôs happiness to see me play. Yet Cassius dominates games from start to finish. So I can imagine my Mom and Tiffany cheering together would be a raucous scene. His love for basketball is unmatched. He is an incredible talent, with potential for so much more. It is through teamwork that our parenting has produced the pride and joy into this budding young man. \nüèÄüß°üíôüß°üèÄ\".",
