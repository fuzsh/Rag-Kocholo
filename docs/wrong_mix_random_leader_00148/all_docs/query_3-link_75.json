        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Where Brian Grant plays next season has turned into the latest version of an NBA morality play.\n\nIs the power forward a \"pirate\" trying to grab as much money as possible — as he was described by one radio broadcaster Wednesday — or an athlete willing to sacrifice dollars for a chance to win?\n\nAccording to Grant himself, \"it's time to move on\" and keep control over his career.\n\nThe latest possibility involves a sign-and-trade deal that would send Grant to the Miami Heat, the Cleveland Cavaliers' Shawn Kemp to Portland and a package of players from Miami to Cleveland.\n\nGrant's agent said Wednesday that deal was in the works but warned that big trades \"can often fall apart.\"\n\nGrant, meanwhile, tried to explain to a city that used to love him why he probably would soon be playing somewhere else.\n\n\"I've got teams I'm looking at, but if I didn't feel I had to be in this position, I wouldn't be in this position,\" Grant said in an interview with KXJM-FM, some of his first comments about the situation. \"This is my only opportunity to make a move on my terms, because if I stay (and move on their terms) ... then I could end up in a place like Cleveland.\"\n\nThe power forward almost ended up in Cleveland, in a $93 million deal that would have sent him to the Cavaliers in exchange for Kemp. But as a free agent, Grant used his power to turn down the deal.\n\nThen, after opting to become a free agent at the end of June and giving up a guaranteed $40 million over the next four years, Grant this week reportedly turned down a $70 million offer to stay with the Blazers.\n\nBut Grant said he \"never officially turned down the Blazers. ... They asked me what I wanted to do, and I said I thought it was time for me to move on. And when I say it's time to move on, I don't mean that in a bad or negative way, because Portland knows how I care about the community there.\"\n\nStill, Grant's decision did not sit well with some Trail Blazer fans, who have admired the dreadlocked power forward for his work with community groups and children's charities.\n\n\"We personally loved him. His charity work touched my heart, \" said Neil Fernando, a civil engineer walking in downtown Portland Wednesday. \"But money talks these days. Professional sports are a money-driven thing.\"\n\nGrant, 28, remains one of the league's best all-around power forwards. Despite being slowed by knee and foot injuries last season, he started 46 of 50 games in the strike-shortened 1999 season and averaged 11.5 points and 9.8 rebounds.\n\nGrant had surgery on his left knee and missed the first eight games of 1999-2000. the time he returned, Rasheed Wallace was firmly established at power forward, on his way to the All-Star game.\n\nGrant later missed another 11 games with a foot injury and averaged 21 minutes, 7.3 points and 5.5 rebounds per game — all career lows.\n\nGrant's agent, Mark Bartelstein, said Wednesday the Heat are negotiating a sign-and-trade deal involving Grant, Kemp and a package of players.\n\n\"We're talking about a bunch of different scenarios,\" Bartelstein said. \"At this point, Brian feels Miami is the best opportunity for him. He would like to do that, if it can get done.\"\n\nBartelstein also cautioned \"these things are difficult to work out. They can often fall apart. We're working toward bringing resolution to all this.\"\n\nIf a trade can't be worked out, Grant might accept the Heat's $2.25 million exception, then negotiate a long-term deal with the team beginning next year.\n\nThat possibility — turning down money for a spot with a winning team over the woeful Cavaliers — has earned the praise of some.\n\nWhatever happens, Grant said he'll never abandon his ties to Portland.\n\n\"When I say I may be leaving Portland as a basketball player. ... I'm still in Portland. My foundation is based there. I'm getting ready to grant my foundation a large sum of money ... and a lot of that money is going to stay right there in Portland,\" Grant said. \"My fan club base is going to stay there, so I'm going to be part of Portland.\""
