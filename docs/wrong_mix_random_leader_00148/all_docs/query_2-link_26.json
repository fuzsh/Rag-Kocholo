        "text": "Two retired former Trail Blazers are reportedly making a return to the hardwood, according to Sam Amick of USA Today.\n\nThe \"Champions League,\" a 30-team basketball league started by CEO Carl George, hopes to includes 16-teams playing a 30-game schedule beginning in 2016. The big draw for fans is that the league plans to bring in plenty of former NBA players, including former Blazers Rasheed Wallace and Brandon Roy.\n\nRoy has reportedly already agreed to the league's first game, a charity event scheduled for Jan. 29 at St. Louis University. Wallace has agreed to join the New York based team, which reportedly already includes Wallace along with NBA veterans Al Harrington and Maurice Ager. According to Amick, the league plans to add teams in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Miami, Orlando, Atlanta and Cleveland.\n\nGeorge told USA Today the annual salaries for players in the league would be around $200,000, well-above the low end salaries in the NBA Development League. The Champions League hopes to sell tickets in the $25 range and plans to conclude its season with a \"March Madness style tournament.\"\n\nRoy's return to competitive basketball would be surprising considering his NBA career ended in 2012 due to degenerative knee problems and that he reportedly tore his Achilles tendon in a pick up game two summers ago.\n\nWallace initially retired in after the 2009-10 season, but returned two years later and played 21 games for the New York Knicks in 2012-13. He served as an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons during the 2013-14 season.\n\nHere some more Blazers-centric links:\n\n-- Heartbreak in Houston: Trail Blazers blow 15-point 4th-quarter lead, lose in overtime to Rockets\n\n-- Reasons for optimism during the Trail Blazers losing streak: My Friend Chuck Podcast\n\n-- Blazers blow fourth-quarter lead again... and the obvious reason\n\n-- Amid a cruel season of spectacular losses, Trail Blazers forge on\n\n-- Heroics by Brewer, Harden give Rockets unlikely win"
