        "text": "“Oh, the little guy has done it again!” If you were a fan of basketball in 2017, these are words you would hear often in referral to the Celtics’ Isaiah Thomas that year. At a height of 5 foot 9, the only part of his game that was “short” was his height itself. IT’s career year on the court would not only affect his life for years to come but would have a profound impact on my life as a huge Celtics fan.\n\nMy obsession with basketball started in 2007, it became “my thing”. I turned into a basketball fiend and at one point became so infamous on the NBA subreddit under the username “RondoGoat”, I got banned from the sub. I watched the Celtics win it all in 2008 with the mantra “Anything is Possible.” Then in 2010 broke my heart after Rasheed Wallace was so out of shape it cost us a title when Perkins got hurt. In 2013, I remember being horrified about the trade of my childhood favorites Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett for draft picks and the corpse of Gerald Wallace, a wannabe Kardashian in Kris Humpries, and miserable Keith Bogans. The one bright piece of the trade it seemed to be was local Providence stud Marshon Brooks who turned out to be all flash in the pan. Little did I know, that the draft picks would be the foundation of the current team I know and love( Tatum and Brown were both picks from the trade). Later on, I would learn to never doubt Danny Ainge.\n\nAnyway, flash forward to the summer of 2017. The NBA playoffs are just around the corner and the Celtics are the 1st seed with a record of 53–29. A record, not even the most optimistic Celtics fan could have imagined before the season started. Let me tell you the starting lineup and you tell me if anybody really stands out. Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Al Horford, and Amir Johnson/Marcus Smart depending on the matchup. On paper, these are all okay to good players, but no true superstar. Coming into that season, the best player was 4-time all-star Al Horford. Anybody who has watched Horford play can attest he’s a very good player and great 2nd or 3rd option, but he can’t be the focal point of an offense. This was a huge reason that media pundits had Boston anywhere from 3rd in the East to 6th in the East depending on the publication. What nobody saw coming was the rise of the ‘little guy’ Isaiah Thomas.\n\nTo say, Isaiah Thomas went off that season would be a total understatement. Thomas, at a height of 5 foot 9, averaged about 29 points and 6 assists a game on a truly absurd 62.5% true shooting. To understand how goddamn crazy that is, the only players to average over 28 PPG and have a higher TS % are 2015–16 Steph Curry that won unanimous MVP and the basketball cheat code that is Kevin Durant who is a 7 foot forward with guard skills. He became the Celtics franchise leading scorer in 4th quarter points per game. This isn’t some chump franchise like the Hornets or something, the Boston Celtics have won 17 titles and have a rich and storied history, for Thomas to accomplish that feat is seriously impressive. Let me reiterate, he accomplished all of this at the height at the average height of an American male in a league where the average height is 6 foot 7. He led that Celtics to a first seed and a matchup with the dysfunctional Bulls.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls were coming off a tumultuous season filled with all sorts of drama. The Bulls veterans led by Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Wade, and Rajon Rondo had been expected to lead the Bulls team to a top-4 seed, but with chemistry issues, fights between the vets and younger guys, and rookie head coach in Fred Hoiberg, they never really got it together and faltered to the 8th seed. The Bulls were only an 8th seed in name only, they played like a wounded lion won’t go down without a fight. By god, fight they did. They quickly took a 2–0 series lead vs the Celtics.\n\nThings were not looking good for the Celtics. It seemed like former Celtics guard Rajon Rondo had the Celtics figured out. The media and rival fanbases alike sensed blood and rumblings of things like “fake one seed” and how Celtics coach Brad Stevens is a playoff choker was abundant. With a little luck (Rondo hurting his thumb) and certain adjustments like playing Gerald Green more, the Celtics managed to avoid an embarrassing series loss to the 8th seed Bulls by winning the next 4 games.\n\nDuring that series, Thomas averaged 23 points and 6 assists on 56 TS % which while good was a step down from the regular season. Thomas, struggled a little bit with all the defensive attention focused on him in the playoffs, but more importantly, Thomas was struggling with a personal tragedy. Before the series started, Thomas’ sister Chyna tragically died in a car crash. Thomas played game one just one day after his sister’s death and had 33 points that game.\n\nThomas described the week of his sister’s death as the “hardest week of my life.” To many Thomas was a hero, but to me, he became something more. Thomas was already an inspiration for everything he did on the court at my height, but he became a symbol of hope for me when things are down for me. There is something intrinsically human about somebody trying to push through tragedy and try to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Too often we see millionaire athletes allowed to play a child's game, but never the real person behind the canned answers athletes give to the media. I really appreciated seeing the human side of Thomas even if it wasn’t on purpose.\n\nI never really felt the way I felt about an athlete, the way I feel about Isaiah Thomas because I never related to an athlete more. Thomas was an underdog the moment he stepped on the court. He was drafted last overall as the 60th pick in 2011, he bounced around the league even though he was scoring machine, he seemed to finally find his place in Boston ( or so we thought) and then he had to overcome even more.\n\nThat summer, I saw a guy at my height struggle with a personal tragedy and the weight of an entire fanbase on his shoulders, and boy did he deliver. I woke up every single morning at 4 AM Indian time to watch the Celtics playoff games. I remember when I was silently cheering, trying not to wake up my grandparents, as he scored 53 points in a playoff game vs the Wizards. It was the most fitting tribute to his sister Chyna on what was supposed to be her 23rd birthday.\n\n“It’s my sister. It’s her birthday today. Happy birthday. She would’ve been 23 today. Everything I do is for her, and she’s watching over me, so that’s all her,” Thomas said.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k6A9lhzrag\n\nI remember him playing through a tooth being knocked out that ended up requiring two surgeries. I remember when he led the Celtics past the Wizards while averaging 27 PPG in a grueling 7 game series filled with drama and theatrics. I even remember when he played on a badly injured knee (that we would later find out would lead to multiple surgeries) and try his best to beat a Cavaliers team led by LeBron James that was just simply much better than the Celtics in the ECF. He couldn’t deliver then, but man you can’t say he didn’t give it his all and for that, you have to tip your cap.\n\nIt didn’t end like I had hoped as the Celtics got knocked out in 5 games to the Cavaliers, but who even thought they would make it that far? Certainly not me or most other Celtic fans. Thomas, unfortunately, that same summer was traded to Cavaliers for “Mr. Flat Earther” Kyrie Irving which was a harrowing reminder of the ugly side of the business. It never was about what jersey he was wearing though, what he did that summer impacted me far beyond that.\n\nYou ever remember when you fall in love with a sport and you have a certain athlete to thank for that? I thought I loved basketball before I saw Thomas on the Celtics, but he not only made me really fall in love with basketball, but he changed my life. Every time I struggled with my career, my rejections from jobs and internships, my own self-belief in myself, I asked myself what would IT do? The answer was simple: push through to the end of the tunnel. It’s what kept me going after getting rejected by ESPN 8 times, before finally getting an internship with them, it's one of the things that keeps me going in this period filled with uncertainty and chaos, and its what propels me to be the best version of myself I can be in my career and otherwise. Thomas said it best on his twitter bio: “If all I’m remembered for is being a good basketball player, then I’ve done a bad job with the rest of my life.” A sentiment that I try to live by to this day."
