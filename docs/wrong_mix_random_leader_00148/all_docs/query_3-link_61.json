        "text": "AUBURN HILLS – Pistons coach Larry Brown isn’t blind to Rasheed Wallace’s faults, but doesn’t think the vision of him complaining to referees should define his whole person. There’s so much more to Wallace, say Brown and his Detroit teammates, it’s unfortunate the rest of the public doesn’t see it.\n\n“He’s a poor sport,” Brown said. “That’s all. When he thinks something is not right, he reacts and sometimes acts silly, but it doesn’t take away from who he is in my mind. He’s a great player, better guy.”\n\nIf Brown and the Pistons have said it once, they’ve said it 1,000 times. They would not have won the championship last year without Wallace. And this season, they probably would not have gotten where they are, within two wins of a repeat entering last night’s pivotal Game 5 against the Spurs at the Palace, without him.\n\nLast season’s trading-deadline acquisition of Wallace from the Trail Blazers was the final piece to the puzzle, just like the Knicks’ December 1968 acquisition of Dave DeBusschere from Detroit. Instead of the team needing to adjust to a new starter, the Pistons took off on a tear.\n\nThe Blazers shipped him to Detroit to clean up their image. But Wallace, averaging just 9.5 points in the series but playing stout defense on Tim Duncan, has earned a new rep by keeping the Pistons loose, his flakiness now a positive. While sitting at the podium during a press conference Saturday, Wallace called teammate Richard Hamilton on the cell phone.\n\n“Man, he’s crazy,” Hamilton said. “I say he’s a big kid. When he came to our team, he did so many great things for us, helping us out on the court on and off. He’s silly, he makes everybody laugh. When he’s acting a certain way in front of y’all guys, we get him in the locker room and we just hammer him like, ‘What are you doing man?’ “\n\nWallace’s relationship with the media is strained. During Saturday’s practice, he told a cameraman behind the bench to “get the bleep away,” as he wanted to whisper privately to teammate Lindsay Hunter.\n\nWallace makes reporters wait for several awkward minutes by his locker, ignoring them as he goes through his rituals that include putting on his headphones, adjusting them and readjusting them.\n\nLast week, after the second straight day of media press conferences, he refused to stand by his podium, instead sitting with headphones on, listening to music. He said he’d already been asked all the questions the day before. His teammates cooperated.\n\nA Detroit columnist recently gave the most honest account of the great divide between Wallace and the media, invoking culture and race – not racism. Wallace is as hip-hop as they come and most reporters covering the Finals are not.\n\nWallace talks in street, saying the other day he cares about “just getting the ‘ships.” Apparently he was referring to championships. Two days ago, he said the Spurs would be “geeked” for Game 5. He constantly throws in references like those, but Brown, who used a Yiddish word Friday, sees through it.\n\nBrown, a North Carolina alumnus, has known Wallace since he played for the Tar Heels. Brown pushed Pistons GM Joe Dumars hard to get the Philadelphia native.\n\n“You ask people in Philadelphia of all the things he’s done without anybody knowing about it, for the community and young people, it’s remarkable,” Brown said.\n\nWallace runs a Rasheed Wallace Foundation in Philly that sponsors youth basketball camps and such.\n\n“Y’all don’t know him,” teammate Chauncey Billups said. “Y’all don’t know him like we know him. He likes to have fun, cares about the people he knows. He’s a family man. He’s very misunderstood. I don’t really think he wants y’all to get to know him, but that’s just Sheed.”\n\nWhen asked about playing last night on Father’s Day, Wallace gave his typical sharp response. “It [stinks],” he said. “That’s our one day to take a load off our feet and I have to put the load on my feet.”"
