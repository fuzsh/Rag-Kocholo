        "text": "There have been plenty of accomplishments by the Celtics since the arrival of Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in 2007.\n\nThey have won the NBA championship, had the best record in the league with 66 victories, put together a 62-win season despite losing Garnett for nearly two months and had a team-record 19-game winning streak.\n\nOne thing the Celtics have not been able to do in that span, however, is win a game at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.\n\nThe Celtics have traveled to the city by Lake Erie seven times the past two seasons, including one playoff series, and they are winless.\n\nTonight, when the Celtics begin a season that has the potential to be something special, they will get another chance to defeat LeBron James on his home court.\n\nThe NBA is kicking off the 2009-10 season in style by pitting the Celtics against the Cavaliers in the Cleveland debut of Shaquille O’Neal (7:35, TV: TNT; Radio: WEEI-850 AM).\n\nOne of the leading contenders in the Eastern Conference is going to be 0-1 by 10 o’clock tonight. One of the teams that did some serious upgrading in the summer is going to get off to a losing start.\n\nFor the Celtics, with a healthy Garnett and newcomers Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, breaking the losing streak in Cleveland would be a nice springboard to a new season.\n\n“It would be nice,’’ said Coach Doc Rivers after practice on Monday afternoon. “I don’t think it’s going to make or break our season or anything like that, but, yeah, whenever you can beat a very good team on the road it would be great, especially a team that we haven’t had a lot of success with on the road.\n\n“Not the easiest way to start your season in Cleveland, I can tell you that, but, hell, we’re going to have to play them eventually.’’\n\nThe Celtics have not won in Cleveland since a 114-107overtime victory on Dec. 18, 2004. They were handed 98-83 and 107-76 losses last season and dropped all three playoff games in the 2008 conference semifinal round.\n\nThe teams are opening the season against each other for a second year in a row. Cleveland watched the Celtics raise banner No. 17 to the rafters last Oct. 28, then the Cavs were defeated, 90-85.\n\nNeither team represented the East in the NBA Finals with the Orlando Magic knocking both off, so the Cavs went out and got O’Neal and the Celtics strengthened their bench.\n\nThe result is most experts are picking either the Celtics or Cavs to play in the conference finals next spring with the Magic an afterthought.\n\nThat should make opening night, Boston vs. Cleveland, quite a show.\n\n“It gives you a measuring stick of where you’re at,’’ said Paul Pierce. “You’ve got two teams who are contenders for the championship starting right out of the gate. It’s great to play these type of games early on, to be in atmosphere on the road.\n\n“It’s going to be a playoff-type atmosphere and a playoff-type game early, right into it. We’re excited for it. We’re ready.’’\n\nGarnett, who will be playing a real game for the first time since March 25, is anxious to get going.\n\n“It is (one of 82), but opening night is like your first date,’’ said Garnett, who underwent knee surgery in May. “Hopefully, you guys have been on some dates. You all know what I’m talking about, right? First date sets everything up.\n\n“It sets the foundation for what potentially could be. Opening night is just that. It’s the first time you want to make a first impression on your new fans and your new sponsors. So opening night is a big deal.\n\n“Opening doors, pulling chairs out — you all know what it is. So, yeah, opening night is a big deal, man. It’s the night that you want, that you promote everything. It’s the night that — the one night of many that you want to impress. So, yeah, it’s a big deal.’’\n\nFor Garnett, it is a very big deal after he missed just about all of the final quarter of the regular season and the entire playoffs due to the knee injury.\n\nHe figures to be amped up an extra notch or two for the Cavs after not playing in seven months.\n\n“I’m excited. I’m happy to be healthy,’’ he said. “I’m running pretty good. I’m happy where everything’s at with myself. Teamwise, we look very sharp. Obviously we can sharpen up some tools and we’re still in the making and we’re trying to get this team to be damned near perfect.\n\n“I think not only myself, but everybody’s excited, but knowing my little story and how long I’ve been out, I’m eager to jump the season off. I’ve never really gotten nervous. ‘Anxious’ is what I would tell you. ‘Eager’ would be some of the words I would use.’’"
