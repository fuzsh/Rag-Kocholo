        "text": "We're going to try something a little different for the late spring and summer and move your \"Ask David\" questions on Detroit Pistons-related topics to Tuesdays. We'll shift back to our long-running Friday slot before training camp but it seems everything major this summer falls on a Thursday or Friday -- the NBA Draft Combine this week, the draft, the opening of free agency -- so Tuesday will work better temporarily.\n\nBesides, as all of you line up vacations and weekend tee times, it might be a little easier to catch your attention on Tuesday afternoons than Fridays during the spectacular Michigan summer.\n\nThis necessitates a short-term change to the deadline for submissions. For the next few weeks, deadline is 3 p.m. Mondays. Otherwise, everything remains the same.\n\nFor inclusion in next week's version, email your questions to dmayo@mlive.com and put \"Ask David\" in the subject line or send them in via Twitter.\n\nSo we begin:\n\nQ: We all know the Pistons need a backup point guard. But do you think one of their biggest needs is a starting power forward? I love Marcus Morris and Tobias Harris but they really are small forwards. They play well together. When I watch the Pistons I think they needed a bigger power forward, 6-10 or taller, that can help with rebounding, and defending larger power forwards in the post. Especially since beyond Andre Drummond there is no other really good rebounder and Morris and Harris are just too small to rebound with bigger power forwards. Sure, they create matchup problems for other teams on offense, but on defense and rebounding they can be overmatched. I think they need a Rasheed Wallace-type starting power forward who can defend, rebound, stretch the floor with shooting, and score in the post. The bench will get better with Morris or Harris. What do you think? -- Darius\n\nA: Well, Darius, I managed to trim your question to 152 words, including cutting your apology for the long question/explanation. That part encouraged me to let you skate for being over the 140-word limit. I had one question this week that was longer than my columns. I swear, I think the guy was a final-year doctoral student and sent me something he intended for his professor. I'd like to tell you I read it but ... I just couldn't. Anyway, welcome to the conversation and for allowing me to springboard into my periodic word-limit warning.\n\nPower forward and point guard are essential spots to be addressed this summer and I agree they need some size up front. Do I think it's an imperative right now that they get a power forward who presumably would push Harris to starting small forward? No. I just think they need a bigger power forward off the bench who can help them play another way.\n\nOver the long haul, the Pistons have their youthful core and a need to upgrade from there. To what degree Drummond's free-throw woes continue to limit him, those upgrades absolutely could include roster and starting changes at any of the five positions, though center and point guard are the least likely among those.\n\nI don't think a new starting power forward is a mandate right now, particularly with the Pistons finding Morris and Harris sympatico, as you noted. Moving Harris to small forward also would amplify his defensive shortcomings against quicker players on the perimeter.\n\nWhatever the Pistons do, they need more reliable 3-point shooting, particularly at shooting guard and power forward. That does not mandate a change in starters immediately. It mandates more depth. Inconsistent bench production was a bigger problem than inconsistent starting production. The Pistons just need a few more good players, and to what degree those additions force lineup changes by virtue of production, you allow that to happen organically.\n\nBy all means, if a Rasheed Wallace type presents himself, scrap all that. But about 30 NBA teams could use a Rasheed Wallace type.\n\nQ: Stan Van Gundy and Jeff Bower have traditionally steered clear of restricted free agents. Do you think restricted free agency is a non-starter or would they consider it in the right situation? I'm thinking Matthew Dellavadova, 25-year-old backup point guard that brings shooting and toughness along with the ability to play in two-point-guard lineups. As always, thanks for your insight. -- Mike\n\nA: I don't think it's a non-starter but the whole concept of directly signing restricted free agents rather than involving them in sign-and-trade deals is a bit touchy. By definition, you are paying an amount the player's current team is not willing to pay to keep him, for whatever reason.\n\nTo get Dellavedova on an affordable offer sheet probably equates to a Cleveland match, and you've tied up your money for three days while the Cavs leave you dangling. To get him on an offer sheet Cleveland won't match probably equates to overpaying.\n\nThat's precisely the kind of disadvantaged scenario the Pistons have tried to avoid but it depends, again, on what level of financial commitment it requires. Dellavedova will be an eight-figure player next year but how high into eight figures? At $11-12 million, he's a good get and Cleveland probably matches. At $15-16 million, he could hurt your long-term bottom line. No matter what, and wherever Dellavedova goes, you have to project his game upon a team that doesn't have LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. I like his game and think he'd be a good Piston but it depends greatly upon the financial parameters.\n\nHe's not exactly the kind of restricted free agent the Pistons necessarily would avoid because he isn't a maximum-contract player but he still would eat up at least half their cap space for up to three days, after which it still might not work out. And they have the cap space to splurge once. They can't swing and miss. He may be a bit out of their range.\n\nThey're more likely to look at unrestricted free agents, and perhaps sign-and-trade deals for certain restricted free agents.\n\nDellavedova will get paid next year. If the Cavs win a championship, they most likely will be the ones paying him. It's only natural to try to stretch this out and try to keep together a championship group.\n\nIf the Cavs don't win, who knows what happens in Cleveland? That's the big X-factor. If this goes wrong, how do they blow it up? If that happens and the Pistons believe Dellavedova isn't part of the ongoing plan, that's the spot where they might take a chance.\n\nQ: Dave, what is the biggest difference between NBA regular season and NBA playoffs that you see? I'm talking everything from coaching on down? To me, it seems like a complete different level. Thanks and God bless. -- Jeff\n\nA: The better defensive teams move on and the lesser ones are left behind in every series at every level of the bracket. That's the single biggest difference. You might have high-scoring games but you can't rely on outscoring teams in postseason.\n\nCleveland is winning games primarily because of defense and 3-point shooting, with one feeding the other, but the Cavs look like a championship team because of their offensive rebounding and the willingness to scrap for contested possessions. They have been voracious in corralling 50-50 balls.\n\nJonas Valanciunas and Hassan Whiteside both getting hurt during the Toronto-Miami series altered the paint consequences in that series considerably. It already was going to be difficult enough against Cleveland without a hobbled big man for whichever team survives.\n\nThe less Toronto thinks, and the more Toronto just plays, the more dangerous Toronto gets, though it won't matter much if the Raptors play Cleveland.\n\nI can't believe some of these coaching firings. Dave Joerger was playing with a D-League lineup when Memphis fired him. Frank Vogel was playing with Paul George and the Pips, and still went seven games in a No. 2 vs. No. 7 series, when Indiana fired him. It's a tough business.\n\nOklahoma City's pace is starting to wear on San Antonio. That could have a big effect on the Spurs-Warriors series. Like maybe even denying it. San Antonio's homecourt advantage is palpable but not insurmountable.\n\nSteph Curry, 17 in overtime, 40 in the game, after a bum leg. First unanimous MVP in history.\n\nA Warriors-Cavs rematch, with both teams at full strength, would be a joy to watch.\n\nQ: Looking back on that February voided trade -- where the Pistons had acquired Donatas Montiejunas and Marcus Thornton from the Houston Rockets -- do you think that if the trade had not been annulled the Pistons' season would have ended differently? With hindsight, it's obvious Montiejunas was fit to play, considering he appeared in 23 of the Rockets' last 24 games, and all five of their playoff games against the Warriors. While Thornton -- a shooting guard -- actually provided a late-season lift for Washington. Do you think Stan Van Gundy, knowing what we now know, would've taken both players for what would turn out to be an 18th pick? Both for the short-term and the long-term ramifications. (I'm sure Steph Curry would have liked to have seen that trade completed.) Thank you, David. Have a great summer. -- A.A.\n\nA: I don't think the season would have turned out any differently. Motiejunas would have given the Pistons another way to play, which goes to my earlier answer about power forwards, and there obviously was interest in having him here. Detroit made the trade, after all. But adding Motiejunas to the Pistons' roster probably doesn't get them to seventh in the East (which would alter the playoff pairings, and I still think Detroit could have beaten Toronto in the first round), and certainly doesn't get them past Cleveland.\n\nAs to whether Van Gundy would make the deal now, no, I don't think he would. You touched on the reason late in your answer, the long-term ramifications. A decision of that nature is uncommon and not made in a vacuum and while I have no idea what specifically led the Pistons' doctors to make a recommendation which led the team to rescind the trade, long-term prognosis played heavily into it. That's not the kind of decision you really second-guess much and it's not the kind of decision a non-medical person like Van Gundy makes without heavy input from established medical professionals. You take the data you are presented, you make a decision and you live with it. Remember, Motiejunas had played some in the D-League before the trade. He could get up and down the floor and put the ball in the hoop. The Pistons knew that much. They knew he could play now. Either they were looking for a long-term trigger that concerned them, or merely happened upon one, during the extensive physical examinations Motiejunas underwent in New York and Detroit.\n\nIf Motiejunas is still playing and producing at a high level five years from now, maybe Van Gundy will lament the trade. But you don't trade away a first-round pick, even in a weak draft, on a short-term lark. There clearly was much more at stake in that decision than just a myopic view of what happened between the All-Star break and the end of April.\n\nQ: Enjoy your coverage of my favorite franchise in sports. I'm 32 years old. I've had season tickets and been to many games between 1988-2007. Then I moved to Phoenix. I haven't missed a game whether in person or on TV since Grant Hill was drafted. My question is this ... The Palace was always full and rocking in all the years I've followed the Pistons. However, I went to a couple games this year (including Game 4 in the playoffs) and the crowd was bad in terms of attendance and loudness. Normally it is a very rowdy, hostile environment. Even on TV it sounds quiet. The crowd wouldn't hardly chant DE-FENCE, even when the Did a lot of the passionate Pistons fans move out of state, like myself? I understand the team has been bad for awhile but has improved. I've been pretty disappointed in our home games/crowd and am kind of worried about losing this team down the road. What's going on around there? Some have commented on this. Please give us your take. Thanks.sound guy would play the beat to encourage the chant. The Sixers, Kings, Wolves and a few other bad teams have had great support during droughts. I know the population in Detroit is fading. What's your take on the lack of attendance, hostility, and loudness? -- Play Some D\n\nA: My take is that if you went to all those games during the teal years, you surely noticed that the Pistons drew less-than-capacity average crowds for eight out of nine seasons from 1993-94 through 2001-02. When it bottomed out in 1999-2000 (16,548) and 2000-01 (14,813), the crowds were every bit as bad as in recent seasons.\n\nThe home crowds for the playoffs were very good, statistical capacity crowds. Maybe it was playing from behind that dampened their enthusiasm in your view. Maybe it was that they were corporate crowds, or crowds made up of fans who don't typically attend regular-season games.\n\nRegular-season crowds have been down because the team was down but they improved some during the late-season run of home games.\n\nIt takes time to alienate a fan base and time to get it back once you do. The Pistons last season were a team that had six consecutive non-playoff season and hovered near the playoff line most of this season before ending the streak. When it happened and they got into the playoffs, the fans came out. I find none of this mysterious.\n\nQ: During last season, the point kept coming up that Andre Drummond needed to be a better rim protector (or at least more consistent). What is the most important cause of his inconsistency? Difficulty to remain focused? Indecision trying to quickly figure out what to do (e.g,staying with his man vs. protecting the lane/basket)? Is it something else (I'm assuming it's not because he doesn't care)? The broader question is how hopeful are he/the Pistons that he can develop into an elite defender to anchor their defense? Thanks. -- Ishmael\n\nA: It's both focus blips and indecision. It's working to challenge every shot you can, rather than taking a few challenges off each game. It's also a bit of trust that a teammate, most likely a guard or power forward, rotates to his man when he challenges a driver's shot.\n\nHis athleticism makes him viable defensively but when that starts to crumble, his current foundation won't support him.\n\nThe Pistons are hopeful he can be their defensive anchor and he has shown flashes that he can. He is also four years into his career, the last three of them virtually injury-free as a starter, and it hasn't become instinctive yet. Yes, that is a concern."
