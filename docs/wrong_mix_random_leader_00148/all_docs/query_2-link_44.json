        "text": "The 1984-85 Villanova Wildcats were the white-bread warriors of\n\ncollege basketball, sharpshooting overachievers who became that\n\nseason's great success story by beating powerful, Patrick\n\nEwing-led Georgetown 66-64 in a memorable NCAA final that took\n\nplace, fittingly, on April Fool's Day. The Wildcats' rumpled\n\ncoach, Rollie Massimino, was right out of central casting, a\n\nhappy paisan who coaxed miracles out of his troops on the court\n\nand served pasta to them off it. Rollie and Villanova was a love\n\naffair that seemed as if it would go on forever, like Dean and\n\nNorth Carolina or Bobby and Indiana.\n\nIt didn't. Only once in the next seven years did the Wildcats\n\nmake it deep into the postseason (they advanced to the Southeast\n\nRegional final in 1988), and twice they finished below .500.\n\nThen, after the '91-92 season, Massimino packed his bags for Las\n\nVegas, where he would add a new dimension to the phrase \"fish\n\nout of water.\" Villanova, meanwhile, turned to a Massimino\n\nprotege, Steve Lappas,--a guy whose first college job had been\n\nas an assistant on that '85 championship team--to rebuild its\n\nfortunes.\n\nConsider the Wildcats rebuilt. Lappas started slowly, with an\n\n8-19 record in 1992-93, but followed that with 20- and 25-win\n\nseasons that included an NIT championship in '94. This season,\n\nafter nonconference wins over Hofstra and Delaware last week,\n\nVillanova was 10-1 and ranked eighth in the country. It seems to\n\nhave set out on a character-building, prepare-for-April course\n\nwith impressive victories over such established teams as North\n\nCarolina (77-75) and Purdue (67-50) and slog-through-the-mud\n\ngut-wrenchers on the road over such lesser lights as Miami\n\n(70-68) and New Orleans (80-72). \"We haven't made anything look\n\neasy,\" says Wildcat All-America senior guard Kerry Kittles, \"but\n\nI promise it's not because we're overconfident. We just haven't\n\nclicked on all cylinders yet, and it's only made us realize how\n\nmuch work we have to do.\"\n\nNobody had more work to do than Lappas when he accepted the job\n\nat Villanova on April 14, 1992. The talent pool was shallow as a\n\nresult of Massimino's flagging recruiting efforts, and the\n\nWildcats were suffering from poor public relations in\n\nPhiladelphia. For most of his 19-year career at Villanova,\n\nMassimino had relied on a steady stream of good if not great\n\nplayers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, while\n\nstubbornly refusing to recruit any but the top local schoolboy\n\nplayers in Philly, whom he never got anyway. Philadelphians were\n\nalso furious with Massimino when, in the late '80s, Villanova,\n\nclaiming that its membership in the Big East caused scheduling\n\nconflicts, reduced its participation in Philly's traditional Big\n\nFive competition against LaSalle, Penn, St. Joseph's and Temple.\n\nHow much Massimino had to do with the Wildcats' decision is\n\nstill hard to determine, but he took all the heat, and the once\n\nbeloved Daddy Mass was now Public Enemy No. 1 in a town that is\n\ntough even on its favorites. When UNLV president Robert Maxson\n\ncalled on Massimino to repair the scandal-beset program left\n\nbehind by the deposed Jerry Tarkanian, the burned-out Massimino\n\nsaid, \"Whew!\" and the City of Brotherly Love said, \"Good\n\nriddance.\"\n\nWatching Massimino's slide was tough on Lappas, who left\n\nVillanova in 1988 to take his first head coaching job, at\n\nManhattan. In four years Lappas turned the Jaspers from\n\nbasketball cadavers into a 25-win team that made it to the third\n\nround of the '92 NIT. He was a natural for Villanova, having\n\nboth youth (he was 38 when he was offered the job) and ties to\n\nthe school (\"I made all the videos because I was hugging Rollie\n\nafter we beat Georgetown,\" says Lappas). Sources say that\n\nMassimino discouraged Lappas from taking the job, believing,\n\nthrough some sort of tortured logic, that it would be an act of\n\ndisloyalty, and the two rarely speak. (Massimino, who is angry\n\nabout an '87 article detailing cocaine use by Gary McLain, one\n\nof the players on the '85 championship team, refuses to talk to\n\nSI.) Lappas finds the subject of his fractured relationship with\n\nMassimino painful and won't say much about it. But he is sincere\n\nwhen he talks about the debt he owes to Massimino. \"I've never\n\nforgotten what I learned from Rollie, which is basically\n\neverything,\" says Lappas. \"I wouldn't be sitting in this chair\n\nwere it not for him.\"\n\nLappas didn't spend much time sitting after he got the Villanova\n\njob. The day after he was hired, he got on a plane to New\n\nOrleans to try to convince Kittles, who had signed with\n\nVillanova six months before with the expectation of playing for\n\nMassimino, not to jump ship. Even in their heyday, the Wildcats\n\nrarely attracted top players from outside the Northeast, and\n\nKittles, though not ranked among the top 50 players coming out\n\nof high school that year, was a key ingredient for Lappas, who\n\nfelt that Kittles was a better player than he was ranked. \"I\n\ndidn't have anything against Coach Lappas,\" says Kittles, \"I\n\njust didn't know who he was.\"\n\nLappas worked Kerry's parents hard--it helped that Villanova is a\n\nCatholic school and that Kerry's mother, Mary, had once thought\n\nabout becoming a nun and his father, Acosta, had considered the\n\nseminary. Lappas encouraged Kerry to try Villanova for a year\n\nand then transfer if he didn't like it. \"Hey, I'm not taking you\n\nto jail,\" Lappas said to Kittles. \"I'm taking you to a pretty\n\ngood school.\" Reluctantly, Kittles said he would come.\n\nLappas then flew to Buffalo to firm up the commitment of another\n\nkey Massimino recruit, swingman Eric Eberz. \"I never thought\n\nabout changing my mind,\" says Eberz, \"but it was real nice of\n\nhim to make the effort.\"\n\nLappas and the two freshmen would struggle through a painful\n\n1992-93 campaign that included a 3-16 record in the Big East and\n\nan 0-2 record in what had become an abbreviated Big Five series.\n\nNo one in Philly was calling for Massimino's return, but neither\n\nwas William Penn's statue atop city hall in jeopardy of being\n\nreplaced by one of Lappas.\n\nBut Lappas worked tirelessly at both recruiting and\n\nfence-mending, schmoozing and cajoling and worming Villanova's\n\nway back into the good graces of Philadelphia. He showed up at\n\nall the clinics, did all the luncheons, said all the right\n\nthings about the Big Five rivalry, making sure that, as he puts\n\nit, \"the distance between our campus and City Line Avenue [the\n\nborder for the city of Philadelphia] would be the three miles it\n\nis instead of the three hundred miles it had become.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy. Villanova had always been the outsider at home,\n\na suburban school on the ritzy Main Line. Lappas's pursuit of\n\nAlvin Williams, a local point guard from Germantown Academy,\n\ndemonstrates just how difficult his task was. When Lappas was on\n\nthe Villanova bench for the national championship game against\n\nGeorgetown, the 10-year-old Williams was at home in Philadelphia\n\nrooting fervently for the Hoyas. \"I had no idea Villanova was\n\neven in Philly,\" says Williams, \"and it wouldn't have mattered\n\nif I did.\" But Lappas was resolute. \"Every time I turned around\n\nat summer league games, he was there,\" says Williams--and in\n\nNovember 1992, Williams became the first Philadelphia player\n\nsince 1973 to accept a scholarship to Villanova. Now he's the\n\nWildcats' starting point guard, averaging 10.9 points and 5.6\n\nassists through Sunday.\n\nLappas had a tougher time later that season persuading another\n\nPhiladelphian, 6'11\" Jason Lawson, to stay home. Lappas's\n\nrecruiting pitch emphasized how well Lawson would team up inside\n\nwith Rasheed Wallace, the No. 1 Philly schoolboy plum who had\n\nverbally committed to the Wildcats. But just as Lawson was ready\n\nto say yes, Wallace said no, opting instead to sign a letter of\n\nintent with North Carolina. That made Lawson rethink his\n\ndecision. Only some frantic salesmanship by Lappas, particularly\n\nafter one I'm-going-to-Virginia phone call from Lawson at one in\n\nthe morning, kept him at home.\n\nStill, Villanova wouldn't be anywhere without its out-of-town\n\nseniors, Kittles and Eberz. The latter is one of the country's\n\nbest shooters, a player who, as Temple coach John Chaney puts\n\nit, \"just finds some vast land and waits for someone to find\n\nhim.\" His .415 shooting from three-point range frees up Kittles\n\nand discourages double-teaming down low on the Wildcats'\n\nmusclemen, Lawson and power forward Chuck Kornegay.\n\nKittles, meanwhile, has turned into a classic all-purpose guard,\n\na long-distance shooter and slasher on offense, a tenacious\n\nman-to-man specialist and all-court roamer in Lappas's\n\nrun-and-jump press on defense. An 84-inch wingspan and a frame\n\nwith just 3% body fat make Kittles one of the longest and most\n\nimposing 6'5\" players in the country. Since he and fellow Big\n\nEast star Ray Allen of Connecticut, could be among the top five\n\npicks in the 1996 NBA draft, these inevitable comparisons might\n\nas well be made: While Allen's classic jump shot and smooth,\n\neconomical moves suggest Michael Jordan, Kittles's rougher\n\npounce-and-glide style evokes Scottie Pippen. (There--does that\n\nput enough pressure on them?)\n\nOff the court, Kittles gradually found himself drawn to the\n\nactivities at the Catholic church on campus, St. Thomas of\n\nVillanova, where he now serves as a eucharistic minister during\n\nSunday services once a month. \"There was always a religious\n\nfeeling around my house,\" says Kittles, a former altar boy, \"and\n\nI guess I was just drawn to the church.\" (At his homecoming game\n\nin New Orleans, the most prominent Kittles fan was his aunt,\n\nCarmen, a nun, who made her way along the Wildcat bench shaking\n\nhands before the game.)\n\nKittles felt pressure to leave Villanova after last season when\n\nhe admits to having been \"consumed\" by thoughts of declaring for\n\nthe NBA draft. But after much soul-searching he realized that he\n\nwanted to get his degree in management, that he enjoyed being\n\naround his teammates and that the Wildcats had unfinished\n\nbusiness, having flamed out of last year's NCAA tournament with\n\nan 89-81 first-round loss to Old Dominion in triple overtime.\n\nCould the same thing happen to Villanova this year? Absolutely,\n\nbecause the Wildcats do have some weak spots. Though Kittles has\n\nbecome more vocal this year, he and Eberz, the obvious leaders,\n\nare by nature quiet types, and Williams, the point guard, admits\n\nthat he's not always sure when to take charge. And now both\n\nLawson and Kornegay are playing while wearing invisible\n\nhandcuffs as the result of a melee late in the first half of a\n\n70-63 win over Bradley on Nov. 29. Under the NCAA's stringent\n\nnew rules designed to curb fighting, if either player becomes\n\ninvolved in another fracas, he will be suspended for the rest of\n\nthe season. Then, too, Kittles has not yet played like the Big\n\nEast Player of the Year he was a season ago, particularly from\n\nthe perimeter--he is shooting only 42%, considerably below last\n\nseason's 52%. Still, whenever Villanova has needed something\n\nextra, Kittles has supplied it: 13 rebounds in a 77-65 win over\n\nSanta Clara in Maui; 28 points, 10 rebounds and four steals in\n\nan 83-68 win over St. John's; an acrobatic catch and\n\nbuzzer-beating layup against Miami; 30 points and several clutch\n\nshots in his return-of-the-native game in New Orleans. If\n\nVillanova is to make it far into the postseason, everyone knows\n\nthe minister will have to be out front, sending a message to the\n\nmasses.\n\nAt the beginning of last season Villanova invited back its\n\nchampionship team for a 10-year reunion that was both a\n\ncelebration of the past and a call to the future. Massimino\n\nopted not to attend, but all of the other 1985 heroes were\n\nthere, along with most of the key players on this year's team.\n\n\"This is a different generation of players, so I don't dwell on\n\nthe past,\" says Lappas. \"But the subject does come up from time\n\nto time. I think it's important they realize that there is a\n\nfoundation here for winning it all.\" Says Eberz, \"We didn't\n\nfollow that '85 team, but we all know this is a place where\n\nmagic happened once. And it can happen again.\"\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: V.J. LOVERO Among Kittles's multiple talents is an ability to burst to the fore on the break.
