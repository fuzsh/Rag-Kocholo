        "text": "Among other things, the Celtics suffered from their first serious lack of poise since the first round against Miami, when Kevin Garnett served a one-game suspension for his ejection after elbowing the Heat’s Quentin Richardson.\n\nThe Celtics forward was whistled for his third technical last night early in the third quarter after getting into an argument under the basket with several members of the Magic in the 96-92 overtime loss.\n\nGarnett finally pushed away Matt Barnes, who appeared to be attempting to calm Garnett down.\n\nGarnett’s technical actually appeared to push the Celtics emotionally in the short run, but when Rasheed Wallace was whistled for his fourth T of the postseason early in the fourth, the C’s fortunes went south. J.J. Redick’s free throw gave Orlando a three-point lead (71-68), and Redick came back with a 3-pointer seconds later.\n\nThe postseason limit before suspensions take effect is six technical fouls.\n\nRondo’s subpar\n\nRajon Rondo played with his jammed middle right finger taped to his ring finger, and his finishing ability showed. Rondo, in foul trouble much of the night, shot 3-for-10 on the way to nine points and eight assists.\n\nHe also reportedly suffered from a brief muscle spasm in the first half, though it wasn’t serious enough for anyone to make coach Doc Rivers aware of the problem.\n\n“I didn’t even know,” said Rivers. “I knew early on that he was fatigued. I think he told (trainer) Eddie (Lacerte). But when I came in at halftime he said he was good. If the trainer comes to you, you know it’s something serious. If not, you just let it go.”\n\nDraft update\n\nThe Celtics should be looking at a decent talent when they go on the clock with the 19th pick in next month’s NBA draft.\n\nDanny Ainge, who walked away from last week’s Chicago pre-draft camp with the same frustrations as every other general manager over the number of players who refused to work out, still knows that much. He knew it before the camp even started.\n\n“I think it’s a deep draft because of all the underclassmen who came out,” Ainge said of a situation that may have been spurred by uncertainty over the collective bargaining agreement, which expires after next season.\n\n“We knew most of these guys already just by seeing them over the years,” he said. “The camp helps you to see if there have been any changes in the physical appearance on any of the players.”\n\nTo wit, Kentucky forward DeMarcus Cousins reportedly registered the second highest body fat content in the field. Maybe he’ll slide.\n\nBut until then, Ainge said he is currently interested in “about 18 guys”\n\nPerson of interest\n\nWith associate coach Tom Thibodeau such a hot commodity – he’s the top candidate in New Orleans and has interest from Chicago, too, the defensive performances turned in by this team have become top-notch resume material.\n\n“Tom is a student,” said Rivers. “I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a coach work as hard or study as hard as he does. And we also have a great crew. We weren’t as good without Kevin Garnett last year. We had lost our defensive captain. But Kevin believes in Tom, and that allows us to all do our parts.\n\n“(San Antonio coach) Gregg Popovich talks about that all of the time with Tim Duncan,” he said. “When he believes, everyone else follows.”"
