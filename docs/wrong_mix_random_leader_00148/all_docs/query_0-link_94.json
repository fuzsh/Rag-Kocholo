        "text": "Honor Strength Class Allan Houston and AG. in South Philly\n\n\"Study to show thyself approved unto GOD...\"\n\n2 Timothy 2:15\n\nBasketball is my favorite sport to play. Whereas baseball is the game that I prefer to watch on television...however if I had to pick one sport, then it would have to be basketball. Sports are such a metaphor for life and nothing speaks to my lifetime like basketball...the holy game.\n\nGOD’S SON\n\nDuring my junior year at Temple University, the Office of Student Activities had a trip to Madison Square Garden for a NBA preseason game. It was a day of shopping and exploring in New York City, with the Philadelphia 76ers against the New York Knicks in the nightcap.\n\nI love the NBA. It’s the epitome of the game I love, so instead of being satisfied with my super affordable $10 ticket which included travel and admission to the game, I wanted more...I wanted a job with the New York Knicks.\n\nI’ve never been complacent, I have always looked for opportunities that I could succeed and excel in. That said, I began studying the Knicks, and their organization. Upon further review I found a contact and I began to ask her questions about her job. She was both friendly and helpful, as it had never dawned on me that a position with an actual NBA team was something that was not only attainable, but it was also within my reach.\n\nShe and I agreed to meet upon my arrival to the game, so while my friends walked in and looked around for girls, hot dogs, and sodas, I was looking for the media press entrance on 33rd and 8th Avenue. I walked in, and I must have looked like a deer in headlights, because I was immediately greeted with “Hi, you must be Anthony. I’m Jeannette.”\n\nThat game, and that meeting with Jeannette, was the building block for my career in professional basketball. With her help, and my focus and desire, I enjoyed an internship with the New York Knicks and New York Liberty the following semester, beginning in May 2000, ending in September of the same year. What I learned, and who I met in that time, has shaped, and molded me into the journalist that I am today. The saying in New York City is, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, and I am proof of how true that really is.\n\nWorking for the Knickerbockers was a dream come true, as I have long been a fan of Allan Houston. Aside from his text-book jump shot, GQ fashion look and style off the court, he is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated. I too am a member, so in this capacity he has become a brother, role model, and example of what a family man could and should be. When I started working, the team was in the midst of the NBA Playoffs, so not only is it an exciting time, here I was front and center for every home game. In the ensuing weeks, Allan Houston and I became friends, and while I patterned my game after his, and became extremely flattered anytime the girls would say that I looked like him, I always tried to fight my sheer emotions of joy whenever I was around him, because I didn’t want to look like a groupie or the like. I don’t think he would care, because he is a very genuine person, but where I’m from, that’s not cool, and would be considered bad behavior.\n\nOver the summer I had heard that Houston was going to come out of retirement and give the NBA another go. Once I heard that, I’ve looked forward to last Friday’s pre season game, pitting the Philadelphia 76ers against the New York Knicks...I guess some things never change.\n\nOne of my good friends and fraternity brothers, Jeff Young covered the game with me. He too is a fan of Allan Houston, so it was only right that I introduced him. Coincidentally, Chris Broussard from ESPN, was there too, as he is also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated. It really is a small world, and in this case...membership has great privileges.\n\nJeff and I ventured into the visitor’s locker room. After the introductions and secret handshake, I asked Allan a few questions, while trying to remain as cool, calm, and collected as possible. I don’t know why, but he is one of 2 people that I’m always excited to see, and interview...anyone else, its just business, never personal.\n\nHere is the score on our conversation:\n\nWill you be with the organization in one way on the court, or in the front office in another?\n\n“I mean, I really haven’t gotten to that point yet. Eventually when I finish playing, I think that is something I would love to think about or consider, but I’ve worked so hard to be on the court, so I don’t want to get ahead of myself. I think yeah, eventually down the line.”\n\nWhere did you play to get ready for the season?\n\n“I played at [Nike] Pro City...a little bit of everywhere this summer, but it’s been a rough process, but it taught me a lot of patience, a lot of trust. Sometimes you want something bad enough and you think you are walking the way of where God wants you to be...you just gotta keep going. You can’t doubt it, you have to keep going, that’s all I’ve done, and I’m just looking forward to seeing what’s going to happen.”\n\nWas it a matter of coming back to New York...could you have gone somewhere else?\n\n“The reality is, I don’t even know? The way the conversation with Donnie Walsh and the organization went...it just made sense. You stay here, be home with family, and remain with the Knicks organization, that I’ve been identified with and it’s been so good to me...and it’s New York. I look at it like, the economy is going to turn around, so why not jump in when it’s on its on the way up? It’s the same thing with this organization; hopefully I can be here when it starts to climb back up. Everybody is excited about the direction.”\n\nTalk about your time on ESPN as an analyst:\n\n“It was a good experience for me. I learned a lot about the other side of the game in terms of analyzing and the presentation of the game. It was hard because I always looked at it from a player’s eye, and I think that’s what people wanted and respected, but it was hard for me to be really critical, because I’m still looking at it from a player’s perspective, I was still seeing myself as a player out there, which worked in some ways and some ways it might not have. All in all it was a great experience. I liked it, but I wasn’t sure if it was a long term passionate goal for me. Because when I do something, I go all out and I commit to it, and I was thinking if I could do this in 5 to10 years...and I couldn’t give myself a definitive yes to that. Sometimes you just know that your heart is in the locker room with the players, and being able to play, be around the game, whether it’s coaching or some other way, and that’s the way I felt.”\n\nTell me about you changing your number from 20 to 14 and how that speaks to the relationship with your father:\n\n[Pauses] \"Man, that’s a very good question, I’m glad you asked me that. My dad, our relationship has so many dynamics to it. He was my coach in college, I admired him as a role model growing up, I just looked up to him, and I wanted to be just like him. I saw how people respected him, how he treated people, how he worked, but the biggest thing the reason it means a lot to me is because of who he is as a man. As a person of character and integrity and that’s the one thing I’ve tried to carry in the legacy that he left me. As I look at the stage of career that I’m in now, it’s about legacy, it’s about what is it that I can pass on? Whatever he gave to me, that’s what I want to pass on. Whether it’s here or off the court, or my son, so to me it’s about legacy. So even on my website, www.allanhouston.com we talk about a father-son basketball retreat for a week. We talk about that importance of a man’s role in his house and we use basketball and sports to do it. So it was just really fitting, everything works together for the right time at the right reason and me being able to wear that number kind of capped it all off, everything that we had already been doing.”\n\nPeople's Champ\n\nWisdom from Chamberlain and Sonny Hill\n\nDesire\n\n'Sheed and AG. in North Philadelphia\n\nIconic\n\n\"You ain't ballin', you pump fakin'...\"\n\nBeanie Sigel - One Shot Deal (Feat. Redman)\n\nLast night while driving home from my workout, I turned on 610AM WIP...the Philadelphia all-sports talk radio station. Ike at Night was on and the topic was the players only meeting called by Donovan McNabb. After a good 20 minutes, Ike changed gears to the NBA, and how Rasheed Wallace although slightly off center, is one of the best basketball talents the league has seen. I thought it was sort of a backhanded comment, so I think I'll tune in tonight and call in.\n\nThe talk of 'Sheed, and the upcoming NBA season, made me think back to when I started taking journalism seriously, and my first interview with Wallace. I attended his free basketball camp back in '02, and not only was I accepted as a member of the family, I learned a lot about the oft misunderstood gentle giant.\n\nThe following story never ran as I wrote it to sharpen my journalistic knives:\n\nLike him or dislike him, Rasheed Wallace is a man on a mission. The two-time NBA All-Star (2000, 2001), whom enjoyed a stellar career at the University of North Carolina, and was a High School All-America (National Player of the Year 1993) he often stands misunderstood. However Rasheed Wallace is all about his family, basketball, and the community, which he best serves through the Rasheed A. Wallace Foundation. With the foundation he is able to provide the community with a positive outlet, basketball, knowledge, and an example of a hard worker, and devoted family man.\n\nPhiladelphia, PA, Simon Gratz H.S., 17th & Hunting Park Avenue – Summer time in North Philadelphia means a lot of things, but to Rasheed Wallace it means giving back to the community. During the week of July 2 – July 6 (excluding July 4th) Rasheed Wallace presented his annual free basketball camp to the masses that was North Philly. “Giving back to the community is very important. I see it as a reaction, a necessity if you will to give back to the community. Everybody isn’t going to make it to the NBA, so I try to provide various speakers at my camp. For instance my cousin is a police officer, and he came to speak to the campers. I also bring in lawyers, coaches, players, and people from all professions.” Says Wallace as people of ages cling to him like the sweat drenched camp T-shirt on the backs of everyone present. Jacqueline Wallace thinks the world of her son, as she takes a break from camp director/camp mother to reflect upon him. “I think that it’s fantastic that he is community oriented. The camp was his idea and it is funded for and sponsored by various outlets including him. He is a good guy, I love him and being an NBA player with the funds that he has, he has not changed. He is the same person that he has always been. I like the camaraderie that he has with his brothers (Muhammed Wallace, Malcolm Wallace, Ryan Tabb, and Michael Tabb) and he is a genuine family man.” You can take the man out of the ‘hood but you can’t take the ‘hood out of the man. Not to say that is a bad thing but Rasheed Wallace is as real as any NBA superstar can get. People drive by and beep the horn as he waves back while sitting on the steps of his former high school, signing autographs as he once did as an adolescent. Surrounded by family, former coaches (Bill Ellerbee, and Roland Wharton), friends and the neighborhood that he dearly loves, he stands tall at 6’11” 225 lbs, he stands taller as one of Philadelphia’s favorite sons. The Rasheed A. Wallace Foundation was established in 1997 to promote programs that enhance the quality of life for everyone, and helps to assist in the recreational and educational development of youth in Philadelphia, PA, Portland, OR, Durham, NC, and other selected communities where he has resided.\n\nWhen asked about the benefits of the basketball camp Rasheed replied, “I try to give the campers the knowledge that they can be successful in other things than basketball. If I can reach out to one person then I can reach out to others. Besides that I want to teach basketball and give people the opportunity to become better players.” Former high school teammate and Temple University standout, Lynard Stewart came by for a fun filled week of basketball and life skills as he exclaimed, “We played high school basketball together. I figured that I should get involved it’s like a family thing. Besides I live up the street so I wanted to get involved and work with the kids.”\n\nFriday, July 5, 2002 - last day of the camp, and the campers were delighted to be entertained by a camp counselor game versus various wanabees. The campers, parents, and fans alike were privy not only to the game in which Rasheed Wallace’s team won, but a post-game slam-dunk contest. Rasheed Wallace was forced to bring out the best dunks as he was challenged ferociously by 20 year-old Mike Keys, 1999 graduate of De La Salle H.S., also in Philadelphia, PA. “It was just for fun. Basketball is everything. It is my life, and it comes before mostly everything”, says Keys as the crowd cheered him on as if it was the slam-dunk contest sponsored by the NBA.\n\nSaturday, July 6, 2002 - brought an end to the festivities for the week as the campers and their family members were invited to a barbeque in near by Hunting Park with Rasheed Wallace and his family. Everything was free of charge of course, as Rasheed would not have it any other way. “I try to give an uplifting spirit to the community. I have a few business ventures and I want to provide for the people of North Philadelphia”, Wallace expressed and when asked about his future and the community he spoke very candidly and said, “Preferably good things are in store for the future. I’m the type of person to live day by day. I may want to put up a few buildings or create jobs in North Philly. When people think of North Philly they think of burned down buildings and drugs, but if we build it up then we can make things better for living.” This is Rasheed’s mission and he is ready and set like North Philadelphia is depending on him. Rasheed Wallace has not let Philadelphia down in anything that he has done and at this rate he never will.\n\nWatch these videos for more on Rasheed Wallace:"
