        "text": "The earthquake that rumbled through the Pacific Northwest last\n\nweek sent a sizable portion of Portland's workforce scrambling\n\nfor cover at their places of employment, but the Trail Blazers\n\nwere not among them. \"I didn't feel a thing,\" said guard Steve\n\nSmith of the temblor that struck as the team was about to begin\n\na workout at its practice facility. \"It didn't seem as if\n\nanything around me was moving that wasn't supposed to be moving.\"\n\nMaybe it was merely that tremors feel normal to Portland, a team\n\nthat lives on an emotional fault line. Although the Blazers had\n\nmaintained their equilibrium well enough to put together a 42-18\n\nrecord through Sunday, best in the Western Conference, there's no\n\ntelling how long their foundation will hold up. Several players'\n\ndiscontent over their minutes and the burden of coping with star\n\nforward Rasheed Wallace's lack of self-control have made Portland\n\nthe edgiest team in the league. \"This team is so good and so\n\ndeep, but sometimes it doesn't look as if guys enjoy themselves,\"\n\nsays veteran forward Detlef Schrempf. \"I'd like to see us have\n\nmore fun.\"\n\nThe locker room certainly wasn't a barrel of laughs after a 94-81\n\nwin over the Los Angeles Clippers last week. In one corner an\n\nirritated Damon Stoudamire, the Blazers' point guard, was\n\npointedly declaring to reporters that he had no animosity toward\n\nRod Strickland, the point guard who had been waived by the\n\nWashington Wizards and who would sign with the Blazers on Monday.\n\n\"There's no rift between me and Rod, and there isn't going to be\n\none,\" Stoudamire said. Still, he didn't sound as if he were\n\nlooking forward to the loss of playing time that Strickland's\n\narrival probably will cause. \"I mean, what am I supposed to do,\n\nthrow a big tantrum or something?\" said Stoudamire. \"It wouldn't\n\ndo any good. They're going to bring in who they want to bring in.\n\nIt doesn't matter what I want.\"\n\nIn another corner of the room, Smith was leaving no doubt that he\n\nwasn't exactly thrilled at having lost his starting spot at\n\nshooting guard to Bonzi Wells in December. \"I'll never get used\n\nto it,\" Smith said. \"Sometimes you have to make sacrifices, and\n\nif this is the way it's got to be for us to win the title, then\n\ngreat. But if we don't....\"\n\nIf they don't?\n\n\"You finish the sentence,\" Smith said with a slight smile.\n\nPower forward Dale Davis can sympathize with Smith and\n\nStoudamire. Davis, who skipped a practice in December to protest\n\nhaving seen only five minutes of action in a 109-104 victory\n\nover the Los Angeles Lakers, still has issues concerning his\n\nreduced playing time. Asked where he was headed as he left the\n\nlocker room one night last week, Davis replied, \"I'm going over\n\nto the rec league to get some [playing time].\"\n\nOne of the big men with whom he is sharing minutes is Shawn Kemp,\n\nlike Davis a former All-Star. Though Kemp still lugs around at\n\nleast 25 extra pounds, he has played effectively in short\n\nstretches lately, which is encouraging to coach Mike Dunleavy but\n\ncould have a negative effect on Davis's disposition.\n\nDunleavy dismisses the occasional expression of dissatisfaction\n\nas the trade-off for having such an impressive assemblage of\n\ntalent, \"a traveling All-Star squad,\" as Schrempf calls it. \"It's\n\nalways tough,\" Dunleavy says, \"particularly when you have guys\n\nwho have been the star in other places and are accustomed to\n\ngetting a certain number of minutes and shots. Guys' moods change\n\nall the time in a system like this. You talk to them one week and\n\nthey're more or less O.K., but by the next week their attitude\n\nhas changed.\"\n\nThe Blazers would surely welcome a change in the 6'11\" Wallace's\n\nattitude toward referees. The irrational anger he directs at them\n\nputs Portland in a precarious position--its only indispensable\n\nplayer is also the one most likely to leave the team in the lurch\n\nbecause of his temper. Wallace set an NBA season record with 38\n\ntechnical fouls in 1999-00, and had six ejections, but compared\n\nwith this season, he was practically Miss Manners last year.\n\nApparently he wants to set a record for T's that will be as\n\nenduring as Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. Through\n\nSunday, Wallace had already amassed 32 technicals and been thrown\n\nout of four games. In a memorable meltdown against the Phoenix\n\nSuns on Feb. 1, he earned an ejection, a two-game suspension and\n\na $10,000 fine for tossing a towel in the face of referee Gary\n\nBenson. Wallace was so enraged at his dismissal that several\n\nplayers and members of the coaching staff had to restrain him\n\nfrom going after Benson again. \"I got my share of technicals as a\n\nplayer, but tonight was one of the worst I've ever seen,\" Suns\n\ncoach Scott Skiles said.\n\nIt's impossible to measure the psychological toll that Wallace's\n\noutbursts take on his teammates and Dunleavy. Even though they\n\nhave become accomplished spin doctors on the subject of his\n\ntechnical fouls, it's obvious that trying to keep Wallace under\n\ncontrol is draining. \"I've had more talks with him about it than\n\nI care to count,\" Dunleavy said last week, leaning wearily\n\nagainst a wall at the team's practice facility. \"When you talk to\n\nhim, he sees there's no benefit in getting into it so much with\n\nthe referees. But then he gets in a game and he feels as if he's\n\nbeen wronged somehow, and the logic goes out the window.\"\n\nSeveral teammates contend that his tantrums will disappear as he\n\nmatures, but Wallace is 26, old enough to make that theory appear\n\nto be wishful thinking. If anything, he's discovering new ways to\n\nact out (witness the towel toss). Wallace declined to discuss his\n\nbehavior for this article, but he made his feelings about his\n\ncritics clear during All-Star weekend. \"I don't care what you all\n\nthink about me, because you're not in my inner circle,\" he told\n\nreporters. \"The only people I care about are my wife and kids, my\n\nmom, my brother and close friends of the family. Anybody outside\n\nmy circle, I could care less.\"\n\nSome members of his family would love to see him exhibit more\n\ncontrol. As Wallace leaves home and heads for the arena, his\n\nwife, Fatima, often urges him to keep his cool, and his mother,\n\nJackie, has done the same in phone conversations with him from\n\nher house in Durham, N.C. None of Wallace's supporters, however,\n\nhave figured out why the sight of a striped shirt so frequently\n\nmakes him see red. \"People ask me all the time, 'Why can't\n\nRasheed learn to lay off the refs?'\" says Dunleavy. \"My answer is\n\nthat most people know they have some habit they really should\n\nbreak, but they can't do it. You might know you should skip the\n\ndesserts and lose a few pounds, yet for some reason you can't\n\nmanage it. Rasheed knows he shouldn't argue with refs so much,\n\nbut for whatever reason, he hasn't been able to stop himself.\"\n\nThe Blazers and their fans have a seemingly endless supply of\n\npatience where Wallace is concerned. Their exasperation with him\n\nis outweighed by their affection for him, and the crowd at the\n\nRose Garden seems to root for him to keep his composure as much\n\nas it does for him to hit a jumper. When Wallace argued with a\n\nref in last week's Clippers game, a fan tried to soothe him from\n\nthe stands. \"It's all right, Sheed,\" he yelled. \"Just chill, just\n\nchill.\"\n\nPart of the reason Wallace gets as much support as he does is\n\nthat while his on-court behavior has never been worse, his play\n\nhas never been better. At week's end he was on a pace to set\n\ncareer highs in points (20.1 per game), rebounds (8.1), assists\n\n(2.7), steals (1.2) and blocked shots (1.8), and he has added\n\nthree-point shooting (36 of 106) to his repertoire this season.\n\nWallace has emerged as the equal of any power forward in the\n\nleague, with superior fundamentals in the low post, long arms\n\nthat make his jump shot virtually impossible to block and an\n\nunselfishness rarely found in a player of his caliber. Through\n\nSunday he was taking only 15.8 shots per game. \"A lot of guys say\n\nthey don't care about stats, but Rasheed backs it up with the way\n\nhe plays,\" says Smith. \"If we win, he's just as happy in the\n\nlocker room if he scored 10 points as he is if he scored 30.\"\n\nThe irony for the Blazers is that they lack a forceful\n\nlocker-room leader who might persuade Wallace to tone down his\n\ntantrums and that Wallace, because of his talent, his\n\nteam-oriented attitude and the respect he engenders from his\n\npeers, has all the ingredients to be that leader. Veterans like\n\nforward Scottie Pippen have confronted Wallace about his\n\noutbursts, but for the most part his teammates have tried,\n\nunconvincingly, to downplay the effects of his behavior. They\n\ncontend that Wallace has never cost them an important game, but\n\nhe was ejected in the third quarter of the Blazers' Game 1 loss\n\nto the Lakers in the Western Conference finals last year, a\n\nseries Portland lost in seven. During Wallace's two-game\n\nsuspension in February, the Blazers dropped a game to the lowly\n\nClippers. In the tight battle for playoff seeding in the Western\n\nConference, that game may seem much more significant at season's\n\nend than it did at the time.\n\nAlthough he can be a menacing figure on the court, Wallace also\n\nhas his share of jovial moments. Against the Clippers last week\n\nhe was almost all smiles, joking during stoppages in play with\n\nL.A. point guard Jeff McInnis, a former teammate at North\n\nCarolina. \"Million-dollar move and a 10-cent shot,\" he yelled,\n\nchuckling, after McInnis failed to convert on a drive. His\n\ndemeanor, though, can turn dark in a heartbeat, and he pushes\n\nreferees until they have no choice but to give him a technical.\n\nBeing warned that he's close to a T seems to add fuel to his\n\nfire, and Wallace will stalk an official as if he's trying to\n\nfind out how close.\n\nDunleavy has done his best to head off Wallace's eruptions before\n\nthey occur. \"When I see him getting into it with a ref, I've\n\ntried talking to him during the game, I've tried taking him out\n\nof the game, I've tried calling timeout,\" Dunleavy says. \"I can't\n\nsay any of those things have worked. I probably get half of my\n\ntechnicals trying to beat him to the punch.\"\n\nDunleavy believes that although Wallace's complaints to the\n\nreferees are too strident, he usually has a valid argument. That\n\nmay be true, but it's also true that the refs have shown no\n\nevidence of the animosity toward Wallace that he suspects them\n\nof. \"The guy can actually be very funny with some of the things\n\nhe says,\" says a referee who asked not to be named. \"It's not as\n\nif we're looking to T him up. If anything, I think most guys give\n\nhim a little bit longer rope because we know he's a competitive\n\nguy who tends to get worked up. When he gets a technical, it's\n\nbecause he's earned it.\"\n\nMany Blazers express confidence that Wallace won't lose control\n\nat a crucial moment in this year's playoffs, but it's hard to\n\nfathom what basis there might be for that belief. The\n\nrationalizing and excuse-making that the Portland organization\n\nhas offered in his defense certainly haven't helped him address\n\nhis problem. There is no telling how Wallace would react to\n\ntougher in-house treatment--being made to watch a tape of his most\n\nover-the-top outbursts, for instance--but the gentle approach\n\nobviously isn't working. The Blazers would risk alienating their\n\nstar by taking a harder line, but considering the escalating\n\nnumber and intensity of his outbursts, the team may be taking a\n\nbigger gamble if it doesn't.\n\nThat's the danger in continuing to live on a fault line. Sooner\n\nor later, the smaller tremors give way to one big quake, the\n\nkind that destroys everything.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY ROCKY WIDNER/NBA ENTERTAINMENT Driving force Wallace has become the equal of any power forward in the game.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: JOHN W.
