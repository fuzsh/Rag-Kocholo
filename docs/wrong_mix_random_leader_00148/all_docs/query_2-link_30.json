I was shot in the face by accident on April 5th, 1988. You go through something like that it’s going to do one of two things, it’s going to make you fearful or fearless. It made me fearless.” pic.twitter.com/0VebrSai6f – 3:32 PM\n\nMike Bresnahan @Mike_Bresnahan\n\nDarvin Ham just shared a revealing anecdote when asked if he felt pressure about taking the Lakers job.\n\nHe said he was accidentally shot as a teenager in 1988 and had to decide whether he’d be “fearful or fearless” after that.\n\nSafe to say he didn’t choose fearful. – 3:32 PM\n\nKamenetzky Brothers @KamBrothers\n\nInteresting. Darvin Ham says that ever since he left the Lakers staff and joined Budenholzer’s, the Lakers have been his scouting assignment. So he’s particularly familiar with what they’ve done over the last near decade. AK – 3:31 PM\n\nMike Trudell @LakersReporter\n\nAsked a question about feeling pressure as the new Lakers coach, Darvin Ham cited when he was shot by a stray bullet as a kid, and said that either makes you fearfull or fearless. He’s fearless. Pressure doesn’t come from hoops. It’s a challenge he’s excited about. – 3:29 PM\n\nBryan Kalbrosky @BryanKalbrosky\n\nLakers coach Darvin Ham:\n\n“I grew up in Saginaw, Michigan. I was shot in the face by accident … You go through something like that, it’s going to do one of two things. It’s going to make you fearful or fearless. It made me fearless. I don’t feel no pressure. It’s basketball.” – 3:28 PM\n\nRyan Ward @RyanWardLA\n\nDarvin Ham: “I talked to LeBron in my first day in the gym and I wanted to start training camp the next day.” – 3:25 PM\n\nMike Trudell @LakersReporter\n\nDarvin Ham said he had several productive discussions with Russell Westbrook, and he initial operative word is “Sacrifice.”\n\nThat extends to LeBron, AD and the rest of the roster as well, and starts defensively. – 3:25 PM\n\nMarc Stein @TheSteinLine\n\nAs covered in this NBA Finals preview last week, Darvin Ham interviewed with NINE other teams before the Lakers hired him as head coach:\n\nmarcstein.substack.com/p/nba-finals-p…\n\n“I’m good … trust me,” Ham just said, thanking those teams for passing on him so he could land with the Lakers. – 3:24 PM\n\nKamenetzky Brothers @KamBrothers\n\nDarvin Ham said he’s had conversations with Westbrook, and one of the big themes was “sacrifice,” but noted this isn’t singular to Russ. It applies to LeBron and everyone down the roster.
