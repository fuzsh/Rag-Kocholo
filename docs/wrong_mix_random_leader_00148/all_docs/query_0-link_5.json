        "text": "MIAMI – Rasheed Wallace being fined by the NBA, as he was Thursday, hardly qualifies as breaking news anymore.\n\n“It’s like the sun coming up lately,” Celtics coach Doc Rivers said yesterday. “You wake up and Rasheed’s fined.”\n\nWallace’s latest deduction was a $35,000 hit for publicly criticizing game officials. That brings his out-of-game fine total to an even $100,000 this season.\n\nAnd when you throw in the automatic fines for his technical fouls – an ascending scale – he’s provided $121,500 to charitable organizations designated by the league.\n\nThe real crime here would seem to be that Wallace hasn’t been given one of those NBA Cares Man of the Year awards.\n\n“Well, he’s buying the trophy if nothing else,” Rivers said.\n\nWhile other players set up foundations to raise money and otherwise donate other people’s dough, Wallace opens his own wallet.\n\n“The funny thing about it though is they won’t let you know who they send it to,” Wallace said. “I looked into all that before when I was in Portland. They won’t tell you who they send it to, and they won’t let you pick the charity.”\n\nIn other words, when Sally Struthers comes on TV at 3 in the morning and asks you to send money to needy children around the world, at least you get a picture of the kid you’re helping.\n\n“Yeah,” Sheed said.\n\nWallace latest fine was either for saying referees were baiting him with early fouls in Game 1 or for saying Dwyane Wade gets calls because the NBA wants him playing to bolster television ratings. Or maybe for both.\n\nWallace isn’t perturbed in the least.\n\n“It’s silly,” he said. “I didn’t say nothing about nobody. I didn’t talk about certain things. I just said it was a business for the most part, which it is. So I get fined for it.\n\n“I ain’t worried about it though. It ain’t going to stop me from going out here and doing what I got to do. That’s the main objective. All they’re trying to do is throw up distractions, but that ain’t going to work. I’m focused; we’re focused. Bottom line.”\n\nThe league figures to hear more from Wallace. He plans to appeal the fines.\n\n“Oh, for sure,” he said. “For sure. The thing is, they’re quick to fine me, but when I send an e-mail or my agent calls up there about my technicals and all that (expletive), I get no replies back.\n\n“But I ain’t worried about that. I’m just going to go out and hoop. I’m more concerned about D-Wade than I am about those cats. This is my job.”\n\nRivers has no plans to try to calm Wallace down.\n\n“No,” said the coach. “Hell no. The horse is out of the barn, so I’m not going to spend any time on that.\n\n“It’s his money.”\n\nPaul Pierce was saying much the same thing when he looked at the Wallace penalties and said, “That’s fine. Rasheed really doesn’t spend money on anything anyway.\n\n“He’s not a guy that goes out and buys jewelry, buys clothes. So that’s his one way of splurging.”\n\nOver at the NBA offices, the accountants are kept busy.\n\n“Rasheed alone is an individual hedge fund for the league,” Rivers said."
