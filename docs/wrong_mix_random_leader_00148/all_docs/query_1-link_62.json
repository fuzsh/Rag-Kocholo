        "text": "Kevin Garnett was drafted by the Timberwolves with the No. 5 pick in the 1995 draft. That meant he went one pick after the Bullets, who selected Rasheed Wallace with the No. 4 pick.\n\nNow, a list of every player that every team could have taken and didn’t would be pretty boring. But it turns out the Bullets scouted Garnett in the run-up to that draft, and were impressed, but went in another direction after owner Abe Pollin said he didn’t want to take a high-school kid. At least that’s the story offered by then-GM John Nash, who spoke to Howard Beck as part of his oral history of Garnett.\n\n“I came away from the workout going, ‘Wow, this guy’s going to be a great player,’ and came back to Washington and huddled with our owner (Abe Pollin). I explained to him that we liked a lot of players at the top of that draft — Joe Smith and McDyess, and Stackhouse and Rasheed. I said, ‘You know, Mr. Pollin, there’s this high school kid. I want to tell you, he might be special.’ He said, ‘John, that’s OK, I would prefer it if we didn’t draft somebody right out of high school.’ I said, ‘Mr. Pollin, you’re making my job easier, because I would have wrestled with the decision.’ “\n\nNow, The Post covered Wallace and Garnett and the Bullets’ decision quite a bit in the run-up to that draft, which seems worth revisiting. A few days before the draft, Tony Kornheiser said that Garnett shouldn’t be the pick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome draft geeks think Garnett could go as high as No. 4. The last time I looked No. 4 was where Les Boulez picked. If the Bullets were an expansion team and had time on their side — no fair pointing out they play like an expansion team — Garnett might be the right pick; you can take a flyer on an 19-year-old when nobody expects you to do anything for five years. But the Bullets don’t have the luxury of waiting that long to see if Garnett turns out fabulous, like Moses Malone, or regrettable, like Bill Willoughby. John Nash and Jim Lynam had better have something good going on by the time the Bullets move into the new arena, or they might not be moving with them….\n\nSo Garnett doesn’t make sense for the Bullets — unless they take him to trade him for, say, B.J. Armstrong and Toronto’s No. 7 pick. That was one of the many trade rumors that have been circulating around the Bullets in the last month: Armstrong and No. 7 for Rex Chapman and No. 4. I would make that trade because although Armstrong is not a classic point guard, he is a great three-point shooter, and the Rockets proved how valuable great three-point shooting can be. I’m aware of the Bullets’ urgent need for a point guard, but Webber and Juwan Howard are such good passers that Armstrong’s skills may be just fine. Furthermore, Big Country Reeves or Cherokee Parks will be available at No. 7, and either would help the Bullets at center, their second-neediest position.\n\nImagine if they had traded beneath Garnett to take Cherokee Parks. Reminder: never express a strong opinion about sports, because you will one day look bad.\n\nElsewhere in The Post, Bullets assistant GM Chuck Douglas called Garnett “a good athlete who has some explosiveness, but he [also] has basketball skills.” Douglas said the team didn’t usually scout high schoolers but had requested videotape of Garnett after word spread about his talent, and he wasn’t concerned about his size.\n\n“Obviously whichever team takes him is taking a bit of a gamble, looking down the road a little for a future investment,” Douglas said. “But he’s only a year younger than Joe Smith, who could be the number one pick, and he’s probably only about six months younger than [Wake Forest center] Tim Duncan, and he would have been the number one pick had he come out. He’s not that far behind basketball-wise from those guys either. He would be a little behind in terms of maturity — both physically and emotionally.\n\n“What you have to do is weigh the two or three guys you’re considering picking against Garnett. If it’s close, you might opt for the more mature guy with the more proven track record. But if you feel Garnett is much better, you probably have to go with him.”\n\nA few days before the draft, The Post’s Richard Justice reported that Wallace was Washington’s likely pick. Nash said he was still open to a trade, but he praised Wallace as “an immense talent” and said the talent level dropped off after the fourth pick, with one exception.\n\n“That’s Kevin Garnett,” he said, “and he’s going to have some serious obstacles to overcome in just making the transition from high school to the NBA.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the week, Nash said he would be happy “with any of the top four sophomores that fall to us,” meaning Wallace, Smith, Jerry Stackhouse and Antonio McDyess. They wound up with Wallace, and everyone was thrilled. More Justice:\n\nBefore picking Wallace, Nash held trade discussions with several teams, most notably Portland about veteran point guard Rod Strickland, right up until the start of the draft. In the end, he rejected them and then waited nervously to see if the No. 2-ranked player on Washington’s board — Jerry Stackhouse was first — would slip to them. After Joe Smith, Antonio McDyess and Stackhouse became the first three picks, Nash quickly used the fourth selection on Wallace.\n\n“He’s going to be a great addition to our front line,” Nash said. “Things are looking up. He’s a big-time talent. He’s going to be a terrific transition player, a good outlet passer and decent interior passer. He’ll complement Chris Webber and Juwan Howard.”\n\nWallace is just 20 years old but showed flashes of brilliance during his two seasons at North Carolina. In a recent personal workout, the Bullets were blown away by his passing skills and outside shooting.\n\n“I couldn’t be more elated,” Bullets Coach Jim Lynam said. “Last year, we stood here and said we felt we got a real solid guy in Juwan Howard. I’ll stand here and say equally strong things on the behalf of Rasheed. He’s a special, special talent.”\n\nAnd media members praised the pick, with Boswell’s column calling Wallace the “Right Face at the Right Time.”\n\nWhen your career is on the line, you appreciate a little luck. So, John Nash and Jimmy Lynam were grateful men last night. To them, Rasheed Wallace — the new Bullets No. 1 pick — looks like salvation in a Tar Heels blue uniform….\n\nLet us summon all the ghosts of Bullets first-round draft picks of the past. Let us gather the hoop spirits of Tom Hammonds and LaBradford Smith, Kenny Green and Wes Matthews, Hot Plate Williams and Frank Johnson, even Muggsy Bogues and Harvey Grant. All of them No. 1 Bullet picks since 1980.\n\nBe gone with you!\n\nThe 1990s are the age of Wallace, Howard, Cheaney and, lest he be forgotten, Tom Gugliotta, who brought Webber. This isn’t a different Bullets era yet. But it will be very soon.\n\nBoswell only mentioned Garnett with sadness, asking for “a moment of silence for a 19-year-old, Kevin Garnett of Chicago, who must now play with Isaiah Rider and Christian Laettner — NBA head cases No. 1 and 1A.\n\nAnyhow, that’s the story of the Bullets not drafting Kevin Garnett."
