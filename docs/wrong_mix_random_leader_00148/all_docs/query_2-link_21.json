        "text": "The bad karma award this week goes to Detroit Pistons windbag Rasheed Wallace. Wallace guaranteed a victory for his Pistons over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference playoffs. In what has commonly known as the “Guaran-Sheed,” Wallace went on a two-minute rant about how the Cavs had no chance to win this game.\n\nThis is not the first time that Wallace has guaranteed victory. In fact, the Pistons had not lost a playoff game in which he had laid down a Guaran-Sheed. The timing of this guarantee was quite dubious. The Cavaliers organization and the city are reeling from the death of Justin Hughes, the younger brother of popular Cavs’ player Larry Hughes. While the Cavs mourned, Rasheed goes on his psychotic blather.\n\nThe end result: Not only does Cleveland defeat Detroit 74-70 to tie the series at 2-2, Wallace misses 10 of his 13 shots, and he goes down with an ankle injury which forces him to miss most of the second half and all of the fourth quarter."
