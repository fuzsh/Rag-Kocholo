        "text": "Make no mistake, Rasheed Wallace has been huge for the Celtics tonight.\n\nThis is why the Celtics signed him, to play big in big games, though no one thought he’d be called upon to start a Game 7.\n\nEight points, eight rebounds so far in 29 minutes.\n\nNot spectacular numbers at first glance, but remember, ‘Sheed’s back is about as fluid these days as a saltine cracker.\n\nWithout him, Boston would be toast.\n\nMeanwhile, Derek Fisher has gone to the locker room to get his leg checked out after an awkward tumble.\n\nCeltics 57-51, 2:12 left 3rd.\n\n—\n\nPaul Pierce sat for 62 seconds, enough time for whatever the nerve issue is in that shoulder to calm down.\n\nThe Lakers are calming down a bit as well.\n\nA 12-point deficit a minute ago has been cut in half, and the requisite Lakers’ run has officially started.\n\nLamar Odom gets a rebound on the defensive end, makes a crisp outlet pass to start the break, then sprints down to lay in a miss off yet … another … offensive rebound.\n\nBoston might want to think about contesting those.\n\nCeltics 51-45, 5:38 left 3rd.\n\n—\n\nPaul Pierce is hurt.\n\nWe’ve said that a lot this season, but Pierce is holding that problematic right shoulder, the one that sparked the brouhaha against the Heat in the first round and has been a problem for months.\n\nIt’s a nerve issue, Pierce has said.\n\nTony Allen checks in. Pierce won’t be out for long.\n\nCeltics 49-37, 8:15 left 3rd.\n\n—\n\nMore of the same for the Lakers as the second half gets under way.\n\nRon Artest scores off yet another offensive rebound for the defending champs’ first hoop of the third quarter, but the Lakers still can get nothing going from the outside.\n\nRajon Rondo just threw a perfectly placed pass to Kevin Garnett, setting up a three-point play. Kobe Bryant – now with an unquestionably angry look on his face – comes down on the ensuing possession, forces a long jumper, and it clangs off the rim like so many others tonight.\n\nRondo answers in the lane, and all of a sudden, we have our first double-digit difference of Game 7.\n\nCeltics 47-36, 9:35 left in the third.\n\nGut-check time for the Lakers has arrived.\n\n—\n\nHalftime in Game 7. Ron Artest has a game-high 12 points, and the Celtics lead 40-34.\n\nArtest has kept the Lakers in this thing, plain and simple.\n\nKobe Bryant has eight points. Pau Gasol, six. Andrew Bynum, two. The Lakers have taken 49 shots and missed a dizzying 36 of them. They had 10 GAMES this season where they missed 36 shots or less, and they just did it in a half, with an NBA title on the line?\n\nBaffling.\n\nThe Lakers needed someone to step up, and lo and behold, it was Artest – who’s been offensively invisible for much of the finals.\n\nKobe, by the way, is 3 for 14 from the floor. The common thought was that Bryant would have a huge night. Hasn’t happened yet.\n\nPaul Pierce has 11 for the Celtics, who have five other players with five or six points apiece.\n\nWhat happens at the break?\n\nDoc Rivers tells the Celtics to do exactly what they’re doing defensively, and that one big scoring spurt might be enough to win the title.\n\nPhil Jackson tells the Lakers that they’re getting good shots and it’s a matter of time before they start to fall.\n\nThey’ll both be correct.\n\nSee you in the third quarter.\n\n—\n\nRasheed Wallace, peacemaker.\n\nIt’s come to this?\n\nRon Artest and Paul Pierce got locked up under the basket with 1:22 left in the half, and of all people, ‘Sheed is the one who breaks them up?\n\nYou see odd things in Game 7s.\n\nNeither Artest nor Pierce did much of anything, just neither would give any ground, either. Double technicals called, which surely didn’t please either Phil Jackson or Doc Rivers.\n\nMeanwhile, Artest makes both FTs and has 11 points in the quarter.\n\nCeltics 38-33, 1:11 left ’til the break.\n\n—\n\nKevin Garnett gets his third foul with 4:53 to play in the half.\n\nThis means the Lakers will have to watch Glen Davis down low, Paul Pierce on the wing and Ray Allen on the perimeter – all at the same time.\n\nThat’s actually been the formula that has worked best for the Celtics many times in this series.\n\nYes, the C’s lose something without KG’s rebounding and defense. But the Celtics aren’t rebounding anyway.\n\nTied at 29, 3:20 left in the half.\n\n—\n\nLakers had scored the first 11 points of the second quarter, before Rajon Rondo knifed through for a layup that tied the game at 25.\n\nRare that a road team can give up an 11-0 run in a huge game like this and come out OK, but that’s what the Celtics have apparently done.\n\nMost of the scoring so far tonight has come by going to the rim.\n\nThese teams have struggled from the perimeter throughout this series, and Game 7 hasn’t changed that. Lakers are 1 for 8 from 3-point range, Celtics 1 for 7.\n\nTied at 25, 5:59 left in the half.\n\n—\n\nThe Lakers have been simply dominant at times in this series on the offensive glass.\n\nNever better than tonight.\n\n“No rebounds, no rings,” right? Someone reminded the Lakers of that before Game 7, clearly, because the Western Conference champs have an 11-2 edge on the offensive glass early.\n\nNow, sure, part of that is because the Lakers have missed so many shots. If you don’t miss a lot, you can’t get a lot of offensive boards, naturally.\n\nBut it shows the effort is there. A lot of teams go into funks when shooting poorly. Not the Lakers, not so far tonight.\n\nCeltics 23-19, 9:25 left 2nd.\n\n—\n\nEarly foul trouble again. First Gasol, and now, Kevin Garnett.\n\nAnd it was a good call.\n\nAll he had to do with 1:20 left in the opening quarter was hold his ground and let Rajon Rondo slice behind him for an early layup.\n\nInstead, KG thought he was a wide receiver and went into downfield-blocking mode. Easy call.\n\nSo Rasheed Wallace and Glen Davis are on the court together now for the Celtics, which hasn’t happened much (in meaningful minutes, anyway) in these finals. And Davis is looking very much like the force he was in Game 4, with six points in the opening quarter.\n\nLakers are shooting atrociously – 6 for 27 from the floor, 22 percent. Pau Gasol, 2 for 8. Kobe Bryant, 1 for 7.\n\nCeltics shooting 59 percent. Who saw that disparity coming, in L.A., in a Game 7? Not many people outside the commonwealth of Massachusetts, for sure.\n\nCeltics 23-14 after one.\n\n—\n\nIf you’re a Celtics fan, you have to like the way they’ve weathered the early storm.\n\nStaples Center is still into it, of course, but the Boston bench has more than held its own on the cheerleader front.\n\nAnd Pau Gasol just got his second foul after running over Paul Pierce on a pass.\n\nCeltics 19-14, 2:15 left 1st.\n\n—\n\nA lot of contact early, as Kobe Bryant gets pulled down by Rasheed Wallace going for a loose ball a couple minutes ago.\n\nThis much is clear – you will not see tight whistles in the early going tonight.\n\nAnd it’ll take time for players to adjust to that – great example came with about 7 minutes left in the quarter, when the Celtics played body-up defense against Kobe with Ray Allen on him and Paul Pierce doubling down from the wing. Bryant responded by taking a wild shot off the side of the backboard.\n\nEarlier in the series, Allen would have been called for a ticky-tack foul and Kobe would have been on the line.\n\nCeltics 10-9, 5:55 left in the opening quarter.\n\n—\n\nIt was Rasheed Wallace, as expected, at center for the Celtics in place of the injured Kendrick Perkins.\n\nLakers went at him right away on the first possession, and ‘Sheed stood his ground.\n\nThere’ll be a feeling-out period for the first few minutes, but things should settle down quickly. Another good sign for the Lakers: Derek Fisher just hit his first 3-pointer of the series to get the Game 7 scoring started.\n\n—\n\nLakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss and coach Phil Jackson ought to get together and coordinate things with the U.S. Golf Association.\n\nIn short, they should want the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach every year.\n\nGolf’s national championship started today at Pebble, just a couple of Tiger Woods drives (more or less) from Staples Center. It’s the fifth time the Open has been at Pebble, the others being 1972, 1982, 1992 and 2000.\n\nIn ’72, ’82 and ’00, the Lakers won the NBA title.\n\nIn ’92, it was the Chicago Bulls – Phil Jackson’s Bulls.\n\nGood omen for the Lakers.\n\n—\n\nNever doubt a great player.\n\nThat’s why Dwyane Wade thinks Kobe Bryant will have just enough tonight to win his fifth title.\n\nNo animosity toward Boston, considering the Celtics ousted Wade’s Miami Heat in the opening round of these playoffs, but Wade says that he believes a Game 7, at home, for all the marbles could bring out Bryant’s greatness.\n\n“It’s going to be up in the air,” Wade was telling The AP earlier today. “I want to say L.A. because they’re the home team and I think Kobe is a great player and with the other talent around him they can will themselves to a win, but I really don’t know. Boston has shown they can win on the road and they’ve shown if they can stick around, it’ll be a battle, but my gut feeling says L.A. pulls it out.”\n\nWade also says the Kendrick Perkins injury situation – Boston’s center is a no-go tonight because of a knee injury suffered in Game 6 – is more significant than a lot of people realize.\n\n“People say, well, they have more offense with Rasheed Wallace out there, but the defense that Perkins plays on Pau Gasol, the screens he sets, the toughness that he brings to the game is going to be missed tremendously,” Wade says. “That’s one thing, if anything, they had over the Lakers was their overall grit and they’re losing a big part of that in Perkins.”\n\n—\n\nLakers guard Derek Fisher started his day early. BlackBerry in hand at 9:14 a.m. Los Angeles time, to be precise.\n\n“Drive for 5,” he wrote on Twitter.\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\nMore Twitter fun: Kim Kardashian, the sister-in-law of Lakers forward Lamar Odom, announced she had “Army Green” fingernail polish on earlier today. Since that’d be construed as Celtic Green, Kardashian asked her 3,866,624 followers if she should paint them purple or gold. (An hour later, she posted a picture of newly done purple nails, as did sister Khloe, otherwise known as Mrs. Odom.)\n\nPurple nails. Also self-explanatory.\n\nThere were Tweets-a-plenty as the day rolled along about Game 7, including:\n\nRajon Rondo: “Its now or never”\n\nNate Robinson: “Closer to my dreams is reality today”\n\nAnd Chris Bosh, who will try to move closer to a championship when free agency starts in two weeks: “Game 7 tonight! This is going to be a game that everyone remembers forever.”\n\n—\n\nTonight’s officials, and there should be no shock over these selections, are Joe Crawford, Dan Crawford and Scott Foster.\n\nJoe Crawford had the foulfest disguised as Game 1.\n\nDan Crawford worked Game 3, also won by the Lakers. Foster had Game 4, when the Celtics prevailed.\n\nIt’d be stunning if the referees did anything differently tonight than in any other game this season (except maybe give a tiny bit more leeway on things like double-technicals and the like), but because every aspect of a Game 7 in the finals gets dissected 78 different ways, here’s how the Celtics and Lakers have done with those three whistleblowers this season:\n\nCeltics with Joe Crawford – 6-4 overall, 2-2 playoffs, 1-0 finals.\n\nLakers with Joe Crawford – 9-2 overall, 3-2 playoffs, 0-1 finals.\n\nCeltics with Dan Crawford – 6-5 overall, 2-1 playoffs, 0-1 finals.\n\nLakers with Dan Crawford – 6-3 overall, 3-1 playoffs, 1-0 finals.\n\nCeltics with Scott Foster – 6-4 overall, 2-1 playoffs, 1-0 finals.\n\nLakers with Scott Foster – 7-1 overall, 4-1 playoffs, 0-1 finals.\n\n—\n\nIt’s here.\n\nGame 7. Lakers-Celtics.\n\nThose few words ought to be enough to send shivers up and down the spine of any basketball fan.\n\nThis season that started with 30 title hopefuls 234 days ago comes down to this, two teams, 24 players, a slew of future Hall of Famers, and one gold trophy that’s going to be smudged with fingerprints of joy in about three hours.\n\nIt’s the first time Phil Jackson and Kobe Bryant have been part of a Game 7 in the finals. Which shouldn’t matter whatsoever, although it’s become a big story line the past two days. (For comparison’s sake, Kevin Garnett is 3-0 all time in Game 7s.)\n\nHere’s what Jackson was saying an hour or so ago, in his final pregame news conference of the season: “I’m keyed up. I mean, I think it’s natural to be keyed up. But I think every final game has its own level. But I don’t think it’s any more than normal about a game that has as much importance as this has.”\n\nAnd when he walked into Staples Center tonight, the Celtics’ Paul Pierce said, “It’s what you all wanted, right? Lakers versus Celtics. Game 7. All the marbles, baby.”\n\nAll the marbles, indeed.\n\nTip-off, a few minutes away."
