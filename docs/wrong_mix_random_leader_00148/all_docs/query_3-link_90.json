        "text": "We’ve come to the end of this superb five-part series. Today’s editorial will pick my center for my all-time Detroit Pistons team. If you want to read my previous position selections, Check out these editorials below.\n\nAll-Time Pistons PG.\n\nAll-Time Pistons SG.\n\nAll-Time Pistons SF.\n\nAll-Time Pistons PF.\n\nThere were some fascinating choices for this spot. There were some fascinating choices for the center spot, and we will break down each candidate and honorable mention. Let’s start with some honorable mentions.\n\nHonorable Mention: Andre Drummond.\n\nAndre Drummond was selected with the 9th overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. He played just one season at the University Of Connecticut and averaged 10.0 PTS, 7.6 REBS, and 2.7 BLKS. He was selected to the Big East All-Freshman team in his lone season at the university. With Drummond in the fold, He became the Pistons’ most prominent name center since the days of Ben & Rasheed Wallace. In Drummond’s rookie year, he averaged 7.9 PTS, 7.6 REBS, and 1.6 BLKS in the 60 games he played. His solid play got him a selection to the NBA All-Rookie second team and fourth in the Rookie Of The Year Voting.\n\nRebounding Machine.\n\nIn Drummond’s next 12 seasons, He would average 15.2 PTS and 14.3 REBS. He was a 4x rebounding champ and 2x all-star and was selected to the 2015-16 ALL-NBA 3rd team. It was unique to see when it came to Andre Drummond and his ability to rebound the basketball. Nobody could keep him off the glass, and that ability was something I wish the Pistons could’ve built off of. The unfortunate thing with the Pistons regarding Drummond was that they tried to make him a primary option, which they should’ve never done.\n\nNever Should’ve Been Option #1.\n\nOne of the things that killed Detroit/Drummond’s marriage was the fact that Stan Van Gundy wanted to make Andre Drummond the #1 option. He succeeded with Dwight Howard in Orlando and thought doing the same thing to Drummond would bring victories for the Pistons. The problem was that Drummond wasn’t in the same category as Howard. To Drummond’s credit, Drummond tried to make it work, but it didn’t. Ultimately, the Pistons traded Drummond to the Cavs the day after an epic duel between himself and DeAndre Ayton.\n\nHonorable Mention: James Edwards.\n\nJames “Buddha” Edwards was the 2nd pick in the 3rd round of the 1977 NBA Draft by the LA Lakers. Edwards attended the University Of Washington, where he played all four seasons. He left the school with a career average of 14.6 PTS and 7.5 REBS. Edwards was a 2x All-Pac-8 1st team member (1976 & 77) and an AP honorable mention all-American (1976.) He wouldn’t be a member of the Lakers as long as he was traded to the Pacers in the Adrian Dantley trade.\n\nVery Solid In The Middle.\n\nIn Edward’s next five seasons in the NBA with the Cavaliers and Pacers, He was excellent, averaging 15.7 PTS and 7.3 REBS. The numbers were never all-star-worthy when you had guys like Moses Malone, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jack Sikma, and Dan Issel roaming the center spot in the Western Conference (Yes, The Pacers were in the Western Conference during the ’70s). However, Edwards was still a guy you could plug in your starting lineup. Edwards was traded to the Phoenix Suns, where he would average 14.7 PTS and 5.6 REBS in the six seasons he played in the Valley.\n\nBecoming an NBA Champion.\n\nEdwards was dealt to help boost the Pistons’ chances of winning the NBA championship. He became a crucial member of the Pistons’ second unit from the 88 to 89 season when it won its first title during the 88-89 season. On a team that called themselves the “Bad Boys,” James was one of the chilled members of the group. That and his “Fu Manchu mustache” earned him the name Buddha. Edwards would get to start during the 89-90 run, where he averaged 14.5 PTS and 4.5 REBS. His contribution to the team helped the Pistons win the 2nd consecutive championship. He would start one more year during the 90-91 season, averaging 13.6 PTS and 3.8 REBS. This would be the last season that Edwards would get a consistent starting time before his farewell tour in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland, where he could win one more title with the Bulls.\n\nNow that we have our honorable mentions out the way Let’s go ahead and dive into the Pistons’ Center discussion. I believe that your choice will be based on preference. Do you want the offensive, ahead-of-his-time abilities of Bob Lanier, the sweet-shooting, rebounding, all-around unlikeable player in Bill Laimbeer, or do you want the defensive monster and enforcer in Ben Wallace? This may not be that hard of a list to choose from for some, but it’s a bit difficult for me. Let’s get into the players.\n\nMaking A Case For Bob Lanier.\n\nBob Lanier was the first overall pick in the 1970 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. He played three seasons at St. Bonaventure, averaging 27.6 PTS and 15.7 REBS. He was selected to be a Converse All-American all three seasons he played. As a senior, Lanier led St. Bonaventure to the final four, but an injury to his knee would keep him from playing in the semifinals, which caused the team to lose to Jacksonville University. Despite that heartbreaking result, Lanier would be named the Coach and Athlete Magazine player of the year and the Eastern College Athletic Conference’s Player of the Year.\n\nGetting To Detroit.\n\nLanier came into professional basketball with the NBA and ABA courting his services. In addition to being the Pistons’ 1st overall pick in the 1970 NBA Draft, Lanier was also the territorial pick of the ABA’s New York Nets. When choosing between the two franchises, Lanier chose the Pistons as the Pistons showed more eagerness to sign Lanier. They brought his contract to his hospital room as he was recovering from knee surgery. Despite coming into training camp overweight, limping, and in significant pain from inactivity as he recovered from surgery, Lanier still managed to play in all 82 games, averaging 15.6 PTS and 8.1 REBS.\n\nLooking back on it, Lanier acknowledges that he should’ve taken a year off to get his knee 100%, but the pressure from the franchise to get him out there to play got to him. “I wasn’t healthy when I got to the league,” Lanier reflected. “I shouldn’t have played my first year. But there was so much pressure from them to play, I would have been much better off—and our team would have been much better served—if I had just sat out that year and worked on my knee. My knee was so sore every single day that it was ludicrous to be doing what I was doing. With a proper rehab during the summer and Dave Bing asserting himself as one of the best point guards in the league, Lanier would go on a tear his second season, averaging 25.1 PTS, 14.2 REBS, and 3.1 AST.\n\nEmpty Numbers In Detroit?\n\nBob Lanier had a fantastic individual career in Detroit, like his running mate Dave Bing. Unfortunately, Lanier was never able to get the Pistons out of the first round of the playoffs the four years they made the postseason. He never had a season in Detroit (outside of his rookie season) where he averaged less than 21 points, and his seven all-star appearances are the second-most appearances in franchise history. Lanier never had any structure in the coaching or player personnel during his tenure. He had eight different coaches during the ten seasons, and their best team during the 73-74 season saw six players from that team traded.\n\n“I think ’73–74 was our best team [52–30]. We had Dave [Bing], Stu Lantz, John Mengelt, Chris Ford, Don Adams, Curtis Rowe, and George Trapp. But then, for some reason, they traded six guys off that team before the following year. I didn’t feel we ever had the leadership… That was a rough time because you’d be so despondent at the end of every year.” The Pistons decided to trade Lanier to the Milwaukee Bucks for Kent Benson and a 1980s first-round pick, which ended up being Larry Drew. Lanier would have a solid five seasons in Milwaukee, averaging 13.5 PTS and 5.9 REBS, but the lingering knee issues forced him to retire after the 83-84 season.\n\nImpact Outside Of The Lines.\n\nBoth franchises felt Lanier’s overall impact as his number 16 hangs in the Fiserv Forum and Little Caesars Arena rafters. His impact on the NBA is just as significant. He was the spokesperson for the NBA’s “Stay In School” program (now known as Read to Achieve) from 1989 to 1994. Lanier was also the global ambassador for NBA Cares from 2005 to 2022. Lanier routinely worked with youth-serving programs that supported education, youth and family development, and health-related causes.\n\nAs you can see, Lanier was an all-around good guy. He ensured his impact was felt on the basketball court and the community. This next guy was a hero in Detroit for helping change the culture, but he was a guy that most of his peers hated playing against because of his “dirty” style of play. Next up on this list is the One and Only Bill Laimbeer.\n\nMaking A Case For Bill Laimbeer.\n\nWilliam Laimbeer Jr. was selected with the 65th pick (3rd Round) of the 1979 NBA draft. He attended Notre Dame but flunked out after his freshman season. He would go to Owens Technical College in Toledo, Ohio, to regain his eligibility to Notre Dame. After his two semesters, He would re-enter Notre Dame and play two more seasons there. He would leave with an average of 7.4 PTS and 6.3 REBS.\n\nHumbling Times\n\nLaimbeer didn’t play for the Cavaliers after he was drafted. Instead, he played over in Italy for a season, averaging 21.1 PTS and 12.5 REBS. Laimbeer made his NBA debut during the 1980-81 season, averaging 9.8 PTS and 8.6 REBS in 81 games. During the 81-82 season, Laimbeer was traded to the Detroit Pistons for Phil Hubbard, Paul Mokeski, and picks. Immediately upon the trade, Bill Laimbeer was inserted into the starting line-up as the Center.\n\nLaying The Bad Boys Foundation.\n\nWith the trade to the Pistons, Laimbeer was paired up with superstar Isiah Thomas. He immediately found success, averaging 12.8 PTS and 11.3 REBS in his 30 games played. For the next six seasons, Laimbeer would play in all 82 games. He also averaged 15.7 PTS and 11.9 REBS in those six seasons with the Pistons. Laimbeer was selected to four all-star games as the Pistons became a consistent figure in the NBA playoffs. Laimbeer was not only able to frustrate you on the court with his play, but his physicality also frustrated you.\n\nFans In Detroit Loved Him, and Everybody Else Hated Him.\n\nPhysicality in sports is needed if you want to have a chance to win. The adage is that the most physical team will win the game. Bill Laimbeer took those words and twisted them as much as he could. He would call it psychological warfare; his opponents would call it dirty and unsportsmanlike. No matter how you took it, Laimbeer didn’t care.\n\nWhen the Pistons took the court, Laimbeer would lead the rest of the team out of the locker room. He always did so with a scowl to show he was not intimidated by anyone. His objective was to get his opponents so riled up that their focus changed from playing to retaliating. According to Laimbeer, If you went into a game looking to retaliate against the Pistons, “They had them.” This style of basketball became a trademark in the Metro-Detroit area, with fans coming to games wearing “Bad Boy” merchandise.\n\nOutside of the Metro-Detroit area, The Pistons could have been better for the game of basketball. They weren’t nothing but thugs and possessed poor sportsmanship. People even overlooked Laimbeer as a player and focused on how he played to get into his opponent’s head. Laimbeer was one of the top outside-shooting centers of his era, draining over 200 three-pointers for his career. On the defensive end, Laimbeer was one of the best rebounders in the game. He finished his career as the 19th player in league history to amass over 10,000 points and 10,000 rebounds.\n\nSecond Chapter.\n\nAfter retiring, Laimbeer endorsed Bill Laimbeer’s Combat Basketball, a futuristic basketball game in which physical play is encouraged. Laimbeer also co-founded Laimbeer Packaging Corp., which produced corrugated cardboard boxes with his dad. The company struggled to profit during the late 1990s and closed in 2002. Laimbeer was also a color commentator for the Detroit Pistons and ESPN. He returned to the court in 2007 when he, Chauncey Billups, and Swin Cash won the Shooting Stars competition. Laimbeer would return in 2009 to win it again with Aaron Afflalo and Katie Smith.\n\nCoaching.\n\nLaimbeer would become the head coach of the Detroit Shock in 2002. The Shock was the worst team in basketball when he took over the coaching realms. The Shock went from worst to first in just one season, winning its franchise’s first-ever WNBA championship. They became the first team outside of Houston or LA to win the championship in the WNBA. Laimbeer would be named coach of the year that year. Four years later, Laimbeer would win his second WNBA championship when the Shock defeated the Sacramento Monarchs in five games. Two years later, The Shock would win their third championship under Laimbeer by defeating the San Antonio Starzz.\n\nLaimbeer always had a desire to coach an NBA team. He was never able to do so, but he was a part of the Minnesota Timberwolves coaching staff from 2009 to 2012. Laimbeer would return to the WNBA as the head coach of the New York Liberty for two seasons in 2013. He was let go by the team but rehired in 2015 and coached three more seasons. In 2018, Laimbeer would go on to coach the Las Vegas Aces. He won a championship with the Aces in 2021, netting him his fourth championship as a coach. He’s finished his career with a 306-215 record with four titles.\n\nBill Laimbeer brought toughness and intensity not only to the Pistons but to the WNBA as well. He will go down in history as one of the toughest players to ever play. Another guy that will go down with that same moniker is Ben Wallace. Let’s make the case for Big Ben.\n\nMaking A Case For Ben Wallace.\n\nThis may seem biased, but Ben Wallace will always be my favorite NBA player! Wallace came from a family where he was the 10th of 11 children. Growing up in White Hall, Alabama, he went through so much, from hunting to get their meal for the night, going to school with no shoes, and even picking cotton to get money in his pocket. Wallace played two seasons at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland. He averaged 17 REBS and 6.9 BLKS in the two seasons at the college.\n\nWith his Charles Oakley connection, Wallace would play at Virginia Union University. Wallace averaged 13.4 points and 10.0 rebounds per game, leading Virginia Union to the Division II Final Four with a 28–3 record. In his senior season, Wallace was named to the All-CIAA first team by the head coaches of Virginia Union’s conference, the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association. He was also selected as a first-team Division II All-American by the National Association of Basketball Coaches.\n\nHumble Beginnings\n\nBen Wallace went undrafted in the infamous 1996 draft. He would play for the Boston Celtics summer league team, but the Celtics’ desire for Wallace to play guard instead of center caused the team to cut him. With no calls from NBA teams, Wallace would go to Italy and play one game for Viola Reggio Calabria. Wallace would get a call from another undersized legend, Wes Unseld, who saw potential in Ben as a big man.\n\nWallace would play 34 games his rookie season, averaging just 1.1 PTS and 1.7 REBS. Over the next two years in Washington, Wallace started to earn more minutes and more respect from his peers. Wallace was coming into the 99-00 season expecting to be a team captain, but he was traded to the Orlando Magic for Isaac Austin. With this trade, The Magic was looking to tank, but with guys such as Wallace, Darrell Armstrong, Bo Outlaw, and a rookie head coach in Doc Rivers, The Magic went 41-41. Wallace averaged 4.8 PTS, 8.2 REBS, and 1.6 BLKS that season.\n\nBecoming A Fan Favorite.\n\nGrant Hill wanted to leave Detroit and go to Orlando. Newly appointed President Of Basketball Operations, Joe Dumars, knew he had to get some compensation for Hill. He swung a trade, sending Hill to the Magic for Wallace and Chucky Atkins. Wallace was making noise as a defensive player, and with this trade, the expectation was his numbers would grow immensely with more minutes. The transaction did not go over well in Detroit, with some fans even booing him when he was introduced!\n\nWallace had been proving the doubters wrong all his life and was ready to do the same in Detroit. The Pistons went just 32-50 in Wallace’s inaugural season, but Wallace cemented himself as one of the best defenders in the league. Ben averaged 6.4 PTS, 13.2 REBS, 1.3 STLS, and 2.3 BLKS. With those numbers, you would’ve thought Wallace would be the Defensive Player Of The Year, but the Pistons being trash hurt his chances. He ended up tied for 5th in voting with David Robinson.\n\nFear The Fro.\n\nIt only took one season to see that Wallace was the man to build around. Joe Dumars knew he could win with Stackhouse as the offensive focus, and Ben controlled the defense. With the acquisitions of Jon Barry, Cliff Robinson, Dana Barros, and Rick Carlisle as coaches, the Pistons went from 30-52 to 52-30. Wallace won his first defensive player of the year, taking home 96% of the vote, which is still the highest in NBA history. The Pistons were once again relevant on the NBA scene.\n\nThe Pistons brought Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, and Tayshaun Prince the following year. Wallace averaged 6.9 PTS, 15.4 REBS, 1.4 STLS, and 3.5 BLKS. Those numbers earned him his first all-star appearance and his second consecutive Defensive Player Of The Year. In 2003-04, Larry Brown became the head coach of the Pistons and wanted to make Wallace more of an offensive force. The newfound focus for Wallace was successful for the Pistons, especially with the acquisition of Rasheed Wallace. Ben averaged 9.5 PTS, 12.4 REBS, 1.8 STLS, and 3.0 BLKS. He finished second in the DPOY voting to Ron Artest.\n\nGreatest Defender Of The 2000’s\n\nWallace averaged a double-double in the playoffs at 10.3 PTS, 14.3 REBS, 1.9 STLS, and 2.4 BLKS. His defense on Shaq helped the Pistons overcome the mighty Lakers four games to one. In 2004-05, Wallace was suspended six games for “instigating” the “Malice At The Palace.” Those suspensions included a season-long suspension for Artest and double-digit suspensions for Artest, Stephen Jackson and Jermaine O’Neal. Despite his suspension, Wallace would win his third DPOY award, averaging 9.7 PTS, 12,2 REBS, 1.4 STLS, and 2.4 BLKS. 05-06, Wallace would win his fourth DPOY award, tying him with Dikembe Mutombo for the most DPOYS in history. This was Wallace’s last season in Detroit as he left Detroit for Chicago.\n\nWould you like to know how important Wallace was in the NBA? Here you go.\n\nOnly player in the history of the NBA to record 1,000 rebounds, 100 blocks, and 100 steals in 4 consecutive seasons (2001–2004).\n\nOne of three players in NBA history to record 150 blocks and 100 steals in 7 consecutive seasons (2001–2007) (along with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson).\n\nOne of five players in NBA history to lead the NBA in rebounding and blocking averages in the same season (along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Dwight Howard).\n\nOne of three players in NBA history to average 15 rebounds and three blocks per game over a season (along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bob McAdoo).\n\nOnly undrafted player in NBA history to be voted a starter for the NBA All-Star Game.\n\nOne of two players in NBA history to receive the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award four times (along with Dikembe Mutombo).\n\nFirst undrafted player in modern NBA history to be elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Final Verdict\n\nThis one is tough. I do think it comes down to personal preference. Do you want the offensive prowess of Bob Lanier, the stretch big rebounding machine of Bill Laimbeer, or the defensive ace Ben Wallace? I don’t think you can be wrong with whoever you choose, so It has to be Ben Wallace. I love defenders; defense was always my calling when I played basketball. Watching Ben play was always a pleasure, and he helped me overcome my personal adversities with his story.\n\nI don’t think I can leave either Lanier or Laimbeer off my team so they both get a spot.\n\nStart: Ben Wallace\n\nBench: Bob Lanier\n\nBench: Bill Laimbeer\n\nMy All-Time Pistons Team\n\nPoint Guard: Isiah Thomas\n\nShooting Guard: Joe Dumars\n\nSmall Forward: Grant Hill\n\nPower Forward: Dennis Rodman\n\nCenter: Ben Wallace\n\nThis team has a perfect balance of offense and Defense. Scoring on Rodman and Wallace is going to be tough. Joe D’s 2-way ability will also help Isiah Thomas out defensively, allowing him to put more energy on the offensive end. Grant Hill will help everyone out on the offensive end with his do-it-all style of basketball. I really do like this starting five.\n\nBench\n\n6th man: Vinnie Johnson\n\n7th man: Dave Bing\n\n8th man: Bob Lanier\n\n9th man: Bill Laimbeer\n\n10th man: Mark Aguirre\n\n11th man: Richard Hamilton\n\n12th man: Chauncey Billups"
