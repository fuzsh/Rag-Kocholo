        "text": "In celebration of the 45th anniversary of the McDonald’s All American Games, the McDonald’s Selection Committee has unveiled an updated list of the 45 Greatest All-Time Boys Players in the event’s history.\n\nThis list includes five new additions since the list was last updated in 2017 for the 40th annual Games. The new additions to the roster arrived on the brink of the 45th annual McDonald’s All American Games, which will be played March 29 at Wintrust Arena in Chicago.\n\nThe newest inductees to the list included McDonald’s All American Games Alumni: Chauncey Billups (1995), Chris Bosh (2002), Chris Webber (1991), Jermaine O’Neal (1996), and Rasheed Wallace (1993).\n\nWith the addition of Billups, Bosh, Webber, O’Neal and Wallace, the group became part of the 39 alumni who went on to become NBA All-Stars. Eighteen of the 39 alumni were recently named to the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team.\n\nThe McDonald’s All American Games Greatest Boys List was originally released in 2012 with 35 players and updated to 40 players in 2017 for the 40th anniversary of the Games.\n\nIn determining the list, all players were considered based on their high school career and performance in the McDonald’s All American Games, success at the collegiate and professional level and post-career accomplishments.\n\nUnrivaled on the high school basketball stage, the Games continue to help elevate these high potential prospects and prepare them for success at the next level."
