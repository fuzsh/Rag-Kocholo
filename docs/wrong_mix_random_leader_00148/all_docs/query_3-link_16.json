        "text": "The 2003 NBA draft, which saw the Detroit Pistons draft Darko Milicic over several surefire Hall of Famers, will always be a sore topic for fans. Nearly two decades later, it has become clear that it also remains a contentious subject for those involved with the organization at the time.\n\nChauncey Billups, now an ESPN analyst, believes the Pistons could’ve made a better choice with the second-overall pick. Rip Hamilton has expressed disapproval of the selection on multiple occasions, recently stating he thinks Detroit would’ve had greater success against the LeBron James-led Cavaliers had they drafted Carmelo Anthony.\n\n“I don't think that Cleveland team beats us with Carmelo Anthony,” Hamilton said in June. “I don't. Like, come on. I think the narrative would've been different on Carmelo Anthony.\"\n\nEven Anthony, who went a pick after Milicic, recently said he thinks the Pistons would’ve won multiple championships had they selected him.\n\nThis isn’t the consensus opinion, however. Ben Wallace pushed back on the idea that Anthony would’ve guaranteed at least a second championship. And in May, during an appearance on the “Where They At” podcast, former head coach Larry Brown defended then-general manager Joe Dumars’ decision to draft Milicic.\n\n“It is what it is because the same people that drafted Darko were smart enough to trade for Ben Wallace,” he said. “Smart enough to draft Tayshaun Prince, smart enough to trade for Rip Hamilton, smart enough to trade for Chauncey Billups, smart enough to trade for and believe in Rasheed (Wallace). So you know, it is what it is.”\n\nThere’s little doubt Detroit could’ve gotten better value for its high-lottery pick. The next three picks — Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade — are three of the greatest players in NBA history. Even the sixth- and seventh-overall picks, Chris Kaman and Kirk Hinrich, had better careers than Milicic, who was traded midway through his third season with the Pistons.\n\nYet, it’s tough to say if drafting one of the aforementioned players would’ve led to more success for that Pistons team, which won a championship in 2004 and fell to the Spurs in the 2005 Finals.\n\n“If we would’ve drafted Carmelo, I honestly don’t think we would have ever won a championship,” Wallace said earlier this year. “Melo wanted to play right away. It would have had the potential to disrupt the team chemistry.\n\n“If we drafted Carmelo, Tayshaun (Prince) wouldn’t blossom to be the type of a player that he was,” he continued. “We won that championship on the back of the best block I’ve ever seen in my life, and I blocked a lot of shots. That is the type of grit and grind that the team had.”\n\n[ The Pistons' Rasheed Wallace era: A look back at the best moments ]\n\nIt’s also possible that had the Pistons went in a different direction, it would’ve prevented them from making one of the most pivotal trades in franchise history — the trade for Rasheed Wallace ahead of the 2004 deadline, which solidified their core and helped them win their third title in franchise history.\n\nThe Darko conundrum\n\nWhen the Pistons ended up with the No. 2 pick in the draft, at least one prominent draft pundit believed there were only two logical options for them — Milicic and Anthony.\n\nAnthony was coming off of a historic freshman season at Syracuse, which ended with an NCAA championship. Milicic, a Serbian forward, was more of an unknown to the American public.\n\nThen-ESPN draft analyst Chad Ford said Anthony was a “distant third” behind LeBron James and Milicic, who he believed was clearly the second-best player in the draft.\n\n“He's the real deal,” Ford wrote. “He's really one of a kind. He runs the floor, handles the ball, shoots the NBA 3-pointer, plays with his back to the basket, so you can slot him in at the 3, 4 or 5. What sets Darko apart is his toughness in the post. You have to love a guy who has the footwork to spin by an opponent, but still prefers to lower a shoulder and bang.\"\n\nMilicic didn’t deliver on the hype, appearing in just 34 games. While the Pistons didn’t get what they wanted from him, Dumars ended up trading for Rasheed Wallace — a player who almost perfectly fit Ford’s description of Milicic — later that season.\n\nIf the Pistons drafted Anthony instead, would Dumars have felt the need to address Detroit’s frontcourt at the deadline?\n\nMore Pistons 'What ifs':\n\nPistons almost got Allen Iverson in his prime. How different would history be?\n\nWith healthy Donatas Motiejunas, Pistons would have avoided these SVG-era mistakes\n\nBrandon Jennings' Achilles tear in 2015 altered the course of Pistons for years\n\nThe perfect piece\n\nWallace — a defensive-minded power forward/center who also could stretch the floor and, at times, take over offensively — fit the Pistons like a glove. Dumars correctly identified Wallace as a player who could help the Pistons, in win-now mode, reach a higher level of play.\n\n\"We feel this is a guy who can help us make a run when it comes to playoff time,” Dumars said at the time. \"We've said for a while now that we wanted to add an impact player, and we feel he's the type of guy who can impact our team.\"\n\nDetroit finished the 2003-04 season with the league’s second-best defensive rating (96.48). Its defense fueled its championship run, setting a number of defensive records in the playoffs. The Lakers cracked the 90-point threshold just once in five games during the Finals.\n\n[ Pistons flat-out better than Lakers in 2004 and proved it in Game 1 of Finals ]\n\nAnthony, one of the best offensive players in NBA history, could’ve lifted the Pistons on that end of the floor. But offense wasn’t an issue in later seasons; Detroit actually had a top-seven offensive rating in the league from 2005 to 2008. The Pistons were bottom-15 in offense during both of their Finals appearances in 2004 and 2005.\n\nAnthony has long had a reputation for being a lackluster defensive player, and it’s impossible to know how patient Brown would’ve been with him on that end of the floor.\n\nIf nothing else, drafting Anthony would’ve led to the Pistons making tradeoffs down the road. With Wallace, they won one championship and came close to winning a second. With Anthony, it’s unclear if Wallace ever would’ve worn Pistons blue.\n\n[ Solving Pistons' greatest 'What ifs' of 2010s: Smith, Mitchell, Griffin moves ]\n\nWhile several former Pistons believe Anthony would’ve increased their ceiling, it makes sense why Ben Wallace, a four-time defensive player of the year, is skeptical."
