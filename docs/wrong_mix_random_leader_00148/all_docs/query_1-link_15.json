        "text": "PRINCETON >> Trenton High’s all-time leading scorer is no country boy, but he has found a home for himself in Oklahoma.\n\nDespite it being only June, Rasheed Wallace was raring to return to Western Oklahoma State College. He was in town playing for Conefry Family in the Victory Sports Pro-Am Summer Basketball League at the Hun School on Wednesday, alongside former teammate Shaquan Worthy and former Pennington guard Elijah Wright.\n\n“It’s good to be back home, but I’m kind of ready to get back to school right now,” Wallace said. “I wanted to get a chance to play with (Worthy and Wright) again over the summer.”\n\nWestern Oklahoma State sits in Altus, home to about 19,000 people near the Texas border. Wallace intends to return there for another season of JUCO ball to earn a possible Division I scholarship. The Pioneers’ program has had two D-I players come out of there in the past two years.\n\n“It’s been a great experience, there’s tough competition down there, I like it,” Wallace said. “It’s a big change. It’s very country down there and I had to adjust, but I’m doing OK.\n\n“There’s a lot of cows and farms, guys wearing cowboy hats and girls wearing cowboy bo0ts,” Wallace said of living in the Midwest.\n\nWallace had an up-and-down year with the Pioneers, early on he was getting about 20 minutes a game through the first couple months of the season, scoring in double figures five times, but eventually his minutes dropped off as other scorers emerged.\n\n“My shot stopped falling and I started getting less shot attempts, so my averages started to fall,” Wallace said. “We had three primary scorers on the team, so a lot of plays were set up for them and before we were just playing regular basketball and everyone was shooting.”\n\nIt’s a far departure from Wallace’s days in Tornado Alley, where he compiled 1,316 career points and graduated as Trenton’s all-time leading scorer.\n\n“I knew I would have to change when I got to college. I’m a guard now and I should be better now,” Wallace said of how his game has evolved. “I feel like I can create shots for myself, I work the pick and roll well and I really work to get others open.”\n\nWallace sees himself as combo-guard at the D-I level and has already shown he’s willing to travel any distance to reach that goal.\n\n“The summer isn’t over yet for me, when I go back, I should be where I should be,” Wallace said."
