Rubber-faced actor Jim Carrey married "Picket Fences" actress Lauren Holly on Monday in Los Angeles, said Marleah Leslie, the actor's publicist.

Carrey, 34, and Holly, 32, met on the set of the 1994 movie "Dumb and Dumber." It was the second marriage for both.

No details about the ceremony were disclosed.

Carrey is known for playing overzealous and sometimes obnoxious characters in movies including two "Ace Ventura" movies, "The Mask" and "The Cable Guy." He's due back on the set of the film "Liar, Liar" on Wednesday.

Holly is perhaps best known as Deputy Maxine Stewart on the TV series "Picket Fences." She recently completed filming for the romantic comedy "A Smile Like Yours."

On Saturday, Kennedy married Carolyn Bessette and Brinkley exchanged vows with Peter Cook. Busey married Tiani Warden on Monday.
