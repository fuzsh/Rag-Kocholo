        "text": "Cathriona White, the ex-girlfriend of Jim Carrey who died in a suspected suicide, was reportedly married to another man when she died.\n\nThe Irish make-up artist was found dead in her home on 28 September and officials have confirmed that ‘she had a husband’.\n\n‘We have a husband as next of kin. We’re not releasing any more information on next of kin, but we do have her as married,’ the L.A. County Medical Examiner’s office told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIt was reported that Cathriona and Jim had split five days before her death and a source close to Jim’s family revealed that ‘there is no way that Jim would have taken her out to public places if he thought she was married’.\n\n‘As far as Jim was concerned, Cat was separated from her husband and was going to start divorce proceedings in December. When people are separated they date or do whatever they need to do.’\n\nIt is not known who Cat’s husband is or if he will attend the funeral but Jim will be flying to Ireland for the service.\n\n‘He has been in touch with Cathriona’s family and they want him at the funeral. They know how much he meant to her,’ a source told The Mirror.\n\nMetro.co.uk have contacted Jim Carrey’s rep for comment.\n\nMORE : Police ‘want to speak to Jim Carrey in connection to ex-girlfriend Cathriona White’s death’"
