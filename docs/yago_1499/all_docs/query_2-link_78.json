        "text": "More details have emerged about the tragic death of Cathriona White, Jim Carrey’s late girlfriend, who was found dead in a suspected suicide at her Los Angeles apartment last week.\n\nIn a shocking twist, the latest reports reveal that Cathriona – who had been seeing Jim on and off since late 2012 – was actually married to someone else at the time of her death. According to E!, the 30-year-old makeup artist was indeed legally married but had been separated from her husband, with intentions to file for divorce later this year.\n\n“Jim would have never gone out with her if she was still married,” a source confirmed to E!\n\nCathriona was found with several prescription pills near her body, but LA Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told People that none of the bottles were in her name. Three were under one name, and the fourth was under another. The prescriptions ranged from sedatives and painkillers to medications designed to treat migraines, anxiety and nausea.\n\nTMZ reports that the name on three of the bottles was an alias for Jim, but this information has yet to be confirmed.\n\nMr Winter has previously stated that there were “several notes” found at Cathriona’s home, including one that was addressed to Jim. The on-again, off-again couple had reportedly broken up just days before Cathriona’s body was found.\n\nThe actor released a statement shortly after the news broke, saying he was “shocked and saddened” at her death.\n\n“She was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled,” he said at the time.\n\n“My heart goes out to her family and friends and to everyone who loved and cared about her. We have all been hit with a lightning bolt.”\n\nCathriona’s family arrived in the US last week to bring her body back to her native Ireland, and Jim has reportedly been an invaluable source of support during this troubling time. The actor was spotted speaking to Cathriona’s sister several times, and he is said to have provided his car for the family’s use while in LA."
