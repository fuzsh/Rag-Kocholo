        "text": "Birth Name: James Eugene \"Jim\" Carrey\n\nDate of Birth: 17th. January, 1962\n\nPlace of Birth: Newmarket, Ontario, Canada\n\nFather: Percy Carrey, a musician and accountant.\n\nMother: Kathleen (nÃ©e Oram), a homemaker.\n\nSiblings: Three older siblings, John, Patricia, and Rita.\n\nSchooling: When Carrey was 14 years old, he attended Blessed Trinity Catholic School, in North York, for two years, enrolled at Agincourt Collegiate Institute for another year, then briefly attended Northview Heights Secondary School, for the remainder of his high school career (altogether, he spent three years in Grade 10). Carrey lived in Burlington, Ontario, for eight years and attended Aldershot High School.\n\nStart of Career:\n\n--Comedy\n\nIn 1979, under the management of Leatrice Spevack, Carrey started doing stand-up comedy at Yuk Yuk's in Toronto, where he rose to become a headliner in February 1981, shortly after his 19th birthday. One reviewer in the Toronto Star raved that Carrey was \"a genuine star coming to life.\" In the early 1980s, Carrey moved to Los Angeles and started working at The Comedy Store, where he was noticed by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who signed the young comedian to open Dangerfield's tour performances.\n\nCarrey then turned his attention to the film and television industries. His first lead role on television was Skip Tarkenton, a young animation producer on NBC's short-lived The Duck Factory, airing from April 12, 1984, to July 11, 1984, and offering a behind-the-scenes look at the crew that produced a children's cartoon.\n\nCarrey continued working in smaller film and television roles, which led to a friendship with fellow comedian Damon Wayans, who co-starred with Carrey as an extraterrestrial in 1989's Earth Girls Are Easy.\n\n--Film\n\nCarrey made his film debut in Rubberface (1983), which was released as 'Introducing...Janet'. Later that year, he won the leading role in Damian Lee's Canadian skiing comedy Copper Mountain, which included his impersonation of Sammy Davis Jr. Since the film had a less than one hour runtime consisting largely of musical performances by Rita Coolidge and Rompin' Ronnie Hawkins, it was not considered a genuine feature film. Two years later, in 1985, Carrey saw his first major starring role in the dark comedy Once Bitten, in the role of Mark Kendall, a teen virgin pursued by a 400-year old female vampire (played by Lauren Hutton). Carrey did not experience true stardom until starring in the 1994 comedy Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, which premiered only months before In Living Color ended. The film was panned by critics, and earned Carrey a 1995 Golden Raspberry Award nomination as Worst New Star.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nCarrey has been married twice, first to former actor and Comedy Store waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he has a daughter, Jane Erin Carrey. They were married on March 28, 1987, and were officially divorced in late 1995. After his separation from Womer in 1994, Carrey began dating his Dumb and Dumber co-star Lauren Holly. They were married on September 23, 1996; the marriage lasted less than a year. Carrey dated actress RenÃ©e Zellweger, whom he met on the set of Me, Myself & Irene, but their relationship ended in a broken engagement in December 2000. During 2004, Carrey dated his massage therapist Tiffany O. Silver.\n\nIn the May 2006 issue of Playboy Magazine, it was mentioned that he has dated model Anine Bing. In December 2005, Carrey began dating actress/model Jenny McCarthy. The pair have since denied engagement rumors. They did not make their relationship public until June 2006. She announced on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on April 2, 2008 that the two are now living together, but have no plans to marry, as they do not need a \"piece of paper.\"\n\nCarrey's 22-year-old daughter, Jane, is expecting her first child with rocker fiancÃ© Alex Santana, who performs in the band Blood Money under the stage name Nitro.\n\nCarrey has a chipped tooth; for his role in Dumb and Dumber, he simply removed the tooth cap.\n\nHe attended a Presbyterian Church with his family in the early 1990s. He is a fan of death metal band Cannibal Corpse, who made a cameo appearance in Ace Ventura, at his request for the band to be featured in the film. Carrey received U.S. citizenship on October 7, 2004, and now maintains dual citizenship of the U.S. and his native Canada, where he has had a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto since 1998.\n\nHe went public about his bouts with depression in a November 2004 interview on 60 Minutes. Carrey has made calls to the public, by way of Internet videos, to try to bring attention to the political repression in Burma, especially of Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, whom he describes as a personal hero.\n\nTogether with Jenny McCarthy Carrey is a prominent spokesperson and activist for the Generation Rescue foundation.\n\nFilms:\n\n1980 The Sex and Violence Family Hour\n\nThe All-Night Show\n\n1981 Rubberface (TV)\n\n1983 Copper Mountain (TV)\n\nAll in Good Taste\n\n1984 Finders Keepers\n\nThe Duck Factory (TV)\n\n1985 Once Bitten\n\n1986 Peggy Sue Got Married\n\n1988 The Dead Pool\n\n1989 Pink Cadillac\n\nMike Hammer: Murder Takes All (TV)\n\nEarth Girls Are Easy\n\n1990 In Living Color (TV)\n\n1991 High Strung Death\n\n1992 The Itsy Bitsy Spider\n\nDoing Time on Maple Drive (TV)\n\n1994 Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\n\nThe Mask\n\nDumb and Dumber\n\n1995 Batman Forever\n\nAce Ventura: When Nature Calls\n\n1996 The Cable Guy\n\n1997 Liar Liar\n\n1998 The Truman Show\n\nSimon Birch\n\n1999 Man on the Moon\n\n2000 Me, Myself & Irene\n\nHow the Grinch Stole Christmas\n\n2001 The Majestic\n\n2003 Bruce Almighty\n\nPecan Pie\n\n2004 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\n\n2005 Fun with Dick and Jane\n\n2007 The Number 23\n\n2008 Horton Hears a Who!\n\nYes Man\n\n2009 A Christmas Carol\n\n2010 I Love You Phillip Morris\n\n2011 Damn Yankees\n\n2012 Ripley's Believe It or Not!\n\nAwards:\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\n1995 -
