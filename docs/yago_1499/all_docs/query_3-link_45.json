        "text": "JIM Carrey is known by film fans around the world for his wacky characters and colourful life.\n\nHere's all you need to know about the man behind The Mask.\n\nWho is Jim Carrey and what's his net worth?\n\nBorn James Eugene Carrey on January 17, 1962, Jim, 56, is a Canadian-American actor, comedian, impressionist, screenwriter, musician, producer and painter.\n\nHe is known for his energetic slapstick performances in his movies and TV shows.\n\nJim first gained recognition in 1990 in the US after landing a recurring role in the sketch comedy TV series In Living Color.\n\nHe then made the leap to movies when he landed the lead role in the 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.\n\nCarey quickly became one of Hollywood's biggest stars with a string of hits including The Mask, Dumb and Dumber and Batman Forever.\n\nHe was even paid a whopping $20m for appearing in dark comedy The Cable Guy in 1996.\n\nThe actor then ventured into more serious roles in critically acclaimed dramas such as The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Man on the Moon.\n\nMore recently, he appeared on the small screen show Kidding.\n\nJim amassed an estimated £117million fortune during his time as an actor.\n\nThis is largely down to his A-list movie career having commanded $20m (£16m) for roles at the height of his fame in the 1990s and 2000s..\n\nWhat are his most famous movies?\n\nJim has racked up many hit movies, these include (in order of popularity):\n\nThe Mask (1994)\n\nDumb and Dumber (1994)\n\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)\n\nHow The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)\n\nBruce Almighty (2003)\n\nThe Truman Show (1998)\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n\nLiar Liar (1997)\n\nMan on the Moon (1999)\n\nYes Man (2008)\n\nHow many times has Jim been married?\n\nJim has been married twice.\n\nHis first marriage was to former actress and Comedy Store waitress Melissa Womer, whom he married in 1987 but divorced in 1995.\n\nTheir daughter, Jane, was born on September 6, 1987 and appeared on American Idol in 2012.\n\nIn 1996, Jim married his Dumb and Dumber co-star Lauren Holly but the marriage lasted less than a year.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the actor had a much-publicised, short-lived romance with his Me, Myself and Irene co-star Renée Zellweger, to whom he was engaged from 1999 to 2000.\n\nJim then met model and actress Jenny McCarthy in 2005 but the romance ended in 2010, with her going on to marry New Kinds On The Block star Donnie Wahlberg.\n\nOn September 28, 2015, Jim's former girlfriend Cathriona White was found dead from a prescription drug overdose.\n\nThe couple first met in 2012 and Jim was a pallbearer at her funeral in Ireland.\n\nIn 2016 Cathriona's husband at the time of her death, Mark Burton, filed a lawsuit for wrongful death against Jim, so did her mother.\n\nHowever the lawsuit was dismissed in January 2018, and attorneys for both sides confirmed there would be no further legal proceedings.\n\nWho is he dating?\n\nJim and Ginger Gonzaga called it quits at the end of 2019 and the actor has not been officially related to anyone else since then.\n\nOn January 7, 2019, Jim confirmed he was dating Ginger Gonzaga after the two went red-carpet-official at the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nThe American actress is Jim Carrey's first public relationship following the death of his ex Catriona White who overdosed in 2015.\n\nGinger, 34, and Jim are co-stars in the television series Kidding, which is how they met.\n\nThe couple made their red carpet debut at a Showtime party in Hollywood.\n\nHowever, their relationship was confirmed when the two lovebirds walked the Golden Globes red carpet in matching ensembles looking very happy.\n\nA representative for Jim confirmed that he is dating Ginger, with the pair laughing and smiling as they posed arm-in-arm in front of the cameras today."
