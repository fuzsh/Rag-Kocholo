        "text": "Jim Carrey's ex-girlfriend, Irish-born Cathriona White, was still married to another man at the time of her suspected suicide last week, Los Angeles County coroner's officials said Tuesday.\n\nWhite, a make-up artist who was dating Carrey in recent years, was found dead in her Los Angeles apartment on Sept. 28, the possible victim of an overdose of prescription medications. Pills were found near her body.\n\nAn autopsy has been performed but a final cause of death is pending toxicology tests, says Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter.\n\nWinter said his office has identified White's legal next-of-kin as her husband, Mark Burton, from whom she was separated five months before her death. Her body will be released to him, Winter said.\n\nIn addition, Winter said, White's stepmother and sister are in Los Angeles from Ireland helping Burton arrange to transport her body back to Ireland for burial.\n\nBurton is a cameraman in Los Angeles who met White there when they worked together on a project, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nFour days before her death, White tweeted a seemingly final message: \"Signing off on Twitter, I hope I have been a light to my nearest and dearest.\""
