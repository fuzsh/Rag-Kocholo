        "text": "Jim Carrey says he has found true happiness with lover Jenny McCarthy.\n\nThe Hollywood funnyman - who has been dating the former Playboy model for the last two years - was happily single until he met Jenny, who blew him away.\n\nHe said: \"I've beaten my head against that wall a bunch of times, and I suffered under the illusion for some time that you need to find someone to complete you. But that doesn't work.\n\n\"I spent a lot of years finding someone to hide behind, years when I wasn't walking beside someone but jumping on their back saying, 'Carry me!'\n\n\"But then about two years ago, I got to a place where I was happy - and perfectly content not to be in a relationship if it wasn't meant to be. And then, of course, that's when I met Jenny.\"\n\nDespite his love for Jenny, the 46-year-old star doesn't intend to marry the Scream 3 actress.\n\nJim, who has been divorced twice, said: \"I'm happy with Jenny, although I don't think I will get married again. If you've done it twice, you really should stop doing it. And everything is good anyway.\"\n\nJenny has previously said she does not care for marriage again.\n\n\"What is marriage a guarantee of? I'll be yours forever? I'll be faithful? Bull! It's really just a piece of paper.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old actress, has a five-year-old son Evan Asher with ex-husband John Asher.\n\n- BANG! SHOWBIZ"
