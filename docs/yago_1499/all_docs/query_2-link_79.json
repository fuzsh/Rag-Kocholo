        "text": "Jim Carrey is dating actress Ginger Gonzaga, PEOPLE confirms.\n\nThe two actors, who star in the Showtime series Kidding, were seen beaming at each other and walking hand in hand as they made their red carpet debut on Saturday at the Showtime Golden Globes Nominees Celebration in West Hollywood, California.\n\nA rep for the actor confirmed to PEOPLE that Gonzaga is Carrey’s girlfriend.\n\nDuring their outing, Gonzaga, 34, wore a plunging white dress with a pair of white and black heels. Carrey, 56, opted for a long black suit jacket with matching pants and a white shirt.\n\nGonzaga — who previously starred in the Showtime series I’m Dying Up Here, which Carrey executive-produced — went on to share a few sweet snapshots from their night out on her Instagram page.\n\nAlongside one photo of the couple posing together at the event, she alluded to their romantic relationship, writing, “Most partial to this talented nominee. #goldenglobes.”\n\nCarrey has been nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best performance by an actor in a television series, comedy or musical, for his role as Jeff, a children’s TV icon, on Kidding.\n\nCarrey recently opened up about his love life in November, explaining in an interview with the Radio Times that while he does lead an “isolated life,” he’s still putting himself out there.\n\n“I love to read and I enjoy painting and working on sculptures,” he said, according to the Daily Mail. “And I date.”\n\nRELATED: Jim Carrey to No Longer Face Civil Trial Over His Girlfriend’s Death"
