        "text": "Linda Ronstadt: After moving to LA to pursue his comedy dreams – and moving his parents in with him – Jim Carrey had an eight-month relationship with the singer Linda Ronstadt when he was 22 and she was 37. \"She was an absolutely incredible human being. She is an incredible human being,\" he told Howard Stern. Carrey said Ronstadt was so down to earth she didn't even mind that he would come to pick her up for dates in his \"crusty, rusty\" Chevrolet Bel Air. Carrey admitted he was \"really infatuated\" with Ronstadt, but \"the two of us knew it wasn't going to be a forever deal.\"\n\nRenee Zellweger: The Mask actor's next tumultuous relationship came when he met America's then-sweetheart Renee Zellweger. The two dated for 18 months, at which point Carrey presented her with a $60,000 ring after some alleged arm-twisting. But when he continued dragging his feet to get to the altar, Zellweger gave him an ultimatum and their romance was over.\n\nJenny McCarthy: Enter the age of Jenny McCarthy! Carrey met the Playboy model in 2005 and their bond over McCarthy's autistic son Evan began their long-term relationship. But five years down the road, the two split up and McCarthy waged war on her former flame for \"walking out\" on her son.\n\nCarrey expressed his condolences, sharing that he was \"shocked and deeply saddened' by White's death. He went on to describe her as a \"truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil.\""
