        "meta_description": "Lauren Holly and Jim were married for  about one year. During a stay at L.A.s Hotel Bel-Air in May, the famously madcap comedian lapsed into a blue Sinatra funk and spent a long, bizarre evening at the bar crooning ballads and tipping the piano player. Was the actor expressing his unhappiness over rumors that Holly was involved with Ed Burns, the director and costar of her upcoming film Long Time, Nothing New? For that matter, why wasnt Carrey sleeping at the couples $4.2 million Brentwood home? \r \r Question No. 2 at least can be answered: The interiors were being gutted and redesigned. But the houses inhabitants stood on very quick sand. On July 29, Holly, 31, called an end to 10 months of tumultuous marriage?and a one-month separation?by filing for divorce. (She is asking for a yet-unnamed amount in spousal support.) The former Picket Fences star has moved to Malibu, where she reportedly pals around with Madonna and Courtney Love; Carrey, 35, says one source, has been seeking solace from buddy Nicolas Cage. \r \r From the beginning the couple, who had fallen in love on the set of 94s Dumb & Dumber?both soon after leaving a first marriage?had a hard time staying on track. After at least one breakup, they finally swapped I dos last fall. When Carrey was shooting The Truman Show in Seaside, Fla., this year, Holly visited often. They seemed very much in love, says Beth Folta, a production liaison for the film. They seemed like newlyweds. Carrey sounded blissful. Marriage has a calming effect on me, he said. \r \r But every calm, it seems, precedes a storm. While some blame the break on his temper (I do have those moments where Ill throw a glass against the wall) and others point to Burns (who has denied being anything other than friends with Holly), still others say plain old career competition got in the way. With her last movie, Turbulence, having nose-dived at the box office, Holly may have gotten tired of living in her husbands shadow. Says an insider: She wanted to prove she could go out on her own. These days thats exactly what shes doing.",

        "text": "Attraction & Intensity\n\nAttraction Index evaluates a scope of qualities you find attractive in each other. From physical attractiveness and behavior to a spectrum of psychological traits and features, your score represents the chemistry or spark that motivated you to be with another person, and them with you. As a rule of thumb, the attraction is necessary but not sufficient for defining true love.\n\nIntensity Index outlines the challenges. Detailed investigation of connections determines which areas of your life are affected the most. It can be sexual intensity, strong desire to dominate, criticism, or deep contradictions in beliefs and lifestyles. While intense passion may work to your benefit, there are some levels of intensity people find difficult to accept. Jealousy, for example, can ruin relationships. Desire to manipulate can tear your safety net. You can be intensely in love for many years, but it shouldn't limit your independence.\n\nPeople with more than fifteen links between them have their scores higher than someone with five connections or less. As a rule, relationships with high-attraction and low-Intensity scores have more chances to survive in the long run and to bring more positive energy and mutual understanding. The excess of intense connections between people leads to break-ups and conflicts. Keep in mind that the level of intensity depends on your personal preferences and traits. Passionate people prefer more intense relationships; they are quickly bored with perfections. Others are looking for a harmonious and caring environment. If you research your previous relationships in-depth, you will discover the Attraction and Intensity Scores that fit you the best.\n\nCompatibility Chart\n\nMeeting someone is never an accident, no matter how long your relationship lasts. There are always lessons, challenges, and virtues. It's easy to see in your compatibility chart, what brought you together in this lifetime and how enjoyable or challenging your relationships are meant to be. If you are aiming for long-term relationships, look for family and benefits indexes. Special connections give you a sense of pre-destined call. Lessons and challenges highlight the problematic aspects that may work for your advantage in the long-run. Intensity adds an edge, while criticism in high doses can make or break your trust."
