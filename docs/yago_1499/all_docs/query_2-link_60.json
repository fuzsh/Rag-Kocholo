        "text": "JIM Carrey will face a wrongful death trial over the suicide of his late ex-girlfriend Cathriona White following a claim that he supplied the drugs that contributed to her death.\n\nBut who was Cathriona? Who is making the accusations and what happens now? Here's the latest on the case...\n\nWho was Cathriona White?\n\nCathriona White was a make-up artist from County Tipperary, Ireland.\n\nFrom 2012 to her death in 2015, she was on/off dating the Hollywood actor, Jim Carrey.\n\nThe talented 30-year-old worked on as a stylist on a number of high-profile over the years and working with famous celebrities such as David Hasselhoff and Lyndie Greenwood.\n\nHowever, Cathriona suffered from depression, and had threatened suicide before taking her live in 2015.\n\nShe passed away on September 28 after overdosing on a variety of prescription pills at her home in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore committing suicide, she wrote on Twitter: \"Signing off Twitter, I hope I have been a light to my nearest and dearest. Peace and love to you all.\"\n\nDid she leave any suicide notes?\n\nFollowing her death, it emerged that Cathriona threatened suicide during her relationship with Carrey, writing that she was “too messed up for anyone to love” in one message in 2012, reports TMZ.\n\nIn another, after they split in 2013, she accused Carrey, 54, of giving her STDs and wrote: “My blood is on your hands,” investigators have found.\n\nIn a suicide note, she tells Carrey \"Jim You ruined my life. And even after doing so you added insult upon insult on top,\" she writes in one note for 2012.\n\nAhead of her death, she also uploaded an image to Instagram with the caption: \"Faeries, come take me out of this dull world,\n\n\"For I would ride with you upon the wind,\n\n\"Run on the top of the dishevelled tide, And dance upon the mountains like a flame. W.B. Yeats.\"\n\nAnother not written by her two years before she took her own life has also come to light.\n\nIt alleges that the Hollywood actor introduced Cathriona to drugs, prostitutes, and STDs.\n\nThe note was written on her iPad on April 8, 2013 but it is not known if she sent it to the Canadian-born actor, reported DailyMail.com.\n\nCathriona White was a talented make-up artist from Ireland who dated the Hollywood actor from 2012\n\nWho is Mark Burton?\n\nAt the time of her death, Cathriona was married to Mark Burton, a cameraman she met in Los Angeles while work on an online comedy series.\n\nEd Winter, the assistant chief of the Los Angeles coroner’s office, told The Times: \"I understand that she and Mr Burton were going to divorce but they were still officially married at the time of her death so he is her official next-of-kin.\"\n\nMark Burton claims his lawsuit is \"on the grounds of wrongful death and violation of the drug dealer liability act\".\n\nIt accuses Carrey of illegally obtaining the prescription drugs which Cathriona used to kill herself.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims the actor gave her the drugs “despite the fact that he knew full well that Ms. White was ill equipped to ingest and manage highly addictive prescription drugs outside the care of a licensed physician; was prone to depression; and had previously attempted to take her own life.”\n\nThe coroner’s report stated that the bottles of likely used for Cathriona's suicide were under the name of Arthur King.\n\nCathriona's mother has since supported the claim.\n\nHow has Jim Carrey reacted?\n\nCarrey has since released a statement saying the filing is a \"terrible shame\".\n\nThe 54-year-old added: \"It would be easy for me to get in a back room with this man's lawyer and make this go away, but there are some moments in life when you have to stand up and defend your honour against the evil in this world.\n\n\"I will not tolerate this heartless attempt to exploit me or the woman I loved.\n\n\"Cat's troubles were born long before I met her and sadly her tragic end was beyond anyone's control.\n\n\"I really hope that some day soon people will stop trying to profit from this and let her rest in peace.\"\n\nDid Jim Carrey stand trial?\n\nIn June 2017, a judge confirmed a trial will go ahead over claims Jim used his \"wealth, influence and celebrity status\" to provide the prescription drugs that contributed to the overdose of Cathriona.\n\nThe trial was expected to begin in April 2018, and Jim was expected to face a jury over claims of wrongful death and allegations under the Drug Dealer Liability Act in America.\n\nJim reportedly tried to seek a privacy request, but a judge denied the request and his attempts to remove allegations that he transmitted STDs to Cathriona - with the judge ruling Jim's privacy concerns are not a top priority.\n\nBefore the case even got to trial, Jim was cleared wrongful death after his lawyer proved Cathriona tried to blackmail the actor with faked STD test results.\n\nWhite's family claimed Jim supplied her with drugs following her fatal overdose in 2015 and infected her with three sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs).\n\nJim's legal team proved that White forged medical records which showed that she had no STDs before she met Carrey.\n\nThe wrongful death lawsuits, filed by White’s estranged husband Mark Burton, and mother Brigid Sweetman, were dismissed January 25, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Ace Ventura star filed a countersuit last September claiming that the legal action was an attempt to exploit a famous actor.\n\nCarrey claimed that White tried to blackmail him by threatening to feed the press with false allegations that he had infected her with STDs.\n\nShe also alleged that the actor, known for hit movies such as Dumb and Dumber and The Truman Show, introduced her \"to cocaine and prostitutes\".\n\nWhite’s family alleged that Carrey supplied her with illegal drugs which she used to overdose.\n\nThey also claimed that the alleged STDs contributed to her mental distress.\n\nLast year, Carrey’s attorney Raymond Boucher demanded that the court compel Burton to provide White’s STD test results.\n\nThe actor’s legal team concluded that the 2011 document, showing that White was clear of STDs before she met Carrey, had been forged.\n\nA spokesman for Carrey told the Hollywood Reporter: “Jim is looking forward to moving on with his life now.”\n\nA lawyer representing White’s family reportedly said: “We have no further comment at this time.”\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans on (free) 116123 or 020 7734 2800."
