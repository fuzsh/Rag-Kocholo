        "text": "Twice-married Carrey, who dated glamour model Jenny McCarthy for almost five years before splitting in 2010 - is said to have realised he was ready to marry again when he turned 50 in January - and believes Anastasia, 30, is the one for him, reported Daily Star online.\n\n\"Jim is going to propose. He is absolutely crazy about Anastasia and couldn't be happier. She is really smart, but what he likes best about her is her sense of humour. She makes him laugh. Jim confessed to Anastasia, 'It's not always easy being with me, in more ways than one.' But he added, 'I promise to make it worth your while,'\" a source said.\n\nThe father-of-one was previously married to his Dumb And Dumber co-star Lauren Holly from 1996 to 1997, and to actor and waitress Melissa Womer from 1987 to 1995.\n\nThey have one child, daughter Jane, 24, together. He has also dated America's Next Top Model star Indian model Anchal Joseph."
