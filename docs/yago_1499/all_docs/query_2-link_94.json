        "text": "Mariah Carey married to Tommy Mottola from 1993 to 1998 Mariah Carey married to Nick Cannon from 2008 to 2016\n\nIs Jim Carey related to Mariah Carey?\n\nNo, they are not related. Jim's surname has two R's (Jim Carrey), while Mariah only has one. So they do not have the same last name.\n\nAre Jim Carey and Chip Carey related?\n\nNo, they're not related. Chip Carey is related to the late Harry Carey (a play-by-play announcer for the Chicago Cubs). The comedian Jim Carrey isn't related to that family. It's a different spelling."
