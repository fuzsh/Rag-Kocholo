        "text": "JIM Carrey's former girlfriend Cathriona White died of suicide by overdose in 2015.\n\nCathriona was a makeup artist from Ireland, and Carrey came under fire after he was accused of supplying the drugs which contributed to her death.\n\nWho was Cathriona White?\n\nCathriona was a make-up artist from County Tipperary, Ireland.\n\nFrom 2012 until her death, she dated Carrey on and off again.\n\nThe talented 30-year-old also worked as a stylist on a number of high-profile over the years alongside famous celebrities such as David Hasselhoff and Lyndie Greenwood.\n\nBut the Irish makeup artist suffered from depression, and had threatened suicide prior to taking her own life in 2015.\n\nShe died on September 28, 2015, after overdosing on a variety of prescription pills at her home in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore committing suicide, she wrote a haunting note on Twitter: \"Signing off Twitter, I hope I have been a light to my nearest and dearest. Peace and love to you all.\"\n\nDid she leave any suicide notes?\n\nFollowing her death, it emerged that Cathriona threatened suicide multiple times during her relationship with Carrey, and wrote that she was “too messed up for anyone to love.\"\n\nIn another, after they split in 2013, she accused Carrey, 54, of giving her venereal disease and wrote: “My blood is on your hands,” investigators have found.\n\nIn a suicide note, she wrote to Carrey: \"Jim, you ruined my life. And even after doing so you added insult upon insult on top.\"\n\nAhead of her death, she also uploaded an image to Instagram with the caption: \"Faeries, come take me out of this dull world,\n\n\"For I would ride with you upon the wind, Run on the top of the dishevelled tide, And dance upon the mountains like a flame. W.B. Yeats.\"\n\nAnother note written by her two years before she took her own life has also come to light.\n\nIt alleges that the Hollywood actor introduced Cathriona to drugs, prostitutes, and STDs.\n\nThe note was written on her iPad on April 8, 2013 but it is not known if she sent it to the Canadian-born actor, reported DailyMail.com.\n\nWho is Mark Burton?\n\nAt the time of her death, Cathriona was married to Mark Burton, a cameraman she met in Los Angeles while work on an online comedy series.\n\nEd Winter, the assistant chief of the Los Angeles coroner’s office, told The Times: \"I understand that she and Mr Burton were going to divorce but they were still officially married at the time of her death so he is her official next-of-kin.\"\n\nMark Burton claimed his lawsuit is \"on the grounds of wrongful death and violation of the drug dealer liability act\".\n\nIt accused Carrey of illegally obtaining the prescription drugs which Cathriona used to kill herself.\n\nThe lawsuit also claimed the actor gave her the drugs “despite the fact that he knew full well that Ms. White was ill equipped to ingest and manage highly addictive prescription drugs outside the care of a licensed physician; was prone to depression; and had previously attempted to take her own life.”\n\nThe coroner’s report stated that the bottles of likely used for Cathriona's suicide were under the name of Arthur King.\n\nCathriona's mother had supported the claim.\n\nDid Jim Carrey stand trial?\n\nIn June 2017, a judge confirmed a trial was to go ahead over claims Carrey used his \"wealth, influence and celebrity status\" to provide the prescription drugs that contributed to the overdose of Cathriona.\n\nCarrey reportedly tried to seek a privacy request, but a judge denied the request and his attempts to remove allegations that he transmitted STDs to Cathriona - with the judge ruling Jim's privacy concerns are not a top priority.\n\nBut in February 2018, the case was dismissed before it went to trial.\n\nCarrey was cleared wrongful death after his lawyer proved Cathriona tried to blackmail the actor with faked STD test results.\n\nJim's legal team proved that Cathriona had forged medical records which showed that she had no STDs before she met Carrey.\n\nThe wrongful death lawsuits, filed by White’s estranged husband Mark Burton, and mother Brigid Sweetman, were dismissed January 2017, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans on (free) 116123 or 020 7734 2800."
