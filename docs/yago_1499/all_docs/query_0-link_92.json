        "text": "This day in history, Dec. 16: 'Dumb and Dumber' released with Lauren Holly\n\nDec. 16, 1994: The movie \"Dumb and Dumber,\" co-starring actress and Geneva native Lauren Holly, is released in U.S. theaters.\n\nPraised by a San Francisco Chronicle reviewer as \"easily the funniest movie of the year\" and derided by the Washington Post as \"an execrable catalogue of doody jokes,\" the film helped boost rising star Jim Carrey's popularity and was an early hit for comedy filmmakers Peter and Bobby Farrelly.\n\n\"Dumb and Dumber\" was the sixth biggest hit at the box office in 1994, grossing $127.1 million in the U.S. and $247.3 million worldwide.\n\nAlready an established actress at this point in her career, Holly played Mary Swanson, a beautiful heiress whose husband had been kidnapped and who was the romantic interest of both lead characters.\n\nHolly went on to marry Carey in 1996, but they were divorced less than a year later. A sequel to the movie is planned next year with both Carrey and co-star Jeff Daniels, but Holly will not appear in it.\n\nAccording to her bio on imdb.com, Holly graduated from Geneva High School in 1981 and was a cheerleader there. Her father taught English literature at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva and her mother taught art history at the University of Rochester."
