        "text": "Cathriona White, the late girlfriend of Jim Carrey, was revealed to have been married at the time of her death. Now, ET can confirm her husband is Mark Damian Burton.\n\nAccording to records in Clark County, Nevada, the two married on Jan. 14, 2013 at the Heavenly Bliss Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas.\n\nFollowing the completion of an autopsy on Sunday -- the results of which are pending a toxicology report and will not be released for another eight to 10 weeks -- Whiteâs body could only be released to Burton, who is listed as her next of kin. Whiteâs body was released on Monday afternoon, ET confirms.\n\nWATCH: Jim Carrey and Cathriona White 'Looked Really Happy' on Final Date\n\nA source tells ET, \"As far as Jim was concerned, Cat was separated from her husband. She was planning on starting divorce proceedings in December. He would never have been out publicly with her if she was still with her husband and still married.\"\n\nWhite was found dead of an apparent suicide in her home on Monday, Sept. 28. Several notes were found at the scene, including one addressed to Carrey, whom White dated on and off for three years. The couple was most recently spotted on a romantic dinner date on Sept. 19.\n\nWATCH: Jim Carrey Visits With Late Girlfriend Cathriona Whiteâs Sister\n\nWhile they await the return of their daughterâs body to Ireland, where she will be buried next to her late father, Whiteâs family mourns their loss. \"The family of Cathriona White sincerely regret the untimely passing of their beloved daughter and sister,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"Cathriona was a shining light in our lives who was loved deeply by her entire family. We will miss her terribly and at this difficult time we ask to be left in private to mourn our loss.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nWATCH: A Timeline of Jim Carrey and Cathriona Whiteâs Relationship\n\nRelated Articles"
