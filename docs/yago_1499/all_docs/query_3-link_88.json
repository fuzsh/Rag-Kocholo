        "text": "Hollywood star Jim Carrey posted a touching online tribute about his ex-girlfriend Cathriona White on the same day he carried her coffin alongside her family and friends at her funeral.\n\nThe actor wrote on Twitter: ‘Love cannot be lost’ and added an emoji of a rose and a photo that appears to be a silhouette of himself and White lovingly looking at each other.\n\nCarrey, 53, arrived at Saturday's funeral in Cappawhite, Co Tipperary, in a blacked-out Mercedes people carrier and spoke briefly to a couple of locals as he entered Our Lady of Fatima church in the small Irish village.\n\nHe was wearing a pair of dark, gold-rimmed sunglasses, a sombre black suit and dark jacket.\n\nCarrey, 53, flew into Ireland yesterday on board a Gulfstream V private jet to say his final goodbye to his ex-girlfriend, who he once described as his 'delicate Irish flower'.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nDuring the highly emotional ceremony yesterday, Ms White was described as 'a small-town girl with big dreams who was not afraid to follow them'.\n\nParish priest Fr Tadgh Furlong told mourners: 'We gather around Cathriona’s body in our parish church - all too soon, too early.\n\n'In 1985 Cathriona was baptised with joy into this Christian community. We assemble now in a very different atmosphere to welcome her home. We gather in silent, sad, grief-stricken fáilte. At this time we welcome home one of our own.\n\n'The circumstances of our being here today cause us great sadness and remind us how vulnerable we are. We need God’s blessing and the support of each other.'\n\nHe said: 'Cathriona’s approach to life was to take on, to challenge the county, the country, the world. You remember the outgoing personality; the strong-willed, determined character.\n\n'Cathriona was a light to so many. Something of the light has gone out. Yet much remains. The light continues to shine. The light of love lives on; the love you had for Cathriona; the love she had for you.'\n\nIn a tribute, her half-brother Tadgh said: 'She followed them all the way to LA, and you could not get any bigger than that.'\n\nDuring the service, a lone tin whistle played a haunting traditional Irish lament.\n\nIn an emotional eulogy, Ms White's step sister, Sarah, said Cathriona had 'an amazing capacity to love and to be loved'.\n\nThanking the community for their support she said: 'On behalf of our family I would like to thank you all for coming today as we remember our granddaughter, daughter, sister, niece, cousin, aunt and friend.\n\n'When I started writing this I didn’t know where to begin. How do you summarise such an amazing life in just a few words?\n\n'But the more I thought about it the more I came to realise that I just needed one word – love.\n\n'Cathriona had such an amazing capacity to love and to be loved. From growing up in Cappawhite, through to moving to Clonmel and finally settling in LA, love remained a constant in her life from beginning to end.'\n\nMs White told mourners about her step-sister's deep passion for Gaelic games (known as GAA), especially her beloved local team Tipperary.\n\n'Anyone who has ever sat beside Cathriona during a hurling match will know her grá for GAA. She was a very vocal supporter.\n\n'Anyone who saw her lurking around LA with a camera trying to capture the poor conditions in which the homeless were forced to live will know not just her love and talent for photography but also the desire that she had for the world to be a better place because she was in it, and it was.\n\n'Her family meant so much to her. From following Lisa and James around as a toddler, right through to doting on Tadhg, Aoibhínn, Ciaran, Darragh, Cara, Kayla and Leah and all of the highs and lows in between – family was so important to her,' she added.\n\nHer step sister Sarah added: 'Cathriona was more of a Daddy’s girl that anyone else I’ve ever met and although losing them both in such a short time is unimaginably difficult for us we can take some comfort in the knowledge that Cathriona and Pat are together again.\n\nThe tragic 30-year-old makeup artist described herself as a 'daddy's girl' on her Instagram account, posting several moving photographs of herself and her father.\n\nMr White died from brain cancer in September 2012 and Ms White was unable to return to Ireland for his funeral because she was living in the United States illegally and would not have been able to return to LA.\n\nHundreds of people joined the White family last night as her body was removed from her grandfather's funeral home to Our Lady of Fatima Church in the south Tipperary village. The scenes were repeated today as the town came to a standstill during the moving ceremony.\n\nThe parish church was packed to capacity with friends, relatives and neighbours of the family saying a final farewell to Ms White. A special speaker system was rigged up outside the church so those unable to find a seat could follow the service.\n\nIn preparation for the funeral, Carrey flew into Dublin Airport in the early hours of yesterday morning on board a specially chartered Gulfstream V private jet.\n\nLast night, the coffin was carried by members Ms White’s family, including her brother James, who served in the British Army and is a decorated Afghan war hero, from the funeral home to a waiting black hearse before it was taken to the church.\n\nThe procession followed behind the coffin, led by Ms White’s mother Brigid, stepmother Brid, brother James, sister Lisa, half sisters Sarah and Larina and stepbrother Tadgh. Ms White, who took her own life at her Los Angeles home last month. She was laid to rest beside her father Pat following a highly emotional funeral service.\n\nThe family plot in the local cemetery was prepared yesterday ahead of the burial service.\n\nA large gathering of photographers and reporters waited outside White's Funeral Directors in Cappawhite yesterday evening, while a large media presence is also due to be in attendance today at Our Lady of Fatima Church in the south Tipperary village.\n\nFriends of the White family described the make up artist as 'a quiet and gentle girl'.\n\nMs White's family has asked mourners not to send flowers, but to instead donate money to two charities, the Simon Community, which works with homeless people, and the Circle of Friends, which supports people suffering with cancer.\n\nCarrey arrived at Dublin Airport at 2.20am yesterday morning, in a Gulfstream V jet, owned by Flower in the Field Aviation in Santa Monica believed to have been carrying the actor and a small entourage.\n\nThe aircraft costs $4,800 an hour to charter, with the return trip from Los Angeles to Ireland costing in the region of $100,000.\n\nIt began its journey in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California, where local police have been investigating Ms White's death, on September 28.\n\nSeveral suicide notes were found in Ms White's home and police discovered prescription pills next to her body, some of which were reportedly obtained under an alias used by Jim Carrey.\n\nRadarOnline.com claimed to have spoken to someone who had seen Ms White's suicide note, which allegedly read: 'Jim, I love you. Please forgive me. I'm not for this world.'\n\nA memorial service was held in Los Angels on Tuesday night.\n\nHer friends in Los Angeles held a memorial service on Tuesday.\n\nA friend shared a photo of the sign that greeted guests at Zorthian Ranch where the service was held, which featured a quote from Eckhart Tolle.\n\nUnder a black and white photo of White it said: 'You are not separate from the whole. You are one with the sun, the earth, the air. You don't have a life. You are life.'\n\n'Goodbye Cat. I love you,' wrote her friend Joshua Shultz on Instagram, sharing the photo of White from the service.\n\nHer friend Jenny Burpee posted a photo of the sunset at Zorthia Ranch, writing: 'This sunset was for you dearest Cat.'\n\nWhite was also branded a failure by her own mother just days before she took her own life, it has emerged.\n\nAccording to gossip site TMZ, White received the message from Brigid Sweetman on the day of her 30th birthday. She killed herself nine days afterwards, on the third anniversary of her father's death.\n\nPolice investigating the death reportedly revealed the existence of the message - and also discovered that White had tried to kill herself before, in 2012, not long after the death of her father.\n\nMark Burton, 38, was listed as her next of kin on official documents but the couple had separated and were planning to divorce later this year.\n\nBurton, a Hollywood cameraman, is understood to be a Scientologist, and has previously lived in Clearwater, Florida, where the church has its headquarters.\n\nHe now lives in the small town of McMinnville, Oregon, where he has not been seen since his estranged wife's suicide last week.\n\nHis home, an old-fashioned clapperboard house painted dove gray, sits in a quiet tree-filled suburb of the town of 32,000 people, in Yamhill County, south-west of Portland.\n\nBurton has not been seen regularly over the last week and generally keeps a low profile. His white pick-up truck has not moved all week.\n\nOn their Las Vegas wedding certificate, White gave his home town as McMinnville. Public records suggest he was brought up in California and had also spent time in his twenties in Los Angeles and suburban New York.\n\nOther public records suggest that he had business interests in California at the time. He has however held local hunting licences at a different address in the town.\n\nAmong the projects Burton and White worked on together were the short films; The Online Gamer: Zombies and The Online Gamer: Wedding.\n\n'There is no way that Jim would have taken her out to public places if he thought she was married,' the source close to Carrey's family told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n'As far as Jim was concerned, Cat was separated from her husband and was going to start divorce proceedings in December.
