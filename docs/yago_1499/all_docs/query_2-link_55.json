        "text": "During the 1990s and the 2000s, Jim Carrey was one of the biggest names in Hollywood.\n\nHe may have not been a heartthrob like Leo, Brad, or George, but his consistently funny performances and impersonations help cement him as one of the most legendary comedic actors.\n\nAnd Carrey had the salary to match: for his role in How the Grinch Stole Christmas, he was paid a whopping $20 million, making him one of the best-paid actors of that year.\n\nBut things have been quiet on the Jim Carrey front lately. Apart from a stint as the villain in the Sonic movies, we haven't heard much from the funnyman – until he announced in 2022 his plans to retire.\n\nAnd now, the comedic legend is celebrating his 62nd birthday with a rare social media appearance.\n\nHere's everything you n eed to know about Jim Carrey and the end of his career.\n\nREAD MORE: Save $150 on brand-new Samsung Galaxy S24 before it hits shelves\n\nWhat happened to Jim Carrey?\n\nJim Carrey decided to retire after losing his passion for acting in films.\n\n\"I just didn't want to be in the business anymore. I didn't like what was happening, the corporations taking over and all that,\" Carrey revealed in 2018, in conversation with The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nREAD MORE: Catherine hospitalised for up to two weeks after surgery\n\nFollowing his 2014 film Dumb and Dumber To, which was a critical failure, he took a step back, only appearing in smaller budget films for a couple of years.\n\nHe made something of a comeback in 2018, starring in and producing the comedy drama series Kidding, followed by a role as the villain in the Sonic movie adaptations.\n\nHowever, after the release the second Sonic film in 2022, Jim Carrey revealed that he was taking another break from acting, with plans to retire.\n\n\"I feel like I have enough, I've done enough, I am enough,\" he told Access Hollywood. \"I really like my quiet life,\" he added, describing his new passion of painting.\n\n\"It depends.

In 1994, before he had reached peak fame, Carey earned US$540,000 (AUD $820,000) to star in The Mask.\n\nHas Jim Carrey ever won an Oscar?\n\nNot only has Carrey never won an Oscar, but he's never been nominated.\n\nSome believe that his performances in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were Oscar-worthy, but he's never been recognised by the Academy.\n\nHe has won two Best Actor Golden Globes, for The Truman Show and Man on the Moon."
