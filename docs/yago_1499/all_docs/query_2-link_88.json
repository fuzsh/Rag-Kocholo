        "text": "The girlfriend of Jim Carrey, who was found dead last week in a suspected suicide, was married at the time of her death, it has emerged.\n\nCarrey and White first began dating in 2012 and had been in an on-off relationship for three years, which ended last month.\n\n\"As far as Jim was concerned, Cat was separated from her husband and was going to start divorce proceedings in December. When people are separated they date or do whatever they need to do.\"\n\nWhite, who left her native County Tipperary several years ago, is to be buried in Ireland beside her father, Pat, who died of cancer in 2012.\n\nCarrey, 53, is expected to attend.\n\nA source told The Sunday People: \"Jim has been left devastated after the tragic death of Cathriona.\n\n\"Attending her funeral in Ireland will be the least he could do to pay tribute to the woman he loved.\"\n\nThe source said the actor had been in touch in White's family, who wanted him at the funeral. \"They know how much he meant to her,\" the source added.\n\nWhite's mother Brigid and sister Lisa flew to Los Angeles to take her body home to Ireland last week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carrey was spotted arriving at his former lover's home in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles. He reportedly spoke with White's sister Lisa and the pair left with a stack of boxes a few hours later.\n\n\"She was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil\"\n\nJim Carrey\n\nHe may be questioned about White's death â€“ which came five days after The Mask star ended their relationship. She reportedly wrote about the break-up in a note she left behind.\n\nWhite, a Scientologist, had been taking \"survival\" courses at the religion's celebrity center in the past few months, according to DailyMail.com.\n\nFriends of the White family paid tribute to Cathriona, described as \"a quiet and gentle girl\".\n\n\"Her family would be very well-known in the local community and they were very involved,\" councillor Mary Hanna Hourigan said.\n\n\"The whole town here is devastated by the news."
