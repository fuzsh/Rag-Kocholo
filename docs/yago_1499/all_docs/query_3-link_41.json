        "text": "Jim Carrey has been cleared of any role in the suicide of his ex-girlfriend after his lawyer proved she forged medical records in an attempt to prove he had given her three sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).\n\nThe 56-year-old star was sued by the mother and estranged husband of Cathriona White following her death in 2015, with the Irish-born make-up artist having taken an overdose of prescription pills.\n\nNotes found at her home revealed she was upset at the breakdown of her on-off relationship with Carrey, which had begun in 2013.\n\nBrigid Sweetman and Mark Burton both accused Carrey of providing the drugs to the 30-year-old, and said he had obtained them illegally under a false name.\n\nCarrey denied the claims and filed a countersuit against the pair in September, insisting the lawsuits were an attempt to exploit him.\n\nThe actor also said that Ms White had blackmailed him by threatening to go public with what he said were false claims that he had given her STDs unless he paid her millions of dollars.\n\nHe had previously paid her an undisclosed sum to settle the accusations.\n\nIn a statement issued when he filed the countersuit, Carrey described the \"depth of deception\" behind the lawsuits as \"unimaginable\".\n\nNow his attorney, Raymond Boucher, has found that Ms White edited information on a friend's old STD test to make it look like it belonged to her - and then intended to use it to accuse the actor.\n\nThrough his investigation, Mr Boucher discovered that the forged results sheet was from a 2011 test, and that Ms White had tried to use it to prove she was clean before entering into a relationship with Carrey.\n\nMs Sweetman and Mr Burton had said contracting the STDs from Carrey had caused Ms White mental distress, which could have contributed to her taking her own life.\n\nThe case against the Canadian-born comedian has now been dismissed, his representative said, who added that he was \"looking forward to moving on with his life\".\n\nMichael Avenatti, the attorney for Ms Sweetman and Mr Burton, has offered no comment."
