        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Oct 29 — The 52-year-old funnyman has been married twice before, and his latest contractual union with actress Lauren Holly ended back in 2007 after just one year. He has now made it clear he has no desire to walk down the aisle again unless something drastic happens to change his mind.\n\n“I just don’t see it as necessary, at this point,” Jim said during an interview with Howard Stern on his Sirius XM radio show. “I can’t say that I know how I would feel if I meet somebody that knocks my head off. I mean, I can’t make hard, fast rules about the future. But I wouldn’t voluntarily go that way.”\n\nThe “Bruce Almighty” actor also revealed his secret to keeping his love life out of the limelight. He told the shock jock he now tries to date women who aren’t as famous as his former girlfriend Jenny McCarthy, whom he dated until 2010.\n\n“That’s one of the keys, for sure, because you’re not a commodity that’s sell-able,” Jim told Howard. “It’s not personal. It’s just, if you hook up with someone that’s famous, you become a sell-able commodity and that’s the most important thing in those magazines. It’s not what you’re doing in the movies, it’s: ‘Who are you with? What are you doing? Are you breaking up?’”\n\nJim was married to his first wife Melissa Womer from 1987 until 1995, then Lauren from 1996 until 1997. He then met model and actress Jenny in 2005 and the couple remained together for five years. — Cover Media"
