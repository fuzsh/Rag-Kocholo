        "text": "Hollywood’s favorite quipster, Jim Carrey, might be a cherished actor, but it turns out he’s also a ladies’ man, especially when it comes to high-profile actresses in the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only has he been married twice (and divorced both times), but The Truman Show star has also been romantically involved with a throng of A-listers, and that too unabashedly publicly.\n\nInside Jim Carrey’s Scandalous Romance With Lauren Holly\n\nWhile Jim Carrey‘s professional life is star-studded with accolades and acclaim, his personal life has been nothing short of a roller-coaster of turbulent relationships. Carrey’s first nuptial collapse came circa 1995 followed by his divorce from Melissa Womer (they’d filed for divorce in ’93 and were legally separated before it got finalized) after eight years of marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the Canadian-American actor was occupied with newfound stardom thanks to megahits like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Mask. But sometime around ’94 when he was busy making big-boy moves in the industry, rumors sparked about Carrey’s “romantic involvement” with his Dumb and Dumber co-star Lauren Holly.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman in ’94, the actor and producer being the comedic genius that he is, was able to tactfully deal with the subject of his alleged fling with Holly.\n\nI want to tell people that if you go to a newsstand and read about me in these rags, you know, 90% of what you’re reading is absolute garbage. It’s total fabrication […] Then they get into my personal life…check this out, ‘[Carrey] is said to be romantically involved with Dumb and Dumber co-star, Lauren Holly.’ Now, I don’t know where they dream this stuff up. I mean, so we sleep together 4-5 times a week. Does that mean we’re romantically involved? No, of course not, we’re just good friends.\n\nBut, as it turns out, Carrey not only dated Holly but even tied the knot with her just a year after his split with his first ex-wife became official. “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what happened,” Womer told The Spokesman-Review of Carrey’s amorous affair with Holly. “I personally think she may have been involved a lot sooner than they are letting on.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stars, however, didn’t seem to align for the former lovebirds who ended up parting ways after less than a year of marital bliss.\n\nLauren Holly Was Called A “Gold Digger” After Divorcing Jim Carrey\n\nHolly, 60, – who catapulted into the limelight thanks to her screwball comedy with Carrey which turned out to be her breakout film – faced her fair share of plights throughout her highly publicized affair and break-up with the award-winning actor.\n\nThe NCIS alum admitted that while there were some “fun” parts about being swarmed by the paparazzi following her novel fame, it soon became an invasion of her privacy and the sanctity of her relationship with the Bruce Almighty star at the time (via CBC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went through a really tough period because…you know, I was with Jim Carrey for years and people didn’t realize, they all think it’s just the marriage that was short, but we were together for a long time […] When we got divorced, I had a really hard time because, uh, no one ever really had the story right or anything, and I always felt like everybody knew my personal business, and not to mention the fact that I was going through a heartbreak.\n\nEven after she broke it off with Carrey, 62, The Final Storm star still struggled with all the sordid attention she received from people because of the media, so much so that she couldn’t even have a cup of coffee without the barista insinuating/calling her a “gold digger.” “I would just feel, like, so terrible,” Holly said."
