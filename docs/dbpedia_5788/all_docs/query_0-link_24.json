From the names of the characters, to specific reappearing numbers, to the exact length of the film, every little detail has a purpose and meaning, and every single detail builds up on Nolan’s goal- to incept the audience. As somebody that has watched Inception 5 times, I can definitely tell you that although Inception isn’t one of those alien-space-battle type of movies, it is without doubt included in the genre of science-fiction. The film is a story about human beings, with a human problem and solution- but nothing in the film would have happened without the scientific content. And Inception wouldn’t be as much of a well-known film with millions of conspiracies and theories, if it wasn’t for the ambiguity and Nolan’s sneaky inception on the audience."
