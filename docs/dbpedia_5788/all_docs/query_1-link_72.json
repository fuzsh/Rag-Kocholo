        "text": "If you've ever dreamed of living your best Parisian life, Emily in Paris starring Lily Collins, has undoubtedly fueled your desire to visit the City of Love, Light, Fashion and Croissants. The show is a visual love letter to the city, featuring a treasure trove of picturesque locations that capture the essence of Parisian charm. From Emily's chic apartment in the Latin Quarter to the stunning bridges overlooking the Seine, these iconic spots have become must-visit destinations for fans of the series. With Season 4, Part 1, dropping on August 15 and Part 2 following on September 12, thereâ€™s much to look forward to in Paris and on Netflix.\n\nWhile Paris has been romanticized in its depiction in the books by Ernest Hemingway and Victor Hugo and in movies like Midnight in Paris, Before Sunset, and Moulin Rouge, there is no reason not to explore it through the eyes of Emily Cooper. So, if you are looking to hop on a trip to the fashion capital and want to live an instagrammable life, hereâ€™s how you can chalk down your ultimate itinerary and visit the best Emily in Paris locations! Grab your beret, the ever-optimistic attitude of Emily, and explore the Paris of your dreams!\n\nEmily in Paris Locations You Cannot Miss!\n\n#1 Jardin du Palais Royale\n\nOne of the first Emily in Paris locations that enchanted its viewers was the Jardin du Palais Royale. It's shown in the first episode of the show â€“ a significant place where Emily meets Mindy during a lunch break. Mindy, a nanny, and Emily, a budding marketing executive, strike a close kinship with each other. This beautiful landscape, situated in the city's heart, is now part of the government buildings and is located a few steps from the Musee du Louvre. You will also find several antique stores and jewellery boutiques surrounding the gardens. Truly one of the best places for a quiet stroll!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBetween March and May\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2-3 Hours\n\n#2 Palace of Versailles\n\nThe Palace of Versailles, a former residence of King Louis XIV, is a renowned French landmark famous for its 17th-century French art. The garden surrounding the palace is one of the most spectacular in the world, with 372 statues, 600 fountains and 55 water features. The magnificent Hall of Mirrors, comprising 357 mirrors, has become one of the most talked about features of the palace. This Hall of Mirrors was featured in season 2, where Gregory Dupree's mix of the couture-ballet-catwalk show takes place. The palace is an hour's drive from the city, and you can experience the luxury of Versailles with a Versailles Palace All Access Passport that gives you entry to Royal grand apartments, gardens, Hall of Mirrors, temporary exhibits, Queen's Hamlet, and so much more!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBetween April and June\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2-3 hours\n\n#3 Pont Alexandre III\n\nAmong the more popular spots from the filming locations of Emily in Paris is Pont Alexandre III. Itâ€™s the setting for the Savoir teamâ€™s filming of the provocative perfume ad for Antoine Lambert, adding a touch of glamor and controversy to the storyline. More of them both, please! One of the cityâ€™s most stunning bridges, this is where you will also find the ornate lamp posts with the Seine in the background, that was the scene in popular films like Moulin Rouge, Chocolat, Bollywood film An Evening In Paris, Ronin and Midnight in Paris.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBoth day and night offer unique experiences on Pont Alexandre III. During the day, you can actually see the bridgeâ€™s intricate details and panoramic views of the Seine are breathtaking. At night, the illuminated cityscape creates a magical atmosphere, and if youâ€™re looking for a dramatic proposal spot, this is it!\n\nSuggested duration\n\nPlan to spend around 30 minutes to an hour (depending on how many pictures you plan to take).\n\n#4 Emilyâ€™s Apartment at Place de lâ€™Estrapade\n\nA regular feature since Season 1, Place de lâ€™Estrapade is where Emilyâ€™s Parisian adventure truly begins. Her charming apartment is the backdrop for many of her Parisian escapades, from navigating the French language and culture to hosting her American friends. And of course, to her many meetings with good old Gabriel. This quintessentially Parisian neighborhood embodies the showâ€™s romantic allure, with cobblestone streets and classic architecture. Check out all the filming spots here!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nThe area around Place de lâ€™Estrapade is lovely year-round, but late spring (May) to autumn (September to November) offers the most pleasant weather. Besides that is when you can sit and enjoy the cafÃ©s and bakeries at their best.\n\nSuggested duration\n\nSpend at least an hour wandering around the square and have a coffee or pastry at one of the local cafÃ©s. Maybe youâ€™ll bump into a Gabriel or Emily of your own!\n\n#5 Le Chateau de Sonnay\n\nCamille, Emily's former friend, has a countryside estate owned by her family, known as Chateau de Lalisse, which makes its debut in episode 8 of season 1. While that's a fictional name, the location is very real, known as Le Chateau de Sonnay â€“ the castle-turned-winery situated in the Loire valley, around 3 hours away from Paris. Besides Le Chateau de Sonnay, the Loire valley is famous for over 300 other lavish chateaux. These include the architectural beauty of Chambord with its unmissable 300 chimney structure and intertwined staircases; Amboise castle, which boasts of gardens that stretch from the sky to the early; and the romantic castle of Chenonceau, also known as the castle of ladies! Hop on a premium guided tour to Loire Valley castles with an English-speaking guide to explore the history and beauty while creating a lasting memory!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBetween April and June\n\nSuggested duration\n\nHalf day\n\n#6 Lâ€™atelier des Lumieres\n\nIf you want to be part of a remarkable, immersive digital experience, you must visit one of the most unusual museums Paris offers â€“ Atelier des Lumieres. In what can be termed an awkward third-wheel experience, Emily goes out with Gabriel (her eventual love interest and neighbour) and Camille (his girlfriend) to check out an exhibition at Lâ€™atelier des Lumieres in episode 5 of season 1. It's an abandoned factory which is now turned into an art space, adding a visual impact to the show's scenes. It almost seemed like the trio was walking inside the starry night painting made by the great Vincent Van Gogh. Visitors will also find numberless works of other artists like Cezanne and Kandinsky!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEarly morning\n\nSuggested duration\n\n1-2 Hours\n\n#7 The Pantheon\n\nThe Pantheonâ€™s unmissable neo-classical Roman pillars and towering structure offer a stark juxtaposition against the traditional Parisian construction. Although the site was intended to be a church, it became one of the most famous burial sites for the most prominent French personalities. The Pantheon is one of the grandest Emily in Paris locations that features in the initial episodes. Emily, conveniently living near the site, is shown taking a walk in front of the many buildings around the monument. She is seemingly breaking up with her boyfriend on a phone call. Well, what a way to call off your relationship while in the city of love! Although the exquisite interiors of this Parisian monument are not shown in any of the scenes, you can step inside the fascinating building with the Skip-The-line Ticket to Pantheon Paris.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEarly morning during mid week\n\nSuggested duration\n\n1.5 Hours\n\n#8 Gabrielâ€™s Restaurant â€“ Bistro Terra Nera\n\nBistro Terra Nera, known in the show as \"Les Deux CompÃ¨res,\" is the restaurant where Gabriel, Emilyâ€™s charming neighbor and romantic interest, works as a chef. This location is central to many of the showâ€™s key moments, including romantic dinners and intense conversations that complicate Emily's love life, and dates with Alfie.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nDinner time (7pm to 10pm) is ideal, as this is when the restaurant truly comes to life, much like in the show.\n\nSuggested duration\n\nPlan to spend about two hours here, enough time to enjoy a leisurely meal and soak in the atmosphere that has been the backdrop for so many pivotal scenes.\n\n#9 La Maison Rose\n\nAlso known as the â€˜Pink House,â€™ the stunning La Maison Rose was unsurprisingly one of the locations where Emily and her pal, Mindy Chen, went for a meal in episode 5 of season 1. Considering that the beauty of this place would translate well on social media posts, Emily just had to visit this charming restaurant in Montmartre. Itâ€™s located on the Rue de lâ€™Abreuvoir, a street that appears several times in the show. The pretty pastel pink and green cafe has an impeccable setting and vintage signages. It's no wonder that this restaurant is among the most photographed spots in the city! In fact, Pablo Picasso is known to have visited this pink cafÃ© often!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nAround 11 am\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2 Hours\n\n#10 Musee du Louvre\n\nOne of the largest and most-visited museums worldwide, the Louvre is situated on the banks of the River Seine and is often referenced in Emily in Paris. This museum is an ideal example of the famous French Baroque architecture. It's also renowned for its Mona Lisa painting, and other 3,80,000 jaw-dropping art pieces often put on exhibitions! The Louvre is one of the top-notch Emily in Paris locations that add to the elegance of the backdrops. In the show, Emily's marketing agency, Savoir, is located two blocks from the Louvre. Sometimes, when Emily is on an early morning jog, she is seen passing the Jardin des Tuileries, a lovely garden a minute away from the Louvre. Moreover, a client in the show once proposes to put a bed at the Musee du Louvre as a marketing tactic. If the mention of this museum already enchants you, you can get a ticket to the Louvre Guided tour with an English-speaking guide who will help you discover this treasure trove while captivating you with facts and anecdotes!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nWednesday and Friday Evenings\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2-3 Hours\n\n#11 La Boulangerie Moderne - Her Daily Breakfast Spot\n\nLa Boulangerie Moderne is where Emily picks up her daily croissant, adding a sweet start to her day. This quaint bakery symbolizes her growing love for Parisian culture, as she embraces the simple pleasures of life in Paris. While some say it may not be as fancy as the show makes it out to be, head here for the pain au chocolat and croissants and make an informed decision yourself. You wonâ€™t regret it.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEarly morning (7am to 9am) is the perfect time to visit, just like Emily. Why? Because that is when the freshness of the pastries hits bestâ€¦just as they come out of the oven.\n\nSuggested duration\n\nA quick 20 to 30 minutes is enough to grab your pastry and wander the streets.\n\n#12 CafÃ© de Flor\n\nWhile Thomas turned out to be a self-righteous person with a snobbish attitude that would have made you want to give him a middle finger, much like Emily did, he was still right about one thing. What, you wonder? Itâ€™s when the two are sitting in CafÃ© de Flor, and he tells Emily that she is sitting in 'one of the coolest cafes in Paris' in episode 6 of season 1. CafÃ© de Flor is indeed one of the most iconic cafes since its inception in the 1880s. This cafÃ© has seen many philosophical and artistic minds come through its doors, including the famous Pablo Picasso, Remy de Gourmont and Joris-Karl Huysmans. The cafÃ© still holds onto its 19th-century creativity and ambience as a way to pay homage to the historical figures that regularly spent their time here!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nAll day\n\nSuggested duration\n\n1 Hour\n\n#13 Pere Lachaise Cemetery\n\nHave you ever wondered whether a cemetery could become an eclectic backdrop for a lunch meal with a friend? Well, Emily makes that thought possible! In season 2, Emily visits one of the largest cemeteries (and parks) in Paris, the Pere Lachaise Cemetery, for a quiet birthday lunch with her co-worker Luc. They eat their meal at the grave of the famous French novelist Honore de Balzac. The cemetery is undoubtedly one odd attraction that is added to the long list of Emily in Paris locations. Nobody knows the exact number of people buried here (it could be between 3,00,000 to 10,00,000), but it makes for an astounding view to anyone who visits! It is the resting place of renowned figures like Oscar Wilde, Edith Piaf, Jim Morrison, Moliere, Marcel Proust, etc. You can take a guided tour at Pere Lachaise Cemetery, visit famous French personalities' tombstones, and listen to their tragic yet hopeful life stories.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nMarch\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2 Hours\n\n#14 Jardin du Luxembourg - Where She Jogs\n\nJust a short stroll from Savoir - her former workplace, youâ€™ll find the Jardin du Palais Royal, a charming public garden where Emily first crossed paths with Mindy on a park bench. Thank goodness for that as Mindy clearly is the life of that whole show! Itâ€™s easy to see why Emily chose to spend many of her lunch breaks here with the peaceful atmosphere, lovely fountains, manicured hedges, and lovely flowers.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEarly morning (7 AM to 9 AM) is ideal for a jog or a peaceful stroll, just as Emily does. The park is less crowded, allowing you to enjoy the serene environment fully.\n\nSuggested duration\n\nWhether jogging or simply exploring, you can easily spend one to two hours in the Jardin du Luxembourg. Take your time to explore the gardens, sit by the fountains, and absorb the tranquility that makes this place so special in the show.\n\n#15 Canal Saint-Martin\n\nBefore Thomasâ€™ pretentious attitude drove Emily away from him, their brief whirlwind romance took them to some of the most beautiful spots in France. One of them was Canal Saint-Martin, where Thomas and Emily go on a double date with Gabriel and Camille in episode 6 of season 1. Well, Gabriel did his protective neighbourly duty by warning Emily of Thomasâ€™ elitist and supercilious attitude after their walk on the Canal Saint Martin. Itâ€™s a 4.6 km stretch that connects Canal de lâ€™Ourcq to the Seine river, making it an excellent tourist spot. Visitors often take a ride on the scenic cruise along the canal side, which is an experience of its own!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nLate spring and early autumn\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2.5 Hours\n\n#16 Palais Garnier\n\nWho doesnâ€™t want to live a day dressed as Audrey Hepburn, going to one of the most famous opera houses in the world that served as a backdrop for the wildly popular, 'Phantom of The Opera?' Well, Emily does it all! In episode 6 of season 1, Emily goes to Palais Garnier to watch Swan Lake with Thomas. While he moans about the show's shortcomings, Emily ditches her date and spends the night flirting away with Pierre Cadault in the prime box seat of the legendary venue. Palais Garnier, also known as Opera Garnier, is an enchanting architectural masterpiece. It became famous after the release of the novel, The Phantom of the Opera. You can take a self-guided tour at the magnificent Palais Garnier and explore the temporary exhibitions!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEarly morning\n\nSuggested duration\n\n1.5 Hours\n\n#17 Le Meurice\n\nEmily in Paris doesn't only offer some magnificent museums, monuments and cafÃ© recommendations; it also does a good job highlighting one of the most opulent 5-star hotels in Paris. Le Meurice is a location that makes its sophisticated entry in season 3 of the show. It's situated in the first arrondissement, between the Musee du Louvre and Place de la Concorde, opposite the gorgeous Tuileries Garden. The hotel truly emanates a very fashionable vibe. This hotel was once home to Salvador Deli and also the setting for Picasso's wedding dinner! So, if you are attracted to delicate designs, breathtaking locations and top-notch services, Le Meurice is worth every penny!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBetween April and September\n\nSuggested duration\n\nHalf day\n\n#18 Eiffel Tower\n\nThe glimmering tower is one of the most featured Emily in Paris locations. First, in season 1, episode 2, when Emily steps out from the Maison Lavaux party, she is seen standing on the balcony with the perfect view of the Eiffel Tower. Next, in episode 5, when Mindy and Emily are inebriated post their expedition at Moulin Rouge, they go to the carousel of the Eiffel Tower, where they seemingly prod upon deleting Emily's Instagram. In Season 3, when Emily gets a chance to pitch to Mcdonald's, she doesn't let it slide. She sends the McDonald's representative and Sylvie on a dinner at Le Jules Verne restaurant in the Eiffel Tower to talk business in style! If you, too, want to enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime experience, you shouldn't miss your chance to dine at this iconic landmark.

The cinema makes its appearance in episode 4 of season 2 of the show, when Luc, Emily's co-worker, takes her to the legendary movie theatre to watch Francois Truffaut's Jules and Jim. Well, Emily ends up comparing the mÃ©nage Ã  trois storyline of the movie to her dramatic life. It was perhaps the show's attempt to draw distant parallels between Emily's new life in Paris to the theme of this famous French cult movie. Le Champo Cinema was often visited by some of the most critical filmmakers of French cinema, and you can still catch some French flicks here too!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEvening\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2 Hours\n\nEmily In Paris Tickets & Tours\n\nLove it?

A seasoned writer and editor, I fully believe that the pen is mightier than the sword. If I were given three wishes, one would definitely be to have the ability to travel - in time, dimension and places! Basically, I want a TARDIS! Of the 40 countries I've visited, Jordan, Japan, Italy and Croatia are my top favourite. London, having lived there, will always have my love, but Nepal and India have my soul! I love adventure (I'm from the mountains, what did you expect!), sports, music and food, so I travel to catch concerts, matches and races. I mostly write about off-beat travel, local experiences, best shopping spots, travel guides and coffee shops. Basically, give me coffee, a book, adventures and an enchanted forest, and you'll never hear me complain."
