        "text": "If you've ever dreamed of living your best Parisian life, Emily in Paris starring Lily Collins, has undoubtedly fueled your desire to visit the City of Love, Light, Fashion and Croissants. The show is a visual love letter to the city, featuring a treasure trove of picturesque locations that capture the essence of Parisian charm. From Emily's chic apartment in the Latin Quarter to the stunning bridges overlooking the Seine, these iconic spots have become must-visit destinations for fans of the series. With Season 4, Part 1, dropping on August 15 and Part 2 following on September 12, there’s much to look forward to in Paris and on Netflix.\n\nWhile Paris has been romanticized in its depiction in the books by Ernest Hemingway and Victor Hugo and in movies like Midnight in Paris, Before Sunset, and Moulin Rouge, there is no reason not to explore it through the eyes of Emily Cooper. So, if you are looking to hop on a trip to the fashion capital and want to live an instagrammable life, here’s how you can chalk down your ultimate itinerary and visit the best Emily in Paris locations! Grab your beret, the ever-optimistic attitude of Emily, and explore the Paris of your dreams!\n\nEmily in Paris Locations You Cannot Miss!\n\n#1 Jardin du Palais Royale\n\nOne of the first Emily in Paris locations that enchanted its viewers was the Jardin du Palais Royale. It's shown in the first episode of the show – a significant place where Emily meets Mindy during a lunch break. Mindy, a nanny, and Emily, a budding marketing executive, strike a close kinship with each other. This beautiful landscape, situated in the city's heart, is now part of the government buildings and is located a few steps from the Musee du Louvre. You will also find several antique stores and jewellery boutiques surrounding the gardens. Truly one of the best places for a quiet stroll!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBetween March and May\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2-3 Hours\n\n#2 Palace of Versailles\n\nThe Palace of Versailles, a former residence of King Louis XIV, is a renowned French landmark famous for its 17th-century French art. The garden surrounding the palace is one of the most spectacular in the world, with 372 statues, 600 fountains and 55 water features. The magnificent Hall of Mirrors, comprising 357 mirrors, has become one of the most talked about features of the palace. This Hall of Mirrors was featured in season 2, where Gregory Dupree's mix of the couture-ballet-catwalk show takes place. The palace is an hour's drive from the city, and you can experience the luxury of Versailles with a Versailles Palace All Access Passport that gives you entry to Royal grand apartments, gardens, Hall of Mirrors, temporary exhibits, Queen's Hamlet, and so much more!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBetween April and June\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2-3 hours\n\n#3 Pont Alexandre III\n\nAmong the more popular spots from the filming locations of Emily in Paris is Pont Alexandre III. It’s the setting for the Savoir team’s filming of the provocative perfume ad for Antoine Lambert, adding a touch of glamor and controversy to the storyline. More of them both, please! One of the city’s most stunning bridges, this is where you will also find the ornate lamp posts with the Seine in the background, that was the scene in popular films like Moulin Rouge, Chocolat, Bollywood film An Evening In Paris, Ronin and Midnight in Paris.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBoth day and night offer unique experiences on Pont Alexandre III. During the day, you can actually see the bridge’s intricate details and panoramic views of the Seine are breathtaking. At night, the illuminated cityscape creates a magical atmosphere, and if you’re looking for a dramatic proposal spot, this is it!\n\nSuggested duration\n\nPlan to spend around 30 minutes to an hour (depending on how many pictures you plan to take).\n\n#4 Emily’s Apartment at Place de l’Estrapade\n\nA regular feature since Season 1, Place de l’Estrapade is where Emily’s Parisian adventure truly begins. Her charming apartment is the backdrop for many of her Parisian escapades, from navigating the French language and culture to hosting her American friends. And of course, to her many meetings with good old Gabriel. This quintessentially Parisian neighborhood embodies the show’s romantic allure, with cobblestone streets and classic architecture. Check out all the filming spots here!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nThe area around Place de l’Estrapade is lovely year-round, but late spring (May) to autumn (September to November) offers the most pleasant weather. Besides that is when you can sit and enjoy the cafés and bakeries at their best.\n\nSuggested duration\n\nSpend at least an hour wandering around the square and have a coffee or pastry at one of the local cafés. Maybe you’ll bump into a Gabriel or Emily of your own!\n\n#5 Le Chateau de Sonnay\n\nCamille, Emily's former friend, has a countryside estate owned by her family, known as Chateau de Lalisse, which makes its debut in episode 8 of season 1. While that's a fictional name, the location is very real, known as Le Chateau de Sonnay – the castle-turned-winery situated in the Loire valley, around 3 hours away from Paris. Besides Le Chateau de Sonnay, the Loire valley is famous for over 300 other lavish chateaux. These include the architectural beauty of Chambord with its unmissable 300 chimney structure and intertwined staircases; Amboise castle, which boasts of gardens that stretch from the sky to the early; and the romantic castle of Chenonceau, also known as the castle of ladies! Hop on a premium guided tour to Loire Valley castles with an English-speaking guide to explore the history and beauty while creating a lasting memory!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nBetween April and June\n\nSuggested duration\n\nHalf day\n\n#6 L’atelier des Lumieres\n\nIf you want to be part of a remarkable, immersive digital experience, you must visit one of the most unusual museums Paris offers – Atelier des Lumieres. In what can be termed an awkward third-wheel experience, Emily goes out with Gabriel (her eventual love interest and neighbour) and Camille (his girlfriend) to check out an exhibition at L’atelier des Lumieres in episode 5 of season 1. It's an abandoned factory which is now turned into an art space, adding a visual impact to the show's scenes. It almost seemed like the trio was walking inside the starry night painting made by the great Vincent Van Gogh. Visitors will also find numberless works of other artists like Cezanne and Kandinsky!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEarly morning\n\nSuggested duration\n\n1-2 Hours\n\n#7 The Pantheon\n\nThe Pantheon’s unmissable neo-classical Roman pillars and towering structure offer a stark juxtaposition against the traditional Parisian construction. Although the site was intended to be a church, it became one of the most famous burial sites for the most prominent French personalities. The Pantheon is one of the grandest Emily in Paris locations that features in the initial episodes. Emily, conveniently living near the site, is shown taking a walk in front of the many buildings around the monument. She is seemingly breaking up with her boyfriend on a phone call. Well, what a way to call off your relationship while in the city of love! Although the exquisite interiors of this Parisian monument are not shown in any of the scenes, you can step inside the fascinating building with the Skip-The-line Ticket to Pantheon Paris.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEarly morning during mid week\n\nSuggested duration\n\n1.5 Hours\n\n#8 Gabriel’s Restaurant – Bistro Terra Nera\n\nBistro Terra Nera, known in the show as \"Les Deux Compères,\" is the restaurant where Gabriel, Emily’s charming neighbor and romantic interest, works as a chef. This location is central to many of the show’s key moments, including romantic dinners and intense conversations that complicate Emily's love life, and dates with Alfie.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nDinner time (7pm to 10pm) is ideal, as this is when the restaurant truly comes to life, much like in the show.\n\nSuggested duration\n\nPlan to spend about two hours here, enough time to enjoy a leisurely meal and soak in the atmosphere that has been the backdrop for so many pivotal scenes.\n\n#9 La Maison Rose\n\nAlso known as the ‘Pink House,’ the stunning La Maison Rose was unsurprisingly one of the locations where Emily and her pal, Mindy Chen, went for a meal in episode 5 of season 1. Considering that the beauty of this place would translate well on social media posts, Emily just had to visit this charming restaurant in Montmartre. It’s located on the Rue de l’Abreuvoir, a street that appears several times in the show. The pretty pastel pink and green cafe has an impeccable setting and vintage signages. It's no wonder that this restaurant is among the most photographed spots in the city! In fact, Pablo Picasso is known to have visited this pink café often!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nAround 11 am\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2 Hours\n\n#10 Musee du Louvre\n\nOne of the largest and most-visited museums worldwide, the Louvre is situated on the banks of the River Seine and is often referenced in Emily in Paris. This museum is an ideal example of the famous French Baroque architecture. It's also renowned for its Mona Lisa painting, and other 3,80,000 jaw-dropping art pieces often put on exhibitions! The Louvre is one of the top-notch Emily in Paris locations that add to the elegance of the backdrops. In the show, Emily's marketing agency, Savoir, is located two blocks from the Louvre. Sometimes, when Emily is on an early morning jog, she is seen passing the Jardin des Tuileries, a lovely garden a minute away from the Louvre. Moreover, a client in the show once proposes to put a bed at the Musee du Louvre as a marketing tactic. If the mention of this museum already enchants you, you can get a ticket to the Louvre Guided tour with an English-speaking guide who will help you discover this treasure trove while captivating you with facts and anecdotes!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nWednesday and Friday Evenings\n\nSuggested duration\n\n2-3 Hours\n\n#11 La Boulangerie Moderne - Her Daily Breakfast Spot\n\nLa Boulangerie Moderne is where Emily picks up her daily croissant, adding a sweet start to her day. This quaint bakery symbolizes her growing love for Parisian culture, as she embraces the simple pleasures of life in Paris. While some say it may not be as fancy as the show makes it out to be, head here for the pain au chocolat and croissants and make an informed decision yourself. You won’t regret it.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nEarly morning (7am to 9am) is the perfect time to visit, just like Emily. Why? Because that is when the freshness of the pastries hits best…just as they come out of the oven.\n\nSuggested duration\n\nA quick 20 to 30 minutes is enough to grab your pastry and wander the streets.\n\n#12 Café de Flor\n\nWhile Thomas turned out to be a self-righteous person with a snobbish attitude that would have made you want to give him a middle finger, much like Emily did, he was still right about one thing. What, you wonder? It’s when the two are sitting in Café de Flor, and he tells Emily that she is sitting in 'one of the coolest cafes in Paris' in episode 6 of season 1. Café de Flor is indeed one of the most iconic cafes since its inception in the 1880s. This café has seen many philosophical and artistic minds come through its doors, including the famous Pablo Picasso, Remy de Gourmont and Joris-Karl Huysmans. The café still holds onto its 19th-century creativity and ambience as a way to pay homage to the historical figures that regularly spent their time here!\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nAll day\n\nSuggested duration\n\n1 Hour\n\n#13 Pere Lachaise Cemetery\n\nHave you ever wondered whether a cemetery could become an eclectic backdrop for a lunch meal with a friend? Well, Emily makes that thought possible! In season 2, Emily visits one of the largest cemeteries (and parks) in Paris, the Pere Lachaise Cemetery, for a quiet birthday lunch with her co-worker Luc.

One of them was Canal Saint-Martin, where Thomas and Emily go on a double date with Gabriel and Camille in episode 6 of season 1. Well, Gabriel did his protective neighbourly duty by warning Emily of Thomas’ elitist and supercilious attitude after their walk on the Canal Saint Martin. It’s a 4.6 km stretch that connects Canal de l’Ourcq to the Seine river, making it an excellent tourist spot.

Well, Emily ends up comparing the ménage à trois storyline of the movie to her dramatic life. It was perhaps the show's attempt to draw distant parallels between Emily's new life in Paris to the theme of this famous French cult movie.

A seasoned writer and editor, I fully believe that the pen is mightier than the sword. If I were given three wishes, one would definitely be to have the ability to travel - in time, dimension and places! Basically, I want a TARDIS! Of the 40 countries I've visited, Jordan, Japan, Italy and Croatia are my top favourite. London, having lived there, will always have my love, but Nepal and India have my soul! I love adventure (I'm from the mountains, what did you expect!), sports, music and food, so I travel to catch concerts, matches and races. I mostly write about off-beat travel, local experiences, best shopping spots, travel guides and coffee shops. Basically, give me coffee, a book, adventures and an enchanted forest, and you'll never hear me complain."
