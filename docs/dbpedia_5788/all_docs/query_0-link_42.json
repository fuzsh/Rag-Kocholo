        "text": "1) Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Michel Caine. (I liked Cillian Murphy in Batman Begins, but he was miscast here. Too-weird looking for the role.) I really wanted to attend one of Caine’s lectures in Dream Architecture at the Sorbonne.\n\n2) Leonardo DiCaprio and Page folding Paris up like a map (which I’d already seen in the teaser trailer) followed by Page’s use of mirrors. This was promising, but after the Paris scenes we never saw these tricks again. What’s the point of showing a gun in the first act if you don’t use it in the third?\n\n3) Gordon-Levitt trying to corral everyone into the lift while they were sleeping and weightless. It was funny and frustrating and strange and a little bit silly. Just like something in a dream, in fact.\n\n4) The MC Escher staircases were great.\n\n5) Inception is a summer blockbuster which is neither a sequel nor a remake.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN’T LIKE ABOUT INCEPTION:\n\n1) It was like Ocean’s 11: stuffed with MacGuffins and needlessly overelaborate caper movie hokum. Perhaps Christopher Nolan thought that if he made it complicated enough, we’d be too befuddled or bedazzled to question his lack of basic craftsmanship when it came to plot and characters.\n\n2) Leonardo DiCaprio appears to playing the exact same character he played in Shutter Island. A bit bonkers? Tick. Guilty about wife’s death? Tick. Refusal to face reality? Tick. DiCaprio has no hidden depths – he wears his art on his sleeve, and we’ve seen it all before. Also, I don’t find him very attractive, and he’s too earnest to be charming.\n\n2) Nolan can’t direct action for toffee. The shoot-outs were straight out of a bog-standard action-for-beginners manual, with anonymous enemy shooters falling like Stormtroopers; if these guys were supposed to be protecting Cillian Murphy’s subconscious, they weren’t doing a very good job of it. And did they have to be shooters? Couldn’t Nolan have rung the changes on one or more of the levels with more imaginative traps or snares or guardians?\n\nSome of Inception‘s basic two-shots were awfully clunky too – and this is not something I generally look out for, so they must have been ropey if I noticed them. I’m starting to think Nolan is not so much a film director as a film architect – creator of worlds, but not so great at knowing where to put the camera.\n\n3) I had no sense that any of the characters (other than DiCaprio) had histories or lives beyond the story; they were interchangeable blanks, entirely reliant on the actors playing them to sock over a bit of their own personality. If the characters had been better developed, maybe their dreams might have been more interesting? Just saying.\n\n4) Anonymous settings (generic streets, hotel, Ice Station Zebra snow station), routine shoot-em-ups – these were some of the dullest dreams in the history of dreaming in the cinema. My dreams knock these pieces of crap out of the ballpark, and I expect yours do too.\n\nI have accordingly compiled a list of Eight Films Containing Dream Sequences More Interesting Than the Ones in Inception; these dreams are sinister, scary, bizarre, astonishing or alarming in ways the ones in Inception were not.\n\nThe ending of Inception echoes the endings of eXistenZ or Avalon but I haven’t included those films because they’re not technically about dreaming – though there is nothing in Inception remotely as disturbing, funny and dreamlike as the gun constructed out of Chinese food in eXistenZ. Nor have I included alternate realities, hallucinations brought about by blows to the head or drug-induced visions.\n\nIf this list had been longer, it might also have included: Stranger on the Third Floor, The Woman in the Window, Vertigo, Still of the Night, Dream Demon, Aliens, Carrie, Dressed to Kill, An American Werewolf in London, The Fly, Total Recall, Audition, Living in Oblivion, Blade Runner, Eraserhead, Heathers, Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure as well as dream episodes of The Sopranos and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In any case, this selection is subjective, fairly arbitrary and not intended to be definitive.\n\nSPELLBOUND (1945)\n\n“They tell you what you are trying to hide, but they tell it to you all mixed up, like pieces of a puzzle that don’t fit.”\n\nThe Dream: designed by Salvador Dali, filled with stylised, exaggerated symbolism relating to Gregory Peck’s repressed memories, which contain the keys to a murder and to Peck’s own amnesia. Director Alfred Hitchcock described it as “just another manhunt story wrapped in pseudo-psychology.”\n\nDEAD OF NIGHT (1945)\n\n“I’ve seen you in my dreams. Sounds like a sentimental song, doesn’t it? I’ve dreamt about you over and over again, Doctor.”\n\nThe Dream: the entire film is revealed to be one long dream, which at the end looks set to repeat itself (though some argue that the last few minutes actually do take place in the real world). Architect Mervyn Johns arrives at a country cotttage he’s never been to before but experiences ominous sensations of déjà-vu as the other guests relate their experiences of the uncanny. I like the way the climax of the dream incorporates all the characters and stories from earlier in the film and gives them an extra nightmarish twist.\n\nTHE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962)\n\n“Night after night, the Major was plagued by the same recurring nightmare.”\n\nBefore I saw it for the first time, nobody told me The Manchurian Candidate was funny. But it is, and extremely weird to boot. Frank Sinatra and the rest of his platoon are suffering from recurring nightmares apparently set in a New Jersey hotel playing host to a “Fun with Hydrangeas” convention populated by Women’s Institute types, though in reality the dreams are the result of their having been brainwashed in Korea. The detail I particularly love is the way the colour of the women’s skin changes according to the ethnicity of the man who’s dreaming.\n\nROSEMARY’S BABY (1968)\n\n“This is no dream! This is really happening!”\n\nThe Dream: Rosemary dreams she’s on a yacht with JFK, then she’s naked, then she’s being raped by the Devil in a roomful of naked old folk. Depicting this as a dream was a masterstroke (can’t remember if it was Ira Levin’s idea or Roman Polanski’s); filmed straight, the ritual would have been absurd (like the orgy scene from Eyes Wide Shut) but mixing it up with Rosemary’s subconscious makes it subjective, ambiguous and very creepy. It also, incidentally, slips in the information that Rosemary has been “chosen” because she’s a nice Catholic girl. This is arguably a drug-induced dream (or at least a chocolate mousse-induced one) but I’m including it anyway because I love the way it blends fantasy, reality and celebs.\n\nTHE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE (1972)\n\n“Le sergeant a un rêve très sympathique à vous raconter.”\n\nThe Dream: The entire film can be interpreted as a series of interlocking dreams in which a group of middle-class people repeatedly try to sit down and eat dinner, but are prevented from doing so for increasingly outlandish reasons. In one scene, a young army sergeant describes a dream (the very fact that he’s describing it in the first place is dreamlike and bizarre) in which he’s walking down an empty street; first he bumps into a friend who has been dead for six years, then his mother, who is also long dead). Meanwhile, on the soundtrack there’s the ominous sound of a tolling bell and the constant murmur of an invisible crowd. Nothing much happens, but it’s very creepy.\n\nDREAMSCAPE (1984)\n\n“When you dream that you die, you die in life at the very same instant. Now we can go into an enemy’s dream, kill him, make it look as if he died in his sleep.”\n\nThe Dream: Dreamscape is a direct antecedent of Inception. Dennis Quaid (one of the good guys) and David Patrick Kelly (team evil) have the ability to enter people’s dreams. The President has been having nightmares about a nuclear holocaust and wants to sign a peace treaty; Christopher Plummer tries to stop him by sending Kelly into his dream. In the climax, Kelly chases Quaid and the President through a trainful of zombies and turns into a snake monster. Many people think the special effects are clunky, but I think they’re great.\n\nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984)\n\n“O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.”\n\nThe Dream: Freddy Krueger is a dead bogeyman who murders teenagers in their dreams. Wes Craven’s first film in what would be a long-running but increasingly jokey franchise is a genuinely eerie and imaginative slasher movie which exploits the confusion between dreams and reality.\n\nMULHOLLAND DRIVE (2001)\n\n“I’m just so excited to be here. I mean I just came here from Deep River, Ontario, and now I’m in this dream place.”\n\nThe Dream: even before three-quarters of the plot is revealed to be a dream, watching Mulholland Drive feels like dreaming with your eyes open. Unlike Inception, it feels as though every single element in the film has been placed there for a purpose: the scene behind the diner, the sinister cowboy, dreams within dreams, apparent non-sequiturs, the blue box, “Silenzio”, amputated plot threads left over from the film’s first incarnation as a TV series pilot, things that don’t seem quite right. To me, Mulholland Drive feels like the most uncanny depiction of the dream state ever filmed. I like to think that if ever David Lynch were to film my nightmares, they would end up something like this.\n\nMore Annotated Film Lists\n\nMy Top Ten Greatest Films of All Time\n\nHoly Motors & My Top Ten Musical Entr’actes in Non-Musical Films\n\nTen Actresses on Whom I Have Girlcrushes\n\nSix Reasons Why The Thing Prequel is Better than John Carpenter’s 1982 Film"
