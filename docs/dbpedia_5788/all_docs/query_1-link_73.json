        "text": "Paris Photo Spots\n\nParis is known as the City of Lights and the City of Love, üíïso it will surprise no one that it makes for a perfect photo location.

If you‚Äôre curious about what your Paris vacation might look like during the Olympics, we have great news. Our local photographers have provided insider tips on what to expect and how to successfully capture your time in this magical city.

Trocadero & The Eiffel Tower\n\nThe Trocadero is a must-visit for the best Eiffel Tower views and a fun day out. Alongside the Eiffel Tower, the Trocadero is a square full of gardens, üå∏ sculptures, and museums with abundant Instagrammable photo opportunities.\n\nExplore the museums and snap photos of the Eiffel Tower during the day, üåû and then stay for the Eiffel Tower light show at night. üåô You can watch the Eiffel Tower‚Äôs lights go from warm gold to bright purple in a breathtaking display you won‚Äôt want to miss. You won‚Äôt regret it if you have the energy to hike up the second floor! Soak in the beautiful, panoramic views of the city and remember to capture a few pics.\n\nNote: Although the Trocadero photoshoot location is under construction until September due to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, we recommend visiting the hidden gem La Marais, where history meets contemporary chic around every corner! See all of our recommended routes during the Olympics here.\n\n2. Bir-Hakeim Bridge\n\nBathing in the waters of the Seine, Paris is home to numerous bridges, each with its unique charm and history. Constructed in the early 1900s during a boom in the steel industry ‚Äî not long after the construction of the Eiffel Tower ‚Äî Pont de Bir-Hakeim is remarkable. It crosses the river, connecting the 15th and 16th arrondissements. A metro line uses its upper level, while the lower level is for motor vehicles on both sides, and a covered bicycle and walking path is in the centre. üö≤\n\nWith its extraordinary steel architecture, the bridge has been featured in many well-known movies, such as Last Tango in Paris and Inception. This is one of the best places to take photos in Paris. Besides the unique design, it provides superb views of the Seine River and the Eiffel Tower from a slanted angle, making it a great alternative to Trocad√©ro and Champs de Mars. From there, it is almost irresistible not to take a stroll along the riverbanks as you make your way toward the Iron Lady. üòç\n\n3. Champ de Mars\n\nA trip to Paris isn‚Äôt complete without a visit to this famous landmark. üôåüèº There are many spots throughout the city to capture a photo with the Eiffel Tower peeking behind, but one of the best places to take photos in Pairs is on the Champ de Mars, which is right beneath its shadow.\n\nCome in the early morning to this public space for ideal light and fewer crowds, or find a free space in the evening to experience the fantastic light show of the tower. Champ de Mars delivers lovely photography locations from dawn to dusk, so make sure to squeeze in a photoshoot here! üì∏\n\nNote: Although the Champ de Mars photoshoot location is under construction until September due to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, we recommend trying the Capture Your Paris Era photo tour! Follow the footsteps of Taylor in Paris and visit stops inspired by iconic moments in Taylor Swift‚Äôs music video ‚ÄúBegin Again.‚Äù\n\n4. Pont Alexandre III\n\nAnother famous Parisian bridge that offers magnificent views of the Eiffel Tower is Pont Alexandre III. Inaugurated for the 1900 Exposition Universelle, this ornate and extravagant bridge sits at the heart of Paris, near countless monuments and is a popular spot for a stroll at any time of day or night. üö∂\n\nPont Alexandre III connects the Invalides on the Left Bank to the Grand Palais and Petit Palais on the Right Bank, providing breathtaking views of both sides. The bridge features huge 17-metre-high pylons crowned with gilt bronze sculptures of winged horses representing the fields of Arts, Sciences, Commerce, and Industry. It is considered the most photogenic bridges and stunning places to take photos in Paris. You will want to cross it slowly, admiring all the beautiful details and soaking in the atmosphere of this majestic bridge that is a monument in all its rights. üòâ\n\nNote: Although the Pont Alexandre III photoshoot location is under construction until September due to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, we recommend visiting the beautiful Latin Quarter, with ivy-covered courtyards and cobblestone streets. This spot makes for a picturesque adventure in the heart of Paris during the Olympics dates!\n\n5. The Louvre & Tuileries Gardens\n\nThe Louvre, the world‚Äôs most famous museum, is one of the most iconic places to take photos in Paris. Originally built as a fortress and later converted into a royal residence, this massive palatial complex comprises several buildings organised around courtyards and featuring various architectural styles, including Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque. In the late 1980s, a controversial modern glass and steel pyramid was added to the large courtyard at the centre, providing a stark contrast with the more classical architecture of the facade. This pyramid is the most popular spot for photos outside the museum, with the large reflecting pool around it creating beautiful reflections of everything. It‚Äôs also a great spot for night shots when the modern structure and the building behind it are beautifully lit up. üí°\n\nSitting in a privileged position between the Louvre and the Place de la Concorde, the Jardin des Tuileries continues as a central axis for the Louvre. It is an attraction with fountains, sculptures, and beautiful landscaping. Despite being very popular, it is still a tranquil space for visitors to relax and enjoy the outdoors. You can take great photos of the grand central alley, the stunning arch made of marble featuring four Corinthian columns, and the Ferris wheel set up in the garden during certain times of the year. üé° The combination of the museum and the gardens makes for a quintessential Parisian experience!\n\nNote: The Tuileries will be unavailable until September due to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. We invite you during that time to visit the neighbouring Palais Royale and its gardens or stroll along the Seine River for incredible photos and views.\n\n6. Palais Royale & Gardens\n\nLocated in the heart of Paris, just a stone‚Äôs throw away from The Louvre, l‚ÄôOp√©ra, and Rue de Rivoli, Palais-Royal is often missed by casual passersby. Constructed in the 17th century, this U-shaped palace features a courtyard surrounded by stone columns that house artwork by Daniel Buren, a striking installation of black-and-white striped columns arranged in a grid pattern. Once more, a contemporary touch contrasts with the elegant and classical surroundings and makes for great places to take photos in Paris. üëå\n\nAnother highlight of the palace is its gardens, which feature about 500 trees, some trimmed to create an arch effect, symmetrical rose beds, two long and manicured lawns, and a fountain right at the centre. The Gardens of Palais-Royal is a beautiful and tranquil oasis, perfect for taking a city break and enjoying the beauty of nature. üå≥\n\n7. Jardin du Luxembourg\n\nThanks to a bequest from Napol√©on, the extensive manicured Jardin du Luxembourg with the stately 17th-century Palace, open to the public, offers a stunning photo backdrop. Whether you‚Äôre visiting Paris with your family, friend or partner, travelling out to these gardens will make for an unforgettable and incredible day trip. üëç\n\nThe Luxembourg Gardens will transport you back to when French royalty roamed these gorgeous and vibrant gardens. üåª Stand next to the sculptures with the colourful foliage and the Luxembourg Palace behind you for some of the best places to take photos in Paris.\n\n8. Emily in Paris Route\n\nChasing her dreams in the City of Lights, Emily Cooper once said, ‚ÄúParis is the most beautiful city in the world. Everywhere you look, something catches your eye.‚Äù So, here‚Äôs an idea: why not experience and explore the city through her eyes? You can trace Emily‚Äôs steps to some of the series‚Äô most photogenic places to take photos in Paris, from the typically Parisian Gabriel‚Äôs restaurant, which in real life is called Bistro Terra Nera, to Place de l‚ÄôEstrapade, the charming and picturesque square with a lovely fountain opposite her apartment in the series and even to main monuments like the Pantheon, where she made the tough decision of breaking up with her American boyfriend over the phone. Emily in Paris may even be a work of fiction, but it captures all the beauty, fashion, and romance of real-life Paris. üíÖüíó\n\nDiscover all the places to take photos in paris along the Emily in Paris Route!\n\n9. √éle St-Louis & Notre Dame\n\n√éle Saint-Louis is one of two small islands on the Seine River connected to the rest of the city by four bridges. It‚Äôs a charming treasure island with cobblestone pathways, quaint cafes, and restaurants. üçΩÔ∏èThe island is steeped in history and boasts several acclaimed examples of architecture. Among its landmarks are the royal Gothic-style Sainte-Chapelle, renowned for its stained-glass windows, and the Conciergerie, where Marie Antoinette was held before her execution.\n\nOf course, the most famous attraction on the island is the Notre Dame Cathedral, a world-renowned example of Gothic architecture and the setting of the tale of Esmeralda and Quasimodo. While the landmark is currently under renovation following the tragic fire of 2019, the exterior can still be photographed from various angles, such as across the Seine River, nearby bridges, or the frontal square, Place Jean-Paul II. A visit to Paris is only complete with a stop on this island and a photoshoot in front of this striking Gothic masterpiece. ‚õ™\n\n10. Montmartre & Sacr√©-Coeur\n\nOnce home to renowned artists like Salvador Dal√≠, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh, Montmartre is easy to find. The neighbourhood is in northern Paris, sitting atop a hill dominated by the eye-catching, white-domed Basilica of the Sacr√©-Coeur. Although a popular tourist destination, Montmartre still exudes its picturesque, enchanting, and artistic charm. üë©‚Äçüé® It has a distinct feel from the rest of Paris, with colourful facades lining cobblestone streets. Visitors can enjoy a coffee or snack from a local cafe or boulangerie while admiring the beautiful architecture. ü•ê The vibe is equally lovely day or night.\n\nThe beautiful Sacr√©-Coeur, also known as The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris, is a stunning Roman Catholic church on the summit of Montmartre. The elaborate stone stairs leading up to the church provide irresistibly romantic places to take photos in Paris! Thinking about a Paris proposal? Discover how to find the best Paris proposal photographer for your big day!\n\nPro tip: if you want to avoid climbing the stairs, a funicular is available at the base. But the panoramic views of the city from the top make the climb worth it. You‚Äôll feel you‚Äôre inside a painting. üñºÔ∏è Well, isn‚Äôt that the feeling in Paris, anyway?"
