        "text": "How can you find a great Eiffel Tower photographer? And what do you need to know when planning your Eiffel Tower photo shoot in Paris? At the Parisian photographers we are a team of local Eiffel Tower photographers. We have a lot of experience with photoshoots at the Eiffel Tower and are happy to share all our insights with you. Our tips will surely help you planning your Eiffel Tower photo session and choose a great Eiffel Tower photographer in Paris. So let’s get started:\n\nCan you have a professional photoshoot at the Eiffel Tower?\n\nYES! You can have a professional photoshoot with your Eiffel Tower photographer in the surrounding of this iconic location and with a great view on it.\n\nPublic Eiffel Tower locations – YES\n\nThere are many public photoshoot locations with a great view on the Eiffel Tower (check them below). You can use these public locations anytime you want. Public locations are – as the name says – public: So you don’t have to pay a fee to use these public locations for your Eiffel Tower photoshoot.\n\nYou also don’t have to get a permit. There is no paperwork or booking process if you want to shoot at a public Eiffel Tower location. Just show up with your Eiffel Tower photographer and enjoy the shoot!\n\nHowever shooting at a public location also means that anyone else can use this location as well anytime they want. As your Eiffel Tower photographer we therefore know that good timing is crucial to avoid having too many other people around (read more below)\n\nPrivate Eiffel Tower venues – YES\n\nIf you want to be completely private you can also shoot at a private venue with a view on the Eiffel Tower, such as a wedding hotel. But in this case you have to book the venue for your Eiffel Tower photoshoot. That means you have to reserve it in advance and have to pay for using this location.\n\nAs Eiffel Tower photographer we don’t think booking a private Eiffel Tower venue is not necessary for most photo shoots. But you may consider this option if you are celebrating an intimate event and would appreciate privacy such as a Paris wedding ceremony or a Paris surprise proposal\n\nON the Eiffel Tower – NO\n\nNo, you cannot have a professional Paris photo session on top of the Eiffel Tower. This is simply not permitted. But don’t be sad. As your local Eiffel Tower photographer we can assure you that it is actually not very pretty to shoot on top of the Eiffel Tower. There is not much space up there, however lots of other visitor.\n\nBut more importantly: As you would be on top of the Eiffel Tower you actually would not see the Eiffel Tower in your Paris photos. So better simply plan a visit of the Eiffel Tower. And let’s have your photo session at one of the many beautiful Eiffel Tower locations where we will be able to capture the Eiffel Tower in it’s entirety as a backdrop of your photos. Keep reading, we’ll show you some examples right away.\n\nWhat are the best Eiffel Tower photoshoot locations?\n\nAs your local Eiffel Tower photographer we know all the beautiful Eiffel Tower locations that work great for your Paris photo session. We are about to show you a quick overview here. Feel free to check these Eiffel Tower photo shoot locations more in detail here: Eiffel Tower photo session & Eiffel Tower photoshoot.\n\nTrocadero\n\nTrocadero is a vast area across the Seine river from the Eiffel Tower: Trocadero place is the main square which is located on a hill and provides stunning views for your Eiffel Tower photo session. A large staircase leads down from Trocadero place to the Eiffel Tower gardens and Eiffel Tower fountain.\n\nThis Eiffel Tower park is another beautiful backdrop for your Eiffel Tower photoshoot. As Eiffel Tower photographer we love this area as you can combine stunning views with a few more romantic and casual shots in the gardens.\n\nBir-Hakeim Bridge\n\nBir-Hakeim bridge crosses the Seine river near the Eiffel Tower. This beautiful double layer bridge has a balcony facing the Eiffel Tower. There you can enjoy a stunning view on the iconic landmark. As your Eiffel Tower photographers we love Bir-Hakeim bridge for all types of Paris photo sessions. You may have seen Bir-Hakeim bridge in the famous movie “Inception”.\n\nSeine Riverside\n\nThe Seine riverbanks near the Eiffel Tower are another pretty area for your photoshoot in Paris. The best spots are on the opposite side of the Eiffel Tower between Debilly Footbridge (Passerelle Debilly) and Bir-Hakeim bridge. This part of the Seine riverside is called: Port de Debilly.\n\nAs your Eiffel Tower photographer we especially love this area if you wish to be a bit more quiet and intimate for your photo session at the Eiffel Tower. You got great views on the Eiffel Tower from the Seine riverbanks and at the same time you can enjoy a casual and candid vibe.\n\nChamps de Mars\n\nChamps de Mars is a huge park at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. It mainly consists in an enormous lawn in the center (that’s why it is called field in French) and park areas with trees and greenery to both sides. Champs de Mars is another nice area to plan your Eiffel Tower photo shoot: It is usually less crowded than Trocadero area, but you won’t have such great elevated views as on Trocadero.\n\nStreet Views\n\nThere are also many authentic Parisian streets in the area with a view on the Eiffel Tower, such as Rue de l’Université. As Eiffel Tower photographers we love to shoot at these Eiffel Tower streets because they offer such an authentic Parisian backdrop: Cobble stone streets, Parisian architecture, pretty street Cafés, beautiful lampposts – you name it. This authentic Parisian backdrop plus the Eiffel Tower looks simply stunning on your Eiffel Tower photos.\n\nWhat is the best time for your Eiffel Tower photoshoot?\n\nNo doubt, the best time to shoot at the Eiffel Tower is morning time. Because the area around the Eiffel Tower is very popular. It gets busy and crowded later in the day. So if you don’t want to have tourist groups or a bunch of passersby in the background of your Eiffel Tower photos then shooting early in the morning is key.\n\nAlso good light conditions are crucial for your Eiffel Tower photo session to get the best possible result for your Paris pictures. Morning and evening light is best, because it is very soft and flattering. The light around noon is the worst, because can be harsh and can create unflattering shadows and contrasts in your face. As evening time is too busy at the Eiffel Tower, morning time is undoubtedly the best time for your Eiffel Tower photo session regarding light conditions and crowds.\n\nHow early do you need to meet your Eiffel Tower photographer?\n\nIdeally you meet your Eiffel Tower photographer at sunrise to have the best light conditions and to be as quiet and intimate for your photo shoot at the Eiffel Tower. If sunrise is too early for you or the sunrise slots are already taken: No worries, it is still possible to shoot at the Eiffel Tower in the early to mid morning. Just make sure to talk to your Eiffel Tower about the best Eiffel Tower location for your photoshoot. And try to schedule it as early as possible.\n\nSunrise time varies widely in Paris: Sun rises as early as 5.45 am in summer and as late as 8.45 am in winter. So it will depend on the season and month you will be in Paris, how early we can schedule your Eiffel Tower photo session. In any case if you plan a photo session in Paris with several locations make sure to always shoot first at the Eiffel Tower. Any other location can wait.\n\nCan you do a night Eiffel Tower photoshoot?\n\nYes, you can! It is possible to have an evening or night photo session when the Eiffel Tower is lit up and sparkling. When you check online you can sometimes find the information that it is prohibited and illegal to shoot the sparkling Eiffel Tower by night. This is not true! As your professional Eiffel Tower photographer we assure you that it is in fact permitted and legal. So we are allowed to plan your Eiffel Tower photo session by night.\n\nHowever as your Eiffel Tower photographer we recommend you to choose your Paris nighttime photo shoot location well. There are only a few spots that are not extremely crowded when the Eiffel Tower is sparkling and where the light conditions are good for a night photo session in Paris. As your local photographers in Paris we prefer shooting at Bir-Hakeim bridge for an evening or night photoshoot at the Eiffel Tower.\n\nHow do you choose your Eiffel Tower photographer?\n\nChoosing a great Eiffel Tower photographer is very similar to choosing a great Paris photographer. Here are the most important things you should consider when hiring a local Paris photographer for your Eiffel Tower photoshoot:\n\nChoose a great Paris photographer\n\nCheck the portfolio of the Paris photographers that you may want to hire carefully. Do you like the photography style? Do all photos on their website and social media have the same quality and style? Do you love their pictures of Eiffel Tower photo sessions? When choosing a Paris photographer make sure that quality and style of their photos are good.\n\nChoose a local Eiffel Tower photographer\n\nBut when choosing an Eiffel Tower photographer it is not only important that you like their pictures. But also that this Paris photographer can help you planning your Eiffel Tower photo session. Therefore make sure to book a Paris based photographer with local knowledge and experience.\n\nBecause you need to be able to rely on the advice of your Eiffel Tower photographer regarding best Eiffel Tower locations, best timeline etc. to have a smooth photoshoot in Paris. Especially if you are here for the first time and don’t speak the local language.\n\nChoose an English speaking Paris photographer\n\nOf course you need to book an English speaking Paris photographer because you need to be able to communication with each other before and during your Eiffel Tower photo session. Moreover make sure that your English speaking photographer also speaks French.\n\nSkills in the local language can go a long way. Your Parisian photographer can kindly ask people to move from the background of your photos, can help you if need any translation and are also there to answer questions in case a local security guard is approaching you.\n\nChoose a professional Eiffel Tower photographer\n\nBeing a professional Eiffel Tower photographer means basically two things: First a professional photographer uses professional photography equipment, works as a full time photographer in Paris (as opposed to a hobby photographer) and has experience working with couples from abroad as an Eiffel Tower photographer.\n\nSecondly a professional photographer in Paris has the experience and knowledge to help you planning your photo shoot at the Eiffel Tower. This is very important as it may be your first time in Paris and you may just not be very familiar with the city and how things work here.\n\nSo a professional Eiffel Tower photographer will help you choosing the right Eiffel Tower location, will suggest you the best time to shoot, support you preparing your photoshoot and answer all your question. Your English speaking photographer will also put you at ease, guide you during your photo session and will make it a relaxed and fun experience for you.\n\nHow do you get to your Eiffel Tower photo session?\n\nThere are several ways of transportation that you can use in order to get to your Eiffel Tower photo session.\n\nUber app: The easiest, quickest and most affordable way to get to your photo session at the Eiffel Tower is to use Uber. Uber is the most commonly used transportation app in Paris. So download the app and order your ride.\n\nTaxi & cabs: You can also use a taxi or cab to get to the meeting point. Make sure to ask your hotel to order a taxi or cab in advance. Because if you step on the street in the morning of your photo shoot and expect to simply stop a taxi or cab that is passing, then you may wait for a very long time – especially in the early morning.\n\nPrivate Transportation: You can also hire a private car or van with chauffeur who is picking you up at your hotel and bringing you back after the photo shoot. We recommend hiring your own private transportation if you plan a longer photo session with several different location in Paris. This way you don’t loose time during your Paris photo session to wait for an Uber or cab to get from location to location.\n\nVintage Car: You can also hire your private vintage classic car with chauffeur. Same as with the private car or van, this makes sense for a longer photo session. But also if you simply want to include a Parisian vintage car or pretty classic car into your Eiffel Tower photo session.\n\nPlan your transportation well in advance\n\nAs you most likely will shoot early in the morning we suggest that you plan your transportation well in advance. If you only start thinking about it in the morning of your photo shoot at the Eiffel Tower it may already be too late. So check the following things in advance:\n\n1.Check how long it takes to get to the Eiffel Tower: Use e.g. google maps or waze to check the distance and estimated time between your accommodation and the exact meeting point that your Eiffel Tower photographer gave you. Now you know how long it will take you approximately to get to your photo shoot in time.\n\n2. Morning traffic rush hour: Most likely your Eiffel Tower photo session will take place in the early morning. Traffic at that time of the day can be dense in Paris when you hit rush hour. So don’t plan too tight. Allow a bit of extra time. So that if you get stuck in traffic you will still be able to meet your Eiffel Tower photographer in time.\n\n3. Be precise with the meeting point: Your Eiffel Tower photographer will give you a precise meeting point with address. So don’t just tell your cab driver to bring you to the Eiffel Tower. The area around the Eiffel Tower is large and you may end up at a place near the Eiffel Tower but far away from our meeting point. So make sure to use the exact meeting point address that your Eiffel Tower photographer gave you.\n\nMore tips from your Eiffel Tower photographer?\n\nAs your Eiffel Tower photographer we want you to feel completely ready and well prepared, so that you can be relaxed and feel at ease during our Eiffel Tower photo session. So as your English speaking photographers we have a few more tips for you to prepare your photo shoot in Paris:\n\nDress properly for your Eiffel Tower shoot\n\nAs your Eiffel Tower photographers we encourage you to choose your favorite outfit for your photo session. You should feel pretty and comfortable for your photo session. But keep in mind that we will shoot outdoors. So check the weather forecast and make sure to also dress according to the weather. If there are chances of rain, bring a cute umbrella. If temperatures are low dress a bit warmer, or at least bring an extra layer e.g. a coat or scarf in case you feel cold.\n\nMoreover most likely we will meet early in the morning. Temperatures in the early morning are usually lower than during daytime. So make sure that you wear enough. If you freeze you won’t feel relax or move with ease – and we want you to enjoy our Eiffel Tower photo session.\n\nAlso if you are planning to wear high heels for your Eiffel Tower photo session, make sure to bring an extra pair of flats. The area around the Eiffel Tower is vast and we may have to walk a little bit to get from spot to spot. So wear your pretty shoes for the photos, and your comfortable shoes for the way to your Paris photo shoot and the little walks in between locations.\n\nBring or leave to your Eiffel Tower session\n\nWhat you need to bring to your Eiffel Tower photo session is:\n\nFlats: An extra pair of flats in case your wear high heels.\n\nCoat & Umbrella: A warm extra layer and umbrella in case the weather it is cool or rainy.\n\nAdditional outfits in case you planned outfit changes with your Eiffel Tower photographer.\n\nPhone & Cash: Your phone and a bit of cash for your transportation to the Eiffel Tower (Uber, cab, taxi). Cash for your Eiffel Tower photographer if you did not already pay the remainder in advance. And maybe a bit of money for a nice breakfast after your shoot.\n\nRing & Vows: Don’t forget the engagement ring if you are planning a Paris surprise proposal. And don’t forget your wedding rings and wedding vows when you are planning a Paris elopement wedding or Paris vow renewal.\n\nWhat you better don’t bring to your Eiffel Tower photo session:\n\nValuables: Don’t take any valuables to your Eiffel Tower photo session e.g. your passport, credit cards, more cash than you need that morning etc. What you don’t need for the photoshoot better leave it in your accommodation to avoid loss.\n\nWhat do you do after your Eiffel Tower photo session?\n\nAs your Eiffel Tower photographers we recommend you two things for when you are done with your photo session at the Eiffel Tower:\n\n1. More photos in Paris: Travel to a different area in Paris and continue your photo shoot at a different place, with a different vibe, maybe even with a wardrobe change. After your Eiffel Tower photo session you can e.g. continue with a Louvre photo session, a photo session at Alexander III bridge, a casual and candid photoshoot in Notre Dame area or a romantic photo session in a Parisian park."
