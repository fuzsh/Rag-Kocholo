        "text": "With cinematic spectacle Oppenheimer set to hit the theatres today, British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan has become the talk of the town. Undoubtedly one of the most iconic filmmakers of our time, his cerebral and intricately plotted narratives set him apart. Accompanying this, a striking visual journey is often one of the most pivotal part of the Nolan cinematic experience.\n\nThe brilliant sets he brings to life can be listed as distinct triumphs as these are not only mere dramatic backdrops, but they build the narrative, theme, and atmosphere of his films. Following a deep dive into Nolan's filmography, AD India explores seven distinctive sets, designs and spaces—from older gems like The Prestige (2006) to Oppenheimer (2023)—that shaped the audience's visual journey.\n\nThe Masterful World Of Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer is set to be no less that a monumental cinematic event. Releasing on 21 July 2023 alongside Greta Gerwig's Barbie, the movie has fans reeling with anticipation. And true to his oeuvre, Christopher Nolan's visual design is set to awe this time as well. Nolan's preference for practical effects over CGI wizardry is no secret, and the movie is all set to embrace the spectacle. Courtesy of Hoyte van Hoytema, it is the first movie to shoot certain sections in IMAX black and white photography, immersing the viewers in a visual experience packed with historical weight.\n\n(Un)Folding Paris In Inception\n\nA cinematic game-changer on multiple levels, Inception (2010) stunned the cinema fraternity with its pioneering set designs – and at the heart of it all, the scene where Paris folds onto itself. Designed by production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas, it remains etched in everyone's collective memory for its mind-bending visualization. Inspired by artist M. C. Escher, Dyas' demanding task was to create a surreal cityscape that completely defied the laws of physics and yet felt grounded in a dreamlike reality. What emerged, a meticulous combination of practical effects and computer-generated imagery, became a remarkable spectacle that flawlessly embodied the film's core concept, dream manipulation.\n\nAlso read: Rocket Boys: A deep dive into the series’ sets that brought its world alive\n\nThe “Turnstiles” Take Over In Tenet\n\nTenet (2020), Nolan's ambitious exploration of the central plot theme of time inversion, featured one of the most visually striking sets in his oeuvre—the \"turnstiles\". Production designer Nathan Crowley created these machines as fitting physical embodiments of the film's complex temporal themes, showing both the forward and backward movements of the characters simultaneously while using distinguishing colours to set them apart. The design, starkly industrial and abstract, was a visual riddle that invoked curiosity and intrigue among audiences. These mysterious machines became symbols of Tenet's intricate narrative, enabling the audience to grapple with the film's mind-twisting concept.\n\nChristopher Nolan's films have always exemplified how detailed and imaginative set designs contribute significantly to the storytelling process, and this only continues with Oppenheimer. Whether it's a city folding upon itself, an expansive batcave, or time-inverting machinery, these architectures of imagination shape the viewing experience, transforming a passive viewing experience into one that leaves indelible marks on the audience's minds."
