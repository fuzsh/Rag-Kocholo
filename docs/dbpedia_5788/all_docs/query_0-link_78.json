Paris has been the inspiration for countless cult films, which means hundreds of scenes have been shot across the city which you can go and visit for yourself. Immerse yourself in the very places huge Hollywood actors like Angelina Jolie, Emma Stone, Owen Wilson and Leonardo DiCaprio (to name just a few) have set foot, and explore the scenes from your favourite movies in real time. These iconic films have inspired millions to visit Paris and fall in love with the city for themselves, because Paris really is like the films.\n\nLooking for somewhere to stay in Paris that's fun and affordable? Our are ideally located in the heart of the city.\n\nScroll down to see these film locations in Paris on our interactive map.\n\n1. Café des Deux Moulins\n\nThe Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain\n\n15 Rue Lepic, 75018 Paris\n\nIf there’s a film you should watch ahead of a trip to Paris, it’s The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain. This romantic comedy is about a young woman called Amélie who helps people break out of their comfort zones and find happiness. In the film, Amélie works as a waitress at a quintessentially Parisian cafe called Café des Deux Moulins, located on the corner of a quaint cobblestone street in Montmartre. Navigate your way through one of the most beautiful parts of Paris until you stumble across the iconic red awning of Cafe des Deux Moulins, then grab a seat, order a cup of coffee and enjoy a bit of people watching from their row of traditional outdoor tables.\n\n2. Bistrot La Renaissance\n\nInglourious Basterds\n\n112 Rue Championnet, 75018 Paris\n\nThe chosen set for more movies than you can count on your fingers, Bistrot La Renaissance in the 18th arrondissement is most famous for its appearance in Quentin Tarrantino’s Inglourious Basterds. Remember when Shosanna is smoking a cigarette while reading a book when German war hero Frederick Zoller shows up? Well this is the place. Built in the 1930s, Bistrot la Renaissance has barely changed a bit. Full of art-deco features and heaps of character, it’s a perfect place to sit down with a coffee and a that won’t blow your budget in north Paris. Movie lovers can’t miss out on a trip to this classic Paris film location.\n\n3. Shakespeare & Company bookstore\n\nBefore Sunset\n\n37 Rue de la Bûcherie, 75005 Paris\n\nThis quaint independent bookstore right near the Seine and Notre Dame is undoubtedly one of the most photogenic spots in Paris . While the entire movie, Before Sunset, was shot and set in the City of Love, we’ve chosen to include Shakespeare and Company as the stand out location for this romantic American drama - it’s the star of the opening scene after all. The English language bookshop first opened its doors in 1951 and was named after William Shakespeare 400 years after his birthday. Whether you’re a bookworm, a huge movie fan or simply a lover of historic Parisian architecture, you won’t have to go out of your way to visit this film location as it’s right in the very heart of the city.\n\n4. Musée Rodin\n\nMidnight in Paris\n\n77 Rue de Varenne, 75007 Paris\n\nDirected by the legend that is Woody Allen, and starring big names like Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams and the then-First Lady of France Carla Bruni, this rom com will have you planning your next trip to the French capital ASAP. There are countless iconic locations in this film set in Paris, including the stunning 18th century mansion that is Musée Rodin, dedicated to the master sculptor Auguste Rodin. It’s in the beautiful museum gardens that Gil (Owen Wilson) begins to get irritated at Paul (Michael Sheen) for being such a know-it-all about Rodin, and belittling the knowledge of the museum’s curator, Inez (Rachel McAdams). It’s a top scene amongst the film’s fanbase and therefore a must visit location if you loved this movie, too.\n\n5. Place de la Concorde\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada\n\n75008 Paris\n\nRight in between the Eiffel Tower and Le Louvre is the fountain where Anne Hathaway’s character Andy finally has her turning point, throwing her beeping phone into the Fontaine des Fleuves with delight. That classic Parisian view of the Place de la Concorde and the Paris wheel in the backdrop is an unmissable sight, but for Devil Wears Prada fans you’ll recognise the view straight away from the film. Plus it’s the ideal location to visit in between touring the city’s most notable attractions as it’s smack bang in the city centre.\n\n6. Bir-Hakeim bridge\n\nInception\n\n75015 Paris\n\nThe film Inception has a pretty cult following due to its mind-blowing premise and, let’s face it, Leonardo DiCaprio, and you can see one of the main film locations right in the heart of Paris. You might just know it as ‘the bridge from Inception’, but it’s really called Bir-Hakeim Bridge and is just a stone's throw away from the Eiffel Tower. The bridge is one of the first places where Ariadne discovers that she can manipulate a dream, so a pretty significant scene in the movie. Plus, wouldn’t you want to take a walk knowing Leo DiCaprio has been in that exact spot?\n\n7. Church of Saint Sulpice\n\nThe Da Vinci Code\n\n2 Rue Palatine, 75006 Paris\n\nThe second largest church in Paris after Notre Dame, the church of Saint Sulpice is a major stop on the Da Vinci Code location tour. The church is home to the Gnomon and the ‘Rose Line’, an ancient sundial and line crossing the floor of the church, made famous by the Dan Brown novel which was published in 2003 before being turned into the film starring Tom Hanks. Located near Jardin du Luxembourg, in a district packed full of French charm, the church of Saint Sulpice is incredibly easy to reach and a marvel for those of you obsessed with both film and architecture.\n\n8. Hôtel de Soubise\n\nMarie Antoinette\n\n60 Rue des Francs Bourgeois, 75004 Paris\n\nThe Soubise Hotel in the centre of Paris is no doubt the grandest film location on this list. The 14th century building was one of the destinations used for the set of the Palace of Versailles, and was where Marie Antoinette, played by Kirsten Dunst, first laid eyes on the palace. Now, Hôtel de Soubise is part of the French National Archives, and while you may think it’s a place for wealthy people to stay during a trip to Paris, it’s actually a stately home. While it’s spectacular from the outside, visit inside for €5 and marvel at the intricately designed interiors, famous for being one of the greatest examples of Rococo architecture in the city.\n\n9. Le Nemours café\n\nThe Tourist\n\n2 à 7 Galerie de Nemours, 2 Place Colette, 75001 Paris\n\nHave breakfast at the very place Angelina Jolie ate hers in the opening scene of The Tourist. Just around the corner from Le Louvre and the Palais Royal, Le Nemours Cafe is where Elise (Angelina Jolie) burns a letter using the tealight keeping her pot of tea warm. Sit down at a table on their outdoor terrace and enjoy the atmosphere at this elegant Paris cafe, while sipping a cup of tea or a glass of wine. Being in such a prime people-watching spot, you could sit there soaking up the Parisian way of life in the 1st arrondissement forever.\n\n10. Le Caveau du Huchette\n\nLa La Land\n\n5 Rue de la Huchette, 75005 Paris\n\nLe Caveau du Huchette in the Latin Quarter is the jazz club where Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) end up listening to live music in one scene, before Sebastien takes over the piano in another. What you see in the film is really what this famous Parisian jazz club is all about in real life. The Lindy Hop and Swing dance all night to the best musicians in the business, in between cocktails from the bar. Whether or not you’re obsessed with the film like millions are, Le Caveau du Huchette will be a night out in Paris you’ll never forget.\n\nCheck out these must-see Paris movie locations on the map below"
