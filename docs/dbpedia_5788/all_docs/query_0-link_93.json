        "text": "It’s been ten years since the movie hit the big screen. It never got the follow up it deserves.\n\nLots of caveats here, but if you remove animated films, franchise films, sequels, pre-existing IP or films based on real-world events, what’s the most successful movie of all time (international box office)? That’s right, it’s Inception. The most popular original film of all time.\n\nBut of course, measuring a Christopher Nolan film solely by box office gross misses the point. His films stick with you. A city folding on itself. A fight in a spinning hallway. A top that doesn’t fall over. Those and a dozen more moments stick in our head — like a virus — 10 years later. But, unlike so many of the other movies on that all-time box office list, Inception didn’t spawn a sequel, prequel or extended universe. Sure, when the trailer first came out there was some wishful thinking that TENET might be connected to Inception, but the truth is Nolan doesn’t think that way, at least not with his own original stories.\n\nBut why should that keep us from having a little fun? I’ve always thought Inception would be a great story to expand on the small screen. There was so much about that world that was intriguing and that I puzzled over days and weeks later. But taking a property from the cinema and bringing it to the small screen can be a tough proposition. For every M*A*S*H* there is a Treadstone. For every Westworld, there is a Beyond Westworld. Books tend to be a better analog for long-form serialized storytelling. Movies are good at telling a single story, while shows are better when you want to explore a world. Alien Nation is another good example. Made sense as a film, not so much as a show.\n\nBut Nolan did such a fantastic job creating a world with just a few hints and nods. In a single scene he gave us glimpses of entire worlds to be discovered. The trick is figuring out how to not only avoid the mistakes but also tell a story worthy of the original.\n\nWhat to avoid\n\nFirst, here’s what I would be sure to avoid were I in charge of the show:\n\nDon’t do a remake\n\nYes, it can be done (again, see M*A*S*H*), but you’re more likely to get a Private Benjamin. Can you imagine someone else playing Cobb, Eames, Arthur, or Ariadne? Neither can I. So let’s just put that idea to bed right now. We’re going to need a new crew.\n\n2. Don’t ruin the mystery\n\nWhen you’ve got 10 hours to fill instead of two, the temptation is to go deep on some of the things that were a little vague in the film. But if you try to spend time explaining the PASIV device you’re going to end up creating more questions than answers. And honestly, who cares? I don’t want to know how Deckard was able to “enhance” the photos using the ESPER machine either.\n\n3. Don’t do an Agents of Shield\n\nI only watched a couple of episodes of Agents of Shield. I couldn’t get into it because I just didn’t feel the stakes were high enough. Can I imagine that there is some shadowy organization that coordinates the clandestine operations of multiple Extraction crews around the globe? Yes. Do I want to watch a show based around the middle management at that organization? No. Apologies to Agent Coulson.\n\n4. Don’t be afraid to break new ground\n\nNoah Hawley has done an incredible job with Fargo because rather than trying to create an exact replica of the Cohen Bros. film, he focused on the sensibility of the movie instead. A show based on Inception should maintain the same tone, look and feel, but not slavishly copy every beat.\n\nWhat to Embrace\n\nSo, with point four in mind, what should an Inception show embrace?\n\nIdeas over Action\n\nThe first season of HBO’s Westworld was terrific because the tension was built around ideas more than physical action. By season three it had become just another B-tier sci-fi action show. Yes, the set pieces in Inception are amazing, but what made it different from a Bond, Mission:Impossible or Bourne movie was that it kept you thinking from beginning to end. The moral and ethical implications of violating a person’s subconscious is where the real drama lies, not in another car chase.\n\n2. The compelling team dynamic\n\nSo many of the brilliant little parts of Inception center around the interplay between the members of the crew. Eames and Arthur clearly have a history, and while it’s not exactly an emnity towards one another, there is some friction there. Add in a skeptical Ariadne, the attempted betrayal by Nash and you have all kinds of competing egos and agendas. The Usual Suspects is a great example of this as well. Tension within the team, the constant threat of a double-cross, this is what hooks people and makes them want to stick around week after week.\n\n3. The Cons and Tricks\n\nDom’s crew has to keep one step ahead of Fischer, who has been trained to resist such attacks. From Mr. Charles to the Penrose Staircase to Eames the Forger, the crew continually pulled another clever trick from their bag each time it looked like they were about to be caught. Movies like Rounders, Grifters, and of course the Ocean’s series were all brilliant at threading the needle of making anti-heroes seem cool while never letting you forget they were actually criminals who were likely to get their asses kicked if and when they got caught. Their use of insider jargon made the audience feel like they were given access to a secret world. Let’s be sure and keep that.\n\n4. The Suits and the Locales\n\nDom and his crew weren’t a gang of street thugs, they’re a professional operation whose clientele (and marks) are captains of industry. As such, they looked the part. I’d put the money I’m saving by not having to pay DiCaprio to make sure the actors are dressed appropriately. And yes, the action can mostly take place in New York, or L.A. or the Bay Area — that’s where the money is in the U.S. — but the movie’s interludes to Paris and Mombassa added just enough international intrigue to keep it interesting. Prague, Sao Paolo, Singapore, let’s explore the world a little bit when we can, but mostly this is going to be a show filled with good looking people looking good.\n\nCasting\n\nFinally, where’s the fun if you don’t do some casting? Nolan is famous for using the same actors in multiple projects, so let’s see who we can pull from the Nolanverse to bring to this show. Here’s my wishlist:\n\nBen Mendelsohn — From the Dark Knight Rises (but you know him from Rogue One and HBO’s The Outsider). Leader of an International Control Council police unit charged with tracking down users, sellers, distributors, and producers of the illegal drug, Somnacin.\n\nDavid Gyasi — From Interstellar and The Dark Knight Rises. Point Man in the crew (the Arthur role). Was an early partner of Dom Cobb.\n\nDavid Dastmalchian — From The Dark Knight (incredible imdb). Corrupt CEO and current candidate for President. He’s the mark the crew are trying to incept.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss — From Memento. Runs security for Dastmalchian’s CEO/Politician. She used to work with Mendelsohn’s character at the DEA, now they are rivals to a degree.\n\nRebecca Hall — From The Prestige. The client. She is the wife of Dastmalchian’s character. She hates her husband and wants him to fail. She is part of a wealthy family and has the money to pay the crew.\n\nSome other, non-Nolan actors that would be great:\n\nNicholas Hoult — From Mad Max: Fury Road and The Great — You need that one member of the team with a sense of humor and if you’ve watched The Great, you know Hoult can deliver. And with genre work including X-Men and Mad Max, he’ll fit right in.\n\nAli Stroker — From Instinct and Broadway shows. Casting a wheelchair-bound actress might seem like a bit of tokenism, but I think it actually has real merit as a creative choice. As the Architect she has the opportunity to build worlds and explore them in ways unavailable to her in the real world.\n\nLena Waithe — From Ready Player One and Westworld. I just love her look and vibe. She seems like she could bring a variety of energy levels, depending on what was required, an essential ability for a Forger."
