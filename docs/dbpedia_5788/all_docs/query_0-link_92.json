        "text": "After revisiting Inception on its 10th anniversary, prior the release of Tenet, I couldn't stop myself from thinking: Nolan's audacity might be the seed of the future of cinema.\n\nA lot of films became seminal, almost godlike, to me. Inception is one of them, no doubt. As a student, I watched it about seven times in theaters. Yes, I paid seven tickets in 2010 to watch Paris fold upon itself. In 2020, it was just as visually fantastic.\n\nLittle caveat though: this was IMAX. And I am aware Inception was shot on good old 35mm film. Sitting in the theaters, I assumed they had done a transfer from the original format onto IMAX, in order for it to be projected in such gargantuan fashion. So, when I started to notice how out of focus many significant parts of the film were, I was taken out of the experience more than once. While I refused the notion that a filmmaker such as Mr. Nolan, and a Cinematographer of the likes of Wally Pfister (who won an Oscar with this film) would allow such a thing, two things came to mind: first, I don't recall the film being that out of focus, but then again, I wasn't a proud four eyes back in 2010; two, I had had a similar experience on the same theater chain back in 2017. Ten minutes into Dennis Villeneuve's amazing \"Arrival\", I walked out of the room to complain. After being doubted by two employees, I pulled my \"I bloody work in this industry card\" and it was later confirmed that the film, was indeed being projected out of focus. So, this whole process was going on in the back of my mind... for a while. Then the film swallowed me once more.\n\nWe can have a lot of debates and discussions about the nature of its story, more specifically how every character feels like he's only there to fulfill a plot divination, coming off more like a piece of a puzzle than one of humanity - maybe with the exception of Cobb himself. The conversation for the over the top moments with no time to let us process most of it can also be had. However, I don't think that's the issue. Or issues at least. As I was coming home with a friend and coworker, I said - for his utmost surprise - that I did not enjoy watching Inception.\n\nMind you, I was know among my group of friends as the Inception nerd who saw the film like his life depended on it.\n\n\"Yeah, I really can't fall in love with this kind of films any more\" - I told him.\n\n\"But the film is amazing!\" - he defended.\n\nThat wasn't the point. Inception is bonkers amazing. Think about it. In 2010, before the Avengers went back in time, creating a multi-verse in the process, Nolan was making a commercial, Hollywood blockbuster, about dreams and the perception of time. Just the concepts and inner workings of these two things alone have spawned more books than one will probably read his entire lifetime.\n\nAnd yet, Christopher Nolan lays it all in a challenging, yet comprehensive manner, in less than three hours. That, for me, is the great achievement. It's the result of a fearless, uncompromising filmmaker.\n\nInception's cinematography is both amazing and proper, its rhythm made Lee Smith a legend, Hans Zimmer's music will forever be remembered, the VFX made its dreams into reality, and, the production design, the costumes, and the incredible cast make it whole.\n\nHowever, what makes Inception stand the test of time, is Christopher Nolan's fearless pursuit to change and evolve the medium of film. The very same quality that led him into Tenet.\n\nIn 2010, I was absolutely sick of commercial films and felt deeply alienated by the art house productions to the effect I decided to change courses - to animation. Inception showed me a film could still break old ideas and challenge perceptions. The moment I saw a corridor spin, I felt like the true potential of cinema had been somewhat reanimated.\n\n\"What do you mean, commercial films don't need to suck?\" - I thought.\n\nAnd I think I'm not alone in this. More and more, I feel like this fearless attitude has made more people want to make their own films.\n\nNaturally, this doesn't mean Nolan is single handedly doing this. He's not alone. Alfonso Quaron, Pawel Pavlikovsky, Tarantino, PT Anderson, Wes Anderson, Noah Baumbach, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Boong-Jong Ho, Greta Gerwig, Ava Duverney, Jane Campion, Claire Dennis, Agnes Varda and many many others, have had a big impact (and will continue to do so) as well.\n\nWhat I mean to say, is that in the blockbuster space, in the commercial world, Nolan's fearlessness is a seed that could very well pave the way for another wave of blockbuster filmmakers like him. Now, during a pandemic whose impact will translate (and already is) into seismic changes in the industry, this landscape won't probably be the same.\n\nBut I am still happy for having been able to see a film like Inception in theaters, even if I outgrew the film that made me want to be a director in the first place. And for that reason, I'll be forever grateful to Christopher Nolan."
