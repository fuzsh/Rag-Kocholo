        "text": "The Best Eiffel Tower Photo Spots – The Paris Photographer\n\nLooking for the best Eiffel Tower photo spots? Explore this guide created by a team of passionate Parisian photographers. When you travel to Paris, the must-have picture is probably of the Iron Lady. But if it’s your first time in Paris, then you’re probably not aware of the multitude of locations that offer a great view over the Eiffel Tower. Hopefully, this page will provide all the information that you need to know about all the great photo locations with the Eiffel.\n\nWe’d like to mention that this guide is primarily focused to help our Paris photo shoots clients decide on their favorite locations. It is also helpful for couples planning and Eiffel Tower wedding. However, you can take advantage of this local knowledge even if you’re not taking professional pictures.\n\n1. Trocadéro is the best Eiffel Tower photo spot.\n\nThe Esplanade de Trocadéro is the place that offers the most spectacular view over Eiffel Tower. While some renovation works are still in place, most of the photo spots are now available. The aim of the works is to build the largest garden in Paris, with a 1.6km long green space around the Eiffel Tower to allow pedestrians and cyclists to move around freely. Explore the list of works for the Tower on The Local.\n\nWhat spots around Trocadéro are not available anymore?\n\nThere is one spot that is permanently not available for pictures: the wall. Meaning that it’s not possible to take photos sitting on the wall anymore. The reason for this is that the top of the wall was modified to make sitting impossible. See the photos below.\n\nThis means that such pictures are not possible anymore. See below.\n\nEiffel Tower Photo Shoot\n\nWe are a friendly team of professional and English speaking photographers and videographers based in Paris. If you’d like to take breathtaking pictures by the Eiffel Tower, we’d be incredibly happy to be your Paris photographers.\n\nWhat spots around Trocadéro are available?\n\nDuring the Olympic games (plus a little bit before and a little bit after) some of the main spots around the Eiffel Tower are inaccessible. Please take a look at the article that covers the Olympic games and what spots are available for photos.\n\nIf you are wondering, what alternative Eiffel Tower photo spots can be found in Paris. Feel free to explore the list of locations below and ask your photographer to put together a personalized itinerary based on the inspiration images that you like the most.\n\nMap of the Best Eiffel Tower Photo Spots\n\n2. Avenue de Camoëns. Second best Eiffel Tower photo spot.\n\nThis is a quiet street that offers a great view over the Eiffel Tower. The uniqueness of this place is the beautiful architecture that surrounds the street. The typical Haussmanian buildings offer that one of a kind Parisian charm.\n\n3. Bir Hakeim bridge (Inception bridge)\n\nThe Bir Hakeim bridge, famous from the movie Inception with Leonardo DiCaprio has one of the most spectacular views overlooking the Eiffel Tower. The uniqueness of this Eiffel Tower spot is the fact that the bridge itself is beautiful and can make for a cool backdrop for your Paris pictures.\n\n4. The Seine River – Romantic Eiffel Tower Photo Spot\n\nThere is something about water that makes it romantic. Many couples choose to celebrate their marriage on a river cruise on the Seine River. There is a great spot close to the Tower that offers a gorgeous view and it’s perfect for romantic pictures. If the water means something to you as a couple, then this spot should be on the list.\n\n5. Promenade Marie de Roumanie\n\nThis spot is probably one of the prettiest around the Eiffel, especially during the warm season. There are several Parisian benches that are great props for pictures. However, the uniqueness of this location are the blossoming roses. Red, purple, white, yellow, simply choose the color that matches your photo shoot outfits.\n\n6. Rue de l’Université\n\nThis cute little street is right next to the Eiffel Tower. The view is quite spectacular due to the proximity of the tower, which measures 1063 ft.\n\n7. Pasarelle Debilly\n\nThis pedestrian bridge is in walking distance from the Eiffel Tower and the well known exquisite restaurant Monsieur Bleu. More and more people leave their love-locks on this bridge (we don’t encourage such gestures by the way, to preserve the looks of the city), so in your pictures, you’ll see these as well.\n\n8. Rue Saint Dominique\n\nThis spot is a bit further from the Eiffel Tower, close to the Café Le Recrutement. The typical Parisian buildings and a street that breaths Parisian air are the ideal setting for romantic street pictures with the Eiffel Tower.\n\n9. Alexander 3 bridge\n\nIf all the other spots that we mentioned earlier are within walking distance from the Tower, to get to the Alexander 3 bridge we recommend to take public transportation or taxi/uber. The bridge is probably one of the best photography spots in Paris. The incredibly elegant architecture and the beautiful golden details make it perfect for romantic photos. Plus, you can get the Eiffel Tower in your pictures.\n\nCafé Photos\n\nIf you are on a Paris photo session itinerary, after so many pictures with the Eiffel Tower and walking, you’d appreciate a strategic stop in a Parisian café. We recommend Casé Castel that is very close to the Tower and has great cappuccino. If you have booked a multi-hours photo shoot, then you can change outfits here for your next location. If not, then it would be fun to finish your photo session with a few piece-of-life pictures. Enjoying a delicious croissant and cappuccino.\n\nWe take pleasure in creating beautiful images for our clients in Paris, especially around the most iconic landmark: the Eiffel Tower. We would love to take your photos too!\n\nIf you happen to travel across the channel and visit London, know that there are many beautiful photo spots there too."
