        "text": "What if your guide in Paris was a famous film director like Woody Allen or Luc Besson? This fantasy is closer to reality than you think. Discover Paris in a surprising and original way, by following in the footsteps of your favorite movie characters. We’ve picked seven iconic locations from well-known modern movies to zest up your Parisian explorations.\n\nThe Café in Amélie\n\nAfter a tiresome walk up and down Montmartre’s steep streets, enjoy a cup of grand crème at Café des Deux Moulins, just a block away from Blache metro station in the 18th arrondissement. You might not get Amélie Poulain as a waitress, but you will get a taste of the whimsical and melancholic world of this daydreaming character in a typical Parisian brasserie.\n\nCafé des Deux Moulins,15 Rue Lepic, 75018 Paris, France,+33 1 42 54 90 50\n\nThe Endless Bridge from Inception\n\nRemember when Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) showed gifted student Ariadne (Ellen Page) how to construct dreams and create imaginary places? One of the most iconic scenes from the movie Inception (2010) was filmed under the bridge Bir-Hakeim in the 15th arrondissement. If you want to add mystery to your late evening walk near the Eiffel Tower, this is a perfect spot.\n\nBir-Hakeim, Quai de Grenelle, 75015 Paris, France\n\nThe Steps from Midnight in Paris\n\nChurch\n\nThe steps of the Church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont are a perfect place to stop and eat a sandwich after a walk in the Quartier Latin. We can’t guarantee that wonders will start happening once you sit here, however it is where the main character of Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris (2011) would await his cab from the past, so you never know.\n\nSee privacy policy.\n\nThe hidden park from Before Sunset\n\nPark\n\nSecret park Coulée verte René-Dumont on the top of an obsolete railway infrastructure is a well-known first date spot among Parisians. No surprise, it was chosen as one of locations for the sequel to the romantic drama Before Sunrise (1995). Go up the stairs at 44-46, Rue de Lyon and enjoy a meditative walk that, as the film has proved, inspires deep philosophical discussions as well as mind-liberating decisions.\n\nFountain from The Devil Wears Prada\n\nIf you want to repeat the audacious gesture of Meryl Streep’s protégé, who threw her phone into the fountain to put an end to her exhausting career, go to the Place de la Concorde. The twin fountains, La Fontaine des Fleuves and la Fontaine des Mers, are a great viewpoint to feel fully surrounded by Parisian landmarks such as Tuileries, the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. Think twice before getting rid of your phone though.\n\nPlace de la Concorde, 75008 Paris, France\n\nPont Neuf and La Samaritaine from The Bourne Identity\n\nWhen you cross Pont Neuf in Paris keep in mind that someone might be watching you at this very moment from the roof of the Samaritaine department store. At least that was what Matt Damon was doing in The Bourne Identity (2002). If only he could have done better job speaking French, even though ‘Punt Noof’ sounds rather charming."
