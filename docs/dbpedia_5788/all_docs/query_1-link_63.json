        "text": "Jaws, Massachusetts, USA\n\nFor Spielberg's classic thriller, Jaws, Joseph Sylva State Beach became fictional Amity Island. Visit the dock and see the place where the suspected fishy culprit was strung up for the town to see or head over to the beach and see the spot where the Kinter boy was killed. Just stay out of the water...\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, London, England\n\nIn both J. K. Rowling's magical Harry Potter books and the movie, the Hogwarts Express, which takes the young wizards to school, departs from Platform 9¾ at Kings Cross Station. If you want to follow in the footsteps of Harry and the Weasley family, head to the arch between platforms 4 and 5. Just don't try to run through the wall - unless you're in the market for a headache.\n\nAmélie, Paris, France\n\nJean-Pierre Jeunet turned Paris's Montmartre into a magical place for his Oscar-nominated masterpiece Amélie. One of the most memorable locations from the movie is the beautiful art deco cafe where Amélie worked. Head inside to try the delicious crème brulée, which is now named after Amélie.\n\nThe Hangover, Nevada, USA\n\nThe Hangover, the tale of a stag night gone very wrong in sin city, was largely filmed in Las Vegas. Most memorable is the villa in Caesars Palace where the doomed four stay. If you have the readies, you can book in for a night yourself - just hope you won't find Mike Tyson or a tiger waiting for you. You might also want to take a trip up to the hotel's roof and see the spot Doug is held captive in for the majority of the movie.\n\nThe English Patient, Tuscany, Italy\n\nIn The English Patient, Kip famously takes Hana to a church, secures her into a harness and shows her its frescos with a flare. You can still visit the location of this romantic scene, the Basilica San Francesco - and although the chapel has since been restored, you can still take in its wonderful painted ceiling.\n\nThe Talented Mr. Ripley, Rome, Italy\n\nIn Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Ripley, Dickie and Ripley visit jazz Nightclub Vesuvio in Naples and perform Tu Vuo' Fa L'Americano. In reality, the Vesuvio is Caffè Latino, a bar in Rome. They're used to film tourists here, and if you're really lucky the barman might teach you the song Jude Law and Matt Damon sang in the movie.\n\nInception, Paris, France\n\nIt may all seem make-believe, but Christopher Nolan's extraordinary Inception was filmed across several counties - leaving in its wake real-life locations that you can now visit. A large amount of the action takes place in Paris, including the pivotal scene between Ariadne and Cobb when the Cafe Debussy explodes around them. This was, in fact, filmed at a deli, Da Stuzzi - which Nolan's team turned into a cafe for the scene. It's still there to see - they didn't blow it up for the movie, but instead used high-pressure nitrogen to give the effect of a series of blasts.\n\nPretty Woman, Los Angeles, USA\n\nThink Pretty Woman and you might think of the Regent Beverly Wiltshire - the hotel where Vivian and Edward's relationship begins. But for an alternative Pretty Woman experience, venture away from the glamour of the Wiltshire to the Las Palmas Hotel, just off Hollywood Boulevard. This is home to Vivian's apartment with Kat in the movie, and the spot where Edward climbs the fire escape to the sounds of Traviata.\n\nGoing to L.A.? Don't miss the opportunity to choose the best places to stay in the city.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings, Waikato, New Zealand\n\nThe originally named Hobbiton, home of hobbits Frodo, Bilbo Baggins, Sam and Pippin, was built especially for The Lord of the Rings in Waikato's Hinuera Valley. Although the location is back to its pre-hobbit state and the village is no longer there, you can visit The Shire on a tour of the valley and walk in Frodo's tiny footsteps.\n\nLost in Translation, the Park Hyatt Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nDive headfirst into the scenery of Lost in Translation and stay at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo. This location was used for all the internal hotel scenes, as well as shots of the pool and many of the hotel's spectacular views. If you don't have the readies to stay in the hotel, pop in to its bar (where Bob and Charlotte meet in the movie) for a Sofia cocktail, named after the movie's writer/director Sofia Coppola.\n\nNotting Hill, London, England"
