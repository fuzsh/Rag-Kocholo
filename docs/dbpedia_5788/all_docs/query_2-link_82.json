We follow every step of the way, as a small team of dedicated individuals are defying all odds to stage the athletes’ parade on a hundred boats along the river Seine while creating the biggest TV show that has ever-been produced.\n\nOlympic Games’ Opening Ceremonies have always made history due to their creativity, their magnitude, their drama and the stakes for the host country. It is the biggest show on earth. And this time, more than ever.\n\nPressed for time and under many constraints, a small group of men and women united by a common dream set out to achieve the impossible: to make the river Seine in the heart of Paris the largest ever stage in the world.\n\nEpisode 1 – LA GRANDE SEINE – PART 1\n\nThe Paris 2024 team gets the final go-ahead to organise the Opening Ceremony on the river Seine, involving grandiose artistic scenes along a six-kilometre course. While Thomas, the Artistic Director, builds his core team (Maud the choreographer, Victor, the music composer and Daphne, the costume supervisor), Thierry tries to find a way to convince the authorities to build grandstands along the river. But as they organize the first fleet test, reality catches up to them.\n\nEpisode 2 – LA GRANDE SEINE – PART 2\n\nAs the finish line approaches, fatigue sets in and the obstacles multiply. The level of the river Seine is still too high to allow for a final rehearsal, which is essential to the success of the Opening Ceremony. Maud suffers a serious injury. Thierry fights to protect confidentiality and Thomas is having trouble getting his ideas across. For Simon, the TV Director, the pressure is also mounting as he faces up to the gigantic scale of the project. The team also hope and pray that the weather will be on their side for the Ceremony.\n\nDirector\n\nManuel Herrero\n\nManuel Herrero is a renowned French producer and director. Before founding his own production house, Mañana, Herrero collaborated with CAPA, a prominent production company. Over his illustrious career, he has directed and produced over 40 films and series, often featuring some of the biggest names in sports.\n\nHis involvement with the Olympic movement began at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 when he joined the Paris 2024 core team during their bid for the Games. This partnership led to his work with the Olympic Channel, where he produced the original series ‘Legends Live On’.\n\nFor the past two years, Herrero has been dedicated to filming ‘La Grande Seine,’ offering an exclusive and personal look at the preparation for the Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony. His unique creative vision and ability to build trust with his subjects have allowed him to capture intimate and compelling behind-the-scenes moments.\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nYiannis Exarchos\n\nOBS Chief Executive Director and OCS Executive Director\n\nProducers\n\nJonathan Taylor\n\nDirector of Original Programming, Olympic Channel Services (OCS)\n\nNicolas Delloye\n\nCommissioning Editor, Original Programming, Olympic Channel Services (OCS)"
