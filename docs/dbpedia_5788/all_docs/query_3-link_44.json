His films include Following (1998), Memento (2000), Insomnia (2002), Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010), The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Interstellar (2014). Nonlinear narrative structure, flashbacks, existential angst and sociological ideas, identity crisis and\n\nfragmented subjectivity, self deception, unreliability of the human memory, metafictive elements, ambiguous endings and morally ambiguous characters are the major characteristics of his films. The line between reality and fantasy is blurred in Nolan’s films which puts his protagonists in difficult situations. Nolan’s filmmaking style is influenced by the film genres like noir, sci-fi, psychological thriller and crime drama. Nolan’s films Memento and Inception explore the wide range of possibilities of postmodern filmic narratives. Memento tells the story of Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from anterograde amnesia, searching for his wife’s murderer. Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb, a corporate espionage and estranged father who can steal valuable information from persons’ psyche by entering into their dreams, trying to return home to his children. The action of these films is related to the reliability of the memory/dream of the narrator and the protagonist-narrators’ inability to differentiate between reality and illusion.\n\nChristopher Nolan’ Inception is more than its folding cityscapes and mind-bending ambiguous ending.

It’s a film that makes its viewer question the very nature of reality. Not only is it possible that the entire movie is a dream, but multiple viewings of Inception leaves one wondering whether the same might be true of one’s experience. Indeed, according to the author of “The Fiction of Christopher Nolan” Todd McGowan, Inception calls its viewers to abandon any concern they have for knowledge of reality and instead choose to believe what they want. But does this moral hold up? Is it philosophically defensible? In this essay, after a close inspection of the movie itself, this moral will be identified and evaluated. An examination of a number of related arguments by important philosophers will reveal that, although knowledge of reality is sometimes difficult to attain, it should always be sought.\n\nThe paper aims to revitalise Gérard Genette’s literary term of ‘metalepsis’ within a cinematic context, emphasising the expression’s creative potentials for both analytical and creative approaches.

Through its ‘mainstream complexity,’ Christopher Nolan’s 2010 film Inception provides a novel and, at best, progressive contribution to contemporary Hollywood cinema, exemplified in its playful take on the diversified possibilities that the metaleptic logic allows. Nolan hereby (and similarly to Memento and The Prestige) follows his auteur affinity of converting, moreover, converging narrative and cognitive values into and within a fictional story. By introducing a fantastic, but at least conceivably possible futuristic world of permeable dreams in Inception, Nolan ‘diegetises’ the narrative feature of the embedded structures’ metaleptic transgressions, and inversely, by thoughtfully considering its viewer’s abilities of comprehension, ‘narrativises’ human cognitive skills into storytelling forms.\n\nAbstract Throughout its history, architecture has been interacting with various arts and sciences.

While architecture has an important place in the art branches such as painting, music, sculpture, literature and cinema, from the paintings of Vermeer to cubist paintings, the music of Bach, and the Mobydick of Herman Melville have inspired the architects. When the relation between cinema art and architecture is examined, it is seen that this relationship is more recent than other art branches. In this research, Inception movie is examined in the context of cinema-architecture disciplines. The said movie has a prominent place among the surrealist cinema movies that have emerged in recent years. Considering that the space design is not only composed of formal elements, in this study, which emphasizes the importance of space perception and dynamism for architecture, the effect of movie spaces created in cinematic conditions on space design will be examined and focus will be on the scenes where mental and imaginary spaces are used which are the original spaces of cinema. The transition of the spatial perception from the static to the dynamic will be discussed along with the identity and semantic transformations of the space especially through the Inception movie.\n\nMango is the popular tropical fruit that is consumed all around the world.

Proper classification of mango is must in agro-based industries. The conventional methods were\n\ntime-consuming and tedious. The aim of this paper is to develop an automated system which can recognize and classify mango\n\nimages. The identification of mango species is necessary in Indian market. Hence in this proposed paper, a deep learning\n\napproach known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using transfer learning is used to classify mango species with high\n\naccuracy and implemented by retraining the pretrained CNN. The Inception V3 model is trained on various image dataset of 12\n\ncategories of mango. This proposed work is simple and efficient. This model achieves an overall test accuracy of 97.6% for the\n\ntask of classification of mango images.\n\nThe article deals with the film Inception and shows educational opportunities that can be considered in connection with the film.

An introduction (1.) is followed by a summary of the film (2.1) and comments on the narrative concept of the film (2.2). Then it comes to the central theme of the film: the dream or dreaming (3.). Then similarities between dream and film are examined and the dream is presented as a possible metaphor for films (4.). Finally, there are considerations that show in what way the film can be used for educational opportunities (5.).\n\nThe cinematographic symbolic-narrative fabric constitutes one of the most interesting areas of research on the significant interplay between psychoanalysis and hermeneutics: the analysis of two works, Shutter Island (2010, Martin... more\n\nThe cinematographic symbolic-narrative fabric constitutes one of the most interesting areas of research on the significant interplay between psychoanalysis and hermeneutics: the analysis of two works, Shutter Island (2010, Martin Scorsese) and Inception (2010, Christopher Nolan) will attest to the density of meaning and heuristic validity of the Ricoeurian concept of \"narrative identity\" and, at the same time, will open up to a reflection on a disturbing question: \"can only Truth save?\". Will the protagonists be able to create the Ariadne's thread capable of saving them from the obscure labyrinth of their interiority? Leading to different outcomes, the conflict of the interpretations of cinema will force philosophy to face a head-on collision with the repressed trauma that has always distressed its unconscious: Truth. It can save (and not only be therapeutic) only if it does not destroy the fragility of the individual and instead gives him a new birth, the possibility of \"living in spite of everything\" by symbolically inhabiting the wound that constitutes him.\n\nDominic Cobb and his team of dream specialists steal ideas from people’s minds while they sleep.

Their latest project is to attempt the opposite, the fabled and highly improbable implanting of an idea—inception. Unfortunately, while inside a target’s mind, it is almost impossible to distinguish reality from the dream state constructed for the project. The ability to construct such vivid dreams suggests that our own dreams could be so vivid that we cannot tell, at any given time, that we aren’t dreaming. In this chapter, I explain the dream argument for the skeptical conclusion that we do not know whether any of our beliefs are true and three strategies for debunking it. Since it seems unlikely that the argument will be debunked anytime soon, I consider what the dream thieves should believe even if they cannot tell when they aren’t dreaming. I argue that if truth is not the only thing that makes beliefs valuable—for example, if there are intellectual virtues, such as trust and humility—it may be rational to continue believing in a certain way even if your beliefs may be false.\n\nLe 14 décembre 2019, dans le cadre du Workshop “Political Education for Human Transformation\", Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne, 17 rue de la Sorbonne, 75005 Paris, escalier C, 1er étage, salle Lalande Taking the phenomenon of the... more\n\nLe 14 décembre 2019, dans le cadre du Workshop “Political Education for Human Transformation\", Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne, 17 rue de la Sorbonne, 75005 Paris, escalier C, 1er étage, salle Lalande\n\nTaking the phenomenon of the cinematographic artialisation of recent revolutionary and terrorist behavior seriously encourages us to look in some films for authentic thoughts that can broaden the theoretical framework in which we try to relate to contemporary phenomena such as the relationship of skepticism to digital imagery and fanaticism. One of these thoughts is to recognize the ambivalence of moving images, which can teach us to contain our skepticism by making cinema an instrument for revealing the beauty and goodness of the ordinary, but which can also present us with a world so perfect and seductive that it makes ordinary existence in the real world seem too imperfect and painful to deserve to be lived.\n\nIn a 2010 film Inception, famous American director Cristopher Nolan poses an important question about the relationship between reality and dreams.

The main protagonist, Dominick Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is an information thief. He infiltrates into the subconscious of a sleeping person and either steals needed information or implants an idea. During the film, the audience finds out in a side plot that while experimenting on this technology, Cobb and his wife Mallorie Miles (Mal) went into \"limbo,\" a dimension of infinite raw subconscious. After spending a significant \"dream time\" in such a Matrix of their own, Mal became convinced that it was the reality. Thinkers in the Western tradition have long concerned themselves with the appearance-reality theme found in this movie.\n\nChristopher Nolan’s Inception is first and foremost a film that unveils for the viewer the process of creating cinema as art.1) Insofar as technological developments have accentuated the phantasmagorical in cinema, as illustrated by the... more\n\nChristopher Nolan’s Inception is first and foremost a film that unveils for the viewer the process of creating cinema as art.1) Insofar as technological developments have accentuated the phantasmagorical in cinema, as illustrated by the use of digital manipulation in Avatar, Inception, by contrast, concentrates on the role that cinema has played since its outset. Besides the fantastical and entertaining elements of mainstream film, cinema has developed a blind faith in technological progress as well as an overall sustaining economic discourse that has transformed history into a titillating show of a cul de sac. For cinema has characterized a displacement that allows the viewing public a sense of ubiquity, being in more than one place at once (from the split screen onwards); embracing the exotic as the possible; and by moving through foreign lands and cultures (something that television has familiarized at the nuclear level while erasing public space as a locus of political participation. Inception is then a mechanism of social criticism that attempts to provide viewers the necessary “kick” to reawaken from the dream..."
