        "text": "When envisioning Paris through the lens of cinema, my mind drifts to the captivating imagery of “Amélie.” This endearing romantic comedy from 2001 revolves around the eponymous character, portrayed by Audrey Tautou, as she navigates the enchanting streets of her hometown. Amidst her own inner struggles with solitude, Amélie becomes engrossed in the lives of those around her, orchestrating small acts of kindness anonymously. The movie is filmed across more than 80 locations in the city.\n\nJean-Luc Godard’s 1965 dystopian sci-fi masterpiece ingeniously transforms the Paris of its era into a world starkly different from our conventional perception. Filming predominantly at night, Godard utilized the sleek Modernist skyscrapers of La Défense and other contemporary developments to portray the sterile, computer-controlled regime of Alphaville. In this Orwellian landscape, reminiscent of “Brave New World,” an American detective with shades of Humphrey Bogart (portrayed by Eddie Constantine) ventures to restore freedom to its inhabitants.\n\nThe dance sequences in “An American in Paris” are incomparable. Gene Kelly’s masterful choreography, showcased in a mesmerizing 17-minute ballet without dialogue, earned him a prestigious Academy Honorary Award. Set to the enchanting melodies of Gershwin, the film follows Kelly’s character, an American painter in Paris, as he grapples with love for the already committed Lise Bouvier, portrayed flawlessly by Leslie Caron in her debut. The film’s extravagant set pieces and sprawling dance numbers, teeming with performers, are truly extraordinary.\n\nIf you’re not rooting for Jesse and Céline, are you even living? “Before Sunset” is Richard Linklater’s enchanting sequel to the tale of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Deply), continuing from their initial encounter in 1995’s “Before Sunrise.” The duo’s paths cross once more, nine years later in Paris. The film’s dialogue is both witty and poignant as it follows them on a stroll through the city, exploring the Marais district of the 4th arrondissement, Le Pure Café in the 11th arrondissement, and the Promenade Plantée park in the 12th arrondissement. Paris serves as the perfect backdrop for the narrative’s contemplation of fate and the ripple effects of decisions.\n\n“Belle de Jour” resides within a vast and problematic collection of films crafted by men, purportedly unveiling the clandestine sexual realm of women—a theme explored by nearly every significant European director of the latter half of the 20th century. However, amidst this landscape, the Spanish maestro Luis Buñuel stands out as one of the most astute and cunning. “Belle de Jour” stands as a testament to his sharp critique of upper-class manners and hypocrisies.\n\nReleased in 1960, this iconic Jean-Luc Godard film follows the escapades of Michel, a car thief who seeks refuge in Paris after a fatal encounter in Marseilles, and attempts to persuade Seberg’s character to flee to Rome with him. Not only did this film revolutionize French cinema, but it also solidified Seberg’s status as a timeless style icon. Despite the overt sexism displayed by Michel, the film remains a captivating exploration of Paris, with Godard guiding us through its winding streets, bustling boulevards, and cozy cafés.\n\nIn anticipation of my husband’s inaugural trip to Paris, we opted for a refresher course with “The Da Vinci Code.” As a fan of mysteries, I couldn’t think of a better way to familiarize him with the layout of the Louvre. The tidbits of museum trivia sprinkled throughout the film added an extra layer of intrigue, enhancing our experience when we eventually encountered the renowned Da Vinci paintings firsthand.\n\nDom Cobb, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a skilled thief who specializes in extracting secrets from people’s dreams. When tasked with planting an idea in someone’s subconscious, he assembles a team of experts, including the talented architect Ariadne, played by Elliot Page. Together, they navigate intricate dreamscapes of their own creation. Inception’s intricate plot defies summarization, so it’s best experienced firsthand. One standout moment occurs as Cobb assists Ariadne in honing her abilities, witnessing her manipulate the streets of Paris into surreal configurations, including the iconic Bir-Hakeim Bridge.\n\nThree decades following “Last Tango in Paris,” the renowned Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci returned with another sizzling drama set amidst the romantic backdrop of Paris. This film, unfolding against the tumultuous student riots of 1968, offers a sweeter tone compared to its predecessor. It serves as both a tribute to the allure of Paris and a reflection on the fervent passions and ideals that have drawn young souls to the city throughout history.\n\nWillem Dafoe, Natalie Portman, Alfonso Cuarón, Gus Van Sant, and the enchanting Parisian backdrop star in this 2006 anthology film. Featuring 22 directors overseeing 18 distinct plotlines, each set in different arrondissements throughout the City of Light, it offers a little something for everyone. In the Coen brothers’ segment “Tuileries,” Steve Buscemi becomes entangled in a lovers’ quarrel after an accidental eye contact; meanwhile, in “Quartier des Enfants Rouges,” Maggie Gyllenhaal portrays an American actress who finds herself drawn to her drug dealer."
