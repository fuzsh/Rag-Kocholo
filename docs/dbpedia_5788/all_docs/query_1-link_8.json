The movie’s cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Michael Caine. The team is sent on a corporate espionage mission, using an experimental technology that consists in infiltrating the subconscious of several men in order to extract information while experiencing shared dreaming. Several scenes of the movie are set in Paris.\n\nCobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) arrive in Paris to put together a team and find a new architect.\n\nThe architecture school\n\nCobb (Leonoardo DiCaprio) goes to the College of architecture (they used the Musée Galliera – City of Paris Fashion Museum) to find the young architect Ariadne (Ellen Page).\n\nIn a parisian bistro\n\nCobb explains to Ariadne the concept of “shared dreaming” in a fictional parisian bistro called Café Debussy in the 15th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nThe “Paris folding” scene takes place in the Rue Bouchut. Cobb shows Ariadne the power of imagination and makes the city bend in front of her eyes.\n\nLe Pont Bir Hakeim\n\nThe first Ariadne dream takes place on the Bir-Hakeim bridge near the Eiffel tower. The bridge also appears in the famous movie Last tango in Paris.\n\nThe dream training facility\n\nIt takes place in the foundation of the subway station Passy (line 6) in the 16th arrondissement."
