We follow every step of the way, as a small team of dedicated individuals are defying all odds to stage the athletes’ parade on a hundred boats along the river Seine while creating the biggest TV show that has ever-been produced.\n\nOlympic Games’ Opening Ceremonies have always made history due to their creativity, their magnitude, their drama and the stakes for the host country. It is the biggest show on earth. And this time, more than ever.\n\nPressed for time and under many constraints, a small group of men and women united by a common dream set out to achieve the impossible: to make the river Seine in the heart of Paris the largest ever stage in the world.\n\nEpisode 1 – LA GRANDE SEINE – PART 1\n\nThe Paris 2024 team gets the final go-ahead to organise the Opening Ceremony on the river Seine, involving grandiose artistic scenes along a six-kilometre course. While Thomas, the Artistic Director, builds his core team (Maud the choreographer, Victor, the music composer and Daphne, the costume supervisor), Thierry tries to find a way to convince the authorities to build grandstands along the river. But as they organize the first fleet test, reality catches up to them.\n\nEpisode 2 – LA GRANDE SEINE – PART 2\n\nAs the finish line approaches, fatigue sets in and the obstacles multiply. The level of the river Seine is still too high to allow for a final rehearsal, which is essential to the success of the Opening Ceremony. Maud suffers a serious injury. Thierry fights to protect confidentiality and Thomas is having trouble getting his ideas across. For Simon, the TV Director, the pressure is also mounting as he faces up to the gigantic scale of the project. The team also hope and pray that the weather will be on their side for the Ceremony."
