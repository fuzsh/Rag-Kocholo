        "text": "So, let's continue our photowalk in Paris. After the carousel, we cross the road to the embankment and walk along the course of the Seine to... the famous Bir Hakeim Bridge (or the Inception bridge ;))!\n\nYou’ve certainly seen Bir Hakeim Bridge in many films: “Last Tango in Paris,” “Inception,” “Mission: Impossible - Fallout,” and many others.\n\nTo start with, the bridge itself is really camera-friendly. It looks a lot like a tunnel in the Eiffel style and offers many chances to play with perspectives here. Secondly, there is another stunning view of the Eiffel Tower from here.\n\nIf you want to get there by public transport, you must either go to Bir Hakeim subway station or Passy - both are situated on the 6th line of light green color. By the way, I do recommend taking a ride on the subway between these two stations, as the train goes right over the bridge. This is the chance you won’t want to miss - to take photos in the Paris metro with a view off the car window over the Eiffel Tower!\n\nThe bridge is also served by the RER C trains (Bir Hakeim station). This train will take you to Musée d'Orsay, Notre Dame (Notre Dame Cathedral), Latin Quarter, and even further to Versailles (but first make sure you figure out which direction to go).\n\nI take it you’re already fed up with the tower views, let’s try something new :) Next stop will be in the Louvre area!
