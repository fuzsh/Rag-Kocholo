        "text": "Paris Travel Guide: The Trocadero\n\nParis Travel Guide: A Neighborhood Walk around the Trocadéro, with Eiffel Tower Views\n\nFirst Published: January 19, 2020\n\nLast Updated: April 9, 2023\n\nIf you’ve spent any time with me (virtually or in real life), you know I love a good city walk. I think it’s the best way to explore a new place.\n\nSome city walks just have that extra wow factor, and my Trocadéro morning walk is one of them!\n\nIn this post, I’ll tell you exactly when to visit the Trocadero (and avoid the crowds!) and where to walk for the best Eiffel Tower views. Then, you can tuck this Paris travel idea away in your back pocket and use it explore via the same route on your next visit to Paris.\n\nThe Trocadéro is relatively well-known as an area of the city that offers a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower. Located in the 16th Arrondissement on the Right Bank of Paris, a visit to the Trocadéro will get you a stunning view of the Iron Lady from across the Seine.\n\nThe downside: it’s almost always extremely crowded… unless you follow my tip for the best time to visit. I’ll give you a street-by-street walking guide for the perfect sunrise morning at the Trocadéro and the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nThe Best Time To Visit The Trocadero In Paris\n\nMy secret, and one that I would recommend to anyone, is to visit the Trocadéro incredibly early in the morning. I’d recommend arriving within 30 minutes of sunrise to enjoy the Trocadéro without masses of other tourists.\n\nThis will likely mean arriving between 6:30am-8:30am, depending on the time of year. Being an early bird on one day of vacation in Paris is definitely worth it in order to avoid the crowds - I wouldn’t recommend a visit at any other time of day.\n\nDuring the times I’ve visited the Trocadéro in the early morning (around 7:30-8:00am in the summer and early fall), I was by no means the only person there, but it was quiet and calm, with just a smattering of photographers with families and couples being photographed with the beautiful morning light.\n\nI was able to enjoy the incredible view of the Eiffel Tower before the sun rose too high above the horizon. The morning glow reflects off of the marble esplanade of the Trocadéro, creating a pretty dreamy scene.\n\nMore from Paris: Get my Paris Guidebook\n\nQuick View\n\nEven when I return to Paris again and again, there’s nothing like a morning walk through a gorgeous Parisian neighborhood.\n\nSound like you? You’ll love my Paris Explorer Guidebook, which is made for people like us who want to slow down and soak in the beautiful neighborhoods of Paris on foot.\n\nGet all the details you need to enjoy seven days exploring some of Paris’ most beautiful neighborhoods.\n\nTrocadero Neighborhood Walk: The Best Streets with Eiffel Tower Views\n\nDescending from the esplanade at the top of the hill, the Jardins du Trocadéro provide beautiful views of the Eiffel Tower as you walk down toward the Seine. I recommend following the hidden walking path to get closer to the Eiffel tower. At the Esplanade du Trocadéro, face the Eiffel Tower. Look toward your right and walk behind the Musée de l'Homme, toward the Jardin d’enfants. This secret pathway is almost always deserted, especially early in the morning.\n\nAt the base of the hill, there is a small raised walkway that seems almost carved out of the hillside which offers a really lovely view of the Eiffel Tower as well.\n\nUse the Monument à de Grasse as a landmark to find this charming walkway, located near the intersection of Avenue des Nations Unies and Rue Le Nôtre.\n\nEiffel Tower View: The Avenue de Camoens\n\nTurn right along Avenue des Nations Unies/Bd Delessert and continue one block to a beautiful staircase with a small monument to Luís Vaz de Camões, a Portuguese poet from the 16th century. You’ve found one end of a street called Avenue de Camoens. Climb the stairs to reach Avenue de Camoens for another gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower, and you can explore a street full of ornate and gorgeous apartments while you’re at it.\n\nEiffel Tower View: The Pont de Bir-Hakeim\n\nTo make your way toward the Eiffel Tower, you’ll need to cross the Seine back to the Left Bank.\n\nI recommend crossing at the Pont de Bir-Hakeim, a bridge that’s been featured in many movies, perhaps most famously in Inception. It is also a popular place with photographers.\n\nThis bridge can be a little busy with two-way traffic and broad bike lanes, but the view of the Seine and Eiffel Tower with the lamps hanging overhead is quite impressive.\n\nWhen you cross the bridge, you’ll want to head left if you are interested in seeing the Eiffel Tower up close - you will reach the Champ de Mars, the vast open area facing the Eiffel Tower, in about a 12 minute walk.\n\nThis walk through the Trocadéro, including a detour to the Avenue de Camoens and across Pont de Bir-Hakeim will take about 30-45 minutes to complete (make sure to add time to capture all of those beautiful photos).\n\nIt is a perfect walk to add on to your Paris travel plans, especially if you were hoping to make a stop at the Eiffel Tower anyway.\n\nPlanning a Trip to Paris?\n\nPick up a free copy of my free One Day in Paris Guidebook to help you plan your trip!\n\nMy Favorite Spot for Breakfast And Coffee Near The Eiffel Tower\n\nNow if you’ve followed along this far, you might be asking yourself where to go for breakfast after such a beautiful early morning walk. I’ve got you covered there too! Walk about 10-15 minutes away from the Eiffel Tower toward O Coffee, one of my favorite coffee spots in Paris.\n\nThe O Coffee flat white\n\nO Coffee Shop in the 15th arrondissement\n\nThis Australian-run café is friendly and very popular with French and expats alike. Don’t miss their flat white and a slice of warm banana bread (with a pat of French butter on top). You’ll be energized and ready for more Paris exploring.\n\nMore Paris Exploring: A Hidden Paris Island Near The Eiffel Tower\n\nThe Ile Aux Cygnes\n\nTo extend your walk a bit, consider a detour while on the Pont de Bir Hakeim to the l’île Aux Cygnes, Paris’ third island.\n\nThis island is much lesser known than the Ile de la Cité and Ile Saint-Louis at the very center of Paris and is quite different from the others as well, being entirely pedestrian.\n\nYou’re likely to see locals exercising and you would almost certainly be the only tourist wandering through this quiet little oasis.\n\nThe island is small, only about half a mile (850 meters) long. Bonus: if you walk to the end, you will a Statue of Liberty!\n\nA Statue of Liberty at the edge of Ile Aux Cygnes\n\nThe Ile aux Cygnes, a hidden Paris island with views of the Eiffel Tower\n\nMake a loop to finish crossing the Pont de Bir-Hakeim, or if you’re headed to O Coffee anyway, ascend at the Pont de Grenelle at the other end of the island and head toward breakfast.\n\nQuick View\n\nThanks for reading, and bon voyage!\n\n~Lauren\n\nPS - The Earful Tower has a fun little “walk show” with a visit to Trocadéro in the early morning - you can see for yourself how empty it is this time of day.\n\nPPS - Want more ideas for planning your visit to Paris?
