Welcome Canadian Travelers!

We are America's Beachiest Beach!

The Myrtle Beach area is the jewel of South Carolina and is nestled along the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States. It's the place where time loses its meaning and cares slip away with the tide. Vacationers wake each morning to the bright yellow sun and drift off each evening to the soft sound of the ocean. Each day is filled with a fun adventure, a new memory, and sun-kissed cheeks. With 100km/60 miles of picturesque beaches and an average year-round temperature of 25° Celsius, luscious green palmetto trees, cloudless skies, and a touch of southern comfort, you'll easily understand what makes this place so amazing and why beachers return to our shores year after year. From beautiful beaches to 90 golf courses, there is plenty of outdoor activities for you to kick back, relax, and enjoy in Myrtle Beach. We have two state parks as well, that boast some of the best bird watching and views in South Carolina, along with warm year-round temperatures, delicious food, and comfortable accommodations. It sounds like you belong back at The Beach!
