B.C. Place’s unusual roof inspired several colourful descriptions when the stadium opened in 1983. Province reporter Steve Berry compared it to a “softly rising souffle”. Others compared it to a giant pillow, and a marshmallow in bondage.

But it became a staple of the Vancouver sports and concert scenes. As Jason Beck of the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame once noted in a speech to the Vancouver Heritage Foundation, “You can make the argument that B.C. Place is the most significant multi-sport, multi-use venue in Canada.”
