        "text": "Social History\n\nRyerson Publishes Report on Education\n\nEgerton Ryerson published his Report on a System of Public Elementary Instruction for Upper Canada. It describes an education system based on Christian faith, universal access and government support. It would be a model for English-speaking Canada. For his contributions to education, Ryerson University in Toronto was named after him. However, his role in the development of the residential school system has led activists to call for the university to be renamed.\n\nPolitics\n\nResponsible Government in Nova Scotia\n\nJames Boyle Uniake became leader of a new Reform government. Nova Scotia was thus the first colony in the British Empire in which responsible government was in effect. Responsible government meant that a colony enjoyed complete self-government in domestic affairs and that a government ruled only with the support of the majority of the elected Assembly (the origins of today's cabinet government).\n\nIndigenous Peoples Military/Rebellions\n\nRed River Resistance\n\nWith 120 men, Louis Riel occupied Upper Fort Garry in the Red River Colony to block the transfer of Rupert’s Land from the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) to Canada. Known as the Red River Resistance, the Métis — led by Riel — and First Nations allies defended the Red River Colony from White settlers and government encroachment on their lands. Louis Riel was hanged for treason, and Cree chiefs Mistahimaskwa (Big Bear) and Pitikwahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker) were imprisoned. Promises to protect the Métis were still unfulfilled more than a decade later, sparking the Northwest Resistance in 1885. In 2019, Poundmaker was exonerated by the federal government.\n\nSocial History\n\nFirst UNIA Chapters Are Established in Canada\n\nIn 1916, the Glace Bay Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), one of the first Canadian divisions of the UNIA, opened in Nova Scotia. This organization was spearheaded by West Indian immigrants who were already familiar with the teachings of Marcus Garvey, founder of the UNIA. After the First World War, West Indians living elsewhere in the country — most notably in Montreal, Toronto and Edmonton — established their own UNIA divisions. For a time, the UNIA was the most important Black socio-economic and educational force in Canada.\n\nPolitics\n\nDominion Elections Act\n\nThe Dominion Elections Act enfranchised many of those who had been disenfranchised during the First World War, such as those originating from countries with which Canada had been at war. However, the Act stated that anyone who was disenfranchised by provincial legislation because of race would remain disenfranchised from the federal vote. This included persons of Chinese origin in Saskatchewan, and those of Indigenous, Chinese, Japanese, and South Asian origins in British Columbia.\n\nArts and Culture\n\nSkylight Caper (Montreal Art Heist)\n\nIn the early morning hours of 4 September 1972, three armed individuals accessed the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts through a skylight and stole 18 paintings, as well as 39 figurines and pieces of jewelry. The so-called Skylight Caper was the most valuable theft in Canadian history. Valued at $2 million in 1972, the artworks were estimated to be worth $20 million in 1992, although a rare Rembrandt landscape alone was estimated to be worth $20 million in 2017.\n\nPolitics\n\nQuébec Referendum\n\nThe first of two Quebec referendums is held. Initiated by the Parti Québécois, it asks Quebec voters whether or not to approve negotiations leading to the province’s sovereignty. The “No” side wins with 60 per cent support. After the failure of two constitutional accords, a second vote in 1995 narrowly approves of the province remaining in Canada, with 50.58 per cent support. In 2006, the federal government recognizes that the Québécois form a “nation” within a united Canada.\n\nSports\n\nFarhan Zaidi Makes History as MLB General Manager\n\nFarhan Zaidi was hired as the general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, making him Major League Baseball’s first Muslim and first South Asian general manager. He also became only the second Muslim executive in MLB and only the sixth general manager from Canada. Born in Sudbury and raised in the Philippines, Zaidi left the Dodgers in 2018 to join the San Francisco Giants. He was named MLB Executive of the Year in 2021 after the Giants finished first overall with 107 wins — the most in franchise history.\n\nScience & Industry\n\nArthur McDonald Wins Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nArthur B. McDonald, a physicist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering that neutrinos — one of the smallest particles of matter — have mass. Neutrinos were previously thought to be massless. He shares the prize with Takaaki Kajita of Japan, whose research broke ground on the same subject. According to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (the organization that awards the Nobel), \"the discovery has changed our understanding of the innermost workings of matter.\"\n\nArts and Culture\n\nThe Tragically Hip’s Final Concert\n\nBeloved Canadian rockers The Tragically Hip played their final show to a hometown crowd at the K-Rock Centre in Kingston, Ontario. It was the last stop on the band’s Man Machine Poem tour, announced in the wake of frontman Gord Downie’s diagnosis of terminal brain cancer in December 2015. More than 11 million people — nearly a third of the Canada’s population — tuned in to the live CBC broadcast on television, radio and online. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the audience members present at the “national celebration,” in which the band played from its 30-year catalogue for nearly three hours. (See also A Place to Happen.)\n\nSocial History\n\nToronto Van Attack Kills 10, 8 of them Women\n\nAt 1:24 p.m., a 25-year-old man who identified as an incel (involuntary celibate), drove a rented van onto the sidewalk on Yonge Street in Toronto’s North York business district. He proceeded to drive south, intentionally running over pedestrians. When he was stopped by police 10 minutes later, 10 people (eight of them women) were dead and 16 were injured. The driver was found guilty of 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder.\n\nPolitics\n\nAndrew Scheer Resigns as CPC Leader\n\nFollowing weeks of speculation and pressure from inside and outside his party, Andrew Scheer announced that he would be stepping down as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. Scheer had been criticized for failing to win the federal election on 21 October 2019 against a Liberal Party that was weakened by scandals, such as the SNC-Lavalin affair and revelations involving Justin Trudeau’s use of blackface. Scheer said he would continue to serve as the party’s leader until a convention is held to elect his successor.\n\nSocial History\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan to “Step Back” from Royal Duties\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their plans to transition out of their roles as senior members of the Royal Family. “We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages,” their statement read. Buckingham Palace responded with a statement explaining that “Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage,” and that “these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.”\n\nSocial History\n\nNova Scotia Attacks\n\nBeginning at his home in Portapique, Nova Scotia, a man wearing an RCMP uniform and driving a replica police cruiser went on a 13-hour rampage that left 22 people dead and six injured. It was the worst mass killing in modern Canadian history. Concerns were later raised regarding the RCMP’s response to the events and its handling of the manhunt. The federal and Nova Scotia governments later launched a public inquiry into the events.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nJoyce Echaquan Livestreams Hospital Staff’s Refusal to Treat Her before She Dies\n\nAt a hospital in Joliette, Quebec, Joyce Echaquan, a 37-year-old Atikamekw woman and a mother of seven, died shortly after she livestreamed a nurse and an orderly refusing to tend to her as they made racist, derogatory comments about her. On 5 October, coroner Gehane Kamel reported that hospital staff failed to properly assess the heart palpitations Echaquan was experiencing and instead assumed she was suffering from opioid withdrawal. When Echaquan became distressed and agitated, hospital staff called her “theatrical” and strapped her to a bed. Kamel called the incident an “undeniable” example of systemic racism. A lawyer for Echaquan’s family planned to file a human rights complaint and a civil suit against the hospital.\n\nSocial History\n\nDoug Ford Apologizes for Widely Criticized Measures\n\nOntario premier Doug Ford apologized for measures his government had introduced a week earlier. Many of the new rules, including closing all playgrounds and empowering police to detain people out in public during a stay-at-home order, were criticized as “draconian.” On 26 April, three armed forces medical teams were sent to Toronto to assist health care workers, while hospitals worried about possibly having to start triaging patients.\n\nSocial History\n\nOntario Pauses Use of AstraZeneca Vaccine\n\nOntario announced that it would be pausing the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to concerns over a rare but potentially fatal blood clotting disorder caused by the vaccine. As of 8 May, more than 900,000 shots of the vaccine had been given in the province. There had been eight cases of the disorder in Ontario and at least four more in the rest of the country. Three people had died.\n\nSocial History\n\nMaple Leafs and Canadiens Faceoff in First Playoff Series Since 1979\n\nArch rivals Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens began the first playoff series against each other since 1979. The higher-seeded Maple Leafs took a commanding 3–1 lead in the series before the Canadiens won two games in overtime to force a Game 7, which they won 3–1 en route to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in almost 30 years.\n\nIndigenous Peoples Social History\n\n200 Possible Unmarked Graves Found on Grounds of Kamloops Residential School\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nGround disturbances indicating 200 possible unmarked graves were found using ground penetrating radar on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School — at one time the largest residential school in the country. Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk’emlups te Secwepemc First Nation called the finding an “unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented.”\n\nSocial History\n\nJustin Trudeau Apologizes for Internment of Italian Canadians\n\nIn a speech in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for the federal government’s internment of Italian Canadians during the Second World War. Around 600 Italian Canadians suspected of sympathizing with fascism were placed in internment camps during the war, while 31,000 Italian Canadians were registered as enemy aliens and were forced to report to officials once a month.\n\nSocial History\n\nMuslim Family Killed in Hit-and-Run Hate Crime\n\nTwo parents, a grandparent and a daughter were killed and a nine-year-old son was left in serious condition after the family was struck by a pickup truck while walking along the sidewalk in London, Ontario. Police confirmed that the attack was “a planned, premeditated act and that the family was targeted because of their Muslim faith.” (See also Islamophobia in Canada.) A vigil was held in London two days later. The accused was charged with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. He was also charged with terrorism under section 83 of the Criminal Code. The nine-year-old orphaned boy was released to relatives a week later.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nHundreds of Possible Unmarked Graves Found at Saskatchewan Residential School\n\nOne month after the discovery of 200 possible unmarked graves at a former residential school in Kamloops, BC, ground-penetrating radar revealed an estimated 751 possible unmarked graves at the site of the former Marieval Indian Residential School in Cowessess First Nation territory, about 150 km east of Regina. The radar search began on 1 June. The Marieval school was open from 1899 to 1997 and was administered by the Catholic Church until 1968.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nThousands Attend “Cancel Canada Day” Rally in Ottawa\n\nThe annual Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill were replaced this year by a “Cancel Canada Day” rally organized by Idle No More and the Anishinaabe nation. Thousands of people, many of them wearing orange shirts, marched from the offices of Indigenous Services Canada in Gatineau to Parliament Hill, where they gathered to “honour all of the lives lost to the Canadian state.” Flags on Parliament Hill flew at half-mast in honour of the hundreds of dead children that had been found on the sites of former residential schools weeks earlier.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\n160+ Possible Unmarked Graves Found at Another BC Residential School\n\nPenelakut Tribe Chief Joan Brown said in a statement that more than 160 “undocumented and unmarked” graves had been found on Penelakut Island, formerly Kuper Island, off the coast of Vancouver Island southeast of Nanaimo. The possible graves were found at the site of the Kuper Island Industrial School, a residential school run by the Catholic Church from 1890 to 1969 and by the federal government from 1969 until 1975.\n\nSports\n\nJessica Klimkait Becomes First Canadian Woman to Win Olympic Judo Medal\n\nAt the 2020 Olympic Summer Games in Tokyo, Jessica Klimkait became the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic medal in judo, winning bronze in the women’s 57 kg division. Earlier in 2021, Klimkait became the second Canadian judoka, after Christa Deguchi, to win gold at the World Judo Championships. Klimkait was one of two Canadian women to medal in judo at the Tokyo Olympics. Catherine Beauchemin-Pinard won the bronze medal in the women’s 63 kg class on 27 July 2021.\n\nSports\n\nCanada Wins Olympic Gold in Women’s Soccer\n\nAfter setting a goal to “change the colour” of the Olympic bronze medal it won in Rio in 2016, the Canadian women’s soccer team defeated Sweden to win Canada’s first Olympic gold medal in soccer. With the game tied 1–1 after regulation time, Julia Grosso scored the winning goal in the sixth round of penalty kicks. Midfielder Quinn became the first non-binary person to win an Olympic medal. (See also Canada at the 2020 Olympic Summer Games.)\n\nSocial History\n\nMichael Spavor Sentenced to 11 Years in Prison in China\n\nMichael Spavor, who had been detained in China on espionage charges since December 2018 following Canada’s detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a Chinese court. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement calling the verdict “absolutely unacceptable and unjust… For Mr. Spavor, as well as for Michael Kovrig who has also been arbitrarily detained, our top priority remains securing their immediate release. We will continue working around the clock to bring them home as soon as possible.”\n\nMilitary/Rebellions\n\nCanada Evacuates 3,700 People from Afghanistan\n\nThe Canadian military completed its evacuation of Afghanistan. 3,700 people — a combination of Canadian citizens, foreign nationals and Afghan refugees — were taken out of the country since 4 August. This followed the rapid deterioration of the country and the rise of the Taliban after US military began to withdraw from the war-torn country in July after a 20-year occupation. The US military completed its withdrawal on 30 August. (See also Afghan Canadians; Canada and the War in Afghanistan.)\n\nSocial History\n\nMore Than 1,000 Deaths from Drug Toxicity in BC So Far This Year\n\nFive years since being declared a public health emergency by the BC government, the opioid crisis in the province showed no signs of relenting. A report from the BC Coroners Service found that in February 2021, BC’s illicit drug toxicity death rate was an average of 5.5 deaths per day and the number of deaths per 100,000 people due to illicit drug toxicity was the highest since 1995.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrudeau and Liberals Win Third Term, Second Consecutive Minority\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe 36-day election campaign that began on 15 August finished in much the same way as the previous federal election in 2019 — with similar seat counts for all parties and a Liberal minority government. Erin O’Toole and the Conservatives had been in a statistical dead heat with the Liberals in late August and went on to narrowly win the popular vote for the second consecutive election. However, the bad press generated by an unfolding health crisis in Alberta under conservative premier Jason Kenney combined with the successful efforts of Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada to eat into the Conservatives’ vote share tipped the scales toward a Liberal victory. Following the election, many questioned the efficacy of spending more than $600 million on an election that replicated the status quo.\n\nSocial History\n\nThe “Two Michaels” Are Released from China\n\nMichael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, two Canadians who were detained in China on espionage charges on 10 December 2018 in retaliation for the detention of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver earlier that month, were released by Chinese authorities. They returned to Canada on 25 September. Their release came one day after a court in BC dropped the case seeking to extradite Meng to the US over wire fraud and conspiracy charges. The two Michaels had spent more than 1,020 days imprisoned in China.\n\nSocial History\n\nAnnamie Paul Resigns as Green Party Leader\n\nAfter becoming the first Black Canadian and the first Jewish woman to lead a major federal political party in Canada when she was elected Green Party leader in October 2020, Annamie Paul lost a by-election for Toronto Centre later that month. She began to lose support within her party in summer 2021 over her muted position on the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Severe infighting within the party led to an attempt to remove Paul as leader and revoke her party membership. Paul persevered, but in the election on 20 September she lost her third bid for the Toronto Centre seat. The Green Party’s share of the national popular vote fell from 6.5 per cent in the 2019 election to only 2.3 per cent. Paul resigned as Green Party leader and called her time in the role “the worst period” in her life.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nFirst National Day for Truth and Reconciliation\n\nCanada recognized the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation as an annual statutory holiday. The creation of the holiday was one of 94 recommendations in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s final report, which was published in June 2015. The holiday was officially created with the passage of Bill C-5 on 3 June 2021, less than two weeks after the confirmation of 215 unmarked children’s graves at the site of a former residential school near Kamloops, BC. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made headlines on the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation after he spent the day on vacation in Tofino, BC, rather than participate in any official events.\n\nEnvironment\n\nState of Emergency Declared in Iqaluit Due to Tainted Water Supply\n\nTwo days after discovering petroleum hydrocarbons in Iqaluit’s water supply, the Government of Nunavut declared a state of emergency in the city. (See also Water Treatment; Water Pollution.) The first of at least five shipments of potable water arrived in Iaqluit by airplane. The water was distributed in rations of 16 litres per household. Officials believed the contamination was caused by the effects of melting permafrost on underground pipes.\n\nSocial History\n\nCanada to Spend a Record $308 Billion on Health Care in 2021\n\nA report issued by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) concluded that Canada would spend $308 billion on health care in 2021, due to the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CIHI said that the rate of health care spending was the highest in more than 30 years. The expenditure was expected to equal more than 12 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021.\n\nEnvironment\n\n“Worst Weather Storm in a Century” Causes Floods, Wipes Out Highways and Kills Five in BC\n\nA “significant atmospheric river” inundated the Lower Mainland and the southern interior of BC with a month’s worth of rain in less than 48 hours. Many communities recorded more than 100 mm of rain; the town of Hope had the most with 252 mm. A landscape scarred by forest fires and other effects of climate change resulted in severe mudslides and floods in 17 regional districts. Five people were killed in a mudslide on Highway 99 north of Pemberton, and hundreds of people in the province were evacuated by helicopter after they were stranded by mudslides on highways and roads. Stretches of the Coquihalla Highway and the Trans-Canada Highway were badly damaged or destroyed. The town of Merritt was flooded, forcing more than 7,000 residents to evacuate. The Sumas Prairie, an agricultural area between Abbotsford and Chilliwack that had once been a lake, was flooded, causing hundreds of millions in damages. The storm, which came four and a half months after a heat wave that killed almost 600 people in BC, also took a deadly toll on the region’s livestock. An estimated 628,000 poultry, 12,000 hogs and 420 dairy cows were killed and 110 beehives were destroyed.\n\nSocial History\n\nHealth Canada Approves COVID-19 Vaccines for Children Aged 5–11\n\nHealth Canada approved the COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5–11. The federal government was expecting a delivery of 2.9 million pediatric doses, enough to give a first shot to every Canadian in that age group. Provincial governments noted that they were ready to begin administering the shots as soon as the vaccines were delivered.\n\nSocial History\n\nFederal Government Tables Bill to Ban Conversion Therapy\n\nAfter promising to reintroduce legislation banning conversion therapy in Canada within the first 100 days of its new mandate, the minority Liberal government of Justin Trudeau tabled Bill C-4. It included a broader definition of what constituted conversion therapy — also known as the ex-gay movement — as well as the addition of four new offenses to the Criminal Code. If passed, the legislation would make it illegal to force anyone to undergo conversion therapy, punishable by up to five years in prison. It would also allow courts to order the seizure or removal of conversion therapy advertisements.\n\nSports\n\nDecathlete Damian Warner Wins Lou Marsh Trophy\n\nDamian Warner received the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada’s athlete of the year, in recognition of his gold medal victory in decathlon at the 2020 Olympic Summer Games in Tokyo. Warner set an Olympic record with 9,018 total points and became one of only four decathletes to reach 9,000 points in international competition. He also received the 2021 Lionel Conacher Award as Canada’s male athlete of the year and was inducted into Canada’s Walk of Fame as part of the class of 2021. Meanwhile, calls grew to rename the Lou Marsh Trophy, due to Marsh’s long, documented history of racism, anti-Semitism and discrimination.\n\nSocial History\n\nFood Prices to Increase 5–7 Per Cent, Study Finds\n\nCanada’s Food Price Report, compiled by researchers at several Canadian universities, predicted that food prices in Canada would increase by 5–7 per cent in 2022. The report also projected that prices at restaurants would rise by 6–8 per cent and that the average family of four would spend up to $14,767 on food.\n\nIndigenous Peoples Social History\n\nChildren Who Didn’t Come Home from Residential Schools Named Canadian Press Newsmaker of the Year\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe Canadian Press named “children who didn’t come home from residential schools” as Canada’s Newsmaker of the Year. More than 1,000 unmarked graves on the sites of former residential schools across Western Canada had been confirmed since the first findings at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School were made public on 27 May.\n\nScience & Industry\n\nInflation Indicator at 18-Year High\n\nStatistics Canada announced that Canada’s inflation rate in November was 4.7 per cent. This was the second month in a row that the inflation rate was the highest since 2003. The increase was consistent with a global trend. The United States, for example, had an inflation rate of 6.8 per cent — the highest in almost 40 years.\n\nSports\n\nBoston Bruins Retire Willie O’Ree’s No. 22\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nWillie O’Ree, who became the NHL’s first Black hockey player when he took to the ice with the Boston Bruins on 18 January 1958, became the 12th player in franchise history to have his number retired. O’Ree’s No. 22 was raised to the rafters before a home game at TD Garden on the 64th anniversary of his first NHL game.\n\nSocial History\n\nNearly 60 Per Cent of Families Struggling to Buy Food, Poll Finds\n\nA poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute found that 57 per cent of Canadians had struggled recently to feed their families — an increase from 36 per cent in 2019, the last time a similar poll was conducted. Supply chain issues sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic had led to an inflation rate of 5.1 per cent — the highest in 30 years. Labour and product shortages were also wreaking havoc on the business of grocery stores, which observers said could further threaten food security.\n\nSocial History\n\nPandemic Lockdowns Have Led to Increase in Intimate Partner Violence, Experts Say\n\nExperts on intimate partner violence released a study, which found that pandemic-related public health restrictions were giving abusers “circumstances to increase their capacity to control and to manipulate.” The study also argued that previously non-violent people were becoming increasingly abusive due to the stress and tension brought about by the pandemic. There was a massive increase in phone calls to support groups and help lines, with one Toronto-based organization reporting a 9,000 per cent increase from pre-pandemic levels.\n\nPolitics Social History\n\n“Freedom Convoy” Arrives in Ottawa and Begins Occupation of Capital\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nConvoys of truckers, which had been making their way to Ottawa from Western and Eastern Canada, finally arrived in Canada’s capital to protest public health mandates and restrictions. The convoys were cheered by supporters across the country, many of whom greeted them along highway overpasses. However, the protest’s stated goal of unseating Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and overthrowing the government left many Canadians uneasy and brought to mind the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 — as did the presence of Confederate and Nazi flags among the protesters. With 85 per cent of Canadians vaccinated, including about 90 per cent of all truckers, the protest was seen as a far-right fringe movement. Observers noted that online rhetoric surrounding the protest had grown “increasingly worrisome.” Similar Freedom Convoy protests formed blockades at a border crossing in Coutts, Alberta, and at the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan, on 29 January and 7 February, respectively.\n\nPolitics Social History\n\nDeath of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died at age 96 at Balmoral Castle in Scotland with the Royal Family by her side. They had gathered there earlier that day after doctors had expressed concern for her health and put her under medical supervision. Having occupied the throne for 70 years and 214 days, Elizabeth was Britain’s longest-reigning monarch and the second-longest reigning monarch in recorded history. She was Queen of Canada for almost half of the country’s existence. Upon her death, Charles automatically ascended to the role of king. He became the 62nd British monarch and, at age 73, the oldest ever to assume the throne."
