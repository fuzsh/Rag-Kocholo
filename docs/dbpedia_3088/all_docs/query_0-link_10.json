        "text": "DENVER – August 6, 2024 – Frontier Airlines wants to make one lucky winner a “Miles Millionaire!” The ultra-low fare carrier (NASDAQ: ULCC) will award 1 million FRONTIER Miles, enough for as many as one hundred flights on America’s Greenest Airline through a random drawing. The “Who Wants to Be a Miles Millionaire” sweepstakes launches today, and entries will be accepted through 11:59pm Mountain time on Thursday, August 8, 2024.\n\n“We can’t wait to make a lucky winner’s travel dreams come true by instantly making them a ‘Miles Millionaire,’” said Tyri Squyres, vice president of marketing, Frontier Airlines. “These miles can be used on flights to destinations across the country, the Caribbean, and beyond, and will mean countless memories for our lucky winner and the people close to them!”\n\nEntrants must have a FRONTIER Miles account and membership number to participate. FRONTIER Miles is free to join, and new members are able to enter the sweepstakes immediately after joining. For full rules and to enter to win, visit the “Who Wants to Be a Miles Millionaire” sweepstakes landing page.\n\nTo ensure every participant feels like a “Miles Millionaire,” Frontier is also launching a limited-time promotion with 2 million seats on sale, at fares as low as $19*. Travel must be booked by 11:59pm Eastern time to qualify for the promotion. Eligible routes can be found here.\n\nFrontier Airlines has introduced sweeping changes to its product and customer service offerings, ushering in ‘The New Frontier’ for the airline. Underscoring its commitment to providing exceptional value and a superior travel experience, ‘The New Frontier’ provides more transparency through upfront pricing and options to meet various customers’ needs and budgets. Through no change or cancellation fees, a ‘For Less’ Price Guarantee, longer flight credit windows and more, America’s Greenest Airline is improving what customers can expect and delivering the best price for their travel needs.\n\nFrontier now offers UpFront Plus, a new upgraded seating option with extra leg and elbow room in the first two rows of the aircraft. Customers in UpFront Plus will enjoy a window or aisle seat with extra legroom and a guaranteed empty middle seat.\n\nThe airline’s reimagined, industry-leading frequent flyer program, FRONTIER Miles, enables consumers to ‘Get It All For Less.’ Customers earn miles fast and get rewarded for each dollar spent on Frontier products. Miles accrue based on dollars spent with a standard 10X multiplier: $1 = 10 miles. Mileage multipliers increase at every elite level up to 20X. Elite status enables members to enjoy benefits like priority boarding, free seat selection, no change or cancel fees when changes are made seven days or more in advance of flight departure, and free bag(s) at Gold, Diamond, and Platinum levels. Like the airline, FRONTIER Miles is family friendly, and the program makes it easy for families to enjoy the rewards together, including family pooling of miles. Joining is free.\n\n*About the Promotional Fare Offer:\n\nFares must be purchased by 11:59 pm Eastern time on Aug. 8, 2024.
