        "text": "1966\n\nThe Rodeo builds the Livestock Exposition Building (Astrohall).\n\n1968\n\nThe 12-acre facility is expanded by four acres, providing more exhibit space and meeting rooms.\n\n1973\n\nTwo additional acres are added to the Astrohall, resulting in permanent administrative offices, meeting rooms, exhibit space and the Super Sale Salon (site of auctions and sales until 1991).\n\n1975\n\nThe 6,000-seat Astroarena is completed.\n\n1980\n\nMore space is added to both the east and west ends of the Astrohall.\n\n1983\n\nThe Rodeo adds acreage to the Astroarena in a partially funded project by the Houston Sports Association and Harris County. This phase represents the first time that the Rodeo does not totally fund construction of exhibition facilities.\n\n1991\n\nAn additional 4.8 acres in the Astroarena results in committee volunteer meeting rooms, a club, a restaurant, auction arenas and additional space for commercial exhibits. Harris County shares the cost of this additional construction.\n\n1995\n\nConstruction of a 40,920-square-foot warehouse addition is completed and donated to the citizens of Harris County. (stores the Rodeo’s entertainment stage, houses rodeo contestants’ horses, provides a warm-up arena for rodeo contestants and serves as additional storage during the year).\n\n1996\n\nThe Rodeo celebrates 30 years at the Astrodome complex.\n\n1999\n\nThe Harris County Commissioners Court approves the construction of a new exhibition facility on the north side of the Astrodome.\n\nHarris County begins construction of new parking lots on the west side of Kirby Drive.\n\nHouston becomes the home of the new NFL franchise, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo moves forward with Houston NFL Holdings and Harris County to build a new football/rodeo stadium.\n\n2000\n\nGroundbreaking ceremonies are held in March for the new 70,000 seat, retractable roof RODEOHOUSTON/NFL stadium.\n\nIn June, groundbreaking ceremonies celebrate the beginning of construction for the 1.3-million-square-foot Harris County Exposition Center.\n\nIn October, NRG acquires naming rights for the Astrodome Complex. The renamed NRG Park includes NRG Astrodome, NRG Arena, NRG Hall, NRG Center and NRG Stadium.\n\n2002\n\nHouston Livestock Show and Rodeo personnel move into new Rodeo offices on the second floor of the new NRG Center.\n\nAstro Hall is demolished and the site paved for parking.\n\nNRG Stadium opens with the first Houston Texans pre-season NFL football game on Aug. 24.\n\n2003\n\nThe 71st Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo celebrates its first year in its new homes: NRG Stadium and NRG Center.\n\nCarruth Plaza is completed at NRG Park, creating a Western sculpture garden that is home to eight large-scale bronzes.\n\n2012\n\nOn Dec. 27, 2012, the Rodeo purchased 48 acres of land out of a 92-acre tract commonly referred to as the Astroworld property."
