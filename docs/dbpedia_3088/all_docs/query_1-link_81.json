        "text": "One of America's first megachurches is no more, marking the end of an era and the beginning of a new one — if developers determine that they can use the land.\n\nEd Matzules, senior vice president of Canada-based Colliers International Group Inc., is handling the sale of the 29-acre property. Via email, he said, \"Currently we are under contract for a mixed use housing development.\" He said that could include single-family homes, townhomes or other configurations.\n\n\"The mix of housing units may change depending on the due diligence, zoning, financial viability, etc.,\" Matzules wrote. \"They are putting a plan together of different types of housing. It all depends on how many units they can build to make the project viable.\"\n\n\"After all the soil tests are completed, they can determine how many housing units they can build,\" he said. \"They are also working with the city to coordinate the project to make sure it is compatible with what the city prefers.\"\n\nThere's the chance, however, that the soil conditions make the project infeasible, thus requiring alterations — a possibility, Matzules said, with any property.\n\nThe Word Church still owns the site. It has put the land up for sale for $2,465,000 — $1,435,000 less than the $3.9 million price tag that it put on the property in June 2019.\n\nCity spokeswoman Stephanie Marsh said that the city expects \"to have conversations with any property owner and community stakeholders about potential future uses.\"\n\nHistory of the Akron Baptist Temple\n\nThe first iteration of the Akron Baptist Temple was built in 1937 for $60,000 near Rimer Elementary School, where the congregation began meeting. By 1949, the original building was too small to house its congregation, so a new one was built.\n\nAkron Baptist Temple's founder Dallas F. Billington was a pioneer in televangelism, taking his sermons to the radio in the 1940s and 1950s. By the 1960s, it appeared on more than 30 TV stations.\n\nIn 1981, the 4,000-seat main sanctuary burned to the ground. Fire investigators suspected but couldn't prove arson. It was rebuilt in 1983.\n\nAkron Baptist Temple sold the church and its 29 acres in June 2018 for $1.5 million to The Word Church. Overextended and underattended, The Word put a $3.9 million for-sale sign on the location up in June 2019.\n\nIn February, Akron Mayor Shammas Malik announced the church would be demolished because of the hazard it poses to public safety.\n\nThe city, he said, would aggressively pursue repayment of the $1.24 million it budgeted for demolition costs from The Word Church, and that the city could offset the cost with up to $700,000 in state funds through the Summit County Land Bank.\n\nDemolition began March 19.\n\nMalik said that the Akron Baptist Temple was a cornerstone of the city's faith community and a historically significant structure. The last few years, however, it has become \"a significant blight on this community in this neighborhood,\" Malik said.\n\nAll that remains to memorialize the 236,000-square-foot building — first the Akron Baptist Temple, then The Word Church — are some piles of rubble and the memories of those who attended. Among the ruins stand the machinery used to tear it down.\n\nContact reporter Derek Kreider at DKreider@Gannett.com or 330-541-9413"
