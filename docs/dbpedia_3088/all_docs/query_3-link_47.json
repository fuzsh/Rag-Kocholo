        "text": "NOAA is responsible for depicting on its nautical charts the limits of the 12 nautical mile territorial sea, 24 nautical mile contiguous zone, and 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). These zones are in orange.\n\nTerritorial Sea\n\nThe territorial sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty. Sovereignty extends to the airspace above and to the seabed below the territorial sea. The U.S. territorial sea extends 12 nautical miles from the baseline.\n\nContiguous Zone\n\nThe contiguous zone of the United States is a zone contiguous to the territorial sea. In this zone, the U.S. may exercise the control necessary to prevent and punish infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration, cultural heritage, or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea. The U.S. contiguous zone is measured 24 nautical miles from the baseline.\n\nExclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)\n\nThe exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the U.S. extends 200 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline and is adjacent to the 12 nm territorial sea of the U.S., overlapping the 12-24nm contiguous zone. Within the EEZ, the U.S. has:\n\nsovereign rights for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing natural resources, whether living and nonliving, of the seabed and subsoil and the superjacent waters and with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents and winds\n\njurisdiction as provided for in international and domestic laws with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations, and structures, marine scientific research, and the protection and preservation of the marine environment\n\nother rights and duties provided for under international and domestic laws\n\n(See Presidential Proclamation No. 5030, March 10, 1983.)\n\nCertain U.S. fisheries laws use the term “exclusive economic zone” (“EEZ”). While its outer limit is the same as the EEZ on NOAA charts, the inner limit generally extends landward to the seaward boundary of the coastal states of the U.S. For the seaward limit of the states jurisdiction under the Submerged Lands Act, please see GIS Data / Shapefiles.\n\nMaritime Boundaries\n\nMaritime boundaries with adjacent and opposite countries are established through agreement and treaties with these neighboring nations.\n\nWhere can I find electronic data of state territorial waters at 3 nautical miles (or 9 nautical miles off of Texas, Puerto Rico, and the west coast of Florida)?\n\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages and disseminates the Submerged Lands Act federal/state boundaries. The data can be found under \"GIS Data / Shapefiles\". The Gulf of Mexico dataset is available at \"GOMR Geographic Information System (GIS) Data and Maps\".\n\nHow are the U.S. maritime limits drawn?\n\nThe U.S. maritime limits are projected from a \"normal baseline\" derived from NOAA nautical charts. A \"normal baseline\" (as defined in the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone and Article 5 of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea) is the low-water line along the coast as marked on official, large-scale charts. Since \"low-water line\" does not reference a specific tidal datum, the U.S. applies the term to reference the lowest charted datum, which is mean lower low water (MLLW).\n\nThe maritime limits are created using \"envelope of arcs,\" a method by which one rolls a virtual circle along the charted low water line and selects salient points. These salient points are called \"contributing baseline points.\" Arcs generated from these baseline points are blended together to form a continuous limit line or envelope of arcs.\n\nThe U.S. Baseline Committee reviews and approves the limits of all maritime zones on NOAA charts. It gains interagency consensus on the proper location of the baseline, using the provisions of the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to ensure that the seaward extents of U.S. maritime zones do not exceed the breadth permitted by international law. Current members of the Committee include the Departments of State (Chair), Commerce (NOAA), Justice, Interior (BOEM), and Homeland Security (Coast Guard), among others.\n\nWhat initiates updates to the digital U.S. maritime limits and boundaries?\n\nThe primary triggers for updates include accretion or erosion of the charted low water line by approximately 500 meters or more, or changes to low tide elevations (i.e., rocks awash) as a result of new hydrographic survey information. The Office of Coast Survey and the Baseline Committee will investigate these changes for new edition chart. There are approximately 12 new editions issued each month, and a small number of these charts depict features that impact the U.S. baseline or maritime limits. The Baseline Committee, which meets four to six times per year, reviews and approved all proposed revisions.\n\nAnother trigger for change may be the U.S. ratification of a new treaty with a neighboring coastal State. Some areas for future change include the U.S. waters adjacent to Canada, the Bahamas, Kiribati, Tonga, and the Federated States of Micronesia, to name a few.\n\nHow often are digital U.S. Maritime Limits and Boundaries updated?\n\nDepending on the level of change (see Weekly Chart Updates), the Office of Coast Survey may update the digital U.S. maritime limits and boundaries as often as every few months in certain areas. Though we provide both dyanmic and static datasets, we recommend using our dynamic data services to ensure the most up-to-date version of the U.S. maritime limits and boundaries. We provide an archive of past update annoucements (above) to explain what has changed in each release of the data.\n\nHow do I use dynamic web mapping services?\n\nWe offer dynamic data is two formats: OpenGIS® Web Map Service (WMS) and proprietary ESRI REST service.\n\nThe WMS can be used in various desktop GIS software as well as web mapping applications. The link leads to the GetCapabilities page, which provides easy-to-read, detailed information about the data as well as the necessary link to load the data into a GIS or web mapping application. Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provides more information about web mapping services.\n\nFor users who prefer to work within the ESRI software environment, we provide an ESRI REST (Representational State Transfer) service. This service can be used in ESRI’s ArcGIS Desktop software or in ESRI’s free ArcGIS Explorer Desktop. It can also be added as a layer in web mapping services, such as ArcGIS Online.\n\nWhat information is provided with the dataset?\n\nThe dataset includes specific information about each maritime boundary segment. Attributes for the data are:\n\nBoundary ID: a unique identifier of the boundary segment\n\nRegion Name: region in which the boundary is located\n\nType of Feature: features can either be a land boundary (between the U.S. and Canada), a maritime limit, or a maritime boundary between the U.S. and an adjacent or opposite country.\n\nPublication Date: date the digital boundary was published online\n\nApproval Date: date the U.S. Baseline Committee approved the updates\n\nLegal Authority: treaty, agreement, or proclamation granting the government authority to establish the limit or boundary\n\nAgency of Responsibility: federal agency responsible for maintaining the digital data\n\nNote: additional notes about the limit/boundary\n\nSupplemental Information Document: link to metadata about the specific boundary segment. The document supplements the parent metadata record.\n\nUnilateral Claim: some maritime boundary claims have not been agreed upon by all parties. These boundaries are designated as unilateral claims.\n\nDescription: specific category of maritime limit/boundary.\n\nWhy is the digital product different from the product printed on the chart?\n\nBecause of a difference in the chart printing schedule and the digital data update schedule, the digital data and the paper charts might not always be identical. In the event that the digital product and the paper charts differ, the maritime limits and boundaries on the paper charts take precedence.\n\nWe find that most people who seek this line are actually looking for the Submerged Lands Act federal/state boundary provided by BOEM (see FAQ #1)."
