        "text": "Nationally and internationally, the annual AAAL conference has a reputation as one of the most comprehensive and exciting language conferences! At each conference new ideas are generated, disciplinary boundaries are crossed, and research is shared about the role of language in all aspects of cognition and social action, including language learning and teaching.\n\nThe AAAL conference is known for its in-depth symposia and focused workshops on key issues in applied linguistics; sessions on a wide range of research studies, in progress or completed; its stimulating and often provocative plenaries; and access to the latest publications via the book exhibit. Last but not least, the AAAL conference is the place for networking, for established and new professionals, and for graduate students.\n\nUpcoming Conferences\n\n2025: Denver, Colorado / Sheraton Denver Downtown / March 22-25\n\n2026: Chicago, Illinois / Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk / March 21-23\n\nPast Conferences\n\n2024: Houston, Texas - Thinking Otherwise, Acting for Change\n\nConference Dates: March 16-19\n\nPDF PROGRAM SEARCHABLE SCHEDULE AWARDEES\n\n2023: Portland, Oregon - Collaborating and Mentoring in Applied Linguistics\n\nConference Dates: March 18-21\n\nPDF PROGRAM SEARCHABLE SCHEDULE AWARDEES PHOTO ALBUM\n\nPDF CONFERENCE INFOGRAPHIC\n\n2022: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - Applied Linguistics in Times of Reckoning and Change\n\nConference Dates: March 19-22\n\nPDF Program Searchable Schedule Awardees Photo Album\n\nProgram Archives\n\n* Note: To submit your photos for inclusion in the AAAL 2022 album, click here.\n\n2021: Virtual\n\nConference Dates: March 20-23\n\nSchedule of Events Searchable Schedule Awards Presentation\n\n2020: Denver, Colorado - Looking Back, Moving Ahead (In-Person Conference Cancelled Due to COVID-19)\n\nConference Dates: March 28-31\n\nSearchable Schedule\n\n2019: Atlanta, Georgia\n\nConference Dates: March 9-12\n\npdf Program Searchable Schedule\n\n2018: Chicago, Illinois\n\nConference Dates: March 24-27\n\npdf Program Searchable Schedule\n\n2017: Portland, Oregon - Transdisciplinarity\n\nConference Dates: March 18-21\n\nPdf Program Searchable Schedule\n\n2016: Orlando, Florida - Applied Linguistics Applied\n\nConference Dates: April 9-12\n\nPdf Program Searchable Schedule Abstract Summaries\n\n2015: Toronto, Ontario - Iden-tit√©(s)\n\nConference Dates: March 21-24\n\npdf program Searchable Schedule\n\n2014 Portland, Oregon - Change\n\nConference Dates: March 22-25\n\npdf program Searchable Schedule\n\n2013 Dallas, Texas March 16-19 pdf program\n\n2012 Boston, Massachusetts March 24-27 - Interdisciplinarity pdf program\n\n2011 Chicago, Illinois March 26-29 pdf program\n\n2010 Atlanta, Georgia March 6-9 pdf program\n\n2009 Denver, Colorado March 21-24 - The Relevance of Applied Linguistic pdf program\n\n2008 Washington, DC March 29 - April 2 - The Relevance of Applied Linguistic pdf program\n\n2007 Costa Mesa, California April 21-24 - Spanish in the US pdf program\n\n2006 Montreal, QC, Canada June 17-20 pdf program\n\n2005 Madison, Wisconsin (AILA 2005 Host) July 24-29 - The Future is Now -pdf program, part 1, part 2\n\n2004 Portland, Oregon May 1-4 pdf program\n\n2003 Arlington, Virginia March 22-25 pdf program\n\n2002 Salt Lake City, Utah April 6-9 - (Re)interpreting Applied Linguistics pdf program\n\n2001 St. Louis, Missouri February 24-27 - Applied Linguistics for the 21st Century pdf program\n\n2000 Vancouver, British Columbia March 11-14 - Crossing Boundaries pdf program\n\n1999 Stamford, Connecticut March 6-9 pdf program\n\n1998 Seattle, Washington March 14-17 pdf program\n\n1997 Orlando, Florida March 8-11\n\n1996 Chicago, Illinois March 23-26\n\n1995 Long Beach, California March 25-28\n\n1994 Baltimore, Maryland March 5-8\n\n1993 Atlanta, Georgia April 16-19\n\n1992 Seattle, Washington February 28-March 2\n\n1991 New York, New York March 22-24\n\nNOTE: Before 1990, the AAAL met jointly with the Linguistic Society of America (LSA)."
