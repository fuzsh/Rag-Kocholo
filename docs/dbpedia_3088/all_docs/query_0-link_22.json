        "text": "President Reagan, denouncing Soviet Communism as ''the focus of evil in the modern world,'' today warned Protestant church leaders not to treat the arms race ''as a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong, good and evil.''\n\nAppearing before a convention of evangelical Christians, the President delivered one of the most forceful speeches of his Administration on the subjects of theology and war, morality and government.\n\nIn what White House aides privately said was something of a rebuttal to recent criticism of Administration policy by church officials, notably the Roman Catholic hierarchy, Mr. Reagan delighted his audience by declaring:\n\n''In your discussion of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride - the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire.'' 'Very Dangerous Fraud'\n\nIn an addition to his prepared text, the President used some of his strongest language in again rejecting as ''a very dangerous fraud'' calls for a nuclear freeze without additional Soviet arms reductions.\n\n''That is merely the illusion of peace,'' he said. ''The reality is that we must find peace through strength.'' He continued: ''A freeze at current levels of weapons would remove any incentive for the Soviets to negotiate seriously at Geneva and virtually end our chances to achieve the major arms reductions which we have proposed.''\n\nThe speech, to the National Association of Evangelicals, received a standing ovation in the Sheraton convention center as the orchestra played ''Onward Christian Soldiers.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
