        "text": "Denendeh Chiefs at an Indian Brotherhood of the\n\nNorthwest Territories national assembly, circa 1970\n\nIndian Brotherhood of the Northwest Territories\n\nIt was in the summer of 1969 when the federal government presented its “White Paper” to parliament. The policy proposed to dissolve the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and shift the responsibility to the provinces and two territories —in effect, wiping out the government’s constitutional duty to Canada’s First Nations; the paper was an insult.\n\nOn October 3, 1969 sixteen chiefs came together to form the Indian Brotherhood of the Northwest Territories. Its first president was Morris Lafferty of Fort Simpson with Mona Jacobs of Fort Smith, NT succeeding him. Her role as interim president of the organization was to work under the mandate of protecting the rights and interests of the Dene under treaty.\n\nWhen the Indian Brotherhood was formed, the most pressing issue was the building of a proposed pipeline through the Mackenzie Valley to carry natural gas to southern Canadian and U.S. markets. The Dene agreed, at the time, to delay any decision by the federal government on the project by demanding that Dene rights be recognized through a negotiated settlement of land claims. The Dene questioned who had the right to make decisions concerning industrial development of the resources on Dene land, particularly when it comes to having major impact of land and environment.\n\nIn 1970, after serving four months as president, Ms. Jacobs was replaced by Roy Daniels of Behchoko. In 1971, James Wah-shee also of Behchoko became the third president.\n\n1972, without consultation with the band councils, the federal government planned a complete removal of DIAND from the north. As part of the plan, the federal department was negotiating with the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) for the transfer of program responsibility for the treaty Indians. By 1973, the Chiefs in Denendeh made a major breakthrough when DIAND established an office in Yellowknife, it meant recognition of band councils and treaty rights.\n\nThe IB-NWT staff, fieldworkers and researchers had a strong dedication for their work. They learned on-the-job to meet the needs of the communities. Individuals from communities were trained by the organization and they went on to train others in community development, land claims research and communications initiatives – demonstrating that the Dene could do the work for their own people.\n\nThe Indian Brotherhood of the Northwest Territories and the Metis Association of the NWT worked together to develop a single land claim on behalf of all the Dene and Metis in the Mackenzie Valley.\n\nOn July 19, 1975 in Fort Simpson, NT more than 300 delegates from all Denendeh communities gathered to approve a statement called “The Dene Declaration”. The delegates at this Second General Assembly represented the Indian Brotherhood of the Northwest Territories and the Metis Association of the Northwest Territories.\n\nAn agreement on the name of the organization “Indian Brotherhood of the Northwest Territories” was formally changed during the 8th Dene National Assembly held in Fort Norman, NT, August 14-20, 1978, to the “Dene Nation”.\n\nIn July 1976, the Dene made public the Dene Declaration and Manifesto, calling for the recognition of a separate nation of Dene within the Mackenzie Valley. The Dene claim called for the establishment of a separate Dene-contolled government for all Dene. Later in 1976, the Metis Association stated that it could not support this goal on philosophical grounds and announced it wished to develop its own claim. The federal government provided funding to enable the Metis to do so because it was considered essential that their aspirations be know before negotiations began. This was done on the understanding that there would still be only one final settlement for native claims in the Mackenzie Valley.\n\nA HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS\n\n1763\n\nThe Royal Proclamation was issued by the King of England.

The Little Buffalo River area is approximately twenty miles from Fort Resolution and provides one of the main areas for meat to the Dene of that community. Dene Nation President Georges Erasmus made it clear that violence would be considered, if necessary, to stop Shell Oil. Dene women from Fort Resolution promised to set up their tents around any caterpillars Shell Oil might move into their area. Shell Oil didn’t enter the area. The Dene demanded that Shell Oil not destroy the country there with cut lines and exploration activities. Dene demands were respected by the government for the 1976/1977 winter season.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada ruled on the appeal by the Dene Chiefs in their application to file Caveat on the Dene traditional territory. The ruling was based on the Land Titles Act (a federal government statute, the federal government also being the defendant in the Case) which states that a caveat cannot be filed on “public land for which no title has been issued.” The Supreme Court rejected the Dene Nation’s appeal to restore the original judgement of Mr. Justice William Morrow, which ruled in favor of the Dene Chiefs, but restricted filing of the Caveat until after all appeals to the case were decided.

The presentation stated that Aboriginal rights have to be recognized and a minimum of ten years to implement an agreement is needed before major development begins.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada denies the Dene the right to file a “caveat” over Dene land but does not challenge the existence of their Aboriginal Rights as defined by Mr. Justice Morrow in 1973.\n\nWarren Allmand, Minister of Indian Affairs, agreed to the Dene position for settlement based on the Metro Model passed at the Fort Fitzgerald Assembly in June 1977 stating:”It’s fully in the tradition of Canada.”\n\nThe Berger Report on the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry is published. It recommends postponing the pipeline for 10 years.\n\nThe National Energy Board rejects the Mackenzie Valley pipeline route and recommends building the Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline through the Yukon and B.C. It is approved by the Canadian government in August.\n\nDogrib Dene in Rae, Lac La Martre and Rae Lakes refuse treaty annuity unless the government recognizes that the Dene did not “cede and surrender” their land through Treaty #11.\n\nLarge rally picketed the Esso building in Montreal to protest the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline.

This process proved ineffective and was abandoned by the Dene two years earlier. The Dene refused. Faulkner threatened a moratorium on loans to cover negotiation costs if the Dene continue to “boycott”, in Faulkner’s words, “the process of negotiating through the O.N.C.”\n\nGeorges Erasmus, President of the Dene Nation, stated the Dene Nation’s position the National Energy Board in Ottawa in a nine hour sitting before the Board.\n\nOffice of the Indian Brotherhood of the NWT in Yellowknife was broken into and confidential documents were stolen.\n\n1978\n\nHerb A. Norwegian and Robert (Bob) Overvold began a six week tour of Germany and Denmark on speaking engagements to raise support for the Dene Nation. This tour resulted in an agreement to support from, and coalition with, anti-nuclear groups.\n\nDene Nation research staff’s work and political pressure from the Dene resulted in blocking the Department of National Defense’s bid to use 2,4,5-t defoliant on the channel maker sites on the Mackenzie River. The use was blocked for one year till the government could evaluate the potential harm this chemical will have on the environment. 2,4,5-t is the defoliant the American Armed Forces used in their war against Vietnam. It’s use is banned in the U.S.A. Some estimates, based on scientific tests, estimate plant growth, in areas where 2,4,5-t is used, to be retarded for up to 25 years.\n\nA federal government land claims proposal, entitled “Dene and Metis Claims in the Mackenzie Valley”, is rejected by both the Dene and Metis. Federal funding for negotiations is suspended for both groups until a single claim is produced.\n\nDene Leadership meeting in Lac La Martre to strategies on approaches to unity among all the descendants of the Dene, specifically to bring the members of the Metis Association and the Dene Nation together under one organization. 450 Dene attended.
