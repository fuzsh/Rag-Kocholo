        "text": "After learning about our history, we recommend taking a look about the impact that the Alzheimer Society is making today.\n\nThe 1970s\n\n1977\n\nThe Alzheimer Society is established when researchers at the University of Toronto and Surrey Place Centre who are investigating Alzheimer's disease become deeply concerned about the lack of support available to families affected by the disease.\n\nA Steering Group, composed of researchers, family members, professional staff and a resource person, is formed.\n\n1978\n\nIt becomes clear to the Steering Group that some form of an organization is needed and it identifies three major goals: family support, education and research. The Steering Group expands and becomes an Interim Board of Directors.\n\nThe organization is incorporated federally under the name Société Alzheimer Society, the first organization of its kind in the world. Forty-five people attend the founding meeting of the Alzheimer Society. A bank account for the Alzheimer Society is opened with an initial deposit of $100.\n\n1979\n\nThe Society receives charitable status as a non-profit organization. Working committees are established in each of the three identified areas of focus.\n\nLocal chapters are formed in Toronto, Hamilton, London and Guelph, Ontario and regional representatives are identified in every province.\n\nThe 1980s\n\n1980\n\nIn addition to three standing committees (Education, Research and Family Support), the Board activates a Finance/Fundraising Committee to generate funds for Society programs.\n\nIn these early years, the Alzheimer Society (known to many as the Alzheimer Movement) works to:\n\nProvide support to people with Alzheimer's disease and related conditions, their relatives and/or care providers,\n\nRepresent people with Alzheimer's disease and other concerned individuals and groups before all levels of government,\n\nPromote public and professional awareness of the disease and the fact that help is available and\n\nSupport and encourage research into Alzheimer's disease and related conditions.\n\n1982\n\nThe Society publishes and distributes more than 12,000 copies of its new 50-page Family Information Handbook on Alzheimer's disease and caregiving.\n\nThe Society holds its first Canada-wide Alzheimer Awareness Week in November to raise public awareness of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n1983\n\nRadio and television commercials are created for Alzheimer Awareness Week with Jean Béliveau of the Montreal Canadiens as the celebrity spokesperson. An awareness brochure, information sheet and quiz are also distributed across Canada.\n\n1984\n\nThe Alzheimer Society of Canada joins the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association in the United States of America (known now as the Alzheimer's Association) and representatives from seven other countries to form Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI).\n\n1985\n\nThe Society creates a Research Policy Committee to advise the Board and give policy direction in research and a Research Review Panel of academic researchers to review submissions for research grants.\n\n1986\n\nThe Society's Executive Director, Vince Gillis, begins a two-year term as Acting Secretary-General of Alzheimer's Disease International.\n\nThe general membership approves the establishment of a three-tier system with:\n\nA national office (known as the Alzheimer Society of Canada) to co-ordinate Canadian and international activities,\n\nProvincial organizations to liaise with local chapters and support groups and\n\nChapters and support groups to offer direct services to people with Alzheimer's disease and their families.\n\n1987\n\nThe Society enters into an affiliation agreement with the Nova Scotia provincial association.\n\nThe Society adopts a new Mission Statement:\n\n\"To alleviate the personal and social consequences of Alzheimer's disease and to promote the search for a cause and cure.\"\n\nThe annual Alzheimer Awareness campaign shifts from November to January, providing an opportunity to significantly expand the campaign by garnering thousands of dollars worth of free air time on radio and television.

This marks a departure from previous education efforts directed primarily at caregivers and families.\n\nThe Society develops a new section of its website, I Have Alzheimer's Disease, for people with the disease.\n\nTowards the end of the year, focus groups of people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are held across Canada to help the Society develop additional material that meets this group's needs.\n\nThe Society allocates more than $2 million in research funding for the first time.\n\n2002\n\nWith input from people with dementia through the focus groups held in 2001, the Alzheimer Society of Canada develops a new booklet and audiotape, Shared Experiences: Suggestions for those with Alzheimer's disease.

While provincial Alzheimer strategies currently exist, a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach is required at the national level involving government, agencies and people affected by Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia. The two organizations continue to work towards making the National Strategy a reality.\n\nThis year there are more than 85 early stage Alzheimer support groups across Canada offering information and peer support to people with the disease. These groups are lifelines for those with the disease.\n\nThe national website, now in its eighth year, receives almost 1 million page requests for the final quarter of 2004.
