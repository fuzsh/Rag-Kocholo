        "text": "A. General Requirements: Child Automatically Acquiring Citizenship after Birth[1]\n\nThe Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (CCA) amended INA 320 and removed INA 321 to create only one statutory provision and method for children in the United States to automatically acquire citizenship after birth. According to INA 320, a child born outside of the United States automatically becomes a U.S. citizen when all of the following conditions have been met on or after February 27, 2001:[2]\n\nThe person is a child[3] of a parent who is a U.S. citizen by birth or through naturalization (including an adoptive parent);[4]\n\nThe child is under 18 years of age;[5]\n\nThe child is a lawful permanent resident (LPR);[6] and\n\nThe child is residing[7] in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent.[8]\n\nB. Legal and Physical Custody of U.S. Citizen Parent\n\nLegal custody refers to the responsibility for and authority over a child. For purposes of this provision, USCIS presumes that a U.S. citizen parent has legal custody of a child and recognizes that the parent has lawful authority over the child, absent evidence to the contrary, in all of the following scenarios:[9]\n\nA biological child who currently resides with both biological parents who are married to each other, living in marital union, and not separated;\n\nA biological child who currently resides with a surviving biological parent, if the other parent is deceased;\n\nA biological child born out of wedlock who has been legitimated and currently resides with the parent;\n\nAn adopted child with a final adoption decree who currently resides with the adoptive U.S. citizen parent;[10]\n\nA child of divorced or legally separated parents where a court of law or other appropriate government entity has awarded primary care, control, and maintenance of the child to a parent under the laws of the state or country of residence.\n\nUSCIS considers a U.S. citizen parent who has been awarded “joint custody” to have legal custody of a child. There may be other factual circumstances under which USCIS may find the U.S. citizen parent to have legal custody to be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nC. Children of Armed Forces Members or U.S. Government Employees (or their Spouses)[11]\n\nOn March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted into law.[12] This Act provides that, under certain conditions, children of U.S. armed forces members or U.S. government employees (or their spouses)[13] who are residing outside the United States acquire citizenship under INA 320.[14] This applies to such children who were under the age of 18 on that date.[15]\n\nA child born outside of the United States acquires automatic citizenship under INA 320 in cases where the child is an LPR and is in the legal and physical custody of his or her U.S. citizen parent who is:[16]\n\nStationed and residing outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces;[17]\n\nStationed and residing outside of the United States as an employee of the U.S. government;[18] or\n\nThe spouse residing outside the United States in marital union[19] with a U.S. armed forces member or U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States.[20]\n\nIn cases involving the child of a U.S. armed forces member residing outside the United States, the child must be authorized to accompany and reside with the U.S. armed forces member as provided by the member’s official orders.[21] If the spouse of the U.S. armed forces member is the qualifying U.S. citizen parent, the spouse must be authorized to accompany and reside with the U.S. armed forces member as provided by the member’s official orders.[22]\n\nThe official orders that authorize a child and, if applicable, his or her U.S. citizen parent, to accompany and reside with the member of the U.S. armed forces outside of the United States are a statutory requirement for that child to acquire citizenship under INA 320. If the child (and, if applicable, U.S. citizen parent) being added to the orders is the last action for the child to qualify for acquisition, then the date of the order becomes the date of acquisition. There is no statutory requirement for children of U.S. government employees or their spouses to be included on the employee’s official orders.\n\nThe child of a U.S. armed forces member or a U.S. government employee (or his or her spouse) must meet the general requirements under INA 320(a)(1)-(2) in addition to being an LPR residing in the legal and physical custody of his or her U.S. citizen parent. All statutory requirements must be met before the child reaches the age of 18, including, if applicable, the issuance of the official orders for the child (and, if applicable, the U.S. citizen parent) to accompany and reside with the U.S. armed forces member who is stationed outside the United States.\n\nD. Acquiring Citizenship Before the Child Citizenship Act of 2000\n\nThe Child Citizenship Act (CCA) applies only to those children born on or after February 27, 2001, or those who were under 18 years of age as of that date. Persons who were 18 years of age or older on February 27, 2001, do not qualify for citizenship under INA 320. For such persons, including adopted children,[23] the law in effect at the time the last condition was met before reaching 18 years of age is the relevant law to determine whether they acquired citizenship.\n\nFormer Section 321 of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n\nIn general, former INA 321 applies to children who were already 18 years of age on February 27, 2001, but who were under 18 years of age in 1952, when the current Immigration and Nationality Act became effective.\n\nIn general, a child born outside of the United States to two noncitizen parents, or one noncitizen parent and one U.S. citizen parent who subsequently lost U.S. citizenship, acquires citizenship under former INA 321 if:\n\nThe child’s parent(s) meet one of the following conditions:​\n\nBoth parents naturalize;​\n\nOne surviving parent naturalizes if the other parent is deceased;​\n\nOne parent naturalizes who has legal custody of the child if there is a legal separation of the parents; or​\n\nThe child’s mother naturalizes if the child was born out of wedlock and paternity has not been established by legitimation.\n\nThe child is under 18 years of age when his or her parent(s) naturalize; and\n\nThe child is residing in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time the parent(s) naturalized or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the United States.\n\nAs originally enacted in 1952, this section did not apply to adopted children of naturalized citizens.[24] Beginning on October 5, 1978, however, INA 321 became generally applicable to an adopted child if the child was residing in the United States at the time the adoptive parent or parents naturalized and the child was in the custody of his or her adoptive parents pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.[25]\n\nE. Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600)\n\n1. Submission of Application\n\nA person born outside the United States who automatically acquires U.S. citizenship is not required to have evidence of such status. However, if the person seeks documentation of U.S. citizenship status, the person may file an Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600) with USCIS.[26]\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security has jurisdiction over the administration and enforcement of the INA within the United States, and the Secretary of State has jurisdiction over claims of U.S. citizenship made by persons who are abroad.[27] Therefore, generally, an Application for Certificate of Citizenship is submitted by persons who claim U.S. citizenship and are present within the United States. However, USCIS accepts a Form N-600 filed by a person who does not live in the United States, but USCIS does not adjudicate the application on the merits until the person is present in the United States in order to ensure that USCIS has jurisdiction over the application.[28]\n\nA person who is at least 18 years of age may submit the Application for Certificate of Citizenship on the person’s own behalf. There is no filing fee for Form N-600 for current or former members of the U.S. armed forces if they are filing on their own behalf. A U.S. citizen parent or a legal guardian must submit the application for a child who has not reached the age of 18 years.[29]\n\nUSCIS issues proof of U.S. citizenship in the form of a Certificate of Citizenship if the Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600) is approved and the person takes the Oath of Allegiance, if required to do so.[30]\n\nUSCIS does not mail Certificates of Citizenship outside the United States except when a military member is issued a Certificate of Citizenship under INA 320[31] or a military member’s dependent child naturalizes under INA 322(d).\n\n2. U.S. Passport or Consular Report of Birth Abroad as Evidence of Citizenship\n\nA person may also apply for a U.S. passport with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) to serve as evidence of their U.S. citizenship.[32] A parent or legal guardian of a U.S. citizen child born outside the United States may also apply to the local U.S. embassy or consulate for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA or Form FS-240).[33] A U.S. passport is valid for a limited time as established by DOS policies and standards on passport issuance.[34] Once a passport is expired, it is no longer conclusive evidence of citizenship.[35] Neither a CRBA nor a Certificate of Citizenship expires.\n\nA valid, unexpired U.S. passport or a CRBA serves as evidence of a person’s U.S. citizenship.[36] An applicant for a Certificate of Citizenship may submit a valid and unexpired U.S. passport or a CRBA as evidence of U.S. citizenship.[37] The officer must review the valid U.S. passport or CRBA and the documentation submitted with the application and contained in the record to determine if it was issued properly.\n\nThe officer approves the Application for Certificate of Citizenship if the applicant is a U.S. citizen and meets all requirements.\n\n3. Request to Revoke U.S. Passport or Cancel Consular Report of Birth Abroad\n\nIf the officer determines that the applicant is not a U.S. citizen or has evidence indicating that a U.S. passport or CRBA submitted as evidence was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously, the officer reviews the case with USCIS counsel. Then, if appropriate, the officer may request that DOS revoke the U.S. passport or cancel the CRBA.[38]\n\nOnly DOS has the authority to revoke a U.S. passport or cancel a CRBA.[39] DOS may revoke a U.S. passport or cancel a CRBA in cases where the passport or CRBA was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously.[40]\n\nUSCIS provides the following information to DOS in the passport revocation or CRBA cancellation request:\n\nThe applicant’s complete biographic information, including name and any known aliases;\n\nThe applicant’s last known address;\n\nAll previous unexpired U.S. passport numbers and alien registration numbers (A-numbers);\n\nA copy of the CRBA or of the biographical page of the U.S. passport submitted as evidence (if available);\n\nAn explanation for requesting revocation or cancellation, including reasons for the request, analysis of the facts and dates used in determining that the passport or CRBA should be revoked or cancelled, and evaluation of evidence indicating that the applicant did not acquire U.S. citizenship;\n\nCopies of all documentary evidence in support of the request, including certified translations of any documents written or originally prepared in a foreign language; and\n\nThe contact information of the USCIS office making the request.\n\nAdjudication of Application with Revocation or Cancellation Request\n\nAfter reviewing the case on the merits and requesting a revocation of a U.S. passport or a cancellation of a CRBA from DOS, the officer generally may not complete the adjudication of the Application for Certificate of Citizenship until DOS responds.\n\nIf DOS notifies USCIS that it does not intend to revoke the passport or cancel the CRBA, USCIS approves the Application for Certificate of Citizenship.[41] However, in cases with unusual or complex circumstances, USCIS may further consult with DOS.\n\nIf USCIS has evidence indicating that a U.S. passport submitted as evidence was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously, and the passport was valid at the time of filing, but is expired at the time of adjudication, the officer should review the case with USCIS counsel and DOS before adjudicating.[42]\n\nIf DOS revokes the U.S. passport or cancels the CRBA, the officer denies the application in cases where the applicant does not otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for issuance of a Certificate of Citizenship.\n\n4. Photographs and Signature\n\nUSCIS may require the applicant (person seeking the Certificate of Citizenship), regardless of age, to appear at a local Application Support Center (ASC)[43] for photograph and signature submission.[44] A parent or legal guardian may sign for a child under the age of 14.[45] The parent or legal guardian of the person for whom the Certificate of Citizenship is sought does not submit any photographs in connection with the Form N-600.\n\nUSCIS does not submit information collected in connection with Form N-600 to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for a background check.\n\nPhotograph Submission Outside the United States\n\nA person seeking a Certificate of Citizenship who is residing outside the United States only needs to submit two passport-style photographs with the properly submitted application. USCIS does not schedule overseas applicants for an ASC appointment. USCIS coordinates with military service members who are stationed outside of the United States, if necessary, to secure photographs.\n\nFailure to Appear for the ASC Appointment\n\nUSCIS may consider the Form N-600 abandoned in cases where the person seeking a Certificate of Citizenship fails to appear for the ASC appointment, unless, by the appointment time, USCIS receives a change of address or rescheduling request that USCIS concludes warrants excusing the failure to appear.[46]\n\nIf USCIS denies the application due to abandonment, the person eligible for the Certificate of Citizenship, or the parent or legal guardian of the person eligible for the Certificate of Citizenship, or the parent or legal guardian who filed on behalf of a child seeking a Certificate of Citizenship, may submit a motion to reopen or reconsider by filing a Notice of Appeal or Motion (Form I-290B).[47]\n\nUSCIS does not deny an application for abandonment for failure to provide photographs if USCIS has evidence that the applicant is a member of the U.S. armed forces who is permanently or temporarily outside the United States and unable to provide photographs or appear to submit a photograph and signature for reasons related to the individual’s military service. USCIS coordinates with military service members in these circumstances.\n\nF. Documentation and Evidence\n\nThe applicant must submit the following required documents unless such documents are already contained in the USCIS administrative record or do not apply:[48]\n\nThe child's birth certificate or record.\n\nMarriage certificate of child's parents, if applicable.\n\nProof of termination of any previous marriage of each parent if either parent was previously married and divorced or widowed, for example:​\n\nDivorce Decree; or​\n\nDeath Certificate.\n\nEvidence of United States citizenship of parent:​\n\nBirth Certificate;​\n\nNaturalization Certificate;​\n\nConsular Report of Birth Abroad (FS-240);​\n\nA valid unexpired U.S. passport; or​\n\nCertificate of Citizenship.\n\nDocuments verifying legitimation according to the laws of the child's residence or domicile or father's residence or domicile if the child was born out of wedlock.\n\nDocumentation of legal custody in the case of divorce, legal separation, or adoption.\n\nIf applicable, official orders (that is, a Permanent Change of Station (PCS)) from the respective department that authorized the child of the U.S. armed forces member, or the child of the spouse of such member and the spouse,[49] to accompany the U.S. citizen parent.\n\nCopy of Permanent Resident Card or Alien Registration Receipt Card or other evidence of lawful permanent resident status, such as an I-551 stamp in a valid foreign passport or travel document issued by USCIS.\n\nCopy of the full, final adoption decree, if applicable.[50]\n\nEvidence of all legal name changes, if applicable, for the child and U.S. citizen parent.\n\nAn applicant does not need to submit documents that were submitted in connection with:\n\nAn immigrant visa application retained by the American Consulate for inclusion in the immigrant visa package; or\n\nAn immigrant petition or application and included in a USCIS administrative file.\n\nIf necessary, an officer may continue the application to request additional documentation to make a decision on the application.\n\nG. Citizenship Interview and Waiver\n\nIn general, an applicant must appear in person for an interview before a USCIS officer after filing an Application for Certificate of Citizenship. This includes the U.S. citizen parent or parents if the application is filed on behalf of a child under 18 years of age.[51] USCIS, however, may waive the interview requirement if all the required documentation necessary to establish the applicant's eligibility is already included in USCIS administrative records or if the required documentation is submitted along with the application.[52]\n\nH. Decision and Oath of Allegiance\n\n1. Approval of Application, Oath of Allegiance, and Waiver for Children under 14 Years of Age\n\nIf an officer approves the Application for Certificate of Citizenship, USCIS administers the Oath of Allegiance before issuing a Certificate of Citizenship.[53]\n\nHowever, the INA permits USCIS to waive the taking of the Oath of Allegiance if USCIS determines the person is unable to understand its meaning.[54] USCIS has determined that children under the age of 14 are generally unable to understand the meaning of the oath.\n\nAccordingly, USCIS waives the oath requirement for a child younger than 14 years of age. If USCIS waives the oath requirement, USCIS issues a Certificate of Citizenship after the officer approves the application.\n\n2. Denial of Application\n\nIf an officer denies the Certificate of Citizenship application, the officer must notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for denial and include information on the right to appeal in the notice.[55] An applicant may file an appeal within 30 calendar days after service of the decision (33 days if the decision was mailed).\n\nFootnotes\n\n[^ 1] See INA 320.

For guidance on citizenship for adopted children, see Volume 5, Adoptions, Part F, Citizenship for Adopted Children [5 USCIS-PM F].\n\n[^ 5] USCIS considers a child to be under the age of 18 years even if the last condition for acquisition of citizenship falls on the day of the child’s 18th birthday. See Matter of L. M. and C. Y. C., 4 I&N Dec. 617 (BIA 1952).\n\n[^ 6] A person is generally considered to be an LPR once USCIS approves the adjustment application or once the person enters the United States with an immigrant visa. See INA 245(b). For certain classifications, however, the effective date of becoming an LPR is a date that is earlier than the actual approval of the status (commonly referred to as a “rollback” date). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 2, LPR Admission for Naturalization, Section A, LPR at Time of Filing and Naturalization [12 USCIS-PM D.2(A)]. A person who is born a U.S. national and is the child of a U.S. citizen may establish eligibility for a Certificate of Citizenship without having to establish LPR status.\n\n[^ 7] For the definition of residence, see Chapter 2, Definition of Child and Residence for Citizenship and Naturalization, Section F, Definition of U.S. Residence [12 USCIS-PM H.2(F)].\n\n[^ 8] See INA 320. See 8 CFR 320.2. Certain children of U.S. armed forces members or U.S. government employees (or their spouses) who are residing outside the United States may acquire citizenship under INA 320. See Section C, Children of Armed Forces Members or U.S. Government Employees (or their Spouses) [12 USCIS‑PM H.4(C)]. See INA 320(c) (added by the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act, Pub. L. 116-133 (PDF) (March 26, 2020)).\n\n[^ 9] See 8 CFR 320.1.\n\n[^ 10] If the requirements of INA 101(b)(1)(E), or INA 101(b)(1)(F), or INA 101(b)(1)(G) are met. See Volume 5, Adoptions, Part E, Family-Based Adoption Petitions [5 USCIS-PM E]. See Volume 5, Adoptions, Part C, Child Eligibility Determinations (Orphan) [5 USCIS-PM C]. See Volume 5, Adoptions, Part D, Child Eligibility Determinations (Hague) [5 USCIS-PM D]. For information on citizenship for adopted children, see Volume 5, Adoptions, Part F, Citizenship for Adopted Children [5 USCIS-PM F].\n\n[^ 11] For information about USCIS policies pertaining to this group of children before March 26, 2020, see Appendix: History of Acquiring Citizenship under INA 320 for Children of U.S. Citizens who are Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, U.S. Government Employees, or their Spouses [ ].\n\n[^ 12] See Pub. L. 116-133 (PDF) (March 26, 2020) (codified at INA 320(c)).\n\n[^ 13] Spouses must be U.S. citizens if the child seeks to acquire citizenship under INA 320 based on the child’s residence with that spouse.\n\n[^ 14] The Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act, Pub. L. 116-133 (PDF) (March 26, 2020), did not redefine “residence in the United States” for these children. Instead, it created an exception to the U.S. residence requirement by providing that INA 320(a)(3) is deemed satisfied in applicable cases.\n\n[^ 15] These provisions do not affect children who have already been recognized by USCIS or the Department of State as having acquired U.S. citizenship under INA 320 through the issuance of a Certificate of Citizenship or passport.\n\n[^ 16] This provision would also apply to a child adopted by a U.S. citizen parent if the child satisfies the requirements applicable to adopted children under INA 101(b)(1) and INA 320(b).\n\n[^ 17] See INA 320(c)(2)(A)(i). For a list of qualifying military branches, see Part I, Military Members and their Families, Chapter 2, One Year of Military Service during Peacetime (INA 328), Section B, Honorable Service [12 USCIS-PM I.2(B)] and Section C, National Guard Service [12 USCIS-PM I.2(C)]. Service is not required to be “honorable” for the purposes of INA 320(c)(2)(A)(i) and a Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service (Form N-426) is not required as evidence.\n\n[^ 18] See INA 320(c)(1)(A). An “employee of the U.S. government” means a person employed by the U.S. government and does not include a person employed under contract with the U.S. government. Because there is no statute or regulation defining employee or “employee of the Government of the United States” in the citizenship and naturalization context, the common law definition of employee applies. See Clackamas Gastroenterology Assoc., P.C., v. Wells, 538 U.S. 440, 448 (2003). See Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 322-23 (1992). The concept of “control” is the key to determining whether a person is an employee under the common law. See Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 323 (1992). Further, the plain language of the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act, Pub. L. 116-133 (PDF) (March 26, 2020), does not include persons employed under contract with the Government of the United States, in contrast to INA 316(b), which applies more specifically to persons “employed by or under contract with the Government of the United States.”\n\n[^ 19] Temporary orders, such as to serve in a combat zone or for mission support performance, do not affect the marital union between a military member and his or her spouse and would not impact acquisition of citizenship provisions under INA 320(c).\n\n[^ 20] See INA 320(c)(2)(A)(ii) (spouses of U.S. armed forces member) and INA 320(c)(1)(B) (spouses of U.S. government employees).\n\n[^ 21] See INA 320(c)(2)(B). For guidance on “official orders,” see Part I, Military Members and their Families, Chapter 9, Spouses, Children, and Surviving Family Benefits, Section A, General Provisions for Spouses, Children, and Parents of Military Members, Subsection 2, Documenting “Official Orders” [12 USCIS-PM I.9(A)(2)].\n\n[^ 22] See INA 320(c)(2)(A)(ii).\n\n[^ 23] For more information about adopted children who did not qualify under the CCA because they were at least 18 years of age on February 27, 2001 (were born on or before February 27, 1983), see Volume 5, Adoptions, Part F, Citizenship for Adopted Children, Appendix: How Previous Citizenship Provisions Apply to Adopted Children [5 USCIS-PM F, Appendices Tab].\n\n[^ 24] See Section 321(b) of INA of 1952, Pub. L. 82-414 (PDF), 66 Stat. 163, 245 (June 27, 1952).\n\n[^ 25] See Section 5 of the Act of October 5, 1978, Pub. L. 95-417 (PDF). The 1978 amendment limited this benefit to a child adopted while under 16 years of age. This restriction was removed in 1981 by the Act of December 21, 1981, Pub. L. 97-116 (PDF).\n\n[^ 26] See 8 CFR 341.1. However, certain adopted children automatically receive a Certificate of Citizenship without having to file Form N-600. If an adopted child is admitted on an IR-3 or IH-3 visa (because the child’s adoption was finalized before entering the United States), is residing in the United States in the U.S. citizen parent’s legal and physical custody before the child reaches the age of 18, and otherwise fulfills the conditions of INA 320, USCIS automatically issues the child a Certificate of Citizenship.
