The Santa Cruz River, which is generally dry 300 or more days per year, had only one of its 18 bridges open for service on the morning of Monday, October 3. Along the Rillito, a tributary of the Santa Cruz, hundreds of area residents watched on Sunday, October 2, as the river gradually eroded 100 ft from its bank through a parking lot and undermined an office building, which collapsed into the widened stream. The water from the combined streams overflowed its banks beyond the Tucson metropolitan area to flood acres of farmland and force the evacuation of the entire community of Marana, which was situated in the stream's delta. Early estimates of the costs of repair- ing public bridges and major roadways in the Tucson area ranged from $54 to $100 million. The tropical weather pattern responsible for this flooding also caused major floods along the Gila River and two of its tributaries, the San Francisco River and the San Pedro River. A few days earlier another storm caused floods in Prescott, Arizona. Particularly hard-hit were Clifton (a mining community along the San Francisco River already beleaguered by a bitter labor strike), Marana and Rillito (downstream from Tucson along the Santa Cruz), and several communities along the Gila River from Winkelman to Kelvin (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1983). So widespread and severe were the floods in Arizona south of the Mogollon Rim that some regard them as the worst disaster in Arizona since it became a state in 1912. There are many aspects of the Arizona floods of October 1983 worthy of further investigation. Some examples are the sociological effects of the flood on the tension-ridden community of Clifton, where strikers accused the Governor of a greater readiness to use the National Guard to control the strikers than to deal with the flood emergency; the special I 2 problem of great distances hampering flood relief efforts in a state where the flooded communities were widely separated from each other and from the disaster assistance center in Phoenix; the almost total col- lapse of the road system in southern Arizona, where one bridge served as the last remaining link between Tucson and Phoenix; or the problems of places like Marana where desert rivers debouch beyond their deeply incised channels. We do not attempt to address all these potentially interesting topics but instead focus on metropolitan Tucson and on what we regard as the most unique aspects of the event: the flood behavior of desert streams, and the implications of recent rapid urban growth and development for dealing with the flood hazard. Tucson provides an excellent site for studying the problems of rapid urban growth in the desert. It is one of several cities in the Sunbelt that have for the past four decades had a rate of growth well beyond the national average. The rapid growth In the Sunbelt is often attributed, as the name indicates, to the climatic amenities of the region. The long-sustained rapid growth has also attracted many people who are interested in the economic climate. Rapid growth creates many economic opportunities. This is especially true in places like Arizona, where the prevailing opinion is that the use of private land should be free from government interference. Newcomers see Arizona as a promising place to work under fewer of the planning constraints imposed in many other areas. A perennial problem in this desert area of rapid growth stems from. the newcomers' unfamiliarity with local environmental constraints. Images, ideas, and institutions from outside are applied, however inappropriate they may be. A prime example is floodplain zoning, in which many provisions were designed for streams in humid areas. On desert valley floors, true floodplains with overbank flows are rare while lateral erosion of arroyo banks is common (Committee on Natural Disasters, 1982). Basic understanding of such facts and of their implications for wise planning is not widespread among professional engineers or the general public. In part this stems from the current limits of scientific knowledge of desert streams; in part It is a natural result of the large influx of newcomers unaware of desert conditions; it also results from general attitudes that tend to favor growth rather than planning. For all of the reasons just mentioned, Tucson provides an exciting locale for studying human adaptation to a desert site. FurthermoreV a long, detailed, and continuous record of arroyo cutting on the Santa Cruz is available. This record documents past floods and the tremendous changes in the river's landscape since Tucson became part of the United States with the Gadsden Purchase of 1854. In the remainder of this report we discuss the Tucson flood from the perspective of these themes. We try to answer the question of what happens during a major flood in a desert area that has undergone rapid urban growth. As we do so we try to point out scientific research ques- tions or public policy issues that could be addressed by more detailed research. Chapter 2 discusses the meteorological event and the warning process, Chapter 3 discusses the geomorphology and hydrology of the Tucson Basin., Chapter 4 examines the human response to the flood, and Chapter 5 offers our conclusions. 2 THE METEOROLOGICAL EVENT AND THE WARNING PROCESS Episodes of heavy rainfall over extensive parts of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States occur nearly every year in late summer and early fall. The location of areas receiving maximum precip- itation from the storms varies from one storm period to the next and depends on the meteorological conditions prevailing at the time of the event. Storms that produce the largest amounts of precipitation occur when ocean temperatures in the southeastern part of the Pacific Ocean are high, when moist air associated with the remnants of a tropical cyclone in that region is drawn across Mexico into the American South- west, and when this air then interacts with a significant frontal system associated with an upper-level cold trough or low over the region. This \"tropical connection\" has been examined by a number of scien- tists, notably Douglas (1972), Pyke (1975), and Court (1980). They have identified the significant events in the precipitation history of the Southwest attributable to tropical storms. Their work has been analyzed and amplified by Hansen and Schwarz (1981), who have established the conditions under which a hypothetical storm would produce maximum con- centrations of precipitation in Arizona. They suggest that the ideal conditions are: 1. Antecedent synoptic-scale weather features that permit the accumulation and transport of significant moisture into the Southwest well ahead of a tropical cyclone circulation. This moisture is neces- sary for the rainfall to be of long duration. The August 1951 storm that gave the greatest long-duration rainfall of record had such an antecedent weather feature. This feature allows for substantial rain- fall prior to that associated with the hypothesized tropical cyclone circulation. 2. The southward development of a midlatitude cold trough aloft to help accelerate the storm as it turns northward or north-northeastward and crosses Baja California's coast and mountainous backbone at its lowest elevation (near 290N latitude). The accelerated speed de- creases the time the storm spends over land and therefore minimizes loss of intensity. In the optimum case the tropical cyclone should regain some of its intensity as it moves over the small area of warmer waters in the northern portion of the Gulf of California. 3 4 3. Maximum or near maximum sea surface temperature (SST) off the west coast of Baja California. This permits an offshore tropical cyclone to remain fully developed farther north than under normal SST conditions. This apparently was the case with the September 24-26, 1939, storm. Tropical storm Joanne in October 1972 was also fed by above-normal SST. 4. A well-formed tropical cyclone gaining intensity well south of Baja California and moving slowly northwest or northward so as to permit the optimum realization of the antecedent tropical cyclone rainfall. 5. A tropical cyclone track that, after reaching the latitude of Baja California, parallels the coast at just the right distance offshore so that, in addition to having a good supply of energy from Pacific Ocean waters, the outer fringes of the massive storm circulation draw from the very warm waters of the Gulf of California. 6. Entrance into southwestern Arizona with a circulation of great strength, after which the remnant storm interacts with a significant midlatitude frontal system associated with an extremely cold trough or low pressure aloft, as occurred in the disastrous storm of September 1970. The list of conditions established by Hansen and Schwarz was derived by examining a large number of episodes of heavy rainfall that had tropical origins and were associated with the remnants of tropical storms that hit the American Southwest. Table 1 lists some of the most significant tropical cyclones that have produced moisture in the area. THE STORM OF SEPTEMBER 28-OCTOBER 3, 1983 The August before the storm of September 28-October 3, 1983, had been a very wet month; so had September. In fact, it had rained almost every other day at many climatological stations in Arizona. This, in the normally dry fall season, was unusual. On September 28 the surface weather map exhibited few unusual features. A thermal low lay over the head of the Gulf of California, and the tail end of a weak cold front appeared across the Great Basin to the north. (Weather maps may be found in Appendix A.) At the 500-mb level, however, an immense trough elongated in a southwesterly to northeasterly direction had developed, bringing tropical moisture into the area. At the same time, a tropical storm, Octave, was gaining strength off the tip of Baja California. Winds at virtually all levels above the surface were from the south to south- west. Isobars at the 500-mb level trended in the same direction. The National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Office in Phoenix noted this and forecast the renewal of summer monsoon-type showery weather. Precipitation in Tucson began innocently enough at 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, September 28. Off and on until midnight, 0.07 in. of rain fell. The rain then ceased until noon on September 29, when a shower occurred. Rain then persisted until noon on September 30. The first flash flood warning of the period was issued by the Tucson NWS Office on September 29 for the period between 5:40 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. At 10:20 5 TABIE 1 Selected Storms that Have Affected the American Southwest Tropical Date Storm Affected Area Sept. 24-26, 1939 Arizona/California/Nevada Aug. 26-29, 1951 Charlie Northwest Mexico/California/Arizona Aug. 17-19, 1960 Diana Baia California/Sonora Sept. 15-19, 1963 Katherine Southern California Sept. 23-26, 1965 Hazel Northwest Mexico Aug. 29-Sept. 2, 1967 Katrina Southeast California/Southwest Arizona Sept. 7-14, 1969 Glenda Central Arizona Sept. 4-6, 1970 Norma Central Arizona Aug. 27-Sept. 6, 1972 Hyacinth Southern California/Arizona Sept. 30-Oct. 6, 1972 Joanne Southern, central, and eastern Arizona Sept. 6-10, 1976 Kathleen Southern California/Arizona Aug. 11-15, 1977 Doreen NW Mexico/California/Arizona Oct. 6-11, 1977 Heather Mexico/Arizona Sept. 28-Oct. 3, 1983 Octave Mexico/Arizona p.m. a weather statement was issued indicating decreased rainfall and thunderstorm activity. Furthermore, it added: The Santa Cruz River is quite high--and persons living near the river should be cautious--as there may still be localized flooding of the lower banked areas . . . . Light to moderate rain is still falling over eastern Pima County--and dips and washes may still have some running water for the next few hours. Motorists in the affected areas should continue to use caution in eastern Pima County. By Friday afternoon there were clues appearing that more heavy precipitation was due. Moisture, in the form of clouds, could be seen streaming northward from tropical storm Octave (Figure 1), and meteo- rologists at the Phoenix NWS Office marked the location of several embedded, precipitation-enhancing short waves rotating around the major upper-level trough (Figure 2). As a consequence, the hydrologists with the Joint Federal-State Flood Warning Office issued a statement: Heavy rainfall during the past few days has caused signifi- cant rises along many rivers and streams throughout the eastern two thirds of Arizona. Although no mainstream flooding has been reported, the San Francisco River near Clifton remains near bankfull and lowland overflow has been reported along the Santa Cruz River near Marana today. Significant flows have also been reported 6 low ;7- @ , V@N nt 27, mt_ \"04 Al A FIGURE 1 Moisture from tropical storm Octave, located off the west coast of Baja California, may be observed in the band of clouds extending across northwest Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico. This photograph was taken at 6:15 p.m. GMT on October 2, 1983. along portions of the Verde River and its tributaries and along Tonto Creek. The rains have saturated the ground and filled most streams and rivers . . . . Any additional rainfall will run off rather rapidly and could cause increased or renewed rises. Thus, when it began raining shortly after midnight on Saturday, October 1, the Phoenix NWS Office issued a flash flood watch for all parts of central and southern Arizona and, in particular, south- and west-facing mountain slopes. It said: Many areas of central and southern Arizona have received from 2 to 4 inches or more of rainfall since Wednesday, September 28 . . . with lesser amounts elsewhere. The ground has now become 7 L520 5140 5152 H56 go 558 L523 00 534 lc@o sle 540 552 X H @59 4 X CLE X L H see FIGURE 2 National Weather Service 500-mb analysis for Friday evening, September 30, 1983. Embedded short waves are shown by dashed lines. saturated in a large portion of the state. As a result . . . additional rainfall in these areas now has a very high risk of running off almost immediately. Satellite photos during the predawn hours show heavy amounts of moisture approaching Arizona from both the west and south. Very strong southwesterly winds in the upper atmosphere will cause this moist air to impinge upon the central mountains and force the air to release its moisture. As a result the potential for heavy rains exist for these south- and west-facing slopes of the central mountains . . . as well as those remaining portions of Arizona south and west of the central mountains. Persons in the watch area, particularly motorists and those in known flood-prone areas or in areas which have flooded recently. . . . should use extreme caution today. Check preparedness requirements and be ready to move to higher ground 8 immediately if threatening clouds approach or if water levels in your area begin to rise. Motorists should not attempt to cross flooded roadways . as water depths and currents are frequently misjudged. The heaviest precipitation associated with the storm occurred shortly thereafter and was reported by personnel at the Tucson NWS Office. Their comments appear below: At 9:10 a.m. MST Tucson local radar is showing a heavy shower activity throughout eastern Pima, - - . northern Santa Cruz, and northwestern Cochise counties. Most of Pinal County is also affected. An inch and a quarter of rain has fallen at the airport here in Tucson in the last two hours and there have been numerous reports of one and a half inches or more throughout the city and outlying areas. All rivers, . . . washes, dips, and other low-lying areas are reported running full. Motorists and persons in af- fected areas are advised to take extreme caution and not enter any flooded areas. Heavy rains continued over much of Arizona during the morning. Rates of over 1/2 in./h were reported from a number of sites in the southeastern part of the state. By noon the Tucson NWS Office could report a lessening of precipitation, but flooding was widely reported in the metropolitan area. The 2:50 p.m. statement from the Phoenix NWS Office on Saturday afternoon did not give much hope for relief. It read: [There is a] flash flood watch for south-central and southeast Arizona until 5 a.m. MST. . . . The watch area includes Pima, Pinal, - . . Santa Cruz, . . - Cochise, . . . Maricopa, Southern Yavapai, Gila, Graham, and Greenlee counties. A steady stream of subtropical moisture is moving into Arizona from the south. This will continue to bring numerous and locally heavy showers over all but the far west portions of the state. For tonight the areas most vulnerable to heavy rain are the central and east-central mountains southward. Heavy rains have continued to fall in the Tucson area through early afternoon. Satellite pictures indicate that much of Pima, . . . Pinal, and Graham counties are continuing to get heavy showers. A flash flood watch means flash flooding is possible. Motorists should stay out of flooded stream crossings and highway dips and avoid narrow . . . steep-walled canyons. Heavy rains of the past few days and again today have already brought considerable flooding problems. All persons with property subject to flash flooding should take immediate action for protection if possible. 9 During Saturday evening, continued runoff and the possibility of additional precipitation brought this flood statement from the Joint Federal-State Flood Warning Office: Continuing rains during the past several days and especially today have caused significant rises throughout the Santa Cruz Basin and its tributaries. Water levels throughout the river are extremely high with lowland overflows occurring in the Continental and Marana areas. Riverbottom road crossings throughout the Tucson area are closed because of the high water. Possible additional rains could cause further increases in river level or renewed rises with some additional overflow. Persons located near the river should remain alert to current conditions and the possibility of the sudden increases in river levels through Sunday. The air flowing across Arizona continued to be warm and unstable, and satellite pictures and radar echoes continued to show large thun- derstorms over northwestern Mexico. At 9:50 p.m. local radar showed mostly light showers in the Tucson metropolitan area moving toward the northeast. However, at 1:25 a.m. on October 2 the radar picked up a line of showers that extended from Redrock, north of Tucson, to a point just west of Sasabe. These cloud cells were moving toward Tucson at about 20 mph and were forecast to reach the area around 3:00 a.m. Satellite photographs had shown them to be increasing in intensity. Local inflow from very heavy and persistent showers and thunderstorms in the Tucson area has also dramatically increased the flow in the Santa Cruz River. The flow in the river has increased between Continental and Tucson. This flow is still far short of that which is needed to cause the river to leave its channel at Tucson. However, . . . local inflow into the Santa Cruz in the Tucson area from these heavy showers and thunder-storms has caused a sharp rise in the river. While the river is still well within its channel, . . . heavy lateral erosion of the river banks has . . . and will continue to.take place through at least 9 a.m. this Sunday morning. Those persons affected by this erosion should move to a place of safety immediately. At the same time, numerous law enforcement agencies were indicating that all dips, washes, rivers, and low-lying areas in the Tucson metro- politan area were full of water. The Rillito at North Country Club Road was overflowing its banks, and there was water in the surrounding streets. Considerable lowland flooding had occurred near Marana and northward along the Santa Cruz. The overflow of the Santa Cruz at Continental continued. However, the worst of the heavy precipitation was over. Spor- adic showers continued in the Tucson area through noon on October 3. 10 However, continued runoff on major watersheds contributed to severe flooding at Clifton on the San Francisco River, at Safford and Duncan on the Gila River, and on the San Pedro and Santa Cruz rivers. Most of these streams crested before noon on the third, but additional precipitation could have caused additional problems. By 6:30 p.m. on October 3, showers and thunderstorms in the affected area had decreased markedly. The Phoenix NWS Office issued a flash flood statement that canceled the flash flood watch still in effect. The storm was over--the task of recovery had begun. WAS THIS \"THE STORM OF THE CENTURY\"? Suggestions that Tucson has seen its 100-year storm and need not worry about another one for another century are simplistic and false. Even if it were a 100-year storm, there would still be a one percent chance of another next year or any other year. A review of the probable maximum precipitation (PMP) conditions given above reveals that one ingredient in the maximum storm event was missing. Tropical hurricane Octave, like Norma in 1970, expired quietly at sea and did not penetrate Arizona. However, the copious and continuous precipitation associated with this particular event may be attributed to the presence of the other factors listed in the first part of this section. Ocean temperatures off the west coast of Mexico were above normal (Figure 3), and an elongated upper-level trough that penetrated to the tropics brought warm, moist, unstable air into the region. Also, cold air had been advected into the region on the back side of the trough. The significant and unusual features of this storm period were the amounts of precipitation that occurred prior to September 28 and the duration of the precipitation in the five days that followed. August and September had been extremely wet over much of the central and eastern part of the state. September was the wettest September of record at a number of locations in Arizona. Then, once it began to rain on September 28, there were only brief respites from precipitation in the days that followed. At the Tucson NWS Office there were 26 dif- ferent hourly observations in which precipitation was reported on September 28, 29, and 30. After the rain began again between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. on October 1, it lasted for almost 42 hours with brief pauses between showers (Figure 4). Most of the severe flooding was associated with the persistent rains in the morning hours of October I and October 2. But, in comparison to precipitation from a large August thunder- storm, the amounts were small (Table 2), and the return periods for time durations of less than three hours were three years or less (Figure 5). However, the rain that began falling shortly after 6:00 a.m. in western Tucson on October I culminated in a heavy shower of 0.78 in. between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on October 2, bringing a 24-hour total of 3.58 in.

It can be seen from the table that precipitation occurring during the period of greatest intensity did not exceed values for a 25-year return period at the weather station located at Tucson International Airport. There have been a number of differences of opinion as to the inten- sity of this storm. If one adopts techniques other than those used by Kangieser, including the Pearson III distribution, a return period of nearly 50 years can be derived. However, Kangieser argues that the Pearson III distribution overestimates return periods for rainfall durations longer than 6 hours. A more accurate estimate, he contends, can be made using smoothed regional values of the kind found in the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the Western United States (P. Kan- gieser, personal communication, 1983). F-i-gure 6 compares return periods calculated on the basis of these two techniques. 14 TABLE 3 Estimated Return Periods for Precipitation in Tucson Return Period (yr) Duration 1 2 5 10 25 50 100 5min 0.27 0.34 0.44 0.50 0.61 0.68 0.77 10 min 0.41 0.52 0.68 0.78 0.94 1.06 1.19 15 min 0.53 0.66 0.86 0.99 1.19 1.34 1.50 30 min 0.73 0.92 1.19 1.37 1.65 1.86 2.09 1h 0.92 1.16 1.50 1.73 2.09 2.35 2.64 2h 0.95 1.28 1.67 1.94 2.35 2.64 2.96 3h 1.06 1.35 1.78 2.08 2.52 2.84 3.18 6h 1.17 1.50 2.00 2.34 2.84 3.21 3.59 12h 1.26 1.65 2.24 2.62 3.19 3.62 4.06 24h 1.37 1.81 2.48 2.92 3.55 4.05 4.54 RETURN PERIOD (YEARS) 1.01 1.1 1.5 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 500 1000 I I I I i I I I I T -FISHER-TIPPETT TYPE I ez?@ HR (BASED ON NOAA ATLAS 2 DATA) -GOODRIDGE ANALYSIS 4- (BASED ON PEARSON TYPE M) 24 HR 6 HR 3 - 0 1 HR z 2 w I- 0 1.0 18 5'0 80 90 96 98 99 99.5 99.9 PROBABILITY M FIGURE 6 Return periods calculated on the basis of a Pearson III distribution and data from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the Western United States (NOAA Atlas 2). 15 But how unusual was the meteorological event itself? On September 23, just prior to this episode in Sonora and eastern Arizona, the area around Prescott in central Arizona was drenched with rainfall from a tropical air mass. Shortly after October 3 another tropical storm entered the coast of western Mexico, and moisture from the storm con- tributed to flooding in Mexico and Texas. Some of the other periods when surges of tropical air from the eastern Pacific Ocean affected northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States were listed in Table 1. One of the largest and most severe storms with a tropical connection was the Labor Day Storm of 1970, which is generally used as a model of what can happen in Arizona. The isobyetal map for this storm appears in Figure 7. As can be seen, the areal extent of this storm and the amounts of precipitation dropped on the state were comparable to the present event. Intensities during the 1970 storm were higher, and the meteorological conditions were somewhat different, but the results were similar, although the area affected was farther north and west. However, not too many of these persistent tropical surges have passed over the Tucson area and into the White Mountain region to the northeast. In this case, the flow of air at all levels directed a stream of moisture from off the coast of Baja California toward the northeast. It was the persistence of this flow that was unusual and not the intensity of the precipitation associated with any particular part of it. Much of the precipitation was orographic in nature. Maximum amounts occurred on the south and west slopes of the mountains, and the highest values were recorded at high elevations. Mount Lemmon reported over 10 in.; Blue, farther northeast, in the White Mountains, nearly 11 in. The location of the stream of moist air can be seen by looking at the map of total storm precipitation (Figure 8) and by examining the 500-mb charts in Appendix A. Thus, although Tucson did not experience its \"storm of the century\" during September and October of 1983, it is possible that a future surge of tropical moisture across this area will cause such an event for the Tucson metropolitan region. Given the consequences of the 1983 storm, the result will be devastating. THE WARNING PROCESS The process of providing the public with timely warnings of impending weather-related disasters involves a number of groups that need to work in unity at the time of the event. To do so effectively requires work- ing and planning together prior to the event. Lack of an adequate ob- servational network, lack of adequate communication facilities, limited cooperation amofig agencies charged with serving the public, and a lack of understanding among governmental officials about the nature of dis- asters and about the available warning systems often result in a poor set of responses when an emergency situation exists. The situation In Pima County in early October 1983 was no exception. During any major flood event, hydrologists and meteorologists need timely reports of precipitation and runoff. During the Tucson flood the 16 FLAGSTAFF 4 41 PRESCOT T % 5 6 _4 if.

DARDC (Device for Automatic Remote Data Collection) Network of rainfall reporting stations worked reasonably well when queried locally by the Phoenix NWS Office's NOVA 4 computer. However, reports from the same network, when queried by the national Central Area DARDC Automated System (CADAS) failed to respond. Thus the only other precipitation data available to weather forecasters and hydrologists during the storm period were the routine morning and late afternoon reports from regu- larly reporting climatological substations and other agencies. Col- lection of reports from these stations and others was hampered in some 17 L TAFF Ok,,RAO@ 35* RESCOTT PAYSON 40\" 6 '944f 30 S I L RIVER 9 10- GLOBE PHO Nix RIVER 6 33 32* 113* 0 4 /C 112* 9.T2 110* SCALE MILES 2 9 25 50 175 25 0 25 so 7@5 KM _ .

However, in Tucson the local network of cooperating observers provided valuable information to the Tucson NWS Office. The system to acquire real-time hydrologic data did not function effectively during the storm period. All stations in the network report at OOZ and every three hours thereafter via satellite to the downlinks at NOAA's Wallops Island facility in Virginia and at the Salt River Project office in Phoenix. Additionally, the stations report every 15 minutes to the Salt River Project after certain specific criteria are 18 met. During the critical period of the storm on October 1, the Salt River Project downlink was out of service from 7:00 a.m. to about 8:30 p.m. due to computer problems. Valuable data were lost and not avail- able to hydrologists concerned with problems of river flooding. In addition to problems of acquiring data and information on precip- itation and flood flows, there existed problems of communication and understanding. In evaluating their performance during the emergency, officials of Pima County admitted that their efforts could not be given superior grades but blamed part of the problem on inconsistent state- ments from the National Weather Service. As can be seen from the excerpts in the preceding text, this \"passing of blame\" was unjusti- fied. From 6:00 p.m. on September 29 until midnight on October 5, the Tucson NWS Office issued 20 warnings and statements, of which 13 were radar-generated updates. In the same period the Phoenix NWS Office issued 28 warnings, watches, and statements, of which nine were flood warnings generated by the Joint Federal-State Flood Warning Office. Weather statements and radar updates reflect observed conditions and vary with those conditions. Watches and warnings are subjective evalua- tions of meteorologic and hydrologic conditions occurring during the event. The consistency of such issuances depends on the available data and on the timing of their release. Use of weather watches and warnings by the public and by public officials requires that they understand them and that they understand reasons for what seem to be inconsistent state- ments and warnings. All statements and forecasts of the National Weather Service are transmitted to users by the NOAA Weather Wire and by NAWAS (the National Warning System). The former is a statewide hardcopy teletype system to users. At the time of the Tucson storm, it included only three of five TV stations and none of the radio stations in the Tucson area. However, the Weather Wire was relayed to the two Tucson newspapers (the Tucson Citizen and the Arizona Daily_Star) by the press-wire facilities of the Phoenix offices of the Associated Press and United Press International (incidentally, these organizations relay such issuances to subscribers of their radio services). The NAWAS voice transmissions went to all sheriffs' offices and other public safety agencies in the state. Thus the amount of information transmitted appears to have been sufficient for the public and the officials appointed and elected to care for their safety to have been well aware of the scope and extent of the disaster. There is a national program to provide warning of impending dis- asters--the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). However, activating this system was not possible because no primary EBS station had been desig- nated in the Tucson metropolitan area and the only radio station that had volunteered to fill this gap was not on the Weather Wire and so did not receive EBS activation requests. Although several flood warnings from the Phoenix NWS Office were headlined EBS REQUESTED, they were not implemented. The Pima County Emergency Services Director was quoted in Tucson's Arizona Daily Star of October 12, 1983, as saying, \"We just didn't see the need for activating the EBS system.\" NOAA Weather Radio provided the best source of information about the progress of the storm to the agencies in the Tucson area that used it to 19 monitor the weather conditions affecting their operations. According to Dave Williams in Tucson's Arizona Daily Star of October 7, 1983, \"On Saturday, the best electronic sources of information about the flooding were the NOAA weather broadcasts.\" Although the forecasts issued by the National Weather Service in Tucson during this storm episode were accurate and timely, problems did occur within the agency. Once the storm was in progress, many of the systems and networks used to measure precipitation and runoff malfunc- tioned, making it impossible to have a clear picture of the series of events that occurred during the storm. In addition, it is difficult for a National Weather Service Office such as that at Tucson, which had only one or two individuals answering the phones, making observations, and handling other station duties, to respond to all of the demands placed on it during an emergency period. Reasons for this are not entirely clear, but some of the problems clearly relate to a lack of manpower. In addition, there evidently were no policies on the retention and analysis of data during and after the storm. In the past it has been customary for both the Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service to investigate weather events of this magnitude. Only the Bureau of Reclamation Flood Office out of the Denver Federal Center was critically interested and involved in meteorological analysis of this storm episode. As the events associated with this storm and flood show, the responsibility for particular kinds of analysis of events during and after weather-related disasters needs to be clearly defined. Lack of understanding of interagency responsibilities is a continuing problem. For example, at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, October 3, the Phoenix NWS Office stated, \"The [San Carlos] reservoir is expected to begin spilling later Tuesday afternoon.\" In fact, spilling began about 1:30 p.m. that Tues- day. However, officials of the Arizona State Division of Emergency Ser- vices said in a press release issued Monday evening that they expected San Carlos to spill about midnight that night based on estimates of the State Department of Water Resources. When questioned about this dif- ference of opinion, State Emergency Services personnel said that because people would have to be evacuated, they preferred to take the sooner rather than the later time--a difference of about 18 hours! It would seem that these two forecasts (the former official and the latter not official) did not lend credence to public releases. RECOMMENDATIONS Additional efforts are needed to coordinate the work of the various agencies involved with disasters before, during, and after the events. Both state and federal agencies charged with coordinating the acquisi- tion and analysis of meteorological and hydrological data must exert stronger leadership to ensure cooperation of all existing agencies within the affected areas. Some other topics that need attention are listed below. 20 1. Safeguardi g Flood Data and Information If the Federal Emergency Management Agency is to continue to be the lead agency in disaster mitigation efforts, there needs to be a clearer statement of the duties and responsibilities of NWS personnel during and after severe weather events so that the National Weather Service's contribution to the.analysis of events can be clearly defined. During an event, efforts should be made to acquire and retain all data and information essential to understanding and analyzing it. These mater- ials should be retained until needed by hazard investigators. The originals could be kept by the cognizant NWS office for a specified period of time, such as five years, after which they should be appro- priately archived. 2. Investigation of Meteorological Conditions Each major severe meteorological event should be investigated thoroughly by the cognizant local forecast office of the National Weather Service. These investigators should be assisted by such additional experts as are needed from the regional forecast offices. This analysis should be the basis for reports used by other local and federal agencies. It is an inefficient use of tax dollars to have each event handled on an ad hoc basis, with many federal agencies conducting an analysis of the meteoro- logical conditions contributing to a natural disaster. 3. Issuance of Disaster Warnings If the disaster or potential disaster is related to weather., then the National Weather Service should have sole responsibility for issuance of watches, warnings, and statements about existing and expected conditions to the public. This is true even in gray areas such as the collapse of dams weakened by rains or overtopping of dams because of excessive river flow. 4. Acquisition of Meteorological Data During Events Local offices of the National Weather Service should encourage coopera- tive observers to report more faithfully on weather conditions during severe storm events. Also, ways need to be found to ensure redundancy in automatic systems so that data can be obtained under inclement weather conditions. 5. Communication of Warnings to the Public Although NOAA Weather Radio appeared to operate effectively during the Tucson flood episode, too few people are aware of this service. During severe weather episodes it is essential that all electronic media make 21 full use of all available information. Local radio stations could, for example, retransmit NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts. Additionally, local television stations, staffed with professional meteorologists, could rebroadcast NWS radar pictures and explain them to the public at the same time that they are presenting verbatim the latest NWS advisories on the air. 6. The Tropical Connection Episodes of extensive, heavy precipitation have their origins south of the U.S.-Mexico border. To give American citizens adequate warning of these events, better cooperative programs should be developed with the states of northwestern Mexico to monitor and record weather events. Two specific suggestions are (1) the extension of the Automatic Hydrologic Observation System (AHOS) managed by the U.S. Geological Survey and (2) the establishment of a cooperative surface observation program with the state of Sonora or the government of Mexico so that severe storms may be monitored on their way across Sonora. 7. Cooperation Among Local, State, and Federal Agencies During a major weather-related disaster, officials charged with public safety and emergency services should have coordination representatives of their agencies at the local offices of the National Weather Service. These representatives should be trained and knowledgeable in the opera- tions of the National Weather Service and understand the significance and degree of reliability of the various forecasts issued by the local forecast office. They should be able to translate the various issuances of the National Weather Service into statements about the potential impact of severe weather events on their operations. 3 GEOMORPHOLOGY AND HYDROLOGY DRAINAGES IN THE TUCSON BASIN Tucson is located in a topographic basin bounded by the Santa Catalina and Tortolita Mountains to the north, the Rincon Mountains to the east, the Santa Rita Mountains to the south, and the Tucson Mountains to the west (Figure 9). The principal watercourses in this basin collect drainage from and flow between these ranges. Like many desert mountain masses, those near Tucson have broad piedmont surfaces extending at fairly uniform slopes of 10 to 30 m/km away from much steeper mountain fronts. These piedmont surfaces may be erosional bedrock surfaces, called pediments, or they may be mantled by fan gravels and dissected by deep washes. The ephemeral streams of the piedmont areas convey water and sediment from the mountain fronts to the valley floors in the basin during occasional rainstorms. Coarser gravel and boulders are deposited mainly on the piedmont, while the finer fraction of the load, including sand, silt, and clay, are conveyed to the valley floors. The Santa Cruz River begins in the San Raphael Valley along the border with Mexico. The river flows south into Sonora and turns abruptly west and north to reenter the United States east of Nogales. The channel extends northward through Tubac and Green Valley to reach the downtown portion of Tucson. Through much of Tucson the Santa Cruz is deeply entrenched into the sediments of the valley floor. The Santa Cruz drains about 5,800 km2 to the south of Tucson, including large piedmont surfaces extending from mountains on the east and west sides of its valley. Sediments transported to Tucson are mostly fine sand and silt. Northwest of downtown Tucson the Santa Cruz River is joined by the Rillito system, which drains about 2,400 km2 to the north and east of Tucson. The Rillito flows about 20 km along the northern boundary of the city at the base of an extensive piedmont extending from the Cata- lina Mountains. In northeast Tucson the Rillito is split into two major tributaries, Tanque Verde Creek and Pantano Wash (Figure 10). Pantano Wash collects drainage from extensive areas to the southeast and tra- verses a long section of basin floor. Because of its length, sediment sizes become relatively fine where Pantano Wash reaches Tucson. In contrast, Tanque Verde Creek transports a relatively coarse load from the nearby Santa Catalina and Rincon Mountains. The coarse sand of Tanque Verde Creek mixes with the finer Pantano sediments to give the 22 23 MARANA TORTOLITA /0 MTNS SANTA CATALINA MTNS Z ORTARO INA RD CW ro UE ROE SPEEDWAY BLV'D\\ TUCSON'l MTNS RINCON MTNS SAN XAVIER MISSIONO '@'M, RTINEZ HILL /0 SIERRITA SANTA MTNS RITA GREEN Z' MTNS VALLEY *CONTINENTAL /110 N Ce, 100 RhjEo?

Rillito an intermediately coarse sand load, which is then conveyed to the Santa Cruz River, which transports fine sediments. These sediment load characteristics play an important role in the adjustment of the different streams to changing flow conditions. About 2 km north of the confluence of the Rillito, the Santa Cruz is joined by the Canada del Oro. This stream drains about 660 km2 from the western slopes of the Santa Catalina Mountains and eastern slope of the Tortolita Mountains. GEOMORPHIC HISTORY OF TUCSON DRAINAGE COURSES Floods are usually defined by the damage they do. The flow of water in a stream channel, as studied by hydrologists, is not considered a flood unless it rises sufficiently to cause damage and disruption. In gen- 25 eral, flood hazard management emphasizes the economic consequences of rising water levels. Another view of floods emphasizes their association with the river, the valley, and the valley lands adjacent to the river. This geologic perspective on floods (Moss et al., 1978) is not often incorporated into flood hazard management. In the humid temperate portions of the United States, river channels generally occur within a bottomland surface that is created by the river itself. The river occasionally overtops its banks, carrying and depositing sediment on that surface. This surface is the geologic floodplain of the river. The hazard zones of such rivers show close correlation to this geologic floodplain, since it is inundated relatively frequently. Shallow water might cover it with a 50 percent chance each year, and deep flows with a depth roughly equal to twice the channel bank heights might occur with a 2 percent chance per year (Moss et al., 1978). The above experience has little applicability to ephemeral sand-bed streams in valley bottomlands of the arid and semiarid West. Streams in that environment may flow directly on broad, low valley floors with little or no channel. In that case every flow event could cause damage, especially as the threads of flow shift on a depositional surface. The contrasting extreme is the incised channel, where the stream has cut through the former bottomlands so deeply that even very rare high flows will not spill out of the incised banks. Both the above conditions may occur on the same stream, either at different localities at a given time or at different times at the same locality. The management of flows in such an environment cannot ignore the geologic complexities of the system. Experience gained in the Tucson flood of 1983 will illustrate this conclusion. The general channel configurations and cross-sectional shapes on valley floors in the Tucson area today derive from a history of arroyo cutting in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Similar histories are prevalent throughout the southwestern United States, and considerable controversy surrounds attempts to provide a general explanation of the phenomenon (Cooke and Reeves, 1976). At Tucson an extensive historical record allows a precise reconstruction of events associated with the transition of the Santa Cruz from an alluviated valley floor to a narrow,, steep-sided channel (Betancourt and Turner, in press). Prior to the major flood of August 1890, the.Santa Cruz River exhibited perennial flow at several reaches near Tucson (Figure 11). The generally high water table intersected the valley floor at these locations and maintained the flow through perennial springs. Two springs upstream of San Xavier Mission, Agua de la Mision and Punta de Agua, served to irrigate fields at the mission. Near such springs small marshes, or cienegas, developed, with lush vegetation, fish, and beaver locally. Reaches between the spring outflows, amounting to 75 percent of the river course in the Tucson Basin, were ephemeral because of infiltration into the dry, sandy riverbed. These reaches were generally marked by shallow swales. However, local sections did have short dis- continuous gullies with vertical banks up to 3 m high and 20 m apart. During the 1880s this system began to reflect a profound human im- pact. Various impoundment and diversion structures were introduced to 26 EXPLANATION :R.13E.JR.l4E.'::::: 0- Pre- 1900 spring, now dry ......

In 1888 a major ditch was constructed by Sam Hughes near the present St. Mary's Road to intercept underflow in the Santa Cruz alluvium. In October 1889 a relatively small flood cascaded into Hughes' ditch, forming a headcut, or nickpoint. A major flood in July-August 1890 caused this headcut to work its way upstream approximately 4 km to a small impoundment at a former cienega called Silver Lake (Figure 11). The valley floor of the Santa Cruz was now incised with an arroyo about 30 m wide. The headcut continued to recede with each flow event until by 1910 it had reached Martinez Hill. In the winter of 1914-15 the Santa Cruz experienced several pro- longed floods that significantly widened the channel through bank erosion. The Arizona Daily Star on February 1, 1915, recorded the erosion of the east abutment to the Congress Street bridge by bank erosion through meander migration (Figure 12): Sudden destructive tendencies developed in the flood that swept down the Santa Cruz River yesterday morning and from 10 o1clock until noon the river rapidly washed away a large section of valuable land enclosed within a wide curve on the east side of the stream just south of the Congress Street road and con- taining five or more acres, finally about noon destroying more than a hundred and fifty feet [45 m] of embankment that con- nected Congress Street with the east approach to the bridge. . . . The work of destruction was continued steadily, but more slowly throughout the afternoon and by midnight the rushing water was creeping at the outside of the curve close to the row of cottages just east of the big concrete irrigation ditch and threatening to include the houses in the ruin. While the river did not rise any higher, it developed a terrific boring power that rapidly crumbled the soft dirt into the swirling current of the muddy Santa Cruz. The current worked with telling effect on the sandy subsoil of the rich arable land of the bottom and the total damage is estimated to be not less than $50,000 at midnight. The east approach to the bridge was swept away leaving 200 feet [60 m] of water between the road and the bridge. The piers of the bridge itself also sank. . . . The sudden driving force that the stream acquired in the morning rendered useless the protective measures taken and there was little that could be done through the day to protect the embankment.. Foot after foot went out and by mid- night it was estimated that the gap between the bridge and the east end of the road was more than 200 feet [60 m). With minor changes this description could apply to damage at bridges in the flood of October 1983. After the floods of 1914-15 the Santa Cruz continued to incise upstream of Martinez Hill (Figure 11). By the 1930s a headcut had migrated from Agua de la Mision up an artificial channel built in 1913 to join the west and east branches of the,stream. During the 1920s and the 1930s the incised river near Congress Street began to aggrade. The 28 @'4 J FIGURE 12 Erosion damage to the east abutment of the Congress Street bridge on February 1, 1915. The view is upstream (south), and Sentinel Peak (\"A\" Mountain) is visible at right. The gap of 60 m from the bridge to the east bank (left in picture) resulted from the downstream migration of a meander bend on that bank. This meander bend was visible in a 1902 photograph (Betancourt and Turner, in press). Source: Arizona Historical Society, Tucson. aggradation probably resulted from the decreased velocities achieved by the channel widening in 1914-15, from the stabilizing effect of cotton- woods and other riparian vegetation, and from the lack of major winter floods in this period. Because of their relatively low sediment loads (in contrast to summer floods), winter floods are particularly erosive for the sand-bed streams of southern Arizona. Starting in 1950 the Santa Cruz through Tucson was modified by artificial narrowing through landfill operations and by highway con- struction. The reach from Martinez Hill to Congress Street had been straightened in 1935 by the efforts of the Works Progress Administra- tion. Flows were deflected from severe bends by means of revetments. The result of these changes was renewed downcutting by higher-velocity flows through the straightened and constricted channel. The zone of aggradation moved downstream, past all the urbanized reaches, to the far northern end of the Tucson Basin. The Rillito system had an early history similar to that of the Santa Cruz. From a condition in 1858 that included beaver dams along a broad 29 N, MA -valley floor, the stream had incised to a wide channel with vertical banks by 1890. The change was attributed by Smith (1910) to cutting of vegetation, overgrazing by cattle, and flood erosion. Channel incision continued into the twentieth century as excessive withdrawal of ground water eliminated riparian vegetation along stream banks and bars. Studies of aerial photographs since 1941 show that the Rillito- Pantano-Tanque Verde system has been characterized by prolonged periods of channel narrowing locally interrupted by abrupt periods of widening with attendant bank erosion (Figure 13; Pearthree, 1982). Narrowing from 1941 until 1965 occurred during an interval dominated by short- duration floods with peaks less than 300 m3/s. Most of these flows occurred in the summer and early fall, and they probably transported very high sediment loads. In 1965 a large winter storm produced a prolonged flood that peaked at about 350 m3/s for Tanque Verde Creek and the Rillito. This flood carried a relatively low sediment load and generated extensive bank erosion for both stream channels. In contrast, Pantano Wash did not experience this flood and continued to narrow. After the 1965 event both Tanque Verde Creek and the Rillito dis- played either natural recovery or local artificial stabilization. In December 1978 another major winter storm affected these streams. As in 1965, this event, which peaked at 464 m3/s in the Rillito, was char- acterized by prolonged duration and a relatively low sediment load. In addition, a flow in March 1978 had removed much of the sediment that had accumulated in the stream channels during the preceding recovery period. Extensive bank erosion occurred during a three-day period of flow. Channel realignment, bank protection, and bridge repair after the 1978 flood led to the general condition of the Rillito-Tanque Verde- Pantano system immediately prior to the 1983 flood. 30 Jak A6\"aL wS limp 11 -111 Ov *kk' F 0- @3 071* 7 77 'Ie FIGURE 13 View upstream (east) from the Campbell Avenue bridge on October 1, 1983, showing erosion of the north (left) bank by meander flow.

It is clear that the streams of the Tucson Basin have been irrevers- ibly altered from conditions that prevailed prior to large-scale human intervention. A return to the channel characteristics of the 1800s is impossible for the following reasons: (1) groundwater overdraft has so lowered the water table that the stabilizing influence of riparian vege- tation has been lost, (2) the urbanization process has reduced the in- flux of sediments from tributaries into the main channels while in- creasing the influx of water from individual storms, and (3) channels have been constricted by bridges, filling on banks, and revetment works. 31 HYDROLOGIC ASPECTS'OF THE 1983 FLOOD The flood peak on the Santa Cruz River at Cortaro occurred between 8:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 1, and 9:00'a.m. on Sunday, October 2 (H. W. Hjalmarson, U.S. Geological Survey, personal communication, 1983). Peak flood discharges have been provisionally estimated for several local- ities in the Tucson Basin (Table 4). Extensive bank erosion resulted in the losses of gages on major watercourses, but postflood hydraulic calculations are being used to determine flood peaks. Final estimates, hydrographs from undamaged gages, and detailed interpretation are still being generated by the U.S. Geological Survey. However, several con- clusions concerning 'flood frequency seem warranted at this preliminary point. The Santa Cruz River peaked at 1,490 m3/s (52,700 cfs) at Congress Street. This event exceeds by more than a factor of two any other flood recorded at that station. It exceeds by a factor of 1.75 the magnitude of the 100-year flood designated in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Study (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1982). Even more important is the fact that the FEMA flood magnitudes were adjusted upward from the standard procedures. The problem of estimating a true recurrence interval for this event will be treated below. The Rillito also had an extreme flood (Figure 13), esti- mated at 840 m3/s (29,700 cfs). The FEMA-determined return period for this event would be between 50 and 100 years. In contrast to the Santa Cruz and Rillito, other streams in the Tucson area had floods that were much less extreme in relation to past experience. The Canada del Oro at Overton Road had a peak flow of 185 m3/s (6,600 cfs), as estimated by the U.S *Geological Survey. This compares with the 10-year flood estimate of 280 m3/s (10,000 cfs), which the federal Flood Insurance Study for the Pima County Department of Transportation and Flood Control District used as the regulatory flood. Pantano Wash peaked at 310 m3/s (11,000 cfs), which is between the 10-year discharge of 250 m3/s (9,000 cfs) and the 25-year dis- charge of 400 m3/s (14,000 cfs). The record flow of Pantano Wash at Broadway was 570 m3/s (20,000 cfs) in 1958. The annual flood.peaks of the Santa Cruz River have been recorded at the Congress.Street bridgesince 1915. @In the period 1915 to 1981 (Figure 14), 73 percent of all annual peaks occurred during July and August, 18 percent occurred.dur,ing September and October, and 9 p@rcent occurred during November through February. No annual peak flows have been recorded,in March, April,.May,,,or June. A standard log-Pearson III analysis of this record is,,shown.in@Figure 15., This plot was derived according to standard.procedureg,followed throughout the United States (U.-S. Water R6sources-Council,1981). Thi.s plot estimates the 100-year flood as about 650 m3/s (23,000 cfs), only half the magnitude of the 1983 flood. By this analysis the return period of the 1983 flood would be more than 1,000 years. This is beyond the frequency of events that are considered in usual hazard management. 32 TABLE 4 Estimated Flood Peak Discharges and Recurrence Intervals for the 1983 Tucson Flood Provisionally Estimated Dischargea 100-year Flood Dischargeb Locality cfs m3/s cfs M-3/s Santa Cruz at Congress Street 52,700 1,490 30,000 850 Santa Cruz at Cortaro 65,000 1,840 40,000 1,130 Rillito at Flowing Wells 29,700 840 32,000 900 Canada del Oro at Overton Road 6,600 185 28,000 800 Pantano Wash at Broadway 11,000 310 25,000 700 aH.

The plot was derived according to the nationally mandated procedure (UoS. Wa- ter Resources Council, 1981). Most standard techniques for estimating the recurrence probabilities of flood events assume a stationary mean (U.S. Water Resources Council, 1981). This means that the methods presume a flood history has been extracted from a river whose hydrologic characteristics have not changed over the period of measuremento Clearly this assumption does not apply to the Santa Cruz flood record (Figure 14). From 1915 to 1960 no flood occurred that exceeded 340 m3/s (12,000 cfs), but since 1960 there have been six such events (including the 1983 flood). Moreover, this change in flood behavior has occurred on a river whose channel has experienced profound morphological change since about 1890. Even more important are probable climatic factors. Note that the big floods since 1960 are predominantly fall and winter events (September through Feb- ruary), as they were in the period 1915 to 1929. However, the smaller annual peaks of 1916 to 1960 are nearly all summer events (July and August). The nature of the storm systems responsible for the flood peaks are clearly different during the latter period of recordo Accelerated channel change and,climatic shifts are probable factors in many watersheds throughout the arid and semiarid western United 34 States. This invalidates the assumption of a stationary mean that is almost universally applied to flood-frequency analyses in these water- sheds. It follows that this also invalidates land-use zoning based on nationally mandated flood-frequency-analytical procedures that are indiscriminately applied to the arid and semiarid West. As shown in the next section, the most important geomorphic aspect of the streams in the Tucson Basin is their tendency to alter their cross-sectional shape in response to changes in water and sediment influxes. The streams experience such rapid and large responses to changing conditions that erroneous hazard zonation can arise from conventional engineering hydraulic-hydrologic calculation procedures. For example, these procedures predict the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood in a particular stream channel by assuming that the geometry or position of the channel does not change significantly prior to, during, or after the flood. This assumption is almost always incorrect'for the ephemeral stream channels in alluvial basins of semiarid regions. Indeed, the bank erosion of such streams generally presents a hazard to property that exceeds the hazard of damage from floodwater alone. AN OVERVIEW OF FLOOD EROSION AND DEPOSITION To assess the regional effects of the Tucson flood, a team of University of Arizona geosciences students surveyed the postflood changes in water- courses throughout the Tucson Basin (Figure 16). The detailed maps of their results are presented in Appendix B. This section briefly sum- marizes those observations.' Because incomplete bank protection was found to be a major factor in localizing bank erosion, a separate section is devoted to that issue. At Martinez Hill the incised meander train of the Santa Cruz River encounters a bedrock obstruction (Figure 17). Flow is deflected by the obstruction, inducing pronounced bank erosion. Despite extensive riprap revetments, two bridges were lost at this site (Figure 17). The west- ward meander migration along San Xavier Road was a direct result..of the natural deflection of flow by Martinez Hill. Approximately 2 km downstream of Martinez Hill, at the junction with Santa Clara (Hughes') Wash, the Santa Cruz.was modified by a meander cutoff in 1935. This improvement attempted to prevent bank recession by meander migration. The 1983 flood produced extensive erosion in the vicinity of the island created by this cutoff (see Map 1, Appendix B). About 30 m of bank recession occurred on both sides of the artificial cutoff channel. Erosion upstream of the cutoff threatened a city sewer line crossing. After the flood a levee was constructed in the channel to divert flows into the original Santa Cruz meander to lessen the rate of future bank recession near the sewer line. Downstream of Santa Clara Wash in the vicinity of Valencia Road, the character of the Santa Cruz changes from a broad shallow arroyo, about 200 to 400 m wide, to a deep narrow arroyo about 100 m wide. Bank ero- sion was less here because mature mesquite vegetation added stability with its deep root systems.

Damage to the north abutment.of the north- bound lane bridge of Interstate 19 is visible at center. As the flow meandered to the west'bank, it eroded the west abutment of the San Xavier Road bridge (top center). Bank erosion extended through the former intersection of San Xavier Road and the ac- cess road to Interstate 19 at left center. Note the blocks of collapsed bank material on this bank. Riprap placed along this bank failed to prevent meander migration in the 1983 flood. Photograph by Peter Kresan. meander bend was protected by 100 m of riprap revetment. Nearly all of this was destroyed during the flood because bed scour undermined the revetment. Approximately 3 m of bank erosion occurred at the,bend. Immediately downstream of the protected meander bend, an unprotected bend experienced approximately 40 m of bank recession on its cutbank. The increased erosion at this site is directly related to the protected banks upstream. Approximately 400 m downstream of Irvington Road, the diversion channel of the West Branch of the Santa Cruz River joins the Santa Cruz@ main channel. The diversion channel was constructed to lower flood 37 stages at the Midvale Farms subdivision, which lies immediately west of' the Santa Cruz River between Drexel and Irvington roads. A concrete drop structure on the West Branch is used to control the gradient change at the confluence, and soil-cement revetments were used to protect chan- nel banks at the confluence. the flood peak in the West Branch is estimated at 85 m3/s (Brian Reich, City of Tucson, personal communi- cation, 1983). Bank erosion opposite and downstream from these revet- ments was especially pronounced, averaging about 30 m of recession (Figure 18). North of Ajo Way an alternating pattern of meander bend erosion continued through an unprotected reach to 29th Street (see Map 2, Appendix B). Between 29th Street and 22nd Street, former meander bends of the Santa Cruz are protected by unsorted debris and/or riprap. Bank erosion occurred at all these bends during the 1983 flood. It was most pronounced where unsorted debris was undermined by scour. North of 22nd Street to St. Mary's Road the Santa Cruz River is nearly completely confined within artificial banks. The landfill operations near downtown Tucson (Betancourt and Turner, in press) have reduced the stream to a relatively straight channel averaging 50 m in width. This reach is channelized with soil-cement revetment on both banks. Flood discharges through this reach were confined within these artificial banks. Where protected by soil cement, banks were generally unaffected by the flood flows (Figures 19A and 19B). Confinement of flooding to a narrow cross section and reduction of sediment load in the flow because of the protected banks resulted in general bed degradation throughout this reach. Downstream of Speedway Boulevard the Santa Cruz River channel widens and becomes more sinuous. The 1983 flood caused considerable erosion on the cutbanks of meander bends. Near Grant Road an old sanitary landfill was intercepted by bank recession, spilling refuse into the active streambed. The piecemeal bank protection in this reach showed consid- erable failure, in contrast with the reach of continuous bank protection lining the channel upstream of St. Mary's Road. At Fort Lowell Road the sinuosity of the Santa Cruz decreases, and bank erosion by the 1983 flood was less severe than immediately upstream (see Map 3, Appendix B). Some of the stability of this reach can be attributed to riparian vegetation in the channel. Growth of the vege- tation was facilitated by an influx of sewage effluent from a treatment plant. Shallow overbank flooding and deposition occurred in this reach. Downstream of Ruthrauff Road the Santa.Cruz showed a major change in character. The channel banks were so stabilized by vegetation that they were unable to enlarge to convey the floodflows. Floodwater spilled on to the adjacent floodplain surface. A secondary channel with a headcut developed on this surface. The width of inundation near Sunset Road was approximately 400 m (Figure 20). Even greater spreading of the floodflows occurred downstream of the Rillito confluence (see Map 4, Appendix B). Large sand and gravel pits and the Pima County sewage treatment-facility are immediately adjacent to the channel. Most of these facilities are along the east banks, with various types of revetments serving to protect that bank. Erosion from the 1983 flood was concentrated on the unprotected west banks. 0. lb tn m i-h tm m :I m 0 \" H .4 0. .4 0 0 0 m m rt 19 (-' 0 @- x \"I :c o @.h lb 0 m @L oz 3'. m -4mr QQ 0 1.4 rm Wq 0 mm- m o rt 0) M m :3--d 0 m Pt m M 3: (n 0 m 00 MO 0 Ic V:'N MZ 0 0.0 M 0 (D O'Q w 00 m m rt lb 0 0 pi n 'o m CL 0% 0 OWIDV4 'o M 1-h $b dr m 000 4f )()-YEAR Ft _00op CIS OD rt M 1-4 0 0 \"@%-47f K 1980) or) ov 0 M lk.,(NjAO *.z - A I IV 0 .......... ...................... .......... i_Am rt 0441t 0 m 0 m A 0 0.

METERS FIGURE 20 Map showing channel changes and FEMA floodplain designations along the Santa Cruz River near West Sunset Road. 41 At Ina Road spectacular erosion on the west abutment resulted in bank recession that exceeded the original channel width spanned by the Ina Road bridge (Figure 21). Extensive overbank flooding and deposition occurred downstream of this point. Much of Cortaro Road between the Santa Cruz and Interstate 10 was buried by overbank deposition. A relatively sinuous reach downstream of Cortaro Road was lined with riparian vegetation maintained by sewage effluent. The 1983 flood cut a straight channel through this section and deposited thick overbank sedi- ments to either side of the channel (Figure 22). Note that the Santa Cruz gradually changed to this behavior from an incised, eroding channel near Speedway Boulevard in which the 1983 floodflows were confined. At Marana (Figure 23) the flooding of the Santa Cruz became a broad shallow inundation over extensive valley floors. Damages to farmland in this region are not described in this report. Significantly, the char- acter of flooding downstream of this point was depositional (Figure 24). Sediment transported from the extensive areas of erosion upstream contributed to aggradation in this area. The aggradation, in turn, led to more extensive inundation. The buildup of sediment from past floods may have so increased slopes in this reach that a new headcut was initiated in the Santa Cruz valley near Picacho Peak (Figure 25). The postflood erosion survey also documented the behavior of the Rillito-Pantano-Tanque Verde system during the 1983 flood. Pantano Wash was quite interesting because a large drop structure at Broadway sepa- rates the system into an incised reach downstream, to the north of Broadway, and a less incised reach upstream, to the south of Broadway (see Maps 5 and 6. Appendix B). Bank erosion from the 1983 flood was minimal upstream of the drop structure. Exceptions were at a prominent meander bend (Figure 26) and at a sand pit north of Golf Links Road. Downstream of the Broadway drop structure, Pantano Wash is deeply incised. It responded to the 1983 flood by the alternating pattern of bank erosion described above for the Santa Cruz River system. Local areas of bank protection from riprap and wire fence revetment were effective in-shifting the concentration of this erosion to unprotected banks. At the downstream end of revetment works around the Tanque Verde Road bridge, a major zone of bank recession caused the loss of resi@ dential property. The upper reaches of Tanque Verde Creek, as with upper Pantano Wash, showed much less bank erosion in the 1983 flood than did entrenched reaches of the Rillito and the Santa Cruz River. Banks were suffi- ciently low that overbank flooding occurred at the Forty-Niners Country Club Estates. Major bank erosion appeared at the confluence of Sabino Canyon Creek and Tanque Verde Creek. This occurred because of (1) the angle of the stream juncture, which directed flows at an unprotected bank, and (2) changes in sediment loading that occurred as the two flows mixedo The second factor probably also explains the increased erosion that occurred immediately downstream of the confluence of Tanque Verde Creek and Pantano Washo 42 vT FIGURE 21 The Ina Road bridge over the Santa Cruz River on October 8, 1983, showing extensive erosion of its west abut- ment. Channel shifting to the west resulted in deposition at the former bridge cross section. Water spilling into the flooded gravel pit (right center) eroded large sections of the eastern approach road. Photograph by V. R. Baker. The Rillito from Craycroft Road to the Santa Cruz River is an entrenched system. _It responded to the 1983 flood by pronounced bank erosion following a pattern of meander bends, as allowed by piecemeal bank protection (see Map 7, Appendix B). From Swan Road to Dodge Road this erosion occurred in a reach that had little bank protection (Figure 27). A major bend at Prince Road resulted in migration of a meander cutbank during the 1983 flood-that undermined several houses and town- homes. The bridges at Campeell Avenue and First Avenue (Figure 28) suffered erosion of their northern abutments by meander migration. Many of these effects repeated the experience of floods in 1965 and 1978 (Pearthree, 1983). AN ASSESSMENT OF BANK PROTECTION It is clear that unprotected banks in the Tucson area suffered phenom- enal erosion during the flood of October 1983 (Figure 29). This hazard has been recognized for many years, and several types of bank protective works were in place at the time of the flood*(Table 5). Thus the flood 43 1r 41:t@i 417 FIGURE 22 View downstream (north) along the Santa Cruz River north of Pima Farms Road (foreground) on October 8, 1983. The sinuous bends lined with riparian vegetation developed from relatively continuous low discharges from a sewage treatment plant located approximately 5 km upstream of this point. The flood discharge carved a straighter course along the center of the low-flow meander trend. Also note the extensive sedimenta- tion in splay patterns to either side of the central flood channel. Interstate 10 runs diagonally across the top half of the photo,-and the Tortolita Mountains are visible on the skyline. Photograph by V. R. Baker. provided an excellent test of the performance of this protection. The maps of Appendix B document the spatial distribution of this protection in relation to bank erosion. The experience of the 1983 flood has shown that bank erosion was the most severe hazard encountered on the incised sections of stream chan- nels through the Tucson Basin. To assess the bank protection as a factor in reducing this hazard, two questions can be asked: (1) What was the engineering performance of different bank protection designs-- i.e., which designs effectively prevented bank erosion? (2) What was the overall effect of bank protection on the fluvial system? Both questions must be addressed, because.piecemeal bank protection can meet the needs of some individuals in protecting their property from bank erosion while the stream system as a whole requires consideration of comprehensive bank protection. 44 k FIGURE 23 View of Marana (center) looking south toward the Tucson Mountains on October 9, 1983. Floodflows in this area spread over extensive agricultural land and caused considerable damage. The prominent meander bend at Marana experienced severe erosion during the prolonged winter flood of 1978. In contrast, the much larger 1983 flood peak resulted in relatively little erosion on this bend. Photograph by Peter Kresan. Since 1974, the design of bank protective works in Pima County has required the approval of the Floodplain Management Section of the Pima County Department of Transportation and Flood Control District. Non- standard protective works, including cable-tied automobile bodies and rail, wire, and rock revetment, probably predate 1974 in most cases. The local effectiveness of the three types of bank protection involving engineering design can be seen by observing the banks of the Santa Cruz River along the 12.8-km reach from Speedway Boulevard to the junction of the Rillito. Riprap revetment was used to protect 2.6 km of bank; wire-fence revetment (with rock fill) was used for 0.5 km. Damage to riprap was more extensive during the 1983 flood. Scour into the streambed is facilitated at the junction between the riprap and the unprotected bed. The rock falls into the scour hole and is either transported downstream or buried in scour holes that develop downstream of individual riprap clasts. Over 80 percent of the study reach pro- tected by riprap showed at least some undercutting and bank recession. In contrast, the wire-fence revetment generally showed damage only on the upstream and downstream ends of protected banks. Scour at those sites caused banks to recede behind the revetments.

Saarinen. revetments were undamaged, although prominent erosion of banks occurred immediately downstream of the protection. The mode of destruction for wire-fence revetments was generally not by scour, as for unconfined riprap. Rather, progressive erosion at the upstream or downstream end of the revetment would scour behind the protected bank. In-extreme cases the former bank facing would be isolated in midchannel as the bank receded Away from it (Figure-30). Failure of soil-cement revetment: was observed at several local- ities. Inadequate keying of the soil cement to the upstream or down- stream terminus of the protection was the major cause of failure. At Prince Road and the Rillito, a prominent meander bend scoured behind the upstream end of a soil-cement revetment, resulting in major damage to a complex of townhouses (Figure 31). An example of a properly keyed revetment is the protection for the southeast abutment of the Sabino Canyon Road bridge over Tanque Verde Creek (Figure 32). The pronounced channel widening upstream of the revetment terminates abruptly at this key. Major bank erosion occurred immediately downstream of reaches that had been extensively protected with soil cement on both banks. An example is the reach of the Santa Cruz immediately downstream (north) of St.-Mary's Road.- Soil-cement revetments continuously line both banks of the Santa Cruz for nearly 2 km upstream of this point. Erosion appeared 50 TABLE 5 Types of Stream Bank Protection Observed in Watercourses of the Tucson Basin Type of Protection Description Soil-cement Embankment facing composed of 8 to 15 percent revetment portland cement mixed with natural bank material.

It was sufficiently intense to scour,the terminus of the soil-cement bank itself (Figure 34). The postflood erosion survey (Appendix B) found that severe erosion occurred at the downstream terminus of every protected bank along deeply incised reaches of the Santa Cruz and the Rillito. Clearly, piecemeal bank protective works concentrate areas of eroded as well as protected banks, and the erosive consequences of such protection should be considered in the overall management of the river system. The necessity of protecting bridges from loss during floods unavoid- ably generates a need for localized bank protection. As observed in the 1983 flood, the loss of a bridge most often occurs by bank recession at one abutment. The recession is generally associated with meandermigra- tion during the flood. To protect the bridge abutments, a reach both upstream and downstream must be lined with bank protection. The natural tendency of the stream in flood to widen its channel and incorporate added sediment load is thus impeded in the bridge reach. The stream will therefore attempt to scour the streambed at the bridge section, 51 T ;;c- 7@_ FIGURE 30 Erosion of bank protected by wire-fence revetment along the Rillito at Craycroft on October 10, 1983.

If degrada- tion control structures are placed on the bed to prevent scour, the bridge reach is transformed into a rigid-walled flume. High-velocity, sediment-impoverished floodwater passing through the protected bridge reach will be erosive in the reach immediately downstream. As in other examples, given several floodflow events, partial bank protection will beget the need for more bank protection. SAND AND GRAVEL OPERATIONS In southern Arizona it is a common practice to mine sand and gravel from active channels by excavating shallow pits in their beds (Bull and Scott, 1974). These operations move from place to place as local areas are depleted and flow events modify older workings. The effects of such gravel mining are extensive along the Rillito-Pantano-Tanque Verde system. The responses of a stream to the lowering of the bed at sand and gravel pits include the following: (1) upstream bed degradation, (2) bank sloughing near the pits, (3) bank erosion caused by temporary water diversion structures used to protect mining operations, and (4) down- stream bank erosion caused by the \"sediment trap\" action of some pits. 52 AWL--, nk V1 Q, -;, A@ -7 Ar.

Damage to the Pima Park Townhomes (center) occurred when the prominent meander bend at the bottom center migrated west (left) into the vacant property immediately upstream of the townhouses. This allowed erosion to occur behind the soil- cement bank protection lining the stream at the townhome pro- perty. The prominent point bar at the bottom center developed as the meander migrated westward. Photograph by V. R.

Photograph by V. R. Baker. The latter problem arises when a pit traps enough sediment entering its upstream end that the outflow from the pit is sediment impoverished and therefore erosive immediately downstream of the pit. Along the Santa Cruz River, extensive sand and gravel pits have been developed on the surface of the valley floor immediately adjacent to the entrenched channel of the river. At Ina Road a major pit contributed to the undermining of the approach road to the Santa Cruz bridge (Figure 21). A large abandoned sand pit on the Rillito occurs midway between Swan Road and Dodge Road (see Map 7 in Appendix B). The pronounced meander bend erosion downstream of this point, including the erosion of the nQrth abutment of the Dodge Road bridge, may be at least partly related to this sand pit (Figure 27). The specific changes in the river system described above for the Tucson flood of October 1983 are in keeping with the general long-term characteristics of southwestern streams, as outlined in the next section. STREAM CHANNEL STABILITY IN THE TUCSON BASIN Reports of the U.S. Geological Survey in the 1890s note that while runoff in Arizona is very low, at times floods occur whose violence and duration are phenomenal. This is still true. It is also true that no stream flowing north to the Gila River in Arizona or New Mexico has a permanent d"
