        "text": "Title: Votes for women\n\nDescription: Image of a violet circle with the text “Votes for women” in the middle of the circle.\n\nWhite women over the age of 21 who were Canadian citizens were granted the right to vote. It took another 40 years before all women in Canada were granted the same right.\n\nTitle: The Famous Five, 1930.\n\nDescription: Rt. Hon. W.L. Mackenzie King and guests unveiling a plaque commemorating the 5 Alberta women whose efforts resulted in the Persons Case, which established the rights of women to hold public office in Canada\n\nSource/credit: Library and Archives Canada/National Film Board of Canada fonds/a195432\n\n5 women who have since become known as the Famous Five launched a legal challenge that would mark a turning point for equality rights in Canada. Emily Murphy, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, Irene Parlby and Henrietta Muir Edwards were journalists, politicians, reformers and activists from Alberta who asked the Supreme Court of Canada to answer the following question: does the word “person” in Section 24 of the British North America Act include female persons? After 5 weeks of debate, the Supreme Court decided that the word “person” did not include women.\n\nTitle: \"Now That We Are Persons\" article by Nellie McClung.\n\nDescription: Photo of an article from Farm and Ranch Review, 2 January, 1930 (Vol XXV!, No. 1, pp.16), titled \"Now That We Are Persons\" written by Nellie McClung.\n\nSource/credit: Provincial Archives of Alberta, A17201\n\nThe British Privy Council declared that women are “persons” and could therefore be appointed to the Senate of Canada.\n\nTitle: Canadian Women's Army Corps (C.W.A.C.) Pipe and Brass Bands preparing to take part in C.W.A.C. anniversary march past Apeldoorn, Netherlands, 13 August 1945\n\nSource/credit: Library and Archives Canada/Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development fonds/a123915\n\nThe Canadian Women's Army Corps and the Royal Canadian Navy, Women's Division, were formed and over 45,000 women volunteers were recruited for full-time military service other than nursing.\n\nTitle: In Hiawatha Council Hall on occasion of federal by-election\n\nSource/credit: Library and Archives Canada/Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development fonds/a123915\n\nAll women in Canada were granted the right to vote in federal elections. Until the Canada Elections Act was enacted in 1960, First Nations women could not vote unless they had lost or given up their treaty rights and Indian status.\n\nTitle: Florence Bayard Bird\n\nSource/credit: Council on the Status of Women, Ottawa, Ont.: 1969 / PA-135131\n\nThe Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada was established and was the first Commission to be chaired by a woman, Florence Bird. The Commission’s mandate was to “inquire into and report upon the status of women in Canada, and to recommend what steps might be taken by the federal government to ensure for women equal opportunities with men in all aspects of Canadian society.”\n\nTitle: Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada / e010858739\n\nSource/credit: W. H. \"Bill\" Olson, Dominion-Wide Photographs Limited\n\nThe report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada was tabled in Parliament. It included recommendations on updating the legislative system and addressing such critical issues for women as poverty, family law, the Indian Act and the need for a federal representative for women.\n\nSource/credit: Canadian Labour Congress website\n\nDescription: A woman in the street with a sign in her hands during a protest. On the sign, you can read \"Working women have a right to paid maternity leave\".\n\nAmendments were made to the Canadian Labour Code to include the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status, the strong reinforcement of the principle of equal pay for equal work and the provision of 17 weeks of maternity leave.\n\nTitle: Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n\n© Government of Canada. Reproduced with the permission of Library and Archives Canada (2020).\n\nSource/credit: Library and Archives Canada/Robert Stacey fonds/e010758222\n\nWomen’s rights, ensuring equality before and under the law, were enshrined in the new Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nReclaiming Power and Place, the two-volume Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, was released on June 3, 2019. It called for transformative legal and social changes to resolve the crisis that has devastated Indigenous communities across the country."
