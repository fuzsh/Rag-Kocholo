        "text": "Key Dates in Bridge District History\n\n1846: Captain John Fremont declares California’s independence from Mexico and names the mile-wide entrance to the San Francisco Bay as Chrysopylae, which means Golden Gate in Greek.\n\n1849: The population of San Francisco explodes after gold is discovered in northern California. Once a village called Yerba Buena with a population of about 400, San Francisco is now a city of 35,000.\n\n1868: Regular ferry service links San Francisco and Sausalito in Marin County with the ferry vessel Princess. Land speculators claimed that Marin County real estate would increase in value due to its proximity to San Francisco. The ferry vessel Princess was owned by Sausalito Land and Ferry Company which gave free ferry passes to anyone that bought a lot in Sausalito.\n\n1869: Joshua Norton arrived in San Francisco in 1849. He is the son of an industrious London merchant and is determined to build a fortune in San Francisco. By 1869, a gone mad and bankrupted Gold Rush merchant, he declares himself Norton I, Emperor of the United States, and begins issuing decrees. San Franciscans tolerate him. He is the first to call publicly for the construction of bridges across the San Francisco Bay. He reigned as Emperor Norton until his death in 1880.\n\nJanuary 1870: Joseph Baermann Strauss is born in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\n1872: Railroad executive and entrepreneur Charles Crocker announces to the Marin County Board of Supervisors that Central Pacific Railroad engineers had prepared plans and cost estimates for a suspension bridge crossing the Golden Gate Strait that would also carry rail cars.\n\n1872: Bridge designer and theorist Leon Moisseiff is born in Latvia.\n\n1876: Charles Alton Ellis, the engineer who will one day be instrumental in the design calculations for the Golden Gate Bridge, is born in Maine.\n\nApril 18, 1906: San Francisco is devastated by a massive earthquake and fire.\n\n1915: The Panama Pacific International Exposition opens in San Francisco to celebrate the completion of the Panama Canal (a year after it opened).\n\n1916: James H. Wilkins, a former structural engineer and then newspaper editor for the San Francisco Call Bulletin, proposes a design for spanning the Golden Gate Strait. His articles generate some interest, but World War I differed further progress towards a bridge across the Strait.\n\n1918: Late in the year, Richard Welch, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, requests Congress to authorize that the federal government take soundings in the Golden Gate Strait, specifically in the channel separating the Marin peninsula and the Presidio in San Francisco.\n\n1919: San Francisco Board of Supervisors tell San Francisco City Engineer Michael O’Shaughnessy to proceed with the study of the feasibility of a bridge across the Golden Gate Strait.\n\nJanuary 1920: San Francisco City Engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy requests the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey to make soundings of the channel bottom. The U.S.S. Natoma completes the sounding of the channel in May 1920.\n\nMay 1920: O'Shaughnessy receives the Natoma's survey data. O'Shaughnessy consults engineers from around the country about feasibility and cost. Many say it cannot be done, and if it can be the cost would exceed $100 million. O’Shaughnessy writes a letter to three prominent engineers: Joseph B. Strauss in Chicago; Francis C. McMath, president of the Canadian Bridge and Iron Company in Detroit and leader in the construction of the Quebec Bridge; and Gustav Lindenthal, the man who engineered the 1,000-foot Hell Gate Arch over New York's East River in 1916. Strauss, who has designed nearly 400 spans, claims a bridge can be built, and it can be built for $25 to $30 million.\n\nJune 28, 1921: Joseph B. Strauss, working with his staff in Chicago, develops a hybrid structure with cantilever side spans with a suspension bridge between the ends of the two cantilevers. He submits preliminary sketches to O'Shaugnessy with a cost estimate of $27 million (Note: this cost estimate varies depending on the source from $17 million to $27 million).\n\nDecember 27, 1921: Strauss applies for a patent on the hybrid cantilever-suspension bridge plan with the US Patent Office. The patent (#1,453,084) is granted on April 24, 1923.\n\n1922: Michael O'Shaughnessy, Joseph B. Strauss, and Edward Rainey, a mayoral aide, propose the creation of a special political entity for the Golden Gate Bridge project.\n\n1922: Strauss adds Charles Ellis, professor of structural and bridge engineering at the University of Illinois, to his staff.\n\nDecember 7, 1922: Almost a year and a half after receiving Strauss's preliminary sketches, O'Shaughnessy makes the Strauss design public. (Note: this date reference is also listed as June 1922 as the date O’Shaughnessy presents the plan to the San Francisco City Council).\n\nJanuary 13, 1923 (we have seen this date published as January 15 also): An organization meeting of Bridging the Golden Gate Association, which was formed to promote Strauss’ plans for a bridge, is held in Santa Rosa, CA.\n\nMay 25, 1923: The California legislature passes the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District Act of California which was introduced by Senator Frank Coombs of Napa. The Association of Bridging the Gate is empowered to create a district to build the bridge.\n\nSpring 1924: As the owner of the land on both sides of the Golden Gate Strait, the federal War Department is the only entity that can authorize construction. San Francisco and Marin counties make a joint application to the War Department for a permit to build the Bridge.\n\nMay 16, 1924: Strauss submits his plans to the War Department for review. War Department officials are concerned about the possibility of a bridge hindering navigation and if adequate financing is available to build a bridge.\n\nDecember 24, 1924: Secretary of War John W. Weeks issues a temporary construction permit for the Bridge. (Note: This date is also listed in some records as December 20, 1924).\n\n1925: Strauss has Ellis send the hybrid cantilever-suspension bridge plans to two prominent engineers: George Swan at Harvard, and Leon Moisseiff, New York City for review. That same year, Strauss asks Moisseiff to submit to him a plan for a conventional suspension bridge.\n\nDecember 4, 1928: The Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District is incorporated as the entity to finance, design, and construct the Bridge. The District consists of San Francisco, Marin, Sonoma, Del Norte, and parts of Mendocino and Napa counties.\n\nJanuary 23, 1929: The Board of Directors of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District meet for the first time. William P. Filmer is elected president and Robert H. Trumbull of Marin county is elected vice president. Also, Alan MacDonald of San Rafael is appointed as general manager, W.W. Felt, Jr. of Santa Rosa is named secretary, John R. Ruckstell of San Francisco is named auditor, and George Harlan of Sausalito is appointed attorney.\n\nAugust 15, 1929: Joseph B. Strauss is appointed by the Board of Directors as chief engineer for the Golden Gate Bridge. Leon S. Moisseiff, O. H. Amman, and Charles Derleth, Jr. are named consulting engineers. Some sources show these appointments were also made on this date: Clifford E. Paine is named chief assistance engineer and Irving F. Morrow consulting architect.\n\nOctober 29, 1929: The stock market crashes and the Great Depression begins.\n\nDecember 9, 1929: Two dedication ceremonies were held to mark the start of borings for the Golden Gate Bridge tower piers at Fort Scott in San Francisco starting at 1pm, and two hours later on the Marin County side. Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss stated, “ This is a day of big projects, and the building of the Golden Gate Bridge ranks among the biggest. But, while we can scarcely exaggerate its importance, we must not exaggerate its difficulty. Building the structure, after all, is a simple engineering operation, every detail of which has been checked and calculated in advance. If praise is deserved by any, it is the men whose patience and enthusiasm made it possible for building to start…” San Francisco Supervisor Gallagher presided on the San Francisco side and Harry J. Ridgway, President of Marvelous Marin, Inc. presided on the Marin side.\n\nMarch 1, 1930: After overseeing test boring in San Francisco, Charles Ellis returns to Strauss Engineering offices in Chicago to start the preliminary design. Working long hours, and consulting via telegram with Leon S. Moisseiff in New York, Ellis computes dozens of factors involved in the Bridge design.\n\nMarch 12, 1930: Joseph Strauss presented this Report of Chief Engineer to the Board of Directors, for the period February 19 to March 12, 1930.\n\nSummer 1930: Strauss hires a local architect, Irving Morrow, to design an architectural treatment for the Bridge. Morrow will later be recognized for his aesthetic contributions – the Golden Gate Bridge's distinctive Art Deco lines, burnt red-orange hue, and the structure's dramatic lighting.\n\nAugust 11, 1930: The War Department issues a final permit for the construction of a suspension bridge with a 4,200-foot main span, a vertical clearance of 220 feet at midspan and a 210-foot clearance at the sidespans.\n\nAugust 27, 1930: Joseph B. Strauss submits his final plans for the Golden Gate Bridge to the District Board of Directors.\n\nNovember 4, 1930: Voters from the six counties that comprise the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District agree to a $35 million bond issue, using their homes, farms, vineyards, and business properties as collateral to support the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. The vote is 145,657 in favor and 46,954 against.\n\nFebruary 1931: Consulting Geologist A. E. Sedgwick publishes a Foundations of the Golden Gate Bridge report on a study to determine the competency of the foundation rock under the north and south peirs to carry an average load of 13 tons and maximum load of 18 tons per square foot.\n\nJuly 8, 1931: Lump sum bids received for the construction of the principal items of the Golden Gate Bridge show that the project can be completed within the estimated cost of $35 million.\n\nDecember 22, 1932: The contract for the Marin tower pier commences with the construction of a 1,700-foot-long road from the end of the existing road at Fort Baker to the location of the Marin tower pier, near the Lime Point Lighthouse.\n\nJanuary 5, 1933: Official start of Golden Gate Bridge construction.\n\nJanuary 1933 to June 1933: It took 6 months to build the Marin (north) tower pier.\n\nJanuary 1933 to May 1935: The San Francisco (south) anchorage was constructed.\n\nJanuary 1933 to June 1935: Marin (north) anchorage was constructed.\n\nFebruary 1933: Work begins on the east approach road through The Presidio.\n\nFebruary 15, 1933: Russell G. Cone is appointed resident engineer for the Golden Gate Bridge project.\n\nFebruary 26, 1933: The official ground breaking ceremony for the Golden Gate Bridge takes place at Crissy Field starting at 2 pm with a parade.\n\nAugust 14, 1933: The McCormick Steamship Line’s Sidney M. Hauptman, outbound to Portland, plowed through the thick fog and crashed into the newly completed access trestle extending 1,100 feet out into the Golden Gate Strait waters from the San Francisco shore, ready to start construction of the San Francisco tower fender.\n\nOctober 31, 1933: Construction of 5 of 22 sections of the San Francisco tower fender were completed when disaster struck the access trestle again. Swells from a Pacific storm battered the trestle and 3 of the 5 completed fender sections were swallowed up along with the end of the access trestle and the construction equipment.\n\nNovember 7, 1933: Steel plates laid at the Marin pier marking the start of the Marin tower construction.\n\nDecember 13, 1933: As a southwest gale beat the Bay Area for two days, the access trestle for the San Francisco tower fender construction was again battered; this time there was 800 feet of wreckage done to the access trestle.\n\nApril 1934: Ray Strong’s panoramic depiction of the Golden Gate Bridge under construction pays tribute to the feat of engineering required to span the Golden Gate Strait.

Shipping was to be held up for 15 minutes while bridge workers strung the first tramway cable between the San Francisco and Marin towers as part of the operations to ready the span for the construction of footwalks (catwalks) that had to be constructed before cable spinning could begin. Shipping would be held while a barge sunk a one-inch cable to the 350-foot bottom and the cable was hoisted into the air between the towers. Information is from the San Francisco News, August 1, 1935.\n\nSeptember 27, 1935: Catwalks (aka footwalks) completed in readiness for main cable spinning to begin.\n\nMarch 19, 1936: Start of construction of the Marin (north) approach viaduct structures.\n\nMay 20, 1936: According to the San Rafael Independent, the main cable spinning process was completed with the last cable wire going into place--next, the main cables would undergo cable compression, and already six cable compressors were loaded on the dock at Lime Point in readiness to start the operation.\n\nMay 22, 1936: Spinning of the two main cables is completed.\n\nJune 18, 1936: Start of the construction of the main suspended structure.

A brief and informal ceremony marked the occasion when groups from San Francisco and Marin met and exchanged remarks at the center of the span. Major Thomas L. McKenna, Catholic Chaplin of Fort Scott, blessed the span while sprinkling holy water. The November 20 date is noted on page 178 of Golden Gate Bridge, Report of the Chief Engineer, 1937.\n\nFebruary 17, 1937: 10 men lost their lives. While removing scaffolding from the underside of the roadway structure ten tons of timber tilted and fell into the safety net. There were 13 men on the scaffolding – one was able to jump off the net to a girder, 12 went down, 2 lived and 10 perished in the waters below.\n\nMarch 14, 1937: As reported in the San Francisco Chronicle, blame for the February 17 accident (noted above) in which 10 workmen lost their lives was assigned to two entities by an investigating committee appointed by the San Francisco Building Trades Council. One was that of the Pacific Bridge Company, which the committee says failed to heed warnings by State officials that the scaffold, which fell 250 feet into the bay, carrying the men to their deaths, was dangerous. The other was Chief Engineer Joseph B. Strauss, who was criticized for failure to prevent use of the scaffold. The investigating committee reported that warnings by the Industrial Accident Commission's Inspectors were not heeded and \"inexperienced laborers, ignorant of the hazard, were used to move the scaffold,\" the committee stated. \"It is the duty of Engineer Strauss to enforce terms of contracts. The affidavits of our brother workmen and the statements of Engineer Strauss, who, it is reported, will receive $1,000,000 for his services, show that Engineer Strauss failed to enforce the contracts in such manner as to prevent the use of the dangerous scaffolding.\"\n\nApril 19, 1937: Paving of the roadway deck is completed.\n\nApril 27, 1937: The Last Rivet Ceremony - A ceremony of completion was held at midspan. . With hundreds of on lookers, ironworker Edward “Iron Horse” Stanley, the man who had driven the first rivet on the Bridge, took his rivet gun and drove that rivet….and the golden rivet disintegrated right before everyone’s eyes.\n\nMay 27, 1937: Golden Gate Bridge opens to pedestrian traffic. When writing about Pedestrian Day the next day, San Francisco Chronicle reporter Wills O’Brien wrote, “A necklace of surpassing beauty was placed about the lovely throat of San Francisco yesterday.” View a YouTube video of Pedestrian Day here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sow_vHGdMXo.\n\nMay 28, 1937: Golden Gate Bridge opens to vehicular traffic at twelve o'clock noon, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressed a telegraph key in the White House to announce the event to the world. When FDR pressed the telegraph key, every fire siren in San Francisco and Marin was sounded, every church bell rang, ships sounded their whistles, and every fog horn blew. The Bridge opened ahead of schedule and under budget.\n\nMay 28, 1937: According to the San Francisco Chronicle, “Florentine Calegeri, striking houseman of the Palace Hotel, walked the bridge first on stilts, two ways – over and back. He thought it was a good idea”\n\nJanuary 1938: Visitor parking area opens adjacent to the toll plaza (GGBHD Annual Report FY37/38).\n\nMay 4, 1938: With the new commute toll rates in effect, the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District sold over 400 ticket books on May 4–the first day the books were available for sale. These new rates are: $8 for 40 single trips, or 20 cents per trip, good for car and driver for a 30-day period; $7 for 20 single trips, or 35 cents per trip, for car and five passengers, good for 60 days from date of purchase\n\nMay 27, 1938: One-Year Anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge. Written on the back of the photo: \"The Golden Gate Bridge celebrates first birthday. View of Warren Shannon, president of the Golden Gate Bridge & Highway District, blowing out candle on birthday cake. Festivities were held in “The Round House”, the new restaurant build at the Toll Plaza on the Bridge.”\n\nMay 27, 1938: The $10,000 Round House building was complete on the southeast side of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Round House was leased as a restaurant. The building was located as to offer customers an unexcelled panoramic view of the Golden Gate Bay and surrounding area. (GGBHD Annual Report FY37/38). According to the Marin IJ (2/17/2014), local civil engineer Alfred Finnila–who died in 2000–designed the Round House as a diner.\n\nJune 30, 1938: During the first full fiscal year, the Golden Gate Bridge serves 3,892,063 motor vehicles, carries more than 8,000,000 passengers, and in excess of 400,000 pedestrians walked the sidewalks (GGBHD Annual Report FY37/38).\n\nJuly 25, 1938: Southern Pacific-Golden Gate Ferries, Ltd. suspends operations between San Francisco (Hyde Street Pier) and Sausalito as a result of the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge (GGBHD Annual Report FY 38/39).\n\nOctober 1, 1938: Blackie, a 12-year-old horse, swam across the waters of the Golden Gate Strait. The horse not only made aquatic history, but he soundly defeated two human challengers from the Olympic Club, and won a $1000 bet for his trainer Shorty Roberts. Blackie made the swim in 23 minutes, 15 seconds. Shorty couldn't swim, but he made the trip, too - and this was part of the bet - by hanging onto Blackie's tail. A rowboat led the way, with Shorty's brother offering a handful of sugar cubes from the stern to keep the sweets-lovin' horse on track. Watch a short film made of the adventure about Blackie’s famous swim!\n\nSeptember 7, 1939: First fatality - Cyril McNear of San Francisco was the first person to die in a fatal accident on the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nFY 1938/1939: The largest item in the Golden Gate Bridge maintenance budget is for painting the steel. In FY 38/39, $112.431.84 was spent on painting: $86,589.13 on labor; $5,430.67 on brushes and tools; and $20,412.64 on paint (GGBHD Annual Report FY 38/39).\n\n1954: At age 40, one of the founding fathers of fitness, Jack LaLanne, proved his belief that “anything in life is possible if you apply yourself” by captivating the entire world when he swam the length of the Golden Gate Strait (approx 1.7 miles) with 140 pounds of equipment strapped to his body. A year later, he swam from Alcatraz Island to San Francisco while handcuffed.\n\nMarch 22, 1957: A 5.3 earthquake centered in Daly City hits the San Francisco Bay Area, resulting in no deaths but lots of damage. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, at about 11:45 a.m. on March 22, a \"twisting, jarring side-rolling motion\" caused skyscrapers in downtown San Francisco to sway visibly. People ran into the streets, some \"sobbing hysterically,\" and the Golden Gate Bridge \"undulated as in a fierce gale.\"\n\nMay 8, 1959: According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District had agreed to cooperate in the make-believe destruction of San Francisco on May 8 for Stanley Kramer's movie \"On the Beach” but the climax - a monumental traffic jam - in the early morning rush hour wasn't in the script. According to plans, the 15-person movie crew made its way onto the west sidewalk at 5 a.m. Cameras were to roll at sunrise (6:10 am), filming a submarine passing underneath the Bridge. But the sunlight could not pierce the morning fog. Navy men, with the film crew, contacted the submarine's captain and asked him to cruise around until the fog lifted. Soon it was 7 a.m. and the Marin County commuters were on their way to work.

Watch a video of their safe crossing HERE.\n\nJanuary 10-12, 2015: The Golden Gate Bridge became safer for drivers after the weekend of January 10, 2015, when a new Moveable Median Barrier (MMB) was installed that virtually eliminates the possibility of a head-on collision. The solid, semi-rigid barrier is made up of 3,517-interlocking steel and concrete units, each weighing 1500 pounds and standing 32 inches tall. To accommodate the narrow lanes on the Golden Gate Bridge, the Barrier was constructed to be just 12 inches wide. It replaces the yellow plastic pylons that had visually separated northbound and southbound traffic ever since lane management began in the early 1960’s. The Barrier cost $30 million to design and install, with $20 million provided by state funds through the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. The District held a ribbon cutting ceremony on January 11 at Vista Point. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Congresswoman Jackie Speier, crash survivor Dr. Grace Dammann, and Metropolitan Transportation Commissioners Steve Kinsey and Bob Alvarado all shared their support of the new barrier.\n\nDecember 2018: Construction Dive named the Suicide Deterrent System its 2018 Project of the Year and reported that it had the potential to reduce suicides that take place at the Golden Gate Bridge each year. When complete, the steel netting, positioned 20 feet below the Bridge's sidewalks, will extend out 20 feet on either side below the Bridge. More information can be found here.\n\nApril 27, 2018: Design for new toll gantry approved. The need for toll booths became obsolete with the introduction of electronic tolling on the Bridge in 2013, deeming the old toll gantry structure outdated. The District received public input on new toll gantry designs from architecture groups and interested individuals through small group meetings, social media posts, and input sent to our customer service center. After considering the input, the District Board of Directors selected the \"Bridge Light\" (pictured above) design by unanimous vote. The chosen 'Bridge Light' style mirrors the curved bend of the lighting elements on the Bridge and on Presidio Parkway. Regardless of the toll plaza changes, the beloved art deco clock will always have a place of honor at the Bridge.\n\nApril 30, 2018: The Bridge towers got their first arm's length inspection. For the first time, the Golden Gate Bridge towers received an up-close-and personal inspection by engineers rappeling by rope from the top to the bottom. The inspections began on Monday, April 30th and took a week to complete. The District contracted with HDR Engineering to conduct this work, which was done to examine the condition of the steel and determine necessary repairs. Here is a video of the inspections!\n\nJuly 2018: Construction on the Suicide Deterrent Net System begins. Project background and updates can be found here.\n\nApril 2019: Chief Engineer wins award for her seismic retrofit work. Ewa Z. Bauer-Furbush, P.E., M.ASCE, NAC, who was honored by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of four 2019 Outstanding Projects and Leaders (OPAL) award winners. Bauer-Furbush won the honor in the Management category and was recognized particularly for her leadership in seismic retrofit work.\n\nJuly 2019: West railing replacement begins as part of the Suicide Deterrent System (SDS) and Wind Retrofit Project. Beginning in February of 2019, contractors began work to remove and replace the west sidewalk handrail as part of the SDS and Wind Retrofit Project. Most noticeably, the new handrail features thinner vertical slats than the old handrail, along with other design elements to reduce wind drag, while blending in with the existing Bridge design. The new railing will be installed on the west sidewalk between the South and North Towers.\n\nMarch 2020: Bridge sees 70% drop in traffic almost overnight due to Shelter-in-Place orders during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nJune 2020: Golden Gate Bridge sings during high winds. On Friday, June 5, many people on and around the Bridge heard a humming sound coming from the Golden Gate Bridge. The sound is the result of sustained high winds coming from the northwest and passing at a specific angle through the recently installed new west sidewalk Bridge railing. This new railing is part of the Bridge Wind Retrofit project.\n\nJune 6, 2020: Black Lives Matter protest draws over 15,000 people to the Golden Gate Bridge and garnered much media attention. The event was permitted under the District's expressive activities program and, most importantly, remained peaceful for the duration of the event with no injuries reported. Some protestors got onto the roadway, so traffic was stopped for some time in order to ensure public safety. Once pedestrians exited the roadway, vehicular traffic was restored. Bridge security and operations staff did an exemplary job ensuring all involved remained safe during this extraordinary event.\n\nDecember 2020: New generators replace decades-old generators (the oldest was installed in 1973!) and provide near instantaneous power to the Bridge and District facilities in the event of a power failure.\n\n* All Photos (except where noted) copyright © Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District.
