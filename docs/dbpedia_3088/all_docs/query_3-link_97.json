Initial accreditation does not mean programs are at a higher risk of losing accreditation or that they are “less” accredited.\n\nGraduates of an Initially accredited program are considered graduates of an AVMA CVTEA accredited program and would be eligible in nearly all states to take the Veterinary Technician National Exam.\n\nPrograms on PROBATIONARY accreditation are still officially accredited. Graduates from programs on Probationary accreditation are considered to be graduates of an AVMA CVTEA accredited program.\n\nPrograms on TERMINAL accreditation have plans for voluntary closure.
