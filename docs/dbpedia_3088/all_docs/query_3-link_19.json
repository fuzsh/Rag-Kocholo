The article describes cases of a rare lung infection, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia(PCP), in five young, previously healthy gay men in Los Angeles. Los Angeles immunologist Dr. Michael Gottlieb, CDCâs Dr. Wayne Shandera, and their colleagues report that all the men have other unusual infections as well, indicating that their immune systems are not working. Two have already died by the time the report is published and the others will die soon after. This edition of the MMWR marks the first official reporting of what will later become known as the AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) epidemic.\n\nJune 5: The same day that the MMWR is published, New York dermatologist Exit Disclaimer calls CDC to report a cluster of cases of a rare and unusually aggressive cancerâKaposiâs Sarcoma (KS)âamong gay men in New York and California. Like PCP, KS is associated with people who have weakened immune systems.\n\nJune 5-6: The Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times, and the San Francisco Chronicle report on the MMWR article. Within days, CDC receives reports from around the nation of similar cases of PCP, KS, and other opportunistic infections among gay men.\n\nJune 8: In response to these reports, CDC establishes the Task Force on Kaposiâs Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections to identify risk factors and to develop a case definition for the as-yet-unnamed syndrome so that CDC can begin national Exit Disclaimer of new cases.,,\n\nJune 16: A 35-year-old, white gay man who is exhibiting symptoms of severe immunodeficiency is the first person with AIDS to be admitted to the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He never leaves the Center and dies on October 28.\n\nJuly 2: The Bay Area Reporter, a weekly newspaper for the gay and lesbian community in San Francisco, publishes its first mention of âGay Menâs Pneumonia.â The short item encourages gay men who are experiencing progressive shortness of breath to see their physicians.\n\nJuly 3: CDC releases another MMWR, â Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis Pneumonia Among Homosexual Men â New York City and California,â with information on KS and PCP among 26 gay men (25 white and one black).

Kramer invites Dr. Friedman-Kien to speak, and he asks the group to contribute money to support his research because he has no access to rapid funding. The plea raises $6,635âessentially the only new money, public or private, that will be raised to fight the epidemic for the remainder of the year.\n\nAugust 28: The latest MMWR article, âFollow-Up on Kaposiâs Sarcoma and Pneumocystis Pneumonia,â reports that CDC has received information on 70 additional cases of KS and/or PCP since the July 3 edition. Of the 108 cases reported to date, 107 are male, 94% of those whose sexual orientation is known are gay/bisexual, and 40% of all patients have already died.\n\nSeptember 15: The National Cancer Institute and CDC cosponsor the first conference to address the new epidemic. Fifty leading clinicians attend the event in Bethesda, MD, to discuss KS and other opportunistic infections and to develop recommendations for further studies in epidemiology, virology, and treatment.,\n\nSeptember 21: San Francisco dermatologist Exit Disclaimer oversees the opening of the nationâs first KS clinic at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.

Calling himself the âKS Poster Boy,â Campbell writes a newspaper column, âGay Cancer Journal,â on his experiences living with KS for the San Francisco Sentinel. He also Exit Disclaimer of his KS lesions in the window of a local drugstore to alert the community to the disease and encourage people to seek treatment.\n\nBy yearâs end, there is a cumulative total of 337 reported cases of individuals with severe immune deficiency in the United Statesâ321 adults/adolescents and 16 children under age 13.

Donor tracing reveals that one of the babyâs blood donors died of AIDS in August.\n\nDecember 17: CDCâs latest MMWR, âUnexplained Immunodeficiency and Opportunistic Infections in Infants -- New York, New Jersey, California,â reports another 22 cases of unexplained immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections in infants. The article states âIt is possible that these infants had the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS),â but stops short of making a definitive diagnosis.\n\n1983\n\nJanuary 1: Exit Disclaimer, the worldâs first dedicated outpatient AIDS clinic, opens at San Francisco General Hospital. The clinic is a collaboration between the hospital and the University of California, San Francisco, and it draws staff who are passionate about treating people with AIDS.

This will prevent an estimated 400,000 new HIV cases over those 10 years, while protecting and preserving the health of people currently living with HIV.\n\nFebruary 7: In a bid to expand the HIV prevention choices available to adolescent girls and young women, NIH announces the launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial to examine the safety and use of two HIV prevention toolsâoral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and a vaginal ringâin that population in southern Africa. The Exit Disclaimer will enroll 300 girls and young women ages 16â21 at five sites in Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nMarch 4: At the 2019 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), Exit Disclaimer. Like the 2007 case of the âExit Disclaimerâ (the first person to be cured of HIV), the âLondon Patientâ has no detectable HIV infection three years after he received a bone marrow transplant from a donor who is genetically immune to HIV, despite having been off antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 18 months. Both patients received bone marrow transplants to treat cancer. While the treatment is too dangerous and costly for widespread use, researchers hail the news as further proof that HIV can be cured.\n\nMarch 25: Surgeons at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, perform the Exit Disclaimer.\n\nMay 9: NIH announces the launch of a clinical trial to evaluate long-acting ART for maintaining HIV suppression in people who find it a challenge to take daily ART in pill form. The study, called Long-Acting Therapy to Improve Treatment Success in Daily Life, or LATITUDE, will help determine whether a combination of two experimental injectable formulations of ART are better than conventional daily medications in managing HIV infection in this population.\n\nJune 11: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force) gives A-level recommendations for HIV screening and prevention, stating that clinicians should screen for HIV in adolescents, adults, and pregnant people and offer PrEP to people at high risk for HIV.\n\nDecember 3: A new CDC Vital Signs report shows that progress in reducing new HIV infections in the United States has stalled in recent years and highlights the need for increased HIV testing, treatment, and prevention to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S.\n\nDecember 11: HRSAâs HIV/AIDS Bureau releases a new report showing that clients receiving Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) medical care were virally suppressed at a record level â 87.1 percent â in 2018. More than half of people with diagnosed HIV in the U.S. received RWHAP services in 2018.\n\n2020\n\nAugust 17: HHS launches AHEAD: Americaâs HIV Epidemic Analysis Dashboard, a tool that provides national and jurisdictional data on the six Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative indicators, allowing national, state, and local stakeholders to track progress towards meeting EHE goals.\n\nNovember 19: CDC publishes a new study showing that the age-adjusted rate of HIV-relat"
