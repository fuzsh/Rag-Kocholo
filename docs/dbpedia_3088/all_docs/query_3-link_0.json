        "text": "Mr. Gilbert Parent (Welland):\n\nMadam Speaker, the decision made by the executive of the Canadian Amateur Rowing Association to take the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta from St. Catharines created consternation in rowing in Canada and abroad. I understand the decision was made by the executive of CARA alone. Despite the deep significance of such a drastic change in policy and tradition, and its obvious effect on rowing in Canada, it was not allowed to be voted on by the membership of CARA at the annual meeting. The Canadian Henley Rowing Corporation has consistently registered its deep concern, but so far it has not met with any great success.\n\nWe of the Welland riding, and of the city of St. Catharines specifically, have no quarrel with the city of Montreal or the sports people who make up the rowing fraternity in that great city. We wish them well in their planning to develop a major rowing regatta for their Olympic course, and I state quite clearly that CHRC stands ready to provide its expertise and work with them in the advancement of rowing in Montreal and in Canada.\n\nThe issue here is a simple one. The title to the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta is vested in St. Catharines. No one else has any rights to this title. So, Madam Speaker, at the usual time in the summers of 1983 and 1984, and thereafter, there will be rowed in the city of St. Catharines a regatta known as the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta. I believe-\n\nMr. Gus Mitges (Grey-Simcoe):\n\nMadam Speaker, since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, a member of the Commonwealth, the invaders have consistently refused to provide information on the fate of missing persons as a result of the invasion. Indisputable evidence ascertains that 1,619 Greek Cypriots were detained by the invaders in 1974, and their\n\nwhereabouts are unknown to this day. On December 9, 1982, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution on missing persons in Cyprus calling for a speedy solution to this humanitarian problem. On January 11 of this year the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the problem of missing persons in Cyprus, urging the committee to meet and proceed with all investigations required.\n\nCanada's voice regarding this most tragic circumstance, Madam Speaker, has been conspicuous by its absence in its votes in the United Nations, and by refusing to add its aid to the more than 100 nations around the world in support of equitably resolving the Cypriot problem. This is not a time for fence sitting, it is a time to assert ourselves positively on the side of justice for all the people of Cyprus and their strife-torn country.\n\nMrs. Margaret Mitchell (Vancouver East):\n\nMadam Speaker, mandatory affirmative action is absolutely essential if women are to achieve equality in the work place. As a major employer, the federal Government should be a role model for private employers. Instead, it has failed abysmally. Government pilot projects have no teeth, they are just window dressing. Only 4.8 per cent of management personnel in the Public Service are women. Yet in the low paying service jobs 81.6 per cent are women, many of whom earn under $10,000 a year. And this is the record of which the Minister responsible for the status of women says she is so proud.\n\nThe Government's record on voluntary affirmative action in the private sector is also an abysmall failure. Fewer than 5 per cent of all employers approached agreed to consider affirmative action, and none have actually taken action yet. Last year the Minister talked tough about requiring mandatory affirmative action, and then she backed down. We have obtained confidential information that the Cabinet is currently considering more discussion and consultation only. The recession is no excuse for this reprehensible lack of action. Mandatory affirmative action must be approved immediately so that programs can be implemented over the next few years. Women of Canada demand action now. They are tired of lip service, empty promises, and platitudes. They will not be condemned to low-paying job ghettos forever.\n\nMarch 9, 1983\n\nMr. Maurice Harquail (Restigouche):\n\nMadam Speaker, I bring the attention of the House to the serious transportation problem in the Atlantic Provinces. I know from discussions with my colleagues that they share my concern about the continuing dispute involving the machinists' union as well as the pilots, with Eastern Provincial Airways. I take this opportunity to invite the Department of Transport as well as the Minister of Labour (Mr. Caccia) to join together to see if their officials cannot develop ways and means to assist the officials of this airline company and the pilots' union in determining if they cannot come to some amicable settlement.\n\nI can tell you, Madam Speaker, that this strike, which has gone on since January of this year, is causing a very severe hardship for Canadians living in the four Atlantic Provinces. It is having an adverse effect on the economy there, and I implore the House to invite the Minister of Labour to see if there is not some way that he can have the president of that Company get a little closer to the union to bring about a settlement at the earliest possible date.\n\nMr. Gordon Towers (Red Deer):\n\nMadam Speaker, the word is out that the Prime Minister's (Mr. Trudeau) agents are taking legal action because a new highrise luxury apartment building is diminishing the value of his home and spoiling his view over Montreal. Could the Prime Minister tell this House whether or not he has stopped lately and counted the number of views he has spoiled for Canadians, the 1.5 million jobless, the ruined and bankrupt businesses, and for all those who have lost confidence in the Government? Can he explain why he is deserving of any consideration whatsoever at the same time that he is casting a shadow over the lives of millions of Canadians, thereby denying them their day in the sun?\n\nMr. Robert Daudlin (Essex-Kent):\n\nMadam Speaker, a matter of concern has recently been brought to my attention and stems from what amounts to an injustice to Canadian taxpayers and to those families which rely on, or are dependent upon, child support payments by an ex-spouse.\n\nPresently, persons who are required to pay child support by reason of a court order are not required by law to continue this child support when they enter prison, even though they may have earnings as an inmate. While it is recognized that the living allowance or wage earned in prison is minimal, the basic\n\nrequirement to uphold their responsibility of helping to provide for their children, should not be forgone.\n\nI would ask that the Solicitor General (Mr. Kaplan) review this situation and require inmates, who were paying child support before they entered the penitentiary system, to continue to fulfil their court ordered and social responsibilities, and pay a portion of the support, no matter how small this amount may be. Such action would remove an injustice from the system and could serve to enhance the rehabilitation process by reinforcing the concept that citizens of a society cannot participate in society by avoiding their responsibilities at the expense of the general taxpayer."
