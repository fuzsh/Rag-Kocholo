        "text": "President Eisenhower signs the National Aeronautics and Space Act, creating the agency, which was based on the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics when it opens for business on Oct. 1, 1958. He is shown here in August giving commissions to T. Keith Glennan (right) and Hugh L. Dryden (left), NASA's first administrator and deputy administrator respectively.\n\nNASA launches Pioneer 1. A project inherited from the U.S. Army, Pioneer 1 became NASA’s first spacecraft. Meant to go into lunar orbit and carrying a TV camera to study the moon's surface, a mechanical problem limited the spacecraft to sending 43 minutes of data back before re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAt a press conference in Washington, NASA introduces the first American astronauts, the Mercury 7. All experienced military test pilots, they had undergone an incredible battery of physical and mental examinations.\n\nNASA launches TIROS 1, the first weather satellite. Crude by modern standards, this is the first television image from space. Tiros 1 operated for only 78 days but proved scientists could monitor the Earth's weather patterns and cloud cover from space.\n\nNASA launches ECHO 1, the first communications satellite. Echo was a passive satellite; it reflected radio and radar signals rather than generating or relaying them. Scientists were also able to track it as a way of understanding the upper layers of Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nAlan Shepard becomes the first American in space, making a 15-minute suborbital flight.\n\nThree weeks after the first U.S. astronaut flies, President Kennedy announces the audacious goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. The challenge to NASA was immense; the agency had only rough plans for a Moon landing in several decades. But once the goal was set, NASA responded.\n\nThe second major step toward the Moon was putting a man in orbit. Astronaut John Glenn got that job, making three laps around the Earth in just under five hours.\n\nNASA launches the communications satellite Telstar I, the first active communications satellite and, also the first satellite launched for a private company. Telstar was built and operated by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). On July 23, it relayed the first publicly available transatlantic TV signal, showing pictures of the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, part of a baseball game and remarks by President Kennedy on the value of the American dollar, which was causing concern in Europe. When Kennedy denied that the United States would devalue the dollar, it immediately strengthened on world markets. CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite, also on the broadcast, later said that \"We all glimpsed something of the true power of the instrument we had wrought.\"\n\nMariner 2 flies past the planet Venus in the first space mission to study another planet at close range. Among many other things, the spacecraft discovered that Venus had no magnetic field\n\nNASA launches Intelsat 1 for the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT). Built by Hughes Aircraft Company, Intelsat 1 (known as Early Bird at the time) was the first communications satellite placed in a geosynchronous orbit. From Earth the satellite appears to stay in one spot in the sky, making for a very simple and robust way to use satellites for communications. This idea had been popularized by Arthur C. Clarke in 1945.\n\nEd White becomes the first American to take a spacewalk. Developing spacesuit technology and spacewalking skills were crucial to our plans in space.\n\nA fire on the launch pad kills the first Apollo crew: Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. NASA responded to this crushing loss by overhauling the Apollo spacecraft design and developing the processes and procedures that allowed us to safely conduct the rest of the Apollo program.\n\nLast flight of the “finest and most productive research aircraft ever seen”—the X-15. The X-15 flew for nearly 10 years and set unofficial speed and altitude records of 4,520 mph (Mach 6.7) and 354,200 feet, while investigating all aspects of piloted hypersonic flight. Information from the program contributed to the development of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo piloted spaceflight programs as well as the Space Shuttle.\n\nThe crew of Apollo 8 are the first humans to see the Earth from lunar orbit and capture the famous Earthrise photograph. Orbiting the Moon on Christmas Eve, they add some perspective to a turbulent 1968 in their TV broadcast that concludes with a reading from the Book of Genesis.\n\nNeil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first humans to walk on another celestial body.\n\nNASA's \"successful failure\" begins with an explosion in the service module of the Apollo 13 spacecraft. The crew had to use the lunar module as a lifeboat while they spent more than three days circling the moon and returning to Earth.\n\nNASA conducts the first test of the supercritical wing -- in some ways a normal airplane wing turned upside-down -- designed to allow planes to travel more smoothly as they approached the speed of sound. It was part of NASA's ongoing efforts to improve aeronautics and led one Boeing executive to say, “NASA’s work on managing the sound barrier provided the fundamental understanding of transonic and supersonic aerodynamics, which allowed the development of the aircraft we fly around in today.”\n\nMariner 9 reaches Mars and becomes the first spacecraft to orbit another planet. Its mapping mission is initially delayed by a dust storm that obscures all of Mars's surface except the tops of its tallest mountains.\n\nFirst flight of Digital-Fly-By-Wire aircraft, which controlled flight surfaces by computer instead by cables reacting to movements by the pilot. Based in part on the Apollo navigation computer (and championed by Neil Armstrong, then at NASA Headquarters) fly-by-wire systems are used in aircraft around the world today. Part of the benefit is replacing heavy mechanical systems, allowing greater fuel efficiency and increased passenter and cargo loads.\n\nLandsat 1 launch, beginning more than 40 years of continuous observations of the Earth's land surfaces, oceans and atmosphere.\n\nThe Apollo 17 crew takes a picture of the Earth on their way to the Moon: the \"Blue Marble\".\n\nNASA launches Skylab, the first U.S. space station.\n\nDocking of the U.S. Apollo and Soviet Soyuz capsules, the first joint mission between Americans and Russians.\n\nViking 1 lands on Mars, beginning NASA’s 40 years of exploration of the Red Planet."
