        "text": "Synopsis\n\nKelly Ortberg returned from early retirement to lead Boeing, that is facing numerous challenges, including financial losses and quality issues. With a strong background in aerospace, his appointment is seen as positive. Ortberg aims to address production quality and will be based in Seattle, aligning with Boeing's roots and negotiating with the workers' union.\n\nAviation experts and analysts have been full of praise for Kelly Ortberg, who returns from early retirement Thursday to take up the challenge of turning Boeing around after a series of quality and financial issues.\n\nThe appointment of 64-year-old Ortberg to succeed outgoing Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun was announced on July 31, the same day the US aerospace giant posted a second-quarter loss of more than $1.4 billion.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" Ortberg said in a statement. He has not spoken publicly since his appointment.\n\nCalhoun will meanwhile remain a special adviser to Boeing's board of directors until March 2025.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer's finances are struggling to recover from the consequences of two fatal crashes of 2018 and 2019, and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Dave Calhoun's downfall -- announced at the end of March -- is the result of the accumulation of quality and compliance issues in Boeing's commercial aviation division.\n\n\"We see Kelly Ortberg as a win for Boeing,\" aviation experts at Melius Research wrote in an analyst note, adding that his experience as CEO of Rockwell Collins -- now an RTX subsidiary called Collins Aerospace -- \"checks a lot of boxes.\"\n\n\"He has an engineering background, experience running a public company, a multi-decade tenure in the aerospace industry, and is a Boeing outsider, which should allow for a fresh approach to solving Boeing's issues,\" they said.\n\nOrtberg is \"a positive hire\" given his prior industry experience and his role managing a large supplier,\" CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe most urgent issue on Ortberg's plate is undoubtedly restoring Boeing's production quality, which has been criticized in several audits. The firm has already drawn up a roadmap to achieve this, as it was required to do by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nTo accomplish the necessary quality standards, Boeing will also be taking back control of Spirit AeroSystems, a company it spun off back in 2005.\n\nThe $4.7 billion purchase, announced in early July, is due to be completed by mid-2025.\n\nThe appointment of Ortberg, who began his career in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, comes after two long days of hearings organized by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of its investigation into an in-flight incident in January involving a 737 MAX 9.\n\nThe consequences of the incident was a reshuffling of executives, a freeze of 737 production by the FAA, the launch of investigations, and the reactivation of the criminal case against the company.\n\nThese are just some of the issues that Ortberg will have to tackle.\n\nAnother factor working in the new CEO's favor is that he plans to work from Seattle, the birthplace of Boeing, where the assembly lines for the 737 - its flagship aircraft - and the 777 are located.\n\nThe new generation 777X also finally seems to be within reach of certification after years of delay. On the other hand, the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 are still languishing.\n\nThe IAM-District 751 workers' union, which represents more than 30,000 Boeing employees around Seattle, called Ortberg's decision to base himself in the city \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe union's approval is important at a time when Boeing is negotiating its next collective agreement, which is due to come into force in September.\n\nThe union has already approved strike action if no deal is reached by this deadline.\n\nAnother major issue for Boeing is its guilty plea, announced July 24, in the criminal case relating to the crashes; the company is still waiting for the judge's decision, and civil proceedings.\n\nRobert Clifford, a lawyer representing the families of the victims, also reacted positively to Ortberg's appointment, noting his \"well-regarded reputation\" and the fact he came from outside the company.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n10 stocks that can defy the yen upheaval, as Sensex comes out of Dow shadow\n\nThree reasons why Mumbai, NCR beat Bengaluru in the IPO treasure hunt\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nIs the great Indian snacking boom slowing down finally?\n\n3 key things Nirmala Sitharaman can do to restore Buddha’s legacy, draw global tourists\n\nAnalysing Hindenburg’s three key allegations against Sebi’s Madhabi Buch\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
