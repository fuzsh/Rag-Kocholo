        "text": "Cataldo Aprea, the president of the Italian yacht builder Apreamare, has always had big ideas. He created the shipyard in 1983 to build pleasureboats in different ways and with different designs than his family’s longtime boat-building business. Forty-one years after that founding, Aprea has once again made a mark on history with the launch of the Maestro 88 yacht Gipsy VI. It’s the largest-ever project from Apreamare, for a loyal customer who’s owned a few previous Apreamare models.\n\nIn fact, the owner requested that all the craftspeople who contributed to the new yacht’s creation attend the launch on August 3. Suppliers were invited, too. With his family and the build and design teams, the owner, a fellow Italian, enjoyed a private christening ceremony. Fittingly, the yacht then slipped into the water while the Italian national anthem played.\n\n“We involved our entire supply chain of suppliers and artisans from Campania, the same ones who have supported the growth of Apreamare since the beginning,” Aprea says. That includes the previous Maestro range of smaller boats, which interestingly originated as a sketch Aprea made in 2005. The concept for the series was a long-range motoryacht capable of cruising in various conditions. Similar to the other range models, the 89-foot (27-meter) Maestro 88 yacht has a semi-planing hull that delivers good performance. Specifically, she should see a top speed of about 28 knots with the owner-requested optional MAN engines. (The standard MANs should permit a maximum of 22 knots.) The yacht further should be capable of 1,000 nautical miles at 10 knots.\n\nDesign-wise, although she is a Maestro model, the new launch has differences. For instance, Marco Casali styled her external lines, imparting contemporary flair while preserving traditional navetta appeal. Umberto Tagliavini, meanwhile, handled naval architecture and engineering to ensure the above-mentioned performance. Additionally, the Maestro 88 yacht Gipsy VI incorporates solar panels atop the flying bridge. Since the interior is semi-custom, the owner requested a beach club at the water’s edge, along with a galley and wetbar on the flying bridge.\n\n“We celebrated a dream come true, thanks to an owner who truly believes in us!” declares Rita Pollio, CEO of Apreamare (pictured with Cataldo Aprea above). She considers the launch the latest steps “in our journey of constant growth.”\n\nApreamare apreamare.it\n\nMarco Casali – Too Design marcocasali.com\n\nLOA: 88’11” (27.1 meters)\n\nBeam: 22’0” (6.7 meters)\n\nDraft: 5’11” (1.8 meters)\n\nGuests: 8 in 4 staterooms\n\nEngines: 2/1,627-hp MANs standard, 2/1,973-hp MANs optional\n\nRange: 1,000 nautical miles at 10 knots\n\nBuilder: Apreamare\n\nStylist: Marco Casali – Too Design\n\nNaval Architect: Umberto Tagliavini\n\nInterior Designer: Apreamare"
