The sounds can be heard throughout downtown Vancouver. A fun fact, during the 2010 Winter Olympics the horns were also sounded whenever Canada won a medal.\n\nMedia Home Base\n\nDuring the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada Place served as the Main Press Centre. There were more than 10,000 journalists and broadcasters from across the globe set-up at this momentous time in Canadian history.\n\nWelcome Point for Millions\n\nEvery year, approximately 1 million cruise ship passengers visit this hub.
