        "text": "What is a Birth Tree?\n\nTrees are special and provide a plethora of benefits both environmentally and economically. But did you also know that your birth tree can determine your personality? According to some, especially the Celtic druids, the date of your birth is tied to the lunar calendar and is related to the formation of one’s personality and behavior.\n\nBefore we delve into the meaning of each tree, first a little history. Trees have always had a special place in Celtic history. Living trees have played a central role in the practical daily and spiritual lives of the Irish people for centuries. Irish myth, story and music abound with references to trees and their being the home of fairies and spirits. Traveling the Irish countryside, as I have done many times, one is sure to find hand-crafted fairy homes scattered about the forest, always bringing a huge smile to my eyes.\n\nTrees served as landmarks and icons of family and clan identity, and their importance can be measured by the great number of tree-based places named in Ireland – of the 16,000 towns in Ireland, 13,000 are named after trees! All this demonstrates the degree to which trees were understood and valued by the culture.\n\nCeltic Birth Trees\n\nThe Celtic druids had a profound connection with trees and believed they were vessels of infinite wisdom. They felt the entire universe existed in the form of a tree. The roots grew deep below, representing the past. The trunk sat in everyday life, representing the present. The branches reached up high into the heavens, representing the future and afterlife. They developed Celtic tree astrology based on the lunar calendar, so it has thirteen astrological signs rather than twelve. Accordingly, the Druids designated a tree to each of the thirteen moon phases in their calendar and associated each tree with a type of personality. They even determined which signs were most compatible with.\n\nBirth Trees by Month\n\nTake a little time and discover more about your birth tree and the personality traits associated with it and with what other birth trees you are most compatible.\n\nSend a Birth Tree by Month gift card package. Includes seeds of the birth tree so the recipient can grow their own. Learn more about the birth tree gift card package.\n\nJanuary Birth Tree\n\nThe Rowan Tree: January 22 – February 18\n\nRowans are the philosophical minds in tree astrology. Rowans can be planted near doors and ward off evil and were thought to guard the gateway to the spirit world. Rowans are keen visionaries with high ideals. You are highly influential in a quiet way and others look to you for your unique perspectives. Their inner passion and burning creativity will get them noticed if they are patient in expressing what is inside them. Others will be impressed by their unique perspective and Rowans are highly influential.\n\nBest match: Rowans pair well with Ivy and Hawthorne signs.\n\nFebruary Birth Tree\n\nThe Ash Tree: February 18 – March 17\n\nAsh are free thinkers. Imaginative, intuitive, and naturally artistic, they see the world in water-color purity. Ash tend to be moody and withdrawn at times, but that’s only because their inner landscape is in constant motion. They are in touch with their muse, and are easily inspired by nature. Likewise, Ash inspire all that they associate with and people seek them out for their enchanting personality. Art, writing (especially poetry), science, and theology (spiritual matters) are areas that strongly interest Ash. Others may think they are reclusive, but in all honesty, they are simply immersed in their own world of fantastic vision and design. Ash are in a constant state of self-renewal and rarely place a value on what others think about them.\n\nBest match: Ash pair well with Willow and Reed signs.\n\nMarch Birth Tree\n\nThe Alder Tree: March 18 – April 14\n\nAlders are pathfinders. They will blaze a path before anyone else with a burning passion. Alders are outgoing, have buckets of charm and mix well with different types of people. Not only do they get along well with everybody, others are attracted to them. Alders have faith in themselves and this makes them an attractive person to be around. Alders really hate waste and are uncomfortable with superficial people who aren’t the real deal.\n\nBest match: Alders pair well with Hawthorns, Oaks and Birch\n\nApril Birth Tree\n\nThe Willow Tree: April 15 – May 12\n\nWillows are highly creative, intuitive and intelligent. They have a keen understanding of cycles, and inherently know that every situation has a season. This gives them a realistic perspective of things, and also causes them to be more patient than most tree signs. With their intelligence comes a natural ability to retain knowledge and impress their company with the ability to expound on subjects from memory. It is Willow’s powers of perception that ultimately allow their true nature to shine, and what leads them to success in life.\n\nBest match: Willow pair well with the Birch and the Ivy.\n\nMay Birth Tree\n\nThe Hawthorn Tree: May 13 – June 9\n\nHawthorns have a split personality. On the outside, they present themselves as a normal neighbor, but on the inside, they are wildly creative and passionate. They are good at adapting to changing life situations. They are good at making themselves content and making others content as well. Hawthorns are naturally curious, great listeners, funny, and have a good sense of both irony and silliness.\n\nBest match: Hawthorns pair well with Ash and Rowans.\n\nJune Birth Tree\n\nThe Oak Tree: June 10 – July 7\n\nOaks have a special gift of strength. They are protective people and often become a champion for those who do not have a voice. In other words, the Oak is the crusader and the spokesperson for the underdog. Nurturing, generous and helpful, they exude an easy confidence and naturally assume everything will work out to a positive outcome. They have a deep respect for history and ancestry, and a love to impart their knowledge of the past to others, and thus, many Oaks become teachers. Oaks live long, full, happy lives and enjoy large family settings and are likely to be involved with large social/community networks.\n\nBest match: Oaks pair well with the Ash and Reed, and are known to harmoniously join with Ivy too.\n\nNEW! Send a Birth Tree by Month gift card package. Includes seeds of the birth tree so the recipient can grow their own. Learn more about the birth tree gift card package.\n\nJuly Birth Tree\n\nThe Holly Tree: July 8 – August 4\n\nHollys are regal, noble and often take on positions of high status and leadership. Hollys have perseverance and never shy away from a challenge. They are hardly ever defeated simply because they keep trying until they get what they want as well as being competitive and ambitious even in the most casual settings. They are very intelligent and breeze through intellectual challenges. Hollys are very kind and generous to a fault.\n\nBest match: Hollys pair well with Ash and Elder for balance and partnership.\n\nAugust Birth Tree\n\nThe Hazel Tree: August 5 – September 1\n\nHazels are highly intelligent, organized and efficient. Like the Holly, they are naturally gifted in academia, and excel in the classroom. They have the ability to retain information and can recall, recite and expound on subjects they have memorized with amazing accuracy. Sometimes they appear as a know-it-all to others, but they can’t help that; they are genuinely smart and usually know the right course of action because of an impressive knowledge base. Hollys have a gift for numbers, science and subjects that call for analytical skills. Although they like rules, they are typically making them rather than playing by them.\n\nBest match: Hazel pair harmoniously with Hawthorns and Rowans.\n\nSeptember Birth Tree\n\nThe Vine: September 2 – September 29\n\nVines are born within the autumnal equinox, making their personality unpredictable, full of contradictions and often indecisive. This is due to their ability to see both sides of the story and empathize with each side equally. It is hard to pick sides because they can see the good points on each end. That being said, Vines are certain about enjoying the finer things in life such as food, wine, music, and art. Vines, while seemingly aloof and detached, are very romantic inside.\n\nBest match: Vines pair well with Willow and Hazel.\n\nOctober Birth Tree\n\nThe Ivy: September 30 – October 27\n\nThe Ivy’s most cherished quality is the ability to overcome all odds. They have a sharp intellect, but more obvious is their compassion and loyalty to others. They have a giving nature and are always there to lend a helping hand. Ivys endure troubling times with silent perseverance and soulful grace. Indeed, Ivys have a tendency to be deeply spiritual and cling to a deep-rooted faith that typically sees them through adversity. They are soft spoken, but have a keen wit, are charming and charismatic\n\nBest match: Ivys pair well with Oak and Ash.\n\nNovember Birth Tree\n\nThe Reed: October 28 – November 24\n\nReeds are great at keeping secrets. They can dig deep to find the real meaning of things and discover the truth. People born under this Celtic tree sign love a good story, gossip and scandals. This makes them perfect historians, journalists, detectives, and archaeologists. They have the ability to find the core of things and strip every layer of the story. However, they tend to be a bit manipulative at times, but still have a strong sense of truth and honor.\n\nBest match: Reeds pair well with other Reeds, Ash or Oak.\n\nDecember Birth Tree\n\nThe Elder Tree: November 25 – December 23\n\nThe Elder is a wild child, loving freedom. Elders are thrill seekers for the majority of their lives. They are also outspoken and refuse to be pressured by others into anything. They need constant mental and physical challenges. Furthermore, Elders are very thoughtful and considerate of others and genuinely strive to be helpful.\n\nBest fit: Elders pair well with Alder and Holly.\n\nNew Year Holiday Birth Tree\n\nThe Birch Tree: December 24 – January 21\n\nBirch are high energy, highly driven, and often motivate others. They become easily caught in their zeal, drive and ambition. They are always reaching for more, seeking better horizons and obtaining higher aspirations. Birch (just like the tree) are tolerant, tough, and resilient. They are cool-headed and are natural-born leaders, often taking command when a situation calls for leadership. They also bring beauty in otherwise barren spaces, brightening up a room with their guile, and charming crowds with a quick wit.\n\nBest fit: Birch pair well with Vine and Willow."
