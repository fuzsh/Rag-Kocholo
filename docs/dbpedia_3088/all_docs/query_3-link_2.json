I have reviewed my file and noticed that there are about 50,000 pages of material on this matter. However, I am sure that all Hon. Members of the House, when we finally bring the matter to a vote, will want to vote that these papers be released.\n\nThe reason I say this is that any reasonable, thinking Member of the House or any reasonable Canadian, on looking at these documents, will realize that they were all prepared at public expense and that they are documents which in fact have been subjected to what the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Mr. De Bane) has publicly described as a public review process. All these documents were provided to what is known as the Mclnerney panel in British Columbia and were used as substance for the decision to which they came over the past year regarding the safety and propriety of the Amax operation, although in its most recent report it has distinguished that somewhat, in that some parts of the Amax Kitsault operation are not operating according to the special Order in Council granted during the federal election in 1979.\n\n1 urge all Hon. Members who are here today and those who are doing any research on this matter to obtain Motions Nos. 109, 110 and 111 and to look at the documents which are listed so as to assure themselves that they are not what the Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Smith) referred to them as when this motion was referred for debate. He said that they were internal Cabinet memoranda of some kind or that they were some kind of special interministerial documents which could not be released for some special reasons-for the security of the country or something. They are technical documents. They are primarily biological and oceanographic in nature and are very important documents to be released to those members of the scientific community, to the Nishga people and to many of the other groups which have been interested in this matter for some time.\n\nI would like to put on the record some of the groups that called for a full public inquiry and are interested in seeing these documents released. I am sure many Members are now aware that there are several hundred recognized groups in Canada that called for a full public inquiry. Earlier today I tabled another 1,300 signatures of petitioners, bringing the number of names which I have tabled to somewhere in the region of 20,000. I understand that some 80,000 have been directed to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau), bringing us to probably the level of 100,000.\n\nThe number of individuals represented by these groups is very rapidly approaching half the population of Canada. Here is just a sample: Canadian Union of Public Employees; Native Brotherhood of British Columbia; Prince Rupert NDP;\n\nVictoria Labour Council; Anglican Church of Canada, Ottawa Diocese; British Columbia New Democratic Party Caucus; Project North; B.C. & Yukon Territory Building and Construction Trades Council; National Indian Brotherhood in Ottawa; North Coast Tribal Council; United Church of Canada; Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops; Anglican Church of Canada, in particular the Most Reverend Edward W. Scott, Primate; Anglican Church of Canada, Bishop Douglas Hambidge; NDP Federal Caucus; Anglican Church of Canada; Port Simpson Band Council; Nishga Tribal Council; Telecommunications Workers' Union; West Coast Environmental Law Association; Canadian Environmental Law Association; Greenpeace Foundation; United Fishermen & Allied Workers' Union; Dr. Peter McCart, a biologist; Reverend Peter Hamel of the Anglican Church of Canada; SPEC from British Columbia or the Society for Pollution and Environmental Control; British Columbia Federation of Labour, representing all workers in British Columbia; the Council of the North; Lutheran Church in America; B. C. Conference of United Churches; Kitimat-Terrace and District Labour Council; Vancouver Island Building & Construction Trades Council; Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility; Gitksan-Carrier Tribal Council; the Edmonton Diocese of the Anglican Church; the Huron Diocese; the British Columbia Medical Association; and petitions from every Province and both Territories.\n\nThis is just a sample of the groups which are not amused with the footdragging on the Government side at every attempt I have made to obtain legitimate documentation. Most recently I obtained under Motion No. 106 a highly sanitized group of documents; there were parts of documents missing, whole areas of documents missing, entire documents missing. Those were simply in relation to the draft copies of the regulations circulated between Amax and Government lawyers as they were going behind the scenes drafting the regulations ahead of time.\n\nHere are a couple of samples of what has been said in some publications. In December, 1980 the Canadian Churchman had this to say:\n\nArchbishop Scott has written Prime Minister Trudeau expressing \"deep frustration\" at the lack of response to a letter informing the government of the General Synod's resolution on Amax: \"Our concern over the development of this project is even stronger today, and actions that have taken place since then have impressed upon us the need for urgent action to address this matter. Even though Amax and government officials continue to say the Kitsault mining project does not impose any major threat to the environment, a significant and growing body of individual scientists and groups are contradicting that position\", he said.\n\nStatements by doctors on behalf of the British Columbia Medical Association appeared in The Globe and Mail on July 18, 1981. One reads:\n\nThe entire General Assembly of the British Columbia Medical Association, representing 4,000 doctors, moved and passed a motion on the need for such an inquiry as a basic requirement and passed it almost unanimously at their annual meeting in May.\n\nMarch 9, 1983\n\nAgain from the British Columbia Medical Association we have another statement. This group, I suppose, the Liberals here in eastern Canada consider to be a bunch of quacks and quirks. This statement reads:\n\nWe as doctors demand closure of the Amax project and the unsafe, untested and unhealthy disposal of heavy metal tailings into the waters of Canada until a full and open public inquiry is implemented and reports to the citizens of Canada. As doctors we can do no less.\n\nThat is what doctors have to say. But what do the Liberals do about that? They continue to hide. The Globe and Mail for May 8, 1981 carried this report:\n\nAlice Richards, daughter of Max Schott, who is a founder and former president of the company that later became Amax, made an impassioned plea to the stockholders at the annual meeting of Amax to save the Nishga from mine tailings that they fear threaten their food chain, livelihoods and their very lives. \"In all honesty and justice, if we are so right and there is no danger from dropping tailings into the ocean, then why have we refused to allow public hearings?\" Alice Richards asked.\n\nThere is the daughter of the founder of the company making a plea for a full public inquiry. Again, no move from the Liberals because everyone in this country knows they are hiding something, and I intend to allude to some of the things they are hiding today.\n\nIn the Canadian Churchman for June, 1981 we find this:\n\nThe Nishga have said loudly, clearly and repeatedly \"We are not against development, we are against the permanent destruction of the marine environment for short term gain. We want to have control of the planning for development, have a share in the profits and have our people employed. We do not want our homeland exploited without our permission and with no benefits to us.\"\n\nThe February 7, 1981 edition of The Financial Post reported:\n\nCanadian Arctic Gas Pipeline Limited spent several hundred million dollars on its fruitless quest for the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline. Amax of Canada Limited president, C. Allen Born, might well ask himself if he is about to walk into the same buzzsaw. There are parallels, even if the projects differ vastly. The company suddenly finds itself at the center of a growing storm, involving two governments, the Nishga Tribal Council and a group of leading Canadian clerics, including Archbishop Edward Scott, the Anglican primate of Canada.\n\nIn The Globe and Mail for July 8, 1981 we find:\n\nThe United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union, which support the Nishga, has called the government's actions \"a massive cover-up\".\n\nThat is a very mild statement, I must say. Added to that the Ombudsman for British Columbia this past week has come on board. I suppose the Liberals would consider an Ombudsman to be someone who just gets in the way; he should not have access to information. He should be muzzled and shut up as quickly as possible and certainly not given any access to documents which might embarrass the Liberals. However, in The Globe and Mail an article headed \"B.C. Government made error on Amax permit, report says\" reads:\n\nVancouver-The B.C. Government erred in granting a pollution control permit allowing Amax of Canada Ltd. to dump mine tailings into Alice Arm without first consulting the Nishga Indians, the provincial Ombudsman has found.\n\nThen there is mention of the documents which the provincial Government had. Of course, we have a Liberal Member who is always standing up for his Party, never standing up for common sense or justice, to make sure that he keeps his mouth in the pork barrel as long as he can. He thinks doctors are\n\nAmax Limited\n\nquacks. He does not think the churches have anything to stand for and that independent scientists do not have anything to say. He thinks that public servants can write documents at our cost, the public's cost, but they are only available to a certain chosen Liberal few. Conservatives are not allowed to see them; New Democrats are not allowed to see them; the churches and the scientists cannot see them. Only the Liberal machinery behind the scenes is allowed to see them.\n\nIt has been revealed as a result of research done by my office and by certain other people in British Columbia that the mine permit itself was actually drafted by Amax and its own lawyers behind the scenes in collusion with a Government lawyer by the name of MacLatchy, of course all at the direction of certain Members of the Liberal Cabinet.\n\nAs we all know, the permit was drafted by Amax lawyers. All the way up to the Privy Council Office Amax had its own lawyers sitting there drafting the permit, with Government lawyers behind the scenes taking out what Amax did not want in there, and Government lawyers who knew nothing about the science of the project saying: \"Well, at my own discretion\", says MacLatchy, \"I will jerk this section and that section out.\"\n\nMr. Fulton:\n\nMy colleague points out that maybe Gillespie was in there. I do not really know, Mr. Speaker. I do know that lawyers working for Amax-and I will be outlining the history of Amax shortly-were there. Obviously the Prime Minister's office was very much in favour of getting this project off the ground so he could keep his buddies south of the border happy.\n\nThe permit, as we know, gave Amax the right to dump 8,000 times above the level set by this Parliament, set by scientists in the Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations, and allows the dumping of 100 million metric tonnes of material into the Alice Arm fishing grounds. There are scientists who no longer dispute the fact that that material is poisoning Alice Arm, killing the fish and killing much of the life in the Inlet. Amax is allowed to dump 12,000 tonnes a day for 25 years, all to save the company $23 million. Effectively this is what the Liberals are giving away in this case.\n\nA Montreal Gazette for March 1, 1983 headline reads: \"Tonnes of mining waste dumped in B.C. inlet\" and \"Firm helped draft its own permit\". In part the article is as follows:\n\nThe documents, written by MacLatchy in May 1981, show Amax persuaded the government to allow the discharge outlet for the sludge to be 50 metres in length, even though federal officials wanted it to be 100 metres.\n\nAmax lawyer Robert Granger even attended a final drafting session by the Privy Council Office, the documents say.\n\nLet us go to the issue itself and point out why these documents that I am asking for should not be held under this shroud of security. What it is hiding from the public is which Members of Cabinet are culpable in this case and what kind of graft they obtained in order to let this permit go through.\n\nNext I will quote from a document provided to me by the Hon. Member for Vancouver South (Mr. Fraser) who has\n\nMarch 9, 1983\n\nAmax Limited\n\nbeen a very honourable participant in all of this. While he was Minister of the Environment he provided me with documents. I did not have to go to him and cower. I simply went to his office and he gave me access to documents. It is too bad he is not still the Minister of the Environment because he has some honour, something which Members on the other side know very little about. I quote from a document provided to me dated March, 1979, headed \"Position of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans on the disposal of tailings into Alice Arm\". It reads:\n\nConsultants on behalf of Climax Molybdenum have indicated that a tailings pond system with a supernatant overflow can be constructed, operated and maintained based on engineering considerations alone.\n\nIt goes on to state:\n\nIn considering tailings and impoundment possibilities for the Kitsault Project, three potential sites were examined. The initial estimated cost for an adequate impoundment facility is approximately $25 million.\n\nB.C. Hydro has estimated this cost for power transmission lines for pumping at another $4 million. On-land disposal would require reclamation at the end of the mine life which would result in some further costs. In contrast, marine disposal of tailings is estimated at $6 million for capital costs with low operating costs.\n\nThere you have it. A private deal was made with Amax. I think we all know that the present Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, Mr. John Aird, a leading bag person for the Liberal Party in Ontario and Canada for many years until just three days before he became Lieutenant-Governor of this Province, was on the Board of Directors of Amax. He was the only Canadian on the Board of Directors of Amax International. When he stepped down on September 12, he was promptly replaced by none other than the previous President of the United States, Gerald Ford. I will be alluding to the direct relationship between Senator Aird, who was appointed to the Senate by the Liberal Party, his present position, his former position on Amax, as well as the involvement of his law firm, Aird & Berlis.\n\nThe Amax Corporation hired Aird & Berlis as their company lawyers. Mr. Granger, who works for Aird & Berlis, was involved in the drafting of the regulations from the beginning right up to the Privy Council Office, before a decision was made by the scientific team in British Columbia as to whether or not to go for on land or marine tailings. I, and I believe hundreds of thousands of Canadians who have written about this matter, consider it to be extremely corrupt.\n\nMr. Fulton:\n\nI hear the little mind saying that the committee was manipulated. He never bothered to show up. We know where his credibility lies. On page 2 of the document dated May 28, 1981, which was sent to the former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, the committee had this to say to the Minister:\n\nIt is apparent to the Committee that the prohibition imposed by Parliament in Section 33(2) of the Act-\n\nReferring to the Fisheries Act.\n\n-and the general rules set out in the metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations will be of little value if special regimes come to be established to allow particular mining operations to dump tailings and effluents in enormous quantities. That such a situation might arise would seem to be altogether at odds with Parliament's purpose as expressed in Section 33 of the Act. Consequently, the Committee must assess the Alice Arm tailings deposit regulations carefully. It is\n\nAmax Limited\n\nclearly not the case that any or every exercise of power to set special standards or dumping limits is an unusual or unexpected use of power. What the Committee must address itself to is whether or not the deposits allowed in this case go beyond or are inconsistent with what reasonable men would consider to be anticipated under section 33.\n\nThat is very key.\n\nThe general limits set out in the Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations have clearly been drastically exceeded. There has been no mere accommodation of a minor problem, or even of an existing mine. Rather, there has been an accommodation of a mining venture which it appears to the Committee might have been deliberately planned so that a special regime inconsistent with the general prohibition of section 33(2) of the Act and with the standards and concentrations set out in the Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations would be essential.\n\nSubsequent to this letter being written, we now have proof that the former Minister of the Environment, Mr. Marchand, and the former Minister of Amateur Sports, Mrs. Campagnolo, were present at a meeting with Amax either at the same time or at different times. The purpose of their meetings was to design marine tailing deposit regulations before the scientists had an opportunity to oppose the marine tailings disposal. I continue with the letter:\n\nThis might be thought to come dangerously close to treating Section 33(4) of the Act as a carte blanche to allow unlimited, unconfined and unrestricted dumping of toxic materials.\n\nThe Committee is also troubled by the effect that the latitude being allowed the Amax Kitsault Mine may have on the sentencing of those convicted of breach of section 33 of the Act or of exceeding the limits set out in the Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations. Courts may be reluctant to impose sentences of any real deterrent value when defence counsel can point to dumping limits of the dimensions sanctioned in the case of the Kitsault Mine.\n\nThe vote taken by that committee, which was four to three, censuring the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans for unusual and unexpected use of power still stands despite the real manipulations of the Liberal Party across the way. I hope they can stand in their place and list the 200 or 300 groups in this country that support the hiding of these documents. I doubt there would be the Anglican, Lutheran or United Church, the B.C. Medical Association or the B.C. Teachers' Federation in that list. I challenge any Liberal to rise in the House and list the groups. The groups would be various Liberal riding associations and corporations trying to hide the facts from the Canadian public.\n\nIn fact, I have in my hand today one of the documents which I am pursuing. One of the reasons that the Liberals are hiding these documents so carefully will be proven in a moment as I read a few facts into the record. This document is dated December 11, 1978. It is addressed to Mr. R. Hoos from Mr. D.E.C. Trethewey of the Canadian Wildlife Service, and it is with regard to the Amax operation and the recommendation which Mr. Hoos had made. It states:\n\nI find the procedure employed in the presentation of this report to the JDCC to be highly irregular and completely unacceptable. As Chairman, you have unilaterally prepared and submitted to the JDCC on behalf of the Task Force, but without its approval a report containing a recommendation to proceed with the project. This recommendation did not reflect the opinion of the majority of the Task Force and apparently was based on your own particular biases.\n\nMarch 9, 1983\n\nAmax Limited\n\nIt continues:\n\nI am unaware of any attempt by you to contact Task Force members to determine if in fact such a review would be inconvenient. In its present format, it appears to be nothing more than an information memorandum or progress report to your director.\n\nI have just one more quote, Mr. Speaker. It continues:\n\nIn the present situation, the records will show that the JDCC approved a Task Force recommendation. This, of course, is false. The Task Force should not have to bear the responsibility of a decision which in reality was only that of one person."
