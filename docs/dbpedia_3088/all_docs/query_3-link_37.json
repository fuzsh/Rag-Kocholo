The treaty boundaries illustrated for Treaty 3, 1873, Treaty 5, 1875 and Treaty 94, 1862 are those shown on the First Nations and Treaties map produced by the Province of Ontario and the Government of Canada. The treaty boundaries illustrated for areas outside of Ontario are those shown on the Pre-1975 Treaties map produced by the Government of Canada.
