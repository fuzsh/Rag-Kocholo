However, at his trial at the Old Bailey, he pleaded guilty to all the counts he had been charged for. The main debate at the trial was not whether Nilsen had committed the murders, but his state of mind when the killings took place. The prosecuting counsel claimed he was sane and had killed with premeditation, and the defence counsel stated he had suffered from diminished responsibility.\n\nNilsen was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment on 4 November 1983, and was recommended to serve a minimum 25-year sentence, later changed to a whole-life tariff. He was convicted at the Old Bailey of six counts of murder, and two counts of attempted murder. Nilsen was at HMP Full Sutton prison from 2003 until his death on 12 May 2018.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
