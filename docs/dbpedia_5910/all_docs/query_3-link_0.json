        "text": "The Spectrasonics Story\n\nFounded in 1994 by Los Angeles composer Eric Persing and his wife Lorey, Spectrasonics quickly became a leading developer of world-class sampled sound libraries. As Chief Sound Designer for Roland Corporation since 1984, Eric was already well-known in the music industry for creating many of the most popular sounds in their classic synthesizers, including the ground breaking Roland D-50. By infusing his years of product design expertise, Spectrasonics earned a reputation for setting the standard of excellence in the industry.\n\nInternational Team\n\nToday, Spectrasonics has become a team of many gifted, creative people that Eric directs - sound designers, software engineers, musicians, visual artists - all working together to produce extraordinary software instruments that have a global impact on music.\n\nCritical Acclaim\n\nSpectrasonics users include the world's foremost recording artists, producers, session players, remixers, game developers and film & TV composers. The company's instruments can be heard in thousands of hit records, top-selling games, popular television shows and major motion pictures. Every Spectrasonics product has been given a top industry award and garnered rave reviews.\n\nInnovative Sound Design\n\nIn 1994, Spectrasonics introduced the unique Chromazones™ system of chromatically sampled phrases on the Bass Legends sample library and originated the technique of dynamic string bending on Hans Zimmer Guitars. The following year the company broke uncharted territory with its Distorted Reality series, widely regarded as the most popular sample library of all time. Between 1997-'98, Spectrasonics released the award-winning Symphony of Voices and Vocal Planet which even decades later remain unsurpassed as the world's largest compilation of vocal samples. Throughout its history, Spectrasonics has also been involved in sound licensing deals with prestigious companies like Roland Corporation Japan to create distinctive sounds for numerous synthesizers, expansion boards, and the award-winning V-Drums.\n\nGroove Control\n\nIn 1999, Spectrasonics created Groove Control®, a method of sound development for rhythmic phrases that provided unprecedented flexibility for producers. Many of the top composers and recording artists rely on Groove Control activated libraries in their work - including Spectrasonics' best selling Backbeat, Retro Funk, Metamorphosis, Vocal Planet, Bizarre Guitar and Liquid Grooves collections.\n\nPioneering Virtual Instruments\n\nIn 2002, Spectrasonics launched the next era of the company with three pioneering software-based, 'Virtual Instruments.' The potential of combining powerful software with premium sounds infused the company with new product development strengths, along with a much broader market reach for its products. Spectrasonics emerged as a major player in the virtual instrument software business with the original Stylus® groove module, which rapidly became the best-selling virtual instrument plug-in on the market. The company's Trilogy Total Bass Module® was the first and only virtual bass instrument on the market dedicated to acoustic, electric and synth basses, and the ethereal Atmosphere® dream synth module became an essential instrument in every professional composer's toolkit.\n\nIn-House Software Development\n\nIn 2004, Spectrasonics began a major new direction - to develop all its core technology with its own in-house software development team. The first result was the revolutionary S.A.G.E.™ technology - the most flexible groove engine in the world. S.A.G.E. (Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine) allows extensive real-time control, creation and manipulation of grooves while retaining state-of-the-art sound quality.\n\nThe award-winning Stylus RMX Realtime Groove Module was the first Spectrasonics virtual instrument to benefit from the in-house groove technology. RMX is widely regarded as the industry benchmark for all groove-based virtual instruments and continues to evolve with ground-breaking features such as Time Designer™, which for the first time allows audio loops to be intelligently transformed to other time signatures in real time.\n\nBuilding STEAM\n\nIn 2008, Spectrasonics released its state-of-the-art STEAM Engine™ software synthesis technology with the award-winning Omnisphere®. The STEAM Engine completed the in-house technology transition from earlier instruments and provides a solid technology basis for many future Spectrasonics innovations.\n\nOmnisphere® is the company's most ambitious and successful project to date. Years in the works, this flagship 'Power Synth' was the first virtual instrument built with the STEAM engine. Omnisphere's overwhelming critical and commercial success is a result of the instrument breaking completely new sonic ground by combining a wide variety of hybrid realtime synthesis techniques, an epic library of remarkable \"psychoacoustic\" sounds, and many innovative features that have never been seen before in any hardware or software synthesizer.\n\nIn 2009, Spectrasonics released Trilian®, the award-winning successor to their Trilogy bass instrument. Trilian completed the company's transition to having it's entire product line on it's own technology.\n\nIn 2010, Spectrasonics became the first music software company to provide full cross-platform native 64-bit support of its entire product line.\n\n2011 brought new innovations to Omnisphere including the \"Orb\" intelligent controller and the \"Omni TR\" iPad app - the industry's first \"touch remote\" control app for a professional software synthesizer.\n\nIn 2015, Spectrasonics released its first major upgrade with Omnisphere 2, taking the company’s flagship synthesizer into new sonic territory with vastly expanded synthesis capabilities.\n\nWorld of Keyboards\n\n2016 was a big year for the company, when it finally revealed its fourth virtual instrument Keyscape™ - which features the largest selection of collector keyboards in the world. Ten years in the making, each of the 36 rare and sought-after keyboards were carefully restored and then deeply multisampled by the renowned Spectrasonics Sound Development Team. Keyscape quickly became the industry standard and the best selling keyboard plug-in in the world.\n\nHardware Integration\n\nIn 2018, Spectrasonics developed a major innovation called “Hardware Synth Integration”, which bridges the physical experience gap between software and hardware with a totally unique approach. Omnisphere is the only software synth in the world to offer this remarkable Hardware Synth Integration feature, which transforms many well-known hardware synthesizers into extensive hands-on controllers that unlock Omnisphere’s extensive synthesis capabilities. Simply put, this ground-breaking feature makes using Omnisphere feel just like using a hardware synth.\n\nSonic Extensions\n\nIn 2021, the company launched the Sonic Extensions™ brand - a major new line of innovative, professional expansion products for Omnisphere. The unique combination of next level sounds, deep multisampling, purpose-built custom controls and exclusive new effects introduces a whole new experience for Omnisphere users.\n\nEmbracing the Future\n\nBuilding on over 25 years of accomplishments and creativity, the company has become one of the world’s leading music software developers. Through it all, Spectrasonics’ success remains the result of its original philosophy: Create “powerfully simple” products that are truly inspiring and unique."
