        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions about the OMG-1\n\nWhere can I buy an OMG-1?\n\nYou can't. :-) It's a one-of-a-kind custom instrument.\n\nWill Moog be producing OMG-1s to purchase?\n\nNo. There's no affiliation between Spectrasonics and Moog Music (which makes hardware synths). The OMG-1 is just a personal custom project of Eric Persing's and he donated it for this contest to raise money for the Bob Moog Foundation.\n\nWhy is Eric giving the OMG-1 away?\n\nAs a way of saying thanks for the inspiration that Bob Moog's life and work as an American inventor has meant to his career with synthesizers and electronic music. Spectrasonics simply would not exist without Bob Moog and we are a result of his legacy. The Bob Moog Foundation is very much about keeping the creative spirit of innovation in Electronic Music alive and at Spectrasonics, we are all very much behind their mission of inspiring the next generation.\n\nSo Moog and Spectrasonics are working together now?\n\nNo. The Bob Moog Foundation is a separate entity from Moog Music and is a 501( c )(3) non-profit organization. Spectrasonics is partnering with the Bob Moog Foundation for this benefit, not with Moog Music.\n\nWill Spectrasonics be getting into manufacturing the OMG-1s in the future?\n\nNo. The instrument would be way too costly to produce and market commercially!\n\nHow much did the OMG-1 cost to make and how much is it worth?\n\nPriceless! :-)\n\nThe raw materials cost alone is well over $7,000. Then add to that the labor time of 8 months of custom engineering and craftsmanship of Eric and Daniel and you can see that the raw labor and materials cost alone is extremely high. Since it's a one-of-a-kind instrument, that makes it even more valuable!\n\nWhat's the second keyboard for?\n\nTo extend the range of the keys, since 3 octaves on the Little Phatty keyboard is fairly limiting for polyphonic playing. Each keyboard can be transposed independently.\n\nWhat do the iPods do?\n\nThey can be used for any MIDI control surface apps or additional soundsources.\n\nHow can the OMG-1 be polyphonic if the Little Phattyâ„¢ is a monophonic synth?\n\nThe Little Phatty outputs MIDI polyphonically.\n\nHow is Omnisphere integrated into this instrument?\n\nOmnisphere runs on the internal Mac Mini computer. It can be controlled from seven places:\n\nBoth Keyboards\n\nOmni TR iPad App\n\niTeleport iPad App for remotely accessing the desktop like a video monitor\n\nLittle Phatty front panel controls are integrated with Omnisphere with custom MIDI Learn template that auto-loads on boot up"
