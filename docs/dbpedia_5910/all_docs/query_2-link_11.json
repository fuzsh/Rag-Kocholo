        "text": "I was initially sceptical having not purchased from Groov previously however this turned out to be unfounded as the deck arrived in perfect new condition and being in stock at the time it arrived only 3\n\ndays after the order was placed. Would recommend purchasing the steam deck from Groov as they were the most cost competitive at the time I placed my order.,\n\nSteam Deck is a must have for any PC gamers who need more flexibility on where they play, and being able to stop and start in an instant is very useful. Windows handhelds have terrible sleep modes.\n\nTook the whole 20 working days lead time to arrive, but worth the wait. Looks like it’s fresh from Valve. Comes with a UK charger. I just used a cheap adapter to fit into a NZ plug.\n\nGot my unit two weeks ago and it’s really injected some fun into my music making time. It’s perfect for sampling and building tracks quickly anyway around the house. Great that I can take it away from my studio anytime.\n\nWas apprehensive at taking a chance on Groov NZ initially but the great comms and quick delivery (10 days), and the clearly brand new unopened package I received convinced me I’d made a good choice. Deck works as advertised, just be aware that it’s an international import so the charger won’t be compatible, just replace with any 45W laptop charger with USB C. Thanks Groov NZ for enable me to finally get a Steamdeck at a reasonable price in NZ!\n\nI am enjoying this darkboard. It is light, easy to carry, convenient handholds. The stand works perfectly-non slip and good support. Pencil holder convenient..easy to access. Only modification to finish a great product is a grove to house the cable as it just sits on top of the board, does not get in the way but would be nice to be out of sight and make it a little easier to use. I often have my ipad on charge while using. A minor point but otherwise very happy. Would strongly recommend.\n\nI was nervous about this since it was my first time buying with Groov and it was a big purchase, but I can say that I’ll definitely shop here again. The Steam Deck is an amazing machine and it came in perfect working orders definitely worth the money. There was a minor delay in shipping but Groov was very upfront with communication, and even with the delay it still came quickly\n\nWhen Apple dropped support for target display mode for Apple silicon based macs (as clients) I thought I’d have to replace my trusty iMac with a new display, but the Luna display gives it a new lease of life, and keeps that gorgeous 27” display alive. Sadly not so compatible with my office VPN solution so I can’t just plug and play with office M3 based MacBook Pro and personal Mac Studio. I’ve yet to play with Astropad but sounds like fun having a tablet for my Mac."
