        "text": "The reason for this article “How to use Spectrasonics easily in Logic Pro” comes from an observation: I often receive Logic Pro projects that use Omnisphere, Keyscape, Trillian or Stylus RMX.\n\nThe virtual instruments of the brand Spectrasonics are not to be presented anymore! The quality of these instruments made by its founder Eric Persing and his wife Lorey and all the team of Spectrasonics make the unanimity of the composers of music and that in all the musical styles.\n\nWe all know that nowadays our computers have an impressive computing and storage power. But when I look at the use of these wonderful tools in Logic Pro, I discover that the management of these virtual instruments is inadequate and in the worst case requires freezing tracks.\n\nWhy talk to you about using Spectrasonics easily in Logic Pro?\n\nBecause different ways of using it exist: from the most consuming in terms of CPU resources to the most economical in terms of managing the virtual instruments from Spectrasonics.\n\nBut before getting to the heart of the matter, a reminder of the virtual instruments that Spectrasonics offers in VST / AU / AAX formats.\n\nOmnisphere 2 Spectrasonics’ flagship synthesizer.\n\nKeyscape virtual instrument of collection keyboards.\n\nTrilian bass plug-in.\n\nStylus RMX plug-in of loops and drum one-shots.\n\nThe soundbanks used in Keyscape and Trilian integrate seamlessly as an instrument in the Omnisphere interface. Trilian and Keyscape will simply appear as a library through the Omnisphere synth browser. Provided you have purchased the plug-ins.\n\nThis capability offers Omnisphere 2 Module users additional functionality. But I won’t go into that.\n\nPlease note that the Stylus RMX banks do not work in the Omnisphere virtual instrument, as they use the SAGE engine whereas Keyscape, Trilian and Omnisphere use the Steam Engine.\n\nLet’s find out the worst way to use Omnisphere in Logic Pro!\n\nIn Logic Pro, when you use an Apple virtual synth like Alchemy for example, you load an instance of this Audio Unit plug-in into the console slice of the relevant software instrument as in the example below.\n\nSimple and easy to understand for everyone, a process used by many CAM sequencer manufacturers.\n\nThis has many advantages such as when you mute or solo the track.\n\nIf we apply this working process with the virtual instruments of Spectrasonics. Then very quickly, depending on the power of your machine, you can find yourself with CPU resources that reach the limit of calculation. And you will be forced to freeze some tracks to create new ones.\n\nFortunately, manufacturers have thought of everything!\n\nSome have taken the decision to design monotimbral virtual synths.\n\nOthers like Spectrasonics who created multitimbral virtual synths with an exception for Keyscape oriented keyboard, know that they are used in Omnisphere as sound banks…\n\nWell, I admit there is a third category like Native Instruments for example which uses the 2 modes of monotimbral and multitimbral design.\n\nAre you familiar with multitimbrality?\n\nWe speak of multitimbrality on a physical keyboard when it plays several sounds. In general a piano on midi channel 1, a violin on midi channel 2 and a drum kit on channel 10 for example.\n\nFor those who don’t know midi, it is a standard for driving physical synths in computer music.\n\nThis standard also applies to virtual synths. Like Stylus RMX, Omnisphere, Trilian.\n\nAnd here is an important originality in the use of these tools. Instead of loading 5 Omnispheres, 1 Keyscape and 2 Trilian each on their respective tracks, we can load all these sounds into one Omnisphere 2.\n\nThis virtual synth uses Logic’s multitimbral mode, which consumes less processor resources of your computer.\n\nHow do I optimize Omnisphere on a Logic Pro slice?\n\nExample number 1\n\nYou want to use the “Ambient Space Piano” sound on your musical composition.\n\nYou have not used Omnisphere on any track, let’s go through the steps:\n\nCreate a new software instrument track by selecting Omnisphere as in the example below.\n\nIn this mode, we use the Omnisphere engine to drive a sound bank.\n\nRemember: 1 track = 1 channel strip = 1 synth with a loaded sound bank\n\nIf we don’t intend to use other sounds from Spectrasonics, that’s fine.\n\nExample number 2\n\nNow let’s imagine that we would like to use the SID In The Water Amp bank in addition to the Ambient Space Piano sound.\n\nThe first step in Omnisphere: click on button 2 (in red) as in the image below.\n\nAnd then in the browser go and look for the SID In The Water Amp bank (in green) which is in the Retro Land directory.\n\nIn this case, the multitimbrality of the Omnisphere virtual instrument is exploited, with up to 8 channels.\n\nHere are the 5 steps to set up Logic’s track to use the multitimbral mode:\n\nGo to the Track inspector and click on the disclosure triangle next to the “Track” label to open the Track inspector.\n\nIn this inspector check the midi output channel as in the example below\n\nThe information displayed shows you the “All” setting, change it to channel 1.\n\nNormally on the track you see the information CA1 (in red) for channel 1 very useful when using many tracks.\n\nAs in the image below you will create a new track by going to Logic’s main menu on “Track”, scroll down to “Others” select and click on new track with the following MIDI channel. Or on the track press ⌃ the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Return).\n\nSo if your musical composition does not require more than 8 banks from Spectrasonics’ Steam Engine collections, you will only need to load one virtual synth. CPU saving guaranteed!\n\nOnce you have got used to this mode of operation, you will discover a small defect. If you mute the track or perform a Solo as it concerns the same instrument, the tracks with the channels will all be mutated or all in solo mode as in figures 1a and 1b. Solutions:\n\nUse the On/Off button in the track header to replace the Mute button.\n\nConcerning the use of the Solo button there are several possibilities:\n\nAlso in the track header, the On/Off button together with the Solo button.\n\nSolo the regions.\n\nBy using Omnisphere in multi-output and working with the mixer, a complex feature for which I will not go into detail in this article.\n\nFormerly with the Midi Environment which goes into “Legacy” mode, meaning that it becomes a Legacy of Logic Pro, since version 10.7.3.\n\nSo the Environment window no longer appears in this version, if you want to know more about it, I invite you to read this information from Apple.\n\nWhy not manage everything in Omnisphere?\n\nIt is possible if you wish according to 2 cases:\n\n1 software instrument track that manages the 8 midi channels of the 8 sounds of an Omnisphere! Not very practical from my point of view. Yes, each region will contain the midi information on 8 channels which will not be easy to manage…\n\nYou wish to layering your sounds on the condition that you set the MIDI channel corresponding to the midi channel of the software instrument track.\n\nLet’s detail the Layering together:\n\nThe midi channel settings are performed in the Omnisphere synth’s Multi mode as shown in the image below.\n\nThe MIDI channel settings can vary according to your needs, so it’s up to you to experiment, keeping in mind your CPU management.\n\nFor sound design this mode of operation can reveal nuggets especially in Orb mode…\n\nFor example, midi channel 1 for a lead sound, midi channel 2 for a bass and midi channel 3 to play a stack of 4 tones from a Pad bank.\n\nIt’s easy to see why Spectrasonics appealed to film music producers. Here are some examples.\n\nLogic Pro’s Multitimbral Tip!\n\nWhen creating a new software instrument track, if you look closely at the details, you can directly choose the number of Multitimbral tracks to use in this window.\n\nBy default 4 is good, but if you have selected 8 and you only use 6 don’t forget to clean up by deleting the extra 2."
