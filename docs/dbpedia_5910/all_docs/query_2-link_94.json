        "text": "Sonic Extensionsâ„¢ is a new brand of innovative products created by Spectrasonics, that introduces a completely new experience for Omnisphere.\n\nThe core leadership team from Spectrasonics is:\n\nEric Persing - Founder/Creative Director\n\nLorey Persing - Co-Founder\n\nIgnacio Longo - Vice President\n\nTolga Gurpinar - Director of Design\n\nSeth Norman - Sonic Extensions Director\n\nJohn Martin - Chief Marketing Officer\n\nMatt Stabile - Software Manager\n\nMany more great people from the amazing Spectrasonics team contribute to supporting Sonic Extensions too!\n\nEach Sonic Extension focuses on a specific aesthetic with Next Level Sounds, purpose-built Custom Controls, and two exclusive new Effects - which can be used on anything inside Omnisphere.\n\nNot only does each one have a vast array of stunning new sounds, but also brand new ways of interacting with them, like their unique interface of Custom Controls. They also have an amazing new feature called Scenes, which gives you inspiring sonic variations within one patch.\n\nTECH SUPPORT\n\nAs a Sonic Extensions customer, you automatically receive free technical support from Spectrasonics, and your purchases are fully integrated into your Spectrasonics User Account.\n\nSMART UPDATE SYSTEM\n\nFor maximum convenience, all Sonic Extensions are fully integrated into the Spectrasonics Smart Update system, making it very easy to automatically keep up to date on all improvements and additions we make to your Sonic Extensions.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nEvery Sonic Extension is developed in coordination with the Spectrasonics Team, which means that it is fully tested and designed according to the latest specifications for Omnisphere. Each sound is also fully tagged and continuously revised to keep up to date with Spectrasonics current official guidelines for perfect integration with the Omnisphere browser.\n\nEach Sonic Extension Patch includes five unique Scenes we've created, which are really different sounds in their own right - so you can think of each patch as having multiple patches in one! The total number of sounds listed includes the amount of patches, scenes, and new soundsources in that Sonic Extension.\n\nDue to the nature of electronic delivery products, returns/refunds are not available for Sonic Extensions. We strongly encourage you to check out the videos and sound demos for each title to get a better idea of the sounds and features before buying. We have a great deal of media, demos and information here on the website to explore which will help you make an informed purchase.\n\nAfter purchasing and installing a new Sonic Extension, Omnisphere must then be re-authorized in order to use it.\n\nLoad an instance of Omnisphere, and you will be prompted on the splash screen to authorize Omnisphere to play the new Extensions you have installed. Click AUTHORIZE and follow the on-screen directions to reauthorize Omnisphere to use your new Sonic Extensions.\n\nThe Sonic Extension effects units are integrated into Omnisphere itself, so they currently work only within Omnisphere. However, you CAN import your own audio into Omnisphere by simply drag-dropping standard WAV/AIFF audio files onto the interface. Once the audio is imported, you can use any of the Sonic Extension effects on the imported audio!"
