        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nSALES, UPGRADES, DELIVERY:\n\nWhere can I purchase Trilian?\n\nPhysical sales (boxed with USB drive) are handled exclusively through our Authorized Resellers. Download sales and Upgrades are now available for purchase in our Webstore.\n\nIs there an upgrade for Trilogy users?\n\nYes! If you already are a Trilogy customer, you are eligible for the Trilian Upgrade - available now in the Webstore.\n\nIs there a DEMO version of Trilian I can try?\n\nBecause of the size of our instruments, we don't offer Demo versions. However, you can contact one of our local dealers in your area in order to arrange a live demo of Trilian. To find a local dealer in your area, please contact your local Authorized Reseller.\n\nHow are Spectrasonics Instruments delivered to new users?\n\nAll Spectrasonics instruments are available in two different editions: Boxed and Download. The physical boxed editions now contain high quality USB drives and are sold exclusively to new customers through our Authorized Resellers. The download editions are now available and sold exclusively through our Webstore.\n\nHow is the Upgrade delivered? Is it downloadable? How big?\n\nThe Trilian Upgrade package is a 34GB download which you can order through our Webstore.\n\nWhere do I order the upgrade from? Can I get the upgrade through my local dealer?\n\nUpgrades are available exclusively through the Spectrasonics Webstore.\n\nDoes Spectrasonics allow for used sales/license transfers of Trilian?\n\nPlease see the License Transfer FAQs area of the Knowledgebase for more info on our License Transfer Policy.\n\nCan I upgrade if I bought a used copy of Trilogy?\n\nYes, but only if that copy of Trilogy has been properly license transferred through Spectrasonics.\n\nSOUNDS:\n\nHow large is the core library?\n\nOver 34 Gigabytes! There are many hundreds of different Soundsources and Patches, some containing many thousands of samples each, and with more new patches and sounds being added over time.\n\nIs everything from Trilogy included in Trilian?\n\nYes, of course!\n\nWhat's the total number of sounds in Trilian now?\n\n3,189 and growing!\n\nDoes it contain all the samples from the original Trilogy?\n\nYes! All the original core library samples and enhanced versions of all the classic Trilogy sounds are included.\n\nDoes Trilian include \"classic samples\" from libraries such as Bass Legends?\n\nYes! Bass Legends was Spectrasonics' very first product, and was released in 1994. It features Abraham Laboriel, Marcus Miller and John Patittucci. The Bass Legends sounds have also been remastered, enhanced and added to Trilian as a special bonus.\n\nThere are a wide variety of basses included, and because they are smaller files, they will load quickly. If you are composing and need a quick bass sound, these provide a great starting point.\n\nAll the Bass Legends sounds have been enhanced using the STEAM engine FX, and we even added release noises and other improvements, so they sound even better than ever!\n\nCONCEPTS:\n\nWhat is Trilian?\n\nTrilian is an amazingly versatile and award-winning software instrument plug-in designed for world-class Acoustic, Electric and Synth Basses. Trilian is based on the same in-house \"STEAM engine\" technology that Spectrasonics uses for the flagship Omnisphere synthesizer. Trilian features a massive 34 GB core library (ten times the size of Trilogy!), extensive sound creation and performance capabilities, a fully featured arpeggiator with a unique Groove-Lock system for syncing with Stylus RMX grooves, over thirty built-in effects and much, much more!\n\nIs Trilian a Stand-alone app or a Plugin?\n\nBoth! It's a plug-in that works in all the major DAWs and Plug-in hosts that support VST/AU/AAX platforms and includes a very convenient stand-alone application.\n\nWhat is the STEAM engine?\n\nSTEAMâ„¢ is our in-house core technology that is the foundation of Trilian, Keyscape, Omnisphere and upcoming Spectrasonics instruments.\n\nSo does Trilian replace Trilogy?\n\nYes, Trilian is Trilogy's successor.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY/REQUIREMENTS:\n\nWhat are the minimum system requirements for Trilian?\n\nYou can view them HERE.\n\nIs it compatible with xxx?\n\nCheck our Compatibility FAQs in the Knowledgebase which we keep up to date with the latest info.\n\nWill Trilian replace my Trilogy plug-in?\n\nNo. Trilian is a brand new plug-in.\n\nDoes Trilian use Copy Protection?\n\nYes, please see the Copy Protection FAQs area of the Knowledgebase for more information on our system.\n\nDoes Trilian include a manual?\n\nAll our instruments include a comprehensive online Reference Guide, which is accessible directly through the plug-in. The integrated Reference Guide is searchable and we can keep it up to date with the software releases. You can check out the Reference Guide HERE .\n\nHow fast of a computer will I need to run Trilian?\n\nAs with all virtual instruments - the faster the better. Trilian is designed to run optimally on modern computers. See the System Requirements for more information.\n\nDoes Trilian need as much CPU power as Omnisphere?\n\nNo. Bass sounds require far less polyphony than most of the sounds in Omnisphere, and as a result typically require significantly less CPU power to run. However, Trilian's largest sounds contain upwards of 10,000+ samples, so it can take much more memory resources and we recommend having an 8gb system.\n\nIs Trilian 64 bit?\n\nYes! All our instruments are 64-bit native on both Mac and Windows.\n\nDoes Trilian use streaming?\n\nYes! Trilian streams from the drive for quick loading of the sounds. Drive streaming is also configurable.\n\nCan I selectively install parts of the Trilian library since it is so large?\n\nBecause of patch compatibility, Trilian must always be installed with the complete library. However, you can install the 35 Gigabyte library to a secondary or external drive if you wish.\n\nWill Trilian's streaming benefit from a faster hard drive?\n\nFaster SSD drives are a smart way to go of course. There's a chapter in the Reference Guide devoted to optimizing Performance with Trilian."
