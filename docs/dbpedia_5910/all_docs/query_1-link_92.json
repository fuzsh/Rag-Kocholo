        "text": "Spectrasonics celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Bob Moog Tribute Library 2 with a free update that adds over 500 newly crafted patches.\n\nTen years ago Spectrasonics published the Bob Moog Tribute Library for the software synthesizer Omnisphere. With this one, Eric Persing and his team want to say thank you for Bob Moog’s work and the Foundation’s innovative projects like their “Dr. Bob’s SoundSchool” student outreach program or the ‘Moogseum’ in Asheville, NC.\n\nThe praiseworthy thing about this: all proceeds go to the Bob Moog Foundation, which is managed by B.M’s daughter Michelle Moog-Koussa. To celebrate the 10th birthday, Spectrasonics has renewed the library and released a Bob Moog Tribute 2 Library, which is a free update for existing customers.\n\nSpectrasonics BMTL 2\n\nThe first version came with 700 patches but also numerous new waveforms from Moog synthesizers for the Omnisphere engine. The 2.0 edition now includes over 500 brand-new patches created by Spectrasonics’ founder Eric Persing and the company’s renowned sound development team.\n\nIt now has in total over 1300 fantastic sounds for Omnisphere 2, created by more than 50 of the world’s top synth artists, remixers, sound designers including Hans Zimmer, Vince Clarke, Jean Michel Jarre, Jordan Rudess, Money Mark (Beastie Boys/Beck), Ryuichi Sakamoto (YMO), Richard Devine, Diego Stocco, and more.\n\nAll in all, a very welcome update for MTL. A nice gesture by Eric Persing and his team to reissue the library again.\n\nSpectrasonics Bob Moog Tribute Library 2 is available now for Omnisphere 2.6+ at the Spectrasonics webstore for $99 USD. The update is free of charge for all previous owners of the library. All income goes to the Bob Moog Foundation.\n\nMore information here: Spectrasonics"
