        "text": "Westlake Village, CA – May 30, 2023 – Leading distributor of virtual instruments and audio processing software ILIO and electronic music producer, sound-designer, and musician Reverb Machine announce a new collection of patches for Spectrasonics Omnisphere called “The Fame Series: Modern Pop 2.” The Fame Series are patch libraries for Spectrasonics Omnisphere dedicated to capturing the sounds of famous tracks throughout the ages. Modern Pop 2 (the fourth installment in the Fame Series) is a collection of famous synth sounds used in today’s popular music. With Modern Pop 2, the focus is on songs from current, chart-topping artists. And since these patches are replicated from famous songs, they’ll add that hit-making magic with very little fuss.\n\nThis new patch collection is now available from ILIO and its vast dealer network.\n\nLearn more here – https://www.ilio.com/the-fame-series-modern-pop-2\n\nRepresented in this collection are sounds that pay homage to Doja Cat, Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, The Kid Laroi, Lizzo, Miley Cyrus, Lil Nas X, Caroline Polachek, Post Malone, Charlie Puth, Olivia Rodrigo, Rosalia Saoko, Rosalia Versace, Taylor Swift, Charli XCX, Ariana Grande, Beyoncé, Drake, Lady Gaga, Cardi B, Robyn, Sam Smith, Mimi Webb, Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran, Christine and the Queens and more. Modern Pop 2 provides great starting points for new, organic compositions.\n\nWhile the sounds of Modern Pop 2 may have gold record status and are very recognizable in their original context, they really come to life when called into service in original music.

After working predominantly as a live musician, he started exploring the world of synthesizers, sharing presets and sound design tips on reverbmachine.com. Topics include the synth sounds of popular artists, the generative music techniques of Brian Eno, and music theory. He also produces content for Reverb.com and is currently working on a debut album.\n\nModern Pop 2 requires Omnisphere version 2.8, which is a free update available for all registered Omnisphere 2 users.\n\nAbout ILIO\n\nFounded in 1994, ILIO is a leading distributor of virtual instruments and audio processing software for the Pro Audio and MI industries.
