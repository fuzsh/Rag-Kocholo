So \"Sudeep\" essentially means PURE LIGHT.\n\nWhen our parent company - Sudeep Studio - was founded on September 23, 1977 by Shri Nikhil Mehta in Mumbai, India, his main intention was to help talented musicians get their careers rolling. He called it \"Sudeep\" - a guiding light for all and sundry.\n\nAt SudeepAudio.com (born September 23, 1999), we strive to live upto his vision, and be every musician's true friend."
