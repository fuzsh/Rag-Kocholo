        "text": "Cutting edge collection of over 1200 Omnisphere patches for users who also have Keyscape\n\nSpectrasonics has released the new “Keyscape Creative” library, a cutting-edge collection of over 1200 Omnisphere 2 patches specially designed for users who also have Keyscape. The vast new library was produced by Spectrasonics’ Founder, Eric Persing, and features a tremendous variety of patches created by the company’s renowned Sound Development team, to showcase the power of combining Keyscape and Omnisphere 2. Keyscape’s richly detailed keyboard sounds can be dramatically transformed using Omnisphere 2’s deep synthesis capabilities. The recently expanded team spent over a year to develop these unique sounds. The new patches offer an extremely wide variety of incredible sounds for modern music producers and are available now as a free update.\n\nSpectrasonics spent over ten years creating the award-winning Keyscape virtual instrument, which contains the largest selection of collector keyboards in the world. Keyscape was recently released by the company to wide acclaim. Omnisphere 2 is the flagship software synthesizer of Spectrasonics, which brings together many types of synthesis technologies. The “Keyscape Creative” library is available now for current users of both Omnisphere 2 and Keyscape – users can simply update both products to get the new patches, which then appear in Omnisphere 2’s Patch Browser as a new Directory.\n\n“In the process of creating these patches, we really had a blast being surprised by each other’s work,” said producer Eric Persing. “In fact, it was almost impossible to tell which of Keyscape’s keyboards had been used! After we finished, the huge amount of sounds in the new library is almost like a completely new instrument in itself. We are thrilled to provide a new palette of colors to our users and can’t wait to hear what they do with it!”\n\nKeyscape Patch Library v1.1d Update:\n\n• NEW “Keyscape Creative” library with over 1,200 Omnisphere Patches\n\n• Thinning optimization dramatically improves performance on LA Custom C7 Piano patches\n\n• Adds “TWEAK” page to LA Custom C7 Piano Patches for more detailed control\n\n• Adds 15 Velocity Curves for popular keyboards\n\nVarious fixes and enhancements have also been made in the Keyscape v1.0.2c and Omnisphere v2.3.2f software updates, which were also released today to ensure full compatibility with the new Keyscape Creative Library.
