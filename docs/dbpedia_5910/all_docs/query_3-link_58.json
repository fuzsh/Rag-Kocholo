        "text": "Vintage Manufactured “Complimiter” Available Worldwide\n\nPictured at Vintage King Nashville are (L-R) Bill Cheney of Spectra Sonics and Vintage King’s National Sales Rep Chad Evans holding the new Spectra Sonics V610 Complimiter.\n\nLegendary pro audio manufacturer Spectra Sonics, creator of the prized 610 Complimiter in 1969, is now back in business with worldwide availability of its new products through M1 Distribution. There have been no revisions or changes on the core circuit design since the introduction of the original Spectra Sonic products.\n\n“Spectra Sonics is back and M1 Distribution is extremely excited to bring a revered, classic brand to the international pro audio marketplace,” stated Miko Mader, M1 Director of Operations.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Spectra Sonics developed the first compressor limiter that could provide independent, or combined peak limiting functions. The 610 Complimiter went on to become a standard by which other like devices were compared. The 610 was the first device of this type to eliminate compression pumping, the need for de-essing and maintained full bandwidth at ratios of up to 100:1.\n\nThe signature Spectra Sonics sound is known historically in such legendary studios as Record Plant, Ardent, Stax, Advision, Strawberry, and Atlantic Studio “C”. The significant factor of the Spectra Sonics amplifier circuits is the lack of design revision over time. The circuits used in all current Spectra Sonics products were designed almost 50 years ago, from 1964 to 1971. In fact, Spectra Sonics still uses the same test procedures, and in many cases, the same test equipment from this early period.\n\nBill Cheney of Spectra Sonics, commented, “Fifty years of peak free performance, maximum headroom, minimum distortion, preserving the total harmonic signature without loss due to amplifier overload — this was the promise made by Spectra Sonics in 1965, and the commitment continues today with the same quality and performance standards. 2015 has been our most productive since the early years. The overwhelming acceptance of our V610 and the new alliance with M1 has provided a strong foundation that will continue to expand in the years to come”.\n\n“Our exclusive alliance with Spectra Sonics has fulfilled a long-term commitment to our customers — expertise plus consistent and reliable support from folks who love the art,” remarked M1s Miko Mader. “Look for Spectra Sonics to offer quality mic pre’s and a stereo version of the 610 in a ‘vintage format’ like the V610.” Spectra Sonics and M1 have given a one-year period of exclusivity for the 610 and V610 to Vintage King Audio within the USA.\n\nAbout Spectra Sonics\n\nFounding Spectra Sonics in1964, William G. Dilley was an engineer/pilot who began creating audio equipment for broadcast, recording studio and motion picture purposes. In 1969, the inventor created the 610 Complimiter, a piece of outboard gear that allowed for a compressor and limiter to be used separately or at the same time. For over 40 years, the 610 has been a favorite of engineers, which led to the release of an updated modern version, the V610, in early 2015.
