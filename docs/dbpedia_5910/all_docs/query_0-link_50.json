        "text": "7 Days of Sound Design - How to Patch Omnisphere!\n\nAn entire weeks worth of material covering synthesis and sonics - guided by the one and only Michael (MIDIhead) Babbitt. 7 Days of Sound Design explores different sound design techniques and tricks with seven individual videos. Each video focuses on different patches and the sound design concepts used to create themâ€”from basic envelope control to layering complementary sounds, to advanced modulation techniques, all while utilizing Spectrasonics' powerful synthesizer Omnisphere 2. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artisan, you're bound to learn something new in just a few minutes a day.\n\nDownload the free patches and follow along!\n\nDownload HERE\n\n\"I chose Omnisphere because of the sonic capabilities it offers - from the huge arsenal of DSP waveforms to the plethora of core library sounds and modulation routing. The fact that it is a chameleon is a huge plus because I can create sounds for pretty much any genre on the planet,\" said MIDIhead.\n\n\"Mike Babbitt, aka MIDIhead, is the right guy to do this project with ILIO,\" says co-founder Mark Hiskey. \"Mike's been involved with Omnisphere from the very beginning and has an intuitive sense of what makes it special. While these videos just hint at what's possible with Omnisphere, he does a great job of pealing back the layers and before you know it you're learning some pretty deep concepts.\"\n\nAlthough Omnisphere is the agent for sound design in this series, MIDIhead clarifies that you do not need to own Omnisphere to follow along and learn something new. \"Even though I'm using Omnisphere as a vehicle for sound design in these videos (for 7 Days of Sound Design), I'm covering basic principles that carry across the history of synthesis from classic analog to modern styles.\"\n\nDay 1 - Huge Pad\n\nDay 2 - Noise Riser\n\nDay 3 - Analog Poly Synth\n\nDay 4 - Synth Bell\n\nDay 5 - Synth Hybrid Drum\n\nDay 6 - Vocal Phrase Granular\n\nDay 7 - Voxxy Arp\n\nAbout Michael (MIDIhead) Babbitt\n\nMichael (MIDIhead) Babbitt is an electronic music producer and songwriter who's released an award-winning synthpop album and remixed songs from Kaskade and Late Night Alumni, has had original scores in movie trailers for The Matrix Reloaded, Silent Hill, and Mad Max: Fury Road, as well as a variety of television shows such as Dexter, CSI, Prison Break, MythBusters, Miami Ink, America's Next Top Model (to name a few) and many remixes and original songs appearing in Konami's Dance, Dance, Revolution video game series. He's also produced all of ILIO's Omnisphere patch libraries.\n\nAbout ILIO\n\nFounded in 1994, ILIO is a leading distributor of virtual instruments and audio processing software for the Pro Audio and MI industries in North America. They represent products used by hundreds of top-shelf recording artists, studio musicians, composers and producers.
