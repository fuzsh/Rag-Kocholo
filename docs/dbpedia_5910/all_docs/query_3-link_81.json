        "text": "@ Peter V _ ready to purchase. OTH plz revisit total market place as it exists _ .\n\nNo concerns whatever, as Intro deals with top several % Synth /Softsynth deepdivers.\n\nYet pyramid of potential market overwhelms numbers of wizards /gurus. Plz continue providing additional Vids _ helping next level of impressed, modestly capable, Users _ as we/they pursue full understanding of NOVUM power _ now, and much longer-term.\n\nPersonal perspective is home studio, decades-long Spectrasonics user _ K13U CE _ Pigments 3, Vital Plus, Spire _ vast 3rd Pty expansions. Gut feel says NOVUM is major step forward, and strong desire to take more time, than ever before, to become as proficient as possible/practical.\n\nThere is also a 90 days free trial - w/o limitations. Just download and install, in the plugin click UNLOCK to start the 90 days trial period!\n\nYes, I will do more videos, if there are any specific interests just let me know. At the moment I am mainly helping users who have very specific issues on their system, like outdated audio drivers, non-conforming openGL drivers etc. ... so it may take a few days before I find the time.\n\nQ. So, DAWSOME is the developer of NOVUM , this is the first time I hear their name. Did the Tracktion development team contribute to the development of NOVUM as well, or was NOVUM developed exclusively by DAWSOME ?\n\nTo give it a face - this is me - I am \"Peter V\" aka Dawesome. I am an indie developer and I have developed Novum completely on my own, of course with feedback from sound designers etc.\n\nNovum is my third commercial plugin, one year ago I had my debut with Abyss, which introduced the idea of tone-colours.\n\nBeing a one-person-company I need to focus, and for me this is the creation of instruments, it is not the marketing, the sales ... so I partner with tracktion who are taking care for the distribution, the marketing, the tax thingies (I even don't know the exact terms) and such.\n\nHi @Peter V ,\n\nThank You for developing NOVUM. You are on the right track, I'm very inspired by what you are doing, and I'm sure you have plans to take it to the next level via updates..etc.\n\nPartnering with Tracktion to have them handle the business/marketing side of things is a very smart strategy, you can keep your focus on development of innovative, and cutting-edge software musical instruments.\n\nIt's a pleasure to meet you via this forum, and I wish you lots of success in your current, and future projects.\n\nCheers,\n\nMuziksculp\n\nThere is also a 90 days free trial - w/o limitations.

At the moment I am mainly helping users who have very specific issues on their system, like outdated audio drivers, non-conforming openGL drivers etc. ... so it may take a few days before I find the time.\n\nKudos for Trial !! Already running nicely in desktop pc Win11 Pro /Reaper v6.61.\n\nManipulating effectively is another issue. Huge benefit with your large Preset content at Intro !\n\nNot impatient _ empathetic with your individual, entrepreneurial challenges.\n\nPlz just keep very large, evolving (shallow-diver) user-base' as part of routine tutorials and feature videos.\n\n@muziksculp I’ve found it best to not approach Novum as a traditional sampler, or even a granular synth in the traditional sense. It is unequivocally it’s own beast. The Timbre Flower, SYNTIFY and Homogenized alone are worth the price of admission, imho.\n\nI truly believe that Peter V. ,aka Dawesome, has created a new category of synthesis. It goes well beyond the “hybrid” moniker.\n\nWords fail. Maybe an emoticon won’t:\n\nI like Novum because I can go where Abyss didn't take me, and that's creating my own sounds. Having a Kontakt library of prepared sampled sounds is cool, but there is a certain satisfaction with importing your own field recordings and having it mangled in Novum. In that sense, it behaves like a generative synth, you know, just tweak a few parameters then stand back and watch the machine do its thing. It's alive! It's alive!\n\nI like Novum because I can go where Abyss didn't take me, and that's creating my own sounds.

It's alive!\n\nAbsolute fav movie !\n\nBest line _ when Inga asks about his 'schwanzschtucker' .....\n\nMay try dropping that audio into NOVUM and hope for best !\n\nTrying out the free demo and wow this thing is wild!\n\nI am however echoing some of the previous comments about having multi sample support would be ideal for this. Sure you can import 6 samples into the different slots but then you loose the ability to individually manipulate the various layers which is what really makes this a unique take on a familiar concept.\n\nWould it be possible to add support for 6-8 slots which you could map across the octaves without sacrificing the ability to decompose each sample? It wouldn't have to be very intrusive to the (beautiful) interface either - just numbered buttons to the left of the main visualiser window for example.\n\nYes you can manipulate each of the 6 samples but as far as I can tell, each of the samples are not \"decomposed\" like they are when you drop it into the main window. Hence it becomes more akin to a traditional granular instrument with samples spread across the keyboard (albeit a great one).\n\nWhat I'm proposing is to keep the decomposing feature with truly makes NOVUM unique and add multisample support to that."
