        "text": "Really great FM vst synth. Based on the DX7 but takes all the complicated editing away (as much as you can take it away...FM is inherently more complex than subtractive synthesis) and gives you a wide range of easy to tweak tools.\n\nPersonally I think it shines in a few areas. Brilliant for FM bass, digital sounding sharp synth noises and slow eloving pads. Skrilliex uses it a lot and I can absolutely see why, with the way you can introduce dirt and overtones this thing can, if programmed well, absolutely scream.\n\nThe interface, and dare I say sound quality, could probably do with a refresh these days as it's not really been updated or developed in about 10 years, but it really is one of the standout vst synths.\n\nShort of owning a DX7, Native Instruments' FM8 is one of your best choices when it comes to FM synthesis. In addition to providing basic envelope, filter, and operator functions, FM8 steps things up by adding effects, processing, additional equalization, and arpeggiation.\n\nFM synthesis is kind of intimidating if you ask me, but FM8 has made the discovery process much easier and more intuitive than I ever thought it would be. If you're on the fence about FM synthesis, I might pick up a cheaper option— if you're serious about FM synthesis, however, there simply isn't a better software option on the market than FM8.\n\nNative Instruments is a German technology company that develops software and hardware for music production and DJing. The company was originally known for their software instruments, but has also expanded its product line to include various other music equipment segments in recent years. Current products of Native Instruments include software synthesizers, samplers and effect processors, sound libraries and emulations of acoustic instruments, groove production systems and audio interfaces, as well as various products for computer-based DJing that include DJ software, Digital Vinyl Systems, hardware controllers and specific DJ audio interfaces. Native Instruments was founded in 1996 in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin, Germany, where its headquarters are still located. It also has branches in Los Angeles, Tokyo, Shenzhen and London. The company also holds a partnership with the online music store Beatport.\n\nI don't usually use software synths unless I make them myself, but when I really need a good sound and I don't feel like hooking up one of my hardware synths, I use this, it's good, but I don't really like any of the presets that come with it so I just tweak it until I can find something I like.\n\nI have it cause it comes with Komplete but I rarely use it...but it has good reviews though it must be getting long in the tooth now and is probably due an upgrade. When I have messed around with it the sound is great though I do not understand FM hehe.\n\nThis is what I use to create growls, plucks, pads, etc. I mainly use this with Ableton plugins and other 3rd party audio effect plugins.\n\nThis is not for the starter. This took me weeks of dinking around to learn even how FM synthesis worked, then another month to learn the synth itself. I wish the interface was even more user friendlier but I have already learned this so don't change a thing"
