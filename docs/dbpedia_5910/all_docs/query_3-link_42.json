        "text": "The Spectra 1964 Model C610 Complimiter is a modern spin on the V610 Complimiter. While the V610 is a near-identical recreation of the classic Model 610 Complimenter by Spectra Sonics, the C610 offers updated features like higher bandwidth Cinemag transformers, external power supply, selectable input padding and more.\n\nMODEL 610 COMPLIMITER\n\nAs its name implies, the C610 Complimiter can be used as a compressor or a peak limiterâ€”either separately or simultaneously. Peak limiting mode lets you stealthily remove transient peaks. Mode 2 offers peak limiting with limited compression, which applies mild compression in addition to removing peaks. In compression-only mode, gain reduction is constantly applied for smooth, subtle gain reduction.\n\nAfter it was originally released in 1969, the Model 610 Complimiter quickly earned a reputation as the fastest, quietest, and most versatile analog dynamics processor on the market. Now, over 50 years later, the Spectra 1964 Model C610 Complimiter delivers the same iconic tone and versatility with a number of major improvements.\n\nC610 COMPLIMITER\n\nThe C610 utilizes the 601 compressor/limiter module, with a 101 Preamplifier for make-up gain. Ideal for tracking, bus processing, and mastering, the Spectra 1964 C610 Complimiter puts the limitless tone-shaping capabilities of the Model 610 Complimiter at your fingertips.\n\nFeaturing an updated design, the C610 offers lower distortion, less noise, and improved output levels. High resolution detented controls make dialing in the perfect tone quick and easy. The slope control can be used to dial in the compression ratio, while the release time allows you to dial in lighting-fast peak-limiting, soft and slow compression, or anything in between. The new C610 Complimiter also features a dedicated input pad for proper gain staging."
