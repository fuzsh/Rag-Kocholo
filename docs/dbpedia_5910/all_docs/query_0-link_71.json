From classic Rhodes and Wurlitzer pianos to more modern instruments like the Yamaha CP70 and the Hohner Pianet, there is a huge variety to choose from. The electric keyboard instruments in Keyscape are ideal for musicians who want to add a vintage or retro sound to their tracks and music.\n\nRare and unique instruments in Keyscape\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Keyscape is its collection of rare and unique instruments. These include instruments such as the Celesta, a keyboard instrument that sounds like a glockenspiel, and the Chimeatron, a type of electric organ. There are also more experimental instruments such as the Wing Upright, a piano with wings that produce a unique sound.\n\nUsing Keyscape in your music production\n\nIf you are a musician or producer looking for a high-quality collection of virtual instruments, Keyscape is definitely worth considering. It is compatible with virtually all DAWs, and the included instruments are ideal for a wide range of genres and styles.
