If the music bed you’ve chosen “isn’t quite getting there…”, my custom music embellishment and composition skills utilize a wide range of virtual instrument software that can bring your content building blocks to the next level. When you’re getting close to the finish line and it’s time to swap out your bruised and battered scratch VO for professional talent, I can take care of voice-over recording via Source-Connect with remote direction through a videoconferencing platform of your choosing. Time to bring it all together? I can add sound design, subtle to cinematic, that perfectly complements your aesthetic and bring the entire audio mix into focus. Given that the majority of digital content consumption is happening in headphones or ear buds, I offer final delivery of full stereo mixes and stems via Frame.IO. The tools I use to elevate your content experience include iZotope RX10, Clarity Vx, Native Instruments, Spectrasonics, XLN Audio, Toontrack, Hit’n’Mix, Source Elements, Pro Tools Ultimate, McDSP, Soundtoys, and various Waves plugins.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://www.everbsound.com\n\nExternal link for Everb Sound LLC\n\nIndustry\n\nMedia Production\n\nCompany size\n\n1 employee\n\nHeadquarters\n\nDecatur, Georgia\n\nType\n\nSelf-Employed"
