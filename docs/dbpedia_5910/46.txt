After years spent at Roland as a renowned sound designer, Eric Persing created Spectrasonics in 1994. At the beginning, he was developing sampling-based sound banks, considered as references at the world level. With the advent of virtual instruments, Eric Persing has transposed his sounds and developed his creative possibilities to the delight of all. His greatest successes are Stylus RMX, Omnisphere, Trilian and Keyscape.
