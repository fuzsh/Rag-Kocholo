Founded in 1994 by Los Angeles composer Eric Persing and his wife Lorey, Spectrasonics quickly became a leading developer of world-class sampled sound libraries. As Chief Sound Designer for Roland Corporation since 1984, Eric was already well-known in the music industry for creating many of the most popular sounds in their classic synthesizers, including the groundbreaking Roland D-50. By infusing his years of product design expertise, Spectrasonics earned a reputation for setting the standard of excellence in the industry.

Today, Spectrasonics has become a team of many gifted, creative people that Eric directs - sound designers, software engineers, musicians, visual artists - all working together to produce extraordinary software instruments that have a global impact on music.
