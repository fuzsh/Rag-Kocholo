        "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest and largest of three deadly coronavirus outbreaks, including those caused by SARS-CoV in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012. Despite the successes of vaccines and antibody therapeutics that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus by disrupting interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike fusion protein, mutations accumulating primarily in the S1 domain have resulted in widespread evasion of antibodies elicited against early virus strains. This has culminated in the currently circulating Omicron subvariants with >30 amino acid changes that resist neutralization by all monoclonal antibodies with Emergency Use Authorization (VanBlargan et al., 2022; Imai et al., 2023) and cause breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals. Moreover, the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans are closely related to strains found in wildlife, foreshadowing future coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nThe continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern underscores the need to identify therapeutic strategies more resistant to antigenic drift. Immunization with the entire spike ectodomain induces potently neutralizing antibodies that block binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) to the ACE2 receptor (Yuan et al., 2020), indicating that the RBD is a protective and immunogenic, as well as variable, antigen. In contrast to the S1 domain comprising the RBD and N-terminal domains, the S2 domain is highly conserved, with 63–98% sequence similarity in pairwise comparisons across the seven human coronaviruses (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Early in the pandemic, S2-directed antibodies often dominated the immune repertoire in convalescent patients, indicating that at least some S2 epitopes are immunogenic (Voss et al., 2021). Moreover, the functionally analogous domains in the fusion proteins from influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human immunodeficiency virus are targeted by protective antibodies (Impagliazzo et al., 2015; Corti et al., 2017), supporting the hypothesis that the spike S2 domain may also be an effective target.\n\nWhereas antibodies binding the spike RBD have been rigorously classified based on epitope recognized (Barnes et al., 2020) and this information used to support development of RBD mosaic vaccines (Cohen et al., 2022), a complementary analysis of the S2 domain is in its infancy. Fewer than 5% of the ~7000 anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody sequences in the CoV-AbDab database bind S2 as of July 2022 (Raybould et al., 2021). Moreover, just two classes of S2 binding antibodies have been described in the literature: those binding the fusion peptide and adjacent S2' cleavage site (Dacon et al., 2022; Low et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022) and those binding the S2 stem proximal to the viral membrane (Hsieh et al., 2021; Pinto et al., 2021; Sauer et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022). Here, we define a third class of S2 antibody that binds the highly conserved S2 hinge region, which converts from a bent hairpin to extended alpha helix during the pre-to-post-fusion spike conformational change. Evaluation of the S2 hinge epitope and the impact of spike dynamics on epitope accessibility will inform our understanding of the role of S2 domain epitopes in antibody recognition.\n\nAntibodies binding S2 are an important component of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections. They are naturally elicited, with neutralizing sera from individuals never exposed to SARS-2 common in young people and exclusively binding the S2 domain (Ng et al., 2020). This S2 response is boosted upon exposure to SARS-2 (Dowell et al., 2022). These antibodies are generally common in convalescent repertoires, with >300 anti-S2 sequences reported (Raybould et al., 2021), but with few detailed descriptions and just two epitope classes defined. Antibodies recognizing the SARS-2 S2 stem region between residues 1142–1160, proximal to the viral membrane, (Hsieh et al., 2021; Pinto et al., 2021; Sauer et al., 2021; Ullah et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) dominate linear S2 peptide responses (Ladner et al., 2021) but generally result in moderate-to-no neutralization of SARS-2 spike pseudovirus (10 to >300 nM IC50). Antibodies binding the fusion peptide, which mediates steps required for viral entry of host cells, are highly cross-reactive to α- and β-coronavirus spike proteins, typically neutralize SARS-2 pseudoviruses (Low et al., 2022) and authentic viruses (Dacon et al., 2022) with modest in vitro IC50 values >50 nM. Antibodies binding the hinge epitope in the S2 core are much less thoroughly described, although antibodies isolated from unexposed individuals that appear to bind near the hinge epitope based on negative staining EM images were enriched 37-fold upon infection (Claireaux et al., 2022). An emerging theme is that highly conserved S2 epitopes, whether located at the stem, fusion peptide or hinge, are immunogenic but often fail to mediate strong antibody neutralization (Bowen et al., 2021).\n\nBy contrast, antibodies targeting these highly conserved S2 epitopes seem to rely heavily on Fc effector functions to mediate protection by antibody-dependent viral phagocytosis, cellular cyto-toxicity, and/or trogocytosis of infected cells. The S2 stem binding antibodies S2P6 (Pinto et al., 2021) and IgG22 (Hsieh et al., 2021) protected SARS-2 challenged animals in vivo. IgG22 did not neutralize authentic virus in vitro, implicating Fc functions in protection in vivo, and S2P6 was shown to elicit ADCP and ADCC in vitro. Partial protection in a prophylaxis mouse model by stem-binding antibody CV3-25 was ablated by residues changes that silence the Fc (Ullah et al., 2021). Similarly, antibodies binding the fusion peptide moderately protected hamsters against severe disease (Dacon et al., 2022; Low et al., 2022). S2 core-binding antibodies require further validation, but those found in the human repertoire elicited ADCP and antibody-dependent cellular trogocytosis in vitro (Claireaux et al., 2022) while the hinge-binding antibody RAY53 reported here induced ADCP and ADCC in vitro (Figure 5c and d). Highly conserved S2 epitopes may be underappreciated targets based on simple neutralization assays, but valuable for eliciting effector functions against many variants, similar to antibodies binding the flu stem region (Impagliazzo et al., 2015; Corti et al., 2017).\n\nThe presence of S2 core-binding antibodies in the naïve immune repertoire and their amplification after infection with pre-Omicron strains of SARS-2 suggests that S2 core epitopes exerted immune pressure in early waves of COVID-19 infection. Antibody RAY53’s dramatic loss of binding to authentic SARS-2 Omicron BA.1 spike (Figure 4d) is consistent with evolutionary evasion of antibodies binding the S2 core as the virus has been repeatedly exposed to the human immune response. While antibody evasion by the SARS-2 spike commonly occurs through substitutions within targeted epitopes (Greaney et al., 2021; Starr et al., 2021), SARS-2 Omicron BA.1 contains only one residue change within the hinge epitope which does not alter RAY53 binding in isolation (Figure 3a). Antibody RAY53 binds soluble Omicron BA.1 HexaPro spike, albeit with a depressed on-rate (Figure 4c, Figure 4—figure supplement 4f), but did not bind authentic Omicron BA.1 spike on the cell surface or neutralize the corresponding pseudovirus (Figure 5a). Omicron BA.1 appears to protect cryptic epitopes by closely packing the RBDs in the down state and possibly stabilizing the S2-closed state when RBDs are up for ACE2 binding. This structural protection may be evolutionarily favored over mutation when altering the epitope sequence carries a high functional cost, as for the hinge epitope (Figure 3d).\n\nSARS-2 spike is a highly dynamic protein, sensitive to many variables including temperature (Edwards et al., 2021), pH (Zhou et al., 2020), and glycosylation (Casalino et al., 2020). Each of the RBDs has the potential to flip up, which has been captured in cryo-EM images of closed, one-up, two-up, and three-up spikes (Benton et al., 2020). Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations indicated that movement of the S1 domains during opening extends deeper into the protein than previously appreciated (Zimmerman et al., 2021), while HDX analysis has observed an open-S2 conformation with a splayed spike trimer that exposes core S2 epitopes (Costello et al., 2022). Notably, these movements impact hinge epitope accessibility, indicating that antibody binding to this region involves multiple kinetic steps (Figure 2f). Data showing enhanced binding to spike variants favoring the S2 open state (Figure 2c–e) and similar neutralization of authentic spike on pseudo-viruses by 3A3 and RAY53 (Figure 5a) despite the latter’s increased affinity (Figure 4e) indicate that spike S2 opening is the rate-limiting step in antibody binding. Results shown here also underscore that these rates can vary depending on the local environment (soluble protein versus viral or infected cell surface) and amino acid changes present (stabilizing changes versus circulating variants), highlighting the importance of spike dynamics on antibody binding.\n\nHere, we report an S2 hinge epitope that is conserved across all highly pathogenic coronavirus strains and its interactions with two related antibodies. Immunization with 2P-stabilized spike and natural infection appears to elicit antibodies binding this epitope in the S2 core, but antibody access is restricted by spike dynamics that expose the epitope. Although targeting this epitope alone is unlikely to be potently neutralizing, strategies that enhance access to the highly conserved S2 core such as ACE2-mimicking antibodies (Low et al., 2022) may allow existing antibody repertoires to more effectively promote viral clearance by recruiting Fc effector functions. Future work will use these conformationally-selective antibodies to elucidate spike behavior in response to stabilizing and evolved mutations as well as environmental conditions including spike surface density, protease priming, and interactions with other cellular or viral membrane proteins.\n\nSenescent cells are characterized by multiple features such as increased expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA β-gal) and cell cycle inhibitors such as p21 or p16. They accumulate with tissue damage and dysregulate tissue homeostasis. In the context of skeletal muscle, it is known that agents used for chemotherapy such as Doxorubicin (Doxo) cause buildup of senescent cells, leading to the inhibition of tissue regeneration. Senescent cells influence the neighboring cells via numerous secreted factors which form the senescence-associated secreted phenotype (SASP). Lipids are emerging as a key component of SASP that can control tissue homeostasis. Arachidonic acid-derived lipids have been shown to accumulate within senescent cells, specifically 15d-PGJ2, which is an electrophilic lipid produced by the non-enzymatic dehydration of the prostaglandin PGD2. This study shows that 15d-PGJ2 is also released by Doxo-induced senescent cells as an SASP factor. Treatment of skeletal muscle myoblasts with the conditioned medium from these senescent cells inhibits myoblast fusion during differentiation. Inhibition of L-PTGDS, the enzyme that synthesizes PGD2, diminishes the release of 15d-PGJ2 by senescent cells and restores muscle differentiation. We further show that this lipid post-translationally modifies Cys184 of HRas in C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts, causing a reduction in the localization of HRas to the Golgi, increased HRas binding to Ras Binding Domain (RBD) of RAF Kinase (RAF-RBD), and activation of cellular Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP) kinase–Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (Erk) signaling (but not the Akt signaling). Mutating C184 of HRas prevents the ability of 15d-PGJ2 to inhibit the differentiation of muscle cells and control the activity of HRas. This work shows that 15d-PGJ2 released from senescent cells could be targeted to restore muscle homeostasis after chemotherapy."
