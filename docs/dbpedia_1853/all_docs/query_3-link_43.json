        "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (Aug. 8, 2024) – With courage that belies her 15 years, Harper Mathis stepped to the podium at Wellstar Children’s Hospital of Georgia and spoke to visitors from Hyundai, Wellstar Health System, Wellstar Children’s, Wellstar Georgia Cancer Center and Augusta University. When she finished, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house.\n\n“This is my second chance at life,” she told them. “Without this trial, I don’t know if I would be here today. I just got the best MRI I’ve gotten in a while.”\n\nOn Thursday, Harper and other patients at Wellstar Children’s made their mark for kids battling cancer across the country by pressing their paint-covered hands onto white stickers, which were then placed on a new white Hyundai Santa Fe. The effect is a custom handprinted paint job to commemorate Hyundai Hope on Wheels’ $400,000 grant for pediatric cancer research.\n\nEach year, Hyundai Hope on Wheels visits children’s hospitals across the U.S. to donate a two-year Scholar Hope grant to researchers working to improve outcomes and treatments for children diagnosed with cancer. The annual event also raises awareness for pediatric cancer research.\n\nThe $400,000 Scholar Hope grant will fund Dr. Ted Johnson’s research project titled, “Novel measurement of molecular immune activation to predict response to pediatric immunotherapy.” Dr. Johnson is a pediatric hematologist-oncologist at Wellstar Children’s and co-director of the Pediatric Immunotherapy Program at Wellstar Children’s and Wellstar Georgia Cancer Center.\n\nDr. Johnson and his research team are working to define the mechanisms that suppress the body’s immune response and allow tumor survival, so they can identify ways to counteract those processes and fortify the immune system to fight the tumor instead.\n\n“This grant represents another critical pledge in our fight against pediatric brain tumors,” Dr. Johnson said. “This investigation is important because the more we understand about how these tumors quietly advance, the closer we will get to developing better treatments and therapies. This could positively impact care for children with brain tumors by improving their quality of life.”\n\nThis is the fourth Hyundai grant awarded to Dr. Johnson, who has received a total of $925,000 in Hope on Wheels funding since 2011 for his pediatric immunotherapy studies. The current Scholar Hope grant will fund research to measure the immune system’s activation and response to pediatric immunotherapy.\n\nHarper and her family, who are from Michigan, have spent nearly six months at Wellstar Children’s to participate in the study.\n\n“It means the world to me that Dr. Johnson has made his life all about this trial because I needed it so badly and so do other kids,” Harper said. “So many people don’t understand how meaningful this all is and how grateful and thankful we are.\"\n\nHyundai Hope on Wheels is a nonprofit organization committed to finding a cure for childhood cancer. The organization provides grants to eligible institutions nationwide that are pursuing critical research aimed at improving treatments and saving lives.\n\nKENNESAW, Ga. (Aug. 13, 2024) — Kennesaw State University (KSU) and Wellstar Health System (Wellstar) today announced a new collaboration to support the health, wellbeing, and performance of KSU student-athletes. The partnership has three main components:\n\nWellstar has provided the lead funding commitment for a new state-of-the-art training and conditioning complex for KSU student-athletes as they compete in Conference USA.\n\nKSU and Wellstar will partner to create a new center to support the physical and mental wellbeing of KSU student-athletes and conduct cutting-edge research into sports performance; the center will be called the Center for Research on Human Sport Performance and Wellbeing.\n\nBeginning July 1, 2026, Wellstar will be the exclusive orthopedics and sports medicine provider, partner, and sponsor of the KSU Athletics Association, providing key services for Kennesaw State student-athletes.\n\nToday’s agreement builds on a longstanding partnership between the two institutions. Wellstar manages the University’s on-campus student health clinics and is the named donor of KSU’s Wellstar College of Health and Human Services and its Wellstar School of Nursing. In 2020, Wellstar made a $9 million funding commitment to help KSU double enrollment in its Bachelor of Science in Nursing program, which is helping meet Georgia’s urgent need for nurses.\n\n“We are grateful to Wellstar for their continued generosity and support of Kennesaw State’s mission,” said KSU president Kathy S. Schwaig. “Their latest contribution comes at an exciting and pivotal time for the University, and it will further strengthen our ability to train the next generation of healthcare providers, as well as to support athletic programs that will benefit our students for years to come.”\n\n“We congratulate Kennesaw State for growing its healthcare programs and expanding its medical research,” said Candice L. Saunders, president and CEO of Wellstar Health System. “We appreciate the opportunity to take an active role caring for our community’s athletes and providing the next generation of athletes with opportunities to improve their physical and mental wellness, on and off the field.”\n\nSubject to approval by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, the Sports Performance Complex and the Sports Medicine and Training Center will provide comprehensive services to more than 450 student-athletes, including injury prevention and treatment, physical therapy, and hydrotherapy, and will contain a strength and conditioning suite, training table, locker rooms, and new weight room. In addition, the complex will provide a new home for KSU’s football program with team and position meeting rooms, coaches’ offices, and a team locker room.\n\nWellstar’s funding will also support the creation of the Center for Research on Human Sport Performance and Wellbeing in the Wellstar College of Health and Human Services. The center will engage in research and teaching that explores technological methods to improve sport performance and athletes’ overall well-being.\n\nOfficials from KSU and Wellstar celebrated the agreement at a signing ceremony held on the Kennesaw campus, which comes 10 months after the University launched its most comprehensive fundraising campaign, The Campaign for Kennesaw State.\n\nKSU competes in NCAA Division I in eight men’s sports and 10 women’s sports. Since joining Division I in 2005, KSU has won 61 conference championships across a range of women’s and men’s sports.\n\nEarlier this month, KSU assistant coach Daniel Haugh competed in the Summer Olympics in Paris in the hammer throw, becoming the first former student-athlete in Kennesaw State’s Division I history to compete in the Olympics twice. Current student Emma Hunt competed in the Paris Olympics in sport climbing. Other recent success has included the KSU men’s basketball team making a memorable March Madness run to the NCAA Tournament in 2023, and track and field standout Isaiah Rogers winning the national championship in the weight throw.\n\nDr. Angello Lin, the new transplant surgery section chief at Wellstar MCG Health Medical Center, had a light bulb moment when he took three years off during his 23-year tenure as a surgeon at the Medical University of South Carolina.\n\nHe took a break to spend time in Savannah with his father, who had turned 90 and was having health issues. During that time, Dr. Lin had time to think and realized that although he had become a transplant surgeon because the work seemed dynamic, his work had not been very dynamic lately. He had been solely focused on performing the transplantations and taking care of patients for 14 years.\n\n“I started to wonder if I could add some dynamism back by finding different and better ways to do a transplant,” he said.\n\nThe break served him well as Dr. Lin went on to become the first surgeon to successfully connect a pancreas and a kidney before putting it into the patient’s body, rather than putting them in separately. Implanting them as one organ with one arterial inflow and one venous outflow reduced the patient’s time in the operating room from four to six hours to two to three hours, making the procedure safer and giving patients the potential for a quicker recovery.\n\nDr. Lin, who graduated from Emory School of Medicine, found a renewed sense of purpose in innovation in surgery and decided he wanted to work at a hospital that would encourage his innovation. That led him to Wellstar MCG Health’s transplant center, which has received grants from the Mason Trust Foundation to enhance transplant research, education and patient care. The transplant center also performed a record 105 kidney transplants last year. “The surgery department here is very supportive of me trying new ways of doing things, and I was drawn to that,” he said.\n\nDr. Lin joined the hospital in February and is already working on a pilot project that infuses therapeutics that will hopefully reduce injuries to kidneys after transplantation from ischemia repercussion. He will also help the transplant center restart its pancreas transplant program.\n\nDr. Lin spends his time outside the hospital with his wife and three daughters: Jasmine, 24, who plans to go to medical school; Camille, 21, who is studying to become a pilot; and Abigail, 13, who is in eighth grade.\n\nBorn in Taiwan, Dr. Lin moved to Tybee Island as a teen and later graduated from Emory with a bachelor’s in chemistry. He first became interested in transplant surgery during his general surgery rotations as a fourth-year resident when he saw the difference transplantation made in patients’ lives. One story that stands out to him was when he was taking care of a retired chemistry professor, a liver transplant recipient who was near death. Although the patient was depressed, he told Dr. Lin about himself, including his favorite movie—\"Dead Poets Society”—and about his dream to travel the world. The next day, Dr. Lin came into the patient’s room, stood on a chair and recited the famous poem from the film to encourage the patient.\n\n“O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells,” he said. “Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills.”\n\nThe patient went on to recover and sent Dr. Lin postcards from his travels around the world.\n\n“After a successful kidney transplant, patients are so grateful and will say, ‘I can go to the bathroom again!’” he said. “They are excited to be able to do the everyday things our bodies do that we take for granted. It’s very touching.”\n\nFollowing residency, Dr. Lin became the first trainee to complete Emory’s transplant fellowship in 2000.\n\nNow Dr. Lin estimates he’s performed over 1,500 transplant surgeries. The most difficult part of the job remains working around the nationwide organ shortage. He has to be ready to drop everything when an organ is ready to be donated and, sadly, he also has to tell patients that they are at the mercy of the waitlist.\n\n“They look to us to be the miracle workers, and some days we come close,” he said.\n\nU.S. Senator Jon Ossoff joined Wellstar and Wellstar MCG Health Medical Center leadership in cutting the ribbon on two new MRI suites that feature state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines. The machines were purchased with $3.5 million in federal funds that Ossoff secured with bipartisan support from the U.S. Senate in March 2022.\n\nThe critically needed units are located in newly designed and built MRI suites that are conveniently located between Wellstar MCG Health and Wellstar Children’s Hospital of Georgia. The updated technology allows for faster image scanning, better quality scans, and better patient access and comfort for adults and children. The new machines and suites replace two aging machines that were located in different parts of the medical campus.\n\n“Senator Ossoff listened to our friends at Augusta University when they shared how adults and children in Augusta and throughout Georgia would benefit from two new, state-of-the-art MRI machines,” said Ralph Turner, president of Wellstar MCG Health. “Today, we celebrate Senator Ossoff’s leadership and work to obtain federal funding that will improve the healthcare experience for people across our great state for years to come.”\n\n“The technology in these new machines is phenomenal and will make a noticeable difference in the care of every patient and physician who uses them,” said Dr. Annette Johnson, department chair for radiology at Wellstar MCG Health and academic chair and professor of radiology and imaging at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. “These state-of-the-art machines can compensate for patient breathing and other motion, anticipating the patient’s movement and modifying the scanning techniques to adapt to the motion. This level of sophistication results in a higher quality scan in less time.”\n\nFor context, a typical MRI exam consists of five to 10 individual scans, each of which takes several minutes to complete. If a patient moves during one of the scans, the scan must be repeated. This happens frequently since it’s very hard for people to be perfectly still for long periods of time.\n\n“If everything goes perfectly, the whole exam for a cervical spine MRI, for example, should take 25 minutes. But if the patient moves a little bit during the exam, it may take 10 or 15 additional minutes because scans have to be repeated, which makes the experience more difficult to tolerate as a patient,” said Johnson.\n\nCutting down the amount of time spent in the machine is a win-win-win. In addition to improving the quality of the scans, it is more comfortable for the patient, reduces wait times for other patients and allows for more patients to be seen.\n\n“I don’t know if it qualifies as AI, but it’s super-smart technology,” said Johnson. “It’s motion-sensing and even predicts the patient’s movements. This results in fewer repeat scans, which improves the patient experience and enables more people to receive scans.”\n\nWellstar MCG Health also has a mobile MRI machine that is located outside of Professional Building One.\n\n“This will be so much better for our patients, being closer to other support services for pediatric patients and wayfinding for all patients. All patients who receive a MRI will now got to the same waiting room, instead of three different waiting rooms,” Johnson said.\n\nThe new machine has a stronger gradient within the magnetic field, Johnson explained, which translates to higher-resolution, thin-section imaging. This means, for example, that radiologists and other physicians will be able to more clearly see the margins of a prostate cancer or the valves of the heart.\n\n“You can see fine detail so much better, so you can make more confident diagnostic and treatment decisions,” she said. “You can get literally a half a millimeter slice thickness with this new equipment. That’s huge for us as we help patients and physicians make the best possible decisions for a person’s care.”\n\nThe new technology also improves the ability to adapt to individual patient body shape and to better scan patients who have implanted devices such as pacemakers.\n\nRadiology Manager Felicia Ford said she is very happy to begin working with the new machines. She even volunteered to be among the first people to be scanned, just to test it.\n\nFord is looking forward to providing her patients with a better experience in addition to better quality MRI scans.\n\n“It’s really nice,” she said. “I was impressed. It’s comfortable.”\n\nAtlanta, GA -- CLEAR (NYSE: YOU), the secure identity company, and Wellstar Health System, one of the largest healthcare systems in Georgia, are launching a new initiative to further simplify and speed up the patient check-in process. The first pilot location is live with further rollout expected in the second half of 2024.\n\nCLEAR has successfully integrated with Wellstar to enable patient registration and on-site check-in through CLEAR Verified. Wellstar co-developed the integration and is the first health system to utilize the CLEAR Verified technology application, which will become an out-of-the-box integration that CLEAR can easily implement for other healthcare partners who use Epic.\n\nWellstar patients who opt-in to use CLEAR’s proven technology will enjoy a smooth on-site check-in by simply verifying their identity ahead of time. Wellstar patients will receive a text a few days before their scheduled appointment to check-in using CLEAR.

The two have been serving their community in Cobb County for decades leading Michael to become the first Mayor of Mableton in 2023.\n\nClaudette found her calling in nursing and served at Wellstar Cobb Medical Center from October 1998 to April 2012 when she retired. As we celebrate National Nurses week, she expressed that “once you are a nurse, you are always a nurse.”\n\nDuring her time at Wellstar, she was a staff nurse and a charge nurse. “I think all nurses probably feel the same way. When our patients come in with chest pain, shortness of breath and chest pains so unstable, it is such a good feeling to care for them and bring them back to good health. That was my reward from Wellstar Cobb Hospital when I served on 2 North.”\n\nAt that time, her son Michael was pursuing his dreams and attending college. “If he set his mind to do something, he was going to find a way to do it,” Claudette said. “I think determination was his guiding force.”\n\nOn the eve of Mother’s Day weekend, Claudette fondly remembers her son when he was young. “He would bring me little pictures and we would go over them. He played basketball with his friends and brothers and was even into modeling and acting. He always kept me busy too because I was always running him here and there, but it was really fun for me.”\n\nMichael started his life of service as a teenager by joining the United States Marine Corps before going on to college. “He’s always been moving towards something,” she said.\n\n“I joined the Marines at 17. My father was in the Marines and my grandfather was in the Navy. Leadership is an extension of serving my country – I am now serving locally,” Michael said.\n\nAfter enlisting with the Marines, Michael graduated from high school and went to Paris Island for basic training. He served for eight years and then attended North Carolina A&T State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Harvard University and the U.S. Army War College. He launched a career in cybersecurity and dedicated time to public service. When Cobb County residents voted to create the City of Mableton in 2022, Michael set his sights on his next chapter of community service.\n\nMichael’s drive and inspiration is evident in his mother. “Before she was a nurse, she opened her own beauty salon in a small town in North Carolina,” he said.\n\nMichael’s fondest memory of his mom is when she became a registered nurse. “She inspired me, and she still inspires me. She has always had an appetite for the world and working hard. She was relentless in wanting the best for us as a wife, mother and daughter. She was constantly trying to be everywhere at the same time.”\n\nAs Claudette reflected on her time as a nurse, she recalls, “I was welcomed from the very beginning. I always felt welcome there [at Wellstar] and I still feel that way today.”\n\nMichael shared that some of his mother’s best friends served alongside her.\n\n“I used my vacation time back then to make sure to get our family together,” she remembers describing the summers when she would get her entire family, including five children, their spouses and grandchildren together.\n\nThe camaraderie she experienced on the floor with her fellow nurses is memorable. “And we all knew one another’s children even though we didn’t see them, but we knew when there was a graduation or birthday.”\n\nNow that she is retired, Claudette is still active in the Mableton community, attending events and enjoying many of the activities the city has to offer, and spending time in her garden and with her family.\n\nFor Michael, his service is about “improving the quality of life for everyone.” With strong role models growing up and in adulthood, he is committed to his community. After spending the first year of his term “putting the blocks together” for the newly established city, he’s excited about Mableton 2045, a comprehensive citywide plan that’s being developed.\n\n“The goal is to come up with a flexible and comprehensive plan to determine how the city is going to change and build,” he explained.\n\nMableton is now the largest city in Cobb County and home to 80,000 people.\n\nThe mayor and his mother will have much to celebrate this Mother’s Day, including their legacy of serving their growing community.\n\nWith Valentine's Day approaching, there seems to be more than love in the air; there is loneliness, too. So, how does love affect our health?\n\nHumans desire connections; we are wired to love and be loved. Feelings of closeness help individuals navigate challenges in both their physical and mental well-being. Being close to others is crucial for mental health, and loneliness can often play a role in worsening psychiatric conditions and major depressive disorders.\n\nIn this season of love, Wellstar is dedicated to providing support and care, helping individuals navigate the emotional challenges that may arise, and fostering a community connected by compassion and well-being.\n\nFor advice on this timely topic, we asked Dr. Justin Ayankola, medical director of Wellstar Collaborative Care Psychiatry, to help us understand how the heart affects the mind.\n\n\"Giving ourselves permission to love and be loved is critical to our well-being because love is the glue that ties communities together.”\n\nFor some, this season can trigger depressive feelings, so we wondered how we could go about preparing ourselves for the emotions we might feel during the upcoming holiday.\n\n\"The best way to prepare for a difficult time is to optimize your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. Emotionally, being surrounded by people you love and care about is important. It is not the time to explore or salvage relationships.\n\nPractices such as meditation and gratitude journaling can help increase resilience and decrease feelings of loneliness.\"\n\nDid you know that research indicates both pleasant conversations and physical touch trigger the release of oxytocin? Just 30 minutes of in-person interactions, including a hug, can help release this hormone in our brains.\n\nThere is a common misconception that being in a relationship brings an individual \"wholeness.\" Still, a critical part of finding love is loving oneself first, so how does nurturing that relationship help our mental health?\n\n\"Prioritizing self-care is equally important in tending to our mental health. Surprisingly, the most significant barrier to forming relationships often lies not in our feelings toward others but our feelings about ourselves.\n\nLove is about connections. These healthy connections take effort to form and trust to keep. We should be aware that even when we focus on self-love, it is an action that is still dependent on relationships with others. It isn't easy to love ourselves while not giving love to others. The work of self-love and giving love must happen simultaneously.\"\n\nThere has often been a connection between Valentine's Day and loneliness or reminders of toxic situations affecting our mental health.\n\n\"Toxic relationships are connections that are destructive. There are numerous ways in which these types of relationships manifest; however, the result is often isolation and stress. Stress has both biological and psychological effects.\n\nBiologically, there is an increase in cortisol, which, if elevated chronically, can make individuals more susceptible to depression and anxiety. The isolation that often accompanies toxic relationships only exacerbates these issues.\"\n\nFor many, the pressures of dating and finding \"the one\" can cause anxiety. Some find online dating a way to seek companionship, but swiping right and left can overwhelm the heart and mind. How do the brain and heart handle the ways of modern love?\n\n\"Online dating apps can be invaluable tools for connecting with others. In fact, many people who meet people on dating apps say it led to an exclusive, romantic relationship. However, they should be used responsibly, considering one's vulnerabilities and insecurities.\n\nOne size does not fit all. I recommend using apps that do not cater to a person's more problematic habits. Dating apps can facilitate connections for individuals but should not be the sole means for bringing love into their lives.\"\n\nIf you are wondering where to turn if you need help, scheduling an appointment with your primary care provider can be a great way to connect with a behavioral health clinician.\n\nA cancer surgeon at Wellstar Health System since 2005, Dr. Sahir Shroff never thought his journey to medicine would lead him to find a passion for art. Referring to it as a \"serendipitous encounter with painting,\" Dr. Shroff’s career led him to be a world-class cancer surgeon who sees sick patients as the Surgical Oncology Subsection lead and the Kennestone Cancer Steering Committee Chair. Throughout the years, he realized he needed an outlet to help compartmentalize his life and destress. That is where his newfound passion came into play.\n\nOfficially, his journey into art began about a year ago; painting became a means of meditation for Dr. Shroff. As time passed, he realized this hobby offered him something more valuable than he had ever dreamed of- peace and tranquility. \"More than what I'm doing - it is what I need to do. It allows me to focus on things other than medicine.\" The instant he picked up the brush and started painting, he felt a weight lifted from his shoulders.\n\n\"I do not consider myself an artist. I am an amateur. I am self-taught; I experiment with different paint mediums and brushes to create the desired effect.\" Dr. Shroff continued, \"Art has never been a big part of my life in the past. Being a physician, I have naturally gravitated towards the STEM topics.\"\n\nDr. Shroff was born in Mumbai, India, and completed his residency and fellowship in the United States. He met his now wife, Dr. Paulomi Shroff, a breast surgeon with Wellstar Health System in medical school, and they share a beautiful family. After becoming empty nesters in the past few years, Dr. Shroff realized converting one of his children's bedrooms into an art studio was the perfect culmination of his life's works and his newfound passion for art. Not only is it helping him, but Dr. Shroff has also found that art is a beautiful tool to connect to his patients. His canvasses line the walls at Kennestone Regional Medical Center's Cancer Center, where patients can find a time for respite from the chemotherapy and radiation treatments that so often fill their lives with the angst of the \"C Word.\"\n\nFrom his art titled \"Home Coming\" featuring the wildebeests and huts he has found along his travels to villages in Tanzania to the hyenas and big moon in his art 'Blue Moon in the Serengeti' and a cheetah and her cub in 'Now You See Them, Now You Don't.' These moments have inspired Dr. Shroff in so many ways. With this reflective approach to better understanding life's purpose, the love of art has been life-changing for Dr. Shroff, \"our role as humans on this earth and our responsibility to safeguard this delicate ecosystem.\"\n\nAccording to a Modern Healthcare analysis of data from 255 health systems, Wellstar Health System provides the second-highest percentage of charity care among large nonprofit U.S. health systems. The rankings are based on a review of charity care reported as a portion of operating expenses for fiscal year 2022[1].\n\nWellstar devoted 6.11% of its operating expenses to charity care, making the system the top provider of charity care in the state and the second nationwide. As a nonprofit healthcare system, Wellstar is committed to bringing expert, compassionate health services to those who need them.\n\n“Wellstar is committed to providing compassionate, expert care to the communities we serve,” Julie Teer, SVP and President of Wellstar Foundation, said. “As a nonprofit health system, we rely on the generosity of donors and strategic partnerships to help us expand access and impact. The Wellstar Foundation is the philanthropic arm of the health system and is fueling innovation and action to address the state’s most pressing health needs.”\n\nOur nine safety net hospitals[2] care for every patient that comes through our doors, regardless of their ability to pay. Wellstar intentionally focuses on philanthropy and partnerships that support health equity, behavioral health, innovation, workforce development and clinical excellence initiatives. Each is critical to the health system’s efforts to provide holistic, tailored care that meets people’s health needs at every age and stage.\n\nAs we lead the way to a healthier Georgia, Wellstar is the only health system in the state with an established Center for Health Equity. The Wellstar Center for Health Equity (WCHE) is critical to reaching underserved communities. Every three years, a Community Health Needs Assessment is conducted to help better understand the unique health needs of the communities we serve – further enabling us to create and implement a plan to improve care and promote healthy lifestyles for every person regardless of their race, gender, culture or income.\n\n“We are able to reach a broader range of people in need because of the partnerships we’ve formed,” Elise Lockamy-Kassim, AVP of the WCHE, said. “As a community, we are stronger together. Working with organizations like Goodr; Wholesome Wave Georgia; Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies; Ser Familia, and hundreds of other partners, we’re able to make a much greater impact.”\n\nFood insecurity is one of Wellstar’s six strategic initiatives because of the WCHE’s findings. Wellstar and the Wellstar Foundation first partnered with Goodr in 2020 to tackle food insecurity during the pandemic. Our partnership initially focused on Mobile Markets, pop-up grocery markets that provide food and fresh produce to thousands of families each year.\n\nThe partnership has evolved to also include a Surplus Food Recovery service where leftover food from hospitals and donated to community-based organizations. Most recently, the system launched an Organic Recycling Program with support from Goodr, the Wellstar Foundation, Catalyst by Wellstar and Wellstar Strategic Community Development.\n\nAt Wellstar, our strong commitment to clinical and community initiatives, designed to help enhance care and create a healthier Georgia, has recently grown with the addition of Wellstar MCG Health and Children’s Hospital of Georgia.\n\nPlease consider supporting Wellstar’s nonprofit work by making a tax-deductible donation through the Wellstar Foundation at wellstar.org/give.\n\n[1] Source: Merritt Research Services, an Investortools Company\n\n[2] Source: Georgia Department of Community Health, Safety Net Hospitals (2019 Data Year)\n\nWith nearly one in five Georgians struggling with mental health challenges annually, treating mental health conditions and assessing suicide risk is a group effort between health professionals and state, local, and community partners. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), recognized Wellstar as the only system in Georgia and one of 25 nationwide to be awarded funding as part of a $2M Grant from the Biden-Harris Administration. The grant falls in the Cooperative Agreements to Implement Zero Suicide in Health Systems in the form of an intervention and prevention model for adults throughout our health system.\n\nWellstar launched a system-wide suicide prevention program in 2017 when the Behavioral Health Service Line adopted the national best-practice Zero Suicide Initiative (ZSI) framework developed by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC) and the National Alliance for Suicide Prevention. During the earliest phases of implementation, Wellstar invited national experts from the SPRC to advise on best practices, hosted a series of focus groups with various Wellstar medical specialties and departments, conducted an organizational needs assessment, and convened a Zero Suicide Oversight Steering Council to oversee the development, implementation, and fidelity of the program.\n\n\"Behavioral health cannot own the problem alone independent of other members of the healthcare team. We have to consider a systemic approach – how we screen, assess, deliver care and address gaps throughout the entire healthcare continuum,\" explained Ryan Breshears, PhD, ABPP, chief of Wellstar's Behavioral Health service line and a board-certified clinical health psychologist.\n\nSince the initial 2017 launch, Wellstar's Suicide Prevention Team has implemented an improved suicide screening process for all Wellstar emergency departments and medical floors. These experts have also routinized collaborative safety planning to ensure safety interventions are initiated at the onset of the patient encounter and throughout the duration of care.\n\n“The support of our executive leadership to launch this program in 2017, ongoing system collaboration, and commitment from our suicide prevention team has helped to save lives. The infusion of the SAMHSA grant funding received, in partnership with our Wellstar Foundation, will further enhance our reach and impact to the individuals in this vulnerable population,” says Trisha Velasco, assistant vice president of the Behavioral Health service line.\n\nWellstar's receipt of the SAMHSA grant builds on the system's established infrastructure through the provision of additional educational resources to healthcare clinicians and the community. It also increases access to evidence-based treatments shown to reduce suicidal thoughts. Specifically, funding will enable follow-up care for high-risk adults who are struggling with suicidal thoughts and/or have experienced a recent suicide attempt. Through this grant, SAMHSA aims to aid the program in continuing to reduce suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and deaths due to suicide.\n\nThis grant's objectives align with Wellstar's goals of reducing suicide attempts and suicide death rates among Georgians ages 18 and older by growing the existing Wellstar Zero Suicide Initiative. Adding community-based and treatment-focused strategies, including suicide prevention training throughout the organization coupled with identification, treatment, and care transition, Wellstar will continue strengthening the community. At least 5,000 patients across six Wellstar hospitals and emergency departments will receive care, including to residents in Bartow, Cherokee, Cobb, Douglas, Forsyth, Fulton, Harris, Paulding, Polk, and Troup counties.\n\nSuicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, affecting people of all ages. While mental health plays a role, there are many other factors that may lead someone to contemplate suicide, and there are some warning signs to pay close attention to because they may indicate that someone is at risk of suicide, which include:\n\nTalking about wanting to die or kill themselves, or making comments like, \"I wish I weren't here,\" or \"Nothing matters.\"\n\nTalking about feelings of hopelessness, being a burden to others, feeling trapped, or being in unbearable pain.\n\nExhibiting impulsive or reckless behaviors, acting more irritated or anxious than normal, and extreme mood swings.\n\nA change in habits related to appearance, eating, drinking, or sleeping.\n\nIncreasing the use of alcohol or drugs.\n\nWithdrawing or isolating themselves.\n\nSigns of self-harm like cuts or scratches.\n\nThe research is clear that enhancing feelings of belonging and connection is a powerful method of reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. While suicide can be a difficult topic to talk about, speaking about it non-judgmentally can offer hope. In contrast, avoiding the discussion can contribute to feelings of isolation, further contributing to devastating outcomes.\n\nIf you suspect a loved one is at risk for suicide, talk with them. Here are some tips to help guide your conversation:\n\nBe available.\n\nBe non-judgmental and maintain curiosity.\n\nTalk less.\n\nListen more.\n\nAllow your loved one to express their feelings.\n\nValidate that their feelings make sense.\n\nAsk how you can be helpful. \"\n\nOffer hope that treatment alternatives are available without offering insincere reassurance.\n\nFollow-up after the initial conversation.\n\nShow interest and support.\n\nThe holidays can be challenging, especially for those struggling with mental health. Familial factors, unrealistic expectations, past trauma, and grief/loss can all play a role in why sometimes the holidays can be more stressful than joyful.\n\nPhysical and behavioral health outcomes are intertwined and provide a holistic view of our health. Physicians refer to assessing depression as “a vital sign” -- like checking blood pressure and heart rate. Considering the assessment of depression is essential for a person’s overall health status.\n\nWith nearly one in five Georgians struggling with mental illness yearly, treating mental health conditions and assessing suicide risk is a group effort between health professionals and state, local, and community partners. Wellstar’s director of adult & pediatric primary care behavioral health integration, Dr. Janna Williams-Pitts, helps us to understand why the holidays can be so stressful.\n\n“When the stress response becomes activated due to something we are excited or concerned about, it can have a physiological and psychological impact. This occurs for those with and without a diagnosed mental health condition. The stress response, and more specifically chronic stress, can play a role in the onset of a depressive episode or the recurrence of heightened anxiety symptoms.”\n\nWomen are about twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. In speaking with Dr. Williams-Pitts, we wanted to understand how specific risk factors like age and gender can make facing these holiday stressors more challenging.\n\n“Research suggests that there are gender differences in the stress response due to biological factors, specifically hormonal differences. Women appear to be more likely to experience depression due to chronic stress, whereas men may be more likely to develop substance use disorders due to chronic stress. The APA completed a survey to assess for Stress in America in 2022. The results of this survey indicate that inflation, concerns about violence, and the racial climate in America are a few of the factors that contribute to differing experiences with stress for participants. Age differences emerged as well. Forty-six percent of adults under 35 reported feeling so stressed that it impacted their functioning whereas 42% of adults aged 35-44, 16% 45-64, and 4% of adults 65+ reported the same.”\n\nPeople respond to stress in a variety of ways. Often, individuals can hide their symptoms from those closest to them. But we learned there are signs to look for in loved ones who might be experiencing stress blues during the holidays. Social withdrawal, increased substance use, change in hygiene/self-care, shifts in sleep, and experiencing feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and poor concentration can all be signs that chronic stress is starting to have an impact.\n\nIt's common for people to notice increased fatigue and feeling down due to less exposure to sunlight during the winter months. So, it’s only natural to wonder if environmental changes during winter months play a role in the onset of depression.\n\n“Some people experience debilitating depressive episodes during the fall and winter months with significant improvement in the spring and summer months. When depressive episodes occur in a seasonal pattern, this is consistent with the diagnosis of Seasonal Affective Disorder.”\n\nDr. Williams-Pitts added that it is “important to identify a range of meaningful, enjoyable activities to engage in during the winter months to help reduce the likelihood of worsening depressive symptoms.”\n\nRescheduling appointments with your behavioral health clinician before the holidays can be tempting. Still, keeping that appointment is helpful for those who experience stress during this season. It serves as an opportunity to review your stress management plan and identify meaningful coping mechanisms, which may help the holiday season go more smoothly.\n\nIf you are wondering where to turn if you need help during the holidays but don’t have a behavioral health clinician, scheduling an appointment with your primary care provider can be a great way to connect with a behavioral health clinician.\n\nAtlanta Medical Center (AMC) has proudly served the community with compassionate healthcare for more than 100 years. It’s a legacy of service and success spanning its years as Tabernacle Baptist Infirmary, Georgia Baptist Hospital and AMC, and at Wellstar, we are honored to have been part of this story.\n\nWe understand and share the community’s disappointment that the hospital has closed as of November 1. While the decision may have felt abrupt, it came after an exhaustive search where a national consulting firm identified a number of potential partners. However, after learning more about AMC’s infrastructure and finances, none were willing to move forward. Discussions with state, local and community officials also offered no alternate paths forward.\n\nThroughout the transition, we have remained focused on supporting our AMC patients and team members. Because our top priority is ensuring patient safety, we worked to thoughtfully wind down services in advance of the closure, including safely transferring the few remaining patients to other appropriate Wellstar hospitals and connecting with partners to ensure people receive the care they need.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to the hundreds of AMC team members and clinicians who have worked hard to ensure a successful transition and for their many years of service at AMC. We are honored that nearly 75% of our more than 1,780 offers to AMC team members for new positions have been accepted, and we are grateful they will continue in their shared pursuit of Wellstar’s mission and vision. Now that the hospital has been safely closed, Wellstar will continue to secure and maintain the facility and begin a thoughtful process to determine what is next for the site.\n\nThe challenges we faced at AMC were multi-faceted and included the age of AMC’s buildings, patients using less than half of the bed capacity, lack of public support while caring for communities most in need of whole-person wellness offerings such as primary and preventive care. Compounding these issues were the intense financial pressures facing hospital systems across the country. Like many of our peers, we felt the pain of the end of government pandemic aid and the skyrocketing costs of supplies and labor. The needed investment to address these challenges was simply too great for Wellstar alone.\n\nAs we look ahead, Wellstar will continue to build lasting partnerships that will provide people with increased access to the care they need. As the largest provider of uncompensated care in Georgia, we are proud to serve 1 in 6 Georgians in diverse communities across the region. We will continue to be there for those who need us for primary and specialized care and through our critical role in the statewide collaborative trauma network.\n\nThrough our recently announced partnership with Southside Medical Center, Wellstar will invest $5 million in Southside’s East Point clinic to expand their size and capacity and provide greater access to much-needed primary and preventive care, among other services. This is the latest example of our long-standing commitment to partner with others to provide ongoing care to the AMC community.\n\nOur vision for the future requires collaboration with mission-aligned partners and with our friends and neighbors in our communities. That includes partners within and beyond the healthcare industry who can bring unique ideas and perspectives to support the health of the whole person, address the social determinants of health and expand access to world-class care when, where and how people need it. Together, we can transform healthcare to support the people we serve throughout their health and wellness journeys — not just when they are sick or injured. We can build the bold future of care Georgians need and deserve.\n\nCandice L. Saunders, FACHE, is the president and CEO of Wellstar Health System, one of the largest and most integrated health systems in Georgia. A former critical care nurse, she leads nearly 25,000 team members and physicians overseeing the health and well-being of communities throughout the state.\n\nO. Scott Swayze, MD, is the chair of the Board of Trustees for Wellstar Health System. He is an accomplished orthopaedic surgeon, practicing at Pinnacle Orthopaedics and belonging to local, state and national orthopaedic associations.\n\nWellstar Health System and Southside Medical Center are announcing a new partnership to improve primary and preventive care throughout Atlanta communities. Together, the organizations will focus on expanding access to preventive, whole-person care and chronic disease support, rather than treating patients episodically when they are acutely sick or injured without guaranteed follow up.\n\nAs the first step in this collaboration, Wellstar will invest nearly $5 million toward expanding primary care services for thousands of East Point residents at Southside Medical Center’s East Point clinic located at 1100 Cleveland Ave. Through Wellstar’s investment, the Southside Medical Center clinic in East Point will expand its size, capacity and hours.\n\n“This important partnership will create a much-needed medical home that will meet the primary and preventive care needs of the South Fulton County community,” said David M. Williams, MD, President and CEO of Southside Medical Center. “Wellstar and Southside share a vision to promote a culture of health and well-being. Building upon the initial expansion in East Point, our plan is to promote change in health status, lifestyles and health outcomes in the patients we serve through a new model of care throughout Metro Atlanta.”\n\nThe Southside Medical Center clinic is adjacent to Wellstar’s East Point Health Center (EPHC), which offers urgent care, care coordination and behavioral health services. Through this partnership, care coordinators at EPHC will support urgent care patients in developing a relationship with primary care clinicians at Southside Medical Center to support their long-term health and well-being.\n\n“At Wellstar, we know from our experience, and we have heard from our patients and consumers that our communities have a critical need for preventive primary care health services, especially those focused on chronic illnesses,” said Candice L. Saunders, President and CEO of Wellstar Health System. “We are proud to partner with Southside Medical Center to grow access to the kind of care that matches the needs of the community and promotes the long-term health and well-being of the people we serve. This partnership represents Wellstar’s broader vision for the future of healthcare, which is focused on transformative care models that support overall community health and wellness through personalized preventive care.”\n\nIn April 2022, Wellstar transitioned the Atlanta Medical Center South hospital campus to an urgent care clinic to better match the care needs of the community. The partnership with Southside Medical Center represents the next step on this journey to create a sustainable care solution that will best serve the South Fulton County community long-term.\n\nBy expanding and enhancing the care offered through Southside Medical Center, patients will have access to family medicine, general dentistry, behavioral health services and substance abuse disorders management. Patients will also have access to Southside’s Behavioral Lifestyle Enrichment Center, which provides mental health and addiction treatment through their comprehensive Lifestyle Enrichment Treatment program to address addiction, depression, anxiety and other disorders.\n\nSouthside Medical Center is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that has provided care to East Point and Atlanta communities for over 55 years. As an FQHC, Southside Medical Center provides primary care access to all patients of the communities it serves, especially underserved communities. Southside Medical Center has strong ties to the community, and expanding their clinic is the right next step toward a sustainable care solution for a population that needs access to primary care, preventive and mental health services. As an FQHC, Southside Medical Center intends to provide greater access to primary and preventive health care services in addition to addressing the chronic care needs of the community through the patient-centered medical home model, which is designed to address both the clinical and social determinants of health issues which impact the healthcare and well-being of our community.\n\nAn important member of the East Point and Atlanta communities, Southside Medical Center has been nationally recognized by the National Association of Community Health Centers for having one of the best primary care delivery systems for the medically underserved.\n\n“I look forward to the incredible impact this clinic will have on the lives of the patients and families we serve,” Dr. Williams said. “The expansion in East Point is just the beginning of an impactful partnership with Wellstar that I’m confident will meaningfully improve the health of our friends and neighbors throughout our region.”\n\nAs these groups move forward with this exciting partnership, Wellstar and Southside Medical Center will continue to work in collaboration with East Point Mayor Deana Ingraham, and we look forward to sharing more about this exciting next step.\n\nAs Wellstar Kennestone Regional Medical Center celebrates our 72nd birthday, we are grateful for the opportunity to serve our growing community. We also are very grateful for the ongoing partnership and support our community affords us as we continue to evolve and grow to meet the changing healthcare needs of patients and families. This year has been a true testament of excellence in the quality of care we provide at Kennestone. Even through the challenges that the past several years imposed upon us, we have led by taking care of each other, our patients and our communities.\n\nWe are honored to continue to be recognized alongside Wellstar and its network of award-winning hospitals as we worked hard, together, to exceed the national standards of care. Among the awards and distinctions bestowed to Kennestone were the National Accreditation Program for Rectal Cancer, a first for Wellstar; Stroke Gold Plus award from the American Heart and American Stroke Associations; the very coveted Georgia Oglethorpe award; and several disease specific re-designations through The Joint Commission.\n\nOur Vision: To deliver world-class healthcare to every person, every time.\n\nThis year also brought a meaningful opportunity to continue to support our commitment to growth by preparing for the enabling work of a new, state-of-the-art bed tower. This new tower replaces the Baird building on campus and allows us to expand our patient care capabilities. The new tower is expected to be complete by late 2025 and open in 2026. In the meantime, we are engaging with our front line team members, providers, patients and a neighborhood advisory council and listening to their specific needs and desires as we consider this building’s amenities. Among such sought-after features will be private patient rooms.\n\nAdditionally, the tower will offer:\n\nExpanded and state-of-the-art Neonatal ICU\n\nExpanded, all-private cardiovascular and neuro care services\n\nRooms designed specifically for patient, family and healthcare provider comfort and functionality\n\nNew kitchen, cafeteria and in-room dining services\n\nAnd much more\n\nAll of this will be enabled by technology to ensure the expertise housed within the tower is accessible to everyone. Sustainability is also a key factor as we finalize the tower’s design and materials.\n\nInnovation\n\nTechnology continues to be a priority area for innovation in the healthcare industry and at Kennestone Medical Center. For example, in 2021, we opened a new Hybrid CVOR which enables us to offer advanced cardiovascular operations and procedures with the most up-to-date technology available. Additionally, we have a Neuro Robot in the Vascular Institute and a a Cardiac Robot in the Cath Lab. These robots offer more precise tools for delicate procedures and assist surgeons with life-saving techniques, while also offering additional safety to physicians by reducing their exposure to radiation. This very exciting robotic technology also presents a tremendous opportunity for impact in the future. Robotics will enable our world-class physicians to leverage their expertise and expand our care to rural areas by assisting with operations remotely.\n\nAs we advance our mission through deploying a refreshed strategic plan, we look forward to innovating new care models to serve our patients, leveraging digital innovation and heavily investing in ambulatory spaces in order to increase our primary care footprint for easy access to care.\n\nOur Mission: To enhance the health and wellbeing of every person we serve.\n\nWe learned a tremendous amount about disease crises as we watched how this hospital and the entire U.S. healthcare system pivoted to the dedicated care of Covid. In spite of the profound toll the pandemic had on employees everywhere, we remarked at the resiliency of our workers and clinical excellence of our providers and caregivers. We cannot thank you enough for the overwhelming show of support you gave our teams during that time. You nourished their minds and hearts and helped them thrive through incredibly challenging times.\n\nKennestone’s birthday and our new fiscal year represents a renewed hope in our journey, together, as our country continues to heal, grow and move past the devastating effects of Covid. It is more important than ever to stand in support of one another and continue to invest in resources for our staff. As the health and wellness of our teams continues to be of utmost importance, we continue to work with our staff to implement new and expanded employee programs, including wellness rooms and relief perks as a way to renew and refresh. Health equity also remains a priority. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Team is dedicated to providing each team member with resources including book study groups, dialogue forums, videos and other tools which optimize technology resources for learning aimed at honoring every voice and ensuring equitable care to our patients and their families. This is a theme we carry through our community involvement, as well.\n\nWe remain excited to welcome new hires to Kennestone and Wellstar, especially new graduates who have chosen our medical center as their first clinical site. You are the reason we do what we do. We pledge to never stop striving to improve your health and wellness and remain committed to advancing care. Thank you for the trust you place in us to serve you and your loved ones. We are grateful to be your care provider of choice.\n\nWellstar Health System is shaping the future of leadership training and development through an initial training program with Moth+Flame, an award-winning virtual reality (VR) provider and technology studio.\n\nOn May 18-19, 2022, Catalyst by Wellstar, the health system's global digital health and innovation center, along with Wellstar Leadership Development and Moth+Flame hosted the health system's first-ever VR-based leadership development training, focused on emotional intelligence. Across the two days, more than 100 Wellstar leaders participated in an immersive, VR-powered learning experience to prepare them to lead their teams through ongoing change in the healthcare industry.\n\n\"Partnering with Moth+Flame is an opportunity for us to gain a deeper understanding of how virtual reality can impact the way we care for and engage with our patients, consumers and each other,\" said Hank Capps, M.D., FAAFP, Wellstar's executive vice president and chief information and digital officer. \"Our team members are essential in creating curated healthcare experiences, and we hope this initial training will showcase how VR technology can help our team be even more effective, compassionate and culturally competent leaders.\"\n\nStudies show virtual reality learners learn four times faster than traditional methods and are 275 percent more confident to act on their training. This initial training aims to validate these numbers with a select group of Wellstar's clinical and leadership teams to elevate the organization's leadership development programming. At the end of the two-day training, Wellstar measured an increase in levels of confidence in the material learned and 97 percent of participants reported they would recommend this training.\n\n\"We've seen that investment in high quality training can improve retention across all industries,\" said Kevin Cornish, Founder and CEO of Moth+Flame. \"By training in a simulated life-like environment, our product offers employees immersive training that helps them feel more confident. The metrics in Wellstar's launch show a continued trend that virtual reality is proving to be one of the most effective tools for professional development.\"\n\n\"Virtual reality and other technologies can open the door for us to take our leadership and team development to the next level,\" said Laura Dannels, Wellstar's chief talent officer. \"These outcomes show us what's possible when we think outside of the box and embrace solutions from across industries. Our goal is to support our leaders as they guide their teams in creating exceptional consumer and team member experiences.\"\n\nUnlike most typical VR experiences, Moth+Flame leverages real people instead of virtual avatars, which helps provide a more profound, meaningful experience for the end users. During the session, Wellstar leaders used headsets and iPads to immerse themselves in scenarios designed to prepare them to guide their teams through moments of change. This video describes more about the training.\n\n\"This 30-minute VR training on emotional intelligence was more effective and comprehensible than two full days of in-person training,\" said Michael Collins, Wellstar team member and participant.\n\nCatalyst by Wellstar and Moth+Flame were connected through Engage, a first-of-its-kind collaborative innovation and corporate venture platform. Engage brings together industry-leading corporations, enterprise startups and universities with the shared mission of elevating Atlanta and the Southeast as a leading technology and innovation hub. Wellstar is proud to be the only healthcare organization to partner with Engage as the health system works to create new solutions to transform health and well-being.\n\nThe Wellstar Foundation has joined the Literacy and Justice for All initiative, a coalition of leading organizations such as the Joseph B. Whitehead Foundation, United Way, Atlanta Speech School Rollins Center and Marietta City Schools — all committed to ensuring youth have the literacy skills needed to succeed in life. The goal of the program is ensuring that every child can read by third grade and has a foundation for growth in literacy.\n\nGeorgia ranks 41 out of 50 states for literacy*. According to the COX Campus, literacy is strongly correlated to zip code, race and ethnicity. The disruption in education due to the COVID-19 pandemic has further heightened the need for childhood literacy programs to ensure no child is left behind.\n\n“We are honored to join this effort in creating a connected ecosystem with schools and early childhood educators to enhance literacy and create a national model that can be expanded to serve and support our country’s youth,” said Julie Teer, senior vice president of Wellstar and president of the Wellstar Foundation.\n\nThrough a grant from the Joseph B. Whitehead Foundation, Wellstar Kennestone Hospital and its affiliated OB/GYN and pediatrics offices will implement the Talk With Me Baby program and be part of a literacy ecosystem dedicated to healthy brain development for children.\n\nThe team at Kennestone will collaborate with families of babies born there to teach about the importance of building language from an early age. Families will be prepared with the resources needed to improve their child’s “language nutrition.”\n\nAccording to the Talk With Me Baby program, families can teach their child basic language skills by using loving words, eye contact and facial expressions, as well as repeating words and phrases. Families can partner with their child’s Wellstar care team to learn more about how to engage with their children, and Wellstar clinical and nursing teams will be trained as Talk With Me Baby coaches.\n\nThis support will continue at pediatric patient visits as Wellstar partners with families of children from birth through the age of five to promote literacy. Talking, reading, playing and singing together help even the youngest children establish these skills.\n\nThrough philanthropy and community partnerships, the Wellstar Foundation fuels innovation and action to address the vital needs of diverse communities in Georgia. Philanthropic contributions are transforming healthcare and improving access for all within four focus areas: health equity, behavioral health, innovation and workforce. The Foundation’s participation in the Literacy and Justice for All initiative combines innovative techniques for early childhood development with health equity endeavors to ensure all parents are equipped with the knowledge to raise thriving children and improve their quality of life.\n\nTeer says, “As a not-for-profit health system, our passion for people extends beyond the walls of our care sites and into the diverse communities we serve. Through collaboration with our partners, we are creating pathways for success to improve the health and well-being of all Georgians with the aim of creating a healthier state for everyone now and in the future.”\n\nTo learn more or make a tax-deductible donation, visit wellstar.org/give.

Georgia’s rural hospitals provide critical care to residents when and where they need it. However, industry shifts and economic challenges have forced many rural hospitals to close their doors, forcing millions of people to commute — some for hours — to receive the care they need.\n\nRecognizing this strain on rural hospitals and the communities they serve, the Georgia legislature launched the Georgia Rural Hospital Tax Credit program. Through this program, Georgia taxpayers receive a 100% state income tax credit on contributions made to qualifying rural hospitals such as Wellstar Sylvan Grove Hospital.\n\nDollars making a difference\n\nAs in past years, contribution limits will be removed on July 1, 2022. Given recent enhancements and increased interest, the program is anticipated to reach its $60 million cap soon after the contribution limits are removed, making now a pivotal time for Sylvan Grove donors to pre-register for unlimited contributions. By registering your contribution early, you help ensure facilities like Wellstar Sylvan Grove Hospital receive the assistance they need.\n\nStarting May 16, 2022 at 9 a.m., our administrative partner — Georgia HEART— will accept pre-registrations to be loaded on a first-come-first-serve basis once the limits are removed. The Wellstar Foundation is offering to assist Wellstar Sylvan Grove Hospital contributors with this pre-registration process. Contact the Foundation at [email protected] for assistance or click here to pre-register directly with Georgia HEART on May 16, 2022.\n\nSince 2016, Wellstar Sylvan Grove Hospital has received a total of $10 million through this program. As facilitated through the Wellstar Foundation, every dollar has accelerated critical upgrades, including a full renovation of the hospital’s emergency department, radiology department expansion and leading-edge innovation, such as advanced CT scanning technology, that enhances physicians’ abilities to make better-informed medical decisions.\n\nProviding PeopleCare\n\nAdvancements in treatments and technology benefit the residents of Butts County — patients like Mary “Lee” Nelson, a retired Butts County teacher who turned to Wellstar Sylvan Grove Hospital’s outpatient rehabilitation center for post-surgical physical therapy. The outpatient center was recently renovated with state-of-the-art equipment made possible through tax credit program contributions.\n\nThe former elementary grade teacher spends her retirement days traveling with her husband Bill, tending to her flower gardens and caring for her chickens. With such an active lifestyle, when Lee learned that she needed a knee replacement in 2021, she knew her local hospital would be able to provide the high-quality, compassionate care needed to get her back on her feet safely and quickly. Now, a few months after completing her physical therapy, Lee shares that she “feels normal again” and able to enjoy all the things that once brought her life so much joy.\n\nHow you can help\n\nThrough corporate and community partnership, the Wellstar Foundation is fueling innovation and action to address the vital needs of diverse communities in Georgia, including urban, suburban and rural communities. Wellstar is committed to delivering world-class healthcare to everyone close to home. Philanthropic support of the Wellstar Foundation is advancing innovation and expanding resources to create a healthier Georgia for all.

This broad intersection of perspectives and personalities has proven to be fertile ground for big ideas to take root and thrive.\n\nIt is within this context that Wellstar Health System participated in the Health & Med Tech track to share how using immersive sound technology in a series of wellness rooms is helping frontline healthcare workers reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. This initiative is the result of a partnership between award-winning immersive audio company and software service Spatial, and Catalyst by Wellstar, Wellstar’s global digital health and innovation center.\n\nDuring the panel, \"Redefining Healing Experiences with Sound,\" Dr. Hank Capps, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at Wellstar, shared how impactful the wellness rooms have been to frontline healthcare team members.\n\n\"The idea of bringing immersive sound into the wellness rooms and inviting team members who were in the midst of stress, in the midst of a battle, was one of the ways we believed we could make a difference. We went live with the wellness rooms earlier this year to unexpected success and utilization, beyond what we could have pictured,\" said Dr. Capps.\n\nTo help make this impact, the team was challenged to find ways to foster a calming environment without the use of screens, such as TVs. During a 12-hour shift of the near-constant monitoring of vital signs and patient records on computers and mobile devices, screens were something the team was looking to subtract, not add. This insight led to the innovative use of immersive sound technology invisibly imbedded within the walls of the wellness rooms. Team members can choose from a variety of soundscapes and transport themselves virtually to a calm beach, a rainforest with birds gently chirping, or to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThe evidence-based use of sound/music to reduce stress and anxiety is well-documented but patients and consumers are largely unaware of it. In fact, a recent nationwide survey revealed that while only 28% of respondents were aware that sound/music is being used in targeted ways to improve physical and mental well-being, 73% were open to incorporating it as a therapy.\n\nIncreasing awareness could help this technology achieve wider adoption. With this pilot project, Wellstar became the first health system to incorporate immersive audio technology with Spatial in a clinical setting.\n\nThe response from team members has exceeded expectations.\n\nThe four wellness rooms equipped with Spatial technology have been used thousands of times in just over one month of operation. Initial data and anecdotal evidence suggest this component of the wellness rooms is particularly useful in helping Wellstar team members reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. As more is learned from this pilot, the team hopes to expand the use of this technology in patient-facing settings such as labor and delivery rooms or emergency department waiting areas.\n\nCatalyst by Wellstar defines leading-edge, transformative solutions that enhance the health and well-being of people and communities with world-class results and impact. It is particularly meaningful that one of Catalyst’s first pilot projects is enhancing the well-being of people who have given so much of themselves in the service of their communities throughout the pandemic—Wellstar team members.\n\nFrontline team members now have a place to reflect, refuel and recharge at work, funded by the Wellstar Foundation, with innovative technology provided by Catalyst by Wellstar and strategic design implemented by our Employee Wellness group.\n\nTucked away at nearly every Wellstar facility is a haven for team members to unwind from a challenging shift or stressful day. These Wellness Rooms, which opened in 2022, were designed to transport team members beyond the walls of their facility.\n\nIn the Wellness Rooms, lights are dimmed, soundscapes play lightly in the background and the air is filled with fresh, calming scents. Team members flow in and out of the room at their leisure with a tap of their badge, grabbing a healthy snack, a spritz of an essential oil, or a moment of stillness while enjoying the massage chair.\n\nThe rooms vary by size at each location, but every room is equipped with tools to provide a serene and safe environment for team members who find themselves in search of calm amidst what can sometimes feel like chaos.\n\nSince opening, thousands of team members have benefited from the Wellness Room, utilizing the space as an outlet for stress management and as a resource for workplace self-care.\n\nBrianna Arrington, an emergency department technician at Wellstar West Georgia Medical Center, recently found herself needing a safe place to process the tragic loss of a pediatric patient. Brianna was led to a Wellness Room by her leader and encouraged to take a moment to breathe.\n\n“This quiet and relaxing space gave me the time to decompress from the anxiety I was feeling and helped me to calm down away from the situation. The Wellness Room was a tremendous help.” Brianna was able to return to her shift and continue serving patients the rest of the day.\n\nStudies show that physically moving away from a hectic environment, even for just a few minutes, helps to regulate our emotional wellness. Thanks to Catalyst by Wellstar and through a partnership with Spatial technologies, some Wellness Rooms are piloting immersive sound technology which is proven to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. Wellstar is the first health system to use such immersive AI-driven audio technology in a clinical setting. Spatial technology may even be utilized in patient-facing settings in the future, based on positive feedback from team members.\n\nThe Wellness Rooms were introduced as part of MyCare Rewards, an Employee Wellness benefit geared toward helping team members prioritize their mental, physical and emotional health. In total, the 16 Wellstar Wellness Rooms across our hospitals and health parks were a $1.5 million investment in the well-being of our team members. Thank you to the Wellstar Foundation for helping to make these rooms possible. The Wellness Rooms will continue to be a resource in times of need and moments of stress, providing a place of solitude to our team members who serve Wellstar patients and communities.\n\nDía de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a festive, multi-day cultural celebration among Mexican and Latinx communities where family and friends come together to pay respects to friends and family members who have died. The celebrations can sometimes take a serious or a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about the departed, marked by gatherings, music, colorful costumes, and food.\n\nThis year, Día de los Muertos celebrations are expected to take place during the global pandemic once again, which means the COVID-19 safety measures observed over the past 20 months should still be followed to protect your loved ones. This is particularly important since 26.2% of all COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have been among Hispanics and Latinos, representing 18.45% of the total deaths from the virus.\n\nTo keep everyone protected during this special celebration, Wellstar has compiled some tips for a fun and safe Día de los Muertos celebration.\n\n1 – Vaccination can make celebrations safer: Now that we have the protection of COVID-19 vaccines available, every celebration and gathering can be safer. The more people in your group who have been fully vaccinated, the better for everyone, especially if other safety measures are followed. If you are eligible, be sure and get a booster as soon as you can, too.\n\n2 – Make masks the star of Catrina costumes: Masks are not only fun, they’re also proven to minimize the spread of the virus for everyone age two and older. Get creative by incorporating masks in Catrina costumes and make-up by using fabric paint, glued-on sequins, or stickers to decorate them. In a pinch, use a printed Catrina mask and do your make-up to match or complement the mask. Don’t forget to share photos on social media with the hashtag #celebraciónsegura.\n\n3 – Celebrate outside with appropriate social distancing: Outside is the best place to celebrate. Weather and health permitting, being outside to celebrate Día de los Muertos can promote airflow and help minimize close contact with others. For parades and visits to gravesites, wear a mask and stay at least two meters apart from people who do not live with you. “Air” hugs and waves are much safer than physical hugging and kissing during the pandemic.\n\n4 – Avoid shared food and utensils: Because parties can be a big part of Día de los Muertos, not sharing food and utensils is one of the best ways to keep the spread of COVID-19 in check. If you do get together with a few close friends and family members, take measures to make it a safe celebration by bringing your own meal and utensils to limit sharing or use disposable items. As convenient as it may be, a buffet-style meal is not a good idea during a pandemic. Space your tables and chairs out, possibly outside or in a large area, to limit the spread of the disease, and wear a mask when you are not eating, especially those who are unvaccinated.\n\n5 – Wash hands and sanitize: During the celebration, keep disinfectant wipes nearby to use on surfaces such as tables, chairs, and doorknobs. Everyone should frequently wash and sanitize their hands and remind children and other family members about all safety measures to help keep everyone COVID-free.\n\n6 – Stay at home: Everyone loves a party, but it’s best to avoid any gathering, particularly if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart or lung issues, obesity, cancer, or other conditions that compromise your immune system. With the rise in pediatric COVID-19 cases, since many children are still not vaccinated, they may also be at greater risk of infection. Anyone can be a carrier or become infected and seriously ill, but these groups are at the greatest risk of contracting and succumbing to COVID. If anyone in your group is feeling ill or has symptoms, it's best to play it safe and stay home to celebrate.\n\nRegardless of how you choose to celebrate Día de los Muertos and the autumn season with fun activities during the pandemic, be sure and refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for specific guidance on how to stay safe and well.\n\nHalloween is right around the corner, and while many Georgians are looking to celebrate this year, many may have questions about how to do so safely.\n\nWe’re still in a global pandemic, but we are one year smarter about the best ways to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19, including the safe, effective vaccines that are now available. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released guidelines recommending vaccination to minimize COVID-19 risk and to keep family and friends safe while celebrating holiday occasions such as Halloween.\n\nMoreover, Halloween is a great occasion to show your creative flair and incorporate mask wearing. Adding decorative touches to face masks and even transforming a face shield into a superhero mask can be fun and adds a layer of protection from COVID and other viruses.\n\nGet SPOOKY\n\nWellstar has created these SPOOKY Halloween tips for a healthy Halloween celebration during the pandemic.\n\nS- SANITIZE often and thoroughly. Have your kids wash their hands before heading out, then bring along sanitizer and use it frequently while trick-or-treating. Sanitize candy wrappers when you get home and remind children of safety measures that can help keep everyone COVID-free. If children are visiting your home for trick-or-treating, keep hand sanitizer handy to help prevent the spread of viruses.\n\nP- PHYSICAL DISTANCING is still highly recommended by the CDC. Whether trick-or-treating at a front door or hanging around food and drinks at a party, large group gatherings should be avoided as much as possible. Six feet distancing when possible and small groups are still recommended, even when outside.\n\nO- OUTDOORS is the best way to celebrate Halloween, weather permitting. Being outside promotes air flow and helps minimize close contact with others. If guests are coming to your home for Halloween, consider sitting outside. If you’re planning to make “Grab-n-Go” treats instead of offering a big bowl of treats for kids to dig into, space the bags out for added safety. Reminder: being outdoors doesn’t mean you should ignore sensible safety COVID precautions.\n\nO- OBSERVE your youngest trick-or-treaters. They don’t always know how to stick to the safety guidelines, so keeping an eye on them and making sure that children use face masks, sanitizer, and other safety measures will help make Halloween safe and fun.\n\nK- KIDS having fun and creating positive childhood memories is what Halloween is all about. Try to follow the recommended CDC guidelines for holidays to avoid or minimize COVID exposure while having fun.\n\nY- YOUR JUDGMENT is key to making good and healthy decisions and minimizing COVID-19 exposure. In addition to wearing masks and getting vaccinated for layers of protection for you and your loved ones, take additional safety precautions such as washing your hands and be sure to stay home if anyone in your family has symptoms.\n\nWellstar is committed to providing high-quality, tailored, and compassionate care.

Wellstar is the only health system in Georgia included in the inaugural listing and was honored for demonstrating a commitment to workforce diversity, including leadership positions.\n\n“Healthcare organizations widely promote their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts when they're first announced. But it's more important to track success and make sure those initiatives deliver on the long-term results the companies and communities they serve expect. This year, we increased the cadence of our diversity recognition program and expanded eligibility to include companies as a whole, as well as individuals,” said Modern Healthcare editor, Aurora Aguilar. “The 2021 class of Top Diversity Leaders lead the pack in healthcare. These are people and companies that exemplify ‘walking the walk.’”\n\nThis is the inaugural year for Modern Healthcare’s Top Organizations for Diversity awards, which recognize healthcare companies that are “bolstering the diversity of their workforces” at all levels.\n\n“Wellstar is committed to fostering an inclusive culture and workforce that mirrors the communities we serve and celebrates our diversity,” said Candice L. Saunders, president and chief executive officer, Wellstar Health System. “Some of our greatest impacts are a direct result of the diversity of our people: the incredible talent we attract, the daily contributions of our team members, the positive effects we create in our communities, and the programs, resources, and initiatives we implement as a leading healthcare provider. Being recognized as one of Modern Healthcare ten Top Organizations for Diversity honors not just what we do, but who we are.”\n\nInclusion drives positive impact\n\nWellstar has a long-standing commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. In 2020, Wellstar formally launched the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Advisory Council to identify opportunities to grow and drive positive change for its communities, patients and team members. The Council holds regular listening sessions to ensure the voices of team members across the organization are heard and reflected in a connected cycle of feedback across the system. Every Wellstar facility and department is represented in Wellstar’s diversity efforts.\n\nNurturing a diverse workplace that mirrors its communities, approximately 81% of Wellstar’s employees are women, and just over half (51%) of the workforce is comprised of minorities. When it comes to ascension, 47% of Wellstar’s executives and 77% of frontline managers are women, while minority executives make up 21% of the workforce, with minorities in 38% of the frontline management roles.\n\nWellstar believes every person should have access to safe, high-quality healthcare and offers inclusive medical services across its System. In 2019, Wellstar opened a family medicine practice providing specialized health services to people who identify as LGBTQ+. Additionally, physicians are trained to talk about specific issues that the LGBTQ+ community may encounter and support patients through transition goals with gender-affirming care. Wellstar also employs native-language interpreters across the System to serve patients and their families, including a team of full-time Spanish interpreters, a Mandarin Chinese interpreter, as well as full-time Nationally Certified American Sign Language interpreters to support Deaf and hard-of-hearing patients and their families.\n\nHealth system acknowledged as employer of choice and diversity advocate\n\nWellstar is regularly recognized for diversity excellence, including accolades from Diversity MBA magazine, Diversity Best Practices, Working Mother/Working Father, and National Association for Executive Women (NAFE), among others. Wellstar recently received two awards exemplifying excellence that include Great Place to Work® and PEOPLE magazine’s 2021 PEOPLE Companies that Care®, and Atlanta Business Chronicle’s 2021 Healthiest Employers. Wellstar has been recognized for outstanding diversity efforts and named in Fortune’s “Best Companies to Work For” and “Best Workplaces for Diversity.”\n\nWellstar Health System has received two prestigious awards that exemplify excellence: Great Place to Work® and PEOPLE magazine’s 2021 PEOPLE Companies that Care®, and Atlanta Business Chronicle’s 2021 Healthiest Employers.\n\nThe two accolades underscore Wellstar’s focus on “More than healthcare. PeopleCare.”—putting people first both inside and outside the walls of Wellstar across the many communities and regions served by the health system.\n\n“People are at the center of everything we do at Wellstar, and these awards underscore our dedication to compassionate care and wellness for everyone we serve,” said David A.

This is Wellstar’s first time being named to this prestigious list, this year coming in at 50th place of the 100 companies recognized. Earning a spot means that Wellstar is one of the best companies to work for in the country. Wellstar is one of only four Georgia-based companies and one of only six health systems included in the ranking.\n\nWellstar was highlighted for its LGBTQ+ primary care family practice in Atlanta and for the more than $900 million invested last year in charity care, unreimbursed care and community programs as a leading non-profit health system.\n\n“These companies show up for humanity in a variety of ways—from showing compassion for their employees to giving back to their communities to putting diversity, equity and inclusion in the forefront,” says Michael C. Bush, CEO of Great Place to Work®. “They are paving the way for more socially responsible business and are fostering high-trust workplaces for all. Congratulations to the winners of the PEOPLE's Companies that Care list!”\n\nThe PEOPLE Companies that Care award is highly competitive and based on analysis of survey responses from more than five million current employees across all industries and U.S. geographies. Companies were only considered if they are a Great Place to Work-Certified™ organization.\n\nPrioritizing health and wellness for team members\n\nWellstar was recognized on the Atlanta Business Chronicle’s 2021 Healthiest Employers list in the “Extra Large Company” category as one of only two health systems included. Healthiest Employers recognizes the innovative organizations that have created robust healthy workplace programs and companies that go “above and beyond to create a culture of wellness.”\n\nWellstar was included in this prestigious list as an organization that takes proactive measures to “better the lives of employees through innovative programs and leadership commitment.”\n\nThe assessment measures wellness programming in six categories: leadership commitment, foundational components, strategic planning, communication and marketing, programming and interventions, and reporting and analytics.\n\nIn addition to serving its mission to enhance the health and well-being of everyone in the communities it serves, Wellstar invests significantly in its more than 24,000 team members across Georgia, with broad and innovative resources, programs, and initiatives. From wellness rooms, concierge services, fitness facilities and services, and childcare support, to paternity leave, wellness apps, and mental health services and hotlines, Wellstar is committed to putting people first and caring for those who provide care for Georgians each and every day.\n\nWellstar Health System, which has the largest trauma network in the state, has announced that the Wellstar Kennestone Hospital Trauma Center has been verified as one of only four Georgia Level II Trauma Centers by the American College of Surgeons (ACS). This achievement recognizes the Trauma Center's dedication to providing optimal care for injured patients.\n\nBuilding on Wellstar’s commitment to healthcare excellence, the system was also named a top-five finalist for the American Hospital Association’s 2021 Quest for Quality Prize and had 130 physicians – representing almost 26% of the total list – named as Georgia Trend “Top Doctors.”\n\nLargest Trauma Network in Georgia Adds LII Trauma Care Verification for Wellstar Kennestone\n\nWellstar operates the largest trauma network in Georgia, with Wellstar Kennestone’s new state-of-the-art emergency department, which opened in July 2020, being one of the largest and busiest in the nation. Kennestone provides comprehensive trauma care, with 24/7 access to on-site trauma, critical care trained surgeons, and a wide range of surgical subspecialties to consistently meet the needs of the most seriously injured patients following the highest care, quality and safety standards.\n\nEstablished by the ACS in 1987, the Committee on Trauma’s (COT) Consultation/Verification Program for Hospitals promotes the development of trauma centers. Participants provide the hospital resources and level of care necessary to address the needs of all injured patients across the entire trauma continuum of care. Trauma center verification provides a structure for trauma care that can raise the overall level of performance throughout a hospital.\n\nThis prestigious verification recognizes the Wellstar Kennestone Trauma Center’s commitment to providing the highest quality of care for injured patients, spanning community outreach and injury prevention efforts, emergency trauma, operative care, critical care, and rehabilitation.\n\n\"Receiving this verification further validates the exceptional life-saving care we provide at Wellstar Kennestone for patients who have suffered from all ranges of traumatic injury,\" said Mary Chatman, Wellstar Health System executive vice president and president of Wellstar Kennestone and Windy Hill Hospitals. \"We are so proud of the Trauma Center team's commitment to ensuring that all patients get the appropriate care in a timely and coordinated manner because our communities rely on Wellstar to provide the very best care for every person, every time.\"\n\nTrauma is the leading cause of death and disability between ages 0-44 and the fourth leading cause of death overall. According to the Georgia Trauma Foundation, nine main causes account for 92.1% of trauma in Georgia. The leading causes of major trauma are motor vehicle crashes (37.7%); falls (22.2%); gunshot wounds (8.0%); motorcycle crashes (5.4%); pedestrian incidents (5.2%); assaults (4.3%); accidents (4.0%); stab wounds (2.9%) and all-terrain vehicle crashes (2.4%).\n\nTop Five Finalist for National Quality Award\n\nAs an additional indicator of excellence, Wellstar was one of only five national American Hospital Association 2021 Quest for Quality Prize finalists. The award recognizes healthcare leadership and innovation in providing, improving, and advancing health in communities.\n\nNominees are highlighted for partnering with community organizations to improve health outcomes, developing new models of care, and collaborating with patients to design the patient care experience. One way that Wellstar addresses vital community needs to enhance health and wellness is via the Wellstar Center for Health Equity (WCHE). Over the past year, the WCHE orchestrated multiple, high-impact initiatives, including free pop-up COVID-19 testing, mobile food markets, and anchoring vulnerable patients with resources, benefiting thousands of Georgians. Wellstar was also honored for pandemic response efforts, including quickly leveraging telehealth to serve patients, creating team member mental wellness programs, and allocating and redeveloping resources across the system.\n\nGeorgia Trend Highlights Wellstar Physicians as Top Doctors\n\nThe May issue of Georgia Trend included the 2021 “Top Doctors,” the second annual listing of the state’s top physicians.
