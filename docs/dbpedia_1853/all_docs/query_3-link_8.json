Lilieholm Richardson Great Lakes Forest Industry, Products and Resources Summit Keshena, WI, June 7, 2012\n\n2. Undergraduate Enrollments in Natural Resources by Region for NAUFRP Institutions, 1980-2009  Similar trends across all regions  Peaks in early 1980s & mid 1990s  Increasing since 2005- 2006  Overall decrease of 13% since 1980\n\n3. Degree Classifications  Forestry (forestry, forest science, forest ecosystem science, forest resources, forest management, urban forestry, forest engineering/operations, fire, horticulture)  Wood Science/Products (wood science, wood products, wood technology, forest products, paper science)  Fisheries & Wildlife  Recreation (recreation, tourism, parks, interpretation, communications)  Watershed Science/Management (watershed science, watershed management, hydrology)  Range Science/Management (range science, range management, rangeland resources)  Natural Resources/Environmental Management (natural resources management; planning, policy, and economics; environmental management and science; environmental conservation; environmental studies; conservation management; conservation biology; restoration ecology/management; applied ecology; geography, interdisciplinary)  Soils & Geology  Other (landscape architecture, GIS, land surveying, spatial science, biotechnology, human dimensions, construction management)  Undeclared\n\n4.

Factors Affecting Overall Tends in Natural Resource Enrollments  Complex (multivariate)  Trends differ from overall higher ed enrollments (which track the total population over age 16)\n\n13. Political Party of U.S. President, and Political Control of Congress and Supreme Court, 1979 to 2010\n\n14. Changing Values: Survey of College Freshman—Idealism to Materialism U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Statistical Abstract.

Gallup poll: environmental protection vs. economic growth, 1984 to 2011 With which one of these statements about the environment and the economy do you most agree -- [ROTATED: protection of the environment should be given priority, even at the risk of curbing economic growth (or) economic growth should be given priority, even if the environment suffers to some extent]?\n\n16. Reasons for Especially Sharp Declines in Forestry Enrollments  Diversification of degree offerings in Natural Resources Colleges (demand-driven).  Changing public values towards forests (shift from utilitarian/economic view, to a broader array of ecosystem values) (Xu & Bengston 1991, MEA 2005).  Public association of forestry with the utilitarian/economic perspective (Wellman 1987, Luckert 2006, Sharik & Frisk 2011).  Professional association of forestry with specialization in managing wood resources.  Not attractive to females and minorities.  Inflexible curricula bound by accreditation standards compared to other natural resource fields (especially regarding transfer students).  Shift in hiring practices in federal agencies toward natural resource generalists.  Declining (tree) harvest levels on National Forests – a resource typically managed by foresters.\n\n17. Negative Image of Forestry--Global  USA: ―Low gender diversity in the workforce and concerns over a negative public image of forestry were also cited as sources of hesitancy (by forestry majors) to matriculating in a forestry program‖ (Sharik 2008).  CANADA: ―….the forestry schools will join forces with the broader forestry community to enhance the image of the forest sector and the forestry profession‖ (Smith 2008).  ASIA PACIFIC: ―…..there is a renewed interest from (forestry) professionals seeking to move to a career which is more environmentally oriented or directed to the public good…..‖ (Kennan and Kanowski 2008).  LATIN AMERICA: ―The academic improvement of the forest professional, and his image in the society, constitutes one of the greatest challenges of RELAFOR.‖ (Latin American Forestry Education Network) (Encinas 2008)\n\n18. Forestry and Wood Science/Products Enrollments & Logging Employment\n\n19. Perception of Lack of Jobs and Low Wages  Not an accurate depiction of the current work force.\n\n20.

FAEIS baccalaureate enrollment in NR/Conservation as a percentage of 18- to 24-year-old population in each group by race/ethnicity, 2005-2009\n\n34. Degrees awarded in Natural Resources and Conservation at tribal institutions, 2002- 2010\n\n35. Degrees awarded in Natural Resources and Conservation as a percent of total degrees awarded at tribal institutions, 2002-2010\n\n36. Conclusions  Enrollments have varied significantly across time, but overall have not increased since 1980.  Trends experienced across all U.S. regions.  Reasons for changes in NR enrollments over time are complex, likely involving a number of demographic, economic & social factors.  NAUFRP institutions and public & private sector employers need a better understanding of the factors affecting:  Undergraduate & graduate enrollments  Job & career opportunities, both now and over the long-term\n\n37. Conclusions--continued  Under-representation of minorities in natural resources is a particularly critical issue.\n\n38. Pertinent References  Luckert, M.K. 2006.
