        "text": "All the votes (for January) are [finally] in!\n\nBelow are the results for the TechNet Guru Awards, January 2020 !!!!\n\nThe TechNet Guru Awards celebrate the technical articles on TechNet, contributed from valued wiki authors like YOU! Each month, the contributions are scored by a panel of judges (5 per category, 2-3 in each are MS experts), and the winners of each category are showered with love and attention from all corners of TechNet. See the links at the bottom, to find out more about the competition and how to enter.\n\nWe have picked the top three highest scored contributions for each category to bestow our awards upon. The awards are in gold, silver and bronze, the gold obviously being the top winner of the category. The last column is just a few of the comments judges made during the judging process. In some cases, we have not obtained permission to use the judges names, so they have been reduced to initials.\n\nMy fellow wiki ninjas will be digging deeper into some of these articles in this blog series, so watch out for those. Any of our judges can exercise their right to veto an article, if they do not feel it meets minimum requirements for a medal. When this is the case, we will at least give an indication of the reason, so you understand why.\n\nA big thank you also to the other authors who did not make the top three of each category.\n\nSome articles only just missed out, so we may be returning to discuss those too, in future blogs.\n\nASP.NET Technical Guru - January 2020\n\nSYED SHANU Draw Dynamic ASP.NET Core Blazor Bar Chart using Canvas Extensions Sabah Shariq: \"Great!
