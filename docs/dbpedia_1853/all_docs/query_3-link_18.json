        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe genus Aronia Medik., also known as chokeberry, is a group of deciduous shrubs in the Rosaceae family, subtribe Malinae. The two commonly accepted black-fruited Aronia species are black chokeberry [Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott] and aroniaberry [Aronia mitschurinii (A.K. Skvortsov & Maitul)].

Expt. 2 confirmed the 900-h chilling requirement for A. mitschurinii ‘Viking’. For both experiments, the rate of budbreak and shoot growth was positively correlated with increasing amounts of chilling.\n\nAronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott, commonly known as black chokeberry, are multistemmed deciduous shrubs belonging to the Rosaceae family, subtribe Malinae (Sun et al. 2018). Interest in Aronia has increased because their fruits contain high levels of polyphenolic compounds, primarily anthocyanins, and high antioxidant activity that is beneficial for human nutrition (Brand et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2004; Zheng and Wang 2003). Aronia species are also a valuable replacement for invasive exotic ornamental plants (Brand 2010) and are adaptable to a wide range of geographic regions. A. melanocarpa is native to North America and can easily be identified by the presence of ovate to obovate glabrous leaves and dark colored fruits in mid to late summer. A. melanocarpa are found as diploids (A. melanocarpa-2x) and tetraploids (A. melanocarpa-4x) in the wild and reproduce sexually and asexually via diplosporous apomixis, respectively (Mahoney et al. 2019). The base chromosome number for Aronia is n = 17 (Sax 1931). Most A. melanocarpa-2x are found in the northeastern United States, predominantly in the New England region (Brand 2010; Brand et al. 2022). A. melanocarpa-4x are found in the Northeast, primarily outside of New England, and span into southern Canada, the midwestern United States, the Great Lakes region, and southward into Appalachia (Brand 2010; Brand et al. 2022). A. melanocarpa-4x found across the southern-most parts of the range have distinct morphology and genetic profiles (Brand et al. 2022), and perhaps warrant re-classification as a distinct species. Another tetraploid Aronia species, used in fruit production, has been recognized as A. mitschurinii (A. mitschurinii-4x) (Skvortsov and Maitulina 1982; Skvortsov et al. 1983) and is the result of intergeneric hybridization between A. melanocarpa and Sorbus aucuparia (Leonard et al. 2013; Mahoney et al. 2018). Aronia fruit production is composed primarily of a single cultivar, A. mitschurinii ‘Viking’. Several other A. mitschurinii cultivars are reported, but these have been found to be exactly, or nearly, genetically identical to A. mitschurinii ‘Viking’ (Mahoney et al. 2018).\n\nCultivation of woody-temperate plants requires an adequate accumulation of chilling temperatures once dormancy is achieved to initiate growth in spring (Arora et al. 2003). These plants have evolved this critical period of dormancy, referred to as endodormancy, to minimize low temperature damage to vegetative and floral buds by delaying budbreak until warm temperatures return. This form of dormancy is typically initiated by low temperatures and short daylengths. However, a previous study has shown that some plants in the Rosaceae family are insensitive to photoperiod for dormancy induction (Heide and Prestrud 2005). After a period of chilling, endodormancy is broken and the plant is ready to initiate budbreak. It has been well documented that chilling requirements vary between species and genotypes from different geographical locations, but the exact biochemical and genetic mechanisms are still unknown (Campa and Ferreira 2018; Leida et al. 2012; Mehlenbacher 1991). The accumulation of chill units experienced by the plant is an important factor that determines when budbreak will occur.\n\nThe limited diversity of Aronia germplasm in fruit production and the ornamental landscape has prompted breeding efforts to focus on developing traits relating to disease pressure, fruit quality, and adaptability to changing climates. In the present study, we identify the chilling requirements for the commercial fruit type, A. mitschurinii ‘Viking’, and the different chilling requirements for budbreak in wild A. melanocarpa genotypes representing a wide geographic range."
