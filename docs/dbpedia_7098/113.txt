Jalesh Cruises, a recently launched company under India's Zen Cruises, has held an official naming ceremony for Karnika, the first vessel to join its fleet.

Built by Fincantieri, the vessel was originally delivered as Crown Princess to Monte Carlo-based Sitmar Cruises in 1990. It last sailed as Pacific Jewel with P&O Australia until March of this year.
