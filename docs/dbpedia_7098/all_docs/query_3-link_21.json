        "text": "The World Cruise Center at the Port of Los Angeles is a sprawling, three-building complex near the western base of the Vincent Thomas Bridge that accommodates massive cruise ships that travel the world.\n\nIts traffic is such that the port is attempting to build an additional cruise ship berth in the Outer Harbor to handle the overflow and serve larger ships.\n\nThe Los Angeles Harbor has always had a pleasure cruise trade since the early 1900s, when ships carried passengers to Catalina Island. Completed in 1920, the Catalina Terminal on Water Street, in Wilmington, was one of the first facilities built specifically for tourist travel.\n\nThat same year, the Los Angeles Steamship Co. was founded, initially to offer passenger cruises from LA to San Francisco on its ships, the Yale and the Harvard, based at Berth 155. In 1922, the company began passenger service to Honolulu on its City of Los Angeles steamship.\n\nIndividual cruise line companies continued operating from various berths at the port, but there was no centralized passenger terminal.\n\nBy the 1940s, American President Lines had established one of the port’s largest cruise passenger operations at Berths 153 and 154 on Mormon Island. But on June 22, 1947, the tanker ship Markay exploded while taking on fuel at the Shell Oil terminal, across the channel at Berth 167. Flaming fuel from the exploding ship raced across the 600-foot wide waterway to the APL terminal buildings, which were destroyed.\n\nAPL responded by building a new $4.3 million terminal on the eight-acre site of the former one. The state-of-the-art buildings opened in 1950 and included the largest passenger/cargo terminal in the harbor.\n\nAPL’s terminal served the cruise lines for the next decade, but in 1958, the port decided the time finally had come to build a central cruise ship terminal complex. The new $15 million complex would be constructed on a 50-acre site at Berths 91 to 93 on the main channel, just south of the Vincent Thomas Bridge.\n\nThe gigantic main terminal was dedicated in March 1963, eight months before the bridge opened. The Port of Los Angeles owned the facility, but management and operations were conducted by Consolidated Marine, a consortium of cruise ship operators, including APL and Pacific Far East Line.\n\nThe rectangular, $4.3 million two-story building, 100 Swinford St., devoted its upper level for cruise travel operations and its lower level for cargo. A spectators gallery was built on the upper level, along with two vehicle bridges up from ground level. The Berth 93 structure was remodeled and expanded in 2002.\n\nThe construction of the separate Catalina Sea and Air Terminal, just north of it at Berth 95, in 1966 continued the process of centralizing passenger services in the port. Its current building on the site was erected in 2012.\n\nThe 1980s brought about a cruise ship boom, fueled in part by television’s “Love Boat” and the cruise industry’s development of ever-larger and more luxurious ships, which resulted in a 400% increase in passengers in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1988.\n\nThe port responded by building a new $11 million passenger terminal just south of the original one. It opened on April 29, 1988, with the cruise ship Azure Seas as its first arrival. The new building, dedicated solely to passenger ships, had a friendlier and less industrial feel than its predecessor.\n\nIt was built through a cooperative lease agreement involving six companies: Princess Cruises, Admiral Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Viking Line, Sitmar Cruises and Cunard Line. (Carnival moved its operations from the Port of Los Angeles to the Port of Long Beach in 2003.)\n\nAs cruise ships continued to grow larger in size, some limitations to the World Cruise Terminal began to appear in the early 2000s. It turns out the 185-foot-high Vincent Thomas Bridge is too low for some of the newer ships, which can be 200 feet tall or higher, to pass under in order to turn around when they leave the port. Instead, larger ships need to exit the area by going backward, as the Queen Mary 2 had to do in 2006.\n\nPort of Los Angeles officials first confirmed that they had been looking at a proposal to create a new passenger terminal at the entrance to the Main Channel in 2003. They’re still discussing building the Outer Harbor Cruise Terminal 20 years later.\n\nThe 13-acre site, encompassing Berths 46 and 50, 3011 Miner St., sits across the West Channel from Cabrillo Beach and Cabrillo Marina, in San Pedro, and some in the community have complained that the giant ships that would moor there would mar the ocean views in the area.\n\nDebate continued until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic brought a sudden halt to cruise ship operations and further development of the Outer Harbor was tabled for two years.\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles still sees the Outer Harbor facility as a key part of its strategy to grow the cruise ship business. The cruise industry resumed operations last year, which most likely will lead to further attempts to make the port’s Outer Harbor plans a reality."
