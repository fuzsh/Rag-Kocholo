        "text": "With prognostications in order as the New Year rolls around, the sages in the travel industry are once again wringing out the old clichés and bringing in the new. In the process they have dusted off the old crystal ball, thrown caution to the winds and gone out on a limb to predict that 1979, from the tourist's standpoint, will be positively out of this world.\n\nAs evidence, they point to the fact that two of the major events on the 1979 calendar are a total eclipse of the sun in February (the last one over the United States until 2017), and the launching of the first manned reusable space shuttle from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in September.\n\nBut even at ground level, the experts say, 1979 promises to be a busy year for tourists, with enough activities in the offing to arouse the wanderlust in the most sedentary of armchair travelers.\n\nAmong other things, there are a raft of new cruises to take, a bunch of new hotels to visit — which will be dwelt on below — and a veritable banquet of airfare bargains, which are discussed in detail elsewhere on this page.\n\nBonus From Customs\n\nThen, too, travelers will have another bonus, courtesy of United States Customs, which recently raised the duty‐free allowance for returning Americans from $100 to $300 (and from $200 to $600 for those returning from the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa or Guam).\n\nEven though there are no earth‐shaking events like world fairs on the calendar, travel industry spokesmen insist that there will be more than enough activity to belie the labels that a few naysayers have affixed to 1979, among them, the “Bicentennial‐Plus‐Three,” “Olympics‐Minus‐One” or leap year (“one they would prefer to leap over in order to\n\nFrance, Italy and the Low Countries, for example, have issued a wholesale invitation to the 12.9 million American veterans of World War II to join in celebrations of the 35th anniversary of DDay. California will be staging a quadricentennial celebration in observance of the 1579 landing by Sir Francis Drake, and there will be anniversary observances as well connected with two of the greatest achievements of humankind — the Industrial Revolution in England and the invention of the incandescent electric light bulb in America.\n\nAustria and Switzerland are extending invitations to motorists to drive through the new Arlberg Tunnel, the longest trans‐Alpine road tunnel in Europe. Monte Carlo is opening a multimillion‐dollar convention center on the Riviera. Brussels, Belgium, and the Isle of Man are throwing 1,000th birthday parties; and the city of Regensburg, Germany, is doubling the ante by celebrating its 2,000th anniversary with a year‐long round of festivities.\n\nOn the hotel front, the Middle East will be buzzing with construction activity next year as new tourist facilities open at practically every turn. Hilton will unveil a hotel and International Trade and Exhibition Center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; the 39‐story structure will he the tallest building in the Arab world. Marriott will open five new hotels, including three in Saudi Arabia, and will complete construction on the 1,260‐room Cairo Marriott, the largest hostelry in the Middle East. The hotel will have as its centerpiece the Gezira Palace, a mere bagatelle that Napoleon built for the Empress Eugenie island in the Nile.\n\nPersian Gulf Boatel\n\nMarriott will also open a “boatel” in Kuwait next February, when the former cruise ship Stella Polaris, permanently berthed on the Persian Gulf, will assume a new role as a luxury hotel, with six acres of shore attractions, including a swimming pool and sports facilities.\n\nSheraton will add about 25 properties in Europe and the Middle East next year, with a 700‐room facility going up at Heliopolis, near Cairo, and another at Hurghada, Egypt. Sheraton will also launch two Nile River cruise boats, the Tut and the Aton, next March.\n\nAmong the organizations that have compiled lists of events, available free for the asking, are the European Travel Commission, 488 Madison Avenue, New York 10022, and the Pacific Area Travel Association, 228 Grant Avenue, San Francisco, Calif. 94108 (415‐986‐4646). Here are some highlights culled from these and other sources:\n\n¶ Eclipse ‘79—The main astronomical event for next year and for many years to come will be the total eclipse of the sun on Feb. 26. The eclipse will begin at dawn in the eastern Pacific Ocean near the mouth of the Columbia Rivet and the shadow will pass over Portland, Ore., Walla Walla, Wash., Helena. Mont., Brandon, Manitoba, in Canada and pass on to Hudson's Bay and Greenland, where it will end at sunset.\n\nThe rest of America will experience only a partial eclipse.\n\nFrom Feb. 23‐27, Big Sky, Montana, the mountain resort founded by the late Chet Huntley, will sponsor an outing called “Eclipse Over Big Sky Country” that will include a four‐night stay at the resort with all meals, plus scientific lectures and a bus caravan tracing the course of totality. The cost: $385, plus air fare to and from Bozeman, Mont. For details, contact Phil Sigler in New York at 212‐722‐6955.\n\n¶ Space Shuttle — The United States will usher in a new era in the Space Age with the launching of the first reusable manned space shuttle an the Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral, Fla., in September. The shuttle will be launched like a rocket and land like a jetliner and will he capable of taking as many as 100 flights into space before being replaced.\n\nThe Kennedy Space Center, located on a direct path eastward from Disney World and Orlando, Fla., attracts upwards of a million visitors a year and during the build‐up for the space shuttle flights, the attendance is expected to soar, culminating in the blast‐off when hundreds of thousands of tourists are expected to line the beaches up and down the coast. Bus tours of the 140,000acre Kennedy Space Center cost $3 for adults and $1 for children, but after viewing the spacecraft, one can go on to the adjacent Merritt Island National Wildlife Area, where 200 species of birds make their\n\n¶ 100 Years of Light — The Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, N.J., will observe the 100th anniversary of the invention of the incandescent electric light by Thomas Alva Edison with a year‐round tribute to the genius who spent most of his productive years in New Jersey.\n\nThe Edison home and laboratory on the site will be open seven days a week, with continuous tours from 9:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. (admission 50 cents). Edison, who died in 1931, held more than 1,000 patents, including the incandescent lamp, the phonograph and the motion picture, inventions that he attributed to “ninety‐nine percent perspiration and one percent inspiration.”\n\n¶ Sir Francis Drake Quadricentennial — With a series of gala celebrations next spring, California will mark the 400th anniversary of the landing in 1579 by Sir Francis Drake, the great English trecbootci. Historians believe Drake sailed the Golden Hinde right past San Francisco Bay, entirely missing the. Gulden Gate and dropping anchor instead at a smaller coastal indentation known today as Drake's Bay, 30 miles to the north.\n\nThe celebrations will begin on May 12 with “A Revel of Discoveries” at the Clark Library of the University of California at Los Angeles, and will culminate in day‐long festivities in the San Francisco area on June 17. A large contingent of British troops, including a Scottish pipe band, will join the United States Sixth Army Band in ??remonies at the Grace Episcopal Cathedral on San Francisco's Nob Hill, and a special exhibit entitled The Famous Voyage of Sir Francis Drake” will open at the Oakland Museum. A replica of the Golden Hinde, Drake's vessel that circumnavigated the globe between 1777 and 1780, is now undergoing repairs in Oakland and is expected to participate in a re‐enactment of the California landing June 16.\n\n¶ Monte Carlo Convention Center —Some 50 international organizations have already booked conferences for 1979 in the new Monte Carlo Convent ion Center and Auditorium, described as the finest facility of its type in Europe.\n\nBuilt on land reclaimed from the Mediterranean, the center can accommodate more than 1,200 peuple in its main hall, and it is expected to hying Monaco the tit le as the premier convention destinat ion on the Cote d'Azur. The center has glass walls three stories high that corn mand spectacular views of harbor and sea.\n\n¶ Ironbridge, England — This little town on the River Severn, 13 miles southeast of Shrewsbury, will be the scene of year‐long celebratinns marking the centenary of the 1879 construction of the world's first iron bridge, a structure that still stands, and that gave the town its name.\n\nThe centenary festivities will take place in the fronbridge Gorge Museum and will also commemorate the birth of the Industrial Revolution. Historians, of course, affix a much earlier date to the start of the Industrial Revolution in England (around 1760, in fact), but this won't take any of the steam out of the Ironbridge celebration.\n\n¶ Brussels Millennium — Throughout 1979 the city of Brussels will celebrate the anniversary of its first thousand years of recorded history.\n\nThe year‐long birthday party will be highlighted by the April opening of a sound‐and‐light show on the Grand Place, the city's central square, and the August debut in the Palais Royal de Brussels of a major exhibition of the works of Roger Van Der Weyden (14001464), the official painter of the City of Brussels and the Court of Burgundy.\n\n¶ Isle of Man Millennium — The Isle of Man, that garden spot in the middle of the Irish Sea noted for its fourhorned sheep, its cats without tails and its horse‐drawn trolleys, is embarking on a year‐long celebration to mark the 1,000th birthday of its Tynwald, which it claims is the world's oldest parliament.\n\nThe program will include pageants, parades and special exhibits dealing with the island's history and culminate in the proclamation of the Tynwald on July 5, a ceremony that has been carried out annually since the island came under the domination of the Vikings a thousand years ago. During the ceremony, it is the right of any Manx citizen to present a petition to the Government.\n\n¶ A Club Med ‘First’— Club Meditcrranee, the French‐based vacation village organization with 78 resorts in 24 countries, will build its first resort complex in the United States at Copper Mountain, Colo., next year.\n\nThe year‐round resort in the Rockies will have 450 beds and the recreational facilities will include a disco, a theater, tennis courts and ski slopes. In 1965, Club Med briefly took over the operation of a resort in the High Sierras at Bear Valley, Calif., but abandoned the project after one year.\n\n¶ Regensburg, Age 2,000 — The Bavarian city of Regensburg, the most westerly port on the Danube, is une of the most historic in West Germany throughout this year the city will be showing off its riches by celebrating its 2.000th birthday with festivals. A university city and home of a famous boys choir, Regensburg contains an Old Quarter that covers 270 acres and boasts more than 1,400 boaldings of historic interest. Among the ancient monuments are the Steinerne Brucke or old stone bridge buth in 1135; the Roman Porta Praetoria, or northern gate of the old Roman for tificanon, and the fifth‐century Basilica of St. Emmeram.\n\nRegensburg has one other claim to tame: Through its history it has had more than 70 ‘tunics. Browning wrote a poem about one of the names, starting You know, we French stormed Ratisbon....” and Napoleon suffered his only wound there in 1809. Exhibits dealing with the history of Regensburg will be featured in the 100‐room City Muand in the Municipal Archives.\n\n¶ New Hotels, U.S.A. – The 1,000room Loews Anatole Dallas Hotel and convention center will open officially on Jan 2 with 75 percent of its rooms booked for 1979, and 1.4 million rooms reserved several years ahead, a record for the hotel industry.\n\nThe hotel, four minutes from downtown Dallas, covers more than six acres, consists of twin interconnected buildings topped by a trio of six‐story glass pyramids, which cover two enormous atria surrounded by 24 floors of guest rooms. The hotel's Sovereign Presidential Suite will rent for $1000 a night.\n\nThe Radisson Plaza in ?? Paul. Minn., will be the first hotel in the United States to incorporate solarenergy paneling in its design. The solar panels, extending the full 16‐story height of the building, will provide heat for the hot water system in the 244room hotel, which will be nearing completion late next year. The Radisson Corporation received a grant of $7.5 million from the Federal Energy Research and Development Adminitration to develop the demonstration ?? project for hotels."
