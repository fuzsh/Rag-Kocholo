        "text": "Crystal Cruises has announced an exciting partnership with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri that will see the construction and delivery of two new and exceptional cruise ships by 2028.\n\nA memorandum of agreement was signed between the companies on 27th June, giving the green light to a project that hopes to set “a new standard in cruising”.\n\nFor Florida-based Crystal, which was bought out by premium travel agency Abercrombie & Kent in 2022, this latest development exhibits the company’s desire to expand further into the high-end luxury sector and provide top-shelf travel experiences for discerning patrons seeking the finest the luxury cruise liner industry can offer.\n\nProminent architectural firms Studio Ibsen and Studio Gem, which is headed by Naval Architect Giacomo Mortola and Naval Engineer Lorenzo Mortola, have been contracted to lead the design efforts, along with an additional international design firm that is yet to be announced.\n\n“This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family that started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and now is flourishing again with Crystal,” says Monaco resident Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, Executive Chairman of Abercrombie & Kent Travel Group.\n\nSee more: Abercrombie & Kent celebrates 60 years of pioneering travel\n\nWhen the ships are delivered in 2028, passengers – up to 690 of them on each – can expect interiors made from Italian fabrics, marble and natural materials that will ooze sophistication and be more reminiscent of luxe villas rather than a seaborne vessel.\n\nOutdoor space will be optimised with a promenade running the ship’s perimeter, much like those featured on Crystal’s other ships, Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity, with fine dining choices including Umi Uma, Beefbar and the first-ever Nobu at sea.\n\nAn on-board casino, operated in partnership with Monte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer, will provide excitement while a top-of-the-line spa will offer a fitness centre and relaxing treatments. There will even be a place for the youngest travellers, who will have their own play areas made just for them.\n\nGuests can expect suites with private verandas, a high crew to passenger ratio and Crystal’s trademark attention to detail.\n\n“Our aim is to continue setting a new standard in cruising, offering our guests an unmatched level of service and sophistication. These new ships will receive the same level of attention I reserve for my own house,” says Cristina Levis, CEO of Abercrombie & Kent.\n\nThe company has also indicated that a third ship will be delivered by 2032, adding another jewel to the Crystal Cruises fleet.\n\nRead related:\n\n“A new typology of living”: Introducing Ulyssia, the 320m residential superyacht\n\nMonaco Life is produced by real multi-media journalists writing original content.
