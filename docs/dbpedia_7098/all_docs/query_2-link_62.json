        "text": "No Berth Unsold!\n\nPresentations\n\nDexter Donham\n\nSarah Pavey\n\nTall Ships America and Sail Training International have each developed powerful new web-based platforms for promoting and selling trainee berths. This session will describe the intent and function of these websites, and how you can list your vessels and programs to maximize trainee enrollments.\n\nPresented By\n\nDexter Donham, Sailing Ship Adventures\n\nSarah Pavy, Sail Training International, Sail on Board\n\nMr. Donham was born in Cambridge, MA & brought up in New England. As an adult he lived for 25 years in California, both San Francisco & Los Angeles. He currently resides in Boston, MA, with his wife, Joan Seamster.\n\nHe is a graduate of Harvard College, where he majored in English Literature, and of the Harvard Business School, where he concentrated in Marketing. Mr. Donham was commissioned an officer in the U.S. Navy through the Officer Candidate School in Newport, RI, and served the on the USS Mars, AFS-1, as Damage Control Assistant in the Engineering Department, in the Western Pacific. He served as Chief Engineer on the USS Garrett County, LST 786, in the Mekong Delta and completed his service as Maintenance Officer at Naval Inshore Operations Training Center at Mare Island Naval Station in Vallejo, California. His business career has been in Brand Management at the Clorox Company, Market Research at Levi Strauss & Co., Director of Research & Planning at Sitmar Cruises, Director of Marketing at Princess Cruises, Vice President & General Manager at Cruises of Distinction, a large retailer of vacation cruises, and Vice President of Marketing at Elderhostel, Inc., a large not-for-profit educational travel organization. He founded Sailing Ship Adventures, a specialty booking agent for sailing vessels, as sole owner/manager in 2004. Mr. Donham has served on the Tall Ships America Board of Directors since 2002 and currently holds the position of treasurer. He has been a lifelong sailor, both inshore and offshore, in boats big & small, on the East & West Coasts of the U.S., and the Great Lakes.\n\nSarah Pavey is Digital Marketing and Communications Manager at Sail Training International in the UK. She has a degree in journalism and a background in book publishing, specializing in editorial and design/production. She started working in local history publishing at Phillimore & Co. Ltd and later moved onto travel publishing at John Wiley & Sons. Sarah moved out of print publishing and into digital at www.mindtools.com, where she worked as editor.\n\nAnd so they came from all over the world to icy, beautiful, historic, Quebec City. We are currently holed up at Tall Ships America HQ, weathering the latest winter storm and catching up on all things sail training. It is hard to believe, that after two years of planning and anticipation, our annual conference is over. It was, in a word, awesome. Sailors, sail trainers and tall ship enthusiasts from all parts of the globe (over 450 delegates! Our largest conference ever!) converged at the Fairmont Le Chateau Frontenac to discuss what we love best – sailing, tall ships and sharing our passion for both of those things. The last time we hosted a joint conference with our European counterparts, Sail Training International, was in 2008. For those of us who attended in Halifax, we knew what to expect and we weren’t disappointed. It is utterly fascinating to speak to other people about sail training. While fundamentally we are all about the ships and getting people on board those ships, the cultural differences in the approaches and the new ideas we heard are what make these joint conferences so valuable. If you missed it, presentations will be up on the blog next week (it will be announced). Some presentations were filmed. Continue reading →\n\nHere it is, folks. Here is the list of who will be in Quebec City (a final list will be provided to attendees at the conference). You can still register for the conference- It’s not too late!\n\nRegistration List – 22 January\n\nHave you seen the agenda? We have awesome sessions. And Quebec City promises to be an amazing host city. The New York Times was even kind enough to write up a whole article about what to do if you go. How helpful! 36 Hours in Quebec City\n\nBack to Basics – Transforming Customer Complaints into Opportunities\n\nPresenter\n\nBryan Bissell, Dale Carnegie Training\n\nTurn a complaint into an opportunity to create a loyal customer. Learn how cross and up selling opportunities can result from a well-handled complain. We’ll examine root causes of your common complaints and help you find ways to reduce or eliminate them. By effectively resolving complains you can reduce stress, build relationships and improve customer loyalty and retention.\n\nDale Carnegie Training sharpens skills and improves performance of people and organizations through leadership, sales, communication and employee engagement programs. Bryan Bissell holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Johannesburg, South Africa. Now a Vermont resident, Bryan sells and delivers Dale Carnegie programs in both the United States and South Africa.\n\nAccident Analysis-Using Case Studies for Crew Training\n\nPresenters\n\nCaptain Jonathan Kabak, Director, Marine Operations for USMMA Foundation\n\nCaptain Pedro Poenca Mendes, Director of Aporvela, Portuguese Sail Training Association\n\nCommander Michael Simbulan, United States Coast Guard\n\nAccident investigations are undertaken not only to determine fault, but also cause, in the name of improving maritime safety. The findings included in these reports are intended to keep mariners from making the same mistakes twice, however they are often relegated to gathering dust on a bookshelf. They are an underutilized resource outside of Bridge Resource Management classes and other STCW training. This will be a workshop on maximizing the value of maritime casualty reports for use in crew training. We will discuss the process of incident investigation and how to facilitate crew discussions to highlight relevance to their own experiences on-board. Continue reading →"
