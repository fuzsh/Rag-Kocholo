        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The new 46,000-ton Fairsky, the largest passenger ship ever built, arrived in San Francisco Saturday amidst gala ceremonies.\n\nThe Fairsky, operated by Sitmar Cruises of Los Angeles, will accomodate 1,200 passengers on cruises to Mexico, Canada and Alaska.\n\nThe 790-foot vessel was built in France at a cost of $150 millon and flies the Liberian flag.\n\nThousands of balloons were released during arrival ceremonies which included fireworks, an escort of 50 vessels and a luncheon with civic officials. The ship will have San Francisco as its home base at least part of the year.\n\nThe Pacific cruise business has been so rejuvenated that a second new cruise ship, Holland America Line's 33,000-ton Noordam, will arrive Sunday, also to make San Francisco its home port.\n\nA third new ship, the Royal Princess, now under construction in Finland for Princess Cruises, will be based on the West Coast when it goes into service next year.\n\nSitmar Cruises said the cruise industry has grown from 500,000 passengers in 1970 to 1.6 million in 1983.\n\nThe next stop for both the Fairsky and the Noordam will be Alaska."
