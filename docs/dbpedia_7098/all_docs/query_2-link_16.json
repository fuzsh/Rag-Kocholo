In addition to the attraction of sailing aboard new ships, the debut of which inevitably sets off an initial flurry of bookings, many lines are offering inducements such as fare discounts, free air fare and free land packages. (See Practical Traveler, page 3, for details.)\n\nVERNON KIDD is a New York writer, actor and singer. As a result of the political turmoil in Grenada, at least four companies - Cunard, Costa, Chandris and Home Lines - have decided to bypass the island, substituting St. Vincent or Trinidad.\n\nAnother change is the shift in course of the Scandinavia. For about a year the auto-carrying luxury vessel has been sailing between New York and the Bahamas, but the Danish owners of Scandinavian World Cruises have decided that the ship, which makes her farewell cruise from New York on Saturday, can be more profitably operated as a ferry between Copenhagen and Oslo.\n\nSeveral new ships will be making their bow through the end of 1984. Among them: the Newport Clipper of Clipper Cruise Line (100 passengers; starting service this month), the Caribbean Prince of American Canadian Line (78 passengers; debuting Dec. 4), the Fairsky of Sitmar Cruises (1,212 passengers; entering service March 3), the Savannah of American Cruise Lines (130 passengers; next April), the Sea Goddess I of Sea Goddess Cruises (120 passengers; April 7) and the Noordam of Holland America Line (1,210 passengers; next May). The Royal Princess of P & O Cruises (1,200 passengers) is to begin cruises next October.\n\nThe Newport Clipper, the Savannah and the Caribbean Prince are designed for river cruises, coastal cruises and island circumnavigation. The Caribbean Prince will make her home in Montego Bay and offer 11-night cruises around Jamaica, sailing three or four hours in the morning and leaving the rest of the day for swimming and sightseeing.\n\nThe Sea Goddess I represents a departure from the usual oceangoing experience: the amenities of a cruise ship combined with the luxury of a private yacht. The ship will have 60 outside suites, each with a sitting area, bedroom with double or twin beds and bathroom with tub and shower. Lunch and dinner will be served in an outdoor cafe with its own waterfall, and a greenhouse will double as a quiet place for drinks. The price is a relatively high $3,300 a person in double occupancy for one week; at about $500 a day, she ranks among the most expensive of ships.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
