        "text": "SilverSea can best be described as traditional luxury. Some of you have asked if it is “stuffy”, and I don’t think I’d describe it that way, although with their marketing images of tuxedoed butlers wearing white gloves, it is an easy assumption to make. While tuxedos and ball gowns are not required on SilverSea, there will be some guests that choose to dress that way.\n\nUp until 2020, SilverSea was owned by the Lefebvre family of Rome, who were the same family who owned Sitmar Cruises in the 70s and 80s. I have a special reverence for Sitmar, because it was my very first cruise, way back in 1981.\n\nSilverSea has 6 small ships (700 or less) with one more coming in 2023, and another in 2024. They also have 5 expedition ships. On this fleet, they sail to 7 continents, and so some really interesting ports of call. You’ll notice in the Travel Opportunities below, that while they may start and finish in major ports, some of the stops in between you may never heard of! This is fantastic for those that have done a lot of travelling, and want something new.\n\nThey also have an innovative fare structure. No matter what you choose, the fare is very inclusive: 24-hour gourmet dining, an open bar, superb entertainment, gratuities, on-board enrichment and lectures, a shore excursion in every port, and butler service in every suite.\n\nIf you choose their “Door to Door” fare, they will pick you up at your home, deliver you to the airport, fly you to the ship, and then do the same on your return home.\n\nWe find that most of our small-ship ocean clients make their decisions based more on itinerary than anything else. If this is the primary driver for you, then it’s worth browsing through SilverSea’s itineraries to see where they go. I’ve put a handful of examples below, but that is really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nSilverSea is also running some interesting promotions until the end of this month, and in many cases, they are combinable – meaning you may be able to take advantage of all of these:\n\nTwo category suite upgrade, and a $1000 on board credit on select sailings\n\n$500 referral credit. If you haven’t sailed with SilverSea previously but you know someone that has, they’ll offer you $500 of your suite, and give whomever referred you a $500 credit for their next trip.\n\n20% off selected sailings. There is some fine print on this offer, most notably it is payment in full at the time of booking, and it’s non-refundable, so you’ll want to make sure you put your insurance in place at the same time. This offer represents tremendous value for higher-end product like SilverSea. Here’s the link to their website where you’ll find the list of sailings this promotion applies to:\n\nList of voyages: https://www.silversea.com/best-luxury-cruise-deals/port-to-port-prepaid.html\n\nToday’s Travel Opportunities\n\nHere’s some examples from the SilverSea Pre-Paid, Port to Port fares.

Hardly any of our clients go to Europe and just do a one-week cruise, so this is definitely worth looking at:\n\nIncludes 4 or 5 star hotels, breakfasts, city tours and/or excursions, transfers, and your cruise manager travels with you from the ship (so you’re escorted through your journey). Some examples of Free Land Extensions:\n\nPrague 3-night extension (Value: $1320 per person)\n\nAmsterdam 2-night extension (Value: $1190 pp)\n\nBudapest 2-night extension (Value: $840 pp)\n\nLake Como, Italy 3-night extension (Value: $1440 pp)\n\nHere’s a link to the page: https://www.amawaterways.com/agent/pamperedcruiser/freeland-2023\n\nThere are tons of combinations, but here are two examples of how a river cruise and free land extension would stack up:\n\nRhine River Cruise departing November 16 for 7-nights on the ship and 2-nights land:\n\nAmsterdam to Basel, Switzerland\n\nVisit Cologne, Rhine Gorge, Rudesheim, Ludwigshafen, Strasbourg, Breisach,\n\nFree Amsterdam pre-cruise for 2-nights.\n\nPrices start at $3199 per person.\n\nDanube River Cruise — 4 departures in August for 7-nights on the ship, and 3-nights land:\n\nBudapest to Vilshofen (Bavaria, Germany)\n\nVisit Bratislava, Vienna, Krems, Wachau Valley, Linz, Passau.\n\nFree Prague post-cruise for 3-nights\n\nPrices start at $4199 per person.\n\nThere are lots of other combinations too.
