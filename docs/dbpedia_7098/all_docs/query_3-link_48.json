        "text": "P&O\n\nThe Oriana of 1995, Piraeus 2004 (WS)\n\nP&O Cruises\n\nThe Peninsular & Oriental or P&O, once much bigger than Cunard, used its last ocean liners for P&O Cruises. The round-the-world sailings of the flagship Canberra (45,733 gt) and the Oriana (41,915 gt) represented the pride of the P&O. Some tradition of its subsidiary British India Line, once almost as famous, survived for some time with BI Discovery Cruises, offering in the 70s Mediterranean cruises with the Uganda (17,000 gt), originally a British India liner, which finally was scrapped in 1986.\n\nThe most important change had come in 1974, when P&O bought Los Angeles-based Princess Cruises, a newcomer which soon became much bigger than its parent company  see chapter Princess Cruises. About that time, P&O acquired vessels from Norwegian Cruiseships A/S. Together with the purchased ships, also P&Os Spirit of London (1972/17,370 gt), which had been commissioned by Klosters Rederi as Seaward, was transferred to Princess Cruises, becoming the Sun Princess (and in 1995 the Southern Cross, chartered by CTC, then cruising under various Flamenco names, in 2008 arrested at Singapore).\n\nA danger was warded off when P&O appointed Jeffrey Sterling as chairman to fend off an unwanted takeover bid by Cunard Lines owners Trafalgar House  (Douglas Ward: Berlitz Complete Guide ). The next big change came in 1988 with acquisition of Sitmar Cruises by P&O (see chapter End of Liners / Italy). P&O transferred that fleet mainly to Princess Cruises and dropped the renowned label.\n\nCrown Princess, originally commissioned by Sitmar, Piraeus 1990 (WS)\n\nArcadia, commissioned as Sitmar Fair Majesty, Piraeus 2001 (WS)\n\nAurora of 2000, Venice 2011 (WS)\n\nArtemis, ex Royal Princess, Corfu 2007 (WS)\n\nP&Os traditional Oriana was sold in 1986 to become a tourist center in the Beppu Bay in Kyushu, where she sank in 2004. A new Oriana (69,153 gt), built by Meyer Werft and baptized by Queen Elizabeth II in 1995, continued the tradition of prestigious P&O ships. In 1997 P&O took out of service their beloved Canberra, justified by SOLAS regulations. Preservation schemes had no success. She was replaced by the Arcadia (63,524 gt), originally launched as Sitmar Fairmajesty, later operating for Princess Cruises as Star Princess. True successor of the Canberra however became the Aurora, with her classic appearance fairly similar to the Oriana, but with 76,152 gt larger, delivered by Meyer Werft in 2000.\n\nA festive event was the millennium cruise round Africa, undertaken by the Victoria (1966/ 28,891 gt), the former Kungsholm (IV) of Svenska Amerika Linjen, from 1979 the Sea Princess of Princess Cruises. For that occasion her funnel was painted in the colours of the traditional Union Castle Line. In 2002 she became the Mona Lisa, cruising for Holiday Kreuzfahrten, her funnel now being decorated with worlds most famous portrait.\n\nIn April 2003 P&O Cruises, including Princess Cruises, was acquired by the Carnival Corporation. That biggest deal in the cruise business was described by Welt am Sonntag (20 Feb. 2005): The decisive battle for dominating the market was won by Arison not before 2003, when he cut out his mightiest competitor Royal Caribbean during a two years struggle for taking over P&O Princess. After he had offered 8.2 billion dollars, P&O Princess became owned by Carnival  P&O Cruises was put under the command of much bigger Princess Cruises, but retained identity and brand name.\n\nSeveral times ships changed between Princess Cruises and P&O. In 2002 the Ocean Princess (77,499 gt) of the Sun class was transferred to P&O Cruises as Oceana and for a short period also her sister Sea Princess as Adonia. In 2005 followed the smaller Royal Princess, (1984/ 44,588 gt), renamed Artemis. And the series of changes continued.\n\nIn 2005 the Arcadia (IV) was put in service. Thats the 82,972-ton ship of the HAL Vista class, with diesel plus gas-turbo-electric engines and 2 pods, which initially should have become Cunards Queen Victoria, now equipped with the buff P&O funnel. In 2008 Fincantieri delivered P&Os biggest ship, the Ventura, followed by the Azzura, based on the extended Grand class of Princess Cruises, the Princess funnel being painted buff. In June 2011 Lloyds List reported a contract with Fincantieri for an $805million newbuild for 3,600 passengers, to be delivered in 2015. The interior design is by Richmond International from England. With this Britannia, P&O entered a new size, like Princess Cruises with the rather similar Royal class. And with around-the-world tours, P&O maintained British tradition with Indian staff.\n\nNewbuilds for delivery from 2005:\n\nBased on HAL Vista class\n\nFincantieri, diesel plus gas-turbo-el., 2 pods: Arcadia (2005/ 86,799 gt).\n\nBased on extended Grand class\n\nFincantieri: Ventura (2008/ 116,017 gt), Azura (2010).\n\n141,000-ton class\n\nFincantieri: Britannia (2015/ 141,500 gt)\n\nVentura of P&O, in the background Minerva and AIDAluna, Santa Cruz, Tenerife 2010 (WS)\n\nP&O Cruises (Australia)\n\nAbout the origins, Ships Monthly (April 2007) informed: Sitmar placed Fairstar in year-round cruise service in Australia in 1974. Over the next 23 years, she developed a loyal following and was the only ship based year-round in these waters until sold to scrappers in 1997. In 1979 the Sea Princess, the former Kungsholm (IV) had her first departure from Sydney. From 2002 the Pacific Princess (30,277 gt, ex R Three) cruised temporarily out of Sydney. In 2004 the Pacific Sun (47,262 gt, the former Jubilee of Carnival) and in 2005 the Pacific Star (36,674 gt, originally the Tropicale of Carnival, now with a strait funnel) was taken over. One by one the old ships were given away. In 2007 the first Pacific Sky (46,087 gt, ex Sky Princess) was replaced by the Pacific Dawn (1991/70,285 gt, ex Regal Princess), one of the two beautiful ships commissioned by Sitmar, the superstructure designed by star architect Renzo Piano. Further changes of second-hand ships continued. With another paint scheme, P&O Cruises (Australia) distinguished itself from P&O Cruises (UK).\n\nPacific Sun, Sydney 2006 (Saberwyu, via Wikimedia)\n\nPacific Dawn ex Regal Princess, Baie du Santal, New Caledonia 2009 (Pilettes, via Wikimedia)\n\nSwan Hellenic Cruises\n\nIn 1983 the P&O group took over that small exclusive enterprise, founded in 1961 by the Englishman W.F. Swan. From 2003 for the first time a midsize ship, the Minerva II (2001/ 30,277 gt, ex R Eight) operated under the Swan Hellenic label, but in 2007 she was transferred to Princess Cruises as Royal Princess. The Swan Hellenic fleet had disappeared, but the brand was acquired by Lord Sterling and then Swan Hellenic was bought by the All Leisure Group, restarting cruises with their first Minerva (1996/ 12,331 gt).\n\nMinerva II of Swan Hellenic, ex R Eight, Piraeus 2008 (WS)\n\nMinerva at Santa Cruz, Tenerife 2010 (WS)\n\nOcean Village\n\nP&O founded Ocean Village in 2003, intended to attract a younger, more casual clientele with ships painted white, colorfully decorated. The Ocean Village (63,524 gt, the former Arcadia, originally Sitmar Fairmajesty) started the service, in 2007 joined by the Ocean Village Two (ex Crown Princess, ARosa Blu, AIDAblu), one of the two 70,285 gt ships styled by Renzo Piano for Sitmar Cruises. Then it was decided to close down Ocean Village in late 2010.\n\nOcean Village Two, Venice 2009 (WS)\n\nOcean Village approaching Piraeus, 2008 (WS)\n\nkeine Daten"
