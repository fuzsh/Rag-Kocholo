        "text": "With its interesting kinetic sculpture resembling a Swiss Army Knife, the 3-deck high Atrium was the heart of the ship, with the Main Reception & Tours Office, shops, the Photo Gallery, Tiffany's coffee lounge and the lovely Century Lounge, one of our favourites for evening cocktails. The Atrium was also the venue for the Captain's Welcome Cocktail Party.\n\n(left) The 3-deck high Atrium and its kinetic sculpture - rather like a Swiss Army Knife! While unremarkable in design or decor, we found Arcadia to have a happy and friendly feel about her, and we rather liked her. That is why we returned to cruise on her a year later in 2000, and again in 2002; each time it would be with Anny and Joyce.\n\n(right) The mast and a view of the ship in Colombo, Sri Lanka Flying out to the Caribbean for calls at three islands, then a 9-day Transatlantic Crossing via Ponta Delgada in the Azores, with me doing Ballroom Dancing lessons for the first time with Joyce!\n\n(right) Arcadia at anchor at Basseterre, St Kitts\n\n(far right) Ballroom dancing with Joyce Not only was this a cruise over Christmas and New Year but with the ambitious encouragement of Anny, yet again we were off to a distant part of the world we had never seen before, the spectacular Chilean Fjords, Buenos Aires, the notorious Cape Horn and 20 years after the 1982 War, the Falkland Islands. It was supposed to be \"Summer\" in the southern hemisphere but way down south, it was really cold!\n\n(left) Dressed for Christmas - the 3-deck high Atrium and its Swiss Army Knife sculpture!"
