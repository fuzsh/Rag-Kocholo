        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nby InTrieste\n\nFincantieri and Crystal announced today the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for the construction of two high-end, next-generation cruise ships, with an option for a third unit. The value of the agreement, subject to financing and other terms and conditions, is significant.\n\nThe new units will have a gross tonnage of 61,800 tons and will be able to accommodate approximately 690 passengers. The interior design, developed by prestigious international architectural firms, will feature high-quality materials and artisanal craftsmanship. The ships will offer “all-suite” accommodations with private balconies, as well as several single-occupancy cabins, a highly demanded option ideal for solo travelers. The commitment to providing top-level comfort is confirmed by one of the highest crew-to-passenger ratios in this segment, ensuring personalized service and meticulous attention to detail.\n\nThe first ship is scheduled for delivery in the spring of 2028, with more information about the second unit to be announced later.\n\nPierroberto Folgiero, CEO and General Manager of Fincantieri, commented: “This order, in addition to demonstrating the strong recovery of the cruise sector, as anticipated by our Industrial Plan, confirms Fincantieri’s leadership, thanks to the operational excellence of our shipyards and the exceptional quality of a globally unique supply chain. We are excited to collaborate with Crystal in the pursuit of innovation and excellence, now led by an owner who has always been close to Fincantieri, Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio.”\n\nManfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, Executive Chairman of A&K Travel Group, stated: “This order represents another significant milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family, which began with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea, and is renewed today with Crystal. Our goal is to continue redefining standards in the cruise industry, offering our guests an unparalleled level of service and an elegant, refined atmosphere.”\n\nCristina Levis, CEO of A&K Travel Group, added: “Our aim is to continue setting a new standard in the cruise industry, offering our guests a level of service and sophistication that is unmatched.”"
