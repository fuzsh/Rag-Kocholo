        "text": "Luxury cruise line\n\nSilversea is an ultra-luxury and expedition travel brand headquartered in Monaco. Founded in 1994 by the Vlasov Group of Monaco and the Lefebvre family of Rome, it pioneered all-inclusive cruising with its first ship, Silver Cloud.[1] Since July 2020, it has been owned by Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding\n\n[edit]\n\nSilversea was founded in 1994 by a joint venture between V-Ships (previously known as Vlasov Group) of Monaco and Antonio Lefebvre d'Ovidio of Rome. The joint owners had previously been the co-owners of Sitmar Cruises.[2][3]\n\nAs a marketing strategy the new line introduced all-inclusive fares including gratuities, beverages, port charges, travel insurance, and some complimentary shore excursions.[3] As about 80 percent of Silversea's customers were expected to come from North America, the line established a sales office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The first president of Silversea would be John Bland, former president of Sitmar Cruises. The majority of the first office staff had worked together at Sitmar Cruises.\n\nSilversea's first ship, Silver Cloud, which entered service in April 1994, was followed in January 1995 by a sister ship, Silver Wind.[4] In September 2000, the line launched Silver Shadow and Silver Whisper in January 2001. Both of these ships were enlarged versions of the original two ships, carrying about 100 more passengers.\n\nIn June 2001, Silversea announced that Manfredi Lefebvre d'Ovidio would become chairman of Silversea, assuming the position from his brother Francesco Lefebvre dâ€™Ovidio.[5]\n\nExpedition division\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007 Silversea announced they would be starting an expedition division with the acquisition of the 144 passenger former World Discoverer.[6] Silversea hired expedition guide Conrad Combrink with a mandate to create a luxury expedition product, something that did not yet exist in the cruise industry.[7] The purchased ship was renamed Prince Albert II (now Silver Explorer) and christened by Prince Albert II of Monaco.[8]\n\nIn December 2009, Silversea launched Silver Spirit, the first in a new class of ships.\n\nOn 18 June 2012, Silversea acquired Canodros S.A., an Ecuadorian tourism company that operated in the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. The purchase of the line also included the former Renaissance ship Galapagos Explorer II. She was subsequently moved into the \"Silversea Expeditions\" brand along with Silver Explorer.[9] Silver Galapagos entered service in September 2013.[10]\n\nOn 10 September 2013, Silversea confirmed that it would be adding a third vessel to the \"Silversea Expeditions\" brand, Silver Discoverer, formerly sailing as Clipper Odyssey for Zegrahm Expeditions.[11] Silver Discoverer was christened in Singapore in March 2014 and set sail on her inaugural voyage along Australia's Kimberley Coast on 2 April 2014.[12]\n\nTrio of newbuilds\n\n[edit]\n\nFincantieri delivered the fleet's ninth ship, Silver Muse to Silversea on 2 April 2017, at its Sestri Ponente shipyard. Silver Muse's debut cruise set sail on 10 April 2017, in the Mediterranean Sea.[13] That same year, Silversea announced an order for Silver Moon, a sister ship to Silver Muse, to be built by Fincantieri and delivered in 2020.[14] In May 2018, Silversea announced an order for Silver Dawn, another sister ship of Silver Muse, delivered by Fincantieri in 2021.\n\nAcquired by Royal Caribbean\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 14 June 2018, Royal Caribbean purchased a majority stake in Silversea for approximately $1 billion from Manfredi Lefebvre d'Ovidio, son of cofounder Antonio Lefebvre d'Ovidio, and who had become the sole owner of the cruise line.[15][16] The transaction was completed in July 2018.[17] Following the announcement, Silversea ordered three new ships: two Evolution-class vessels to be built by Meyer Werft to be delivered beginning 2022 and one expedition vessel from Shipyard De Hoop to be delivered in March 2020.[18]\n\nIn July 2020, Royal Caribbean Group acquired the remaining shares of Silversea from Heritage Cruise Holding in exchange for 5.2 million shares of Royal Caribbean Group stock.[19] Silversea also took delivery of the new expedition ship the Silver Origin, built for their expedition fleet in the Galapagos Islands. This was the first new ship to be designed and completed under the new Royal Caribbean Group management.[20]\n\nOn 14 June 2022, early reports came out that Silversea was very interested in purchasing Crystal Endeavor from the defunct Crystal Cruises brand, with records of the trademarked name Silver Endeavor being filled. However, it was further reported on 28 June, that both The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection and the former owners of Silversea, Heritage Cruise Holding (who recently purchased the two Crystal ships and the entire brand) were still interested in purchasing the vessel as well.[21] Silversea's purchase was confirmed in July 2022, with a purchase price of $275 million, and the ship being renamed Silver Endeavor.[22]\n\nIn December 2022, Barbara Muckerman replaced Roberto Martinoli as Silversea President and CEO.[23]\n\nEvolution class\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 2023, Silversea took delivery of their twelfth ship, Silver Nova, part of the new Evolution class of vessel, and innovative asymmetrical design, and the largest ship for the line.[24] The ship was named on 4 January 2024, which also kicked off Silversea's 30th anniversary year.[25] The second ship, Silver Ray, is to enter service in 2024.[26][27]\n\nOn 12 April 2024, it was announced that Bert Herndez replaced Barbara Muckermann as president of Silversea Cruises.[28]\n\nOn 14 May 2024 Silversea took delivery of the second Evolution-class ship, Silver Ray, in Eemshaven, Netherlands, two days earlier than planned,[29] with a maiden voyage scheduled for 15 June from Lisbon, Portugal.[30]\n\nFleet\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nThe table lists the current fleet of ships operated by Silversea Cruises.[31]\n\nShip Built Builder In service\n\nfor Silversea Passengers Gross tonnage Flag Christened by Notes Image Silver Cloud 1994 Francisco Visentini (hull)\n\nT.
