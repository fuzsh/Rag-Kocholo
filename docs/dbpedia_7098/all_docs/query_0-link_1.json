        "text": "I noticed in the \"remember the old days\" thread that a lot of people had cruised Sitmar previously.\n\nCan anyone fill me in on what type of line Sitmar was in comparison to Princess at the time (classier, more expensive?) and what the circumstances were with Princess buying out Sitmar.\n\nIt sounded like Sitmar had several ships (Fair, Sky?) and 2 on order (Crown and Regal?). Did Princess have about the same amount of ships at the time or did they have more?\n\nThanks for filling me in on the \"history\" of Sitmar and Princess purchasing Sitmar.\n\nHi--\n\nMy wife and I went on a 10 day Carribean cruise for our honeymoon in 1987 on Sitmar's Fairsky. As I recall, at the time, it was the biggest passenger ship in the world. I am not sure how big the ship was, but it seemed more intimate than today's large Princess ships. I remember having more interaction with the ship's officers. I guess with fewer people on board, that would come as no surprise. I think there was one dining room and two separate seatings. I don't really recall there being other eating options, though I think they had some buffets set up outside for partiees on tow or three of the nights. I also remember they had hot chicken broth available on the deck about mid-morning to warm you up--tho it was already pretty warm outside. When we boarded, somebody escorted us to our cabin, and the cabin had two twin beds separated by a night stand---no way to move the beds together--not ideal for a honeymoon. We also had more interaction with our cabin steward. As I recall, the average age of the crowd seemed older to me than what I see on cruise ships now--I remember a lot of older folks doting on us--the cute young honeymoon couple--kind of like having a few hundered grandparents on board. I am not sure if there was a tv in the cabin--I don't remember.\n\nI remember it being a great time--it was my first cruise.\n\nBJS - Fascinating! Thanks for that link. I agree that Fairwind seemed the most elegant thing ever (I was in my early 30's). I don't remember being particularly impressed with the way it looked - but I was totally amazed at the kind of service we received! We had cabin stewards, bar stewards, deck stewards, waiters, assistant waiters, and what seemed like a host of people (and by modern standards it probably was a host) whose only mission in life was to fulfill our slightest wish.\n\nI wish I could remember what we paid for the trip. One thing I do remember, however, is being terrified of going to the Purser's Office to clear my onboard bill after two weeks of uninhibited spending. The total was a very small $135 - amazingly cheap even by the standards of that day! A bottle of Moet&Chandon (one of the most expensive wines onboard) was all of $10!\n\nDon't want to go back to those days 'cause I like these days just fine. But it surely in fun to remember them! Donia\n\nI sailed on 3 Sitmar cruises. Two were to different parts of Caribbean and one to Mexican Riveria. All three were 10 nights. Cruising was much more expensive back in the early 80's and more elegant. The cabin stewards were much more interactive and the ones we had were funny, with great personalities. Every night before my mom and I went out one steward we had would knock on the door to see how \"my ladies\" look tonight. Then he would make a big fuss about how great we looked. While this may seem a bit too much, it really wasn't and we loved the attention. Very good looking, too I might add. He also left us a different towel animal every night. When we got back to the ship after a tour he would have tea and little sandwiches waiting for us. We were treated like royalty. Sitmar was just the best.\n\nKeeping all that in mind, that was then and this is now. Times are different. Cruising is much more affordable so that we can cruise much more often. I'll take that any day. Princess is not Sitmar--but it's a fantastic cruiseline. I was very disappointed when the two merged--but I don't feel that way now.\n\nLynda\n\nIn 1974 we took our then 9 month old daughter on a cruise from LA to mexico on the\n\nFairsky or Fairwind. I remember the room steward(ess) babysitting her in the evening so we could go out after putting her to bed. Like Donia, I remember all of the service staff and the service! The cruise, including airfare from Detroit to LA was $700 for all three of us (although I think my daughter was free). The reason I remember the cost is that it was such a bargain.\n\nWe cruised several more times on Sitmar and then Home Lines. I remember the deck stewards moving my chair (and it was MY CHAIR for the entire cruise--that's how to avoid chair hogs) to face the sun. I remember all of the tableside preparations. I also remember everything except liquor being included.\n\nWe used to cruise the second week in December and my memories of prices are in the $2000 range for 7 days for 2 people.\n\nI started sailing with Sitmar in 1974, I did several Caribbean and Mexico cruises on both the Fairwind & Fairsea. Also did 2 Panama Canal cruises - one was 17 days & the other 18 days. I was on the Fairsky Inaugral Season 11 day Mexican cruise and met my husband. We've just finish packing as we leave on the Sapphire Princess on Sunday. In my suitcase is my leather jewel case that I won on the Fairsea - still using it and every time I do it brings back a lot of good memories. We also have the poster we were given on that cruise framed and hanging in our home. Sitmar - when they heard we were getting married sent us a wonderful music box. It's a limited signed & numbered edition with \"Fairsky\" inlaid on the lid. The Captain's and crew of Sitmar were wonderful. There was never a problem. At that time I lived in Vancouver - the Fairsea did 2 week Alaska cruises out of San Francisco. They would arrive on Sunday afternoon and leave at midnight on Monday. Every second Monday we had a standing invitation for dinner. Captain Quartini would meet us at the gangway and escort us to the dining room where Mr. Longo would treat us to a wonderful meal. I could go on and on about the many memories I have but I might miss my next ship!\n\nSitmar was in it's Glory Days from 1978 to 1988 which was the tumultous birthing and adolescent youth of the cruise industry we know today. A. Vlasov was a visionary man rivaled only really by the Chandris Family in having a truly global view of the post war world and the quickening changes in the modes and styles of travel and vacationing. Sitmar, along with Home Lines, Holland America, and Sun Line were in a real niche market in those days and filled the gap between the high end lines of the day such as Royal Viking, Royal Cruise Line, and Norweigian American Line and the new mass market youths like Carnival, RCCL, NCL, and Princess who were competing fiercely with Costa, Chandris, and Epirotiki who pretty much had had what there was of the American cruise market to themselves for a number of years. Sitmar provided an on board product that was of high quality and very consistent on older BUT very comfortable vessels with quite spacious cabins, staterooms, and suites for the overall size of the vessels, providing fine service and dining at mid-price rates between the high end and the newbies.\" The all Italian crew provided the very best of service in a warm, friendly, and sincere manner and style. Home Line also provided the same warmth and fun with their Italian crews. Once the original Queen Mary and Elizabeth faded from the seas and cruising-which they very much helped to keep alive-the pax from the different classes on these vessels gravitated to the new lines that equated to that they had traveled in on the famed Queen Cunarders. This core of cruisers kept the market going until cruising was \"discovered\" and began to boom. I can remember being on a 29 day Trans-Atlantic-Mediterranean cruise on the Queen Mary in 1959 in Second Class with my Grandparents and Parents and then traveling with my parents in 1979 on the Fairsea on a 14 day Transcanal Cruise from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale and thinking how nice it was that vacationing at sea was still so gracious and fun but less formal and proper. Before my Dad died and Mom developed severe Osteoporosis and Alzheimer's, I was very fortunate to sail with them again to Alaska and Mexico on the Fairsea and the Carribbean on the Fairwind. I remember odd little things-the rolled towel pillows the pool stewards would make to fit the back of your neck in the deck chairs at the pool, the cups of Hot Chicken Soup served on Deck in Glacier Bay, the melodeous voices of the waiters in the dining room when they sang Happy Birthday to my Mom and placed the cake in front of her. The Costume Ball on the Caribbean Cruise, The Black 'n' White Ball through the Canal, and the Big Band Cruise to Mexico with the Russ Morgan Orchestra with so many of the passengers being dressed in clothing from the 1930'S and 1940'S. Yes, those were really wonderful cruises !\n\nI took a cruise on Sitmar's Fairsea with my 14 year old daughter in '82 then one by myself in 83'. It was my first cruises so maybe that is what made it so special. I do remember the crew were more interactive though. The officers would come up at night and dance with you. When we first got on the ship and was taken to our cabin I felt like I would get lost it was so big. I told my daughter we couldn't stay in our cabin for seven days so we went exploring. I do remember the cabin steward were more attentive. I still have some memorbilia from those days. A glass for being an pass passenger and scarf that says Sitmar. An set of menus fro the dinning room. I could go on but think this is enough. I also remember it was a lot more expensive.\n\nDelores\n\nAll these Sitmar comments brought back a lot of memories for me. It's really hard to compare Sitmar to Princess, as good as Princess is. The stewards lined up in their white jackets and gloves, waiting to take you to your cabin will not be forgotton. I laugh at myself when I remember my walking on the Celebrity Infinity -- they had a similar lineup of stewards and a man walking around with champagne greeting people. I was alone and there was a couple behind me; the hostess thought we were all together, and when I said I was alone, she pointed out to me where my room was. I guess the escorts were just for couples! What a quick turnoff -- I tried to not let it set the tone for my first Celebrity experience though. I have a good friend that I met on the Sitmar Fairsky back in 1987 that I still keep in touch with. He too agrees there is nothing out there even close to what Sitmar was. I felt the same disappointment when Carnival took over Princess that I had when Sitmar was bought out. I guess nothing is forever! Well, maybe except for the cocktail glasses they used to give you at the circolo party, and the free pictures of me with the captains of the various ships -- those have held up a pretty long time.\n\nIn the heyday of Sitmar, cruise lines and transatlantic and transpacific lines who did occasional cruises, were known for the nationality of their crews. For example, if you liked French food, decor, and service, you went on the French Line (CGT) or on Paquet. Thus, Sitmar belonged to the Italian tradition. Back in the '70s and '80s, it competed with Home Lines and the government-owned Italian Line for the same cruise market. Then, in the mid '70s, all of the government-owned shipping lines got out of the passenger business in the North American market, with the exception of Cunard. I remember the original gas crisis (much, much worse than what we are experiencing now), coupled with cheaper prices for transatlantic flights and the inability for the government lines to make a profit were given as reasons for the retirement of the French Line ships, the Italian Line ships, and the S.S. United States, to name a few. I remember standing on the dock in New York City and crying as the Italian Line's Michelangelo pulled away for the last time. (I had been on it twice, and I had friends on board the last voyage.) This left the Home Lines and Sitmar to those of us who wanted to feel like we were in Italy when we went to the Caribbean. I was very sad when Home Lines went out of business. But I said, \"Thank God, there is still Sitmar.\" Oh, well... When Sitmar was absorbed by Princess Cruises it was still very Italian, especially in the dining room. But, alas, even that beautiful touch is gone. I can't find any vestiges of the old Sitmar in Princess Cruises any more, but I still prefer Princess to the others. It feels like home.\n\nJoan"
