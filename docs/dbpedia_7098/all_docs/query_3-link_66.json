        "text": "Crew / Passenger Deaths\n\n(overboard) On May 3, 2024, a 27-year-old male crew was reported missing and presumed overboard while the ship was navigating in the Atlantic Ocean. An extensive onboard search was conducted after the man (Ison Dias, from Goa India) failed to report for duty soon after breakfast.\n\nThe ship immediately changed course and turned back, retracing the route to the AIS position where the man was last seen on CCTV (southwest of Port La Coruna and northwest of Vigo).\n\nA search and rescue operation was initiated. The ship contacted the Civil Guard/Spanish Coastguard requesting assistance. Later, the ship was released to continue the voyage. On May 4th, the Civil Guard called off the search. The body was not found.\n\nThe incident occurred at the end of the World Voyage 2024 (the 30-day itinerary segment from South Africa back to the UK/Cape Town to London-Tilbury), after the ship left Lisbon Portugal en route to Tilbury.\n\nShip Collision / Allision\n\nOn April 5, 2024, while maneuvering for docking in Cape Town Harbor (Port Cape Town, South Africa) the cruise ship made contact with Grey Fox (2011-built general cargo carrier/IMO 9594470), which was already moored at Berth B.\n\nThe collision was due to adverse weather/gale-force winds in the harbor and happened despite the assistance of two tugboats and a pilot who boarded the maneuvering vessels.\n\nFortunately, both vessels sustained only minor (hull) damages, without water ingress or pollution. Shortly after the occurrence, Ambassador Ambience managed safely to berth at the cruise terminal.\n\nPost-collision, the cruise ship received clearance for docking/berthing and was allowed to disembark passengers and crew by 08:45 local time (06:45 UTC).\n\nThe Transnet National Ports Authority (South African government corporation, subsidiary of Transnet that manages eight of the country's main marine ports), under Ophelia Shabane (Port Manager) confirmed the incident and started an investigation. Port operations remained unaffected and proceeded as planned.\n\nAmbassador Ambience left Port Cape Town as scheduled (at 23:00).\n\nThe accident occurred during the 120-day \"Ambiences 2024 Grand Round The World Cruise\" (itinerary January 6 - May 5) roundtrip from Tilbury-London, England, UK.\n\nStructural and Technical Issues\n\nRoutine inspections during the ship's drydock in 2023 (initially scheduled for November 18 through December 10) found that the propulsion system needed emergency repairs. Both propeller shafts and their stern bearings were damaged (by metal grinding) risking oil leaking/pollution.\n\nThe damaged parts (each propeller shaft is 20 m/66ft long and weighs 30+ tons) were shipped to a Danish company specializing in metal repairs.\n\nThe prolonged drydocking (conducted in Germany by Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH) affected the ship's remaining 2023 schedule. As a result, four voyages were canceled and Ambassador Cruise Line switched MS Ambience's schedule to MS Ambition.\n\nThe company explained its decision to swap ships announcing that for MS Ambience there were 6600+ bookings made for December, while for MS Ambition's 38-day Caribbean voyage (December 11-January 18, roundtrip from London), the bookings were ~800.\n\nNext are listed the canceled/rescheduled voyages in 2023.\n\n(Dec 10) 5-day \"German Christmas Markets (roundtrip from Tilbury-London to Hamburg and Amsterdam)\n\n(Dec 17) 4-day \"Festive Market Getaway (roundtrip from Tilbury-London to Amsterdam and Zeebrugge/Bruges)\n\n(Dec 21) 16-day \"Christmas New Year Voyage\" to the Canary Islands (roundtrip from Tilbury-London to Rotterdam, Lisbon, Funchal Madeira, Arrecife de Lanzarote, Santa Cruz de la Palma, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Leixoes/Oporto)\n\n(Dec 22) 16-day \"Christmas New Year Voyage\" (roundtrip from Rotterdam to Lisbon, Funchal, Arrecife, La Palma, Tenerife, Oporto, Tilbury)\n\nMS Ambiance was rescheduled to resume operations (Grand Around the World Cruise 2024) on January 6th (2024).\n\nStructural and Technical Issues\n\nOn April 12, 2023, while berthed at Port Cherbourg (France), Ambassador Ambience broke the mooring lines connecting the ship to the dock. As result, the ship nearly broke free, with the gangway (connecting to the dock) hanging from the starboard side.\n\nTo assist the vessel, tugboats were called in and the ship was safely secured at the berth. All passengers and crew remained on board. While no injuries were reported, the ship sustained damage to the starboard hull.\n\nAmbassador Ambience stayed in Cherbourg overnight (Apr 11th/17:35 to April 13th/7:11 UTC) and returned directly back to homeport Tilbury-London (England UK) arriving on Apr 14t hat 5:41 UTC). The scheduled call at Port Honfleur (France) was canceled.\n\nNote: The call at Cherbourg was due to stormy weather encountered while Ambience was en route from Cobh-Cork (Ireland) to Honfleur.\n\nStructural and Technical Issues\n\nDue to machinery/lifeboat issues, Ambassador Cruise Line canceled two MS Ambience cruises in December 2022.\n\nDue to a fault with the onboard lifeboat station, the 3-day \"Festive Market Getaway\" (Tilbury roundtrip itinerary Dec 18-21 visiting Zeebrugge-Bruges Belgium) was canceled and the ship remained docked in homeport Tilbury-London (England UK). As the company was unable to address the issues in Port Tilbury, Ambience departed the UK for drydocking in Germany (at Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH), conducted in the period Dec 20th - Jan 3 (2023).\n\nDue to the necessary drydock repairs, the next scheduled 15-day \"Christmas & New Year Canary Islands Cruise\" (Tilbury roundtrip itinerary Dec 21, 2022, thru Jan 5, 2023) was also canceled. This voyage included visits to La Coruna (Spain), Funchal (Madeira Island, Portugal), the Canaries ports Arrecife (Lanzarote), Santa Cruz de la Palma, and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, as well as Leixoes-Oporto (Portugal).\n\nStructural and Technical Issues\n\nOn March 25, 2022, Ambassador Cruise Line announced that the brand's inauguration and the Ambience ship's Maiden Voyage will be delayed. Christian Verhounig (company's CEO) commented that the cause was the Ukrainian crisis that affected the drydocking project (at Viktor Lenac Shipyard in Rijeka, Croatia).\n\nAs result, drydock works were hampered due to \"extensive supply chain disruption and delays in many commercial areas\", including a temporary lack of availability of MGO fuel (marine gas oil) in Croatia.\n\nThe Inaugural Cruise (roundtrip from homeport London-Tilbury to Hamburg) was rescheduled from April 6th to April 20th, and two Norwegian Fjords voyages were canceled. The canceled departures (roundtrips from the UK to Norway) included:\n\n(April 10-16) 6-day \"A Taste Of Fjordland\" (Tilbury to Haugesund, Flam, Bergen)\n\n(April 16-24) 8-day \"Majestic Easter Fjordland\" (Tilbury to Haugesund, Flam, Olden, Geiranger, Bergen)\n\nBooked customers were emailed and offered rebooking alternatives or a full refund.\n\nStructural and Technical Issues\n\n(MS Satoshi sold for scrapping in India) On December 18, 2020, the shipowner (Ocean Builders) announced that the \"Crypto Cruise Ship\" project is terminated and MS Satopshi sold for scrapping at India's Alang Ship Breaking Yard.\n\nIn an announcement sent to potential investors, Grant Romundt (Ocean Builders' CEO) wrote the company would not be able to proceed \"because of archaic big insurance companies that cannot adapt to innovative new ideas‚Äù. According to the statement, after a search for an insurance company (part of the 13 clubs of the International Group of P&I Clubs) to insure the vessel, Ocean Builders failed to find an insurer for MS Satoshi after the ship dropped anchor in Gulf of Panama. The closest they came was a deal for a USD 1 million insurance for a maximum of USD 5 million in coverage.\n\nNote: According to statistics, the Peek House London-based International Group of P&I Clubs provide P&I insurance (Protection and Indemnity) liability cover for ~90% of the global ocean-going tonnage.\n\nOcean Builders also requested from Authority Panama Maritime MS Satoshi to be considered a non-seagoing ship, to lessen the insurance premium burden by eliminating the need the vessel to comply with 32 of all 35 international maritime treaties signed by Panama as flag-state. However, the vessel was considered seagoing as it had engines and flag. Without insurance, the vessel can't be crewed, which means losing class rating, flag and any possibility of running any businesses onboard.\n\nOther Incidents\n\n(P&O Pacific Dawn sold to Ocean Builders) On September 29, 2020, P&O Australia announced the vessel's sale. The buyer (new shipowner) was not disclosed at the time. The liner was last refurbished (by P&O AU) in 2017 and scheduled for refurbishment in April 2021. Under P&O, Pacific Dawn sailed ~1,37 million mi (~2,2 M km) and served ~2 million passengers.\n\nA total of 14x Pacific Dawn cruise itineraries (departures planned for the period December 4 through February 11 including) were cancelled. For these last-scheduled by P&O AU voyages see at the ship's Wiki section.\n\nOther Incidents\n\n(CMV Amy Johnson) On July 20, 2020, CMV's parent company SQTL (South Quay Travel & Leisure Ltd) was placed into administration / filed for bankruptcy. The UK-based company traded as \"Cruise and Maritime Voyages\" (trademarked brand, aka CMV). As Joint Administrators (evaluating SQTL's financial position) were appointed Paul Williams, Phil Dakin and Edward Bines of Duff & Phelps Ltd.\n\nSQTL-CMV's cruisetour packages were protected by ABTA (number V9945). SQTL-CMV's fly-cruise packages are protected by ATOL (number 4619). All CMV cruise bookings (fleetwide/all ships) were effectively cancelled.\n\nIn June, SQTL-CMV entered into emergency talks with potential investors and lenders. Unfortunately, the company's efforts to secure funding and stay afloat during the Coronavirus crisis failed. The future of the CMV ships (some SQTL-owned, some chartered) remains unknown.\n\nBoat Rescue\n\n(P&O Pacific Dawn) On September 26, 2019, while en-route from Vanuatu back to Queensland Australia, the liner rescued 3 men stranded on a liferaft in the New Caledonian waters. The ship received a distress call from Noumea's marine rescue authorities and diverted to help the seafarers (2 Australians, 1 British). After their yacht started taking on water, the three sailors boarded a liferaft and became adrift in the Pacific Ocean. They were safely recovered by the ship and on Sept 28 offloaded in Brisbane QLD.\n\nThe incident occurred at the end of 7-day \"Pacific Island Hopper\" (itinerary Sept 21-28) roundtrip from homeport Brisbane to New Caledonia (Noumea, Lifou Island) and Vanuatu (Port Vila).\n\nCrew / Passenger Deaths\n\n(P&O Pacific Dawn / overboard) On April 12, 2018, at ~4 pm, a 47-year-old female passenger was reported overboard. The ship was in the Coral Sea, en-route from Port Vila (Vanuatu) back to homeport Brisbane (QLD Australia). It immediately turned around and started a search and rescue operation in adverse weather conditions (3-to-4-meter swells and high winds up to 55 kph / 35 mph). New Caledonian and Australian maritime authorities issued a distress call for nearby vessels to assist the liner, as the accident happened in shared between both countries sea zone.\n\nThe woman (Natasha Schofield, from Brisbane) went overboard when the liner was approx 300 km / 185 mi west of New Caledonia. Reportedly, while at the open deck, she felt seasick and leaned over the railing to vomit, but lost footing and fell overboard - allegedly \"thrown overboard\" by a rogue wave.\n\nHowever, when the CCTV footage was reviewed, it showed the woman didn't accidentally fall. She was talking to her husband on an open deck, then deliberately jumped off the ship. As she went over the railing, her husband tried to grab her by the legs, but it was too late. On April 13, at 7:30 am the search was called off. The body was never found.\n\nThe accident occurred on 7-day \"Pacific Island Hopper Cruise\" (itinerary April 7-14) roundtrip from Brisbane to New Caledonia (Noumea, Lifou Island) and Vanuatu (Port Vila).\n\nCrew / Passenger Crimes\n\n(P&O Pacific Dawn / sexual) On December 6, 2017, a male crew was reported and arrested for sexual assault (raping) of a female co-employee on Pacific Dawn. The man (Noel Isaac, from Vanuatu) trespassed into her cabin in the morning (shortly before disembarkation in Port Vila). Despite her pleas, he overcame the victim's resistance through force. Without her consent, he had full and forcible sexual intercourse with the woman.\n\nThe victimized woman started working on the liner in early-December 2017. She didn't return to her job (in the galley/ship kitchen) and left P&O Cruises Australia due to the assault. She reported the rape to local police. Crime investigation was initially halted as the police had to wait for the cruise ship's next port call to obtain CCTV footage.\n\nThe man denied the crime, but CCTV evidence showed him entering the victim‚Äôs cabin and remaining inside hidden for about 40 min.\n\n(law news) A Vanuatu court found the man guilty of \"sexual intercourse without consent\" and on December 4, 2018, he was sentenced to 5 years and 8 months in jail.\n\nCrew / Passenger Deaths\n\n(P&O Pacific Dawn) On June 20, 2016, an 11-year-old male passenger (of Australian origin) was reported in critical condition after a shore excursion accident. The boy was injured in a head-on bus crash in Port Vila (Vanuatu). Another 10 (out of 12) Australian cruise ship tourists were also seriously injured during the collision. All injured passengers were airlifted to Brisbane (Australia) and Noumea (New Caledonia) to receive urgent medical treatment. The bus crash killed 2 locals (Ni-Vanuatu people).\n\nDue to the incident, the ship missed its next call port Mystery Island in order to arrive as scheduled back in Brisbane. The ship was on 11-day South Pacific Islands cruise (itinerary June 14-25) from homeport Brisbane to Champagne Bay, Pentecost Island, Vila, Mystery Island (skipped), Isle of Pines.\n\nCruise Illness / Virus Outbreaks\n\n(P&O Pacific Dawn) On May 25, 2009, after docking in Sydney Harbour, the ship reported a total of 170 passengers (out of 2000) with flu-like symptoms. Among the infected were two 5-year-old boys tested positive for H1N1 (Swine flu virus). On the next day, another 14 passengers were tested positive with Swine flu. NSW Health authorities ordered all passengers to stay for 7 days locked at home (self-imposed quarantine).\n\nNote: When the itinerary doesn‚Äôt include US cruise ports, the ship is not required to report to CDC, thus no official illness report would be issued.\n\nCrew / Passenger Injuries and Overboards\n\n(P&O Pacific Dawn / overboard) On January 13, 2009, an Australian news media reported a 22-year-old male passenger jumped overboard. The incident occurred at 5 am, while the ship was approx 20 ml (30 km) off Port Vila, Vanuatu. The young man (reportedly drunk) was successfully rescued within ~45 min. His jumping was seen by a staff member and the alarm was raised. The vessel was cruising at half-speed but was able to stop and then use its bow thrusters to turn around (without having to complete a loop to turn around).\n\nShip Grounding\n\n(MS Regal Princess) On February 18, 2007, while on a Panama Canal transition cruise and after a short stop at call port Huatulco Mexico the vessel ran aground. The accident was due to high winds causing it to list 5 degrees starboard and make contact with the seabed portside while backing out of Huatulco Harbor.\n\nThe grounding damaged one of the ballast tanks. The ship soon freed itself and continued to Acapulco Mexico at reduced speed and severely listing to starboard. In Acapulco, the current cruise was canceled and all passengers were flown home.\n\nThe next 2 scheduled itineraries (departures Feb 21 and March 1) were also canceled due to the needed drydock repairs. The ship left Acapulco on Feb 22. The next scheduled cruise was on March 13 (itinerary from Lima Peru to San Juan Puerto Rico).\n\nCruise Illness / Virus Outbreaks\n\n(MS Regal Princess) In September 2003, CDC reported on itinerary Aug 18 to Sept 2, an epidemic Norovirus outbreak (gastrointestinal illness) infected 301 passengers (out of 1557, or 19,3%) and 45 crew (out of 687, or 6,6%). All sick suffered from Norovirus symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps) and were quarantined to their cabins for 48 hours.\n\nThe ship was on 16-day Transatlantic repositioning cruise from Europe to USA (Copenhagen to NYC New York). It arrived in NYC 2 days early after missing 2 scheduled call ports in Greenland and Newfoundland Canada."
