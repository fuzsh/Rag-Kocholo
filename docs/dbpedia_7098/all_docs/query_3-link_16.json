        "text": "The port of New York got a vote of confidence yesterday from a West Coast steamship line when Sitmar Cruises announced that it would begin cruise service from New York harbor to South America.\n\nThe line's 25,000‐ton, white‐hulled Fairwind, with a passenger capacity of 830, is scheduled to make her maiden voyage from the city's new marine passenger terminal at 50th Street and the Hudson River on May 14, departing on a 24‐day tour to Lima, Peru, according to J. P. Bland, the company's president. He spoke yesterday at a luncheon of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nHe added that he hoped more cruises would follow if the cruise became popular.\n\n“Sitmar is the first line to come in here in years that is truly a nationally oriented steamship line,” said Edward R. Peters, an official of the Port Authority's Marine Terminals Department.\n\nThe Port Authority has been negotiating with the Los Angeles‐based company, which has operated ships from California and Florida since 1971, for about a year on running a cruise out of New York.\n\nThe line said that it hoped to attract far more than New Yorkers on its sailing and that it had begun advertising the cruise in 114 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Under Sitinar's “air/sea” plan, air fare from any destination would be free, the same package rate applying to passengers joining the ship from either Albany or St. Louis, for instance, Mr. Bland said.\n\nLater yesterday afternoon, officials of the company met with First Deputy Mayor John E. Zuccotti and Deputy Mayor Osborn Elliott who greeted the venture with enthusiasm.\n\n“One thing that pleases me very much,” said Mr. Zuccotti about Sitmar's move, “is that much of the promotion stresses all aspects of the city in terms of tourism. In promoting their tour, they're promoting New York.”\n\nPassage on the Fairwind, which began in 1955 as the Cunard liner Sylvania and was rebuilt in 1970 at a cost of $20 million, will range from $1,695 to $3,395. The 608‐foot ship has five nightclubs and 330‐seat theater.\n\n“I have to get quite excited about this,” said Anthony J. Tozzoli, director of Marine Terminals at the Port Authority, about the cruise, which comes at a time when passenger ship sailings from the harbor have declined dramatically in recent"
