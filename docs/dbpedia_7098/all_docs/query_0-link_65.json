        "text": "SHIP PROFILE\n\nSilversea Cruises\n\nMV Silver Shadow\n\nRating:\n\nSubmit your review here\n\nOperator: Silverseas Cruises\n\nYear Built / Last Refurbished: 2000\n\nLength / Tonnage: 597 / 25,000\n\nNumber of Cabins / Passengers: 194 / 388\n\nOfficers / Crew: Italian / International\n\nOperating Area: Worldwide\n\nAnybody who loved Sitmar Cruises before they were swallowed up by their competitor Princess cheered when, in the early 1990s, an annoncement was made that they might be making a come back. The Vlasov group, owners of Sitmar, felt that it was time to re enter the passenger carrying business....but this time, it was their intention to introduce a fleet of ultra luxe vessels. Calling themselves Silversea Cruises, they closely studied their future competitors....Seabourn, Royal Viking, Cunard and Sea Goddess. They recognized that there was a choice that prospective passengers had to make....either take a small all suite ship and forfeit a well rounded cruise experience, i.e. shows, lounges, deck space....or select something like the ROYAL VIKING SUN....which from the beginning was something of a lemon among many experienced cruisers. And so the not too big, not too small SILVER CLOUD and SILVER WIND were born....and almost instantly, they had the other lines running to the drawing boards to see how they could improve their products and give Silversea a run for the money.\n\nSilversea made lots of friends quickly....with their sensible all inclusive rates, interesting itineraries, and well thought out ships. We urge you to get a copy of their current brochure....it's the prettiest cruise folder we've seen in the North American market in the last decade! But as lovely as this booklet is, do the pretty words they use in it accurately describe what it's like to travel Silversea? For the most part, yes. There are just a couple of oh so minor lapses in attention to detail....but nothing significant enough to make us assign less than five stars to these dreams at sea.\n\nUpon arriving in Silver Shadow's Reception Foyer, a white-gloved attendant extends to you a flute of chilled Moët & Chandon. Drink in the atmosphere of elegance and style that is captured in warm honey-spiced woods and chestnut-, umber- and ebony-hued marbles. A crystal chandelier casts a soft light upon the room's intimate Italian furnishings including groupings of snug wing-backed chairs. Everywhere the spirit of conviviality moves you from the Reception, Concierge and Shore Excursion Desks to the offices of the Hotel Director and Cruise Consultant. A hub of activity, the Reception Foyer is the portal to the ship's eleven decks of brilliance, your home around the world.\n\nJust forward of the Reception Foyer awaits The Casino. Inspired by the grand casino of Monte Carlo, this gaming room is decorated in bold, winning hues. Crimson curtains are draped across a wall of windows. Coordinating fabrics cover cushy chairs. A contemporary chandelier and gaming tables dominate the center of the room while electronic gaming machines are tucked into alcoves to soften their lights and noise. The result of all this planning is a room that is playful and sophisticated where nothing is left to chance.\n\nThe winsome atmosphere of the Casino likewise is carried into the adjoining Casino Bar. Here, ebony leather stools circle a handsome cherry wood bar. Comfortable chairs and smart Italian sofas are nestled together inviting friendly conversations. Day or night, the Casino Bar welcomes shoppers from the nearby Shopping Arcade or \"piazza.\"\n\nJust as a home is a reflection of its owners, so too, each Silversea suite is a reflection of its guests. Fashionable, sophisticated, confident. An unprecedented 82% of suite accommodations feature a wall of glass that opens onto a private teak veranda while other suites graciously frame the sea with a five foot panoramic picture window.\n\nThe sizable Health Club and Spa wholly occupy Deck 10. The restorative mood of the Health Club and Spa is reflected in cool colors associated with the life upon the sea. Tiles the color of the ocean and sky blend with carpets the color of blonde Tahitian beaches. Doors of blue-frosted glass lead to relaxing reed-colored private massage rooms. Incandescent lighting coupled with soft amber uplighting casts a sunrise-like effect across ceilings and down corridors. Light woods and flax-woven fabrics continue the Spa's aquatic allure.\n\nVirtually everything necessary to achieve a sound mind and body is available on Deck 10. In association with the acclaimed Mandara Spa, Silversea offers a complete menu of restorative body therapies that combine exotic Indonesian traditions with classic international therapies. Coiffeurs and cosmetologist are available in the Hair and Beauty Salon. The Aerobics and Fitness Center offer circuit weights, state-of-the-art treadmills, stair climbers and stationary bicycles. Private changing rooms for men and women are directly connected to four private treatment rooms, allowing for ease of movement between areas. Additionally, the changing facilities also feature steam rooms and dry saunas.\n\nLocated forward of The Spa, the Observation Lounge spans the bow of the ship commanding a Captain's-eye view of the world. Designed for socializing with friends after a workout, the Lounge cradles guests in broad easy chairs. A map table, current books and magazines provide entertaining diversions while a sparkling wall of glass that follows the curve of the ship's bow affords views without boundaries.\n\nDuring the afternoon, the Lounge features a self-service water and juice bar. During the evening, the Lounge converts into a full-service bar making it a unique venue for private functions and cocktail parties.\n\nThe Pool Deck is focused on a single central swimming pool and dance floor. Forward of the pool, under a shady edge from the deck above, is a full-service bar and barbecue for grilling noonday meals. Both bar and barbecue are detailed in mosaic tiles and circled by contemporary stainless steel and teal leather stools. Two whirlpool tubs are located to the rear of the pool; each is elevated and topped by a canvas structure. Teak tables and chairs with canvas umbrellas surround the pool's port and starboard sides. Teak decking and green outdoor carpeting keep walking areas cool for bare feet.\n\nThe pool is open to the above Sky Deck. Sunbathers will appreciate the ample number of adjustable lounge chairs with attached headrests. A jogging track runs the entire outside edge of the deck. Additionally, a traditional shuffleboard area can be found far aft.\n\nThe stylish Shopping Arcade features the bold jewelry and elegant accessories of Bvlgari. The epitome of contemporary Italian style, Bvlgari offers some of the world's finest jewelry, accessories, perfumes and body products in trademark boutiques aboard Silversea ships. In fact, the first ever sea-going Bvlgari boutique opened aboard Silver Cloud and is now exclusively featured aboard each ship in Silversea's fleet. Silver Shadow proudly continues the tradition.\n\nThe Computer Center and Library are conveniently located aft-ship between the Pool and the Panorama Lounge on Deck 8. Four computer stations and one lap-top station with Internet access are available to guests anytime of the day or night. Also available are hundreds of books from the classics to best-sellers to current travel guides. A complete collection of National Geographic magazines is available on CD-ROM as well. Additionally, guests may select from a wide variety of video movies to take home and watch in their suite. The decor of the Computer Center and Library compliment those used in the Panorama Lounge. Light woods, indigo carpets, sea grass-colored walls and silk curtains speak of the overall nautical charm.\n\nThe Conference and Card Rooms occupy a quiet niche forward of The Humidor on Deck 7. Each room is connected to one another with a moveable wall and may be used together or separately as needed. Both rooms are furnished with moveable chairs and table for flexibility. The Card Room specifically features tables with felt on one side. Both rooms feature an entertainment cabinet with a television, videocassette player and a small refrigerator for refreshments. In the Conference Room, the cabinet also contains audio-visual equipment including a roll-down screen as well as flip- and white-boards for conference use.\n\nThe color scheme harmonizes with the ship with light, creamy walls and warm wood accents. Damask draperies are cool blue with colors repeated in the carpet and the felt on the card tables. The same cool blue dots furniture upholstery which is predominately ocher and wheat.\n\nThe spirit of conviviality sparkles during a Silversea night thanks in part to a philosophy that guests never need worry about paying for drinks. Throughout Silver Shadow, select wines, champagnes and spirits are generously poured.\n\nA genteel club crafted in the style of a traditional English smoking club, The Humidor by Davidoff, features the club's namesake cigars as well as other exceptional hand-rolled smokes. Centered around a sybaritic atmosphere, The Humidor features rich wood floors, Prussian-blue draperies and handsome wool rugs. Deep gallery chairs and soft settees further ignite the romance of relaxing with a slow, even-burning cigar. Guests may choose from Davidoff cigars or select from a robust variety of premium brands from a fully stocked walk-in humidor.\n\nDecorative French doors lead from The Humidor to an intimate wine bar. Designed for tastings and social gatherings, Le Champagne features the complimentary cuveé of Moët & Chandon along with a deep cellar of acclaimed vintners. Stone and wood detailing give the room its personality along with a palette of colors that coordinate with those found in The Humidor. Distinguished artwork adorning the walls also distinguishes this as a genteel retreat.\n\nAt the turn of the century, the social elite gathered around handsome bars in the world's most elegant hotels. From New York City to Paris to Hong Kong, deals were signed, fortune were made and social circles were formed at these venerable gathering places. It is with that same spirit of convivial milieu that inspires The Bar aboard Silver Shadow.\n\nA central bar commands the focus of the room, accented by a modern burnished metallic bar front. A wall behind the bar sinuously curves drawing eyes to a coordinating abstract mural. The dramatic detail is further enhanced by curtains of velvety garnet and emerald. Coordinating fabrics adorn deep club chairs and ample barstools. Plush carpets contrast a mahogany-stained dance floor and stage designed for a jazz ensemble. The perfect gathering spot after dinner or before a show, The Bar is located forward of the Athenian Show Lounge.\n\nLocated rear on Deck 5, the Athenian Show Lounge is a multi-tiered music hall cleverly designed to give each guest the best seat in the house. Seats are fashioned after traditional high-backed, theater-style chairs. Each row of seats is dotted with small tables to hold complimentary cocktails served during the shows.\n\nA wonderful escape from noon to well past midnight, the Panorama Lounge is thoughtfully designed to reflect the curves of the elegant nautilus shell. Circular forms in the floor and ceiling along with a curved bar further echo the shell's contours. Light woods, indigo carpets, sea grass-colored walls and silk curtains carry through the nautical charm of the room.\n\nLocated far aft on Deck 8, the Lounge also features a sweeping wall of curved glass that looks out to the sea. The perfect perch from which to watch the sun rise, guests gather here to enjoy a light continental breakfast by dawn's first light. Later in the day, guests take a seat in serene occasional chairs for afternoon tea, served with sweet cakes, petite fours and soothing piano music. When the night falls, the music rises transforming the Lounge into a nightclub.\n\nOne of the highlights of Silversea's dining experience is an open-seating policy that allows guests to dine with the companions of their choice at the time they prefer. The true hallmark, however, is the uncommon cuisine. European-trained waiters  hand picked from the finest hotels and restaurants  serve repasts prepared from a gallery of award-winning Master Chefs including celebrity guests chefs on select culinary cruises.\n\nThe romance of a \"grand entrance\" is rekindled in The Restaurant. Upon entering the formal hall, guests are met with a sensational view that extends over the dance floor towards the dramatic glasswork art on the far wall. Varying ceiling heights afford The Restaurant even greater depth and grandeur. This cleaver thinking allows the main floor level to remain constant allowing guests to easily move about from table to table.\n\nLocated mid-ship on Deck 4, The Restaurant is crowned by three grand chandeliers. High-backed cherry wood chairs and table lamps nestle tables together in cozy seating groups in the room's center. Rich blue damask drapes ornament walls of windows. Coordinating carpets and upholstery in warm earthen tones blend with generous wood floors, marble and granite-topped waiter stations. Crisp Frette tablecloths adorn tables suited for two to six guests. Christofle Silverware flanks fine porcelain china emblazoned with the signature Silversea logo. And a banquet of crystal European stemware and goblets reflect the glow of candles centered on the table.\n\nThe aft location of this indoor/outdoor Café allows for 180°degree views of the horizon. A wall of floor to ceiling windows brings the outdoors to inside tables suited for two to six. Patina- and ocher-hued upholstery and drapes reflect the colors of the sea. Off-white wallcoverings and honey-colored parquet floors are accented by a central ceiling element of backbit glass. The result is a sunny café plucked from the sidewalks of Monte Carlo. The far, port-side corner of the Café features a buffet station serving hot and cold breakfast and lunch favorites. Doors at the far, starboard corner lead to the adjoining wine bar, Le Champagne Bar by Moët & Chandon. While automatic doors in the aft wall of glass open onto the sunny terrace. Here, a half-dozen tables, seating six to eight guests, offer alfresco dining under a fixed, shady canvas.\n\nThe Terrace Café offers the same classic Silversea dining experience as the Restaurant but in a more casual setting. By day, hearty buffets and grilled fare highlight the menu. Evenings options, however, accent Italian, French and Asian specialties diligently served by friendly waiters.\n\nA sense of comfort dwells in the 345 square foot Veranda Suite. Vibrant fabrics blend with rich honey-spiced maple cabinetry. Curtains separate the queen-sized bed from the sitting area that includes two chairs and table for in-suite dining plus a sofa. A refrigerator, direct dial telephone, writing desk and television with satellite reception plus a videocassette player complete the living area. The marbled bathroom showcases a double vanity, full-sized bath tub and separate shower plus a direct-dial phone. The walk-in closet features a personal safe. Some Veranda Suites accommodate three guests with a sofa that folds into a full-sized bed.\n\nSimilarly, the Vista Suite offers the same comforts of the Veranda Suite but without the 58 square foot veranda. Instead, a five foot panoramic window frames the sea. The Vista Suite measures 287 square feet accordingly.\n\nThe mid-sized Medallion and Silver Suites are perhaps the most popular accommodations. Measuring 521 and 701 square feet respectively, each suite is fashioned similarly to the Veranda Suite, but offers larger separate living rooms for entertaining friends and more spacious verandas.\n\nDesigned in part by input from guests, the Medallion Suite fills the niche between the Veranda and Silver Suites giving guests more mid-sized accommodations to enjoy.\n\nThe largest and most stately accommodations, the Owner's, Grand and Royal Suites range from 1,208 to well over 1,435 square feet. These spacious, light-filled suites open out towards the sea with multiple verandas. Decorative columns and artfully sand-blasted glass screens creatively separate living quarters from bedrooms. Artful lighting techniques enhance the element of drama. Natural cherry wood frames built-in cabinetry and furniture, each accented with darker wood inlays and detail. Additional amenities for these special suites include a plasma-screen television and a private bar. Fabrics of ivory, flax, blue, soft saffron and cayenne dance elegantly in bedspreads, upholstery and draperies. Each of these suites can be reserved in a one- or two-bedroom configuration, sleeping up to six quite comfortably.\n\nWith per day prices running six, seven, eight hundred dollars or more...per person....Silversea can not attract those on a strict budget. But money does not make the man...or woman...so you will see passengers with all manners of breeding....on sailings when the young ones are out of school, you might find a few families....but there are few diversions for kids on these ships....and passengers have forked over quite an amount of money to be here, so they're not likely to look kindly on children who cannot be controlled....unruly children are rarely the recipients of unstinting praise.\n\nDuring the summer of this year you will find the Silver Shadow in Europe sailing along the Italian Riviera and through the Greek Isles. In the fall she heads to the orient and stays there until the holidays. In early December she heads to Sydney, Australia and spends the next three months sailing the waters of the South Pacific. In March she heads back to Singapore and then on to India and the Middle East before arriving in the Mediterranean in April. She spends the next six months cruising the Mediterranean and Baltic before crossing to New York. After a couple of fall foliage cruises she heads to Florida and the on to South America for the holidays.\n\nBack in the \"overview\" section of this review, I mentioned that there are just a couple of nit picky things about Silversea that they should address....sometimes, if you order caviar, you'll be served the similar looking Danish lumpfish....and that's a no no. The other problem is the shore excursion program. This was a major stumbling block the line had when they began service....but each season, these optional forays into the ports improve....nonetheless, \"the Silversea Experience\", a selected shore trip that is included in your fare on some sailings, is often more a non event than anything....no one would seriously consider a Silversea trip based on the quality or lack thereof of a shore excursion....but the memories of these little things sometimes stay with us longer than we would like. Everything else on the Silver Shadow is top drawer, first rate, spiffy. I'm certain you'll agree with me."
