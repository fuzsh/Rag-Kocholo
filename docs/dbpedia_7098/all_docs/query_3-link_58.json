        "text": "ships > Silversea\n\nSilversea Cruise Line\n\nSilversea is a cruise company reflecting generations of maritime and travel experience. In the early 1990s, the Lefebvre family of Rome, former owners of Sitmar Cruises, conceived and organized a unique cruise company pledging to build and operate the highest-quality ships in the ultra-luxury segment. The name âSilverseaâ was chosen because it connotes quality and luxury as well as capturing the romance and special sensations of the sea.\n\nSilversea Fleet\n\nSilver Cloud Silver Whisper Silver Shadow Silver Wind Silver Spirit Silver Explorer\n\n(formerly Prince Albert II) Silver Discoverer Silver Galapagos\n\nSilversea Cruises is recognized as an innovator in the luxury segment, offering guests large-ship amenities aboard its intimate, all-suite vessels: Silver Spirit, Silver Cloud, Silver Wind, Silver Shadow, Silver Whisper- all designed to offer an atmosphere of conviviality and casual elegance. With the addition of the regal expedition ship Silver Explorer (formerly Prince Albert II), the company's itineraries encompass all seven continents.\n\nHistory\n\nSilversea Launched its first ship, Silver Cloud in 1994, followed by Silver Wind in 1995, Silver Shadow in 2000 and the newest ship Silver Whisper in 2001. The fleet was purpose-built for the ultra-luxury market, establishing a new class of smaller, intimate vessels that could slip into more exotic ports off the beaten path. These elite vessels were specifically designed for fewer guests, more space and the highest levels of personalized service, delivered by mainly Italian and other European officers overseeing an international staff. All-ocean view suites, most with private veranda, and open seating dining options so guests dine when, where and with whom they desire, add to the very special ambiance created onboard. But what is also unique is that they incorporate the favorite amenities found on larger ships, such as an elaborate show lounge featuring nightly entertainment, casino, spa and state-of-the-art fitness facility.\n\nThe company's first expedition ship, Prince Albert II, debuted in June 2008, heralding the beginning of a new mode in exploration cruising -- where an ultra-luxurious ambiance is just as important as an exotic and enriching itinerary.\n\nSilversea caters to the cosmopolitan world traveler and maintains branch offices in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore. The company's headquarters are based in Monaco.\n\nBack to the top\n\nWi-Fi and Internet\n\nAll Silversea ships are equipped to offer wireless (Wi-Fi) Internet access. You can use your own laptop to surf the Internet and check emails at Wi-Fi locations throughout the ship, or from the comfort and privacy of your suite. Computers, email and Internet access are also available on board at the Internet CafÃ©. However, telecommunication services while at sea are via satellite. Therefore, onboard Internet access is not guaranteed at all times. Satellite communications are also affected by weather and the ship's location.\n\nIn particular, Internet service is extremely sporadic while in the Arctic. Guests aboard expedition cruises to/from Svalbard should be prepared to be out of communication for the duration of their time on board. (Please be assured that Silver Explorer always has emergency communication capabilities.)\n\nWhether accessing the Internet via your own laptop computers or via the Internet CafÃ© computers, the same rates apply. All charges are posted directly to your onboard account. No credit is given for unused Time Plan minutes. Rates shown are in US dollars and are subject to change.\n\nBasic Rate: $0.50 per minute (pay as you go)\n\nTime Plan 1: 100 minutes for $45 ($0.45 per minute)\n\nTime Plan 2: 250 minutes for $85 ($0.34 per minute)\n\nTime Plan 3: 1000 minutes for $250 ($0.25 per minute)\n\nThere is onboard mobile phone service that enables you to make and receive phone calls, text messages and other select data services on your mobile phone even when miles away from land. Your mobile phone service provider will bill you for calls and/or messages, which may appear as roaming charges. Please note that mobile phone service is sporadic at best while in the Arctic. Guests aboard voyages to/from Svalbard should be prepared to be out of communication for the duration of their time on board."
