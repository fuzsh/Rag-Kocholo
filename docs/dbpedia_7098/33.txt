LONDON -- The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. announced Thursday it acquired the entire share capital of the Los Angeles operation of Sitmar Cruises for $210 million.

The purchase includes Sitmar's existing four-ship cruise fleet along with three new, large cruise ships currently under construction - one in the French yard of Chantiers de l'Atlantique, St. Nazaire, and two in the Italian yard of Fincantieri, Trieste.

The three new ships are being built to the same luxury standards of P. and O.'s Royal Princess.

The new French built ship, weighing 63,000 tons, is due for delivery in 1989 and the Italian ships, each 70,000 tons, in 1990 and 1991.

Sitmar's fourth ship is based in Sydney, Australia, where the company is market leader.

'This acquisition follows a three-year restructuring of the group's cruise interests and positions P. and O. well in the fast growing international cruise market with a modern fleet to take advantage of P. and O.'s traditional strengths,' said Jeffrey Sterling, chairman of P. and O.

Sitmar's cruise operation will enhance the five-ship fleet of P. and O.'s subsidiary Princess cruises, also based in Los Angeles, he said. The combined North American fleet will be marketed under the Princess brand.
