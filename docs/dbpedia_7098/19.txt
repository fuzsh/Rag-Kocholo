Crystal Cruises has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Fincantieri, a renowned Italian shipbuilder, to construct two new ships!

“This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family that started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and now is flourishing again with Crystal,” said Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, Executive Chairman of A&K Travel Group.
