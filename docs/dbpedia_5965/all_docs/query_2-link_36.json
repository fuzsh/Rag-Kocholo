        "text": "Donât get me wrong, this is a great game but itâs pretty easy most of the time. As soon as youâve unlocked all the rooms thereâs not much else to do apart from finishing quests and getting recipes. I know the devs are busy on other projects but thereâs so much potential for this game to be bigger. Such as adding in new rooms like a pet daycare to train pets and raise their stats, different types of production rooms that utilize some stats like Endurance and Charisma for producing crafting materials, maybe even a monitoring room where you can designate and create specific teams of dwellers. Adding new dialogue or even giving the overseer the ability to interact personally with dwellers to raise happiness. Adding more variety to incidents and attacks like radiation leaks or bloatfly infestations. Even giving fun seasonal events and limited time weapons/outfits. Itâs a great game to begin with but not a whole lot of work has been keeping it up to date. Even if it means whole new sequel like Fallout settlement where you can build different houses and buildings would be amazing, yâall have a great thing going here. Donât let time and lack of care reduce this game to just another app taking up space.\n\nI have had a few problems with trying to move dwellers and the camera/movement wigs out making it difficult to swap them around, heck even adding to where we can search items and dwellers by name would be fantastic\n\nWhy the 4/5 stars? The game is great, but, it doesnât hit the key points it shouldâve. I see many people complaining about the 200 cap and how it crashes because of so much going on. Although annoying, it was expected. Itâs a mobile game, itâs not going to be perfect. Something they can add that will be PERFECT, is a rebuild mode where you can rearrange everything that you already have built, like in Clash of Clans, where you can rearrange your base all over again like itâs nothing. This problem is becoming bigger because we might not like how our layout is because of some stupid placement we did when we first started. For the love of god I donât know if anyone else has this problem or if there is a fix but I donât know it, but dragging dwellers from outside to the bottom is extremely annoying because it glitches so hard, if I can have the option to just click them from room to room instead of dragging thatâd be great. Quests, the only part that keeps me going, add more, thatâs it, just add more. Other than that weâll see where it goes. And hopefully, if ever, some type of multiplayer, maybe to quest, maybe to trade, give limited amounts of supplies or whatever. Multiplayer isnât fallout it but he got mobile why not or at least be able to do that between your own vaults would be nice too, just like settlements in Fallout. Great game overall, just keep adding things for us to come back too. Thanks for taking the time to read this."
