        "text": "Eldar Ryazanov, a pupil of Grigorii Kozintsev and Ivan Pyryev, debuted with the musical Vesennie Golosa/ Spring Voices, the blueprint for his satirical musical comedies Karnavalnaya Noch/ Carnival Night (1956), starring Igor Ilyinsky, Devushka Bez Adresa/ Girl without Address (1957), and Gusarskaya Ballada/ Hussar Ballad (1962).\n\nHe also made Chelovek Niotkuda/ Man from Nowhere (1961), but perhaps this satire was one too many because it was basically banned.\n\nThe hits were followed by Gusarskaia Ballada/ Husar Ballad (1962), set during the 1812 Napoleonic invasion, Daite Zhalobnuiu Knigu/ Hand Me the Complaint Book (1964), another hit, and Beregis' Avtomobilia/ Watch Out for the Automobile (1966), another hilarious satire scripted by Emil Braginsky.\n\nHis farces became more trivial: Zigzag Udachi/ Zigzag of Luck (1968) and Starikirazboiniki/ Old Men Robbers (1972) and the Italian co-production Neveroiatnye Prikliucheniia Italiantsev v Rossii/ The Unbelievable Adventures of Italians in Russia (1974).\n\nLeonid Gaidai was his only rival during the Brezhnev period.\n\nIroniia Sudby ili S Legkim Parom/ Irony of Fate or Have a Good Sauna (1975) is a musical fairy tale originally made for television and based on a popular theatrical production.\n\nHe turned to a more romantic theme with Sluzhebnyi Roman/ An Office Romance (1978), another hit, before finding again his top satirical form in Garazh/ The Garage (1979), scripted again by Braginsky and starring Innokenty Smoktunovsky, and Vokzal Dlya Dvoikh/ Train Station for Two (1983), scripted again by Emil Braginsky, starring Liudmila Curchenko, Oleg Basilashvili and Nikita Mikhalkov is a sentimental love story that contains a satire of the black market economy,\n\nZhestokii Romans/ A Cruel Romance (1984) was an adaptation of Aleksandr Ostrovsky's play \"Bespridannitsa/ Without Dowry\", starring Nikita Mikhalkov."
