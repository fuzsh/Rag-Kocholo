        "text": "I really liked this film -- I laughed all the way! I liked the first short story the best, which is about a nerdy student Shurik and a tough criminal Fedya who work together in a building site. They are like Tom and Jerry: Tom is he stronger one, but he is constantly made fun of by his seemingly weaker enemy. In this film, I remembered the two chasing each other in the shabby residential building, and Fedya's whole body burned dark or poured with flour. Once I think about it, it almost feels like an irritating racial allusion. But of course most of political significance of this film derives from its unusual subject. It reminds us of how the Soviet society is spoiled by \"alcoholics and hooligans\" and how these people actually participated in the socialist construction of new metropolises.\n\nThis feature actually consists of three half-hour-long story lines one after another, related only in that they all star the same hapless protagonist. I read somewhere that the director took Charlie Chaplin as a model for his comedy, and the influence shows here, even to the point of the short-subject-length segments -- and especially in the first story. That one is basically a pure slapstick comedy, drawing gags from the situation of the Sharik character (who actually ends up resembling Harold Lloyd in appearance and behavior more than Chaplin) working part time on a construction site, alongside the man who he caused to be working there as a sentence.\n\nThe second segment is the one I thought to be the greatest success, as it combines the visual humor (many sequences of which, throughout, would work without dialogue at all) with a well-tuned funny situation and good actor chemistry. The third and titular segment is amusing as well, but perhaps get a little too involved in its own story.\n\nOverall, it's funny material and recreates well what made the silent comedies of the short-subject era funny, if without the inspiration of an actual Chaplin on set.\n\nMy first time watching a Soviet film and I enjoyed it. It was certainly unique and unlike anything I have watched before; despite reminding me a little of other comedies. Mr Bean, Chaplin, The Monkees - these all came to mind at moments during the film.\n\nOf course, 'Operation Y and Other Shurik's Adventures' is incredibly \"Russian\" too and showcases some of that unique Russian humour. It actually feels more like 3 episodes, as opposed to an actual movie. It works though, and the runtime flies by quickly as a result.\n\nEach segment features the main character Shurik getting himself in various predicaments. It's 100% slapstick. Not all the humour translated across to this Australian viewer, but I still laughed out loud more than once.\n\nBy far the best 'segment' is the middle one titled \"Deja Vu\". It felt ahead of its time and was incredibly intelligent. A wonderful showcase of slapstick comedy that makes it worth the watch alone."
