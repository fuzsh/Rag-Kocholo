        "text": "Soviet and Russian film director, screenwriter, poet, actor and pedagogue\n\nEldar Aleksandrovich Ryazanov (Russian: Эльдар Александрович Рязанов; 18 November 1927 – 30 November 2015) was a Soviet and Russian film director, screenwriter, poet, actor and pedagogue whose popular comedies, satirizing the daily life of the Soviet Union and Russia, are celebrated throughout the former Soviet Union and former Warsaw Pact countries.[1][2][3]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nEldar Aleksandrovich Ryazanov was born in Samara. His father, Aleksandr Semyonovich Ryazanov, was a diplomat who worked in Tehran. His mother, Sofya Mikhailovna (née Shusterman), was of Jewish descent.[4]\n\nIn 1930, the family moved to Moscow, and soon his parents divorced. He was then raised by his mother and her new husband, Lev Mikhailovich Kopp. In 1937 his father was arrested by the Stalinist government and subsequently served 18 years in the correctional labour camps.[5]\n\nRyazanov began to create films in the early 1950s. In 1955, Ivan Pyryev, then a major force in the Soviet film industry, suggested to him to begin work on his film Carnival Night. At first, Ryazanov refused, as he wanted to make \"serious films\", but then was convinced to begin, as Pyryev believed that \"anybody could shoot a melodrama, but only a few can create good comedy.\"[6] He won instant success, and began to release more films.\n\nHe was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1984, and received the USSR State Prize in 1977. He won the Nika Award for Best Director in 1991 for the film Promised Heaven.\n\nAmong his most famous films are Carnival Night (1955), Hussar Ballad (1962), Beware of the Car (1966), The Irony of Fate (1975), Office Romance (1977), The Garage (1980), Station for Two (1982) and A Cruel Romance (1984). Ryazanov's main genre was tragicomedy.\n\nIllness and death\n\n[edit]\n\nRyazanov had an acute ischemic stroke in November 2014. He was admitted to a Moscow hospital on 21 November 2015 due to shortness of breath. He died around midnight on 30 November 2015, of heart and lung failure, at the age of 88.[7]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nRyazanov was one of the most successful film directors of the Soviet Union, and his films are still well-known in the post-USSR landscape. The Irony of Fate is still aired every December 31 in most post-USSR countries, except for Ukraine since the 2014 Revolution of Dignity.[8] A street in Moscow was named after him in 2017,[9] and a museum and memorial dedicated to his memory was opened on the site of his childhood home in Samara.\n\nCriticism\n\n[edit]\n\nIn his book \"Nepoladki v russkom dome\" Sergey Kara-Murza wrote that \"Ryazanov and the artists close to him, consumed by anti-Soviet feeling, lovingly reflected and thereby in many ways created a certain social and spiritual world - and this world turned out to be possible only when it was surrounded and protected by the crude structures of the Soviet way of life.\"[10]\n\nHonours and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nOrder \"For Merit to the Fatherland\";\n\n2nd class (3 July 2008) – for outstanding contribution to the development of national cinema and many years of creative activity\n\n3rd class (20 June 1996) – for services to the state, an outstanding contribution to the development of national cinema and culture\n\nOrder of the Red Banner of Labour, twice (1969, 1977)\n\nOrder of Friendship of Peoples (1987)\n\nOrder of the \"Key of Friendship\" (Kemerovo Region, 2007)\n\nCommander of the Order of Arts and Letters (France)\n\nCommander of the Order of Honour (Georgia) (2008)\n\nPeople's Artist of the RSFSR (1974)\n\nPeople's Artist of the USSR (1984)\n\nUSSR State Prize (1977) (for the film \"Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath!\")\n\nVasilyev Brothers State Prize of the RSFSR (1979) (for the film \"Office Romance\")\n\nWinner of the All-Union Film Festival in the \"First Prize among the comedies\" for 1958\n\nWinner of the All-Union Film Festival in the \"Special Award\" for 1983\n\nNika awards;\n\nBest Director (1991)\n\nBest Fiction Film (1991)\n\nHonour and dignity (2006)\n\nWinner of Tsarskoye Selo Art Prize (2005)\n\nThe asteroid 4258 Ryazanov is named after him.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\n1950 They are Studying in Moscow (Russian: Они учатся в Москве), documentary – author (in co-operation with Zoya Fomina)\n\n1951 The Way Named October (Дорога имени Октября), documentary – director (in co-operation with Liya Derbysheva)\n\n1952 On the World Chess Championship (На первенство мира по шахматам), documentary – director\n\n1953 Your Books (Твои книжки), documentary – director (in co-operation with Zoya Fomina)\n\n1953 Near Krasnodar (Недалеко от Краснодара), documentary – director\n\n1954 Island of Sakhalin (Остров Сахалин), documentary – director (in co-operation with Vasily Katanyan)\n\n1955 Spring Voices (Весенние голоса), documentary – second director\n\n1956 Carnival Night (Карнавальная ночь) – director\n\n1957 The Girl Without Address (Девушка без адреса) – director\n\n1961 How Robinson Was Created (Как создавался Робинзон) – director\n\n1961 The Man from Nowhere (Человек ниоткуда) – director\n\n1962 Hussar Ballad (Гусарская баллада) – director / screenwriter\n\n1965 Give me a complaints book (Дайте жалобную книгу) – director / actor: chief editor\n\n1966 Beware of the Car (Берегись автомобиля) – director / screenwriter\n\n1968 Zigzag of Success (Зигзаг удачи) – director / screenwriter\n\n1971 Grandads-Robbers (Старики-разбойники) – director / screenwriter / actor: the passer-by\n\n1974 Unbelievable Adventures of Italians in Russia (Невероятные приключения итальянцев в России) – director / screenwriter / actor: doctor\n\n1975 The Irony of Fate (Ирония судьбы или с легким паром!) – director / screenwriter / actor: airplane passenger\n\n1977 Office Romance (Служебный роман) – director / screenwriter / actor: bus passenger\n\n1979 The Garage (Гараж) – director / screenwriter / actor: sleeping Man\n\n1981 Say a Word for the Poor Hussar (О бедном гусаре замолвите слово) – director / screenwriter / actor: confectioner\n\n1982 Station for Two (Вокзал для двоих) – director / screenwriter / actor: railroad supervisor\n\n1984 A Cruel Romance (Жестокий романс) – director / screenwriter\n\n1987 Forgotten Melody for a Flute (Забытая мелодия для флейты) – director / screenwriter / actor: astronomer\n\n1988 Dear Yelena Sergeyevna (Дорогая Елена Сергеевна) – director / screenwriter / actor: neighbour\n\n1991 Promised Heaven (Небеса обетованные) – director / screenwriter / actor: man in diner\n\n1993 Prediction (Предсказание) – director / screenwriter\n\n1996 Hello, Fools!
