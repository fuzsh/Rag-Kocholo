        "text": "One Italian Summer\n\nRebecca Serle\n\nKaty and Carol had been planning their mother-daughter trip to Positano, Italy, when Carol suddenly died. Katy decides to travel to Italy anyway while recovering from the sudden death of her mother. Once she arrives in the scenic Amalfi Coast, she finds herself face-to-face with a younger version of her mother through fantastic time-bending magic of fiction. Her mother had spent the summer before meeting Katy's father having an Italian adventure of her own, and through the timelessness of the Italian seaside, Katy finds out what she really wants in life.\n\nThe Little Italian Hotel\n\nPhaedra Patrick\n\nRadio host Ginny Splinter is excited for the trip to Italy she has planned to celebrate her 30th wedding anniversary. Her husband Adrian is excited to file for divorce. Surprised by the sudden change of plans, Ginny invites four of her radio listeners on the trip with her where they travel to Bologna and Venice for a fun-filled adventure exploring the ideas of marriage and identity.\n\nOur Italian Summer\n\nJennifer Probst\n\nThree generations of women take a month-long trip to Italy. The Italian American Ferrari family all have different reasons for taking their trip. Grandmother Sophia Ferrari fears she might be terminally ill. Workaholic Francesca, an ad executive, is suffering panic attacks. Allegra, the youngest, is looking for some motherly attention. The women ostensibly are embarking on their epic summer vacation in the hopes of tracking down their family history. The trip takes them to Rome, Assisi, and Tuscany. And of course, along the way they meet handsome tour guides and hot priests in-training.\n\nThe Star-Cross Sisters of Tuscany\n\nLori Nelson Spielman\n\nThis generation-spanning novel follows the second-born daughters of the Fontana family who have been cursed into never finding true love. Two cousins are convinced to travel to Italy with their Great Aunt Poppy where they are destined to break the curse and fall in love. The adventure takes the women through Tuscany and the Amalfi Coast on their quest to find salvation. The Italian American women ultimately learn family secrets and about the rich history of their Italian ancestors.\n\nLizzie & Dante: A Novel\n\nMary Bly\n\nAfter receiving a cancer diagnosis, Lizzie decides she needs a vacation to the Italian Island of Elba. She's a Shakespearean scholar normally employed at Rutgers University, but she takes off for a six-week long holiday with her best friend, Grey and his partner Rohan, a film star. Technically she’s not just on vacation but consulting on a new film script as well. Once in Italy, Lizzie finds herself enchanted by Dante, who she has met on the island's beach. Lizzie continues to contemplate her treatment options while on vacation attempting to grapple with the terminal illness and life’s regrets."
