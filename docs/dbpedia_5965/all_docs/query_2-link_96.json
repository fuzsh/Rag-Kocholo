Average costs are based on various trip costs, ages and number of travelers.\n\nHow Much Does Travel Insurance Cost?\n\nThe average cost of travel insurance is 6% of your trip cost, based on our analysis. The cost of travel insurance is usually mainly based on the age of travelers and the trip cost being insured.\n\nHere’s a look at the average travel insurance cost for a 30-year-old woman traveling from California to Mexico for a 14-day trip.\n\nTrip cost Average travel insurance cost Travel insurance cost as % of insured trip cost\n\n$1,000\n\n$61\n\n6%\n\n$2,500\n\n$120\n\n5%\n\n$5,000\n\n$228\n\n5%\n\n$10,000\n\n$512\n\n5%\n\n$20,000\n\n$1,204\n\n6%\n\n$30,000\n\n$1,848\n\n6%\n\n$50,000\n\n$3,091\n\n6%\n\nWhat Affects Travel Insurance Costs?\n\nUnlike many other types of insurance, there are usually only a few factors that go into travel insurance pricing.\n\nTrip Cost Being Insured\n\nThe more trip costs you insure, the higher your travel insurance cost. Your trip cost includes any prepaid, non-refundable expenses, such as airfare, hotel accommodations, tours, event tickets, excursions and theme park passes.\n\nYour Age\n\nThe traveler’s age is also taken into account in travel insurance pricing. That’s because older travelers tend to have a higher likelihood of filing medical claims.\n\nCoverage\n\nThe more protection you buy, the more you’ll pay. For instance, if you opt for a “cancel for any reason” upgrade and generous travel medical expense coverage, you’ll pay more.\n\nWhat Does Travel Insurance Cover?\n\nComprehensive travel insurance policies package together a number of valuable benefits. You can also buy policies that cover only trip cancellation or only medical expenses. With the wide variety of travel insurance plans available, you can find coverage levels that will fit your budget and trip needs. The core types of travel insurance include the following:\n\nTrip Cancellation Insurance\n\nTrip cancellation insurance reimburses you 100% for money you lose in prepaid, non-refundable deposits if you have to cancel for a reason listed in the policy. Common reasons include unexpected illness, injury and family member sickness. This is different from the “cancel for any reason” travel insurance upgrade.\n\nTravel Medical Insurance\n\nTravel medical insurance pays for ambulance service, X-rays, lab work, medicine, doctor and hospital bills, and other medical expenses during your trip, up to policy limits. Accidents and health issues can arise unexpectedly, so this is important coverage for travelers going abroad, where your U.S. health plan may have limited global coverage or no coverage.\n\nCase Study: Food Poisoning in London\n\nI was excited to try a highly regarded restaurant while visiting London, but shortly after lunch, I experienced severe nausea and symptoms suggesting food poisoning. It got worse so quickly that I had to rush to the emergency room for medicine and IV fluids. Thankfully, my travel insurance came through. It covered 100% of the $822 in hospital charges and medication costs. The claim process was surprisingly smooth—I just submitted my records and receipts online. This experience made me realize just how essential travel insurance is!\n\n– Katy D., New York\n\nEmergency Medical Evacuation Insurance\n\nEmergency medical evacuation insurance pays up to the policy limits to get you to the nearest adequate medical facility. This can especially come in handy if you are in a remote location and need emergency transportation for medical care.\n\nTravel Delay Insurance\n\nTravel delay insurance compensates you for expenses for things like meals and lodging if you’re stuck somewhere due to a delay that’s covered by your travel insurance plan. Specified waiting period before benefits apply—for example, six or 12 hours—and also a per-day maximum limit and a total maximum per person.\n\nTrip Interruption Insurance\n\nIf you have to cut your trip short because of a reason listed in the policy, trip interruption insurance reimburses you for the non-refundable parts of your trip that you miss. It can also pay for a last-minute one-way ticket home if you have an emergency.\n\nBaggage Insurance\n\nBaggage insurance reimburses you for lost, stolen or damaged belongings. But note that reimbursement is for the depreciated value of your items, not the cost to buy new ones.\n\nAnd baggage delay insurance lets you recoup expenses for necessities, such as clothes and toiletries, while you wait for your luggage. Policies usually require a certain time delay before baggage delay coverage kicks in, such as six hours.\n\n“Cancel For Any Reason” Travel Insurance\n\n“Cancel for any reason” (CFAR) travel insurance is optional coverage that allows you to cancel your trip for any reason that’s not listed in your base policy and be partially reimbursed for non-refundable trip costs.\n\nYou generally must cancel at least 48 hours before your departure time. Reimbursement under a CFAR claim is usually 75% or 50% of your trip costs. CFAR adds an average of about 50% to an insurance plan’s cost, but might be worth it if you want the most flexibility for trip cancellation.\n\n“Interruption For Any Reason” Travel Insurance\n\n“Interruption for any reason” (IFAR) travel insurance is an optional upgrade that permits you to cut short a trip for any reason and get up to 75% reimbursement for the non-refundable money you lose. You usually must be at least 48 hours into your trip to file a claim. It typically adds 3% to 10% to your travel insurance cost.\n\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance\n\nAccidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance is included in some policies. If an accident that’s covered by the policy kills or dismembers the policyholder during the trip, travel accident insurance pays out the specified amount.\n\nIt usually pays out a percentage of the maximum benefit, depending on the loss.\n\nEXPERT TIPS\n\nHow to Buy Travel Insurance\n\nMichelle Megna\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nJason Metz\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nAmy Danise\n\nInsurance Managing Editor\n\nAshlee Valentine\n\nInsurance Editor\n\nLes Masterson\n\nInsurance Editor\n\nBegin Shopping Right After Your First Trip Deposit\n\nIt’s wise to buy travel insurance immediately after you make your first trip deposit. That way, you get the maximum length of time for cancellation coverage. Plus, you’ll qualify for time-sensitive benefits, such as CFAR and pre-existing medical condition exclusion waivers\n\nMichelle Megna\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nStart by Estimating the Non-Refundable Trip Cost\n\nThe non-refundable trip cost is the amount you want to insure for trip cancellation. If you’re unsure of what the total cost will be, estimate the amount and then update it later with the travel insurance company, as long as you do so before your departure date.\n\nJason Metz\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nBuy Travel Medical Insurance for International Trips\n\nIf you’re traveling outside the U.S., make sure you buy a policy with ample travel medical and emergency medical evacuation insurance. It’s important because you may have little to no coverage under your U.S. health plan. Look for a policy where the medical insurance is primary, meaning the policy will pay out first, before any other health insurance you have.\n\nAmy Danise\n\nInsurance Managing Editor\n\nCheck for Delay and Missed Connection Coverage\n\nIf you’re flying to your destination, your itinerary could be derailed by weather, airplane mechanical issues or missed connections. If you’re worried about paying extra money due to a delay or missed connections, look for a policy that has a generous amount of travel and baggage delay coverage and missed connection insurance. You’ll also want to find a policy with a short waiting period for delay coverage, such as six hours.\n\nAshlee Valentine\n\nInsurance Editor\n\nDecide How Much Cancellation Flexibility You Want\n\nIf you have a lot of non-refundable expenses and can’t afford to lose your trip investment, consider buying a “cancel for any reason” upgrade. You never know what life will bring, and unfortunately it might bring a reason to cancel a trip that’s not covered by the base policy. Having CFAR coverage ensures you can get partial reimbursement for any oddball problems that crop up.\n\nLes Masterson\n\nInsurance Editor\n\nWhen to Skip Travel Insurance\n\nYou likely don’t need travel insurance if:\n\nYour airfare and hotel costs are refundable.\n\nYou can afford to lose the money you spent on non-refundable trip costs.\n\nYou’re not traveling internationally.\n\nYou’re not traveling to a remote area with limited healthcare facilities.\n\nYour destination is not prone to hurricanes and severe weather.\n\nYou have a direct flight.\n\nYou’re not worried about losing your trip investment if you need to cancel or cut a trip short.\n\nYour credit card travel insurance provides adequate coverage for your trip.\n\nA new rule going into effect in October 2024 requires airlines to provide automatic cash refunds to passengers when their domestic flights are canceled or delayed by three hours or more. Given this, I think you may want to skip travel insurance if you have a direct flight within the U.S. and you don’t have large prepaid deposits on accommodations and tours.\n\n– Michelle Megna, Lead Editor\n\nCompare & Buy Travel Insurance\n\nLeaving Home\n\nReturning Home\n\nMain Destination\n\nAsk The Expert\n\nWe Answer Your Questions\n\nJason Metz\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nMichelle Megna\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nLes Masterson\n\nInsurance Editor\n\nWhy do most travel insurance companies not include England as a choice for a quote?\n\n– Susan G., Van Nuys, California\n\nMany travel insurance companies do not list England as a destination choice in their online quote systems because they instead list the United Kingdom. That means you’ll have to scroll down the list of destinations to “United Kingdom” or type it into the search field.\n\nJason Metz\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nDo I still need travel insurance if my airline is required to refund canceled flights?\n\n– Anna P., Austin, Texas\n\nTravel insurance still makes sense if you have a lot of non-refundable trip costs, such as excursions, accommodations and tours. It’s especially beneficial if you’re traveling internationally. It can help pay for medical expenses and evacuation if you get sick or injured during your trip.\n\nMichelle Megna\n\nInsurance Lead Editor\n\nWhy do travel insurance companies need my state of residence when I get a quote?\n\n– John T., Lewiston, Maine\n\nTravel insurance regulations and laws vary by state, so insurers use that information to ensure the policy you buy is the one that’s approved in your state.\n\nLes Masterson\n\nInsurance Editor\n\nMethodology\n\nWe researched and analyzed 42 policies to find the best travel insurance. When companies had more than one highly rated travel insurance policy we used the highest-scoring plan. Ratings are based on the following metrics.\n\nCost (25% of score): We analyzed the average cost for each travel insurance policy for trips to popular destinations:\n\nCouple, age 30 for a Mexico trip costing $3,000.\n\nCouple, age 40, for an Italy trip costing $6,000.\n\nFamily of four for an Italy trip costing $15,000.\n\nFamily of four for a France trip costing $15,000.\n\nFamily of four for a U.K. trip costing $15,000.\n\nCouple, age 65, for an Italy trip costing $6,000.\n\nCouple, age 70, for a Mexico trip costing $3,000.\n\nMissed connection coverage (10% of score): Travel insurance policies were awarded more points if they include missed connection benefits of $1,000 per person or more.\n\nMedical expenses (10% of score): Travel insurance policies with travel medical expense benefits of $250,000 and up per person were given the highest points.\n\nMedical evacuation (10% of score): Travel insurance policies with medical evacuation expense benefits of $500,000 and up per person were given the highest points.\n\n“Cancel for any reason” upgrade (10%): Travel insurance policies received points if “cancel for any reason” upgrades are offered. More points were awarded for “cancel for any reason” upgrades with reimbursement levels of 75%.\n\nBaggage delay required waiting time (5%): Policies with baggage delay benefits kicking in at 12 hours or less were given points.\n\nCancel for work reasons (5%): Travel insurance plans that allow cancellations for work reasons were awarded points.\n\nHurricane and weather (5%): Policies received points if the required waiting period for hurricane and weather coverage was 12 hours or less.\n\n“Interruption for any reason” upgrade (5%): Policies were awarded points if they offered an “interruption for any reason” upgrade.\n\nPre-existing medical condition exclusion waiver (5%): Points were given to policies that cover pre-existing medical conditions (if purchased within a required timeframe after the first trip deposit).\n\nTravel delay required waiting time (5%): Policies with travel delay benefits kicking in after six hours or less were given points.\n\nTrip interruption travel insurance (5%): Points were given if trip interruption reimbursement is 150% or higher.\n\nRead more: How Forbes Advisor Rates Travel Insurance Companies\n\nEditor’s note: While our parent company has an interest in PrimeCover, this review was subjected to our team’s standard rigorous editorial process, which remains independent of any influence from insurance companies, business relationships, affiliates or any other external parties.\n\nBest Travel Insurance Companies Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat is travel insurance?\n\nTravel insurance is a type of policy that reimburses you for money you lose from non-refundable deposits and payments when something goes wrong on your trip. These problems can range from lost baggage to flight delays to medical problems.\n\nThe more you’re spending on your trip, the more you likely need travel insurance. This is especially true for international trips and cruises, where travel problems become more expensive to solve.\n\nWhat do I need for travel insurance?\n\nThe information you need to buy travel insurance includes the trip cost being insured, your age, your destination, length of trip and age. Buying travel insurance online is relatively easy. You don’t have to answer a lot of questions, and you can update your trip cost and itinerary later if plans change, as long as you do so before your departure.\n\nIs there travel insurance for multiple trips?\n\nWhile standard travel insurance plans are meant to cover one-time trips, frequent travelers should consider an annual travel insurance plan. These plans cover the same issues as a single-trip plan, such as trip cancellation and emergency medical situations. But they also offer the convenience of a one-time purchase for multiple trips.\n\nWhat type of travel insurance do I need for my parents visiting me in the U.S.?\n\nTravel insurance for parents visiting the U.S. is generally a travel medical insurance policy that helps pay medical costs if they get sick or injured during their visit. There are two main types of visitors medical insurance:\n\nLimited policies that have fixed benefits: These generally set a cap for what they’ll pay for each medical treatment that’s covered. You may need to pay a deductible for each medical illness or injury and then the policy will pay 100% after that, up to the cap. For example, coverage for an X-ray might be capped at $250.\n\nComprehensive visitors insurance policies: These typically cost more but have more robust coverage and don’t put a cap on specific medical problems.\n\nWhat’s not covered by travel insurance?\n\nProblems not covered by travel insurance tend to be similar among policies. We recommend that you read a policy’s exclusions so you’re not caught by surprise later if you try to make a claim. Typical exclusions include:\n\nInjuries from high-risk activities such as scuba diving.\n\nProblems that happen because you were drunk or using drugs.\n\nMedical tourism, such as going abroad for a face lift or other elective procedure.\n\nLost or stolen cash."
