Soviet film critics about Soviet cinema: from censorship to Gorbachev's perestroika 213-277 Instructions for Authors 278-286\n\nThe analysis of the journal Cinema Art – 1977 revealed the following main film criticism trends:-the magazine was unable to preserve the \"thawing\" tendencies, which were still strong even in the late 1960s, and in many ways proved to be in the ideological line of the peak of the L. Brezhnev's epoch;-At the same time, the journal tried to analyze the most notable works of Soviet cinema, while, alas, not allowing even in minimal doses a criticism of the shortcomings in the works of the most \"principally\" influential at that time the screen masters;-giving a weighty tribute to the Soviet propaganda pathos, the magazine could afford to publish the substantive discussions \" on certain narrow bridgeheads \". In general, the Cinema Art in 1977 was part of a typical model of the Soviet humanitarian journal, which, with significant censorship concessions and powers, tried to retain at least 50% of the total text for art analysis of the film process.\n\nThis article gives the way for hermeneutic analysis of the topic of the White movement in the mirror of the Soviet cinema (1930s-1940s, the feature films of the sound period). The hermeneutical analysis suggests media text comprehension through comparison with historical, cultural tradition and reality; penetration of its logic; through comparison of media images in historical and cultural context by combining historical, hermeneutical analysis of the structural, plot, ethical, ideological, iconographic / visual, media stereotypes and analysis of media text characters. An analysis of this kind of media texts, in our opinion, is particularly important for media literacy education of future historians, culture and art historians, sociologists, psychologists and educators. Thus, the comparative analysis of plot schemes, characters, and ideology of the Soviet sound films of 1930s-1940s, in varying degrees of affecting the subject of the White movement, leads to the conclusion about the essential similarity of their media stereotypes. Content analysis of screen media texts of 1930s-1940s on the topic related to the White movement allows generally to submit their basic narrative schemes as follows: cruel and treacherous, cowardly and cunning Whites and their allies are trying to overthrow the Bolshevik power by all means available to them (military / or guerrilla action, intervention, rebellion, terrorism, espionage, bribery, etc.), but they tolerate the inevitable defeat.\n\nSECOND UPDATED EDITION The relevance of the book topic is highlighted by the following reasons: audiovisual media (cinematography, television, and the internet) are effective means of affecting the audience, especially school children and youth (due to their age peculiarities and a high degree of their media contacts); in recent decades Russian schools and universities have significantly been altered and reformed and are still the focal point of vigorous debates; consequently, the analysis of school and university topic transformation in the mirror of Soviet & Russian audiovisual media texts is highly topical nowadays both for culture studies, film studies and media education. The research material of this book is audiovisual media texts about school and university; the authors use a comparative hermeneutic analysis of audiovisual media texts relating to the topic (including stereotypes analysis, ideological analysis, identification analysis, iconographic analysis, narrative analysis of media texts, media text’s character analysis, etc.), anthropological and gender analyses. For researchers in the field of cinematography, pedagogy, cultural studies, media culture, sociology, political science, for teachers, post-graduate students and university students of humanitarian specialties."
