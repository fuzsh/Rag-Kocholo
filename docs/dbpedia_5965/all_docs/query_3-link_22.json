Larger ideological issues are mythicized and conflicts personalized over historical accuracy. Adventure usually involves a courageous, altruistic and patriotic hero willing to fight for his beliefs, who becomes involved in a struggle for freedom by overcoming oppression and helping to create a more just society."
