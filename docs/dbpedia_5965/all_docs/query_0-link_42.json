Dizzying camera angles, expressionistic lighting, increasingly surreal locations; Welles unleashed the full force of his visual brilliance to convey the nightmarish disorientation of a world gone mad.\n\nBlast of Silence (Blu-ray) by The Criterion Collection\n\nCall Number: HDDVD 1015\n\nSwift, brutal, and blackhearted, Allen Baron's New York City noir film is a sensational surprise. This low-budget, carefully crafted portrait of a hit man on assignment in Manhattan during Christmastime follows its stripped-down narrative with mechanical precision, yet also with an eye and ear for the oddball details of urban living and the imposing beauty of the city. At once visually ragged and artfully composed, and featuring rough, poetic narration performed by Lionel Stander and written by Waldo Salt (both uncredited), it is a stylish triumph.\n\nDouble Indemnity (Blu-ray) by The Criterion Collection\n\nCall Number: HDDVD 1019\n\nHas dialogue ever been more perfectly hard-boiled? Has a femme fatale ever been as deliciously evil as Barbara Stanwyck? And has 1940s Los Angeles ever looked so seductively sordid? When slick salesman Walter Neff walks into the swank home of dissatisfied housewife Phyllis Dietrichson, he intends to sell her insurance, but he winds up becoming entangled with her in a far more sinister way. It is one of the most wickedly perverse stories ever told and the cynical standard by which all noir must be measured.\n\nExotica (Blu-ray) by The Criterion Collection\n\nCall Number: HDDVD 1021\n\nAt a neon-drenched Toronto strip club, a coterie of lost and damaged souls-- including a man haunted by grief, a young woman with whom he shares an enigmatic bond, an obsessive emcee, and a smuggler of rare bird eggs-- search for redemption as they work through the traumas of their mysteriously interconnected histories in an obsessive cycle of sex, pain, jealousy, and catharsis. One of the defining independent films of the 1990s, Atom Egoyan's mesmerizing international breakthrough takes the conventions of the psychological thriller into bold new territory; unsettling, dreamlike, and empathetic.\n\nLa Bamba (Blu-ray) by The Criterion Collection\n\nCall Number: HDDVD 1023\n\nThe brief but incandescent life of rock-and-roll trailblazer Ritchie Valens is immortalized in this enthralling biopic from another Mexican American icon, Luis Valdez, the father of Chicano cinema. With sweetness and swagger, Lou Diamond Phillips embodies the 1950s California teenager who, forged by his fiercely supportive mother and rebellious brother, rises from his farm-working roots to chart-topping fame in the early days of rock, until one fateful night that haunts music history. Propelled by a hip-shaking soundtrack featuring Los Lobos and Carlos Santana, this film captures the electric vitality of an artist who bridged cultures to create his own American dream.\n\nBo Widerberg's New Swedish Cinema (Blu-ray) by The Criterion Collection\n\nCall Number: HDDVD 994\n\nDriven by a desire to forge a socially conscious Swedish cinema—one that broke with the inward-looking psychodrama of Ingmar Bergman to give dynamic expression to the everyday experiences of working-class Swedes—writer Bo Widerberg turned to filmmaking in the early 1960s, realizing his ambition in politically committed yet poetic works that merge social-realist themes with a refined, often breathtakingly beautiful visual sensibility. Dramatizing the struggles of ordinary people fighting to chart their own destiny, these four acclaimed, popular, and pivotal films from Widerberg’s most prolific period live and breathe with a rare vitality—and helped launch a new Swedish cinema.--Amazon.com\n\nDaddy Longlegs (Blu-ray) by The Criterion Collection\n\nCall Number: HDDVD 1017\n\nMining the emotional sense memories of their fractured childhoods, Josh and Benny Safdie craft a by turns empathetic and disquieting portrait of parental dysfunction poised between fierce love and terrifying irresponsibility.

Vérité New York naturalism gives way to flights of surreal lyricism, a blearily impressionistic anti-fairy tale that finds unexpected humanity in the seemingly most irredeemable of fathers.\n\nMedicine for Melancholy by The Criterion Collection\n\nCall Number: HDDVD 1026\n\nOne of the great debut features of the twenty-first century, Barry Jenkins's captivating, lo-fi romance Medicine for Melancholy unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly gentrifying San Francisco, where a one-night stand between two young bohemians, Micah and Jo,' spins off into a woozy daylong affair marked by moments of tenderness, friction, joy, and intellectual sparring as they explore their relationships to each other, the city, and their own Blackness. Shooting on desaturated video, Jenkins crafts an intimate exploration of alienation and connection graced with the evocative visual palette and empathetic emotional charge that has come to define his work.\n\nMr. Klein (Blu-ray) by The Criterion Collection\n\nCall Number: HDDVD 1027\n\n\"One of the crowning achievements of blacklisted Hollywood director Joseph Losey's European exile, Mr. Klein is a spellbinding modernist mystery that puts a chilling twist on the wrong-man thriller. Alain Delon delivers a standout performance as Robert Klein, a decadent art dealer in France during World War II who makes a tidy profit buying up paintings from his desperate Jewish clients. As Klein searches for a Jewish man with the same name for whom he has been mistaken, he finds himself plunged into a Kafkaesque nightmare in which his identity seems to dissolve and the forces of history to close in on him.
