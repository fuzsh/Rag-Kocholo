        "text": "Have you wanted to create an Adventure, but didn’t have a credit? The wait is over!\n\nOn July 23, 2024, Geocaching HQ released a new self-service portal for credit distribution, enabling Premium members to receive Adventure builder credits through the Adventure Lab® app.\n\nCriteria to qualify for a credit:\n\nActive Premium membership\n\nNo available builder credits\n\nNo unpublished Adventures\n\nPassed eligibility date*\n\nIf a creator meets the above criteria, they can claim a credit in the Adventure Lab app and start creating their new Adventure right away.\n\n* The eligibility date is determined by how recently a creator received a credit. Creators are eligible for a new credit every 90 days.\n\nTo access this feature in-app, select “Profile,” then “How to create an Adventure.” Additional information can be found in the release notes and the Adventure Lab Builder.\n\nHappy creating!\n\nNote: We previously included in the criteria to qualify for a credit that an Adventure creator had to have “published Adventures rated in the top 90%”. Informed by community feedback, we decided to remove this criterion."
