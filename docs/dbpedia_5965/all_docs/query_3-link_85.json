        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Stanley Tucci is continuing his Italian adventures. However, the actor is moving from CNN to National Geographic with his latest travel docuseries.\n\nNat Geo has ordered Tucci – The Heart of Italy (w/t), a ten-part series. It comes after the Warner Bros. Discovery-owned network CNN canceled Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy, which won two Emmys for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special, after two seasons.\n\nAt the time, Tucci was confident that he’d find a new home for his adventures and he has.\n\nThe series is produced by BBC Studios’ recently formed new unit, Specialist Factual Productions, and Tucci’s own Salt Productions, which he recently founded with Lottie Birmingham. It marks Salt’s first series and production starts in January.\n\nStanley Tucci: Searching for Italy was produced by All3Media-owned Raw Television.\n\nTucci – The Heart of Italy follows the Murder One star as he returns to the country for more food-based adventures.\n\nHe will travel to ten regions including Sicily, Trentino-Alto Adige, Veneto, Marche and Lazio, seeking out the essence of each region and its people through the food they eat. He’ll meet professional chefs, amateur cooks, farmers and fishermen, winemakers and brewers, and fellow eaters who all share his passion for food and who inspire him.\n\nThe series is exec produced by Tucci and Birmingham as well as Alan Holland and Amanda Lyon for BBC Studios. Ben Jessop, who has produced series including Nat Geo’s The World According to Jeff Goldblum, serves as showrunner.\n\n“National Geographic is all about adventure and exploration, and I am honored to take viewers once again to explore Italy through the lens of food,” said Tucci. “In Italy’s many distinct regions there is always something new to discover and I’m more than excited to begin the process in partnership with BBC Studios.”\n\n“National Geographic is the perfect home for Stanley to share his knowledge and passion for Italy’s people, food and culture,” added Tom McDonald, EVP of Global Factual and Unscripted, National Geographic. “Our programming is all about inspiring a deeper connection to the world. With Stanley as their guide, audiences will be transported to places and to flavors they’ve never experienced before.”\n\nAlan Holland, Head of BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions, added “We are thrilled to be working with Stanley on this major new series and to be strengthening our partnership with National Geographic. Stanley is the perfect guide for this delicious journey, and we couldn’t be prouder to be partnering with him, Salt Productions and National Geographic to bring this to audiences around the world.”\n\nTucci is repped by CAA, Anonymous Content and Curtis Brown."
