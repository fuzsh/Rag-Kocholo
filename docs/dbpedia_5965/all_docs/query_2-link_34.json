        "text": "I first started writing the book in 1981, and I put the project aside because at that time, there seemed to be an enormous mania about dinosaurs in America, and I did not want to book to appear to ride a current fashion. But the fashion never went away. Finally I realized that the fascination with dinosaurs was permanent. It is always there.\n\nI suspect children have always been fascinated by dinosaurs. To go to a museum and see a young child, barely able to walk and talk, shrieking “stegosaurus” and “tyrannosaurus” as they see the creatures, is a very striking thing. Why does it happen? What is going on in that child’s mind, shouting out those complex Latin names? I have thought about it a great deal and I conclude I have no idea why it occurs. But dinosaurs seem to excite the imagination of both adults and children everywhere in the world.\n\nDuring the last few years, I have entertained many theories about why this is so. For a while I thought it might be a particular fascination in countries where skeletons have been found—a kind of nationalistic interest. But dinosaurs are popular everywhere. For example, they are a source of great fascination in Japan, although no remains have been found there.\n\nFor a while, I thought it was primarily a childish interest. But in museums, you notice that adults are equally fascinated. (I often think the children are only an excuse for adults to go visit the dinosaurs.)\n\nFor a while, I thought it was an interest that children passed on to each other, in a proof of juvenile subculture. But my own daughter showed a marked interest in dinosaurs before she ever went to pre-school, before she was even very verbal.\n\nFor a while, I thought it was a function of the great size of these creatures. But the smaller dinosaurs excite just as much interest. Baby dinosaurs are very appealing. And in any case, the dinosaur toys are all small…\n\nFor a while, I thought the interest was something to do with the fact that the dinosaurs had become extinct. But children are not clear about this. When my daughter was two years old, she asked to see the dinosaurs at the zoo. (She had been to the zoo several times, and apparently thought the dinosaurs were caged in some section we hadn’t visited yet. She greeted the news that she could not see dinosaurs at the zoo with a resigned shrug—parents never do what you want them to do!)\n\nSo in the end, I decided I just don’t understand it. And I don’t believe anybody does. In the end, it is a mystery."
