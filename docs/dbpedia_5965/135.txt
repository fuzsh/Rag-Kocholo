Preface In 1974, while visiting a friend in Los Gatos, California with scarcely a dime in my pocket, I learned that Pacific Film Archives was showing Rossellini’s The Age of the Medici over three nights in Berkeley. I walked to the interstate and hitched a ride. My driver was a Chicano in a beat-up car. He showed me an iron rod he kept under the seat for unruly passengers and negotiated the jammed highway by going seventy in the service lane. As he dropped me off, he mentioned he was checking into a psychiatric hospital. The first segment of The Medici ended at midnight. My bed was fifty miles away with no way to get to it. I tried sleeping across the street in a University of California dormitory lounge, but a guard threw me out. I found a bush, and it started to rain. All the next day it poured. I sat in a small museum, saw the second part of The Medici that night, got drenched afterward, and for two dollars found space with some other strays on the floor of an apartment, where flood lights and rock music blared through what was left of the night until we were kicked out at seven. The rain had stopped. I waited fourteen hours and saw the third part of The Medici. I cannot imagine a better context for a Rossellini movie: confusion, chaos, out-on-a-limb, obsessed. And the movie: order, but something more: providence, amazing grace. Never have house lights coming on jarred me so precipitously out of one world and into the next. It was devastating. Why? Eventually I would learn that Rossellini’s real life, outside the “new reality” he created in his pictures, was perpetually in turmoil, and not unwittingly. Yet the man himself had a calm about him, a confidence, charm and fascination that everyone who knew him remarked on and that ought to be present on every page of this book—but is not—because it explains why so many people wanted to love, serve, and be acknowledged by him. Sooner or later, inevitably, they would feel betrayed. The house lights would come on. Long before then Rossellini would have gone on to new conquests, refusing to look back, “going to meet the future,” as he would say. Part of him never left you; you did not stop loving him. Why did Rossellini devastate people? I met him once, for a two-hour interview. He bought me a beer and told me it was easy to borrow all the money I needed for anything. “People don’t try,” he explained. I understood what people meant about him. “These are my things,” his sister and wife Marcella both told me when I

asked them questions, as though in the very act of speaking they would be giving away parts of their selves. I wanted to reply that he was “my thing” too. My experience was of a different order, however. The Rossellini I knew was an artistic consciousness, nearly as unknown to them as the supple human being was to me. Yet for both of us, what we knew was mystery. Neo-realism was an effort, born in pain and confusion during the war and Resistance, to take stock of what Italians had been through, to sift through a mystery, to make sense. It was premised on the heady assumption that our lives need not be ruled by fortune or evil, that, if we are willing to be intelligent, we are capable of imposing our fantasies on History, changing the concept of the universe, and creating a “new reality.” This had been the message of Open City, Paisà and the other neo-realist films. It was also the message of the Italian Renaissance depicted in The Age of the Medici. In spite of the confusion, private and public, of the decades between these films—the 1940s, ‘50s and ‘60s—Rossellini stayed loyal to the Resistance commitment to create a new culture. This was the great adventure toward the future, the “new.” Gerald Mast told me when I began this book ten years ago that biography is fiction. I did not believe him then; I do now. Everything here is based either on my own experience of the movies or of what people have told me in a hundred interviews. Written sources are no more reliable, often less so. Rossellini’s own statements are the most unreliable of all, even, or particularly, in the simplest things: indeed, defending him often entails attacking his words. Official documents were rarely obtainable and these are notoriously unreliable in a country that until recently has made a fine art of fictionalizing accounts. The best I could do was to follow Croce’s advice, try to inject myself into the hearts and minds of the real people who have become my “characters,” and hope that they will at least agree that we saw the same movie.

1. Fantasy At ten minutes before one on Wednesday afternoon, May 8, 1906, Roberto Gastone Zeffiro Rossellini began a life of adventure, conveniently, in one of Rome’s wealthier families. The Rossellinis, besides being debonair, gay and fashionable, were bohemian, quixotic and outré, and always prodigal. It was entirely to one person that their fortune was due: the oddly-named Zeffiro (“zephyr”) who, having no children of his own, had taken his nephew into his house and business, married him to his mistress’s stunningly beautiful niece, and assumed the title of nonno (“grandfather”) to their children. Appropriately, his name had been passed down to the first-born. Zeffiro Rossellini had risen from poverty. Born in 1848 of peasant stock and orphaned while young, he raised his brothers Luigi and Ferdinando while working as a bricklayer near Pisa in his native Tuscany. Around 1870 he moved south to Rome. The city was small then, with barely 200,000 inhabitants, and it stank of misery, with people living ten-to-a-room in certain districts. But a Piedmontese army, blowing a hole through the old Roman walls at Porta Pia, had just put an end to the Popes’s thousand-year rule and announced the first unification of Italy since the ancient empire. Since the Romans were unenthusiastic, regarding the Piedmontese as foreign occupiers and “Italy” as some new-fangled concoction of the devil, the new government, to win their sympathy, began spending vast sums on spectacular buildings. Forty thousand officials had to be housed in the new capital, a rail line was built to link Rome with the prosperous north, and masses of immigrants poured in from the impoverished south. Zeffiro became a contractor, gentrified his name from Rosellini to Rossellini, and rode the crest of the boom. In the next decades Rome’s population would triple, land speculation would skyrocket, and new construction would bury the old baroque city beneath a new modern one. Zeffiro built railroads in Puglia and houses and office buildings in Rome. He was the first to stretch the city beyond the Aurelian walls into the Parioli countryside, where most middle-class Romans live today. He was tall, imposing, and elegant, with a florid Umbertine mustache and terrifying authority. But to his “grandchildren” he was sweet and indulgent. Each morning they would troupe into his bedroom, kiss him, and get a fond smack on the cheek in return. They were awed by him. Nonno had even been a garibaldino. True, he had been dragged back home only a few days after running off to join Giuseppe Garibaldi’s campaign of 1866. Yet he had worn, however briefly, the famous red shirt that the followers of the man who “made” Italy wore, and this shirt, for him, as later for Roberto, meant glory and freedom—Garibaldi’s republican freedom. The “junk,” as Zeffiro called the royal arms of the House of Savoy,

was glaringly absent from the center of the tri-color flag he flew during World War I—letting it wave boldly from his carriage as he rode around Rome, and attracting not a few stares. He had gotten to know Garibaldi during the impecunious soldier’s last years and would send him woolen socks, underwear, and money. Befriending the sons as well, he became Menotti Garibaldi’s executor. Garibaldi memorabilia formed a shrine in his studio—letters, pictures, a sword, the famous boot shot through at the battle of Aspromonte, and most sacred of all, in its small round frame, a piece of the hero’s beard. All through their childhood this relic held Roberto and his brother Renzo in thrall: one day, if they behaved, said Zeffiro, the beard would be theirs. Liberty was Zeffiro’s religion and would be the leitmotif of Roberto’s films. Zeffiro had built himself a large residence at Via Nerva, 1, in Piazza Sallustio, where Roberto was born, followed by Renzo (February 2, 1908) and sister Marcella (September 9, 1909). The palazzo marked the city’s farthest limits at the time. Elegant Via Veneto lay a few blocks to the east, but a dirt cycling course could be glimpsed to the west and, beyond that, toward Porta Pia, vineyards and artichoke fields. “There were empty lots and gardens all around us, and wide sections of the Aurelian wall,” Roberto recalled. “On the Pincio there were still goat herds, vineyards, cows and dairies. The old quarters with their orange and rust-colored houses hadn’t been torn down yet.”1 The characteristic sound was not today’s constant revving of engines but the occasional rhythmic clatter of horse hooves and carriage wheels along pebbled streets. Rome was renowned for its quiet. “Our home,” recalled Roberto, “was full of happiness. And imagination. Unrestrained fantasy. My parents didn’t try to restrain this fantasy. They encouraged it. Fantasy in everything, games of the wildest imagination. We weren’t a traditional family. We didn’t try to hold on to anything, not even our wealth. We spent immediately.”2 Rome was a puritanically modest society. The nouveaux riches Rossellinis were regarded as eccentric. They enjoyed showing off their wealth, flinging their money around in a city of impoverished people. They displayed themselves in a rotogravure where their darling children, who had won a beauty contest, were gamboling naked on a bed. They assumed the mores of a noble house. Breakfast, dinner, supper, they kept an open table; people of all sorts—

from Roman princes to impoverished painters—were free to drop by and eat even when the family was away. Roberto’s father Beppino (né Angiolo Giuseppe) often came home with a dozen unanticipated guests. Elettra, Roberto’s mother, never knew who anyone was. “Sometimes I just couldn’t stand it,” she said, “and I’d run back home to my mother.”3 For the children it was great fun and wonderful training for the future. “The house was always full of intellectuals and artists,” said Roberto. “I never saw a businessman there. So I grew up in a rather special atmosphere.”4 “Roberto had personality and agility,” Renzo recalled. “As first-born he also enjoyed unconfessed but instinctive protection from our parents, especially from mama. He was brown-haired, with eyes as sharp as pins…, all nervous, restless, aggressive and volatile. I was just the opposite: blond, quiet, submissive, easily contented.… For friend and plaything Roberto had me; for companion and despot I had him.… My attachment to him was morbid.… It was as though I took my first steps only to run after [him].”5 The boys had a battlefield in their playroom, with mountains, bridges, tunnels, shrubbery, and a railway all around, inaugurated in 1911 when Italy went to war against Turkey. Roberto had a wondrous sword, Renzo, twenty months younger, just a toothpick, and he had to be a Turk. Worse, Roberto would fire lead balls at him from a great big cannon, and Renzo had to fight back with a popgun and cork bullets. Roberto got what he wanted, always. For one period, he refused to go out without wearing a leash, because he had decided he was a dog. Elettra was helpless; the rest of the family followed in the wake of maternal submission. Once he had a tantrum returning from a party; he went rigid, threw himself on the street, tore his brand new clothes to shreds; and everyone stared helplessly. (Renzo tried the same thing, but Donato the butler just picked him up and carried him home.) On another occasion Roberto’s desire for a stupendous rocking horse in the window of the corner toy store did require a two-month campaign, and perhaps for this reason within hours of receiving it, he had torn off its ears and crinnel and tail, and had turned its belly into a soup kettle. Roberto Rossellini would owe his success to tenaciousness and charm. He 3. Quoted in Ingrid Bergman and Alan Burgess, Ingrid Bergman: My Story (New York: Dell, 1980), p. 336.

would chart the course of human history in terms of our innate impulse for freedom. “My mother was a housewife,” said Roberto, “very near-sighted, very timid, and very funny. It was impossible not to get along with her.”6

Elettra was

tender but nervous, passing quickly from laughter to tears to laughter. When provoked, she’d administer little slaps then smother them in kisses. She was still slapping Roberto long after he reached adulthood. “I was strongly attached to both my parents, but in different ways. Toward my mother I felt tenderness, toward my father, deepest admiration. He was an exceptional man.”7 . He was the only one to interfere with Roberto’s tyranny. For example Roberto, to get to sleep at the hunting lodge at Ladispoli, had established that each night the carriage would be brought out and harnessed; Aunt Fortù would mount up front beside the coachman and blow her hunting horn (ta-too, ta-too, ta-too), and off they would gallop into the night, whereupon little Roberto, in his mother’s arms in back, would blissfully drift off to sleep. And all went well until the evening Beppino arrived unexpectedly, nearly rammed the horn down Fortù’s throat and, hoisting and spanking the startled Roberto, hauled him off to bed. Yet, ritual morning kisses and special occasions aside, Roberto’s father was seldom around. He had his business, a social life, and lady friends. Elettra, who had borne Roberto at seventeen, was eight years her husband’s junior, virtually confined to the house by the semi-cloistered mores of the day, and utterly incapable of coping with her children. “We were all too much for her,” said Marcella.8 Roberto agreed: “I still remember the prayer she used to have us children recite with her in chorus. She’d say, ‘Those mothers, those wives, who have suffered so many torments, Jesus, you who love them, help them in your mercy.’”9 Their daily care was relegated to Donato, the dozen servants, and a succession of governesses. Only at Sunday supper did the children eat with their parents, until they were ten or eleven. The father so admired was thus somewhat distant, and the mother so tender was slightly withheld. The result, in a child as demanding and undisciplined as Roberto, was insecurity and guilt. At six, he agreed to wear an angel costume he loathed in a church procession, on condition that he not be seen in it by his mother, but

when he spotted her hiding behind a column, he ran sobbing to clutch her, then erupted in fury. He tore off his wings, kicked everyone within reach, shrieked and shouted, and had to be dragged outside. But he wasn’t punished. Elettra blamed herself for breaking her word. At seven he was still wetting his bed (“I perspired,” he would explain). Even when he was thirteen: “I have a vivid memory of the traumatic reaction I had the day my mother, a very gentle person, came home with her [lovely, long] hair bobbed.”10 He cried for hours. Gentle Elettra had been caught up by the suffragette movement. She had a healthy, ironic wit, would eventually find a life outside the family cloister, and would leave her husband in 1926. The children, unaware of any unquenched needs, would recall their childhoods in heavenly terms. They themselves would become parents conspicuous for spasmodic eruptions into, but general absence from, their children’s lives. The governesses represented a tapestry of languages. The first governess was French, Léontine Niaudeaux, and for this reason French, not Italian, was the first language the children learned and the language that was spoken in the family. “Allez, mes enfants,” Léontine would say. Although she used the elevator herself, she insisted that the children walk. (In contrast to everyone else in Rome the eccentric Rossellinis lived on the top floors of their huge palazzo and rented out the lower ones.) Then came Margaretha, a German. Beppino admired German culture and literature; but the language was quickly forgotten when the First World War began. “Mademoiselle,” a Frenchwoman, came next; then an English governess, pale and terribly thin after her six-month escape from Russia’s revolution; then soon after another English girl, Mabel, who so quickly succumbed to Roberto’s charms that she learned Italian, but no one learned English. Among themselves, the children had their “secret” language. The butler Donato, an ex-soldier from Tuscany, personified professional pride and total dedication, according to Renzo. No Rossellini would ever expect anything less. Donato was paid 25 lire a month (four dollars in 1918) and never took an hour off. In white tie he served the elegant evening meal, then sat upright and impeccable in the hallway until Beppino or Zeffiro came home— often at two or three in the morning. Otherwise he devoted his time to the children. He took the boys to Villa Borghese where he taught them to ride bicycle and race hard; he gave them their baths, walked them home from the Regina Elena school on Via Puglie, told them stories, defended them against

their parents’ (often justified) anger, and, above all, taught them not to take life’s difficulties too heavily to heart—though here, again, the judgment is Renzo’s: others would say the Rossellinis took life’s difficulties with inveterate hysteria. Donato’s good humor left him prey to the boys’ exuberance, but he never lost patience—except once. That occasion was the Royal Derby, the year’s social highlight, which was all the more special in that the cloistered ladies of those days had few opportunities to sport themselves. Elettra decided to go by car—a show-offy display indeed. Cars were expensive: a good auto worker might earn 1500 lire a year but a car cost 15,000 to buy and 10,000 a year to maintain. Only 7000 cars were to be found in all of Italy. Of course the Rossellinis were among the first to have one in Rome, which had been Beppino’s idea. Elettra preferred the carriage with its coachman and lackey, but for Derby Day it occurred to her that dignity might be maintained by placing Donato in the coachman’s livery beside the uniformed chauffeur. The coachman was a small man, alas, and Donato, after squeezing into the livery, scarcely dared move lest he burst out of it. Roberto and Renzo teased him mercilessly at the track, pulling his tails and knocking off his top hat and kicking it around like a ball, and Donato, running after the hat, split open his pants. Still he clung to the dignity of his profession and, home at last, opened the door for Elettra with customary reserve. The boys merrily snatched apart his tails to show the burst pants and Donato, mortified to tears, ripped off the top hat, the white cotton gloves, and the liveried tail coat, and bashed them to the ground with blasphemy. The boys went into hysterics. Elettra, proper, refined, yet nearsightedly oblivious to all that had transpired, demanded, “Donato! Explain your vulgar behavior!” Even getting the car started was an adventure. Its chain transmission so wore out Fernando the chauffeur that a muscle-bound mason had to traipse over every morning from Beppino’s workyard to give the “Fides” its morning crank up. For the 25-mile drive to Ladispoli milk cans full of gasoline had to be loaded onto the rear—none would be found en route—and a good supply of spare tires as well. Astride this mountain perched Donato, a rifle slung on his shoulder. Elettra, her maid, Renzo, and Marcella sat on the back seats, Roberto up front. “Faster! Faster!” he’d shout every time they encountered a horse and gig. “Slowly, Fernando, go slowly!” Elettra would admonish from the back. Rare was the trip without a flat tire or two or three; replacing them was a dirty, exhausting job, for wheels could not be removed as today: tire and tube had to be manipulated directly on the chassis, after which the air pump, leaking everywhere when it worked at all, required four or five hands to operate. The Fides would boil over on steep hills, and everyone except Elettra would get out and walk behind. They wore raincoat-like coveralls, so dusty were the roads,

and rubber goggles that left black residue on their faces for days afterward. Tasty snacks, when tires were being changed or the radiator cooling, made the long waits more endurable. Donato, with his gun, stood guard by the roadside for, in Elettra’s opinion, it was at such moments that the brigands were mostly likely to attack. In reality no brigands existed. But Elettra—timid in any case and inspired in this instance by a Bartolomeo Pinelli print, The Brigands of the Roman Countryside, that hung at home—had convinced herself and her children that attack was imminent. She had heard a noise one night at Ladispoli when everyone was asleep. Tiptoeing to the window, she fired a hunting gun into the air and screamed, “Donato! Donato! To arms! The brigands are here!” Dogs, hens, and ducks awoke for miles around. A candle was found, guns were distributed to young and old, and an armed vigil was maintained till dawn. This small house near the beach of Ladispoli, to which Zeffiro’s bizarre mistress Fortù had been exiled by universal decree, was the least of the family properties. A little south of Anzio was Circeo, an entire peninsula complete with a papal title, “Baron of San Felice Circeo,” which Zeffiro had contemptuously bestowed on his dog. Then there were blocks of land in central Rome, including a palazzo on Via Boncompagni where Elettra had lived before her marriage, and various three- or four-storied villas. The one at Ardenza, a fashionable sea resort, had a sober elegance. Another just south of Rome between Frascati and Grottaferrata so enchanted the children with its three acres of gardens, lake, and cane forest that Renzo named it The Garden of Klingsor and Roberto forty years later would try to lure Marcella to India by telling her it was “another Grottaferrata.” Zeffiro liked to wheel and deal. He would build a new villa with great enthusiasm, then quickly get bored, sell it, and start another. In design, however, each was unremarkable as the next. The children were aware of their advantages. From the top floor at Piazza Sallustio they looked down on the little paint store where their actual grandfather, Beppino’s father Luigi, made a modest living selling paint to Zeffiro, his brother and only customer. Luigi lived a few blocks away, across Via XX Settembre, in a sad, dark, fifth-floor apartment with no elevator, no radiators, and a tin bathtub that had to be filled by hand. It was a typical middle-class home of the time, but it contrasted badly with Zeffiro’s lordly splendor and modern conveniences. Luigi was a true bohemian; he asked little of life and enjoyed himself to the hilt. With easel, paints, and brushes, he would wander out into the countryside and lose himself staring at dawns, noons, and evenings. He painted for the love of it, in the bright, contrasty style of the macchiaioli, always landscapes with colorful birds in them, because Luigi was a passionate hunter and carried a gun along with his easel. Between shots, he would sketch

canvases that for the most part he left unfinished. Optimistic, expansive, and pleasure-loving, he was also a diabetic. But dieting was impossible for someone who spent his day’s happiest hours at table eating highly spiced country fare like spaghetti all’amatriciana with authentic pecorino, lamb or chicken alla cacciatora, and saddle of pork with raw broccoletti fried in oil, garlic, and red pepper. These were prepared by Natalina, a feisty peasant who ruled the house. She had served the family for 48 years (for five lire a month, which she never received) and called everyone tu rather than the formal Lei (driving Roberto’s mother up the wall),

Luigi’s wife, Giuseppina Benedetti, Roberto’s

grandmother, was an invalid who suffered through a succession of operations over many years and quarreled endlessly with Natalina in between. Roberto and Renzo, accustomed as they were to the refined service and precise etiquette on which their mother insisted, were embarrassed by Luigi’s shabby surroundings and Natalina’s way of putting the food on the table in big dishes and leaving everyone free to help themselves. They begrudged the second-class seats Luigi bought them at movies and the single mandarin punch they were given to share between them at the Caffè dell’Indipendenza afterward, where Luigi stopped to swap hunting yarns with other old men. But they cherished their grandfather’s good humor, his long, wonderful bedtime stories (an inspiration for the stories Roberto would tell), and his zest at table. As he drank, he sang “Viva il vino spumeggiante” (“Hooray for sparkling wine”) from Cavalleria rusticana, or a ditty that went: Our fathers drank! Our mothers drank! We’re their children! Let’s drink too! Then, over pears and cheese, Natalina would come sit and listen, and Luigi would begin to recite Dante, at length, with wide-ranging tone and emotion, and eventually crying rivers of tears and drawing his listeners into his grief too, until there was nary a sound in all the room except sobbing. The play between fantasy and reality that so characterized the Rossellinis and that would haunt Roberto’s films was typical of Italy as a whole. In the Italy of his youth, poverty was of stupendous proportions. Hundreds of thousands lived in caves or mud huts. Few of the women and children who constituted the bulk of the industrial work force and even fewer of the agricultural workers earned a living wage. Thousands died each year of malaria; many regions lacked drinkable water. Half the population was illiterate—eighty percent in parts of the south. Most people could not even hope for a job unless they left Italy. So eight million did, between 1871 and 1914—100,000 a year in

1876, 500,000 in 1901, 872,000 (or one in forty) in 1913. Italy was providing no opportunity for her people. Such facts were ignored. Segments of Italian society were as modern and prosperous as any on earth. Well-off citizens like the Rossellinis gave less thought to poverty than well-off Californians do to Alabama blacks today. Modern Italians were looking to the future. The new Italy was rising up around them. Why think about things that were shameful and humiliating? Haunted by centuries of foreign contempt, manipulation and occupation, they sought to forge a national identity and to claim in international affairs the parity with England and France they believed they deserved. To achieve these ends, they recognized only dimly the need for internal development. Self assertion and conquest abroad seemed more immediately important. “Italy must not only be respected,” declared King Vittorio Emanuele II, “She must make herself feared.” Cavour’s final word on Garibaldi took a similar stance: “Garibaldi has rendered to Italy the greatest service that a man could render her: he has given the Italians confidence in themselves: he has proved to Europe that Italians can fight and die on the battlefield to reconquer a fatherland.”11 Italian foreign policy followed a consistent course from unification through Mussolini; it was a reaction to the humiliating impression that Italy owed its unity to gifts from Garibaldi and Napoleon III. Thus in 1866 when Austria offered to cede Venice, Italy went to war anyhow, to conquer it. In 1911 when Turkey accepted an Italian ultimatum to cede Libya, Italy went to war anyhow, to conquer it. In 1915 when Austria offered to cede Trent, Trieste and Fiume to keep Italy out of the First World War, Italy went to war anyhow, to conquer them. To assert herself as a great power was everything. Twenty years later Mussolini, too, would be unable to resist the call to glory. How many died to “prove” something to Europe? The glory was façade. Italy was no great power. She lacked natural resources, industrial production, capital, and an educated or disciplined citizenry. In Ethiopia in 1896 her army was massacred. In Libya her troops huddled in a few coastal citadels. In World War I more than 650,000 Italians were killed, half a million were mutilated, another million wounded, and 148 billion lire was spent—twice the total of all government expenditures since 1861. After so pointless a waste, glory would seem more important than ever and failure to achieve it would be blamed on foreign powers. Self-delusion was the

kernel of Italian politics, in reaction to centuries of foreign occupation, papal repression, stultifying provincialism, military ineptitude, and economic powerlessness against the world-wide aggrandizement of England, France, and America. Hold onto your idea, it was believed, and you can achieve anything. Had not the Risorgimento—that “revolution of the disinherited, of the starry eyed”12—shown this was true? Tiny bands of ex-officers, doctors, lawyers, writers, and students had pushed and pulled Italy into unity, against the desires not only of the Church and the land-owning aristocracy, but of most of the populace as well. And these same starry-eyed leaders had been ruling ever since by virtual martial law, implementing liberal ideas with violent methods and seeing themselves as the historical agents for releasing the subconscious desires of the Italian nation. They were still ruling now. Mussolini would be their heir. In Germany it was the military establishment that had created the nation. In Italy it was the poets. Germany had been forged of steel, Italy of dreams. War would give their dreams substance, Italy’s poet statesmen believed, and would bind and invigorate national character. Gabriele D’Annunzio, the era’s dominant literary figure, evoked the Roman Empire and preached that Nietzschean-like supermen were above morality. “Man the prow and sail toward the world!” he shouted. Marinetti’s 1909 Futurist Manifesto equally extolled conquest and power, preaching how poetry and violence spring from an identical impulse, how war is the world’s sole purifier. Democracy, justice, the sacredness of life—these were degenerate idiocies concocted by and for the weakest and least worthy elements of society. (In America, the argument for entry into World War I was almost identical. War would “forge a national soul”; give birth to “a new religion of vital patriotism—that is, of consecration to the State”; imbue citizens with “a strong sense of international duty.” War, above all, would bring about a “change in the whole attitude of the people.” It would create a New America, one in which citizens would ask not what their country could do for them but what they could do for their country.13) Philosophically Italy’s leaders had started out as liberals and still called themselves that, although they no longer were. In theory they were slowly pushing Italian society toward a vision in which restriction of any sort was minimal, competition and “harmonious discord” were encouraged, and each individual might fulfill his idiosyncratic potential. This was the ideology that Roberto Rossellini grew up in, and that he would endeavor to propagate through

his films by combining art with ideological agenda in the age-long Italian fashion. But during all the decades preceding World War I, the masses had been unfriendly and reactionary, a drag against progress. The Church was hostile and forbade Catholics to vote. Labor opposed any bourgeois government and refused all cooperation. Parliament was hopelessly factionalized and debated interminably without ever agreeing to anything. Thus the “liberals” ineluctably succumbed to the conclusion that liberty would have to be imposed through dictatorial methods, iconoclasm and war—the techniques validated by the Risorgimento. In so polarized a society government was possible only through trasformismo, a policy whereby opposition leaders were given seats in the ruling coalition and successive ministries were brought to power by slight shifts to the right or the left: it perpetuated a ruling class, accommodated moderate change, and avoided extremes (and it is still the rule in Italy today). But as the elite joined the power clique, they sacrificed their followers and principles to tactical expediency, left a residue of cynicism, and confused any clear conflict between alternative policies. Given the intransigent, permanently discordant nature of Italy’s rival ideologies, politics, and class interests, such tactical expediency was a necessity and confusion of conflict was a step toward cooperation. But trasformismo instituted corruption and ineffectualness (also still the rule today), and created a parliament that was happiest when a strong leader came along to monopolize responsibility. Even wholehearted republicans like Garibaldi favored dictatorship out of frustration. Thus successive ministers—Cavour, Depretis, Crispi, and Giolitti—promulgated laws by decree and then had them confirmed retroactively by parliament (also still the practice in Italy today). At all times Italy’s elite overwhelmingly deplored the ways by which policy was implemented. But few disagreed with the broad outlines of that policy and almost no one opposed the assumptions that underlay it. Thus Fascism, when it came, seemed, like Woodrow Wilson’s quashing of free speech during the World War, a necessary expediency at a time of crisis. The Italy Mussolini would inherit was already functioning: a police state that was authoritarian and corrupt; a government that survived by manipulating defects and weaknesses; a population that was prosaic and pedestrian; a ruling class inspired by the highest ideals. When the First World War broke out, Italy stayed out, in accord with the desires of most of parliament and almost all of the public. Strident voices, however, demanded intervention. Sympathies sided with France and against Germany and Austria, despite Italy’s nominal partnership with the latter in the Triple Alliance. In the Rossellini home, Beppino’s pro-neutrality caused violent

clashes with the ultra patriotic Zeffiro. Ten long months passed, with mounting slaughter in northern Europe and mounting pressure for intervention in Italy. Beppino was overheard whistling Wagner on a trolley and escaped a beating only by claiming (falsely) that he had been whistling German music in scorn. Finally Italy was thrust into the war by executive decree. Prime Minister Salandra and Foreign Minister Sonnino, succumbing to territorial bribes dangled by the Entente, deceived the cabinet, signed a treaty with England and had the King issue a war decree. They mobilized violent street demonstrations, brought D’Annunzio back from France to excite war fervor, and, when parliament at last was allowed to convene, arranged for mobs to storm its buildings. Giolitti, the nation’s leading politician, had opposed the war. Now the King threatened to abdicate and Giolitti caved in. National honor was at stake and effective opposition impossible. Italians flocked to the colors. “A great élan of patriotic zeal [shook] the entire city,” Roberto recalled. “We were fighting against the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, we were going to free the irredentist provinces. Not a day passed without parades, speeches, and demonstrations, even in the school I went to. How could anyone resist such a wave?”14 Beppino was mobilized as an industrialist to construct air camps at Montecelio and Furbara. On occasional weekends he was able to visit his family. Roberto and Renzo, nine and seven, were all for war. At school the beadle would announce the end of class by crying, “Finis! Death to Giolitti!” and the children would march home chanting mournfully, “Down with the Austrian flag! Death to Franz Josef! Long live Oberdan!” (Oberdan, from Austrian-occupied Trieste, had tried to assassinate the Austrian emperor Franz Josef in 1870.) At home they set up their playroom battlefield. On Thursdays and Sundays they went off to a meadow near Via Brescia for military training with the “Young Explorers.” When gawking street boys attacked with stones, the uniformed Explorers retaliated with broccoli-stick bayonets salvaged from the dumpings of a nearby market. Roberto’s pugnacious grandmother lived across the meadow and would yell threats and curses helplessly from her balcony. (This was Elettra’s mother, Amalia del Monte, a Roman from Anagni. She had separated from Giuseppe Bellan, a wealthy grain merchant whose French ancestors had established themselves in Rovigo, near Venice, during the Napoleonic wars. It was so that she would avoid her parents’ quarrels that Elettra had originally been sent to Rome.) Zeffiro’s other nephew, Eugenio (his brother Ferdinando’s son), was 25, sixfoot-three, a grenadier captain stationed in Tripoli, and frustrated. Feisty old

Zeffiro had wanted this new war, but now he refused to listen to Eugenio’s requests for help in obtaining transfer to the Alpine front, where the fighting was. The war entered its second year, however, and the need for soldiers grew, so Eugenio got his transfer all the same. At dinner at Grottaferrata that May Beppino was telling a story about Mascagni, when the doorbell rang, “signorino Eugenio” was announced, and the table fell silent and still. Beppino went to the door and returned. “Eugenio’s leaving,” he said softly. “He’s here to kiss us goodbye.” Eugenio walked in, smiling. Everyone else was close to tears. Beppino poured some wine and handed him a glass. “Let us drink,” he said, “to your health, to your glory, to our country’s victory.” Elettra started to cry. The children were still awake past midnight when their father got back from the station. “Go to bed,” he said. “Eugenio’s glad to be going. He’s happy and confident. Italy needs soldiers like him.” On Mount Cengio every foot of advance or retreat cost mountains of corpses and Eugenio lasted less than 48 hours. “I can still hear the howl of pain that erupted from nonno Zeffiro,” wrote Renzo, who was eight at the time. “That a grandfather of that mettle could cry like that tells us something of the tragedy we passed through. I remember that elegant, austere, Umbertine monument of a man collapsed in his armchair, while my mother laid cold compresses to his forehead.”15 The casualties mounted by the tens of thousands. Rome’s gas lamps were painted blue. Only women, children and old men were to be seen. The beadle at school, with four sons at the front, grew meek and quiet. Fear and heartbreak replaced enthusiasm. Bread tickets became sacred documents, symbols of the nation’s united effort. Then in 1917 Germany locked Lenin in a train and shipped him to Russia. They hoped he would undermine the government and he did. The Russian front collapsed, and fifteen German and Austrian divisions were shifted to Caporetto in Italy, where in October an offensive devastated the Italian army. One quarter of a million men were captured in twelve days; twice as many more were killed, wounded, or missing. The 700,000 who survived retreated precipitously one hundred miles to the river Piave. The German army was twenty miles from Venice. But the nation rallied as one, and the worst military disaster in modern Italian history was followed by its most heroic resistance. Renzo recalls how he and Roberto helped make socks and scarves to send up to the front, and ingegnosi—strips of rolled-up newspaper covered with wax, which burnt slowly and could be used to warm soldiers’ mess kits. Then one evening Donato came home late, wearing a uniform several sizes too small. The

children burst into tears. Even at 41, overweight, and one-eyed, Donato was in better shape than most conscripts from the South. Yet instead of being sent into battle or even out of Rome, he was assigned to valet a general in a nearby ministry! Well! It was one thing to lose one’s best servant, the children’s best friend, to Italy in her direst hour. It was quite another to lose him to a gentleman. Beppino befriended the general and an arrangement was worked out. For the next year, Donato’s days were divided in two. In the summer of 1918 the army withstood a new Austrian push on the Piave, then counter-attacked and, exactly a year after Caporetto, won the decisive battle of Vittorio Veneto. The war was over. Rome’s Via Veneto was renamed Via Vittorio Veneto. Italy had a victory at last. The Rossellinis moved twice during the war. They left Piazza Sallustio in 1916 for a temporary apartment adjoining the Hotel Carlton (which Zeffiro then owned) on Via Collina, just around the corner. Marcella woke up one morning there and saw the house walls across the street severing apart; it was the Avezzano earthquake. The new home was ready in 1917, constructed by the Rossellinis of course: a huge building at Via Ludovisi 16, just off Via Veneto. The entire block including the Hotel Regina (across Via Veneto from the present American embassy) was theirs. Once again they lived on the upper floors. Beppino spent the postwar years in Venice. In partnership with a Swiss company run by brothers named Sleiter, he reconstructed the bridge over the Piave at Priula, rebuilt areas of Conegliano, Spresiano, and Nervesa devastated by the war, and in Padua built the model “Garden City” quarter. He fell madly in love with Venice. Each day, though exhausted at work, he would wander for hours in the city’s narrow streets, and during his weekend visits to Rome would try to share his discoveries with his children. “The men of action of that time,” wrote Renzo, “combined the religion of work with an intense spirituality, a renascent humanism that expressed itself in passionate love of art.… The first time I went to Venice, I was shaking with excitement, so great was the spell my father had cast over me. But…when I woke…and saw the lagoon appear through the train window, the sight was more wonderful than any I’ve imagined before or since; I felt a sense of stupor, of magic, of enchantment.”16 To be near Beppino, the family passed part of the summer at a villa on the Venice Lido. Elettra bore her last child there in 1922, Micaela, nicknamed Micci (Mee-chee). Renzo also lived for a time with his father in Venice proper, where he became deeply involved with music; at fifteen he published the first of many works for Ricordi, a song. He had lost the phalanx in one finger when he was

little, when Roberto had accidentally closed a folding chair, and this had made a career as a pianist impossible.17 Marcella studied art in Rome. She went each day to a studio on Via Margutta, accompanied by her governess, as custom demanded. (A young woman would no more go out without her governess than without her hat.) But musicians outnumbered artists at Via Ludovisi, for music was Beppino’s primary passion, as well as Renzo’s. The composer Mascagni was a family friend, Molinari, Respighi, Alfano, and Zandonai came also; and Marcella first heard herself addressed as signorina by Puccini himself. On Sundays, Renzo and Marcella, and occasionally Roberto, attended matinees at the opera. The new operas they usually knew even before their premieres, having played them at home on the piano. Roberto staged plays at home: mime dramas accompanied by piano or dramas of the French revolution. He adored fancy dress, and would take so long fussing over the wigs and costumes of his cousins Luisa and Renzo Avanzo (drafted for the occasion) that just as they were ready, it would be time to go home. The red velvet curtains in the hallway formed a sort of proscenium. Once Donato walked through them into a duel between Roberto and his brother, and Renzo’s bamboo sword tipped over Donato’s tray and hit him in his one good eye. It looked as though he would lose his sight entirely. Roberto took the blame and resolved to say five thousand “Hail Marys” every night for a miracle. Donato’s eye was saved, but not due to Roberto. He kept falling asleep before completing his daily quota and soon became hundreds of thousands of “Hail Marys” behind. To opera, theater, music and art, Roberto preferred the movies. He went every day, often twice a day. He had a free pass to the Corso Cinema which his father had built in 1918. It was the first large, modern movie house in Rome, the first with a roof that could be slid open on hot summer nights. Called the Étoile today, it was then the center of Rome’s movie world. Douglas Fairbanks and stars from all over the world would come see it when visiting Rome. Roberto met many of them. “So I saw it born, the cinema, I saw it born from Griffith,” he said, when he was 66.18 Sometimes, using his pass, he’d take his whole class to the movies. Roberto and Renzo had transferred in the fall of 1917 to the Collegio Nazareno, a school for privileged boys run by the Scolopi fathers. Several of their schoolmates went on to distinguished careers: Giorgio Amendola a Communist

Party leader, Guglielmo Ceroni a top reporter for Il Messaggero, Marcello Pagliero an actor and filmmaker, Giovanni Mosca a brilliant journalist, Sergio Fenoaltea an ambassador, and another a cardinal. Roberto, having flunked the spring term at the Tasso School, was the oldest in his class by age but the furthest behind academically, and he scorned to wear the school’s Etonesque uniform. He took Italian, Latin, and Greek (both written and oral), history and geography, French, mathematics, and natural history. His grades were never better than the lowest possible for passing, and even these were obtained through charm rather than scholarship. A classmate, Franco Riganti, recalls him as lazy, perpetually dreaming and distracted, but as more intelligent than most and fascinating even to his peers.19 In Roberto’s opinion school was utter damnation. “Those years were absolutely wild, horrible and cruel. It was so boring! I learned to sleep with my eyes opened and fixed on my schoolmaster.”20 Paradoxically, though, he esteemed his teachers—Alberto M. Ghisalberti in history, Pietro Paolo Trompeo in Italian, and the famous Dante scholar Luigi Pietrobono, who, defying Croce, championed the poetic role of allegory in the Divine Comedy. Boredom inspired Roberto to miss school as often as possible. Ill health resulted in absences of long duration. He seemed prone to every possible disease. He caught malaria at Ladispoli, a mild form of cholera at Ardenza, got appendicitis at Bocca d’Arno in 1918, and that fall missed an entire trimester at Nazareno. The following winter, 1919-1920, at the end of a three-year influenza epidemic that claimed half a million lives in Italy—27 million worldwide—Roberto’s lungs became infected. For three months the thirteenyear-old hung between life and death. Part of one lung was removed in an operation and Elettra, only 31 and at the peak of her beauty, vowed to the madonna to wear black all the rest of her life if her son were spared. He was and she did. She looked stunning in black and permitted herself mauve as well. Roberto spent a year convalescing, missing two-thirds of the 1919–1920 school year and all of 1920–1921. Then he damaged his kidneys. This occurred at Cortina d’Ampezzo in the Dolomites, where the Rossellinis had been spending their Augusts since 1919. A popular resort today, it was an unknown region then, and Beppino took his family exploring in a chauffeurdriven touring car. The children were thrilled to see real snow for the first time. They saw shrapnel, too, and a skeleton uncovered by melting snow. In these Nibelungen valleys two armies had struggled for more than two years without

advance or retreat. Now the dead of both sides kept company in numerous small cemeteries, where white Italian crosses stood beside grey Austrian ones. Here and there some crosses had messages written on them like “Mama, I’m here.” In August 1921 Beppino and his children decided to climb a glacier that churned down a ravine between the first and second Tofana. Having driven to the tree line along a stream bed, they started hiking up a rocky stretch of ground toward the ice. The glacier had seemed close by, but it took several hours to reach it. Once there, however, enthusiasm sprouted wings and they leapt up along the ice flow. High up the glacier Renzo, suddenly faint, stumbled and started to fall. Although he caught his balance, he had startled ten-year-old Marcella, so that she fell almost straight down, sliding like a bullet 350 yards along the ice. Beppino tried to grab her, but she struck him in the chest, turning her feet-first and knocking down her father. He tumbled down too, along with a family friend, Sandro Ferraguti, whom the speeding Marcella also struck. She halted, finally, on rocky ground at the glacier’s base and lay there bruised and bleeding, her clothes in shreds. Her first thought was to see if her watch were still running. It was. Ferraguti landed half conscious in a snow bank. Beppino came to rest gracefully and unhurt beside his daughter. Meanwhile, up on the glacier, thirteen-year-old Renzo looked down and, only now aware of the terrifying height, began to tremble. Roberto, ever resourceful, started using his hands, walking stick, and heels to carve out a niche for himself, and Renzo tried to imitate him. He put his foot on a soft spot, however, and felt himself falling, but was grabbed just in time by the remaining member of the party, a banker from Padua, who held onto him tightly. And like that they stayed the next four hours: Roberto in his niche, Renzo fastened to the banker, Marcella and Ferraguti down below. Only Beppino was able to move. Shouting instructions to wait, he went off for help toward a mountain refuge he suspected was not too far away. They could hear his strong voice echoing through the valleys as he disappeared, “Help! Help!” Then for an eternity there was silence. Back at the car, the chauffeur had woken from a nap, started to worry, and went looking for the family. He found Marcella at the base of the glacier, bleeding and turning blue from the cold, and carried her in his arms to the car, where he revived her by vigorous massage with gasoline. Roberto, Renzo, and the banker, however, waited amid growing desperation until two guides arrived from the refuge. It was late when they got back to Cortina, where Elettra was waiting. Marcella was cut badly, all had frozen fingers and sun-burnt faces. “Let’s sing,”

said Beppino, “and hide our misery.” Roberto was back in school that fall, but with weakened kidneys and persistent pleurisy. In adulthood, physical effects from his adolescent illnesses did not linger; in fact, he was almost never sick at all. But mentally, sickness was a catalyst whereby character traits already present were amplified. Sickness encouraged his love of indulgence. It was nice to miss school, to stroll in the mountains where doctors sent him for his lungs, and to have nothing he had to do. “I remember those days as extraordinarily happy. Taken care of by everyone, babied by everyone, I got along just fine. It was a very fertile period for me from every point of view. It gave my life a new orientation.”21 But such indulgence made the spoiled boy a spoiled man, one who flew into blind rages when frustrated, one who was sporadically disabled by overpowering headaches (which, it seems, were psycho-somatic in origin, although never treated as such). Yet if Rossellini had not had so absolute, so infantile a need to get his way, could he have succeeded to make the films he did? Sickness encouraged insecurity. He became a life-long hypochondriac; his bedside was lined with dozens of little bottles of medicine, all of which travelled with him in a special little suitcase wherever he went; and every year he had a blood transfusion. His hypochondria had a positive side, though. It contributed to his generosity—which was extraordinary in any case, singularly so in one so self–indulgent—toward anyone ill or grieving. It was natural for him to spend the night with a school friend who had lost his parents, or to buy Marcella another dog when Ior, her little Pekinese, died, and to stay up all night with her telling her stories: Ior would surely be reincarnated, he explained, and come back as a man, and one day she might marry him. Roberto had a strong, open energy and people instinctively turned to him in a crisis. Sickness encouraged consciousness of death. Death would be a dominant motif in his films: heroes would die and stare at death in virtually every one and his famous “neo-realism” would evoke sensation of the precious precariousness of each fleeting moment. Off screen Roberto’s nervousness was amplified. Boredom became intolerable. Life had to be challenged, attacked every instant, with reckless speed in a Ferrari, with profligate spending, with unrestrained sexuality, with artistic ambitions as monumental as they were impractical. Thus he accomplished monuments. Obstacles erected by others were rarely as awesome as the fear of the void that impelled him forward. The mere threat of dulled consciousness terrified him: he rarely drank, not even wine; dentists, he

claimed, had to give him extra doses of Novocain to overcome his automatic rejection of numbness of any kind. Roberto’s manic search for security required constant refreshment. His addiction to bed became legendary. Convalescence encouraged his penchant for lying in bed two or three days at a stretch, reading Dumas, Verne, Salgari, Stendhal, Balzac, Dostoyevsky and Tostoy. Home meant family and servants who would do his bidding, baby and mother him. “And so my brother Roberto set off on a great adventure,” wrote Renzo in early childhood, inside the cover of The Great Explorers, their favorite book. “He took along everything he might need. And when he got to the doorman, he cried and came back home.”22

Chapter 2. Youth At war’s end, twelve-year-old Roberto, sheltered in his privileged world, was only dimly aware of the violence and chaos shaping his future. War had not united the nation the way it was supposed to. The working classes were furious. They hadn’t wanted the war. To get them to fight it the government had announced it was a “war for the proletariat” and had promised free land and higher wages.23 But all they got—the million and a half wounded, and the millions of other veterans—was unemployment. The nationalists felt humiliated. The Allies, after rewarding themselves, had reneged on their territorial pledges to Italy—whereupon D’Annunzio had recruited a private army and occupied Fiume. The middle classes were terrified. As prices soared and the lira shrank to seventeen percent of its prewar value, their savings and rental income, along with the war bonds they’d patriotically purchased, became tickets to the poor house. They had been the bulwark of progressive civilization. Now their sons— 200,000 ex-officers—sought work in vain, and bread and coal were severely rationed, while political power was passing into the hands of those who wanted to destroy everything they’d struggled for. Bolshevik revolutions had just occurred in Russia, Germany and Hungary, whetting the thirst for justice of laborers who had been brutally savaged for centuries. As the Socialist chief Pietro Nenni said, “All the extraordinary and clamorous events at the end of 1918 and the beginning of 1919 fired the imagination, and inspired the hope that the old world was about to collapse and that humanity was on the threshold of a new era and a new social order.”24 “I remember,” said Roberto, “how on the First of May the workers would come out in their Sunday clothes, a red flower in the button hole, and go eat outside the city walls.”25 Their leaders were romantic figures from the last century, with flamboyant whiskers, drooping black neckties, and wide-brimmed hats. But their parades, demonstrations, and violent language inspired panic. Having won control of Milan, Bologna, and two-thirds of the rural North, they were transferring contracts to their friends, denouncing the King to his face in parliament, and demanding forced expropriation of capital and a Soviet republic.

flew from churches; Monday replaced Sunday as rest day; children were named not after saints but Ateo, Spartaco, Lenin, Ribellione. Seventeen hundred strikes were called in 1919, nineteen hundred the following year. Looting and windowsmashing became daily events. In one year, 145 people were killed, 444 wounded. Finally the Socialists occupied factories all over the country, tore down the owners’ names, put up pictures of Lenin, and for a month tried to run the companies themselves. The government was helpless. After a nation-crippling, two-month strike by railway and postal workers, it not only capitulated, it paid out back wages for the entire strike period. Theoretically, the government wasn’t supposed to do anything. The liberalism Roberto Rossellini grew up in was supposed to be beyond politics and ethics; or rather, it incorporated them within a complete idea of the world and reality. In liberalism, wrote Benedetto Croce, “is reflected all the philosophy and religion of modern times, centered in the idea of dialectics, that is, of development. By means of the variety and conflict of the spiritual forces, dialectics continuously enriches and ennobles life and imprints upon it its only and complete meaning.”26 In other words, liberalism, rather than allowing select authorities to prescribe the course and curtail conflict, was based on trust in each individual and favored competition and cooperation “in harmonious discord.” Under no circumstances, said Croce, “should we take from man his human faculty of erring and of sinning, without which not even good can be done.… [T]he liberal concept is not meant for the timid, the indolent and the pacifistic.”27 “Trust the individual” became one of Roberto’s pet phrases. But in 1920 there was outrage at the government’s refusal to impose order. Few trusted dialectics to surmount the ideological chasms that were destroying the nation. It seemed, rather, that liberalism was the cause of the collapse. The Liberals had destroyed their own elitist rule by widening the franchise and instituting proportional representation. A majority of seats in parliament had been won by the new mass parties, the anti-clerical Socialists, and the Vatican-run, antiMarxist Popolare, who hated each other as much as they did the industry-backed, anti-clerical Liberals. No working majority was possible. The nation was drifting into endemic civil war. Then toward the end of 1920, amid chaos and despair, disciplined bands of war veterans began to inspire hope and promise order. They vowed to maintain the social hierarchy and repress subversion, to call the deputies to their duty and

rejuvenate the nation. The war had been worth fighting, they insisted, and they pledged to fulfill its revolutionary hopes. Thus they won support from the middle classes and the government, and newspapers portrayed them favorably. They called themselves Fascists. History has condemned them. Countless books, in hindsight after World War II, have told us they were gangsters. And they were. But they rose to power amid tremendous enthusiasm and Italians were loyal to them for twenty years. The Fascists were violent. They yanked red flags off streetcars, poured quarts of castor oil into Bolsheviks, sacked and burnt Socialist newspaper offices, and drove out Socialist farm unions that, in a time of falling prices, were extorting small farmers into hiring more laborers than they needed. And people applauded. Somebody at last was doing something. The destruction, the fires, the beatings and maimings, even the murders were overlooked. Town halls were invaded, socialist councils were forced to resign, and administration of cities all over the north—Ferrara, Rovigo, Bologna, Cremona, Ancona, Terni—was forcibly commandeered. The Socialists, in protest, attempted a half-hearted national strike, whereupon the Fascists grabbed hold of Milan and ran the streetcars themselves, and scored a public relations victory. The Liberal experiment looked dead. The King, the military, and Pius XI refused to oppose the Fascists. The Fascists were saving Italy from Communism; they were the people who could make things work. When Benito Mussolini, the Fascist leader, called for a “March on Rome” if order were not restored, he was invited to form a government. In effect, the Liberals gave up and called in a Strong Man. On October 30, 1922, Mussolini arrived by train from Milan, took a taxi to the Quirinal palace, and presented himself to the King in a black shirt, unpressed trousers, scruffy shoes, and a growth of beard. “I’ve come straight from the battlefield,” he said. The city was a boiling cauldron, Roberto recalled. Bombs were exploding. Civil war was brewing. That evening the street in front of his house, Via Ludovisi, was taken over by black-shirted squadristi carrying hand guns, rifles, and bludgeons. Some policemen took refuge in the Rossellini gateway and were preparing for combat on the stairs. Giant searchlights were shooting their beams into the night. Roberto led Renzo and Marcella down to a ground-floor room where they nailed their faces to the window. Mussolini was about to appear on the balcony of the Hotel Savoia, directly across the street, and they didn’t want to miss his slightest movement. “I was sixteen and excited by the smell of gunpowder.”28

It was then that his father came home, pulled open the door, and shouted, loud enough to be heard across the street, “Remember, kids. Black’s good for hiding dirt.” A few words called everything into question. All Italy was hailing Benito Mussolini. America and England and the whole world, almost, would join the cheering. Parliament, by a three-to-one vote, was about to give him full powers for a year to carry out whatever reforms he thought necessary. His would be the first government in Italian history to be supported by monarchy, army, Church, industry, and middle-class, and he was socialist at heart. The Pope would proclaim him “a man sent us by Providence.” There was every reason for Roberto, Renzo, and Marcella to feel a surge of enthusiasm as Mussolini stepped out onto his balcony. It was to prevent a Bolshevik blood bath that young people from all over Italy had “marched” on Rome; only Communists and a few socialists had offered opposition. Giuseppe Rossellini’s cynicism—or rather, his adoration of liberty, his conviction that Mussolini would be “a dictator, the ruin of us all”29—was a remarkable stand on principle, courageously at odds with his time and class. It was a lesson Roberto would never forget. Ideology—islands of ideology, each claiming transcendence—had destroyed liberal democracy; he would make it his life’s work to destroy ideology. These decisions came later. In the fall of 1921 Roberto was back at the Nazareno. He had kept up his studies with private tutors and, despite 23 days of absence, completed middle school (ginnasio) in 1922. But the following year, in the middle of his second trimester of high school (liceo), he dropped out of Nazareno entirely. The only thing he was learning at school, he realized, was how to fake it. It was a skill he understood already; he knew that his professors, like many people, desired a façade and nothing more. “Fortunately,” as he put it, the Spanish flu intervened when he was thirteen and he spent the next eighteen months in bed with purulent pleurisy. Finally his lungs were cut open. “I was emptied of two kilos of puss—and all the twisted truths, useless facts and dubious methods that, despite myself, I had accumulated at school. I was cured.” Now with a tutor he studied math and physics for pure enjoyment, and would have gone on to the University, except that the University required a high school diploma, which would have meant learning Latin and Greek all over again. “I couldn’t make myself do it.”30 He was sixteen and had become an heir. Bedridden Zeffiro had died in 1924 and bequeathed his fortune to Roberto and Renzo. (Women were generally

excluded from succession. Zeffiro had sighed with relief when Elettra’s fourth child had proved to be female: he would not have to remake his will.) How much this fortune amounted to, we do not know. Besides real estate and investments, there were eight million lire in cash. No one worried about preserving this legacy. In Rome’s decadent upper-class, wealth was to be spent ostentatiously, saving was ignoble. The whole family feasted with hearty appetite, and Roberto gobbled quickest and ate the most. “I did every stupid thing it’s possible to do in that situation between seventeen and twenty. I failed to get my [high school] diploma, I chased girls, I was constantly crazy in love, I competed on motorcycles and automobiles in Fiats, Salmsons, and Amilcars, taking every risk, animated by a rage to live that never subsided day or night. And my father watched me with love.”31 Roberto had piano lessons, too. But compared to Renzo and Marcella, scarcely anything indicated a career in the arts for Roberto. His obsessions were mechanical and sexual. He had a laboratory on the top floor on Via Ludovisi and, with Marcella as his gofer, he busied himself with experiments in solar energy and inventions for racing cars. First came a modified compressor that juiced up a broken down Fiat 509, then a new-fangled spark plug and a fuel-conserving motor, both of which he sold to Bugatti. For friend and counselor he had Baratelli, a passionately serious engineer who wore an elastic band around his forehead, claiming it helped him think—so Roberto wore one too. When Baratelli needed to illustrate a point, he was wont to halt the car wherever it was and, oblivious to traffic whizzing by left and right, get out and draw diagrams on the middle of the road. Roberto got his first car at fifteen, a fire-red Chiribiri. He had been driving since he was nine, taught by his aunt, the baronessa (Maria) Antonietta Avanzo, whom he adored. In complete contrast to her sister, the gentle, feminine Elettra, Antonietta was fiery-eyed, assertive, and a race driver. One of the first women to race in the “Mille Miglia” (in 1928 in a Chrysler 72 and a matching bright red jump suit, retiring after eight hour 50 minutes),32 she had lived in Paris and Australia, was friends with Gianni Agnelli (Fiat) and Enzo Ferrari (whose race cars her Packard inspired), and had been nicknamed Nerissa by D’Annunzio because of her jade-black eyes and hair. When, some decades later, her son (also named Renzo) demanded a halt to her racing, contending it ill-suited for a middle-aged woman, she took up big game hunting in Africa instead. Roberto soon got a Bugatti, started racing at eighteen, and kept at it through

the 1950s. He was fearless. Tires might blow at 150 mph (as one did), or the car might bang into Via Veneto’s Porta Pinciana (as one did), but his hands stayed steady, cool, and calm. Not so Renzo. Fraternal subservience and Roberto’s enthusiasm overcame the terror of riding as mechanic, but Renzo claimed his life-long heart palpitations began then. Sometimes, in desperation, he would turn off the motor or try to press the break pedal, and huge fights would break out. It didn’t matter. Not once in all his life did Roberto finish in the money. He was usually last, with a million good reasons why. Nor was he a winner at selling cars, custom-made ones in the late twenties—a fiasco that ended with Roberto paying off large debts incurred, it is said, by his partner.33 But he was a winner with girls. He claimed his first victory at fourteen (a year before his first car), and thereafter his sister never knew which of her friends were really her own, for everyone she knew was in love with Roberto. It was less his body that attracted them—although he was good looking then, five foot eight with brown eyes—than his charisma and enthusiasm. He found all women irresistible. Certainly there is no rumor of his ever resisting. “I started going to the bordello quite young and would spend whole days there in search of a kind of glory by fucking one after another each of the seven girls who rented their bodies there.”34 Devotion to the flame of the moment was all consuming. When a Yugoslavian rejected him in his early teens, he resolved on suicide, took three aspirin, and went to bed. Disaster struck again, some years later, when he fell under the spell of Titi Michelle, whose father had been physician to the exiled king of Serbia. She was pretty, elegant, and very coquettish, but she went home to Savoy in France, leaving Roberto pining behind. Determined to follow, he secured his doctor’s unwitting cooperation to contrive a need for mountain air to refresh his tubercular lungs. His goal was Bardonecchia, a ski resort in the Piedmontese Alps near the French border. Since he didn’t have a passport, he snuck past the border guards and walked through the train tunnel connecting Italy to France. Marcella, whom his parents had insisted he take along, was left back at the hotel, where Crown Prince Umberto was also staying. She was happy as always to oblige Roberto even though, lacking an escort, she could not leave her room the three days he was gone, even to dine. Valuing conspiracy in discretion above curiosity, she did she think to inquire how he had fared with Titi, when he returned or ever afterward. Others say he was rebuffed,but he was too proud of his border escapade to mourn.35

This was in 1927, when Roberto was 21. We know almost nothing about his adventures during his teens and twenties, nor did his family know much at the time. “I left home fifty times when I was seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty,” for weeks and months at a throw, he later recalled.36 He was “wild,” but elegant and full of practical jokes, hung out in cafes and socialized with playboys like himself. Whoring was popular, drugs were in, women were sport. For contrast he went often to Naples, where he found pleasure in wandering without money and sleeping on park benches. He would have agreed with Croce’s favorite aphorism, that Naples was not at all spiritually integrated with the rest of Italy, especially not with the restrained culture Roberto knew in Rome. Particularly in the Amalfi region he found a personal source of truth in its harmony of the spiritual and earthy. Later, he would make six movies there. One friend’s impoverished grandfather lived in slum housing near the Naples station. Although dressed in tatters, he was always impeccably groomed and spent his days on his balcony fishing for rats in the garbage-strewn courtyard below. They were as big as cats. He would strangle them, wait for a neighbor to open a window, then throw one in. How different Roberto’s experiences were from those of others his age! “When I was twenty,” said the novelist Vitaliano Brancati, “I was a Fascist down to my hair roots. Fascism for me was a wondrous credo. I experienced the joy of a herded animal: the joy of being in accord with millions of people—of feeling what they felt. An optimism of a third order invested me. I felt like a giant of the group even in my solitude.… I experienced deeply in 1927 what it is like for a twenty-year-old, inclined to meditation, fantasy and sloth, to admire a man of action and violence: to believe that a new delightful morality was about to be born.”37 For many who were young, Fascism was adventurous, idealistic, magical, full of imagination and energy. It hailed the brave new world that was worth a fight to create, a world of justice, of plenty, a world where capital and labor would cooperate harmoniously, where class strife, corruption, and debauched lifestyles like Roberto’s would be swept away along with the traditional Establishment. Fascism was also attractive to militarists, gangsters and Futurists who worshipped strength and violence. Often it had the effect of terrorizing opponents into silence. But until 1935 Fascism had a progressive side as well, a dynamic liberalism, and ought not to be confused with Nazism or the reactionary

regimes we call “fascist” today. Such regimes try to demobilize their masses, to reduce them to passive participation, and to return to traditional, prerevolutionary models. Fascism, in contrast, wanted to mobilize the masses, to transform society in new, untried directions, and to create a new type of man. It was authoritarian, but revolutionary. For the Nazis the man of the future already existed, but he was being suffocated by modernism (i.e., the last two centuries) and the great task was to restore the old, immutable, pre-Napoleonic values like race.38 Fascism wanted just the opposite—a new phase of civilization, engaged masses, not passive ones. It sponsored unions, after-work activities, sports, debates, and cultural activities to attach people to the revolutionizing process. Especially through education, it was believed (following the illuminists, Rousseau, and Jefferson), the new type of citizen could be created. Renzo De Felice writes: “Reading the books written by Fascists, looking at Fascist publicity, what’s striking is the vital optimism: the joy, the youthfulness, the life, the enthusiasm, the [concept of] struggle as a struggle for life. It’s a perspective which—even though in Fascist terms—is one of progress. In Nazism even the idea of progress did not exist.”39 The Fascist state, declared Gentile, is “a spiritual creation…an ethical state…an idealist state.”40 Unlike socialists, communists and positivists, Fascists denied that spirit was subservient to matter, that anything was historically inevitable or evolutionally predetermined. They vaunted the primacy of the will, the total freedom of the individual to carve out his own destiny. When the Marxist Turati told parliament that “Democracy [i.e., socialism] will win, because it must win, because it is history; yes, for this simple reason,” Mussolini replied, “History does not have fixed rails like a railway.” And Turati retorted, “I know…the will for you is everything, and ignores the causes which determine and moderate it. The trouble is that reality is not in agreement…with you, and economics is not literature or romance.”41 But Fascism was romance. When critics charged it lacked ideology and was merely a means to power, Mussolini agreed. Fascism regarded itself as the first realistic political movement free both from moral and intellectual preconceptions. Practice would precede and form values instead of the other way round. “I declare to you,” Mussolini told the nation, “that the twentieth century shall be the century of Italian power, it shall be the century during

which for the third time Italy shall be the guide of human civilization. Outside our principles there is salvation neither for individuals nor above all for peoples. Ten years from now Europe will be Fascist.”42 Mussolini shut down newspapers, abolished parties, jailed his critics (particularly on the extreme left), unleashed goon squads, repressed religious liberties, and ten thousand Italians emigrated to escape him. Repression harshened in 1927, 5046 were arrested, 904 convicted, by anonymous denunciations 80% of the time. But Mussolini also suppressed the mafia, demoted the Fascist party to an athletic and leisure-time organization, repressed class warfare by subjecting unions to state planning, reconciled the Vatican, and restored religion to the schools. The regime generally left people alone. There were no more broken windows, a shopkeeper knew his store would still be there next morning, the trams were running, women could walk the streets unmolested, and children were safe going to school. There was some price security for the farmer, the renter, the wage earner. The state’s finances were in order; inflation was checked; unemployment, the bureaucracy, and the deficit were all being reduced; and an impressive public works program was under way. Few countries could boast comparable achievements. Italy was a tyranny, but in the twenties and thirties few countries, no matter how democratic in name, permitted their citizens more actual freedom. People were arrested for thinking or speaking or singing the wrong song. Crime, corruption, unemployment and anything unflattering was censored out of the media. Privilege ruled. Yet the Germans were constantly agog at the amount of dissent Mussolini tolerated. In America at the time, by comparison, censorship of racist lynchings, war crimes, corruption, and exploitation of labor was routine; “free speech” often existed more in theory than practice. “I know no country in which, speaking generally, there is less independence of mind and true freedom of discussion than in America,” wrote de Tocqueville.43 Americans during the war had been sentenced to ten years in prison for writing letters to the newspaper saying the government favored profiteers, or for making a movie, The Spirit of ‘76, that cast British troops in an unfavorable light during the Revolution.44 In most of the world, free speech was synonymous with anarchy and disruption. In America, again by comparison, over a forty-year period thousands were jailed, deported or fired for thinking, speaking, listening to, or possessing dissident writing; socialist legislators were denied their elected seats; labor struggles were routinely blamed on foreign communist agitators; and goon

squads regularly suppressed peaceful demonstrations with violence and murder, even gassing babies. Mussolini’s prisons were relatively empty, violent crime was`rare, and city dwellers had no need to barricade themselves behind security guards. By 1932, 22,173 political prisoners had been released, and most of the remaining 373 were confined to islands or small towns rather than prisons. Long sentences were frequent but so were commutations within a year. Mussolini’s victims were chiefly militant Communists. Still today many Italians credit him for saving Italy from “going Communist.” During the Depression, Italy’s forwardlooking social legislation spared it the traumas of massive unemployment, homelessness, organized crime, class warfare, racism, lynchings and massacres that were encouraging not a few Americans to hope that Roosevelt would suspend the Constitution and assume near-dictatorial powers.45 Almost every book published since World War II condemns Fascism out of hand on the grounds that it was anti-democratic. But where was the “Democracy” to which Fascism is compared? Was it in the United States where two million wandered homeless, where other millions languished in jails, where non-whites had few freedoms and could even be lynched with impunity, where the press seldom printed the truth? World War I had turned European civilization upside down more thoroughly than any event in history. A generation of youth had been wiped out, everyday morality had been destroyed, class relations were in turmoil, and virtually every nation in Europe was experiencing problems similar to Italy’s. Fascism’s response, as De Felice points out, “was the attempt of the middle class, of the petite bourgeoisie…to impose itself as a class, as a new force. In this sense the Fascist movement was an attempt to propose new, ‘modern’ and ‘more adequate’ solutions, [such as] a modern sort of inter-class corporatism.”46 Thus, compared to Russia, Germany, France, Spain, and most of the non-European world, Italy under Mussolini was the envy of the world. Sovereigns and politicians and poets, too, from all over—George V, Churchill, Thomas Edison, Gandhi, J. P. Morgan , T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, George Bernard Shaw, W. B. Yeats—hastened to applaud Mussolini’s accomplishments. And so did the Italian people. In a freely-conducted plebiscite in 1929, in which ninety percent of the electorate participated, 8,519,559 voted approval, only 135,761 expressed dissent. “Despite the misgivings of certain intellectuals, students, and workers,” states Tannenbaum, “most of them, along with almost everyone else, viewed the Fascist regime as ‘normal’ and did what it required

more often out of conformity than fear.”47 But not Roberto. He was terribly out of step, a high-rolling flower child, addicted to liberty, to license even, as to a drug. Like his libertine family, he despised the lower-middle-class virtues that Fascism was institutionalizing. For him Fascism was the antithesis of Risorgimento liberalism masquerading as its fulfillment. In later years Roberto recalled the era in ho-hum tones. Fascism gained power dramatically, he contended, but soon afterward even the fanatics regarded it as bad joke. He contrasted public feeling after the Second World War—a sense of victory in defeat—with the sense of defeat in victory that followed the First World War, infecting Fascism as well. One Mussolini hymn was titled “Me ne frego” (“I don’t give a damn”). The Fascist creations were the militia, community organizations, corporate structures, and tens of thousands of little jobs—which weren’t to be discounted in a country full of unemployed and hungry citizens. The Fascists weren’t revolutionaries, they behaved like normal people living normal lives, nothing like the black masses of National Socialism. Often at the whorehouse, Roberto would be made to hide in his room so that Balbo or some other Fascist bigwig wouldn’t be seen. It was hard to be intimidated by people like that. Roberto lived within Fascism from age 16 to 38. During that period, when virtually no one travelled anywhere, Italian culture was all he knew. Yet, by dropping out of school, avoiding military service because of his bad lung, and being rich, he was largely unaffected by Fascism—aside from having to rush with his whore. “[I] lived the bohemian life, traveling about…and being in love all the time.”48 His companions were like himself: irresponsible, unemployed, and privileged, living in the gilded margins of the real world. They paid no attention to politics. Their youthful revolt was not against Fascism but conformity of any sort. Confronted by middle-class sobriety, they delighted in flaunting cynicism and insulting convention. One friend, who by birth belonged to the Pope’s Noble Guards, would take his post at the Vatican drugged out of his mind on cocaine, in

The full text is “traveling about Europe,” but I have not found any person or writing to confirm that Rossellini, aside from two brief excursions to Savoy and Nice, travelled outside of Italy before 1946. And there are far too many instances of inaccurate—or misquoted or mistranslated—statements from Rossellini to accept this single quotation as evidence to the contrary. The same interview, for example, quotes him as saying that his father was a “leading architect.” Rossellini would not have said this (in Italian interviews he always describes him as a costruttore—a contractor), but neither would he have bothered to correct it. Even to travel around Italy, however, was uncommon for Italians until after World War II; thus the sense of Rossellini’s statement is accurate.

full uniform, and perpetrate so many jokes that they had to dismiss him. Roberto, also on cocaine, got into an encounter with a militia captain in a Naples theater and slapped him—for reasons he could not remember later. They were both about 22. The insulted captain challenged him to a duel. Roberto and his friends could not keep from laughing. Early the next morning they went to the Solfatare of Pozzuoli, an area of tiny volcanic craters that give off sulphur fumes (where Roberto would later film a scene in Voyage to Italy). They tore off their right sleeves and faced off with swords. After simultaneously scratching each other, they stopped. For the rest of his life Roberto enjoyed displaying his scar. Slapping a uniformed officer in a public place was a scandalous—and jailable— offense, however, and the cocaine added to the mess. Giuseppe Rossellini had to defend his son from the police, which wasn’t easy. Roberto was impossible. When he was home, he was always late, always forgetting appointments, and his money lenders were always pacing to and fro outside on the sidewalk. Paternal fury had no effect. Roberto’s excuses were so extraordinary and detailed—on one occasion he claimed he had met the Queen of England and fixed her car— that even though no one believed him, his sins were forgotten. “My father was a man of exceptional dimension: courageous, intelligent, cultivated, of a liberalism and generosity of mind I’ve encountered in few others,” said Roberto. “This didn’t prevent me from revolting against him when the moment came. I couldn’t stand his telling me what to do. The moment he’d begin a reprimand, I’d leave the house slamming the door, going somewhere else to live, making debts my father paid.”49 Roberto’s brother Renzo, who sulked over Roberto’s conduct all his life, would go looking for him. His parents would box his ears. Roberto was following his forbears’ examples, in any case. None of them counted money, restrained a whimsy, or honored a marriage. His mother’s parents had separated, his aunt was separated, nonno Zeffiro had lived openly with his mistress Fortù. (Zeffiro had had a wife but none of the children saw her—ever.) Beppino’s philandering (“When my father died, three wives were crying under his bed,” Roberto would later say) reached such a point that in 1926 Elettra left him and, taking her youngest child, went north to Comerio, on Lake Varese, where her eventual second husband lived. Roberto spent money on cars, flowers, women, and clothes, frivolously. One friend, Eugenio Silenzi, recalls him buying a pair of sunglasses for a thousand lire—more than most white-collar workers could hope to earn in a month.50 He

took twenty or thirty people to supper every night. A lot of money he gave away casually. Rarely was he home before three in the morning. “I tended to prodigality, to excess,” he understated in 1973, although he had not changed a whit. “I’ve always been thoughtless. I can’t calculate the risks, I live on enthusiasm. I’m always making plans for the future. My policy is always to burn my bridges behind me. It’s a grave defect.”51

Even in debt he didn’t change;

he would borrow more money and give that away, too. This was the D’Annunzian side of Roberto, the one who lived in a fabulous dream world full of refined gentlemen and marvelous women spending their lives amid licentiousness, subtle conversations, and perilous love affairs. Liliana Castagnola, a third-rate vaudevillian from Naples, was one such woman. Eight years Roberto’s senior and with intense black eyes, hair short like a boy’s, and a sensual mouth, she was a femme fatale on whom many a fortune and, legend has it, even a life was squandered. Roberto, with faithful Renzo beside him, raced his car while Liliana watched from the stands and, each time he passed, threw her a kiss with one hand while steering with the other, then with two hands while steering with none—a ploy that moved Renzo to speak to him afterward. They spent all day in bed making love, said Roberto, until hunger forced them out to a restaurant, and then they had to rush back to bed before they had time to eat.52 The romance’s end is mysterious. Liliana was found dead on March 3, 1930. By some accounts, she killed herself for the actor Totò with an overdose of sleeping pills. By other accounts, harder drugs were involved. By Roberto’s account, she killed herself for him, by burning coal so that carbon gas asphyxiated her.53 He was boasting: it is likely she who jilted him. But around this time, due perhaps to the scandal around Castagnola, but more probably to cocaine and the slapping incident, Roberto’s father, as much to keep the police at bay as from bewilderment at his son’s behavior, consigned him to a mental sanitarium (a casa di cura per alienati ) near Naples. It was a harrowing experience that left terrible memories. Roberto emerged after a month or two and got into a taxi. Ît is not clear whether he escaped or was he free to leave. In any case, the friend he went to see was not at home and he had no money to pay the taxi. He had himself driven across town in search of another friend who wasn’t in either. A third and a fourth were also out. Roberto suggested they go to Rome. There was no gas, the cab driver was broke, and Rome was 140 miles away.

But credit was available: the driver’s little boy was deposited at the gas station as security, and on they went to Rome. Once home. Roberto told the butler to pay the cab. The butler went down, came back up, and told Beppino he didn’t have enough money. Beppino asked, “How much is it?” “Twelve hundred lire!” Enough to support a family for two months. Beppino paid, and nearly cracked his son’s skull. It was the only time in his life that he was violent with Roberto. “I still have the scar,” Roberto would brag to friends.54 “My father gave me the will to lead an adventurous life or, if you prefer, a courageous life. Despite this, I opposed my father. I felt that what he wanted for me wasn’t enough. And I think he was pleased that I rebelled, because for him that was a sign of courage. My stubbornness appeared as a sign of vitality to him.55 He used to tell me that you have to be daring, always. The important thing is always to be moving forward.”56 Giuseppe Rossellini, for his part, had assumed his duties in the family firm quite against his own bohemian inclinations. He was proud of the house with the tall, tall tower engineered by the Sleiters that he had built atop Monte Mario for the baritone Titta Ruffo (Via del Sassoferrato 11), and the one—the first on Via Po—that he had built for Pietro Mascagni. But he was far more Luigi’s son than Zeffiro’s nephew, and he was not good at business. He had wanted to be a singer and had sung the tenor roles in La Bohème at Rieti and L’Amico Fritz at Prato. The cult of Mascagni, the creator of Cavalleria rusticana, was a virtual religion in the household; its morning ritual featured Beppino singing “Tu ch’odi lo mio grido” while shaving. Entire nights were passed conversing with his idol. Once Mascagni phoned at 5:00 A.M. desperate for a nightingale. Beppino woke up a pet store owner and arrived breathless with a nightingale and a box of worms. But it wouldn’t even peep. They tried everything, they even brought over Marinetti, whom all Italy was whistling at in scorn, but to no avail. Art and ideas invigorated Beppino, business depressed him; he dreamed of vast projects, spent wildly, made bad deals, acquired a slightly shady reputation, and eventually ran his company into the ground. Yet, writes Renzo, “he was the sort of man to merit the esteem and friendship of many famous people.…My brother and I owe to our father the teaching that has gotten us through so many difficulties in life: that without iron faith and intangible ideals you are lost and will

end up with nothing.”57 Zeffiro had been self taught and was proud of it. But Beppino resolved late in life to remedy his lack of formal education. Rising before dawn, he would read the classics and write. By 6:30 he was at his workyard. At 1:00 he came home, exhausted, for dinner. In the afternoons he went to his office at 54 Via Margutta. After supper he went back to his studies. Fortunately he needed little sleep. He had a fine book collection, wrote poetry, occasional newspaper pieces, and, after ten years of constant refining, published a novel, Sic Vos Non Vobis (Rome: Edizioni Sapientia, 1928). “It was my father who gave me my zest to understand,” said Roberto.58 Every Sunday a band of friends would gather at Beppino’s house: musicians, painters, novelists, they were all crazy for knowledge and beauty. Among them was Odoardo Gori, a poet and philosopher whose refinement left a lasting impression on Roberto. And the famous writer Massimo Bontempelli who with Malaparte had founded a magazine, Novecento (“Twentieth Century”) which, in an age when Italians tended to feel culturally inferior to the French, gave evidence of Italian culture also in a French edition,Cahiers d’Italie et d’Europe. The cenacolo, or coterie, met for more than ten years. They’d come for dinner and stay into the evening, thirty of them, declaiming verses, playing scores on the piano, showing paintings and watercolors. Among them was Renzo’s impoverished music teacher, Giacinto Sallustio, who adored Croce and whose “concerts” at the Radium Cinema, where he played the great masters and totally ignored the silent films he was supposed to be accompanying, attracted a clientele all their own. They all argued madly about literature, politics, sports, women, life, death and anything. No subject was taboo, no opinion forbidden. Often fights would break out in thundering Roman voices. The neighbors across the street would run to their windows to discover what was going on when the shouting got wild. Then Sallustio would stomp out, announcing he was going off to read a few pages of Croce to restore his sanity. “But the arguments themselves were superb,” said Roberto. “And I, when I was thirteen or fourteen, was admitted into this circle where I had the right to say no matter what to try to rival intelligence with the old men. This type of duel gives you passion for intelligence your entire life, thirst for knowledge, a need to understand.”59 The group included Alfredo Panzini, a socialist; Mario Mont
