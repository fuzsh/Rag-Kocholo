        "text": "The loudness, the smash-and-grab editing, the relentless pacing drive every idea from your head; for young audiences “Star Wars” is like getting a box of Cracker Jack which is all prizes. This is the writer-director George Lucas’s own film, subject to no business interference, yet it’s a film that’s totally uninterested in anything that doesn’t connect with the mass audience. There’s no breather in the picture, no lyricism; the only attempt at beauty is in the double sunset. It’s enjoyable on its own terms, but it’s exhausting, too: like taking a pack of kids to the circus. An hour into it, children say that they’re ready to see it all over again; that’s because it’s an assemblage of spare parts—it has no emotional grip. “Star Wars” may be the only movie in which the first time around the surprises are reassuring. (Going a second time would be like trying to read “Catch-22” twice.) Even if you’ve been entertained, you may feel cheated of some dimension—a sense of wonder, perhaps. It’s an epic without a dream. But it’s probably the absence of wonder that accounts for the film’s special, huge success. The excitement of those who call it the film of the year goes way past nostalgia to the feeling that now is the time to return to childhood.\n\nMaybe the only real inspiration involved in “Star Wars” was to set its sci-fi galaxy in the pop-culture past, and to turn old-movie ineptness into conscious Pop Art. And maybe there’s a touch of genius in keeping it so consistently what it is, even if this is the genius of the plodding. Lucas has got the tone of bad movies down pat: you never catch the actors deliberately acting badly, they just seem to be bad actors, on contract to Monogram or Republic, their klunky enthusiasm polished at the Ricky Nelson school of acting. In a gesture toward equality of the sexes, the high-school-cheerleader princess-in-distress talks tomboy-tough—Terry Moore with spunk. Is it because the picture is synthesized from the mythology of serials and old comic books that it didn’t occur to anybody that she could get The Force?\n\nMost of the well-known writers who have tried to direct movies have gone at it briefly and given up in frustration. Cocteau was an exception; Marguerite Duras is another. She has been writing scripts since 1959 (“Hiroshima, Mon Amour”) and directing her own scripts since 1966, and the control in her new film, “Le Camion”—“The Truck”—suggests that she has become a master. But there’s a joker in her mastery: though her moods and cadences, her rhythmic phrasing, with its emotional undertow, might seem ideally suited to the medium, they don’t fulfill moviegoers’ expectations. Conditioned from childhood, people go to the movies wanting the basic gratification of a story acted out. Many directors have tried to alter this conditioning, breaking away from the simplest narrative traditions, and they’ve failed to take the largest audience with them. Duras doesn’t even get near the mass of moviegoers, though somehow—God knows how—she manages to make her own pictures, her own way. Hers is possibly the most sadomasochistic of all director relationships with the audience: she drives people out of the theatre, while, no doubt, scorning them for their childish obtuseness. At the same time, she must be suffering from her lack of popularity. Her battle with the audience reaches a new stage in “The Truck,” in which the split between her artistry and what the public wants is pointed up and turned against the audience. She brings it off, but she’s doing herself in, too. And so it isn’t a simple prank.\n\nThere are only two people in “The Truck”: Marguerite Duras and Gérard Depardieu. They sit at a round table in a room in her home, and never leave it. Small and bundled up, her throat covered, her unlined moon face serene, half-smiling, Duras reads aloud the script of a film in which Depardieu would act the role of a truck driver who picks up a woman hitchhiker. He would drive and ask a question or two; the woman would talk. Depardieu doesn’t actually play the truck driver: this actor, whose physical and emotional weight can fill up the screen, is used as a nonprofessional. He merely listens trustingly, a friend, a student, as Duras reads. Hers is the only performance, and there has never been anything like it: controlling the whole movie visibly, from her position on the screen as creator-star, she is so assured that there is no skittish need for makeup, no nerves, quick gestures, tics. The self-image she presents is that of a woman past deception; she has the grandly simple manner of a sage. Unhurriedly, with the trained patience of authority, she tells the story of her movie-to-be about the woman hitchhiker—a woman of shifting identities, who drops clues about her life which are fragments and echoes of Duras’s earlier works. This woman, a composite Duras heroine, strews a trail of opaque references to Duras’s youth in Indo-China (the daughter of two French teachers, Marguerite Duras spent her first seventeen years there), and when the hitchhiker talks to the truck driver about her disillusion with the politics of revolution, and says that she has lost faith in the proletariat, that she believes in nothing anymore—“Let the world go to rack and ruin”—she speaks, unmistakably, for Duras herself. “The Truck” is a spiritual autobiography, a life’s-journey, end-of-the-world road movie; it’s a summing up, an endgame. The hitchhiker travels in a winter desert; she’s from anywhere and going nowhere, in motion to stay alive. Reading the script, Duras speaks in the perfect conditional tense, beginning “It would have been a film—therefore, it is a film.” And this tense carries a note of regret: it suggests that the script is to be realized only by our listening and imagining.\n\nHer seductive voice prepares us for the unfolding of the action, and when there is a cut from the two figures at the table to a big blue truck moving silently through cold and drizzle in the working-class flatlands west of Paris, we’re eager to see the man and woman inside. But we don’t get close enough to see anyone. The truck crawls along in the exurbanite slum, where housing developments and supermarkets loom up in the void, Pop ruins. Its movement is noiseless, ominously so; the only sound is that of Beethoven’s “Diabelli” Variations, and the images and music never quite come together rhythmically. With nothing synchronized, the effect is of doomsday loneliness. Quiet is Duras’s weapon. The Beethoven is played softly, so that we reach toward it. The stillness provides resonance for her lingering words—those drifting thoughts that sound elegant, fated—and for the music, and for the cinematographer Bruno Nuytten’s love-hate vistas of bareness and waste, like the New Jersey Turnpike in pastels. The foreboding melancholy soaks so deep into our consciousness that when the director yanks us back to the room, you may hear yourself gasp at the effrontery of this stoic, contained little woman with her mild, Chairman Mao deadpan. When we were with the truck, even without seeing anyone in it we felt that “the movie”—our primitive sense of a movie—was about to begin. And it’s an emotional wrench, a classic rude awakening, to be sent back to Square One, the room. The film alternates between sequences in the room and sequences of the rolling truck, always at a distance. Each time she cuts to the outdoors, you’re drawn into the hypnotic flow of the road imagery, and though you know perfectly well there will be nothing but the truck in the landscape, you half dream your way into a “real” movie. And each time you find yourself back with Duras, you’re aware of being treated like a chump, your childishness exposed.\n\nBuñuel played a similar narrative game in parts of “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,” parodying the audience’s gullibility by involving us in scary ghost stories and then casually interrupting them. But that was only one of his games and he wasn’t onscreen himself pulling the rug out from under us, the way Duras is, returning to her narration, all dulcet modulations, as if she thought we’d be delighted to listen. The audience reacts at first with highly vocal disbelief and then with outbursts of anger, and walkouts. Even those of us who are charmed by her harmonious, lulling use of the film medium and in awe of her composure as a performer are conscious that we have, buried under a few layers, the rebellious instincts that others are giving loud voice to. They’re furious in a way they never are at a merely bad, boring movie, and this anger is perfectly understandable. But it’s high comedy, too: their feelings have been violated by purely aesthetic means—an affront to their conditioning.\n\nWhen “The Truck” opens at the New York Film Festival this week, there’s likely to be a repetition of the scene in May at Cannes. After the showing, Marguerite Duras stood at the head of the stairs in the Palais des Festivals facing the crowd in evening clothes, which was yelling insults up at her. People who had walked out were milling around; they’d waited to bait her. It might have been a horrifying exhibition, except that the jeering was an inverted tribute—conceivably, a fulfillment. She was shaken: one could see it in the muscles of her face. But Robespierre himself couldn’t have looked them straighter in the eye. There can’t be much doubt that she enjoys antagonizing the audience, and there is a chicness in earning the public’s hatred. “The Truck” is a class-act monkeyshine made with absolutely confident artistry. She knows how easy it would be to give people the simple pleasures that they want. Her pride in not making concessions is heroic; it shows in that gleam of placid perversity which makes her such a commanding camera presence.\n\nShe can take the insults without flinching because she’s completely serious in the story of the despairing hitchhiker. In her method in “The Truck,” she’s a minimalist, like Beckett, stripping her drama down to the bones of monodrama, and her subject is the same as his: going through the last meaningless rites. (“I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”) What “The Truck” doesn’t have is Beckett’s bleak, funny commonness. Beckett sticks to low-lifers, and his plays are the smelly vaudeville of the living dead, the grindingly familiar slow music of moronic humanity. Duras is bleakly fancy, with a glaze of culture. She’s all music, too, the music of diffuseness, absence, loss, but her spoken text is attitudinizing—desultory self-preoccupation, mystification. Not pinning anything down, she leaves everything floating allusively in midair. This is, God help us, a vice women artists have been particularly prone to. Who is this hitchhiker on the road of life? Ah, we are not to know. Indefiniteness is offered as superiority to the mundane, as a form of sensuousness. It’s a very old feminine lure—presenting oneself as many women, as a creature of mystery, and, of course, as passive and empty, disillusioned and weary. Dietrich used to do it in sequins, feathers, and chiffon. Duras clothes it in Marxist ideology, and puts forth her disaffection as a terminal, apocalyptic vision: Nothingness ahead. Some of her remarks (“Karl Marx is dead,” and so on) have a tinny, oracular ring. (You wouldn’t catch out Beckett making personal announcements.) The hitchhiker’s declaration that she no longer believes in the possibility of political salvation is meant to have shock value; the world—i.e., Paris—is being told what Marguerite Duras’s latest stand is.\n\nThere are some people who are too French for their own good. True film artist though she is, Marguerite Duras has a sensibility that’s infected with the literary culture of a précieuse, and partly because of the development of movies out of the common forms of entertainment, this sensibility exposes itself on the screen much more than it does on paper. Faced with the audience’s impatience, Duras fights back by going further, defiant, single-minded. There’s something of the punitive disciplinarian in her conception of film art; “The Truck” is a position paper made into a movie. It’s accessible, but it’s accessible to a piece of yourself that you never think to take to the movies. Let’s put it this way: if you were studying for a college exam and knocked off to go see “The Truck,” you wouldn’t feel you were playing hooky. Duras makes us aware of our own mechanisms of response, and it’s tonic and funny to feel the tensions she provokes. Her picture has been thought out with such supple discrimination between the values of sound and image that one could almost say it’s perfectly made: an ornery, glimmering achievement. At the opposite extreme from popcorn filmmaking, it’s a demonstration of creative force—which doesn’t always cut as clean as that laser sword in Alec Guinness’s hand.\n\nRight from the beginning of the film “Short Eyes,” directed by Robert M. Young from Miguel Piñero’s adaptation of his play about life in a men’s house of detention, you hear the play coming through the documentary surface. The film was shot entirely in the Tombs, and the details of cells and showers and of trays being emptied are completely convincing, yet the illusion that this is “life” never takes hold. Each time someone has a line, there’s a cut to him; it’s as if the director had pointed to the actor and said, “It’s your turn now, go.” Many of the actors (an overlapping group of ex-convicts, ex-addicts, and professionals) appeared in the stage versions, and you recognize the rhythm of well-practiced stage readings. And some of these actors love their lines too much; they’ve been revving up, stiffening their faces, holding their breath. Piñero dances through his own role—the hairy little hipster Go Go, a ratfink wearing a cross and a yarmulke. Piñero knows how to breathe as if he weren’t acting, and his lines have a pulse—watching him, we can tell how the script was meant to sound. But the scenes involving him are brief, and rushed; we barely grasp that he has planted a weapon in the bunk of another prisoner (played by Curtis Mayfield) before the men take their reprisals, and he’s gone from the movie. Still, “Short Eyes,” hung up somewhere between photographed play and prison documentary, has an obsessive interest, and when the child-molester, Clark Davis (Bruce Davison), one of the few men in the cellblock who aren’t Hispanic or black, delivers a confessional monologue about how he got started when he was fifteen with one of his little sister’s friends and how he has gone on, with acquiescent eight-year-olds who will do anything for a quarter, the film gets us by the throat, choking off petty reservations.\n\nBorn in Puerto Rico, Piñero was brought to New York at the age of four; within a few years his father deserted the family, and by the time Piñero was eight he was stealing milk and bread to help feed the younger children. The police started to pick him up when he was eleven; he had been a shoplifter, mugger, burglar, addict, and drug pusher and was serving a five-year sentence for armed robbery when he joined a theatre workshop in Sing Sing, where he began to work on this play. Paroled, he was twenty-seven when it was first performed publicly, by a group of former convicts and addicts, in 1974 at Riverside Church; it went on to win two Obies and a Drama Critics Circle award.\n\n“Short Eyes” is an insider’s view of prison life. Piñero doesn’t sentimentalize the men as victims. His is a reverse sentimentality, a cocky insistence that they got caught doing what they wanted to do. This insider’s “realism,” a neo-Cagney bravado, is much more entertaining than the usual liberal-humanitarian version of prison life; the prisoners flaunt their vices and never ask for sympathy. Their tough talk is the prison equivalent of locker-room boasting, and perfectly believable; what other form of cool could they have? Piñero, however, pushes bravado as truth: he has one of the men deliver an applause-jerking speech about being a dope fiend not because he’s black or suffering from a “personality disorder” but because he likes the stuff, and there are other speeches about how the men are “responsible” for themselves. This comes from a playwright who at the completion of shooting on the film was picked up, with another member of the cast, driving the wrong way on a lower-East Side street in a stolen taxi, and was indicted for grand and petit larceny, robbery, and possession of marijuana and a dangerous weapon. A more self-destructive hellion’s gesture would be hard to find; if he’s convicted, he could be sent up for twenty-five years. Of course, people are responsible for what they do, no matter what they’ve been through. But what does that actually mean in terms of those who have been damaged from childhood—in some cases, from infancy? What’s underneath Piñero’s defensive, macho oratory is what gives the film its strength: the pain that is the bedrock of the prisoners’ lives.\n\nThe plot centers on the revulsion that men in prison feel toward child-molesters—“short eyes.” (Child-molesting is said to be the one crime for which a man in prison is ostracized. It’s at the bottom of the scale; armed robbery is at the top.) Dostoevsky grappled with the horror of sexual passion for children; the Fritz Lang film “M” touched on it; “The Mark” flirted with it. The intensity of “Short Eyes” derives mainly from its getting close enough for us to feel some heat. But we’re not flung into the furnace. The men’s revulsion is taken for granted, without our seeing that they react to child-molesters with such profound, murderous hatred because of their fear that they’re capable of this sexual debasement. We need to see that Clark Davis, the child-molester, has given in to something the other prisoners haven’t sunk to and that this may be the last barrier for some of them—the only proof of their self-control. If he were rash or crazed, if he had dark, thick blood in him—if he were a man like the others—then maybe we’d see that their sexual conflicts and miseries belong to the same world as his. But Clark Davis is a miserable whiner. A cartoon of white-collar cowardice, he’s everything Piñero feels superior to; he’s no more than a trivial whitey to be squished.\n\nBruce Davison’s previous screen work (he was the student hero of “The Strawberry Statement,” had the title role in “Willard,” and was the nephew in “Mame”) doesn’t prepare one for his subtly objective performance as the molester; he’s playing a conventional weasel, but he gets inside that weasel. His facial movements are so small and tense that he suggests the tininess of Clark’s petty-clerk soul—so small that you even begin to think he couldn’t have done any physical damage to the little girls. Clark brings a pale chill into the prison. This is his first arrest, and his fear is like a shiver he can’t let out. His antennae give him all the wrong signals, and he doesn’t even know how to plead for his own life: he asks to be spared for the sake of his wife and child. Davison’s guardedness, his constricted voice, the suggestions of calculations that can’t help failing are all prissily exact. Even in his confessional speech—the only lines he’s got that haven’t been written from the outside, that have been felt, imagined—he doesn’t leap out of the character (though it must certainly have been a temptation)."
