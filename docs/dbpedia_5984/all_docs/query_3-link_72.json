        "text": "English commonly resorts to post-auxiliary ellipsis as in\n\n(1) They arrived late, as I thought they would.\n\nThis is already pretty rare among the world languages. But, as far as I know, English is unique in the variety of constructions where ellipsis is tolerated. For instance, it tolerates voice mismatch as in\n\n(2) This problem was to have been looked into, but obviously nobody did.\n\nor even non-verbal antecedent as in:\n\n(3) Mubarak’s survival is impossible to predict and, even if he does [survive], his plan to make his son his heir apparent is now in serious jeopardy.\n\nI have never heard of another language tolerating constructions like (2) and (3).\n\nWhile it is not clear to me what should be considered as \"unique\" to a language, since all the languages are different, so also unique in many ways, but they also share many basic features and principles. One can rather look for some typological rarities in English. A typological rarity is a feature that goes against some commonly recognised linguistic universal. The Universals Archive is a fascinating online database of such universals. It contains a special section with a small collection of rarities. If you search for results that are attested in English the databases finds 9 features (including one from \"Old English\", one from an \"English-based creole\", and one from \"Germanic languages other than English\"). These are exactly what you can consider true rarities specific of English (either mostly or exclusively).\n\nThe entries specific to modern English include the following. It is extremely rare for a language to have:\n\nverb inflection with non-zero exponent for 3rd person (subject or object agreement/cross-reference), but zero for all other persons\n\nindependent personal pronouns for 1st and 3rd (animate) person inflecting for both number and case, but that for 2nd person inflecting for neither category (defectiveness of 2nd person pronouns in number alone being more common)\n\nendoclitics occurring not only inside morphologically complex words, but even within monomorphemic words, with the positioning of the clitic (a) regulated by one general phonological rule, (b) not regulated by a general phonological rule, although when endoclitic to simple verbs, the clitic always comes before the last segment of the verb stem (subject person-number markers are cliticized to constituents in focus, being always enclitic with arguments in focus, but en- or endo-clitic with verbs in focus) (e.g., \"un-fucking-believable\")\n\n(finite) verb-second word order in main declarative clauses only if the first constituent is an adverbial with strong negative force (such as never before, hardly ever)\n\nrelative pronoun as the only target for agreement in animacy (human: who; non-human: which)\n\na definite article formally distinct from (one form or another of) any kind of pronoun – demonstrative, personal (free, clitic, or bound), possessive, relative, interrogative\n\nJohn McWhorter recently explained some. I'll add to that here. English has a number of features that, while not absolutely unique to English, just rare in the world, are unique to English as a collection:\n\nth- (interdental fricative) is rare among world languages. Icelandic, Arabic, and some Northwest Indian languages have it. Everybody has problems saying that when learning English.\n\nspelling/orthography - English is special in having a particularly idiosyncratic spelling to pronunciation map, primarily produced by major sound changes (the Great Vowel Shift) after some solidification of spelling norms had happened, but then fluid spelling norms throughout time, and lots of foreign word influences. This is of course not necessarily about English (spelling is not language), but is strongly associated with English speaking culture.\n\ndo-support - that's a fancy way of saying that 'do' gets spliced in for negatives and questions. \"I know who that is\" -> \"Do you know who that is?\", \"I do not know who that is.\". The only other languages in the world that does that is Welsh (and supposedly there was some influence one way or the other).\n\nprepositions isolated at the end (like in phrasal verbs \"Let's call the meeting off\" \"You should think it over\". These prepositions don't really introduce a prepositional phrase or indicate direction or anything we normally associate with prepositions except for some vague metaphorical direction (likely to be misdirected). They are 'idiomatic', they mean something much more with the verb than by themselves. Other Germanic languages have this but nowhere else.\n\ngenderlessness (in IE) - You know how French and Spanish have gender, a (grammatical) sex marker for each noun: 'la porte' (the door) but 'le mur' (the wall)? Most Indo-European languages have some sort of gender assignment. This is cheating a bit because in the whole world, having gender is only roughly half and half.\n\nmultiple layers of vocabulary - The British Isles are somewhat isolated, as islands tend to be, but somehow attracted multiple invasions over the centuries. Celts, Saxons, Norse, French, and scholars and engineers with a penchant for Latin and Greek. Most European languages share the latter (modern technical vocabulary) with English, but not all of the previous ones. Oh yeah, lots of words borrowed from indigenous colonialized people. English isn't special in having loan words: Swahili has lots of Arabic, and Mandarin lots of Manchu and Mongolian and so on. But English has multiple different sources.\n\nBut given all this, there is one thing that English is not particularly unique in, and that is in being unique. What I mean to say is that though English is certainly special in having all the above rare particular idiosyncrasies all in one place, most languages have a number of similarly idiosyncratic facts about them that distinguish them from all other languages, just not the same ones listed above that are special to English. French has the rare nasal vowels (like Polish) and some adjectives that go before nouns and some after (like Spanish). So English is not unique in being unique.\n\nEnglish is unique for its \"hieroglyphic reading\" feature. All other languages either use ideograms (hieroglyphs) for writing or use alphabetic/syllabary spelling that can be read following certain rules.\n\nEnglish is unique in that while it uses usual letters, it has no general reading rules that could lead a reader to unambiguous pronunciation. A reader of English reads not single letters or syllables, but the whole words at once: to learn reading in English one has to remember the reading and spelling of the whole words. In this quality English is close to hyerogliphic languages where the reader or writer has to remember pictures for the whole words. Although words in English are formally composed of letters, they do not play a similar role as in other languages, rather they are used as parts of a word's picture which should be remembered as a whole.\n\nI am not a linguist in any sense, but the answer appears to be that English has no unique traits (excluding trivial \"features\")*. From both a spoken and written perspective, English was formed as a mix of other languages. There is nothing that I'm aware of—grammatically, phonetically, or conceptually—that can be expressed solely in English.\n\nHere are some possibilities that stand out in English (from comments):\n\nEnglish stands out as one of about a dozen languages to use \"we\" as \"I\" (the Royal \"we\" / Majestic plural), though it's not unique. – Zairja\n\nNot unique as per comment: I remember that in one of his books (probably « la structure des langues »), Hagège mentioned that constructions à la “Do you know what I'm thinking about?“ with this separation between the preposition and the conjunction were very original. I will try to find what he says exactly and post it as an answer. – JPP\n\n\"Did\" at the beginning of this sentence has no meaning. That's a feature caused English being filtered through Celtic language speakers. Their feature came out as a \"do\" as in \"Do you have a car?\" which would be rendered as \"Vous avez une voiture?\" in French, literally \"You have a car?\" – Nick Anderegg, (Do-support - though there seems to be some controversy between grammarians and linguists)\n\nAdditional traits might be gleaned from these published works, but I could only preview some of them (no university access at the moment).\n\n*A trivial feature would be, for example, no language spells \"horse\" like English.\n\nFrom an English Syntax course I took several years ago, I understand that this feature is rare among languages, but not unique:\n\nPhrasal Verbs: \"I will pick him up at the airport.\" (in which 'pick up' makes this sentence have a fundamentally different meaning than \"I will pick him at the airport\" does) I have met some fluent ESL-speakers who simply can't use phrasal verbs correctly."
