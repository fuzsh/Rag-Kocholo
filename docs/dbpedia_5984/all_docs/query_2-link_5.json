While in a small town Hogan finds a simple man,Elmer Lamb(Stuart Erwin), who can add numbers in his head faster than an adding machine. Hogan hires him as an act for the carnival. Unfortunately Elmer’s act doesn’t draw much interest. All Elmer wants is to go home and buy a farm. Elmer is also sweet on Kitty. Elmer gets into a bridge game with the current world champ and wins. Now Hogan tries to exploit Elmer’s card prowess. Cute 30s comedy with Armstrong as the carny man trying to get some help for his carnival.…"
