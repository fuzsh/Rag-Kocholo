It is the 53rd short film released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 short films for the studio between 1934 and 1959.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe Stooges are inept but honest street cleaners. When they come across an envelope filled with oil bonds in the trash, they return them to their owner, B.O. Davis (John Tyrrell). The grateful Davis offers them a five thousand dollar reward if they can find an honest man with executive abilities. An honest dog ultimately leads them to a weeping girl (Dorothy Appleby), who explains that her sweetheart has been unfairly jailed. The best way to talk to him, the Stooges figure, is to get arrested themselves. They land in the clink and track down their man, Percy Pomeroy (Eddie Laughton). With some black paint, they make their prison outfits look like guard uniforms and make their escape. Just as they are leaving, Davis is coming in — handcuffed to a detective and revealed as \"Lone Wolf Louie, the biggest bond swindler in America.\" The Stooges wind up back in jail, breaking rocks over Curly's head.\n\nProduction notes[]\n\nSo Long Mr. Chumps was filmed on July 25–30, 1940.[1] The film title is a parody of the film Goodbye, Mr. Chips.[2] The jail sequences were reused in Beer Barrel Polecats.[2]\n\nWhen the Stooges drop their iron balls that are chained to their legs, the sounds that are heard are again the NBC Chimes, a gag recycled from the team's 1937 short Back to the Woods.[2]\n\nBud Jamison appeared in a deleted scene where he was a policeman noticing the Stooges and Pomeroy's girlfriend.[2]\n\nIn the final scene, where Moe and Larry were breaking rocks over Curly's head, Larry picks up what seems to be a rather heavy rock. Curly notices the rock and replies, \"Hey, wait a minute! That's a real one! I'm no fool.\" Curly then chuckles, while Larry and Moe smile. This represents the only time the Stooges broke character on film.[1][2]\n\nBruce Bennett (a.k.a. Herman Brix, a former Olympic athlete and Tarzan actor) appears as one of the guards giving orders to the stooges.[2]\n\nLaurel and Hardy had painted their prison uniforms white in 1927's The Second Hundred Years. They were also trash collectors in 1939's A Chump at Oxford.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
