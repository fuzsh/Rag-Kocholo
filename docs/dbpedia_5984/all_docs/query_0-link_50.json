        "text": "Volume 1 - A Chump At Oxford and Related Shorts\n\nThe first DVD, Volume One contains:\n\n1. A Chump At Oxford (Black & White)\n\n2. A Chump At Oxford (Colourised)\n\n3. From Soup to Nuts\n\n4. Another Fine Mess (Black & White)\n\n5. Another Fine Mess (Colourised)\n\nA Chump at Oxford (1940)\n\nA Chump at Oxford, directed by Alfred J. Goulding and released in 1940 by United Artists, was the penultimate Laurel and Hardy film made at the Hal Roach studios. Originally released as a streamliner featurette at forty minutes long, twenty minutes were later added for the British and European distribution.\n\nStan and Ollie are down to their last 6 bucks and call a lift to a job agency to find a work. A City Water Dept. truck driver offers them a lift and drenches them with water as a joke and leaves them behind. They finally arrive in a badly damaged car that has been towed away. At the job agency a call comes from Mrs. Vandeveer looking for a maid and butler to help at a dinner party she is holding that night. Ollie tells the receptionist they can fill the post and to leave it to them. They arrive and Stan is dressed in drag, pretending to be the maid 'Agnus'. Stan curtsies to Mrs. Vandeveer and his underwear rips loudly. As he walks off they are around his ankles.\n\nAt the dinner party Stan eats the nibbles he's supposed to be giving to the guests and tips the rest into Mrs. Vandeveer's lap. Ollie calls the guests to the meal with a hand held xylophone. He says \"there is everything From Soup To Nuts folks, come and get it\". Stan is told to take the cocktails and instead of clearing them away he drinks them and becomes drunk. Ollie gets the guests to sit down with the men on one side and the women on the other side of the table. Mr. Vandeveer tells Ollie to change the seating arrangement and Ollie begins to move the guests around for a while until Mr. Vandeveer gets impatient and tells them to sit anywhere they like at the table. Mr. Vandeveer then tells the drunken Stan to \"stir up the salad without dressing\" so Stan serves the salad in his underwear. Seeing this, Mr. Vandeveer angrily storms into another room to take a rifle. Mrs. Vandeveer arrives, having changed her dress, and faints at the sight of Stan. Mr Vandeveer returns, rifle in hand, and chases Stan and Ollie out of the house. A single gunshot is heard and Mr. Vandeveer returns, followed by a policeman, who tells him, \"why don't you be more careful, you almost blew my brains out\". When the cop turns to leave, the seat of his pants have a large jagged hole ripped in them, revealing smouldering undershorts.\n\nStan and Ollie then become road sweepers and wonder why they are always in the gutter. They decide to get an education because in Stan's words \"we're not illiterative enough\". They are sitting outside the Farmers & Merchants Bank of Commerce building eating a packed lunch, while a robbery was taking place inside. They inadvertently catch the robber when he slips on a banana peel tossed on the street by Stan. A grateful bank manager offers them a reward by suggesting that they could have a job in his bank. When Oliver mentions they wouldn't be much use since he and Stan don't have an education, the bank president expands on their goal to attend night school by saying, \"If it's an education you want, you shall have the finest education money can buy.\" He enrolls Stan and Ollie at Oxford University in England, and they depart the U.S. towards Oxford by steamship.\n\nWhen Stan and Ollie arrive at the University, the snobby undergraduate students, led by the mischievous Johnson (Peter Cushing) decide to give them the \"royal initiation,\" which involves a number of pranks. They are sent off into a maze in order to get a pass to see the dean and quickly became lost. One of the students (Henry Borden) dresses as a ghost in order to frighten Stan and Ollie, and while they sit on a bench to sleep, the ghost's hand comes through the hedge to help Stan smoke his pipe and cigar (substituting for Stan's actual hand).\n\nThey spend all night in the maze and exit the next morning. Johnson poses as the dean and gives Stan and Ollie the real dean's quarters to live in. They make themselves at home only to be confronted by the dean. The prank is uncovered and Johnson is due to expelled. Before this happens the students decide to run Stan and Ollie out so they can't give evidence against Johnson. The boys are taken to their real quarters where Meredith the valet recognises Stan as Lord Paddington, the \"greatest athlete and scholar the University ever had\". He says that Lord Paddington had lost his memory when the window fell on his head and wandered from campus. Stan and Ollie dismiss his story as a \"dizzy spell\".\n\nThe students arrive and decide to throw Stan and Ollie out of the window. Stan and Ollie decide to escape through the window and in doing so the window falls on Stan's head, which transforms him back into Lord Paddington. When the students accuse him of \"squealing\", he becomes angry and his ears wiggle - something that occurs whenever Lord Paddington becomes angry, according to Meredith's story - after which he throws all of the students out of the window. However, Stan doesn't remember Ollie any longer so he becomes furious when Ollie tells him of his former life and throws Ollie out the window as well.\n\nLord Paddington takes pity on Ollie and employs him to be his personal valet. He calls Ollie by the nickname \"fatty\" and criticises him which makes Ollie so angry he quits his job. Stan hears students come to cheer him outside and as he looks out of the window it falls on him once again of which he returns back to his usual self. Stan and Ollie make up. The film has a happy ending rather than the more usual unfortunate ending.\n\nFrom Soup To Nuts (1927)\n\nFrom Soup to Nuts is a 1928 short comedy film starring Laurel and Hardy as butlers hired for a high society dinner party. When Stan is asked to serve the salad undressed he serves it in his underwear.\n\nThe film was remade as the first part of A Chump At Oxford in 1940\n\nThe film center's around Stan and Ollie being hired as waiters at an upper class dinner party and subsequently not making a very good job of it. The film was remade as the 20 minute section of A Chump at Oxford that was added to the start of the film to extend its length for European audiences.\n\nThe film starts with Stan and Ollie arriving at the hosts house, with Ollie taking charge before even entering the property (he insists he is the one to ring the doorbell). The maid shows them inside where Stan puts their personal card on table with a collection of others. Visible on their card is the slogan, âAll we ask is a chanceâ. A small fight breaks out between Ollie and Stan as a result of Ollie trying to keep Stan from putting his hat on inside the house.\n\nAfter the wife of the household inspects them she gets shown a notice apologizing that the only available waiters were the duo, where it is revealed on the paper that their previous experience in waiting was at railroad eating houses. Ollie comments to the wife's husband that she is âsome wiggler!â (meaning the way she walks) and naturally, the husband isn't impressed.\n\nThe pair get ready to start work in the kitchen where Stan tells the chef (who is busy cooking) not to wear his hat. Stan takes it off him several times but the chef proceeds to keep putting it back on. Stan soon loses his cool and throws the chefs hat away. The chef retaliates by grabbing the nearest plate and smashing it over Stans head. Stan does the same back to the chef and they carry on using plates as weapons until Ollie calms things down by stopping Stan from destroying a large, expensive looking plate. However, as Ollie walks off, he trips on the kitchen floor and smashes the plate, causing him to be embarrassed by the onlooking maid.\n\nMeanwhile the party goes on, oblivious to the impending disaster awaiting them. The wife of the household isn't having an easy time either as she struggles to eat her fruit cocktail with the cutlery provided. Her predicament carries on throughout the film. Stan and Ollie come into the room as they are about to start serving food. Stan manages to pour, what looks like soup, onto Ollie's foot while he counts the guests. Ollie begins carrying a very large cake to the table but slips on a banana skin left by the family dog and lands head first into the cake. Ollie manages to do this more than once in the film, much to the bemusement of the guests, and of Stan, who accuses him of falling over on purpose at one point.\n\nThe pair spend most of the film falling down while trying to serve the food, much to the anger of the husband of the household. This is one of the first films to show Stan getting cross for once, as he loses his temper with Ollie's incompetence and with the guests.\n\nThe wife then asks Ollie to serve the salad âundressedâ. Ollie tells Stan to do this who, confused, heads to the kitchen to tell the maid what he has to do. The maid says, âI always serve it that way...â. Stan can't believe this but goes ahead and dresses down to his underwear to serve the salad. The film ends with the husband and wife discovering Stan undressed, and after a futile attempt by Ollie to put a jacket on Stan and ask, âHow's that?â, Ollie gets hit by the wife and falls into yet another cake.\n\nAnother Fine Mess (1930)\n\nAnother Fine Mess is a 1930 short comedy film starring Laurel and Hardy. It is based on a 1908 play by Arthur J. Jefferson, Stan Laurel's father, and is a remake of the 1927 film Duck Soup.\n\nThe title of the movie is Hardy's famous catchphrase 'Another fine mess'. However, in films Hardy always said 'Another nice mess'. The only known occasion 'Another fine mess' was apparently said by Ollie was in a radio programme the team made in the 1940s.\n\nThis is also the second film to feature the line \"Here's another nice mess you've gotten me into\", which was first used in The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case.\n\nOliver Hardy and Stan Laurel are vagabonds being chased by the police. They hide in the cellar of the mansion of a Quatermain-esque adventurer, Col. Buckshot (Jimmy Finlayson) recently departed for an safari in South Africa, and which is to be rented out until his return. The boys are surrounded by police, so to deceive the honeymooning couple renting the house, Oliver disguises himself as Buckshot and Stan disguises himself as both butler and chambermaid.\n\nDuring a girl-talk scene with Thelma Todd and Stan (disguised as the maid), Stan's comments get sillier and sillier, nearly causing Thelma to break character with the giggles.\n\nI think Mark answered better than I could. I posted a bunch of info in another thread.\n\nhttp://www.stevehoffman.tv/forums/showthread.php?t=172414&highlight=laurel\n\nHere's what it said:\n\nI did some searching on this set, and here are some interesting things I found. By the way, there is nothing but high praise for this UK 21 DVD set, except copies that are shipping now don't have the booklets included.\n\nAccording to an entry on the 'Official Website' site, there is a US L&H collectors box set, similar to the 2004 UK set, in the works for release 'Fall 2010' from the people who did The Little Rascals set from last year (Genius Products?)\n\nand....\n\nHello my fellow North American Laurel & Hardy fans! You will be pleased to know that a complete collection similar to the 21 disk collection in Europe will be released in the states. I've received an email response back from the public relations department over at Genius Products, currently holding the North American rights. A collection is on Genius's slate for next fall!! This is going to be a very long wait indeed. But for now I'm just ecstatic to know that it's in the works.\n\n...and...\n\n** The other box set was being remastered by a guy named Michael (sorry I've forgotten his last name) who was with Hal Roach Studios in the 1980s and was in charge of looking after original materials and managed to restore some prints before the whole Studio became a corporate asset of some company and eventually scattered to the winds.\n\nHe had this box set in the works but I read somewhere that he became unwell--I hope he's ok as he was quite an expert on studio history and the state of the prints and materials at the UCLA Archive (boy would I like to raid that place) and occasionally posted on a L&H message board on Google before it was overrun by spammers and trolls.\n\n...and...\n\nI believe you are speaking about Michael Agee. As I understand, he is credited for:\n\na) saving \"Bacon Grabbers\" (perhaps this would have otherwise become a lost film, if not for Agee).\n\nb) finding an alternate version of \"Pardon Us\" (the extended Englsish language version)?\n\nc) finding many of the main title cards for several silent L&H movies.\n\nd) restoring many of the silent L&H movies into the most pristine quality versions that I've ever seen.\n\ne) releasing the newly discovered 35 mm print of \"Why Girls Love Sailors\". (in English & original French language title cards)\n\nf) including the originally 'made exclusively for' \"Habeas Corpus\" soundtrack & sound effects.\n\nThis was a 9 volume dvd set of L&H silent films released in the U.S.A. & Canada, called 'The Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy. I highly recommend this set.\n\n...and...\n\nSpeaking of Genius Products, this just announced:\n\nVivendi Acquires Genius Titles, Select Staff\n\nBy : Erik Gruenwedel | Posted: 14 Sep 2009\n\n[email protected]\n\nVivendi Entertainment (VE), a unit of Universal Music Group, Sept. 14 said it acquired the home entertainment distribution rights to new releases and catalog fare from Genius Products, including brands such as... and RHI Entertainment. (note...And Laurel & Hardy, as RHI is the Hallmark company with the right to Hal Roach material, IIRC..Jerry)\n\nFinancial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Distribution rights are for North America, except RHI and WWE, which are for the United States only.\n\nThe deal would mushroom VEâs catalog offering to more than 3,000 titles, with annual new releases on DVD and Blu-ray projected to top about 250 titles, according to spokesperson Maria Ho-Burge.\n\nOther brands distributed by VE include, DIC, Palisades Tartan, Dimension Extreme, Codeblack, Palm Pictures, Razor & Tie, Shout Factory! and Salient Media.\n\nThe transfer of license agreements to VE, in addition to the hiring of select Genius executives, would appear to end another chapter in the once burgeoning storyline for Genius Products, which until earlier this year was majority owned by The Weinstein Co. (Inglourious Basterds) and distributed its packaged media new releases.\n\nGenius executive Mitch Budin was named EVP and GM of Vivendi Home Entertainment, reporting to OâMalley in Los Angeles.\n\nGenius said it would continue operations and has entered into a long-term distribution deal with VE...\n\n...and...\n\nI have to say Hats that the TCM L&H Collection is in my opinion, the BEST presentation of L&H on video, period, and we'll all be truly blessed if whoever has the rights these days takes the effort those on on the TCM set took.\n\nWhoever thought of compiling those guest appearances from those 4 movies was a genius -- and including that magnificent documentary on this set for the precise fans who would have greatly appreciated it was inspired thinking.\n\nThe Fox sets are great as well--nobody can say that Fox didn't give those sets the full treatment, with great audio commentaries, trailers and featurettes....\n\nI got Universal's sensational Abbott and Costello features collection (the A&C purists aren't wild about it, but I love it) and Universal UK's box set of W.C. Fields features (if they could bottle what is in that box set, it would cure everything, but probably not gout) -- I hope even this unit of Universal has the clout to give the best of L&H the best restoration and release possible, for the sake of future generations."
