        "text": "With a movie stacked with so many incredible characters, you really can’t go wrong in terms of quotes, as is the case with the ‘90s Disney classic, Aladdin. At times emotional, hilarious, heartwarming, and profound, this list of essential quotes from Aladdin is sure to make you feel both nostalgic and inspired.\n\nAladdin\n\n\"Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? I'll improvise.\"\n\n\"All this for a loaf of bread?\"\n\n\"Trouble? No way, you're only in trouble if you get caught.\"\n\n\"If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners!\"\n\n\"I'm not worthless ... And I don't have fleas!\"\n\n\"She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.\"\n\nAladdin: “So, uh, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?”\n\nJasmine: “Is it that obvious?”\n\nAladdin: “Well, you do kinda stand out.”\n\nWith Jasmine: \"They're after me! They're after you?\"\n\n\"Do you trust me?\"\n\n\"She deserves a prince.\"\n\n\"What would you wish for?\"\n\n\"Well, there's this girl ...\"\n\n\"I have servants who go to the marketplace for me. Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met.\"\n\n\"You aren't just some prize to be won. You should be free to make your own choice.\"\n\n\"You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world.\"\n\n\"For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right.\"\n\n\"Without you, I'm just Aladdin.\"\n\n\"Jasmine, I do love you, but I gotta stop pretending to be something I'm not.\"\n\n\"Genie, you're free!\"\n\nJasmine\n\n\"How dare you. All of you. Standing around deciding my future. I am not a prize to be won.\"\n\n\"Oh father, Rajah was just playing with him!\"\n\n\"The law is wrong.\"\n\n\"If I do marry, I want it to be for love.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Rajah, but I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.\"\n\n\"I'm a fast learner.\"\n\n\"Unhand him! By order of the princess.\"\n\nJasmine: “It's a shame Abu had to miss this.”\n\nAladdin: “Nah. He hates fireworks. He doesn't really like flying, either. Uh, that is, um ... Oh, no.”\n\nJasmine: “You are the boy from the market. I knew it! Why did you lie to me?”\n\n\"It's all so magical.\"\n\nJasmine: “Good night, my handsome prince.”\n\nAladdin: “Sleep well, princess.”\n\n\"Your beard is so ... twisted.\"\n\n\"Him! I choose ... I choose you, Aladdin.\"\n\nGenie\n\n“The ever impressive, the long contained, often imitated, but never duplicated … Genie of the lamp!\"\n\n\"Ten thousand years will give you such a crick in the neck!\"\n\n\"Yo, Rug man! Haven't seen you in a few millennia. Give me some tassel.\"\n\n\"Master, I don't think you quite realize what you got here. So, why don't you just ruminate while I illuminate the possibilities.\"\n\n\"Phenomenal cosmic powers ... Itty bitty living space.\"\n\n\"But oh, to be free. Not have to go poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? But to be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world.\"\n\n\"Let's make some magic!\"\n\n\"That fez and vest combo is much too third century.\"\n\n\"Tell her the TRUTH!\"\n\nAladdin: “Uh, Princess Jasmine, you’re very …”\n\nGenie: \"Wonderful, magnificent, glorious, punctual!\"\n\nAladdin: “Punctual!”\n\n\"But remember, bee yourself.\"\n\nGenie: \"Don't you scare me like that!\"\n\nAladdin: \"Genie, I, uh. I ... Thanks, Genie.\"\n\nGenie: \"Aw Al, I'm getting kinda fond of you, kid. Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything.\"\n\n\"Fine, I understand. After all, you've lied to everyone else, I was beginning to feel left out.\"\n\n\"Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.\"\n\n\"Jafar, Jafar, he's our man, if he can't do it then GREAT!\"\n\n\"Al, you're not going to find another girl like her in a million years. Believe me, I've looked.\"\n\n\"I'm free. I'm free! Quick, wish for something outrageous, say, 'I want the Nile.' Wish for the Nile, try that.\"\n\nGenie: \"I'm free! I’m free at last! I'm hitting the road, I'm off to see the world! I’m—\"\n\nAladdin: \"Genie, I'm gonna … I’m gonna to miss you.\"\n\nGenie: \"Me too, Al. No matter what anyone says, you'll always be a prince to me.\"\n\n\"Oh! All of ya! Come over here, big group hug! Group hug! Do you mind if I kiss the monkey? Ooh, hairball!\"\n\n\"I'm history, no, I'm mythology, no, I don't care what I am—I'm free!\"\n\n\"Made you look!\"\n\nJafar\n\n\"Trust me, my pungent friend, you'll get what's coming to you.\"\n\n\"My life is but to serve you, my lord.\"\n\n\"Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. That boy was a criminal.\"\n\nJafar in disguise: \"You're only a fool if you give up, boy.\"\n\nJafar in disguise: \"Things aren't always what they seem.\"\n\n\"The idea has merit.\"\n\n\"I love the way your foul little mind works!\"\n\n\"Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ecstatic.\"\n\n\"This is not done yet, boy!\"\n\n\"The power! The absolute power!\"\n\nIago\n\n\"Look at this! I'm so ticked off that I'm molting!\"\n\n“I can't take it anymore! If I gotta choke down one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers—BAM! WHACK!”\n\n\"Yes, oh mighty evil one!\"\n\n\"To think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter for the rest of our life!\"\n\n\"What if YOU were the chump husband?\"\n\n\"Jafar, JAFAR! Get a grip! Good grip.\"\n\n\"You got a problem, pinky?\"\n\nSultan\n\n\"There, there, my dear. We'll set it right.\"\n\n\"But, you're so old.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Absolutely marvelous!\"\n\n\"It's that law that's the problem.\"\n\n\"Well, am I sultan, or am I sultan? From this day forth, the princess shall marry whoever she deems worthy.\"\n\nAbu\n\n“Uh oh.”\n\nCave of Wonders\n\n\"Who disturbs my slumber?\"\n\n\"The diamond in the rough!\"\n\n\"Touch nothing but the lamp.\"\n\n\"YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE FORBIDDEN TREASURE! NOW YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY!”"
