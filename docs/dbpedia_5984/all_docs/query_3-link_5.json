        "text": "In this article, we are going to learn how to describe a movie in English, and how to learn English with movies.\n\nOver the years, I have worked with more than 10,000 students, and I noticed that those who learn English by doing what they like are always more successful at learning the English language. The key is to pursue your hobbies in English. For example, if you are a soccer fan, you can read news articles in English. If you like music, check the English lyrics of your favorite English songs. And if you like movies, then let me tell you what you need to do to learn English with movies!\n\nIn this article, first we are going to learn some adjectives to describe films and talk about them in English. Then, we will discuss the best way of watching English movies and TV series in order to improve your English. Let’s get started!\n\nWords and adjectives to describe a movie in English\n\nIf you want to talk about movies in English, you need to learn how to improve English vocabulary. So, let’s learn the most common adjectives and words to describe a movie.\n\n1. Genre (of words to describe a movie)\n\n“Genre” is the style of a movie. We have many different genres. For example:\n\nWestern movies\n\nWestern movies are about the American wild west. If you are a fan of this movie genre, you must have watched “The hateful eight” which is my favorite English movie of this genre! I also recommend “Django unchained“, a masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nSamuel L.Jackson in The Hateful Eight\n\nAction movies\n\nAction movies are movies with action scenes like gunshots or car chases. A very good movie in this genre is “Top Gun : Maverick” which can help improve your English. Later on in this article, I will explain the best way of watching movies to improve your English, so keep reading!\n\nTom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick\n\nAnimated movies\n\nAnother name for animated movies is “cartoons”. However, cartoons are mainly for children, while animated movies can be for adults. For example, an amazing animated series for advanced students of English is “Rick and Morty” which is by far my favorite series! (Careful: this animated series is for adults only!).\n\nRick and Morty by Adult Swim\n\nSci-Fi movies\n\nSci-Fi stands for Science-Fiction. This genre is about unrealistic or unreal things. An examples of this genre is the masterpiece “Interstellar” by Christopher Nolan. Sci-Fi movies are imaginary and they are mainly about the future of mankind.\n\nMatthew McConaughey in Interstellar\n\nLearn more: Reading newspapers requires some knowledge about its phrases and vocabs.

Romantic movies fall into this category. I am not a big fan of this genre. However, to be able to describe movies in English, you need to know about it! The best movie of all time “The Shawshank Redemption” is a drama movie.\n\nMorgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption\n\n2.Plot\n\nThe plot of the movie is the series of events that form the story of the movie. If you want to say “I really enjoyed the movie because the story was good”, instead of “story” you can say “plot”. Like this sentence:\n\nI really enjoyed it because it had a very good plot.\n\n3.Cast\n\n“Cast” is a collective noun meaning all the people (actors and actresses) who act and perform in a movie. The word “cast” is very useful in order to describe a movie and its actors and actresses. Take a look at this sentence:\n\nThe movie had a very good cast, but the plot wasn’t really interesting.\n\nIt means all the actors and actresses played very well.\n\n4. Cast list\n\nThe “cast list “is the list of all the actors and actresses who perform in a movie. The final “credit roll” shows the cast list of the movie. I never read it!\n\n5. Members of the cast\n\n“Members of the cast” are the individual actors and actresses who are performing in a movie. In other words, “cast” refers to all the people in the movie, and “cast list” is the list of names showing who acts in a particular movie. Members of the cast are actors and actresses. To understand the concept better, pay attention to the following example:\n\nOne movie that I watched about a year ago was “Once upon a time in Hollywood”. It has a very strong cast. However, in my opinion, the plot was weak and very boring. I didn’t like the story, no specific point was in the movie.\n\n6. Character\n\n“Character” is each individual in a movie. A movie has a main character which is the leading role of the movie (also called the protagonist of a movie). The main character, leading role, or the protagonist is the person who has the main role in a movie.\n\nWe also have supporting roles. Actors and actresses who are in the movie and in relation with the protagonist, but they are not the main character.\n\nLearn more: Learn about some boring words in English and their alternatives\n\n7. To nominate\n\nEvery year in Oscars, leading and supporting roles nominate for an award.\n\nWhat does “to nominate for an award” mean ?\n\n“To nominate” means to be selected or enter a competition to win a prize. If an actor like Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt nominates for Oscars, it means they enter the competition.\n\n8. Performance\n\n”Performance” means the act of presenting something. Every actor and actress in a movie is performing and showing his/her ability to act. Then, you can say that their performance was good or bad. Pay attention to the following example:\n\nI liked the movie. It had a very strong cast and an amazing plot, but the performance of the main actor/ the protagonist/ the leading role was poor.\n\nSo far, we have learned several words that you can use to describe movies in English.

If you watch it with subtitles in your mother tongue, you will read and understand the meanings as well.\n\nIf you are lower intermediate, then what you need to do is to watch movies instead of animated series. You can still watch animated series, animations, or cartoons but you can make a challenge for yourself by watching real movies. However, you can still use subtitles in your mother tongue.\n\nIf you are an upper intermediate student, then what you need to do is to challenge yourself even more by watching movies with subtitles, but the subtitles should be in the English. In this way, you will read, hear and see.\n\nIf your level is advanced, then, watch the movie with no subtitle to challenge yourself! A very important point here is that when you are watching the movie, don’t expect to understand 100% of every single word or line the cast are saying. Instead, try to understand the plot, the story of the movie, or the series of events. Understanding 20 or 30 percent of the movie would be perfect.\n\nYour level of English What movies are best suitable for you Beginner watch animated movies or cartoons Lower intermediate watch real movies with subtitles in your mother tongue Upper intermediate watch movies with English subtitles Advanced watch the movie with no subtitle\n\nIn general, try to make the learning process a hobby for yourself.
