        "text": "Andrew Cobby is the Grand Sheik of Billingham’s ‘You’re Darn Tootin’ tent, the chief scribe of the Beau Chumps tent and a regular and very accomplished contributor to our weekly email bulletins and website. In his latest item, Andrew takes his usual irreverent and humorous look at the 2018 movie Stan and Ollie\n\nThe film was generally very well received by both the Sons of the Desert and wider public alike, though as members of the former, we recognise that the producers played fast and loose at times with the script in respect of what really happened, when it happened, who was involved and what they actually said. We’ve even heard it said that Stan and Ollie is a ‘work of fiction’. Well, lets not go that far, but perhaps we can agree that this is a series of tales wrapped around some documented happenings?\n\nAs usual, click on the film title, actor/actress name etc to be taken to the respective page elsewhere on the website.\n\nPrompted by its recent screening on BBC2 in the UK, I thought I’d share some thoughts on Stan and Ollie. Released in the UK in January 2019, it tells the story of Laurel and Hardy treading the boards in the the British Isles in the early 1950s. It is directed by Jon S Baird and written by Jeff Pope. There’s also a credit for A J Marriot. I am not sure how much Mr Marriot contributed to the screenplay but if you haven’t read his wonderful and informative book ‘Laurel and Hardy – The British Tours’ you are missing a treat.\n\nThe boys are portrayed by two talented performers. Steve Coogan is a skilled mimic. Real or imaginary characters, he can do them all. He is good at blurring the line between fiction and reality and it appears to me that he takes a detailed approach to his work. Some of his characters like Paul and Pauline Calf, Tommy Saxondale and Alan Partridge seem so authentic that it is heard to think of them as fictional.\n\nHere we have him as Stan. He does a great job, accurately capturing the steely side to his nature as well as his gentleness and that strange, other-worldly side he had to him. He even manages Stan’s hard to replicate mid-Atlantic accent.\n\nSteve Coogan is good as Stan but that is to be expected. Equally impressive is John C Reilly as Ollie. The only other film I’ve seen Mr Reilly in is Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. This is a great parody and Mr Reilly is very funny as the eponymous rocker. After watching ‘Walk Hard’, you won’t be able to view another rock star biopic without smirking – and I can think of no finer compliment for a film skit than that.\n\nHe is more subtle here than he was as Dewey Cox. He conveys Ollie’s glee at Stan’s comic ideas but is also able to show frustration at his physical limitations brought on by illness and age. His scenes with his wife Lucille show a vulnerability that you sometimes see in his screen persona. Why do we always expect large men not to be vulnerable?\n\nStan’s wife Ida is well played by Nina Arianda. She is a scream as the Russian ex-dancer living off past glories and not so subtly undermining Ollie in front of his wife Lucille. She would be more than a match for Mae Busch. Ms Arianda even manages to out-shine the talented Shirley Henderson as Lucille. She saves her most withering contempt for Bernard Delfont, the man who has organised the theatrical tour.\n\nRufus Jones gives a funny and illuminating performance as Bernard Delfont. Full of himself and confident in his own abilities, you just know that his passport indicates his profession as ‘theatrical impresario extraordinaire’.\n\nMr Jones offers a knowing contrast to Hal Roach. Both men care greatly about money but Delfont is more English about it, and by that I mean that he is less open and honest about the filthy lucre than Mr Roach.\n\nThere’s a funny scene in which Stan is eating breakfast with Bernie (I’m sure he wouldn’t mind me calling him Bernie). He is trying to persuade Stan to continue the tour with Nobby Cook, that well-known English comedian, while Ollie is recuperating and, stressing the importance of the box office, reminds Stan that “these sausages don’t pay for themselves”. Rarely has the humble banger been filled with such fiscal significance. He knows that the cryptic comment won’t have been lost on Stan, a Lancashire lad after all.\n\nIncidentally, Nobby Cook is introduced as one half of leading British double act Cook and Baker. Nobby is completely fictional, but there was a British comedian, Joe Baker, who was teamed for a while in the 1950s with Jack Douglas (he of Alf Ippititimus and Carry On fame). I wonder if Cook and Baker may have been based on this. Then again, it might just be a figment of the the writer Jeff Pope’s imagination. I have vague memories of Joe Baker appearing in soap-powder adverts in the UK (my research tells me it was for Bold washing powder) before he emigrated to the US some time in the mid 1970s.\n\nThe point of this is that Mr Baker appeared as Lawrence Tibbett, the poor bloke who has his house taken from him in the gangster movie Bugsy. As we all know, in 1930 Mr Tibbett appeared with the boys in The Rogue Song. I have never seen The Rogue Song – not many have – so I have no idea if it’s any good. All I can say for certain is that Joe Baker was a strange choice to play Lawrence Tibbett because he looks nothing like him.\n\nDelfont is openly duplicitous in his dealings with the boys but he is hard to dislike. There is a nice scene in which he and the boys have a debrief on how the tour is going and the boys tell him that they thought they would be appearing in bigger theatres. Sly old Bernie tries to blame others for this but Ollie gently points that it was Delfont himself who booked the theatres.\n\nOllie is too polite to make his point with any great conviction or, perhaps conscious of the lack of other options, he just knows which side his bread is buttered. Post-war Britain would not have been the most inviting place to visit and I am sure the boys would much rather have been at home in sunny Hollywood. It would have been great if they had been given the chance to work in television.\n\nAfter being unsubtly cajoled by Bernie into making public appearances we see some splendid newsreel footage of the boys. Any publicity is good publicity as they are filmed doling out the fish and chips and appearing as hapless lollipop men. The newsreels have a lovely, authentic feel right down to the clipped English narration and Ollie would be willing to bet that they had a great time making them.\n\nThere is a good joke here about bigger theatres not being available because Delfont has booked them for Norman Wisdom. He sees the boys as yesterday’s men who are good for a few quid but, in Delfont’s eyes at least, Norman Wisdom is the future. I would like to have seen Mr Wisdom put in an appearance here – they did meet in real life – a role that that would have surely had Lee Evans written all over it.\n\nDelfont is shown in a bad light but you can’t help smiling at Mr Jones’s performance. From his flamboyant gestures and mannered speech you get the impression that he wishes it was him treading the boards.\n\n“I don’t miss England one little bit” says Stan in a throwaway line as he readies himself to shoot the dance scene in Way Out West and eyes up the pretty girls in the studio. Why should he? In those circumstances, I certainly wouldn’t.\n\nHis comment raises the question of what would have happened if Stan had decided to cut his losses and stay in England after his initial, unsuccessful visits to the US. Would he have ended up like his dad, working behind the scenes and moving from theatre to theatre to keep his head above water?\n\nI think one of the reasons Stan returned to the US was plain old ego. If Chaplin can do it, so can I. There is nothing wrong with that. It would have been an arrogant assumption on Stan’s part but also a very human reaction and, as it turned out, fully justified. He comes across in the film as one who knows his own worth.\n\nStan was a comedy genius with no off button. Mr Coogan sometimes gives Stan a fey, distracted delivery, as though he is elsewhere. Of course he is elsewhere, thinking up comedy routines and the bits of business that accompany them. Stan believed in hard work which no doubt made him hard work for others, particularly when all they wanted to do was switch off and relax.\n\nA genius, yes, but he was also an employee. He never had the total control over his films that Charlie Chaplin managed. A healthy bank balance can’t buy you class but it certainly helps to confer power. In Stan’s stand-off with his boss, it’s ‘Battling Laurel’ against ‘Moneybags Roach’ and there could only ever be one winner.\n\nThe scene at the start shows Stan as steely and eloquent in his wrangle with Hal Roach. He delivers a withering, and probably accurate, assessment of Mr Roach, even throwing in the word ‘parvenu’. It is certainly a memorable insult but his tirade is undermined a little by the fact that he has to explain what a parvenu is. No matter, the point has been made that Stan the man was a lot different from Stan the character.\n\nThe same scene also shows that creativity doesn’t always come out of a clear blue sky. Something frivolous and light-hearted can come from very dark places such as matrimonial problems, contractual wrangling and debt.\n\nThere’s a shot of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with the Tyne Bridge in the background, as the boys arrive at their hotel. The bridge was only completed in 1928 but it feels like it’s always been there, as if it just sprang from the banks of the Tyne organically when rivers were being created. Of course, it didn’t because it was the result of planning, blueprints and perilous construction. Think Busy Bodies but on a much larger scale.\n\nThat’s how I view Stan and Ollie’s films. Nothing comes of nothing. In the movie, Stan is undecided about a boat trip with Ollie and friends as he needs to work out the saloon gags. Scenes that seem organic have their origins in the 95% perspiration and nights hunched over a typewriter while drinking a few too many glasses of whisky. I suppose it’s part of the smoke and mirrors of the movies. He (they?) created scenes that are so beautiful and original that it’s difficult to think of them as anything other than elemental.\n\nStan and Ollie made appearances in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland but I don’t know why they never took the stage on neighbouring Teesside. Middlesbrough has the Empire Theatre and nearby Stockton-on-Tees has the Globe Theatre. It may be that, even in the early 1950s, the Middlesbrough Empire had been converted to other uses. As for the Globe, Buddy Holly and The Beatles appeared there so this would have been open for business at the time of the tours. If anyone could shed any light on this glaring omission, I would be grateful.\n\nYou could ask why anyone would bother watching Coogan and Reilly copying bits from Way Out West when you can watch the real thing. That is a fair point but what about those who have never seen Laurel and Hardy before? Despite the valiant recent efforts of Talking Pictures TV, they no longer form part of the regular schedules. Stan and Ollie is a good film and if it introduces viewers to the boys then so much the better.\n\nWatching the film reminded me of when I saw Laurel and Hardy for the first time. Except they weren’t Laurel and Hardy. They were Fatty and Skinny, peering out from one of those Robert Youngson compilations. That’s what certain films and TV programmes do, at least for me. I get a similar feeling watching The Damned United, the film of Brian Clough’s short tenure as the manager of Leeds United (A team on the English Premier League). It reminds me of the first great football team I can remember, the local news programme Calendar and that weird Rediffusion dial on the window sill that you had to turn to get Yorkshire TV. The Damned United is not a perfect film though – if you want drama, skip the movie altogether and get yourself on YouTube to watch the real Brian Clough and his predecessor Don Revie go head to head on Calendar. Now they were two men who genuinely disliked each other.\n\nI was watching the Tony Hancock film The Punch and Judy Man recently. With the use of his own name (although not in Punch and Judy), his distinctive garb and his regular supporting cast, he had a few things in common with the boys.\n\nThe Punch and Judy Man is a good film but there’s not much fun in it. You can see the direction Hancock was heading here, trying to obtain comedy from every day, often downright sad, situations. My view is that if you distil comedy too far the comedy disappears and you’re left with real life – and real life isn’t all that funny. So, although I’m a fan of Hancock, give me Laurel and Hardy with their little bits of fun.\n\nI used to work with a lady whose husband saw the boys when they appeared in his home town of Peterborough in 1952. She brought into work a postcard that Stan and Ollie had signed for her husband accompanied by the words ‘Hello Raymond!’. I am not usually one for memorabilia but I got a buzz from holding the photo and touching something that Stan and Ollie touched. So thank you Joan and Ray Butler for that.\n\nWhile I am thanking people, a big shout out goes to Stephanie Hyam as the monumentally unhelpful receptionist in the office of Mr Miffin. He is the film producer who ultimately decides not to produce the Robin Hood film. Ms Hyam is a hoot. She addresses Stan as Mr Lauren and makes no effort to apologise when he politely corrects her. It is another stand-off for Stan as he waits patiently to be seen by one of Mr Miffin’s minions. First Hal Roach and now the surly receptionist. Who knows? Perhaps Stan just liked antagonising people.\n\n‘Surly Receptionist’ views Stan as funny peculiar rather than funny ha ha. She looks in her early twenties so the point is being well made that she is too young to remember the boys in their prime. It is the receptionist’s deadpan reactions that makes the scene so funny. Her unimpressed demeanour seems typically 21st century and she reminds me of Catherine Tate’s equally hard to please schoolgirl character named, coincidentally or not, Lauren. I expected her to break into a riff on ‘Does this face look bovvered?’ as Stan runs through tried and tested routines in an effort to make it beyond the reception desk.\n\nStan is no more successful with ‘Surly Receptionist’ than he is with ‘Moneybags Roach’ and after his failed attempt to see Mr Miffin, he walks past a billboard advertising the comedy film Abbott and Costello Go To Mars. This is a real film, I looked it up. After Stan’s disappointment with Miffin, the boys’ glory days must have seemed a long time ago. Don’t worry about it Stan. Let other comedians have their time in the sun. You and Babe are for all time and there aren’t many people who can say that.\n\nIt’s years since I’ve seen Bud and Lou in action so it is probably unfair of me to comment on them. I will say, though, that one of the reasons I love Laurel and Hardy is that they don’t have to go to Mars in search of laughs. Yes, the boys exaggerate situations for comic effect but I think the situations and their reactions are still recognisably human or, if you like, down to earth.\n\nStan’s unsuccessful efforts with Miffin are intercut with Ollie attempting to buy a piece of jewellery for his wife Lucille before her arrival in the UK. The jewellery is priced at £350 which, using the UK inflation calculator, works out at a whopping £10,500 (give or take a few quid). Is it any wonder he has to make his excuses and rush off to bung £60 on a ho-hoper at Kempton Park. Betting is not a reliable way to manage your finances. They say that you should never bet more than you can afford to lose. I am not sure if Ollie could have afforded to lose £60 (about £2,000 today) but he certainly puts my dad’s weekly betting regime in perspective. He would have a 5p yankee. So that’s four horses, 11 bets at 5p each, plus 10% tax rounded up to the nearest whole penny and that will be 61 pence please. Thank you and see you next Saturday for more of the same. I have lost count of the number of Saturday afternoons I spent watching my dad watching ‘the ITV 7’.\n\nThese related scenes offer interesting portraits of the boys – Stan all work and Ollie all play. After Ollie looks at the racing paper and sees that his horse has lost, he angrily screws it up and throws it away. He then sees that he is being watched by some schoolgirls and, ever the gentleman, he hides his disappointment by offering them a wave as he lumbers on his way. It is a great gesture, both sweet and embarrassed at the same time.\n\nIt’s Ida Laurel who addresses the elephant in the room (or should that be the elephant in the film?).\n\nThis leads to a big fall-out between the boys as old grievances regarding their days with Hal Roach come to the surface. I may not have been watching closely enough but I got the impression from the film that the boys had not worked together during the period from Way Out West to the British tour. This is supported by the scene in the Fox Studios office in which Stan waits for Ollie to arrive to sign a joint contract. Ollie can’t attend because he’s busy filming Zenobia for Roach.\n\nI have no problem with the boys quarrelling in the film. I often mention my wife in what I write and this is necessarily so. Me and my wife don’t always see eye to eye but isn’t this to be expected in any long-term relationship? We love each other all the same and so it would have been with Laurel and Hardy. They may, or may not have, had a disagreement over Zenobia (aka Elephants Never Forget) but I am sure that during the course of their partnership they would have disagreements over some things. They never actively disliked each other.\n\nTheir tiff leads to the only uncomfortable scene in the film. “You loved Laurel and Hardy” says Ollie to Stan, “but you never loved me.” Ooh, that’s an awkward line so perhaps it’s best if we move on. Thankfully the film does. The very next scene is an amusing one that takes place in a holiday camp. The bright and breezy events organiser can’t help marvelling that the boys are still performing and using ‘the same old material’. Their ‘thank yous’ are so dry that they would have required a dust pan and brush to sweep them up.\n\nIn the sequence on Zenobia, Harry Langdon is played by Richard Cant. He is the son of Brian Cant who was always my favourite presenter on Playschool, with Toni Arthur running him a close second. For non-UK readers, Playschool was a revered children’s programme, comparable in its popularity to Sesame Street in the US or The Wiggles in Australia. I have always had square eyes and I got a kick out of that – almost as much as smirking my way through the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and seeing Charlie Nelson from Midsomer Murders deep under cover as Brian May.\n\nI remember as a kid watching the film The Great Houdini and crying at the end. Sorry Harry but I wasn’t crying because of you. I was crying because I’d just watched Tony Curtis expiring in the water tank and I was worried that there’d be no more episodes of The Persuaders. God, I loved The Persuaders. Tony Curtis was so cool. Thankfully my mam was on hand to calm me down and say ‘It’s only a film. It’s not real.’ And she was right. Sure enough, Tony Curtis was fit as a fiddle the next week as he beat up the bad guys with Roger Moore down Monte Carlo way.\n\nI thought about my mam’s wise words watching this film. There is a nice scene at the Glasgow Empire in which Navid from Still Game travels through time and space for a spot of moonlighting as the theatre manager.\n\n“Who’s playing Laurel and Hardy?” a puzzled theatregoer asks him, convinced that the boys have long since retired. It is a great accent that woman’s got. “They’re playing themselves”, he answers.\n\nWell, yes and no, Navid. In the film it’s the boys but, in reality, they’re being played by Steve Coogan and John C Reilly. I think it’s a nice joke from the writer Jeff Pope – a sort of wink to the audience that it’s only a movie and viewers should be prepared to suspend disbelief when they buy a ticket. Or perhaps that’s just me over-thinking things and needing to get out more.\n\nA note on Still Game: this is a comedy series about two men, accompanied by a cast of regular characters, navigating a sometimes unfriendly world. Anyone recognise that? Fellow Chump David Allen put me onto it and I am glad he did because it is a warm and funny comedy. It is available on Netflix and don’t let the Glasgow accents put you off. Just bung the subtitles on. You won’t regret it.\n\nIt is a well-made movie but there seems to have been a glitch in the editing process when Stan waves to the fans at the ticket office of the Glasgow Empire. There seems to be a quick jump just before he does his wave, as though another take had been inserted. It doesn’t detract from anything but is is noticeable.\n\nWhen the boys arrive in London we see, through the square window, the train passing Tower Bridge. I have made the journey from the north to London by train a few times and, if you discount Stevenage, the most exciting thing I’ve seen on the way to King’s Cross is the Arsenal stadium.\n\nOf course, the train to King’s Cross doesn’t go past Tower Bridge. It’s inaccurate but it gets the point across. It’s a shame that the producers couldn’t fully commit to the travelogue, though. They could have shown the locomotive wending its way past the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and, as a visual prop to Stan’s joke, even the Eiffel Tower. Isn’t this what back projection is for?\n\nAnd at the end we are back where we started. The boys’ jig to ‘At The Ball, That’s All’ seems to live long in the collective memory. It made the number one spot in Gary Winstanley’s excellent hot one hundred and is used to top and tail proceedings in the film.\n\nIt is a perfect duet for the fiddle and the biddly biddly biddly biddly bow. Stan and Ollie don’t say a word. They just dance for no reason other than the sheer joy of it. Isn’t that wonderful?\n\nI think it must be something to do with the spectacle of men dancing for no apparent reason. The Young Offenders TV series won me over with their unexpected reel at the end of the first episode. Further back, we have Eric Barker and Thorley Walters, among others, performing a delicate pastoral dance over the credits of Pure Hell of St Trinian’s. Monty Python also get in on the act with their memorable fish slapping dance.\n\nThese scenes have little in common with each other except that I hear Laurel and Hardy calling in all of them and they indicate a light heart that we should all aspire to. That was where Hancock went wrong – he should have put away the books and just danced more.\n\nIt is an affectionate film which gives it an extra bowler hat in my book. The makers know their stuff because they include nice, familiar touches in the narrative – the beret-wearing two peas in a pod, the case sliding back down the steps, the boys sharing a bed together and even the comic wives. The film gives an idea of what it must have been like to see the boys on stage. Steve Coogan’s bit of business peeling the egg is a really funny piece, his facial gestures and body movements are skilfully done.\n\nThere is a heart there too. It is a sweet idea to have Ida squeeze Lucille’s hand as they watch the boys perform their final dance (below). She is not such a tartar after all. It makes me happy that the movie includes the church bells pealing for the boys on their arrival in Ireland. Church bells sound beautiful anyway but even more so when they are ringing out ‘The Cuckoo Song’. It must have been a great moment and it is one of the few times when I can say that I wish I had been there.\n\nWell, that’s my view from the one and nines. I am not an impartial judge, I know. I saw it twice at the cinema, bought the DVD and watched the film a couple of time on BBC iPlayer so it’s fair to say that I’m a fan of Stan and Ollie as well as Laurel and Hardy. It takes liberties with time lines and events but, if you’re concerned about that have a read of A J Marriot’s excellent book on the British tours and this will put you right.\n\nAt times I have felt like that map of the tour itinerary, zig-zagging from one place to another but I make no apology for that. As far as I am concerned, all roads and rail links lead to Laurel and Hardy. I would like to end on a minor quibble, though. The script makes a couple of references to Norman Wisdom, which is fair enough, but where oh where oh where were Ray Alan and Lord Charles? I do like a good vent."
