        "text": "And from a Cannes protest for Brazilian Indigenous land rights by the actors in The Buriti Flower (Crowrã), to the recent Rio Film Festival, the largest film fest in South America, where 40 new Brazilian features had their world premieres, it has been a significant year for stories from and about the Indigenous communities in the world’s fifth-largest country. Most are still helmed by non-Indigenous storytellers, but outsider filmmakers are increasingly bringing local voices into the fold. The Leonardo DiCaprio executive-produced We Are Guardians, for example, saw its Arariboia translator and fixer Edivan Guajajara elevated to co-director status on the urgent story of the guardians of the Amazon rainforest. (That film is still on the festival circuit, having picked up multiple awards, and is screening at COP28 next week.)\n\nAs Native American Heritage Month wraps up, I have selected five more great Indigenous feature films—from America and beyond—to keep your watchlists rich with First Nations stories long past November. These films, having screened at both A-list and Native-list festivals, are new additions to the ever-growing global Native film canon, and their directors all joined me for conversations about their stories.\n\nBad Press\n\nSometimes a documentary comes along that sheds light on something going on in Native communities you had never been aware of before. Bad Press, which deservedly took a place in the DOC NYC winner’s circle lineup, is most definitely in this category. The film centers on Angel Ellis who, with her fellow free press Mvskoke Media reporters, fought for government transparency and access to information after the censorship of the free press in Muscogee Nation.\n\nLetterboxd reviewer Isabel Bishop summarizes the film’s uniqueness: “Bad Press brings to light one of the most important yet unrecognized issues in America: the fact that most reservations in America do not ensure a right to free press. Infuriating and at times, so ridiculous you have to laugh, Bad Press examines why free press is a necessary right for all people and the dangers that come with restricting it.”\n\nWaaPaKe\n\nThere are many documentaries about the effects of intergenerational trauma in Canadian Indigenous communities, but none have I found to be so deeply personal and poignant as Dr. Jules Arita Koostachin’s WaaPaKe. In this new film, which won best British Columbian documentary at VIFF Vancouver, Koostachin turns the lens on to her own family, talking with her mother and son (Asivak Koostachin, an acclaimed actor in The Montana Story and Run, Woman, Run, who also features in our Native recommendations video), and with others affected in her community. Most bravely, she turns her lens upon herself, as she looks at intergenerational trauma in the most literal sense.\n\n“In terms of it being super personal, this is something that I’ve been living with my whole entire life,” Koostachin tells Letterboxd. “I grew up hearing my mother’s stories, how she went to residential school, and I thought, now is the right time to talk about the next generation carrying the weight of that trauma. As I moved forward I realized that I might be the one that has to rip the bandage off and start the conversation. It was really challenging. It’s one of the hardest things I’ve had to do, is state my truth with my mother present in the audience.”\n\nMoving beyond burying intergenerational trauma, WaaPaKe is an invitation to unravel the tangled threads of silence and unite in collective freedom and power. On Letterboxd, Douglas Davidson shares his thoughts on how uplifting the film is, not ending on an angry and defiant note but instead “a sense of optimistic resistance that leaves one feeling empowered and connected, attached by a tether that connects spirit to spirit, soul to soul.”\n\nEarly on in her career, Koostachin was mentored by the grandmother of Indigenous cinema, Alanis Obomsawin. “When I was introduced to Alanis Obamsawin and her work, that was a very important moment in my life. I realized the importance of storytelling from an Indigenous lens,” says Koostachin. “It was her film, Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance, that changed everything for me. Her voice as an Indigenous woman replaced the didactic white male voice.”\n\nGiven Obomsawin’s importance in Koostachin’s development as a filmmaker, I reached out to the Canadian elder for her thoughts on WaaPaKe. “It’s very intimate,” the Abenaki filmmaker shares. “It’s about her family, and when she’s walking with them at the end of the film, you realize that she is so relieved and satisfied, as if she was saying ‘I did my job,’ and that she’s thought about it all of her life.”\n\nWhilst many recent Indigenous films on the festival circuit have found it difficult to get international streamer distribution, others somehow end up freely available on ad-funded streaming sites like Tubi. Marked as a Tubi Original on the service, and now renamed as The Raid, Muru is a new classic of Indigenous cinema: an action flick that flips the script on Native thrillers featuring (in acting roles) some of the real-life activists who lived through real-life raids (most remarkably, Māori icon Tame Iti).\n\nInspired by a century of actual events, Muru (The Raid) is the story of local Police Sergeant ‘Taffy’ Tāwharau (Cliff Curtis), who must choose between duty to his badge or his people, when the government invokes antiterrorism powers to launch an armed raid on his remote Urewera community. The tribal Tūhoe community of Urewera, nestled deep in mountainous New Zealand forest, was in fact the scene of actual government antiterrorist raids in 2007, but the filmmakers make it clear that the action drama is not a re-creation, but a response to these raids. “Muru” is a Māori concept for forgiveness.\n\nMuru was made by a largely Māori crew, is primarily in the Māori language and followed ‘Fourth Cinema’ principles of camera in the community. Curtis describes the experience to Letterboxd as an honor: “It was beautiful to go over to Tūhoe [tribe] and to be there amongst them. To luxuriate in their Reo [language]. Beautiful, wow. Their awa [river], their maunga [mountain], their mist. It was beautiful. To depict such brutal events with such care and respect, which was led by producer Reikura Kahi and director Tearepa Kahi. I felt safe in their hands and the way that they approached the work and the way they laid it out. They worked hard to make sure over the years that those relations were set up in the right way. The tikanga [cultural protocol] around it was just so beautiful.”\n\nDirector Tearepa Kahi talks about how the film came to be a mix of drama and action, centered on a Māori police officer questioning what is going on around him. “The scariest thing I’ve ever seen in New Zealand cinema is Merata Mita’s Bastion Point: Day 507. When Aunty Pare’s beautiful garden is trampled by the ‘blue line’ and those ranks of police officers are filled with Māori and Pacific Islanders,” says Kahi. “That scared me the first time that I saw it and that was a long time ago. So the departure into action, to take drama into action, that wasn’t part of the planning. It was about this character getting to this challenging place. [Asking] who’s been informed, whose orders are you following? Whose loyalty will you ultimately choose? And that’s what led to what could be described as genre blending.”\n\nMuru has resonated with Letterboxd members. “For many, I’m sure it was ‘just’ a movie, but for me it was very much a representation of the institutional and structural racism that my people and all POC still face around the world,” writes Tarryn-tino. “It was a great decision to choose to tell a new and fictional story based on a series of events, rather than do a retelling of the raids. It makes you think and question and consider various people’s motivations.”\n\nViewers wanting to know more about the Tūhoe raids can also check out the non-fiction documentaries The Price of Peace and Tame Iti: The Man Behind the Moko, and I also highly recommend the other films made by the prolific Kahi.\n\nLakota Nation vs. United States\n\nHighly rated on Letterboxd, Lakota Nation vs. United States presents a lyrical portrait of the Land Back struggle. Constructed around the poetry of Layli Long Soldier, this feature documentary is a searing portrait of an Indigenous people’s connection to the Black Hills. Through first contact and broken treaties to the promise of the Land Back movement this film is a testament to the resilience of a nation.\n\nThe Black Hills are deeply symbolic of the American mythos, from the story of Custer’s Last Stand to the portraits of four Presidents etched into the sacred “Six Grandfathers” mountain (Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe as known to the Lakota, Mount Rushmore to many others). The documentary does not shy from exploring the distorted image of a people long shaped by Hollywood: tropes around stories like Custer’s that made invasion look like self-defense, the horrific and under-reported story of the Lakota 38, and a landmark court case that really only gave the Indigenous people chump-change compared to the scale of their land losses.\n\nCo-director Jesse Short Bull tells a deeply personal and connected story. His great-great grandfather, Tatanka Ptchela (Short Bull) was an active witness to the conflict and refused to sign the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. He shares the process of going to his community and working with them to tell this profound story. “It was nerve-wracking, because I think that Laura [Tomaselli] and I wanted to approach this story with as much respect and compassion as we could. Also, media in Indian Country, and in Pine Ridge specifically, are almost like an extractive resource: stories are taken and put out there but there isn’t much reciprocity. There’s distrust. Laura and I really had to be as transparent as possible. I think that, because I’m from here, people were willing to give me a chance.”\n\nThe documentary opens with a poem by Layli Long Soldier that staunchly states the film is not there to entertain or follow usual documentary storytelling tropes, something that I suggest to co-director Tomaselli is ‘anti-documentary’. “I love that you say it’s an anti-documentary, that’s like the highest compliment,” she replies. “Layli Long Soldier is the poet and narrator and the voice-over is fashioned out of two poems of hers, [which] served as inspiration for how to build the film itself. Jesse says something really wonderful, which is that Layli looks at language: between each word, in between each letter. When we’re talking about treaty violations, that examination of language becomes really, really important. So I think part of applying Layli’s approach to writing to this film was using that sort of deconstruction of English language and applying that to film language.”\n\nBad Press filmmaker Rebecca Landsberry-Baker says: “Lakota Nation vs. United States is absolutely beautiful and I think it so brilliantly shares the story of Land Back in a very concise way, where it could have had a lot of heady history, but also makes it modern and very, very beautiful. I’m excited for them that they’re out there to as many people as possible to share this important story in Indian Country.”\n\nWe’ll give the last word on this film to a Lakota reviewer, Marina: “Watching heavy things lately, but watched this one with my family! Can’t help but be tearful when watching anything about my Lakota people. Loved seeing familiar places and hearing familiar names. Such an important doc! Especially for those who aren’t familiar with the genocide of Indigenous people and the continued impact.”\n\nWaikiki\n\nNative Hawaiian filmmaker Christopher Kahunahana, who also features in our video, is one of only a handful of Kanaka Mao’li to have completed a dramatic feature film. Just wrapping up a recent in-cinema presentation, Waikiki is now making its way to streaming services, and worth seeking out for its upending of the tourist-forward, sanitized version of Hawaiian life we often see on screen.\n\nThe story revolves around the hardscrabble life of Kea (Danielle Zalopany), a woman who works three jobs yet has no place to call home. Though Waikiki does not shy from its story of abuse, the film is ultimately about healing the land and healing the people, and coming back to core beliefs through culture. For Kahunahana, it was an important connection to explore. “Unfortunately, in contemporary Hawaii, a lot of the women I know in my life have experienced abuse,” he tells me. “I think it’s a crazy ridiculous percentage, Kanaka [Natives] who have experienced abuse.”\n\n“How we treat our land is how we treat our women in society. It’s like the destruction or displacement of the land or the diversion of our stream systems,” says Kahunahana. “[In Waikiki] there’s a division right in the middle, which is the Ala Wai canal, and it’s always been polluted. It just seemed appropriate that that disconnection from nature is a disconnection from our culture, and a disconnection from our culture and dispossession from land led to a lot of the symptoms that we experience as colonized people.”"
