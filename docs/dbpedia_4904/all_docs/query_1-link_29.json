On the final lap of the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, Verstappen grabbed the points he needed to secure his first title. In doing so, the Flying Dutchman joined the ranks of some true F1 hall-of-famers. But who are the most successful Formula 1 drivers of all time?\n\nThe most successful Formula 1 drivers of all time\n\nIt is difficult to compare the best drivers in F1’s history with current drivers. Therefore, the top 10 is based on the percentage of races won compared to race starts. The results might surprise you…\n\nMore about Formula 1\n\n01\n\nAyrton Senna – 25.47 Percent\n\nAyrton Senna is one of the greatest names Formula 1 has ever produced. The three-time World Champion (1988, 1990 and 1991) competed 161 times and claimed 41 victories before his career ended prematurely in 1994 after his tragic death at Imola.\n\n02\n\nAlain Prost – 25.63 Percent\n\nFrenchman Alain Prost – known as ‘The Professor’ was one of F1’s greatest drivers during the 1980s and 1990s, especially during his memorable battle against Ayrton Senna. Active in F1 between 1980 and 1991 then again in 1993, Prost took over the traditional French racing team Ligier in 1997.

Schumacher entered 308 races and had 306 starts; he won 91 races in his time.\n\n05\n\nSir Lewis Hamilton – 32.29 Percent\n\nSir Lewis Hamilton is the most successful driver in Formula 1’s recent history. He has competed in 319 races and has won 103 races, and has finished on the podium 194 times.\n\nHe first raced in the 2007 F1 season with McLaren and moved to Mercedes in 2013, where he won seven World Championship titles and equalled Michael Schumacher’s record in the 2020 season. podium 182 times.\n\nIn 2021, Hamilton was close to securing a record-breaking eighth title before Max Verstappen snatched victory on the last lap of the final race of the season.\n\n06\n\nJim Clark – 34.72 Percent\n\nThe great Scot Jim Clark was active in F1 between 1960 and 1968.

Fangio became World Champion five times (1951, 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957) for four different teams and never finished a Grand Prix in lower than second place.\n\nFangio entered 52 races and in 51 starts, he took 24 race wins and finished on the podium 35 times.\n\n10\n\nLee Wallard – 50 Percent\n\nTechnically, the American Lee Wallard has the most successful Formula One race-starts to race-wins ratio of all time.

Wallard started the race twice in this period; in 1950 (finishing 6th) and 1951 (winning the race). He entered again in 1953, but did not qualify.\n\nRelated"
