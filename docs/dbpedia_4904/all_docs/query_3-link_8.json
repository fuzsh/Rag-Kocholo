        "text": "One of the most popular motor racing events is the Grand Prix. The thrill and adrenaline are unmatched as you’re watching world-class drivers manoeuvre their way around hairpin turns during the Formula 1.\n\nPair this experience with a cruise and you can enjoy some of these world-famous events alongside a luxury cruise for the perfect mix of action, adventure and relaxation. You can either find a cruise and book your tickets separately or tailor-make a package with our Finest Collection to include tickets, hotels and exclusive experiences all in your cruise fare.\n\nDates for the 2019 F1 calendar are listed below, with dates for the 2020 F1 calender yet to be confirmed. We will update this page with current dates as soon as they become available!\n\nAustralian Grand Prix\n\n14-17 March 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nThe Australian GP is in Melbourne, with the racing at Albert Park over the course of three days. This is typically the first event in the Grand Prix circuit and is the second-oldest surviving motor racing competition in Australia, having commenced over 80 times since the first event in 1928. The Australian driver, Lex Davison, is one of the most successful drivers in the history of the event, winning four times in 1954, 1957, 1958 and 1961.\n\nThere are many cruises which visit Melbourne during a sailing, including cruise lines such as Viking Ocean, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea. These range from world cruises to short-stays of four-nights or more.\n\nAs your chance to catch the Australia 2019 Grand Prix has passed, why not take a look at our March 2020 sailings to Melbourne for a chance to catch this event first-hand?\n\nBahrain Grand Prix\n\n29-31 March 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nEnjoy the Bahrain Grand Prix at the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain. This is quite a new addition to the Formula 1 championship, having only joined in April 2004, when it made history as the first Formula 1 Grand Prix in the Middle East.\n\nThe course has giant run-off areas, which prevent sand from getting on to the track and makes Bahrain one of the safest tracks in the world. The event has also been given the award for the Best Organised Grand Prix for the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile).\n\nCruises tend not to sail to Bahrain so the closest port is Doha, Qatar, which is included on most sailings along the Arabian Gulf. The 2019 Bahrain GP is at the end of March, so why not take a look at March 2020 sailings to the Arabian Gulf for a chance to watch this sporting event up-close?\n\nChinese Grand Prix\n\n12-14 April 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nVisit the Shanghai International Circuit in Jiading, Shanghai for a chance to enjoy adrenalin-fuelled sport first-hand. The venue for the championship was the most expensive Formula 1 circuit facility, costing $240m when it was built in 2004.\n\nIt also features one of the trickiest corner combinations in the Formula 1 events, featuring a demanding 270° right-hand corner which requires high speed and tightens up at the end. The Grand Prix first took place in China in 2004, and the 2019 Shanghai Grand Prix hosted the 1,000th round of the Formula 1 championship!\n\nBrowse our March 2020 sailings for cruises to Shanghai to see this exciting race in person!\n\nSpanish Grand Prix\n\n10-12 May 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nEnjoy the Spanish Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, based in the beautiful city of Barcelona. This race is one of the oldest in the world still contested, celebrating its centenary in 2013.\n\nCruises often visit or even embark from the port of Barcelona, making it an ideal event to pair with a cruise. Enjoy sailing with cruise lines such as Crystal Cruises, Azamara or Seabourn, plus many others, as you visit this cultural city of Spain.\n\nIf you’re keen to watch the Spanish Grand Prix, the dates has not been confirmed for yet, so it’s worth holding back until further details are revealed. We will update here with confirmed dates as soon as they are available.\n\nMonaco Grand Prix\n\n23-26 May 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nProbably the most iconic Grand Prix circuit and having been held each year since 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix is one of the most prestigious and important automobile races in the world.\n\nIt occurs in a street circuit, with tight corners and many elevation changes, making it one of the most demanding in Formula 1. The track flows through the cities of Monte Carlo and La Condamine, including the iconic harbour. Alongside the Italian Grand Prix, Monaco’s Grand Prix has is unique in having been held at the same circuit every time over such a long period.\n\nAs the race takes place in such a built-up area, Monaco has many temporary grandstands erected around the harbour and circuit area. Along the harbour, yachts gather to spectate from the water and hotel and resident balconies also get a fantastic birds-eye-view of the event.\n\nCruises here are popular, with the Grand Prix taking place in the early summer for warm Mediterranean breezes making this an experience to enjoy all year-round.\n\nCanadian Grand Prix\n\n7-9 June 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nThe Canadian Grand Prix occurs each year in Montreal at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Notre Dame Island. May cruises visit here, as well as embarking from here, making it a great opportunity to watch the race then enjoy a luxury sailing.\n\nIn 2005, the Canadian Grand Prix was the most-watched Formula 1 Grand Prix in the world, coming third behind the Super Bowl XXXIX and the UEFA Champions League Final. In 2014, the organisers revealed there is a ten-year extension to keep the Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve until 2024.\n\nThe event takes place in June 2019, with many sailings here on cruise lines such as Seabourn, Regent Seven Seas and Viking Ocean.\n\nFrench Grand Prix\n\n21-23 June 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nVisit the south of France and watch the French Grand Prix in June 2019. It was formerly known as the Grand Prix de l’ACF as one of the oldest motor races in the world. However, it ceased in 2008 after 85 races due to circumstances involving finances and venues. The race returned in 2018 at the historic Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet.\n\nThe background of motor racing in France was influential in the early years of Grand Prix racing, and lead the establishment of rules and regulations as well as trends for the evolution of racing. It’s certainly a bucket-list Grand Prix if you only have to pick one!\n\nMany cruises visit here as it’s in a popular location. Cruise ports nearby include Toulon and Sanary-Sur-Mer, with both within enough reach of the Grand Prix circuit. Most cruises which visit one of these ports will most likely visit the other, with Toulon being slightly more popular than Sanary-Sur-Mer.\n\nBelgian Grand Prix\n\n30 August – 1 September 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nThe Belgian Grand Prix is held at the Circuit de Spa-Franchorchamps, in the Spa region.

There are many cruise lines which visit Antwerp, including Azamara, Seabourn and Regent.\n\nSingapore Grand Prix\n\n20-22 September 2019 / Dates TBC for 2020\n\nTaking place at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, the Singapore Grand Prix is close to where cruise ships port in the city, at the Marina South Pier. This Grand Prix was the inaugural night race and the first street circuit in Asia which was designed for Formula 1 races.\n\nIn 2018, it was ten years since the race was held at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, prior to which it was known as the Malaysian Grand Prix before Singapore gained independence in 1965 and it was renamed the Singapore Grand Prix.\n\nThere are plenty of cruises which sail to Singapore, offering many opportunities to set sail to this diverse city and watch this adrenalin-rushing event unfold. The 2019 Singapore Grand Prix is in September this year, so if you fancy a last-minute cruise, there may still be time to visit! However, the Singapore Grand Prix has not been confirmed for 2020 yet, so it’s worth holding back until further details are revealed. We will update here with confirmed dates as soon as they are available.\n\nJapanese Grand Prix\n\n11-13 October 2019 / Dates for 2020 TBC\n\nTaking place at a track built by Soichiro Honda – Japanese engineer and founder of Honda – the Suzuka track was initially built to test cars for the business, before making its first appearance on the Formula 1 calendar in 1987. It’s known for its iconic crossover feature and is the only figure-eight track to appear in Formula 1 – original drawings show that the track was potentially going to have three crossovers, not just the one!\n\nHistorically, the Japanese Grand Prix was the last race on the F1 calendar, meaning that it was the venue for many title-deciding races. 13 World Championships have been crowned out of 30 at the Japan Grand Prix.\n\nThe Japanese Grand Prix takes place in early October, during the milder months and late summer of the country. You can cruise to nearby ports such as Nagoya, Kobe and Osaka – each of which is within a few hours drive. We can arrange travel for you with one of our Finest Collection packages, ensuring a relaxing sailing and exciting experience at the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nMexican Grand Prix\n\n25-27 October 2019 / Dates for 2020 TBC\n\nDespite being sat right in the centre of Mexico, the Mexico Grand Prix conveniently takes place right beside an airport, where you can fly right to the Grand Prix either before or after your cruise. If your cruise ends in Mexico, there is a selection of ports which you can fly from including Acapulco, Cabo San Lucas, Cozumel, Ensenada, Progreso and Puerto Chiapas – each of which only takes a couple of hours.\n\nThe circuit itself is 2km above sea level, making the 4.3km lap a breathless experience. The surrounding area is a vibrant metropolis and offers plenty for you to explore during your stay. One of the unique features of the track is that it also winds through the old Foro Sol baseball stadium, where you can get great views down into the cockpits and enjoy the atmosphere of the crowds.\n\nThe 2019 Mexican Grand Prix is in October, with plenty of time to arrange travel here. Dates are yet to be released to 2020, but we will update as soon as they are available.\n\nUnited States Grand Prix\n\n1-3 November 2019 / Dates for 2020 TBC\n\nThe United States Grand Prix has been held in the U.S. on and off since 1908, where it was often referred to as the American Grand Prize. As of 2018, the race has been held 48 times and taken place at ten different locations.\n\nSince 2012, however, the race has been held every year at the Circuit of Americas in Elroy, Texas – just 12 miles south of Austin. If you’re keen to visit Texas and watch the Grand Prix, one of the best ways to travel would be to fly in and out of Austin either from or on to your cruise departure port. We can arrange any of these options for you and tailor-make a package perfect for you!\n\nAs one of the most modern race tracks on the Formula 1 calendar, a visit to this sporting event is a must for those considering where to go. Austin is also full of great food and nightlife, making it ideal to bookend either side of your cruise!\n\nBrazil Grand Prix\n\n15-17 November 2019 / Dates for 2020 TBC\n\nTaking inspiration from the three main circuits – Brooklands in the UK, Roosevelt Raceway in the USA and Montlhery in France – the Brazilian Grand Prix has a track that is built on the foundations of racing history. The Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace, more commonly known as Interlagos, was built in 1938 and first took part in the Formula 1 from 1973.\n\nThe first three Brazilian Grand Prix races saw home wins with Fittipaldi in 1973 and 1974, then Carlos Pace in 1975. There is a real carnival atmosphere at this Grand Prix in the true Brazilian style, which is something every Formula 1 fan should experience!\n\n2019’s Brazilian Grand Prix is held in November, meaning there is some time to arrange a last-minute trip here. There are some cruises to Sao Paulo, but not many, so it might be better sailing to or from Rio de Janeiro and flying to the Grand Prix from here. We can happily arrange all of your travel requirements, no matter which way you decide to get there.\n\nAbu Dhabi Grand Prix\n\n29 November – 1 December 2019 / Dates for 2020 TBC\n\nThe Yas Marina Circuit was completed in 2009 when it first appeared on the Formula 1 calendar and debuted at that year’s finale. The backdrop for Yas Island was very much a blank canvas eleven years ago, now you can take your pick of seven hotels, Ferrari’s indoor theme park, a shopping mall, waterpark, a golf course, beach, concert arena, nightclub and stunning weather – the perfect place to watch the Grand Prix!\n\nOne of the hotels, Yas Hotel, even has trackside hotel rooms where you can watch the races from your window. Or, why not take a seat aboard a boat in the marina for a whole other experience?\n\nThe race is a day-night race and was Formula 1’s first ever race of this kind starting at 5pm local time. Floodlights are switched on part-way through the race to provide a seamless transition from day to night for the drivers.\n\nThe circuit is very close to the Abu Dhabi cruise port, so you could choose to cruise before or after the Grand Prix with ease – just tell us which you prefer and we can arrange it for you!\n\nIf you would like to build your own Grand Prix cruise and stay package, call our Cruise Concierge team on 0808 202 6105 for expert advice and award-winning customer service with your enquiry and booking.\n\nHave you visited any of the above Grand Prix events?
