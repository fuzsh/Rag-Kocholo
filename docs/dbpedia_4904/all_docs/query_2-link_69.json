        "text": "The 2019 Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix will be one of the sporting events of the year in Australia.\n\nThere's so much riding on the 2019 season, and Albert Park will be the place to be if you want to see inevitable drama unfurl.\n\nJust 10 drivers remained in their 2018 seat, and Mercedes and Haas were the only two teams not to alter their line-up.\n\nAll eyes will be on Aussie hero Daniel Ricciardo, who will lead Renault's charge in 2019 after ending a five-year relationship with Red Bull.\n\nRicciardo has been there and abouts in Melbourne, but has never walked away with a trophy. He initially did in his first year with Red Bull, but was disqualified post-race.\n\nWill we finally see an Australian winner in Melbourne, or will Mercedes and Ferrari translate pre-season testing pace into Grand Prix pace?\n\nMORE: Everything you need to know about the 2019 Formula One World Championship\n\nSporting News has all you need to know about the 2019 Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nAUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX: HISTORY\n\nThe 2019 race will be the 83rd in the combined history of the Australian Grand Prix, with the race dating back to the 100 Miles Road Race of 1928, which was held at Phillip Island. It will also be the 24th time the event will be held at the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit at Albert Park.\n\nThe event only became part of the Formula 1 World Championship in 1985, and was held in Adelaide until 1995. From 1996, the event has been held in Melbourne.\n\nExcluding 2006 and 2010, Melbourne has hosted the season-opening event since Albert Park took over the race in 1996 - a contrast to the Adelaide days, with the Australian Grand Prix formerly the final event of the season.\n\nAustralian driver Lex Davison won the race four times across the 1950s and 1960s before it became part of the world championship. Seven-time world champ Michael Schumacher is the most successful Formula 1-era driver with four wins. Four-time world champion Alain Prost is the only driver to win the Australian Grand Prix in both Australian domestic and world championship formats.\n\nFerrari ace Sebastian Vettel is gunning for his third victory on the bounce at Albert Park, and his fourth overall. The German is one of three active drivers - Kimi Räikkönen and Lewis Hamilton - to have won the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nThe last Australian driver to win the Australian Grand Prix was 1980 world champion Alan Jones, who took victory in the non-championship race in 1980. The last Aussie to officially finish on the podium was John Smith in 1983 - however, Daniel Ricciardo did finish second in 2014, but was disqualified post-race due to illegal fuel flow.\n\nThe Australian Grand Prix, being the first of a new season is usually one heavy on attrition. Famously, eight cars were wiped out in a multi-car pile-up at the first corner in 2002 after Ralf Schumacher rammed polesitter Rubens Barrichello.\n\nAUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX: TRACK SCHEDULE\n\nSESSION DATE TIME Practice 1 Friday 15 March 12:00 - 13:30 Practice 2 Friday 15 March 16:00 - 17:30 Practice 3 Saturday 16 March 14:00 - 15:00 Qualifying Saturday 16 March 17:00 - 18:00 Race Sunday 17 March 16:10 - 18:10\n\nLocal time (AEST).
