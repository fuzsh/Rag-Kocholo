        "text": "There was another thrill when\n\na car driven by G. W. Patterson,\n\nof Victoria, which was leading the\n\nfield at terrific speed in a lap o£\n\nthe Group Handicap (Group 1),\n\nfailed to enter the western S bend\n\nand shot down an escape road.\n\nThere were seven races for\n\ncars, ranging from 13. to 26 miles,\n\nand seven for motor' cycles from\n\n11 to 21 miles. Hie programme\n\nopened at 11 a.m. and was not\n\nconcluded until 5.30 p.m.—about\n\nan hour behind schedule. Laps\n\nwere over 1.3 miles, with an S\n\nbend at the eastern end and a\n\nliairpen bend at the western end.\n\nCars were in lines of three fill\n\ning two roads leading to the\n\ncourse. Shortly before the opening\n\ncars were stretched out for about\n\na mile. A big squad of police on\n\nduty was praised by speedway of\n\nficials for the manner in which\n\nthe traffic was handled. There\n\nwere only brief pauses as the\n\nlines were merged into one at\n\n'each entrance track. A ' breeze\n\nfrom the sea made for pleasant\n\nconditions and reduced dust, an\n\nnoyance when racing, curs left the\n\nbitumen track. !\n\nIn declaring the speedway open !\n\nMr. C. S. Hincks (Minister of\n\nLands\" congratulated the promo\n\nters on their enterprise. He said\n\nthat Mr. T. C. Burford. a one\n\ntime racing motor cyclist, had\n\ntaken a prominent part in pre\n\nliminary arrangements for. forma\n\ntion of the track following (he\n\nParliamentary ban on road rac\n\ning.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Mi'.\n\nHincks was driven round the\n\ncourse in the official car.\n\nFAVORABLE COMMENT\n\nDrivers spoke favorably of the\n\nnew track; but some suggested\n\nthat attention - should be given to\n\nmore extensive grading at the\n\nsides for the benefit of vehicles\n\nwhich left the bitumen.\n\nLes March, a prominent driver\n\nin hill climbs, and Bill Craig,\n\nanother promising driver, were in\n\njured in separate crashes while\n\nengaged in practise runs on Wed\n\nnesday. Both received treatment\n\nat Balaklava Hospital, being al\n\nlowed to leave afterward.\n\nDriving a Morgan Plus 4, P.\n\nMcK.' Hay had a meritorious win\n\nin the Class C Gi'oup Scratch race\n\nfor cars over 13 miles (10 laps).\n\nOne of the State's up and coming\n\ndrivers, he took the lead early,\n\nwithstanding a strong challenge\n\nby R. S. Brown (MGTC).\n\nThe crowd was on its toes when\n\nHay roared into the northern\n\nstraight in the third lap where a\n\ncar which had been lapped had\n\nbroken down. Frantic efforts of\n\nofficials just managed to get the\n\ndisabled vehicle clear before Hay\n\nbore down.\n\nSoon after the start of the\n\nclass B Group Scratch race a\n\nJowett Javelin Special, driven by\n\nA. J. Wylie (Victoria), left the\n\nbitumen in a cloud of dust, but\n\nwas driven back skilfully into the\n\nrace. P. Harrison -{Victoria'),\n\ndriving a Dodge Special, had an\n\nall the way win. .\n\nSix drivers entered for the\n\nClass A Group Scratch Race over\n\n13 miles (10 laps). A. N. (\"Lex\")\n\nDavison, at the wheel of his Alfa\n\nRomeo, took the lead, followed\n\nclosely by S. J. Jones, another\n\nVictorian, driving a Maybach, re\n\nputed to he the fastest car in\n\nAustralia.\n\nDASHING DUEL\n\nThe crowd was thrilled at a\n\nclashing dueMjetween the two ace\n\n-drivers, and when Jones went to\n\nthe front in the eighth lap ex\n\ncitement was intense. Zooming\n\nalong the northern straight in the\n\nnext, lap Davison was in hot pur- ;\n\nsuit- when his rear tyre blew out i\n\nwhen he was entering the S bend.\n\nThe Alfa Romeo careered off\n\nthe bitumen toward the inside of\n\nthe track, overturning several\n\ntimes and coming to rest upside\n\ndown, Davison being thrown clear j\n\nseveral yards away.\n\nThe race went to Jones, with E.\n\nDeB. Norman (Maserati 6C) the\n\nonly other driver to be placed.\n\nAn average lap speed of 68 miles\n\nan hour (fastest of the day) was\n\nnoted in this event.\n\nLater in the day it was reported\n\nthai. Davison's injuries were not\n\nof a serious nature. He and Jones\n\nhad been booked to leave shortly\n\nfor the famous Monte Carlo\n\nRally.\n\nFeature of the 26-mile Group\n\nHandicap (Group 1) event was\n\nthe magnificent driving of Jones,\n\nwho came from the scratch mark\n\nto overtake the field, giving him\n\nhis second success.\n\nHeavy entries were noted in the i\n\nmotor cycle events, the Port\n\nWakefield Senior T.T. going to\n\nM. Quincey (Victoria). The side-!\n\ncar T.T. was won by L. W. Fox.\n\nRESULTS\n\nResults of the various events\n\nwere as follows:—\n\nCARS\n\nGroup Scratch Race—Class C\n\n10 laps—13 miles"
