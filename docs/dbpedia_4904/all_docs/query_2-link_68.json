        "text": "Did you know that when Formula One came to Australia in 1985, it set up home in Adelaide? Ex-racer-turned-entrepreneur Bob Jane, however, wanted a race in Melbourne so he built a huge thunderdome and created the AUSCAR (an auto racing sanctioning body) series. In 1992, when Jeff Kennett was elected the new premier of the State of Victoria, he shortly set about developing Melbourne's profile, and on top of his list was the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nOne year after, an agreement was made with Formula One. However, the contract with Adelaide did not expire until 1995, so Kennett had enough time to construct a track, which later on was developed in uniquely beautiful Albert Park. In 1996,Melbourne held the first round of the world championship, which becomes the biggest motorsport event on Australia's calendar today. The Grand Prix is contracted to continue in Melbourne until 2023.\n\nFormula 1 World Drivers' Champions"
