        "text": "The winter of 1957-58 must have been an interesting time for John Wyer and David Brown, the men charged with determining the future direction of Aston Martin’s racing endeavours. Some might even say that, for the first time in its competition history, Aston Martin actually had a nice problem with which to grapple.\n\nTradition said it should devote all its efforts to sports car racing. The DB3S had been one of those agonising nearly-but-not-quite cars, but the still-fresh DBR1 was at last showing signs of realising the promise it had contained from the start. The opportunity of at last claiming the world sports car championship from arch-rivals Ferrari was real and evident.\n\nThen again, the forthcoming season also offered the chance for Aston Martin at last to reach the top rung of the racing ladder. It had just built its first proper grand prix car, the DBR4/250, and early testing suggested it to be at least a match for the two class acts of the era, the Maserati 250F which had just won Fangio his fifth world title, and Vanwall which had won three times in 1957 and would in ’58 become Britain’s first Formula 1 constructors champion."
