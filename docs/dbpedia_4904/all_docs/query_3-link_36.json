        "text": "After 3 long years of waiting the Australian Grand Prix is back with a bang. Formula 1 cars return to the Albert Park street circuit under new regulations. Albert Park has been resurfaced and the layout has changed, with that the lap times are expected to tumble and it’s an exciting time to see how the new regulation Formula 1 cars will perform. Can the revitalised Ferrari team take a famous victory over Red Bull or will the ‘Flying Dutchman’ Max Verstappen win it for Red Bull? Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc is in top form and already has a win this season. It is going to be a massive event with Saturday and Sunday sold out as far as ticket sales are concerned. Auto Action also has a 12 page preview and TV guide to the fantastic Hi-Tech Oils Bathurst 6 Hour production car race that’s held over Easter. Plus, as always there’s heaps of news and features, as well as race coverage from locally and around the world."
