        "text": "Diana (Crick) Gaze is Notable.\n\nDiana Margery Crick was born about 1925. She was the daughter of Albert Crick and Margery Deakin. Although her record of birth is yet to be located, Diana's parents heralded from England and two older siblings were born at King's Norton, England.\n\nDiana became a dental nurse.\n\nDiana married Lex Davison, a Melbourne businessman and budding racing driver, on 2nd October 1946 in St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Toorak, Victoria. [1]\n\nLex and Diana Davison\n\nDiana soon became one of Australia's pioneer female racing car drivers, regularly competing in hillclimb events; one of the oldest forms of motorsport. Indeed, theirs became a multi-generational racing family, with sons Jon Davison, Richard Davison and Chris, and grandsons James Davison, Alex Davison and Will Davison following in their footsteps. The couple had seven children:\n\nAnthony Alexander Davison (22 Jun 1947-15 Jul 1999), a shoe manufacturer, like his late paternal grandfather; married Karen Folletta about 1970 in Melbourne and have a daughter Philippa Kate.\n\nJonathan 'Jon' Deakin Davison (1 Dec 1948-), not only raced cars, but took over as Sandown track promotor in 1990; married Julie Gillam before 1984, children include Charles and James Davison, who is also now a racing driver.\n\nPeter Warne Davison (1949-)\n\nChristopher Robert Owen 'Chris' Davison (2 Mar 1951-), had a brief racing career; married Janet Boyd about 1974 in Melbourne, children include Claire and Nicholas.\n\n(Diana) Elizabeth 'Lillibet' Davison (30 Aug 1952-), married John Bynon about 1970 in Melbourne.\n\nRichard Gilbert Davison (21 Feb 1954-), racing driver won Australian F2 Championship 1980; married Penelope 'Penny' Winch about 1975 in Melbourne, their children include Alex Davison and Will Davison, who are both respected and successful racing drivers.\n\nKatherine Felicity 'Cathy' Davison (17 Jan 1958-), was reportedly born at Sandown Park Racing Circuit; married Glenn Coad, owner of Glenn Coad Racing, after 1975 in Melbourne and has a daughter, Alberta. [2]\n\nLex took up motor racing, his first race just three days after their wedding. It was not long before Diana, feeling left out of the excitement, wanted in and Lex bought her an MG TC; her first ever car. Sadly he, not she, crashed the car later. Both Diana and Lex had raced it at Rob Roy Hillclimb, Victoria, where Lex had coached Diana from the passenger’s seat. Diana also raced the MG at the final Killara Park Sprints – 'dashing back to the house between runs to check on baby Anthony, who usually travelled in the car in a wooden cradle fitted behind the seats'. With Diana beside him in his 'pit team', Lex went on to win the Australian Grand Prix on four occasions: 1954, 1957, 1958 and 1961; results only ever equalled by Michael Schumacher.\n\nDiana Davison in Austin 7 Special\n\nFollowing Lex's death at Sandown Park Racing Circuit in 1965, and a twelve year period of mourning, Diana married another Aussie motor racing pioneer and decorated RAF pilot, Tony Gaze, in July 1977. They settled in Nagambie, Victoria. [3]\n\nDiana and Tony Gaze\n\nShe passed away in her mid-80s on 6th August 2012 at Melbourne. [4] A tribute to Diana by son, Jon, and grandsons read: \"Our family pauses for a moment and raises our eyes towards the Almighty and thanks Him for His divine providence in bringing her to us and sustaining her heroic contribution over her entire adult life.\" [3] She was survived by Tony, four sons, two daughters and seven grandchildren.\n\nDiana Davison in her MG TC\n\nDiana is remembered as a foundation member of Women for Wheels (WFW) in 1971, a group of motorsport wives (and widows) who, initially, raised funds to improve safety facilities at Australian race circuits. [5] Today, WFW are involved in all of the major forms of motor racing in South Australia including circuit racing, drag racing, speedway, hillclimb events and speedboat racing, as well as promotional events and providing fire training for motor sport officials. [6]\n\nThe perpetual Diana Davison/Gaze Trophy offered at the annual Rob Roy Historic and Classic Meeting to the fastest lady driver was named in her honour.
