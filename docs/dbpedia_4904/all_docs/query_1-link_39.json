        "text": "1 Juan Manuel Fangio\n\nArgentine\n\nGrand Prix career 1950-58\n\n24 wins from 51 GPs\n\nWorld champion 1951, '54, '55, '56, '57\n\nNo other driver has won five world championships and no one has come near to his win-rate, close to a victory in every two grands prix. But, statistics apart, it is the manner in which he dominated the sport - and in such perilous times - that places him head and shoulders above the rest. He possessed sublime car control, steering on the throttle and wringing the most out of everything he drove. He was also the most intelligent of drivers, able to nurse an ailing car home. His racing philosophy was, memorably, to win 'at the slowest possible speed'.\n\nGreatest race: German Grand Prix, Nurburgring, 4 August 1957. A botched pit stop left him with a 50-second deficit, but he hurled his Maserati around the fearsome circuit to catch the Ferraris of Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins with only a lap to go. In the process he broke the lap record on several occasions, recording a mark eight seconds faster than his qualifying time.\n\n2 Jim Clark\n\nBritish\n\nGP career 1960-68\n\n25 wins from 72 GPs\n\nWC 1963, 1965\n\nWhen he died at Hockenheim in 1968 Clark was only 32 and already a double world champion. He dominated the Sixties, spending his entire career with Lotus. When his car was on song he often finished the first lap of a race so far ahead of his pursuers that observers thought there had been a pile-up on the far side of the circuit. Whatever he drove he made go faster than anybody else could.\n\nGreatest race: Italian Grand Prix, Monza, 10 Sept 1967. A puncture put Clark a lap behind the leaders but the Scot not only unlapped himself but did the impossible and snatched the lead from Jack Brabham with only a few circuits left - but on the last lap the fuel pumps on his Lotus failed and he was forced to coast across the line in third place.\n\n3 Tazio Nuvolari\n\nItalian\n\nRace career 1924-48\n\n23 major race victories\n\nAfter starting on motorbikes in 1920, Nuvolari once won a race when he was suffering from two broken legs - he had to be tied to his machine. He moved to cars in 1924 and became a legend - 'the flying Mantuan' - driving a Bugatti before signing for Alfa Romeo where he was virtually unbeatable. Most famously he beat the might of Mercedes and Auto Union at the 1935 German Grand Prix whilst driving an out-dated Alfa. In his day there was no such thing as a world championship - had there been he would have won it. Many times.\n\nGreatest race: Mille Miligia, Between Brescia and Rome, Italy, 16-17 April 1930. Nuvolari drove his Alfa Romeo through the night without any headlights so his rival and team-mate, Achille Varzi, could not see him coming. Three miles from the finish he pulled alongside the startled Varzi, grinned at him, flicked on the lights and powered to victory.\n\n4 Ayrton Senna\n\nBrazilian\n\nGP career 1984-94\n\n41 wins from 161 GPs\n\nWC 1988, 1990, 1991\n\nProbably the fastest ever over a single lap, his record of 65 pole positions is unlikely to be beaten. He won three F1 titles (all with McLaren) - his single-minded approach and amazing self-belief made him a fearsome, as well as charismatic competitor. His death at Imola in 1994 remains one of motor sport's darkest moments.\n\nGreatest race: European Grand Prix, Donington Park, 11 April 1993. All Senna's genius came to the fore during the first lap. He qualified fourth, one and a half seconds off Alain Prost's pole position. But on race day it poured with rain and Senna was sublime in the wet. In the course of the first lap he picked off the three cars in front of him (Prost, Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher) and drove off into the distance. When the flag fell only Hill remained on the same lap.\n\n5 Alain Prost\n\nFrench\n\nGP career 1980-93\n\n51 wins from 199 GPs\n\nWC 1985, 1986, 1989, 1993\n\n'The Professor' won 51 grands prix (a record) and four world championships with a driving style that was so smooth it belied how fast he was going. His cerebral approach to racing meant that even if his car wasn't the quickest he was in a position to pick up the pieces if those ahead of him encountered problems - he always had an eye on the bigger picture.\n\nGreatest race: Australian Grand Prix, Adelaide, 26 October 1986. Needing to win to clinch the title he qualified fourth in a McLaren that was no match for Nigel Mansell's Williams. But come the race, he preserved his tyres to perfection while others suffered on the abrasive surface. As the fuel load lightened he pressed on to win and clinch successive titles.\n\n6 Jackie Stewart\n\nBritish\n\nGP career 1965-73\n\n27 wins from 99 GPs\n\nWC 1969, 1971, 1973\n\nFormed a legendary partnership with Ken Tyrrell that brought three world championships. Hugely professional, very determined and incredibly fast, Stewart took over the mantle of F1's leading light after the death of Jim Clark.\n\nGreatest race: German Grand Prix, Nurburgring, 4 August 1968. In driving rain and on a lethal track Stewart left everyone in his wake. After two laps his lead was 34 seconds. By half distance he was almost two minutes to the good. As others tiptoed around and stopped for clean visors Stewart kept his foot down and won by more than four minutes.\n\n7 Michael Schumacher\n\nGerman\n\nGP career 1991- 44 wins from 143 GPs\n\nWC 1994, 1995, 2000\n\nThe best of his era. When he retires he will merit a higher placing, but while there is no doubting his genius behind the wheel there are question marks. He cracks under pressure too often and his tactics can be questionable. But with three world titles to his name already, his place in the pantheon of racing greats is secure.\n\nGreatest race: Spanish Grand Prix, Barcelona, 2 June 1996. The weather was dreadful and he made a poor start from third on the grid, finishing the first lap in sixth place. But from then on he was breathtaking, charging his way through the field, hitting the front on lap 12 and then disappearing into a race of his own as others struggled to merely stay on the road. He won by 45 seconds.\n\n8 Stirling Moss\n\nBritish\n\nGP career 1951-61\n\n16 wins from 66 GPs\n\nFour times a runner-up in the world championship, Moss never won the title. But any list of great drivers that excludes him is worthless. He got as close to Fangio as anybody and given some luck might have been a multiple champion. His career spanned the transition from front to rear-engined cars and he was adept in both.\n\nGreatest race: Monaco Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, 14 May 1961. Moss, in a private Lotus, took the lead early and pulled away as the more powerful Ferraris got held up in traffic. They chased him down though, breaking the lap record in the process. Moss responded by matching their times and held on to win by three seconds after 100 laps of constant pressure.\n\n9 Gilles Villeneuve\n\nCanadian\n\nGP career 1977-82\n\n6 wins from 66 GPs\n\nMaybe the fastest driver of them all. His career was cut short tragically when he died at Zolder in 1982, and he was never allowed to drive a car remotely worthy of his talent, yet he still managed to get to the front and compete with men in far superior machinery. He believed that a racing driver should go as fast as he could and try to win races. He would have been a star in any era and was unfortunate to race at a time when cars didn't permit 'touch' at the wheel.\n\nGreatest race: Qualifying, US Grand Prix (East), Watkins Glen, 5 October 1979. Villeneuve's most staggering achievement. On a wet New York day many drivers considered conditions too dangerous to venture onto the circuit but some did leave their garages in order to post a time. Villeneuve was in determined mood and decided to attack the track. When the times were published the Canadian topped the list by an astounding 11 seconds.\n\n10 Mario Andretti\n\nAmerican\n\nGP career 1968-1982\n\n12 wins from 128 GPs\n\nWC 1978\n\nThe greatest all-rounder. In the mid-Sixties he dominated sprint-car racing in America. He then moved to Indycars, winning the Indy 500 in 1969 and won his first grand prix in 1971 when debuting for Ferrari. He subsequently became world champion with Lotus in 1978. He then returned to the States and became Indycar champion again.\n\nGreatest race: Qualifying, Italian Grand Prix, Monza, 11 September 1982. Ferrari were in turmoil after Villeneuve's death and drafted in an ageing Andretti for their home race. Ferrari needed something to lift the team and Andretti gave it to them by producing one banzai lap, good enough for pole position. He finished third in the race.\n\nJustifying his selectionÉ\n\nThis month's 10 was selected by Observer sports writer Oliver Owen. Here he explains his choices:\n\nOne look at this list and it would appear there are a number of glaring omissions. Three triple world champions are absent - Jack Brabham, Niki Lauda and Nelson Piquet - as are some who never raced Formula One but shone at their own disciplines. American legends such as Fireball Roberts, AJ Foyt, Al Unser or Richard Petty would walk into any top 10 were an American expert to draw up a list. Sportscar specialists, such as Jacky Ickx who won Le Mans on five occasions, are also absent and only one pre-war driver - Tazio Nuvolari - makes the cut. Here's why.\n\nGrand Prix motor racing is the pinnacle of the sport. When judging the best you have to look at the category that attracts the best and that is F1. The drivers on this list dominated with their speed. They were the benchmark against which others judged their own performance.\n\nBeating Fangio in a straight race was virtually impossible. Very few managed it. Qualifying faster than Senna proved beyond his rivals on most occasions. It can be argued that these men had the best cars but the reason for that is simple - they were the best drivers.\n\nComparing drivers from different eras is a tricky business - and a fascinating one. How would Stirling Moss cope in the present day or Schumacher handle a front-engined car with no seat belts? We will never know but it is safe to say that, in their own time, these 10 drivers were the best of the bunch. At their peak each of them made those who saw them shudder at their speed and bravery.\n\nThe sight of a racing driver giving his all is impressive because the consequences of getting it wrong don't bear thinking about. There have been days when a particular driver has found himself in that zone, when he drives away from everyone else. This 10 did it more often than any others. And in the process they stirred the soul.\n\nNow you have your sayÉ\n\nEnraged by our choice? We thought so, and we want to hear why. Write and tell us who your 10 would be, justifying your selection in no more than 50 words. A selection of your 10s will be published next month."
