        "text": "For the fourth year in succession the New Zealand Grand Prix, run at Ardmore for the last time, was headed by the eternal triangle' of Moss, Brabham and McLaren. All overseas entrants were now at the wheel of Inter-Continental Formula cars, machines with a maximum capacity of 3 litres, as compared with the current Formula I limit of 1.5 litres.\n\nMoss had Rob Walker send both a Lotus and Cooper car. The Lotus was a new 21 having a 2500cc Climax motor. This car had not yet raced. The Cooper was the latest T55 with a 2750cc Climax motor. It had only raced once in the Aintree 200. Jack Brabhams car was his own 2750cc Cooper T55, and McLaren was driving his specially modified 2750cc Cooper T53 car belonging to Tommy Atkins. The chassis itself was Brabham's 1960 works car.\n\nThe 23-year-old Italian driver Lorenzo Bandini was the only newcomer to New Zealand; his car was a 2890cc Cooper-Maserati T53 entered by Scuderia Centro-Sud.\n\nJohn Surtees and Roy Salvadori returned to represent the Bowmaker-Yeoman Racing Team of Coopers. They had T55's with a 2750cc and 2600cc motors respectively. Australian Lex Davison drove a 2500cc T55 Cooper for the same stable, still managed by Parnell. Ron Flockhart entered his own yellow 2500cc Lotus 18.\n\nBib Stillwell brought his 3-litre Aston-Martin over from Australia and Arnold Glass raced his red ex-works 2500cc BRM P48. David McKay was at the wheel of a 2500cc Cooper-Climax T51 belonging to Scuderia Veloce, a new team he had formed. The car was a regular visitor to Ardmore, having been driven by Brabham in 1960 and Flockhart in 1961.\n\nStirling Moss and Lorenzo Bandini chatting\n\nDenny Hulme did not consider it financially worthwhile to return to New Zealand, so leading local entrant was Angus Hyslop with his completely rebuilt Cooper, now housing a 2500cc motor. It was a T45 rebuilt to T53 'lowline' specs. Johnny Mansel had negotiated with the Centro-Sud team and signed to drive their 2890cc Cooper-Maserati T51 during the season. This was an updated T51 with double wishbones and coils at the back. His ex-Hulme Cooper-Climax T51 had been bought by Bill Thomasen. It was still using the 2000cc Climax motor.\n\nRex Flowers (Gemini-Ford MK IIIa)\n\nTaking place of the heats was a national race, the fastest six drivers in which would be offered positions on the grid of the Grand Prix. Leading cars among the entrants (other than those already entered in the Grand Prix) were the 250F Maseratis of Bob Eade and Brian Prescott. Sports-cars were entered for Bill Gardiner (Tojeiro), Barry Cottle and Doug Lawrence (Lola) and former saloon-driver Simon Taylor (D-type Jaguar). The rest of the field was made up of small sports-cars and outmoded Cooper 500s.\n\nPractice was held in pouring rain, and times were in consequence very slow. Neither Moss nor Brabham was expected to be at practice because the planes on which they were due to travel out were snowbound in Britain.\n\nHowever, Brabham was eventually able to get here, having utilised a roundabout route from the Continent, and was second fastest. McLaren was fastest with 1min 25.4 sec, a time which reflects the track conditions. Brabhams time was 1:25.7, next being Surtees 1:26.8, Hyslop 1:27.3, Salvadori 1:29.0, Davison 1:32.5, Stillwell 1:32.7 and Shelly 1:33.0.\n\nAn unofficial practice was held on the Friday, the times being valueless for grid position qualification, but very interesting nevertheless. In the dry, Brabham was credited with a fantastic 1:16.3 (94 mph), and Moss, who decided to drive the Lotus, was not much slower at 1:17.1.\n\nThe New Zealanders' race was an easy one for Hyslop, although Hoare, who finished second, and Mansel, who was third, both led in the early laps. Tony Shelly was fourth. This race, run on a dry track, produced the day's fastest laps, Hyslop doing 1:22.6 (87 mph) and Hoare 1:22.9.\n\nScuderia Centro-Sud boss Guglielmo Dei (centre) with drivers Bandini (on his left),\n\nJohnny Mansel (right) and mechanics\n\nThe grid placings were taken from the Thursday's practice times plus the faster qualifiers (from Mansel back on the grid) in the national race. McLaren was on pole, followed by, in order, Brabham, Surtees, Hyslop, Salvadori, Davison, Stillwell, Shelly, McKay, Glass, Hoare, Flockhart, Bandini, Palmer, Mansel, Thomasen, Amon, Greenville, Cardon, Histed and Moss. Moss was at the back because he had missed Thursday's qualifying completely.\n\nAquaplaning around the circuit with uncanny anticipation and unruffled calm, Moss shot through to an astounding win in a downpour which started precisely as the flag fell.\n\nThe only driver to stick with Moss in the flying Lotus 2.5 was Surtees. Though lapped by Moss he clung on behind, and when the race was shortened to 100 miles from the standard 150 owing to the weather, Surtees nipped by again to finish on the same lap as Moss.\n\nOtherwise it was a cataclysmic experience for the rest of the field. McLaren, tipped to win in dry conditions, finished two laps further back in third place, and Roy Salvadori in the second Bowmaker-Yeoman Cooper hung on for fourth with 47 laps completed.\n\nThere was one thing certain at the end of the race, that on the day no other driver of the present could have lived with Moss, and it is doubtful whether another driver of any previous era could have beaten him.\n\nWhile others were snaking all over the track, spinning up and sometimes colliding (mercifully with no serious results), Moss continued serenely. He did lose the Lotus once, but once only, when he struck a broad expanse of water lying at the entrance to Pit Straight. His driving was an awe-inspiring sight, and one which kept most of the drenched crowd of 45,000 on the course until the race was terminated.\n\nMoss won in the astounding time, in the circumstances, of 83m 14.8s, an average of 72.3 mph and almost exactly the average returned by Australian Stan Jones in winning the first NZGP in the dry. Moss's fastest lap was 1m 32.8s (78 mph); Surtees put in a lap of 1m 34.2s and McLaren one of 1m 34.9. Alone among the Internationals Brabham elected to run on dry-weather tyres, and before going out with a jammed gear selector he had a desperate struggle to keep his car on the track.\n\nAppalling conditions. Ron Flockhart (8) and Arnold Glass (9) inside him."
