        "text": "Formula 1 is back with a 23-race schedule for 2023, as Max Verstappen defends his championship for the second time in succession.\n\nThe F1 calendar has seen numerous changes in recent years. New circuits have joined the calendar, such as the Jeddah Corniche Circuit in Saudi Arabia, while previous Grands Prix such as Melbourne and Singapore will returned to the fold in 2022 after the Covid-19 pandemic. The Canadian and Japanese Grands Prix were also cancelled in recent years for similar reasons.\n\nThe calendar continues to grow, after the Las Vegas Grand Prix was announced for the 2023 season, making it the third American circuit on the calendar, after Austin and Miami. The latter of this made its debut in the 2022 season.\n\nThe Qatar Grand Prix wasn't present in the 2022 season, as the event changes venue, but it will return to the calendar for 2023. The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai has again been cancelled for next season, though, with Formula 1 citing the \"ongoing difficulties\" of Covid-19 restrictions in the country.\n\nThe Sporting News takes a look at all the confirmed circuits for the 2023 F1 race calendar.\n\nMORE: When is the next Formula 1 race? F1 schedule, date, start time for 2022\n\nBahrain Grand Prix\n\nCircuit location: Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir\n\nDate: March 5, 2023\n\nTime of day: Night\n\nCircuit type: Race\n\nContract runs until: 2036\n\nLap record: 1:31.447 by Pedro de la Rosa (2005)\n\nFirst Grand Prix: 2004\n\nMost wins: Lewis Hamilton\n\nThe Bahrain Grand Prix was a day race for the first decade of its existence, but in 2014 the change was made to stage it at night.

That will continue to be the case in 2023.\n\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix\n\nCurrent location: Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah\n\nDate: March 19, 2023\n\nTime of day: Night\n\nCircuit type: Street\n\nContract runs until: 2036\n\nLap record: 1:30.734 by Lewis Hamilton (2021)\n\nFirst Grand Prix: 2021\n\nMost wins: Lewis Hamilton/Max Verstappen\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is a fairly new addition to the calendar.

Historically, the Australian Grand Prix was the season finale, but it has moved earlier in the calendar and been one of the first races in the season over the past few decades.\n\nAlbert Park has seen changes to make the track faster in recent years and should make for a great spectacle. A fourth DRS zone has also been added for this season's race.\n\nMORE: Formula 1 beginners' guide: Scoring system, how F1 Sprint works, salaries, pit stop rules & more\n\nAzerbaijan Grand Prix\n\nCurrent location: Baku City Circuit, Azerbaijan\n\nDate: April 30, 2023\n\nTime of day: Afternoon\n\nCircuit type: Street\n\nContract runs until: 2024\n\nLap record: 1:43.009 by Charles Leclerc (2019)\n\nFirst Grand Prix: 2017\n\nMost wins: No repeat winners\n\nThe Azerbaijan Grand Prix is a relatively new street circuit.

It returned the next year as a replacement for the Chinese Grand Prix, and a contract was signed for Formula One to keep it as part of the calendar until 2025.\n\nImola – or Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari, to give the circuit its full name – is a historic circuit.

Since the first race in 1972, the Brazilian Grand Prix has been an uninterrupted presence in the calendar, aside from 2020 when it was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Grand Prix is typically one of the final races of the season and, as such, it occurs at a time where every point matters.
