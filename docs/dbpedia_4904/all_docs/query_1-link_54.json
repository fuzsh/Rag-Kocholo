A well formed opinion is one based in fact, not heresay and conjecture or rose tinted glasses.\n\nQuote ( Gunter Bosman @ June 1st 2008,13:51:39 )\n\n\"Baghetti is one of only three drivers to have won his first World Championship race\"\n\nFarina doesn't really count does he? I mean, he was racing Pre-War, and someone was going to win the first race at their first attempt.\n\nQuote ( Josh Mulholland @ May 30th 2008,15:48:17 )\n\nim surprised no one has mentioned giles villeneuve, in my eyes the best driver.\n\nRegarded as dangerous, unpredictable and a menace on the race track. Ask John Watson what he really thinks.\n\nQuote ( Toygun Senler @ May 30th 2008,18:23:58 )\n\nSchumi joined in 1996.He needed 3 years to put things into his way and would have been the world champ in 1999 if he did not break his leg.\n\nTaking a non-winning team and making it the dominant force of F1 is what I respect most.\n\nGiving Schumacher the creit alone is unfair. Todt played a huge part, and their success was more due to the Byrne/Brawn/Schumacher combination, rather than Schumacher alone. Christopher Hilton has written a rather interesting book which chronicles time lines and so forth of the transition from Barnard and the design house in Chiswick to moving it all back to Maranello.\n\nQuote ( James Coughlan @ May 31st 2008,11:47:40 )\n\nDamon Hill ;)\n\nYou deserve to be beaten with a sack of door knobs for such slander.\n\nQuote ( Paul Bryant @ May 31st 2008,11:51:30 )\n\nHakkinen and so on were great drivers\n\nHakkinen got lucky to be in the right car at the right time. Look back at his days at Lotus; Johnny Herbert crushed him. Had it been Herbert in that car rather than his move to Benetton (alongside Schumacher) history could well have been very different.\n\nMy striking memory of Hakkinen was in '91 before the Adelaide Grand Prix. He was doing some PR at a BP garage, complaining about having to do it. Herbert turned to him and said \"stop you're bloody complaining and just do it\", or words to that affect. My memory has faded somewhat over the years."
