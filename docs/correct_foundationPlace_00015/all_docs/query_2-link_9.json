        "text": "Command of DOS, OS/2, Microsoft Windows, Unix and Unix-like operating systems\n\nFor other uses, see Echo (disambiguation).\n\nechoOriginal author(s)Douglas McIlroy\n\n(AT&T Bell Laboratories)Developer(s)Various open-source and commercial developersOperating systemMultics, Unix, Unix-like, V, Plan 9, Inferno, FLEX, TRIPOS, AmigaDOS, Z80-RIO, OS-9, DOS, MSX-DOS, Panos, FlexOS, SISNE plus, OS/2, Windows, ReactOS, MPE/iX, KolibriOS, SymbOSPlatformCross-platformTypeCommand\n\nIn computing, echo is a command that outputs the strings that are passed to it as arguments. It is a command available in various operating system shells and typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen[1] or a computer file, or as a source part of a pipeline.\n\nThe command is available in the following operating systems:\n\nMultics[2]\n\nTSC FLEX[3]\n\nMetaComCo TRIPOS[4]\n\nZilog Z80-RIO[5]\n\nMicroware OS-9[6]\n\nDOS\n\nAcorn Computers Panos[7]\n\nDigital Research FlexOS[8]\n\nIBM OS/2[9]\n\nMicrosoft Windows[10]\n\nReactOS[11]\n\nHP MPE/iX[12]\n\nKolibriOS[13]\n\nSymbOS\n\nUnix and Unix-like operating systems\n\nMany shells, including all Bourne-like (such as Bash[14] or zsh[15]) and Csh-like shells as well as COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe implement echo as a builtin command.\n\nThe command is also available in the EFI shell.[16]\n\necho began within Multics. After it was programmed in C by Doug McIlroy as a \"finger exercise\" and proved to be useful, it became part of Version 2 Unix. echo -n in Version 7 replaced prompt, (which behaved like echo but without terminating its output with a line delimiter).[17]\n\nOn PWB/UNIX and later Unix System III, echo started expanding C escape sequences such as \\n with the notable difference that octal escape sequences were expressed as \\0ooo instead of \\ooo in C.[18]\n\nEighth Edition Unix echo only did the escape expansion when passed a -e option,[19] and that behaviour was copied by a few other implementations such as the builtin echo command of Bash or zsh and GNU echo.\n\nOn MS-DOS, the command is available in versions 2 and later.[20]\n\nNowadays, several incompatible implementations of echo exist on different operating systems (often several on the same system), some of them expanding escape sequences by default, some of them not, some of them accepting options (the list of which varying with implementations), some of them not.\n\nThe POSIX specification of echo[21] leaves the behaviour unspecified if the first argument is -n or any argument contain backslash characters while the Unix specification (XSI option in POSIX) mandates the expansion of (some) sequences and does not allow any option processing. In practice, many echo implementations are not compliant in the default environment.\n\nBecause of these variations in behaviour, echo is considered a non-portable command on Unix-like systems[22] and the printf command (where available, introduced by Ninth Edition Unix) is preferred instead.\n\nC:\\>echo Hello world Hello world\n\nUsing ANSI escape code SGR sequences, compatible terminals can print out colored text.\n\nUsing a UNIX System III-style implementation:\n\nBGRED=`echo\"\\033[41m\"` FGBLUE=`echo\"\\033[35m\"` BGGREEN=`echo\"\\033[42m\"` NORMAL=`echo\"\\033[m\"`\n\nOr a Unix Version 8-style implementation (such as Bash when not in Unix-conformance mode):\n\nBGRED=`echo -e\"\\033[41m\"` FGBLUE=`echo -e\"\\033[35m\"` BGGREEN=`echo -e\"\\033[42m\"` NORMAL=`echo -e\"\\033[m\"`\n\nand after:\n\necho\"${FGBLUE} Text in blue ${NORMAL}\" echo\"Text normal\" echo\"${BGRED} Background in red\" echo\"${BGGREEN} Background in Green and back to Normal ${NORMAL}\"\n\nPortably with printf:\n\nBGRED=`printf'\\33[41m'` NORMAL=`printf'\\33[m'` printf'%s\\n'\"${BGRED}Text on red background${NORMAL}\"\n\nList of Unix commands\n\nList of DOS commands\n\nWolverton, Van (1990).
