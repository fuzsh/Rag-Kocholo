        "text": "A computer system has many resources (hardware and software), which may be require to complete a task. The commonly required resources are input/output devices, memory, file storage space, CPU etc. The operating system acts as a manager of the above resources and allocates them to specific programs and users, whenever necessary to perform a particular task. Therefore operating system is the resource manager i.e. it can manage the resource of a computer system internally. The resources are processor, memory, files, and I/O devices. An operating system is the interface between the user and the machine. Before there were operating systems, people only used computers using analog signals and digital signals. Along with the development of knowledge and technology, at this time there are various operating systems with their respective advantages.\n\nVarious operating systems (OS) with numerous functions and features have appeared over time. As a result, they know how each OS has been implemented guides users' decisions on configuring the OS on their machines. Consequently, a comparative study of different operating systems is needed to provide specifics on the same and variance in novel types of OS to address their flaws. This paper's center of attention is the visual operating system based on the OS features and their limitations and strengths by contrasting iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. Linux, Android, and Windows 10 are more stable, more compatible, and more reliable operating systems. Linux, Android, and Windows are popular enough to become user-friendly, unlike other OSs, and make more application programs. The firewalls in Mac OS X and Windows 10 are built-in. The most popular platforms are Android and Windows, specifically the novelist versions. It is because they are low-cost, dependable, compatible, safe, and easy to use. Furthermore, modern developments in issues resulting from the advent of emerging technology and the growth of the cell phone introduced many features such as high-speed processors, massive memory, multitasking, high-resolution displays, functional telecommunication hardware, and so on. This review thesis is presented through two distinct perspectives: detailing several concerns related to the types of kernels and merits used and evaluating how novel technologies are evaluated, and assessing underperformance.\n\nAn operating system mediates among application programs, utilities, and users, on the one hand, and the computer system hardware on the other. To appreciate the functionality of the operating system and the design issues involved, one must have some appreciation for computer organization and architecture. Chapter 1 provides a brief survey of the processor, memory, and Input/Output (I/O) elements of a computer system. The topic of operating system (OS) design covers a huge territory, and it is easy to get lost in the details and lose the context of a discussion of a particular issue. Chapter 2 provides an overview to which the reader can return at any point in the book for context. We begin with a statement of the objectives and functions of an operating system. Then some historically important systems and OS functions are described. This discussion allows us to present some fundamental OS design principles in a simple environment so that the relationship among various OS functions is clear. The chapter next highlights important characteristics of modern operating systems. Throughout the book, as various topics are discussed, it is necessary to talk about both fundamental, well-established principles as well as more recent innovations in OS design. The discussion in this chapter alerts the reader to this blend of established and recent design approaches that must be addressed. Finally, we present an overview of Windows, UNIX, and Linux; this discussion establishes the general architecture of these systems, providing context for the detailed discussions to follow."
