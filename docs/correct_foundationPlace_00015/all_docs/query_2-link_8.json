Author: Mike Schwartz cc Unix-like frontend for Lattice C compiler. Author: Fred Fish dbug Macro based C debugging package. Machine independent. Provides function trace, selective printing of internal state information, and more. Author: Fred Fish make Subset of \"unix\" make command. Useful, but does not have many of the features of the full make, much less the newer \"augmented make\". Author: Landon Dyer make2 Another make subset command. Author: Marc Mengel microemacs Small, relatively portable version of emacs. Has keyboard macros. No extension language. Author: Dave Conroy portar Portable archiver. Used to bundle text file up into a single file for transmission as a unit, or otherwise handling as a single file. \"Portable\" because the code itself is portable and because the archive format is very simple (uses ascii headers to separate files). From Decus C distribution. Author: Martin Minow xrf C cross reference utility. Originally from Decus C distribution. Author: Bob Denny CONTENTS OF DISK 3 ================== gothic Gothic banner printer. Prints DOWN the page, rather than across, so arbitrarily long banners can be created. Send EOF (CTRL-\\) to end input. From a Decus C distribution several years ago. Author: unknown roff A \"roff\" type text formatter, roughly following \"Software Tools\" version.

Needs work, but will probably be worth it. Author: Bob Corbett and Richard Stallman bm A grep like utility using the Boyer-Moore algorithm. Author: Peter Bain grep Decus grep (Get Regular Expression and Print). Useful for finding strings in files. Author: Unknown kermit This is an absolutely ancient kermit, who's only saving grace is that it is small and quite portable. On the AMIGA, there is no connect mode, only send and receive. You must log into the remote machine via one of it's local terminals and point it's kermit at the appropriate serial line connected to the AMIGA. Author: Unknown, but it is so hacked up it doesn't matter by now. MyCLI Another CLI for the AMIGA. Author: Mike Schwartz mandel A Mandelbrot set program.

Includes dynamic allocation of data structures needed to communicate with the timer device, as well as the actual device IO. Author: Rob Peck 12/1/85 trackdisk Demonstrates use of trackdisk driver. Useful example of \"raw\" disk read/write. Author Rob Peck 12/1/85 CONTENTS OF DISK 6 ================== compress Compress reduces the size of the named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding. The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the number of bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is generally much better then that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in \"pack\") or adaptive Huffman coding (as used in \"compact\"), and takes less time to compute. Great for saving disk space, or reducing transmission time over phone lines! Also includes \"btoa\" and \"atob\" for converting binary files to ascii, and then back to binary (for transmission over links that do not support 8 bits). Author: Thomas Spencer, with improvements by others dadc A digital computer impersonating an analog clock impersonating a digital clock. Author: Perry S. Kivolowitz microemacs An upgraded version of microemacs originally distributed on disk number 2. I don't have an exact list of changes but the new executable is about 25% larger, so there must be something in there! One enhancement is that some functions are now also bound to function keys. Author: Dave Conroy, with enhancements by Jack Roose. mult Mult reads the input comparing adjacent lines. In the normal case, the second and succeeding copies of repeated lines are output, and the remainder of the lines are removed. Repeated lines must be adjacent in order to be found. Options are present to output the first of multiple lines, for comparing adjacent lines by field only, and for specifying the field separator character. Kind of the opposite of the Unix \"uniq\" program. Author: Dennis Bednar scales Demonstrates use of the Audio functions in the ROM to produce four voice sound. It uses a simple waveform (sawtooth) with no amplitude control (ie, envelope) or frequency variation (ie, vibrato), but these can be easily implemented. Also includes considerable documentation on audio device. Author: Steven A. Bennett setparallel Allows the CLI user to dynamically change any particular parallel port parameter. Author: Keith Stobie and Tom Pohorsky setserial Allows the CLI user to dynamically change any particular serial port parameter. Author: Keith Stobie and Tom Pohorsky sortc A quicksort based sort program, using separate driver and sort modules. Originally from a DECUS C distribution. Claims to be fast, but when operating entirely out of ram takes 93 seconds to sort its input file, sort.c, while AmigaDos's sort takes only 43 seconds under the same conditions. Author: Dave Conroy, Martin Minow, and Ray Van Tassle stripc Strips comments and extraneous whitespace from C source files. Useful for compacting the C header files to increase usable disk space. Author: Chris Metcalf CONTENTS OF DISK 7 ================== Hack This disk contains a port (executables only) of the popular UNIX game \"Hack\", courtesy of John Toebes, 120 H Northington Pl, Cary NC. 27511.

Author: Paul Biondo pictures Miscellaneous DPaint and digitized pictures, in iff format. Some are rated R. CONTENTS OF DISK 12 =================== BBS Stuff Note that this disk contains a number of programs apparently available only in executable form. I am not real happy with this trend, but had no way of getting in contact with the authors who posted these programs to various BBS's to request source.

It is tested and seems to work well except for a couple glitches noticed at the last minute (see the README file). Compress reduces the size of the named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding. The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the number of bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is generally much better then that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in \"pack\") or adaptive Huffman coding (as used in \"compact\"), and takes less time to compute.

Author: Mark Horton with mods by Alan Rosenthal CONTENTS OF DISK 54 =================== Hanoi Classical demo program for recursion. Solves the towers of hanoi problem in a workbench window of its own. Author: Ali Ozer ISpell A quick and dirty port of a Unix version of a freely distributable screen oriented, interactive, spelling checker. I use the Unix version daily and it is very nice. You will need expansion ram to run this with the supplied dictionary, as it loads the entire 300K hashed dictionary into memory. A hard disk is also recommended.

This is version 1.0.3D. Note that this disk must be named \"Hack_Game\". I have elected to keep that name, rather than using the usual \"AmigaLibDiskXX\" convention for disks in my library, to avoid requiring users to rename the disk before using it. CONTENTS OF DISK 63 =================== Larn This disk contains a port of the popular UNIX game \"Larn\", done by Edmund Burnette and the crew at the Software Distillery. This is version 12.0B. Note that this disk must be named \"Larn\".

CONTENTS OF DISK 64 =================== Developer's IFF This is a copy of the Amiga Developer's IFF disk, received directly from Commodore-Amiga sources, with permission to place in the library and redistribute. It is an update to disk number 16, and is unchanged except for: CONTENTS OF DISK 65 =================== Bawk Text processor inspired by the Unix awk utility. Bawk searches files for specific patterns and performs actions for every occurance of these patterns. The patterns can be regular expressions. The actions are expressed using a subset of the C language. Unfortunately this version always gets a stack overflow no matter what the stack is set to, I haven't had a chance to find the bug. Includes source, so you can hunt for it. Looks like it could be a very useful utility for the Amiga.

Author: Matt Dillon NewPackets Tutorial downloaded from BIX C-A support section, which describes some new packets and structures in 1.2 AmigaDos. Author: Carolyn Scheppner PascalToC A Pascal to C translator program which is supposed to correctly handle function, procedure, and most type declarations. However, this quick and dirty port didn't fare too well on even a simple little Pascal fragment from Software Tools in Pascal. I don't know if the problem is machine dependencies in the code or bugs. Looks like it could be useful with a little more work than I have time to put into it now. Includes source. Author: James Mullens, enhancements by Dan Kegel Prep Version 2.1 of a Fortran preprocessor called 'prep', an alternative to ratfor. Prep has better macro facilities, a concise shorthand for array and vector statements, all the standard flow control constructs of forth, and is written in generic, portable C (I made no source changes).

Author: Hari Wiguna CONTENTS OF DISK 68 =================== MicroGNUEmacs This diskette contains the latest Amiga version of MicroGNUEmacs (MG 1b), a small but powerful text editor that also runs on many other computer systems besides the Amiga. One of MG's major goals is to be compatible with its \"cousin\" GNU Emacs, so certain features you may have seen in other versions of MicroEmacs may work differently here, or not exist. Hopefully, you'll find the added features MG provides to be worth the trouble it takes to make the switch. As well as the commands available on *all* systems MG supports, Amiga MG has many Amiga-specific features: the Amiga mouse (with 24 different functions!), Intuition pull-down menus, the Browser (a very nice way to select files), Amiga function keys, a full-screen editing window, and support for using a different text font in the editing window. The current version is known to run on the following systems: 4.2 & 4.3 BSD Unix, Sun 3.2; Ultrix- 32 (BSD Unix); OS9/68k; VMS; Amiga; System V; Eunice; Primos; Cpm/68k; Atari ST MicroGNUEmacs is based on the original work of Dave Conroy, author of the public domain v30 version. It has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of the following people: mwm@ucbopal.berkeley.edu (Mike Meyer), mic@ngp.utexas.edu (Mic Kaczmarczik), blarson@usc- eclb.arpa (Bob Larson), rtech!daveb@sun.com (Dave Brower) (previous version) CONTENTS OF DISK 69 =================== Asm68k Full featured macro assembler, version 1.0.3, binary only.
