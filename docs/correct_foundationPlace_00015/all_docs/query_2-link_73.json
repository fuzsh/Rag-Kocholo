Flight Simulator II inciurfes full flight instrumentation and avionics, and provides a full-color out-che- v/indow view. Instruments are arranged in the format standard to modern aircraft. All the radios needed for IFR flight are included. Front, rear, left, right, and diagonal views let you look in any direction. Program features are clearly documented in a 96-page Pilot's Operat- ing Handbook, For training in proper flight techniques, Flight Simulator II includes another 96-page instruction manual, compiled by two professional flight instructors with over 8,000 hours flight time and 12,000 hours of aviation teaching experience. You'll learn correct FAA- recommended flight procedures, from basic aircraft control through instrument approaches. To reward your accomplishments, the manual even includes a section on aerobatic maneuvers. The Realism and Beauty of Flight Go sight-seeing over detailed, realistic United States - scenery. High-speed graphic drivers provide an animated out-the-window view in either day, dusk, or _ night flying modes. Flight Simulator 11 features over 80 airports in four different scenery areas: New York, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Six additional Scenery Disks covering the entire Western half of the United States are now available in IBM and C64/ 1 28 disk formats. S t »■ ,*v^S<1»->T.': Apple and Atari versions will be released soon. Each disk covers a .' geographical region of the country in detail, and is very reasonably priced. The Pure Fun of \"World War I Ace\" When you think you're ready, you can test your flying skills with the \"World War I Ace\" aerial battle game. This game sends you on a bombing run over heavily-defended enemy territory. Six enemy fighters will attempt to engage you in combat as soon as war is declared. Your aircraft can carry five bombs, and your machine guns are loaded with 100 rounds of ammunition. See Your Dealer, Flight Simulator II is available on disk for the Apple 11, Atari XL/XE, and Commodore 64/128 computers for $49.9S.

Publications, Inc. is looking for the very best original software for the Atari ST series computers. And to prove we're serious, we're offering a total of $10,000.00 in prize money to the top six winners. That's $5,000.00 for First Prize, $2,500.00 for Second Prize, $1,000.00 for Third Prize, and $500.00 each for three Honorable Mentions. In addition, the winners will receive our standard royalties when their programs are published. And even if your program doesn't win a prize, you can still earn purchase fees and royalties if we accept your entry for publication. Interested? If so, read these rules: 1. Entries must be your original work, previously unpublished. All those whose programs are accepted will be required to affirm this in writing. 2. You can submit as many entries as you want, but we cannot consider programs which have been entered in other contests or submitted for publication elsewhere at the same time. 3. The deadline is October 1, 1986. All entries must be received at our offices by this date. Programs submitted after this date will still be consid- ered for publication, but will not be entered in the contest. 4. Entries are allowed (and encouraged) in virtually all software categories: home and business applications, education, recreation, telecommu- nications, graphics, sound and music, utilities, and desk accessories. 5. Entries may be written in any programming language — including BASIC, Logo, C, machine language, Pascal, Modula-2, Forth, FORTRAN, and Prolog — as long as they meet two requirements. First, if you're using a compiled language, the compiled object or run-time code must be a self- standing program that can be run by someone who doesn't own a copy of the language. (Exceptions are ST BASIC and Logo. Since these languages come with the ST, it can be assumed that everyone owns a copy.) Second, we must be able to legally distribute the program without incurring licens- ing fees or other obligations to the maker of the language. If you're not sure whether a certain language qualifies, contact its maker for clarification. 6. Entries must be submitted on a single- or double-sided S'A-inch ST disk with both the run-time code and source code included. 7. Entries must be accompanied by an article which explains how to use the program, what it does, and so on. If your program employs any new or un- usual techniques that you think will be of interest to other ST pro- grammers, you can also describe how the program works, 8. Submissions which do not win a prize and are not accepted for publica- tion will be returned only if accompanied by a self-addressed, stamped mailer. 9. All judging will be handled by the staff of COMPUTE! Publications, Inc. All decisions regarding contest entries and acceptances will be solely at the discretion of COMPUTE! Publications, Inc., and all decisions are final. This includes decisions regarding creativity, similarity among entries, and so forth. 10. Winners will be announced by COMPUTE! Publications, Inc. in late 1986. 11. This contest is void where prohibited by law. Full-time, part-time & previous employees of COMPUTE! Publications, Inc., and Capital Cities/ American Broadcasting Corporation are ineligible for the contest, but may still submit work for publication at standard rates. Every Contest Entry Must Contain This Form: 1 warrant that the program presently entitled is my own original work and that the work has not been submitted for consideration elsewhere, nor has it been previously published. If my work is accepted by you, 1 under- stand that your decision as to the selection of winners and awarding of prizes is final and without recourse on my part. 1 agree, should you select my submission, to sign your standard contract, which inciudes assignment of the copyright of the program to COMPUTE!, and to allow you to use my name and image in promotional materials and other forms.

Inc. ^^^ One of the ABC Publishing Cornpxjnies Announcing major news for Atari ST users: DISK & MAGAZINE A bimonthly magazine devoted exciusively to Atari ST entiiusiosts that includes a disk containing all of the programs found in each issue. Atari has proven the pessimists wrong. The Atari 520ST and 1040ST have become the bestsellers among the new generation of personal computers. Both are break- throughs in price and performance, and the community of ST owners is growing by thousands each month. That's one reason why COMPUTE! Publications is announcing a new magazine specially designed for ST users. At the same time, we recognize that the power of the ST presents a unique challenge to magazines which publish program listings. That's why we're including a 3V2-inch disk that contains every program found in each issue — ready to load and run. No more typing! Here's what you'll get in every issue of COMPUTEI's Atari ST Disk & Magazine: • Top-quality programs. Utilities. Games. Educational programs for youngsters. Application programs for home and business. And since all the programs will be on disk, there are few limitations on length or lan- guages. A typical disk might contain an elaborate adventure game written in BASIC, a programming utility written in machine language, a dazzling graphics demo in compiled Pascal, and a useful home or business application written in Forth or C. • Neochrome of the Month. Take a look at what com- puter artists are doing with the Atari ST. Each issue's disk contains a Neochrome picture file ready for you to load and admire. Are you an artist yourself? Send us a picture of your own, and we'll pay you if it's published. • Regular columns. If you're a programmer — or would like to be — you'll love our columns on ST programming techniques and the C language. Or check out our column on the latest events and happenings throughout the ST community. Or send your questions and helpful hints to our Reader's Feedback column. • Reviews. Honest evaluations of the latest software and hardware for the Atari ST. • News & Products. A comprehensive listing of the newest releases for your ST. COMPUTE'^ f AAfei^Frf' ^iMubv^ • And more: Interviews with ST newsmakers, reports on the latest industry trade shows, and overviews of significant new product introductions. Starting with the October issue (available September 1), COMPUTEI's Atari ST Disk & Magazine will be found on newsstands nationwide for only $12.95 per copy, including disk. Or it can be delivered directly to your mailbox six times a year for only $59,95 — a savings of over 20 percent.

It is something we pride ourselves on doing well, and our family of publications, both books and magazines, represents a signifi- cant and ongoing commitmerit to quality of product. We are a fluid group, at least internally, and have been fortunate in that we managed, as an editorial group, to avoid most of the pit- falls of overexpansion that befell many of our publishing col- leagues in this industry's jarring setbacks of 1984 and 1985. Tom HalfhUl, most recently editor of COMPUTE!, has now taken the reins of our newest publication, COMPUTE'S Atari ST Disk & Mag- azine. It's our most massive disk- based undertaking to date, and no publishing house in the his- tory of this industry has ever dared place tens of thousands of bound-in disks into general newsstand distribution. Lance Elko, long our editor of COM- PUTE's GAZETTE, is expanding his duties to encompass COM- PUTE!. We are confident this move will strengthen COM- PUTE!, and help us in our con- tinuing efforts to provide you with a constantly growing, and improving, publication. We wel- come Lance to his new responsi- bilities, and can assure him, from long experience, that you out there will be the first to let him know how things are going. A Software Product Note While on the subject of COM- PUTEI's Atari ST Disk & Magazine, we'd like to mention an impor- tant concern. This is a truly inte- grated product — the magazine documents, nurtures, and tutors the disk. The programs, like- wise, appear only on the disk. In short, you need the two parts to make the whole. One of our vendors' biggest concerns for this magazine was that of re- moval of the disk. After all, they argued, this is an expensive item, and so on. It is of major concern to us that you, as poten- tial readers, be able to handle the magazine and browse the printed pages. For this reason, you will find that the newest magazine we publish has a bound-in disk. And pages that open for previewing. We're rely- ing on you to prove us right. And, as always, COMPUTE! disk products are produced so that you can immediately, and easUy, create your own backup. We do not engage in copy-protection, We expect you to refuse to en- gage in copying. A Rare Exception We do not frequently partici- pate, in these pages, in a hand wringing regarding the ebbs and flows of our staff page. This is not, after all, afternoon television. Our rare exception usually regards the move hither or yon of an editor or two as mentioned earlier in this piece. This month we must make a far more nota- ble exception. Mr. Charles Bran- non, of our resident staff, has accepted new employment, and we want not only to wish him well, but to devote to him a few sentences on this page. Charles, known by many of you as the author of SpeedScript, an incred- ibly sophisticated piece of COM- PUTE!'s \"giftware,\" came to work for us in 1980 as a high school student, doing program listings after school. (Dver the years Charles grew and evolved into a very senior young mem- ber of our staff, achieving the position of program editor, and the person behind many, many of the significant programs we have developed and published here. We have many talented people, and would not wish these accolades for Charles to diminish that collective excel- lence. But there is, after all, only one SpeedScript and Superfont, and well, Charles, we'll miss you, and we appreciate all the tremendous service you have provided to the readers and us- ers of these publications over the last few years. We wish you well in your new venture. Until next time, enjoy your issue. And watch for COM- PUTE's Atari ST Disk & Magazine, appearing on your local news- stand in early September. @ Robert C.

STRINGS, SPACE$, And CHR$ I have a suggestion for people who submit or translate IBM PC/PCjr pro- grams for publication in your maga- zine. Whenever a BASIC program line requires that I type a long series of spaces, I find it difficult to tell exactly how many spaces are needed. This can be frustrating, because the \"Automatic Proofreader\" keeps signaling an error until I finally get the right number by trial and error. The STRINGS function can easily eliminate this problem. For instance, the statement PRINT STRING$(15,32) has exactly the same effect as PRINT \" \" and is much easier to type in. STRINGS can be used where any long series of identi- cal characters is needed. For instance, PRINT STRING$(40,46) prints a line consisting of 40 dots. Richard J. Patton This is an excellent suggestion, and the same general advice applies to every ver- sion of BASIC. Some versions include STRINGS, which works exactly as in IBM BASIC; Amiga BASIC even includes a specialized SPACES function for creating a string of spaces. For BASICs that don't support either function, you can do the same job through concatenation. To create a string consisting of 30 spaces, for in- stance, use SP$ = \"\":FOR /-I TO 30: SP$=SP$+CHR$(32): NEXT. This con- struction is easy to type and requires only a few more characters than printing the string in literal form. For similar reasons, it's often prefer- able to express graphic characters or un- usual symbols as CHR$ values rather than as string literals. Here are two differ- ent versions of a typical Commodore BASIC line: le IF X«>'a* THEN QOSUB 100 IB IF ««-CHR*<13S> THEN QOSUB 188 The first version of line 10 uses a literal graphics character to test whether the fl function key has been pressed. The second version performs the same ttst with CHR$. To alleviate the \"mysterious character\" problem, our listing conven- tions (see \"COMPUTE! 's Guide to Typing In Programs\" elsewhere in this issue) re- place any unusual Commodore or Atari character with a sequence that's easier to read. Here's what the same line would look like in a COMPUTE! listing: 10 IF X5-\"[ Fl ]\" THEN GOSUB 100 That's an improvement over listing an indecipherable graphics symbol, but it still requires that you remember the list- ing convention or look it up when the time comes. Of these three alternatives, the line with CHR$ is preferred in many cases, since it's easy to read and type, and doesn't require reference to anything but the listing. Of course, where large num- bers of characters are involved, CHR$ may not be practical. Spaced Out Operators I enjoyed Bill Boegelein's \"Amiga Puz- zle\" article in the May 1986 issue of COMPUTE!. I did have one problem, however, that may be of interest to your readers. The mistake was mine, not yours or the author's, but the solution might help everyone type in programs more accurately. The Play subroutine of Amiga Puzzle contains a complex IF statement that begins like this: IF (moaseX>rat(x,y,0> AND ... I mistakenly entered that portion of the statement like this: IF (mou8eX,rat(K,y,0) AND ... Notice my inadvertent use of a period in place of the greater-than operator (>). Clearly, 1 forgot to hold down the SHIFT key when typing the > charac- ter. The problem arises because Amiga BASIC lets you include a period as part of a variable name. Instead of perform- ing the logical comparison triggered by >, BASIC saw mouseX.rat as the name of an array. Of course, there is no such array or variable in the program, so its value was set to zero, like all other uninitialized variables. As a result, this part of the IF test is always false and the program's CheckCheat routine can never be called. Although I was lucky enough to find this error without much searching, similar mistakes could be very difficult to detect in other situations. As a pre- cautionary measure, I suggest that pro- grammers always place a blank space on either side of a logical operator, as shown here: IF (mouseX > raf<j(,y,0) A^fD ... If the original line had been written in this way, my typing error would have been much easier to spot. More to the point, BASIC itself would have de- tected the mistake and signaled a syn- tax error immediately. Again, the problem was mine, not Mr. Boegelein's or yours. But it could easily be prevent- ed by follovtdng this simple rule. Jack Purdum Thanks for the suggestion. SpeedScrlpt File Resurrected? I recently experienced an odd thing when using SpeedScript on my Commo- dore 128 in 64 mode. After writing a document, I pressed the RESET switch to go back to 128 mode. Then I decided to go back to 64 mode to finish up the document. When I reloaded and ran SpeedScript, I saw the same document that was in memory before I reset the computer. Shouldn't the memory have been cleared during this process? Does this mean that my 128 running in 64 mode isn't fully compatible with a nor- mal 64? Chris Hicks To answer your last question first, this experience does not signal any sort of incompatibility. Your computer behaved exactly as a normal 64 with a RESET switch would under the same circum- stances. The 6i's reset routine does not erase or scramble everything in the com- puter's memory; that happens only when you turn the computer off and on again. (For more details, see \"64 RAM Report\" in the June 1986 installment of this column.) SpeedScript erases all of its text storage space when you first run the pro- gram, but not if you rerun it during the same session. When you run SpeedScript, it checks to see whether a special memory 10 COIWUTO Septemtjer 1986 THE Premier Word Processing Package -CREATIVE COMPUVNG \"PaperClip is easy to use. yet offers the advanced features of programs designed for the IBM PC.

If this flag is present, SpeedScript concludes that it was used previousl}/ in this session and sets up without erasing any text. Resetting the computer doesn't disturb either the memory area where text IS stored or the location that holds the flag. So when you reran SpeedScript, the text was still there. This feature of SpeedScript permits you to exit to BASIC if necessary, then reactivate the word processor without los- ing all of your work. As lorig as you don't load a different program or perform opera- tions that change the contents of BASIC program space (or the memory location where SpeedScript stores the flag), any previous text should remain intact. To play it safe, of course, you shouldn't exit to BASIC more often than necessary. Speed- Script permits you to view the disk direc- tory and send commands to the disk drive without leaving the program. 1541 Disk Drive Rattle I have seen a BASIC command that prevents the Commodore 1541 disk drive from knocking when protected software is loaded. Is there any way to prevent the knocking sound when you format a new disk? I am worried that too much knocking will force my drive out of alignment. Tom Smith While it's true that head-knocking isn't particularly good for the drive, there's no easy way to prevent it during the format process. The 15il drive is often called an \"intelligent\" peripheral because it con- tains its own microprocessor, free RAM, and operating system in ROM. The knock- ing sound heard when you format a disk is deliberate. It's caused by the format rou- tine itself which is permanently recorded in the drive's ROM. A Commodore 1541 disk contains 35 tracks, numbered 1-35. Track 35 is near- est the center hub, and track 1 is the outermost. The drive always begins for- matting with track 1 and proceeds inward, formatting one track at a time. To locate the read/write head accurately for the beginning of this process, the drive steps the head outward a total of 46 tracks. Since the drive is designed to access only 35 tracks in normal use, this maneuver is guaranteed to cause a read/write error regardless of the read/write head's initial position. The rattle is caused when the read/write head pounds against a me- chanical metal stopper. The stopper phys- ically prevents the head from moving past the outer edge of the disk. As you've seen, the command that prevents the head from knocking in other cases doesn't work when formatting. That method works by storing a smaller than usual number in location $6A in the drive's RAM. This location is a zero-page counter used to control how many times the drive should try to access a requested sector before giving up and signaling a read /write error. The reason this trick doesn't work is that the ROM formatting routine, the rel- evant portion of which begins at $FAC7 in ROM, pays no attention to what's in loca- tion S6A. After stepping the head out 46 tracks, the ROM routine does set up a counter(at location $0620), but that's used to keep track of the number of errors encountered after the head-knock takes place. It is possible to format a disk without rattling the head, but the alternatives are fairly involved and may be less reliable than the usual method. The first catch is that you need the ability to write a ma- chine language routine for the drive to execute, download that code into one of the drive's RAM buffers, then cause the drive's microprocessor to execute it in place of the ROM format routine. For those who are up to that chal- lenge, here's one possibility: If your drive is correctly aligned, then, rather than lo- cating the read/write head in the usual way, why not use a commercially format- ted disk for calibration? Mass-produced commercial disks such as the 1541 Test/ Demo disk are usually created on indus- trial equipment, not 1541 disk drives, and software companies have a strong incen- tive to keep such equipment in good align- ment. So any commercial disk that doesn't contain deliberately implanted errors should be very close to the standard. The idea is to insert the calibration disk, move the drive's'read/write head to track 1 by reading track 1, sector 0, leave the read/write head stationary at that point, perform the other setup tasks re- quired, then enter the ROM format rou- tine at a point that bypasses the head- knocking section. That's a fairly tall order for most programmers and requires a much longer program than we can include in this space. This scheme could also in- crease the risk of inconsistent results, since it relies on two critical assump- tions— that your drive is correctly aligned and that the calibration disk was accu- rately formatted in the first place — which may not be true in every case. Loading Toucti Tabiet Screens In Atari BASIC How can I write a BASIC program to display pictures drawn with the Touch Tablet and Atari Artist cartridge? Peter Hinz Loading Touch Tablet pictures in Atari BASIC IS quite possible, and by calling an operating system routine, your BASIC program can load the images at machine language speed. But first, there are a few important points to cover. To begin with, the Atari Artist car- tridge that comes with the Touch Tablet saves pictures in a special compacted for- mat to conserve disk space. That's why, if you examine a disk directory of Atari Artist pictures, you'll notice that the files are usually of different lengths. Before you can load these pictures with a BASIC program, you have to convert them to uncompacted format. Although some people have written conversion utilities for this purpose, there's an even simpler method. It's not mentioned anywhere in the Atari Artist manual, but if you hold down SHIFT and press the greater-than key (>), Atari Art- ist saves the current screen onto disk with the filename PICTURE. (Be aware that this replaces any existing file named PIC- TURE on the disk.) The file PICTURE is uncompacted and always takes up 62 disk sectors. This trick is useful in a couple of ways. It makes it possible to load Atari Artist pictures into other drawing pro- grams for the Atari that use this format, including the Atari light Pen's Atari Graphics cartridge and Datasofi's Micro- painter. And it also makes it possible to load Atari Artist pictures into your own programs. But first, another point: Before load- ing the picture with a BASIC program, you have to set up the proper graphics mode. Atari Artist (and most other draw- ing programs for the Atari) uses a special mode often known as GRAPHICS TL. Of course, there's really no such thing as GRAPHICS 7% but the term refers to the fact that this mode has the same horizon- tal resolution as GRAPHICS 7 (160 pixels) and the same vertical resolution as GRAPHICS 8 (192 pixels, without a text window). Yet, it also offers the same num- ber of simultaneous screen colors as GRAPHICS 7 (four), while GRAPHICS 8 is limited to only two colors. Because it combines the best of both modes, GRAPH- ICS TVi has been the most popular mode for drawing programs. GRAPHICS 7% has always been sup- ported by the Atari operating system. However, until the XL and XE series com- puters came out, it was not available from Atari BASIC without making some special POKES to modify the display list. (The display list is an area of memory that tells the computer which graphics mode to dis- play on the screen.) On an XL or XE, GRAPHICS 7% is called GRAPHICS 35. The following BASIC program shows how to load a 62-sector screen file named PICTURE at machine language speed. It should work with any uncompacted screen files, including those created with Atari Artist, the Atari Light Pen, and Micropainter. This program is actually a slightly modified version of the program named MENU on the Atari COMPUTE! 12 COMPUTB September 19e6 COMPUTE! Books' /M/MW ^^ Collection COMPUTE!

A209 DISK. It's easily adapted to your own BASIC programs. Briefly, here's haw it works. Lines 10 and 160 create a very short machine language routine that is used later to call a high-speed loading routine in the operating system. Lines 170-177 set up graphics mode 7^h on any Atari com- puter. If your program is intended only for XL and XE models, you can replace these lines with a single statement such as 170 GRAPHICS 15+16. Line 190 opens the file PICTURE on disk and jumps to the subroutine at line 980. This subroutine, in turn, calls an operating system routine which loads the screen into memory at full speed. Line 200 simply loops endlessly so the picture stays on the screen. Press BREAK or SYSTEM RESET to end the program. nc 10 D K 160 CO 170 M 172 KS 175 BH 176 CH 177 11 190 FN 200 EC 900 EF 990 PL 1000 LN 1010 PI 1020 (I 1025 in cio»<7) ClD*-\"hhh\"iCID« R«(170) tCIO»(S} CI0»(7)-CHR»(22 SRAPHICS B+I61D (560) +25&«PEEK< SETCOLOR 4,0, 12 LOR 0,2,10:SETC ,2,6:SETC0LQR 2 POKE DL-1, 14+64 -2 TO 194l IF PE I)-15 THEN POKE 14 IF PEEKtDL+I)-l HEN POKE DL-M , 1 NEXT I OPEN #1,4,0, \"D: E\" I ADL=>PEEK (081 EEI<:(B9) :LN-7936 9B0:CLOSE ttl GOTO 200 X-l&:REri FilB»2 ICC0M='S34: ICBAD ICBLEN-e40: ICST POKE ICBflDR+X, KE ICBADR+X+1, L-LNlH-INT (L/2 L-H*25i!POKE I X.LlPOKE ICBLE H POKE ICCQH+X,?

You'll have to recreate the picture's original col- ors with four SETCOLOR statements in- serted somewhere between lines 170 and 190. You can figure out what these SET- COLOR statements should be by looking at the Color Menu screen in Atari Artist. The four color register numbers along the bottom of the Color Menu screen — 0, 1, 1, and 3 — correspond to the first parameter in the SETCOLOR statement. Color 0 = SETCOLDR 4, color 1 = SETCOLOR 0, color 2 = SETCOLOR 1, and color 3 = SETCOLOR 2. The second parameter in SETCOLOR matches the color numbers along the vertical color bar on the Color Menu screen (0 to 15). And the third parameter in SETCOLOR is derived from the vertical luminance bar on the Color Menu screen (also 0 to 15, but use the even numbers only). For example, if color 0 in Atari Artist is set to black, your program would need a statement such as SET- COWR 4,0,0. Incidentally, another undocumented trick makes it possible to load uncompacted-format pictures itito Atari Artist, too. Simply hold down SHIFT and press the less-than key (<). This way, you can take 62-sector pictures created with the Atari Light Pen, Micropainter, and other drawing programs and modify them with the Touch Tablet. If you then save this screen with Atari Artist in the usual way, it's converted to compacted format. Commodore SHIFT-SPACE Sometimes when typing in programs from your magazine on my 64, I've come across a SHIFT-SPACE. When I press SHIFT and the space bar, it doesn't appear any different on my screen from the normal space. What does the SHIFT-SPACE character do? Warren Frederick There is a difference between the normal space character and shifted space. Al- though they appear the same on your screen, they are actually two separate ASCII characters. The normal space is CHRS(32) while the shifted space is CHR$(160). This distinction is probably not significant in every Commodore pro- gram where a {SHIFT-SPACE} appears. Many times, the programmer happens to be working in lowercase and types in an entire message with SHIFT LOCK down. When this happens, a shifted space ap- pears in the listing, but an unshifted space would work just as well. However, sometimes SHIFT-SPACE serves a special purpose. Certain pro- grams use SHIFT-SPACE to mark a posi- tion on the screen that's invisible to the user. By PEEKing into screen memory, the program can distinguish between shifted and unshifted spaces even though both look identical on the screen. You can also use SHIFT-SPACE to add short comments to disk filenames. If you include a shifted space as part of the filename, the disk drive treats that char- acter as the end of the name and ignores any characters that come after it. But the extra characters are visible when you list the disk directory. For instance, you might want to save the current date to indicate when a program was last revised. This statement saves a program as FILE, fol- lowed by the date 9/22/86: SAVE \"FaE\"+CHR$(160) + \"/9/Z2/86\",8 After you execute this statement, you can still load the program normally, with LOAD \"FILE\",8. But when you list the directory, the filename appears as FILE/9/22/86. This trick is frequently used when saving machine language pro- grams, to indicate the SYS address used to start the program. Of course you are limit- ed to a total of 16 characters, just as with any other disk filename. IBM PrtSc Problems When using the PrtSc function with my PCjr in \"IBM Pie Chart Maker\" (COM- PUTE!, January 1985), my Gemini lOX prints the chart, but with thin blank lines between each row of the chart, as if the printer were displaying text lines. I have tried resetting the line space command to the printer and tested it in immediate mode to verify that the line space has been changed. But as soon as I type the PrtSc command, it seems that this command initializes the printer. Rich Camaish We've experienced the same problem when using PrtSc with anything except an Epson printer. Normally, pressing SHIFT-PrtSc just prints a text dump. In order to dump graphics with PrtSc, you need to enter the GRAPHICS command at the DOS command line to load the graph- ics print-screen driver. This driver was written specifically for the IBM Graphics Printer, a relabeled version of the Epson MX-80. Apparently, the driver resets the printer completely before starting the graphics dump, as if the printer were turned off and on. (The Epson code for this is ESC-@.) It then sets the lines-per-inch to 8, corresponding to seamless eight-wire graphics printing. The code used for this function is different on the Gemini lOX and many other printers that are other- wise Epson compatible. Your printer ac- cepts the reset sequence, though, throwing it back to nine lines per inch before start- ing the graphics dump. We've had the same problem with the IBM Color Printer. The only way around this would be to modify the GRAPHICS driver. If you know something about 8088 machine lan- guage and have a working acquaintance with the DEBUG utility, you could search for the ESC-(^ sequence (hex $1F $40) and replace it with two zeros to null it out. However, there are programs on the mar- ket and in the public domain that support graphics printing with PrtSc for many different printers. Check with your local IBM user group or nearest dealer to see if they've heard of these. Apple HTAB In 80 Columns I have an Apple He with an extended 80-column card.

TIME am BOOKS ■J UNDERSTANDING COMPUTERS The computer prints this line preceded by 19 spaces: THIS IS A TEST.A Memory location 36 is supposed to con- tain the horizontal cursor position, but in 80-coIumn mode, it always contains 0. The BASIC function POS(O) doesn't work either. How can I determine the current cursor position? William Liao Many older Apple U programs, especially those written in machine language, print to the screen by adding the horizontal cursor position (CH, location 36) to the address of the first character in the cur- rent row (BASL and BASH, locations 40 and 41), then storing a character at the address that results. When 80-column hardware is in use, this technique could scramble the Apple's memory, since the organization of 80-column screen memory is different. As a precaution, whenever the Ap- ple's 1/0 software accesses the 80-column screen to move the cursor or print, it resets CH to 0. This is why PEEmS) and POS(0) no longer work. In He and lie computers, the 80-column cursor position is kept in location 1403, called OURCH. (If you're familiar with the Apple II's memory arrangement, you'll remember that addresses between 1024 and 2047 are reserved for screen display memory. Since the 40-column screen is 40 X 24, that's a total of 960 bytes that are actually used. The 64 unused bytes are called screen holes and are used to store I/O variables. OURCH is one of these.) The HTAB command changes the cursor's position by storing a new value in location 36. To keep this command opera- tional, the enhanced I/O routines keep a copy of CH in another screen hole, loca- tion 1147 (OlDCH). Before each screen access, CH arid OLDCH are compared. If they are different, CH must have been changed, so its value is made the current position by storing it in OURCH. The only time this doesn't work is when 80-column mode IS active. Since CH and OLDCH are both set to zero at each screen access, an HTAB 1 command stores zero in CH, and there's no way to tell thai anything hap- pened. Since CH and OLDCH still contain the same value, OURCH is not altered. One simple way to move the current screen position to the first column is to use a lone PRINT statement. All it does is move the cursor to the first column of the next line without disturbing the display at all. Another way to be certain of the cursor's position in any display mode is to POKE the new column value (0-79) into both CH and OURCH, In standard dis- play mode (40 columns, checkerboard cur- sor), OURCH is not used; POKEing a value there doesn't seem to have any undesirable side effects. When the enhanced I/O firmware is active (block cursor in 40 or 80 columns), you can find the current cursor column with PEEK(1403). To find the current col- umn regardless of display mode, PEEK the value in CH. Then, if it has a value of zero, PEEK at 1403. This should always give the correct position. EduCalc Clarification A statement concerning disk ini- tialization in the review of Gro- lier's EduCalc spreadsheet (March 1986) requires clarification. When using an uninitialized data disk, the program will automatically ask if you wish to initialize the disk and then lead you through an initialization routine. When using a disk that's already initial- ized, EduCalc recognizes that and skips the routine.

ALL PRODUCTS WORK WITH ALL ATARI 3 BIT COHPUTEK M Promoting Computers In School Kathy Yakal, Assistant Features Editor Via free or discounted hardware and software, along with special teacher training, computer hardware manu~ facturers continue to promote their microcomputers in schools at every level. Here's an overview of recent ef- forts to increase the already impressive penetration of this technology into classrooms across the land. Microcomputers now play a signifi- cant role in many areas of educa- tion. But getting computers into the classroom and deciding how they are best used continue to be sub- jects of much debate. A combina- tion of factors has slowed the process even further: the problems of implementing a new, evolving technology; the chaotic atmosphere of the computer industry itself; the computer education of teachers and administrators; and the relatively 20 COMPUTEI September 1986 tight budgets of educational institu- tions. Nevertheless, tremendous changes have occurred in teachers' attitudes toward microcomputers over the last couple of years. There are several reasons. First, software publishers have increasingly at- tempted to provide the kind of pro- grams that teachers feel comfortable with — quantifiable, curriculum- based software. At the same time, innovative, nontraditional kinds of learning aids have gained a wider acceptance. Second, the hardware and software shakeouts that have moved the computer industry to- ward maturity and greater stability have made educators feel more confident about making a financial commitment to microcomputers. Finally, teachers are generally less anxious about computers and more experienced at applying them, with a growing number of classroom success stories fueling increased computer use. It's not just the stu- dents and a few computer-wise teachers who are driving the move- ment anymore. Each of the major computer manufacturers has made unique contributions to trigger the integra- tion of computers into classrooms. Some offer educational discounts. Others provide special grants and develop efficient ways to exploit the hardware, such as networking. In addition to easing the financial burden, hardware manufacturers promote the general health of the educational computing industry by fostering quality software develop- ment and encouraging nontradi- tional applications of hardware to traditional curricula. Inservice training of teachers and special workshops sponsored by hardware companies have also been signifi- cant in creating a more upbeat atti- tude toward classroom computing in recent years. Here's a company-by-company look at the variety of approaches, Apple Computer Officials at Apple Computer real- ized early on that a good software base was central to getting their hardware into schools. Apple made major efforts in the early 1980s to convince software developers to support its machines, offering them shared advertising, discounts on development machines, and tech- nical support. Currentiy, Apple has two edu- cational discount programs. Step pricnig gives buyers lower prices on larger orders, encouraging educa- tors to buy in quantity whenever possible. And with the Volume Pur- chase Agreement, a school can elect to pay for its computers over a three-year time period. If a school involved in such an agreement finds that the hardware does not meet its needs, it may return the equipment without making the re- maining payments. Support after the sale is also a key to Apple's success in the school market. Apple relies heavily on its local dealers to provide on-site sup- port to educators. Ten days before an order of computers is scheduled to reach a school, Apple notifies a local dealer who is then responsible for installing the equipment and providing orientation and training for teachers and administrators. The dealer is also responsible for any follow-up repair and maintenance. Apple has developed a fairly high profile on many college cam- puses across the country, thanks to the Apple University Consortium (AUC). A couple of years ago, 24 U.S. colleges and universities formed an organization whose pur- pose was to develop tools and re- sources for the Macintosh. Because of that, many campuses today main- tain busy Macintosh labs and work- stations. At least one institution, Drexel University, requires its fresh- men to purchase Macintoshes. Atari G>rporation Atari Corporation's change of own- ership and revamped management have resulted in few formal educa- tional programs currently in opera- tion. Considering Atari's growing strength, however, that may soon change. Low-cost 8-bit Ataris have already been the first kind of com- puter many students ever encoun- tered in a class; their current availability and strong software base may even amplify this trend. And the low price of the powerful ST computers, as well as their strong graphics and music capabili- ties, may cause some educators to look twice, especially for use in cre- ative applications. Atari recently announced a marketing agreement vnth Montreal- based Arrakis, publisher of the Ad- vantage series of educational soft- ware. ST versions of these programs, which have in the past been available for Apple, Commo- dore, and IBM, should be ready by the end of the year. The Arrakis series is known for its impressive graphics and cartoonlike anima- tion, as well as a sophisticated parser which incorporates princi- ples of artificial intelligence and provides direct answers to students' questions. Computer Curriculum Corpo- ration (Palo Alto, CA) has an- nounced a commitment to Atari equipment. CCC is packaging STs along with their minicomputers and a series of courses; that is, they bundle hardware and software and install the complete systems in schools. Finally, a 10-percent discount is available to colleges and univer- sities, with follow-up service and support provided by local dealers. Commodore Commodore's big draw for schools lies in its inexpensive hardware and broad base of third-party educa- tional software. Many teachers, un- able to get funds allocated for major hardware purchases, started out by buying a few Commodore 64s (or even bringing their own in from home). In many settings, this was all that was necessary to get stu- dents familiar with the fundamen- tals of microcomputers, while also providing workstations for word- processing, database management, and computer-aided learning. In other cases, some school adminis- trators have been willing to make a financial commitment to micro- computers in the classroom, based on the excitement they've seen gen- erated by a few hundred dollars' worth of hardware and software. Every major educational soft- ware publisher supports Commo- dore machines, so hundreds of titles have been developed for the Commodore 64 over the last few years. Though some are more ap- propriate for the less structured at- mosphere of the home, many have been adopted for classroom use. A complete list of the more than 1500 packages wiU be available through distributors this fall. Commodore has recognized that computer-aided education does not necessarily have to hap- pen in a schoolroom, and has sup- ported some unique opportunities for learning. Two of these involve telecommunications. Quantum- Link, a year-old service that Com- modore has backed with technical and marketing assistance, is an on- line forum for sharing information of all kinds. Though much of the earliest activity that went on there was computer-oriented, a variety of other special interests are now sup- ported there. Education is one of them. The Resource Center, a rela- tively new forum in the Learning Center area of Q-Link, is composed of three sections. The Library in- cludes curriculum guides, teaching strategies, software reviews, and ar- ticles about home and comnnunity education. In the Media Room, us- ers can download software written Each o{ the major computer manufacturers has made unique contributions to trigger the integration of computers into classrooms. by teachers. The Lounge is an on- line conference area, a meeting place for teachers and parents to gather and discuss educational is- sues and plans. And the Resource Center's Message Boards keep ev- eryone posted on what's happening in educational computing. (Quan- tum Computer Services, 8620 Westwood Center Dr., Vienna, VA 22180.) Commodore is involved with another online educational venture: the Electronic University Network, operated by TeleLearning Systems, Inc., of San Francisco. By purchas- ing the $195 enrollment package, you have access to online courses offered by 25 colleges and universi- ties. You may either take selected courses or, if you have met the school's prerequisites, work toward an M.B, A. or undergraduate degree. Degrees are issued by the schools involved, not by the Electronic Uni- versity Network, The system soft- ware also gives you access to online databases — libraries of information for research purposes — \"as well as counseling and online seminars. (Software allowing IBM and Apple owners to use the network is also available. For more information, write to TeleLearning Systems, Inc., 505 Beach St., San Francisco, CA 94133, or call (800)22LEARN; in California, call (800)44LEARN.) Commodore has, in the past, participated in more traditional out- reach efforts to schools. Recent fi- nancial problems at the company have apparently forced cutbacks in ongoing educational support. That, too, may change if Commodore is able to weather remaining financial hurdles. The company has a strong history of major support to Canadi- an schools, and continues to main- tain that presence. IBM IBM has made a major commitment to the basic skills of reading and writing with its Writing To Read program in the school market. De- veloped by educator Dr. John Hen- ry Martin, Writing To Read was tested among 22,000 students and was evaluated in an independent two-year study by the Educational Testing Service before being intro- duced in the fall of 1984. The pro- gram has grown in use from 200 schools at the end of 1984 to 1100 22 COMPUTE! Seplember 1986 Atari recently announced that 17 titles from the acclaimed Arrakis series will be available for the ST. schools at the end of 1985, More than 125,000 students have partici- pated in the program, The computer-based program allows students to advance at their own pace and offers positive reinforce- ment during a student's interaction with the computer. Through Writing To Read, children learn the 42 phonemes (let- ter and sound combinations) that make up the English language. Using these phonemes, students are able to read and write every- thing they can say. Typically, stu- dents spend an assigned hour each day in a Writing To Read center or lab, a specially designed room made up of five learning stations. Work sessions in the lab are gener- ally an hour long. Students alter- nate around the five stations: at the computer, with a work journal, at a listening library using specially The Tandy 1000 computer is be- coming an increasingly popular choice for educators. taped lessons, and playing two phoneme-based games at the \"make word\" station. IBM has made a significant com- mitment to developing curriculum- based software in many subject areas for elementary and secondary schools, programs that come bun- dled with several student disks and a teacher's guide for easy use in classrooms with multiple computer workstations. Many of the pro- grams are also available individual- ly. In addition, IBM has founded the National Disability Resource Center, a national technology re- source that supports the needs of the disabled.
