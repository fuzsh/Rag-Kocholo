Not just because it gave us Duran Duran and E.T., not even because of the Sony Walkman. It was because the 1980s saw the rise of the personal computer. With the help of hefty government discounts, computers inveigled their way into primary and secondary schools around the country – even if teachers didn’t always know what to do with them. Millions more computers appeared in living rooms and bedrooms around the country. For once, Britain was ahead of the world, helping to create a golden generation of British programmers. Sure, far more of us were destined to spend hours playing Elite and Chuckie Egg rather than creating games of our own, but the combination of C64s, Spectrum 48Ks, and BBC Micros directly led to the creation of a booming British software industry that continues to this day. The question that inspired this book, though, is how did these computers come to be? There was no cookie-cutter template to follow. Companies were genuinely making things up as they went along, often to brilliant effect. Every computer you read about here has a story that surprises, and it’s almost always down to the people involved. That’s why, as much as this book is a story about each computer’s creation, it’s also a story about the people that created them. Many of them British, many of them geniuses. With billions of pounds up for grabs in this nascent industry, not everyone was on their best behaviour. Ego battled ego in a quest for fame and wealth, leading to betrayals, lost fortunes, and too many shattered dreams to count. Think J.R. and Dallas, but with silicon instead of oil. And the fens of England rather than the sunbaked plains of Texas. This book tells the stories of 19 computers that each had an impact on Britain. I apologise if your favourite is missing – I would love to have covered Apricot’s machines, the NewBrain, the Oric-1, the Jupiter Ace, and the Cambridge Z88, for instance, but those will have to wait their turn. While I fully expect people to jump straight to the computers they owned, this book has been designed to be read in any order. You can choose to start your journey\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nin the late 1970s with the Commodore PET and end with the Acorn Archimedes in 1987; you can trace the stunning rise of Amstrad, which ultimately led to its swallowing Sinclair’s Spectrum business whole. It’s entirely up to you. My final note is on accuracy. These computers were built two generations ago, which has given rumours and half-truths plenty of time to gather respectability. Wherever possible, I have gone straight to the source: that means listening to oral histories, reading interviews, ploughing through historic documents, and referring to previously written books. But most of all I have, wherever possible, spoken to the people involved. The result is as close to ‘truth’ as I can get, and if that means slaying myths that have no root in reality then all the better. In fairness, these are stories that need no exaggeration to make them fascinating. I hope you enjoy reading them.

Those were the forces that drove two entrepreneurial Oxbridge graduates to create their first computer for schools. To trace the story of the Research Machines 380Z, we need to travel back in time to 1973. This was the embryonic age of computing, when companies were selling electronics in kit form. (An era, incidentally, that was reborn by the Raspberry Pi 40 years later.) It was a time when ambitious British entrepreneurs could hold a conversation in the pub about starting an electronics business without being ridiculed. As normal, though, there is no straight line between idea and finished product. Mike Fischer and Mike O’Regan started their first business together after building a brain wave analyser for rats. You did not read that incorrectly. ‘I was working as a contract electrician for a company called Roussel Laboratories, a drug company,’ says Fischer. ‘They wanted a special piece of scientific equipment built, and they knew I could do that sort of thing. So I got the contract to build it. It was a rat’s brain wave analyser.’ He laughs at the memory. ‘It was not a large market.’ With the rat money safely in the bank, the two Mikes decided to create a new company called Research Machines Limited. It was, on the face of it, a triumph of hope over reality: neither Mike had any business experience, with only £200 cash and a German typewriter between them (the pound sign achieved, O’Regan explains, by typing capital L, backspace, hyphen). O’Regan remembers Fischer saying, ‘There’s this company IBM, which stands for International Business Machines. It’s hugely successful. Maybe we can be the equivalent in the scientific market.’ This was also the reason behind the slightly archaic name Research Machines. However, much to Intel’s annoyance, they traded using the name Sintel; O’Regan recalls a threatening letter from Intel’s solicitors that accused Sintel of ‘passing off’ as Intel by instructing its staff to answer the phone, ‘Good morning, it’S intel.’ ‘Needless to say, that was not the case,’ says O’Regan, ‘and our tiny business was not even in the same market as theirs. I can’t remember if we replied or not, but anyway we didn’t hear any more from the solicitors, though it was a bit scary for us startup innocents to receive such a letter.’ The two companies could hardly have been any different. Where Intel was already a world-renowned chip maker, having created the revolutionary 4004 microprocessor\n\n10\n\nResearch Machines 380Z\n\nin 1971, Sintel started life as a mail-order business selling components via small ads in electronics magazines. Fischer’s enthusiasm for tinkering meant it wasn’t long before it was advertising project kits too; if you wanted to build your own digital clock back in the early 1970s, Sintel was the place to go. There was only so much money to be made from selling kits, and the pair wanted to build ‘something’ more substantial. When Fischer read about the new Zilog Z80 microprocessor, he realised that thing was a computer. ‘It was the 1st of April 1976,’ says Fischer, ‘which I remember because it was April Fool’s Day. We decided that we would have a go at making a computer based on the Z80.’ They had enough money in the bank to buy parts for 250 computers and, in a bold move, that’s exactly what they did. ‘We realised that microcomputers were going to become mainstream in the business world. And I thought that there was an opportunity to get in there before the big people, but that opportunity wouldn’t last,’ says Fischer, adding that he was realistic enough to know that the likes of DEC, HP, and IBM would soon trample on them – although in reality it took IBM five years to catch up. ‘Our plan was to go into that market for a few years and then go and do something else, something derivative.’ However, fate was to take a different turn when two advisors from the Berkshire County Council approached Sintel asking for advice on how to build a microcomputer for education. ‘We freely gave them lots of advice, and then suggested “Why don’t we build a computer and you see whether it’s appropriate?”.’ The two Mikes soon realised that education was a niche they could attack. ‘We thought we’ll survive a little bit longer if we specialise in one market and do some software for that market as well,’ recalls Fischer. ‘So for the first few years, we spent a lot of time at exhibitions explaining to people why we wouldn’t sell them a computer.’ First, though, they had a system to build. Time to start prototyping. Where Apple had a garage, Research Machines had Fischer and his wife’s bedroom. ‘Our bed was a double mattress on the floor, so we pushed the bed up against the wall during the day and pulled out the wallpaper trestle table.’ He then set to work assembling a working system using a wire wrap model: ‘It’s essentially a breadboard with billions of wires coming out of it. You could literally build what you wanted, debug it, and then get a circuit board printed.’\n\n11\n\nHaving settled on the core hardware, there was the small matter of writing the firmware to ensure the computer actually worked. This was beyond even Fischer, who drafted in David Small: neurology researcher at the University of Oxford by day, gifted programmer by night. In fact, Fischer describes Small as ‘the best programmer I’ve ever come across’. ‘I was like Steve Jobs to his Wozniak,’ adds Fischer. ‘I gave David a vision of what I wanted the BIOS to do and how to do it, and David went off and wrote it.’ This was only possible because Small had access to a PDP-8 minicomputer. ‘David found a piece of software on the PDP-8 that allows you to write machine code. But he couldn’t test it; to do that, he had to bring it to us. He wrote 4kB of machine code and it had about five bugs in it,’ recalls Fischer. ‘He was just a brilliant programmer.’ So brilliant, in fact, that the two Mikes gave Small a third share of the company (this later caused problems when they fell out over his role in the company, with Fischer and O’Regan eventually buying Small out). Fischer’s other University of Oxford links came in handy too, with a brilliant young Physics postgraduate called Bob Jarnot building an EPROM programming machine to burn the read-only memory onto the chips – a machine they couldn’t afford to buy. At the same time, their education momentum was building. Those two Berkshire Council advisors introduced them to other school IT advisors, who became Research Machines’ first major customers. In particular, Fischer flags the importance of Bill Tagg in Hertfordshire, who had been championing the importance of computers in schools since the 1960s; indeed, Maths pupils of Tagg at Hatfield School had access to an Elliot 803 since 1963 [1]. ‘Our second big breakthrough was a guy called Derek Esterson from the Inner London Education Authority. And those were the leading IT people in schools in Britain, in those days. And so the fact they bought from us meant that lots of other local authorities felt it was safe to buy from us.’ With a working prototype built, Research Machines Limited was ready to find buyers. The summer of 1977 would have found either Mike behind a stand in an exhibition, hoping to find a school or university willing to take the gamble. And they did. ‘We sold one to a lovely, trusting young man from Bournville College. He bought our first one, which we delivered on time in September 1977,’ says Fischer.\n\n12\n\nResearch Machines 380Z\n\nThe other thing Fischer could sell was a vision. ‘I understood the key things when microprocessors arrived, which is that they were only ever going to get better because of Moore’s law.’ This law dates back to 1965, when Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that the number of components (and transistors in particular) on integrated circuits would continue to double each year for the next decade. Fischer seized on this idea to help guide his development process. ‘I understood that when you design something that you wanted to have a several-year product life, and particularly a computer, you should take into account the fact that DRAMs would get cheaper and bigger, and everything would get cheaper, so expandability was a key issue.’ This foresight is one of the main reasons why the 380Z had such longevity: Fischer chose expensive components from the start, on the basis that they were costly now but would be ‘exactly the right thing two years later. So although we shipped the first one in 1977, even in 1979 we had a machine which was more or less optimal for the market. We had a graphics card, we had disk drives, we had a large amount of memory, and we had 80 characters.’ Reviewers were also fans of the Research Machines 380Z, with Mike Dennis describing the boards as a ‘work of art’ in his review of the computer in the very first issue of legendary computer magazine Personal Computer World [2]. While not without criticisms – he describes the ‘general standard of construction’ as ‘more adequate than elegant’ – his upbeat verdict ended by saying the ‘monitor ROM and software backup are excellent’. But it was expensive: if you chose the fully loaded 380Z with 32kB of memory and a floppy disk drive, then you would pay £1,787 (plus 8% VAT). A more basic system with 16kB of RAM and the keyboard still cost £965, which translates to around £6,000 in 2020. No wonder that Dennis suggested those on a budget should buy the 280Z for £400: this version simply consisted of the CPU board and VDU board, ‘fully built and tested’. However, it only included 4kB of RAM and a 1kB ROM. By late 1977, the two Mikes had honed their sales pitch, as is clear from adverts of the time. Pitched as ‘the tool for research and education’, and with universities firmly in its sights, the advert promised: ‘Having your own 380Z means an end to fighting the central operating system, immediate feedback of program bugs, no queueing, and a virtually unlimited computing budget.’ [3]\n\n13\n\nThe two Mikes also wanted to lure schools and colleges, promising that a 380Z ‘is ideal for teaching BASIC and Cesil [the Computer Education in Schools Language created by ICL]. For A Level machine language instruction, the 380Z has the best software panel of any computer.’ A bold claim, but the company didn’t stop there. ‘This enables a teacher to single-step through programs and observe the effects on registers and memory, using a single keystroke.’ The ‘integral VDU’ was another big selling point, along with the fact that it could display graphics alongside both upperand lower-case characters. The adverts also worked hard to convince readers that the 380Z would deliver a real return on investment: ‘Microcomputers are extremely good value,’ they began. ‘The outright purchase price of a 380Z installation… is about the same as the annual maintenance cost of a typical laboratory minicomputer. It is worth thinking about!’ While the ads were shouting about immediate benefits, Fischer had a long-term vision for the computer in education. ‘People had the magic view that microcomputers would be magic for education, but I could do the math. I could see that there was no way, for a long, long time, that there will be enough computer access and tools to use them in the curriculum.’ Instead, Fischer wanted to give children access to the tools that they would one day use in their jobs. In subsequent products from RM (as the company was later known), that would lead to Fischer negotiating a deal directly with Microsoft’s Scott Oki, then in charge of the company’s international operations, to bundle MS-DOS and Microsoft’s early word processor and spreadsheet applications with RM’s computers for ‘nearly nothing’. In return, Fischer’s argument went, Microsoft would have a strategic advantage: as each new generation of workers entered the workplace, it was Microsoft’s software they would want to use. It’s an argument that continues to hold force even now, although Google is doing its best to disrupt it with Google Docs. Even at the launch of the 380Z, Fischer was determined to think about the whole package rather than just providing hardware. ‘We went to great lengths to give what was a fairly unique thing at the time called the software front panel, which allowed you to single-step in a beautiful way through machine code and really understand how the computer was going.’ Another early advantage for RM is that it produced a cheaper, network workstation version of the 380Z, called the 480Z. ‘In schools, there’s no way that they\n\n14\n\nResearch Machines 380Z\n\ncould afford ten computers, each with disk drives,’ says Fischer. ‘So we had designed an Ethernet-like network, but using the Zilog communications chip. It was like a one megabit per second Ethernet. And we got that into schools.’ As a result, a secondary school could afford a 380Z with disk drives, and then share those resources around a class via a series of 480Z workstations. Despite the fact the first 380Z shipped in 1977, it was still a regular sight in British schools throughout the 1980s. Indeed, only RM and Acorn were officially sanctioned for use in schools for many years – which brings us to the thorny topic of the BBC Micro. ‘We were approached by the BBC to bid for their concept of a BBC computer,’ reveals Fischer, ‘but we felt the timescales and price they had in mind weren’t achievable.’ As is well documented, that contract was eventually won by Acorn for its BBC Micro – see its full story, starting on page 92 – and that caused big problems for RM. ‘It could have bankrupted us,’ says Fischer, so it’s little wonder that he resented competing with the BBC name at the time. However, he was full of admiration for what Acorn achieved. ‘The guys at Acorn did some pretty neat work with what was a very early gate array chip, to keep the chip count down. They deserved the success they had for a while.’ Although the majority of 380Z sales went to education, O’Regan points out that significant sales also went to commercial customers. ‘The 50th 380Z was sold to IBM itself,’ he says, ‘with a front-page article in Computer Weekly coyly referring to the customer as “a leading multinational mainframe manufacturer”.’ Another early adopter was British Aerospace and, later, sales of over a hundred each went to the GPO (the Post Office as was) and to the Department of Education itself. And it’s in the education sector where the Research Machines name lives on. Following the 380Z range, RM produced a series of personal computers in 1985, badged the RM Nimbus, with Microsoft Windows and networking optimisation being key differentiators from Acorn’s offering. For many years, RM maintained a market share of over 30% in schools (both primary and secondary). Indeed, the company that the two Mikes founded back in 1973 continues to flourish in the education sector and is the only British computer ‘manufacturer’ that still exists – even if it stopped making hardware several years ago, instead focusing on the software and services side of the market.\n\n15\n\nIf you were to count the number of British schoolchildren that had touched Research Machines hardware, and continue to use its services, over the course of the past four decades, it would be well into the tens of millions. That, as a legacy, is hard to argue with.\n\nWhat came next The RM 380Z is unusual in that it doesn’t have a list of direct descendants. The RM 280Z was actually launched at the same time, while the RM Link 480Z was designed to be an accompanying system.\n\nRM 280Z Release 1977\n\nPrice £400\n\nIn the late 1970s computers tended to be self-assembled, which is why Research Machines felt comfortable to release a version that consisted of the CPU board and video board on their own. Buyers would then assemble the rest of the components, from RAM to keyboard.\n\nRM 480Z Release 1982\n\nPrice from around £480\n\nWhile the RM 480Z could be used on its own – it included a 4MHz Z80A processor and up to 256kB of memory – its full name of Link 480Z gives away RM’s intentions. Thanks to its networking technology, a bunch of cheaper RM 480Z computers could access the disk space on a linked 380Z and effectively turn it into a file server. Perfect for classrooms and shared work.\n\nSources Interviews with Mike Fischer and Mike O’Regan. 1.

With a million pounds at stake, you have ten seconds to name the ‘father of personal computing’. Who do you reach for? Steve Wozniak? Steve Jobs? Bill Gates? Jack Tramiel? Whoever you decide upon, chances are that you don’t say Chuck Peddle. By the end of the story behind the Commodore PET, you may well change your mind. One thing is impossible to contest: Peddle was a genius. But like many geniuses, he often found it difficult to persuade those in authority to see things his way. Nor was he the most diplomatic of men, on one occasion ripping off the arm of a chair in his determination to make a demo happen as he intended. If he had written a CV detailing his 1970s career, it would be full of high-ranking positions at three of the biggest tech companies – Apple, Commodore, Motorola – but marked by short or interrupted tenures at each. Fortunately for the development of computing, that combination of brain power, passion, and visionary thinking led directly to the creation of the Commodore PET. And with it, the first mainstream microcomputer. Had history followed a smoother course, that computer would have been built by Motorola. Peddle joined the company in 1973, hired to help develop the 6800 microprocessor. In particular, together with engineer Bill Mensch he created the crucial input/output interface that turned the 6800 into something genuinely useful. Peddle then became the 6800’s key salesman, demoing and selling it to HewlettPackard, Ford Motor Company, and Remington among many others. He kept on hitting a hurdle during those demos: value for money. While the companies loved the 6800 and the capabilities it provided, they weren’t so fond of its $300 price. Peddle listened to the complaints and started to work on a low-cost version of the 6800, but this move was not greeted with wild enthusiasm by his employers: ‘I got a formal letter [from Motorola] saying you have to stop work on your low-cost microprocessor,’ Peddle told the Computer History Museum in 2014 [1]. Rather than meekly turn the other cheek, Peddle responded with fire. ‘I wrote a letter back to Motorola and said, that’s called project abandonment. So all of the work I’ve done up until now belongs to me, and I will not do any more development work for you… I’m going to go do it for myself.’ Peddle stayed on at Motorola, spending his time teaching companies how to use the 6800 while simultaneously hunting out funding for his pet project. One chance\n\n20\n\nCommodore PET 2001\n\nmeeting later and he found himself visiting a small semiconductor manufacturer based in rural Pennsylvania: MOS Technology. At that point, MOS made its living by designing and fabricating calculator chips, but its president John Paivinen needed little persuasion that microprocessors were the future. He invited Peddle to set up his own team within MOS. Peddle resigned from Motorola, and brought some of the key engineers from the 6800 team with him – including Bill Mensch. To say Motorola was displeased is an understatement, and it would soon launch a lawsuit against Peddle and his band of CPU refugees. Just to add a bit more spice, MOS called its two new processors the 6501 and 6502, with the 6501 being a drop-in replacement for the 6800. It’s important to note that Peddle claimed the processors took no DNA from the 6800. He instructed everyone not to take any paperwork with them when they left Motorola; this chip would be effectively designed from scratch (unfortunately, one engineer would disobey this instruction and give added weight to the Motorola lawyers’ later arguments). If anything, Peddle said, the 6502 owes more to the processor architecture of the highly successful PDP-11 minicomputer. While some people called the 6502 a RISC (reduced instruction set computer), Peddle always disputed this description. ‘It wasn’t. It was a reduced instruction set machine before that became a popular term at Stanford.’ Instead, Peddle saw it as a ‘universal solvent’. ‘It’s just enough, and it’s simple enough, and it’s cheap enough that you can use it for anything.’ Crucially, it was also fast. While the 6502 lacked some of the Intel 8080’s advanced features – for example, it didn’t support 16-bit operations – it could complete tasks just as quickly due in part to pipelining (where the chip could accept new data even while it was processing existing data). By June 1975 the 6502’s design was complete, manufacturing obstacles overcome, and MOS Technology unveiled the new microprocessor to the world at Wescon 75. Short for the Western Electronic Show and Convention, this was a huge deal in the nascent computing industry, and MOS Technology’s 6502 the stand-out product. With the show organisers banning sales on the show floor, attendees interested in buying the new chip – on sale for a paradigm-shifting $25 – needed to visit a suite in a nearby hotel. It was packed. Among the many visitors to MOS Technology’s hotel suite were two young men going by the names of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, both of whom took home a\n\n21\n\nprocessor and set of manuals. Peddle believed these were a big influence on Woz when designing the Apple I, although even Wozniak’s genius wasn’t enough to solve all the teething problems – Peddle later visited the famous garage where Apple was then based to troubleshoot some design issues. While the 6502 proved a big hit at Wescon 75, the surprise package in terms of MOS Technology’s finances was the KIM-1. This single-board computer included a calculator-style keyboard and six seven-segment LEDs for output. While it looks more like a calculator than a computer, its low price of $245 proved hugely attractive to hobbyists and development teams. MOS Technology reputedly sold over seven thousand units, adding a useful revenue line to the company. The money was especially useful because MOS Technology had two fights on its hands: the lawsuit from Motorola and dropping calculator revenue due to arch-rival Texas Instruments slashing its chip prices. In early 1976, the company’s financial backer – Allen-Bradley – cut its ties, and effectively handed ownership back to the three original founders of MOS. While they knew they had a hit on their hands with the 6502, they now faced a big problem: without financial backing, they couldn’t invest the huge amount of upfront cash required for a semiconductor company. Jack Tramiel, Commodore’s ferocious leader, sniffed an opportunity. He owed MOS Technology money for the calculator chips it had already supplied, and while that traditionally might sound like a problem, he saw it as an opportunity: it gave him leverage. What’s more, buying a chipmaker fitted in perfectly with his strategy of vertical integration. One that had been forged, in part at least, by Texas Instruments squeezing his supply of chips as it entered the calculator market itself. According to Tramiel, speaking at an event to mark the 25th anniversary of the Commodore 64 [2], he put in a call to MOS president John Paivinen. ‘I called him, we met, they were in very bad financial shape, they were losing $120,000 a month and they needed help, and I decided to buy this company and turn it over to become strictly a Commodore supplier.’ What he didn’t appreciate at this point was that MOS Technology was sitting on a potential goldmine. During that same event, Tramiel describes MOS as being more interested in solving engineering problems than making money, with the result that it had ‘a hundred or two hundred jobs from different companies to develop products’.\n\n22\n\nCommodore PET 2001\n\nTo determine which products were worth investing in, he asked people to come into his office every half hour to explain what they were doing. ‘Almost the last one to come in was Chuck Peddle, and he showed me a product called the KIM,’ said Tramiel. ‘The KIM was a board, a PC board; if you attach the keyboard to the television then it was actually a computer. And he told me his idea to integrate these three pieces into one box and it could be a computer.’ Rather than dismiss the idea, Tramiel asked his technology-savvy son Leonard – then a postgraduate at New York’s Colombia University – to head to Pennsylvania and meet Peddle to suss out whether he was a man worth listening to. ‘That was one of the stranger conversations I’ve ever had,’ says Leonard Tramiel. ‘I expected to have a technical discussion about microprocessors, and how he wanted to construct this thing and what the features would be. ‘Instead we spoke for at least two-thirds of the discussion about a Robert Heinlein short story called The Door Into Summer, which was about a future society that was just littered with embedded microcomputers. That was the society that Chuck wanted to live in. And in order for people to be comfortable with such a society, he knew that personal computers would be necessary. And to do that, we would have to have very inexpensive, yet powerful microprocessors. So he had done the first step, which was to develop the 6502. And the next step was to make a personal computer.’ Leonard duly reported back to his father that Chuck Peddle wasn’t crazy. ‘He said how fantastic [the 6502] is,’ said Jack Tramiel, ‘so I gave Mr Peddle six months to come up with a prototype. If he does, he can stay on; if not, goodbye. And six months later, we went to a Chicago winter electronic fair, and we showed the product – it was an unbelievable success.’ That rather simplifies the development process. At one point, Jack Tramiel and Steve Jobs met to discuss the prospect of Commodore buying the young company and using its forthcoming Apple II system as the basis of the new computer’s design, but the two men couldn’t agree a price. Even if the deal had gone through, it’s impossible to imagine Jobs working for such a strong personality as Jack Tramiel. So Peddle and a small team of engineers set to work on their own prototype, guided by a specification from Radio Shack. The then-dominant American electronics retailer was keen to sell a fully built computer, and it wanted it to be so simple that franchisees could sell it without needing to offer support. They were looking for\n\n23\n\nsomething ‘turnkey’, to borrow a phrase from Chuck Peddle. ‘And so they published a spec that says we want a built-in CRT, we want a tape drive built in, we want people to be able to load the programs, and we want them to be able to run.’ Peddle’s ambitions went far beyond what Radio Shack was thinking. For starters, he was determined to include BASIC so that people could sit down and start programming themselves; he knew there was a pent-up demand from people who were interested in coding, but less interested in building their own computers with welding irons and do-it-yourself kits. By this point, Microsoft (or Micro-Soft as it was then known) was already the big name in BASIC, having convinced Altair to distribute and market their version of the language in the Altair 8800 microcomputer (see ‘The computers that came before’, page 35). That’s why Peddle dropped by Microsoft’s early offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and requested a version of BASIC for the Commodore. In particular, Peddle wanted support for the IEEE 488 interface. Forty years later and it’s hard to get excited by IEEE 488, but it allowed users to hook up peripherals such as printers, disk drives, tape drives, and scientific equipment. Until the PET, it was only found on HP minicomputers costing $5,000 and more, and it gave the computer what Peddle describes as ‘dignity’. ‘We’re going to be selling this thing for $500, and everybody else thinks computers are $20,000 and it’s got to have dignity,’ Peddle told the Computer History Museum. ‘So putting the IEEE 488 in gave me dignity, and also gave me a guaranteed market of people that would buy it… because I would be able to sell it against HP and Tektronix and everybody that were selling them for thousands of dollars.’ Bill Gates set to work on the BASIC without agreeing a price, which was always a mistake when dealing with Jack Tramiel. As the Microsoft founder discovered a few months later. ‘[Gates] came to see me and tried to sell me the BASIC, and he told me that I don’t have to give him any money, I only need to give him $3 per unit,’ said Tramiel in 2007. ‘I told him that the highest price I’m willing to pay is $25,000 [as a lump sum], and about six weeks later he came and took the $25,000. And since then, he doesn’t want to speak to me.’ Kit Spencer, then in charge of Commodore’s marketing in the UK, remembers the night the deal was signed, and describes it as not only a great deal for Commodore – ‘we got an operating system that we put on 20 million computers and it didn’t\n\n24\n\nCommodore PET 2001\n\ncost us anything in reality’ – but a crucial lesson for Bill Gates and Microsoft. With his fingers thoroughly burnt, Gates would later turn round to IBM and insist, in Spencer’s words, ‘you can have it for a tiny royalty and I’ll keep it up to date for you. And he kept the rights to it. And that is the history of Microsoft.’ With the key software commissioned, Peddle and his team set to work on the hardware. Rather than start from scratch, they opted for a design not dissimilar to the KIM-1, already created for a computerised sprinkler control system. This isn’t quite as bizarre as it seems. The system had been developed by Petr Sehnal, a colleague of Peddle’s from MOS Technology, and Peddle remembers it as a ‘little general-purpose thing that was designed for that kind of application’ [3]. One big challenge was integrating the IEEE 488 slot, a responsibility that fell on the shoulders of Bill Seiler, one of Peddle’s most trusted and gifted engineers. ‘We figured out a way to implement it cheaply all in software as much as we could,’ said Peddle in Brian Bagnall’s Commodore: A Company on the Edge. ‘The devices have to respond in a certain amount of time, so it created a little bit of a headache for us. We kind of blew it a little bit because it needed some hardware assist, but we didn’t do that.’ To turn ideas into a working prototype, Seiler relied on Nobuo Aoji, a Japanese engineer who Tramiel had flown over to California from Japan. Seiler describes Aoji as ‘like a Tasmanian devil in the lab’ [4], able to translate one of his schematics into a working breadboard prototype within an hour. Peddle asked Larry Hittle, who had made the KIM-1, to design the PET’s case. Hittle went on to make two wooden prototype cases with smooth, rounded edges that hinted towards a futuristic machine. This wasn’t a totally original concept, with similarly rounded Courier terminals already in existence – and including both a builtin CRT monitor and a keyboard. While it was a stylish design, it never made the final cut as Tramiel couldn’t afford to mass-produce the PET with such curves. Instead, and here’s where Commodore’s vertical integration made its presence felt once more, he instructed his filing cabinet factory in Toronto to use metal to create something that looked like the prototype. This was an acceptable compromise, but Peddle conceded one other major design decision to Tramiel: the keyboard. ‘We’re showing him a typewriter keyboard because we say all computers need a typewriter keyboard, because we had all grown\n\n25\n\nup with them like that,’ Peddle told the Computer History Museum in 2014. Tramiel wasn’t convinced and asked for evidence that this is what people wanted. Especially when Commodore was already making calculator keyboards. Peddle conceded the point, and the decision was made. The final key component was a monitor, and once again the combined pressure of a tight deadline and an equally tight focus on costs meant a small, cheap model was the only option. Peddle despatched a young employee to a local electronics store to find such a screen, and he returned with a cheap, black and white TV. It was then a matter of taking it apart and making it work. With none of his team having experience with CRTs, they used a how-to guide to try to connect everything as it should. Which they did, except for one thing: when they switched it on, the screen image was upside down. It was this final technical challenge that kept Peddle awake at a freezing CES Chicago in January 1977. With temperatures dropping below -20°C, and an ice fog across the lake, Peddle spent a final night ‘trying to get things running to meet with Radio Shack’. Their contact was John Roach, who would go on to usher Radio Shack into the computer age. ‘John Roach comes up, and we show him this machine, sort of working. I mean, I think we got the CRT right side up just in time,’ said Peddle. ‘And he and Tramiel had a discussion. Tramiel says I’ll finish this for you, but in order to do that, you’re going to carry my full calculator line.’ Roach, who could see the fate of calculators better than Tramiel at that time, said no. ‘So Tramiel said OK, well then you can’t have my computer.’ While Roach’s team went on to design the popular Tandy Radio Shack TRS‑80 (the 80 refers to the fact it was based on a Zilog Z80 processor), Tramiel was sufficiently convinced that Commodore should invest in Peddle’s microcomputer. It helped that, following a leak of the computer’s design to Electronic Engineering Times, the company’s stock rose from $4.50 to $7. From not being sure whether Peddle had a place in his company, Tramiel was now keen to motivate his chief engineer to even greater heights – promising him $1 for every computer sold. Now the pace quickened. In March 1977, Commodore unveiled the world’s first personal computer at the Hanover Fair. It would include 4kB of programmable memory, BASIC, a keyboard, a monitor, and a cassette drive for $495. By comparison,\n\n26\n\nCommodore PET 2001\n\nApple was soon advertising the Apple II – also based on the 6502 and with 4kB of RAM – for $1,298, and that was without a screen. While the PET didn’t generate many column inches at the time, there were already signs that it could be big. ‘We had the first prototype on the stand next to Wang,’ says Kit Spencer. ‘On the first day, some of their sales guys came to look at it. Then the second day the general manager of Wang comes up. By about the fourth day of the show, the assistant to the president of Wang came to look at it.’ For Jack Tramiel, the buzz created by the prototype PET was enough to make him take action. ‘A little while later, he said to me, I think this is the future,’ says Spencer. ‘This is the future of the company. He said, Kit, can you start a new division because I just want to find out what we can really do. We talked about the possibilities: could this replace typewriters, could it do this, that and the other. We knew there was incredible potential, but nobody knew what it could do.’ American buyers who wanted to see the PET for themselves had to wait until the West Coast Computer Faire in April 1977. This new show had been launched specifically with home computing in mind, with two-page adverts in Byte magazine that promised ‘100 Conference Presentations’, ‘200 Commercial & Homebrew Exhibits’, and ‘Two Banquets with Outstanding Speakers’ [5]. An estimated 13,000 people headed to the Civic Auditorium in downtown San Francisco, with Peddle describing the atmosphere as ‘a lot like Woodstock’ [6], with the usual suited computer conference attendee replaced by people in jeans. ‘These were the guys with the thick glasses and the slide rules in their pocket. This was their thing.’ With the PET wrapped in its futuristic casing, and including everything a microcomputer user could wish for in one package, it stood out from the collection of boards seen elsewhere on the show floor. However, a note of caution: judging from Byte’s coverage of the show [7], where it didn’t mention the PET at all, we would be rewriting history to suggest that it was a colossal hit. It’s telling that the PET didn’t even draw much attention at the summer edition of CES; in many ways, Commodore was ahead of the market. Computer dealers were comfortable selling machines with four-figure and five-figure price tags, and there was no proof yet that the PET would be any more successful than the hobbyist board systems that had gone before. Commodore had just one significant customer: a man who sold used computers in the Midwest, and who was so convinced by the\n\n27\n\nPET that he handed Peddle a cheque for $25,000. Once Commodore had shipped him that many computers, he said, he would send another cheque. This was a sign of things to come. At the National Computer Conference in Dallas, Peddle was finally able to demonstrate a collection of working PETs rather than cobbled-together prototypes, and the response was overwhelming. With Tramiel having commanded Peddle to accept pre-orders – Commodore desperately needed the money to kick-start production – Peddle and his wife spent the next three days accepting cheques from ordinary punters desperate to receive their PETs. This was despite orders being limited to 8kB machines at $795. ‘I walked upstairs almost at the end of the show to see what was going on with the big computer guys,’ said Peddle [8]. ‘There wasn’t anybody on the floors up there. Everybody had left the floors and were downstairs buying computers. It was the end of the big computer time… we had absolutely wiped them out.’ By autumn 1977, momentum had swung almost entirely in Commodore’s favour. US magazine Personal Computing put the PET on the cover of its September/ October issue, asking ‘Is it the first of a new generation?’ In a ten-page article that featured an extended interview with Chuck Peddle [9], he made many claims that have stood the test of the time – and others that haven’t. For instance, it took some time for his prediction of the computer’s role in the average person’s planning finances to come true: ‘He has his computer to do his planning; he approves the plan in his home, and transfers a cassette to the bank, letting the bank automatically do the paying.’ Peddle also predicted the role of computers in education. ‘Many of the schools will now be able to teach children at ages 7, 8, and 9 the fundamentals of programming and the fundamentals of using a computer… It will actually teach lessons, allowing children in the schools to proceed at their own rate.’ His hope that the whole nation would become programmers, able to whip up personalised programs to fit a purpose, proved less visionary. As demand rose, Commodore struggled to keep up. With chairman and purse holder Irving Gould unwilling to gamble money on a huge production facility, the company made do with a rented factory where labourers painstakingly assembled the machines at desks. The first PETs were shipped in October, but even towards the end of the year they were making around 30 machines per day, with an estimated total of 500 by the end of 1977.\n\n28\n\nCommodore PET 2001\n\nPeddle told the story of one lady who begged him to give her a PET early. ‘She says, you’ve got to do this. We have one computer at home. There’s four of us using it. We drew to see the time that we get to use the computer, and I’m the housewife, but my time is from 2 o’clock in the morning until 6 o’clock.’ Those lucky enough to receive the first batch of PETs weren’t really so lucky. For example, early customers complained about the keyboard because the letters wore off and it was difficult to type on. Meanwhile, the TRS-80 was gaining momentum and Apple was catching up. Not only did the Apple II offer colour, but Wozniak had created a disk drive. Peddle was dismissive of Apple’s single drive approach, wanting to engineer a dual drive which he felt was more professional, as it would allow people to save work to the second disk. However, it would take him months to do so. Then there were distribution issues. While Radio Shack had a network of stores, Commodore could only rely on its much more limited Mr Calculator outlets, while Tramiel’s refusal to give ComputerLand a discount meant they decided not to stock any PETs. Instead, he looked to Europe. After dodging one immediate legal hurdle – Philips had the rights to the name PET, so Commodore rebranded it as the CBM 3000 series – he saw the opportunity to focus on profit. With only the less flexible Tandy TRS-80 as a rival, he set a high price of £695. This was equivalent to $1,295, so effectively British customers were being asked to pay almost twice as much as Americans were paying. To look at it another way, Brits were being asked to pay £4,000 when adjusted for inflation (the PET arrived on UK shores in early 1978). You might think this would irritate the man charged with building sales in the UK, especially as this encouraged a ‘grey market’ of PETs making their way from the USA through illicit channels, but Kit Spencer is philosophical. ‘It was an irritant, but it didn’t stop us getting the market going.’ It helped that Spencer had a clear vision. In particular, he saw the UK launch of a fully-fledged computer as a chance to do things differently: to create a longterm business, complete with a proper infrastructure and support for buyers. And to make the PET user-friendly. ‘I remember when we got the first half-dozen PETs, this complex product, they came over with no manuals or anything. So the first guy I hired, I said go home, go anywhere, just write me a manual. He managed to create a\n\n29\n\npretty crude manual, I think it was probably about 40 Xerox pages, and we put that in the first PET.’ Tramiel wasn’t impressed when he discovered this, saying that it was the US company’s job to produce the manual. ‘ “Why are you doing the manual?” he says,’ recalls Spencer. ‘I said, “Because we haven’t got one, Jack.” Jack says OK. The next day, I get a phone call from the US. “Jack tells me you’ve got a manual, can you send it please?”’ This was typical of Spencer’s relationship with Jack Tramiel. While other Commodorians often fell out of favour with the company’s passionate leader, Spencer had the advantage of being several thousand miles away – and also had results to back up his decisions. ‘Jack left us very much to get on with things, which was good, because you’re able to make plans without being micromanaged and really see what it could do. And I think we just maybe did make the right decisions – we certainly became the dominant computer in the UK and, in fact, virtually all of Europe.’ This freedom allowed Spencer to effectively create a rule book on how to launch a computer. ‘I realised we had a car, so we had to provide the driving lessons. In the UK, we were able to put in a lot of support operations fairly quickly. They weren’t big. I had someone doing the training division, I had somebody doing software. But I made them all profit centres, because Jack was always pretty hard on costs.’ Spencer also started, albeit in humble form, the first magazine built around a specific computer. ‘Even before we sold a Commodore computer we had a prototype, and I could see the interest in it, so I decided to start a Commodore newsletter. I think we charged something like £10.’ In return, Commodore UK promised, it would send you a monthly newsletter to keep you up to date. The British found useful allies in higher education too, with Strathclyde University buying a number of Commodore PETs, and then using them to write software that would prove popular with users. If anything, this pattern carries on strongly to this day, with Britain producing a huge amount of innovative software packages ever since. While this book focuses on the hardware, it’s crucial to understand how important software has always been – even in the late 1970s – when people are deciding which computer to buy. While Peddle may have had the notion of every computer user being a programmer, in reality that’s a tiny subset of the population: most people simply like to exploit the work produced by others, whether that’s accounting software, a word\n\n30\n\nCommodore PET 2001\n\nprocessor, or a game. One of the early drivers of PET sales was Microchess, which Commodore was demoing in shows as early as 1977. In 1978, estimates put UK sales of the Commodore PET at 30,000. It helped that Apple wasn’t yet established in the UK, and Commodore also didn’t have to fend off competition from the TRS-80. Instead, Spencer saw his role as developing the market. ‘Tandy and Sinclair came in eventually, but for the first year or two there was not a lot of competition per se. The competition was traditional computers and convincing people we were useful.’ Douglas Adams, author of The Hitch-Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, was one of the unconvinced. ‘I remember the first time I ever saw a personal computer,’ he would write in 1999 [10]. ‘It was at Lasky’s, on the Tottenham Court Road, and it was called a Commodore PET. It was quite a large pyramid shape, with a screen at the top about the size of a chocolate bar. I prowled around it for a while, fascinated. But it was no good. I couldn’t for the life of me see any way in which a computer could be of any use in the life or work of a writer.’ As the market evolved, so did the Commodore PET. In late 1978, Commodore released new versions with a typewriter-style keyboard, while jettisoning the built-in cassette drive (it sold a standalone unit for $95). It also released a trio of printers, built in partnership with Epson, that cost up to $795. What the PET still didn’t have, and Apple did, was a disk drive. This would ultimately lead to Chuck Peddle leaving the company. Tramiel was furious that Commodore had been outflanked by Apple releasing its drive first, at a price of $595, and while it was basic and slow, it worked. At that time, Commodore had nothing. Peddle had been working on a dual disk drive for several months but technical, staffing, and health problems had all combined to derail the project. Tramiel demoted Peddle and took him off the project. With Apple promising him riches if he switched sides, and Tramiel only punishment, Peddle took the difficult decision to leave. Peddle’s months at Apple weren’t happy ones, but his replacement soon discovered just how hard it was to create a floppy drive. When the chance arose for Peddle to rejoin Commodore in February 1979, he leapt at it. He brought the project back on track, and finally unveiled the 2040 dual drive at the June 1979 CES. It cost $1,295 and was more like a second computer than a peripheral, containing\n\n31\n\ntwo processors, its own operating system, and 4kB of memory. Crucially, though, it didn’t steal any precious computing power from the main computer, whereas Apple’s drive did. The Apple II had one glaring advantage over PET, however, and that was colour. While Commodore had continued to improve the PET during 1979, including a large-screened version with an 80-column display that was targeted at businesses, the PET’s mono approach was starting to look old-fashioned. What’s more, Apple had stolen a march thanks to the release of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet. Commodore needed to do something. If Chuck Peddle had won the argument, that something would have been the ColorPET: an out-and-out business machine costing well over a thousand dollars. To find out what actually happened, turn to the story of the VIC-20 (page 62).\n\nHow the PET got its name The Commodore PET may well not have happened at all if it wasn’t for Andre Sousan. At the time when Commodore bought MOS Technology, Sousan was VP of engineering – and a former colleague of Chuck Peddle at Texas Instruments. Where Peddle was brash, Frenchman Sousan was smooth and sophisticated. Peddle soon convinced him of the merits of a true microcomputer, and it was Sousan and Peddle in combination who persuaded Tramiel that an all-in-one unit, complete with monitor, was the right way to go. With Tramiel signed up, they now just needed to think of a name. ‘At that time there was a phenomenon called the Pet Rock,’ explains Michael Tomczyk, who would play an important role in the release of the VIC-20. ‘Somebody was selling rocks in a box and calling it the Pet Rock. It was a big fad.’ The word ‘pet’ appealed to Sousan due to its warm, fuzzy nature – exactly the characteristics they wanted people to associate with their new computer. Now they had an acronym, they just had to create words to match. While ‘personal’ and ‘electronic’ were easy, the letter T proved more problematic. ‘Chuck said he went home, he scanned through the dictionary and the next day he came back to Jack and he said we’re going to call it the personal electronic transactor. So that’s what the PET stands for and that’s how they got over a potential lawsuit from the Pet Rock people.’\n\n32\n\nCommodore PET 2001\n\nThe 2001 is less romantic. While 2001: A Space Odyssey was almost ten years old by the time the PET launched, it still epitomised the idea of space age futurism. And what could sound more futuristic than the Commodore PET 2001?\n\nThe computers that came before Note that we aren’t suggesting for a moment that the PET was the first computer. Colossus famously helped shorten the Second World War due to its code-breaking prowess, and throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s mainframe computers played an increasingly important role in business-critical applications. Mainframes needed rooms dedicated to their needs, but with the arrival of the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer in 1965 things started to change. While hardly cheap at $18,500 ($150,000 in today’s money, according to the US Inflation Calculator), its size and relative affordability helped it sell almost 50,000 units. With the PDP-11, released in 1970, things got even more serious: according to its entry on Wikipedia, DEC sold over 600,000 PDP-11 minicomputers across its 20-year lifespan. But the computer that predates the Commodore PET and has the strongest claim to be the first microcomputer is the Altair 8800. It used a 2MHz Intel 8080 processor and was initially only available in kit form: it was designed to appeal to hobbyists and electronics fans, not the general public. It was comparably cheap too, at $395. It was the Altair that inspired many computer pioneers into their trade: most notably, Microsoft wrote a version of BASIC for the computer that put them in business, and it was the subject of the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club (which spurred Steve Wozniak to create the Apple I). While it’s inevitable that personal computers would have taken off without the Altair – and note that it barely sold at all in the UK – it was the spark that lit up a whole industry.\n\nBeyond ASCII One of the PET’s most loved features was its extended character set. By pressing Shift followed by the ‘A’ key, you would bring up a spades icon from a deck of cards. And, naturally, programmers had access to all these special characters too, allowing them to generate graphically interesting games by using ‘normal’ characters. Commodore fans christened this character set PETSCII, which is derived\n\n33\n\nfrom ASCII – short for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. PETSCII (not that he approves of the name) was created by Leonard Tramiel, son of Jack, in the months before the PET’s release. His brief from Chuck Peddle? ‘It must play cards. There’s 256 symbols in an 8-bit character set. Basically 64 of them are fixed because of letters and numbers and punctuation and the like. He gave me the mandate that I must include hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs, so that he could play blackjack. And everything else was just open. Figure out what will work.’ To help him decide what to include, Tramiel had two images in his mind: the Starship Enterprise and the Apollo Lunar Module. ‘They were both in my mind fullscreen. So they were much larger than the Lunar Lander game, but by the time I was done designing the set, I had something that made a pretty darn good lunar lander. So I thought, “Oh, I can write a game around this.” And I did.’ Unlike Apple with the II, it was also possible to type in lower-case letters. Although, admittedly, not totally straightforward. First you had to invoke the relevant POKE command: ‘POKE 59468,14’. Even then, to get a lower-case letter you need to press Shift first. When you were done, you flipped back into graphics mode by typing ‘POKE 59468,12’. To have a play yourself, head to masswerk.at/pet.\n\nWhat came next PET 2001-N, PET 2001-B Release 1978\n\nPrice from £795\n\nAfter receiving endless complaints about the calculator-style keyboard of the original PET 2001, Commodore released two models with a full-size keyboard – and dropped the integrated cassette drive. The 2001-N included graphical PETSCII characters, while the business-focused 2001-B just had regular characters.\n\n34\n\nCommodore PET 2001\n\nPET 4000 series/CBM 8000 series Release 1980\n\nPrice from £1,295\n\nThe 4000 series’ key selling point was its larger screen, complete with support for 80-column text, but unlike the previous PET you couldn’t upgrade the RAM yourself: you had to choose 8kB (the 4008), 16kB (4016), or 32kB (4032) and live with it. While the CPU stayed the same, it ran faster due to improved circuitry and included an extended version of Commodore BASIC.\n\nSuperPET 9000 series/MicroMainframe Release 1981\n\nPrice from £2,000\n\nDesigned for university students, programmers, and scientists, the SP9000 included 96kB of RAM and – thanks to an RS-232 interface – the ability to send work back to a mainframe (perfect for students). The 48kB ROM also included a bumper collection of languages, including COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal.\n\nSources Interviews with Kit Spencer, Leonard Tramiel, and Michael Tomczyk. 1.

Two young men: one an engineer, one a natural-born salesman. And both called Steve. At that time, Steve Wozniak was a loyal employee of Hewlett-Packard with a deep love of tinkering with computers. Steve Jobs was a highly intelligent college dropout with a curious moral compass, despite his keen interest in spiritualism. For example, while working for Atari, Jobs told Wozniak that he would split the $700 fee for a board redesign challenge if Wozniak would do the work. Wozniak did such a phenomenal job that Atari paid a bonus of $5,000, but Jobs only gave his friend $350. Wozniak, universally called Woz, had been tinkering with electronics since he was a child. ‘A lot of things I did back then I’d probably be put in prison for a few years now,’ he said in a lecture at San Francisco’s Computer History Museum back in 2002 [1]. ‘One time I built a little electronic metronome and put it in a friend’s locker, and it was going “tick, tick, tick” and it had these big battery cells that kind of made it look like a bomb,’ he said. Unfortunately, it wasn’t his friend that found it but the school principal. ‘I had to laugh when the principal told me how he opened up the locker, clasped it to his chest, and ran out and dismantled it. But because I had rigged it with a resistor, when he opened the locker the ticking sped up.’ So possibly not quite as funny for the principal. More seriously, the young Woz spent much of his time at high school designing computers on paper, based on the chip technology available at the time. When a new chip appeared, he, for fun, would redesign his existing computers to take less space or use fewer chips. There could be no better rehearsal for a career designing real computers, and it’s no surprise that Woz joined the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club. This hugely influential group, which flamed to life between 1975 and 1976, both met in the San Francisco Bay Area and shared information via newsletters. One of which included Bill Gates’s famous ‘Open letter to hobbyists’, which lambasted enthusiasts for stealing Microsoft (Micro-Soft as it was then) BASIC software. [2] Inspired by those meetings, Woz was already sketching out a design for a computer that he felt would be superior to the MITS Altair 8800. In fact, he had put it into practice by placing a microprocessor and memory into a video terminal that he had previously made.\n\n38\n\nApple II\n\nWoz happily shared his schematics with other members of the Homebrew Computer Club for no fee, but where Steve Wozniak saw a chance to share knowledge, Steve Jobs saw an opportunity to make money. ‘Steve Jobs came along then and saw the interest in my design,’ said Wozniak in 2008 [3]. ‘And he said, why don’t we start a company and what we’ll do is we’ll make a PC board for $20 and sell it for $40 to make life easy for the people who want your computer.’ Woz wasn’t sure – they’d need to invest their own money to make it happen and he wasn’t convinced they’d make it back – but Jobs, as we all know, was a convincing man. Thus the Apple I was born. For Woz, though, this was an imperfect machine. He set to work on a successor. ‘Within three months I designed really a computer from the ground up, the Apple II, and for some reason it wound up with half as many parts, ten times the computer. Nobody would have expected colour to be in a computer – it was just a shock to the world it could be done at an affordable cost in that year.’ This time there was no question of sharing the design for free, but the young men had a problem. They knew they could shift a thousand of the computers, but that required an upfront investment of $250,000. The pair went to see Commodore boss Jack Tramiel to ask for the investment but could not come to an agreement; famously, Commodore went on to build the PET. The two Steves asked their friends at Atari, but the company was too busy creating the first home Pong game. They tried to persuade venture capitalists, but most weren’t interested in investing in two young men without any business experience. Especially when one of them – Jobs – didn’t at that point believe in wearing deodorant or shoes. Their saviour was Mike Markkula, an angel investor and former Intel sales executive with enough technical nous to realise that computers were the next big thing. He invested around $80,000 of his own money in return for being one-third owner of the company – and on the proviso that Wozniak quit his job with HewlettPackard. After some persuasion from friends and family, and one last failed attempt to persuade the HP board that computers were more than a hobbyist niche, Woz did exactly that. Now the hard work of producing the computer. Steve Wozniak took command of the insides, winning one crucial argument with Jobs about the need for eight expansion slots: while these ruined the elegance Jobs craved even in the late 1970s,\n\n39\n\nthey also allowed third parties to develop add-in cards to provide extra power or new features (such as an external modem). With a 1MHz MOS Technology 6502 processor and 4kB of RAM, this was a powerful system for 1977. Combine this with Wozniak’s genius for creating circuit boards and extracting the most possible out of the available technology, and it stood apart from any commercially available computer of the late 1970s. But its killer feature, as Wozniak alludes to above, was that it offered the opportunity to create colour graphics; in its review of the Apple II in March 1978, Byte Magazine’s editor Carl Helmers chose a colour doodle of a bird created by a homebrew joystick to illustrate the piece. Meanwhile, Jobs applied his aesthetic to the case. While the Apple II looks ordinary now, he broke away from the convention common to computers from that era of exposing their inner workings; while this may appeal to the homebrew enthusiasts, he wanted the microcomputer to break out of its soldering-iron ghetto. And he went to great lengths to ensure it worked perfectly out of the box, commissioning a new type of power supply that wouldn’t require a noisy fan to keep it cool. According to Commodore engineer Bob Yannes, the Apple II’s early months were bumpy. ‘The Apple II was fully assembled, but it did not have a TV output because they couldn’t get around the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] emissions problems,’ Yannes is quoted as saying in Commodore: A Company On The Edge [4]. In particular, the Apple II’s strong radio interference signals meant it didn’t comply with the FCC’s strict Class B requirements for use of electronics in the home; this meant it couldn’t be shipped with a TV output. And without a built-in monitor, this was a big problem for domestic use. Chuck Peddle, creator of the 6502 processor, believed that Apple made three major design flaws when creating the Apple II. ‘[Wozniak] didn’t understand the way the [6502] chipset worked,’ Peddle said [5]. ‘There was a guy who was hired at Apple to redesign the Apple II and make it real engineering without offending Woz.’ Steve Wozniak also supplied his own version of BASIC to run the machine, Integer BASIC, with the intention of making the Apple II easy to use – or at least, easy compared to other computers of the time. A 68-page ‘mini manual’ to creating programs completed the job. But Integer BASIC lacked the sophistication of\n\n40\n\nApple II\n\nMicrosoft’s BASIC, leading to Markkula striking a deal to license it from the company. Thus, Apple BASIC was born. On its release in June 1977, and with a price of $1,295, the Apple II sold primarily to hobbyists and enthusiasts. According to Becoming Steve Jobs, within a year Apple was shipping 500 per month [6]. It’s worth asking, though, is that a big number? Bear in mind that Kit Spencer helped Commodore sell 30,000 PETs in the UK during 1978. The truth is that the Apple II needed a push, and that push came from two things: one a piece of luck, another a piece of genius. It should be no surprise that the genius came from Woz, who developed a floppy drive for the Apple II in time for a grand unveiling at the international technology trade show CES in January 1978. The drive eventually went on sale in July for $595. The piece of luck is that VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program and widely considered to be the Apple II’s killer app, made its way onto the Apple II at all. When Harvard student Dan Bricklin approached developers Personal Software with the bright idea for an electronic ledger, all the PETs in their office were tied up; they pointed him to the Apple II lying unused and the rest is history. The Apple II proved to be a tougher sell in the UK. British enthusiasts had to wait until the September 1978 edition of Personal Computer World to read a review of the system, where it was listed for sale at £1,250 with 16kB of RAM – plus £35 for the carrying bag, £220 for a TV, and £15 for a cassette player. And then you had to pay VAT on top. Little wonder that the reviewers concluded: ‘The Apple would be even more of a temptation were its price slightly lower.’ [7] Jack Schofield, then editor of The Guardian’s computing section, remembered the Apple II fondly when interviewed in late 2019. ‘It was an absolute wonder when it arrived, it was miraculous.’ However, miraculous doesn’t equal perfect. ‘It had a 40-character, 40-column screen, but it didn’t have proper lower-case letters. So you wrote everything in caps, and you did real caps as if they were inverse caps. And the machine was fairly flaky. I had two disk drives, but they were perched on top of the II, and then the monitor was perched on top of the two disk drives. So if you shoved it around, because you needed the desk space, then it could stop working. It was flaky as hell.’ The Apple II never sold in huge volumes in the UK, but was still a big influence. Instead of sitting in households around the land, its presence was felt on the future\n\n41\n\nmovers and shakers within the industry. Take Richard Miller, who would go on to be Vice President of Technology at Atari, CEO of VM Labs, and is now Chief Technology Officer of Pixelworks. Back in the early 1980s, he was working for a Basingstoke-based company that just happened to own an Apple II. ‘Me and a couple of friends would finish work and sit down with a biryani and a Coke at 7pm and sit around writing code. We’d write this code and punch it in and then watch things happen on the screen, and create video games and things. It was just brilliant.’ Mike Fischer, the co-founder of Research Machines, is equally effusive. ‘I think Woz is a genius,’ he says. ‘It was a partnership made in heaven. Steve Jobs wasn’t an electronic engineer, but he was certainly enough of an engineer to be able to understand what the technology should be able to do and to push Wozniak to do it.’ He adds: ‘Even we bought an Apple II in finance until VisiCalc was available under [the operating system] CP/M.’ Just like Fischer, Jobs saw the huge potential of computers in schools, with Apple winning a crucial bid with the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium that led to it buying 5,000 computers. This would both inject cash into the company, give Apple credibility with other school bodies, and help spread the Apple word to students, parents, and teachers alike. The Apple II, in all its incarnations, went on to sell almost six million units over the next 16 years. It propelled Apple from an amateur outfit to a professional company, and in doing so cemented its place in the computer-maker landscape as a creator of high-end, professional computers. While the company’s next two computers, the Apple III and Apple Lisa, never found the same levels of commercial success or sheer veneration among fans, the Apple Macintosh went onto become one of the definitive products of the 1980s.\n\n42\n\nApple II\n\nWhat came next Apple kept selling the original Apple II for two years, but a number of updates – with the Apple IIe the most popular – meant its DNA carried on until the early 1990s.\n\nApple II Plus Release 1979\n\nPrice £1,195\n\nThe Apple II Plus, or Apple II+, proved to be a hugely profitable successor to the Apple II. Shipping with the same processor but a choice of 16kB, 32kB, or 48kB of RAM, one of its best‑selling expansion packs was made by Microsoft: the Z-80 SoftCard allowed users to run the increasingly popular CP/M operating system thanks to its integrated Z80 processor.\n\nApple II Europlus Release 1979\n\nPrice £1,250\n\nThis is the Apple II that most British users will recognise. It’s essentially identical to the Apple II Plus, except the video output was switched from NTSC to the European PAL standard. Unfortunately, that came with a major negative of losing colour, because it was only Wozniak’s clever manipulation of the NTSC signal that allowed the Apple II to broadcast in colour. European users needed a separate video card if they wanted this luxury.\n\nApple III Release 1980\n\nPrice £4,340\n\nTargeted at businesses, as the price indicates, the Apple III was meant to gracefully succeed the Apple II, with enhancements such as a keyboard that produced both lower- and upper-case letters and an 80-column display. Sadly for Apple, ‘succeed’ wasn’t an apt word, with the III beset by technical problems at launch and then torpedoed by the IBM Personal Computer.\n\n43\n\nApple IIe Release 1983\n\nPrice £1,395\n\nA successor to the Apple II Plus, the IIe inherited the improved keyboard of the Apple III and the option of 80-column output through an add-in card. With backwards compatibility with the Apple II, and 48kB of RAM, it quickly found favour with Apple II owners as well as first-time buyers. Two years later, Apple created an ‘Enhanced’ version of the Apple IIe. This included a 65C02 processor and 128kB of RAM, giving it more compatibility with software being produced at the time; existing Apple IIe owners could buy an ‘enhancement kit’ for a suggested price of $70. The IIe’s line ended with the Platinum version, featuring an almost identical keyboard to that of the Apple IIGS. The Platinum was introduced in January 1987 and kept trundling on until 1993, when Apple finally discontinued the Apple II line.\n\nApple IIc Release 1984\n\nPrice £1,295\n\nThe ‘c’ here stands for compact, because this was designed as a luggable version of the Apple IIe – albeit with a new and faster 65C02 processor. Its smaller dimensions meant buyers lost expandability, but it came with five expansion cards built in and included 128kB of RAM, along with a mouse and 80-column support out of the box. It even had a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive.\n\nApple IIGS Release 1986\n\nPrice £999\n\nThe first sub-$1,000 Apple II series computer was also the most powerful, with a 16-bit WDC 65C816 processor that ran at 2.8MHz (notably, Apple hamstrung its speed to avoid the IIGS being faster than the Macintosh). The new chip meant it could address more memory, too, with Apple offering 256kB and 1MB options. The key letters, though, are G and S: these stood for graphics and sound, with support for 2-bit colour at 640×200 resolution, and 4-bit at 320×200. Music producers appreciated the dedicated synthesizer chip, with support for 32 voices.\n\n44\n\nApple II\n\nApple IIc Plus Release 1988\n\nPrice £675\n\nThere was no triumphant final hurrah for the Apple II series, with the Apple IIc Plus disappointing many fans due to its lack of Plus-ness. The updated luggable included a 800kB 3.5-inch floppy drive, but with no UK keyboard the IIc Plus was never made available outside the US.\n\nApple IIe Card Release 1991\n\nPrice £250\n\nBy 1991, the Apple II was 15 years old – yet when Apple released the Macintosh LC it recognised there was still a demand for software created for its veteran computer. With its own 65C02 processor and 256kB of RAM, the Apple IIe Card proved to be a worthy emulator for those who needed backwards compatibility.\n\nSources Interviews with Mike Fischer, Richard Miller, Dick Pountain, and Jack Schofield. 1.

How Clive Sinclair must have chuckled. In January the following year, he announced the ZX80: a personal computer that anyone could buy for £99.95. Heck, if you were willing to assemble it yourself, it only cost £79.95. Admittedly, this tiny computer wasn’t trying to compete directly with the Commodore PET. There was no built-in monitor, the membrane keyboard was about as joyful to type on as tapioca pudding, and it had some idiosyncrasies that only a mother could love – but it also cost a seventh of the PET’s price. For the first time, this was a computer that almost anyone could afford. It also fitted perfectly into two of Clive Sinclair’s key passions: a cut-down size and a cut-down price. It’s how he built his first fortune, after all. We can trace those passions all the way back to the early 1960s and the Sinclair Micro-6, a transistor-packed radio receiver that was smaller than a matchbox. ‘The smallest radio set in the world,’ boasted Sinclair’s adverts, along with the promise that it was ‘easily built in an evening!’ and that ‘you can even wear it like a wrist-watch’ [2]. And all for 59/6, which is just shy of £3 in decimal currency. While an adjustedfor-inflation price of around £65 sounds expensive, that’s a fraction of what people would pay for portable transistor radios at the time. Together with Jim Westwood, Clive Sinclair’s chief hardware engineer, Sinclair Radionics pumped out many successful products. Hi-fi amplifiers, pre-amps, a miniature FM radio kit, build-it-yourself stereos and, by the late 1960s, complete high-end hi-fi stereo units. Things were looking so good that the company placed an advert for a ‘First Class Secretary’ to assist the company’s Managing Director [3]. In a description that would now land Sinclair in court, it specified ‘an experienced, attractive girl’. At least it didn’t ask for a photo and vital stats. This stream of success – albeit punctuated with occasional flops and many delays – continued through much of the 1970s, but Sinclair’s stand-out hit was the Sinclair Executive calculator in 1972. This was designed by none other than a young Christopher Curry, who would eventually abandon Sinclair and form his own company (Acorn) with Hermann Hauser. ‘I had to fly out to Texas Instruments, in Texas, to get the latest chips,’ says Curry. ‘I flew off on New Year’s Day after a party at Clive’s where I was hideously drunk and had\n\n48\n\nSinclair ZX80 and ZX81\n\na terrible hangover. That was a dreadful flight.’ But it was worth it, with Curry returning to Cambridge clutching three of the five TMS1802 prototype chips then in existence. Curry spent the next three days soldering wires, creating a numerical keyboard using bent pieces of metal and plastic, and adding drivers for the LED display. ‘About three days after I got back, I remember putting the power on and to our huge astonishment seeing numbers – slightly wrong in some cases, we got some wires wrong to start with – but seeing numbers going across the screen. That was the closest thing to magic anybody had ever seen at that time.’ The Executive would go on to make Sinclair over £2.5 million in 1974 alone with the calculator selling at £79, despite having a bill of materials that added up to £11. It was a global hit, too, with Sinclair even selling pocket calculators in Japan. On its arrival in early 1974, the Cambridge Scientific calculator proved another huge hit, selling for £49 compared to £400 for an equivalent Hewlett-Packard machine. Sadly for Clive Sinclair, his company’s run of hits dried up in the mid-1970s, to be replaced by a string of loss-making products. There was the Black Watch, aimed at electronics hobbyists, which looked great with its red LED display but suffered from a series of problems: accuracy that varied depending on the temperature; terrible battery life; and a fragile design that was so susceptible to static shocks that huge numbers were sent back for repair. What’s more, the Japanese had recovered from their early setback and were now shipping calculators into Britain at a lower price than Sinclair. Their products were more reliable too: the Cambridge had a particular problem with an oxide layer building up on its contacts due to the minimal protection offered by the membrane keyboard. Sinclair had chosen to cut costs by switching to tin-lead coating rather than gold. It was a mistake he was destined to repeat with his computers. But the biggest drain on Sinclair’s resources – or to be precise, those of Sinclair Radionics – was the prolonged and painful development of the Microvision pocket television. This dated all the way back to 1966 when Sinclair had demonstrated a prototype pocket TV at a show, although the project was shelved for several years due to production issues with the CRT. By 1975, the idea was back, with Sinclair spending tens of thousands of pounds to develop the technology. Faced with big losses – £355,000 for the 1975/76 year on a £5.6 million turnover – and a bank that refused to extend his overdraft, Clive Sinclair\n\n49\n\nneeded to find a financial backer or scrap the dream of a miniature TV, along with the £500,000 he had already sunk into it. His answer came in the form of the then-Labour government’s National Enterprise Board (NEB). In return for 43% of the company, it paid £650,000 into the Sinclair Radionics coffers in August 1976. This was never going to be a match made in heaven. As part of the deal, the NEB wanted to enforce proper management structures – including a managing director to work with Sinclair – onto a company that had grown organically under the leadership of its visionary founder. Over the next two years, the NEB would continue to pour money into Sinclair Radionics even as Clive Sinclair grew more disenchanted with the partnership.\n\nSoon after NEB had bought its stake in Sinclair Radionics, Christopher Curry ‘left’ to head up a separate company – first called Sinclair Instruments but soon renamed Science of Cambridge – with the idea ‘to make volume products that we could sell in some of the distributor areas around the world where we had a good representation,’ says Curry. Its first product? An ambitious wrist calculator for people, in Curry’s words, to ‘solder themselves into a mess’ with. This doesn’t mean innovation dried up within Sinclair Radionics: the Sinclair Microvision TV1A Pocket Television finally went on sale in January 1977, and has even earned an entry into the V&A Collections [4]. The NEB-approved management team also invested a huge amount of money into Clive Sinclair’s concept of a flatscreen television. ‘He foresaw the day when the man in the street could be offered a 50in wall-mounted, flat-screen, space-saving television at a cost less than today’s bulky 25in set,’ wrote Rodney Dale in The Sinclair Story in 1985 [5]. By 1979, though, even bigger numbers were on the minds of the Radionics board. The NEB had invested almost £5 million of British taxpayers’ money into a company that was now losing £100,000 per month. The management team had one get-moneyquick idea: a cheap Sinclair microcomputer. But, after commissioning some initial designs, they didn’t like those numbers either, with an expected development cost of £500,000 balanced against swathes of uncertainty over whether this microcomputer idea would fly. The project was put on ice.\n\n50\n\nSinclair ZX80 and ZX81\n\nThe end was nigh for Sinclair Radionics, with the NEB breaking up the company into three different parts and bidding farewell to Clive Sinclair by means of a £10,000 golden handshake. While the NEB kept control of Sinclair’s profitable instruments business, they sold off the television division to Binatone and transferred the computer project to Newbury Labs (which it also held a stake in). This project was to become the ill-fated NewBrain. Christopher Curry, beavering away at Science of Cambridge, was also keen on computers, but his idea didn’t need £500,000 of investment. ‘I wanted to do the computer, not Clive,’ says Curry. ‘I’d been fascinated by an advert in one of the [American] magazines for something called a computer in a book. You actually bought a folder, and in one of the sheets was a PCB [printed circuit board] and the others were envelopes with bits in it. Selling it as a book instead of a computer – it was a very crude computer – seemed to be an awfully good idea.” It’s around this point that Ian Williamson enters the story. ‘What I could see was this incredible thirst for knowledge about microprocessors,’ he told The Register in 2014 [6]. ‘Certainly anyone who was an electronics engineer felt threatened by the technology and wanted to learn about it.’ His idea was to create a cheap kit for engineers and hobbyists to experiment with microprocessors and program them. He created a prototype based on a National Semiconductor SC/MP evaluation board, and hooked it up to a Sinclair calculator for input and output. Having no desire to develop the prototype into a finished product himself – he had landed a plum job with Leyland – Williamson reached out to Clive Sinclair to try to sell him the design. Sinclair introduced Williamson to Curry (neatly sidestepping Sinclair Radionics and the NEB) and for a while it seemed that Science of Cambridge would indeed develop the project. According to The Sinclair Story, there was even an agreement drawn up for a ‘£5,000 down payment plus royalties’ [7]. A phone call to National Semiconductor – usually shortened to Nat Semi – would ultimately change the course of history, however. On hearing that Curry was willing to buy in bulk, an enterprising sales manager suggested that Nat Semi could help with the logic design. It was an opportunity too good to pass up and ultimately became the MK14: Curry assembled and taped out the PCBs, then used the notes created by the Nat Semi sales engineer for the logic design. That same engineer also helped with the early programming work, which was finished off by David Johnson-Davies.\n\n51\n\nThis project became the £40 MK14, a microprocessor kit comprised of 14 pieces. While it was released under the Science of Cambridge banner, it already showed all the hallmarks of a Sinclair computer, right down to a cheap membrane keyboard and long delays for delivery: a reviewer in the May 1979 edition of Practical Electronics claiming that he ‘received one in January which was ordered in the previous summer! Others have experienced waits from two to four months’. [8] Still, the review concluded with the words, ‘my firm opinion is that no electronics enthusiast or engineer should be without one in today’s technology’ and estimated sales figures of 20,000 suggest others agreed. The MK14 proved beyond doubt that there was a market for microcomputers; if the MK14, which was essentially a My First Microprocessor training kit, could sell in such volume, what was the limit for a ‘proper’ microcomputer? It was a thought that prompted Curry to set up his own company with Hermann Hauser, which would lead directly to the Acorn Microcomputer System 1 and, in a more roundabout fashion, to the BBC Micro. And the moment Clive Sinclair was released from the shackles of the National Enterprise Board, he wasted no time in instructing Jim Westwood to get to work and produce a cheap Sinclair microcomputer. Westwood set to the task with his usual enthusiasm. ‘It’s a challenge managing to achieve something without using expensive components and I like that challenge,’ he told Sinclair User in 1982 [9]. ‘Of all the products with which I have been involved I think the ZX80 is my favourite. It was a real breakthrough in the use of cheap components. It is something which ought to be in the Ark by now but I am still proud of it.’ As well he should: from a ‘mess which we call a breadboard’ he created a computer that sold around 50,000 units and gave many Britons their first taste of a personal computer. Admittedly, he did so using readily available components, with the only Sinclair-created ingredient being the firmware. Few cared: to include a 3.25MHz Z80 processor in a ready-made computer that cost less than £100 was quite a feat. (Well, a replica Z80 processor: it was actually made by NEC.) There were inevitable sacrifices, with the biggest being the 1kB of RAM and 4kB of ROM. Having only 1kB of memory severely limited the ZX80’s capabilities, to the point where it was a machine to experiment with programming on but little else. You\n\n52\n\nSinclair ZX80 and ZX81\n\ncould load programs from a tape recorder, but if buyers were hoping for a singing and dancing computer then they were to be disappointed. If the ZX80 ever entered a Celebrity Computers Come Dancing contest, it would be out after the first show. It’s debatable whether it would have won points for style: its tiny vacuum-formed plastic case lent it a futuristic air, but still felt cheap. And those output grilles at the top were not what they seemed. ‘What always amused me was the printed-on cooling slots,’ says Jack Lang, co-founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and a key part of Cambridge University’s hugely influential Computer Laboratory. If people became frustrated by the 1kB of RAM, there was an expansion port on the rear. Memory upgrades were initially criminally expensive – £300 for 16kB – but the good news for early investors is that prices did come down. By 1982, you could buy a third-party 16kB add-on pack for £32.95. The ZX80 was also the first outing for Sinclair BASIC, created by John Grant from Nine Tiles. His skill was to make it easy for users to pick up BASIC through on-screen prompts that would tell them if they were making a mistake, and to make things that little bit easier you could press, say, ‘Q’ and ‘PRINT’ would appear on screen. As Grant explained in an interview on the Floppy Days podcast in 2018 [10], this shorthand also meant the BASIC took up less space as, ‘I didn’t then have to have code that recognised “P-R-I-N-T” and translated that into the keyword PRINT’. It was tricks such as this that enabled Grant to perform the minor miracle of squeezing a beginner-friendly version of BASIC into 4kB of ROM. To make life even easier for newcomers to BASIC, not only would you be told of a syntax error during typing but Sinclair included a 128-page manual that introduced newcomers to the language. Not that the ZX80’s simplicity stopped Clive Sinclair from giving it some pizzazz at its launch in January 1980. ‘It’s the biggest leap forward we’ve ever made in terms of price and technology,’ he claimed [11]. Adverts, meanwhile, led with the boast that: ‘Inside a day, you’ll be talking to it like an old friend!’ What Sinclair didn’t go into were the little irritations that bugged early users. The biggest of these was screen flicker: this happened whenever you typed something in. While Clive Sinclair defended this at launch with the claim that it was a feature, because it gave the user ‘positive feedback’ [12], it was actually a cost-cutting measure: the Z80 processor controlled the output to the screen, rather than using a dedicated video chip.\n\n53\n\nWith such limited RAM, programmers also needed to compromise on either program complexity or output: for instance, using the ZX80’s maximum output of 32 characters per line and 24 lines per page consumed over 600 bytes. Or viewed the other way, if you were running a program that consumed over 900 bytes then you would be left with only a handful of lines for output. As for sound… well, silence is golden. We should also emphasise that the ZX80 (and the ZX81) could only output in black and white, with Sinclair fans waiting until the Spectrum for glorious colour. It used the same trick as the Commodore PET for creating ‘graphics’ too: with no hardware sprites, it relied on block-based graphics that were part of the character set. Early games writers needed to come up with imaginative innovations to ensure their games looked good. Then there was the touch-sensitive keyboard with no moving keys. Again, Sinclair’s spin machine was working at full speed to emphasise the fact it was spillproof, and that you could even pour a cup of coffee over the ZX80 without ill effect, but there was soon a booming market in third-party keyboards due to the fact that it had to be used with extreme care to avoid brushing the wrong letters. In his review for Personal Computer World [13], David Tebbutt memorably wrote: ‘Typing gives a sensation of drumming your fingers rather than of doing anything useful.’ But he quickly went on to say: ‘This is a totally mistaken impression because it really works rather well.’ Indeed, Tebbutt was one of many in the British press to lavish praise on Sinclair’s computer despite its drawbacks. ‘The ZX80 appears to be a well thought out machine both in terms of its hardware and software,’ he wrote, before concluding: ‘I hope Mr Sinclair and his merry men of Cambridge can cope with the expected flood of orders.’ Cambridge was also the start of Sinclair’s invasion into America with the ZX80, although this time it was Cambridge, Massachusetts, which sits across the river from Boston. ‘I met up with [Clive] there on his way back from Vegas,’ recalls Nigel Searle. ‘He had his ZX80 prototype with him, which he hooked up to the TV in his room at the hotel. By lunchtime the next day, we had rented an office in Boston, incorporated the business, and I rented an apartment right next to the office. Then we went and had lunch.’\n\n54\n\nSinclair ZX80 and ZX81\n\nThe great benefit of exporting the ZX80 to the US market was that it needed minimal modifications, other than improvements to its RF radiation output. And the US public lapped it up. ‘We ran some audacious ads,’ says Searle. ‘We were just getting such a phenomenal response, we would run an ad that cost a couple of thousand dollars and get $20,000 or $30,000 worth of sales.’ Even as Sinclair Research was ramping up production of the ZX80, Jim Westwood was focusing his effort on the ZX81. Rather than create a more advanced computer, his brief was to bring the price down yet further. Westwood achieved this feat by reducing the number of chips from 21 to 4, thanks to an Uncommitted Logic Array (ULA) made by Ferranti (a company that crops up often in the history of 1980s British computers, and not always positively). Aside from this, the ZX81’s fundamental specification was unchanged from the ZX80: still 1kB of RAM, still a Z80 processor. But there were numerous improvements. First, the screen flicker was gone. The cunning trick was a SLOW mode: here, the Z80 would dedicate a quarter of its time to running the current program and the rest to display output. Thanks to an extra 4kB of ROM, Steve Vickers from Nine Tiles made some neat enhancements to the BASIC, most notably adding support for non-integers and over 30 extra functions. This brought it much closer to the ‘official’ ANSI standard for Full BASIC. Richard Altwasser is fulsome in his praise for what Vickers achieved. ‘He pretty much single-handedly wrote, tested, and debugged the Spectrum BASIC – and wrote the instruction manual.’ With the help of vacuum forming, the hardware was also improved. Legendary industrial designer Rick Dickinson overhauled the design, and would win a 1981 Design Council award for his efforts, even if the controversial membrane keyboard remained in place. ‘The ZX81 looks and feels good,’ wrote Tim Hartnell in Your Computer Magazine [14]. ‘It is about the size – 7in by 7in – and weight of a paperback book, finished in matt black, with a matt-plastic keyboard finished in red and black.’ While castigating Sinclair for the instability of his test machine, and the 16kB RAM expansion pack in particular, Hartnell still described the ZX81 as a ‘very good first computer’. He concluded: ‘You will learn a good deal, have considerable fun, and when – in eight months or so – you are ready to move on to another machine, you will have enough knowledge to know exactly which computer to buy.’\n\n55\n\nDavid Tebbutt was even more unequivocal in his praise. ‘He’s done it again,’ he wrote in the June 1981 edition of Personal Computer World [15]. ‘Uncle Clive has come up with a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting to find out more about computers, but without it costing an arm and a leg.’ And the initial price was very low indeed. £49.95 if bought as a kit and £69.95 assembled was difficult to argue with, and unlike the ZX80, Sinclair wasn’t charging an additional £8.95 for the mains adapter (although postage and packing was still an extra £2.95). By this time, though, Sinclair knew there was a lot of money to be made through extras. At launch, it was selling the 16kB RAM pack for £49.95, and this would soon be followed by a printer for the same price. The usual Sinclair advertising blitz soon followed, with ads in national newspapers promising [16], ‘Inside a day, you’ll be talking to it like a new friend.’ Note the subtle change from ‘old friend’ in the ZX80 ads to ‘new friend’, an early Easter egg for true Sinclair fans. The ad also declared that ‘you’ll find it of immense practical value. The computer understanding it gives you will be useful in any business or professional sphere. And the grounding it gives your children will equip them for the rest of their lives.’ The ‘free course in computing’ promised by the same advertisement came via a ring-bound 212-page guide, adding yet more weight to the feeling of value. Little wonder, then, that it proved a huge success. Production at the Timex facto"
