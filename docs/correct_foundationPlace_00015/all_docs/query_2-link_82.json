        "text": "1980s 1981 May\n\nRobb Wilmot joined ICL as MD at age of 36. Before that he was at TI where he did business with Sinclair Research and became a friend of Clive Sinclair.\n\nJohn Mathieson joins Sinclair Research Ltd. He came straight from Cambridge University.\n\nDecember\n\nICL announces plans to use Sinclair BASIC and flat-tube TV for 'One Per Desk' terminal/telephone workstation.\n\n1982 August\n\nDavid Karlin joins Sinclair Research Ltd. He left Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp. in the US because 1) he wanted to go back home to England and 2) Clive Sinclair offered him his dream job to build his own computer. David Karlin at his early days at Sinclair Research Ltd.\n\nDecember\n\nSinclair confirms new computer under development, to incorporate 'flat screen' and 'dual microfloppies'.\n\n1983 May\n\nMicrodrive launch announced for end of May, and 'ZX84 to be a portable' says Searle.\n\nJune\n\nClive Sinclair receives Knighthood from HM Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n1984 January\n\nSinclair QL Professional Computer at January 12th, 12 days before the Apple Macintosh!\n\nMarch\n\nSINCLAIR RESEARCH admits that it might have difficulty keeping to the 28-day period specified on its order forms because of incredible demand for the new QL. A spokesman for the company says: \"We have had something like 500 to 600 orders every day, so we are beginning to think about delivery problems and how to avoid them.\" (Sinclair User Issue 25, April 1984).\"\n\nApril\n\nPromises, promises... HAS THE QL finally arrived? At the time of going to press a spokesman for Sinclair Research was confident some customers would receive their computers by the beginning of April, but declined to estimate how many orders would be fulfilled. The delays have caused a reduction in orders received, though the number is well in excess of 10,000. Customers ordering QLs in March received acknowledgements with expected delivery dates in June, when monthly production should be nearing the promised 20,000 units. (Sinclair User Issue 26, Mai 1984)\n\nFirst batch of 89 QL's were shipped to customers by car (SST)\n\nMay\n\nFirst reported delivery of a QL to mail order customer - but returned within a week\n\nASA upholds complaints on QL advertising delivery claims, and Spectrum Chess program advertising\n\nJuly\n\nSINCLAIR RESEARCH has defended the delays in QL deliveries and is confident that the same situation will not arise again. Sir Clive Sinclair told journalists at the beginning of July: \"The delays in delivery of the QL have not been as great as those experienced when other computers, such as the IBM PC and Acorn Electron, were launched yet we have tended to get all the bricks thrown at us.\" (Sinclair User Issue 30, September 1984)\n\nQLs delivered on time says Sinclair Research IT SEEMS that production of the QL is now up and running with delivery dates to customers fulfilled, despite initial hiccups. Another version of the machine to be shipped to the ever-patient public no longer has the external EPROM hanging from the back - it has been incorporated in the main casing. The bugs present in the first machines have, according to Sinclair spokesman Bill Nichols, been eliminated. They included the tendency of the software to crash and the slow loading time of the Microdrives. The final version of the QL, with the internal EPROM replaced by ROMs, was due to appear towards the end of July. Nichols would not indicate the exact number of QLs shipped to date but said Sinclair Research is on schedule to supply the first 13,000 customers by the promised August delivery dates. The completed manuals have also been delivered, though the ones received at the Sinclair User offices were far from being error-free. With QL problems now, it is hoped, a thing of the past, the stage is set for Sir Clive to attempt to topple Acorn from its enviable position in schools and colleges and, in the States, to recapture the market lost by the withdrawal of Timex earlier this year. (Sinclair User Issue 29, August 1984)\n\nQL production reported to be '2000 a week'\n\nCorrected versions QL User Guide due in August.

The machine uses the QL circuit board, which includes the Sinclair ULA, with microdrives and includes a modem, terminal emulation software and monitor. ICL is taking the Sinclair Research lead and supplying the Psion XChange software suite, with upgraded versions of Quill, Archive, Abacus and Easel, on in-built ROM in the package which is to sell for £1,200. Sinclair Research is pleased that ICL has delivered its well-timed pat on the back for its pioneering stance in computing. A spokesman for the company says: \"It is nice to see that other people are endorsing our technology.\" (Sinclair User Issue 34, January 1985)\n\nQL sales variable THE QL has been greeted with mixed reactions by the retail trade. While stores such as WH Smith and Boots are pleased with sales, smaller outlets are not so happy. A spokeswoman for WH Smith says: \"The QL is selling out fast. We are having no problems with the machine but would like to see more software for it.\" The same is true of Dixons. Dave Gilbert, a spokesman for the company, says: \"We can't get enough of them. It is selling very well. We have had no problems with orders and get all that we need.\" Smaller shops are having a limited success with the QL. John Arundel of The Silica Shop in Kent says: \"We have the QL, and some people have bought them. They are slow to move though.\" Michael Howard of the Buffer Micro Shop reports a similar story. \"We are getting all the QLs that we need. They are not going in vast numbers but we are selling them.\" Sinclair Research is confident that the slow start will turn into a rush when more people realise that the machine is in the shops. A spokesman says: \"Dealers are happy with the QL. Word is out that it is in the shops now and sales will increase accordingly.\"(Sinclair User Issue 34, January 1985)\n\n1985 January\n\n10 Jan - C5 electric tricycle launched at £399\n\n16 Jan - Sinclair shows FM wristwatch radio at Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in US\n\n30 Jan - Microdrive cartridge price dropped to £1.99 as cartridge sales reach 750,000.

Free upgrades provided to QLUB members\n\nCelebrations of Sinclair's success in the computer market continued at the Which Computer? Show in Birmingham. A competition was held in which the five millionth computer was up for grabs. In typical Sinclair style it was a gold coloured QL.(Sinclair User Issue 36, March 1985)\n\nMarch\n\n12 Mar - Plans to form and seek funding for separate company for wafer-scale chips under Robb Wilmot are announced by Clive. Wilmot appointed a director of Sinclair Research\n\nInstitutions holding 10 per cent shares told profits to December £7.9m on £89m turnover, stocks held £34m\n\n25 Mar - Intensive TV and press marketing campaign for QL starts. Sinclair states it 'intends' to sell 200,000 QLs this year\n\nComputers go to college SEVEN thousand students at Strathclyde University will each have the use of a QL by 1990. The project is being spearheaded by Professor James Alty - head of the University's Computer Science Department - whose aim is to give all students in related subjects their own personal computers for use in halls of residence as well as on the university campus. Sinclair Research has joined forces with the university and has donated the first 525 machines together with some peripherals and software - worth around £250,000. Andy Knott from Sinclair Research comments, \"We feel that the QL is an excellent machine for this type of use and we hope this will be the first of many such projects. We're terribly excited about it.\" Further support is being given by the Computer Board for Universities and Research Councils which is providing a grant of over £150,000 and Epson and MBS Data Efficiency are providing printers and colour monitors respectively. Professor Alty, determined to use British hardware and software for the project, chose the QL as it \"could offer the computing power, range of applications and above all, the portability at a suitable price.\" Alty explains the need for more computers at the university: \"The need is for a work station capable of some stand-alone functions such as local filing, editing and program compilation while being capable of linking to the campus network.\"(Sinclair User Issue 37, April 1985)\n\nApril\n\nFigures (not released until November) show pre-tax loss of £18m on turnover of £102m. £22m written off for decrease in stock value and bad debts\n\n16 Apr - Spanish language QL launched\n\nThe QL bounces back Faced with a fading market image and indifferent Christmas sales, Sir Clive Sinclair gathered together those companies with QL products to present a miniature trade show for the machine in London on February 27. Held at the London Hilton, the relaunch saw Sir Clive defending the QL against rumours that Atari's promised range of 16-bit micros would demolish QL sales. \"I don't rate Atari,\" he said, with something of the old Sinclair flamboyance. \"We are a year ahead of them, and we have a cleverer machine, with the microdrives, for example.\" Sir Clive went on to announce plans for the first waferchip product, a 0.5 megabyte storage medium which he said would be a viable alternative to Winchester drives. \"Being solid state, it is more rugged than a Winchester,\" he said. The product will be priced at under £300 and battery powered. It will retain data stored after the power has been switched off, and the batteries can be changed without a break in power continuity. As yet, said Sir Clive, there was no firm production schedule, but he hinted that it should be available by the end of the year. New products displayed at the show included a C-compiler from GST, Cambridge LISP from Metacomco, and QL Home Finance and Entrepreneur from Buzzz Software and Tryptych Publishing respectively. New model on the scene YET ANOTHER QL is on the way from Sinclair Research. The JS ROM includes a new series of SuperBasic commands centred around WHEN ... ERROR statements, as well as improved microdrives. The command checks for errors and then, instead of simply crashing the program, activates another part of the program instead. One danger is that it is non-recursive, which means that if there is an error in the new routine, the program will keep nesting the errors until it crashes completely. Knott adds that the new ROM is not considered to constitute a major change in the QL specifications, and those changes which are significant would only be of interest to highly skilled programmers. (Sinclair User Issue 38, May 1985)\n\nMay\n\nSeveral London retailers discount QL prices in stores\n\n14 May - French language QL launched\n\n28 May - Sinclair confirms it is seeking £10m-15m to 'fund long-term growth and restructuring' and a new chief executive to replace Clive in this role, denies Clive intends to relinquish his position as chairman, and counters reports of weak computer market by stating they shipped 300,000 Spectrums in pre-Xmas period\n\nSinclair's QL armada FOREIGN language versions of the QL are now coming into production with software packages translated. The first of the new machines, a Spanish version, has already been launched, and Sinclair Research is to follow that with French, Italian and Danish. Further planned launches include Turkish, Greek, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and Arabic. \"Some countries, such as Greece, require completely different keyboards, and others, such as France have different keyboard layouts,\" says a spokeswoman.(Sinclair User Issue 39, June 1985)\n\nJune\n\n17 June - Robert Maxwell announces rescue bid for Sinclair Research, which has £15m debts. Deal to leave Clive with 8 percent, chairmanship and consultancy\n\nSinclair announces wafer-scale integration process proven viable for commercial production, to be used in 500K memory add-on for QL\n\nA halt in production A HALT to QL production was called recently because output had exceeded demand. Julian Goldsmith, a spokesman for Sinclair Research, confirms that production is at a standstill but says that 'the measure is only short-term'. Previously, Sir Clive Sinclair had been predicting that 200,000 QLs would be sold this year but generous estimates have put the total sold at 60,000 covering the period since it was launched. The company is now looking for sales abroad and has converted much of its English stockpile for foreign markets, two of which are Spain and the United States. Goldsmith says: \"Spain is a big market and we have a 75 percent share of it.\" The introduction of the QL into the States has also provoked a lot of interest. The company says that it has received over 26,000 enquiries about the QL and that the machine should have a strong future in the States. Former Sinclair managing director Nigel Searle is co-ordinating the marketing operation. Searle is eminently qualified to spearhead the attack on the US. He has had eight years experience of the American way of life and three of those where spent as managing director of Sinclair US in Boston. He is not worried by the relative lack of success so far encountered by the company. He said, at a meeting of manufacturers and distributors before he left Britain, that before they had joined Timex they had sold almost 25,000 computers on the American market. The company was optimistic that it could sell at least 50,000 machines this year.(Sinclair User Issue 40, July 1985)\n\nJuly\n\nQL beats the field THE MICROCOMPUTER of the Year is the QL, according to the judges of the British Microcomputer Awards. The award was accepted by Sir Clive Sinclair who received a standing ovation at a ceremony in London, arranged by Thames Television, the Sunday Times and VNU Publications. He also picked up the VNU Educational Award for the Spectrum version of Logo, programmed for Sinclair Research by LCSI. Psion chairman David Potter also received a trophy when the Psion bundled exchange packages for the QL won the Thames Home Software Award. Matthew Gaved of Psion commented ecstatically: \"Fantastic, marvellous. We are very, very pleased. It is good news for Sinclair and it shows that the QL is still alive and well.\"(Sinclair User Issue 41, August 1985)\n\nAugust\n\n9 Aug - Maxwell aborts Sinclair Research takeover\n\nDixons take 160,000 computers and FTV1 flat-screen TVs for £10m\n\n24 Aug - QL price cut from £399 to £199.95\n\nNo launch in the US THE SPECTACULAR launch of the QL in the US has not materialised. Nigel Searle, former managing director of Sinclair Research, went over to the States in May to organise the bonanza for which, he said, the American people were ready. Although Searle encountered 'immense interest' from the market little of that turned into hard cash. A spokeswoman for the company comments: \"Nigel Searle did not want to jump into a new and different market straight away.\" So, any Americans wanting a QL will have to buy it from Sinclair Research at $499.00.(Sinclair User Issue 42, September 1985)\n\nSeptember\n\n19 Sep - Digital Research confirms talks taking place with Sinclair over GEM operating system for QL\n\n23 Sep - Spectrum 128K version unveiled at Barcelona Computer Fair, result of joint venture with Investronica and Sinclair Research\n\nQL prices plummet\n\nTHE PRICE of the QL has been slashed in half, making it the only 16-bit microcomputer for less than £200.00.\n\nThe move comes at the start of what Sinclair Research claims to be an aggressive Christmas marketing campaign and should make potential customers think twice before buying machines such as the ST and Amiga.\n\nJane Boothroyd, UK sales and marketing manager for Sinclair Research says: \"We have reduced the price of the QL to consumers in line with reduced manufacturing costs. We will achieve major savings from a substantial increase in manufacturing volume. If the QL price drop is successful in attracting new customers it will bring down the price of software and should entice more software houses into the QL market.\"(Sinclair User Issue 43, October 1985)\n\nOctober\n\n17 Oct - 'Pandora' '68000-based' portable scheduled for April 1986, at £300\n\n25 Oct - 'Enigma' leaked to Your Computer, May 1986, 3.5-inch discs, mouse, monitor, printer and Psion packages for '£500-1000'.
