WEB OS WEB OS In metacomputing , WebOS and Web operating system are terms that describe network services for internet scale distributed computing , as in the WebOS Project at UC Berkeley , [1] and the WOS Project. [2] In both cases the scale of the web operating system extends across the internet, like the web . However, the terms WebOS and Web operating system have been employed more broadly and with far greater popularity in the context of &quot;the web as in HTTP&quot; , and for many meanings ranging from singular systems to collections of systems. [3] [4] [5] [6] In April 2002, Tim O'Reilly spoke of &quot;the emergent Internet operating system&quot; as an open collection of Web services . [7] Web OS In a usage referring to singular network services, a Web operating system is another name for a Webtop , including eyeOS , YouOS , G.ho.st , icloud , Stoneware webOS,and DesktopTwo . These services turn the desktop into a service that runs on the Internetrather than on the local computer. As these services include a file system and application management system, they increasingly overlap with the functionality of a traditional desktop computer operating system.\n\n3. AMOEBA OS The emoeba OS began as a research project at vrije universiteit(free university)in amsterdam . Objective;to connect multiple computers in a seamless,invisible way. We will; examine characteristics of amoeba OS . present diagram of its structure give pros and cons of its implementation present our personal reactions to its feutures.\n\n4. DESKTOP TWO Desktoptwo is a free Webtop developed by Sapotek (it's also been called a WebOS although Sapotek states on its website that the term is premature and presumptuous) that mimics the look, feel and functionality of the desktop environment of an operating system . The software is currently in beta stage. It has an Spanish version called Computadora.de. Desktoptwo is web-based and requires Adobe Flash Player to operate. The web applications ' found on Desktoptwo are built on PHP in the back end. Features include drag-and-drop functionality. [1] Sapotek has liberated all the web applications found on Desktoptwo through Sapodesk on an AGPL license. Desktoptwo belongs to a category of services that intend to turn the Web into a full-fledged platform by using web services as a foundation along with presentation technologies that replicate the experience of desktop applications for users. In a &quot;Cloud OS&quot; the functionality of a server is granularized and abstracted as Web services that Web developers can use to create composite applications similar to how desktop software developers use several APIs of the OS to create their applications Some of the features currently found on Desktoptwo are: File sharing , Webmail , Blog creator, Instant messenger , Address book, Calendar, RSS Reader and Office productivity applications.\n\n5. G.ho.st G.ho.st (usually pronounced ghost ) is the trading name of Ghost Inc. and the service name and URL of the company's hosted computer operating system or WebOS service. Its name is an acronym of Global Hosted Operating SysTem . The G.ho.st service provides, over the Internet , a working environment that mimics the classic desktop provided by personal computer operating systems. As an internet based service, users are able to create, save and return to a working environment from different physical computers. G.ho.st calls itself a Virtual Computer . In April 2007 the software entered alpha stage development, and as of May 2008 it remains in this stage. The Company's primary investor is Benchmark Capital .\n\n6. You OS YouOS is a web operating system that lets you run diverse applications within a web browser. Small applications like sticky notes or clocks. Large applications like word processing, mp3 players, and instant messaging. Even better, it's very easy to tweak an existing application or write your own.\n\n7. BROWSER OS BROWSER OS communicate with web servers primarily using the HTTP protocol to fetch web pages identified by their http: URL . HTTP allows web browsers to submit information to web servers as well as fetch web pages from them. The file format for a web page is usually HTML and is identified in the HTTP protocol using a MIME content type . Most browsers natively support a variety of formats in addition to HTML, such as the JPEG , PNG and GIF image formats, and can be extended to support more through the use of plugins . Many browsers also support a variety of other URL types and their corresponding protocols, such as ftp: for FTP , gopher: for Gopher , and https: for HTTPS (a SSL encrypted version of HTTP). The combination of HTTP content type and URL protocol specification allows web page designers to embed images, animations, video, sound, and streaming media into a web page, or to make them accessible through the web page.\n\n8. Eye OS in mainly PHP , XML , and JavaScript . It acts as a platform for web applications written using the eyeOS Toolkit. It includes a Desktop environment with 67 applications and system utilities. eyeOS is an open source web desktop following the Cloud computing concept, written It is accessible by portable devices via its mobile front end.\n\n9. THE VERSIONS OF EYE OS With the release of eyeOS 1.1 on July 2 , 2007 , eyeOS changed its license and migrated from GNU GPL Version 2 to Version 3 . Version 1.2 was released just a few months after the 1.1 version and integrated full compatibility with Microsoft Word files. eyeOS 1.5 Gala was released on January 15 , 2008 . This version is the first to support both Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org file formats for documents, presentations and spreadsheets. It also has the ability to import and export documents in both formats using server side scripting. [5] eyeOS 1.6 was released April 25 , 2008 and included many improvements such as synchronization with local computers, drag and drop, a mobile version and more. eyeOS 1.8 Lars was released January 7 , 2009 and featured a completely rewritten file manager and a new sound API to develop media rich applications\n\n10.

Blis/cobol BLIS/COBOL was an operating system that, unusually, was written in COBOL . It is the only such system to gain reasonably wide acceptance. It was optimised to compile business application written in COBOL. BLIS was available on a range of Data General Nova and Data General Eclipse 16-bit minicomputers\n\n13. bluebottle Bluebottle , (formerly known as AOS and recently as A2 ), is the name of the next generation Native Oberon , the Oberon operating system for bare PC hardware. It was developed at the ETH Zürich . It is lean and fast and has support for multiprocessor machines. It is completely based on an upward compatible dialect of the Oberon programming language called Active Oberon . Its User Interface supports a kind of &quot; point and click &quot; metaphor to execute commands out of simple text as hyperlinks, which can be clicked in a browser. The user interface is zooming (see ZUI ), which can be seen in the YouTube external link below.\n\n14.

BS2000 BS2000 (officially renamed BS2000/OSD in 1992) is the mainframe operating system platform of Fujitsu Siemens Computers . Mainframe systems are optimized to enable many programs to be installed in parallel and run concurrently on a computer. This helps reduce the number of computers required to a minimum. Originally this was a way to achieve cost savings, since at that time hardware components were considerably more expensive than now. Today, the advantage of an architecture that gets by with significantly fewer computers is that it greatly reduces the complexity of the IT infrastructure , thus saving on IT running costs and increasing IT robustness . To avoid different applications and users on a computer adversely affecting one another by contending for resources , mainframe systems must be able to segregate the different users and processes from one another in an optimum manner. They do this by virtualizing all the resources used by the applications and by centralized resource management controlled in a finely graduated way based on access rights and priorities. At the same time the high degree of virtualization decouples the application software from hardware and implementation details and so creates the foundation for the long-term compatibility, high flexibility, high availability, extensive scalability and great robustness of the services running on mainframes. Unlike other mainframe systems, BS2000/OSD provides exactly the same user and programming interface in all operating modes (batch, interactive and online transaction processing) and regardless of whether it is running natively or as a guest system in a virtual machine . This uniformity of the user interface and the entire BS2000 software configuration makes administration and automation particularly easy.\n\n16. Bs 3000 Brother 136 Agfa PS3 fonts ( BS - 3000 ) ...

CP/M CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers) is an operating system originally created for Intel 8080 / 85 based microcomputers by Gary Kildall of Digital Research, Inc . Initially confined to single tasking on 8-bit processors and no more than 64 kilobytes (64 KiB ) of memory, later versions of CP/M added multi-user variations, and were migrated to 16-bit processors . The combination of CP/M and S-100 bus computers patterned on the MITS Altair was an early &quot;industry standard&quot; for microcomputers, and was widely used through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s. By greatly reducing the amount of programming required to install an application on a new manufacturer's computer, CP/M increased the market size for both hardware and software.\n\n18. flex 9 Flex 9 for OS X... can it be used on OS 9 - A forum for all things RE:Vision FX - ReVision FX Forum\n\n19. Future operating systems January 8, 2003 (Computerworld) -- Today's operating systems are conceptually upside-down. They developed the hard way, gradually struggling upwards from the machinery (processors, memory, disks and displays) toward the user. In the future, operating systems and information management tools will grow top-down.\n\n20. Graphical Environment Manager GEM ( G raphical E nvironment M anager) was a windowing system created by Digital Research, Inc. (DRI) for use with the CP/M operating system on the Intel 8088 and Motorola 68000 microprocessors . Later versions ran over DOS as well. GEM is known primarily as the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Atari ST series of computers, and was also supplied with a series of IBM PC -compatible computers from Amstrad . It was the core for a small number of DOS programs, the most notable being Ventura Publisher . It was ported to a number of other computers that previously lacked graphical interfaces, but never gained popularity on those platforms. DRI also produced FlexGem for their FlexOS real-time operating system .\n\n21. GEOS GEOS ( G raphic E nvironment O perating S ystem ) was an operating system from Berkeley Softworks (later GeoWorks ). Originally designed for the Commodore 64 and released in 1986 , it provided a graphical user interface for this popular 8-bit computer. GEOS closely resembled early versions of Mac OS and included a graphical word processor (geoWrite) and paint program (geoPaint). For many years, Commodore bundled GEOS with its redesigned and cost reduced C64, the C64C. At its peak, GEOS was the third most popular operating system in the world in terms of units shipped, trailing only MS-DOS and Mac OS.\n\n22. JavaOS JavaOS is an operating system with a Java virtual machine as a fundamental component. It is developed by Sun Microsystems . Unlike Windows, Mac OS, Unix or Unix-like systems which are primarily written in the C programming language , JavaOS is primarily written in Java . As of 2006, Sun considers JavaOS a legacy system .\n\n23. Design of java os The system is based on a hardware architecture native microkernel . The Java virtual machine runs on top of the microkernel. Platforms that the kernel runs on include: ARM PowerPC SPARC StrongARM x86 All device drivers are written in Java and executed by the virtual machine. A graphics and windowing system, implementing the AWT API is also written in Java.\n\n24. JNode JNode (Java New Operating System Design Effort) is an open-source project to create a Java platform operating system . The project has taken the unique direction of creating all the software in Java itself, with the exception of some assembly language to boot and load the system. The JVM compiler (which normally uses just-in-time compilation ) is used to build native binaries out of the core Java code. In this way, nearly the entire system is capable of being written in the Java programming language .\n\n25. Jx Java JX is a Java operating system that focuses on a flexible and robust operating system architecture. The JX system architecture consists of a set of Java components executing on the JX core that is responsible for system initialization, CPU context switching and low-level domain management. The Java code is organized in components which are loaded into domains, verified, and translated to native code.\n\n26. KERNAL The KERNAL is Commodore 's name for the ROM -resident operating system core in its 8-bit home computers ; from the original PET of 1977, via the extended, but strongly related, versions used in its successors; the VIC-20 , Commodore 64 , Plus/4 , C16 , and C128 . The Commodore 8-bit machines' KERNAL consisted of the low-level, close-to-the-hardware, OS routines (in contrast to the BASIC interpreter routines, also located in ROM), and was user callable via a jump table whose central (oldest) part, for reasons of backwards compatibility, remained largely identical throughout the whole 8-bit series. The KERNAL ROM occupies the last 8 KiB of the 8-bit CPU's 64 KiB address space ($E000-$FFFF).\n\n27. Merlin operating system Merlin Open Systems specialises in electronic publishing software solutions , and is a leading developer of sophisticated Adobe Acrobat plug-ins and stand-alone PDF processing applications.

Novell Netware NetWare is a network operating system developed by Novell, Inc. It initially used cooperative multitasking to run various services on a PC , and the network protocols were based on the archetypal Xerox Network Services stack . NetWare has been superseded by Open Enterprise Server (OES). The latest version of NetWare is v6.5 Support Pack 8, which is identical to OES 2 SP1, NetWare Kernel.\n\n32. Oberon (operating system) Oberon is an operating system , originally developed as part of the NS32032 -based Ceres workstation project; it is written entirely in the Oberon programming language . The basic system was designed and implemented by a team of two part-time programmers at ETH Zürich (ETHZ), Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht. It was later extended and ported to other hardware by a team at ETHZ. For a full listing of team members, see ETH Oberon Hall of Fame\n\n33. OSD/XC Munich 13 March 2002 Fujitsu Siemens Computers (FSC) announced at CeBIT, Hannover, that it ported its proprietary mainframe operating system BS2000/OSD from /390 CMOS processors to its own SPARC processors. The SX130 is the first system of the new SX-series. It can run BS2000/OSD and Solaris in parallel in different hardware partitions. This allows a fibre channel connection on a mainframe and the usage of all the Solaris application software .\n\n34. OS-IV OSIV is a program written to perform cross-correlation analysis of particle image velocimetry (PIV) images. The program was designed to be both very modular and quite efficient. It incorporates most of the tried-and-true algorithms and some of the more recent additions to the PIV toolkit. Importantly, OSIV is released open source so that users may contribute back to the project.\n\n35. Pick operating system The Pick operating system (often called just &quot;the Pick system&quot; or simply &quot;Pick&quot;) is a demand-paged , multiuser, virtual memory , time-sharing operating system based around a unique &quot;multivalued&quot; database . It is used primarily for business data processing . Although it started on a variety of minicomputers , the system and various implementations eventually spread to a large variety of microcomputers and mainframe computers , and is still in use today\n\n36. PRIMOS PRIMOS was an operating system developed during the 1970s by Prime Computer for its minicomputer systems. It rapidly gained popularity and by the mid-1980s was a serious contender as a mainline minicomputer operating system. With the advent of PCs and the decline of the minicomputer industry Prime was forced out of the market in the early 1990s.\n\n37. Sinclair QDOS QDOS (sometimes written as Qdos in official literature; the name is not regarded as an acronym ; also see the identically-pronounced word kudos ) was the multitasking operating system found on the Sinclair QL personal computer and its clones. It was designed by Tony Tebby whilst working at Sinclair Research , as an in-house alternative to another, later cancelled, operating system commissioned from GST Computer Systems .\n\n38. Versions qdos The following version of QDOS were released: 0.08 : the last pre-production version. 1.00 : corresponded to the FB version QL ROMs, released in April 1984. 1.01 : corresponded to the PM version ROMs. This was faster and had improved Microdrive support. 1.02 : corresponded to the AH ROM version released in June 1984. This fixed many bugs and was the first ROM version to be produced in quantity. 1.03 : included in ROM versions JM and TB ; a minor bug-fix release issued in late 1984. 1.10 : corresponded to the JS and JSU ( US export version) ROMs, released in early 1985. This was the last version used in QLs manufactured for the UK market. 1.13 : corresponding to the MG x series of ROM versions for European export markets. Included a significant number of bug fixes.\n\n39. SSB-DOS SSB was tasked in 2001 to support the data management, data warehousing, data migration, and data conversion activities on the Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS). ILMS involved the design and development of a world-wide logistics system to support the Department of State (DoS), Office of Logistics Management. The ILMS will replace several existing stovepipe systems being used to manage all the different logistics activities required by the DoS. ILMS is primarily an integration effort - integrating Ariba, Procurement Desktop, Manugistics’ Transportation module and several PeopleSoft modules to manage the logistics functions required by the State Department. An SSB data team was responsible for the initial identification and resolution of all data issues associated with the effort. SSB identified the existing State Department systems to be replaced by ILMS and initiated the data mappings and data conversion routines required to transfer the data from the old systems to the new ILMS\n\n40. SymbOS SymbOS is a free multitasking operating system for Z80 -based 8-bit computer systems. At present it is available for the Amstrad CPC series of computers, as well as for all MSX models starting from the MSX2 standard and for most Amstrad PCW models. Contrary to early 8-bit operating systems it is based on a small kernel, which provides pre-emptive and priority oriented multitasking and manages RAM with a size of up to 1024 kB. SymbOS contains a Microsoft Windows like Graphical user interface , supports hard disks with a capacity of up to 128 GB and can already be booted on an unexpanded Amstrad CPC -6128, a 128K- MSX 2 and an Amstrad PCW\n\n41. Symobi Symobi (System for mobile applications) is a modern and mobile real-time operating system .

Work on a Motorola 68000 version started in 1981 at Bath University . MetaComCo acquired the rights to the 68000 version and continued development until TRIPOS was chosen by Commodore Amiga in March 1985 to form part of an operating system for their new computer.\n\n43. UCSD P-SYSTEM was a portable, highly machine-independent operating system . The University of California, San Diego Institute for Information Systems developed it in 1978 to provide students with a common operating system that could run on any of the then available microcomputers as well as campus DEC PDP-11 minicomputers . UCSD p-System (Version IV, supplied by SofTech) was one of three operating systems (along with PC-DOS and CP/M-86 ) that IBM offered for its original IBM PC ; but the p-System never sold very well for the IBM PC, mainly because of a lack of applications and because it was more expensive than the other choices. Before that, IBM used the UCSD p-System as the operating system for its Displaywriter , a microcomputer -based dedicated word processing machine (not to be confused with IBM's DisplayWrite word processing software).\n\n44. UMIX Umix is a program for adjusting soundcard volumes and other features in soundcard mixers.

Miraculix Miraculix is 32-bit operating system originated from Russia .\n\n54. HISTORY The first version of this system was published in 2003, and named &quot;UCS&quot; (United Control System). Created using a C++ -like language, UCS had its own file system and provided interaction through a single-user console. In 2004, the second edition of Miraculix was prepared, written entirely in assembly language . A prototype GUI and multitasking support was include in the kernel , but this edition was never completed. In 2005, a new, third version Miraculix was released. This version had a working GUI , set the required drivers for a lot of hardware and have protection processes using a method of separation and page memory was also present. July 14, 2006 there was released version 0.55b, and August 10 , 2006 with several elaboration, the new version 0.56. became available. However,despite developments of the GUI, it was not a full system. It have only the following programs: the task bar (with a menu launch), run, review files, simple console and a few demo. It was also possible to launch some programs for MenuetOS . And the simplest text editor wasn't so simple... March 25, 2007 came out the next version - 0.71, which was reworked GUI, and added a revised management console. Indeed processing in more been higher degree of desktop - now on blue background emerged icons"
