        "text": "posted 08-18-2004 11:31 AM While checking and sorting over some of my space files, I thought it would be fun to highlight some interesting and probably not too-well known historical aspects of this nation's first manned space attempt.\n\nThe first astronaut crew quarters, actually, was Room S205. It was on the second floor of Hangar S, on the south side of the building, located in the heart of Cape Canaveral's industrial area, which I have visited many times before, what is now referred to as the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\nHere is what America's first astronaut himself, Al Shepard, said about S205;\n\nThe air-conditioned room, about 20x30' in size, is furnished with two double-deck bunks, two beige-colored nylon couches, a reclining chair, magazine racks, a desk and chair, radio, TV and a clock.\n\nAt that time during the Project Mercury era, however, other rooms adjoined as part of the crew quarters' suites. The next room down the corridor was for inter-office conferences. Next to that facility was the pressure-suit fitting room and next to that was the aeromedical room, where doctors such as Bill Douglas kept their charts, thermometers, and other required medical equipment on hand.\n\nThe rooms were decorated by Dee O'Hara, at that time, an Air Force Lieutenant nurse assigned to work for the Mercury astronaut team at Langley and later at the Cape.\n\nHangar S is still a working-facility on the Cape, but of course, no longer houses astronaut crew support functions as it once did when Americans first pioneered into the heavens. Hangar S, by my definition, will always be remembered as a special place in Project Mercury history. Even the Mercury spacecrafts were checked and tested in the same hangar facility before their launch into space.\n\nposted 08-19-2004 01:41 AM\n\nquote: Originally posted by Steven Kaplan:\n\nWhere was crew quarters during Gemini?\n\nI believe the crew quarters in the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building were in use from Gemini-3 or 4 onwards. I know for sure that Gemini-6 and 7 used it.\n\nLook at the photos of the pre-flight breakfast of these missions and you'll recognize the room (and the curtains, which hung there until the 1980s!).\n\nI have seen a NASA-photo of the layout of the crew quarters, which was published around 1965.\n\n(Anecdote I heard from a NASA escort while touring KSC in 1981: After manned flights ended with Apollo-Soyuz the \"Manned\" was dropped from the name Manned Spacecraft Operations Building (MSOB). Because the acronym would be SOB they changed it to Operations and Checkout Building. Not sure if this is true.)\n\nposted 08-19-2004 09:01 AM In Jan. 1963 construction started on a new multi-storied structure of approx. 17,200 square meters at KSC's new industrial area, projected to last about 5 years before full completion. That was the Manned Spacecraft Operations (MSO) Building, now referred as the Operations & Checkout (O&C) facility.\n\nA new astronaut crew quarters was located on the 4th floor âÂ and still is there for the shuttle crewsÂ âÂ that contains a complete living quarters for the crews (prime and backup during the Geminis and Apollos).\n\nThe astronauts live in a maze of about 20 rooms that includes three apartment complexes with three beds each, a gymnasium, lounge, kitchen, tech-briefing area, dinning room, a small medical clinic, bathrooms, a laundry area and even a sauna room. The first astronauts to use the new quarters prior to an assigned flight was the GT-3 crew of Grissom, Young, and backups Schirra and Stafford.\n\nThe new living quarters, about 3 miles from the old Hangar S, where the Mercury astronauts stayed, was relocated over to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island side, for better convenience and other requirements. Once the crew left their living quarters, about three hours before a planned liftoff, Gemini astronauts would take a 5 mile drive to the Gemini Crew Ready Room, a trailer complex at Pad 16, which is the nearest launch pad south of Gemini Launch Complex 19, where the crew took off from. That was a short quarter-of-a-mile ride in a truck-like air-conditioned van.\n\nIt was at Pad 16 where the Gemini \"twins\" would suit up in preparation for their launch, but with no crew quarters accommodations. Pad 16, on the other hand, was first used to test fly the Army's new Pershing weapon systems that first flew in 1960.\n\nEarly on, NASA planners had wanted the O&C building to house all the astronaut flight crew training simulators and related equipment as part of the astronaut facilities there, but in early 1964 it was decided to construct a separate building for crew training activities (similar to their training facility at the now-Johnson Space Center in Houston).\n\nposted 01-29-2007 02:22 AM Ken, thanks for posting the crews quarters floor plan in the MSOB. I gave my copy to the diretor, Eric Borg if I remember correctly) of the \"From the Earth to the Moon\" TV series. I was a technical advisor while working out of Ron Howard's Hollywood office and later on the set at Disney World. I never got my copy back.\n\nI completely furnished the quarters at Gus's request including the kitchen, linens. pictures, furniture, from top to bottom with the exception of the gym equipment...\n\nIf you read \"First on the Moon\", there is a story about it.\n\nWhile this was being done, the astronaut office was located down the hall through the double doors. (The receptionist desk was never used).\n\nWhere the corridor going into Apartment 3 (which was never designated as such) there was a door that opened up to the astronaut offices, which is still there today. That is where we relocated as soon as all furnishings that I ordered were delivered and everything in place.\n\nPan Am supplied two maids and a cook. That was our staffing there. I was in and out constantly arranging luncheons for the crews' guests and other various functions. My duties were so varied. I think I may have typed two short memos during my years there. They had their secretaries in JSC taking care of all that. The quarters and the offices were a secured area. Keys were assigned to the crews by me.\n\nI no longer have a rendering of the offices and if you do, please share it with me. I can draw one by heart but my lines would not be straight.\n\nI'm amazed as I write my book that so much info is available on this great site and helps with my memory and research. Kris mentioned that Cs would be a good site to be active in for those reasons. However, it is now more than that as I am renewing friendships with some of the other old timers from Mercury, Gemini and Apollo and making new friends.\n\nposted 06-26-2018 04:09 AM Does anyone why there were two sets of bunk beds in the Astronaut Crew Quarters in Hanger S?\n\nDuring the Mercury era, there was only a pilot and a back-up pilot. So there really should have only been two beds.\n\nDuring the Gemini era which had two-man prime and back-up crews, you might have had four men staying in the crew quarters. In which case, two sets of bunk beds would make sense.\n\nDoes anyone know what was done during the Apollo era where there were 6 men that presumably needed to stay in the crew quarters? Were there two rooms designated for the astronauts? One for the prime crew and one for the back-up crew?\n\nAlso, the MSOB opened up in 1964, and the Astronaut Crew Quarters was moved from Hanger S to the MSOB. If anyone has a picture of what that new room looked like, that would be great to see.\n\nposted 06-27-2018 12:43 AM Thank you Jim for the video and yes, Gemini astronauts used the new crew quarters in MSOB starting in 1964.\n\nStill there is the question of why there were two sets of bunk beds in the Hanger S crew quarters when only two beds were needed. I suspect the the Mercury prime pilot slept in bunk bed number 1 and therefore had the choice of sleeping on the upper or lower bunk and that the back-up pilot slept in bunk bed number 2 and had the choice of using the upper or lower bunk.\n\nAnd here is an open question â does anyone know how many beds were made available the the new crew quarters in the MSOB during the Gemini era?"
