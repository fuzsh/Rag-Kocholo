        "text": "What is Project Mercury?\n\nIt is an open collaboration among stakeholders from across the globe coming together to overcome the challenges that could slow or prevent effective therapies from getting to patients everywhere. This collaboration takes place at the global level through a Global Task Force and at the local level, through Country Working Groups. The Task Force and the Working Groups are all led by patient advocacy organizations of the World FSHD Alliance. This global-local approach ensures customization of Project Mercury’s work at the local level while sharing resources at the global level.\n\nProject Mercury Goals\n\nBy 2025, Project Mercury aims to build a global cohort of 10,000 clinical-trial-ready, well-characterized patients; expand and optimize the world-wide clinical trial infrastructure; and remove the barriers that delay patient access to therapies once approved.\n\nThe FSHD Society’s Role in Project Mercury"
