A film roll is seen being scanned as a news commentator's voice is heard describing the feat. It is October 1959, three months after the failure of NASA's Mercury-Atlas 1 launch.\n\nGordon Cooper (Colin O'Donoghue) is seated in a Mercury spacecraft simulator with Deke Slayton (Micah Stock) serving as his capsule communicator, or capcom. \"Trajectory off-nominal. Engine performance low,\" Slayton says, as a string of red lights begin to flash on his console accompanied by the buzz of an alarm. \"Abort.\"\n\n\"Roger, activating abort handle,\" replies Cooper, but he cannot get the handle to move. The simulation ends. Slayton wants to know \"why the hell didn't you abort?\"\n\n\"I tried!\" says Cooper, ripping the abort handle out of the simulator and handing it to Slayton. \"It's not like we're actually flying this damn thing.\"\n\nEpisode 104 \"Advent\" clip.
