The capsules used in the manned flights had barely enough room to fit one person in it (42). The first American astronaut in space was Commander Alan B. Shepard of the United States Navy, and he rode the Mercury-Redstone 3 into sub orbit on May 5, 1961 (Spangeburg and Moser 52). Alan Shepard was the first Human being ever to have complete control over his own space shuttle (Spangeburg and Moser 68).

According to the NASA website, the astronauts immediately began training for their mission at Langley (NASA). Their training “included a \"little of everything\" ranging from a graduate-level course in introductory space science to simulator training and scuba-diving” (NASA). While all the astronauts were given different jobs, Cooper’s was to deal with the Redstone rocket,…\n\nThe chemical Mercury, symbolized as Hg, is an element most prominently found as a solid metal throughout Earth’s surface. It is a naturally occurring element found in Earth’s soil, water and air.

Mercury is known to be very poisonous to humans and affects many organisms ranging from…\n\nregistered under its trade name Merthiolate and sold as a huge antibacterial, antifungal product to many stores and markets for pharmaceutical needs. Thimerosal which is a compound substance is used as preservation in vaccines for a long time. A vaccine containing thimerosal has “50 micrograms of thimerosal per 0.5 mL dose.” Say the FDA of U.S food and Drug administration. And this preservation prevents the invasion if bacteria and blocks any contamination. However it contains 49.6% mercury…\n\nRay Bradbury’s story, “All Summer in a Day,” takes place on the planet Venus, where it rains heavily all the time.

One lesson that this story suggests is that if you get caught up in your own jealousy, you can end up hurting others. In the…\n\nObjective: • Understand the relationship of the nine planets in our solar system to the sun by creating a three-dimensional representation. • Understand the planets relative size and their distance from the sun and the earth. Preparation: Purpose: To introduce the ideas of our solar system and enrich their understanding of the world around them Materials: • Newspaper strips torn about an inch wide • String Steps: • First I would divide the students into nine groups. Then I would assign…\n\nHumans Shouldn’t waste Time and Money Visiting Mars There is so much data out there in this world that leads humans to want to go to other planets. Not only want to, but eventually people may need to go to other planets and there is a chance that it could become a huge part of life and a huge step up from where humans are today. A new galaxy has been discovered called TRAPPIST-1 which has seven Earth like planets, three of them suitable for life. If humans could get to this galaxy which is…\n\nhimself flying really fast. Then many many many many years later sun woke up. “What the what happened wha, what the what is this place”? The place was cold and dark. Sun didn’t see anything until he burst his bright orange lava then he saw a bunch of frozen planets! But the Sun's warmth was melting the ice. The planets cried with joy, “Free Free I'm free!
