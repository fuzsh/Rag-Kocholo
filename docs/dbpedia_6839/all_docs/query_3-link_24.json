        "text": "It wasn’t originally intended for the astronauts to be matched 1-to-1 with the flights; four additional crewed Mercury-Redstone (suborbital) and three more Mercury-Atlas (orbital) flights were planned but canceled. The additional suborbital missions were canceled to put a man in orbit sooner, and the last orbital missions were canceled as NASA shifted focus to the upcoming Project Gemini.\n\nMercury astronaut Deke Slayton was grounded for a heart condition, so it was actually somewhat coincidental that the program ended up with six flights and six available astronauts. Without the time pressure coming from the USSR’s Vostok program and Kennedy’s lunar challenge, most of the Mercury astronauts would probably have flown twice during the program."
