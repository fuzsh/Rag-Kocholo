        "text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Audie Bock's most recent publication is a translation of the Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa's memoirs, ''Something Like an Autobiography'' (Alfred A. Knopf, May 1982). By AUDIE BOCK HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE, CALIF. An imposing multiple gateway yawns open, guardless. The driveway, lined with squat, thick-crowned old palm trees, curves lazily past large blocks of buildings painted a creamy military hue. Surrounding them are overlush lawns, the recent floodgauge Northern California rains pushing their seedy tips into a waist-deep jungle. A filling station sign sports the elongated lettering that immediately recalls late 1950's graphic design. No one walks the street, and the classic Chevy Bel Aires and Studebakers one would almost expect to roll by fail to materialize.\n\nA closer look reveals that many windows are broken or boarded over, and as the outlying aircraft hangars come into view, the roads and sidewalks bear those same waist-high grasses growing up through cracks in the asphalt and concrete. Hamilton lies deserted, a ghost of the cold war, built about the time the Soviets launched the satellite that started the space race, Sputnik I, in October 1957.\n\nInside one of the abandoned hangars at the end of a weedy road, Philip Kaufman (''Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' ''The Wanderers,'' ''White Dawn'') is directing his film adaptation, for spring 1983 release, of Tom Wolfe's best-selling 1979 book, ''The Right Stuff.''\n\nThe book reveals the engrossing behind-the-scenes story of the first American astronauts and what inspired them to put their lives on the line in competition with the Soviets when ''our rockets always blow up.''\n\n''The Right Stuff,'' which Mr. Wolfe defines as ''the uncritical willingness to face danger,'' carries with it many other attributes that Mr. Kaufman seeks to portray visually. ''Tom Wolfe has an amazing talent for finding something outside of the urban centers that sparks America and defines its spirit,'' he says. '' 'The Right Stuff' is about heroes, but it's about people who don't know they're heroes. They're people who are working hard at their jobs and trying to do them right. This isn't about sport, it's about a job of life and death.''\n\nA huge replica of the first Project Mercury space capsule, somewhat resembling a giant smoker oven, lurches and creaks forward, suspended from a belt on the ceiling of the hangar. America's first seven astronauts, played by Scott Glenn (Alan Shepard), Charles Frank (Scott Carpenter), Ed Harris (John Glenn), Lance Henriksen (Wally Schirra), Scott Paulin (Deke Slayton), Dennis Quaid (Gordo Cooper) and Fred Ward (Gus Grissom), confront the first vehicle that will be propelled by a hastily modified Redstone rocket and catapult one of them into outer space in 1961. Seven German scientists, led by the San Francisco actor Scott Beach as the legendary Werner von Braun, stand aside and smilingly await their praise for the capsule design. The astronauts, all clothed in their gleaming silver pressure suits, go over the capsule, banging on it, pushing and poking it, circling around it. Instead of the expected approval, the German scientists are assailed with a barrage of demands for modifications. The astronauts have had enough of being ''lab rats'' and ''Spam in a can.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
