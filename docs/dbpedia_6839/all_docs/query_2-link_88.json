        "text": "The Mission: One of the most famous space movies ever is 1995's Apollo 13, which centers around the infamous true story of the catastrophic spacecraft malfunction that left the crew of the eponymous 1970 mission stranded in space. The movie showcases how NASA had to devise a strategy on the spot to return the crew home safely to Earth without a loss of life.\n\nWhat It Gets Right: Apollo 13 is based on the book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, written by former astronaut Jim Lovell, who was a commander aboard the spacecraft when the malfunction occurred. For this reason, it's one of the most accurate movies regarding the mission, especially when it comes to the science of space travel. Capturing the immense pressure of the circumstances, the movie accounts for the technical details of zero-G and the explosion that led to the spacecraft losing oxygen and power, which forced the mission to abort.\n\nCritical Response: The film was widely acclaimed and remains one of the most famous films about US space exploration. Rene Rodriguez from The Miami Herald wrote, “Apollo 13 captures the wonder of space travel with the wide-eyed zeal of a 10-year-old: They really were heroes, these guys, and the movie shows you why.”\n\nThe Mission: Tom Wolfe’s nonfiction book The Right Stuff was adapted into a film of the same name, which traces the origins of America’s first-ever space program, Project Mercury, and explores the personalities of the first-ever astronauts known as the Mercury Seven.\n\nWhat It Gets Right: The Right Stuff is a classic heart-thumping '80s space movie with committed performances by the actors who played the Mercury Seven. They accurately depict the daring, courage, bloodcurdling fearlessness, and bravery the first astronauts possessed to push the limits of technology and risk their lives for scientific advancements. Although the film is more concerned with selling a heroic narrative than historical accuracy, it shows audiences how the space race began with high-speed rocket aircraft testing at an Air Force base in Southern California after WWII.\n\nCritical Response: Arthur Knight of The Hollywood Reporter said, “Rarely has a film made a historic accomplishment seem so vivid and personal,\" later reflecting, \"It makes you wonder, quite suddenly, why there aren't more movies like this.”\n\nThe Mission: Hidden Figures is a masterpiece that focuses on three African-American women who were mathematicians at NASA during the space race. Katherine Goble Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) all had pivotal roles performing complex calculations for space projects during the 1960s; the film shows how they identified crucial flaws in a few of the systems that, if not found, could have led to failures and a halt to the competition. The movie is an adaptation of a nonfiction book of the same name, written by esteemed author Margot Lee Shetterly.\n\nWhat It Gets Right: Hidden Figures does an exemplary job of highlighting the adversity Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson faced because of their ethnicity, while also showcasing their talent in their roles as “human computers.” Like many films based on historical events, it does take some creative liberties. For example, the storyline of the fictional character Al Harrison trying to desegregate NASA almost singlehandedly softens the true history of racism of the time, which was not so easily solved. Hidden Figures also delays Johnson's pioneering work by about a decade to instead showcase her sharing feel-good moments with the other female mathematicians. Yet, the film gets many things right, like going to great lengths to recreate NASA’s Langley Research Center in Virginia. The creators used artifacts from the time or near-perfect replicas to re-created NASA's mission control, and the production also consulted NASA archival photos and footage alongside help from NASA historians to duplicate the events as closely as possible.\n\nCritical Response: Keith Garlington from Keith & the Movies wrote, “Hidden Figures is a polished Hollywood movie through and through, but the power and importance of its story, along with the three central performances, easily overshadow any hiccups.”\n\nThe Mission: Gagarin: First in Space is a Russian biopic centering Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet cosmonaut who was the first human to travel to space. The plot mainly focuses on his historic flight, while offering some glimpses into his youth, Air Force training, cosmonaut training, and relationships.\n\nWhat It Gets Right: This biographical drama offers a rare perspective of what the space race was like for the Soviets, which is especially illuminating for American audiences who may only be familiar with the US perspective. It offers a detailed, if somewhat biased, look into Gagarin's life and what it was like for him to be the first human to ever be in space. Most of the movie centers around a fairly accurate depiction of the historic spaceflight of the Vostok I in 1961. Unfortunately, it doesn’t give much away about the Soviet's other space race developments and advancements at the time, and some critics felt that the state-funded film was “sanitized.”\n\nCritical Response: Jennie Kermode of Eye For Film wrote that Gagarin “succeeds in generating tension that will grip even those who already know the end of the story,” adding that it serves as “an important monument to what was a crucial moment in all our history.”\n\nThe Mission: Unlike the infamous film Apollo 13, the 2019 release Apollo 11 is not a dramatic adaptation of events, but an eye-opening, straightforward documentary that presents one of the best historical accounts of the Apollo 11 mission, released 50 years after the US spacecraft landed on the moon. Although the film primarily focuses on Apollo 11, it encompasses much of the space race, with never-before-seen NASA footage and audio recordings.\n\nWhat It Gets Right: For many, Apollo 11 is the best documentary ever produced about space. It takes old original NASA archival footage and remasters it so well that viewers believe they are watching a film about space made within the last few years. Clearly breaking down each phase of the mission for viewers, Apollo 11 shows four key events in the Apollo 11 mission: lift-off, landing the lunar module on the surface of the moon, reconnecting the lunar module with the larger spacecraft, and finally returning into Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, the astronauts' journey home and recovery post-mission are touched upon. Although not much dialogue is present, the documentary does a brilliant job of showing multiple perspectives of the mission and capturing how people felt about its success.\n\nCritical Response: Apollo 11 won praise for showcasing well-known history in a new light. Sandra Hall from The Sydney Morning Herald said, “It's a film that makes history seem freshly minted - a unique work of restoration made possible by the discovery of a cache of previously unreleased audio recordings and large-format footage.”\n\nThe Mission: October Sky stars a young Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickham, a boy who gets inspired to build rockets with his friends and a reluctant teacher after learning about Sputnik - the first artificial satellite launched into space. Despite facing immense resistance from his father, Homer perseveres, hoping to obtain a better life than what his father sees for him.\n\nWhat It Gets Right: October Sky might not directly depict the people involved in the space race, but it conveys the sentiment of what it felt like to be a teenager growing up during such exciting times when monumental historical moments were occurring. By looking at the impact of the space race from a distance, it shows how the events meant so much to young Americans watching, inspiring them to work hard towards their own goals.\n\nCritical Response: This movie is often remembered as a heartwarming childhood classic for its take on a young man's dreams of rocket science. Margaret A. McGurk from The Cincinnati Enquirer states that it is “an enthralling and warm-hearted story,” going on to offer praise for the lead - ”Young Mr. Gyllenhaal in particular is terrific.\""
