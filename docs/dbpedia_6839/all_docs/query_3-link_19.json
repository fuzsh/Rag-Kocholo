        "text": "Who Were The Astronauts?\n\nIn early 1959 NASA selected seven former test pilots to be the first group of astronauts – known as the Mercury Seven! They were Malcolm Carpenter, Leroy \"Gordo\" Cooper, John Glenn, Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom, Walter \"Wally\" Schirra, Alan Shepard and Donald \"Deke\" Slayton. All but Donald Slayton would fly a Project Mercury mission.\n\nWhat Spacecraft & Rockets Were Used?\n\nThe capsule designed for the Mercury program was small and could only accommodate one astronaut who had to remain seated throughout. Each astronaut named his capsule and included the number ‘7’ in its name. It was launched on one of two different rockets (which were designed as missiles for the Military) used during the program, the Mercury-Redstone and the more powerful Atlas rocket.\n\nFacts About The Manned Mercury Spaceflights\n\nFollowing many development flights, including a few dramatic failures, NASA launched a monkey and 2 chimpanzees into space and returned them safely proving that spaceflight was safe for humans.\n\nAlan Shepard made the first manned spaceflight aboard ‘Freedom 7’ becoming the first American in space. Gus Grissom flew the second suborbital flight atop the Mercury-Redstone rocket before the advent of the more powerful Atlas rocket required to reach orbital speeds.\n\nJohn Glenn’s Atlas rocket launched his ‘Friendship 7’ into low Earth orbit on February 20 1962, becoming the second human to orbit the Earth after Yuri Gagarin. The second American to orbit Earth was astronaut Scott Carpenter who flew in the Aurora 7 capsule. Wally Schirra flew next in the Sigma 7 capsule. Gordon Cooper would fly the last Project Mercury mission, spending the longest in Earth orbit - a total of over 34 hours strapped into his Faith 7 capsule!
