        "text": "Alan Shepard should have been the first man in space\n\nTwo weeks before Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space, NASA flew a successful unmanned Mercury flight. But it could have been a manned flight; NASA was overly cautious, and Shepard eventually flew into space two weeks after Gagarin.\n\nGus Grissom almost drowned after re-entry\n\nWhen Gus Grissom splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on 21 July 1961 on the second Project Mercury flight, the explosive bolts on his hatch accidentally fired. Grissom scrambled out into the water before the spacecraft sank (it was recovered 38 years later), barely staying afloat until he was rescued.\n\n20 Mercury spacecraft were built, but only six were used for manned flights\n\nNASA tasked the McDonnell Aircraft company to build 20 separate Mercury spacecraft. Of these, six were used for manned flights (a seventh flight was cancelled), nine were used for unmanned flights (two of which were destroyed) and five never flew.\n\nThe first Mercury “astronaut” was a monkey\n\nOn 4 December 1959, a rhesus monkey called Sam became the first “astronaut” in the Mercury programme. He flew to a height of 85 kilometres (53 miles), 15 kilometres (9 miles) short of space, on a prototype spacecraft called Little Joe 2.\n\nThe astronauts insisted on having a window\n\nEarly prototype Mercury spacecraft had just two portholes, but the Mercury astronauts demanded that a larger window be installed, not only for the view but also for orientation. The latter proved invaluable on the last mission, when instrument failure required visual orientation.\n\nImage courtesy of NASA"
