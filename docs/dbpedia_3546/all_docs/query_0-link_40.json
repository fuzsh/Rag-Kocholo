Despite the extravagance of many of his claims and the seemingly interminable length of his work (hence the value of an abridgment), his Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España (True History of the Conquest of New Spain) remains the most rich and compelling version available, eclipsing even Hernán Cortés’s Cartas de relación, his famous letters to the emperor Charles V. Born in Medina del Campo in Old Castile, Bernal Díaz declared that he arrived in the New World in 1514 on Pedrarias Dávila’s voyage to Tierra Firme (Nombre de Dios in Panama) and that he participated in the first three expeditions to Mexico, which were those of Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (1517), Juan de Grijalva (1518), and Hernán Cortés (1519). Although it is doubtful that he took part in the Grijalva expedition, he participated as a foot soldier (some published editions of his work elevated him to the rank of captain) in Cortés’s initial overland march to the Aztec capital of México-Tenochtitlan in 1519. Bernal Díaz also participated in the second major offensive that resulted in the fall of that island city (the site of today’s Mexico City) in August 1521. He accompanied Cortés on the disastrous expedition to Hibueras (Honduras) in 1524–26 and spent the remainder of his life in New Spain, sustained by the labor and goods produced by the native inhabitants of the lands over which he held titles of trusteeship (encomienda) that had been granted to him by the Spanish king, Charles V. After receiving in the 1520s encomienda grants near Coatzacoalcos in Tabasco and Chiapas and losing them in the 1530s, 390 Y Rolena Adorno Bernal Díaz settled permanently in Guatemala in the 1540s after the first (1539–41) of his two trips to Spain to secure greater reward for his conquest efforts. The second trip, which either awakened or confirmed his worst forebodings about the future prospects of the encomendero class, occurred in 1550–51. He died an octogenarian in Santiago de Guatemala on February 3, 1584. Bernal Díaz began to write his Historia after his second trip back to Spain, some thirty years after the fall of the Aztec capital; in 1568 he finished a version of the work that he sent to Spain in 1575 for publication. In the meantime, he continued to work on the manuscript in his possession, augmenting it until nearly the time of his death in 1584. In addition to the recollection of his own experiences, Bernal Díaz used as his sources the published letters of Cortés (1522–26), Francisco López de Gómara’s history of the conquest of Mexico (1552), and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda’s 1540s arguments favoring war against the Indians, justifying such actions on the basis of the Indians’ perceived violation of natural law through human sacrifice, cannibalism, and sodomy. Bernal Díaz also appreciated the Mexican pictorial record. He observed that native paintings provided warfare intelligence to allies or enemies (chapters 38, 78, 110), gave historical accounts of significant battles (chapters 89, 128), mapped the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (chapter 102), and preserved native history and culture in ancient books and paintings (chapter 92). As Benjamin Keen pointed out in The Aztec Image in Western Thought (1971), Bernal Díaz and Cortés are unsurpassed among members of the conquest generation in their acknowledgment and recording of Mesoamerican cultural achievements. Bernal Díaz’s work provides a still partially untapped resource for insight into Mesoamerican culture at the time of the conquest. Why did Bernal Díaz write his history of the conquest of Mexico? There is no doubt that he sought to herald the deeds of the common soldier (especially singling out and highlighting his own efforts) to counteract the impression created in the published accounts of Cortés and Gómara that focused exclusively on Hernán Cortés. Bernal Díaz’s creation of a dialogue with the allegorical figure of Fame (chapter 210) provides the most vivid [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-13 12:34 GMT) Bernal Díaz del Castillo Y..."
