Andrews One of the most repeated arguments in the histories of the European invasion of the Americas is that it was superior technology that enabled the conquerors to prevail and subjugate most of the continent. These arguments highlight Old World technologies—especially navigation, transport, and armament—as critical to the outcome of the European invasions. Following the conquest, a vast number of technological systems were introduced into the New World, bringing about radical changes in the ecology and lifeways of its inhabitants. It is often assumed that the spread of these technologies was a simple process that spread across the colonial domains through introduction, adoption, and transformation of existing technologies. In fact, it was not a simple process, and the adoption of many technologies was much more complicated , mediated by geography, social structures and relations , commercial systems, and, most importantly, Native traditions. The chapters in this volume address how the technologies introduced to Mesoamerica from Europe, Asia, and Africa in the sixteenth century were redesigned within a radically altered biotic and demographic environment , which continued to affect subsequent sociocultural change over the next 500 years. The chapters in this volume offer a broad examination of these subjects across a wide range of time and space in Mesoamerica. The temporal range spans the entire historic period, from the Postclassic/early colonial transition to the twentieth century. The geographic range spreads from central Mexico and Veracruz, to Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Yucatán in southern Mexico, to Belize and El Salvador in Central America. Interestingly, there are no chapters on Guatemala. Half of the studies focus on areas of western Mesoamerica, and half on the Maya area of eastern Mesoamerica. There is also a good balance between highland and lowland regions. The scope of the time periods varies considerably; some studies focus on very limited time periods, such as the study of the contact period settlement of Ciudad Vieja in El Salvador, by Jeb J. Card and William R. Fowler Jr. (chapter 11), or the nineteenth and/or twentieth centuries, which include a study of the nineteenth-century sugar mill of Lamanai by Tracie Mayfield, Elizabeth Graham, and David Pendergast (chapter 9) and Héctor Hernández Álvarez’s investigation of a henequen plantation of the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Yucatán (chapter 8). Other chapters trace the evolution of technologies across centuries, such as Mario A. Castillo and Janine Gasco’s study of the impact of shifting technology on the landscape of the Soconusco coast of Chiapas (chapter 6), Rani T. Alexander and Nina Williams’s examination of the evolution of water technology in Yucatán (chapter 7), and Kathryn E. Sampeck’s history of the indigo industry of El Salvador (chapter 10). Krista L. Eschbach (chapter 4) 208 Andrews focuses on the evolution of ceramic production and consumption in Afromestizo households in central Veracruz in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Several studies examine the transitions in different types of technologies from the Postclassic period to the early colonial period. Stacie M. King and Elizabeth Konwest (chapter 5) discuss the evolution of several technologies in Oaxaca, Patricia Fournier García and Cynthia L. Otis Charlton (chapter 3) focus on ceramics, and Alejandro Pastrana Cruz, Fournier García, William J. Parry, and Otis Charlton (chapter 2) track the survival of the obsidian industry well into the colonial period; the latter two studies focus on materials from central Mexico. As Alexander notes in the introduction, the processes invoked in past explanations of the impact of new technologies in Mesoamerica include diffusion, migration , hybridization, acculturation, and transculturation. Over recent decades, archaeologists have refined their approaches to examining and analyzing these processes through a greater reliance on the methodologies of ethnohistory , oral history, and ethnoarchaeology, and theoretical models on colonialism, resistance, shifting landscapes, political economics, world systems, and early stages of globalization. Many of the chapters in this volume touch on many of these processes at different times and places in Mesoamerica and not only illustrate some of the major areas of technological evolution in historic Mesoamerica but also innovative methodologies for exploring these changes. A major theme in many of the studies is the documentation of the gradual spread and interaction of technologies , which continued long after the conquest. Three major patterns are evident: (1) the widespread continuity of Native technologies, such as ceramics and obsidian , even more so in the periphery and rural areas; (2) the adaptation of..."
