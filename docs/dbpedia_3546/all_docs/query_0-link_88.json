We invite you to learn more about Sinaloa, and how Mazatlan has played a central role in its history and development.\n\nSinaloa history before the Spanish\n\nconquest of the Americas\n\nOnly a limited amount is known of the history of the indigenous Indian tribes who were the early inhabitants of Sinaloa prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors in 1531.\n\nBecause the indigenous Amerindians in Sinaloa built largely with wood and other impermanent materials, there are precious few archaeological ruins or artifacts for historians to examine that would document their societies.\n\nWhat historians do known is that, before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors, Sinaloa was inhabited by a number of major indigenous Indian tribes including the Acaxee, Cáhita, Pacaxee, Tahue, Totorame and Xixime. Historians are certain that these indigenous Indian tribes were not nomadic -- they lived in fixed settlements that were scattered throughout the hills and valleys of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains that run north-south along the spine of modern Sinaloa.\n\nHistorians believe that the populations we refer to as Cáhita consisted of 18 tribes whose languages were closely related.\n\nThere is also a general historical consensus that many of these pre-colonial Indian groups -- with the notable exception of the Cáhita, fierce warriors who practiced human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism -- were hunter-gatherers who appeared, at least generally, to be at peace with their neighbors prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors.\n\nWhile the Cáhita left precious few archaeological artifacts, they gave Sinaloa its name -- the word Sinaloa means \"rounded Pitaya\", a fruit native to Sinaloa, in the Cáhita language.\n\nHistory also records that one of their tribes, the Yaqui, also proved to be a thorn in the side of the Spanish -- and later Mexican -- authorities for nearly 400 years.\n\nSpanish Conquistadors invade Mexico in 1519 and the Aztec Empire falls in 1521\n\n16th Century / 1500s Sinaloa History\n\nFor the indigenous Indians living in what would become the State of Sinaloa, the first twenty years of the 1500s was a halcyon period of history where the darkening storm of the Spanish colonization of Mexico was unimaginable.\n\nTo the tiny degree that Spaniards -- or other Europeans -- had visited Sinaloa, it was an infinitesimal number of explorers who posed no direct threat to tribes, and had virtually no impact on Indian communities.\n\nBut the information that these early explorers reported back when they returned to more connected parts of the Spanish Empire in the Americas would ignite interest in Mexico that would prove devastating for Indian populations throughout Mexico and, in Sinaloa, within just decades would change the history of the region forever.\n\nHernán Cortez (1485 - December 2, 1547) was a Spanish Conquistador who led an expedition to the Americas that ended indigenous rule in what is now Mexico, and began 300 years of Spanish colonial rule in the Americas.\n\nA veteran of the campaigns that secured Hispaniola (now the Dominican Republic) and Cuba for the Spanish Crown, in 1519 Cortez set sail for Mexico and landed in the Yucatan Peninsula with just 500 men, little more than a dozen horses and a few cannon.\n\nHis invasion of Mexico was an act of open mutiny -- history clearly shows that his charter to conquer in the name of the Holy Roman Emperor had been revoked -- but his ambition was boundless: he set his sights on Tenochtitlán (now Mexico City), the heart of the Aztec Empire that controlled south-central Mexico.\n\nHe aimed to conquer Mexico, whether authorized to do so or not.\n\nMoving up the Gulf Coast he established a base camp at the Port of Veracruz. By mid-August 1519 he was ready to march inland and, leaving about a hundred men at Veracruz, Cortèz marched on Tenochtitlan in mid-August 1519, leading an army of 600 conquistadors, 15 horsemen and 15 cannon supported by hundreds of indigenous Indian warriors and carriers.\n\nSkilfully manipulating Indian tribes to fight against each other along the way, Cortez made a circuitous march westward, his ranks swelling as he moved inland.\n\nIn August, 1521, Cortez captured Cuauhtémoc, the ruler (\"Tlatoani\") of Tenochtitlán, and the Aztec Empire collapsed, with Cortez claiming it for Spain and renaming the Aztec capital Mexico City.\n\nCharles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, appointed Cortez as Governor, Captain General and Chief Justice of the newly conquered territory, effectively making Cortez a quasi-emperor in his own right who ruled over a territory that dwarfed Spain itself by more than an order of magnitude.\n\nPerhaps concerned that he had given Cortez too much power, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V hedged his bets by appointing several royal officials to \"assist\" him in governing what was now New Spain and, of course, to spy on him.\n\nThe Amerindian Nightmare Arrives: Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán enters northwest New Spain in 1527\n\n16th Century / 1500s Sinaloa History\n\nThe first Spanish exploration of the northwest part of Mexico -- ironically, given the presence of the spectacular natural harbors at moden-day Mazatlan and Topolobampo and the expertise of 16th century Spanish sailors -- was destined to be by land, not by sea.\n\nIn 1525 Conquistador and failed law student Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán was appointed Governor of the autonomous territory of Pánuco -- now part of modern Sinaloa. Sailing from Spain that year, he arrived in Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic) in 1526, but fell ill and did not arrive in Mexico until May, 1527.\n\nBeltrán de Guzmán immediately marched overland from the Gulf Coast to his new fiefdom near the Pacific coast in western New Spain.\n\nGuzmán's appointment to the governorship of Pánuco was opposed by Cortez supporters in Spain, but the King of Spain and his closest advisors clearly felt that Guzmán would be a useful counterweight to Hernán Cortez, whose longer-range political aspirations were suspect.\n\nGuzmán's actions in the governorship were in direct opposition to Cortez -- and those who supported him -- in the struggle for power in early colonial Mexico.\n\nGuzmán was exceptionally brutal and avaricious during his tenure as Governor of Pánuco, whether when appropriating the property of Cortez-supporters or when robbing and enslaving indigenous Indian tribes.\n\nGuzmán accused Cortez-supporters in Pánuco of being disloyal to Charles V by supporting Cortez's claim to title of Viceroy of New Spain. A number were stripped of their property, with other pro-Cortez Spaniards being tried in kangaroo courts and executed.\n\nIn turn, Bishop Juan de Zumarraga -- who had traveled with Guzmán from Hispaniola and, allegedly, shared confidences -- accused Guzmán of being having been a sworn enemy of Cortez long before he set foot in New Spain.\n\nGuzmán also seized lands from adjacent provinces, and these actions brought New Spain to the brink of civil war between Guzmán and supporters of Cortez when Governor of New Spain Alonso Estrada -- a Cortez-supporter -- sent a military expedition to reclaim land expropriated by Guzmán.\n\nIf Guzmán's tenure as Governor of Pánuco was harsh for Spaniards who supported Cortez, history clearly records that it was far more brutal for the native Amerindians.\n\nAs Governor of Pánuco, Guzmán instituted a system of wholesale slave harvesting in Pánuco province that had no historical precedent.\n\nThe start was, while barbaric, relatively modest: in 1528, during a small-scale raid along the Las Palmas River (Río de Las Palmas), he allowed every mounted Conquistador to take twenty Indian slaves, with each foot soldier authorized to capture fifteen.\n\nApparently this gesture toward his troops whetted Guzmán's appetite for slaving.\n\nIn 1529 Governor Guzmán issued a slew of slaving permissions authorizing the capture of more than 1000 Amerindians. There were, at the start, restrictions: soldiers were not allowed to sell slaves for export from New Spain except in exchange for livestock.\n\nGovernor Guzmán soon reversed his no-export policy for new slaving permits and, in just eight months, issued more than 1500 slave licenses that allowed export -- each of which permitted the capture of between 15 and 50 Amerindians.\n\nThe math on this is, obviously, ambiguous because 15 and 50 are substantially different numbers and anthropologists' estimates of the Amerindian population in the Pánuco Territory of New Spain in the 1520s and 1530's vary widely, but it is clear that Guzmán issued licenses for the enslavement of a substantial percentage of Indians within the Territory of Pánuco.\n\nNuño Beltrán de Guzmán and his Conquistadors march through Sinaloa in 1531 sowing death and destruction 16th Century / 1500s Sinaloa History\n\nPrior to 1530s the area that is modern Sinaloa State was part of a virtually unexplored part of the Spanish Empire in the New World known to history as Nueva Galacia, a massive territory totaling over 235,000 square miles which, in addition to Sinaloa, also included present-day Chihuaha, Coahuila, Durango and Sonora States.\n\nIt took a crisis in Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán's life to open the door to this region of vast mineral wealth.\n\nThe taking of slaves in New Spain was neither outlawed nor explicitly legal, but regulations issued September 19, 1528 by the King of Spain began to assert royal control over the trade, including requiring slave owners to present proof that they were authorized to take a slaves before before their faces were branded.\n\nGuzmán appeared to believe that he could authorize the taking of an effectively unlimited number of slaves, and his slaving operation in Pánuco continued to expand in 1529, with indigenous Amerindian slaves being exported wholesale to Spanish possessions in the Caribbean.\n\nThe bitter struggle between Guzmán and Cortez reached a fever pitch in 1528 - 1530 and triggered a series of events that would propel Guzmán deeper into the then largely unexplored territory that is now the State of Sinaloa.\n\nCortez had continued to campaign in the Americas throughout New Spain, including modern-day Honduras, essentially operating without authorization from his King, Charles V, who historians unanimously agree was very uneasy about Cortez's rising power.\n\nHis enemies -- including Guzmán -- caused a commissioner to be appointed to investigate Cortez' conduct in the Americas. The commisioner was granted the power to arrest him if necessary.\n\nThe primary charge was deadly serious: Cortez was accused of not rendering unto The Crown the requisite Quinto (1/5th) of the treasure he had stolen in the Americas.\n\nDuring the investigation of Cortez in 1529, Guzmán piled-on, accusing Cortez of being a rebel and a traitor.\n\nCortez sailed for Spain, intent on pleading his case directly to Charles V, and the strategy worked.\n\nPresenting himself to the Holy Roman Emperor and his court, Cortez convinced Charles V that he had not shorted the Spanish Crown but, in fact, had delivered more than a Quinto in treasure -- as well as having spent massive amounts of his personal funds to rebuild Tenochtitlán, which had been badly damaged during the siege and battles that caused the Aztec Empire to collapse.\n\nCharles V decorated Cortez with the Order of Santiago and made him the Marquis of the Oaxaca Valley (Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca), one of the wealthiest regions in New Spain according to every historical record.\n\nWhile Cortez would eventually lose most of his wealth and become estranged from the Emperor, in 1529 - 1530 his stock was very high within the royal court -- which was very bad news for Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán.\n\nBy the end of 1529 Guzmán was hated not only by Cortez, personally, but by a large number of powerful Spaniards both in Spain and New Spain who supported Cortez, and the Crown began a formal investigation into his slaving operation in Pánuco.\n\nWhen Guzmán learned that Cortez was planning to return to New Spain in 1530 he decided to get out of Pánuco -- rapidly -- but he dreamed of much more than flight.\n\nGuzmán dreamed that victory and vindication could be wrested from the jaws of defeat and disgrace.\n\nGuzmán reasoned that Cortez, despite his insubordination, owed his popularity at the royal court to his having won a new kingdom for Charles V and delivering him substantial treasure. He imagined that he, too, could atone for past offenses by finding new sources of wealth in New Spain -- and he had an idea where to find it.\n\nGuzmán was very knowledgeable about the information that explorers had amassed about the geography and people of the northwest part of New Spain and what is now Sinaloa, and there is some historical evidence that he had considered an expedition to the north even before he became so widely reviled.\n\nSome historians also believe that thought he had unique information: an Indian in his service from north of Punuco whose father had visited far north-western Mexico allegedly told Guzmán that the father had spoken of rich and populous towns and natives adorned with gold and silver.\n\nHe had also been privy to testimony given at the trial of Cortez for the murder of Monteczuma II, and had become familiar with the history of the strategic plans Cortez had communicated to others, and how Cortez envisioned the conquest of the northwest part of New Spain.\n\nGuzmán decided to make those plans his own, and to take advantage of the fact that Cortez was absent from New Spain to reap the resulting benefits for himself.\n\nIn 1529 Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán began his march from Panuco up the Pacific coast leading an army comprised of just 300 Conquistadors that were supported by 10,000 Aztec, Tarascan and Tlaxcalan Indian mercenary fighters that had been recruited in south-central Mexico.\n\nHistorians universally agree that Guzmán was remarkably rapacious and cruel on his marches of 1529 - 1531 -- even when compared to other Conquistadors.\n\nMap of Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán marches across Mexico, 1529 - 1531\n\nBefore arriving in Sinaloa, Guzmán's Conquistador army had marched west and then north from the site of modern-day Mexico City -- at that time Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire that had been conquered by Hernán Cortez in 1521 -- and rampaged through what are now Michoacán, Jalisco, Zacatecas and Nayarit states, slaughtering indigenous Indians, sacking their villages and taking slaves all along the way.\n\nIn American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World the historian David Stannard succinctly describes the history of the entire campaign as a \"genocidal enterprise\".\n\nHistorian Peter Gerhard agrees that Guzmán's Spaniards and their Indian allies were exceptionally brutal, observing in The North Frontier of New Spain that Guzmán's army \"engaged in wholesale slaughter and enslavement\" during their epic march west through central Mexico to the the Sea of Cortez and north along the Pacific coast.\n\nGuzman paused at Aztatlan, on the River Acaponeta in what is now northern Nayarit State, in December 1530, his army suffering terribly from tropical diseases and a shortage of food. It is said that he almost aborted his march, but but instead decided to send runners back to Michoacan for supplies and more Indians to fill the places of the thousands that had perished.\n\nIn early 1531 Guzmán's army entered what is now modern Sinaloa from the south and the nightmare for the indigenous Indians began.\n\nThe history of the behavior of Guzmán's Conquistadors in Michoacán, Jalisco, Zacatecas and Nayarit foreshadowed what would happen in Sinaloa.\n\nThe group of Indian tribes that spoke the Cáhita language would bear the brunt of the Spaniards brutality in Sinaloa.\n\nThe Cáhita inhabited the northwest coast of Mexico along the lower courses of the Sinaloa, Fuerte, Mayo, and Yaqui rivers, with their villages located largely in what are now the states of Sonora and Sinaloa.\n\nHistorically, Cáhita speakers were the largest indigenous group in northwestern Mexico in the 1500s, with the population of their society estimated to have been as many as 115,000 at that time.\n\nThe Cáhita were fearsome warriors, and were not going to be subjugated without a fight, but the inexorable tide of history was against them.\n\nThe Spanish Conquistadors simply had overwhelming military advantages over the native peoples of the Americas.\n\nSpain -- like much of the rest of Europe as it approached the dawning of The Age of Enlightenment -- was more militarily advanced, having developed superior war-fighting tools and technologies like firearms and artillery. Spanish Conquistadors wore armor made of steel that largely made Indian bows and arrows ineffective, and the Conquistadors arrived in New Spain equipped with domesticated war horses to ride and mules to carry their supplies in -- and the spoils of war out.\n\nThe indigenous Amerindian tribes usually had substantial numerical superiority -- and clearly superior knowledge of the local terrain at any given battle -- but these military advantages could not counter the weight of Spanish war-making technology and the war fighting experience that the Spaniards had gained in countless conflicts within Europe and elsewhere within the Empire of Spain.\n\nThe result in Sinaloa was no different than what Cortez achieved battling the Aztecs and other tribes in southern Mexico: when Beltrán de Guzmán and his battle-tested conquistador army reached the location of modern Culiacán in 1531 they engaged, defeated and slaughtered a force of 30,000 Cáhita warriors almost overnight.\n\nGuzmán decided to leave a small garrison at the site of the battle, founding San Miguel de Culiacán on September 29, 1531.\n\nThe Cáhita defeat at Culiacán suspended, briefly, Cáhita resistance to the Spanish invasion, but the battle also marks the start of what history has come to know as the Yaqui Wars, an epic struggle for control of northwest Mexico between Spaniards -- and later post-colonial Mexicans -- that lasted until 1929, or nearly 400 years!\n\nAfter the victory Guzmán established a Spanish and allied-Indian garrison at Culiacán (formally San Miguel de Culiacán) and seemingly intended to stay there and explore north, but measles and smallpox decimated his troops and spoiled his plans for further conquest.\n\nGuzmán and most of his army rapidly withdrew south from Culiacán as a result of disease, but the Cáhita and other indigenous Indian tribes suffered far worse from the European strains of the diseases the Spaniards had brought to Sinaloa -- even after their withdrawal.\n\nHistory records that within a decade of the appearance of Guzmán's army in Sinaloa, the indigenous Indians -- who, like all New World people, had never been exposed to the strains of the diseases the Spanish brought from Europe, especially measles and smallpox -- suffered devastating depopulation of their villages. Historians estimate that as many as 130,000 indigenous Indians died in northern Sinaloa during the measles pandemic of 1531-1534 and the smallpox pandemic of 1535-1536.\n\nDespite the withdrawal to the south, Guzmán's Conquistadors and their Indian allies had clearly won the first round of the fight for control of the Sinaloan part of the west coast of Mexico, and the first capital of the Spanish Colonial Province of Nueva Vizcaya was established as Villa de San Sebastián, the beautiful Rural Sinaloa town which we now know as Concordia (GPS N23°17'18\" W106°04'03\").\n\n1531 also saw the founding of Navolato, now the 4th largest municipality in Sinaloa and a very important agricultural center, not only for Sinaloa, but for all of Mexico.\n\n1500s Spanish adventurer-explorers find\n\nmineral riches in Sinaloa 16th Century / 1500s Sinaloa History\n\nWhatever role the goal of spreading the Catholic faith played in the various conquests of the Spanish Empire -- and it was certainly central for the earliest Jesuit missionaries -- most modern historians believe that the primary motive for the Spanish Crown and most Conquistadors exploring the Americas was purely economic: the government of Spain wanted to exploit the resources of territories it had claimed, and individual Spanish adventurers wanted to accumulate wealth for themselves.\n\nThe area that is now Sinaloa State was rapidly found to be rich in natural resources of many types, but the earliest, strongest, draws were gold and more importantly -- because of quantity -- silver, a precious metal that was second only to gold as the international currency of rapidly globalizing 1500s trade and national commerce.\n\nSoon it became common knowledge in Spain that silver and other precious metals were plentiful in Sinaloa, and by the mid 1560's Spaniards began arriving in force to mine them.\n\nThe most important of the early Spanish adventurers to impact the history and future of what would become Sinaloa State was Francisco de Ibarra, a Spanish explorer of Basque descent.\n\nBorn in Eibar, Gipuzkoa, Spain around 1534, Ibarra sailed for Mexico at the urging -- and with the financing -- of his uncle, conquistador and wealthy Spanish-Basque mine owner Diego de Ibarra.\n\nIn 1564 -- after conquering the area that is now the Mexican state of Durango and founding the city of the same name -- Ibarra headed further west across the enormously rugged Sierra Madre Occidental mountains chasing rumors of rich mineral deposits in what is now Sinaloa State.\n\nOne of his stops was at the present-day location of the town of El Fuerte (GPS N26°42'15\" W108°61'98\"), which he founded in 1564.\n\nFor nearly three centuries thereafter El Fuerte was one of the most important commercial and agricultural centers anywhere within the sprawling northwestern region of Mexico, and the most important trading post in early Sinaloa history for miners from the Batopilas and Urique mines in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains to the east in what is now Chihuahua State.\n\nPart of his route basically followed the path of the modern Mexican Federal Highway 40 / 40D between Durango and Mazatlan and, en route, he struck pay-dirt.\n\nNear the present-day Rural Sinaloa towns of Panuco (GPS N23°06'97\" W105°84'16\") and Copala (GPS N23°23'41\" W105°55'57\" ) -- both of which he founded -- Ibarra discovered rich veins of silver that were heavily mined for hundreds of years and that still yield ore to this day!\n\nIbarra named Copala after the mythical \"Golden City\" which he had been searching for his entire time in Mexico.\n\nBy the 1570's Francisco de Ibarra had become a very wealthy and very well known man, and was appointed the first Governor of the Spanish territory of Nueva Vizcaya.\n\nHe died in Panuco on June 3rd, 1575. At the time of his death, Ibarra was probably only 41 years old.\n\nEnglish privateer Thomas Cavendish seizes the Spanish galleon Santa Ana after hiding at Mazatlán\n\nin 1588 16th Century / 1500s Sinaloa History\n\nIn the late 1580s Spain and England were at war, and often granted charters to privateers -- essentially licensed pirates -- to raid each others possessions in the New World.\n\nTwentyseven year old English privateer Sir Thomas Cavendish thought he could use Mazatlan harbor as a staging point to operate in the waters between Sinaloa and Baja to capture the Manila Galleon Santa Ana as she was returning from the Philippines.\n\nManila Galleons were Spanish cargo vessels that sailed between ports on the western coast of New Spain to Manila in the Spanish East Indies, now the Philippines. They would carry silver mined in Peru and Mexico which was traded for spices, silk, gold and other high-value merchandise.\n\nKnown to history as \"The Navigator\", Cavendish was trying to repeat the successes of Sir Francis Drake, who raided and pillaged Spanish towns and ships in the Pacific on his circumnavigation of the globe in 1578.\n\nThe Santa Ana was a large ship weighing over 600 tons manned by 100 sailors and carrying passengers, including women, under the command of Captain Tomás de Alzola. For her ill-fated voyage of 1587 she lacked cannon because on her previous trip the Spanish authorities in Acapulco had decided to keep her cannon for defense of the outpost.\n\nCavendish had sailed from Portsmouth, England, with three vessels: his flagship Desire, a 120 ton warship armed with 18 cannon; the 60 ton Content armed with 10 cannon and a 40 ton supply ship, Hugh Gallant.\n\nCavendish sailed up the Sinaloa coast in September 1587 and anchored his small fleet off Deer Island to do maintenance on the ships, replenish supplies and wait for the Santa Ana -- all the while being observed by Spanish horsemen from the villa of San Sebastian de Chametla.\n\nRepaired and re-stocked, Cavendish made the short voyage across the Sea of Cortez to Cabo San Lucas and on Nov 4, 1587, spotted and ran down the Santa Ana after a several hour chase.\n\nHistory records that fierce hand-to-hand combat erupted when marines from the Desire attempted to board the Santa Ana, but the initial attack was repulsed.\n\nThe Desire then began firing her cannon and rammed the Santa Ana, with some shells piercing her hull below the waterline, and English sailors boarded the ship once more.\n\nOnly a few sailors died in the fighting, but Captain Alzola knew that the Santa Ana was sinking and surrendered.\n\nThe haul was staggering and, because the Santa Ana was so much larger that Cavendish's boats, the English had to pick and choose what they would steal.\n\nEstimates vary, but many historians put the loss to Spain at between 500,000 to 800,000 pesos, and all agree that it was the largest loss suffered by a galleon during the over two hundred year history of Acapulco - Manila trade.\n\nCavendish burned the Santa Ana and left her crew and passengers in Cabo with some supplies. The survivors managed to re-float the wrecked ship and limped across the Sea of Cortez to the Sinaloa coast and then south to Acapulco.\n\nCavendish sailed across the Pacific, returning to England in 1588 a wealthy hero and a permanent fixture in English maritime history.\n\nWord of his exploits spread and Pirates worldwide took note: the harbor at Mazatlan was a great place to hide if you wanted to ply your trade in the Sea of Cortez.\n\nJesuit Missionaries enter Sinaloa in the 1590s\n\n16th Century Sinaloa History\n\n1591 witnessed the entry of the first Jesuit missionaries into what is now modern Sinaloa, an invasion that proved to have an effect on the indigenous Indian tribes almost as profound as that of the arrival of the Conquistadors.\n\nThe Jesuit order -- formally The Society of Jesus -- was founded in Rome in 1540 by Ignatius of Loyola, a Spaniard of Basque origin born Íñigo López de Loyola and now known as Saint Ignatius.\n\nAfter Ignatius he was severely wounded in the Battle of Pamplona in 1521 he experienced a religious epiphany during his recovery that led him to the priesthood, and set him on a course that would affect Colonial Spain and the history of its subjects for generations.\n\nProbably as a result of Ignatius' military background, missionaries from the Jesuit order (often referred to as The Soldiers of God) were more willing than any other Catholic order to travel to far-flung and dangerous locations, live in extreme conditions, and attempt to convert often hostile indigenous populations.\n\nBy 1580 the number of Jesuits working to convert Indians in Mexico is estimated to have been as many as 1,500, and the Jesuit presence had expanded far west of their first missions in central Mexico.\n\nTwo Jesuit missionaries, Fathers Gonzalo de Tapia and Martin Pérez, entered Sinaloa in early 1591. Guided by an experienced frontiersman, Rodrigo del Rio Losa, they made their way to a location on the Rio Sinaloa river north of present-day Culiacán, set up a mission, and reached out to try to convert the nearby Indian tribes to Catholicism.\n\nThe settlement at Culiacán was at that time largely lost to history and little more than the remnant of the camp established by Nuño de Guzmán in 1531. It was effectively isolated from the burgeoning mining communities like Copala, Cosala and Panuco that were rapidly developing in what is now south-central Sinaloa.\n\nDespite the fact that in 1594 Father Tapia was killed by an Indian named Nacaveva -- an important chief and revered shaman -- new Jesuit missionaries continued to arrive and the mission grew substantially throughout the 1590's.\n\nThus began the long, complex and sometimes brutal effort to convert the Indians of Sinaloa to Catholicism, a process that, while ultimately virtually 100% successful -- whether by conversion or extermination -- would help fuel major conflict between Spaniards and indigenous people in Sinaloa for close to 300 years.\n\nThe establishment of the Jesuit mission at Culiacán in 1591 had an important consequence for the future history of the development of cities in Sinaloa.\n\nHernando de Villafañe, another Spanish Jesuit priest and missionary, was inspired and emboldened by the presence of more Spaniards and missionaries at Culiacán.\n\nIn 1594 -- just three years after Fathers Tapia and Perez founded the Culiacán mission -- Villafañe journeyed up the coast and founded a Jesuit mission at Guasave, now the 3rd largest municipality in Sinaloa with a population that is exceeded only by Culiacán and Mazatlan.\n\nMining and missionaries become engines of change and harbingers of conflict in 1600s Sinaloa\n\nAdditional significant silver deposits were discovered by Spanish adventurers elsewhere in Sinaloa in the latter 1500s, including major deposits in remaining Acaxee-controlled areas east of Culiacán in northern Sinaloa that had previously seen limited Spanish presence.\n\nEach further discovery expanded the scope and weight of Spanish rule and settler presence in Sinaloa, and increased the friction between the Spanish miners and surviving indigenous Indian populations.\n\nThe number and scale of mining operations in Sinaloa had ramped up rapidly in the late 1500s, usually with subjugated indigenous Indians working as de facto slave labor in Sinaloa mines alongside black slaves from Africa, a situation that only became more widespread over the last decades of the 1500s and early years of the 1600s as more and larger mines required more miners.\n\nThe tensions between miners and Indians and Spanish military and Indians were in many instances exacerbated by the presence of increasing numbers of Jesuit missionaries preaching conversion among the tribes.\n\nThe Acaxee Indians fight back in 1601\n\n17th Century / 1600s Sinaloa History\n\nSome indigenous Indians tribes in Sinaloa tried to fight back, notably the Acaxee who were, historically, more warlike than some of their neighbors.\n\nIn late 1601 an Acaxee Indian leader named Perico ignited a rebellion aimed at restoring indigenous social and religious practices that had been destroyed by the Spanish conquest.\n\nBlending a eclectic mixture of traditional Indian religious beliefs and myths with new-found Catholic symbols and rituals that was unique in the early history of Sinaloa, Perico convinced his followers that the Spanish could be driven from their ancestral lands by warfare.\n\nDefined by Perico's messianic leadership, the Acaxee Rebellion was the first of several attempts over the next 150 years by surviving indigenous Indian tribes in Sinaloa to throw off the yoke of New Spain and the Jesuits.\n\nAcaxee raids at the start of the rebellion in 1601 killed about fifty Spaniards in just a few weeks, with Indian raiders burning Spanish mining camps, churches and other buildings.\n\nThe Acaxee Rebellion had substantial military successes and caused the cessation of most silver mining activities on Acaxee lands in Sinaloa for nearly two years.\n\nIn 1603 the Conquistadors responded with their usual brutality. The Spanish raised an army of Indian allies -- drawn largely from other parts of Mexico -- and ruthlessly suppressed the Acaxee by burning villages, capturing and executing Perico and 48 other Indian leaders, and selling many captured Acaxee warriors into slavery.\n\nThe Conquistadors test the strength of northern Sinaloa tribes in the early 1600s 17th Century / 1600s Sinaloa History\n\nThe Acaxee Rebellion was unusually violent, but in the history of the early and middle years of the 1600s there was no shortage of causes for discord between the Spanish immigrants and indigenous Indian populations in Sinaloa.\n\nThe Spanish confrontations with the Yaqui, a Cáhita-speaking tribe, in 1609 - 1610 were one of the earlier tests of the willingness of northern Sinaloa indigenous tribes of to accept an expanded and permanent Spanish military and settler presence in northern Sinaloa.\n\nWhen the growing numbers of Conquistadors began making substantial contact with the Yaqui in 1609 - 1610 they didn't know what to expect.\n\nInhabitants of the northern coastal region of Sinaloa, the Yaqui had strongly and largely successfully resisted Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán's army in 1531, but had cordial dealings with Francisco de Ibarra in 1565.\n\nHistorians speculate the Yaqui thought, in 1565, that Ibarra might become an ally in their long-running struggles with the related Cáhita-speaking Mayo tribe.\n\nWhatever the thinking of the Yaqui's had been in 1565, the encounters in 1609 and 1610 turned out to be more of a re-run of 1531 than the Spanish had hoped for.\n\nSpanish soldiers and their Indian allies were defeated in bloody battles in both 1609 and 1610 and were forced to retreat south.\n\nJesuits succeed where Spanish military force\n\nhad failed 1600s Sinaloa History\n\nJust three years after the Spanish military defeats in the northern part of modern Sinaloa State in 1609 and 1610, the Jesuits began having successes with Cáhita-speaking Sinaloan Indian tribes where the Spanish military forces had been defeated and driven south.\n\nIn 1613 the Mayo Indians, who had been gingerly approached by particularly brave Jesuit Friars, requested and accepted Jesuit missionaries on their lands.\n\nFather Pedro Mendez established the first Jesuit mission in Mayo territory that year, and in just the first two weeks of its existence Father Mendez had baptized nearly 3,000 Mayo indians.\n\nBy 1620 -- just seven years later -- history records that 30,000 Mayo had been baptized. This effectively made the entire tribe at least nominally Catholic, and most Mayos had moved to seven mission towns that the Jesuits had created.\n\nAs the Mayo were converted to Cathlocism, the Yaqui tribal leaders took note. The Jesuit presence and message had several facets, some philosophical, some practical.\n\nThe Jesuit messages of eternal life and redemption appear to have resonated with the Yaqui in Sinaloa as did -- on a more practical level -- both the general Jesuit concern for Mayo welfare and their efforts to insulate the Mayo from exploitation by mine owners and the new Spanish colonial landlords.\n\nReaching out through Mayo intermediaries, the Yaqui's invited the Jesuits to send missionaries to their communities.\n\nThe apparently sincere Jesuit concern for the well being of the ordinary Yaqui won the confidence of the Yaqui people -- and the Yaqui apparently understood that concern for Yaqui tribal interests put the Jesuit missionaries in some peril from the civil governors of New Spain.\n\nIn seeking to protect the Yaqui from exploitation by mine owners and encomenderos, the Jesuits came into direct conflict with the Spanish political authorities because these Spanish landowners and mine owners had been granted their rights directly from the King of Spain.\n\nOver the three years from 1617 to 1619 nearly 30,000 Yaquis were baptized and by 1623 the Jesuit missionaries had concentrated the Yaqui population from about eighty rancherías -- Jesuit mission communities.\n\nThis concentration of the Yaqui into rancherías would, ironically, be the seed of future conflict because it enabled the easier exploitation of Yaqui Indian labor by encomenderos and other Spanish settlers.\n\nThe relative harmony of the early decades of the 1600s also enabled the founding of San Ignacio -- formally San Ignacio de Loyola, named after the founder of the Jesuit order -- in 1633, now a beautiful town that continues to play an important role in the life of northern Sinaloa State.\n\nMining and agriculture bring prosperity and\n\nproblems to 1600s Sinaloa 17th Century / 1600s Sinaloa History\n\nThe early 1600s saw mining operations continue to expand in Sinaloa, with a proportionate negative impact on Indian communities.\n\nBeyond mining, many Indians were forced to until, plant and harvest land that they no longer controlled under conditions that amounted to, at the least, indentured servitude and, at the worst, slavery.\n\nLike much of New Spain in the early 1600s, Sinaloa was organized into \"encomiendas\", Spanish-administrated economic zones where indigenous Indians had few rights or power, and where they were required to work for \"encomenderos\", Spaniards who had been granted the rights to farm and otherwise exploit the zone.\n\nOfficially, indigenous Indians living in encomiendas were only required to provide labor a handful of weeks per year but, in practice, they were often required to work much longer and, as historian Susan Deeds has written, \"some apparently became virtual chattels of Spanish estates.\"\n\nThe sometimes-coerced concentration of Indians into larger, denser, communities by the Jesuits, whatever the Jesuit motive, made them easier for encomenderos to exploit their labor, and many Indians resented it and came to hate the Jesuits for it.\n\nAs a result of the harsh treatment that many Indians received at the hands of Spanish immigrants, 1600s Sinaloa saw several uprisings of indigenous tribes that resulted in significant loss of life among the Spanish settlers and far greater devastation within surviving Indian communities as the Spanish inevitably delivered massive retaliation.\n\nThe Tepehuán Revolt of 1616 was particularly bloody and costly. Originating the the Sierra Madre highlands just east of the border of modern-day Sinaloa, Tepehuán Indian warriors spilled across the future border to sack a number of mining towns including Copala, which was burned to the ground.\n\nThe Tepehuán uprising had its roots in deep resentment of the cultural chages the Spaniards had wrought within Tepehuán communities, and a strong association of the Conquistadors with death, whether by warfare or disease.\n\nIt is difficult to be critical of the Tepehuán position.\n\nLife in the colonial Sinaloa mining-machine in the early 1600s was mostly -- to quote Hobbes from Leviathan -- \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\" for many native Indians that had the misfortune to interact with the Spanish.\n\nBut hidden beneath the bleak history of this dark 1600s Hobbsian struggle, a small light was emerging that would forever connect Sinaloa to the rest of the world by ship.\n\nThe Birth of Mazatlán in 1600s New Spain\n\n17th Century / 1600s Sinaloa History\n\nThe port of Mazatlan is one of the most magnificent natural harbors anywhere in the world. Deep and beautifully sheltered from storms, it is unmatched as a natural anchorage on the west coast of Mexico.\n\nBut in the early 1600s the port was little more than a often-empty natural harbor which English and French pirates used intermittently as a hiding place from which to attack the treasure-laden Spanish galleons that sailed Mexico's western coast.\n\nThe modern history of Mazatlan really begins with Spain's war on piracy: in response to pirate activity in the Sea of Cortez and points south the Spanish government established a modest military garrison at the location of present-day Mazatlan to support naval operations against the pirates.\n\nThus began a multi-generational struggle between Spanish colonial naval forces and pirates that lasted through the 1600s -- and the 1700s -- that served as a foundation for the developments that made Mazatlan the world-class port and destination community that is is today.\n\nBut 1600s and 1700s Mazatlan history wasn't primarily about pirates, it was about what they coveted: the ever-increasing tonnage of gold and silver shipments coming from nearby mines in the Sierra Madre mountains of what would become Sinaloa State.\n\nSinaloa's mountain mining communities like Concordia and Copala and the deep-digging at flatter mining locations like El Rosario were in full production mode.\n\nAs the tonnage of mineral treasure produced by these and other Sierra Madre mining towns in Sinaloa increased, hauling heavy loads east through the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains on crude trails became increasingly impractical.\n\nThe port of Mazatlan simply had to be utilized -- whatever the pirate threat.\n\nThis sea trade was the Genesis of the birth of Mazatlan and its increasingly important role in the history and economic development of Sinaloa State: ships must be serviced and re-stocked with food and water; sailors need to be on dry land and perhaps see a doctor better than the \"doctor\" on board the ship; cloths need to be replaced; men who have been at sea want female companionship.\n\nThese activities, and more, require permanent populations in ports and -- being a port on the Pacific Ocean -- Mazatlan began to draw immigrants from Asia in addition to those from Spain and other countries in Europe.\n\nAs awareness of Mazatlan spread worldwide it became the most active immigration portal in Sinaloa and enabled Sinaloa to absorb and benefit from international influences and money that reached far beyond the Spanish Empire, and that would expand the economy of Sinaloa far beyond mining.

Catholic churches in Sonora y Sinaloa were burned and Jesuit priests and Spanish settlers in what is now northern Sinaloa were forced to flee to Alamos in what is now southern Sonora State.\n\nGradually the Indians coordinated their resources.\n\nAn Indian leader named Juan Calixto formed an army of 6,000 composed primarily of Yaqui, Mayo and Pima Indians. This was one of the most potent Indian armies in the history of Sinaloa, and at one point Calixto's army held control of most of the towns and villages that spanned the Sinaloa - Sonora border along the Yaqui and Mayo rivers.\n\nAgustín de Vildósola defeats the Yaqui and restores Spanish dominance in the 1740s 18th Century / 1700s Sinaloa History\n\nThe Spanish, operating under orders from Governor of Sonora and Sinaloa Manuel Bernal de Huidobro, struck back hard and, in August 1740, forces led by Captain Agustín de Vildósola defeated Calixto's insurgent army.\n\nThe victory came at a very high price -- the uprising had cost the lives of a thousand Spaniards, more than 5,000 Yaqui Indians, and had seen the destruction of enormous amounts of Spanish mining property and Catholic church assets.\n\nThe Yaquis had demonstrated themselves to be fierce and formidable warriors and had clearly spooked the Spanish colonial administration.\n\nWhile the Yaqui rebellion in Sonora y Sinaloa of 1740 had been quashed, it actually achieved perhaps the most central of the Yaqui goals -- the heavy hand of Jesuit domination of Yaqui communities was noticeably lifted after the rebellion of 1740 by none other that the man who defeated them, Agustín de Vildósola.\n\nVildósola replaced Manuel Bernal de Huidobro as Governor of Sonora and Sinaloa in 1741 in the wake of his defeat of the Yaqui.\n\nThe war with the Yaqui had made a deep impression on Vildósola. He apparently concluded that continuing conflict with the indigenous Indians was not good for Spanish interests in Sonora y Sinaloa -- or for himself, personally.\n\nAs a result, Vildósola moved to address at least some Yaqui demands and rapidly initiated a program that posted Spanish military garrisons on Yaqui lands to assert secular government control -- and curtail the power of the Jesuit bureaucracy.\n\nAn official peace agreement was signed to codify this new arrangement.\n\nIn 1743 Vildósola -- while not reneging on other elements of the peace treaty that granted the Yaqui increased autonomy in Sinaloa -- ordered Juan Ignacio Muni, Esteban and Juan Calixto arrested.\n\nVildósola either felt a personal grudge against the leaders of the rebellion or was simply seeking to set an example for future potential Yaqui and other Indian leaders -- the historical record is unclear.\n\nWhatever Vildósola's motive, he ordered Muni, Esteban and Calixto executed by firing squad at El Presidio de San Carlos de Buenavista at the southern end of the Yaqui river.\n\nAt the time of the executions the Yaqui Wars in Mexico had gone on for 210 years -- and were barely half over.\n\nExpulsion of the Jesuits from Sinaloa in the 1760s\n\n18th Century Sinaloa History\n\nThe expulsion of the Jesuits from Sinaloa in 1767 was an important event that altered the course of Catholic missionary activities within the state, and paved the way for the Franciscan and, to a lesser degree, Dominican orders to become the primary ministers to both Spanish and Indian Catholics in Sinaloa.\n\nThe cause for the expulsion was outside Sinaloa -- and outside New Spain as well.\n\nThe consensus of modern historians is that the suppression of the Jesuit order was the result of economic and political conflicts between the Catholic Church and various European monarchies, rather than theological disputes, as earlier historians had believed.\n\nAs the 1700s in Europe progressed, resentment of the Jesuits had grown exponentially within the monarchies in Europe because both the concepts of \"civil society\" and the \"nation-state\" were relatively new, and the monarchs and associated \"royalty\" -- who were actually upstarts in the longer historical view -- were directly competing with the Catholic Church for everything from revenue from taxes and trade to the hearts and minds of the people.\n\nFairly or unfairly, the opponents of the Jesuits painted them as avaricious greedy plotters prone to use their close ties to influential members of royal courts to manipulate state policies to enrich themselves and the Vatican.\n\nThe monarchs chose to assert independence from the Catholic Church in a very harsh way. Beginning in the late 1750's, a rolling series of expulsions of Jesuits took place in Portugal, France, Sicily and in Spain on the orders of King Carlos III.\n\nThe King's order was soon extended to cover New Spain as well.\n\nIn late 1767 Gaspar de Portolá de Rovira -- a Spanish soldier who became the first Governor of Alta California, a massive Spanish colonial territory extending over 500 miles north of present-day Baja California and Sonora Mexico -- arrived in New Spain to assume his position and to deliver the bad news.\n\nThe expulsion of the Jesuits from Sinaloa was swift, with the priests and missionaries being expelled from their missions throughout New Spain at gunpoint -- and with most being deported back to Spain.\n\nThe expulsion of the Jesuits was also of substantial financial benefit to the Spanish civil authorities in Sinaloa. As it was throughout the Americas, other Spanish colonies and territories, and within Spain itself: when the Jesuits were expelled the King of Spain and the Spanish monarchy confiscated the Jesuits accumulated wealth, including substantial landholdings, warehoused agricultural surpluses and massive numbers of livestock.\n\nThe Jesuit missions in Sinaloa were turned over to Franciscan Brothers very rapidly by the King of Spain, with the \"black robes\" (as the Jesuits were commonly known) replaced by \"gray robes\" -- Fransciscans -- all in a historical blink of an eye.\n\n1700s Mazatlán continues to grow 18th Century / 1700s Sinaloa History\n\nDespite the Yaqui Wars and other challenges, Mazatlan blossomed in the 1700s.\n\nBy the end of the 1700s the pirates had been driven from Sinaloa's coasts, and while Mazatlan -- despite over 200 years of Spanish presence -- remained little more than a far-flung colonial outpost and harbor, the engines of economic change were beginning to transform our port.\n\nVirtually all of the massive amount of mining treasure produced by Sierra Madre mines in Sinaloa was flowing through Mazatlan, and through its port.\n\nThis commerce fed local wealth, and the latter part of the 1700s saw other signs of development: Mazatlan got its first church -- and first proper jail.\n\nEradicating the pirate threat had allowed Mazatlan to enter the 1800s strong and to begin to fulfill its historical destiny as Mexico's premier Pacific coast port.\n\nMexico secedes from the Spanish Empire and Sinaloa becomes a Mexican State in the 1800s\n\nThe Spanish colonial period in Mexico lasted exactly 300 years -- 1521 to 1821.\n\nThough law in colonial Mexico evolved over those three centuries, the basic dynamic of the social order within New Spain remained constant: pure-blooded Spaniards born in Spain ruled, all others were ruled by them.\n\nThe social stratification of people in New Spain by was based on the concept of \"Casta\", a Spanish term that embodied the colonial view of the various flavors of mixed-race people who were the result of interbreeding between Spanish Conquistadors and settlers with members of pure-blooded indigenous populations and slaves.\n\nUnlike ordinary racial prejudice -- which might, for example, have a made general distinctions between pure-blooded Spanish, mixed-race and Amerindian people -- the classification of people by racial makeup by the Spanish authorities in New Spain was spectacularly complex and was codified in excruciating detail by the Spanish colonial administrators.\n\nThis illustration depicting 16 racial distinctions made by the Spanish colonial administrators illustrates the main racial divisions that the Spanish saw among the population in New Spain, and provides a sense of just how complicated and nuanced the concept of Casta was:\n\nPeninsulares (Spaniards and other Whites born in Europe); Criollos (Spaniards and other Whites born in the Americas); Indios (Pure Amerindians); Mestizos (mixed Amerindian and White); Castizos (primarily White with some Amerindian); Cholos (primarily Amerindian with some White); Pardos (mixed White, African, and Amerindian); Mulattos (mixed African and White); Zambos (mixed Amerindian and African) and Negros (Pure Africans).\n\nBut these 16 Spanish-colonial racial classifications in New Spain were just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nBy the end of Spain's colonial rule in the Americas over 100 possible variations of racial mixture had been codified, with lavishly illustrated books created to help colonial administrators decide the proper racial classification of every individual in any Spanish colony.\n\nThe book pages to the right are typical. The captions on the pages define the specific pairing and the appropriate name for children produced by it -- which would define that childs' entire life.\n\nThe racial parsings that were \"Casta\" were also unlike ordinary prejudice in very concrete ways.\n\nCasta in New Spain wasn't just about simple discrimination, or about how the pure-bred Spaniards looked at -- or looked down upon -- their fellow man.\n\nThe system of Casta was fully embedded in the law of New Spain and had very important practical consequences for each group including in the realm of taxation -- the bottom line being that both the Spanish colonial administration and the Catholic church demanded more tax and other forms of payment from those lower down the social ladder.\n\nWhile the concept of Casta most impacted the progeny of mixed-blood marriages and unions in New Spain, even pure-blooded Spanish men born in New Spain were seen as inferior to a Spaniard born in Spain: by law, a person born in New Spain could not be appointed Viceroy of New Spain, no matter how illustrious his family was or how \"pure\" his genetic heritage.\n\nAll of the classes that were discriminated against by the pure-blooded Spanish authorities may have disagreed about many things, but the historical record is clear that by the early 1800s resentment of the miniscule number of pristine-pure blooded Spaniards who filled all of the most important posts in colonial Mexico was universally shared among them.\n\nIn 1810, inspired by the revolutions in the United States and France in the late 1700s, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Jesuit priest often referred to as the Father of Mexican Independence, ignited a revolt in that fused the resentments and anger of many of the disenfranchised classes in New Spain and set Mexico on a course that would make it an independent nation.\n\nSinaloa was spared the worst ravages of the biggest battles of the war of independence that took place near the seat of Spanish colonial government in Mexico City, and within other large population centers in the south.\n\nWhile Hidalgo's living role in the struggle for Mexican independence was short-lived -- he was captured and executed by firing squad by the Spanish in 1811 -- his words inspired others to continue the struggle that, after 11 bloody years, ended colonial Spanish rule in the Americas and gave birth to the country of Mexico in 1821.\n\nThe man who turned the tide in the war for Mexican independence and finally defeated the Spanish in the Americas was General Agustín de Iturbide (formally Agustín Cosme Damián de Iturbide y Arámburu), an upper-class Mexican crillo military man who had been raised raised among the privileged class of Valladolid, Morelia.\n\nIturbide had commanded royalist forces -- rather successfully -- for virtually all of the conflict until he switched sides at the very end of the war that created a soverign Mexico.\n\nIt is worth noting that Iturbide may well have been part Amerindian, and how his fierce denial of that possible genetic heritage illustrates the power of the concept and history of Caste in New Spain.\n\nWhile historians agree that it is clear that Iturbide's father was a pure-blooded Spaniard, some historians believe that his mother was a mestiza -- meaning that she was part Indian, making him part Indian.\n\nIturbide fiercely maintained that he was a criollo -- a pure-blooded Spaniard born in New Spain -- but his position that criollo's should have equal rights and privileges as Spaniards born in Spain was disruptive enough.\n\nIturbide's Plan of Iguala demanded equality for creoles, and also demanded the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Mexico, which would effectively end the rule of the Spanish Crown in The Americas.\n\nIndependent Mexico -- and Sinaloa -- becomes ruled by criollos and the modern history of Sinaloa begins\n\n19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nKing Ferdinand of Spain had enormous internal problems to cope with and the idea of a military adventure in the Americas in 1820 - 1821 was not an option.\n\nOn September 28, 1821, Agustín de Iturbide and the Spanish Viceroy, Juan de O'Donojú y O'Ryan, signed the Treaty of Córdoba which ended Spanish rule in the Americas.\n\nThe Mexican Empire (Imperio Mexicano) was the official name of newly independent Mexico, and it benefited from the long and extensive history of Spanish colonial dominance in the southern and western parts of the Americas.\n\nIt encompassed the the provinces and territories of both New Spain and of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala which included Chiapas State in modern Mexico and the territories of the modern nations of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.\n\nThe newly born nation had sovereignty over lands bordered by Panama in the south and stretching all the way to the Pacific northwest in the United States, including the current countries of Central America and the U.S. states of California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nThe independence achieved under the leadership of Iturbide would probably have disappointed Father Hidalgo.\n\nEstablished as a constitutional monarchy -- a congress was supposed to monitor the actions of the monarch -- the first Mexican Empire lasted just two short years, from 1821 to 1823.\n\nIturbide -- who proclaimed himself Emperor Augustin I of the Mexican Empire -- was not at all concerned about the plight of the lower classes. His intent was to preserve and expand the privileges of the criollo class and he succeeded: only Iturbide, personally, and other criollos really benefited from the expulsion of the Spaniards.\n\nBut discontent with Iturbide, personally, blossomed almost immediately -- even among his fellow criollos.\n\nHis self-appointment as emperor -- he crowned himself, as Napoleon had done in France -- broke with Spanish tradition and offended those who believed that Kings and Emperors should show subservience to the Catholic Church.\n\nThe most vigorous opposition to Iturbide's reign came from the newly-minted Mexican congressmen, a significant number of whom held republican ideas, and many of whom were Masons, a group that would advocate for greater democracy in Mexico for another century.\n\nIturbide dissolved the Congress on 31 October 1822 and created a new junta that answered only to him to legislate in its place, arresting and jailing numerous opposition members of the disbanded congress who protested these moves.\n\nMexico was spiraling downward economically: no European nation recognized Mexico's independence and most broke off economic ties.\n\nBut an even darker cloud was looming: a resurgent King Ferdinand was initiating a military intervention in Mexico the intent of which was to re-colonize New Spain -- an effort that lasted in fits and starts until 1829.\n\nIturbide's reign lasted just ten months -- from May 19, 1822 until March 19, 1823, when he abdicated and began his journey to exile in Tuscany, Italy.\n\nOn March 31, 1823, the Mexican congress granted executive power to a troika of prominent politicians: Nicolás Bravo, Pedro Celestino Negrete and Guadalupe Victoria.\n\nThe new Mexican government began to restructure the administrative districts within the country almost immediately, and in 1824, Sonora and Sinaloa were combined to form the Estado de Occidente (Western State), with El Fuerte as its capital.\n\n1800s Sinaloa prospers while most of Mexico faces\n\neconomic hardship and war 19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nMexico, overall, suffered economically after independence, with historians calculating that the average Mexican was actually poorer in 1870 than in 1821, but Sinaloa was an exception.\n\nThroughout the 1800s Sinaloan mining communities like Concordia, Copala, El Rosario, Panuco and others continued to yield massive amounts of silver and gold, large-scale agriculture in Sinaloa was thriving, and the port of Mazatlan experienced steady growth exporting gold, silver and agricultural products.\n\nThe pirate threat having been eliminated, the first decades of the 1800s brought the Port of Mazatlan steadily increasing ship traffic and the frequent arrival of cargo and passengers that hailed from very distant places.\n\nMazatlan had become one of the three most important ports on the Pacific coast of the Americas -- the others being San Francisco and Valparaiso in Chile -- with many ships arriving from Europe and the Middle East.\n\nMuch of this traffic -- an estimated sixty ships per year were arriving by the early 1800s -- was related to supplying mining operations in Concordia, Copala, El Rosario and Panuco, as well as bringing tools and materials that were used to continue to build Mazatlan and other towns in Sinaloa.\n\nThe Federal government in Mexico city understood the historical destiny of the northwest and, in March 1830, Estado de Occidente was officially divided into present-day Sonora and Sinaloa States, with El Fuerte named the capital of the new state of Sinaloa.\n\nIn recognition of its importance to the state, Mazatlan was made the capital of Sinaloa in 1859, an honor it would continue to hold until 1873 when the capital was moved to its present-day location, Culiacán -- and then only as a result of federal government legislation triggered by the occupation of many of Mexico's ports in the mid 19th century.\n\nThe middle of the 1800s were prosperous times for Sinaloa, but Mazatlan experienced several occupations and disruptions of the operations of the port from 1847 - 1868, the first being as a result of the Mexican - American War of 1846 - 1848.\n\nRun-up to the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 along the Pacific Coast and within Sinaloa\n\n19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nWhen war with Mexico broke out on May 12, 1846, the United States Navy had already been conducting naval operations against Mexico along the Pacific coast for almost four years, the first incident being a case of profound misunderstanding in 1842.\n\nIn 1842, Commodore Thomas Catesby Jones was in command of the United States Pacific Squadron, a fleet which included the frigate USS United States, the USS Cyane, the USS Saint Louis, the USS Yorktown and USS Shark, as well as a number of other ships.\n\nAt harbor in Lima, Peru, Jones was told that England had signed a secret treaty with Mexico ceding to the British Empire what is now the State of California for payment of 7 million dollars.\n\nJones believed that the Monroe Doctrine -- which asserted American hegemony over all of North America -- obligated him to take action immediately.\n\nWithout waiting for authorization from Washington -- or even confirmation of the \"information\", which would take weeks at best, months at most -- Jones ordered his squadron to set sail north towards Monterrey Bay, California, now San Francisco, which was the capital of the Mexican province.\n\nOn October 19, 1842, the United States Pacific Squadron entered Monterrey Bay and Commodore Jones sent his second-in-command, Captain James Armstrong, ashore to demand the surrender of not only of the small provincial outpost, but of the entire Mexican State of California.\n\nThe Mexican Army commander was given until 9:00 am the following day to surrender. He chose not to respond.\n\nCommodore Jones ordered a landing, and the United States Pacific Fleet sent 100 of its best sailors and 50 heavily armed marines ashore shortly after 9:00 am. The Mexicans -- who had only a poorly built fortification and 58 minimally-equipped troops -- were wildly over-matched and offered no resistance, surrendering their \"fort\" without a shot being fired.\n\nThe United States sailors celebrated, and proudly planted the American flag.\n\nThe worm can turn rapidly in military matters, and virtually overnight Commodore Jones was revealed as a credulous fool.\n\nWhen Jones went ashore on October 21, 1842, he discovered that the supposed \"treaty\" between Mexico and England was nothing more than a totally inaccurate rumor, and that war between the United States and Mexico, or England, or whomever were pure figments of his imagination.\n\nJones immediately ordered the American flag his men had planted two days before lowered, and publicly saluted the Mexican flag that had been hoisted in its place.\n\nWhile Commodore Jones reportedly made a sincere attempt to mollify the Mexican Army commander whose fort he'd seized, no lives had been lost, and the Mexican government was soon informed that Jones had been relieved of his command, the Incident at Monterrey had left a very bad taste in Mexico City -- and was used to support the argument among Mexican leaders and government officials that 1840s America was both expansionist and trigger-happy.\n\nThe United States and Mexico go to war in 1846\n\nand Mazatlán suffers 19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nThe bloodletting of the Mexican-American war of 1846 to 1848 only lightly touched most of Sinaloa.\n\nBut while Sinaloa was largely isolated from the most-lethal battles of the Mexican-American war -- which blossomed out of land and border disputes originating far to the east, and related to ownership of present-day Texas and a vast amount of land to the west and north that extended to the Pacific coast of California -- during the Mexican-American war the Port of Mazatlan was blockaded, invaded and occupied by the American Navy in from 1847 to 1848.\n\nTo be continued soon...\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed in 1848, put and end to the war and permanently stripped Mexico of land that now forms the states of California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, most of Arizona and Colorado, and parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Wyoming.\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was largely portrayed as consensual by press in the United States, with newspapers often emphasizing in their reporting that Mexico had been paid $15,000,000 USD -- and was forgiven another $3,000,000 USD of existing debt -- as part of the peace agreement.\n\nWith the Americans gone, Mazatlan -- and all of Sinaloa -- breathed a sigh of relief, and the business of creating wealth resumed.\n\nIt is hard to believe when viewing the beautiful and extraordinarily tranquil watercolor painting below, painted by British Admiral Edward Gennys Fanshawe in 1850 from the foot of the El Faro lighthouse atop Cerro del Creston, that Mazatlan had ever experienced war.\n\nThe Reform War of 1858 - 1861 sets the stage for the French Intervention and the occupation of Mazatlán in the 1860s 19th Century Sinaloa\n\nIn the late 1850s Mexico was convulsed by a civil war that was the culmination of a struggle between Conservative and Liberal factions within the country that began immediately after Mexico seceded from Spain in 1821.\n\nAfter a decade of war with Spain, Mexico was a fractured nation.\n\nThe 36 years between 1821 to 1857 saw fifty different national governments ranging from the monarchy of 1821 - 1823 under Emperor Agustín de Iturbide to constitutional republican governments and even a brief dictatorship.\n\nSome Mexicans began to believe that the social order needed to be fundamentally reformed, and a group of parties, political thinkers and aspiring leaders that we now group together as Liberals began to emerge.\n\nMany historians believe that much of Liberal politics in Mexico had its origin in the meetings of Freemasons, and the history of privacy that their Lodges -- and the secret nature of their society -- provided.\n\nLiberals supported the establishment of a Federalist Republic in Mexico based upon the political ideas and ideals that were emerging from the European Enlightenment, which was secular and democratic in nature and would, by definition, impose limitations on the Church's privileges and abolish statutes that exempted military officers from being charged with civil crimes or being tried in civil courts.\n\nConservatives -- many of whom were royalists who had opposed separation from Spain in the first place -- advocated maintaining most of the institutions inherited from the colonial period, notably tax and legal exemptions for the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Liberals had won some political victories at the state level as early as the 1820s, and the Presidencies of Valentín Gómez Farías in the 1830s and 1840s saw him shrink the ranks of the military and abolish the military's exemption from civil trials; outlaw mandatory tithes to the Church; seize Church properties; secularize education and appropriate 15,000,000 pesos of church funds to help finance the Mexican-American War.\n\nThe seizure of church funds in 1847 triggered a brief military rebellion -- the Revolt of the Polkos -- which was supported by Conservatives and the Church and was a small-scale preview of the Reform War of 1858 - 1861.\n\nTo be continued soon...\n\nIn 1861 Napoleon III sets his sights on Mexico\n\nand Sinaloa silver mines 19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nMazatlan experienced another serious siege and occupation in the 1860s, this time by the Napoleon III and his Second French Empire.\n\nVariously referred to as the Second Franco-Mexican War, the Second French Intervention, the Maximilian Affair or the War of French Intervention, this attempted recolonization of Mexico by France was initially supported by both England and Spain.\n\nBoth the trigger for, and the underlying causes of, the Second Franco-Mexican War were economic.\n\nMexico was a seriously indebted nation in 1861: France, Britain and Spain had extended credit and loans to the Mexican government in the four decades since it achieved independence, with France owed 135 million gold francs, Britain 85 million and Spain 40 million, and Mexico was behind on its interest payments to all three.\n\nBeyond the debt issue, Napoleon III coveted access to Latin American markets and -- unfortunately for Mazatlan and Sinaloa State -- the gold and silver that was being mined in Sinaloa and elsewhere in Mexico.\n\nIn early 1860s historians estimate silver worth as much as $5,000,000 USD was flowing through the Port of Mazatlan annually, which only represented a fraction of Sinaloa's silver output, because silver also left the state via overland routes.\n\nTo put the value of $5,000,000 USD in the mid 1800s in historical context -- and overlooking the value of gold and other precious minerals mined in 1860's Sinaloa -- the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo only obliged the United States to pay Mexico $18,000,000 USD in cash and debt relief for land that encompassed the modern states of California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, most of Arizona and Colorado, and parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Wyoming.\n\nNapoleon III needed a pretext to intervene in Mexico, and in 1861 he got it.\n\nLiberal former governor of the State of Oaxaca and sitting President of the Supreme Court of Justice Benito Juárez was elected President of Mexico in March 1861.\n\nOn July 17, 1861 he suspended interest payments on Mexico's foreign debts entirely, a decision that would have dire consequences for Sinaloa State and, in particular, Mazatlan.\n\nNapoleon III understood that with the United States, embroiled in civil war, would be unlikely -- and probably simply militarily unable -- to assert its claim to military hegemony in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe ill-advised decision by Benito Juárez to suspend interest foreign loan interest payments made Britain and Spain amenable to Napoleon III's plans.\n\nOn October 31, 1861, France, Great Britain and Spain signed the Treaty of London which united them in a common cause to invade and reestablish a European monarchy in Mexico -- the Second Mexican Empire.\n\nNapoleon III knew he could count on having allies within Mexico: the history of post-colonial Mexico had disenfranchised many menbers of the former ruling class.\n\nThere were many closet -- and not so closet -- monarchists among the criollo class in in Mexico who had not only opposed Juárez in the 1861 election, but had opposed independence from Spain in the first place, and welcomed the idea of the return of a European-descended monarch.\n\nThe animosity felt toward Juárez by the criollos was amplified by caste hatred: Juárez's parents were, in his own words, \"indios de la raza primitiva del país\" -- \"Indians of the primitive race of the country\" -- and his first language was Zapotec, not Spanish.\n\nBeyond criollo monarchists, Napoleon III could count on the Catholic Church and clergy who fiercely opposed not only the specific Liberal Reform Laws that were passed in 1855 - 1857 and the reform constitution of 1857, but the entire progressive agenda for the evolution of Mexican society that was being promoted by the Liberals throughout mid 1800s Mexico.\n\nDespite Juárez's Indian ancestry, Napoleon III even had reason to hope that his invasion might be welcomed by at least some indigenous communities: the unofficial perpetuation of the caste system in mid 1800s Mexico supported a system of land tenancy that effectively perpetuated the history of serfdom for many Indian tribes and communities.\n\nNapoleon III needed a member of the European monarchy to be his puppet, and he had one in mind that had impeccable credientials and an astoundingly long lineage: Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph, who was a younger brother of Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I and a member of the House of Habsburg which traced its roots to Guntram the Rich, a pre-Medieval noble from what is now Breisgau, Germany, who died in 973 A.D.\n\nThe French invade Mexico in 1861\n\n19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nA flotilla made up of British and French flotilla warships arrived off Veracruz, Mexico, in December 1861 and wasted no time landing 7500 French and 700 British heavily armed soldiers, who were soon reenforced by 6000 Spanish soldiers who were redeployed from their bases in Cuba, which was still a Spanish colonial possession.\n\nBenito Juárez attempted to negotiate with the French -- who were the leading force both numerically and in terms of the formal military chain of command -- but soon realized that the French had a more ambitious agenda than simple debt repayment.\n\nThe British and Spanish also began to realize the scope of Napoleon III's goals and soon withdrew their land armies, but continued to support the French with their naval assets.\n\nDespite the reduction of his fighting force by nearly fifty percent -- and being strongly advised to wait for reinforcements -- Commanding General Conde de Lorencez arrogantly marched the French army toward Mexico City, writing, \"We are so superior to the Mexicans in race, in organization, in discipline, in morality and in elevation of feeling, that I beg your Excellency to be so good as to inform the Emperor that, at the head of 6,000 soldiers, I am already master of Mexico.\"\n\nThe Master of Mexico got his hat handed to him at the First Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862 by a wildly understrength Mexican army division numbering just 4,000 soldiers led by Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza -- a stunning defeat that was the first for French forces since the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\nAn enraged Napoleon III relieved his losing commander and sent General Élie Frédéric Forey and 23,000 fresh French sloldiers to Mexico. Napoleon III's instructions to Forey nakedly reveal the motives for the invasion and the economic origins of the conflict:\n\n\"...we have no interest that they (the United States) take over the entire Gulf of Mexico and be sole provider of products in the New World...If on the contrary Mexico preserves its independence and the integrity of its territory, if a stable government can be established with the assistance of France...We will have established our benevolent influence in the center of America, and this benevolence, in creating immense outlets for our commerce, will obtain for us the materials necessary for our industry.\"\n\nGeneral Forey led his troops on an offensive that began in March, 1863, and culminated in the fall of Mexico City on June 7, 1863 and the establishment of a puppet French government in Mexico.\n\nMilitary commanders handled the formal surrender: Benito Juárez and most of his remaining Republican army fled into the mountains where he would lead them in a guerrilla war against the French until their expulsion in 1866.\n\nA puppet government needs a puppet leader and, seeking to legitimize French rule, Napoleon III sent Maximilian to establish a new Mexican monarchy.\n\nWith the support of the French army and a group of conservative Mexican monarchists, Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph traveled to Mexico City where, on April 10, 1864, he declared himself Maximilian I, Emperor of Mexico.\n\nMazatlán is probed by the French Navy in 1862 - 1863\n\n1800s Sinaloa History\n\nLong before Maximilian arrived in Mexico and declared himself Emperor, warships from the French Navy had arrived off the coast of Sinaloa and were probing Mazatlan's harbor and shore defenses, and harassing merchant ships attempting to enter and exit the port.\n\nMazatlan was the capital Sinaloa State in 1862 and the most important city in northwest Mexico, but Napoleon III wasn't focused on the political or propaganda benefits capture of the city might bring, this was about money.\n\nThe silver and gold coming out of Sinaloa's mines was the prize and the port was the key to securing it: Napoleon III was willing to commit substantial resources to take Mazatlan, whatever was happening in the Mexico City Theater of the Second Franco-Mexican War.\n\nAs early as May 1862 -- barely more that five months into the French Intervention -- the French spardeck corvette Bayonnaise arrived off the Port of Mazatlan and blockaded the harbor.\n\nCommanded by French Vice Admiral Jurien de la Gravière, the corvette Bayonnaise was a formidable warship. Built in 1857, the she was a powerful three-masted craft that carried 30 cannon and a crew of over 220 sailors.\n\nThe blockade caused significant economic hardship throughout Sinaloa and lasted until June 18, 1862, when the Bayonnaise sailed down the Sinaloa coast, rounded the tip of the Baja Peninsula and sailed north to San Francisco, harassing ships bound for Mexico all along the way.\n\nThe Bayonnaise and Vice Admiral Jurien de la Gravière would remain a bane of merchant ships all along the Pacific coast of Mexico for most of 1862: her next port-of-call after San Francisco was Acapulco, where she began harassing commercial vessels on August 16th.\n\nThe French Navy returned to Mazatlan with more force in February 1863, with a heavily armed frigate and three corvettes shadowing traffic outside the mouth of the harbor for a few days before leaving the area.\n\nFor a year, Mazatlan and Sinaloa State were spared further French attempts to disrupt trade. All that changed dramatically on March 26, 1864.\n\nThe Port of Mazatlán is blockaded by the French Navy\n\nin March 1864 19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nOn March 26, 1864, the French flagship La Cordelière under the command of Captain Marlineau Des Chenez appeared off the coast of Sinaloa near Deer Island just off what is now the Golden Zone / Zona Dorada, and was soon joined by the British Pearl Class sail-steam corvette HMS Charybdis.\n\nThe arrival of the La Cordelière at Mazatlan was not a surprise: earlier in the month she was sighted prowling the waters off the small Port of San Blas in Nayarit State just south of Sinaloa, and she had captured a Mexican-flagged boat coming from San Francisco, California, that was carrying letters intended for deposed-President Benito Juárez.\n\nThe defensive strategy and fortifications at Mazatlan had been designed by Colonel Gaspar Sánchez Ochoa.\n\nA veteran Mexican army officer who had served under General Ignacio Zaragoza during the Mexican triumph at First Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, Ochoa understood well the historical precedents for defending Mazatlan from invasion.\n\nColonel Sánchez Ochoa was an optimist: he thought that the French could be defeated at the waterline -- and that history informed him how to do it.\n\nOn the afternoon of March 26th the La Cordelière began to shell the fortifications at North Beach (Playa Norte) and put out a single small landing craft which approached to within about 400 yards of the shoreline before drawing cannon fire from Mexican troops positioned just dozens of yards off the beach.\n\nThe French landing craft returned small arms fire and the La Cordelière continued to fire on the Mexican artillery positions with her cannon.\n\nArtillery Captain Jesus Gamboa fired two shells that struck home and the French retreated, with the La Cordelière sailing to Deer Island to perform repairs.\n\nThe landing craft withdrew unscathed, but there were injuries among the Mexican troops on the shore as a result of near-misses and explosions of shells from the French naval guns.\n\nThe skirmish had been a probe: despite their long history plying the waters off Mazatlan and familiarity with its defenses, the French wanted to see the Mexican artillery in action before making a serious attempt to land troops.\n\nMarch 27th was quiet, with both sides preparing for a fight.\n\nAboard the La Cordelière French Marines prepared for a beach landing, and ashore Colonel Gaspar Sánchez Ochoa and his second-in-command Captain Marcial Benítez readied their troops, particularly the artillery, which Sanchez Ochoa hoped would sink or disable French landing craft before the reached the shore.\n\nOn March 28th the La Cordelière, still anchored off Deer Island, put out 14 landing craft that began to cautiously move toward the beach.\n\nWhen the French boats were about a mile from the shore the La Cordelière began firing her naval guns at the artillery positions that had been identified two days before. Captain Marcial Benítez ordered his battery to return fire, but the six shells the Mexican gunners fired missed the La Cordelière.\n\nEleven of the landing boats made a dash towards the beach and managed to disembark their troops without casualties. The French marines now had a beachhead in Mazatlan, but it wouldn't last long.\n\nWith Captain Marcial Benítez continuing to direct artillery fire at the three landing craft that remained offshore, Colonel Sánchez Ochoa and his infantry troops attacked the French who who had made it to the beach.\n\nAfter a fierce sharp firefight, the French re-boarded their landing craft and fled back to the La Cordelière, carrying several dead and wounded marines.\n\nColonel Sánchez Ochoa's troops had also taken casualties on the 28th: one dead and three wounded.\n\nThe 29th and 30th were quiet, with the French apparently trying to decide whether to attempt another landing. They decided not -- they would punish the Mexicans from afar.\n\nAt 2:00 pm on March 31, 1864, the La Cordelière turned broadside toward Mazatlan and opened up with all of its cannon on the side of the ship facing the city. The firing was largely indiscriminate and aimed less at the Mexican artillery positions than at the town in general.\n\nBy sunset the La Cordelière had fired between 300 and 400 shells -- the historical record is unclear -- while the Mexican artillery had fired 158 times.\n\nColonel Gaspar Sánchez Ochoa and his men had won the battle: the French would not attempt another beach landing. But the war -- and the suffering of the populace of Mazatlan -- was just beginning.\n\nWhat followed the battles of March 26 to March 31, 1864, was a more than seven month naval blockade of the port by the La Cordelière, the hardships of which caused substantial dissent between Republican and Imperial factions within the population.\n\nColonel Gaspar Sánchez Ochoa had come out of the defense of Mazatlan a hero, with President Benito Juárez first promoting him to General and later appointing him Governor of Sinaloa State.\n\nThe La Cordelière briefly left the Sea of Cortez, but by March 1865 she sailed north up the coast of Sinaloa, past Mazatlan, and onward to the Port of Guaymas, Sonora, to harass shipping there.\n\nA divided Mazatlán struggles to survive the\n\nFrench blockade, March - November 1864\n\n19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nThe blockade of Mazatlan caused great hardships for the populace of the city.\n\nSea trade -- historically the foundation of Mazatlan's economy -- was completely disrupted, and only a small fraction of the products produced near the port could be transported out overland.\n\nThe people of Mazatlan were divided.\n\nOfficially, the city was controlled by supporters of deposed-President Benito Juárez, but the leadership was fragmented between several competing pro-Juárez factions, paralyzing government and effectively ending city services.\n\nA substantial fraction of the citizens of Mazatlan didn't care whether the Juaristas or the Republican forces won -- they just wanted the conflict to be over as rapidly as possible so that commerce could be re-started.\n\nAdded to this dysfunctional mix were the not inconsiderable number of Mazatlecos who were monarchists who, openly or covertly, hoped for a French victory in the Franco-Mexican war.\n\nThe first military guardian of blockaded Mazatlan was General Plácido de la Vega Daza -- formally Don Plácido de la Vega Daza y Colon de Portugal -- and his Central Army 3rd Division, a volunteer Republican force that were garrisoned in the city.\n\nOne of the more colorful characters in Sinaloa history, Plácido Vega was believed to be a direct descendant of Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne and a 13th generation descendant of Cristopher Columbus.\n\nA native of Sinaloa born in El Fuerte in the northern part of the state in 1830, Vega's family owned vast tracts of land and gold and silver mines.\n\nUnlike many Mexicans born into privilege in the mid 1800s, Vega somehow managed to grow up liberal, and had been an early and ardent supporter of both the reform Constitution of 1857 and of Benito Juárez.\n\nPlácido Vega was appointed Governor of Sinaloa State in 1859 -- at age 29 -- and served until 1862. He had formal military training and, under his leadership, Mazatlan remain relatively calm in the earliest months of the blockade.\n\nBut his friendship with Benito Juárez was going to deprive Mazatlan of his leadership: in mid 1864 Juárez sent Plácido Vega to the United States on a secret mission to seek support -- and raise funds for -- the Constitutionalists fight against the French.\n\nWith Vega out of the picture, open conflict between two Juárez supporters broke out in October 1864 that led to the fall of Mazatlan to the French.\n\nGeneral Jesus García Morales, who had served briefly as Governor of Sinaloa in 1863, and General Ramón Corona were uneasily sharing control of Mazatlan and the area surrounding the municipality.\n\nThe two intensely disliked each other for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was that Morales had attempted to have Corona brought up on misappropriation-of-state-funds charges when he was Governor of Sinaloa.\n\nThe long and bitter history of personal animosity between Morales and Corona would be the beginning of the undoing of the defense of Mazatlan.\n\nGarcía Morales was residing in the Centro Historico and Corona outside the city in the Presidio military base southeast of Mazatlan.\n\nOn October 11, 1864, Corona marched 600 infantry soldiers and 200 of his cavalry -- he had an additional 1000 men in reserve -- to the edge of Mazatlan and demanded that Morales surrender to him.\n\nMorales had just 500 men under his command, but he also controlled Mazatlan's artillery, 48 heavy cannon. Refusing to surrender, Morales had his men turn all of the guns around -- they had been pointed in the direction of the Sea of Cortez and the French -- and re-sighted them on the land approaches to the city.\n\nAt 2 am on October 16th, 1864, Corona launched an all-out assault from his positions south of the Centro Historico.\n\nAfter a brief but intense battle, Corona's troops overwhelmed Morales' positions, with Morales being captured by Corona, personally, and over 35 Republican soldiers lying dead and wounded in the streets of Mazatlan.\n\nHearing of the chaos, Sinaloa Governor Antonio Rosales decided that he needed to act.\n\nArriving in Mazatlan in late October he managed to gain control of the city, but he was in for a surprise: the bloodletting between the Juarista factions had shifted public sentiment and many Mazatlecos wanted to surrender to the French and go about re-building their lives.\n\nMazatlán surrenders to the French Imperial Army\n\non November 13, 1864 19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nOn the October 24, 1864, three French warships, the D'Assas, Diamant and Victoire left Acapulco harbor loaded with a substantial compliment of fighting men.\n\nAboard the ships were several hundred French Marines, 70 Egyptian soldiers and two companies of Zouave riflemen, French light infantry soldiers largely hailing from North Africa and battle-tested in French colonial campaigns there.\n\nThe French battle plan was to fully envelope the city: Manuel Lozada, an Imperialist officer, was marching 5000 French Imperial infantry toward the city from the southeast and preparing fighting positions where he would wait for the French fleet to seal the city from the water.\n\nLozada's Imperialist army's ranks had been swelled by the arrival of several hundred Cora Indians from the rugged mountainous part of northern Nayarit State, a tribe who fiercely resisted Christian conversion who had a long history of warfare and demonstrated fighting skills.\n\nThe citizens of Mazatlan knew what was coming and many chose to evacuate their homes and businesses, particularly those structures closest to the water.\n\nThe French warships arrived on November 12, 1864.\n\nSinaloa Governor Antonio Rosales and many of the Republican defenders knew they had no chance against the array of crack French troops aboard the ships -- and the naval cannon -- but when the D'Assas, Diamant and Victoire joined the La Cordelière off Mazatlan they were met by a delegation led by Governor Rosales, who attempted to finesse the situation and open negotiations.\n\nThe French infantry commander, Captain Thomas Louis Le Normant de Kergrist, was having none of it: he issued an ultimatum for surrender of the port that had a deadline the following day.\n\nWritten notice was given to the Mexican commanders that any resistance would result in immediate hostilities, and that neutral -- mostly American -- ships in the harbor would also be targeted should that occur.\n\nGovernor Rosales responded by putting his coastal batteries on alert with orders to fire on any ship coming within range.\n\nGovernor Rosales knew that he didn't have the military strength to defend the port and was determined to march north with his troops to El Habal and El Quelite, where they felt they could establish defensible positions from which to execute guerrilla operations against the French army and its Indian allies and mercenaries.\n\nThe French warships began firing early on the morning of November 13 -- arguably before the ultimatum deadline had expired -- and the shelling immediately damaged a number of buildings in the Centro Historico.\n\nGovernor Rosales and the Republican commanders could see firsthand the scope of damage that the French naval gunners could inflict if they continued firing.\n\nThe Governor and his senior commanders hastily sailed to the flagship of the French fleet accompanied by city leaders to inform the French commander that the General Corona had argued that the Republicans surrender -- and had evacuated his garrison as requested, fulfilling one of the terms of the French ultimatum.\n\nThey also offered formal surrender of Mazatlan and its port.\n\nFrench troops from the D'Assas, Diamant and Victoire were landed and Manuel Lozada's infantry surged into the city. There was minimal exchange of gunfire, but an American citizen was shot on sight.\n\nMartial law was immediately imposed by the French and the carrying of firearms and the trading of firearms were prohibited.\n\nRepublican units got out of Mazatlan just in time: heading north they were forced to fight a sharp engagement with Lozada's encircling Imperial forces that resulted in significant casualties.\n\nReaching El Quelite, the Republicans established defensive positions and a plan began to take form: Governor Antonio Rosales would command the Republican guerrilla forces in northern Sinaloa while General Ramón Corona would be responsible for southern Sinaloa.\n\nMazatlan was destined to endure an occupation that would last exactly two years -- the city was liberated on November 13, 1866.\n\nFrench Colonial Occupation of Mazatlán November 13, 1864 - November 13, 1866 19th Century / 1800s Sinaloa History\n\nThe French occupation of Mazatlan from November 1864 to November 1866 was the longest in the city's history, and took place withing the context of the larger war between French and allied Imperial forces and the remainders of Benito Juarez's Republican government and military.\n\nIt also took place within the context of the French Imperial forces attempt to extend their military control throughout Sinaloa State -- particularly the parts of which where mines were located.\n\nGeneral Manuel Lozada's leadership had served France and the Empire of Mexico well in terms of the capture of the port and city, but administration of those assets and pressing the ongoing war in Sinaloa were another matter.\n\nIn early January 1865 a fresh French army marched from Durango to Mazatlan.\n\nFollowing a route over the \"Devil's Backbone\" of the Sierra Madre Occidental that roughly mirrors that of the modern Mexican Federal Highway 40 / 40D, General Armando Alexandre de Castagny and his troops got their first taste of Republican resistance near the Durango / Sinaloa border.\n\nThough many Republicans died and the battle is regarded as a French victory, the experience was sobering and sewed the seeds of further bloodletting: a number of Republican prisoners were summarily executed -- and the Republicans knew it.\n\nThe French Imperial forces continued to advance toward Mazatlan and at the village of Veranos the Rebublicans ambushed them, this time with much more success, killing over 100 Cazadores de Vincennes and Regimiento de Zuavos soldiers -- elite French infantry who were veterans of the Battle of Puebla.\n\nThe bitter nature of the battles of The Second French Intervention in south-central Sinaloa was taking form: Republican units executed Imperialist prisoners in the village of Jacobo, Sinaloa, in retaliation for the executions at the \"Devil's Backbone\" just days before.\n\nBy late January 1865 French Imperial General Armando Alexandre de Castagny was firmly ensconced in a Centro Historico mansion, but local cooperation was, to say the least, disappointing.\n\nGeneral Castagny decided that a firm hand was what was needed, setting up military courts that were empowered to order executions of Mexican citizens.\n\nThe executions began just days later, on January 31, 1865.\n\nBut executions alone weren't enough -- General Castagny had a war to pursue in the Sinaloa countryside.\n\nTowns throughout south Sinaloa like Concordia, El Castillo, La Embocada, Malpica, Siquieros and Villa Unión were burned in punitive raids and -- on orders -- captured defenders were shot on the spot.\n\nWhen a subordinate officer, Colonel Garnier, protested the actions, General Castagny dismissed him from the Imperial Army.\n\nConcordia was the worst hit -- and the Imperial forces seemed to want to march further up into the Sierra Madre -- but while sacking nearby Copala they met substantial republican resistance.\n\nLosing several dead and injured in a sharp firefight -- and hearing word that there were even more Republican troops massed near Pánuco -- the Imperialist forces retreated to the relative security of Concordia.\n\nRepublican victories were not unheard of in Spring 1866. Imperialist forces being substantially challenged outside Mazatlan: sharp engagements on March 19 - 21 and on April 1, 1866, at Villa Union and Concordia were clear Republican triumphs, with the defeated Imperialists withdrawing in disarray to the port.\n\nGeneral Castagny was determined to win by using brute force against civilian populations, and March 1866 brought even more terrible news to Mazatlan and the remaining unoccupied towns and villages in Sinaloa.\n\nImperialist General Manuel Lozada had marched south and sacked Escuinapa near the border with Nayarit. After destroying Escuinapa, Lozada fell back upon a Republican hospital in Maloya and executed all the patients and staff.\n\nThe Republican fighting forces and the civilian populations that supported them in south - central Si"
