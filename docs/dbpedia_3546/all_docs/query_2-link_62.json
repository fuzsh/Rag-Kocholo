This collection of Late Postclassic to Spanish conquest-era (c. ad 1350-1650) Maya sites are similar in function to rural Old World and Andean caravan stopovers, such as caravanserai and way stations, where travellers and traders obtained supplies, trading partners, safety, solidarity through ritual and travel information along long-distance land routes. These sites are similar to trading ports and pilgrimage centres, but they are smaller, located in the countryside, not often managed by regional states, and have scaled-down economic exchange with fewer exotic trade items. Stopovers often include landscape and rock-art shrines for collective ritual among foreign travellers and local populations. While investigators have researched the anthropological importance of overland routes, caravans and trade centres, less attention has been given to stopover sites in the countryside. This article discusses the archaeological signatures and outlines the comparative social, economic and ritual implications of small rural stopover sites that united people on the road.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - A Small Rural Travel Stopover at the Late Postclassic Maya Site of Mensabak, Chiapas, Mexico\n\nT2 - Overland Trade, Cross-Cultural Interaction and Social Cohesion in the Countryside\n\nAU - Palka, Joel W.\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: Copyright Â© The Author(s), 2023.
