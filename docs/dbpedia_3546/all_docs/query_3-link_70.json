        "text": "How did Spain rule over an immense global empire for more than three centuries given the absence of a standing army and the presence of stark inequalities? In this course students will learn how historians have answered this enduring question, and will analyze a range of primary sources such as wills, artworks, and petitions to develop theories of their own. We explore the experience of empire from the perspectives of diverse groups of people including free and enslaved Africans, indigenous men and women, mestizo soldiers, nuns, and colonial elites. By studying the writings of Andean intellectuals and the testimonies of slaves who took their masters to court or rose up in violent rebellions against the colonial order, students will develop a deeper understanding of the complexity of Spanish rule and its variations across time and place. We also consider the legacies of this global empire, and controversies about how we tell its history. This course is chronologically and thematically organized. It begins in 1491, on the eve of the Iberian invasion of the Americas and the Caribbean, and ends in 1898, when Spain lost the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. The semester is structured around four myths about the global Spanish empire that persist in historiography and popular culture: the myth of colonial rule by coercion; the ‘commercial revolution’ and the myth of mobility; and the myth of imperial collapse. Key themes include the development of racial ideologies in the Iberian world, and their impact on the evolution of racial slavery.\n\nEstebanico, the Moroccan black slave of conquistador Andrés de Dorantes, has garnered sporadic scholarly attention throughout the twentieth century and in recent years. As one of the four surviving members of the ill-starred 1528 Pánfilo de Narváez expedition, the only references to him are contained in narratives and records of Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Fray Marcos de Niza, and the Coronado expedition, as well as colonial administrative correspondence of the viceroy and archbishop of New Spain. Esteban’s journey is an African story that defies historiographic stereotypes of Spanish imperial conquest and colonization in the Atlantic world. Although his personal life can only be factually reconstructed through subjective Spanish political lenses, it is possible to form a portrait of the man by examining the cultural spheres through which he passed, from Sub-Saharan Africa to Morocco, from Iberia to the Caribbean, from Florida to the Rio Grande Valley, and from Mexico City to his death in the Zuñi pueblos of modern New Mexico and Arizona. This shaman of syncretic belief systems appropriated a highly unusual degree of power, both institutional and self-authorized. This essay will map the spheres of his journey across time and cultures as a means of assessing themes of conquest, colonization, race and identity formation, religion, and gender on the frontiers of empire in the native ground."
