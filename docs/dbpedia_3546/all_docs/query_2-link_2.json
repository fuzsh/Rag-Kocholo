        "text": "Appointment of Pedrarias\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 8:29 PM ET (AP)\n\nBrazil expels Nicaraguan ambassador in retaliation as rift between leaders grows\n\nThe king relieved Balboa with a trusted general, Pedro Arias Dávila (known as Pedrarias), although he allowed Balboa to continue his explorations on the Pacific coast. Pedrarias, however, distrusted the ambitious Balboa and, accusing him of treason, had him beheaded in 1517. Pedrarias expanded the colony but was responsible for enslaving and murdering the Indian population, despite royal orders for more humane treatment. In 1519 he established Panama City on the Pacific coast and moved the capital there in 1524, abandoning the hot, humid Darién.\n\nPedrarias sent a kinsman, Gil González Dávila, to explore northward, and he found civilization on the shores of Lake Nicaragua. The jealous Pedrarias forced him to flee to Santo Domingo before a Spanish colony could be planted, however, and instead sent Francisco Hernández de Córdoba in 1524, who established Granada on Lake Nicaragua and León not far from Lake Managua. But when Córdoba attempted to set up a kingdom independent of Panama, Pedrarias came to Nicaragua himself and put Córdoba to death after a year of civil war.\n\nWhile Pedrarias and Córdoba conquered lower Central America, the conqueror of Mexico, Hernán Cortés, looked southward. In 1524 he sent Cristóbal de Olid by sea to Honduras and Pedro de Alvarado overland to conquer Guatemala. Olid founded the port of Triunfo de la Cruz but immediately declared himself independent of Cortés, a common practice among the conquistadores. Accompanied by a large force of Indian warriors from central Mexico and preceded by a smallpox epidemic, Alvarado faced little opposition until he reached Guatemala. There he allied with the Cakchiquel Maya against the rival Quiché. He allegedly defeated the Quiché chief, Tecúm-Umán, in hand-to-hand combat at Xelajú, near present-day Quezaltenango. Alvarado went on to conquer the Pipil of El Salvador in the same year, but a bloody rebellion by the Cakchiquel took four more years to quell.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nQuick Quiz: Central American Geography\n\nIn Honduras a three-way struggle developed between the forces of Pedrarias, Cortés, and González, who had returned to Central America to press Pedrarias’s claim to Nicaragua. The discovery of gold in Honduras made the struggle more intense. Cortés first sent Francisco de Las Casas to relieve the rebellious Olid but then marched to Honduras himself to reprimand Olid. Before he arrived, however, Las Casas and González had united against Olid and put him to death. Cortés’s difficult trip to Honduras thus turned out to be unnecessary, but, before leaving, he consolidated his control of the Honduran coast with the establishment of Puerto Natividad (renamed Puerto Cortés in 1869). The loyal Alvarado consolidated Cortés’s control over Honduras as well as Guatemala and El Salvador, confronting the forces of Pedrarias, with whom rivalry continued for years.\n\nAlvarado went on to participate in the conquests of Peru and of northern Mexico while retaining his governorship of Guatemala. Uniquely, upon his death in 1541 in Jalisco, his widow, Beatriz de la Cueva, succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, chosen by leading officials in the Guatemalan capital upon news of Alvarado’s death. The rule of Doña Beatriz, however, lasted but two days, for she died when a massive flood and mud slide destroyed the city on Sept. 10, 1541. Construction of a new capital, Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (present-day Antigua, Guat.), began a few miles away in 1543.\n\nFurther conquest of the Indians\n\nIndian resistance delayed the conquest of Costa Rica until 1561, when Juan de Cavallón led a successful colonization expedition there. Although none of his settlements in the Nicoya Bay region survived, he and his men began the permanent Spanish occupation of Costa Rica. A year later Juan Vásquez de Coronado took over as governor of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and in 1564 he established Cartago as the seat of government in the central valley of Costa Rica, where a small but industrious population developed.\n\nSpanish domination of Central America was achieved by relatively few Spanish military forces but at a great cost in Indian lives. Remote areas, however, especially in northern Guatemala and along the Caribbean coast, remained outside Spanish control throughout the colonial period, eventually allowing Great Britain to colonize Belize and the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua.\n\nYet the conquest was not entirely military. A Dominican friar, Bartolomé de Las Casas, made a notable effort to ameliorate treatment of the Indians in Central America. The brutality of the Spanish conquest had repelled Las Casas in the Caribbean. After his Dominican monasteries in Nicaragua and Guatemala failed to bring better treatment to the Indians, he went to a province of northern Guatemala to pacify it without military force. His experiment in this province, which he called the Verapaz, was only partially successful, but it served as the basis for his arguments to the Spanish crown against abuse of the Indians. The resulting New Laws of 1542 began the suppression of the encomienda system of exploitation of Indian labour."
