        "text": "Visit Guatemala's Totonicapan:\n\nSince 1993, this two day festival in August celebrates the Mayan traditions and cultural heritage. Celebrations go all day long with traditional food and dance.\n\nDanza de los Venados (Dance of the Deer)\n\nThis dance is of prehispanic origin and refers to the ancient ritual of the Deer Hunt, carried out in order to provide food and material sustenance for the community. Currently, this ritual remains in the context of a dance and for that reason it is presented by figures such as the tiger and the lion who struggle to hunt the deer. Dogs help the young men chase after the deer, the old man and woman in charge of hunting ritual, and together with the monkeys -- make the whole scene humorous. This dance may be interpreted as a struggle between hunters and wild animals, fighting among themselves over the meat of the deer. In the end it is a feast in which there is enough meat for everyone. A month before the presentation of the dance, the groups rent a special house in order to isolate themselves and purify the body and soul of the dancers, especially those who will represent the tigers, lions and monkeys. In addition, they are not allowed to have relations with their wives. A Maya priest directs this tradition. Twenty-six people perform this dance. Musical accompaniment is provided by a simple marimba with one musician."
