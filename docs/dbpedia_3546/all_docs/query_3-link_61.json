        "text": "Summary+\n\nThe Mexican state of Chiapas has the highest indigenous population in the country and the least educated population of any state. The confluence of historical government neglect (in infrastructure and politics), gender inequality, language barriers, and low family income of these populations seriously hinders indigenous ChiapanecosLiving in, coming from, or having ancestral roots in the Mexican state of Chiapas. from receiving a high-quality education—if any education at all. A history of indigenous marginalization and government unwillingness to recognize and remedy this creates a serious roadblock to any permanent change in indigenous education levels. These low levels of education lead to an increase in reproductive health illiteracy, lower occupational attainment and advancement, and decreased political participationAn individual’s participation in political activities, including staying politically informed, voting in elections, or running for political office. Any activities that necessitate cooperation with formal political institutions (e.g., political parties, the state, interest groups).13 in indigenous communities. One practice to begin remedying this issue is to implement Bilingual-Intercultural Education in Intercultural Universities to give indigenous communities greater access to an education that values their cultural background.\n\nKey Takeaways+\n\nGovernment neglect due to corruption in government and the isolation of indigenous communities fuels indigenous educational inaccessibility.\n\nLatin America is the only region in the world where child marriage is on the rise, and 83% of married Mexican girls leave school.\n\nIn ChiapanecLiving in, coming from, or having ancestral roots in the Mexican state of Chiapas. localities, where 70% or more of the population speak an indigenous language, 55.24% are illiterate, compared to the state’s overall illiteracy rate of 13.6%.\n\nChiapas has an adolescent pregnancy rate above 75% of the average distribution which is the highest in Mexico. This rate is commonly associated with indigenous heritage, household poverty, and rural location.\n\nNon-indigenous households in Mexico are 2–3 times as wealthy as indigenous ones.\n\nIndigenous-centered education programs help indigenous students achieve higher education in a way that values their students’ unique cultural heritage, helps preserve culture and language, and promotes development in indigenous communities.\n\nOnly 43% of rural indigenous peoples will complete primary school, 5% will complete secondary school, and 0.7% will attend university.\n\nKey Terms+\n\nChiapanec/o/a—Living in, coming from, or having ancestral roots in the Mexican state of Chiapas.1\n\nCollectivist society—Collectivist cultures emphasize the needs and goals of the group over the needs and desires of each individual. In such cultures, relationships with other members of the group and the interconnectedness between people play a central role in personal identity.2\n\nFormal education—Refers to the learning conducted in a structured education system that runs from primary school to university and includes specialized vocational, technical, and professional training programs. Includes assessments of the learners’ acquired learning on a curriculum and usually leads to recognition and certification.3 It facilitates the structured transmission of basic skills such as reading and writing, as well as social values and knowledge.4\n\nIndigenous—The people who are local, original, or native to a geographic region.5 For many decades, the Mexican government defined indigenous status in the national census based on the language spoken—if one spoke an indigenous language, they were legally classified as indigenous.6 We recognize that this has led to an under-reporting of ethnically indigenous populations for decades.7 Currently, the Mexican government allows citizens to self-report indigenous status in the census.8\n\nInformal sector—All work for financial gain (for instance, both self-employment and wage employment) that is not registered, regulated, or protected by existing legal or regulatory frameworks. Informal workers do not have secure employment contracts, workers’ benefits, social protection, or workers’ representation.9\n\nInternal colonialism—The uneven effects of economic development on a regional basis, otherwise known as “uneven development,” as a result of the exploitation of minority groups in a society, which leads to political and economic inequalities between regions within a state or nation.10\n\nMultidimensional poverty—Encompasses the various deprivations experienced by poor individuals in their daily lives, including consumption, income, educational attainment and enrollment, drinking water, sanitation, and electricity.11,12\n\nPolitical participation—An individual’s participation in political activities, including staying politically informed, voting in elections, or running for political office. Any activities that necessitate cooperation with formal political institutions (e.g., political parties, the state, interest groups).13\n\nRural—Fewer than 2,500 inhabitants, marked by further distance from and without easy access to urban areas, large or small, and the goods, services, and infrastructure provided there.14,15\n\nSelf-advocacy—An individual’s ability to effectively communicate, convey, negotiate, or assert their interests, desires, needs, and rights. Self-advocacy involves making informed decisions and taking responsibility for those decisions.16\n\nSocial mobility—Non-dependence between the initial position of an individual (or household) in the distribution of income and its final position.17 Change in a person’s socio-economic situation about their parents (intergenerational mobility) or throughout their lifetime (intra-generational mobility).18\n\nSubsistence farming—A class of farming where farmers must use nearly all crops or livestock raised to maintain their survival, leaving little, if any, surplus for sale or trade.19\n\nUneducated—Equal to or less than early elementary school education experience. For Chiapas’ indigenous people who speak other languages, it includes the inability to read or speak Spanish properly.\n\nUsos y costumbres—A term for indigenous customary law in Latin America, with indigenous autonomy in governing internal and local affairs.20,21 Since the era of Spanish colonialism, authorities have recognized local forms of rulership, self-governance, and juridical practices with varying degrees of acceptance and formality.22 The term is often used in English without translation and is an umbrella term for Indigenous traditional practices in other areas.23\n\nZapatistas—Members of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), an indigenous armed organization from Chiapas. This group declared war on the Mexican government, demanding “work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice and peace” for indigenous populations after the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994.24 This group remains a strong sociopolitical presence in Chiapas.25\n\nA: The Catholic Church controlled the provision of education in Mexico beginning after the Spanish conquest in 1522 and lasting until Mexican independence in 1821. After 1821, the Church generally ceded educational control to the central government.50 In 1867, primaria was declared free and obligatory, and during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz, educational reforms and programs boomed.51 After the Mexican Revolution in 1910, and under a new constitution, Mexico decentralized education, founded secundarias, and implemented one of the first major reform programs directly targeting indigenousThe people who are local, original, or native to a geographic region.5 For many decades, the Mexican government defined indigenous status in the national census based on the language spoken—if one spoke an indigenous language, they were legally classified as indigenous.6 We recognize that this has led to an under-reporting of ethnically indigenous populations for decades.7 Currently, the Mexican government allows citizens to self-report indigenous status in the census.8 populations.52 Subsequent presidencies continued expanding and refining educational programs, although their long-term effectiveness was questionable due to their cost and inapplicability to indigenous culture.53 Consequently, the famed 1994 Zapatista uprising (indigenous peasant movement) brought global attention to the plight of indigenous peoples. After 11 days of conflict, the ZapatistasMembers of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), an indigenous armed organization from Chiapas. This group declared war on the Mexican government, demanding “work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice and peace” for indigenous populations after the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994.24 This group remains a strong sociopolitical presence in Chiapas.25 entered into negotiations with the Mexican government, pushing for the country to provide a “better quality of life for the indigenous peoples of Chiapas by incorporating their political, economic, and social rights to the Mexican constitution.”54 In the context of the 1994 Zapatista uprising, many indigenous communities in Chiapas promoted long-awaited reform in their local schools.55 However, tensions between Zapatistas and the government have created areas of the state where the government still has no presence and no facilities to provide support. Hence, the extent to which these reforms led to tangible results remains an open question.56 Most recently, The New Educational Model (Nuevo Modelo Educativo), introduced in 2017, restructured the education system “to provide quality education with equity and prepare all students for the 21st century” and give schools more autonomy over curriculum.”57\n\nThe Spanish mistreated and misunderstood the native people of Chiapas to the point where the prevailing social view was of their natural inferiority, exemplified by their “barbarous manners” and “lack of intelligence,” as described by Spanish writers and philosophers of the era.76 This contempt, neglect, and desire to use indigenous people as a natural resource for labor exploitation excluded them even further.77 Today, this legacy of internal colonialismThe uneven effects of economic development on a regional basis, otherwise known as “uneven development,” as a result of the exploitation of minority groups in a society, which leads to political and economic inequalities between regions within a state or nation.10 has created an “uneven development” of the social classes in Chiapas, meaning that the lower indigenous class, who began with virtually nothing, has had to work off of nothing to advance.78,79 Consequently, they have made very little socioeconomic progress.80 The Chiapas population overall experiences better social mobilityNon-dependence between the initial position of an individual (or household) in the distribution of income and its final position.17 Change in a person’s socio-economic situation about their parents (intergenerational mobility) or throughout their lifetime (intra-generational mobility).18 than 25% of the country, indicating a higher socioeconomic position compared to only a quarter of the rest of Mexico.81 According to Mexico’s 2022 National Survey on Discrimination, 71.5% of the indigenous population 12 years and older feel that indigenous peoples are valued poorly by the majority of Mexican society.82 This same report, but from the year 2017, reported that 34.1% of the Mexican population 18 years and older believed that indigenous populations place little value on continuing education and that 34.8% of that same population believed there should not be spaces automatically reserved for indigenous candidates to take part in popular elections.83 As shown, the higher education essential for indigenous peoples is made even more challenging to attain due to their social exclusion and continued marginalization.84\n\nA contributing factor to the lack of access to quality education for rural indigenousThe people who are local, original, or native to a geographic region.5 For many decades, the Mexican government defined indigenous status in the national census based on the language spoken—if one spoke an indigenous language, they were legally classified as indigenous.6 We recognize that this has led to an under-reporting of ethnically indigenous populations for decades.7 Currently, the Mexican government allows citizens to self-report indigenous status in the census.8 populations in Chiapas is historical and continuing corruption at all levels of government, leading to governmental neglect of the region and subsequent unavailability of educational resources and programs. Historically, indigenous Mexicans have been mistreated and marginalized by majority political groups, such as wealthy landowners and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which was the dominant party in Mexican politics for the majority of the 20th century.89 The alliances created within these groups at both national and local levels monopolized governmental interests, leaving indigenous groups overlooked and unprotected.90 These corrupt government officials blocked educational reforms that might have benefitted the state’s indigenous population for their own greed and benefit.91 They used tactics such as ballot-box stuffing, voter intimidation, disqualifying candidates and poll workers of the opposite parties, relocating polling places at the last minute, tampering with vote counts, and letting their supporters vote multiple times.92 These tactics contributed to the Mexican public’s deep-seated distrust of elections and their government through their history of successfully committing electoral fraud.93 Programs meant to improve infrastructure (such as education) and strengthen indigenous communities were “hampered by mismanagement and corruption and did not really change anything in Chiapas except to put more money into the pockets of local politicians and contractors.”94 Some PRI-controlled municipal powers even went so far as to torture and harass indigenous populations.95\n\nAccess to quality education in ChiapanecLiving in, coming from, or having ancestral roots in the Mexican state of Chiapas. communities is restricted based on gender, often due to religious beliefs, definitive gender norms, and sociocultural patterns, leading to the under-enrollment of indigenousThe people who are local, original, or native to a geographic region.5 For many decades, the Mexican government defined indigenous status in the national census based on the language spoken—if one spoke an indigenous language, they were legally classified as indigenous.6 We recognize that this has led to an under-reporting of ethnically indigenous populations for decades.7 Currently, the Mexican government allows citizens to self-report indigenous status in the census.8 boys and (overwhelmingly) girls in school. Indigenous Mexican views on gender roles are informed by long-standing sociocultural norms based on indigenous spiritual traditions. Gender duality constitutes a contrast essential to these traditions, which center around the balancing and opposing forces of masculine and feminine and dictate the importance of these gender differences.129 In collectivist culturesCollectivist cultures emphasize the needs and goals of the group over the needs and desires of each individual. In such cultures, relationships with other members of the group and the interconnectedness between people play a central role in personal identity. like the Indigenous of Southern Mexico, men and women are understood in terms of the roles they fulfill.130 Gender equality thereby becomes an irrelevant and unnecessary concept to this traditional way of thinking where everyone has their role and place, enforced by tradition.131 For example, in agricultural indigenous communities, men raise crops for consumption and sell their surpluses in faraway city markets.132 Women are expected to care for the home, cooking, weaving, and raising children.133 As a result of this generally unquestioned acceptance of adult gender roles, indigenous children and teenagers follow “circumscribed developmental pathways that replicate traditional practices and gender roles” on their way to adulthood.134\n\nThe extremely low income level of indigenousThe people who are local, original, or native to a geographic region.5 For many decades, the Mexican government defined indigenous status in the national census based on the language spoken—if one spoke an indigenous language, they were legally classified as indigenous.6 We recognize that this has led to an under-reporting of ethnically indigenous populations for decades.7 Currently, the Mexican government allows citizens to self-report indigenous status in the census.8 families in ruralFewer than 2,500 inhabitants, marked by further distance from and without easy access to urban areas, large or small, and the goods, services, and infrastructure provided there.14,15 communities restricts their access to education by perpetuating the under-enrollment of indigenous children. Half of Chiapas’ indigenous population “reports no income at all, and another 42% make less than $5 [USD] a day.”150 In comparison, the average daily income in all of Mexico equates to $30.151 In Mexico, the average income was 14% lower among people who belong to a rural indigenous group.152 These families live from subsistence farmingA class of farming where farmers must use nearly all crops or livestock raised to maintain their survival, leaving little, if any, surplus for sale or trade.19, making only as much as they need to survive daily.153 These subsistence farming communities have stayed so poor because Chiapas’ rich natural resources attract large-scale international exporters who overrun the efforts of small indigenous farmers.154 The disconnect between the 21st-century economy and traditional indigenous forms of subsistence living keeps indigenous families, the original inhabitants of this rich land, down in extremely low-income brackets, making under the legal minimum wage.155 To help their parents make ends meet, many indigenous ChiapanecoLiving in, coming from, or having ancestral roots in the Mexican state of Chiapas. children must farm and complete household chores before they can make the trek to school.156 These children often do not have enough time to do both, especially during busy harvest seasons, so they drop out of school.157 School enrollment rates decrease by 23%158 after primaria once students are old enough to contribute more substantially to their family’s funds.159 Unfortunately, only 7 out of 20 students in the poorest rural areas of Chiapas continue to high school because families cannot pay for enrollment, supplies, or transportation to sustain their children’s educational journeys.160\n\nA lack of education and literacy prevents indigenousThe people who are local, original, or native to a geographic region.5 For many decades, the Mexican government defined indigenous status in the national census based on the language spoken—if one spoke an indigenous language, they were legally classified as indigenous.6 We recognize that this has led to an under-reporting of ethnically indigenous populations for decades.7 Currently, the Mexican government allows citizens to self-report indigenous status in the census.8 women from obtaining and understanding vital information about their sexual and reproductive health. This issue uniquely affects young women and girls ages 12–18. Schooling leads to more accurate health beliefs, personal health knowledge, and awareness of health resources.178 Education also leads to better health-related lifestyle choices and increases self-advocacyAn individual’s ability to effectively communicate, convey, negotiate, or assert their interests, desires, needs, and rights. Self-advocacy involves making informed decisions and taking responsibility for those decisions.16 skills, which are essential for young adults in relationships and expecting mothers.179 As of 2022, only 36.3% of the Chiapas population completed primaria,180 and Chiapas currently has the highest rate of adolescent pregnancy for any state in Mexico.181 Mexico has the highest rate of teenage pregnancies among countries in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), exhibiting a fertility rate of 70.6 births for every 1,000 adolescents.182 In a Mexican classroom of 30 teenagers, on average, 2 of them would be pregnant.183 However, the rate for Chiapas falls 75% above this average distribution,184 signifying a rate of 123.55 births for every 1,000 adolescents.185 Thus, in a typical Chiapas classroom of 30 teenagers, 4 of them would be pregnant.186 According to the World Bank, these rates are mainly associated with indigenous heritage, household poverty, and ruralFewer than 2,500 inhabitants, marked by further distance from and without easy access to urban areas, large or small, and the goods, services, and infrastructure provided there.14,15 location.187 Poor, rural, indigenous communities experience high numbers of unmarried adolescent mothers, as well as pregnant adolescent brides.188\n\nThe lack of education keeps families in a low socioeconomic standing and reduces upward mobility in occupation. This consequence occurs because limited education deprives indigenousThe people who are local, original, or native to a geographic region.5 For many decades, the Mexican government defined indigenous status in the national census based on the language spoken—if one spoke an indigenous language, they were legally classified as indigenous.6 We recognize that this has led to an under-reporting of ethnically indigenous populations for decades.7 Currently, the Mexican government allows citizens to self-report indigenous status in the census.8 populations of opportunities for professional growth. Education enhances social mobilityNon-dependence between the initial position of an individual (or household) in the distribution of income and its final position.17 Change in a person’s socio-economic situation about their parents (intergenerational mobility) or throughout their lifetime (intra-generational mobility).18 by providing people with skills and resources to take advantage of greater educational and business opportunities for career and income growth and provide a better quality of life.208 Because of this, the Human Development Index markers are centered around education, tracking literacy rates, school attendance, and more, to study the mean years of education received and the estimated educational attainment for a country or region.209 It was found that the Human Development Index (HDI) for the indigenous population in Mexico is 15% lower than for the non-indigenous population.210 Chiapas also has the lowest HDI in the country, at 0.69 (compared to 0.87 in the county’s most prosperous district).211 This means that most indigenous children, hundreds of thousands of whom live in subsistence or low-wage farming communities, will not have the opportunity or means to move past their parents’ socioeconomic status.212,213 For instance, 52% of Mexican adults with a father in the agricultural sector who now work in the agricultural sector or other similar areas of low-skilled manual labor.214 These findings highlight the intense generational social immobility in Mexico.215\n\nIt is well-documented that electoral participation increases at a higher level of schooling.236 Up until 2006, voter turnout in Mexico’s indigenous communities with lower rates of education ranged between 12.4–5.6% lower than in non-indigenous areas with higher education.237 According to the latest data from 2018, voter turnout in indigenous communities had increased by 14.6% since 2006 and was on par with, or higher than, turnout in non-indigenous communities,238 correlating with an increase in academic performance and access nationwide due to education reforms.239 However, there is no typical pattern of electoral behavior or political leaning among them.240 In some communities, pressure from the dominant political parties elicits a strong indigenous vote to stay in good federal graces241 and eliminate the threat of municipal administrators sent from the federal government to set up a repeat election (and embezzle community funds).242 For example, a government grant program for people in poverty called the National Solidarity Program was headed by the leader of the era’s dominant political party, the PRI.243 Subsequently, these grants were generously allocated in poor, ruralFewer than 2,500 inhabitants, marked by further distance from and without easy access to urban areas, large or small, and the goods, services, and infrastructure provided there.14,15 areas where the party faced difficult elections, and recipients were expected to become “loyal cogs in the PRI electoral machine.”244 Despite the high electoral participation of many Indigenous communities, there remained a significant gap in their legislative representation, fueled by this root cause of lower educational access.245 Due to the low level of education in Indigenous communities, these communities also experienced lower levels of female participation in politics at the community level. This gender divide demonstrates the effects of the low level of education due to the aforementioned female student dropout rates. Many of these communities resisted change to this policy, stressing their normative community systems of usos y costumbresA term for indigenous customary law in Latin America, with indigenous autonomy in governing internal and local affairs.20,21 Since the era of Spanish colonialism, authorities have recognized local forms of rulership, self-governance, and juridical practices with varying degrees of acceptance and formality.22 The term is often used in English without translation and is an umbrella term for Indigenous traditional practices in other areas.23, or indigenous customary law, in place of support for political parties.246 Most municipalities in Chiapas elect their governing body through this system, the laws of which sometimes exclude women from participation.247 For example, in Chiapas’ “sister state” of Oaxaca, where the usos and costumbres system is also common, 18% of municipalities had a ban on female participation as late as 2015.248\n\nThough Bilingual-Intercultural Education at Intercultural Universities is used to increase the access to and quality of education for indigenous ChiapanecoLiving in, coming from, or having ancestral roots in the Mexican state of Chiapas. communities, it is difficult to find detailed research into its impact. In 2022, the student enrollment at UNICH was 1,746, and its central campus experienced a 67.4% growth in enrollment since the previous year.280 The whole UNICH system experienced a 32.6% growth in enrollment from 2018 to 2022.281 Of the 9 IUs in Mexico that report their yearly enrollment statistics, 6 have experienced net growth in enrollment over the last year.282,283,284,285,286 One study found that Intercultural Universities generally saw 1.5 times more female than male students,287 and in 2022, UNICH specifically saw a 45% male student body and 55% female study body.288 This trend demonstrates how Intercultural Universities are remedying educational disparities in more areas than indigenous status. This study also found that around two-thirds of IU students were “native speakers of indigenous languages,” demonstrating the potential for intercultural understanding and prioritization of indigenous languages in these schools.289 Another investigation into the impact of these universities on their students found that students felt they had become able to navigate between different worlds: “the urban and rural, mestizo and indigenous, native language and Spanish.”290 These students were able to find job placement as translators and other positions within development projects at the local and governmental levels.291 The communities working with Intercultural Universities have also seen “transformatory effects” in the promotion of sustainable livelihoods and the number of students entering higher education due to these strong relationships.292 IUs have been able to create programs that are relevant to indigenous students, thereby reducing outmigration from their communities of origin.293\n\nWhile indigenous-centered education programs can effectively increase access to and quality of education for indigenousThe people who are local, original, or native to a geographic region.5 For many decades, the Mexican government defined indigenous status in the national census based on the language spoken—if one spoke an indigenous language, they were legally classified as indigenous.6 We recognize that this has led to an under-reporting of ethnically indigenous populations for decades.7 Currently, the Mexican government allows citizens to self-report indigenous status in the census.8 communities in Chiapas, there is still room for improvement. As previously observed, there has been little research into the impact of these programs on students and their future outcomes. Universities have also faced difficulty implementing the lofty theories of intercultural tertiary education into practice.294 Due to their status as public educational institutions created by the federal government, there is tension between their theories advancing decolonial education and equity and the fact that the program was created by a government institution that “traditionally privileges Western and neoliberal epistemologies and ideologies.”295 Despite these universities’ focus on indigenous culture and knowledge, they also need to prepare students to navigate the mainstream Western world and meet global higher education standards, which adds to the tension in this form of education for indigenous people.296 There is a need to strike a delicate balance between these ideals, which is a challenging and imperfect process. Due to the governmental influence and support that powers these universities, they may also face “bureaucratic, financial, academic and political” obstacles to their programs and goals.297"
