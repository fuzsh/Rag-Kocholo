        "text": "Agnes Herman (1062-29 December 1125) was the Abbess of Quedlinburg from 1110 to 1125. The granddaughter of Emperor Henry III of Germany and the daughter of King Wladyslaw I Herman of Poland, she was descended from many European nobles.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHerman was the daughter of King Wladyslaw Herman of Poland and Judith of Bohemia, and was also the granddaughter of Emperor Henry III of Germany. A natural negotiator and good diplomat, she was used to gain agreements with foreign empires. From 1080 onwards, her father King Wladyslaw sent Agnes Herman to negotiate with entities such as Novgorod, Hungary, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Byzantine Empire, and she was able to charm her way into achieving trade agreements and map information."
