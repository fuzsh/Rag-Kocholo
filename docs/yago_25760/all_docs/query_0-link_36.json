It was never used, however. Augustus II’s regalia are kept in Dresden’s Armoury (RÃ¼stkammer) in Germany but are to be moved to the Royal Palace when it has been finally rebuilt.\n\nBoleslaus the Brave’s Crown, the royal crown of the Polish kings (14th century) and the queen’s crown, alongside with the orbs, the sceptres and four other Polish royal crowns, one orb and three sceptres were stolen by Prussian troops from the Royal Treasury at Cracow in 1795, carried away to Prussia and finally destroyed in 1809/11 on the order of the king of Prussia Frederick William III.\n\nThe Crown of Boleslaus the Brave (14th century)\n\nHISTORY OF THE POLISH REGALIA\n\nBY MARIUSZ PAÅ¹DZIORA\n\nPoland witnessed its first coronation in 1025, when Boleslaus I the Brave was crowned King of Poland at Gniezno Cathedral. Several years later, amid political turmoil, Polish regalia were taken by Queen Rycheza, the consort of Boleslaus the Brave’s successor, King Mieszko II, to Germany and handed over to the emperor. As a reward, the Emperor Conrad II allowed Rycheza to retain the queen’s crown. In 1633, when her tomb in Cologne was opened, the said crown was found inside, but later - like the king’s crown six centuries earlier - it too, disappeared.\n\nThe next king of Poland, Boleslaus II the Bold and his consort had to order new crowns for their coronation in 1076. Boleslaus the Bold’s regalia were used during the successive Polish coronations of Przemysl II and his consort Margaret of Brandenburg in 1295, and of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia in 1300. Following his coronation in Gniezno, Wenceslaus II took the Polish crown with him to Prague, where it disappeared for good. No images of the first two sets of Polish regalia have survived to the present day, if they ever existed at all.\n\nLadislaus I the Short, who following a long period of mediaeval fragmentation, united Poland into one kingdom, had no other choice but to order a new set of regalia, the third such in Polish history, for his and his consort’s coronation in 1320. Apart from new crowns the king introduced a new coronation venue: Cracow replaced Gniezno as the place of royal coronations. Although the new Polish crown had nothing to do with Poland’s first king Boleslaus I the Brave, it was soon to be universally known as, and referred to, as Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown. It went down in history under this very name. The name was most probably adopted in order to underline the continuity of the Polish monarchy and its ancient traditions associated with the famous meeting of Duke Boleslaus the Brave and Emperor Otto III in AD 1000 at Gniezno, when the emperor placed a crown, or a royal diadem, on Boleslaus the Brave’s head, what was seen by many contemporaries as Boleslaus’s coronation and the recognition of Poland’s sovereignty by the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Polish royal crown, Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown, like most European regalia, had a turbulent and exciting history before it was destroyed on the orders of the Prussian king, Frederick William III, in the early 19th century. Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown consisted of ten gold segments in shaped as fleurs-de-lis arched with four hoops surmounted with a gold globe and a cross on its top. The hoops and the globe and the cross were probably late 14th century additions, as initially the Polish crown was a corona aperta. Later additions had changed the character of the crown creating the corona clausa, like most European crowns. The ten gold segments of the crown could be detached from one another and duly adjusted to the proportions of the royal head. The last king of Poland, Stanislaus II Augustus, had the crown adjusted for his coronation in 1764, so that he used only eight of the ten fleur-de-lis segments. Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown was adorned with a substantial number of pearls, rubies, emeralds and sapphires. Each gold segment contained ten pearls, eleven big gemstones and twenty small ones, which added up to an imposing number of one hundred pearls, one hundred and ten large gems and two hundred small ones. According to a 1609 account of the Polish regalia kept at the Royal Treasury in Cracow, the king’s crown was adorned with 396 gems and pearls. In 1730 the number increased to 454, and in 1792, three years before the Prussian theft of the Polish regalia, to 474! In contrast to the earlier mediaeval Polish regalia, Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown was depicted on several occasions. Apart from royal portraits it was documented in a 1764 drawing by Marcello Bacciarelli, the court painter of the unfortunate Stanislaus II Augustus, and at about the same time it was painted-alongside with other Polish regalia used for Stanislaus II’s coronation-by Jan Krzysztof Werner.\n\nBoleslaus the Brave’s Crown was the most venerated item of the Polish regalia, which can be compared to the Hungarians’ veneration of St Stephen’s Crown, as almost all Polish kings, starting with Ladislaus I the Short in 1320 were crowned with it. The Polish royal crown was therefore associated with the most fortunate period in Polish history, when Poland emerged united under Ladislaus the Short and soon made her way up as one of the major political powers in Europe. The Piast Dynasty, which descended from Poland’s first king, Boleslaus I the Brave and his ancestors, died out with Casimir III the Great in 1370. That same year the Angevins of Hungary ascended the Polish throne. Louis the Great of Hungary was crowned king of Poland in Cracow (1370) and returned shortly thereafter to Hungary, taking Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown with him. When Louis the Great’s daughter Hedvig was to be crowned as the next sovereign of Poland in 1384, a new crown had to be ordered for the occasion, as King Louis’s widow, Elizabeth of Bosnia, refused to return Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown to Polish hands. It is not known which crown Hedvig was crowned with, but it is quite possible that the Polish queen’s crown from 1320 was used, as King Louis the Great took with him to Hungary only the king’s regalia, leaving the remaining Polish regalia in Cracow.\n\nIn 1385 Poland and Lithuania entered a long lasting union. The Grand Duke of Lithuania, Jagiello, married Queen Hedvig of Poland and in 1386 he was duly crowned king of Poland as Ladislaus II JagieÅÅo. As Elizabeth of Bosnia continued to refuse to hand over the Polish royal crown, \"a new crown of gold and precious stones\" was made for the king, according to a Polish chronicler. Not much is known about the new crown, nor what finally happened to it. In spite of ordering a new crown, Ladislaus II JagieÅÅo had not given up pressing the Hungarians for the return of Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown. Finally in 1412 the new Hungarian king, Sigismund of Luxembourg, returned the Polish crown. It was then transferred to Cracow, where amid joyful celebrations the crown and other regalia were exhibited in Our Lady’s church for all to see. It was the first public exhibition of the Polish national regalia.\n\nThe next king to be crowned with Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown was the unfortunate Ladislaus III of Varna in 1434. Thirteen Polish kings after him were crowned with it, ending with Stanislaus II Augustus in 1764. There were only three exceptions. Stephen Batory was crowned with the so called Hungarian crown in 1576, as his political opponents locked up Boleslaus the Brave’s crown in the Royal Treasury in Cracow, in an attempt to prevent Stephen Batory’s coronation.\n\nA modern copy of the Crown of Boleslaus the Brave\n\nPhoto: Piotr DroÅºdzik, Â©Adam Orzechowski; http://www.replikiregaliowpl.com/\n\nPoland in the early 18th century was a country in turmoil: Augustus II, supported by Russia, had been dethroned, giving way to Stanislaus I, who was supported by Sweden. With the Swedish occupation of parts of Poland, Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown was in 1702 taken abroad to safety in Silesia and hidden there. In 1705 Stanislaus I LeszczyÅski (whose daughter Maria was Louis XV’s consort and Queen of France) was crowned in Warsaw under Swedish protection with a crown which was especially prepared for the occasion by the Swedes. A Polish chronicler of the time remarked that the gold crown was taken away from the king right after his coronation and quickly used to strike coins for the Swedish troops. Five years after his coronation, following the Swedish defeat at Poltava, Stanislaus I was dethroned by victorious Russian troops, who then restored Augustus II. Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown and the other regalia were returned to Cracow in 1730. In 1733 Stanislaus I was reelected king of Poland. A minority of the electorate opted for Augustus III, son of Augustus II. Poland found itself again in turmoil and once again the Polish regalia were hidden, in order not to allow the coronation of Augustus III, who enjoyed Russia’s support.\n\nStanislaus I had the chance to wear Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown in 1733 when he was restored to the Polish throne. The king appeared in the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw in the splendour of the Polish regalia, wearing Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown which had been hidden in the very same church. But this was not a coronation, as the validity of the 1705 coronation was recognised. Soon, however, Russian troops supporting Augustus III approached Warsaw and Stanislaus I was forced to flee Poland one more time. The Polish regalia were taken to the Jasna GÃ³ra monastery in Czestochowa and hidden there in order not to allow Augustus III to be crowned king of Poland. But Augustus III was fully prepared for such a possibility. In 1733 he had a new set of regalia made in Saxony for his Polish coronation and was duly crowned with them in 1734 at Cracow. In 1736 the opponents of Augustus III gave up and finally handed over Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown to the Royal Treasury in Cracow, where it remained until 1795.\n\nPoland witnessed its last coronation in 1764 (1), this time in Warsaw, where the last king of Poland, Stanislaus II Augustus, was crowned with the entire splendour of the Polish regalia. Prior to the coronation an unusual exhibition had taken place: for the first time for centuries the Polish regalia, brought especially for the coronation from Cracow, were put on public display in Warsaw’s Royal Castle. The last public display of the Polish regalia took place in 1792 at Cracow’s Royal Castle. The last inventory of Polish regalia was drawn up prior to the exhibition by a special parliamentary commission. The 1792 inventory of Polish regalia included:\n\n1. The King’s crown, the so called Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown or corona originalis sive privilegiata.\n\n2. The Queen’s crown.\n\n3. The Homage crown or corona homagialis.\n\n4. The so called Hungarian crown.\n\n5. The so called Swedish crown.\n\n6. Four sceptres.\n\n7. Five orbs.\n\n8. Four swords, including the coronation sword of Polish kings, Szczerbiec.\n\nThe final decades of the 18th century proved especially disastrous for Poland. The kingdom suffered three partitions initiated by Russia, Prussia and Austria in 1772, 1793 and finally in 1795, which effectively erased the Polish Kingdom from the map of Europe. Following the second partition, the Poles organised a national insurrection the aim of which was to save the rump of Poland from foreign occupation. The result was just the reverse: the Russians, Prussians and Austrians occupied and effectively divided the rump of Poland among themselves. In 1794 Prussian troops captured Cracow and, as Cracow was to be given over to the Austrians, the Prussian king, Frederick William II, gave an immediate order to plunder the Polish Crown Treasury. In 1795, a few months before handing over Cracow to the Austrians, the Prussians stormed the powerful gates of the Polish Royal Treasury and stole all the Polish regalia inside it, including Boleslaus the Brave’s Crown. The assault was carried out secretly, as the Prussian king was afraid of Austrian and Russian reactions to this unprecedented act of barbarity. Before the Prussian garrison left Cracow in January 1796, the Polish regalia were carried away to Prussian Silesia and then to Berlin. The Austrians having discovered this unbelievable theft, made an immediate written account of what they saw in the treasury following the takeover of Cracow from Prussian hands. It was corroborated by numerous witnesses.\n\nThe Duchy of Warsaw which emerged under Napoleon Bonaparte’s auspices, demanded that the Polish regalia be returned by the Prussian king. The Prussians did not bother to answer, and the Poles did not press hard enough for the return of the regalia. In 1800 Augustus Duke of Sussex had a chance to see for himself the stolen Polish regalia, during his visit to Berlin. In his account to a Polish friend, the Duke of Sussex said that during that visit \"A crown of your kings was placed on my head\". The account of the Duke of Sussex is an important piece of evidence corroborating the Prussians’ responsibility for the theft of the Polish regalia. Nine years after the Duke of Sussex tried on Boleslaus the Brave’s crown, the Polish regalia were sent to KÃ¶nigsberg and destroyed on the personal orders of Frederick William III, King of Prussia. The gold obtained from the regalia (over 25 pounds) was used by the Prussians to mint gold coins, while the numerous gemstones and the pearls were sold. In 1700 the so called Crown of Muscovy, ordered for the coronation of Polish Crown Prince Ladislaus (later Ladislaus IV) as the czar of Russia, was pawned with Elector Frederick, later king of Prussia. This crown, too, was destroyed in 1809 along with the remaining Polish regalia.\n\nThe regalia of King Augustus III (1734)\n\nThe Kingdom of Poland created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was nothing more than a Russian protectorate. The Russian czars wanted to keep an illusion of Polish \"independence\", therefore both Alexander I and Nicholas I insisted on being crowned in Warsaw. On several occasions the czars had demanded the Polish regalia to be returned to them, but the King of Prussia remained silent. The only piece of Polish regalia which escaped destruction at Prussian hands was the coronation sword of the Polish kings, the thirteenth century Szczerbiec (\"the nicked\"). It was later sold to a Russian agent who then sold it to a Russian antique collector. The sword changed hands several times in course of the 19th century and finally it was purchased by the Russian czar in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Petersburg. But the turbulent history of the coronation sword of the Polish kings did not end here. In 1928, eight years after the Soviet defeat in the Polish-Soviet war of 1920, the Soviet government fulfilled one of its commitments to return the most important historical artifacts stolen by the Russians in Poland and the returned objects included the coronation sword of the Polish kings. Szczerbiec remained in Poland for barely eleven years. Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, the sword and other treasures from the Royal Collections in Cracow, were shipped to Rumania, then to France and finally to Canada. They were returned to Poland in 1959 and the coronation sword of the Polish kings has been on display at Cracow’s Royal Castle ever since.\n\nApart from Szczerbiec, the only Polish regalia which have been preserved down to our own times are the crowns, sceptres and orbs used for the 1734 coronation of Augustus III of Saxony and his consort Maria Josepha. Augustus III’s regalia were ordered in 1733 just a few months before the intended coronation. The crowns were made of gilded silver by a Saxon goldsmith, Heinrich KÃ¶hler. Originally the regalia were adorned with precious gemstones, but later these were replaced with imitations. Both crowns are closed (coronae clausae) and surprisingly no cross surmounts any of them. Each of them is arched with four hoops. The king’s crown is adorned with seventeen big rubies and twelve smaller ones, sixteen big sapphires, ten smaller ones and a huge one on the crown’s top. Further, the crown is adorned with ten big emeralds and twenty-four small ones, and finally with fifty-six diamonds. The queen’s crown is adorned with one hundred and thirty-nine diamonds and pearls. Following Augustus III’s coronation, the regalia were taken back to Warsaw, but later removed to Dresden, where Augustus III resided, visiting Warsaw only on a few occasions. Augustus III’s regalia remained in Dresden’s GrÃ¼nes GewÃ¶lbe until 1924, when the Saxon Landtag returned them to the former king of Saxony, Frederick Augustus III. Frederick Augustus III, who was a well-known collector of china figurines, exchanged Augustus III’s regalia for precious china figurines from a Viennese antique shop. In 1925 the Polish government purchased Augustus III’s regalia in Vienna for 175,000 zlotys (c. $ 35,000). The regalia were exhibited at Warsaw’s Royal Castle until 1939. Following the German occupation of Poland in 1939 the regalia were hidden by the employees of the National Museum in Warsaw, but were soon discovered by the Germans. In 1940 they were taken to Cracow by order of the German governor general of occupied Poland, Hans Frank. Soon, however, they were sent back to Warsaw and in the summer of 1944, alongside with thousands of other artifacts stolen from Polish museums, they were dispatched to Germany. The crowns were found by Soviet troops in Germany and then sent to the USSR where they remained until 1960. In 1960 the Soviets decided to return the crowns to their satellite, communist Poland. Augustus III’s regalia were deposited in Warsaw’s National Museum where they are kept.\n\nNOTES:\n\n(1) Last coronation as an independent country.
