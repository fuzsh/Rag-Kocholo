The Chronica Boemorum names (in order) \"Iudithæ et Ludmilæ, similiter Bracislai iunioris et Wratislai, qui in primo flore iuventutis occidit XIII Kal Dec\" as children of \"ductrix Adleyth\". In the same passage, the chronicler records that one of Duke Vratislav's daughters, unnamed and without specifying by which marriage, married \"duci Polonico\". The Chronicæ Polanorum refers to the wife of King Wladyslaw as \"filiam Wratislavi Bohemici regis\".\n\nThe Chronica Boemorum records the death \"1085 VIII Kal Ian\" of \"Iuditha coniux Wladizlai ducis Poloniorum, quæ fuit filia Wratizlai ducis Boemorum\". The Annales Capituli Cracoviensis record the death in 1086 of \"Iudith mater sua [Bolezslaus tertius]\". The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum records that she died from the effects of childbirth. 1"
