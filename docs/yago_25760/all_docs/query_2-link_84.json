        "text": "This was such a lucky find, I am still pinching myself that I came across it at a U3A bookswap just before all U3A classes were shut down.\n\nThe table of contents gives a good indication as to why I was so pleased to find it:\n\nDaisy White: An Accomplished Schoolgirl in France, 1887-1889\n\nTrouble in Bohemia: the Belle Epoque Novels of Tasma, 1891 and 1895\n\nDigger Nurses on the Western Front, 1916-1919\n\nStella Bowen’s ‘education of another sort’: the Paris Years, 1922-1933\n\n‘All that Glitters’: Illusory Worlds in Christina Stead’s The Beauties and Furies (1936) and House of All Nations (1938)\n\n‘No Time to Be Frail’: Nancy Wake, Resistance Heroines, 1940-1944\n\nI’ve read The Beauties and Furies (see here) but I’m ‘saving’ the chapter about Christina Stead until I’ve read House of All Nations, which is on the TBR. And although I don’t have it yet, I’m also leaving the chapter about Stella Bowen till I’ve either tracked down or given up looking for Drawn from Life (which is her memoir of her life in Paris with Ford Madox Ford). (Update 20/1/21, see my review of Drawn from Life here.) Australian author Debbie Robson read it as research for her trilogy and she has written an enticing review of it at Goodreads. Stella Bowen is known to many Australians as a war artist, and in particular for her painting ‘Bomber Crew’ which was recently featured on a commemorative stamp for Anzac Day so I would like to read her book if I can find a copy of it. So this review is only about the other four chapters…\n\nDaisy White was an inspired choice to begin the book. She and her sister Dorothy were parked in a finishing school Paris by her middle-class Australian parents who quickly left them to it. As Rosemary Lancaster puts it:\n\nDaisy was sixteen and Dorothy fourteen when they left Sydney in 1887. The diary of what followed, covering the years 1887-89, is an historical jewel and rare document: such is the detail, the gusto, the wit and insight and mind-set of a nineteenth-century Australian schoolgirl abroad. Full of verve and introspections, of rich perceptions, of adolescent grudges and high hopes, it traces Daisy’s school life as a near-daily unfolding of cultural discovery, tempered by boarding-house ritual and classroom grind. In the two years of her Parisian stay Daisy changed from being a reluctant schoolgirl into an accomplished woman, fluent in French and, in her opinion, rather wise than when she set sail. (p.2)\n\nThere are many interesting aspects to Daisy’s account of her Parisian life. She wasn’t much interested in the social aspirations that mattered so much to her parents that they were willing to abandon such young girls, but she thrived on experiencing great literature and art. Despite this, she was peeved that the curriculum at Les Ruches was less engaging than her Australian education where physical geography, physics and chemistry, and nature ‘under all forms’ were, in her opinion, ‘some of the most delightful studies ever to charm a student. Alas, arithmetic at Les Ruches was described as ‘simply insupportable’, chemistry as ‘a little more bearable’ and physics as ‘simply beastly, drier than bone-dust, and pretty hard to understand.’ From Lancaster’s analysis we can gather that Daisy’s Sydney school was progressive, because she learned sciences as well as the two usual areas of knowledge, which were subjects such as English, literature, composition and grammar, elementary mathematics, history and geography, even elocution and calligraphy; and also the ‘accomplishments’ (music, drawing and modern languages; dancing, needlework, callisthenics, and sometimes more unusual crafts). She must have had good teachers of French in Australia too, because all the lessons at Les Ruches were in French and yet she achieved excellent results. Daisy doesn’t hold back in her opinions about the teachers at Les Ruches, but they can’t have been all that bad!\n\nHer school calendar, however, also included chaperoned excursions to cultural activities, including visits to galleries, monuments, theatres, parks, boulevards, shops and gardens. She went everywhere: the Louvre, Notre-Dame, Sainte-Chapelle, the Panthéon, and Napoleon’s Tomb. She saw France’s most-loved plays, and this cultural saturation developed an aesthetic sensibility that is remarkable in one so young. It is almost painful to read that we know almost nothing about her return to Australia, except that she died of cardiac failure, aged only thirty two.\n\nThe next chapter, about Jessie Couvrier a.k.a. ‘Tasma’ is more literary, and there’s not so much about her life. I haven’t read any of Tasma’s Parisian novels, and don’t intend to, despite Lancaster’s suggestion that they are of academic interest. I might one day read Uncle Piper of Piper’s Hill (1889), (which gets a mention in Jean-François Vernay’s A Brief Take on the Australian Novel and his The Great Australian Novel, a Panorama. See also Bill’s review at The Australian Legend). But the Parisian romances, The Penance of Portia James and Not Counting the Cost, just don’t appeal, even if they are unique social and literary documents. Nonetheless, it is interesting to read about Tasma’s time in the Bohemian ambience of the Latin Quarter and how she used the city’s legendary reputation as a site of freedom and decadence in her novels.\n\nTasma constructs an anti-Antipodean world, about as remote from Australia as one could have imagined in her time — awesome, unsettling for her ingenuous heroines, but also lively, morally unfettered and open to lifestyles women of their colonial kind were unlikely to have led. Leading her heroines through pockets of Parisian exotica, she penetrates the city’s social and physical heart. But for Portia, in Portia James, Paris proves to be a terra incognita, and for Eila of Not Counting the Cost, a deceptive myth. (p.34)\n\nAt the same time, by referencing her characters’ attachment to and memories of the land of their birth, Tasma was able to create an exotic atmosphere for her European readers, and by writing in the fringe genre of romance, she was also able to offer women protagonists and depict the problems they faced in a patriarchal society. Like Catherine Helen Spence in Mr Hogarth’s Will (see my review), Tasma is not much enamoured of marriage:\n\nMarriage, is it is at present understood, is the most foolish and suicidal step a woman can take. Why should we bind ourselves to belie for the remainder of our natural lives our real natures, our real selves, as expressed in the new instincts, prompting, or desires we may feel? Why, in short, should the union of a man and a woman, which is meaningless and worth nothing without mutual inclination, be made the occasion of vows and oaths, and so-called binding ceremonies, which are not binding at all when the inclination is gone? (p.39)\n\nTasma had good reason to feel this way because her marriage to a drunken gambler ended in divorce in 1883, and in colonial society, she would have had to bear the stigma and blame for it.\n\nChapter 3 is based on letters and diaries of women who nursed on the Western Front, in a dangerous blighted environment far from the delights of Paris. Back in 2013, I reviewed a wonderful book called Kitty’s War by Janet Butler, and it was a revelation to discover just how much danger these nurses were in, and yet how little recognition they have had. This chapter which runs to 32 pages, is a comprehensive account of the long hours and the appalling conditions, with quotations that leave no doubt as to the courage of those who quietly attended to the behind-the-scenes havoc of the theatres of war.\n\nToday I had to assist at ten (10) amputations one after another. It is frightfully nerve racking work. I seem to hear that wretched saw at work whenever I try to sleep. We see the most ghastly wounds and are all day long inhaling the odour of gas gangrene. How these boys suffer! This war is absolute hell. We see and hear all day and every day the results of its frightfulness. We can hear the guns quite plainly here. (Staff Nurse Elsie Tranter, aged 29, at Wimereux on the Picardy coastline, p. 60)\n\nGeneral hospitals were vulnerable to air raids as the war went on, but the most perilous work was in the casualty clearing stations at the edge of the battlefields, where, as the front moved back and forth, the CCS were subjected to bombardment and constantly having to evacuate at short notice. The danger was so great that nurses were not supposed to work in them, ‘until events left no alternative.’ Things were even more difficult for nurses assigned to French hospitals in the French sector. As well as the language barrier, there were cultural issues and significant differences in nursing standards compared to British nursing which had developed under Florence Nightingale. What is really astonishing is how many of these nurses stayed after the jubilation of armistice, to nurse the victims of the Spanish Flu which claimed over 50 million lives. One can’t help but feel intensely proud of these women.\n\nLikewise, there’s a sense of pride about the exploits of the decorated Resistance heroine Nancy Wake. Her story is well known and I’ve read her autobiography The White Mouse (1985) but still, it was interesting to be reminded of the humour and matter-of-factness with which she faced the trials of war.\n\nAs the Liberator bomber circled over the dropping zone in France I could see lights flashing and huge bonfires burning. I hoped the field was manned by the Resistance and not by German ambushers. Huddled in the belly of the bomber, airsick and vomiting, I was hardly Hollywood’s idea of a glamorous spy. I probably looked grotesque.\n\nOver civilian clothes, silk-stockinged and high-heeled, I wore overalls, carried revolvers in the pockets, and topped the lot with a bulky camel-haired coat, webbing harness, parachute and tin hat. Even more incongruous was the matronly hand-bag, full of cash and secret instructions for D-day. My ankles were bandaged for support when I hit the ground.\n\nBut I’d spent years in France working as an escape courier. I’d walked out across the Pyrenees and joined the Special Operations Executive in England, and I was desperate to return to France and continue working against Hitler. Neither airsickness nor looking like a clumsily wrapped parcel was going to deter me. (p.151-2)\n\nLancaster also includes details about Wake’s pre-war discovery of Paris and how she adored living and working there as a freelance reporter. She married during the Phony War, and had a wonderful time, indulging in an extravagant lifestyle which she had never experienced before. In the early years of her war, Wake used this as a cover:\n\n...posing as the real rich wife of a well-known businessman and a fancy-free lady, both ostensibly given to travel and holidays, while, in fact, she was working extensively along the coast clandestinely shuttling fugitives and information from place to place. Her femininity she exploited, knowing — as did other resisters — that attractive young women were less likely to be suspected of covert acts. She capitalised, too, on the public freedom women had: shops, streets and train stations were places they had always frequented: carrying out errands was one of their accepted domestic tasks. (p. 159)\n\nStill, we all know the terrible fate that lay in store if she was captured. Torture, and then execution. Her story is breath-taking…\n\nThis book is a treasure!\n\nFrom the UWAP website:\n\nRosemary Lancaster is the author of numerous articles on French literature, culture and pedagogy.\n\nA former senior lecturer and convener of French studies at the University of Western Australia, in 2005 Lancaster was awarded the title of Chevalier de l’Ordre des Palmes académiques by the French government for services to French culture abroad.\n\nAuthor: Rosemary Lancaster\n\nTitle: Je Suis Australienne, Remarkable Women in France, 1880-1945\n\nPublisher: UWAP (University of Western Australia Press), 2008\n\nISBN: 9781921401138, pbk., 187 pages not including the extensive notes, index and bibliography\n\nSource: U3A bookswap"
