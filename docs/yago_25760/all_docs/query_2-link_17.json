        "text": "Judy does a little Jane Russell impression.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThinking of Jane Russell reminds me of Old Hollywood — which reminds me of Cary Grant — which brings up the inevitable: Juday – Juday – Juday.\n\nHow many times have I heard a bad Cary Grant impersonator utter this phrase. When it turns out, Cary Grant never actually said it.\n\nPeter Bogdanovich believes that the genesis of the imitation came from Grant’s delivery in several lines in Only Angels Have Wings.. ‘In the film his former girl friend is called Judith or Judy (played by Rita Hayworth). Cary has lines like “Hello, Judy. Come on, Judy. Now, Judy.” But he never said “Judy, Judy, Judy.” ‘\n\nJudy Quine has another explanation: ‘Cary told me back in 1955 that when he did the Lux Radio Theater, they used his voice introduction for Judy Garland, who was a guest for the following week. He recalled some banter where he could have said “Judy, Judy, Judy” but he wasn’t sure.’ (1)\n\nOf course, I scoured hours of movie clips and could not find anything close. So instead, I give you the comedy of Cary Grant in The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947).\n\n(1) http://www.CaryGrant.net: Judy\n\nWe forget the Good Old Days weren’t always so good.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThis song by The Pipettes is kind of … sad.\n\nI knew a girl and her name was Judy / She used to do things I thought were rude\n\nBut I never said anything to her face /’ Cuz my friends I thought she’d kick my arse all over the place\n\nUsed to think she was kinda cool / I saw her walking all around the school\n\nAll the older boys would stop and turn their heads / All the older girls wished that she was dead\n\nJudy, whatcha gonna do? / When you’re older and no one wants to know ya?\n\nI will look out for you / If you will look out for me\n\nI know I’m not as hard as you / But I think I can see right through you\n\nNow me and Judy we’re the best of pals / She took me dancing to the early hours\n\nAnd showed me things I’ve never seen / Mum always asked me where I’d been\n\nwhen I’m with\n\nJudy, whatcha gonna do? / When you’re older and no one wants to know ya?\n\nI will look out for you / If you will look out for me\n\nI know I’m not as hard as you / But I think I can see right through you\n\nWhen you go home at night / Are you still looking for a fight?\n\nYou know your mum is not that mean / But still you want to rip out her spleen.\n\nJudy, whatcha gonna do? / When you’re older and no one wants to know ya?\n\nI will look out for you / If you will look out for me\n\nI know I’m not as hard as you / But I think I can see right through you\n\nsometimes I’m embarrassed by stupidity. like now.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nSpeaking of feeling stupid, this song was written after Fred Bronson – of John Fred and His Playboy Band – mistakenly thought The Beatles hit “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” was “Lucy in Disguise with Diamonds.”\n\nI hate it when that happens.\n\nJudy in disguise, well that’s what you are\n\nLemonade pie with a brand new car.\n\nCantalope eyes come to me tonight\n\nJudy in disguise with glasses.\n\nKeep a-wearing your bracelets and your new rara.\n\nCross your heart with your living bra.\n\nChimney sweep sparrow with guise.\n\nJudy in disguise with glasses\n\nCome to me tonight, come to me tonight,\n\nTaking everything in sight,\n\nExcept for the strings on my kite.\n\nJudy in disguise, well what you aiming for,\n\nA circus of horrors, yeah, well that’s what you are.\n\nYou made me a life of ashes, I guess I’ll just take your glasses."
