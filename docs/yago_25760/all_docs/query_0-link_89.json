        "text": "Many a time the worst things happen on a deed made with the best intentions. A nation gets broken up for centuries over a will, ushering an era dominated by foreign rulers.\n\nBolesław was born in 1086 to Władysław Herman, Duke of Poland and Judith of Bohemia. He also had an illegitimate half brother, Zbigniew. Władysław had become Duke after his elder brother, Bolesław, was deposed in 1079 by the nobles and the clergy. 1/10\n\nThe senior Bolesław and his predecessors had taken an expansionist view for Poland, becoming a regional power player. In 1076, Bolesław was crowned King, but was seen by the nobles and the clergy as becoming too powerful. 2/10\n\nWładysław Herman was a weak ruler, dominated by those who made him ruler. But one of them, Sieciech, wrested most of the control for himself, perhaps causing the death of the initial heir, Mieszko, son of Bolesław. But the opposition to Sieciech also grew in the court. 3/10\n\nIn 1097, Władysław made Zbigniew and Bolesław commanders of the army. The two brothers joined forces and got rid off Sieciech and sought a division of power with their father. The elder Zbigniew received Greater Poland, while the legitimate Bolesław Lesser Poland. 4/10\n\nBut the death of their father in 1102 led to a division of powers, Zbigniew getting the northern half, while Bolesław the southern half. The initial years as co-rulers were spend in conflict with each other, as Bolesław raided Pomerania in the north and Moravia in the south. 5/10\n\nBy 1107, Bolesław had control of the whole of Poland, with some help from Bohemia, and exiled Zbigniew. But in 1109, a German force attacked Poland, ostensibly to support Zbigniew. But Bolesław held on, sending the Germans back. 6/10\n\nZbigniew would be allowed to return, but Bolesław would soon accuse him of treason and have him killed. With his hold on rule clear, he headed north to conquer Pomerania. It would take him a decade to pacify Eastern Pomerania and make its ruler, Wartislaw, his tributary. 7/10\n\nIt took till 1135 for Bolesław to gain control on Western Pomerania, after swearing fealty to the Holy Roman Emperor. But he had more pressing thoughts in his mind. Having experienced the fight with his brother in his younger days, he wished to avoid that for the future. 8/10\n\nBefore his death in 1138, Bolesław willed division of Poland among his sons. The eldest, Władysław, was given the ducal title and the largest portion, while the rest were allocated parts as subordinates. But it didn’t take long for the brothers to fight among themselves. 9/10\n\nAfter further divisions and wars, Poland was reunited in a smaller form in 1320. In 1370, it was inherited by French Capet-Anjou followed by Lithuanian Gediminids. This ended with an elective monarchy of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the most populous country in Europe. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 30, 2021.\n\nBolesław, Duke of Poland (1102-1138) – Bolesław’s decision to divide Poland among his sons led to a two centuries of divisions and civil wars for supremacy. In the end, the senior line which got Silesia chose to side with Bohemia and the internal strife led to a diminished Poland being reorganized under a single king in 1320. But by 1370, the Polish Piast ruling dynasty had ended and Poland was inherited by the French / Italian / Hungarian Capet – Anjou royal family and two generations later by the Lithuanian Gediminds. The Gediminids united Lithuania with Poland creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which was the largest European state in 1618. However, the elective monarchy, set up after the Gediminid line became extinct, led to external influences dominating Poland ranging from Sweden to Saxony to Russia to France eventually leading to the complete partition of Poland by Prussia, Austria and Russia in the 18th century.\n\nA nation broken by a foreign invasion, a young prince collaborating with the same invaders to gain dominance in his nation, remaking it and setting in motion a chain of events that would ultimately lead towards regaining the nation’s independence.\n\nAleksander Iaroslavich was born in 1220 to Iaroslav Vsevolodich, Prince of Pereyaslavl, and Fedosia. Iaroslav was the younger brother of Prince Konstantin of Rostov and Grand Prince Iurii of Vladimir-Suzdal. Iurii and Iaroslav had earlier allied against the elder Konstantin. 1/10\n\nAfter Andrei Iurievich had demolished Kiev in 1169, Vladimir had become the main power centre of the divided Rus’ nation. Young Aleksander was installed as the Prince of Novgorod in 1236 and it is in Novgorod that he would make his mark. 2/10\n\nIn 1240, a band of Swedes would attempt to seize the mouth of River Neva, which was controlled by Novgorod. But Aleksander would be at hand to repel the invaders. The victory gave Aleksander the cognomen Nevsky. But things were not going well for the Rus’ elsewhere. 3/10\n\nIn 1238, the Mongols had invaded the Rus’, killing Aleksander’s uncle, Iurii. In his place, the Mongols had appointed Iaroslav. In 1242, the crusading Teutonic knights would attempt to pacify Pskov. Aleksander was again at hand to repel the invasion, this time on ice. 4/10\n\nIn 1246, Iaroslav died while returning from the capital of the Mongol Golden Horde. Sviatoslav, a brother of Iaroslav, seized Vladimir but was expelled by Mikhail, a younger son of Iaroslav. Meanwhile, Aleksander and another brother, Andrei, departed for the Mongol capital. 5/10\n\nAndrei was given Vladimir, while Aleksander Kiev. Andrei returned to Vladimir in 1248, with Mikhail having died fighting Lithuanian princes. Meanwhile, Güyük Khan, the Mongol Khagan, had died and Möngke Khan, took over after a brief interregnum. 6/10\n\nBut Andrei refused to swear fealty to the new Khagan. So, the Mongols replaced him with Aleksander. Andrei would be placed in charge of Nizhni-Novgorod in 1255, with Aleksander’s support. A descendant of Andrei would later become Tsar of Russia in 1606. 7/10\n\nIn 1247, Sviatoslav, who had seized Vladimir when Aleksander had gone to meet the Mongols, appointed Iaroslav, another brother of Aleksander, as the Prince of Tver. The rivalry of the Tver line of Rurikids and that of Aleksander’s descendants would fuel the Rus’ resurgence. 8/10\n\nIn 1255, Novgorod would attempt to appoint Iaroslav of Tver as their Prince, but Aleksander would be able to reassert his position. He would be the enforcer for the Mongols, making Novgorod submit to their census and taxation in 1259. But he brought stability to the Rus’. 9/10\n\nAleksander died in 1263 and it was Iaroslav who succeeded him in Vladimir. Aleksander’s sons, Dmitry of Pereyaslavl and Andrei of Gorodets would both rule Vladimir, but it was the descendants of his youngest son, Daniil of Moscow, who would finally overthrow the Mongols. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 26, 2021.\n\nAleksander Iaroslavich, Prince of Novgorod (1228-1229), (1236-1240), (1241-1252), (1257-1259), Prince of Dmitrov (1238-1246), Prince of Pereyaslavl (1238-1252), Grand Prince of Kiev (1246-1263), Grand Prince of Vladimir (1252-1263) – Aleksander Nevsky collaborated with the Mongols and brought stability to the Rus’. In his youth, he had defended Novgorod in the west and put a stop to attacks from western invaders. These efforts would lead to the resurgence of the Rus’ after its fragmentation and later collapse after the Mongol invasion. It was the line of Aleksander’s son, Daniil, who became the first Prince of Moscow, who would eventually lead them to independence and unite all the Rus’ and form Russia.\n\nAn old nation on the verge of collapse, a young city looking to replace it and a prince to guide both of them there.\n\nAndrei Iurievich was born around 1111 to Iurii Vladimirovich, Prince of Rostov-Suzdal, and a Cuman princess.\n\nFor centuries, Kiev had been the capital of the Rus’. In 1149, Prince Iurii captured Kiev with the help of Cuman allies, but he could not hold onto it for long. 1/10\n\nKievan Rus’ originated in the 9th century, when Rurik and his brothers founded it. But by the time of Andrei, the state had been divided among Rurik’s descendants into many principalities. The Grand Prince of Kiev was still the nominal overlord, but the city was in decline. 2/10\n\nPrince Iurii put Andrei in charge of Vladimir. It was a new city founded around 1108 by Iurii’s father. In 1154, Iurii put his son in charge of Vyshgorod. But the prince quickly returned to Vladimir. Vladimir would remain Andrei’s base of operations for the rest of his life. 3/10\n\nPrince Iurii became the Grand Prince of Kiev again in 1155. It is during this time the Prince is said to have fortified a town on the Moskva river, that later became Moscow. But Prince Iurii’s reign in Kiev was short, since he died in 1158. Andrei succeeded in Rostov-Suzdal. 4/10\n\nAndrei made Vladimir the capital of Rostov-Suzdal, building it into a city, encouraging people to shift there. He launched successful military campaigns against the Volga Bulgars and in 1169, he set his sights on Kiev. The campaign, led by his son Mstislav, was successful. 5/10\n\nBut unlike his father who moved to Kiev for rule, Andrei installed his brother Gleb as the Grand Prince and went back to Vladimir, enriching it further with loot from Kiev. Kiev was broken as a city and Vladimir had become the new centre of the Rus’. 6/10\n\nAndrei tried to dominate other Rus’ states. He would have to be satisfied with his younger son, Iurii, becoming Prince of Novgorod briefly, when he tried to conquer the Novgorod Republic. His elder son, Mstislav, would die in battle against the Volga Bulgars in 1172. 7/10\n\nBut his autocratic rule had its detractors. In 1175, Andrei would be killed by his courtiers. His eldest surviving brother, Mikhail, would inherit Rostov-Suzdal, but Prince Iurii would be expelled from Novgorod. By 1176, another brother, Vsevolod, was ruling Rostov-Suzdal. 8/10\n\nVsevolod would build on his brother’s efforts in strengthening Vladimir, extending his influence over Volga Bulgars, Novgorod & Ryazan. On his death in 1212, Vladimir was at its peak, but they would have to face its greatest foe, when Prince Iurii, son of Vsevolod, ruled. 9/10\n\nThe Mongols had devastated the Principality of Kiev in their raids in 1223. In 1238, they returned, this time to invade. The forces of Batu Khan defeated and killed Iurii at the Battle of the Sit River. Rus’ would be under Mongol suzerainty for the next couple of centuries. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 23, 2021.\n\nAndrei Iurievich, Prince of Rostov-Suzdal (1158-1174) – Andrei’s demolition of Kiev and strengthening of Vladimir in its place, led to the slow move of the Rus’ centre of influence northwards.\n\nA goddess who wanted to rule.\n\nLivia Drusilla was born in 58 BC to Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus (Born Appius Claudius Pulcher and later adopted by Marcus Livius Drusus) and Alfidia. Not much is known about her early life, except that she married Tiberius Claudius Nero around 43. 1/10\n\nIn the Roman civil wars after 44, both Livia’s father and husband ended up supporting the losing side. After Gaius Octavius defeated Lucius Antonius in Perusia, they would flee from Rome. But after Octavius reconciled with Marcus, brother of Lucius, they would return. 2/10\n\nIt was around this time that Octavius and Livia met and they decided to marry each other, though Livia was pregnant at the time. Octavius already had a daughter from an earlier marriage, Julia. Soon, Livia would deliver her second child, Nero Claudius Drusus. 3/10\n\nAntonius would break away from alliance. Civil war was back in Rome till 31, when Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa would lead Octavian’s forces to victory at Actium. Agrippa, an old schoolmate of Octavius, was also his most reliable supporter. 4/10\n\nFor his victory, the Senate named Octavian, Augustus. Calling himself Imperator, Augustus adopted the title Princeps. The Roman Republic was unofficially over. Augustus and Livia had become the first citizens of the Roman Empire. 5/10\n\nMarcus Agrippa played an important role in setting up the Empire, but not just militarily, since he was also responsible for many of its notable buildings. He remained an important ally of Augustus and would later marry Julia in 21. 6/10\n\nAs Augustus and Agrippa consolidated the Empire, Livia also gained power in Rome. Many, though, blame her for the deaths of many of the potential successors of her husband, as she steered him towards confirming that inheritance to her elder son, Tiberius Claudius Nero. 7/10\n\nJulia’s first husband, Marcus Marcellus, who was also her first cousin, had died in 23. Agrippa died in 12 and though his sons Gaius and Lucius would see their careers fast tracked to become heirs, both would be dead by 4 AD. 8/10\n\nThe last son of Julia would be exiled for being “crazy”, making Tiberius the best likely candidate. Livia’s other son, Nero, who had become a popular general after Agrippa, with victories against Germanic tribes, had died in 9, leaving two sons, Germanicus & Claudius. 9/10\n\nTiberius succeeded Augustus as Princeps in 14 AD, with his mother at his side. But he was careful not to keep her too close, even delegating his grand nephew Gaius to eulogize her at her funeral in 29. It was her grandson, Claudius, who made Livia a Roman deity in 42. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 19, 2021.\n\nLivia Drusilla – Wife of Augustus Caesar, who played a crucial role during the Roman Civil War after 44 BC, which led to the collapse of the Roman Republic and its conversion to Roman Empire.\n\nIt is said money can’t buy happiness. Meet someone who was once the richest man in the world and one of the most powerful. And definitely one of the unhappiest.\n\nMarcus Licinius Crassus was born in 115 BC to Publius Licinius Crassus, who was Consul of Rome in 97. Young Crassus grew up in an increasingly militaristic Roman Republic with wars against Germanic tribes (113-101) and against allies in the Italian peninsula (91-87). 1/10\n\nAs Rome was kept busy in Italy, King Mithridates of Pontus extended his influence to the Roman colonies in the East. The Republic appointed Lucius Cornelius Sulla to restrain Mithridates. Old warhorse, Caius Marius, attempted to remove Sulla, leading to a civil war in Rome. 2/10\n\nWith Sulla headed for Asia, Marius got complete control over Rome. Publius Crassus had died during the Marian takeover along with his elder son, and younger Marcus fled to Hispania. He would build an army there, and later join Sulla in Asia with it. 3/10\n\nA victorious Sulla would return triumphantly to Rome, taking Crassus with him. Though Marius had died, his faction still had a strong hold over Rome, and had a numerically larger army. But another young man, with his own army, came out to meet Sulla – Gnaeus Pompeius. 4/10\n\nSulla would attain control over Rome, declaring himself the Dictator. Crassus played a crucial role in helping Sulla finish off the last of his opponents. He was rewarded heavily for his efforts, gaining the property of Sulla’s opponents. He would soon amass a great fortune. 5/10\n\nThough Crassus saw his fortunes grow, it was to Pompey that Sulla would turn to, for war. With successful campaigns in Sicily and Carthage, Pompey was well placed to be the most powerful man in Rome after Sulla, irrespective of all the riches of Crassus. 6/10\n\nCrassus finally got his chance for glory, defeating Spartacus, the leader of the slave rebellion from 73 to 71. But Pompey, who was away in Hispania being schooled by Sertorius on guerrilla warfare, would return in the end and finish off escapees, stealing the final glory. 7/10\n\nThe rivalry of the two was at its highest when both were elected as Consuls in 70. With his massive fortune, Crassus would extend credit to many budding politicians, including one whose aunt was the wife of the late Caius Marius – Gaius Julius Caesar. 8/10\n\nCaesar would manoeuvre the two rivals into an alliance of common interest. He would also gain fame and prestige as he embarked on the conquest of Gaul in 58, cementing his place in Roman military lore. Both Pompey and Crassus would return to Consular roles in 55. 9/10\n\nIn 54, Crassus would be made the governor of Syria, when he would embark on a battle against Parthia. Crassus seeking a big win to restore his stature in Rome, would find one. But it would come for Parthia, at Carrhae, bringing to end the life of the richest man of Rome. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 16, 2021.\n\nMarcus Licinius Crassus, Consul of Rome (70 BC), (55 BC) – Crassus funded Caesar’s early political career by extending credit. Later, Caesar would manoeuvre Crassus and Pompey to form the First Triumvirate controlling Roman Republic till 53 BC, when Crassus was killed in battle. The First Triumvirate was preceded by the civil war between Marius and Sulla and followed by the civil war between Caesar and Pompey and was a crucial time in slow transformation of Republic to Empire.\n\nIt is said that the candle glows the brightest towards its end. As a nation neared its end, a general took charge and prevented its fall, till he was killed and the nation collapsed.\n\nJulius Valerius Majorianus may have been born around 420 to a distinguished Roman family. In 423, Western Emperor Honorius had died and Ioannes was elevated as Emperor. But soon the Eastern Emperor recognized his cousin, Valentinian, as Emperor. A civil war was imminent. 1/10\n\nIoannes send out Flavius Aëtius, who had been a hostage as young boy with the Visigoths and the Huns, for help. But by the time Aëtius returned, Ioannes was already dead. Nevertheless, Aëtius retained a formidable role in the military. 2/10\n\nWhen Majorian came of age, he joined the military and was soon taken under the wing of his father’s associate, Aëtius. Majorian soon made a name for himself fighting for Aëtius against Frankish King, Chlodio. Many Germanic tribes had carved out Kingdoms in Gaul and Iberia. 3/10\n\nBut the loss of Africa to the Vandals led by Genseric in 435 would prove crucial for the Empire, since it was also its granary. The invasion by Attila’s Huns made it much worse. In 454, Valentinian killed Aëtius, but was in turn killed by Petronius Maximus the next year. 4/10\n\nMajorian had grown up in the ranks by then and though he would plot with another general, Flavius Ricimer (Of Suevi origin) for the throne, it was Petronius Maximus who would become Emperor. This would bring Genseric to Rome and sack the city giving rise to “vandalism”. 5/10\n\nEparchius Avitus, who had gone to seek help of the Visigoths of Toulouse when the Vandal invaded, was made the new Emperor. Avitus would send the Visigoths to recover Hispania, but when they were busy in Hispania, Ricimer and Majorian would defeat Avitus in battle in Italy. 6/10\n\nWith no clarity on who the Emperor was, a group of Alemanni invaded. Majorian defeated them, and the soldiers acclaimed him as Emperor for it, with Ricimer’s support. The Eastern Emperor would eventually support Majorian and they would become Consular colleagues in 458. 7/10\n\nMajorian would seek to bring back the lost Roman territory by launching attacks on the Burgundians, the Visigoths and the Suevi. He would also bring about administrative changes that made him more popular in the Empire. 8/10\n\nBut a naval defeat against the Vandals near Cartagena would put pressure on Majorian. Ricimer, who had looked to rule from behind the throne like Stilico, would arrest Majorian as he returned to Rome, forcing him to abdicate and have him killed later. 9/10\n\nThe deposition of Majorian would be unpopular and hasten the break up of the Empire outside Italy. Ricimer would install puppets to the throne, but with his death in 472, Sciri leader Odovacar would seize control of Italy ending the Empire in 476. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 12, 2021.\n\nJulius Valerius Majorianus, Western Roman Emperor (457-461) – Majorian was the last Roman Emperor in the West who managed to retain authority over their allies, reconquering Iberia and Gaul. However, his deposition hastened the fall of the Western Empire, since the remaining Emperors were puppets under the control of generals.\n\nEnding is an inevitability, be it for a star, or a planet, or a life, or even a nation. (Unless of course if you are one of the Endless). Sometimes it can be postponed, but at a greater cost. This is the story of beginning of one such end.\n\nIn the evening …\n\nAlaric was born around 370 AD, outside the northern border of the Roman Empire perhaps near the basin of Danube. He would have been a child when he came to the Empire along with the refugee / invading contingent of Germanic tribes that beat the Romans at Adrianople in 378. 1/10\n\nThe newly proclaimed Emperor of the East, Theodosius, made peace with the invaders, settling them in the Balkans. In exchange they were made foedus, which meant they will have come to aid of the Roman forces in case of war. 2/10\n\nAlaric came from a noble family. By the end of the 4th century, there were many Germanic warriors in the Roman army. One of the generals that led the defence of the East against Alaric and his compatriots in 378 was of Germanic origin, Frankish general Flavius Richomeres. 3/10\n\nAs foederati, Alaric and the Goths were trained as Roman soldiers, but he would lead a minor revolt that was brought down by Stilico, another general of Germanic extract; from the Vandal tribe. In 394, his band of Goths would be called upon to defend the Empire. 4/10\n\nValentinian II, the Emperor in the West, had died (and possibly killed) in 392 and Arbogast, a Frankish general and nephew of Richomeres, made a teacher named Eugenius Emperor, since Arbogast, being non Roman, was ineligible. In 394, Theodosius and Eugenius met in battle. 5/10\n\nAlaric and the Goths assisted Theodosius and Stilico in battle and came out victorious, but at great cost of life. The impact was multiple. The Western Empire was weakened, while both sides became heavily dependant on foederati. The façade of Roman invincibility was broken. 6/10\n\nTheodosius died the next year leaving two child Emperors on the throne, Arcadius (18) in the East and Honorius (11) in the West. Alaric pressed for advantage launching a rebellion, and Arcadius would eventually sue for peace and appoint him magister militum per Illyricum. 7/10\n\nAfter that, Alaric would set his eyes on the West, with the younger Emperor Honorius and his old foe/ally, Stilico. His invasion of Italy in 401 would be stopped by Stilico forcing Alaric to retreat, but Stilico would have his hands full with rebels and usurpers. 8/10\n\nAs Stilico found himself stretched, a host of Vandals, Alans and the Suevi led by Godegisl crossed the Rhine in 406, plundering Gaul and threatening Iberia. Honorius, seeing Stilico as a threat to his throne, had him executed in 408. 9/10\n\nFrustrated by failed promises of tribute, Alaric finally besieged Rome in 410, installing his own puppet Emperor. As Honorius was safe in his capital in Ravenna, the Goths sacked Rome. Alaric would die the same year, but the long collapse of the Western Empire had begun. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 9, 2021.\n\nAlaric – King of the Visigoths (395-410) – For centuries the Roman Empire had guarded its northern border across Rivers Rhine and Danube with success, but the Battle of Adrianople showed it could be breached. Though the battle happened because the Emperor mismanaged the handling of refugee who ended up becoming invaders, their resettlement in the Balkans and the installation of a stable Emperor in Theodosius gave assurance of Roman invincibility. That changed when a barbarian general tried to install his own puppet Emperor. Though Alaric was at hand in defeating Arbogast and his puppet Eugenius, the façade of Roman invincibility was broken. It had also made the Western Empire weaker, which Alaric and later other Germanic invaders took advantage of, leading to an era of dominance of Germanic soldiers in the Roman army and the gradual replacement of Roman provinces by Germanic Kingdoms.\n\nRumoured to be the illegitimate son of a King, this young Prince would switch to the side of an enemy nation, when the enemy’s capital was under siege. He would lead the resurgence of his new nation, but his student would break its back.\n\nStory in the evening …\n\nEugene François de Savoie was born in 1663 to Eugene Maurice de Savoie, Count of Soissons, and Olimpia Mancini. Eugene belonged to a cadet branch of the House of Savoy, but their allegiance was to France. Olimpia was the niece of Cardinal Giulio Mazzarino. 1/10\n\nThe Cardinal was the First Minister of France from 1642 to 1661. He was also the de facto ruler of France when King Louis XIV was a minor. The close attachment of King Louis and Olimpia led to a rumour that Louis was Eugene’s father, a rumour which Louis denied. 2/10\n\nBut Olimpia’s role in Affaire des Poisons led her to flee France, leaving Eugene with his grandmother, Marie de Bourbon-Condé. In 1683, the King denied Eugene entry in the French army. His elder brother, Louis Jules, was at the time busy defending Vienna from the Ottomans. 3/10\n\nEugene went to Vienna after his brother’s death in battle. He was attached to the unit of Duke Charles Leopold de Lorraine. Young Eugene distinguished himself in battle as Vienna was freed from the siege and he received commendation from both his commander and the Emperor. 4/10\n\nThe Habsburg counter attack led by Duke Charles brought the Hungarian capital Buda back to Habsburg rule in 1686, and was followed by victory at Mohács in 1687. Prince Eugene added more fame to his prowess. But injury at Belgrade and Mainz set him back. 5/10\n\nThe War of the Grand Alliance saw the Prince join his second cousin, Duke Victor Amedee of Savoy. But vary of increasing Habsburg influence in Savoy, the Duke changed sides and the Prince had nothing much to write home about from the war. 6/10\n\nEugene was back at the eastern front in 1697. As the Ottomans marched to recover Transylvania, the Habsburg forces intercepted them at Zenta and the Prince led them to a great victory. The war would formally conclude in 1699, initiating the long collapse of Ottoman Empire. 7/10\n\nThe death of King Carlos II of Spain led to a succession war between the French Bourbons and the Habsburgs. Eugene presided the Imperial War Council and achieved victories at Blenheim, Oudenarde, Malplaquet & Turin, at times in partnership with Duke Churchill of Marlborough. 8/10\n\nThe Habsburgs gained all the Spanish possessions in Europe, except Spain which went to a junior line of the Bourbons. France were the dominant power in Europe till 1700, but Eugene brought back Habsburg power. Duke Victor Amedee became King and so did the Duke of Prussia. 9/10\n\nSoon, Eugene was up against the Ottomans, with victories in Petrovaradin in 1716 and Belgrade in 1718. He was on call as a diplomat in the 1720s, but was called on for one last war, over Poland, where a young Prussian Prince named Friedrich learnt the art of war from him. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 5, 2021.\n\nEugene François de Savoie – By the end of the seventeenth century, France was in a dominant position in Europe. But as France and the Habsburgs went head to head over Spain, Eugene of Savoy led the Habsburg army and their allies to victory. Both Prussian King Frederick the Great, who accompanied him during the War of Polish Succession, and Napoleon considers him as one of greatest military leaders of Europe. Eugene of Savoy was also instrumental in breaking the back of the Ottoman Empire slowly paving way for its collapse, as the Habsburgs regained rule of Hungary in full.\n\nThe hunchback of “Notre-Dame” who led the French army to victory against Europe.\n\nStory in the evening …\n\nFrançois-Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville was born in 1628 to François de Montmorency, Count of Bouteville, and Élisabeth Angélique de Vienne. Born posthumously, he was raised by a relative, Charlotte de Montmorency and her husband Henri de Bourbon, Prince de Condé. 1/10\n\nHenri de Bourbon’s son, Louis de Bourbon, was one of major generals of France. Though François-Henri was physically weak and hunchbacked, he grew under Condé’s wing. Siding with Condé in the Fronde as a rebel, François-Henri went on exile after defeat. 2/10\n\nIt was only in 1659 that both Condé and François-Henri could return to France. François-Henri married an heiress, Duchess Madeleine of Piney-Luxembourg, in 1661. In 1668, Condé pulled François-Henri as his deputy as France went to war against Spain over the Low Countries. 3/10\n\nIn 1672, François-Henri had his own command, when France went to war against the Dutch. He was put in charge of the Dutch city of Utrecht, which had surrendered to the French King. But soon François-Henri was faced with a Dutch army more than three times bigger than his own. 4/10\n\nBut François-Henri managed to lead his forces out of the city earning him laurels. He was made Marshal of France in 1675 and replaced Condé as the head of the French army of the Rhine. He was, however, unable to prevent the imperial capture of Philipsburg in 1676. 5/10\n\nWith victories at Valenciennes and Cassel in 1677, François-Henri had cemented his position as the better generals of France on the battlefield. The battle between the French and Dutch ended in 1678 at Nijmegen, with France getting minor gains in the Low Countries. 6/10\n\nPeacetime saw Marshal de Luxembourg (as François-Henri was now better known) briefly in prison for sorcery, but was soon released and made the Captain of the Royal Guard in 1681. The peacetime also saw France’s enemies regrouping slowly against them. 7/10\n\nIn 1689, Willem Hendrik, Prince of Orange, whom the Luxembourg had defeated earlier on battlefield, became the King of England. He rallied rest of Europe to form a grand alliance and go to war against France. Luxembourg was given the command of the French army. 8/10\n\nDespite the numerical strength of their enemies, France came out stronger gaining the upper hand over its enemies. But the war had to be closed as Europe had to prepare for another war, one over Spain as their heirless King was dying setting stage for a succession battle. 9/10\n\nLuxembourg led France to victories at Fleurus, Leuze, Steenkerque & Landen capturing flags to be hung at Notre-Dame, for which he was called Le Tapissier de Notre-Dame (Upholsterer of Notre-Dame). He died in 1695 after which the fight slowed down to the Peace at Ryswick. 10/10\n\nOriginally tweeted by Ranjith Kollannur (@Arby_K) on March 2, 2021.\n\nFrançois-Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville – When Willem Hendrik, Prince of Orange and King of England allied with the Holy Roman Emperor to create the Grand Alliance against France, King Louis XIV appointed François-Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville as the commander of the French army. Despite the numerical superiority of the opposition, France ended the war stronger."
