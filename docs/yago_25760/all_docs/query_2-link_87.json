        "text": "Recently I joined and subscribed to something called “The Radical Theology Seminar” (you can take a peek at this excellent project at this link). I recommend it highly.\n\nAnyway, in a very insightful piece on the place of the riot in Radical Theology, Justin Leavitt Pearl noted that there was an overlap with the day of Pentecost and in connection with this thought he cited some words spoken by the philosopher Slavoj Žižek while addressing the Occupy Wall Street protesters at Zuccotti Park in 2011 which I’d like to reproduce here, along with an additional, connected, quote from a 2007 lecture called “A Meditation on Michelangelo’s Christ on the Cross.”\n\nThe reason for doing this is threefold.\n\n1) I think that what Žižek talked about eleven years ago in connection with the protest and its relationship with the Holy Spirit, and in his 2007 lecture on Michelangelo’s drawing, remains relevant and it certainly connects with many things I talk about in this blog, not least of all, a Death of God theology.\n\n2) Pentecost Sunday was last Sunday so this current post can stand as a meaningful appendix to my own piece called “The fiery rope across generations and geography—a meditation for Pentecost.”\n\n3) Some of you will recall that back in November 2011 I and four other members and/or attenders of the Cambridge Unitarian Church, visited and spoke to the OccupyLSX (London Stock Exchange) outside St. Pauls (see photo above).\n\nSo, here’s Žižek talking in 2011 to Occupy Wall Street protesters:\n\n“What is Christianity? It’s the holy spirit. What is the holy spirit? It’s an egalitarian community of believers who are linked by love for each other, and who only have their own freedom and responsibility to do it. In this sense, the holy spirit is here now. And down there on Wall Street, there are pagans who are worshipping blasphemous idols. So all we need is patience. The only thing I’m afraid of is that we will someday just go home and then we will meet once a year, drinking beer, and nostalgically remembering “What a nice time we had here.” Promise yourselves that this will not be the case. We know that people often desire something but do not really want it. Don’t be afraid to really want what you desire. Thank you very much.”\n\nAnd here’s Žižek in his 2007 lecture “A Meditation on Michelangelo’s Christ on the Cross”:"
