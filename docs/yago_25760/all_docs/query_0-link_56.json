They posed little threat to the Franks as their territory was isolated by the natural barriers formed by the Erzgebirge and Böhmerwald mountains. Einhard's Annales record a council at Frankfurt in 822 attended by legates from \"orientalium Sclavorum, id est Abodritorum, Soraborum, Wiltzorum, Beheimorum, Marvanorum, Prædenecentorum et in Pannonia residentium Avarum\" . Fourteen of their duces were baptised at the court of Ludwig II \"der Deutsche\" King of the East Franks in 845 . There is some confusion between Bohemia and Moravia in primary sources during the mid-9th century. For example, the Annales Fuldenses record that a military expedition was sent to \"Bohemia\" in 857 although, as the text names the Moravian duke, it is likely that Moravia was intended . It is possible that Bohemia did not exist at that time as a separate entity but that the territory was subject to Moravian domination.\n\nThe first identified reference to Bohemia as a separate unit is in the Gesta Francorum which names \"Zventisla, Witislavi, Heriman, Spoitamor, Moyslan, Goriwei\" as the dukes of the Bohemians in 872 . The same list is given in the Annales Fuldenses, also in 872 . It is not clear what independent status these named individuals may have enjoyed. However, as the text singles out none of them as overall leader, it is likely that they were local chiefs probably reporting to the Moravian duke. At any rate, in the later 9th century, Bohemia was still subject to the overlordship of the Moravians from whom they received missionaries . The Chronica Boemorum names \"Premizl\" as the first of the dynasty which was later known by his name, and his successors \"Nezamizl\", \"Mnata\", \"Vogen\", \"Unezlau\", \"Crezomisl\", \"Neclan\" and \"Gostivit\" . It is not known whether this list represents actual historical figures. The first known direct ancestor of the later dukes of Bohemia was Bořiwoj, alleged son of Gostiwit, whose baptism by Methodius Bishop of Moravia is recorded in the Chronica Boemorum and the Cronica Principum Regni Boemiæ, see Chapter 1. His descendants continued to rule Bohemia until the death in 1306 of the last descendant in the male line.\n\nVladislav II Duke of Bohemia was crowned as king of Bohemia in 1158 (see Chapter 2). The royal title was not inherited by his sons. His younger son Duke Přemysl Otakar I was crowned king in 1198, and his descendants continued to rule as kings. After King Wenzel III was murdered in 1306, Albrecht I King of Germany engineered the succession as king of Bohemia of his son Rudolf III Duke of Austria, who had married King Wenzel´s stepmother. King Rudolf died later in 1307, at which time Heinrich von Görz, son of Meinhard II Duke of Carinthia, was appointed to succeed (see Chapter 3). After King Heinrich´s succession as duke of Carinthia in 1310, the Bohemian crown passed to Jean Comte de Luxembourg, elected as Jan King of Bohemia, who at the same time married the older sister of King Wenzel III (see Chapter 4). The Luxembourg dynasty retained the Bohemian throne until the death in 1437 of King Zikmund. The Luxembourg kings of Bohemia leveraged their territorial strength along the western and eastern borders of the Holy Roman Empire to acquire a position of considerable power in Germany. King Jan imposed Bohemian suzerainty on Silesia in 1327 and in 1334 installed his son Karl as Markgraf of Moravia. Three years after Karl succeeded his father, he was crowned as king of Germany and in 1355 as Emperor Karl IV. The Bohemian crown passed to the Habsburg dynasty in 1437 (see Chapter 5). In 1458, the crown passed to a Bohemian nobleman Jiři Podiebrad (Chapter 6), although his succession was challenged by Mátyás Hunyadi King of Hungary who also assumed the title king of Bohemia (Chapter 7) but was deposed in 1471 at the same time as the death of King Jiři Podiebrad, at which time the Bohemian throne passed to the Jagiellon kings of Poland (Chapter 8).\n\nChapter 1. DUKES of BOHEMIA 915-1197 (PŘEMYSLID)\n\nBOŘIWOJ, son of --- ([852/53]-[900]) . The Chronica Boemorum names Gostivit as the father of Borwoy, and records that the latter was the first duke to be baptised by Methodius Bishop of Moravia, during the reign of Svatopluk King of Moravia . He founded the town of Prague . Dux. The Cronica Principum Regni Boemiæ records that \"Borzywoy primus Dux christianus in Boemia\" was baptised \"cum coniuge sua beata Ludmilla Martyre\" in 894 .\n\nm ([874/75]) LUDMILLA, daughter of SLAVIBOR ze Pova [Prince of Pov or Prince of the Sorbs] (860-murdered Burg Tetin 15 Sep 921, bur Prague St Georg). The Chronica Boemorum names \"filia Zlavoboris comitis de castello Psov, nomine Ludmila\" as wife of \"Borivoy\" . She was strangled . The Cronica Principum Regni Boemiæ records that \"Borzywoy primus Dux christianus in Boemia\" was baptised \"cum coniuge sua beata Ludmilla Martyre\" in 894 . She was canonised.\n\nDuke Bořiwoj & his wife had two children:\n\n1. SPYTIHNĔV (875-915). The Chronica Boemorum names \"Spitigneum et Wratizlaum\" as sons of \"Borivoy\", specifying that the former succeeded his father . He succeeded his father in [900] as SPYTIHNĔV Duke of the Bohemians.\n\n2. VRATISLAV (888-killed in battle 13 Feb 921) . The Chronica Boemorum names \"Spitigneum et Wratizlaum\" as sons of \"Borivoy\", specifying that the latter succeeded on the death of his older brother . \"Wratizlav\" is named as younger brother of \"Zpuytignev\" in the Vita Vencezslavi . He succeeded his brother in 915 as VRATISLAV I Duke of the Bohemians. The Gesta Hungarorum records that, after settling in Pannonia, the Magyars (although the text does not give them this name) raided Moravia and Bohemia and killed \"Waratizlao\" in battle . m ([906]) DRAHOMIRA, daughter of --- from Stodor (-after 935). The Chronica Boemorum names \"Dragomir de durissima gente Luticensi ex provincial nomine Stodor\" as wife of \"Wratizlav\" . Regent for her son. She was sent into exile . Duke Vratislav & his wife had two children:\n\na) WENZEL ([907]-murdered Altbunzlau 28 Sep 935 , bur 4 Mar ---- Prague St Veit). The Chronica Boemorum names \"Wincezlaum et Bolezlaum\" as sons of Wratislav and Dragomir . \"Vencezlaum\" is named as son of \"Wratizlav\" in the Vita Vencezslavi . He succeeded his father in 921 as WENZEL I Duke of the Bohemians. Heinrich I King of Germany led a successful campaign against Bohemia in 929 when Duke Wenzel did homage to the king . He was murdered by his brother Boleslav \"929 Kal Oct\" according to the Chronica Boemorum .\n\nb) BOLESLAV (-15 Jul [967]) . The Chronica Boemorum names \"Wincezlaum et Bolezlaum\" as sons of Wratislav and Dragomir . He succeeded in 935 after murdering his brother as BOLESLAV I \"der Grausame\" Duke of the Bohemians.\n\n- see below.\n\nBOLESLAV of Bohemia, son of VRATISLAV I Duke of the Bohemians & his wife Drahomira ze Stodor ([908/10]-15 Jul [967]) . The Chronica Boemorum names \"Wincezlaum et Bolezlaum\" sons of Wratislav and Dragomir . His birth date range is estimated from the birth date of his second son and the estimated birth date of Boleslav's older brother. \"Bolezlav\" is named as younger brother of \"Vencezlaum\" in the Vita Vencezslavi, which specifies that he was \"mentis perversitate et actuum qualitate execrandus, diabolico tactu instinctus\" . He succeeded in 935, after murdering his brother, as BOLESLAV I \"der Grausame\" Duke of the Bohemians. His accession marked the start of a period of hostile relations with the empire until Otto I King of Germany forced Duke Boleslav to pay tribute fourteen years later, and placed him, according to Thietmar, \"in the custody of his brother Heinrich Duke of Bavaria\" . The Bohemians helped King Otto to defeat the Hungarians at Lechfeld near Augsburg in 955, and afterwards crossed the Carpathian mountains and occupied Krakow and Silesia . In 965, Duke Boleslav formed an alliance with Mieszko I Prince of Poland, confirmed by the marriage of the latter to Boleslav's daughter . The Chronica Boemorum records the death of Boleslav \"967 Id Iul\" . The Cronica Principum Regni Boemiæ records the death in 967 of \"Boleslaus Sacuus filius Wratislai\" .\n\nm BIAGOTA, daughter of ---. The Chronica Boemorum names \"Ztrahquaz\" as wife of Boleslav .\n\nDuke Boleslav I & his wife had four children:\n\n1. BOLESLAV ([927/28]-7 Feb 999) . The Chronica Boemorum names \"secundus Bolezlaus dux\" as son of Boleslav . His birth date range is estimated from the birth date of his younger brother, and assuming that the birth date range of their father is accurate. He succeeded his father in [967] as BOLESLAV II \"der Fromme\" Duke of the Bohemians. Duke Boleslav supported the rebellion of Heinrich II \"der Zänker\" Duke of Bavaria against his cousin Emperor Otto II in [974/75]. After the latter confiscated the duke's territories, ex-Duke Heinrich fled to Bohemia and took refuge with Duke Boleslav . Emperor Otto II founded a bishopric in Prague in 975 . Duke Boleslav supported Heinrich \"den Zänker\" ex-Duke of Bavaria in his rebellion against Otto III King of Germany in 984 . He founded Lundenburg abbey in 993. The Cronica Principum Regni Boemiæ records the death in 999 of \"Boleslaus Pius filius Boleslai Sacui\", adding that he created the bishopric of Prague and founded the monasteries of \"sanctum Georgium et in Breunowia et in Insula\" . m HEMMA, daughter of --- (-1005 or 1006). The Chronica Boemorum names \"Hemmam\" as wife of \"secundus Bolezlaus dux\", without giving her origin, and records her death in 1006 in a later passage . Thietmar records that she was sent into exile with her son Jaromir and the latter's unnamed younger brother , which appears to be dated to 1003. [Duke Boleslav has been suggested as the possible husband of Ælfgifu of Wessex, daughter of Edward \"the Elder\" King of Wessex & his second wife Ælfleda ---. Hroswitha of Gandersheim describes her as \"Adiva younger in years and likewise inferior in merit\" to her older sister Eadgyth, whom she accompanied to Germany to provide an alternative choice of bride for Otto of Germany . According to William of Malmesbury, she married \"a certain Duke near the Alps\" , who has not been identified. It seems improbable chronologically that her husband could have been Duke Boleslav. Although the duke's birth date is not known, his younger brother Strakhvas was born 28 Sep 929 . It therefore seems unlikely that Boleslaw could have been born much earlier than 925 at the earliest, whereas Ælfgifu was probably born in the range [910/15] assuming that she was of marriageable age when she went to Germany with her sister.] Duke Boleslav II & his wife had four children:\n\na) WENZEL (-young). The Chronica Boemorum names (in order) \"Wencezlaum et Bolezlaum\" as the two sons of \"secundus Bolezlaus dux\" and Hemma, specifying that the former died young .\n\nb) BOLESLAV (-1037) . The Chronica Boemorum names \"Wencezlaum et Bolezlaum\" as the two sons of \"secundus Bolezlaus dux\" and Hemma, specifying that the latter succeeded his father . He succeeded in 999 as BOLESLAV III Duke of the Bohemians, but was deposed in May 1002. Thietmar records that Boleslav fled to \"Markgraf Heinrich\" after he was deposed . He was restored in Feb 1003 by Boleslaw of Poland, but deposed again, blinded and sent into exile later the same year by Bolesław who engineered his own election as Duke of Bohemia . The Cronica Principum Regni Boemiæ records the death in 1037 of \"Boleslaus filius Boleslai, dictus Mitis\" who had been captured and blinded by \"Mezconem Ducem Poloniæ\" . m [PREDSLAVA, daughter of ---. Europäische Stammtafeln names \"Predslava\" as the wife of Duke Boleslaw III but does not give her origin. This suggests that there is a primary source which records her name, but this source has not been identified. According to Baumgarten , the wife of Duke Boleslav III was Predslava of Kiev, daughter of Vladimir I \"Velikiy/the Great\" Grand Prince of Kiev. There is no indication about the date of such a marriage if it ever took place. Information concerning Duke Boleslav and Predslava of Kiev which is available from primary sources shows that [999/1002] and after [1018] are the most likely dates. However, a careful analysis of such information also shows difficulties which cast considerable doubt over the likelihood of such a marriage. If the marriage took place in [999/1002], during Duke Boleslav's brief period of rule in Bohemia, Predslava must have been born in the late 970s/early 980s, maybe the daughter of Grand Prince Vladimir by his first wife Rogneda of Polotsk (married [978], separated [986]). However, three pieces of information apparently relating to Predslava show that she was still living at the court of Kiev during the period [1015/18] and that she was probably unmarried at the time. These are: firstly, the Russian Primary Chronicle which records that Predslava, sister of Iaroslav, warned the latter to be on his guard against Svyatopolk in 1015 , secondly the Polish Chronicon which records that Bolesław I Prince of Poland asked for her hand in marriage in [1017] which was refused , and thirdly another passage in the Primary Chronicle which records that Boleslav of Poland fled from Kiev in 1018 with Iaroslav's two (unnamed) sisters . If the marriage took place after [1018], after Predslava had been taken to Poland, the probable age difference between Predslava and Duke Boleslav would have been pronounced, and Boleslav's apparent lack of political influence at the time must have reduced his marriage prospects. Concerning the age difference, if Predslava was still considered marriageable by Boleslaw I Prince of Poland in [1017], it is likely that she was born somewhat later than [978/86] (in which case she would have been the daughter of Grand Prince Vladimir by one of his concubines). Duke Boleslav's date of birth is unknown. However, his paternal uncle is recorded as having been born in 929 and the likely birth date range of his paternal aunt was [940/45]. It is therefore unlikely that Duke Boleslav's father was born much later than the 930s. Even if his father married late, it is therefore improbable that Duke Boleslav himself was born much later than [970]. The question of Duke Boleslav's political status probably represents a more serious obstacle. By [1018], fifteen years had passed since he was blinded and sent into exile. No information has been found in the primary sources about his activity during this period, which suggests that he fell into obscurity. It is not known whether Boleslav spent all his years of exile in Poland and, if so, under what conditions he lived. However, according to Europäische Stammtafeln , he died in a Polish prison. It is not known how long he had been in prison, but his absence from the Bohemian scene during the early 1030s, when his younger brother Duke Jaromir was restored and deposed in Bohemia for a third time, suggests that ex-Duke Boleslav may have been dismissed as a possible successor in Bohemia due to a lengthy period of imprisonment. His blindness may also have been considered an insuperable handicap. A previous edition of Europäische Stammtafeln shows Predslava as daughter of Grand Prince Vladimir, presumably based on the Baumgarten article. It also shows that the couple had an unnamed daughter who married \"--- von Wřsovec (-1003)\", such an assertion being highly improbable from a chronological point of view.]\n\nc) JAROMIR (-murdered 4 Nov [1038/39]). The Chronica Boemorum names (in order) \"Udalricus et Iaromir\" as two other sons of \"secundus Bolezlaus dux\" & his wife . Thietmar records that \"the duke of the Bohemians castrated his brother Jaromir and wanted to suffocate the younger brother in his bath\" before sending them both into exile with their mother . He succeeded his brother in May 1002 as JAROMIR Duke of the Bohemians, he was deposed in Feb 1003 and took refuge in Bavaria. Thietmar records that Duke Wlodowej died and \"the brothers who had been expelled along with their mother were recalled by the repentant Bohemians\" but that Boleslaw of Poland expelled them again . He was restored by Heinrich II King of Germany who drove out Bolesław of Poland, dated to 7 Sep 1004 . He was deposed again 12 Apr 1012 by his brother Oldrich who installed himself as duke, having lost the confidence of King Heinrich II . Jaromir was restored for the third time in 1033, but deposed once more in 1034. He was castrated and blinded in 1034 . The Chronica Boemorum records the death \"1038 pridie Non Nov\" of \"Iaromir\" . The Cronica Principum Regni Boemiæ records the death in 1039 of \"Iaromyr filius Bolesali\" blinded by \"fratrem Odalricum\" .\n\nd) OLDRICH (-9 Nov 1042). The Chronica Boemorum names (in order) \"Udalricus et Iaromir\" as two other sons of \"secundus Bolezlaus dux\" & his wife, specifying that the former was brought up learning German at the court of Emperor Heinrich II . Thietmar records that \"the duke of the Bohemians castrated his brother Jaromir and wanted to suffocate the younger brother in his bath\" before sending them both into exile with their mother . He succeeded after deposing his brother in 1012 as OLDRICH Duke of the Bohemians. He was deposed in 1033. He was restored as joint duke with his brother later in the same year. The Chronica Boemorum records the death \"V Id Nov\" of \"Oudalricus\" . The Cronica Principum Regni Boemiæ records the death in 1042 of \"Odalricus filius Boleslai\" captured and blinded by \"Mezconem Ducem Poloniæ\" . m ---. The Chronica Boemorum refers to the childless marriage of \"Oudalricus\", but does not name his wife . Mistress (1): BOZENA, daughter of --- (-1052). The Chronica Boemorum names \"Bozena\" as the mother of \"Braziclau\", son of \"Oudalricus\", and in a later passage records her death in 1052 .

DOBRAWA [Dobroslawa] ([940/45]-977) . Thietmar names \"the sister of Boleslav the Elder Dobrawa\" as the wife of Mieszko of Poland . Bearing in mind that Dobrawa gave birth to [four] children, it is unlikely that she was born much earlier than [940/45]. The Annales Kamenzenses record that \"Mesco rex Polanorum\" married \"Danbrovcam filiam ducis Boemie\" in 965 . The Chronica principum Polonie records that \"Mesico\" married \"christianisimam mulierem de Bohemia, Dubraucam\" in 966 and converted to Christianity . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"unam christianissimam de Bohemia Dubrovcam nomine\" as wife of \"Meschonem\" . Her marriage was arranged to confirm the alliance between her father and her prospective husband.

He succeeded in 966 as MIESZKO I Prince of Poland. Mieszko & his wife had [four] children:\n\na) WLADIWOY of Poland (-[Jan/Mar] 1003) . The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. He succeeded in 1002 as VLADIVOY Duke of the Bohemians. Thietmar records that the Bohemians \"secretly called Wlodowej from Poland\" after Duke Boleslav was deposed and \"was unanimously elected in his place because of his consanguinity\" . Thietmar records that Duke Wlodowej died and \"the brothers who had been expelled along with their mother were recalled by the repentant Bohemians\" .\n\nb) other children: see POLAND.\n\n4. MLADA .

In a later passage, her death is recorded \"IV Non Aug\" as well as her later burial in Prague by her son Vratislav. The same source also specifies that she had been expelled from Bohemia by her son Duke Spytihnĕv and married \"Petri regi Ungariorum\" to spite him . The Chronica Boemorum records the death \"1058 IV Non Aug\" of \"Iudita coniunx Bracizlavi, ductrix Boemorum\", specifying that she had been expelled from Bohemia by her son \"Spitigneus\", that to spite her son she had married \"Petro regi Ungarorum\", and that her son Wratizlas had brought back her body to be buried next to her husband in Prague .
