Boleslaw III 'The Wry-Mouthed' king of Poland and nephew to Boleslaw II was at first challenged by his brother Zbigniew, but Zbigniew acknowledged him as king in 1104. Boleslaw successfully defended Silesia from invasion by Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, wh o he defeated at Glasgow and Wroclaw (Breslau) in 1109. His most lasting achievement was the re-conquest of Pomerania on the Baltic coast, which had broken away from Polish control and the Christianization of its peoples. In 11 35, Lothar II, granted Bo lslaw the area as a fief in the Holy Roman Empire.
