        "meta_description": "THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE NEW KOREAN CINEMA In 1992, after decades of military rule, South Korea elected its first civilian president, Kim Young-sam. Along with the many social, political, and economic changes that accompanied the nation’s shift from military to democratic rule, the Korean film industry underwent a renaissance in both popularity and artistic quality, […]",

        "text": "The high visibility of films like these gave Korean cinema a reputation for being especially violent, as evidenced by Roger Ebert’s comment in his review of Oldboy that “of the Korean films I’ve seen, only one . . . did not contain extraordinary sadomasochism.8 Korean cinema certainly has its share of violent imagery, but judging it based solely on films like Oldboy and The Isle is akin to forming an opinion of Hollywood movies after having only seen the Saw movies. Furthermore, these films often mean something completely different to Korean audiences. Kim’s more shocking films, such as Bad Guy (2001) and Samaritan Girl (2004), both of which deal with prostitution, might be marketed salaciously to non-Korean audiences, but at home they provoke serious debate about the treatment of women in Korean society. Kim also deliberately presented a distorted view of Korean Buddhist tradition in one of his more widely-distributed films, Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter . . . and Spring (2003). Although it appears to be a Buddhist fable about a monk and his acolyte, its rituals and spiritual lessons are entirely Kim’s invention, and at times run completely counter to Buddhist philosophy. An ardent cinephile who wrote for film journals before becoming a director, Park belongs as much to Korean cinema as he does to the global brotherhood of film geek auteurs whose work is inspired less by reality than by a lifetime spent obsessively watching “B Movies” and cult films. This ilk is best exemplified by Quentin Tarantino (who, not coincidentally, headed the jury that gave Park his Cannes prize.)"
