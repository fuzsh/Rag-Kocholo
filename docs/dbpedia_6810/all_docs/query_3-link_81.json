        "text": "Like Michael Tolkinâ€™s end-times melodrama The Rapture, this is a disquietingly ambiguous take on piety.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | May 24, 2023\n\nThe film can be different things to different people and be equally effective in any of its interpretations.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Aug 5, 2019\n\nThe amount of tragedy delivered by this story would feel abusive if a lesser talent was at its center.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Nov 6, 2013\n\nIt quickly dawns as to why Jeon won so many awards for this performance...\n\nFull Review | Sep 8, 2013\n\nIn a performance as raw and naked as I can recall seeing, Jeon navigates the ebbs and flows of Shin-ae's grief.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Feb 4, 2011\n\nBrilliantly written, acted and directed, this is a work that evokes the Russian novel despite being a Korean film. Treats larger questions of life and death in the serious manner that they deserve.\n\nFull Review | Dec 21, 2010\n\n[S]low portrait of damaged woman struggling against community expectations reveals universality [in] extraordinary Do-yeon who dramatically shifts gears again [and again].\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Dec 21, 2010\n\nAn exemplary examination of coping that expands to entail questions of morality, absolution and faith.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A- | Dec 5, 2010\n\nIt is unlikely you are going to see a more palpable portrayal of grief this year than Jeon Do-yeon's magnificent perfomance as Shin-ae in this Korean drama of the heart.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Dec 7, 2007"
