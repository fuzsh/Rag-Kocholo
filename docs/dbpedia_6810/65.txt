If you see just one foreign film this week that features an astonishing performer in an incredibly sad story, make it “Secret Sunshine.”

Like the shaky “Biutiful,” “Secret Sunshine” spotlights a lead actor in a painful, difficult role. Here, it’s Do-Yeon Jeon as Shin-Ae, a South Korean woman who relocates, along with her young son, to the village where her recently deceased husband grew up.

A lot is left unexplained in this elliptical film — why she moves, how she survives a suicide attempt — but one thing is clear as soon as her son is kidnapped: There’s still a lot of heartache ahead for Shin-Ae.

In a performance as raw and naked as I can recall seeing, Jeon navigates the ebbs and flows of Shin-Ae’s grief. “Secret Sunshine” explores how unmoored a person can become after a loss, which requires Jeon to flip and flop all over the place — calm and sensible one moment, a maniac the next.

We’re meant to believe she’s capable of almost anything, but it all makes complete sense because of the honesty and modesty with which Jeon, who won the Cannes Film Festival’s best-actress prize for “Secret Sunshine,” conveys her character’s pain.

Director and co-writer Chang-dong Lee is equally painstaking as he guides us through Shin-Ae’s responses to her plight. I like the care with which he handles Shin-Ae’s religious conversion. The film shows Shin-ae taking comfort in her faith and is respectful in its portrayal of the supportive evangelical group that urges her to turn to God for answers.

We don’t see that sort of thing much in the movies, but spirituality is a key element of “Secret Sunshine” (the title has multiple meanings, one of which is that God is Shin-ae’s secret sunshine).
