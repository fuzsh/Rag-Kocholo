The Jay Turser brand, which falls under the international US Music Corporation, produces stringed instruments, from electric guitars, bass guitars and acoustic guitars, to mandolins, banjos, ukuleles or even resonators.

The portfolio of this brand mainly includes instruments from the low and middle price levels. Most of the production takes place in China, however, the used timber does not come from Asian sources. Instead, the company supplies its own timber and carefully oversees its quality and processing. Thanks to that the Jay Turser instruments are of a decent quality and are very well suitable not only for entry level musicians.

The company focuses on time-tested guitar shapes and combination of pickups. As a result, its catalogue mainly includes the Stratocaster, Telecaster, Les Paul and SG guitar types, but also semi-acoustic guitars or its own model line J-Tones, with its relatively unusual guitar shapes. The same can be said about its bass guitars since most of its models are based on the renowned Jazz Bass or Precission shapes.
