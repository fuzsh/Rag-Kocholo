The Jay Turser brand of guitars was created by Tommy Rizzi at Music Industries Corp. in the late 1990s. Initially, Jay Turser instruments consisted of student and entry-level guitars that were based on popular American designs. As the line expanded through the 2000s, mid-level guitars and original designs have been introduced and Jay Turser currently offers a wide variety of guitars, basses, and guitar amplifiers.
