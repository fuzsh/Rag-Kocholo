        "text": "I was doing some Internet research and discovered several websites that actually list the customers and actual shipments of Chinese guitar manufacturers. Now I know that Gibson has their main Epiphone factory in Qingdao and Gibsons are made in the US. But Guangdong province is home to hundreds of guitar companies, one of them being Sihui Huasheng Musical Instrument. listed as the largest musical instrument manufacturer in China. According to their export shipping info they have sent hundreds of cartons of \"guitars\" to Gibson, Epiphone, Jay Turser, Parker, Oscar Schmidt, Washburn and several other companies. The Turser, Parker, Schmidt and Washburn guitars were sent to US Music Corp or their sub, American Music and Sound, in either Illinois or, believe it or not, Southaven, Mississippi, a suburb of Memphis. They also supply amps and other equipment to a company in Tennesse that I was not familiar with, EMD Music Inc.\n\nMaybe the Gibson shipments were actually electronics, like pots, pick ups, tuners, nuts, etc. But they are clearly labeled GUITARS. I find it pretty amazing that this one factory is turning out instruments for all of these brand names. I have an 2009 Epi SG made in China and a really nice 2011 Turser 220 LP gold top, and I actually like the Turser better. I am beginning to think that it is hard NOT to get a Chinese guitar in the US anymore. Even the Gibson guitars are full of Chinese parts.\n\nWell, it is a fact that there a big factories which produce guitars for some big manufactors. When you take a look at the factories iwhich produced guitars in the late 80s to the end of the 90s you'll find only a few big one's like Cort(ek), Samick and Young Chang, who produced for a lot of big labels like Epiphone, Schecter, Ibanez and so on. So you can bet that a guitar which is made in Korea comes out of this factories.\n\nThe same thing with hardware. When you have Jin-Ho and Sung-Il hardware you might think it is no name crap, but it isn't. Both are factories which work for Wilkinson.\n\nLet's take a look at the Pup production. There aren't that much factories which build them. A little example: I've got a little book about Cort, called \"the story of Cort\" (if somebody is interested in, I can scan it and post it here in the forum) where you can read that the \"selected by EMG\" pups are made in Cort's pickups factory.\n\nI'm not sure if Young Chang still produces guitars, Samick does it and they have there label Greg Bennett (before that they were sold as Samick) and Cortek still produces, too. They have their own label, but still produce for brands like Ibanez, Schecter and some others, too, but Cort nowadays produce the most oh their guitars in Indonesia. I've no idea where Samick is producing actually\n\nIf I remember correctly, if 25% of producing process is made in certain country (or f.e. EU) you can give label on your product with Made in \"that country\".\n\nSo, China cuts the wood, put on some laquer, shipps to US and US puts inside electronics and hardware - that's maybe how some products carries Made in USA label\n\nStill I thought that Gibson was very proud of the fact that every instrument with their original logo was made in US.\n\nMy point exactly and why I posted this to start with. Actually I think if 51% of the contents are made in USA then you can label it as Made in USA. Gibsons are \"Made in USA\" and supposedly the Epi's are made in that shiny factory that they feature on that slick factory tour promo. So why are they getting shipments of guitars from some other factory?\n\nPersonally I love Made in USA stuff but it is a fact that made in China is not always junk. They are producing some quality stuff over there and I have had more than one person make a comment like \"Gibson QC ain't what it used to be\". I guess maybe some dude in China who takes pride in his work might just do as good a job as some guy in Nashville nursing a hangover? Just saying.....\n\nyes, every successful major corporation tells us the absolute truth about their business practices.\n\nu guys are funny.\n\nwould not surprise me in the least if (some) Gibson USA's were MIC.\n\nim leaning toward *ancient chineese secret*.\n\ntruth is that they might have been partially made in other coutry than US. But if Gibson says that 100% of every guitar is/was made in USA, they would broke the law even putting screws on TRC in f.e. Canada.\n\nChina has monopoly right now for global production - its not like the old days that everythin from China was piece of garbage, still it's disturbing to see even tissues are made in that country, but also many high-end computer parts are produced in their factories. It all depends on quality checking process and dont say that some guy from USA is better than Chinesse worker cause this is racism, they might know their stuff better than we do, and for much less money."
