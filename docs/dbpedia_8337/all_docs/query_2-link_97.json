Violently repugnant.\n\n\"No problem\" I hear you say, \"you can just change it later!\"\n\nW R O N G\n\nThese pickguards have the Fender Deluxe layout on the pickup cutouts, and the Fender Standard layout on the screw holes.\n\nTotal number of available pickguards to swap : 0.\n\nBetter get the can of paint...\n\nPost by rtm on\n\n@defjef said:\n\nI'm surprised it's got either. I'd expect it to line up with nothing, have too tight pickup holes and a misaligned neck pocket cutout with a lower horn that over projects.\n\nI'm surprised it doesn't line up correctly with any market pickguards. Because HB has shown they are capable of living up to a standard, that's why we buy them and not Jay Turser, Cort, Morgan or any other dime a dozen copist brand. The moment HB loses sight of the details is when they lose the goodwill they've built on exactly the details, which all other brands like it fumble every time.\n\nThey know full well that pickguard looks horrible, the act of not lining up the holes is akin to saying \"we want this to end up in a landfill\". The bass, that is, not just the pickguard. Because proportional to the $100 the instrument costs, no amount of extra effort or expense beyond what is expected can be tolerated.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThese ugly PGs can look very good if sanded so they look used/old. It's that new sheen that makes them very ugly.\n\nBut agreed, I'm sure by now they know folks generally dislike those.\n\nAlso agree that HB might go down as Gibson is, if they don't fix their QC\n\nGet your shoit together Harley!\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIt's a weird situation with Thomann. They have to be careful not to tread on the toes of the manufacturers that they are selling so make tiny tweaks to their own brand versions so that they don't fall out. Nobody is fooled into not knowing what this ST-57DG is pretending to be, but everyone plays the game that they believe it to be a unique design and have no idea who DG might be.\n\nI guess the little tweaks that they have to make mean that no lawyer can lay one on top of another and say, \"There you go: stolen patent.\" I don't think I've ever bought an after market pickguard that exactly fits anything. Some filling, filing and redrilling has always been required. I know that Thomann sell a Harley Benton scratchplate described as fitting 'ST style guitars' and, as we know, no two of those are identical. Wonder what they mean by 'ST style guitars' anyway.\n\nPost by JAC on\n\nThere are also many companies that will cut and drill whatever template you want.\n\nFor $75-$100, nobody's going to spend 80% of an instrument's value on a cosmetics buff up.\n\nI suppose that depends on how important those cosmetics are to each person. You can find pickguard blanks starting from 20€ online.\n\nAlso, it is not just HB, I can tell you from experience that pickguards made by Fender very rarely line up perfectly from one version to the next (Squier, MIM, MIA, MIJ etc.). The same goes for many brands.\n\nPost by rtm on\n\n@defjef said:\n\nI don't think I've ever bought an after market pickguard that exactly fits anything. Some filling, filing and redrilling has always been required.\n\nThe D'Andrea pickguards for Jazz Bass on Thomann's very own site line up perfect on the HB Jazz basses. I haven't tried the Teles and Strats but I bet they are just as precisely matched.\n\nThe problem isn't just that the 5-string Precision basses don't line up with available pickguards. It's that the screw holes line up perfectly with one Fender type, but not the pickup holes and vice versa.\n\nThe 'standard' fenders have the long coil of the P-pickup on the top near the neck, while the 'deluxe' and 'signature' fenders have the long coil on the bottom towards the bridge. The PJ-5 and PJ-75 have the latter P-pickup configuration (which lines up perfect) but the screw holes from the prior configuration (which also lines up perfect)\n\nIt's like two different people were drawing this thing, and they both did their job perfectly, but what they fused together was a Frankenstein and it's incredibly frustrating that it also happens to be the very ugliest pickguard type HB does (yes, I know about the HB35)\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIt's almost as though HB are trying to say 'these are NOT Fender basses'.\n\nOut of interest, rtm, are you looking at replacing with a tort d'andrea? If so, have you seen them and do they look loads better? 'Real' even? I have a no name sunburst Jazz that came with a white pickguard. I hated it that way so sent off for a no name tort one. It looks just like an HB one: sort of deli meat. I'd change it in a trice if I thought a replacement would look fantastic. I can live with new screw holes (again!) but not another slice of salami.\n\nPost by rtm on\n\n@defjef said:\n\nOut of interest, rtm , are you looking at replacing with a tort d'andrea?

I'm strictly a red sparkle kind of guy\n\nI might try the icy blue pearloid, but I'm not really into tort...\n\nPost by salteedog on\n\n@defjef said:\n\nIt's a weird situation with Thomann.
