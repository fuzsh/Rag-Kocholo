        "text": "For me, GC is a place of last resort. Luckily for me, there's a major mom & pop called Cream City Music, that is holding out relatively well (at least at the present time) against the local GC. I think what helps it, is that it does a fair amount of vintage guitar trade worldwide, and carries a lot of gear that GC doesn't carry (Godin, Eastwood, Kay, etc.), including boutique amp lines like Dr. Z, Carr, and Victoria. It also helps that they are a Fender Custom Shop dealer, one of the larger dealers of Gretsch guitars, and that they've also been able to become authorized Gibson, Epiphone, (regular) Fender, Squier, and Jay Turser dealers. Of course, the fact that they do online internet sales, and own the building they are in (and get extra revenue from renting out space to other stores), certainly doesn't hurt. But, with GC being down the road about 2 or 3 miles from them, they've definitely had to fight, to get where they are. I remember asking a few years ago, why they had Fender Custom Shop, but not regular Fender or Squier guitar lines, and was told it was because of Fender not allowing two dealers to be so close to each other. Luckily that has changed. But it means dealing with Gibson and Fender policies that can be a pain. For instance, 2 or 3 weeks ago, they got in several of the new Epiphone Nighthawk reissues. Most of them have been sold, which is good. By the same token, the Fender Blacktops they have, have not been selling anywhere near as well. If they were a smaller mom & pop, that might really hurt them. But they also do guitar and bass lessons, and have an on-site luthier, who does both repairs and restorations. I always try to give them my business. My experiences at GC have been nothing to write home about.\n\nWe have FIVE, count em FIVE music shops, mom and pop owned...right here in Topeka. Many of which have been open for many years. They have their ups and downs but they get all of the business around because the nearest GC is in KC and frankly, I'd rather buy a guitar I can play first.\n\nThey all specialize in different areas, too. One guy sells everything guitar related (guitars, amps, etc) , but does vintage high-end stuff as a business outside of his store to generate income as well.\n\nThe other one is an authorized Fender dealer, full line of amps, guitars, basses, acoustics, and also carries a decent amount of accessories and also full PA systems and has in-house repair shop. (though their repair shop basically sucks.)\n\nThe other has full drum sets as well as low end guitars, but they also carry and repair school band instruments.\n\nThe other is a G&L and Peavey dealer, but it's also a record store (like REAL records...) and is also schools hundreds and hundreds of kids on multiple instruments (they have 8 guitar teachers IIRC)\n\nThe other is an Ibanez dealer, as well as a slew of other guitars, and also LOTS of drum equipment, and is the builder/seller of Treehouse drums.\n\nSo they all have a few things in common, but each specializes in something different than the other guys.\n\nI bought my first electric at Steam. I try to make it in there whenever I'm in Topeka visiting my family.\n\nI hate to be the disgruntled ex-employee type, but I used to work at MF, right when GC bought them out. I've had several friends and two relatives work there after I did. They are the Devil's gear shed. As a company, they treat their employees poorly as a rule.\n\nThey make it hard for the mom and pops to stay around- anyone who's been in KC a while can probably recall many stores that were ok to great that are gone now- Guitar Source just closed here, and they had been one of the last non-GC Fender dealers around here. Granted, there's some things they could've done differently IMHO, but it's pretty bummer how MF/GC have driven so many places under here. I know each GC is different, and in some places, they actually seem to be OK, and I'm happy for those of us that live in places where the local GC is a nice place. As a whole, though...yeah. Ugh.\n\nI was a manager and guitar tech at a mom and pop store for a few years... GC moved into town in 2007 after we had been struggling for about a year. They actually sent spies to the local stores in the area to check pricing of the competition, and recruiters to steal good employees away from the little guys. When the GC finally opened up, they were blowing out Fender and Gibson and Marshall/Vox (all of which my shop was an authorized dealer of) for ridiculously low prices that were below our dealer cost. This continued for a year before our owner gave up and closed our store down (he still has one store left which is also struggling despite not being near a GC). Out of the 5 major stores (including mine) in my area that were open in 2007, only two are still around. Now that these others stores have gone by the wayside, GC jacked up their prices. Although they do have stuff on clearance and at decent prices, I feel crappy having to buy stuff at the place that cost me the sweetest job I ever had. Damned big corporations!\n\nWell said. Don't forget that the complexity of government regulations make it almost impossible for a small business to operate economically these days. They just can't afford to handle the compliance issues like a bigger company. Don't beleive me? Try being a trucker.\n\nI don't buy that. My tiny business has survived when some of my competitors have not and same for sellers of guitars in my area.\n\nI also know about trucking in that I used to own them, drive them, now have customers who still have fleets.\n\nMy area has seen one nearly 100 year old business change and only sell band plus orchestra instruments and another recently closed doors but we have 4 independent guitar dealers making it because they have an appropriate mix of value added, have their niches and run their businesses well.\n\nI have 6 guitars. 3 from a local mom and pop, 2 from a local pawn shop and one from a then local luthier in the early 90's.\n\nNot everyone buys from GC. I can't stand the way the little ankle biter salesmen treat you if you are over 40.\n\nBut I am guilty though, I do buy used small stuff on-line (pups and such).\n\nAnd buying a guitar on-line is a good way to buy a guitar that you will end up being unhappy with.\n\nWe still have 3 mom and pops in my town, they all seem to be doing ok. There is no GC around here and our Best Buy doesn't sell instuments so that might answer a few things.\n\nJust goes to show \"who you buy from is just as important as what you buy\".\n\nAnd buying a guitar on-line is a good way to buy a guitar that you will end up being unhappy with..\n\nI agree with that, except that none of the local shops, including GC had the guitars I wanted.\n\nSadly the local GC didn't even have a good selection of AMS Telecasters, let alone any Casinos. A few Sheratons, 5120's, and Artcores, but not what I was looking for...\n\nI bought both a AMS Telecaster and a Elitist Casino online from Musician's Friend. I had to send both guitars back, but they then sent me good ones. No shipping charges either way, either time. It was a little inconvenient and a bit of a hassle, but I finally got what I wanted and at very good prices.\n\nMusician's Friend was easy to deal with and I'd buy from them again if I couldn't find something I wanted locally.\n\nAll my other guitars I either got on Craigslist or from people I know.\n\nI agree with that, except that none of the local shops, including GC had the guitars I wanted.\n\nSadly the local GC didn't even have a good selection of AMS Telecasters, let alone any Casinos.

The last two guitars I bought were online. The local store including GC didn't have them. Fortunately they arrived in playable shape and just needed minor set-ups and restring jobs."
