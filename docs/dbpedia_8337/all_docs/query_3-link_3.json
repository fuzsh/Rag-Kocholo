        "text": "Over the past fortnight, MBW has looked into the ownership structures of two of music’s most powerful companies: Spotify and Warner Music Group.\n\nWithin those deep dives, we published some interesting charts surrounding equity holders in both businesses â as well as facts pertaining to the voting power of each organization.\n\nToday (May 22), to continue this mini-series, we turn our attention to the largest music rights company of them all: Universal Music Group.\n\nOne byproduct of Universal being ‘spun out’ onto the Amsterdam stock exchange by its former owner Vivendi â and becoming a standalone listed company â is that it’s possible for anyone to obtain a detailed set of financial details from UMG.\n\nThat’s nowhere more true than in UMG’s annual fiscal report, which it has issued to investors in Q1 of each of the last two years.\n\nWithin that report, UMG lays out a list of its largest shareholders as of the end of December in the prior year.\n\nThis data reflects information held by the Autoriteit FinanciÃ«le Markten (AFM) in the Netherlands (with the exception of Bill Ackman’s shareholding, which is confirmed “in the AMA’s Executive and Non-Executive Directors register”).\n\nBelow, you can see this list of shareholders on December 31, 2022, as per the latest UMG annual report:\n\nBefore we delve into a couple of the players mentioned above, a few important caveats:\n\nOther than Bill Ackman and Fidelity Holdings â whose end-of-2022 shareholdings were confirmed to financial bodies in November that year â the stakes of the other shareholders were all last confirmed in September 2021, as UMG went public in Amsterdam;\n\nBill Ackman’s holdings are held via a vehicle called “PS VII Master LP” â in which the ‘PS’ stands for ‘Pershing Square’. Pershing Square and its affiliates acquired 10% of Universal Music Group for around USD $4 billion in summer 2021;\n\nVincent BollorÃ©’s holdings in UMG are shared between multiple vehicles including BollorÃ© Participations SE, BollorÃ© SE, and Omnium BollorÃ©;\n\nConcerto Partners LLC is the Tencent-led consortium that acquired 20% of UMG, across two agreements, in 2020 and 2021. The total price of that 20% acquisition? EUR â¬6 billion, or around USD $7.4 billion at the time;\n\nThe latest UMG annual report makes clear: “It is possible that the stated percentages of capital interest [above] differ from the actual percentages of capital interest as the Shareholders may only be required to notify the AFM in the event that their percentage of capital interest reaches, exceeds or falls below one of the thresholds.”\n\nWith all of that in mind, two things in particular jump out about UMG’s modern-day institutional investors:\n\n1) The Vivendi connection remains strong\n\nWhen UMG floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange in September 2021, the music company’s former majority-owner, Paris-headquartered media empire Vivendi, reduced its shareholding in UMG to 10%.\n\nHowever, the 18.01% shareholding in UMG that continues to be held by French media mogul (and ex-Vivendi Chairman) Vincent BollorÃ© tells us that UMG’s connections to Vivendi remain solid.\n\nVincent BollorÃ©, via multiple vehicles (‘the BollorÃ© Group’) is reported to control around 30% of the share capital in Vivendi; his son, Yannick BollorÃ©, is the Chairman of Vivendi’s supervisory board as well as the CEO of Havas.\n\nCombined, Vivendi’s 10% stake in Universal plus Vincent BollorÃ©’s 18% stake in the music company, makes the Vivendi/BollorÃ© â if viewed as a single alliance â the largest stakeholder in the modern Universal Music Group.\n\n2) Keep an eye on Fidelity Investments\n\nThe minority-shareholding structure of the modern music business is famously incestuous.\n\nA good example: Tencent Holdings â sometimes via majority-owned subsidiary Tencent Music Entertainment â owns/has owned stakes in Spotify, Warner Music Group and other music-adjacent companies like Epic Games.\n\nBut until now, not a lot of attention in that narrative has been shone towards Fidelity Investments (aka FMR LLC).\n\nAs MBW digs into through here, Fidelity (as shown above) now owns 3.02% of Universal Music Group â a stake currently worth around USD $1.1 billion.\n\nAnd as we demonstrated last week, Boston-headquartered Fidelity owns a 3.3% stake in Warner Music Group â which is currently worth approximately $450 million."
