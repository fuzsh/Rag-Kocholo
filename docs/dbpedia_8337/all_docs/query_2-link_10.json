        "text": "Well went to check 'em out for myself, and found out that even though they were deemed \"used\" by GC, they were in fact new, GC just got them from a dealer that went under. Now from what I got from playing it...\n\nPro's\n\n- Thinner neck than my Epi Custom (Good for my smaller hands lol)\n\n- Lightweight, easy on the back\n\n- P'ups have pretty decent growl\n\n- Same dimensions for bridge/tailpiece, and nut as Epi's\n\nCon's\n\n- Goes out of tune after a few bends\n\n- Annoying rattle from bridge\n\n- P'up's could use a little more growl\n\n- Being lightweight doesn't remind me of a true Lester\n\nObviously with these guitars, a few things swapped and this thing could be a pretty decent guitar. It could definitely be a good little studio guitar for sure. Swap the tuners, the nut, the bride/tailpiece, P'up's and Pots/Caps (sounds like what a lot of people to their Lester even if they're Gibby's or Epi's...) and it would rock. Definitely a good beginner guitar no doubt, but yes there are better quality built pieces out there, just expect to pay more. Just my 2 cents after going and checking 'em out after I started this thread.\n\nI think you just spent three times or more than what the guitar cost, plus you have to add labor to that. You still do not know the quality of the body and neck and still may not like it after spending time and money to modify it.\n\nI heard mention of no mojo and that new pups will not help. That makes it sound as if the quality of wood may not be that desirable.\n\nTake the $500-$600 you just spent and find a nice 2nd hand guitar. My bet is that you will be happier in the end.\n\nNever was it said it cost that much. An Epi yes, but the JT I looked at was $140 \"used\" when in fact itwas new, but GC said since they aren't a JT dealer, they have to sell it as used. Plastic was still on everything. I'm not justifying why to get one, but I'm just pointing out that modifying it could yield a decent guitar and still be under a decent Epi price wise.\n\nOK, obviously there are a lot of Turser haters on here. The guitars are all made in China, just around the corner from the Epiphone factory that Gibson likes to talk about. In fact, if you do some Internet searching, you will discover that the same factory that makes Turser also exports to both Gibson and Epiphone in Tennessee. I am not sure what they are shipping but they turn out something that these brands use in some way.\n\nAs for the Turser guitars, they are what they say they are. As with most of these China imports it is hit or miss on a particular guitar and I would not buy one sight unseen. GC is selling these \"used\" Tursers all over the country. I got a 220 Gold Top myself. And I was able to register it as a new purchase under warranty on the Turser website.\n\nI did not care for the black or sunburst models they had but the GT model fit and finish was outstanding. The body is not laminate or pressboard and solid one piece. It is chambered, as are many Gibson LP models, thus reducing the weight. The neck is one piece as well, at least on mine. According to Turser CS, the GT has a mahogany body and neck, and the other LP models have an alder body and a maple neck. At least that is what they told me via email. The electronics are as good as any China import. Pups are hot, but are not microphonic as some have stated. Mine holds tune fine, no fret buzz anywhere. The nut is made by Graphtech, which produces all of Turser's nuts according to the Graphtech website. I think the bridge is the weakest part of the guitar, but it seems to work OK. I think the tuners are Wilkenson's without the name on them. They appear to be identical. I had a GC tech open it up and we looked at everything prior to my purchase and he said he thought it looked better than most of the imports he saw. The wires and soldering are all neat and strong on my particular model. I was planning on making some upgrades but so far I have not spent a dime on it except to replace the stock strings with Slinkys. The guitar was set up from the factory with a low action and was intonated.\n\nAs for sound, it is pretty good. I have had some experienced players over and they all thought it was a great deal for the money. I think it plays as well as Epiphone, and I have one of those for comparison. I like its lighter weight and the gold finish is beautiful. Binding is good, frets are tight and smooth. All in all a good guitar for the price. To each his own but for $130 or $140 its a great LP copy IMHO. If you check out the Fender boards, most people on there think the Turser Strat and Tele copies are a very good bargain. Hey if I had two grand I would get a Gibson but for $140 I can't beat what I have now."
