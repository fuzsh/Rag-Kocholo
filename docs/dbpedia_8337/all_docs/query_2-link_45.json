        "text": "I just bought a Jay Turser SG knockoff. I adjusted it so that it feels nice, but I have one beef with it. The tune-o-matic bridge has a couple loose saddles.\n\nMy choices are:\n\na) Stuff something in there that keeps it from rattling. I haven't been successful in doing this. Anybody have any ideas?\n\nb) buy a new bridge. Are these fake tune-o-matics the same dimensions as a real one? Will I have to drill new holes and stuff to get a good one on there? or is it the same?\n\nany other suggestions will be helpful (not including buying a new guitar).\n\nthe saddle of the low E string sort of rocks on the screw. I'm not sure of all the correct names of the parts, but basically it doesn't touch both sides of the little groove that it sits in. It really only wobbles when I play hard. I can wiggle it with my fingers quite easily.\n\nNot sure if that made any sense.\n\nDo you mean the saddle rocks in the bridge or the string moves in the saddle slot? Assuming the saddle is where you want it for correct intonation and action, have you tried seeing if the adjustment screw is pulled up tight in the thread of the saddle? If yes you should return it. You can pack it out but as it's a new, at least to you it should be right. That shouldn't happen if the saddle and bridge are set right.\n\nyeah, the saddle rocks in the bridge.\n\nShipping and returning it would cost more than the guitar is worth. Plus I've put quite a bit of work into it to make it feel the way I like.\n\nSo have you checked that there is no slack on the thread?\n\nIf so, is the stop bar to high. You need a bit of break angle on some of them. Lower the stop bar a bit.\n\nAre you 100% convinced it's the saddle thats rattling? Although not that uncommon it's not the first thing I'd suspect. As I said string tension is usually enough to stop things like that.\n\nWhat action do you have? Are you using drop tuning? More info\n\nSo have you checked that there is no slack on the thread?\n\nIf so, is the stop bar to high. You need a bit of break angle on some of them.

More info\n\nI am 100% convinced that it's the saddle, because I can wiggle it with my fingers.\n\nFrom what I can see, the saddle has three points of contact with the bridge\n\n1) the screw\n\n2-3) the points where the saddle lies in the groove.\n\nBecause the screw doesnt' move, this seems to leave little room for error to make the other to points make contact at the same time. It's kind of like a teeter totter.\n\nStandard tuning. The dropbar is as low as it goes. I'm just not sure if this is a problem other's have run into or if I just got a screwy bridge.\n\nI am 100% convinced that it's the saddle, because I can wiggle it with my fingers.\n\nFrom what I can see, the saddle has three points of contact with the bridge\n\n1) the screw\n\n2-3) the points where the saddle lies in the groove.\n\nBecause the screw doesnt' move, this seems to leave little room for error to make the other to points make contact at the same time.

They said that clear nail varnish will lock saddles in place firmly enough to stop them rattling. Significantly, the bond is so loose that if intonation needs to be altered in the future, a turn of the screw will break the dried varnish.\n\nObviously, this could be bullshit, but is it at least worth suggesting?\n\nMeasure the distance between the posts. You will probably be able to find a good one to replace it. I'd recommend the Tone-Pros version, which is very nice and locks tight to the posts. They make several different versions, and one of them is probably what you need. You can get all the sizes from either Allparts or WD.\n\nLight\n\n\"Cowards can never be moral.\"\n\nM.K.

It may get you through a gig or two. A bit like the super glue in the nut slot trick. Best to get it sorted once and for all. Dount get any on the finish if you do try that.\n\nAddressing one of your other questions, yes Turser builds most of their stuff to spec from Gibson, Fender, etc. I sold them in a shop for about a year and sure enough, a customer came in with this problem. He had purchased an expensive replacement bridge from MF or somewhere. It fit becuase that's how Turser makes it's money. From what I know, they buy the specs from the big companies, send em to China and piece them together with the cheapest stuff around. Good guitars if you ask me. I owned the 335 knock off for awhile. These are all good suggestions and I would try them first, as Im sure you already have. If it comes down to it, a gibson bridge will fit - if you want to shell out the cash.\n\nGood Luck"
