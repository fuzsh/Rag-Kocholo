        "text": "JT 133.. ES 335 knockoff... Dirt cheap from Music 123\n\n$183 shipped.\n\nVery nice trans red... B stock.. Minor finish imperfections if you look hard enough I suppose, but I'm not that anal. Fit and finish was nice.. Kinda.. (more about this in a bit) . Intonation was very close except for the crappy 009 strings they strung the guitar with...action was low, soft and fast....\n\nWhen I first got the guitar I was dismayed and was about to send it back for a refund.. B string was fretting out midneck when bending... To make a long story short, I lightly tapped a few frets down a touch, turned the truss rod about 1/8 turn to give just a touch more relief, and put a new set of 10's on.\n\nThis did the trick.. the guitar plays as well as anything I have,and I am happy with it. Soundwise it is very good... Pickups sound like they have Alnico magnets,,, Warm and musical , good punch and clarity throughout the playing range.. nicely hot but not too powerful ,,, just about right...It sounds like a decent semi should.\n\n. Not quite as nice as my 67 ES 335 or Trini Lopez did a few years back, but BETTER than my 60's Guild Starfires and WAYYYY better than the Hamer Korean 335 knockoff I dumped last year.. Echotone... what a mutt.. I had an Agile AS 820, the fit and finish was better than this Turser, setup about the same, but was real bad tonewise even with a pickup swap.. The guitar was well built but had a dead tone.. no ring or resonance in the body.. You buy a semi so you can do things like long sustain and controlled feedback etc, but the Agile's dense wood just would not respond.. i sold it with a few weeks... The Turser has much better response in this regard..\n\nThe Turser had a few other issues besides what I mentioned already... The guitar was constantly going out of tune with the stock strings.. After an hour or two, I got disgusted, and pulled the strings... Lo and behold, EVERY tuner key was loose.. ALL the top nuts were loose as hell, and ALL the screws in back were less than halfway in!!!.. A second with a pliers and Phillips corrected this problem.... SHOULD have been caught in the \"QC inspection LOL\"... also, looking through the f holes you can see some real cheap paper tape over electrical connections .. uh oh... This WAS a B stock after all.. Everything works well, so I'll leave that untouched for now....\n\nThe Turser guitars continue to impress me and this is my 4th.. they all sound and play VERY well, but ALL needed tweaking as is the case with a LOT of these Chinese guitars\n\nAfter adjustments ,I like the Tursers better than most other cheap brands... mostly due to sound quality... My Agiles were ok,very well built, but they are all gone... I could NOT get them to sound sweet to me, even with pickups replaced.. I just don't like the heavy wood they use.. It seems to rob tone, but thats another story\n\nThis JT 133 is a VERY nice axe with a VERY authentic 335 tone.better than many, and stands up to most. Just be prepared to do some teakage...\n\nMan ,EVERYTHING needs tweaking these days it seems, unless you pop for a $2000 + guitar... It is a GREAT time to be a guitarist... Less than $200, and I'm back in the 335 game, with a pretty red guitar thats as good as a lot of guitars costing 4-5 times as much.\n\nNo it is NOT as good a guitar as a vintage 335, but they are closing in on $25,000 for a clean mid 60's model.\n\nHowever it WILL do the same job, and I'll bet with a set of Seth Lovers in it will sound about as good.\n\nYes the Tursers are basically plywood, but guess what.. so are the original 335's AND Starfires.... Laminates all...\n\nIf you are gassin' for a 335, consider the Turser, if you can set a guitar up, you will NOT find a better sounding/playing semi in this price range IMHO... bob\n\nHey SB, what's shakin? Haven't seen you around these parts for awhile. Always enjoy your posts cause it's rather obvious you know what you're talkin about and you could give a rat's ass about conventional wisdom.\n\nHave to admit you're giving me some serious 335 gas however. I never would have dreamed it was possible to get a decent one for under $500. My amp guy surprised me the other day when he said his backup (for his Gretsch) in his band was a Turser and went on about how good it was. I have to admit that my preconception was Turser = junk before that.\n\nInteresting thoughts on the Hamer Echotone, and Agile lines which I'd heard good things about. Like I say, I respect your opinion - I really think alot of people either: a) play through crappy amps b) play almost exclusively high gain, heavily distorted or c) have no point of reference. And that's not a blanket indictment either - as we all know every guitar is a little different.\n\nYour gushing reminds me of myself with my latest toy - a Telestar Lisa I found on Musicgoround in KY for just under $200 shipped. The only one I've seen online in ages which was priced to sell due to some discoloration (from stickers). The frets are like new and everything works like it should - like you I had to adjust the action and tweak the trussrod. I'd been looking for one for some time as one of my Blues heroes Johnny \"Yarddog\" Jones played one on a recent CD I own. It's a Dano type guitar, a little headstock heavy, but it stays in tune great and is absolutely the greatest sounding blues guitar I've played for that BB King \"Lucille\" type sound. I did play a real Lucille once in a Pawn shop but in all fairness it was trashed and sounded like it, so I can't really compare the two personally.\n\nThanks for the replies all.. I was not saying Agiles are bad, just that I could not get them to sound right to me..always seemed a little cold and lifeless.\n\nThe Turser tone has a little more \"juicy goodness\"...\n\nAgain ,this is what it is.. a cheap ass guitar the LOOKS like an expensive guitar and plays and sounds pretty good.\n\nThe world abounds in them.\n\nAll you old timers think back 30 years.. We had Gibson, Fender,Guild Gretsch.... If you were lucky you had a strat or Paul... If you needed a semi, you looked for a 335 if you could afford it[not many could] or a Starfire .... If not you bought a cheap piece of crap from Japan when Japan was making the worst junk on earth... Of course, later on Ibanez made some great guitars, but they were just starting to come up with good stuff in the early mid 70's..\n\nNowadays we have instant gratification... You can buy a lovely, well built guitar in ANY configuration you like, touch up the \"settings\" a bit and start wankin' ... maybe change the pickups or pots, but more and more, even that is becoming less important... It really is a GREAT time for guitarists...\n\n30 years ago, you had an electric and maybe an acoustic... If you were lucky you had 2 electrics and an acoustic.. Today, guys have 50,60,70 axes and way beyond.... I'm down to 10 guitars and 2 pedal steels and feel like I'm sadly lacking...\n\nThese cheap guitars have been great , but I only wish it was American labor that built them.... not the Commies.\n\nActually my new favorite brand is Godin.. VERY reasonable, TOP shelf , uncompromising build quality, and assembled here in the US with Canadian parts... Used to be anyway, I hope its STILL that way..bob"
