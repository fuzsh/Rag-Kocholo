        "text": "Hi Jeremy,\n\nSadly, it looks like Crescent guitars are not very worthwhile. Harmony Central, which generally gives artificially-inflated glowing reviews of gear, puts this one through the wringer.\n\nIs it being shipped to you, or do you have a chance to back out of the purchase? If you're looking for a cheap but decent Strat copy, I might recommend either Rondo Music or Xaviere guitars. While not top of the line, both companies will get you a strat that is at least passable, and will give you a good foothold. Rondo has a good selection of left-handed guitars.\n\nDon't know a thing about 'em.\n\nHere's the deal with really cheap guitars... It's a total crapshoot if you're going to get something that's remotely playable.\n\nCNC routing machinery has made it insanely easy to cut wood and make accurate body shapes. However, there is still some hand fitting to a guitar. Really cheap guitar companies skimp in the following areas to save money.\n\nQuality and number of pieces of wood in the manufacture of the guitar.\n\nQuality of pickups, pots, and wiring.\n\nQuality of tuners, nut and bridge.\n\nQuality control after the thing is put together.\n\nSo, what's missing? QUALITY. That's not saying that the guitar won't be serviceable, but odds are you're gonna have to deal with higher action, buzzing frets, scratchy pots, and a guitar that may not stay in tune long enough to make it through a whole Metallica song.\n\nMy advice? Don't let the excitement of getting a new guitar outweigh good old fashioned common sense. Squier, Jackson, ESP/LTD, and others all make good guitars in the $250-$400 range new, and less than that if you go used.\n\nIf it was me, I'd pass. Good luck!\n\nIf you are that strapped for cash, send me a PM. I have an old Epi Strat that I tinkered with, in order to learn about pots, switches and pickups. It's served it's purpose, and I'd gladly send it to you to get you started.\n\nSpend your money on a decent little amp.\n\nRondoMusic always has lefty guitar on sale in their emails. There should be a plenty of lower priced ones there that will be better than the Crecent.\n\nJeremy, don't get in too much of a hurry buying that first guitar... Check out these first! (skip past the pink ones)\n\nhttp://www.rondomusic.com/electricguitarleft.html\n\nFrom what I heard when I looked at reviews last night it's a decent starter guitar at best. The main reason i'm buying it is because it comes with another $100 worth of stuff and everything is only $70. I'm getting the guitar, a 10watt amp, and distortion pedal, picks, a whammy bar, plus amp cables and whatnot. I will probably sell this guitar once i learn how to play better and get one thats top of the line. But, thanks for the help everyone. I'm going to pick it up at 6:30 tonight, I will post pictures and let everyone know how it plays for reference."
