Mahalo ukuleles are proudly designed, built and tested by their extremely talented people from their own, purpose-built, state-of-the-art facility. Their vision is to be the world’s leading manufacturer of ukuleles of excellent quality and value for money that enhance and inspire a lifetime of playing music. They are committed to the highest standards of production, ethics and integrity and care for their employees and their families, their customers and users of their products, and the world in which we all live. Every Mahalo instrument is built with a purpose – to provide the world with quality, affordable instruments that enhance and inspire a lifetime of playing music. They use the best selected woods sustainably harvested from renewable forests, strive to conserve resources, preserve natural habitats, and prevent pollution. Their factories conform strictly to local and international labor laws, and quality control is overseen by a highly qualified team of technicians employed exclusively by Mahalo. Their purpose-built factory in Surabaya, Indonesia, is committed to producing instruments with features and specifications of a higher standard than those offered by their competitors in similar price points."
