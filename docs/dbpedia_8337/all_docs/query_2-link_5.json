I wonder how many other brands besides Lyon and Oscar Schmidt are essentially the same brand.\n\nSamick may make more guitars\n\nand basses for other companies\n\nthan any other manufacture.\n\nMany Silvertones, Ibanez and\n\nrumor has it, some Fender and\n\nGibson imports.\n\nHere's an Abilene by Samick I\n\nused to have. It has a traditional\n\nSamick headstock with the name\n\n\"Abaline\" on it,\n\nThis exact bass, and numerous\n\ndesigns are shared by different\n\nnames and made by Samick.\n\nFor many years, they made more\n\nguitars and pianos than any one\n\nelse.\n\nTabdog"
