        "text": "About Samick Music Corp.\n\nEstablished in 1958, Samick Musical Instruments Co. Ltd. has over 50 years of experience manufacturing high quality musical instruments. With a manufacturing capability of more than a half million guitars per year in factories located in Korea, Indonesia, China and the United States, Samick also ranks as the world’s leading stringed instrument producer.\n\nIn 2006, Samick moved its American corporate headquarters to Gallatin, Tennessee, located just outside of Nashville. A brand new two-story, 14,000-square foot Adams Federal Colonial-style building was constructed alongside a 200,000-square foot warehouse, used for piano manufacturing, as well as piano and guitar warehousing and service.\n\nThe craftsmanship developed over the years has made Samick one of the largest and most knowledgeable producers of musical instruments in the world today. Samick’s pianos are sold under the Samick name as well as under a variety of brand names, including William Knabe & Co., Seiler, Pramberger, and Samick Digital. The company sells its guitars under its own brand names, including Samick, Greg Bennett Signature series, and Silvertone."
