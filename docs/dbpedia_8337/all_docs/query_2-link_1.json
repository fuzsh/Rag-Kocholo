        "text": "I have an Eastwood Rocket bass. Made in China. I have had it for about 3 weeks and still have not been able to play it properly for more than 15 minutes. It shipped with 2 bad strings. replace them, but the string guage was uneven. Got a set in and the \"g\" string broke immediately. Got a replacement string and it broke after 15 minutes. I just took all the strings off and started trying to find any and all sharp edges that may break a string.\n\nI hear the Korean made Eastwood's are much better quality. I just really liked the Rocket bass' look. I'll just have to \"be a luthier\" to get it set up right.\n\nI was looking into them... beautiful stuff, but I guess I won't pay $500 for a chinese guitar with problems.\n\nI'd like to know which ones are korean and which ones are chinese... I'll have to ask.\n\nCort = Korea & Indonesia IMHO, even my cheap ones are MII.\n\nSaw some Alden's on eBay Germany which had a striking resemble to the Eastwoods, but those were made by Muse in Korea (according to the seller). Dunno if that's correct though.\n\nThese are the British models though, could be from a different factory:\n\nAlso, good guitars can be made in China IF they are given the right components and not forced to do everything on the cheap.\n\nMy $200 JT China Tele is as good a guitar as my MIK ones.\n\nOriginally posted by WarmMachineHead\n\nI was looking into them... beautiful stuff, but I guess I won't pay $500 for a chinese guitar with problems.\n\nI'd like to know which ones are korean and which ones are chinese... I'll have to ask.\n\nFor what it's worth, the guitars UNDER $500 are the only ones made in China. Anything above $500 is made in Korea (according to Mike, the company owner). I don't think any of his guitars are priced right at $500.\n\nI bought a made-in-China LP Studio copy. QC was ATROCIOUS. It's usable, but only after some work.\n\nThe made-in-Koreas seem to be a lot better, but I have no first-hand experience with them.\n\nI am looking at the Savannah and the Sidejack, both below $500, so I guess they are MIC, tomorrow I'll know when Mike answers...\n\nthey look awesome, but I cannot see myself paying $500 for a chinese guitar, even if it looks amazing and is a decent guitar.\n\nHope they are korean, my rig would look killer and korean guitars are great.\n\nOriginally posted by WarmMachineHead\n\nI am looking at the Savannah and the Sidejack, both below $500, so I guess they are MIC, tomorrow I'll know when Mike answers...\n\nthey look awesome, but I cannot see myself paying $500 for a chinese guitar, even if it looks amazing and is a decent guitar.\n\nHope they are korean, my rig would look killer and korean guitars are great.\n\nHave you ever considered that you are not only paying for the work, but also for the components which go into a guitar? Like wood, pickups, a BURNS tremolo, bridges, tuners, controls for example?\n\nI own 2 Korean guitars which I got for less than $400, no special hardware on them though (no brand stuff). I also got a couple of Chinese guitars which ran between $150 and $200 and are of equal build quality. You always get what the SELLER pays for. Work in China can be sloppy or good (depending on how much he is willing to pay). Same goes for the components used.\n\nOriginally posted by ArKay\n\nHave you ever considered that you are not only paying for the work, but also for the components which go into a guitar?

Only the work is cheaper there, if the distributer pays more for the components (which can even be of HIS choice) and has a good QC you will get as fine an instrument as from a Korean factory, I'm pretty sure about that.\n\nI'm impressed with the $200 JT Tele I got, I even paid about >$350 for it since I had to pay postage to Germany and customs. It came with a usuable setup out of the box. I'm also impressed with the $150 Keiper LP copy I own, even though I changed the pickups, those weren't too good.\n\nIf you would look at the ratings of the guitars you were considering over here at the HC review database you would notice that they could well be worth their money. They even have sound clips of all of their models on the page, so you can hear that you're not getting some cheap, crappy standard pickups.\n\nJust because it's MIC doesn't mean it has be worth less. A $300 Chinese guitar could most likely impress you more than a $300 MIK."
