        "text": "Are you looking for a new guitar and considering trying Jay Turser?\n\nWe’ve got you covered!\n\nIn this Jay Turser Guitar Review, we aim to provide an in-depth understanding of this underrated brand, its offerings, and what you can expect when picking up one of its instruments.\n\nBy the end of this review, you’ll have a clearer picture of whether a Jay Turser guitar is the right choice for you.\n\nAnd if you want to check out one of my other brand reviews, I have also written about Esteban guitars.\n\nI didn’t know much about this brand till I started doing research for this article.\n\nBut here’s what I found.\n\nJay Turser Guitar Review: Background\n\nJay Turser Guitars is not exactly the best-known brand.\n\nHowever, they have had a somewhat successful run over the years.\n\nThe company originally started back in 1988 in the United States.\n\nDuring the 1990s, they had more commercial success in the marketplace focusing specifically on budget guitars.\n\nThese have all been beginner-friendly instruments or inexpensive alternatives to other brands.\n\nBut despite this, they still had a pretty good reputation.\n\nIt’s not something that you usually expect from a brand that exclusively does budget stuff.\n\nWhat’s more, in 2004, Guitar Player magazine readers chose them as the best value brand.\n\nIn 2006, after years of successful business, American Music and Sound acquired the brand.\n\nHowever, it seems that Jay Turser Guitars changed ownership over the years.\n\nAfter a while, they were purchased by U.S. Music Corporation.\n\nLater on, Jam Industries, based in Canada bought them.\n\nAt this point, Jay Turser is a part of Davitt & Hanser.\n\nAnd Davitt & Hanser is a part of Jam Industries.\n\nWhat’s also really interesting is that Jay Turser Guitars have been collaborating with Graph Tech Guitar Labs since 2008.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that all of their instruments are manufactured in China.\n\nGuitars They Offer\n\nAlthough they’ve been around for a while, today, they offer a limited number of models.\n\nTheir electric guitar collection is modest as well as their electric bass guitars.\n\nIt seems that their main focus is on acoustic guitars at this point.\n\nThey have some interesting models to offer, all of which are budget-friendly.\n\nBut let’s see what Jay Turner Guitars have to offer within each of these categories.\n\nThese are the current models available as of now.\n\nElectric Guitars\n\nTheir line of electric guitars consists of two series, 300 and LT.\n\n300 Series\n\nThe 300 series includes three models. These are:\n\nJT-30\n\nJT-300\n\nand JT-300M\n\nThe JT-30 and JT-300 models are essentially Stratocaster copies.\n\nThough the JT-30 has smaller 3/4 size solid body for players with small hands and want a lightweight electric guitar.\n\nThey all come in classic style, solid body, gloss finish, rosewood fretboard with three single-coil pickups.\n\nThe Jay Turser (JT) comes with a versatile 5-way selector switch, which allows you to easily switch between the neck pickup, bridge pickups, or a combination of both.\n\nThis feature, along with the fulcrum tremolo bridge, ensures that you can achieve the perfect intonation and sound for your desired musical style.\n\nThe JT-300M model is the same as the other two models, with a white pickguard and chrome die-cast machines, but it is noticeably different as it comes with a maple fretboard.\n\nThis is a pretty decent guitar, and you can check it out in the video below:\n\nAlso, this series’ double cutaway design allows easy access to the higher frets, making it a great option for those who play jazz, pop, or other styles requiring a lot of fretwork.\n\nAn interesting feature of the Jay Turser JT guitars is their scale length, which measures 22.5″ from the nut to the bridge, compared to the standard 25.5″ found on Stratocasters.\n\nThis shorter scale length doesn’t compromise the guitar’s design or playability.\n\nIn fact, it’s quite advantageous for beginners and younger players just entering the guitars world, as it provides a more comfortable playing experience.\n\nLT Series\n\nThe LT series features 6 models:\n\nJT-LT\n\nJT-LT/RW\n\nJT-LTCUSTOM/DLX\n\nJT-LTP\n\nJT-LTCRUSDLX\n\nJT-LTCustom69\n\nThis series is essentially a Telecaster copy. However, it comes with a maple neck and a rosewood fingerboard.\n\nOther than that, we have the standard configuration with two single-coil pickups and scale length of 25-1/2″.\n\nHere’s what this model sounds like with a clean tone.\n\nAll of the four electric guitar models at the moment come with the same 6-in-line headstock design.\n\nAcoustic Guitars\n\nAs for acoustic guitars, there are three series.\n\nThese are:\n\nJay J\n\nJay Jr.\n\nJTA.\n\nJAY J Series\n\nThe Jay J series has four models:\n\nJJ45\n\nJJ45-PAK\n\nJJ45F\n\nJJ45LH (Left Hand)\n\nThese models feature the regular dreadnaught body shape.\n\nAll of these guitars are pretty similar, bearing basswood bodies, mahogany necks, gloss finish, and die-cast machine heads.\n\nJJ45 and JJ45F have adjustable truss rod.\n\nJJ45-PAK and JJ45LH have 3/4 dreadnaught body shapes.\n\nA fantastic travel guitar and a terrific guitar for musicians searching for a smaller-bodied instrument or students with smaller hands.\n\nJay Jr. Series\n\nThe Jay Jr. is a series of four models:\n\nJJ43\n\nJJ43-PAK\n\nJJ43F\n\nJJ43LH (Left Hand)\n\nThe materials are pretty much the same as with the Jay J series. However, we have what appears to be the 000 body shape, which means shallower than dreadnaught.\n\nJTA Series\n\nThe JTA series has two models:\n\nJTA-424QCET\n\nJTA-424QCET LH (Left Hand)\n\nFinally, the JTA series features jumbo body shapes, as well as a cutaway design.\n\nAdditionally, these also come with a preamp and a tuner, as well as a piezo pickup setup.\n\nThey also have catalpa bodies, rosewood fretboard, and mahogany necks.\n\nThey’re the most advanced acoustic series offered by Jay Turser Guitars.\n\nIf you’re interested with this series, grab the JTA-424QCET here:\n\nBass Guitars\n\nNow, let’s check the Jay Turser’s bass guitars. Their bass guitars line consists of two series, 400 and CL.\n\nThe 400 series has three models:\n\nJTB-40\n\nJTB-400C\n\nJTB-402\n\nThose from the 400 series are copies of Fender Precision basses.\n\nThe JTB-40 has P Style 3/4 size solid body guitar is a fantastic option for those who are just starting their musical journey or have smaller hands.\n\nSame with their other guitars, this

Guitar of Jay Turser from Guitar Center:\n\nInteresting Discontinued Models\n\nSure, we only have a limited number of pretty basic models today.\n\nHowever, Jay Turser had some pretty interesting guitars, even experimental stuff.\n\nBut being a lesser-known brand, it’s kind of hard to dig them all up.\n\nBut one of their famous guitars was the Warlord.\n\nIt’s a heavily redesigned “Flying V” guitar.\n\nIts body shape kind of reminds me of Dean Michael Amott’s signature model.\n\nHere’s a video detailing the instrument.\n\nThey also experimented with shapes back in the day.\n\nFor instance, there was a pretty crazy Shark Guitar model.\n\nYou can check it out in the player below.\n\nThis also includes the Stiletté Futuré with an aluminum body.\n\nHowever, I wasn’t able to find any videos of it online.\n\nOther Guitar Series Inspired by Famous Guitar Brands\n\nAnother interesting series of Jay Turser guitars are the JT-50 and JT-200 series.\n\nJT-50 Series\n\nThis series has 6 models:\n\nJT-50\n\nJT-50 Custom\n\nJT-50 Custom 12\n\nJT-55C\n\nJT-55P\n\nJT-XG2\n\nThis guitar is a copy of Gibson’s classic SG with a slightly modified body shape.\n\nThis range focuses on

inspiration from the classic Les Paul design.\n\nThese somewhat vintage-style six-string instruments primarily target younger musicians who desire Gibson aesthetics and authentic sound.\n\nMoreover, these models offer affordability without compromising quality.\n\nThe JT-200 series boasts a sturdy, single-cut construction with a carved top featuring a mahogany back and a maple top.\n\nA standard two-piece bridge section is complemented by dual active humbucker pickups.\n\nThe set-in mahogany neck is adorned with a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, highlighted by a unique serpent inlay that spans the entire fretboard.\n\nTake a look at the JT-220D video demo below:\n\nGet your JT-200PRO from Guitar Center:\n\nJay Turser Guitar Review: Basswood Body\n\nWhen you see a basswood body mentioned in the context of a guitar, it means that the main material used to create the guitar body is basswood.\n\nThis light and somewhat soft hardwood is a popular choice for crafting guitars, particularly electric models.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks to using basswood for guitar making.\n\nDue to its softer nature, it can be more vulnerable to nicks and wear compared to sturdier woods like mahogany or maple.\n\nAdditionally, some musicians might feel that the tonal quality of basswood-bodied guitars lacks the warmth or depth of instruments from other tonewoods.\n\nJay Turser Guitar Review: Maple or Rosewood Fretboard?\n\nSo you’ve been seeing 2 types of fretboard Jay Turser offers: Maple and Rosewood.\n\nBoth have unique characteristics that appeal to different players.\n\nMaple is a light-colored hardwood with brighter, snappier sound with more pronounced high-end frequencies.\n\nRosewood, on the other hand, is a dark-colored, dense hardwood with a more porous, open-grained texture.\n\nIt produces a warmer, richer sound with a more balanced frequency response, emphasizing mid and low-end frequencies.\n\nMaple fretboards are known for their durability, thanks to their ability to withstand environmental changes and temperature shifts.\n\nConversely, rosewood fretboards boast a robustness that outshines their maple counterparts.\n\nThe choice of maple or rosewood can significantly impact your guitar’s sound and overall playability.\n\nJay Turser Guitar Review: Affordability and Value for Money\n\nWhen purchasing a guitar, your budget can significantly influence

that these are all budget-friendly guitars. With that said, you can’t expect too much from them.\n\nOn the other hand, they perform decently well and, in my opinion, are worth the price.\n\nOverall, these are Chinese-made inexpensive copies of popular American-made designs.\n\nThey get the job done and are pretty great as beginner instruments.\n\nWith some minor modifications, they can serve as backup guitars and basses.\n\nBut what I’m discouraged about is the fact that there’s not much info on them.\n\nSure, these guitars are okay, but specs on these are hard to find which isn’t uncommon for cheaper brands.\n\nIf you’re a beginner at playing the guitar and want to hone your guitar skills, check out this Guitar Exercises for Beginners book:\n\nJay Turser Guitar Review: Are They Worth It?\n\nAt the end of the day, Jay Turser guitars have the reputation of being good, not great.\n\nYou can expect a reliable instrument with no bells and whistles.\n\nSure, the pickups could be better.\n\nBut you can easily swap them for something else and you’ve got yourself a pretty decent guitar!\n\nThe present-day electric and acoustic guitars are okay.\n\nBut the company’s older stuff seems underrated.\n\nIf you happen to stumble upon one of these, they’re worth checking out.\n\nThey’re somewhat obscure, but they shouldn’t be too expensive.\n\nJay Turser Guitar Review: Conclusion\n\nIn summing up our Jay Turser Guitar Review, we’ve covered the brand’s history, lineup, quality, craftsmanship, playability, affordability, and presence in the music community.\n\nIt’s been a pleasure exploring this brand and sharing personal thoughts along the way.\n\nBut don’t just take my word for it – go ahead and give them a try!\n\nI hope this article has helped you learn a bit more about this brand.\n\nWe would love to hear your thoughts on Jay Turser guitars.\n\nFeel free to share your own experiences, opinions, and insights in the comment section below.\n\nAs usual, let me know if you have questions!"
