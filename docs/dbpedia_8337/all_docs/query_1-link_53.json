        "text": "Warchime-Myers Mansion\n\nHeart of Hanover\n\nThe Myers Mansion was built over a period of three years, beginning in 1911, as the residence of Clinton N. Myers of Hanover Shoe Company. William Warehime generously donated the Warehime-Myers Mansion at 305 Baltimore Street in Hanover, its contents and the grounds to the Hanover Area Historical Society along with an endowment for the conservation of the properties. Mr. Warehime grew up across the street from the Myers Mansion and had long admired the neo-classical structure. The mansion remained in the Myers family until 1997 when Mr. Warehime purchased it from Molly Powl Myers, a granddaughter, who lived in Montana.\n\nLearn more about the mansion and how to visit here.\n\nHanover's Healing Touch\n\nCivil War Trails\n\nPleasant Hill Hotel became a makeshift hospital during the period following the Battle of Hanover and the Battle of Gettysburg. That building stood beside the current mansion location on Baltimore St.\n\nHanover Area History Museum\n\nPlaces of Interest\n\nThe new museum is home to hundreds of unique items, covering some 300 years of local history, and is the culmination of thousands of hours of research and development by a small, but dedicated team of volunteers. From the tale of Digges’ Choice in the 1720s to an entire display dedicated to the beloved summertime Forest Park, the museum takes guests on a journey that is structured both by time period and topic. Major themes covered include local religion, language, education, transportation and manufacturing.\n\nFind more information along with how to visit here.\n\nStuart's Fruitless Odyssey\n\nHeart of Hanover\n\nAfter disengaging from the Union cavalry in the late afternoon of June 30, Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry division left Hanover. Stuart and his men embarked upon a half.-circle odyssey south then northeast around town while Stuart's rear guard, did not depart Hanover until after dark. The next day, July 1, Stuart and a portion of his exhausted troops advanced to Carlisle searching for supplies and information. Some historians contend that Lee suffered an \"information blackout\" during the first two days of the Battle of Gettysburg, thereby depriving Confederates of strategic high points and information during the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nConfederates Invade Free Soil\n\nCivil War Trails\n\nBy June 29, Stuart had reached Union Mills, dangerously out of touch with Lee. Stuart had captured 125 Union wagons carrying provisions, along with 600 mules saddled with supplies, all of which bogged down his progress and kept him far away from Lee.\n\nUnion Strikes Back\n\nHeart of Hanover\n\nAs the Union reclaimed the square for good, Kilpatrick ordered troops, with the help of citizens, to barricade streets with barrels, farm wagons, dry goods boxes, and other materials to provide cover.\n\nThis pen drawing depicts what a barricade would have looked like as it is a depiction of a similar event in Baltimore, MD.\n\nFate of the Nation\n\nCivil War Trails\n\nIn 1887, Union Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, writing of the Gettysburg Campaign, asserted that “Hanover saved the fate of the nation.” It is of the Battle of Hanover that he spoke.\n\nCommons on Locomotives\n\nHeart of Hanover\n\nHanover’s first industrial park was built around the railroad lines in the late 19th century. The area known as the ‘Hanover Commons’ helped shape the town’s future as a community of entrepreneurs and family businesses.\n\nWorking on the Railroad\n\nHeart of Hanover\n\nThere is no doubt that Hanover’s access to rail lines helped position it as a hub of industry and innovation. The businesses in Hanover thrived with access to major metropolitan areas.\n\nLincoln in Hanover\n\nCivil War Trails\n\nPresident Lincoln’s stop at the Hanover Branch Railroad station was a cause for great celebration in the town. Many went gather for a glimpse at the President as he traveled to Gettysburg, where he delivered his address the next day.\n\nFor more information about the Gettysburg Address or Lincoln’s stop in Hanover visit: Battlefields.org\n\nGuthrie Memorial Public Library\n\nPlaces of Interest\n\nThe Guthrie Memorial Library, Hanover’s Public Library, is a welcoming environment representing education, recreation, and progress. The library forms a cultural connection that joins people through text, technology and meeting spaces. Visit YorkLibraries.org."
