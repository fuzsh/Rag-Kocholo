        "text": "I had a discussion over on another forum about the new Kramers Gibson offers. They keep em cheap and they (along with Fender) tried to buy up all of the other brands in order to keep them under control and keep a lot of them off the shelves so that they can saturate the GC's and other chains with their own products (the Gibsons and Fenders). Yes Fender released some Charvels through Sam Ash mainly...but they really keep all their sister brands in check..as does Gibson with kramer (not that Kramer really had much of a shot coming back) but they tried to even keep them below Epi nowadays to make sure the Epi's sell so that they may be a stepping stone to the Gibson USA line and so on. PRS is really screwing them with this..they are the only other main manufacturer that is in that price bracket of their USA lines (which is why they went after the singlecut instead of ESP's Eclipse guitars)\n\nAh, Kramer. I had one of their lumy neck late 70's 650B basses long ago. It's hard to believe that in 85 and 86, Kramer kicked Fender and Gibson's collective backsides, with their pointy headstock, whammy bar equipped, shred machines. Fender was barely surviving, and Gibson was trying to figure out it's own line of products with mixed success during the 80's. For a brief while, Kramer was the biggest guitar company out there. Then Kramer died by 1990, to be a merely a brand name with some intellectual property left for the pickings. Now the big two own practically every major brand of note. It's funny how fast things can change in the musical instrument industry.\n\nSo Gibson has bought out Kramer and Fender has bought out Charvel. It sounds like we are headed toward a monopoly here. You know, a monopoly, like when airlines merge so there are only a few of them, and they begin charging extra for luggage. Wonder when the guitar makers will start charging extra for strings? Oh well, given the strings that come on all brands now, who cares! And maybe they will offer another extra cost item -- talent! Now I'll take some of that.\n\nSo Gibson has bought out Kramer and Fender has bought out Charvel. It sounds like we are headed toward a monopoly here.

Oh well, given the strings that come on all brands now, who cares! And maybe they will offer another extra cost item -- talent! Now I'll take some of that.\n\nThat would be an oligopoly, not a monopoly.\n\nThe dislike of Epis rests only in the mind of the Original Poster. You don't like EPIs? OK by me - play whatever brand you like.\n\nI've been fortunate enough over the years to own 4 Gibson LPs,\n\n4 Epi LPs, a few Deans, an Agile LP, a Jay Turser Double cut-away LP,\n\nand a Raven West LP. So for ME, I go to what brand has the features I personally prefer.\n\nBottom line, if we get together to jam, I WILL be able to hold up MY end, regardless of what brand I'm playing. I just prefer LP-Style gits.\n\nStill have 2 EPI LPs, the Jay Turser LP, and the Raven West LP.\n\nI still have them because each is a Solid, \"Does what I want\" Guitar.\n\nNo brand-snobbery here.\n\nI snagged the Jay Turser JT-200 Pro off \"fleabay\" for $110 USD.\n\nTurned out to be one of the most ASTONISHING finds for the $$$ I've had in a few years. I grabbed it as a project git, expected nothing special.\n\nAfter playing it, I've changed NOTHING!\n\n(Tuners will be replaced, that's the \"weakest link\").\n\nIt weighs 11lbs, is built like a Brick Outhouse (SET Neck), and even the factory Pups actually sound quite decent. Who wudda known?\n\nPrices on ebay are now running $249 USD average. YES, I would\n\nbuy another one.\n\n(And of course, AGILE is putting out some surprisingly good stuff, too!).\n\nBad-mouthing other brands is silly - just be able to PRODUCE on whatever brand is YOUR favorite...\n\nEDIT: (Duh, might help to show pics of JT-200 Pro)\n\nThe thing is that, for example, Jacksons was cool back then and they're still cool today <snip>\n\nthis is a photo of my younger brother's Jackson, i do not know what model it is,\n\nhe has had it i think since the '80s...\n\nalthough, he has some other sweet guitars, this one just blazes \n\nfast neck, great tone, Rose whammy, a real winner -\n\nno wonder despite his other guitars, he will not let go of this one...\n\nsupposedly, Jackson is going to, or has done, a reissue of this model \n\ni guess people like 'em :~)\n\n<snip> It's hard to believe that in 85 and 86, Kramer kicked Fender and Gibson's collective backsides, with their pointy headstock, whammy bar equipped, shred machines <snip>\n\ni had an '85... added two SD Hot Rails and a 5-way selector switch\n\ndid a lot of recording with it - great sound\n\nfirst neck was warped... the replacement neck was also warped = big time tuning problems, obviously\n\nif it were not for the above, i probably would still own it because of the tone - despite the worst playing guitar\n\non the other hand, i could kick myself for letting go of my three Travis Beans'\n\nonce you got used to the neck - it was off to the races, Oh Well\n\nIt all boils down to \"play before you pay\", and select a guitar that is right for you. We all have different hand and finger sizes, different string attacks, and different styles of music. I have sold guitars I \"couldn't get anything out of\" only to have the buyer try it out and do some great stuff. And, I have been in situations where the exact reverse was true. Can't find an Epi model that does it for you? Fine and accepted. Try some other brands, and find a guitar that is suited to you. Then go play the Hell out of it, because that is what it is all about.\n\ni never knew Hamer was part of fender......well then again i never thought to look it up\n\nHamer was (I think still is) owned by Kaman Music Corp. which was purchased by Fender about two years ago which ultimately makes them a Fender-owned company. While we're on the subject, in my opinion Hamer is the most under-rated american guitar builder on the market. For an LP-style guitar, you'd do well to take a look at some of their mahogany body/maple top, set neck axes. Miles better than most of what Gibson currently churns out. Beautiful stuff that plays killer, with set-up & finish to die for. NICE..."
