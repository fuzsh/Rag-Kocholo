        "text": "I'm currently in beijing for a few months. I came here last year with the same agenda, specifically to get an AmSe fender strat (i don't live in the us, and china was my best shot at getting one at a reasonable price).\n\nThere's 1 authorized fender dealer, and i'm assuming is legit for other brands, in beijing, but boy is he overpriced.\n\nThen there are a bunch of small independent shops on a street near this place called gulou (one of them is owned by an ex gibson employee).\n\nThese are all mom and pop, or rather punk 'n' his biatch stores (literally )... on american guitars the best you'll get is the same as online prices, asian made guitars e.g. korean, japanese are quite cheap. But, since there are no 'big' stores that i know of, you'll have to spend a fair amount of time walking around trying to find what you need (and that too w/o knowing chinese, well i had to anyway)\n\nas an addendum, i went back to the same street a year after, and i'm surprised to find that many shops have closed, and the few that are open have a very limited selection of american brands.\n\nI'm sure there are other places in beijing to buy guitars and stuff, if you look around.\n\nSince i'm always game for a 'drool over guitar equipment' session, you can give me a buzz when you get here if you want.\n\nI've been to Taiwan several times and originaly had the same idea. I thought that because everything is made over there, prices would be cheaper, wrong. Taxes are very high, so are prices. I saw VCR's going for more money than they cost here in the states. I talked to a couple of musicians and they told me they came here to buy gear. The few music stores I did find weren't that impressive. And of course don't forget you will have to pay duty on your purchases when you come back over.\n\nWell, I'm back and didn't find anything worthwhile. I must say that the Taiwanese economy is much stronger than my last trip there 10 years ago. Went to a mall that had a store for every major European and American designer and the prices were about the same as here in the states. Very clean, extremely modern architecture.\n\nBeijing was kinda a mess with construction everywhere. Found the \"music alley\" near a music college but didn't really see anything worthwhile.\n\nI did buy an Erhu. It's a 2 stringed bow instrument kinda like a Chiese version of a Cello. Hard to master!\n\nAs far as the politics of globalization, we could definately compete in many industries if CEO's took a pay cut and American products focused on generating superior products rather than superior profits. And look at it this way. A DVD player in China may cost, say, $5 to make. Best Buy purchases a batch and marks them up to $40. $35 profit for the American company. And let's look at illegal downloads of movies, music, and software which without a question attacks the very core ideals of our economy. Why do we do it? The economy is not as simple as looking at the latest USA Today headlines. Just like Iraq, Iran, and Afganistan we've 'armed' China with profits and are shocked when those 'arms' are used against us.\n\nPeavey really spearheaded using CVC to revolutionize the guitar manufacturing market vastly increasing consistancy and efficiency (and in turn profitability). Where is the new American company with a radical new production method to make affordable, domestically made guitars?"
