        "text": "I've been keeping an eye open for a cheap used Epi SG, but sellers don't always list or know which model they have. Serial number tells me the ywar and factory but doesn't seem to tell model.\n\nHow do you know which is which?\n\nI know I want the binding on the neck, set neck, and trapezoid inlays... But hard to know beyond that what specs to be looking at.\n\nApart from recent (2019 and later) SGs, there's only a few with neck binding.\n\nThe 3 pickup Custom, the Prophecy, the Elitist '61, most Japanese and the Vintage G400 from 2003-2006.\n\nThis last one is basically a Gibson, except for the last 1\" of the top of the headstock.\n\n- No veneer body\n\n- One piece neck\n\n- Winged headstock construction\n\n- Long tenon\n\n- 2 colors: Cherry Red and Dark Natural\n\nYou can esily recognise it from it's gold mother of pearl headstock inlays. All others are white.\n\nWow, I thought binding was more common... Like on Epiphone LP's.\n\nThough, for what I have planned, adding binding won't be outta the question. Though if I recall, the Jay Turser SG's had binding on a few models as well plus bigger headstocks.\n\nIt's a weird project I have planned... Basically I want to rebuild my first guitar which was a Raven SG, and extremely hard to find one the same as what I had. One of those projects that's more work and effort than it's worth, but, I have fun doing it.\n\nHumbucker SGs:\n\n- Set neck 2 pickups 4 control knobs = G400\n\n- Bolt-on neck 2 pickups 4 control knobs = G310\n\n- Bolt-on neck 2 pickups 2 control knobs = Special\n\n- Bolt on neck 1 pickup 2 control knobs = Junior\n\nPerfect.... I get that there are special models and such as well, but this is what I was after. So, if set-neck, trap inlays and 4 knobs... it's automatically at least a G400 or better? Which is what I'm after.\n\nShame about the binding though.\n\nWell... Kinda went a different direction. Somewhat local guitar tech was selling an SG, looks like the neck came lose, someone glued it back 1/8\" too far out. Tech got it, stripped it, so I just got the neck and body.\n\nIt's a G-400, has binding, satin brown and the inlays are aged pearl not white pearl.\n\nPart of me says rebuild... Part of me wants to strip it, refinish in cherry nitro.\n\nIn Canada, Nitro was extremely hard to find, you could get clear but that was it... The last summer 2 companies popped up in Ontario, both selling vintage nitro colours. I have an old Hagstrom to refinish in cherry... SG may be a nice test run. Though I'd rather the darker wine, but they don't sell that.\n\nPlan is to do this with probably all Gotoh parts. Decent price and always liked the quality. Nickel bridge, tail, and vintage nickel / jade tuners. Irongear blues engine pickups, burns pots.\n\nI might reshape the headstock but keep the Epiphone logo... I have no shame in owning an Epiphone.\n\nI'd like to buy number/letter stamps off ebay... Anyone know how big the fonts are that Gibson uses?\n\nEDIT - From the colour, the binding, the yellowed/aged pearl and using the serial number for the age and factory, it looks like it's a 2004 '61 or '62 vintage reissue...\n\nnot sure how to narrow it down further."
