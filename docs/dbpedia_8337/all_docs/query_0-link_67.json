        "text": "Like @RodeoTex said, Squier was a string manufacturer that Fender bought out long ago, and then in the '80s when Fender was struggling with all the import copy guitars cutting into their market share, Fender went to those offshore guitar companies building illegal Fender copies and found one to sell Fender copies to FMIC with the Squier brand on the headstock.\n\nWhile Fender has never made a Squier, the first Squiers were made in Japan and some were made in Mexico.\n\nSeems Fender Mexico is more like actually Fender making guitars, as opposed to Fender paying the Jay Turser factory or the Tokai factory to make essentially Fender copies.\n\nThe early MIJ (Japan) Squiers were really good, and after a short time, Fender told the factory to put Fender decals on those Squiers, because buyers were getting used to the idea of offshore Fenders made by another company.\n\nI'm not sure about the Mexican Squiers, but there are rumors that some early Mexican Fenders were actually parts made in the US, then shipped to Mexico for assembly.\n\nCurrent Squier production is all over the map, but Fender does not make any of them.\n\nThat's not a bad thing, and I still love some of the old MIJ Fender copies including the very popular and now valuable '80s Tokai branded Tokai and Squier branded Tokai guitars.\n\nThe early Tokai made Fender copies were exact and included the trademarked Fender headstock.\n\nPart of the reason Fender contracted with these offshore copiers was that they couldn't sue them all and get them to stop making copies, so when they couldn't beat 'em, they decided to join 'em.\n\nThe '80s saw a lot of this, and Gibson as well as Floyd Rose all chose to license their products to the copy makers who were essentially stealing from the big US companies.\n\nSquier amounts to legalized thievery!\n\nSeems to be working great for FMIC now though, and the Squier brand might be considered more popular than the Fender brand.\n\nAll this talk of CNC leveling the playing field makes sense, but IMO once the milled hunk of wood comes off the CNC, the real work begins.\n\nI wish the current Squier line was as good as the old MIJ Squiers.\n\nMany feel they are, but none that I've tried and even bought have been satisfactory to me, and they have a great rep so the better Squiers never really get very cheap.\n\nTen years ago I could buy US parts Fenders for the price a CV Squier brings today.\n\nIf you want to build a parts guitar, I'd buy two whole Squiers and swap the parts around.\n\nCV Squier necks sell very high on the used market because they are possibly the most popular guitar in the modding hobby right now.\n\nLook into the manufacturers of each Squier line and you'll find that some are made where for example the Jay Turser line is also produced. The Jay Turser brings much less on the used market just because of the brand logo.\n\nIf you want to be really hip, buy Jay Turser or Cort parts and build a Squier that way!\n\n.\n\nFigure out if you like chunky or thin carved necks. That's the first big design issue that is more difficult to 'mod'. Go find a couple of those vs MIM/MIA to feel, make a 'C-chord' down by the nut (my hand cramps on the Squire necks doing that). Easy method to tell is if the carve starts behind the fretboard glue line or right near the front face of the fretboard so the side of the neck has a flat or an acute angle.\n\nThe Indonesian built Squiers are, manufacturing repeatability-wise, much better built than prior factories. More variability in the China guitars but the necks on some are chunkier. Fender specifies the neck shape profile -- so it's a design issue.\n\nFrom there I'd say just buy the same control parts as go in the MIM/MIA Fenders (CTS/CRL/Switchcraft) which if you do careful shopping should only be around $25 total and leave the stock pickups. 'Tune up' your guitar (rather than overshoot and try to hit it on the way down) and your guitar will have stable tuning (so you can use any tuners stock or custom).\n\nAlso look into Spectrum, Washburn, Yamaha, First Act, and so on.\n\nAny of them can be good players with a fret level, nut work, and deep setup.\n\n."
