        "text": "MCA, Inc., the billion‐dollar entertainment corporation, went into the music publishing business yesterday by purchasing the assets and worldwide copyrights of Leeds Music Corporation, the Duchess Music Corporation and the subsidiaries of both companies.\n\nJules C. Stein, chairman of the Board of MCA, Inc., announced the acquisition, but did not disclose the purchase price. Leeds Music Corporation is one of the country's leading publishing houses.\n\nThe music publishing arm of MCA will function under the guidance of Lou Levey, founder and owner of Leeds Music Corporation, and Sal Chianti, executive vice president of Leeds. Both have been made officers of MCA.\n\n“Under the guidance of such top‐flight veteran executives in the music field,” an announcement said, “MCA will be in a position to compete on an equal basis with such other motionpicture company music publishing subsidiaries as MPHC (Warner Brothers), Famous Music Corp. (Paramount), Robbins, Feist and Miller (M‐G‐M and 20th Century‐Fox), Screen Gems Columbia Music Company (Columbia) and Unart Music Company (United Artists).\n\nAmong the copyrights acquired by MCA are “Manhattan\n\nTowers,” “I Wanna Hold Your Hand,” “Heartaches,” “I'll Never Smile Again,” “C'est Si Si Bon,” “Come on a My House,” “Gypsy,” “Baby Won't You Please Come Home,” “I'll Remember April,” “Hawaiian Wedding Song,” “I Found a New Baby,” “Now is the Hour” and “Under Paris Skies.”\n\nMCA is the owner of major I movie, television and record companies. Last year, it moved into the Broadway theater on a long‐range basis. It owns Universal Pictures, Revue Productions, Decca Records, and Universal City, which is the largest studio in the world. It also is the owner of a bank with about $90 million in assets.\n\nReached by telephone, Lew Wasserman, president of the company, said MCA had made the purchase because “We think it's a natural expansion; all our competitors are in the field.”\n\nHe estimated that the two publishing concerns and their subsidiaries would bring in copyrights on a couple of hundred songs. He noted that MCA had been out of the talent‐representation field for more than a year and had been looking for something new to add."
