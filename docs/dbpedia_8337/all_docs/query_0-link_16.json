        "text": "Dear All,\n\nWarwick Selects US Music Corp to Distribute Warwick Basses and Amps in the U.S.A\n\nWarwick GmbH & Co announced today that they have selected US Music Corp to represent and distribute their world famous Warwick brand of bass guitars and amplifiers in the U.S as of January 1, 2011.\n\nHans Peter Wilfer, General Manager and founder of Warwick commented on their new business relationship by saying “We are very pleased to have been able to partner with US Music Corp. They are a professional organization that understands our customer base and can meet the needs of both our dealers and consumers. With the introduction of exciting new products slated for 2011, we should see continued sales growth of our product offerings”.\n\nIn commenting on the addition of Warwick to their existing line-up of products, Barry Ryan, President of US Music Corp said, “We are very excited to have the opportunity to add Warwick to our family of brands. Warwick has been producing high quality electric basses & Amps for more than 25 years. Their full line of electric basses and new line of bass amplifiers complements our current product lines and fills a void in our overall product offerings”.\n\nVisit Warwick / US Music Corp. at NAMM.

Courtland St.\n\nMundelein, IL 60060\n\n[email protected]\n\nPhone : 800-877-6863\n\nFor Custom SHop:\n\nMr. Nick Ellingsworth\n\nPhone : 800-877-6863 X 5123\n\nMail : [email protected]\n\nIn the unlikely event that you have a warranty or service issue,\n\nyou can also contact US Music’s service manager:\n\nMr. Dave Miller\n\nPhone : 800-877-6863 x 5110\n\nMail : [email protected]\n\nI have an issue with my neck and I cannot get a hold of U.S. Music Corp. My bass is still under warranty and I'm wondering what to do now???\n\nYou can go to your dealer, where you bought the bass, it should be the first step. All the other answers about contacting Warwick in the US are in the other thread you posted in (and multiple threads on the forum as well as on our website )\n\nSTRINGS AND THINGS GUITAR WHOLESALE items - Get great deals on GUITARS, CASES items on eBay Stores! This is the link to where I purchased my bass from. He is a one man store. Not sure what to do then cause U.S. Music Corp doesn't know how to answer a phone. I'm just really frustrated cause I have had this bass for only 4 months and I'm already having problems.\n\nMark, you have to talk to your dealer, as Alexandre and Florin said in previous posts.\n\nI called and talked to the New York Custom Shop and they are going to do some leg work for me since no one seems to know what good customer service is these days. The first step to good customer service is answering the damn phone when some one calls or returning their call when they leave you a bunch of messages!\n\nI wouldnt hold it against the distributor, they deal with dealers, not retail customers. I went through the same thing with Hanser. The NYC Custom Shop is a godsend lately, they have been helping out on a lot of issues that frankly they shouldnt have to. Hopefully you get your issues worked out, and next time you know to buy from a reputable dealer."
