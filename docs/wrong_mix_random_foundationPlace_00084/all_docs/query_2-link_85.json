        "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Watch your back, Jason (and bad actors).\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn a Violent Nature follows a group of teenagers who have come out to a cabin in the woods for a weekend of partying. While exploring the surrounding wilderness, they steal a locket from a fire tower, inadvertently awakening the deceased Johnny (Ry Barrett), a violent spree killer with a legendary past. Determined to get back what’s his, Johnny makes his way through the woods and towards the partying teenagers, gruesomely murdering anybody who gets in his path.\n\nMy thoughts\n\nThe slasher genre is a tried and true one, spanning decades with dozens of franchises starring some of film history’s most iconic villains. While I and others hold a lot of reverence for the genre, it’s really been done to death, with seemingly every cliché explored, exploited, and parodied.\n\nAt this point, slashers aren’t really known for their originality, but that doesn’t mean seeds of creativity can’t pop up from time to time. In a Violent Nature basically asks one simple question that hasn’t been asked before: what exactly is a slasher villain (like Jason Voorhees, for example) doing whenever his future hapless victims are living it up without a care in the world? Why, he’s just walking around the woods until he stumbles upon his next victim, of course!\n\nA gruesome hike through nature\n\nYeah… there’s lots of walking in this movie, particularly shots from behind Johnny as he trudges through the forest. Just walking and walking, with the occasional cut to another shot of still walking to show a brief passage of time, all done in complete silence, with no typical sinister musical score to back him up.\n\nIf you’re thinking this seems like a super low-budget, arthouse independent film that stretches its premise a bit too thin, then you’d be right! In a Violent Nature was all put together on a $3 million budget and shot in the Canadian wilderness. It’s about as minimalist and lo-fi as a slasher flick can get.\n\nEven if the movie is pretty much nothing but walking and stalking with the occasional gruesome kill to break it up, if you’re a fan of slashers and can dial into the vibe, there’s a lot to appreciate here with how In a Violent Nature deconstructs the genre is a very simple and effective way.\n\nThe gimmick of having a slasher entirely from the killer’s point of view actually pays off pretty well, as it was fun to imagine the “other movie” that was going on around Johnny. As he creeps up on his characters, they’re having conversations about stuff we’re not privy to, but we would have been if we were watching a more conventional movie.\n\nThere’s a scene near the end where Johnny comes across two of the final surviving characters talking about their big plan to burn down the old firehouse and defeat the curse for good (or something to that effect). It’s all pretty vague, but it’s an enjoyable perspective switch not having information the audience is normally aware of.\n\nAnother great bit was Johnny trying to draw one of his victims out of the cabin so he could kill them. I couldn’t help but crack up with laughter when Johnny sets a trap, then comically fast walks around the cabin so he can sneak up on his victim coming out. For slasher fans, it’s a hilarious little insight that we don’t often think about until it’s actually presented to us.\n\nOriginal sin\n\nThe slasher genre often goes to great lengths to explain the killer’s backstory and what turned them into homicidal maniacs, but every now and then, the filmmakers leave the mystery up to the viewers. I don’t really mind either, as long as the origin is decent enough, but I do think leaving things more vague and mysterious is more unsettling.\n\nWriter-director Chris Nash decides to have his cake and eat it too, which actually works surprisingly well in both the film and Johnny’s favor. Johnny gets your typical ghost story urban legend told around the campfire by some teenagers, where he’s a mentally challenged boy with a tragic past of being accidentally killed by some careless adults.\n\nAnother character monologues (for way too long) about how nature is brutal and we can’t even begin to understand the violent things that it does, comparing Johnny more to an animal that just does what it does without reason, only instinct. It was a nice balancing act that both explains and doesn’t explain Johnny’s true nature.\n\nThere are a few brief moments where we get an insight into Johnny’s mind, which gives him a tiny bit of characterization, but I could have done without these moments, as, again, a slasher villain is far scarier when we don’t know their true motives. I suppose it at least all felt in line with Johnny basically being a Jason figure, mommy issues and all.\n\nDragged down by the acting stone\n\nIf there’s one thing that greatly drags down In a Violent Nature, and may even completely break the movie for some viewers, it’s that the acting is legitimately awful. Like student film quality. It’s been a very long time since I’ve seen a movie that had such awkward and stilted line deliveries and a complete lack of emotion from nearly everyone involved.\n\nI don’t know if it was a complete lack of direction from Nash or what, but I think your characters should at least change their facial experience and not just look indifferent when they’re literally being disemboweled. A little emotion can really go a long way, even if it’s just a slight wince or groan.\n\nIn a way, I was able to compartmentalize this terrible acting by trying to justify it with, “Well, those old slasher movies also have bad acting. This is just an homage to that.” That would just be making excuses, though, as the acting in those old films isn’t anywhere near as terrible as it is here. Aside from Lauren-Marie Taylor’s (of Friday the 13th Part 2 fame) monologue, the line readings here are just inexcusable.\n\nAt least Ry Barrett was great as Johnny. I know it may not seem like high praise since his character never speaks or emotes, but much of a slasher villain’s effectiveness comes from how well the actor portrays them as an imposing figure, and Barrett is incredibly imposing. He does the most he can to give Johnny a little bit of personality to set him apart from other horror villains out there.\n\nWhat we’re really here for\n\nWhile the hook (no pun intended) for In a Violent Nature may be a slasher from the slasher’s perspective, the selling point is no doubt the gory kills that are achieved with glorious practical effects. While they’re not all the most creative kills you’ll ever see, they’re effectively staged and executed where you feel the impact of each one.\n\nLike every iconic slasher villain, Johnny gets his own unique getup and weapon in the form of an old-fashioned firefighter helmet and dragging hooks they would use back in the day. While he kills some characters with classic weapons like hatchets and big rocks, he gets to have plenty of fun with these new implements.\n\nThere is one sequence in particular (see above picture) that’s so disgustingly brutal in its ingenuity, it’s almost as if Nash first came up with this kill and then decided to cobble a movie around it just to give us some of the most awesome practical effects in recent memory. It’s a gloriously gnarly sequence that lives up to the hype.\n\nWhat sets the film even further apart from other slashers is that, aside from the one I was just talking about, the kills are done without any sort of flair to make them exciting. Nash just frames the shot, lets the camera linger, and shows you every little bit of detail of how Johnny maims his victims. There’s no schlocky fun in it because, to Johnny, it’s not fun. Just business.\n\nAlso, can cinematographer Pierce Derks please get an award, a pat on the back, an “Attaboy,” or something for the sheer fact that I could see what was actually happening during the nighttime scenes?! My word, so many movies and shows recently have been so frustratingly dark it’s refreshing when you can actually see the movie (movies are a visual medium if you cinematographers weren’t aware).\n\nSeriously, every working cinematographer needs to watch the night scenes in this movie and take notes. If Derks can make darkly lit scenes in the middle of nowhere visually coherent on such a minuscule budget, then any cinematographer worth their salt should be able to do the same.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nWhen the end credits for In a Violent Nature began to roll, the first thing I said to my friends was, “That was an excellent special effects demo reel.” I mean, that’s really all it is. It has even less depth than slashers normally do, but that’s by design. It’s supposed to be stripped down to its very primal, bare-bones roots. Come for the kills and atmosphere, but not much else.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that I would only suggest to a very specific subset of people and even then, it’s a coin toss whether they’ll actually like it or not. It’s a glacially paced, low-budget arthouse film with horrendous acting, but if you’re a fan of slasher flicks and want to a see a new take on a genre that’s been hacked to death, there’s quite a bit to admire here.\n\nMy rating: 6/10\n\nIn a Violent Nature is currently available to rent and purchase on digital platforms.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
