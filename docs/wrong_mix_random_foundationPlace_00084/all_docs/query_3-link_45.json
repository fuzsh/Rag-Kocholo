More information at https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/easy-to-read/\n\nThe European Union\n\nThe European Union is a group of 27 countries in Europe.\n\nThese countries came together\n\nto make things better, easier and safer for people.\n\nThey agreed to work together and help each other.\n\nIn the beginning, only 6 countries in Europe started working together:\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nItaly\n\nLuxembourg\n\nNetherlands\n\nSoon, more and more countries in Europe joined them\n\nand the European Union was made.\n\nIn June 2016 the United Kingdom decided\n\nto stop being part of the European Union.\n\nSo from 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom\n\nis no longer part of the European Union.\n\nThe goals and values of the European Union\n\nAll countries that are part of the European Union work together\n\nto make sure that:\n\nthere is peace in Europe\n\npeople have good lives\n\nthings are fair for all people and nobody is left out\n\nthe languages and cultures of all people\n\nare respected\n\nthere is a strong European economy\n\nand countries use the same coin\n\nto do business together.\n\nThe countries of the European Union\n\nshare some important values.\n\nFor example, they work to make sure that all people are equal\n\nand their rights are respected.\n\nPeace in Europe\n\nFree move\n\nThe European Union made it easier for people\n\nto move freely from one country to another.\n\nThey can live, study or work\n\nin any country of the European Union they want.\n\nFor example, a person from France can choose\n\nto move to Italy and work there.\n\nOr a student from Belgium can go study in a university in Greece.\n\nThings, services and money can also move freely\n\nfrom one country of the European Union to another.\n\nThe European Union in the world\n\nThe European Union plays an important role in the world in many ways.\n\nFor example:\n\nIt sells many things and services to other countries.\n\nAlso, it buys things from other countries.\n\nThis way it helps the world economy keep going.\n\nIt helps millions of people\n\nwho live in poorer countries outside the European Union.\n\nIt tries to make the world a safer place\n\nwhere people are treated fairly and laws are respected.\n\nBecoming part of the European Union\n\nTo become part of the European Union,\n\na country must:\n\nSome countries are now working to become part of the European Union.\n\nThese countries are:\n\nAlbania\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nGeorgia\n\nMoldova\n\nMontenegro\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nSerbia\n\nTürkiye\n\nUkraine\n\nTo become part of the European Union,\n\nthese countries must work\n\nto make all laws and values of the European Union\n\nhappen in them.\n\nThe Schengen Area\n\nThe European Union made the ‘Schengen Area’.\n\nThe Schengen Area is an area without borders.\n\nIn this area, people can travel from country to country freely and easily.\n\nThey do not have to go through checks and controls\n\nwhen they pass from one country to another.\n\nThanks to the Schengen Area, it is now easier for people\n\nto travel for work or tourism.\n\nThe Schengen Area was made in 1985.\n\nToday 25 out of the 27 countries of the European Union\n\nare part of the Schengen Area.\n\nThese countries are:\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nAlso, 4 countries outside the European Union\n\nare part of the Schengen Area:\n\nIceland\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nNorway\n\nSwitzerland\n\nThat means that people can travel freely and easily\n\nfrom one of these countries to another.\n\nThis way it is easier for people to visit any of these countries\n\nfor tourism or for work.\n\nLanguages of the European Union\n\nIn every country of the European Union\n\npeople speak their own language.\n\nThe European Union protects the right of people\n\nto communicate in their own language.\n\nThat is why the European Union\n\nmakes all important information and documents\n\nin all the languages that people speak in its countries:\n\nBulgarian\n\nCroatian\n\nCzech\n\nDanish\n\nDutch\n\nEnglish\n\nEstonian\n\nFinnish\n\nFrench\n\nGerman\n\nGreek\n\nHungarian\n\nIrish\n\nItalian\n\nLatvian\n\nLithuanian\n\nMaltese\n\nPolish\n\nPortuguese\n\nRomanian\n\nSlovak\n\nSlovenian\n\nSpanish\n\nSwedish\n\nThis way all people in the European Union\n\ncan get important information in their own language\n\nand understand it.\n\nThe coin of the European Union\n\nMost countries that are part of the European Union use the same coin.\n\nToday, 20 out of 27 European Union countries use the euro.\n\nThese countries are:\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nPortugal\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nThe European flag\n\nThis is the flag of the European Union:\n\nThe flag of the European Union is blue\n\nand has a circle of gold stars on it.\n\nIt is a symbol that shows that the countries of the European Union\n\nare united and stand by each other.\n\nThe European anthem\n\nEvery country has a melody\n\nthat better shows its values and culture as a country.\n\nThis melody is called ‘anthem’.\n\nThe European Union has its own anthem too.\n\nIn 1985, people who make decisions\n\nin the European Union\n\nchose a melody of a very important composer\n\nto be the anthem of the European Union.\n\nThis composer is called Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\nThe melody shows how important it is\n\nthat all people are free, live in peace\n\nand stand by each other.\n\nThe European Union believes in these values\n\nand that is why it has chosen this melody\n\nto be its anthem.\n\nIf you want to listen to the anthem of the European Union, click here.\n\nUnited in diversity\n\nThe European Union uses the phrase ‘united in diversity’\n\nto show what its values are.\n\nBeing united in diversity means that:\n\npeople in the European Union\n\nmay have different cultures or languages\n\nbut they stand by each other\n\nand work together in peace.\n\nthere is nothing wrong\n\nabout having different languages or cultures.\n\nOn the contrary.\n\nPeople with different cultures\n\ncan learn more things from each other and work well together.\n\nHow the European Union works\n\nThe European Union has 3 main bodies:\n\nthe European Commission\n\nThe people of the European Commission\n\nsuggest laws for the European Union.\n\nthe European Parliament\n\nThe people of the European Parliament\n\nare elected by all people in Europe\n\nto stand for their rights.\n\nthe Council of the European Union\n\nPeople who make decisions\n\nin every country of the European Union\n\ncome together and make\n\nthe Council of the European Union.\n\nThese 3 bodies are very important for the European Union.\n\nThey work closely together to make things better in Europe:\n\nThe European Commission suggests laws.\n\nThe European Parliament\n\nand the Council of the European Union\n\ndiscuss these laws and decide if they want these laws\n\nto happen in Europe.\n\nIf they decide that a law must happen in Europe,\n\nall countries of the European Union\n\nmust work to make this law happen in them.\n\nOther bodies that are important for the European Union are:\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union\n\nthat makes sure that all laws happen correctly\n\nin the European Union.\n\nthe Court of Auditors\n\nthat checks if the money of the European Union\n\nis spent in the right way.\n\nThere are also other bodies of the European Union\n\nthat are doing important work.\n\nFor example, there are bodies that:\n\ncheck if the European Union works in the right\n\nway and respects the rights of all people.\n\npublish useful information\n\nabout the European Union.\n\nchoose the people who have the skills\n\nto work for the European Union.\n\nstand for the rights of all people in Europe\n\nlike people with disabilities, workers and others.\n\nAll these bodies work together to make sure that the European Union works\n\nin the right way for the good of its people.\n\nMore information\n\nClick here to find more information\n\nabout the European
