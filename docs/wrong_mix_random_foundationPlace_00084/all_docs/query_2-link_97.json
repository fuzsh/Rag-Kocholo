        "text": "Three Singaporean professors from NUS were honoured by prestigious scientific journal Nature for their commitment towards nurturing the next generation of scientists. Professor Lim Chwee Teck received the lifetime achievement award, while Professor Koh Woon Puay and Professor Tai E Shyong were joint-recipients of the mid-career award.\n\nThe Nature Awards for Mentoring in Science is rotated annually amongst different countries. The 2022 edition marks the first time that the Awards was hosted by Singapore – or a Southeast Asian nation – since it was first introduced in 2005.\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Nature and chair of the judging panel, Dr Magdalena Skipper, said, “The Nature Award for Mentoring in Science recognises those mentors who dedicate their time to supporting and enhancing the careers of young researchers. This is an opportunity for mentors to play an integral part in the professional development of their mentees – adding support and experience to knowledge. I am delighted that through this award we can recognise the importance of those that are empowering researchers in the early stages of their careers and the value this adds in both the short and long term to the whole research community.”\n\nLeaving a positive legacy\n\nLifetime Achievement Award: Professor Lim Chwee Teck\n\nProf Lim's indefatigable support for his students and peers was evident in the profusion of comments he received on LinkedIn when he shared the good news of his award on 11 May 2023.\n\nProfessor Terence Ow, a former classmate and now a Professor in Information Systems at Marquette University in Wisconsin, US, described Prof Lim as \"the same person I met when we were students at NJC. Humble and intelligent human being. Full of good ideas.\" He wrote that without Prof Lim's coaching and guidance, he would not have \"passed his exam in Computer Science and make it to university\".\n\nProf Lim’s commitment to the growth and development of those around him is a recurring theme in his decades-long journey as a researcher and educator. To date, he has mentored more than 30 Masters and 50 PhD students, as well as 20 postdoctoral fellows. “Serving as a mentor to others is itself a gratifying experience that provides opportunities to make a difference and positive impact on someone’s life,” Prof Lim reminisced.\n\nWhen asked to highlight a few of his more prolific mentees, he felt that all his mentees have been prolific and successful in their own ways. For example, some have become academic members in universities around the world, some are corporate executives and a number are even entrepreneurs starting up their own companies.\n\nThe judging panel for the Nature Awards noted that apart from his holistic approach and embracing of diversity as well as his outstanding support during the peak of COVID infections and restrictions, Prof Lim's focus on entrepreneurial and tech-transfer mentorship also stood out as a key form of support for his mentees. A serial entrepreneur, Prof Lim has co-founded six startup companies which commercialised technologies developed in his lab. This prolific researcher and inventor from the Department of Biomedical Engineering under the NUS College of Design and Engineering as well as the Mechanobiology Institute at NUS has also received more than 120 awards and honours together with his team.\n\nAs the Director of the NUS Institute for Health Innovation & Technology (iHealthtech), which aims to develop healthcare solutions and technologies and bring them from bench to bedside, Prof Lim understands the need for translational research – iHealthtech has incubated and spun off five start-ups to date.\n\nDr Ramesh Ramji, who received a PhD in Bioengineering and Biomedical Engineering from NUS in 2012, and is currently a co-founder of a biotech start-up based in California, said that Prof Lim had always “been an inspiration for translational science”.\n\nAnd the importance of finding the right mentors cannot be overstated. Prof Lim encourages early career researchers to seek out those \"who will not only provide guidance or impart knowledge, but also is an inspiring role model, pillar of support and advocate for the mentee so that they can achieve their full potential.\"\n\nProf Lim also acknowledged the University’s role in fostering the right environment for both students and educators. “My sincere gratitude to NUS for all the support given so that I can better mentor our next generation of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs.”\n\nFor those looking to mentor others, Prof Lim observed that “we can do this not only by offering guidance, support and encouragement, but also building relationships based on trust, respect and mutual learning that can last a lifetime. In fact, many of my mentees and their family members have become my lifelong friends.\"\n\n\"In the end, it’s about leaving a positive legacy.\""
