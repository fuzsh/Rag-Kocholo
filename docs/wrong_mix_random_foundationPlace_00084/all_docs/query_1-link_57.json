Several collaborators (an artist and two other physicians trained in pediatrics as well as allergy/immunology) and I joined forces this spring with the goal of developing a simple story to explain to young children why the world as we know it has changed so drastically and encouraging them to focus on the things we can still do and the fact that we’re all in this together. Last week we published it and we’ve been humbled and gratified by the responses so far!\n\nLinks to the book in softcover and hardcover are below.
