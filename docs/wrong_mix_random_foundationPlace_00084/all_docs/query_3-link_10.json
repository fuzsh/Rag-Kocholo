        "text": "State Pension (Contributory) is a social insurance based payment made to people from age 66. A person can choose to drawdown their State Pension (Contributory) at any point between age 66 and age 70. This is not a means-tested payment. A person can receive payment of State Pension (Contributory) and continue to work or have other income such as an occupational pension.\n\nMaximum rate of pension is payable where a person has a \"yearly average\" of at least 48. The yearly average is the average number of full-rate contributions paid and/or credited per year over the period from 1953*, or from the year of starting insurable employment, if later, to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age (66).\n\nMaximum rate pension is also payable where a person has an \"alternative yearly average\" of at least 48. The alternative yearly average is the average number of contributions paid and/or credited over the period from April 1979 to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age (66). The \"alternative yearly average\" applies only to persons who reached age 66 on or after 6 April 1992.\n\nTo receive the maximum rate of payment under the ACM, you must have 2,080 contributions and credits (equivalent to 40 years). If you have less than 2,080 contributions and credits your rate will be a percentage of the maximum rate of pension.\n\nThe Total Contribution Approach rate is calculated. To receive the maximum rate of payment under the TCA, you must have 2,080 contributions and credits (equivalent to 40 years). If you have less than 2,080 contributions and credits your rate will be a percentage of the maximum rate of pension.\n\nPension age is currently 66 years. From 01/01/2024 a person reaching age 66 can defer access to their pension to a date at any point between age 66 and age 70. They will not be backdated to their 66th birthday when they chose a date to access their pension. This is the date entitlement/payment starts.\n\nWhere National Health Insurance contributions have been counted for the first or second condition, the yearly average is counted from the start of the 1953 contribution year - 5 January 1953 in the case of a man, and 6 July 1953 in the case of a woman.\n\nFrom July 1992 in calculating the yearly average, a fraction of a whole number consisting of one half or more is rounded up to the nearest whole number e.g. 9.5 is rounded up to 10, 47.5 is rounded up to 48.\n\nYears spent working in the home from 6 April 1994 caring for a child up to age 12 or caring for an incapacitated person are disregarded in calculating the yearly average third condition. Up to a maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way.\n\nPrior to 1 April 1974, non-manual employees were not liable for social insurance contributions if their earnings were over a prescribed limit. This limit was abolished on 1 April 1974. Due to the operation of this prescribed earnings limit many people failed to qualify for State Pension (Contributory) because of gaps in their insurance record. This special partial pension was introduced in October 1988 to cater for people in this position.\n\nThis pension is based on a combination of full-rate Irish social insurance contributions and reckonable social insurance in EU countries or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement. The pension is a pro-rata payment based on the proportion of Irish social insurance contributions to the total number of contributions paid and/or credited, that is, Irish and other insurance combined.\n\nSee Second Qualifying Conditions above re changes in this condition for persons reaching pension age from 6 April 2002 and 6 April 2012 also apply, except that Irish social insurance contributions and social insurance contributions in the other country can be combined for this purpose.)\n\nA person should normally make a claim to pension in the country of residence. A person living in Ireland should therefore apply for pension to the Department of Social Protection. If the claimant indicates that he/she was insured* in an EU country or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Agreement, a claim to pension in that country is made by the Department on the claimant's behalf. The date of claim in Ireland is taken as the date of claim by the other country.\n\nThe notional pension is calculated. Notional pension is that which would be payable if all social insurance contributions, both full-rate Irish and non-Irish, were treated as Irish contributions. The full-rate Irish and non-Irish reckonable contributions are therefore added together and the total is then divided by the number of years to get the yearly average number of contributions.\n\nThe European Union and the United Kingdom agreed a Trade & Cooperation Agreement which contains a Protocol on Social Security to take effect from 1st January 2021. The Protocol provides for a wide range of social security issues into the future. On the 31st December 2020, the Convention on Social Security agreed between Ireland and the United Kingdom was commenced. Together these Agreements ensure, that all existing social security arrangements for Irish & UK citizens are maintained into the future. Ireland as an EU Member State, will extend on a unilateral basis the advantages of the Convention to Union citizens, as required.\n\nThis pro-rata pension, which was introduced in November 1991, is based on a combination of full and modified rate contributions (see above for an explanation of these categories). Prior to this, many persons who paid a mixture of full and modified rate social insurance contributions did not qualify for pension despite the factthat they paid full-rate contributions for part of their working lives. These persons may now qualify for a pension based on the number of full-rate contributions as a proportion of their total contributions i.e. full and modified rate.\n\nSee Second Qualifying Conditions above for changes in this condition for persons reaching pension age on or after 6 April 2002 except that there is no saver clause for voluntary contributors. Also, for persons reaching pension age on or after 6 April 2012, 520 contributions must be paid. However the 520 may be made up in either of following ways:\n\nThe notional pension is calculated. Notional pension is the pension that would be paid if all social insurance contributions, both full and modified rate, were treated as full-rate contributions. The full and modified rate contributions are therefore added together and the total is then divided by the number of years to get the yearly average.\n\nSocial insurance contributions for the self-employed were introduced on 6 April 1988. However many self-employed people had reached the age of 56 by this date and therefore could not qualify for State Pension (Contributory) as they would not satisfy the condition of entering social insurance before age 56.\n\nNote: For the purpose of establishing the 260 paid contributions, every 2 contributions paid prior to 1953 is counted as 3, and any odd contribution is counted as 2.However in calculating the rate of the pension payable this \"3 for 2\" rule only applies to the Irish pre 1953 National Health Insurance contributions and not foreign insurance.\n\nA person who does not qualify for the above pension may qualify for a pro-rata version of it i.e. a pension based on a combination of full-rate Irish social insurance contributions and reckonable social insurance in EU countries or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.\n\nThe qualifying conditions are as outlined above except that Irish social insurance contributions and social insurance contributions in the EU country/countries or a bilateral agreement country can be combined for the purpose of satisfying the condition of having 260 contributions paid. However, there must be at least 52 contributions paid and credited in Ireland.\n\nNote: For the purposes of establishing the 260 paid contributions, every 2 contributions paid prior to 1953 is counted as 3, and any odd contribution is counted as 2. However in calculating the rate, this \"3 for 2\" rule does not apply (i.e. when calculating \"B\" and \"C\" above, contributions are counted on a \"one for one\" basis).\n\nIf you fail to qualify for contributory pension based on your insurance record, or, if you only qualify for a reduced rate of payment on the basis of your insurance record, you may apply for State Pension (Non-Contributory) which is based on an assessment of your means (you must be resident in the State to claim this pension). If it is to your advantage you can get paid State Pension (Non-Contributory) instead.\n\nFrom 30 March 2018 to receive the maximum rate of payment under the ACM, you must have 2,080 contributions and credits (equivalent to 40 years). If you have less than 2,080 contributions and credits your rate will be a percentage of the maximum rate of pension.\n\nIf the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a claimant deprives themselves of income or property (including money) in order for the claimant to qualify for an Increase for qualified adult , or improve a weekly rate of payment, that income or property will be included in the means test if transfer of asset/s has taken place on or after 29 November 2011. (This may not apply in the case of a farm transfer)\n\nThis is payable in respect of a qualified child who is normally resident with the pensioner. A child is regarded as a dependant up to age 18, or if in full-time education by day at any university, college, school or other educational establishment, up to end of academic year of the year in which the qualified child reaches age 22.\n\nHalf rate is payable in certain circumstances i.e. where the child is normally resident with the pensioner and the spouse/civil partner/cohabitant but the pensioner does not qualify for an increase for the spouse/civil partner/cohabitant because the spouse is not regarded as a qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant.\n\nNote: If a person is getting a pension from this country and from an EU country or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Agreement, increase for a qualified child is payable by one country only. It is normally paid by the country in which the pensioner is resident.\n\nThis is payable if a pensioner is age 66 or over and ordinarily resident on one of a list of specified islands off the coast of Ireland. It is paid automatically. However, if the customer is not in receipt of State Pension (Contributory) from this Department but is in receipt of an equivalent Social Security pension from another EU/BA country, s/he must apply for this increase.\n\nWhere a pensioner dies, payment of pension may continue for six weeks after death in certain circumstances. Notification of date of death should be given to the Department at the earliest possible date. See part 3 below and Payment-related issues guideline for further detail.\n\nCarer's Allowance: may be payable to a person who provides full-time care and attention to a person who is medically certified as being incapacitated and requiring fulltime care and attention. From September 2007, it may be possible to obtain a half rate Carer's Allowance in addition to a State Pension (Contributory) or increase for a qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant. See Carer's Allowance guideline for more general information.\n\nApart from Disablement Pension under the Occupational Injury Benefit Scheme and Child Benefit (see Disablement Benefit and Child Benefit guidelines), State Pension (Contributory)is not payable concurrently with any other Social Welfare payment. However, from September 2007 it is possible to receive a half rate Carer's Allowance in addition to a State Pension (Contributory) or increase for a qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant.\n\nWhere a person is also entitled to another pension or benefit but the rate of payment is less than would be payable as a recipient of State Pension (Contributory), the person may opt to receive payment of State Pension (Contributory) at the higher rate. Where a person would be qualified to be paid as a dependant on another person's Contributory Pension but would have an entitlement to State Pension (Non-Contributory) at a higher rate of payment, s/he may opt for payment of pension at the higher rate.\n\nUnder Social Welfare legislation there is a legal onus on a person to apply to the Department for State Pension (Contributory) if s/he believes they may have such an entitlement. Claim form SPC1 should be completed in full i.e. all relevant questions answered, the form signed by the claimant and forwarded to the Department with relevant documentation as indicated below.\n\nWhere a claim to pension is made late i.e. after the age of 66, payment can be backdated up to 12 months from date of receipt of claim provided the relevant qualifying conditions are fulfilled. Further back-dating of payment may be made on a proportional basis e.g. a claim made three years late would attract a full 12 months 17/12/2014 25 arrears of payment plus a further 47 weeks payment. There are also legislative provisions for payment of arrears where it is shown that:\n\nA Deciding Officer may not be in a position to make a decision on a claim until all requested documentation has been received in the Department. It is an offence for a claimant to knowingly make a false or misleading statement or to provide documents or information which s/he knows to be false in some respect for the purpose of obtaining or establishing entitlement to pension, or pension at a higher rate. A person found guilty of such an offence could be liable to a fine of €1,269.74 (£1,000) or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. Any overpayment of pension would also be repayable to the Department.\n\nA written notification of the decision is issued to the claimant. Where claims are disallowed or allowed at a rate other than the maximum, the claimant is given an explanation of the basis for the decision and also given the right of appeal.\n\nA person who is dissatisfied with the Deciding Officer's decision e.g. refused award of pension or refused an increase for a spouse/civil partner/cohabitant, may appeal the decision. The appeal should be made by writing to the Chief Appeals Officer, Social Welfare Appeals Office, D'Olier House, Dublin 2, D02 XY31 within 21 days of notification of the Deciding Officer's decision, stating the grounds of appeal.\n\nWhen an appeal is made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, the grounds of appeal are put before the Deciding Officer so that the Deciding Officer may, if it is to the advantage of the claimant, revise the decision if s/he feels that this is necessary having regard to the facts or evidence put forward in the letter of appeal. The claimant will also have the right to appeal the revised decision of the Deciding Officer. (See separate guideline on Revised Decisions )\n\nA statement is prepared on the facts relied upon by the Deciding Officer in the making of a decision on entitlement to pension and on the extent to which the facts and contentions advanced by the appellant are admitted or disputed. This statement is put before the Chief Appeals Officer.\n\nPrior to 29 September 2006, if a person reaches the age of 66 on a day other than a Friday then pension is payable from the following Friday i.e. the first Friday following the date of reaching age 66. This also applies to increases in payment of pension. From 29 September 2006, State Pension (Contributory) is payable from the date a person reaches age 66.\n\nWhere a person receiving a pension dies or a person for whom they were receiving an increase for qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant dies, payment of pension continues for a period of six weeks after death to the qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant or pensioner in certain circumstances. Payments are also made where a qualified child dies.\n\nWhere State Pension (Contributory) was in payment up to the date of death of a pensioner and included an increase for a Qualified spouse/civil partner, Widow/er's /Surviving Civil Partner Contributory Pension is automatically awarded to the spouse/civil partner (this includes a husband or wife divorced from the pensioner, who has not re-married).\n\nPension is normally paid directly to the pensioner. However, payment of a proportion of State Pension (Contributory) may be made to the qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant where it is likely that the amount of pension will not be used for the subsistence of the family unit or where the pensioner or qualified adult is in a hospital or residential home. The payment of pension may be divided equally where the couple are residing together or increase for qualified spouse/civil partner/cohabitant and increase for a qualified child paid separately where the couple reside apart.\n\nPayment of pension will be made for periods outside the state, either on a temporary or permanent basis. The Department should be notified of any permanent absence from the State and any absence of more than a few weeks.\n\nA review is initiated when the Department becomes aware of any change in circumstances that may affect entitlement to the pension or any increase or allowance in payment. This review may be carried out by way of visit by a Social Welfare Inspector or by direct correspondence or phone contact with the pensioner.\n\nDepending on the circumstances of the case, the Deciding Officer may, having established the facts of the case, consider it necessary to write to the pensioner outlining the reasons why it is deemed that s/he no longer appears to satisfy the conditions for receipt of the pension, increase or allowance currently in payment. The pensioner will be given 21 days in which to comment. If new evidence or fresh information is advanced by the pensioner, the Deciding Officer will re-examine the case. If, however, no new information is advanced or that advanced is considered by the Deciding Officer to have no material bearing on the case, the Deciding Officer will make a decision revoking the increase or allowance. There will be a right of appeal against this decision, as referred to already in this guideline.\n\nAlso, where initial enquiries with a pensioner, including written communication, fail to establish the facts as required payment of the increase or allowance may be suspended until the relevant information has been provided by the pensioner or a person acting on his/her behalf."
