        "text": "Important facts\n\nYou’ll be entitled to an additional amount for any child born before 6 April 2017.\n\nUniversal Credit will no longer pay you an additional amount for a third or subsequent child born on or after 6 April 2017, unless special circumstances apply.\n\nFor example, if you’re already claiming Universal Credit, have responsibility for 2 children and you then give birth to a new child, you won’t get an additional amount of Universal Credit for that new child, unless special circumstances apply.\n\nYou’ll still be entitled to additional support in respect of any disabled children, even if you aren’t getting an additional child amount of Universal Credit for the disabled child.\n\nYou may still be entitled to help with childcare costs for any of your children, even if you don’t get the additional child amount of Universal Credit for all of your children.\n\nWhen we refer to a ‘child’ in this guidance we mean a person:\n\nunder 16 years old\n\n16 to 19 years old (up to and including 31 August following their 19th birthday, if they are in eligible education or training\n\nMaking a new claim to Universal Credit\n\nUniversal Credit will accept new claims from families regardless of how many children you have. If you’re making a new claim, Universal Credit will pay an additional amount for all children born before 6 April 2017.\n\nAny special circumstances that applied in a previous award of Universal Credit, Child Tax Credit, Income Support or Jobseeker’s Allowance will continue to apply in your new Universal Credit award, unless the conditions for that exception are no longer met.\n\nSpecial circumstances\n\nWe call these special circumstances “exceptions”.\n\nIf you’re responsible for a third or subsequent child and they meet the criteria for the multiple births or non-consensual conception exceptions listed below, you may get the additional child amount of Universal Credit for that child.\n\nYou may also be able to get an exception for any children in your household who meet the criteria for the non-parental care or adoption exceptions. This will not affect any amounts you may be able to get for any other children in your household.\n\nMultiple births\n\nYou can get extra Universal Credit for your third and subsequent children if they are born as part of a multiple birth, apart from one child in that birth. This means the exception applies to the additional children in that birth.\n\nFor example, if you’re already getting additional amounts of Universal Credit for 2 existing children, then you have twins, we’ll pay an extra additional child amount of Universal Credit for one of those twins (meaning that in total you’ll be entitled to an amount for 3 out of your 4 children).\n\nWhere the first child of the multiple birth is either the first or second child in the household, we’ll pay a child amount for all the children born as part of the multiple birth.\n\nAdopted children\n\nSince 28 November 2018, the policy for when we’ll pay for children who are adopted has changed.\n\nIf you’re responsible for a child or children through adoption then you’ll be able to receive an additional amount for these children. This will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household.\n\nThe exception will usually apply from the date you become responsible for the adopted child.\n\nThis could be the date of formal adoption, or the date of placement, depending on when parental responsibility for the child passes to you. You’ll need to provide us with supporting documents for any adopted child or children who live with you.\n\nYou can’t get an additional amount for an adopted child if they are adopted from abroad, or you or your partner were their parent or step-parent immediately before you adopted them.\n\nChildren living with family and friends in non-parental caring arrangements\n\nSince 28 November 2018, the policy for when we’ll pay for children in non-parental caring arrangements has changed.\n\nIf you’re responsible for a child or children as part of non-parental caring arrangement then you’ll be able to receive an additional amount for these children. This will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household.\n\nYou can get an additional amount for any child or children who are living with you as part of either:\n\na formal caring arrangement\n\nan informal caring arrangement, where it is likely they would otherwise be looked after by a local authority\n\nDWP will also pay an additional child amount where a child in your household (under 16) has a child of their own, who you’re responsible for.\n\nFriend or family carers: formal caring\n\nIf you’re responsible for a child or children as part of a formal caring arrangement then you may be able to receive an additional amount for these children. This will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household.\n\nYou can get an additional amount for any child or children if you care for them under a formal caring arrangement, for example:\n\na child arrangements order\n\na guardianship order\n\na special guardianship order\n\nyou’re appointed as a guardian (in Scotland)\n\na kinship care order (in Scotland)\n\na permanence order (in Scotland)\n\nThe exception also applies if one of these formal arrangements was in place but ended on the child’s 16th birthday, as long as you have continued to be responsible for them since.\n\nFriend or family carers: informal caring\n\nIf you’re responsible for a child or children as part of an informal caring arrangement then you may be able to receive an additional amount for these children. This will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household.\n\nThe exception will only apply if it’s likely that the child would otherwise be looked after by a local authority.\n\nYou’ll need to provide supporting documents from a local authority social worker using the IC1 support for a child who is informally living with you form.\n\nThis exception will not apply if you, or your partner, are a parent or a step-parent of the child.\n\nFriend or family carers: under 16s who have a child\n\nThis exception applies where a child under 16 who you’re responsible for becomes the parent of a child. You may get additional Universal Credit for the new child if they are also within your household. This will not affect the amount you may get for any other children in your household.\n\nYou’ll continue to get the additional amount until the young parent either:\n\nis aged 16 and is able to claim Universal Credit, or\n\nleaves your household, leaving their child in your care, unless another exception applies\n\nChildren likely to have been conceived as a result of a non-consensual sexual act (including rape), or at a time when the claimant was subject to ongoing control or coercion by the other biological parent of the child\n\nYou can get additional Universal Credit for third or subsequent children in your household who are likely to have been conceived as a result of a sexual act to which you didn’t or couldn’t consent.\n\nThis relates to a child who either:\n\nis likely to have been born as a result of a non-consensual conception (including rape)\n\nwas conceived at or around a time when your relationship with the other biological parent of the child was abusive and you were subject to ongoing control or coercion\n\nIn order to qualify for this exception (for a third or subsequent child) you must no longer be living with the child’s biological parent and you’ll be asked to confirm this.\n\nWe recognise that the handling of this exception is extremely sensitive. However, it is very important to have this exception in place to support you if you’re in this position.\n\nDWP staff will not question you about the incident other than to receive the claim and the supporting information. Any information received will be handled in accordance with the rules that DWP already use for holding and using extremely sensitive information.\n\nYou can find further information in the DWP personal information charter.\n\nThis exception may apply where there has been a conviction for rape or for controlling or coercive behaviour, or where you have received a Criminal injuries Compensation Payment, but there doesn’t need to have been a court case or a conviction. If you have information about either a conviction or payment, we can use this to support your application for this exception.\n\nIf you don’t already have documents to support this exception you’ll be able to fill in a support for a child conceived without your consent form. You can do this with help from organisations or individuals such as:\n\nhealthcare professionals, for example, doctors, nurses, midwives or health visitors\n\nregistered social workers\n\nspecific organisations, such as specialist rape charities – find a list of these organisations\n\nThey’ll need to provide confirmation that your circumstances are consistent with the exception criteria. You’ll not be placed in the position of having to give details about the circumstances of the conception to DWP staff.\n\nEven where you can’t get this confirmation, please contact your work coach. They will be able to help you get the third party support you need.\n\nIf you’ve been affected by a crime, domestic abuse or have found this information distressing, there’s support available for you.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone please contact one of the following organisations:\n\nSexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) – some areas of the UK have SARCs, use the NHS website to find one in your area\n\nThe Survivors Trust – has over 135 member agencies across the UK which provide support for survivors of rape, sexual violence or childhood sexual abuse (Phone: 0808 801 0818)\n\nRape Crisis England and Wales – a national charity and the umbrella body for a network of independent member Rape Crisis Centres (Phone: 0808 802 9999)\n\nFreephone National Domestic Abuse Helpline, run by Refuge, run by Refuge, is a 24 hour, national service (Phone: 0808 2000 247)\n\nRape Crisis Scotland – (Phone: 0808 801 0302)\n\nScottish Domestic Abuse and Forced Marriage Helpline – a free 24 hour helpline staffed by specially trained workers and volunteers managed by Scottish Women’s Aid (Phone: 0800 027 1234)\n\nWales Domestic Abuse Helpline – a free 24 hour helpline run by Welsh Women’s Aid (Phone: 0808 80 10 800)\n\nVictim Support – an independent charity offering support to people affected by crime or traumatic events (Phone: 0808 168 9111)\n\nthe National Stalking Helpline – provides guidance and information to anybody who is currently or has previously been affected by harassment or stalking (Phone: 0808 802 0300 or email: advice@stalkinghelpline.org)\n\nYou may find the Victim’s Information Service website useful for locating support in your local area.\n\nApplying for an exception\n\nWhen you tell us about a new child in your household, you’ll be given information about the exceptions.
