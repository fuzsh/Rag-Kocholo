        "text": "There are three levels of programme you can do which, when you’ve successfully completed them, lead to a Bronze, Silver or Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s Award. The main differences between them are the minimum length of time it takes to complete them, how challenging it is and the minimum age you can start.\n\nSectional activities need to average an hour a week, with the first and last activities being the full section duration apart. At Bronze level, it is typical for activities to be weekly. For longer sections at Silver and Gold (potentially at Bronze, depending on the activity), it can help for the activity to be longer (in terms of hours per session) but less often. This can be particularly good for the Volunteering section to allow participants to take on more interesting, challenging and responsible activities. For example, in a Gold programme lasting 12 or 18 months, a participant could do one longer session (e.g., 6 hours) of volunteering per month. Please note that activity cannot be condensed to less than one session per month.\n\nFor each section, you should set a challenging but achievable goal and be able to demonstrate development and regular progress towards this goal. All activities must be completed before your 25th birthday.\n\nDepending on your age, you are free to start at any level, but most people prefer to start at Bronze and work upwards."
