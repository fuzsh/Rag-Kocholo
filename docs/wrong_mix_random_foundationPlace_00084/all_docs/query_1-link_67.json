        "text": "Once again, Delta people are celebrating having been recognized as the best U.S. airline by The Points Guy—for the sixth time since 2018.\n\nThe Points Guy’s editorial team compiled data across a diverse range of metrics, including operational reliability, customer experience, network, cost and loyalty offerings, using a weighted formula to arrive at their rankings.\n\n“Delta once again topped the Best Airlines report, proving that consistency is key for travelers as they take to the skies in record numbers,” said Brian Kelly, Founder of The Points Guy. “We understand that a traveler’s airline choice is a personal decision based on how they like to fly. That’s why we created this resource to help readers [...] make informed decisions.”\n\nIt’s another accolade for America’s most awarded airline, which in 2024 alone has been recognized by J.D. Power as the top-ranked airline for First/Business and Premium Economy Passenger Satisfaction; by Cirium as the most on-time airline in North America; by Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list, and by Fortune as one of the Top 50 Most Admired Companies – just to name a few.\n\n“This award speaks to the dedication and capability of our people,” said E.V.P. and Chief Customer Experience Officer Allison Ausband. “In every season and in the face of every challenge, Delta people rise to the occasion and set us apart, year after year.”"
