        "text": "ACM, CMA and CMT Award-winning artist Luke Combs has released his new song, “Six Feet Apart,” today. Listen/share HERE. Co-written with Brent Cobb and Rob Snyder, Combs originally debuted the song last month during a livestream concert.\n\nCombs will continue his at-home concerts tonight at 7:00 p.m. CT—this time partnering with Miller Lite to help support out-of-work bartenders nationwide. Fans can watch the performance via Luke’s Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages and donate to Miller Lite’s #VirtualTipJar campaign by visiting virtual-tips.org.\n\nThe new song adds to a series of groundbreaking and historic years for Combs, who is nominated in three categories at the 55th ACM Awards: Entertainer of the Year, Male Artist of the Year and Album of the Year for his acclaimed global No. 1 record, What You See Is What You Get.\n\nWhat You See Is What You Get—out now on River House Artists/Columbia Nashville (stream/purchaseHERE )— debuted at No. 1 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart as well as Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart this past November with 172,000 equivalent units sold and also enjoyed the largest streaming week ever for a country album with 74 million on-demand streams. It also achieved the biggest first week of album streams ever for a country artist on Apple Music and was the first country album ever to hit No. 1 on the platform’s U.S. overall albums chart, while also setting a new global record for first-week streams for a country album at Spotify and breaking the Amazon Music record for more first-week streams than any other country album debut. Moreover, Combs made his debut as the musical guest on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” earlier this year with host JJ Watt performing two songs from, What You See Is What You Get: “Lovin’ On You” and “Beer Never Broke My Heart.”"
