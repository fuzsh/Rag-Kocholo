        "text": "The Medal of Honor is awarded by the President in the name of Congress to members of the naval service, who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty\n\n(1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;\n\n(2) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or\n\n(3) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\n\nThere must be no margin of doubt or possibility of error in awarding this honor. To justify the decoration, the individual's service must clearly be rendered conspicuous above their comrades by an act so outstanding that it clearly distinguishes their gallantry beyond the call of duty from lesser forms of bravery; and it must be the type of deed which if not done would not subject the individual to any justified criticism. The deed must be without detriment to the mission of the command or to the command to which attached.\n\nAwarded to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Navy or Marine Corps, distinguishes himself by extraordinary heroism not justifying the Medal of Honor\n\n(1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;\n\n(2) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or\n\n(3) while serving with friendly foreign forces in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\n\nTo warrant this distinctive decoration, the act or the execution of duty must be performed in the presence of great danger or at great personal risk and must be performed in such a manner as to set the individual apart from his shipmates or fellow Marines. An accumulation of minor acts of heroism does not justify the award. The high standards demanded must be borne in mind when recommending the award.\n\nAwarded to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Navy or Marine Corps, is cited for gallantry in action that does not warrant the Medal of Honor or Navy Cross\n\n(1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;\n\n(2) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or\n\n(3) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\n\nThe heroic act(s) performed must render the individual conspicuous and well above the standard expected. An accumulation of minor acts of heroism normally does not justify the award, but unusual or exceptional cases will be decided on their merits.\n\nAwarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the armed Forces of the United States, distinguishes himself after 6 December 1941, by heroic or meritorious achievement or service, not involving participation in aerial flight.\n\n(1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;\n\n(2) while engaged in military operation involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or\n\n(3) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed forces in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\n\nTo justify this decoration, accomplishment or performance of duty above that normally expected, and sufficient to distinguish the individual among those performing comparable duties is required, although less than the requirements for the Silver Star or Legion of Merit. Minor acts of heroism in actual combat, single acts of merit or meritorious service connection with military or naval operations may justify this award.\n\nCombat Distinguishing Device. The Combat Distinguishing Device may be authorized.\n\nAwarded to members of the Armed Forces of the United States who, while serving under competent authority in any capacity with an Armed Force of the United States after 5 April 1917, has been killed or wounded.\n\n(1) In action against an enemy of the United States.\n\n(2) In action with an opposing armed force of a foreign country in which the Armed Forces of the United States are or have been engaged.\n\n(3) While serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\n\n(4) As the result of an act of any such enemy or opposing armed force.\n\n(5) As the result of an act of any hostile foreign force.\n\n(6) As the result of friendly weapon fire while actively engaging the enemy.\n\n(7) As the indirect result of enemy action. (example: injuries resulting from parachuting from a plane brought down by enemy or hostile fire.)\n\n(8) As the result of maltreatment inflicted by their captors while a prisoner of war.\n\n(9) After 28 March 1973, as a result of international terrorist attack against the U.S. or a foreign nation friendly to the U.S.\n\n(10) After 28 March 1973, as a result of military operations while serving outside the territory of the United States as part of a peacekeeping force.\n\nAwarded to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Navy or marine corps (including foreign military personnel), distinguishes him/herself after 6 December 1941, by heroic or meritorious achievement or service. To merit this award, the acts or services must be accomplished or performed in a manner above that normally expected and sufficient to distinguish the individual above those performing similar services, as set forth in the following:\n\n(1) For Acts of Heroism. Worthy of special recognition, but not to the degree required for the Bronze Star Medal when combat is involved or the Navy and Marine Corps Medal when combat is not involved.\n\n(2) For Meritorious Achievement. Outstanding and worthy of special recognition, but not to the degree required for the Bronze Star Medal or Air Medal when combat is involved or the Meritorious Service Medal or Air Medal when combat is not involved. The achievement should be such as to constitute a definite contribution to the naval service, such as an invention, or improvement in design, procedure, or organization.\n\n(3) For Meritorious Service. Outstanding and worthy of special recognition, but not to the degree required for the Bronze Star Medal or Air Medal when combat is involved or the Meritorious Service Medal or Air Medal when combat is not involved. The award may cover an extended period of time during which a higher award may have been recommended or received for specific act(s). The criteria, however, should not be the period of service involved, but rather the circumstances and conditions under which the service was performed. The performance should be well above that usually expected of an individual commensurate with his grade or rate, and above that degree of excellence which can be appropriately reflected in the individuals fitness report or personnel records.\n\nCombat Distinguishing Device. The Combat Distinguishing Device may be authorized.\n\nAwarded to members of the Navy and Marine Corps, including members of Reserve components on active or inactive duty, of the grade of lieutenant commander/major and junior thereto, for service performed on or after 1 May 1961. The award shall be given for meritorious service or achievement in a combat or noncombat situation based on sustained performance or specific achievement of a superlative nature, and shall be of such merit as to warrant more tangible recognition than is possible by a fitness report or evaluation sheet, but which does not warrant a Navy & Marine Corps Commendation Medal or higher. The Navy & Marine Corps Achievement Medal may also be awarded to members of the armed forces of a friendly foreign nation consistent with the eligibility requirements specified in chapter 6.\n\n(1) Professional achievement which merits the award must:\n\n(a) Clearly exceed that which is normally required or expected, considering the individuals grade or rate, training, and experience; and\n\n(b) Be an important contribution of benefit to the United States and the naval service.\n\n(2) Leadership Achievement which merits the award must :\n\n(a) Be noteworthy;\n\n(b) Be sustained so as to demonstrate a high state of development or, if for a specific achievement, be of such merit as to earn singular recognition for the act(s); and\n\n(c) Reflect most creditably on the efforts of the individual toward the accomplishment of the unit mission.\n\nCombat Distinguishing Device. The Combat Distinguishing Device may be authorized."
