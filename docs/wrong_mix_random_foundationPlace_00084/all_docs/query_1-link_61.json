        "text": "The awards recognise the innovation, passion and adaptability that organisations working with disadvantaged children and families have in spades – and champion to the sector and society at large the beneficial impact of their work.\n\nEvery year we receive around 500 entries from organisations, teams and individuals delivering services across local authorities, public sector agencies, voluntary organisations and private providers.\n\nThe awards categories cover many aspects of the sector including early help, childcare, children's mental health, child protection, social care, youth work and youth justice services. Partnership working, a commitment to evaluation and embracing co-production are core values for the awards.\n\nThe CYP Now Awards 2023 open in early April. See www.cypnowawards.com for information about the awards categories, how to enter and the gala awards ceremony. As the search for this year's winners gets under way, we profile four of the people and projects that won awards in 2022.\n\nFamilies of abuse survivors need support, understanding and greater recognition\n\nCath Pickles\n\nWinner Children and Young People's Champion\n\nI founded the community interest company Restitute, which supports third-party victims of sexual and violent crime – including parents, carers and siblings of children who have been sexually abused or exploited.\n\nMy daughter – who has waived her right to anonymity and proudly supports our work – was sexually abused between the ages of eight and 11.\n\nAt the time, there was very little advice or guidance to support us as a family and we struggled to deal with the emotional trauma and the countless agencies involved.\n\nBut once our daughter started to recover, we realised we had gathered a huge amount of knowledge and had a clear idea of what was needed by people just like us.\n\nRestitute has now been running for more than four years. We provide support workers to help families deal with the emotional aftermath of violence and abuse and help with practical tasks such as filling in forms and attending meetings, which can seem overwhelming.\n\nOften the people we work with become single parents overnight. They are expected to carry on working, paying bills, sorting out childcare while police and social workers invade their lives.\n\nWe assist those plunged into poverty and ensure carers get the therapy they need to support the recovery of everyone in the family.\n\nWe have supported 260 families to date. The fact we are an independent service – operating outside the statutory sector and separately to any support the primary victim of abuse may be getting – is key. Our clients know our support will continue when other help falls away and know they can ask questions without fear of being judged.\n\nBuilding an awareness of the existence and needs of people caring for survivors of sexual or violent crime has been tough. But recent developments such as the Victims Bill – currently working its way through Parliament – fill me with hope.\n\nI was incredibly proud to win a CYP NowAward and can see it is already having an impact by encouraging people to listen to what we have to say more carefully and factor the people we work with into their plans.\n\nOur ambition is to ensure the support provided by Restitute is available to any family in the UK that needs it. Not only will this save countless ruined lives, but will result in huge savings to the public purse by helping prevent poor mental and physical health, drug and alcohol abuse, family conflict, suicide and crime.\n\nIt costs £5,000 on average for us to support an entire family and give them a real chance of long-term sustainable recovery. Without that, the cost of life-long support for a single victim – just to the NHS – can be as much as £4m.\n\nAs for my own family, we’re thriving and my daughter is the happiest she has been, although – as with any parent in my situation – I can never assume “it's over”.\n\nBy Cath Pickles, chief executive and founder, Restitute www.restitute.org\n\nCreative workshops boost aspirations\n\nDream Believe Succeed\n\nWinner The Youth Work Award\n\nDream Believe Succeed is a creative arts programme that provides a safe environment for children and young people from Edmonton, north London, to talk about their experiences at the same time as developing transferrable skills.\n\nIt is a collaboration between Edmonton Community Partnership – an alliance of 18 schools – three community organisations and local young people and is funded by the Mayor of London's Young Londoners Fund.\n\nThe project works with young people aged 10 to 16 at risk of being drawn into crime, offering them the chance to take part in creative workshops including film-making, DJ-ing and graffiti art.\n\nWe also employ youth mentors who do one-to-one and group work with the most at-risk young people.\n\nTo date, we have reached more than 3,000 young people. Dream Believe Succeed provides them with access to trusted adults who work with them on aspects of personal and social development.\n\nThey gain a more positive view of themselves and the things they can achieve as well as access to education, training and employment opportunities.\n\nThe project raises their aspirations and helps remove them from a dangerous downward spiral that could see them drop out of education and into crime and violence.\n\nRecent developments include the creation of a youth hub in the Pymmes Park area of Edmonton, which will allow the project to expand and offer a wider range of out-of-school provision.\n\nBy Trevor Blackman, chief executive, Edmonton Community Partnership edmontoncommunitypartnership.org\n\nMEET THE PRACTITIONER\n\nSimon Tomlinson, graffiti artist\n\nI run the Arts and Graff project which delivers creative art and graffiti workshops across 18 local schools as part of Dream Believe Succeed.\n\nWe create everything from murals to artworks on canvas, caps, T-shirts and record sleeves during hands-on sessions that give young people hope and a sense of positive representation.\n\nFunding is a huge challenge. We need long-term support because we don't want to start working with young people only to be forced to stop when funding runs out. I would love to see the project have a sustainable future and reach even more young people who need it.\n\nI’m a parent and grew up in the local area so I know what I needed to help me navigate the world when I was young. This project tries to provide the support we needed in our own childhoods.\n\nI see the change within these kids. If we weren't there, I can see what it would be like and where they might end up.\n\n‘Awards showcase commitment, courage and compassion’\n\nInaam Barkatoolah, young judge in 2022\n\nLast year's CYP Now Awards featured dozens of exceptional entries.\n\nThey all demonstrated immense commitment to creating a better society. Every initiative was built from the ground up with noble intentions. Identifying the winning entry is never a simple task.\n\nYoung people represent rapid change, innovation and a new way of doing things. We look for just that in the judging process – pioneering interventions or services that meet children's and young people's needs and campaigns that make promises and boldly deliver.\n\nWe cherish the entries that have love woven into the very stitches of their fabric, those that have taken incredible courage and sacrifice to establish. They have not only overcome challenges but embraced them. They have been fearless in their pursuit of a more just and compassionate society.\n\nWe recognise change starts from the grassroots. We prize the problem-solvers; those addressing issues in society that are otherwise neglected.\n\nEvery person or group of people submitting an entry deserves recognition. Their passion for improving children and young people's lives shines through and for that, we are incredibly grateful.\n\nInaam is an apprentice solicitor and founder of the Young Humanitarians’ Association\n\n‘I looked for projects that made a difference’\n\nAlison O’Sullivan, judge in 2022\n\nI know from my own experience managing organisations, the impact winning an award can make. We all like to be told we are doing well.\n\nSubmitting an entry for an award brings benefits, as people pause to describe their achievements and what is good about their work. There is a positive impact on morale.\n\nAwards are also important for the sector and wider workforce. The CYP Now Awards not only celebrate best practice but also spread knowledge, information and new ideas.\n\nThe most important thing I look for in an entry is that the work is making a difference. Evidence of impact on the people it is intended to help is essential.\n\nMaking an impact on professional practice, developing new approaches, contributing to improving systems or changing how we think about complex problems – all of this will impress. So too is good use of long-standing practice in new ways or for new groups of people.\n\nIn all cases it is important to show evidence of the difference being made, both quantitative and qualitative. Stories and accounts from individuals, be they users of services or professionals, help bring ideas to life.\n\nIt's easy to see the benefits of focused projects. But it is also important to recognise when the dogged application of support in difficult circumstances, or for people who have historically seemed hard to help, make things better too.\n\nAlison O’Sullivan is chair of the National Children's Bureau\n\nCreating local homes for children in care\n\nCartrefi Clyd\n\nWinner The Children in Care Award\n\nCartrefi Clyd is run by the Isle of Anglesey County Council and provides homes for children in care, allowing children from the island to continue living here.\n\nThe project is based on the small group home model of care and support and we accommodate a maximum of two children aged eight to 18 in any one of our properties.\n\nThe service is designed to provide care within a typical family home central to a local community. Children and young people continue to attend local schools and grow up using and hearing the Welsh language and culture. They live together in high-quality “homely” surroundings and – like any other child on the island – play locally and have neighbours and friends.\n\nCreating our own homes in the heart of local communities helps reduce stigma for children not living with their families and prevents them being placed in residential settings a long way from Anglesey.\n\nSince winning the CYP Now Award we have had a lot of interest from housing providers who wish to build new properties for us and we have had other local authorities contact us to learn about the service.\n\nWe are about to plan our next two houses which means we will soon have six Cartrefi Clyd houses on Anglesey.\n\nWe are extremely proud of Cartrefi Clyd, our staff and – most importantly – our young people. Children who have lived with us have all gone on to do very well, either moving into semi-independent accommodation or back to their families.\n\nBy Rachel Williams, service manager, adults and children's services, Isle of Anglesey County Council www.anglesey.gov.uk\n\nMEET THE PRACTITIONER\n\nRoxanne Lloyd, residential worker, Cartrefi Clyd\n\nI have worked with children in care for about four years and have completed my Level 3 Diploma in Health and Social Care (Children & Young People).\n\nWorking for Cartrefi Clyd is about making children and young people feel safe, accepted and loved. It's about creating an environment where they can relax and grow into the best versions of themselves regardless of early childhood traumas.\n\nIt is also about giving children and young people experiences they may have never had before and teaching them new routines and traditions, which they can hopefully carry on into adulthood and share with their own families, helping to break the care cycle.\n\nI consider it a massive privilege to work with the most vulnerable children and young people of Anglesey and hopefully make their lives a little easier for the time they are with us.\n\nThe thing I enjoy the most has to be getting the children and young people out and about. I love it when they try new things and find a new hobby or interest. I also love seeing just how much they progress and achieve.\n\nNew and exciting experiences boost children's confidence and self-esteem\n\nFeel Good Friday\n\nWinner The Learning Award\n\nAurora Hanley School is an independent special educational needs setting for pupils with autism and social communication difficulties, many of whom have high anxiety.\n\nOur pupils have often had disrupted educational journeys and it is not unusual for them to have been out of school for long periods of up to three years before joining us.\n\nThe school provides a safe and caring environment where children and young people flourish. However, we realised we needed to do more to expose them to the outside world, new people and new opportunities. This was particularly important in the wake of the pandemic, which meant many of our children had socialised or left the house even less than normal.\n\nSo we developed a project called Feel Good Friday with the aim of providing new and exciting experiences that were not only interesting and fun but would help boost pupil's confidence and self-esteem.\n\nWe start by asking pupils about the kind of projects and activities they are interested in doing. Projects run for six weeks and we offer a wide range across the year, which take place on and off site.\n\nPupils sign up to those that take their interest and are encouraged to stick with the activities they choose.\n\nIn 2021/22 pupils had the opportunity to participate in projects including a six-week drama project based at a local theatre, a project with a local farm that involved caring for animals and a film-making project with Staffordshire University working with staff and students.\n\nWhat has been so successful about this initiative is the quality of the projects we’ve been able to provide working with universities, colleges, theatres and sports providers. It has opened up new horizons for pupils, linking to employment and further education and giving pupils a bank of positive experiences to draw on in future.\n\nWe have had some huge successes with students finding new interests and rediscovering passions. Students have grown in confidence and report a positive impact on their mental health.\n\nOne pupil who visited Staffordshire University's e-sports studio as part of a tour has decided to pursue a career in this field and has now moved to college to study e-sports.\n\nBy Julie Cartwright, head of school, Aurora Hanley School www.theauroragroup.co.uk\n\nMEET THE PRACTITIONER\n\nBecky Fox, pastoral lead manager, Aurora Hanley School\n\nMy role is to ensure our pupils are mentally, emotionally and socially supported to learn and reach their full potential. This can be challenging when working with young people who have high anxiety and low self-esteem.\n\nBy offering Feel Good Friday sessions, pupils can be exposed to environments they have previously become overwhelmed by, building their resilience for daily life. It is rewarding to see the emotional and social skills developed during these times.\n\nI discuss with pupils what opportunities they would like to see on offer then research local charities, colleges, universities and businesses to make links. Pupils learn life skills, reach personal targets and gain ideas for future pathways.\n\nThe sessions are delivered in a safe, supportive and nurturing way and are an opportunity for pupils to build trust and positive relationships with staff and their peers. I find this really rewarding and enjoy seeing students slowly becoming more confident as they try new things and succeed.\n\nChildren & Young People Now Awards 2023\n\nThe Children & Young People Now Awards 2023 opens for entries on Monday 3 April.
