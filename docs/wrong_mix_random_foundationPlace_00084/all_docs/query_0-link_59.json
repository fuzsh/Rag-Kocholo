        "text": "I’m very honored to be one of the final judging panelists together with Surendra Rosha Terecina Kwong Jessica Lee for the Asia-Pacific Data Quest this year and witnessed 12 top teams presenting their innovative and brilliant ideas to tackle some of our most complex business challenges in the markets. Congratulations to the teams who won in the final pitch! They are perfect examples of how Technology could partner with our business to unlock commercial value and improve our customer experience. Can’t wait to see these fantastic ideas come true in the near future. #HSBC #DataQuest #Innovation #Collaboration\n\nSo great to have our Group CIO Stuart Riley Stuart Riley in town this week together with the visiting Technology ExCo members Wendy Wang Wendy Wang, Stephen Bayly Stephen Bayly, Kai Yang Kai Yang and James Elwes James Elwes. This is Stuart’s first visit to our China Tech Centre since he took the role earlier this year. He was very excited to meet the business Didy Xie Daniel Chan, operations Lily Shen Nathan Li, local tech teams Eros YeYong XiaWinne ChenCarmen WuEdward LiuEric DuJaisy He and talent on the ground to better understand the bank, China Tech Centre and our systems, as well as our people. Sharing some pictures below to capture some key activities this week. Picture 1-2: Met major tech teams in the centre and saw some great systems the frontline teams manage end to end; joined the discussion on GenAI adoption in business and Technology. Ian Glasner Picture 3: Had meetings and floor walks with our China business and operations leaders, and strategic partner to talk about collaboration and projects. Picture 4-7: Had separate exchange sessions with talents of different backgrounds ranging from senior leaders, engineers, to D&I network Amy Barnes; connected with China colleagues in a townhall to share Technology priorities and talk about various hot topics. A great thank-you to the team for your great commitment and fabulous work as always! So proud to be part of the China Tech Centre team. #HSBC #DigitiseAtScale\n\nFor the first time ASP Tech leaders, our global head of tech centres as well as the tech centre heads from different locations gathered in Guangzhou last week for a three-day joint offsite. We got together for a common purpose, which is to energise and mobilise as one team to deliver for our customers with an engineering-first mindset. We had a case study to get insights about running a world-class solution centre. We heard from our key business stakeholders their strategic focuses and expectations to reassure our direction of travel. We also visited our peer companies in Shenzhen and exchanged with academic experts to understand the latest market and industry dynamics and explore potential partnership opportunities. Driving engineering excellence with an engineering-first mindset is on top of our agenda. Like our Group CIO Stuart Riley said, Technology plays such a pivotal role at HSBC, underpinning everything that the bank delivers for our customers. So we spent a good amount of time delving into engineering related strategic topics and actions including GenAI, resilience, quality & productivity, future state of architecture, people and talent, and so on. As we land those actions as one team across Technology, regions and tech centres, I’m sure we could turbo charge the bank’s journey to digitize at scale. It was great to connect and engage with operations team and our colleagues through exchange, floor walks and townhall meeting, too. We have such an enterprising, collaborative and committed team. It lays a great foundation for our success while we strive to achieve our aspirations. Thank you all and together we succeed as one team.

Last weekend China tech centres leadership joined a series of internal and external engagement activities in Xi’an. We were very glad to connect with our local colleagues, industry peers, campus talent and universities, to celebrate our success, share our experience, while learning new knowledge and having great fun. We participated in the AI x FinTech Conference, which is the first large industry conference of its kind held in Xi’an and joined by 400 technologists across industries. As the industries are adopting generative AI it’s important for us to exchange our adoption experience and best practices. I’m sure regular networking and exchange of this kind is helpful as we support the bank to digitize at scale. An important agenda of the Xi’an trip is the China tech centres leadership offsite. We spent two days downloading strategic priorities of the Technology organization, discussing and aligning on actions to take the initiatives forward. We also connected with our local leaders to review and brainstorm on some strategic topics that are essential for the future development of the Xi’an tech centre, and China tech centres as a whole. I’m impressed by the energy level and commitment of the offsite participants. We are on track to drive the Technology agenda to achieve our aspirations. Sharing some photos below as there were many proud, exciting moments to capture. A big thank-you to the Xi’an team for making these great initiatives happen. See you soon again in Xi’an. Pic 1-2: Congratulations to the winners of our 2024 annual reward and recognition! Pic 3-4: Dr. Xia Yong, WPB Global Chief Architect, giving a keynote sharing at the main forum of AI x FinTech Conference; HSBC subject matter experts sharing expertise and experience at the HSBC Tech Forum. Pic 5-6: Congratulations to the 12 teams who won in the DeepRacer employee competition and campus competition. Pic 7: China tech centres partner with four major universities in Xi’an for a 3-year internship programme. Pic 8-11: We had our first leadership offsite and townhall meeting this year.\n\nIt’s the campus hiring high season and our talent engagement campaign is in full swing to attract young talent to join our China tech centres. It’s an important part of our robust talent agenda to intake more fresh graduates and interns to support our growth strategy. As a global technology team that’s empowering the digital-first bank, we are keen and proud to tell what our people are doing with technology to change the way the world banks, and what it’s like to work at HSBC Technology. Check out “Careers in Technology” on the HSBC corporate website to know about us. Apart from the live career event and partnerships with job portals and social media, we have also launched two competitions in China to reach out to the young people who are passionate about technology and innovation and making a difference leveraging them. The DeepRacer invites students from Xi’an universities to experience the joy of autonomous driving powered by machine learning, while the Girls Hackathon appeals to the young female talent from Guangzhou universities to join a two-day coding competition. I can’t wait to see the finalists demonstrating their talent in the final competition in Xi’an in end Mar and Guangzhou in April. Look forward to having young hires join us in our exciting journey to digitize the bank at scale. Follow us on WeChat to keep you up to speed on our latest developments. #HSBC #DigitiseAtScale #Innovation #investinwomen Bonnie Qiu 邱怡静 Richard Lord Lily Shen\n\nWe are very honoured to be recognized as a High-Tech Enterprise by the national and Guangdong government authorities in 2023. This is the second time that tech centres China received this national endorsement, which is led by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China. Conducted every three years, the certification acknowledges the leading enterprises with significant research and development commitment and major contributions to the local high-tech industry. My heartfelt gratitude goes to all colleagues for their unwavering commitment and great contributions, and the strong support of governments at all levels and our partners. In recent years, we continue to invest in science and technology innovation, and encourage our technical talent to up-skill/re-skill themselves and innovate to stay competitive and create bigger business impact. In 2023 alone, we signed three partnership agreements with Fudan University and South China University of Technology to embark on forward-looking initiatives in the fields of software engineering digitization, ESG performance evaluation and emerging technologies. Our employee innovation programme – Angel Fund has received over 400 innovative ideas since 2019, 20% of which have been selected for incubation, generating more than 20 applications of invention patents and software copyrights. Our commitment is well reflected in the many awards and certifications we have received over the years, including Technologically Advanced Service Enterprise, CIFTIS Science and Technology Innovation Service Demonstration Case, and KPMG 2021 China's Leading Fintech 50 Enterprises, etc. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on our innovation and engineering capabilities uplift, and support the group “Digitise at Scale” strategy to deliver world-class digital banking now and for the future for our customers. #HSBC #DigitiseAtScale #Innovation\n\nThis week I was in our Xi’an tech centre to meet the local team and celebrate the Lunar New Year together. I was so glad to greet our colleagues in person with my best wishes for the year of the Dragon. Their happy faces and high morale inspired me. I also had robust conversations with our local leaders and colleagues on our strategic directions and key initiatives in 2024 through a series of exchange meetings. Xi’an tech centre plays an important role in delivering on our strategy. It was great to get their feedback and take away their good ideas. I’m sure the conversations will help us hit the ground running as we embrace new challenges in 2024. Another spotlight of my trip was the opening of our IT Express Centre in Xi’an. I’m glad that with the new facility, our Chief Technology Office will be able to provide better technology consultancy and hands-on IT support to Xi’an colleagues. I’m sure this will improve the technology experience of our colleagues as IT end-users. Wish everyone good health and happiness again in 2024 and I will be back to Xi’an soon. #HSBCEricEric DuJeff YangKelvin DuJaisy He PUBLIC"
