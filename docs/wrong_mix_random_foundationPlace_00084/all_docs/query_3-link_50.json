        "text": "About the course\n\nThis page is about the standard-entry Medicine course (A100).\n\nThe standard Oxford medical course has separate pre-clinical (years 1-3) and clinical (years 4-6). Students first gain a comprehensive grounding in medical science, before applying that scientific foundation in the clinical setting.\n\nVisit the A101 page to find out about our graduate-entry/accelerated medical degree.\n\nThe practice of Medicine offers a breadth of experiences impossible to find in any other subject. Every day brings different patients with different needs. It’s a great choice for scientists who strive to understand and apply research findings to improve the lives of the patients in their care. It offers a meaningful career that is prestigious, secure and well paid.\n\nHowever, practising Medicine can be arduous, stressful, frustrating and bureaucratic and is not suited to everyone. You need to be sure that Medicine is the right choice for you. These pages will help you work that out, but there’s no better way to find out for sure than by gaining insight into medical practice by seeing it in action and talking to those who provide healthcare. Studying Medicine because that is what is expected of you is never a good idea; make sure that your motives for choosing to do so are well-reasoned.\n\nThe Medicine course at Oxford provides a thorough intellectual training with particular emphasis on the basic science research that underpins medicine. We have retained a distinct three-year pre-clinical stage that includes studying towards a BA Honours degree in Medical Sciences, followed by a three-year clinical stage.\n\nThe School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Oxford is relatively small, allowing students and staff to get to know one another and benefit from a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.\n\nResearch work\n\nAll A100 students at Oxford undertake an experimental research project as part of their BA in Medical Sciences. This will be in a field of interest to the student, and will offer valuable first-hand experience of scientific research. Students have the opportunity to undertake research in a laboratory from a wide range of departments within the Medical Sciences Division.\n\nUnistats information\n\nDiscover Uni course data provides applicants with Unistats statistics about undergraduate life at Oxford for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nPlease select 'see course data' to view the full Unistats data for Medicine.\n\nPlease note that there may be no data available if the number of course participants is very small.\n\nVisit the Studying at Oxford section of this page for a more general insight into what studying here is likely to be like.\n\nMedicine\n\nThe pre-clinical stage\n\nApplicants are initially admitted to the pre-clinical stage of the course.\n\nThe first five terms of this course are devoted to the First BM. This addresses not only much of the science that underpins Medicine, but also the clinical problems that arise when systems fail. Students are introduced to the major systems of the body and study all aspects of their structure and function in health and also the principles of disease processes.\n\nStudents are encouraged to develop an enquiring approach and to consider the experimental basis of the science in the course. Matters of clinical relevance are illustrated from the outset with students making regular visits to GP tutors.\n\nThe First BM is followed by a four-term BA Honours course (the Final Honours School) in Medical Sciences. Students specialise in areas of biomedical science selected from a range of options. They will become adept at working from primary research literature, and will be encouraged to think both critically and creatively. Students will gain in-depth knowledge of their chosen options, as well as advanced technical skills at the laboratory bench and in scientific data handling and presentation.\n\nA typical week\n\nDuring the First BM, lectures and practicals occupy about half of the time, and the remainder is free for tutorial work, self-directed study and extracurricular activities.\n\nDuring the BA course, formal lecturing is kept to a minimum, and students are mostly free to pursue their research and to prepare for tutorials and seminars.\n\nThe college tutorial system is a central feature: students see their tutors and are taught weekly in groups often as small as two. This teaching can be tailored to individuals’ needs and interests and strong academic support ensures that students manage their time effectively. Classes and seminars usually contain between 10 and 50 students, while lectures are for up to 200 students.\n\nIn the pre-clinical stage of the course (years 1-3), most tutorials, classes, and lectures take place in the Medical Sciences Teaching Centre in the Science Area and are delivered by members of academic staff, research staff or NHS clinicians (usually at the level of consultant). Many are world-leading experts with years of experience in teaching and research.\n\nSome tutorial and class teaching may also be delivered by postgraduate students who are usually studying at doctoral level.\n\nIn the clinical stage of the course (years 4-6), most teaching is delivered by clinicians from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust as well as local primary care physicians, and University academic staff.\n\nTo find out more about how our teaching year is structured, visit our Academic Year page.\n\nCourse structure\n\nTerms 1-3 (First BM Part I)\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nOrganisation of the body\n\nPhysiology and pharmacology\n\nBiochemistry and medical genetics\n\nPopulation health 1: medical sociology\n\nLearning from Patients 1 course\n\nIn-person examinations and other types of assessment.\n\nTerms 4-5 (First BM Part II)\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nApplied physiology and pharmacology\n\nThe nervous system\n\nPrinciples of pathology\n\nPsychology for medicine\n\nLearning from Patients 2 course\n\nIn-person examinations and other types of assessment.\n\nTerms 6-9 (Final Honour Schools in Medical Sciences)\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nTwo options (from a range of 11, including Cardiovascular science, Pharmacology and signalling, Infection Biology and Cancer)\n\nEssay\n\nResearch project\n\nLearning from Patients 3 course\n\nA full list of course options is available on the Medical Sciences website.

Read further information about potential course changes.\n\nProgress to clinical training\n\nRegistered Oxford medical students who are eligible to progress to Clinical studies may apply to transfer to Oxford Clinical Medicine during the final year of their pre-clinical studies.\n\nAcademic requirements\n\nQualification\n\nRequirement\n\nA-levels:\n\nA*AA in three A-levels (excluding Critical Thinking and Thinking Skills) taken in the same academic year. Candidates are required to achieve at least a grade A in both Chemistry and at least one of Biology, Physics, Mathematics or Further Mathematics. We expect you to have taken and passed any practical component in your chosen science subjects.\n\nAdvanced Highers:\n\nAA (taken in the same academic year, in Chemistry, and one from Biology, Physics or Mathematics) plus Highers: AAAAA (taken in the same academic year).\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB):\n\n39 (including core points) with 766 at HL. Candidates are required to take Chemistry and at least one of Biology, Physics or Mathematics to Higher Level.\n\nBTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma:\n\nPlease visit the Medical Sciences website for details.\n\nAny other equivalent qualifications:\n\nOther national and international qualifications are also acceptable.\n\nPlease visit the Medical Sciences website for further guidance. Any candidate in doubt as to their academic eligibility for this course is strongly encouraged to seek advice by emailing [email protected].\n\nWherever possible, your grades are considered in the context in which they have been achieved.\n\nRead further information on how we use contextual data.\n\nVisit the Medical School's guidance on submitting information about extenuating circumstances.\n\nPlease note that we have no preference for whether the third or fourth A-level subject (or further subject in equivalent qualifications) is a science or not.\n\nLevel of attainment in Science and Mathematics\n\nThere are no formal GCSE requirements for Medicine. However, in order to be adequately equipped for the application process and for the academic demands of the course, applicants will need to have received a basic education in Biology, Physics and Mathematics. For example, students should have received at least a grade C/4 at GCSE, Intermediate 2 or Standard grade (Credit) or equivalent. The GCSE Dual Award Combined Sciences is also appropriate.\n\nVisit the Medical Sciences Shortlisting page for further details on how we assess GCSEs.\n\nGraduates\n\nStudents with degrees may apply for the standard course. There are no places specifically reserved for graduates, and there is no separate application process. Graduates are in open competition with school-leavers, and need to fulfil the same entrance requirements.\n\nIf English is not your first language you may also need to meet our English language requirements.\n\nApplying\n\nAll candidates must follow the application procedure as shown on our Applying to Oxford pages.\n\nThe following information gives specific details for students applying for this course.\n\nNo student is admitted without interview. Successful candidates must meet our requirements for health and fitness to practise.\n\nAdmissions test\n\nTest:\n\nUniversity Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT)\n\nTest date:\n\n8 July – 26 September 2024 (Applicants must create their own UCAT account and book a test date within this window. Please see our dedicated pages on UCAT for more information)\n\nRegistration deadline:\n\n19 September 2024 (12 noon BST)\n\nAll candidates must also take the University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT) as part of their application.\n\nSeparate registration for this test is required and it is the responsibility of the candidate to ensure that they are registered.\n\nWe strongly recommend making arrangements in plenty of time before the deadline. Please visit our UCAT webpage for further information.\n\nWritten work\n\nYou do not need to submit any written work when you apply for this course.\n\nWhat are tutors looking for?\n\nPlease note that competition to study Medicine at Oxford is particularly strong and only around 425 applicants are shortlisted for interview each year. No student is admitted without interview.\n\nStudents are selected for their scientific ability and for their aptitude for Medicine. Applicants are expected to show that they have a realistic understanding of what a medical career will involve, and that they have the potential to become effective and caring doctors.\n\nAll colleges use a common set of selection criteria that relate to academic potential and suitability for Medicine.\n\nVisit the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences website for further information about selection criteria.\n\nApplicants are free to make reference to skills or experience acquired in any context to illustrate how they might fulfil the selection criteria.\n\nSometimes candidates refer to voluntary work and other extra-curricular activities, but many forms of evidence can help demonstrate to tutors that a candidate has made an informed decision regarding their own suitability to study Medicine.\n\nThe Medical Schools Council has released some useful advice on gaining relevant experience in healthcare when it is difficult to find volunteering or work opportunities.\n\nInternational student quota\n\nPlease note that the number of international fee status medical students at each medical school in the UK is subject to a government quota. For Oxford this quota is currently a maximum of 14 per year across both the standard entry A100 and A101 graduate-entry/accelerated Medicine courses.\n\nApplication conditions\n\nOxford conforms to the UK Department of Health’s requirements regarding immunisation status and the GMC’s conditions on Fitness to Practise, and a satisfactory Disclosure and Barring Service check.\n\nStudents may be refused entry to, or be removed from, the University’s Register of Medical Students on grounds that may be either academic or non-academic (for instance health or conduct).\n\nApplicants should be aware that some practical studies involving living animal tissue are an obligatory component of the course.\n\nNote that students must have reached their 18th birthday by 1 November in the year they intend to start the course.\n\nFitness to Practise advice and support: General Medical Council and University of Oxford Occupational Health Service.\n\nCareers\n\nA vast array of speciality training pathways are available after obtaining a medical qualification, ranging from general practice or emergency medicine through obstetrics or ophthalmology to paediatrics or psychiatry.\n\nOf course, you need not remain confined to the clinic, the ward or the operating theatre: the lecture theatre or the laboratory could also beckon. Some of our graduates end up leading the education of the next generation of doctors or directing biomedical research.\n\nYou don’t need to know right now what you want to do when you qualify. The Clinical School organises careers sessions for final-year clinical students and helps students learn about and apply for foundation posts.\n\nBM BCh graduates are entitled to provisional registration with the General Medical Council (GMC) with a licence to practise, subject to demonstrating to the GMC that their fitness to practise is not impaired.\n\nTzveta is a consultant in oncology. She says:\n\n‘Many universities can teach you how to be a foundation doctor. Oxford taught me how to work through problems carefully and logically from first principles, and gave me the theoretical grounding to be able to do so. I had the opportunity to read key papers in my subject, then discuss them with the academics who had published them. Most importantly, Oxford taught me that I was capable of much more than I imagined or believed. Though I have gone from essay crises to night shifts, from finals to Royal College exams, the focused determination it instilled within me remains, driving me through any challenges faced along the way.’\n\nKanmin graduated from pre-clinical medicine in 2003. He is now a National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Academic Clinical Lecturer in ophthalmology at the University of Oxford. He is undergoing 50:50 surgical retina fellowship training and translational research into gene therapy for inherited retinal diseases. Kanmin says:\n\n‘The weekly essays and tutorials with world-leading academics in the colleges were an invaluable experience. In those intimate ‘mind sparring’ exercises, you go beyond the standard curriculum and probe the boundaries of the fundamental science behind modern medicine. In this way, Oxford nurtures not only sound medical practitioners but also future explorers and leaders in medicine… Of course, studying medicine at Oxford involves a lot of hard work. But the opportunities are also there to take part in the most vibrant student society/club life, whatever your hobby or background.’\n\nNote: These annual fees are for full-time students who begin this undergraduate course here in 2024. Course fee information for courses starting in 2025 will be updated in September.\n\nWe don't want anyone who has the academic ability to get a place to study here to be held back by their financial circumstances.

Please refer to the ‘Additional Fees and charges’ section below for information about the extended terms which apply for each year of the course in order to estimate your living costs. For further details please visit our living costs webpage.\n\nFinancial support\n\nHome\n\nA tuition fee loan is available from the UK government to cover course fees in full for Home (UK, Irish nationals and other eligible students with UK citizens' rights - see below*) students undertaking their first undergraduate degree**, so you don’t need to pay your course fees up front.\n\nIn 2022 Oxford is offering one of the most generous bursary packages of any UK university to Home students with a family income of around £42,875 or less, with additional opportunities available to UK students from households with incomes of £27,500 or less. The UK government also provides living costs support to Home students from the UK and those with settled status who meet the residence requirements.\n\n*For courses starting on or after 1 August 2021, the UK government has confirmed that EU, other EEA, and Swiss Nationals will be eligible for student finance from the UK government if they have UK citizens’ rights (i.e. if they have pre-settled or settled status, or if they are an Irish citizen covered by the Common Travel Area arrangement). The support you can access from the government will depend on your residency status\n\nVisit our Funding for UK medical students page for comprehensive funding information.\n\nIslands\n\n(Channel Islands and Isle of Man)\n\nIslands students are entitled to different support to that of students from the rest of the UK.\n\nPlease refer the links below for information on the support to you available from your funding agency:\n\nStates of Jersey\n\nStates of Guernsey\n\nIsle of Man\n\nOverseas\n\nPlease refer to the 'Other Scholarships' section of our Oxford Bursaries and Scholarships page.\n\n**If you have studied at undergraduate level before and completed your course, you will be classed as an Equivalent or Lower Qualification student (ELQ) and won’t be eligible to receive government or Oxford funding\n\nFees, funding and scholarship search\n\nAdditional Fees and Charges Information for Medicine\n\nPre-clinical Medicine\n\nIn the third term of the second year, students who undertake a research project may wish to remain in Oxford after the end of full term to facilitate completion of their project. However, this extended residence in Oxford is not a requirement and students should be aware that no financial support is available to help with any additional living costs during this time.\n\nView the likely range of living costs for an additional month in Oxford.\n\nClinical Medicine\n\nStudents in the Clinical School study for extended terms. You will need to budget for higher living costs in these three years, as you will be required to be in Oxford for longer than the standard terms.\n\nView the likely range of living costs for an additional month in Oxford.\n\nYear 4 – 40 weeks\n\nYear 5 – 48 weeks\n\nYear 6 – 48 weeks, including 10 weeks elective study\n\nVisit Funding for UK/EU Medical Students for more information about fees and funding for this course.\n\nElective study\n\nEach final-year student has a period of 10 weeks for elective study within the overall 48 weeks of the course. (This is year 6 for A100 students).\n\nYour elective study may be conducted in Oxford, elsewhere in the UK, or anywhere in the world provided the content of the placement is appropriate experience for medicine. Approval must be granted by the Director of Clinical Studies.\n\nA student who stays in Oxford for their elective would be expected to incur no additional costs apart from their living costs. Many students opt to travel outside the UK in which case the additional cost is on average around £3,000, but may be lower or higher depending on location (very occasionally a student has spent up to £9,000).\n\nStudents who have not completed the core training in clinical medicine may be required to follow a prescribed course of study in Oxford for all or part of their 10-week elective instead of arranging a placement.\n\nThere are opportunities to apply for additional financial support which varies depending on the destination proposed. This support is usually around £300 to £500 towards travel costs."
