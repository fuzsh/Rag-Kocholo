        "text": "A Few Words About Us\n\nSix Feet Apart Productions was born out of the never-ending need to entertain and be entertained. Armed only with a Zoom account, a sketchy internet connection, and the combined technical knowledge of an eight-year-old, Claire Hennessy and Regina Stoops are determined to turn Shelter-in-Place into Entertainment-in-Place.\n\nStay Six Feet Apart as we bring the entertainment from our living rooms to yours through storytelling, poetry, comedy, music, and who knows what else. An eclectic mix of online entertainment to feel connected in times of social distancing and self-isolation.\n\nOur online events bring you a mix of stories and storytellers, from Moth GrandSlam winners, like Nestor Gomez, to those who have never told a story on stage before. From Internationally known tellers like Bil Lepp (host of the History Channel's popular TV show \"Man vs History\") and award-winning folk tale storytellers (like Diane Ferlatte, Charotte Blake Alston and Odds Bodkin) to authors who just had their books launched into an environment with no bookstores. Plus an Open Mic StorySlam where you can vote on your favorite story and the winners go on to our Stellar StorySlam.\n\nWe also produce festivals, workshops, and comedy shows, plus we work closely with other organizations, such as the Storytelling Association of California (in particular Stories in Living Color), Better Said Than Done and Story Jam."
