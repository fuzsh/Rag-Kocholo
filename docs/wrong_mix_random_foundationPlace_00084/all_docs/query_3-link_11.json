        "text": "You must meet certain conditions to be eligible for the NCS:\n\nRelationship to the child: You or your current partner must be a parent of the child or acting in loco parentis (this means acting as a parent to the child).\n\nResidency status: You must be ordinarily resident in Ireland and have a legal right to live here (that is, you are either a national of an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland, UK citizen, or have immigration status (this includes the EU Temporary Protection Directive) or leave to remain).\n\nPPS numbers: You must provide your own PPS number and the PPS number of the child or children you are applying for.\n\nAge of the child: To qualify for the subsidies your child must be over 6 months and under 15 years of age.\n\nYou can read more about the eligibility criteria for subsidies in the NCS policy guidelines (pdf).\n\nHow is income assessed for the NCS?\n\nYou can choose to have your income assessed automatically or manually for the income-assessed subsidy. Your application will take longer if you choose the manual method.\n\nAutomatic method (Fast Track): Your income can be assessed automatically using information available from Revenue and the Department of Social Protection (DSP). If you agree to this, the NCS will get the information directly from Revenue and the DSP using your PPS number and your partner’s PPS number.\n\nManual method: You can ask for your income to be assessed manually. You must provide documents such as payslips or DSP declarations which show your income. These are reviewed and assessed by Pobal (the scheme administrator). You can get a full list of the documents accepted as proof of your income (income proofs) in Appendix 1 of the NCS policy guidelines (pdf).\n\nYou must declare additional income, such as any maintenance you pay or receive, any income that requires a Revenue Form 12, and any foreign income.\n\nWhat assessment period is used?\n\nYour income is normally assessed based on your reckonable income from all sources for the previous tax year.\n\nFor the 2023-2024 programme year, the previous tax year is 2022 (1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022).\n\nYou can choose to have the current year assessed if you believe your income from the current year will be significantly less than your income from the previous year. You may be asked to provide information to support this. Your application is then manually reviewed and assessed.\n\nYou can read more about current year assessments in the NCS policy guidelines (pdf).\n\nSelf-declarations and supporting documents may be checked on a sample basis.\n\nWhat is reckonable income?\n\nIf you are applying for an income-assessed subsidy, the rate you qualify for depends on your reckonable income.\n\nYour reckonable income is the total amount of your net family income. This is income from all sources (including most social welfare payments), after tax, PRSI and USC have been deducted.\n\nHowever, some social welfare payments and other allowable items or allowable deductions are excluded from reckonable income under the NCS – see below.\n\nWhat is counted as family income?\n\nIf you are parenting alone, only your reckonable income is calculated and assessed. If you are living with another adult who is not your partner (such as a parent or other relative), their income is not taken into account.\n\nIf you are living with your partner (such as a spouse, civil partner or co-habitant) your combined reckonable income is assessed. Your partner’s income will be included even if they are not your child’s parent or guardian. If your partner is living apart from you temporarily their income is still included.\n\nWhat are allowable deductions?\n\nWhen the NCS assesses your income, some of it is not taken into account. These are called allowable deductions or allowable items. Your reckonable income is reduced by the amount of the allowable deductions. Allowable deductions include:\n\nA multiple child discount of €4,300 if you have 2 children under 15\n\nA multiple child discount of €8,600 if you have 3 or more children under 15\n\nPension contributions, within the limit allowed by Revenue\n\nMaintenance payments you make to a child or a former spouse\n\nThe following social welfare payments:\n\nAftercare Allowance\n\nBack to Education Allowance\n\nBack to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance\n\nBack to Work Enterprise Allowance\n\nBack to Work Family Dividend\n\nBlind Welfare Allowance\n\nCaranua services support\n\nCarer’s Support Grant\n\nConstant Attendance Allowance\n\nDE Third Level Bursary Scheme\n\nDiet Supplement\n\nDomiciliary Care Allowance\n\nExceptional Needs Payments\n\nFET Training Allowance\n\nFoster Care Allowance\n\nGuardian’s Payment\n\nHumanitarian Assistance Scheme\n\nMobility Allowance\n\nPersonal Reader Grant\n\nRent Supplement\n\nShort-Term Enterprise Allowance\n\nSpringboard+\n\nStudent Assistance Fund\n\nStudent grant (SUSI)\n\nVTOS Training Allowance\n\nYouthreach Allowance\n\nHow many subsidised childcare hours am I entitled to?\n\nThe number of childcare hours you can get depends on the hours you (and your partner) work, study or train.\n\nEnhanced hours subsidy: If you (and your partner) are working, studying or training – you will be entitled to up to 45 hours of subsidised childcare per week.\n\nStandard hours subsidy: If you (and your partner) are not working, studying or training – you can qualify for up to 20 hours of subsidised childcare per week.\n\nSince 2 May 2022, hours spent in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) or school are not deducted from a family’s entitlement to subsidised hours under the National Childcare Scheme.\n\nHow are work, study and training hours assessed?\n\nAny part-time hours, casual working, or hours in labour activation schemes such as Gateway and SOLAS programmes, are counted as work.\n\nIf you are studying for a higher education course on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), this is counted under studying and training.\n\nYou may be asked for proof of work, study or training. You can read more about what is accepted as proof of work, study or training in the NCS policy guidelines (pdf).\n\nWhat if my circumstances change?\n\nChange of income: If your income suddenly changes for reasons outside your control (for example, if you lose your job or your hours at work are reduced), you can apply for a sudden change assessment. You can do this online at ncs.gov.ie or by post. This does not apply if you choose to change your income (for example, by going on a shorter working year or term-time working arrangement).\n\nYour new income assessment is based on the 4 weeks immediately before your application. Any subsidies awarded under a sudden change assessment are for 6 months only. After this, you must re-apply for a new subsidy.\n\nNo longer eligible: You must also notify Pobal if you are no longer eligible for the subsidy, for example, you are no longer caring for the child for whom you were given a subsidy. If you or your partner no longer meet the criteria for the enhanced hours subsidy, the subsidy ends 20 working days after the notification."
