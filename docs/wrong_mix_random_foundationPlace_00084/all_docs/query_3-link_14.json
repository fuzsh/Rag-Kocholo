        "text": "Which Award is Right for Me?\n\nThe Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program offers over 400 awards in more than 135 countries for U.S. citizens to teach, conduct research and carry out professional projects around the world.

Awards may involve limited teaching. Postdoctoral Awards are open to scholars who will have received a doctoral degree (Ph.D., J.D., M.D., Ed.D., etc.) within five to seven years of the fellowship start date, as noted in the award description.

Each award outlines the duration and potential start dates. Many awards offer a Flex option which is designed for Scholars who require multiple visits to the host country. This option allows grants to be conducted over short segments, preferably during the fall and/or spring semesters. Applicants should clearly indicate plans for Flex in their project statement and include a project timeline.\n\nView list of awards that allow for a Flex option.\n\nCareer Profile\n\nDistinguished Scholar (Mid-Career/Senior Academics)\n\nDistinguished Scholar applicants have more than seven years of experience in their discipline or area of expertise, though some awards may further restrict eligibility. Although Distinguished Scholars are eligible and can apply for most of the Scholar Awards, we encourage mid-career and senior academics to view the Fulbright Distinguished Scholar Awards.\n\nPostdoctoral Scholars\n\nPostdoctoral scholars will have received a doctoral degree (Ph.D., J.D., M.D., Ed.D., etc.) within five to seven years of the fellowship start date, as noted in the award description. Degree conferment before the start of the award is mandatory. Early Career Academics are those who have been working in the capacity of a teacher or scholar for no more than seven years. Check out the Postdoctoral Awards in our catalog of awards.\n\nFor more information, watch the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Awards for Postdoctoral and Early Career Applicants Webinar\n\nProfessionals\n\nProfessionals are defined as those who have more than seven years of experience in a particular profession.

As long as a Scholar has the requisite degree and experience to match the Award Requirements, an Independent Scholar’s application will be competitive!\n\nRetired and Emeriti Applicants\n\nThe Fulbright Scholar Program encourages retired faculty and Emeriti to apply for awards. In fact, Scholar Awards are an excellent post-retirement opportunity for Scholars to use their considerable years of teaching and research experience to fulfill Fulbright’s mission of citizen diplomacy.\n\nWhich Activity is Right For Me?\n\nIf you are a non-U.S. citizen, please review the Non-U.S (Visiting) Scholar programs.\n\nTeaching\n\nTeaching includes classroom teaching, as well as giving guest lectures, workshops, and seminars, and engaging in other related activities. Classroom teaching is typically at the undergraduate and graduate level, and courses may be designed by the scholar or prescribed by the host institution and may be taught or co-taught by the scholar. The teaching load varies by award, as well as the host institution. Scholars may also consult on building research capacity, advise graduate students, and assist with thesis advising.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch includes activities involving scientific research, qualitative research, quantitative research, and practice-based research, including artistic research. Research can take place in locations such as the laboratory, the field, the archives, or an artist residency. It can be experimental, clinical, or applied. It can include examining policies, systems, theories, methods, interactions, and works of art and music, with the objective to evaluate or develop new knowledge or works. Quantifiable (tangible) outcomes can include publications (books, journal articles, scripts, etc.), conference presentations, artistic and musical compositions, exhibitions, performances, films, and patents.\n\nTeaching/Research\n\nMany awards allow participants to conduct both research and teaching as defined above. Some awards will indicate the percentage that should be devoted to teaching compared to research while other awards allow the candidates to select their own percentage breakdown.\n\nProfessional Project\n\nThe Professional Project activity type provides professionals and artists in various fields the opportunity to interact with relevant organizations abroad to explore a topic related to their field without answering a defined research question. Professional Projects may include: professional consultations; artist residencies; visits to organizations in the applicant's field; practical experience in day-to-day operations; public lectures; mentoring; arranging exhibitions, performances or musical compilations; preparation of print materials (books, articles, or reviews); exchange of expertise with other professionals; participation in public events; or other appropriate professional activities.\n\nEligibility Essentials for U.S. Scholars\n\nIf you are a non-U.S. citizen, please review the Non-U.S (Visiting) Scholar programs.\n\nFulbright U.S Scholar applicants must meet all program eligibility requirements by the application deadline. Applicants must also meet award eligibility requirements by the application deadline unless specific exceptions are indicated in the award.\n\nThe complete Fulbright policies for U.S. Lecturers and Research Scholars are available here (Chapter 600).\n\nU.S. citizenship\n\nImage\n\nApplicants must hold U.S. citizenship by the application deadline. Permanent residence is not sufficient.\n\nDual citizenship: In some cases, a dual citizen may not be eligible to participate in a Fulbright program in the country of their other nationality due to host country law or policy. Individual award descriptions specify whether this is a point of ineligibility in the award requirements section.\n\nResidency abroad\n\nImage\n\nApplicants who have resided abroad for five or more years in the six-year period preceding the application deadline are ineligible. A period of nine months or more during a calendar year constitutes a full year.\n\nEducation, Experience, Career Profile\n\nImage\n\nApplicants are expected to demonstrate they meet the education, experience, and career profile requirements stated in the award. This may include addressing the nature of their terminal degree and/or experience in the application.\n\nAward descriptions specify where a Ph.D., other terminal degree, or comparable professional qualifications are required. A terminal degree refers to the highest degree awarded in a field. The degree level can vary by academic and professional field, as not all terminal degrees are doctorates. (Please refer to this list of common terminal degrees.) If a terminal degree is required, degree conferment before the fellowship start date is mandatory.\n\nPostdoc awards are open to scholars who will have received a doctoral degree (Ph.D., J.D., M.D., Ed.D., etc.) within five years of the fellowship start date, unless otherwise noted on the award description’s Award Requirements section.\n\nGraduate or doctoral students seeking funding to complete their degrees are ineligible. Recent college graduates with limited professional experience are ineligible and should instead apply to the Fulbright U.S. Student Program.\n\nExperience gained as an undergraduate student does not count toward years of experience for the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program (including internships and Fulbright U.S. Student Program awards).\n\nPrior Fulbright Scholar Awards\n\nImage\n\nRecipients of a Fulbright Scholar award are eligible to apply for another award two years after the date of completion of the previous award. For Flex grants, the two-year period begins at the end of the final grant in the series. Fulbright Scholar grants include: Fulbright U.S. Scholar, International Education Administrator Seminar, Fulbright Arctic, and Fulbright Visiting Scholar. Preference for Fulbright Scholar opportunities will be given to candidates who have not previously received a Fulbright Scholar grant.\n\nRecipients of a Fulbright Specialist Program grant are not required to adhere to the two-year waiting period before applying for a Fulbright Scholar award. Applicants may be on the Specialist roster, but may not carry out both a U.S. Scholar grant and a Specialist grant simultaneously.\n\nDepartment of State employees and their immediate family\n\nImage\n\nEmployees and their immediate families (i.e. spouses and dependent children) of the U.S. Department of State or the U.S. Agency for International Development (paid or unpaid, including part-time or temporary employees, consultants, externs, fellows and contract employees; does not include interns), and of public or private agencies (excluding educational institutions) under contract to the U.S. Department of State to perform administrative or screening services on behalf of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs’ exchange programs are ineligible to apply for a Fulbright award until one year after termination of such employment.\n\nAdditional U.S. Scholar Additional Eligibility Factors\n\nEmployment: The following are ineligible to apply for a Fulbright award until one year after termination of such engagement.

If required, this is noted in the Award requirements section of a specific award.\n\nSound physical and mental health: Candidates selected for awards are required to submit a Medical History and Examination Report before their grants can be finalized. (This is not part of the application and selection process; this process takes place after candidates selected for grants are notified of their selection.)\n\nApplicants are required to disclose if they have been arrested for, indicted for, or charged with a felony or a misdemeanor (excluding minor traffic violations, juvenile convictions, or cases where the record has been sealed or expunged) or accused of misconduct (including but not limited to unethical practices, harassment, sexual harassment or abuse, or other misconduct that may have been the focus of some kind of inquiry or process).

Introduce yourself and the activities you are interested in proposing; you may wish to include a copy of your curriculum vitae/resume. If they are interested in potentially hosting you and your project, you can then request a letter of invitation from them. (Letters are typically provided on university letterhead.) Note that many faculty are difficult to reach in July and August abroad, so start early; this process can take time.\n\nNote: An institution can provide invitations to multiple candidates.

Others require proficiency for teaching and/or research, while some suggest it may be useful. The language component of the application has two parts detailed below. Requirements vary per the award description.\n\nSelf-evaluation:\n\nThe Language Skills page in the application displays the award’s foreign language skills requirement and contains the self-evaluation. You can list up to three languages relevant to the proposed project and indicate your level of proficiency for each. Then, you will respond to short questions regarding your proficiency, including past experience and planned study.\n\nExternal evaluation:\n\nThe Recommendations and Language Evaluations page in the application is where you register a qualified foreign language evaluator.\n\nA qualified foreign language evaluator should be an instructor in the language or otherwise qualified to evaluate language proficiency.\n\nAnyone who serves as a language evaluator for your application cannot also provide a recommendation letter or letter of invitation for your application.\n\nFor applications where proficiency in multiple languages may be necessary, the application will allow for up to two external language evaluations to be submitted.\n\nLevels of proficiency:\n\nThe award description in the Catalog of Awards indicates the required level of language proficiency and which evaluation(s) are needed:\n\nAward requirement: Required\n\nSelf-Evaluation: Required: Applicant must complete self-evaluation for language(s) relevant to proposed project\n\nForeign Language Evaluation: Required: Applicant must register Foreign Language evaluator(s) (waived if native in all three skill areas)\n\nFor those providing the foreign language evaluation, please see these instructions.\n\nThe award description in the Catalog of Awards indicates the required level of language proficiency and which evaluation(s) are needed:\n\nAward requirement: None, English is sufficient\n\nSelf-Evaluation: Optional: Applicant can complete self-evaluation for language(s) relevant to proposed project\n\nForeign Language Evaluation: Applicant should not register a Foreign Language evaluator\n\nAward requirement: None, English is sufficient.

If that does not work, go to this application and it should prompt you to create your 2025-2026 application. Note: DO NOT open past and current applications in the same browser simultaneously as data will not save properly. If you must refer to an old application, download it as a PDF or open it in a different browser.\n\nSome of the basic personal information fields will automatically populate based on the information you provided last year, though you should double-check them in case any updates are needed.\n\nBe sure to carefully review the award description, as it may have been updated.\n\nYou will need to re-upload the supporting documents (Project Statement and CV, and Reference List, Syllabi/Course Outlines, and Portfolio, if applicable). We encourage you to review them as well to make sure that your materials fit your proposed project for this application cycle. Be sure to carefully review the award description, as it may have been updated.\n\nYou will need to register two recommenders and any foreign language evaluators (if applicable). Even if they have provided a recommendation or evaluation for you before, they must upload their letters to your new application. If they need a copy of the letter they uploaded last year, your reference(s) are welcome to email FulbrightScholarReview@iie.org for assistance.\n\nIf a letter of invitation is required for the award, you can submit the previous one; however, it is encouraged to submit an updated letter of invitation.\n\nTo download a PDF copy of your 2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-24, or 2024-25 application, click on the respective Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program application to open it. Then click on Preview Application Proof to open a downloadable copy of your application.\n\nIf you applied earlier than 2020, you will need to create a new application account in the Slate application system; please refer to the Instructions linked above.\n\nReview Process for U.S. Scholars\n\nIf you are a non-U.S. citizen, please review the Non-U.S (Visiting) Scholar programs.\n\nThe Fulbright Scholar Program supports activities and projects that recognize and promote the critical relationship between educational exchange and international understanding, in addition to the intellectual merit of the proposals. Applications with broad multiplier effects are particularly welcome, as are projects that are conducive to candidates sharing their experiences and knowledge with colleagues, students and, ideally, with the general public in their host country and, upon return, in the United States. To learn more, view a short video about the Review and Selection Process and the FAQ on Review and Selection.\n\nReviewers consider the basic objectives of the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program; applications are evaluated with the following criteria:\n\nTraining, background, and experience\n\nApplication demonstrates training, credentials and active professional standing in the field necessary to complete the project, as appropriate for the career stage, home institution/employer type, and teaching and administrative load (if applicable).\n\nFor applications in the creative and performing arts and journalism: Portfolio material(s) support the proposed project, technical skills, and the maturity of artistic direction.\n\nApplication demonstrates language proficiency or adequately addresses alternative(s) – if required or recommended in the award.\n\nApplication demonstrates an appropriate record of service to academic/professional community and home institution/employer.\n\nQuality of project\n\nThe project is feasible, innovative, intellectually rigorous, and well-written, with sound, appropriate methodology; the project addresses any local, political, and/or other issues that may arise.

The Bureau seeks and encourages the involvement of people from traditionally underrepresented audiences in all its grants, programs, and other activities and in its workforce and workplace. Opportunities are open to people regardless of their race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. The Bureau is committed to fairness, equity, and inclusion.\n\nSCHOLAR FAQ\n\nGeneral\n\nWhen does the competition open?\n\nThe competition opens in early February and closes in mid-September, with the exception of some of the International Education Administrator (IEA) awards. For Scholar and Postdoctoral awards, please see the detailed timeline. For IEA awards, please see the country-specific timelines. Applications are submitted for opportunities in the following academic year.\n\nHow can I start an application?\n\nApplications are submitted online, and the application portal opens with the start of the new competition in early February. Please read the application guidelines (for the IEA awards, please consult the IEA application guidelines) before beginning your application. Begin or return to your application here.\n\nWho can I contact at my institution for assistance?\n\nOver 1,400 academic institutions and professional associations across the United States have Fulbright Scholar Liaisons, a network of faculty and administrators who can guide you. We encourage you to connect with the Liaison at your institution for assistance with your application and your institution’s process for participating in the Fulbright program.\n\nCan I apply to more than one country or award?\n\nApplicants may apply only for one award per application cycle.\n\nIf I already had a Fulbright, can I receive another one?\n\nPreference for Fulbright Scholar opportunities will be given to candidates who have not previously received a Fulbright Scholar award. Recipients of a Fulbright Scholar award are eligible to apply for another Fulbright Scholar award two years after the date of completion of the previous award. This includes the higher education administrator seminars. (For flex awards, the two-year period begins at the end of the final grant portion.) Additional Fulbright policies are available here.\n\nCan I apply to the Fulbright Scholar Program if I am on the Fulbright Specialist Roster?\n\nYou are eligible to apply to the Fulbright Scholar Program while on the Fulbright Specialist roster. Recipients of a Fulbright Specialist Program grant are not required to adhere to the two-year waiting period before applying for a Fulbright Scholar grant. Likewise, recipients of a Fulbright Scholar grant are not required to adhere to the two-year waiting period before applying for or receiving a Fulbright Specialist Program grant.\n\nWhat are the financial benefits of Fulbright awards?\n\nBenefits vary by country and type of award. Generally speaking, Fulbright awards are budgeted to cover travel and living costs in-country for the grantee and their accompanying dependents. Check the award description in the Catalog of Awards and/or consult program staff responsible for the particular award you are interested in. For IEA awards, benefits vary by country but generally include round-trip travel, lodging, and a per diem that includes meals. Each award description details these benefits.\n\nWhat are the safety and security protocols in place for the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program?\n\nPlease see our safety, health and security page for more information.\n\nWhat health benefits do Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program grantees receive while on their grant?\n\nAs a U.S. government funded exchange participant, Fulbright grantees qualify to receive Accident and Sickness Program for Exchanges (ASPE), a limited health care benefit plan designed by the U.S. Department of State and administered by Seven Corners, Inc. It is not intended to cover long-term healthcare and has limitations in coverage. We encourage grantees to maintain their own private insurance.\n\nIf I am selected, can I take my family with me on my grant?\n\nThis depends on the award and host country. Most Scholar and Postdoctoral awards have no restrictions on accompanying dependents; however, some awards do have restrictions. Check the award description and/or consult the program staff responsible for that award. Many grantees bring their families and report that the time abroad benefited all family members. No additional financial benefits for dependents are awarded for the Fulbright Global Scholar Award of the Fulbright Public Policy Fellowship. For International Education Administrator seminars, no financial benefits for dependents are provided. Dependents may join before or after the seminar at the grantee’s own expense. A dependent is either (1) a spouse, or (2) a relative (child, grandchild, parent, sibling) who is financially dependent on the grantee. Accompanying dependents are those who spend at least 80% of the grant period with the grantee abroad.\n\nWho should write my reference letters?\n\nWhile it is useful to have someone with a known reputation in the field, the best person to provide a recommendation is someone who knows your work and character extensively. We also advise mixing internal and external letters to demonstrate the breadth of your contacts. You may also contact a professional reference who knows you well. For Scholar and Postdoctoral awards, one letter should be written by the head of your department or dean of your school. Please see our application guidelines for additional information.\n\nFor International Education Administrator awards, the best person to provide a recommendation is someone who knows your work and character extensively. In addition, they should be able to address the impact your participation would have on your institution and its commitment to internationalization. You may wish to mix internal and external referees. One letter must be written by your supervisor or someone to whom you report; the other one must be from a colleague and speak to your skills and successes, interest in international education, and personal qualities. Please see the IEA application guidelines for more information.\n\nHow can I secure leave and support from my home university?\n\nPlease see our leave and support page for more information.\n\nReview and Selection\n\nWho reviews applications?\n\nPeer review committees are organized by discipline and are comprised of U.S. academics and professionals with relevant expertise.\n\nFor IEA applications: U.S. international education administrators with experience in the selected country review applications.\n\nHow is my application reviewed?\n\nAll submitted applications are reviewed initially for program eligibility and technical completeness.\n\nAll complete, eligible applications are then reviewed by a peer review committee to determine whether they are recommended for further consideration by the host country (review criteria). Peer review committees are organized by discipline and are comprised of U.S. academics and professionals with relevant expertise. For IEA applications: committees are comprised of U.S. international education administrators with relevant country experience (review criteria).\n\nApplications recommended for further consideration in peer review are then forwarded to Fulbright Commissions and U.S. Embassies abroad, as well as to the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board and the Department of State (Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs) for final decisions and confirmation.\n\nHow will I be notified?\n\nAll notifications are sent via email. If your email address has changed since you submitted your application, please update your application with your new address.\n\nWhen will I be notified?\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the peer review, applicants are notified of the status of their application, recommended or not recommended.\n\nFor recommended applications: Each host country has their own in-country review timeline. At the same time, the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board (FFSB) and the Department of State also review the applications. Approvals are needed from all three (host country/countries, FFSB, Department of State) before candidates can be notified. Most U.S. Scholar applicants are informed of the decisions in the spring.\n\nWhile IIE cannot predict when a country’s outcomes will be available, applicants will be notified of the final outcome as soon as possible.\n\nPlease see the notification timeline for more details. For IEA applications: please consult the individual country timeline.\n\nI’ve submitted my application. When should I be in touch with my proposed host institution?\n\nThe Program appreciates the enthusiasm shared by applicants and host institutions to engage and collaborate on your proposed project. Please note that applications must first go through the peer review process. Those that are recommended for further consideration are then forwarded to the host country, U.S. Department of State, and the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board for review and selection. Some host countries work with host institutions in this process (typically awards where the host institution is specified in the award title). You are welcome to let your proposed host know if your application was recommended following peer review. But, to help maintain the integrity of the review process, if your application was recommended for further consideration after peer review, you are advised to not contact the host country or proposed host for updates on the status of your application.\n\nCan I receive feedback from the review process?\n\nIIE, which administers the program, operates in conformity with the policies of the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board (FFSB). According to FFSB policy, IIE cannot give applicants the specific reasons for selection or non-selection. If you are interested in reapplying, you are encouraged to contact the relevant Fulbright regional program officer, who can provide general guidance on reapplying.\n\nHow can I make my application more successful?\n\nThere is no single \"formula\" for a successful proposal. An application should be about the candidate, how the award period will be spent, and what outcomes can be reasonably expected. What is successful for one applicant may not be effective for another applicant. The responsible program officer is a good point of contact for discussions of how to shape a competitive application. Also, see our application guidelines for tips on making your application more competitive.\n\nFor IEA awards, desired professional profiles and specific qualifications vary across the awards, so you are encouraged to apply to the award that best fits your background and experience. Please see our application guidelines for information on the application components. Also, you can discuss your application and fit for the program with the staff contact listed in the award description.\n\nCan I reapply?\n\nYes. Applications are reviewed individually, on their own merit each year. While IIE cannot disclose specific reasons as to why applicants are (not) recommended or not selected, we can connect with you to help you identify an appropriate Fulbright award and to strengthen your application, including walking through the review criteria and the application guidelines. Some applicants choose to revise and strengthen their prior proposal; others opt to propose an entirely new project and/or change countries.\n\nPlease see the Application Requirements for instructions on how to reapply.\n\nTeaching/Research/Professional Project\n\nWhat type of teaching and/or research can I propose?\n\nAward descriptions indicate which type of project is acceptable. Some awards accept only teaching only research, a combination of teaching and/or research. Each activity has unique submission requirements.\n\nDo I need Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to apply to an award?\n\nIRB approval is not required at the time of application; however, applicants must abide by all ethical requirements before commencing their research on human and/or animal subjects through a Fulbright award.\n\nAre there opportunities to conduct a project during the summer?\n\nThe timeframe is indicated in each award description, and while most awards follow the academic calendar in the host country, some awards may allow projects in the summer months, especially if no teaching is involved.\n\nCan I apply to the Fulbright Scholar Program to fund MA/PhD research?\n\nThe Fulbright Scholar Program does not support research activities for obtaining an MA/PhD, however you may wish to review the opportunities provided by the Fulbright Student Program.\n\nI am a retired academic or professional. Can I still receive a Fulbright award?\n\nYes, the Fulbright Scholar Program welcomes scholars and professionals at all stages of their careers. As is required of all applicants, the project statement should address the expected benefits of the Fulbright award to you (professionally and personally), to the United States (how will you share your experience when you return?), and to your host institution.\n\nDo I have to know a foreign language?\n\nMost award recipients teach in English in the host country, with some exceptions in Latin America and Africa. If you are applying for a research award, your foreign language ability must meet the needs of the project. Be certain to indicate in your methodology discussion how you will need to use the language, since activities vary, and reviewers should not have to make assumptions.\n\nDo I need to have an invitation letter?\n\nThis depends on the award. Some countries require an invitation letter, especially for “All Disciplines” awards. Other countries encourage but do not require a letter of invitation, while others still specifically request that you do not contact potential host institutions. The preference is clearly spelled out in the award description. If you have questions, please contact the program officer responsible for that country.\n\nI need an invitation letter. How do I get one?\n\nIf you do not have a contact, your goal is to determine the name of an appropriate faculty member for a specific discipline or subfield within the discipline. Once you have determined possible hosts, write that faculty member a description of who you are (an attached C.V. can be helpful) and what you propose to do while in that country. Note that you plan to apply for a Fulbright award and that the application requires a letter of invitation. There may be several communications before a letter is forthcoming, but this method often works. It may also be helpful to contact past Fulbright alumni to your country of interest by searching the Fulbright Scholar Directory.\n\nProfessional Project\n\nWhat is the Professional Project activity?\n\nThe Professional Project activity type provides professionals and artists in various fields the opportunity to interact with relevant organizations abroad to explore a topic related to their field without answering a defined research question. Professional Projects may include: professional consultations; artist residencies; visits to organizations in the applicant's field; practical experience in day-to-day operations; public lectures; mentoring; arranging exhibitions, performances or musical compilations; preparation of print materials (books, articles, or reviews); exchange of expertise with other professionals; participation in public events; or other appropriate professional activities.\n\nWhat kinds of activities are considered Professional Projects?\n\nPermissible activities may include visits to organizations in the applicant's professional field, practical experience in day-to-day operations, public lectures, artist residencies, or other appropriate professional experiences. However, details vary according to the specific award. If you are uncertain whether your project falls under the Professional Project activity type, please contact the IIE staff member listed in the award description.\n\nHow does the Professional Project activity type differ from the Research activity type?\n\nThe Research activity type comprises traditional academic research, such as laboratory observation, field interviews, or statistical models. The Professional Project activity type, however, encompasses undertakings that fall outside traditional academic research.\n\nCan for-profit organizations serve as hosts for Professional Projects?\n\nFor-profit organizations may not serve as hosts for Professional Projects. Appropriate hosts might include a non-profit organization, artist residency, studio collective, governmental agency, museum, professional association, cultural organization, K-12 institution, university, college, language institute, research institute, laboratory, think tank or foundation. If you are uncertain whether your host is appropriate, please contact IIE staff listed in the award description.\n\nCan workshops/conferences/trainings serve as a host for Professional Projects?\n\nGenerally, no, though details about acceptable host institutions vary according to each country or award. Projects must be original and designed by the applicant, with the exception of artist residencies. If you are uncertain whether your host is appropriate, please check the award description in the Catalog of Awards or contact IIE staff.\n\nDoes a host institution need to be local, or can we partner with American organizations that work overseas?\n\nLocal organizations operated by citizens of the host country are preferred. However, in some cases, international organizations have been approved as hosts. Please check the award description in the Catalog of Awards or contact IIE staff to inquire whether your host is permissible.\n\nCan medical professionals apply for a grant under the Professional Project activity type?\n\nThe grant is meant for professionals in all fields. However, proposals for medical research involving clinical training, patient care or patient contact are not eligible. Medical professionals should propose projects that do not involve these kinds of activities. Fulbright policies do not authorize activity for which a license to practice medicine or nursing is required.\n\nInternational Education Administrator Awards\n\nDo I have to know a foreign language?\n\nNo. The awards are conducted in English.\n\nCan I propose a project of my own design for the award? Can separate briefings be arranged for me?\n\nNo. Each country arranges an itinerary of meetings, briefings, and campus visits. There is little time available for individual projects or appointments.\n\nWhere do I upload the institutional statement, and do I need a bibliography or syllabi?\n\nPlease upload the institutional statement to the online application form. A bibliography and syllabus should not be submitted.\n\nAre there new IEA awards offered every year?\n\nCurrently, we have agreements with France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and the Catalog of Awards shows what awards are currently offered along with their application deadlines."
