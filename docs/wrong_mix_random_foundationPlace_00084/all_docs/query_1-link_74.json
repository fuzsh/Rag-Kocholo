        "text": "The Country Music Association Awards 2020 went down on Wednesday, November 11, and it was, in many ways, your standard awards show. Which presents a problem, seeing as though we’re still in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nWhile preshow reports suggested the CMA Awards would follow social-distancing and mask-wearing guidelines, the actual broadcast painted a different picture. Some of the artists in attendance were photographed wearing masks, but a shocking number of them weren’t. Many were seen holding these masklike contraptions that don’t fasten to your face. You have to hold them the entire time, which seems cumbersome and ineffective.\n\nOther snaps show country’s biggest stars clinking glasses seated at tables that don’t seem that far apart. (Though maybe that “camera lens shortening distances” thing is going on? We can hope!) Again, there’s nary a mask in sight (not even on Jon Pardi, who seems to be visiting their table):\n\nIt’s standard protocol in our new normal to wear a mask when standing up and moving around in indoor spaces. However, I’m not sure celebs who went to the CMA Awards know that:\n\nSix feet apart? They don’t know her:\n\nFans called out the CMA Awards 2020 on Twitter for these oversights. “Am I the only person on here who is wondering why NOBODY in the audience socially distant of course are wearing masks at the CMA awards?!?!!” one person tweeted.\n\n“Why are the CMA awards filled with a bunch a people with NO MASKS??? It’s a global pandemic people!” added another.\n\n“CMA awards are totally ignoring COVID practices. No mask no social distancing. So irresponsible!!!” wrote a third.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe Country Music Association has not responded directly to criticisms of its social distancing practices at the awards. As a friendly reminder, though: Remember to keep your mask on in crowded spaces, remain six feet apart from people when possible, and avoid indoor gatherings, especially large ones, as much as you can. In other words, don’t do what many of the folks at the CMA Awards just did. Insert side-eye emoji here."
