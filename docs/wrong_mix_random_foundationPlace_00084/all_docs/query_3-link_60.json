        "text": "2024 Rules & Regulations\n\nOnly those programs that have been approved for participation by the NHSMTA are recognized as official Regional Awards Programs of the Jimmy Awards®. Click here for Participation Guidelines for more information.\n\nEach Regional Awards Program (RAP) of the Jimmy Awards ® must adhere to the following Rules & Regulations in order to participate in the 2024 Jimmy Awards®/ National High School Musical Theatre Awards®(NHSMTA®).\n\nGeneral\n\nThe RAP is sponsored by a legitimate professional theatre/company that is a member in good standing of The Broadway League.\n\nThe sponsoring legitimate professional theatre/company that is a member of The Broadway League has sponsored only one (1) RAP this year (unless an exception is approved by the NHSMTA Advisory Board).\n\nEvery participating program must pay the participation fee in full, and the payment must be made by the League member sponsoring organization.\n\nNew Regional Awards Programs may send Nominees to New York in the first year of their program, if they so choose.\n\nIn addition to the non-refundable participation fee, the RAP is also responsible for funding round-trip travel to New York City for its two Nominees (and Chaperone, if applicable). NHSMTA will arrange and pay for Nominees’ expenses in New York City including housing, meals, and other necessary expenses for the duration of the program. Any expenses incurred outside of the scheduled program dates will be the responsibility of the RAP.\n\nThe RAP must adhere to and comply with all Press Guidelines as outlined by the NHSMTA.\n\nThe Jimmy Awards encourages diversity regionally whenever possible, including connecting to schools that may not have the budget to produce full-length musicals. We also encourage RAPs to select adjudicators, presenters, and guest performers from BIPOC and historically excluded communities. For additional resources, please see the below section titled “RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCREASE INCLUSION AMONGST REGIONAL PARTICIPANTS.”\n\nNominee Selection Process\n\nThe RAP is expected to adjudicate student performances through a full-scale Awards Program Model based on a Tony Awards ® model (for reference please refer to similar programs such as Gene Kelly Awards, The Blumey Awards, or the Iowa High School Musical Theater Awards).\n\nThe RAP sends qualified judges to review high school musical theatre productions presented by individual schools during the 2023-24 school year. All aspects of shows, such as acting, choreography, and design, etc. are judged on performance and production quality. To be considered for Jimmy Awards nomination, a student must perform a Qualifying Role in an Approved Musical in a full-length high school production that took place during the 2023-24 school year.\n\nAll Regional Awards Programs must present awards at a full-scale public event in which nominees perform/participate in solo and group musical numbers for a live in-person audience of no fewer than 100 attendees (not including participants). While new Regional Awards Programs may choose to present a smaller culminating event for their first year, they are required to present a full-scale public event by the second full year of participation in the Jimmy Awards/National High School Musical Theatre Awards.\n\nAt or before this event, RAPs must select two (2) nominees to participate in the Jimmy Awards. One student is announced as the Jimmy Awards Best Actress Nominee, and one student is announced as the Jimmy Awards Best Actor Nominee.\n\nNominees for Best Performance by an Actor and Best Performance by an Actress are chosen based on the results of the adjudication of their performance of a Qualifying Role in an Approved Musical in a full-length high school production that took place during the 2023-24 school year.\n\nFor the purpose of NHSMTA, qualifying roles will be defined per the list found here . Approved RAPs may appeal roles and musicals that are not on the current list for inclusion. School editions/versions of musicals are permitted; “junior” versions are not. Junior versions are usually referred to as: G2K (Getting to Know Series), Young @ Part, Middle School Editions (from 101 School Editions), Broadway Jr., and Young Performers. Concert versions are not permitted.\n\nAll nominees must meet any additional criteria and comply with all regulations as designated by the individual Regional Awards Program’s policies for the 2023-24 season in order to be eligible as a Jimmy Awards Nominee.\n\nRegional Awards Programs must provide the following information for their two participating Nominees by June 1st , regardless of culminating program event/ceremony date:\n\nName (first and last)\n\nHigh School\n\nQualifying Show and Role\n\nColor Headshot\n\nRegional Awards Programs must ensure that their two participating Nominees have been informed of their nominations by June 1st.\n\nRegional Awards Programs must ensure that their two participating Nominees have been announced to the public no later than one (1) week prior to the start date of the NHSMTA week in NYC.\n\nNominee Requirements\n\nOnly those students who have been selected and designated by an official Regional Awards Programs of the Jimmy Awards® are recognized as official Jimmy Award Nominees.

Those Nominees that continue to be eligible for Finalist and Best Performance scholarships will participate in a second live Adjudication prior to the public Jimmy Awards ceremony.\n\nNominees must understand and agree to all possible videotaping, televised opportunities, photos, press interviews, and print advertising. Waivers are provided in the Nominee Information Packet.\n\nOnce a Nominee has won the Jimmy Award for Best Performance by an Actor or Best Performance by an Actress, they may not return in subsequent years to participate as a Nominee at the Jimmy Awards in New York City.\n\nNominees must abide by any health and safety protocols implemented by either The Juilliard School or the NHSMTA.\n\nDocumentation and Materials\n\nOnce accepted to participate in the NHSMTA Program, the RAP is required to submit the following necessary documentation in digital form.
