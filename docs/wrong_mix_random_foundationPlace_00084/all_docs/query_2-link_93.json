        "text": "The mission of The Nature Conservancy is to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends.\n\nHow do we achieve this mission?\n\nThe Nature Conservancy is working to boldly address the biodiversity and climate crises this decade. We must make a lasting difference by 2030 so people and the planet can have a brighter future. TNC has a long history of protecting lands, rivers, lakes and oceans through projects on the ground. We also collaborate with partner organizations in the field and with governments and other influencers to inform policy decisions and direct public funding to further our mission. The list of countries in which we work reflects the diverse ways in which we impact conservation around the world.\n\nThatâ€™s how The Nature Conservancy has done more than anyone else to advance conservation around the world since our founding in 1951.\n\nDue to limited resources and an overwhelming level of interest, we are no longer issuing photographer's guidelines and are unable to accept unsolicited photography submissions. This includes Nature Conservancy magazine as well as other Conservancy publications.\n\nThe only unsolicited materials we can accept are emails featuring a link to your personal web site or online portfolio. Please send such emails to photo@tnc.org, and include a list of any Nature Conservancy areas that you have already photographed. We will review these links on a periodic basis and will contact you if your work matches our project needs. Please do not send unsolicited emails with attachments.\n\nFeel free to contact The Nature Conservancy's local, state and country offices in areas where you have photographed and/or may be planning to visit. These individual offices may have photo acquisition needs, contests, products, etc., which may be of interest to you.\n\nYou are always welcome to designate your donation to the area or project of your choice. Simply send us a note with your donation by mail, letting us know where you would like your donation to be used. We will make sure it is allocated to the right project, and send you an acknowledgement to that effect.\n\nIf you are donating by phone, just tell the Member Care Professional who takes your donation that you would like to earmark it for a particular project.\n\nYou can also donate online. Please note that donations using that form do not renew memberships, and that allocation is limited to states or countries rather than individual projects.\n\nBecause the Address Verification System is an automated system that relies on the exact match up of address data, records that are entered in different formats can sometimes interfere with credit card processing. For example, some companies do not follow a standard procedure for entering P.O. Box numbers, so online donors with P.O. addresses are more likely to experience problems. If you reverse the format of the address line (e.g., enter in the address 1234 P.O. Box rather than P.O. Box 1234), you may be able to resolve the problem. Donors with international addresses may also run into authentication issues.\n\nIf you run into difficulties with the online form, the Conservancy's Member Care Team can always process your credit card donation over the phone or by mail. Please call us toll-free at (800) 628-6860 for assistance and more information.\n\nYes, you can. By joining our Conservation Champions program, you can have your regular, automated donations applied to our special membership program and receive fewer mailings each year. You will receive a pledge statement at the beginning of each month to help you keep track of how your gifts are helping conservation around the world.\n\nAsk your bill-pay service to send your donations to The Nature Conservancy, Attn: Treasury; 4245 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 100; Arlington, VA 22203-1606, and include your membership number. Let us know when you start making donations this way and we will be sure to apply the Monthly Giving indicator on your membership record.\n\nIn addition to checking accounts, the Conservation Champions program accepts Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, and your financial information will always be kept confidential.\n\nIf you are not a member of The Nature Conservancy, and you are receiving invitations to join, it's likely that another organization has shared your name and address with us. If you would like to be removed from our mailing list, please call our Member Care Center at 1(800) 628-6860 or email us.\n\nWe will need the following information in order to make sure you are removed from the list:\n\nYour name and address exactly as they appear on the mailing\n\nThe mailing code, which begins with the letters AHOMQ. (In some cases, that code can help us pinpoint where we received the name.)\n\nPlease note that because many of our mailings are prepared in advance, it might take some time before the change takes full effect. We appreciate your patience and will do everything we can to expedite the process.\n\nIf you are a member and would like to cancel your membership with The Nature Conservancy, please call our Member Care Center at 1(800) 628-6860, or email us. Please let us know why you would like to cancel, as it can help us improve the membership experience for our donors.\n\nIf you would simply like to receive less mail, we will be happy to tailor your membership to your wishes. Your Member Care representative can discuss the options with you.\n\nWe can also stop the magazine from being sent if you would prefer not to receive it.\n\nJust let us know what suits you best, and we will take care of it right away.\n\nWe try to avoid creating duplicate memberships whenever possible, but it happens every now and then. Duplicate memberships can be created for many reasons, including:\n\nDonation with change of name\n\nDonation with change of address\n\nSpouses making donations separately\n\nIf you are receiving two copies of our mailings (particularly the magazine), please let us know as soon as possible either by phone (800-628-6860) or via email. We can merge your duplicate memberships permanently in our system, resulting in just one record that contains your entire history with The Nature Conservancy.\n\nTo merge your memberships, we will need the following information:\n\nName(s)\n\nAddress(es)\n\nMembership numbers (if possible)\n\nPreferred information (how you would like the membership to be addressed)\n\nBecause many mailings are prepared several weeks in advance, it may take a few weeks before the update of your membership is fully implemented. In the meantime, consider passing the extra information along to others who might be interested.\n\nIf you have recently joined The Nature Conservancy but are still receiving invitations, please allow a few weeks for the original list to be updated and your name removed from further invitations.\n\nAlthough we make every effort to avoid duplications, this cross-checking of potential membership lists is not always fool-proof. Any variation in name or address could prevent us from identifying the duplicate record.\n\nIf you are a member and receive another invitation to join The Nature Conservancy, please indicate this on the membership application that has your name and address on it and return it in the envelope provided.\n\nIf you have recently joined the Conservancy, the invitations to join are from the same list to which you first responded; please allow a few weeks for the list to be updated and your name removed from further invitations to join.\n\nYou can also call the Member Care Center toll-free at 1-800-628-6860, or email us. Please allow 6 - 8 weeks for the corrections to be implemented.\n\nOur primary focus has always been to protect the entire spectrum of native biological diversity. In North America, hunting and fishing are only permitted on a Conservancy preserve in instances where these activities are compatible with achieving the siteâ€™s written conservation goals.\n\nThe most common reason for allowing hunting and/or fishing on Conservancy preserves is to maintain or restore the integrity of sensitive species and biological communities. Another common reason the Conservancy allows hunting and/or fishing on some of our preserves is to respect the practices and cultural traditions of human communities. In some situations, we are motivated to open a preserve to hunting for both reasons: ecological and cultural. We do not permit hunting on those lands we own and manage where hunting may generate collateral threats, or detract from our ability to achieve our conservation goals.\n\nFor more information, please refer to this Conservancy fact sheet on hunting and fishing in North America.\n\nIf you would like to know whether hunting or fishing is allowed on a particular preserve, please contact the chapter office in the state in which the preserve is located.\n\nThis web site, nature.org, is owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy. Our intention is to provide an informative tool for those interested in conservation and as a means of allowing our members and the public to become more involved in our mission.
