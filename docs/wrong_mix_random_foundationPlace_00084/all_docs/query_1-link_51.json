        "text": "CREATING BALANCE\n\nThe cornerstone of Springfield College is our Humanics philosophy—to educate the whole person in spirit, mind, and body for leadership in service to others. It informs everything we do.\n\nThrough that mission, we instill the ideal of giving back—in many forms—whether within our own College community or helping our local community. Our students, who perform more than 120,000 hours of community service annually, learn from their volunteerism and other acts of kindness.\n\nSUCCESS IS IN YOUR FUTURE\n\nOur job is to prepare you to excel in your field and make your mark in the world. Your success is our success. Our 2022-23 post-graduate career outcomes speak for themselves: 98% of Springfield College graduates report successful career outcomes.\n\nEXCELLENCE IN THE CLASSROOM\n\nWe are proud of our students and their academic achievements. Take our student-athletes from the 2023-24 academic year. The Pride's nearly 650 student-athletes earned a 3.533 GPA that spring, which is the highest in-person GPA ever achieved.\n\nFIND WHAT MOVES YOU\n\nStudents with their eye on the prize will love our dual degree option programs, which allow students to earn multiple degrees at an accelerated pace.\n\nBS in Health Science: Pre-Occupational Therapy and MSOT or OTD in five-and-a-half years to six years\n\nBS in Exercise Science to MS in Athletic Training in five years\n\nBS in Health Science: Pre-Physician Assistant Studies to MS in Physician Assistant Studies in six years\n\nBS in Health Science: Pre-Physical Therapy to Doctor of Physical Therapy studies in six years\n\nMaster of Business Administration 4+1 program, which offers a bachelor’s degree and MBA in five years\n\nBachelor's Degree Plus Law School Earn both your bachelor’s and law degrees in six years through our 3+3 Law Program\n\nEXPERIENTIAL LEARNING: LEVEL UP\n\nWe are big believers in the concept of learning by doing. Our students jump into their programs and start experiential learning as early as year one. That allows them to put theory into practice. The best part about our “early and often” philosophy? You will have experience on your resume before you even graduate.\n\n\"Because of the experience I gained working as a student leader, it helped me have the confidence to transition into what I am doing now. I have come full circle, having worked the Hoophall as a student, and now being a part of the event in my professional career. I owe my professional growth to Springfield College because this event led me to what I am enjoying as a professional now.\" - Jeremy Therrien '21\n\nELEVATING INCLUSIVENESS\n\nAt Springfield College, we lead with an open mind and an open heart. We embrace inclusivity. The College offers a dozen diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) clubs and more than 60 annual DEI programs. Leading these inclusion efforts on campus are members of the Division of Inclusion and Community Engagement and the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. They aim to support and cultivate a campus climate that is inclusive, student-centered, and safe.\n\nGET IN ON TRADITION\n\nSince 1885, Springfield College has had a lot of opportunities to create traditions. Whether it’s first-year students wearing beanies when they begin their journey to Stepping Up Day to Homecoming to Outdoor Pursuits—and much more—such rich traditions strengthen our bonds as a campus community.\n\nADVANCING CONNECTIONS\n\nWith more than 52,000 living Springfield College alumni, our students have opportunities to learn from those who came before them to gain insight and advice about life after college. The Career Center connects students with our alumni who are looking for internship and job opportunities. The College also hosts an annual event on campus for students to network with invited alumni."
