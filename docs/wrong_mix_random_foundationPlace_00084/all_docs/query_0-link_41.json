In the first session IAASB Chair Tom Seidenstein, IAASB Member and Less Complex Entities (LCE) Task Force Chair Kai Morten Hagen, and IAASB Deputy Director Beverley Bahlmann will address the journey to the proposed new standard, its key principles, how it compares to the existing suite of International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and why it is important for stakeholders. The first discussion will livestream on LinkedIn on September 28 at 8 am ET.\n\nThe second livestream discussion will follow on October 20 at 8 am with IAASB Technical Director Willie Botha, IAASB Member Chun-Wee Chiew and IAASB Consultative Advisory Group Member Claes Norberg addressing on which entities the proposed standard can be used, who makes decisions regarding using the standard, and how those decisions are made. IAASB Technical Advisor and LCE Task Force Member Viviene Bauer will moderate the discussion.\n\nThe third and final livestream in this series will air on November 17 at 8 am. It will feature IAASB Member Julie Corden, LCE Reference Group Member Andrew Braithwaite, and IAASB LCE Task Force Member Brendan Murtagh discussing what the proposed new standard means for audit firms and practitioners, including the benefits of the standard, what firms and engagement teams need to consider in decision making, and the potential impact on small- and medium-sized practices."
