        "text": "Updated COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available to protect against new variants for this fall and winter season. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention recommends everyone over 6 months should get one dose of an updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nMixing and matching any of the vaccines is okay, so there’s no need to look for any specific brand when it’s time to get the annual update.\n\nIndividuals who have existing medical problems, are over the age of 65 or are immunocompromised may qualify for doses in between the annual fall updates. Your doctor will be able to advise you on when to get your additional immunizations.\n\nCOVID-19 is here to stay, and new variants will pop up with time. Like the flu shot, the CDC expects we will need an updated annual COVID-19 vaccine that targets new variants yearly.\n\nAm I eligible for an updated dose of the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe CDC recommends everyone ages 6 months and up receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine – just like the flu shot. Whether you’re someone who’s healthy or you’re someone who’s immunocompromised, seasonal COVID-19 vaccines will provide additional immune system support. Staying up to date with your vaccination is your best protection to avoid severe illness, hospitalization and even death.\n\nAs an infectious diseases specialist and hospital epidemiologist at the University of Chicago Medicine, it’s critical that people get their annual influenza and COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat are the side effects of the new COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nSide effects from the updated vaccine tend to be mild, and many people experience no side effects at all. Similarly to the flu shot, typical side effects of the COVID vaccine include:\n\nHeadache\n\nSoreness at the site of vaccination\n\nLow fever\n\nChills\n\nFeeling tired\n\nIs an updated vaccine the same thing as a booster dose?\n\nAn additional dose is the same as a booster.\n\nDoes my updated vaccine need to be the same brand as my initial vaccine?\n\nMixing and matching any of the vaccines is okay, so there’s no need to look for any specific brand when it’s time to get the seasonal update.\n\nI’ve already had three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Do I need another one?\n\nYes. Regardless of the number of previous doses you’ve received, the current recommendation is that everyone aged 6 months and older get an annual COVID-19 vaccine. These are now typically given in the fall.\n\nIf I am immunocompromised, will I be fully protected after I get my vaccine?\n\nIt depends. If you are immunocompromised, the COVID-19 vaccine is supposed to provide you with better protection from COVID-19, but it may not provide you with the same level of immunity as healthy people. That means you should still take extra precautions to avoid getting COVID-19, such as wearing a mask (especially inside) and avoiding large crowds or high-risk activities. If you do get COVID-19, you should talk to your doctor right away about getting prescription antiviral medication, even if your symptoms are mild.\n\nDiscuss your ongoing risk with your healthcare provider and ask them how to reduce your risk. You may qualify for doses in between your annual vaccination.\n\nCan children get an updated dose?\n\nThe CDC recommends everyone aged 6 months and up get the updated COVID-19 shot. For most people, immunity has waned, and new variants are circling around communities in the fall and winter seasons. Staying current on vaccination means fewer days of school missed and reduces the spread of COVID. The majority of kids who are hospitalized for COVID-19 have not been vaccinated. Staying up to date on vaccination makes kids more likely to have a mild case of COVID – or not have it all – if exposed to the virus.\n\nCan I get the COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot at the same time?\n\nIt’s okay to schedule your updated annual COVID-19 vaccine together with the annual flu shot. You might have a little soreness in both arms, and there’s a slightly higher chance of feeling fatigue and a low fever from both shots together. But convenience outweighs the risk for most people.\n\nIf I qualify for the RSV vaccine, can I get it at the same time as my COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot?\n\nCurrent recommendations say you can get all three vaccines at the same time. However, if you typically have side effects from vaccines, you may want to space these out one to two weeks apart.\n\nWill more people keep needing additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nIt’s almost certain that most people will need to get annual shots for COVID-19, just like the flu shot. Data show that staying updated on vaccination protects people, particularly against new variants. If you haven’t gotten your updated vaccine yet — or been vaccinated at all — you should get yours right away.\n\nCan I get the updated vaccine if I recently had COVID-19?\n\nIf you recently had COVID-19, you still need to get the annual shot to stay up to date on vaccination. However, you may want to delay getting vaccinated for three months after the start of symptoms or a positive test.\n\nDo not get vaccinated while you are symptomatic or tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nDo I have to pay for the vaccine?\n\nYour insurance, Medicare or Medicaid covers vaccination. The CDC temporarily provides vaccination coverage through December 2024 for those who aren’t insured or underinsured through the Bridge Access program.\n\nCheck with your provider to verify any fees."
