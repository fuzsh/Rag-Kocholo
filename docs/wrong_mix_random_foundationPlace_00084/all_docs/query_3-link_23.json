        "text": "UNSW is committed to student equity, and we want to ensure that as many young people as possible can access and succeed in higher education. The Gateway Admission Pathway is UNSW’s primary pathway for students who are traditionally underrepresented at UNSW and in higher education more broadly.\n\nDegrees offered at the UNSW Canberra City campus through the Canberra School of Professional Studies are eligible for the Gateway Admission Pathway. This includes the Bachelor of Cyber Security.\n\nPlease note: Programs offered through UNSW Canberra at ADFA are not eligible for the Gateway Admission Pathway.\n\nTo be eligible for the Gateway Admission Pathway, you must:\n\nbe an Australian Permanent Resident, Australian Citizen, or New Zealand Citizen\n\nbe completing an Australian Year 12 qualification in the year of application\n\nattend a Gateway school or live in a low-socioeconomic area based on SEIFA criteria*.\n\nIf you’re unsure whether you meet these criteria, contact us.\n\nIf you meet these criteria but are in Year 10 or 11, you are able to participate in the UNSW Gateway Program. This program is for students who want to discover UNSW degree options, explore future career opportunities and access additional resources for the HSC.\n\n* Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) ranks areas in Australia according to relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage based on the Index of Education and Occupation and Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage and Disadvantage.\n\nGateway schools are identified by taking the three-year average of Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) for schools across NSW or the three-year average of the proportion of students in the bottom SEA quartile. The ICSEA and proportion of students in the bottom SEA quartile of a school can be found on the My School website.\n\nYou will need to upload a personal statement answering the following three questions. If you have chosen two degrees to be considered for in your application, you only need to address the degree you have listed as your first preference.\n\nWhy are you interested in the degree you are applying for and how does it relate to your passions and goals?\n\nWhat are your learning strengths and how have you applied them to overcome challenges in school or other aspects of your life?\n\nThinking about your future self at university, what do you identify as the key challenges for you and how do you plan to manage these?\n\nYou can choose up to two UNSW degrees to be assessed on. However, only preference two degrees if you would be happy to receive an offer for either of those degrees. When writing your personal statement, you should reference the degree you have listed as your first preference.\n\nPlease note whilst you can preference up to two degrees, you can only receive one offer to UNSW through the Gateway Admission Pathway.\n\nYour personal statement is a very important part of how we assess your application. Here are the key qualities we are looking for in your personal statement:\n\nA high degree of clarity\n\nAddress all aspects of the questions\n\nReference relevant concrete examples to illustrate sophisticated links between personal interests and chosen discipline\n\nDemonstrate in-depth knowledge of your chosen degree and its requirements\n\nExtensive and detailed evidence of reflective thinking and analysis of own learning strengths\n\nThoughtfully describe potential challenges and solutions for your projected future self\n\nA well-integrated, complex and thoughtfully structured paragraph\n\nSophisticated use of persuasive written language\n\nCheck out our Nail It! app designed specifically to help you write your personal statement.\n\nIf you live in an eligible low-socioeconomic area, receive an offer from UNSW and enrol for Term 1, 2025, you will be eligible to receive the $10,000 UNSW Advantage Award to support you in your first year of studies. Low-socioeconomic areas are based on 2021 IRSAD and IEO indexes of SEIFA criteria.\n\nAdditionally, for 2025, all students who attend a Gateway school, apply through the Gateway Admission Pathway and enrol at UNSW will receive a $1,000 one-off payment to make the transition to uni easier, meaning you could be eligible for a total of an $11,000 award to make the most of your studies.\n\nIf you have applied to UNSW through the Gateway Admission Pathway, you will be advised if you’re eligible to receive the UNSW Advantage Award when Round 1 and Round 2 early offers and early conditional offers are released. Round 1 offers will be released on Thursday, 5 September 2024. Round 2 offers will be released on Friday, 6 December 2024.\n\nThe award will be paid in $2,500 instalments in your first year of university. The first instalment will be at the beginning of Term 1 and other payments will be within 4 weeks of the Term 1 Census Date, Term 2 Census Date and Term 3 Census Date.\n\nStudents who attended a Gateway school will also receive a $1,000 one off payment at the beginning of Term 1, 2025.\n\nTo be eligible for the UNSW Gateway Award applicants must have applied through the Gateway Admission Pathway and enrolled at UNSW. You will be advised if you’re eligible to receive this award when Round 1 and Round 2 early offers and early conditional offers are released. Round 1 offers will be released on Thursday, 5 September 2024. Round 2 offers will be released on Friday, 6 December 2024.\n\nStudents are not able to defer commencement of the UNSW Advantage Award or the UNSW Gateway Award.\n\nHowever, you can reapply through the UAC Equity Scholarships portal to be considered for any Equity scholarships available. Please keep in mind there is no guarantee that you will receive an Equity Scholarship offer in a future round.\n\nYes, your eligibility will be determined as part of the regular UAC admissions process which happens throughout December and January. You will be advised if you are eligible to receive the UNSW Advantage Award in early 2025 before the start of Term 1.\n\nYes, if you receive the UNSW Advantage Award and/or the UNSW Gateway Award, you are still eligible for equity and merit scholarships at UNSW. Please check UNSW Scholarships for any scholarship opportunities available that are relevant to your studies.\n\nHowever, in most cases, you won’t be able to hold both your UNSW Advantage/Gateway Award as well as an equity or merit scholarship. Recipients who are considering accepting or holding multiple Scholarships/Awards must contact UNSW Scholarships in writing for prior approval.\n\nIf you receive an equity or merit scholarship offer (including accommodation scholarships) in addition to being eligible for the UNSW Advantage/Gateway Awards, you will have the option to choose which scholarship/award you would like to hold.\n\nThe Community Plus Scholarship covers on-campus accommodation expenses of up to $25,000 per year throughout your undergraduate journey. If you apply to study at UNSW through the Gateway Admission Pathway and you’re looking to move onto campus, you will be prioritised for this award. Note that there are a limited number of these scholarships available.\n\nUNSW offers a wide range of Equity Scholarships to assist commencing students to undertake full-time study for the standard duration of their coursework degree program.\n\nIf you apply through the Gateway Admission Pathway, you will automatically be considered on the basis of school disadvantage and socio-economic disadvantage of the area you live in. You don't need to submit a UAC Equity Scholarship application to be considered on the basis of these factors. You will automatically be considered for all relevant Equity Scholarships. However, if you’d like to be considered additionally on the basis of any of the below factors, you can also submit an Educational Access Scheme application through UAC.\n\nFinancial Challenges\n\nSevere Family Disruption\n\nExcessive Family Responsibilities\n\nPersonal Illness/Disability\n\nRefugee and Humanitarian Status\n\nThe UNSW Co-op Program is a career development scholarship for high potential undergraduate students for selected undergraduate students in the disciplines of Business, Engineering, and Science. Co-op provides 15-18 months of industry training, professional development, networking and financial support ($21,600 p.a./4 years).\n\nThe Co-op Program requires an adjusted minimum ATAR of 90 (incl. EAS) for students from Gateway schools or low SES backgrounds. Up to 4 dedicated places each year are available through the Gateway scheme each year.\n\nApplications for the Co-op Program Gateway places are through a separate application process from the main Gateway Admission Pathway. To apply, head to the Co-op website.\n\nApplications are open now, and close on Monday, 30 September 2024.\n\nATAR adjustments consider additional factors when assessing a student’s capability to succeed at university. As part of UNSW's Gateway Admission Pathway, we consider the academic course requirements and the demonstrated academic standard of applicants. We then consider the Lowest Selection Rank and determine a reasonable adjustment for each degree. See our list of Gateway Adjusted ATARs for students enrolling in 2025.\n\nThrough the Gateway Admission Pathway, there are several degrees that have an adjusted ATAR of 65. See our list of Gateway Adjusted ATARs for students enrolling in 2025.\n\nIf you don't qualify for the UNSW Gateway Admission Pathway you may still be eligible to study a UNSW College Diploma program as an alternative entry pathway to UNSW. For more information, download the Diploma flyer.\n\nThere are no implications. Your ATAR is only one indicator of your capacity to succeed at university, which is why we are considering other factors when assessing your application. You won’t be at a disadvantage compared to your peers."
