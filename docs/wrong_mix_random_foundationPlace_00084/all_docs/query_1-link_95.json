        "text": "They did so, however, with a yellow tape measure between them.\n\nAs seen in red-carpet photos, Edgar-Jones couldn't help but laugh while holding the tape measure.\n\nStill, keeping a safe distance from others is crucial during this time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, you should stand at least 6 feet away from people \"who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.\" In doing so, you can avoid coming into contact with infected droplets from coughs, sneezes, and talking, according to the CDC.\n\nThe costars eventually ditched the tape measure, but still stood far away from each other while posing for photos.\n\nThe resulting images look drastically different than standard red-carpet photos, in which celebrities are often seen hugging and standing side by side.\n\nDespite the social-distancing measures in place, both Mescal and Edgar-Jones were able to make fashion statements on the red carpet. On Instagram, Mescal credited Dior and Cartier with his formal-meets-casual look, which included a gray suit paired with white sneakers and a matching T-shirt.\n\nEdgar-Jones, on the other hand, looked stunning in a sleeveless Miu Miu dress with a bedazzled top and scalloped, ankle-length skirt. She also donned a $1,450 pair of Jimmy Choo heels, which were black with a rhinestone, bow strap.\n\nOn Instagram, Edgar-Jones thanked Hourglass Cosmetics for creating her red-carpet beauty look, and said it felt \"so lovely to wear something other than slippers.\"\n\nOther celebrities at the awards event took additional measures to ensure their safety. Actor Adrian Lester, for example, wore a blue mask when arriving at the Television Centre.\n\nOthers, including comedian Aisling Bea, comedian Richard Ayoade, and TV presenter Stacey Dooley, posed alone on the red carpet."
