        "text": "Anne Anderson and her family were some of the first guests to arrive at the James Pond Preserve beach on Wednesday morning. Her son, August, tromped down the steps to the shore ahead of her with a fistful of wildflowers.\n\n“Oh man, it’s amazing,” Ms. Anderson said, looking toward the clear blue water. “We’ve been here a couple times this week already.”\n\nThis summer is the first that James Pond Preserve, a Martha’s Vineyard Land Bank property, is open for public use. The 13-acre expanse includes a half-mile trail loop, pond access, ample vegetation and access to 650 feet of white sand beach flanking Lambert’s Cove. Anyone can walk onto the property, but visitors hoping to park a vehicle must register for a time slot on the land bank’s website.\n\nThe preserve first opened in February after a lengthy state review process.\n\nLand bank superintendent Harrison Kisiel spends his days maintaining the land bank’s 100-plus miles of walking trails on the Island. He said he has put great care into making James Pond Preserve a pleasant recreation destination.\n\n“That’s always a goal: to not make people feel like they’re on a [preservation],” he said. “You want to try to give it as much of a natural feel as possible.”\n\nThe James Pond Preserve was formerly occupied by four private residential properties, including the Peltz family mansion fronting James Pond and Vineyard Sound. Upon acquiring the properties in 2020 and 2021 for a total of $12.2 million, the land bank demolished two homes and restored the remaining two, which now house Land Bank employees.\n\nThe land bank’s team of ecologists are working hard to nurture biodiversity in the area.\n\nUntil recently, the sprawling acreage consisted mostly of private lawns.\n\nLand bank head ecologist Julie Russell has led the charge in rebuilding the ecosystem from the ground up. Her team recently brought in the land bank’s goat herd to nibble down oak sprouts to make way for other flora.\n\n“We’d like to see some more diversity in goldenrods, asters, different grasses, some different sedges,” Ms. Russell said. “All of that will support different moths and butterflies.”\n\nThe land bank team is equally concerned with making the preserve a peaceful spot that anyone can enjoy.\n\nThe preserve is outfitted with a number of accessibility features. An ADA-compliant trail connects the parking lot to a ramped platform on a hill, where visitors can relax on a bench with a clear view of the pond. The path to the beach is lined with Mobi-Mats, the large sheets of woven material that promote easy beach access while minimizing disruption to dunes.\n\nAn adjustable aluminum stair system leads down onto the beach. The entire structure is collapsable, which means it can adapt to a changing shoreline.\n\nMr. Kisiel said the James Pond project encapsulates the land bank’s mission to blend leisure and environmental advocacy — an ethos that he said sets it apart from other conservation groups on the island.\n\n“The land bank’s goal is ultimately twofold: it’s conservation and recreation,” he said.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges to beachfront access at the preservation was how best to navigate its proximity to Lambert’s Cove. After working with the town, the Land Bank decided not to allow beachgoers to travel in between the beaches so that staff can more easily keep track of guests. The land bank has also tailored many of its own regulations to those at Lambert’s Cove, including rules for mooring boats.\n\n“We did the best we could to anticipate as much as we could, and that included meeting with neighbors, meeting with the town, hearing what they all think could be issues [and] doing what we can to get ahead of it,” he said.\n\nWith James Pond complete and open to the public, Mr. Kisiel said that the land bank’s sights are set on its Squibnocket Pond property in Aquinnah, co-owned by Sheriff’s Meadow and formerly owned by the Kennedy family. He said they hope to open it within a year.\n\nFor now, he hopes that people take advantage of James Pond as a newly public resource.\n\n“We’re happy to have it open to the public so people can very much be enjoying it,” he said. “Really, that’s our main goal.”"
