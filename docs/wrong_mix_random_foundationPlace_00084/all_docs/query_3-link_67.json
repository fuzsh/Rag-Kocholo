Hinton's landmark novel got the musical treatment this season, bringing the story of teenage gangs finding brotherhood, hope, and support in each other — however imperfectly — to a new generation.\n\nGet The Outsiders tickets now.\n\nLempicka\n\nPolish painter Tamara de Lempicka blazed a trail for future female artists, challenging social norms in Parisian high society and soon becoming one of the most sought-after Art Deco painters of her day. Eden Espinosa plays the title role, opposite Beth Leavel and Amber Iman, in this musical about Lempicka's fascinating life.\n\nSuffs\n\nShaina Taub's musical about the flawed yet formidable faces of the women's suffrage movement marched onto Broadway this season. Taub stars in her own show — making her the second solo female creator to ever do so on Broadway — as Alice Paul.\n\nGet Suffs tickets now.\n\nHell's Kitchen\n\nAlicia Keys's catalog of hits drives this musical love letter to the neighborhood where she grew up. Hell's Kitchen tells the story of young Ali, inspired by Keys, who finds love, music, and herself as she comes of age in a vibrant artistic community.\n\nGet Hell's Kitchen tickets now.\n\nThe Heart of Rock and Roll\n\nIt's hip to be square at this musical featuring the songs of Huey Lewis and the News. The Heart of Rock and Roll is a musical rom-com about a bandleader-turned-corporate worker and his ambitious boss, who help each other take a second shot at their wildest dreams.\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nThe Great Gatsby is a musical now, old sport! Jeremy Jordan plays the mysterious title billionaire opposite Eva Noblezada as his elusive love, Daisy, in this jazz-pop stage version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic book.\n\nGet The Great Gatsby tickets now.\n\nIllinoise\n\nIllinoise is adapted from Sufjan Stevens's 2005 album Illinois, a musical portrait of the state that includes themes of queerness, self-discovery, UFOS, zombies, and more.

Here are all the contenders for Best Play in 2024.\n\nGrey House\n\nLevi Holloway's horror play starred Laurie Metcalf as the den mother of a house of eccentric young girls. When a couple seeks shelter in their mountain cabin, they learn their hosts aren't all they seem.\n\nThe Cottage\n\nInspired by classic farces of the 1920s and '30s, The Cottage follows a group of couples who all come together under one roof. Drama erupts when they learn they've all been cheating on each other with each other.\n\nThe Shark Is Broken\n\nDuring the filming of Jaws, lead actors Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Roy Scheider famously feuded while stuck on a boat for hours between takes. Shaw's son co-wrote and starred in this imagining of what happened when the men bared their teeth.\n\nJaja’s African Hair Braiding\n\nThe Broadway-debut play from Jocelyn Bioh takes place at the title Harlem hair salon, where a group of customers and braiders confront their alliances, romances, and futures during one sweltering summer day.\n\nI Need That\n\nDanny DeVito led this Theresa Rebeck play as a reclusive hoarder who needs to clean up his act — literally. DeVito's real-life daughter played his onstage daughter, who helps him sort between the trash and the treasure.\n\nPrayer for the French Republic\n\nAfter winning multiple Off-Broadway awards in 2022, Prayer for the French Republic made its Broadway debut with the story of a French Jewish family wondering for their safety. Family members in the 1940s and the 2010s ask themselves the same thorny questions decades apart.\n\nStereophonic\n\nAudiences get an exclusive look inside the recording studio in this play about a '70s band on the cusp of their big break — if infighting doesn't cause their breakup first. Arcade Fire's Will Butler penned original music for this critically acclaimed show about rock and roll.\n\nGet Stereophonic tickets now.\n\nMary Jane\n\nRachel McAdams makes her Broadway debut in this show's title role, a single mother seeking support anywhere she can get it as she cares for her chronically ill child and weathers personal tragedy. But will it be enough?\n\nMother Play\n\nPulitzer Prize winner Paula Vogel returns with her latest Broadway play, and it's a stacked one. Jessica Lange plays the mother to Jim Parsons and Celia Keenan-Bolger in this show, in which all three characters must cope with their lives going differently than each other had hoped.\n\nPatriots\n\nThis play by Peter Morgan, the Emmy-winning creator of The Crown, tells the lesser-publicized story behind the rise of Vladimir Putin. Patriots centers on Boris Berezovsky, a powerful figure who got Putin elected — and eventually became a government outcast for daring to criticize him.\n\nWhat shows are eligible for Best Revival of a Musical at the 2024 Tony Awards?\n\nFour reinvented 20th-century classics join two early-aughts crowd favorites. Here are all six shows eligible for Best Revival of a Musical at the 2024 Tony Awards.\n\nMerrily We Roll Along\n\nFrom a flop to a hit, Merrily We Roll Along got a total transformation. Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe, and Lindsay Mendez star in the first revival of Stephen Sondheim's musical about a friendship that falls apart across 20 years.\n\nSpamalot\n\nThe coconuts, Knights of Ni, fisch schlapping, and more beloved Monty Python bits are back. Spamalot's first revival captures the look, feel, and hilarity of its 2005 original, loosely based on the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nThe Who's Tommy\n\nThe Who's landmark concept album became a landmark musical in the '90s, and now it's back on Broadway for the first time. The title character is a catatonic young boy who finds local fame — and unexpected healing from trauma — after discovering his knack for pinball.\n\nThe Wiz\n\nThe Wiz is easing on down the road to Broadway once more, bringing this Black cultural retelling of The Wizard of Oz to a new generation. Wayne Brady plays the title role this time around, and Amber Ruffin contributes new material to the celebrated story.\n\nGet The Wiz tickets now.\n\nCabaret\n\nLife is still a cabaret nearly 60 years after this Kander and Ebb musical premiered. The latest revival, an award-winning transfer from London, is semi-immersive, completely refashioning the August Wilson Theatre into the Kit Kat Club.\n\nCheck back for information on Cabaret tickets on New York Theatre Guide.\n\nGutenberg! The Musical!\n\nThis musical about hapless writers pitching a wildly inaccurate Johannes Gutenberg bio-musical has never been on Broadway before. But since it's been around since 2006, the Tony Awards committee is counting it as a revival. Andrew Rannells and Josh Gad play the writers in this production, reuniting on Broadway for the first time since The Book of Mormon.\n\nWhat shows are eligible for Best Revival of a Play at the 2024 Tony Awards?\n\nFive play revivals, all star-studded, opened during the season. Here’s a look at the 2024 Best Revival of a Play contenders.\n\nPurlie Victorious\n\nBack for the first time since its 1961 premiere, Purlie Victorious feels like it hasn't aged a day. Leslie Odom, Jr. played the title role in this revival, which follows a priest who schemes to take back an inheritance from a white tyrant in order to save his church.\n\nDoubt\n\nThere's no doubt that this revival of the Tony- and Pulitzer-winning play by John Patrick Shanley is one to watch. Liev Schreiber plays a priest at an all-boys Catholic school, and Amy Ryan is the principal suspicious of his interactions with a student. But what's real, and what's misplaced doubt?\n\nAn Enemy of the People\n\nSuccession Emmy Award winner Jeremy Strong returns to the New York stage for An Enemy of the People, playing a doctor who receives hatred for whistleblowing contaminated town water — even though he saved lives. Michael Imperioli and Victoria Pedretti also make their Broadway debuts with the show.\n\nUncle Vanya\n\nSteve Carell makes his Broadway debut in the title role of this Chekhov classic, newly adapted by Heidi Schreck (What the Constitution Means to Me). The quiet farm lives of a woman and her uncle get upended when family comes to visit, leading to revelations of long-suppressed desires and dreams.\n\nAppropriate\n\nSarah Paulson, Corey Stoll, and more are one big not-so-happy family in this drama by Pulitzer Prize finalist Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. While settling their late father's estate, three adult siblings find some disturbing relics from his past — giving rise to even more revelations and tensions.\n\nAppropriate has not been on Broadway before, but it is competing in the revival category as it premiered off Broadway 10 years ago.\n\nWhat Broadway shows are not eligible for 2024 Tony Awards?\n\nOnly three Broadway shows are not up for Tony Awards in 2024. This list is updated each year with the Broadway shows that will not be eligible for the Tony Awards as the eligibility committee makes these determinations.\n\nAlex Edelman: Just For Us\n\nThis solo stand-up show by comedian Alex Edelman is not in consideration for Tony Awards; though stand-up shows are sometimes considered in special categories, they often do not vie for the competitive categories alongside plays and musicals. Edelman's doing just fine, though — his show earned rave reviews on Broadway and has toured the country and the world.\n\nMelissa Etheridge: My Window\n\nMelissa Etheridge's solo show was part concert, part confessional, all soul. It does not fit into the genre of a standard play or musical, but Etheridge's fans enjoyed its unique blend of song and storytelling during its two-month limited run in fall 2023.\n\nEl Mago Pop\n\nThe self-titled illusion show of Spanish magician El Mago Pop had a brief run on Broadway — just over one week long. El Mago Pop, whose real name is Antonio Diaz, made his Broadway debut with the mind-bending performance."
