While the primary spacecraft systems are a rebuild of the original GRACE mission, GRACE-FO carries the Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) technology demonstration which will use laser interferometry to measure nanometer changes between the two GRACE-FO spacecraft flying roughly 300km apart from one another. The LRI was built by a US-German collaboration that includes many LISA veterans and takes advantage of technologies that were originally developed to support LISA. The advancement of these technologies for GRACE-FO now adds experience that can be applied to LISA.\n\nRead more on NASA.gov\n\n12th International LISA Symposium Now Accepting Abstracts\n\nAbstract submissions are open for the 12th International LISA Symposium, to be held 8-13 July 2018 in Chicago, IL.
