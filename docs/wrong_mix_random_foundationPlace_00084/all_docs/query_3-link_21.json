The credit would be up to $2,234 if both primary taxpayer and spouse/RDP qualify.↵Return to place in table.\n\n**For information on the maximum income allowed to qualify for the federal EITC based on filing status and number of children or relatives claimed, visit the IRSâs EITC tables webpage.↵Return to place in table.\n\nClaim your credit\n\nYou must file your state tax return to claim CalEITC.
