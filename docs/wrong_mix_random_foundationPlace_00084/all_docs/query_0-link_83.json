For this challenge, we want you to focus on minimizing the costs around building and installing clean energy solutions. This extends to the way energy is stored as well, to maximize the efficiency of the entire infrastructure.\n\nExamples:\n\nMPPT circuits for solar setups\n\nBattery arrays with charging monitors\n\nDIY wind or water power generating systems\n\nRecycling makes a whole lot of sense, but too often there are obstacles in the way of ensuring that typical materials are reused and repurposed. For this challenge, we are asking you to create new ways to recycle materials. Whether it’s harvesting valuable chips from PCBs, or extracting materials that could be used in other projects, the approach you choose is completely up to you!\n\nExamples:\n\nSystems for depopulating PCBs and harvesting the most useful chips\n\nTools to extract the gold from PCBs\n\nShredders, heat presses, etc. that turn used plastic into millable blocks"
