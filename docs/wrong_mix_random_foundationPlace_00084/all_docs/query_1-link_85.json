        "text": "June 3, 2019\n\n[3.5] There’s some disagreement within the CF community about whether or not this book is an accurate depiction of CF. And I think that will depend on who you ask. Each and every person with CF experiences this disease in our own way, from its severity to our symptoms, to how we feel about the disease and its impact on our lives. It would be impossible for one book to represent every one of us.\n\nStella, Will, and Poe are in what I would call end stage CF, meaning their lungs are at a point that transplant is the only option. So far my experience with CF looks different from theirs in some very specific ways: I don’t have a feeding tube, I’m not in need of a lung transplant, and I don’t spend a lot of time in the hospital (all of these things of which I am VERY grateful). For me, one of the hardest parts of living with CF is the fear -- knowing what’s possible, that my life will most likely be shortened, that one cold or bad bacteria could change everything -- makes me feel like I need to be hyper vigilant about my health.\n\nI appreciated that the book discussed the importance of treatment compliance. Most everyone with CF goes through a period of not wanting to do their treatments but it’s not something I’ve seen talked about before outside of the CF community.\n\nI also think the book did a great job showing how isolating it is to not be able to be around the very people who understand what living with this disease is like. I’ve never met someone else with CF -- never had a cup of coffee, grabbed dinner, or hugged someone who knows how brutal that disease can be. It’s one of the hardest parts of having CF.\n\nAs for representation, do I think Five Feet Apart did a good job of portraying life with CF? Yes… and no. A lot of the emotions, while heightened and at times dramatic (as YA tends to be), were relatable. Loneliness, fear, guilt (especially survivor’s guilt) -- those are feelings I experience. Was it medically accurate? In a lot of ways it was, although there were a couple scenes that didn’t feel quite plausible.\n\nIt’s important to remember who this book is written for; it was not intended for me, and because of that there were aspects of it that didn’t resonate. I’m hopeful that this book will at least get people to pay attention to a disease that has largely been unknown. (One other thing to note: this book was based off of the screenplay for the Five Feet Apart movie.)\n\nOverall, the reader in me enjoyed the story and the characters (I’m a sucker for an ill-fated romance). The CF side of me is glad this book (and the upcoming movie) is out in the world. At the very least it’s starting some conversations.\n\nClaire Wineland, who passed away from CF last year, had a huge hand in the creation of this story. Her contributions went a long way in giving a voice to those of us with CF. Please check out Claire’s Place Foundation to learn more about her life.\n\nOctober 22, 2021\n\nEdit: For the love of God I wrote this review two years ago but some of y'all are still messaging me how dare I say I didn't like the romance. I did not like it. That's it.\n\nI was going to start off by making a joke about the vine reference 'two bros chilling in a hot tub five feet apart 'cause they're not gay' (remember that vine?) but I have thought about it so much it's not funny anymore. But if you do find it funny; thank you, I try. (Now that I think of it, a lot of people made that joke before me so I won't be taking any credit lol)\n\nAnyway, you can read the synopsis anywhere so I won't even bother explaining the story because well, you know, I do not want to. It was cute, this book. Short and sweet with (thankfully) mature characters. I mean not very mature as they are only seventeen but much better than the characters you read in a typical YA book.\n\nI do have one problem though; the absolutely unnecessary romance. I mean WHY does everything just need to have romance in it? I just do not get it.\n\nMy Blog\n\nJanuary 2, 2020\n\nCan't say I'm surprised I didn't enjoy this book but it was part of my \"Goodreads Reading Challenge\" so I did it.\n\nDefinitely felt like another cliché YA romance with teenagers too sick to be in love and yet...\n\nNot my cup of tea!\n\nNovember 22, 2018\n\nTwo things before I start my review:\n\n1. I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this book. I believe it’s urgent to raise awareness about CF and many other chronic illnesses (many of them invisible) countless people live with.\n\n2. I don’t have CF and I don’t have family members with CF (although I do have friends with CF). I won’t speak over CFers because this is not my narrative; this is theirs. I know Claire Wineland was a great help in the making of this story and I know many CFers are grateful for the representation in media. However, I’m also aware that an equally large number of CFers have raised concerns over the romantization of CF and the novel’s central topic. When talking about things that irked me the wrong way, I am in debt with Gunnar Esiason and Elsie Tellier for their analyses on the premise of Five Feet Apart, which have educated me a lot on the matter.\n\nPhew! Let’s begin:\n\n• The romantization of CF. Look, this was my biggest concern but I’m afraid Five feet apart falls into the same category as The Fault in Our Stars and other sick-lit books. Although they do get things right about CF (the treatments, especially), the ugly symptoms are conveniently brushed away. We don’t see any of the various digestive side affects of CF (apart from issues with a G tube) and we don’t see instances in which CF makes our characters look “ugly” or, well, sick. They don’t vomit, they don’t throw up mucus, their coughing always stops when it’s convenient, they’re not underweight... it’s like the author carefully picked which symptoms are more conventionally beautiful and forgot to write in the rest (and I’m aware every person with CF is different, but it’s just so convenient that a girl with a lung capacity in the thirties and a boy with B. Cepacia barely show any complications?). The illness is completely sanitized, and the hospital is portrayed as a playground where you can roam around freely and not, uh, a place to get better. Because these characters are sick to begin with yet they have enormous energy at all times.\n\n• The insta-love. Let’s get past the fact that Stella and Will fulfill Hollywood tropes (her being the type A personality control freak and him being the CF ~rebel~ who doesn’t take his illness seriously). They know each other for a full... what? Couple of weeks? A month tops? And they fall in love. They actually say to each other that they are in love so much so that Stella is willing to give up her lung transplant for a brooding hero she’s known for some weeks. Okay, sure. This is a rare example in which both partners are manic pixie dream girls/boys to each other, changing their partner’s outlook and making them better people/enjoy life more EVEN THOUGH THEY’VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR SOME WEEKS!\n\n• The Bury Your Gays trope. Oh, boy, isn’t it a coincidence that the only openly gay character of color dies? And his death is used as a prop to make the main character have a sudden, deep realization about her life. (Also, you don’t defibrillate an asystole!!)\n\n• Will and Stella are their CF. Will has one (1) hobby non-CF related, which is drawing (and he ends up using it to ponder on his illness), but his whole character arc and his whole personality all refer back to his illness. Stella is so much her CF even her whole YT channel revolves around it (which is a shame because I thought the YT element was such a good idea since there’s a strong CF awareness community on YT and elsewhere on social media, but the fact that EVERYTHING about Stella is defined by her CF kinda ruins it).\n\nJust because you’re terminally ill doesn’t mean you’re gonna learn a bunch of valuable lessons about life or that you’re going to be deeper and more intelligent. It also doesn’t mean you’re gonna be thinking about your condition and death 24/7, which is something our characters do ALL. THE. TIME. You’d think living with a chronic terminal illness would make you fed up with your chronic terminal illness, but turns out these characters always have the time and energy to ponder on the afterlife and the progression of their condition.\n\n• The characterization is very bad. All the characters except for Poe (and they kill him off) are: a) very archetypical, and b) completely bidimensional.\n\n• The unnecessary melodrama. Surely Stella’s sister had to die in a freaky accident while she was out living her life to the fullest unlike her terminally ill sister. Surely Poe had to die on Will’s birthday and just after getting together with his boyfriend. Surely Stella had to fall on a frozen lake so that Will had to perform CPR on her while she was hallucinating with her dead sister’s ghost (who told her to live her life to the fullest). CF is bad enough on its own; you don’t need to try and manipulate readers into feeling bad for these characters.\n\n• The prose is extremely flat. The characters also read like teens who have been written by an adult rather than actual teens.\n\n• The capitalization of suffering. Look, this is what pisses me off the most. This novel romanticizes and sanitizes CF, turning people’s suffering into inspiration porn and a star-crossed lovers tale of sorts. And it’s so dangerous as well! CFers can pass their bacteria to each other and it is immensely risky for CFers to spend as much time together as Stella and Will do, even if they abide by the 6 foot away rule (the fact that Stella tries to make it 5 foot is even more stupid). These teens are essentially putting their lives at risk because... they’re horny? (And how attracted they’re to each other physically is like 70-80% of their whole relationship, so don’t @ me). The authors of this book could’ve written a love story between a CFer and a healthy person (a relationship that would have conflicts of its own), or simply a story that doesn’t revolve around CF but starring a character with CF! Because your life is so much more than treatments and hospitals and life expectancies no matter your chronic health condition.\n\nSo, yeah, it seems CF is finally getting the treatment as an illness to be exploited for feel-good media that cancer has been enduring since the 70s and Segal’s Love Story. When we were finally growing out TFiOS, here it comes Five feet apart to profit off the glorification of terminal illnesses 🙃\n\n(If you’re still here and you wanna read a book that portrays illness and dying honestly and accurately: grab Me, and Earl, and the dying girl by Jesse Andrews).\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 6, 2022\n\nBeing subjected to mental and emotional pain could also be definition of a type of masochism which I’m doing right now by reading this book and crying like newborn baby. My neighbors tried to cover my mouth with duct tapes, naturally I ripped them. My husband begged me to stop because all the neighborhood’s army of dogs joined me and began howling. Everybody was terrified because of possible upcoming earthquake!\n\nSorry guys, I’m mostly sarcastic cow who pulls pranks on people, laughing at people who falls down (I also laugh at myself when my butt hit the floor. It’s painful but also silly feeling!) but when it comes to watch or read something heart wrenching tear jerker, I feel like somebody turns on my tear faucet. It’s like eating entire bag of Cheetos, once I start I can never stop!\n\nThis book is torturous and interesting experience because this is the first time I’m reading something based on screenplay. (Normally we read the book and we love it and then we hit the theaters and curse to the screenwriter-once upon a time I did an adaption to the screen, too, but I was just the messenger, the director butchered the movie and earned my flipping bird anyways.-curse to the producers who spent nonsense money to kill the soul of the beautiful book!)\n\nIn this case, I read the book and for doubling my torture experience, I watched the movie. ( Both Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse-even I hate his signature hat at Riverdale, he was my favorite twin and Ross’ son- and thankfully it made $91.522.094 – yes, budget is only 7M son it is a big win, congrats kids!-) Honestly I loved the movie more. It’s also scripted well and the actors’ additional emotional performances impressed me more than the words of the book. Maybe it lost its emotional touch when it is adapted to the novel like something got lost in translation. I know it is so weird to express but it is so true. When you look at the actors’ faces from a gesture, a mimic or a sudden expression you got the entire feeling but when you read their stories at the same book, the words don’t resonate enough the actors’ tragic, heartbreaking situations.\n\nAnd of course resemblances with John Green’s “Fault in our stars” ( they caged me after reading this book and sent me to rehab for ugly criers! 10 worse traumatic days of my life!) are obvious but I didn’t want to think much about it.\n\nSo I guess I’ll do something interesting I’ll give three stars to this book after watching movie but I’m giving five stars to the script ( and also entire casting won my heart and earned their ten stars) and I will give 3.5 stars (best solution is meeting in the middle because this kind of beautiful story doesn’t deserve to get lower points from me but I have to be fair that the script and performances are so much better than the book.)\n\nHell yes, first time at the night time I drank too much coffee when I was reading a book not to be get controlled by my emotional breakdown and probably I’m gonna be awake for entire week, but yes this is memorable and of course is one of the winners of this year. But I highly recommend you to watch the movie so you’re gonna know how I feel exactly!!!\n\nJune 10, 2019\n\ni went into this book hoping to get TFIOS vibes. im such a sucker for love stories about two people who demand more from life than what they are given. and although this story does touch on that message, that is surprisingly not why i enjoyed this book.\n\nif anything, i think the story is actually kind of bland. im not a fan of the writing and i didnt feel connected to the characters. its one of those books where you walk away, knowing its missing something that could have made the story truly great (maybe because its based on a screenplay and not an original novel??).\n\nthat being said, i got so much out of this book. not an emotional impact from a loving story, like i thought, but a new perspective of how often i take my health for granted. every time it talked about the characters struggling for breath, i inhaled so deeply, marvelling at how well my lungs work. i think that, unless we are sick, we dont appreciate how much our bodies do. and this book definitely opened my eyes to that, which isnt something i can ignore.\n\nso although the story itself is probably only 2.5/3 stars realistically, what i got out of it is worth a higher rating to me.\n\n↠ 3.5 stars\n\nJune 13, 2020\n\n”Everyone in this world is breathing borrowed air.”\n\nI thought long and hard about how to review “Five Feet Apart” and to be entirely honest I still haven’t found an answer... yet. I’m aware that opinions tend to differ when it comes to books like this one and there will always be as many pros as cons. On the one hand I think it’s important to raise awareness for diseases like CF and on the other hand I know that a kind of forbidden love sob story might not be the right way to do so.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized that it’s up to me how to take this story though. I could say it’s unrealistic that two people with CF fall in love, I could say that the reality of living with CF was romanticized by the MCs love story. If I knew more about CF I would probably also say that the rep wasn’t accurate. But neither of those things is the reason why this book exists. It wants to raise awareness and it did/does! So from that kind of perspective “Five Feet Apart” did exactly what it was supposed to do!\n\n”And I realize I’m doing the one thing I’ve told myself this whole time I wouldn’t do. I’m wanting something I can never have.”\n\nIf I take a closer look at the love story between Stella and Will I’ve to say that it worked for me. I mean just think about it, they both had to deal with CF their entire lives and they might have friends at school and outside of the hospital, but it’s definitely realistic that they would get to know other patients in their hospital ward. If you’re a teen your first love is all-consuming and yes, it would make you do stupid things. And even this is arguable because let’s face it, other than falling in love with each other Stella and Will never did anything that would have threatened their lives. In fact considering their circumstances they were actually pretty careful. Except, of course, at the ending of the book, but I really can’t blame Stella and Will for their actions. I mean Poe died! He was their friend and Stella knew him all her life. It’s no wonder that she lost it and wanted to rebel. Against her disease, against death, against her life that was dictated by countless restrictions and rules.\n\n”I never even hugged him. Never. Don’t touch! Don’t stand too close. Don’t, don’t, don’t!” I scream out, hysterical, coughing, dizzy. “He was my best friend and I never hugged him.”\n\nFor me her reaction was really relatable and I felt her pain. T_T Grief can change you and yes, under those circumstances it made her reckless.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters Stella and Will might have been typical stereotypes. Stella the good girl that went through with her regimen and always did what the doctors told her to do, and Will the rebel who didn’t give a damn about his treatments. The longer you read the more you see that nothing is as black and white as it appears to be though. I loved Will’s hobby of drawing comics, I liked Stella’s YouTube Channel, I enjoyed their interactions with their friends and with each other. Stella’s friendship with Poe was EVERYTHING!!!\n\n”He stands up, stepping toward me and groaning in frustration. “This disease is a fucking prison! I want to hug you.”\n\nI sniff nodding in agreement.\n\n“Pretend I did, okay?” he says. I see he’s blinking back tears too. “And know that I love you. More than food! More than the Colombian national team!”\n\nThose two just broke my heart and mended it at the same time! <333 Their friendship was so natural and mutual. They always made sure that the other was alright and even when they were angry at each other they still tried to find a way to talk it out. I could understand Poe’s fear of a normal relationship, because no matter how much you want to sugarcoat it, in the end his boyfriend would have always had to deal with CF too. There’s a high risk you might lose the person you love and not a lot of people would be willing to take that risk. It’s never fair if the days of the person you love are counted. But people die for various reasons and I speak from experience here when I say that everyone has to decide if it’s worth to take that risk or not. I had both sorts of relationships as a teen. I decided for my bf and knew he probably wouldn’t live all too long (he’s my ex-bf now and still alive and well! <3 And I’m so thankful for that.) And I went into another relationship with a healthy and wonderful boy and he died... I could really relate A LOT to the situation regarding Abby. What I’m trying to say is: No one knows what’s going to happen! All you can do is to live in the moment and to make the best out of it. And that’s exactly what Stella and Will decided to do.\n\n”But now what I want isn’t outside. It’s right here, close enough to touch. But I can’t. I didn’t know it was possible to want something so bad you could feel it in your arms and your legs and in every breath you take.”\n\nTo read this book felt like watching the movie and even though they were both good I still think that I liked the movie better. Maybe it’s because the fast pacing of the love story goes better with a movie than it does with a book? In the book the relationship between Stella and Will seemed to be rather insta-lovey whereas it appeared to be a little slower in the movie. I guess that’s due to the fact that there is a lot of time passing in the movie and scenes just fade out while the book makes it a habit to continue with the story without the benefit of having those fade out moments. XD Does that make any sense?! *lol*\n\nAs for the ending of the book vs. the movie: I liked the book ending more, because we got to see an epilogue and I really needed that epilogue after watching the movie! (Boy, I didn’t even know how much I needed that epilogue until I read it!! XD) Watching the movie I never got that epilogue and it killed me. Sure it’s still some sort of open ending but with the epilogue I could make some peace. Not that both endings didn’t kill me. They still did! T_T\n\nHe presses harder too, his voice shaking as he continues.\n\n“The only thing I want is to be with you. But I need for you to be safe. Safe from me.” He fights to continue, tears streaming down his face. “I don’t want to leave you, but I love you too much to stay.” He laughs through his tears, shaking his head. “God, the freakin’ movies were right.”\n\n”Please close your eyes,” he begs, his jaw tightening. “Let me go.”\n\nMy heart is bleeding!! <333 I love Will so much for doing the right thing and for letting Stella go so she could build a life with her new lungs. He truly loves her because he put her wellbeing above his own needs. T_T Still, this will always make me cry.\n\nConclusion:\n\n“Five Feet Apart” is a book about two people that have CF and fall in love with each other, and this even though they both know that they can never have a normal relationship. It’s a beautiful story about love, friendship, hope, fear, despair, anger, weaknesses and responsibility. It’s life-affirming as well as sad. More than anything else it’s human though. An important story that needs to be told, to raise awareness and in order to help people that suffer from CF. I, for my part, am glad that this book exists! =)\n\n___________________________\n\nOkay, I admit it, I saw the movie first and then realized that there is a book as well.\n\nSo yes, Cole Sprouse made me want to read this because... well he's Cole Sprouse and he was so amazing in the movie that I cried an ocean when I watched it.\n\nI hope the book is as good as the movie, maybe even better!?\n\nThe topic is quite serious so I hope the book is going to do it justice. In my eyes the movie certainly did.\n\nWish me luck! =)\n\nFebruary 27, 2019\n\nHeartfelt, touching & absorbing!\n\nFIVE FEET APART by RACHAEL LIPPINCOTT was such an endearing, engaging and a sweet Teens & YA novel featuring two teenage main characters, Stella and Will who are both patients in the hospital with Cystic Fibrosis that fall in love. I was totally taken with this story and this tale of these two star-crossed lovers, Stella and Will as they totally consumed my thoughts and my heart.\n\nThis book immediately grabbed my attention with that gorgeous cover and I knew it was a book that I had to read. Although I was a little bit worried because it is marketed for the Teens & YA genre but I needn’t have worried though as I was immediately drawn into this touching and heartbreaking story and I couldn’t put it down. This story was so sad to read at times but yet at other times it was so hopeful. It had me smiling and feeling such warmth and love for these two characters.\n\nRACHAEL LIPPINCOTT delivers an intriguing, emotional, well-plotted and well-written read here with relatable and likeable characters that I couldn’t help but to fall in love with. The story is told in alternating perspectives between Stella and Will and I thoroughly enjoyed both narratives equally. They complimented each other so well and I really felt for them. Both of their situations and feelings towards each other rang true and I loved how I learned so much more about Cystic Fibrosis.\n\nThe story might be considered to be a little bit corny or cliche for some but for me I totally fell for it and devoured it in two sittings. I am a total sucker for emotional and sweet romance novels.\n\nLearning that this book is already being made into a movie I just had to watch the trailer and I know that it is a movie that I am definitely putting on my list of movies to watch.\n\nNorma’s Stats:\n\nCover: Eye-catching, gorgeous, intriguing and a beautiful representation to storyline.\n\nTitle: Such a meaningful, emotive and fitting representation to storyline.\n\nWriting/Prose: Well-written, effortless, genuine, light and beautiful.\n\nPlot: Engrossing, interesting, heartfelt, steady-paced, and entertaining.\n\nEnding: An open-ended ending that left me feeling hopeful and totally satisfied.\n\nOverall: The story is a tender, light and easy read that just simply pulls at the heartstrings. Would highly recommend!\n\nThank you so much to Simon & Schuster Canada and Rachael Lippincott for providing me with an advanced readers copy of this wonderful book.\n\nReview can also be found on our Two Sisters Lost in a Coulee Reading book blog:\n\nhttps://twosisterslostinacoulee.com/\n\nJune 23, 2020\n\n3.5 stars\n\nI mostly picked this up because i knew the characters had cystic fibrosis. It was a solid read, the story was kind of slow, I lost interest a bit at the end but an overall good experience.\n\nRead\n\nAugust 3, 2019\n\nYeah no, I'm not doing this. Nope.\n\nI don't want to give this a rating after not even having read 100 pages but I'm almost 100% sure this would've been a 1 star read.\n\nOh god, these characters are such obnoxious teenagers. Not as in realistically obnoxious but as in the cliche YA teenager obnoxious.\n\nI disliked each of them within the first few sentences of their first chapter. Might be a new record for me.\n\nCan't really say much about the plot itself because nothing happened (which is fair, I only read like 80 pages).\n\nWant to read\n\nMay 1, 2019\n\nis this the next the fault in our stars?\n\nJuly 1, 2019\n\n3.5 ⭐️\n\n“It’s just life Will. It’ll be over before we know it.”\n\nI’d seen mixed reviews regarding this book. Some loved it; pegged it as the next Fault in Our Stars. Others found it irritating, mushy and generally unenjoyable. I am sat right on the fence. I read TFIOS years ago, and I remember thinking it was ok, I wasn’t blown away, sure it was sad, but I felt it tried too hard to be sad….I dunno. And I felt a similar way with Five Feet Apart.\n\nStella and Will both have Cystic Fibrosis, Will has also recently contracted B Cepacia, which means his lungs are even more delicate than others; and he can easily pass this bacteria to other patients. Hence the rule – no closer than 6 feet to other CF sufferers AT ALL TIMES. (Yup 6 feet – the 5 feet thing comes later in the book).\n\nUnfortunately, true love gets in the way. You can call me an old cynic if you like, but the relationship was so insta-lovey, and Stella was just so quick to throw away her own well-being for the sake of being closer to Will, and I’m just sat here like….REALLY?!? Don’t you value your life at all? You’ve only been desperately fighting this disease for nearly your whole life just to throw it away on some boy?? Honestly!\n\nAnd then just to prove this point they go and kill off Poe. Stella’s best friend. Just so it’s majorly obvious how stupid and dangerous their behaviour is. But does it stop them? Nope.\n\nI get that it’s supposed to be romantic, and that some things are bigger than their disease, and life is about taking risks etc. But I just couldn’t get behind this….\n\nI’ve given an extra half star as it was an easy read, and there were plenty of enjoyable parts. I just wasn’t sure about the overall message.\n\nMarch 2, 2019\n\nIt's been said (although the provenance of the quote is questionable) that, \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.\" While this adage holds true in many aspects of my life, in this case it applies to my penchant for reading tearjerkers yet being surprised when I'm sobbing (once again on a plane, no less).\n\nKnowing that I'd probably cry, I still couldn't stay away from Five Feet Apart , even though the movie adaptation is supposed to be released this weekend, I think. I didn't just read this book, I devoured it, all in the course of a quick plane trip. And while it elicited the expected emotions, I really wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did.\n\nEven though her cystic fibrosis has kept her from doing some of the things she has wanted, Stella has always taken control of her disease, at least as much as she possibly can. She's a big fan of to-do lists (she loves crossing things off) and she hosts her own video series about CF on YouTube. But no matter how much control she tries to take, she can't avoid frequent extended trips to the hospital—and try as she might, she can't protect everyone around her.\n\nWhat Stella and her family are hoping for is a transplant. It won't save her life completely, but it will give her more time. However, in order to be eligible for a transplant, she has to protect herself from any possible infections or viruses, which means she can't get less than six feet from anyone else with CF, even her best friend, Poe, with whom she essentially grew up in the hospital. When they're both in the hospital together, they have to rely on texting, Skype, and talking through surgical masks and from doorways.\n\nWill has been in and out of hospitals all over the world, and he's tired of it all, especially his mother's single-minded crusade to help him beat a dangerous bacterial infection. Who knows how much money she has spent on getting him in a new drug trial? Will is just waiting until he turns 18, so he can walk away from the hospital and the drug trial, and live (and die) on his own terms.\n\nStella can't stand to see anyone throwing away their shot at survival, no matter how limited time must be. Will's refusal to participate in his own treatment is something she can't control, and that angers and saddens her. She doesn't love his devil-may-care attitude, and he doesn't love her control-freak tendencies.\n\nAs their friendship deepens into something more intense, they face more obstacles than they can handle. They literally cannot get more than six feet from one another. Even a sneeze could infect Stella and knock her off the transplant list. But what is the solution? Is having to keep a physical distance from one another better than not having each other at all?\n\nYou probably can predict a good amount of what will happen in Five Feet Apart (although there are some sort-of surprises), but it didn't matter to me in the slightest. In a short number of pages I became totally invested in these characters and their lives, even though I knew ultimately there would be some sorrow involved. Yes, there were some similarities to The Fault in Our Stars but I didn't necessarily feel as if Will, Stella, and Poe were masters of sarcasm and wry observations as the characters were in the former.\n\nThis book is based on the screenplay of the movie, so I'd imagine there won't be much deviation, but again, it doesn't matter. I know I'll sob in the theater just as I did on the airplane (thank goodness the lights were off), and I'll think about how much I take for granted. And then I'll smile wistfully as I think about Will, Stella, and Poe.\n\nSee all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com.\n\nCheck out my list of the best books I read in 2018 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2018.html.\n\nYou can follow me on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yrralh/.\n\nSeptember 4, 2019\n\nMy thoughts in a nutshell\n\nI've read this one in July, and I'm writing this review in September. My satisfaction is still alive. I adored this story so much.\n\nI usually enjoy books about disease; this is totally my guilty pleasure.\n\nI got close to the characters. I could empathize with them. I like Stella and Will's relationship. It was cute and innocent.\n\nThe writing style was easy and simple. I flow through it in one sitting.\n\nI'm happy because of the ending. It isn't sensationalist, and I'm grateful for it.\n\nWhen I finished it, I watched the movie adaptation. OMG! The film was a huge big surprise. It was phenomenal! The actors were a perfect choice. I've to say out loud it was the best adaptation what I saw in 2019.\n\nI highly recommend you to read the book then watch the movie because they complement each other.\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\n“Everyone in this world is breathing borrowed air.”\n\nI know next to nothing about Cystic Fibrosis and it was so interesting to read about these two kids struggling but coping in different ways. I like how the author brought awareness to this disease. Staying six feet apart from others is something that everyone can empathize with at this moment, due to COVID-19, making the story easy to relate to even for those without cystic fibrosis. Yes, it will definitely remind you of Fault in Our Stars by John Green but again don't compare it, both of them are unique in their own way.\n\nThere's a simple rule about reading books like these. Be prepared to cry buckets or just tear up a bit. That's what 'Five Feet Apart' did to me. I smiled, blushed and cried a bit as I read this beautiful story of Stella and Will.\n\nYou might like to check out more similar books here.\n\nFebruary 24, 2019\n\n“If I’m going to die, I’d like to actually live first.”\n\nVaaaale, este libro no fue tan grave como Bajo La Misma... SÍ FUE MUY GRAVE, ay...\n\nEn A Dos Metros De Ti nos encontramos con la historia de Stella y Will, dos chicos que tienen fibrosis quística y que han vivido la mitad de sus vidas en hospitales y en medio de tratamientos para ganar un poco más de tiempo. Ambos son terminales, pero mientras Stella se apega fielmente a su tratamiento para subir en la lista de espera de trasplantes de pulmón, Will ha dejado de luchar. Poco a poco, Stella y Will irán entablando una peligrosa e inevitable amistad, pues a pesar de tener que estar separados siempre por dos metros, a veces hay que robarle momentos a una vida que, inevitablemente, se va haciendo cada vez más corta.\n\nVamos a ver... de verdad yo pensé que estaba preparada para otro golpe emocional del calibre de Bajo La Misma Estrella, pero me equivocaba. Pensé que el saber que una historia entre dos chicos, dos pacientes terminales, iba a acabar mal me iba a salvar de la avalancha de sentimientos del final... y no. Con cada página que leía de A Dos Metros De Ti me iba enamorando más de Will y de Stella. No podía evitar amar la rebeldía de Will y la determinación de Stella.\n\nEstos dos son chicos tremendamente maduros para su edad, pues han tenido que encargarse de su enfermedad desde que tienen memoria. Cada día, cada respiro, es una lucha para ambos, pero aún así, en medio de un hospital, logran formar un vínculo tremendamente estrecho y especial. ¡Y lo que me dolía leerlos en los momentos en los que necesitaban un abrazo y no se podían acercar el uno al otro! Todo es muy fuerte. La lucha que tiene Will consigo mismo y con la bacteria que le impide ser candidato a un transplante me rompía el corazón. Y qué decir de Stella cuando por fin se da cuenta de que la vida es algo más que seguir un cronograma de medicinas y terapias y que, a pesar de todo, puede permitirse sentir, temer, llorar, amar...\n\nLeer una historia de amor entre dos personas que, literalmente, no pueden tocarse porque sus vidas corren peligro es de lo más duro que he hecho últimamente. Es tan duro y frustrante que, por momentos, quería que mandaran todo al demonio y se lanzaran el uno en brazos del otro, que abrazaran como si el mundo se fuera a acabar, que tiraran a la basura sus mascarillas y se dieran ese beso con el que tanto soñaban... pero luego volvía esa eterna lucha entre el arriesgarse y tocarse o, sencillamente, seguir viviendo tiempo prestado.\n\nY, por supuesto, diga lo que diga, no estaba preparada para el final. Esas últimas páginas, esa montaña rusa de sensaciones y acontecimientos me dejó con muchísimas lágrimas en los ojos. Es absolutamente increíble todo lo que una persona puede hacer por otra que ama, los sacrificios que está dispuesto a hacer, los momentos a los que está dispuesto a renunciar. El final de A Dos Metros De Ti es un final que te destroza y que te hace tristemente feliz. Me da igual si eso no tiene sentido. Pero es un final que está a la altura de una historia llena de personajes valientes, momentos robados, lágrimas amargas y nuevos comienzos.\n\nSeptember 14, 2023\n\n5 \"So Near Yet Far\" stars!!!\n\n“If I’m going to die, I’d like to actually live first.”\n\nStella suffers from a genetic disease Cystic Fibrosis (CF),and is doing to keep up with her meds until she can get a new pair of lungs.\n\nWill, a reckless boy also suffering from CF, is doing his best to stir up problems and refuse to take his meds.\n\nWill and Stella, two people met under different circumstances finds solace in each other, though they know they can't ever be together. How can you love someone you cant touch?\n\n“I don't want to leave you, but I love you too much to stay.”\n\nIf anyone thinking Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, they are wrong. This far more beautiful than that brainless boy who fancied himself in love his enemy's daughter cuz his crush rejected him which is pathetic....But giving up your only chance to live to save the one you love? That is what true love is...\n\nI don't know why but it's kind of offensive how authors always make the guys with the name Will ill or sick.\n\nSooo...about Will and Stella. Did I tell how much I love them? They are the most adorable couple I met. And FUCK YOU author for smashing my perfect dream. The connection, the chemistry was just so amazing!!! I love how Will always care about Stella before himself. Love how Stella never gave up on him. Love how Will made sure Stella live life for the fullest. And when they made 6 feet apart thing 5 because they can't stay away from each other......OMG I CRIED LIKE A BABY!!! I just wish they were able to have their own happy ending. It's sad how the best couples never get to be together....\n\nMaybe it's true tho....God always chose his favourite flowers to pick first, so he must have picked them cause they have beautiful hearts..\n\nAnyways this story is amazing. A perfect story to read on a sad day or if you want to have a good cry. Beautiful story, heartbreaking end, and the best of true love!!!\n\nTropes\n\n-Bad Boy/Good Girl\n\n-CF Patients\n\n-NOT A HEA\n\nHighly Recommended!!! Enjoy!!!\n\nAugust 9, 2022\n\nWOW JUST WOW!!!! This book broke my heart, so damn much. I have no idea what to say, I just need some time to process what I just read. Five Feet Apart by Rachael Lippincott was absolutely no exception. Please just do me a favor and read this amazing story, I can't promise your heart won't heart after, I'm sorry. What I don't recommend is watching Chicago Fire and reading this book at the same time. I went into this story completely blind, I recommend doing so because it definitely gives you all the feels not knowing anything until you read it. I was hooked from the very first page, and couldn't put it down until the last page. I never really understood what cystic fibrosis was, but after reading Five Feet Apart it gave me a clear understanding of what it really is.\n\n\"For the first time, I feel the weight of every single inch, every single millimeter of the six feet between us. I pull my sweatshirt closer to my body...trying to ignore the fact that that open space? It will always be there.\"\n\nCan you love someone you can never touch?\n\nIn Five Feet Apart we follow the journey of Stella Grant and Will Newman. Stella likes to be in control, even though her totally out-of-control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. Stella loves to be organized, she has to-do lists, she created an app that sends her notifications when she needs to take her meds, her medicine cart is totally organized. Stella has cystic fibrosis, which is a progressive disease that causes long lasting lung infections and limits the ability to breathe. Stella pretty much knows her way around the hospital, she knows all of the nurses, she even knows most of the patients, including her best friend Poe. I adored the bond between Stella, and her nurse Barb. At this point, what Stella needs to control most, is her distance from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions.\n\nOne day, Stella is on her way to visit the NICU when she walks past a room and notices someone new, that would be Will Newman. Will has B. Cepacia, which causes serious respiratory infections. At first I found Will to be a little rude, but after reading through the story he becomes a sweetheart. The only thing Will wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn't care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical trial. But when Stella and Will make a deal, everything changes. Stella finds out that Will is NOT doing his treatments, she decides to download the app that she created on Will's phone, Stella and Will facetime everyday to take their medicine together. Will and Stella's friendship starts off with snarky comments.\n\nIn one week Will turns eighteen, and then he'll be able to unplug himself from all these machines and actually go see the world, not just the hospitals. Will has been to different hospitals around the world, but never actually got to see anything up close because the hospital always separated him from the outside world. Will is exactly what Stella needs to stay away from. But suddenly six feet doesn't feel like safety. It feels like punishment. What if Will and Stella could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too? Will and Stella form a relationship but can't come close in contact with each other, they must always remain five feet apart.\n\nOctober 13, 2021\n\n“If I’m going to die, I’d like to actually live first.”\n\nCan you love someone you can never touch?\n\nIn this moving story, two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within five feet of each other without risking their lives.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Stella spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient (CF). Her life is full of routines, boundaries, and self-control. All of those get put to the test when she meets Will, an impossibly charming boy who has the same illness. There's an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction.\n\nThe story is told in alternating perspectives between Stella and Will and both narratives complimented each other really well. At the heart of the novel is a love story.. with happiness and joy and loss and heartbreak in it, a beautiful love story between two people who can't even get close enough to touch one another. The difficulties of having cystic fibrosis add another dimension to the story.\n\nI loved Stella as the main character, she’s relatable and funny. Will’s character was of a stereotypical ‘rebel’ who needs to break the rules but he’s actually a total softie on the inside is clichéd but well written nonetheless. The supporting characters are all good too.\n\n“Everyone in this world is breathing borrowed air.”\n\nThere are parts of the story that felt clichéd like the somewhat clichéd characters especially Will, the insta-love between the characters, or the slightly predictable ending.\n\nBut overall, Five Feet Apart is a fast-paced, emotional, and well-plotted story with some likable characters with some good characters. The story has you hooked the entire time you're reading and a great read if you are in the mood to read a good YA.\n\nMarch 20, 2019\n\nI don't normally review books immediately after reading the last page. This gives me an opportunity to think and process what I've read and get my emotions in order. For Five Feet Apart I am breaking that rule as I feel that my emotions are important to why I wasn't a big fan of Rachel Lippincott's teenage romance story. First it's important to know I had a friend with cystic fibrosis...\n\nMy Brush with Cystic Fibrosis (CF)\n\nAlmost 20 years ago I lost a friend. I was 16 years old at the time. The last time I saw my friend Scott he was 17 and in the hospital. Scott was a great friend. I was in marching band with him and he was a funny, energetic and loving boy. We all knew his days were numbered. In the late 90's the average lifespan of someone with cystic fibrosis was about 17 years old. Scott lived to be 18. Always proud of making it a day past his 'expiry date' as he called it. As though he was yogurt that would spoil after a certain time. I suppose knowing he'd have a short life gave Scott an appreciation and affection for living that none of us (including myself) as teens were capable of understanding or appreciating. I'm still not sure I truly understand today at 36 years old. I tell you this so you can understand that CF is not just another awful disease to me. CF both was and wasn't my friend. It was integral to him and yet not a part of his personality. However it is a part of his legacy. I cannot forget (and wouldn't want to) those scary moments in parade routes, touring with our band or playing in a practice room when Scott would get an 'attack' (as he called them) where he couldn't breathe or coughed up mucus.\n\nWhy I Hate Books Written to Make You Cry\n\nI have always hated contemporary books where the sole purpose is to make you cry. I couldn't stand the overdone teenage philosophy of The Fault in Our Stars by John Green or the plot twist of My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult or any of the other similar contemporary stories. Now this isn't just because I'm not a big crier; it's also because I just don't understand the point of a story when the primary reason is to make you cry. I'd much rather experience a truly poignant romance that evolves over time during the plot of a good book. Graceling and Daughter of the Forest both come to mind when I think of amazing love stories that develop in spite of the challenges and plot in the story; instead of the love developing because of the plot.\n\nWhy'd I Even Bother?\n\nI decided to read Five Feet Apart even if I don't love the sob fest story. Here's 3 key reasons why:\n\n1) I like to read popular books so I can have an informed opinion,\n\n2) I wanted to experience the CF of 'today' as much of the science and the lifespan have nearly doubled since I last encountered CF, and\n\n3) I keep hoping someone will write a contemporary teen romance that I can fervently endorse.\n\nThe Writing & 3 Stars\n\nI can say that Lippincott writes in a fast-paced, easy to read format. This is a very quick, no-time or words wasted story. It's also very representative of how many teens are likely to think or speak in similar situations. So while I didn't like a number of things (see list below); I cannot deny that Five Feet Apart is well written and has good characterization. Lippincott has you on the hook the entire time you're reading. Whether it's at a critical 'tragic' moment or just our lead boy watching YouTube videos of our lead girl. Each moment leads into the next and kept me flipping the page. This is the primary reason I give it 3 stars.\n\nAnd So We Come to The Troublesome Items...\n\nWhile on one hand I appreciate that Lippincott wrote a book about CF and helped CF gain some recent exposure; I just can't say this is a 'good' representation of what CF is like for those that live it each and every day. I cannot (and will not) speak for them, or for my long-lost friend; but I can tell you about what I saw, heard and experienced while at my friends side.\n\nCF is a disease that takes your breath away & causes panic\n\nIt doesn't just make it difficult to breath like an asthma attack it actually stops your breathing in many ways. I remember many times my friend Scott would gasp for breath and you would hear nothing enter his lungs. The key, for him, was to stay calm. As I'm sure we can all imagine not being able to breath is horrifying and induces an instant panic attack. Sometimes I thought the panic must be worse for him than the lack of breath as the panic exacerbated things every time. There is one small moment of panic that our lead gal experiences. Every other 'panic' any CF teen i Five Feet Apart has is short lived, and is brought under control seemingly by sheer will. No examples of techniques or tricks to calm down, no counting, no breathing exercises, nothing. It's like the panic goes away with magic (just like they seem to find their breath).\n\nMucus\n\nOne thing that was always a constant for Scott was the mucus. He always had handkerchiefs, ziploc bags and wet wipes or alcohol wipes in his pockets and bags. Why? Because he used them to cough up his mucus, seal the ickiness and then wipe off his mouth, hands, etc. Romantic right? This would happen multiple times a day (minimum) for Scott. Even on his best days he probably accumulated 5-6 bags minimum. Any physical activity would generally make this mucus loosening worse. The irony of it all is that the mucus leaving his system was a good thing. It meant he could (usually) breath a little better. Now if that's happening even without physical exercise let's address what our teens do.\n\nIn Five Feet Apart our teens do all of the following: run up and down 3-5 flights of stairs, laugh, swim, cry and a multitude of other things. Not once during these activities does mucus play a part. They are described as out of breath and coughing but no description of the ick factor that is so common for those with CF. Why? I assume because it's not pretty, elegant or romantic. Imagine an entire Harry Potter movie of Ron belching the slugs and knowing it's NOT CG. Disgusted? Likely. That is how I've always imagined Scott felt (I couldn't ask him as that movie scene came years after his passing).\n\nClapping\n\nClapping is when someone else helps a CF patient to gain their breathe or dislodge mucus. It involves specifically hitting them between the shoulder blades and on the front of their chest with both hands, and with a certain amount of force. My understanding is that it is still common today. This doesn't happen even once during Five Feet Apart. Even a nurse doing it to another patient or a parent or friend asking if they can help could have happened. Instead it's completely ignored. Scott's friends, family and teachers all knew how to do this. There wasn't anyone who was close to him who didn't do this for him; in addition to patting his back and rubbing it in circles to help him calm and regain his breath.\n\nMasks, Masks & More Masks\n\nWhenever I visited Scott in the hospital; be it early on (years prior) or in the last few months of his death there was always one thing that was a constant. Masks. We all wore them. Not just the CF patients. And if you were at the hospital in the CF/Respiratory ward you were usually interrogated by a nurse in advance of entering a CF patient's room. They wanted to know when you last had a cold/flu or felt a bit off. If you weren't feeling all that great that day you'd be sent home. No chances were taken that you would pass on a flu or cold or something worse to a hospitalized CF patient. While masks play a role in Five Feet Apart they sure do seem to be conveniently left behind a good 80% of the time. I guess they aren't sexy enough.\n\nThe Drugs and Treatments\n\nI cannot speak to the current drugs or treatments that exist for CF these days. So I could be in left-field here (however I take anxiety drugs and have a chronic pain condition, so I'm doubting much has changed); but anytime you have many drugs involved in your system there are side effects. Not even once does Lippincott mention the side effects of the drugs. None of our teens seem to experience urgency to urinate, constant thirst, dry mouth, digestive issues, headaches, dizziness, increased chest pain, etc. And that is just a small snippet of the side effects many of the drugs can cause. I remember days where Scott would tell us the side effects of the drugs were wearing him down faster than his limited breathing.\n\nNutrition\n\nIt's unbelievable to me that our teens are constantly enjoying pudding and milkshakes; yet no one discusses the nutritional issues that CF usually comes with. While our teens have feeding bags at night, I never felt like it was well explained or described why (and certainly none of them seem to have the nausea that generally comes with feeding bags). I believe a critical part of treating and understanding CF is nutrition. Absorption of nutrition and vitamins is usually low in CF patients; and my friend was no exception. He never had caffeine, high sugar items (ie: candy, slurpees, chocolate, etc.), or chips. What he did always have was carrots, Gatorade, grapes, cheese strings and jerky. Those happened to be his favourites. And so it bugs me a lot that the teens seem to eat anything they want with no consideration for nutrition. Now maybe because they are hospitalized and on bags it's okay? I don't know except that it stood out to me.\n\nWhy is Reality Not Enough?\n\nOne thing I continue to struggle with understanding is why reality is not enough for these types of books? Why must authors include more tragic events around our suffering characters? There are no less than 3 MAJOR moments in this book where things are revealed or happen that could easily have been removed and the book would still be tragic and romantic. Just add in any of the discussions or items above instead of those 3 major moments. The need to go 'over the top' is such a Hollywood trait and I hate how it's translated to influence today's fiction. I'd be okay with the same romance story and dynamic between our teens without the 'extra' tragedy. Let the disease itself be awful enough; because in real life it is more than enough to deal with.\n\nOverall\n\nI'm sure I'm missing dozens of other things to point out and I would encourage everyone with interest to read more about CF from reliable health sites. There are also lots of sites, stories and social media written by first-hand CF sufferers that will be far more meaningful than my thoughts and comments.\n\nUnfortunately I have my doubts that the movie will be any better. Based on the trailer I've seen it might be worse. While I do appreciate that a book was written where the teens have CF. I just wish it was a little more on par with real life. This doesn't seem like too much to ask does it?\n\nFinally let me recommend a book that two years ago made me think of Scott (even though it's not CF related). It's a contemporary teen story about death and loss. The Start of Me and You by Emery Lord is a realistic and moving look at death. It made me laugh, cry and cry some more; and not in a glossy, hyped or over the top way. Instead Lord addresses the intricacies and messiness of mortality in a genuine and heartwarming way. I'd really like to see more realistic contemporary stories like Lord wrote. I wish Lippincott had captured more of the reality and less of the teen puppy romance.\n\nReview dedicated to my friend Scott. You are never forgotten my friend and always cherished. May the notes of your clarinet be clear and constant, always. ~Mel\n\nPlease note: I received an eARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. This is an honest and unbiased review.\n\nSeptember 18, 2019\n\n4 stars\n\n\"If I'm going to die, I'd like to actually live first.\"\n\nEarlier this year, I went to the movies and saw 'Five Feet Apart'. I usually hate seeing a movie before reading the book, but I went anyway. I really enjoyed the movie and decided to check out the book. The wait for the audio book with my library was a mile long, but eventually, it was my turn to listen. Now, it's been several months since I've watched the film, but this movie adaptation was pretty darn spot on from what I remember. Listening to this book, I could just see the film play out in my head, which was really cool.\n\nThis is a heartfelt and emotional read that will pull right on your heartstrings. It's a powerful story of living life to your fullest and falling in love. It made me think, feel, and brought so much awareness to what it's like to live with a chronic disease. As a nurse, I've seen a lot of this, but I think it's something regular healthy people don't think much about. I thought the book was really well done and it brought me to tears more than once. I highly recommend the audio book and the film, because I honestly liked it just as much!\n\nAugust 30, 2022\n\nThis book had me laughing, smiling , and crying all at the same time\n\nMarch 26, 2022\n\nI’m sorry, but did someone put a spell on me and made my heart into stone because it’s incapable of feeling any emotions right now?\n\nIt's such a bummer that this book has one of the prettiest covers that I've ever seen, yet it has the MOST CRAPPY AND CLICHÉ PLOT ever! Don't even get me started with these bidimensional characters (they're more bland than water, trust me). Not to mention the insta-love between Will and Stella, which was probably the root cause of all the wrong things in this book. They probably knew each other for what...a couple of weeks? Barely knew each other's favourite food yet somehow, they decided they fucking love each other sooooooooo freaking much that Stella was literally willing to die and forgo the life she could get just for this couple-of-weeks feeling that they called love. I called it s-t-u-p-i-d-i-t-y. And this whole idea of five feet apart would make you cry because again, it's plain stupid.\n\nLet's just hope that this is one of the rare instances where the movie is better than the book.\n\nNovember 28, 2022\n\n4 🌟 for all the characters and tears involved!\n\nI was definitely not expecting this story when o picked up this one.\n\nI don't know as well as I do know why I kept comparing this one with The Fault in Our Stars movie (sorry to say that I haven't read the book by John Green yet, forgive me) and yes, somehow it reminded me of Turtles All The Way Down by John Green here and there.\n\nThough the health issues involved are totally different, set in different surroundings I just couldn't help comparing this one with that movie and that book as I kept on reading.\n\nBut I am so glad I love this one much, much better than I already thought I would👍\n\nThe main themes tackled in the plot involves cystic fibrosis, lifelong treatment, deaths, divorce & young adult romance.\n\nI so loved all the characters no matter how perfect and imperfect they were.\n\nStella is still a real sensation in my head. A youtuber who reaches out to the rest of the world sharing about the condition and keeping updates as she goes on struggling with the frequent hospital stay and vigorous treatment routine.\n\nWill, the boy who has no desire to please his mom or anyone; the boy who is just so ready to break all the rules just to 'live more'.\n\nThen there's Poe. My favorite character. I had a really hard time dealing with his sweetness & just being him!\n\nHow I wish he was there till the end.... He broke my heart.\n\nAbby, Stella's sister. Though she wasn't physically present in the story, she is the character that you can really feel the presence in a way that shapes the main character.\n\nStella's parents. The characters are a bit detached as opposed to what they should have been. The most nonconvincing characters in the story.\n\nHowever, the character of Will's mother was far better represented.\n\nBut the character that really stood out were the nurses Berda and Julie. I loved them so damn much!!!\n\nSo basically I liked this book solely regarding the characters.\n\nI didn't enjoy the writing style. The flow was haphazard. The only thing that made me continue reading till the end was my own curiosity as to what happens to Stella and Will as CF patients.\n\nIt ended well on a positive, hopeful note.\n\nA really good one time read.\n\nOh Poe!\n\n*I need to watch the movie adaptation! Cole Sprouse, WAIT FOR MEEEEE🤒\n\nWatched the movie today. Thought I would only watch it cos he's hot. And damn, he's so messed up hot. And yes, ended up crying feeling like... damn, he's hot. No, the movie is good. But the whole time I was crying for something else, I was still thinking 'he is hot' and then 'can he just stop being hot for like 1 second?!'\n\nMy tears have never been blinded by someone this hot. And ugh, he's my fictional character hotter than I had imagined.\n\n*When was he the hottest?\n\n😭 The last scene. He looked like the galaxy stealing away my galaxy, like the star shower when he was tearing up and then he left me blind taking my whole galaxy away when he left.\n\nShit.\n\nOctober 5, 2018\n\nI like the idea here: exploring the complications of being a young person living with CF. But a queer person of colour dies quite randomly from CF complications right after deciding to get back together with the love of their life and that death motivates one of the protagonists to start living for themselves. It just doesn't sit right. I'm going to let these thoughts steep and possibly come back and update this, but my gut reaction upon finishing this is an icky feeling.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nWant to read\n\nJuly 20, 2019\n\nThis book is literally a ‘honey trap’ as we say in clandestine service. Who the hell is ‘we’?? Anywhooo. The movie is coming out next year and they cast Cole Sprouse??\n\nYou mean Cole Sprouse?\n\nCOLE fucking SPROUSE?\n\nYEP ladies and gentlemen,\n\nit’s COLE SPROUSE.\n\nI wonder why they didn’t name the book Honey Trap Alert and be done with it??\n\nPS. I always have him pegged as Noah fucking Shaw but I guess we’ll have to share now since he’ll be in this...\n\nMarch 29, 2023\n\n3.50 ⭐\n\nNgl I had higher expectations for this novel bcz I absolutely adored the movie. Regardless, it was still a short and sweet read :)\n\nDecember 20, 2018\n\nDNF at 30%\n\nReading this you realise this was written only to get money from moviegoers, or teenagers that like to read the book first and then see the movie.\n\nThe writing is mediocre at best, and the story itself is just a typical YA tearjerker. We as YA readers are so over these types of books. The book has to have more in it then just a novelization of the movie.\n\nSorry, we are not stupid.\n\nApril 19, 2020\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n* um, so this started okay for me, not gonna lie\n\n* there’s CF (cystic fibrosis) rep, so that’s always a good thing, to have more books with disability rep; however, i can’t say if it’s good rep, so bear that in mind\n\n* the writing, while nothing groundbreaking, was… not horrible?\n\n* it’s a short, easy book to read\n\n* howEVER\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n* hooooo boi\n\n* i’m gonna spoil this shit, i’m sorry, but I have to\n\n* for the love of all that is holy and pure, stop killing kids in books just for the sake of shock value\n\n* especially since you’re killing off The Only POC and Gay Kid\n\n* just… no\n\n* also, if we can stop having books that romanticise illnesses, that’s be swell? and like… stop with this narrative of “living your life instead of having your illness dictate it” and “being reckless because you’re IN LOVE™ with a person you’ve met like 2 weeks ago”\n\n* staaaaahhppppp with this shit\n\n* you can 100% live your life even if you’re not able and sending a message to kids and teens that you can’t is just… very harmful, imo\n\n* also, cut it out with the gay best friend trope, it’s… 2020\n\n* it’s instalove, it falls completely into the “sick-girl love story” and it annoyed me SO MUCH\n\n* the characters are super one dimensional: Stella is a type A personality that needs to control everything and Will is the Rebel™ that says a big “fuck you” to the illness and they were both just defined by their illness and very little more\n\n* i threw it the fuck away when i finished it\n\nYAY or NAY: there are much, MUCH better books out there, pass on this\n\n��\n\nTo everyone who got this far, thank you for reading and have a wonderful day! Also, feel free to share your thoughts, comment or tell me anything :)"
