        "text": "2023 James T. Neubacher Award Recipient\n\nPam McGuinty\n\nPam McGuinty is a Budget Analyst in the College of Engineering and has worked at the University for over 23 years. She has a BBA in Accounting and Financial Reporting from the University of Michigan – Dearborn. When asked about her work in disability Pam might mention that she was a member of the Student IDEA board in 2019, a past board member of the Disability Network of Michigan, and is currently the Chair of the Council for Disability Concerns.\n\nHowever, Pam's active participation in various disability advocacy groups and her integral contributions actually touch almost every corner of campus from improving access to physical spaces to ensuring attention is given to virtual spaces. Pam's mentorship has been transformational for many, helping individuals grow into their disability identities and empowering them to become advocates in their own right. Her unwavering support for inclusion efforts within DC@U-M and her willingness to champion disability inclusion events and spaces such as the Toward an Anti-Ableist Academy Conference, Detroit Disability Pride, a Disability Culture Center, and University's 2034 and 2050 focus groups.\n\nWith a career marked by excellence and an advocacy journey defined by her commitment to inclusivity, Pam McGuinty stands as an inspiring figure in the field of disability advocacy.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nPetra Kuppers\n\nAnita Gonzalez Collegiate Professor of Performance Studies and Disability Culture,\n\nProfessor of English Language and Literature,\n\nProfessor of Women's and Gender Studies, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,\n\nProfessor of Art, Penny W Stamps School of Art and Design,\n\nProfessor of Theatre and Drama and Professor of Dance, School of Music, Theatre & Dance\n\nDr. Petra Kuppers is a disability culture activist and a community performance artist; Artistic Director of The Olimpias, an international disability culture collective; and co-creator of Turtle Disco, a somatic writing studio. She is the Anita Gonzalez Collegiate Professor of Performance Studies and Disability Culture at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a 2023 Guggenheim Fellow. Her academic books include Disability and Contemporary Performance: Bodies on Edge (2003), The Scar of Visibility: Medical Performance and Contemporary Art (2007), Find a Strange and Twisted Shape: Disability Culture and Community Performance (2011), and Eco Soma: Pain and Joy in Speculative Performance Encounters (2022). Her website is www.petrakuppers.com\n\nJennifer Kerns\n\nAdjunct Clinical Instructor in Dentistry,\n\nDepartment of Community Based Dental Education, School of Dentistry\n\nDirector of Health Initiatives, United Way of NW MI\n\nDr. Jennifer Kerns has spent over 25 years developing programs for the dentally underserved, including U of M’s own Victors for Veterans Free Dental Program. Passionate about oral health in relation to one’s overall health and quality of life, Jen is the founder of a new and innovative dental care delivery model in Traverse City called UNITED WE SMILE. As a PA 161 dental hygienist, Jen worked out of a mobile dental van but struggled to find dentists in her area who were comfortable treating patients with IDD. That’s when Jen decided to switch gears and work to improve access to dental care long-term.\n\nThrough a new partnership with the University of Michigan and support from the United Way of NW MI, Jen wrote numerous grants to renovate a 15,000 sq ft building into a $2.3million teaching facility to train future dentists how to provide dental care for those unserved who live with special healthcare needs. In just six short months, on September 5th, the clinic opened and over 20 local dentists signed up to volunteer as Adjunct Clinical Instructors to oversee UMSD pre-doctoral dental interns providing free dental care.\n\nMonday-Thursday is free for pre-cooperative children, pregnant women, and those with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Fridays are free for veterans as a continuation of the Victors for Veterans program. Local dentists volunteer in return for continuing education credits and dental interns provide the dental care. Jen strives to teach students how to work on challenging patients with a focus on behavior guidance. Jen believes that to help a patient, it is often more important to understand the person that has a specific disease, than understand the disease that a specific person has and she works to share that civic responsibility with 12 students every day as part of their graduation requirements.\n\nSince recently opening the clinic, students have already provided over $175,000 in free dental care. In her free time, Jen is enrolled in a fellowship for neurodevelopmental disabilities and consults for Thomas Judd HIV Care Center and the Northern Regional Bleeding Disorder Center at Munson Medical Center, as well as various national and community projects. Jen’s latest idea is to expand into an empty lot next door and build a dental surgery center with two additional floors to house dental students. Jennifer likes to quote Bryan Tervo, who said it best - “every accomplishment began with a decision to try”.\n\nElizabeth McLain (Alumnus - PhD in Musicology from U-M)\n\nCo-Director, Disability Studies, Virginia Tech\n\nPostdoctoral Associate, Academy of Transdisciplinary Studies and the Institute for Creativity, Arts, & Technology, Virginia Tech\n\nAlum, PhD in Musicology, SMTD, University of Michigan\n\nDr. Elizabeth McLain's lived experience as a chronically ill rollator-wielding autistic compels her to transform music scholarship through the principles of disability justice. She serves as co-chair of the Music and Disability Study Group of the American Musicological Society, a professional and verified member of RAMPD: Recording Artists and Music Professionals with Disabilities, and a professional member of the Recording Academy. She co-founded and co-directs the Disability Community Technology Center with Ashley Shew thanks to a generous grant from the Mellon Foundation, which includes disabled artist residencies and Open the Gates Gaming, a research initiative increasing access to tabletop roleplaying games through cognitive access tools and adventures that empower everyone to tell their stories.\n\nMcLain's research on disability culture and the arts has an (auto)ethnographic bent, capturing an insider’s perspective on the creative lives of disabled artists. With the support of an NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant and an ACLS Digital Justice Seed Grant, her a2ru’s Ground Works team is documenting the inaugural CripTech incubator with an emphasis on ethical consent processes and access. For too long, disabled people have been treated as objects of study rather than generators of knowledge. The resulting scholarship on disabled artistic practice portrayed disability as a curiosity, an object of pity, or an obstacle to overcome. When disabled artists reclaim the narrative, the result is transformative. They reveal disability as creativity, innovation, community, and a culture all its own. McLain hopes that by amplifying the stories of the CripTech artists, it will add to the growing movement to center disabled voices until “Nothing About Us Without Us” is not just a rallying cry but a reality for the disability community in the arts, education, and beyond.\n\nFeranmi Okanlami\n\nHead of Disability Services\n\nAssistant Professor of Family Medicine\n\nAssistant Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Assistant Professor of Urology, Medical School\n\nDr. Feranmi Okanlami is Assistant Professor of Family Medicine, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, and Urology at the University of Michigan, as well as Interim Director of Services for Students with Disabilities, Division of Student Life; Director of the Adaptive Sports & Fitness program in the Division of Student Life; Director of Adaptive Sports for the Michigan Center for Human Athletic Medicine & Performance; and Spokesperson for Guardian Life Equal & Able Partnership.

He has been a member of the CIL board since 2020.\n\nMelissa Sreckovic\n\nAssociate Professor of Education\n\nDirector Academic Program, College of Arts and Sciences, The University of Michigan-Flint\n\nDr. Melissa Sreckovic is an associate professor of special education and director of the Honors Program at the University of Michigan-Flint. Dr. Sreckovic’s research interests center on identifying and examining the efficacy of strategies for fostering inclusive spaces for individuals with disabilities in school and community settings, with a specialized focus in autism spectrum disorder. Dr. Sreckovic spearheaded Officer Friendly Day, an annual event at the University of Michigan-Flint, which brings together autistic individuals and their families and local law enforcement officers to build positive relationships and increase the safety of autistic individuals in the communities in which they live, learn, and grow. She also co-hosts Inclusive Halloween, another annual event at the University of Michigan-Flint, which brings together over 250 university and community volunteers and over 450 community members to celebrate Halloween in a judgment free, accessible space.\n\nDr. Sreckovic and her research team are currently working on a project examining the impact of sensory bags when utilized by law enforcement officers during public safety interactions with autistic individuals. When working with pre-service or in-service teachers, P-12 students, collaborating with colleagues, providing professional development, or presenting at conferences, her fervent commitment to inclusivity resonates with everyone. Dr. Sreckovic is passionate about inclusion and has become a trusted mentor and advocate, and hopes to inspire a new generation of inclusion champions.\n\nMichael McKee\n\nAssociate Professor of Family Medicine\n\nAssociate Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Medical School\n\nDr. Michael McKee is a family physician with clinical and research expertise in disability health.

Neubacher Award Recipient - JILL SKLAR\n\nJill Sklar, the Administrative Director for Capacity Management at Michigan Medicine, has had an immeasurable impact on the lives of disabled communities around the country. Her work highlights a commitment to empowerment, advocacy, accessibility, making her well deserving of this year’s James T. Neubacher Award.\n\nBased on her own lived experiences, and recognizing the needs of more than 25 million Americans, Jill initiated and championed an effort to ensure the passage of the Restroom Access Act. The Act allows individuals who have a greater reliance on a restroom to use an “employee only” restroom in a business that is open to the public as long as there are two or more individuals who are working at the same time. The law further protects business owners by including liability under what would normally be covered by OSHA or other workplace laws, and ensures compliance by fining business owners who deny restroom access to patrons with a doctor’s note. Because the bill was written with input from Jill, it was created with an intentional lens on disability, working to address a specific need identified by the disabled community. Despite support from her representatives, senators, and the Retailers Association of Michigan, Jill had to spend seven years writing, advocating, and fighting for the Act to finally get passed on December 20, 2008.\n\nJill’s work is not limited to Michigan. Since the passage of Michigan’s act, Jill has worked with the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation to assist other state chapters across the country in passing similar laws. Now, bills modeled after Jill’s Restroom Access Act have been enacted in 20 states, providing bathroom access to millions of people and making all public activities (like shopping) more accessible. Additionally, Jill wrote a book titled “The First Year: Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis” aimed at people who have been recently diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) (a diagnosis encompassing both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). The book covers topics like assembling a healthcare team, workplace and public laws, living daily life, and learning to accept the challenges that come with the diagnosis. Because the vast majority of medical literature about IBD is written by gastroenterologists and other medical professionals, Jill’s book provides a unique and valuable viewpoint: that of a patient. By sharing her own experiences with Crohn’s disease alongside her medical expertise, Jill’s book provides a comprehensive and compassionate resource for people navigating an often oppressive and dismissive medical system. Jill inspires and empowers people to improve their health and wellness through education and systemic reform. Thanks to Jill’s willingness to share her stories and her legal advocacy, the world is a more accessible place.\n\n2022 Honorable Mention\n\nAMAL ALHOSBAN\n\nAn associate professor in computer science at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus, Dr. Amal Alhosban has spent her career increasing the accessibility of computer programs for students. Her most recent project, in partnership with Durant-Tuuri-Mott Elementary School, focused on designing computer applications for disabled students in K-12 schools that provided support in everyday activities. These apps helped students navigate their education, health, transportation options, shopping lists, and more. Amal’s other projects have had a similar focus using technology to make systems and information more accessible. Amal worked with Amtrak to make their ticket booking system more accessible, contributed to wheelmap.org to help wheelchair users navigate accessible sidewalks, and created a comprehensive scheduling and communication application to help people with learning disabilities monitor their educational progress in higher education settings.\n\nCORINNE BASLER\n\nU-M Alum Corinne Basler is a national leader in the disability scene. As the mother of a blind son, Corinne has spent much of her life raising awareness and advocating for accessibility and child welfare. Her hard work and dedication can be seen in the numerous leadership positions she has held. She was previously the vice chair of Boston Children’s Hospital Trust, a past board member of Cradles to Crayons, and currently serves as a US Board member of Save the Children. Additionally, she is the Chair and has served on the Board of Perkins School for the blind for almost 20 years, where she led a capital campaign to build a new technology building and student center, bringing computers to the school’s campus for the first time. In addition, she oversaw the creation of “Perkins Access”, which serves as a resource for the design and creation of accessible websites for all organizations.\n\nELLEN RAMBO\n\nEllen Rambo is a Training Specialist Associate who is passionate about accessibility for all. Her passion has led her to take on an informal role in Organizational Learning as the \"\"go-to\"\" person for all things related to accessibility within her unit, going above and beyond what is expected or required of her. Ellen works hard to keep accessibility front and center when the Organizational Learning team develops new training programs and support resources. She actively seeks out new ideas around accessibility, and has compiled information from a variety of research and experts, including the UM Accessibility Team. Moreover, Ellen models accessibility all the time so others can learn from her actions. With her knowledge and the connections she has built, Ellen has been instrumental in re-designing current training resources to be more accessible.\n\nLAURA YAKAS\n\nDr. Laura Yakas has been described by her nominators as a visionary scholar, educator, activist, advocate, and performer. As a LEO Lecturer at the School of Social Work, Dr. Yakas goes above and beyond accessibility and ensures that her classrooms are affirming of disability and neurodiversity. . Her curriculums delve into topics of anti-saneism and Mad Pride, as well as their connections to other forms of anti-oppressive movements. She teaches a healing-centered pedagogy, and loves to facilitate transformative courses with a focus on promoting mental health care without stigma, punishment, or incarceration. Outside of the classroom, Dr. Yakas is an outspoken advocate for Mad Pride and disability justice. She educates her peers and supervisors on how to foster a neurodiversity-affirming mindset in classrooms. She also enjoys writing and performing radical musical comedy – because making fun of the world is a way to transform it!\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE\n\nDr. Michael McKee is the Director of MDisability, a group that focuses on all aspects of improving the lives of persons with disabilities – clinical, educational, scholarly, community and policy-based, in primary care. He also serves as the co-director of the Center for Disability Health & Wellness, which aims to develop and apply innovative research, clinical, and educational strategies to address inequities in healthcare access, quality, and outcomes experienced by disabled individuals. While his work covers a broad swatch of disability issues, he has a particular focus on Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. He developed a model Deaf Health Clinic, provides ongoing monthly Deaf and hard-of-hearing community talks on various health topics and launched an ASL course for first-year medical students that covers communication as well as legal and cultural issues related to caring for Deaf patients. Dr. McKee’s investment in the disability and healthcare spaces has earned him recognition from both his students and his peers, who appreciate both his professional accolades and the personal respect and intentionality he brings to client care.\n\nPRINT ACCESSIBILITY TASK FORCE\n\nThe Print Accessibility Task Force is made up of eight members from across the University. Together, bringing a variety of experiences and expertise, they developed guidelines for creating more accessible print communications. Given the University’s focus on web accessibility, print communications could easily have been overlooked, but this team ensures that Michigan’s print communications are available to everyone. In cooperation with the Equity, Civil Rights, and Title IX Office, and other campus experts, the Print Accessibility Task Force has suggestions and processes for converting design files to ADA-compliant PDFs, colorblind-friendly palettes for data visualization, and much more. The Task Force also works to ensure that the University community understands and implements the suggestions they’ve compiled. They have plans to host workshops in the future aimed at University communicators, and have worked hard to spread the word about accessible print communication. (The task force is comprised of Betsy Brown - Assistant Vice President for Marketing Communications, Martin Soave - Brand Identity Manager/Art Director, Jenna Smallidge - Graphic Design Coordinator, Phil Deaton - Digital Information Accessibility Coordinator, Carla Campbell - Research Technician, Jenna Tyson - Multimedia Designer, Melanie DelVecchio - Brand Strategist, Mathias-Philippe Badin - Creative Design Manager)\n\nUMAISE\n\nThe University of Michigan Adaptive and Inclusive Sports Experience (UMAISE) provides a variety of recreational opportunities for the disabled community, including everything from martial arts to adaptive fishing. Their offerings cover traditional sports, like basketball and tennis, as well as unique opportunities for both leisure and exercise like adaptive tree climbing. Serving over 200 people, these programs advance the rights and visibility of disabled people and ensure that disabled athletes have a safe space to enjoy a healthy lifestyle. The UMAISE team works hard year-round to make these programs successful, striving to grow the program and continuing to offer new sports and recreational activities each season. And their work doesn’t end at the edge of campus; UMAISE has also worked with Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation and the City of Troy to help them expand programming that is inclusive and fun.\n\nCongratulations to the 2020 James T. Neubacher Award Recipient - Christa Moran\n\nThe virtual award presentation is Thursday, Oct. 29, at 2:30 p.m. and will feature Certificates of Appreciation to 13 additional nominees. All are welcome to attend via this Zoom webinar.\n\nSee a PDF of the Neubacher Award Presentation Program.\n\nChrista Moran has always had an interest in helping others. Growing up in a family of medical care professionals, family dinner discussions often focused on patients and their care.\n\nWhen she heard about the claims of a deaf man’s family — that he died of cancer after a medical facility failed to give him a sign language interpreter, which kept him from fully understanding his cancer diagnosis — a light bulb went off in Moran’s head.\n\n“It was something that just hit me. This is something that I need to do,” she said. “I need to put together all the areas I feel I have skills in and a passion for and do it. I threw myself into getting the training to be an interpreter.”\n\nAfter intensive medical interpreter training and years of fieldwork, Moran is a supervising staff interpreter and trainer of medical interpreters at University of Michigan Hospital and this year’s James T. Neubacher Award recipient.\n\nRead more about Christa Moran in the University Record.\n\n2020 Certificate of Appreciation Recipients\n\nEthriam Cash Brammer\n\nAs Assistant Dean at Rackham Graduate School, Ethriam recently led the Rackham Graduate Student with Disability Needs Assessment Committee, the first of its kind at U-M, and nationally.

Greden\n\nFounding Executive Director of the U-M Comprehensive Depression Center and Rachel Upjohn Professor of Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences\n\nDr. Greden has served the University of Michigan with distinction since 1974, where he was Chair of the Department of Psychiatry for over 22 years. Dr. Greden had long been recognized as an exemplary leader in depression research, treatment, and education, but it is his vision and foresight in proposing and implementing bold approaches and national strategies that truly set him apart.\n\nIn 1999, following a sabbatical, Dr. Greden boldly proposed to the University of Michigan leadership the creation of an interdisciplinary prototype center of excellence devoted to depressive illnesses. This Center, which was approved by the Regents in November of 2001, is dedicated to accelerating progress in diagnosing and treating depression by maximizing integrative research, minimizing clinical fragmentation, coordinating care, translating advances into communities, and fighting stigma with visibility and public presence.\n\nAs Executive Director, Dr. Greden has led the Center in pursuit of an ambitious mission. Specifically, the University of Michigan Depression Center has been working since 2001 to usher in a new era depression care, characterized by: a focus on prevention, an emphasis on earlier detection and true remission, the abolishment of stigma, and an informed and empowered public. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Greden has brought together over 150 depression researchers and clinicians from the University of Michigan medical and academic campus including the Departments of Family Medicine, Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology, Psychiatry, Geriatrics, Cancer, Cardiology, Women's Health, as well as Psychology, Public Health, Social Work, Pharmacy, Nursing, and the Life Sciences Initiative. This synergy of scholarly activity continually inspires the investigation and introduction of new research and treatment strategies.\n\nNot content with his remarkable accomplishment in opening a $42 million state-of-the art Depression Center at the University of Michigan, Dr. Greden has sought to replicate the model of this one center on a national level. Against a backdrop of skepticism, John Greden proposed the formation of a National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC). The vision, determination, and perseverance that saw this effort come to fruition cannot be underestimated. In October of 2006, Dr. Greden sought endorsement from the U-M Depression Center’s National Advisory Board to mobilize this national initiative.\n\nIn April of 2007, Dr. Greden brought together representatives from fifteen of the nation’s other leading academic departments of psychiatry and presented a credible and persuasive plan to launch a national network of centers of excellence. In 2008, the charter for the NNDC was ratified by sixteen institutions in what was truly a historic moment for the field of mental health. The impact cannot be overstated. The mission of the NNDC is “to improve the quality, effectiveness, and availability of depression and bipolar illness diagnosis, treatment and prevention so people can live better lives.” As with the University of Michigan Depression Center, a multi-disciplinary approach is one of the key principles of the network.\n\nRead the University Record announcement.\n\n2012 - Professor Samuel Bagenstos\n\nProfessor Bagenstos is a faculty member at the U-M Law School and specializes in civil rights law, public law, and litigation. He has served in the United States Department of Justice where his major accomplishments included the promulgation of the 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations, the first comprehensive update of those regulations since the original 1991 version.\n\nProfessor Bagenstos also pushed for intensified enforcement of the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C., which guarantees people with disabilities the right to live and receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate. In his “spare time,” Professor Bagenstos remains an active appellate and Supreme Court litigator in civil rights and federalism cases, including the constitutionality of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nProfessor Bagenstos has also testified before Congress on several occasions, including in support of the Fair Pay Restoration Act, the ADA Amendments Act, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination, as well as on the application of the ADA to advancing technology and the problem of mental illness in prisons.\n\n2011 - Richard Bernstein\n\nRichard Bernstein is a tireless advocate for disabled rights and providing a voice to those who would otherwise be forced to be silent.\n\nBlind since birth, Richard is a graduate of the University of Michigan and Northwestern University School of Law. He is an attorney with the Bernstein Law Firm in Farmington Hills, Michigan.\n\nRichard is committed to taking action to help clients who need him. He successfully partnered with the United States Department of Justice to force the City of Detroit to fix broken wheelchair lifts on its buses. He also is working to affect change at Detroit Metro Airport to make the airport more accessible for disabled fliers. He fought the State of Michigan and won to preserve special education funding throughout the state.\n\nFurther, Richard represented the Paralyzed Veterans of America in an action against the University of Michigan’s plans for disabled seating in Michigan Stadium with the United States Department of Justice and represented disabled residents who sued the Oakland County (Michigan) Road Commission after “roundabout” traffic circles were built without disabled access.\n\nRichard serves on the Board of Directors for several not-for-profit organizations and teaches a political science course in social activism at the University of Michigan. He also served an eight-year term on the Board of Governors at Wayne State University in Michigan, elected by voters statewide, serving as Chair for the last two years of his term.\n\nHonors Richard has received include “Michiganian of the Year” by the Detroit News, one of Crain’s Detroit Business’ “40 Under 40” and recognition on worldwide television by CNN as a leader in keeping government honest. He is the recipient of the 2008 John W. Cummiskey Pro Bono Award from the State Bar of Michigan and was selected by The Young Lawyers Section of the State Bar of Michigan as the 2003– 2004 Regeana Myrick Outstanding Young Lawyer Award recipient for outstanding commitment to public service. Richard also was named a 2009 Leader in the Law by Michigan Lawyers Weekly and received the Tony Fillipis Award in 2010.\n\nIn his spare time, Richard is an avid runner, completing 14 marathons – including six New York City marathons – the Ironman triathlon in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho in 2008 and the Israman triathlon in Eilat, Israel in 2011.\n\n2010 - Barbara L. Kornblau\n\nDr. Kornblau is a leading advocate for inclusion of persons with disabilities in the recent racial/ethnic disparities sections of National Health Care Reform legislation. Prior to coming to UM-Flint as Dean she was Professor of Occupational Therapy for 15 years. She has hundreds of research publications, presentations, and letters to the editor, related to the ADA, the autism spectrum disorders, and multiple others issues impacting the disabled population.\n\nShe was a RWJ Health Policy Fellow, which facilitated her involvement in writing national health care reform legislation in Senator Tom Harkin's office. She has served as the President of the American Occupational Therapy Association, Chair of Board of Directors for Arthritis Foundation in Florida, and has practiced law with a specialty in special education/disability discrimination litigation, including the ADA and the Fair Housing and Rehabilitation Act. She has served as a Health Policy consultant to the Special Olympics International as\n\nGovernment Relations and Disability Policy. She is a member of several NIH Consensus conferences related to disabilities including 2009 Taskforce on Childhood Motor Disorders, and the 2009 White House Round Table on Health Disparities in Health Reform representing disability disparity issues. She is Board Certified in Pain Management, and Disability Analysis (ABDA). She is a sought after speaker, lecturer, consultant, board member, author throughout the USA for her expertise, unwavering committment to the health promotion and fair treatment of persons with disabilities across the wide range of social, psychological, legal and physical factors that limit access to services. She has more than 20 years of clinical practice as an occupational therapist, along with a long history of academic appointments.\n\nSince she has been Dean of the School of Health Professions and Studies on the Flint campus, she has become a visible spokesperson for issues related to the underserved and recently amassed contributions of thousands of t-ee shirts to be shipped to Haiti. To complement her national policy level endeavors, she also takes a personal interest in her community and mentors students and faculty members on the Flint campus who are pursuing research in the area of Disability Studies including fall prevention and physical activity. She is working closely with the Crime Foundation to develop a Health and Wellness Coalition for which Health Promotion for persons with disabilities will be a high priority. She is involved with the Genesee County Disability Network and the Valley Area Agency on Aging which now oversees disability services in Genesee County. She is active in the Disability Section of the American Public Health Association, as well as the American Association of Occupational Therapists.\n\n2009 - Tobin Siebers\n\nTobin Siebers is the V. L. Parrington Collegiate Professor in the U-M Department of English Language and Literature. He became an advocate of people with disabilities 10 years ago, when he wrote about his personal experience with polio. Entitled “My Withered Limb,” his essay circulated among academics and the disabled community. It lead to speaking engagements and launched Siebers 's involvement in the emerging academic field of disability studies – a field in which he is now considered a renowned pioneer.\n\nAt U-M, he teaches a course on disability studies and is the chair of the steering committee for the U-M Initiative on Disability Studies (UMInDS). The goal of UMInDS is to establish a degree-granting program that will advance knowledge about, by, and for people with disabilities and to promote their full and equal participation in society.\n\nSiebers individually advances knowledge about disability through his many published articles and through his latest book, Disability Theory. The book was released in the summer of 2008 and is a field-defining venture. Siebers’s academic research focuses on the way disabled people have been represented historically and culturally. He looks at what it means to be disabled, for both the individual and society. Part of what Siebers seeks to do in his research is to remove the stigmas surrounding people with disabilities. He uses positive language and wants to remove labels that would make anyone with any type of disability feel inferior.\n\nSiebers knows they can and do make a full contribution to society.\n\nWhat it means to be disabled has changed for Siebers personally. For example, he refuses to be called a “polio survivor” because that would imply that a disability is something that can be overcome if a person is strong enough or receives the right care. Instead, Siebers sees his disabled leg as part of his identity. As he wrote a decade ago, he is his withered limb.\n\nNot only has Tobin’s research helped promote acceptance and awareness of people with disabilities, he has helped form a group dedicated to advocacy.\n\nThe community of academics who are committed to studying disability are also passionate about changing society and working with members of the disabled community to do so. Tobin himself is committed to fighting for equal access and equal rights so that, as he says, we can make this world a better place.\n\nThrough Tobin¹s connections, personal experience, talent for writing, and academic expertise, he is in a great position to advocate for the civic equality of the disabled, and he continues to do so.\n\nThanks to Dean Derek Collins for the above information.\n\n2008 Gary L. Talbot\n\nGary Talbot’s story is one that could only happen in America. He dropped out of high school before graduating and became a gifted auto mechanic working for Honda for several years. After being in an accident, Gary became a wheelchair user. He established an auto repair shop in Ann Arbor, which was the first time that he felt the sting of discrimination so common to people with physical restrictions.\n\nGary returned to Washtenaw Community College with the plan of qualifying for the University of Michigan. Although he had to begin at the lowest level, he qualified for Mechanical Engineering in only two years. After graduation from U-M, Gary went to work at General Motors in Willow Run, working on transmissions, which led to his heading up the GM Mobility Engineering, where a main concern was transportation for those in wheelchairs. After GM, Gary was employed by the Disney Corporation, where he worked on access to all rides in Disney facilities worldwide.\n\nAt this time, he was named to the U.S. Access Board by the President. Gary was then recruited to the Boston (MBTA) Transportation System to help achieve MBTA’s goal of providing a disability accessible transportation model for other large cities to follow.\n\nGary Talbot has devoted his career to making certain that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as people without disabilities, an effort that has improved the lives of countless individuals.\n\nCredit for the above information goes to Professor Bruce Karnopp, Arthur Thurnau Professor of Engineering, who nominated Gary for this award.\n\nView the 2008 Neubacher Award Ceremony video.\n\n2007 - Sarah \"Sadie\" Miro Wilcox\n\nSadie is a Master of Fine Arts candidate in the UM School of Art and Design. Her research and artwork take many different forms from painting and drawing and video, to developing a computer interface for disabled artists, to participating in disability studies and conferences. Severely injured in a house fire in 2002, Sadie herself is a tireless advocate for the disabled community, particularly burn survivors, and she herself is an inspirational model for others.\n\nHer long list of community service over the years is evidence of her commitment to helping others, but it is her ability to transform her experience and that of others that make her stand out. She uses video to create visual and physical illusions of impossible movement; for instance, in one piece she appears to traverse a cage‑like room by walking on both her hands and feet simultaneously in a very slow and labored performance. Her pieces explore alternative types of motion. This semester she videotaped some spectacular footage of herself crawling, rolling, and running through a large, black gravity‑free space‑‑using this footage to great effect in several video installations to describe her own hospitalizations and dreams of mobility. She has received a number of grants to develop adapted technologies to enable people with spinal cord injuries to create art on a computer. Sadie has volunteered at\n\nThe Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, established by Paul Neuman. She worked as an art instructor at a children's home in Capetown South Africa. She regularly attends burn survivor conferences and is invited to speak at both national and international disability conferences. Sadie by any measure is an outstanding artist, student, and citizen who works wholeheartedly and tirelessly on behalf of the disabled.\n\n2006 - Dennis Borel\n\nSince his appointment as executive director of the non-profit Coalition of Texans with Disabilities (CTD) in 2000, Dennis Borel (BBA '74, UM Council for Disability Concerns Certificate of Appreciation 2004)) has implemented a variety of innovative strategies that has resulted in not only removing legal and regulatory barriers to full participation in all aspects of the community but also shattered harmful stereotypes held by the general public. Founded in 1978, CTD is a statewide cross-disability advocacy organization controlled by people with disabilities. Despite the limitations of a small non-profit and operating in a very large state, CTD is a focal point for positive change under Dennis' direction. Several areas of progress have had national impact.\n\nSuccessfully convened an innovative round table seminar on personal attendant services. Building on the relationships from the round table, the State of Texas appropriated $150 million to increase wages for community attendants.\n\nUsing finance skills learned at the UM School of Business, Dennis teamed with an economist to create an alternative analysis of a Texas bill granting a tax credit for hiring people with disabilities, one that showed that revenues resulting from the new employees more than offset the tax credits. The bill was passed and created this employer incentive to hiring people with disabilities.\n\nDennis and other advocates promoted a plan for state funding to follow the person moving from an institution to the community. In 2005, Money Follows the Person was codified into state law. Over 10,000 people have used this mechanism to move to the community. The Texas plan has since become a model replicated in other states.\n\nDennis teamed with several users of power wheelchairs to remove the chairs from the motor vehicle code. Police had been using the code to issue tickets to people driving their chairs in the streets.\n\nTo improve accessibility of public transportation, Dennis created a legislative internship for a college student. The student, a person with a mobility impairment, succeeded in advocating for new legislation and now Texans with disabilities sit at the board table when decisions are made.\n\nDennis was the project director of the historic Team Everest 2003 expedition of people with disabilities. Over 250 media reports covered the expedition*s remarkable achievements. ABC World News Tonight called Team Everest the most inspirational of all. The Dallas Morning News wrote about Team Everest that it was the best thing any Texas group in any field had done that year. See a full report on Team Everest 2003. Dennis is also the producer of the recently completed documentary \"Shattering Stereotypes on Mt. Everest.\"\n\nDennis saved a program to help kids with disabilities live in families. The Texas Legislature cancelled funding for Family Based Alternatives, a small program that matched kids with disabilities in institutions with foster families. On Dennis' request, Governor Rick Perry restored full funding for Family Based Alternatives.\n\nDennis is a leader in advocacy efforts regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); developing bill language, finding bi-partisan sponsors to carry legislation to better protect Texans with disabilities. Filed amici briefs in several critical ADA cases.\n\nDennis is founder and project director of the Cinema Touching Disability Film Festival. Now in its third year, the Film Festival uses the media of motion pictures to improve perceptions and dispel common misperceptions that many people hold about disability. It is the first known disability film festival in Texas. More information is at www.ctdfilmfest.org.\n\nIn the 2004 interim, successfully worked with policymakers to restore over $175 million in scheduled community attendant care cuts, positively impacting 100,000 Texans with disabilities\n\nOne of the lead advocates in 2005, securing $300 M in new funds to reduce community service wait lists, the first funding in State history to address waiting lists.\n\nInitiated and passed HB2819 in 2005, a state bill improving accessibility of state websites, telecommunications and information technology.\n\nPromoting Help America Vote Act (HAVA); new federal law that makes it easier, faster, more secure for voters with disabilities to participate in this basic right privately. Monitoring and opposing voting legislation harmful to people with disabilities.\n\nCreated a breakthrough partnership with AARP on Livable Communities, a collaboration between advocates for people with disabilities and older Americans. Livable Communities combines local community organizing and technical assistance with state-level systems change advocacy. The goal is to influence community planning to allow people with disabilities of all ages to be mobile and actively engaged in all aspects of community life.\n\nDennis Borel has a strong track record of non-traditional partnerships and innovative problem-solving strategies that demonstrate that people with disabilities may be involved in all of society's endeavors. He has proven that a small disability organization can accomplish great achievements.\n\nLearn more about Dennis Borel and the CTD.\n\n2005 - Carey Larabee\n\nThe 16th Annual James Neubacher Award was presented to Carey Larabee. Carey graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Arts in Sports Management and Communication in 2002. For many students, faculty, and staff he was often the first student with quadriplegia they came into contact with. Carey is the type of student that left an impression on everyone he came into contact with. It is because of students like him that our student body challenged our university to address the needs of our students with disabilities in a more proactive manner.\n\nIn addition to his solid academic performance, Carey was also involved with various extracurricular activities. He represented UM at Sportscaster Camps of America; was an intern at WTKA Radio where he assisted in the production of “The Sports Beat” talk show; was a free-lance writer at The Wolverine, covering Big Ten softball tournament championships and UM women’s basketball games. But the experience that Carey pointed out as meaning the most to him was his involvement with Michigan from the Heart. He invested 6 years of service to this special program that took UM student-athletes to Mott’s Children’s Hospital for weekly visits.\n\n2004 - Mary Bushnell (Dekeon)\n\nMary Bushnell (Dekeon), a pediatric respiratory therapist, has been instrumental in establishing and working as a staff member at the University of Michigan's Trail's Edge Camp for children with special needs who are ventilator dependent. The entire camp is fully accessible—all buildings are flush with the ground—and loaded with adaptive technology, a benefit derived from working with the University of Michigan’s School of Architecture. Its graduate students have been involved for years in developing the camp’s adaptive technology and making it accessible to all the campers whether they are in wheelchairs or ambulatory. One of the biggest challenges the architecture graduate students recently solved was the design of an all accessible freestanding treehouse.\n\nIn the Trees\n\nThe $100,000 treehouse, which will be dedicated in June, is fully accessible to all the campers. Everyone enters the 32-x-12-foot structure the same way, via a harness that the campers use to lift themselves into the treehouse with a pulley system. When they reach the main platform, which is fully finished, the campers are transferred to a rail and chair system that allows those who use wheelchairs full access to the structure.\n\nOnce situated in the treehouse, the campers will find a space designed specifically for a kid or kid-at-heart. Several of the windows are made of the same kind of glass as that found in funhouse mirrors, distorting the outside view. There are kaleidoscopes, a water balloon launcher, and a bookcase full of material for quiet or rainy days.\n\nIt is not unusual for Trail’s Edge Camp to change the lives of the campers, making them more independent. But the camp has changed the lives of its volunteer staff as well.\n\nBushnell believes that working at the camp has changed her life and has continued to breathe new life into her career as a pediatric respiratory therapist at the University of Michigan Health System. “If you work in a pediatric intensive care unit as long as I have—which is more than 20 years—you get burned out on the tragedy and the sadness,” she says. “And I see the kids past that. When you see a baby with multiple anomalies, you say to yourself, ‘My god, why are we doing this?’ I know the answer why. And I guess that is the biggest thing of all: If you have a career in pediatric medicine, [the camp] will tell you why you’re doing it.”\n\n2003 - Christopher Savoie\n\nThe 14th Annual James Neubacher Award was presented to Christopher Savoie, a Certified Rehab Technology Supplier (CRTS) at the University’s Wheelchair Seating service. Chris is also a student at the University of Michigan, specializing in Kinesiology Movement Science.\n\nChris’s work, providing proper fit and maintenance for wheelchairs, is needed throughout the state, but few communities have such expertise. Chris recognized this need and volunteered to travel long distances, from Jackson to Marquette, to provide this much-needed service and save his clients the long and tiring trip to Ann Arbor. Chris also volunteers at Trails Edge Camp, a camp experience organized and offered by the University Health system for children on ventilators, most of whom use wheelchairs.\n\nIn 2003, Chris also traveled to North and South Vietnam with Wheels for Humanity, with 167 wheelchairs in tow. Using his vacation time and his own money, Chris not only fit adults and children with the proper wheelchairs, but he donated his own personal tools and taught the local Vietnamese therapists care and maintenance of the wheelchairs.\n\n2002 - Henry L. Kanar\n\nProfessor Henry Kanar (D.D.S. ’57) was chosen to receive the James Neubacher Award in recognition of the significant contributions he has made on behalf of people with disabilities. He has devoted his career to improving dental care for people with disabilities and to developing teaching methods to help dental professionals realize best practices for care provided to this population. In the 1960’s Dr. Kanar was Chief of Dental Services at the Plymouth State Home and Training Center, where he and his staff were responsible for the oral health care of over 1,000 residents and outpatients with developmental disabilities. After accepting a position in 1969 at the Institute for the Study of Mental Retardation and Related Disabilities (ISMRRD), he developed a unique dental program that was part of a comprehensive patient evaluation system for children and adolescents with disabilities.\n\nDr. Kanar also initiated the summer dental care program for children with disabilities at the Bay Cliff Health Camp in Big Bay, Michigan, a program that continues to involve dental students in serving the needs of this population. Over the years, many students reported that the week they spent on rotation at Bay Cliff was not only the best experience of their dental school career, but also the most meaningful experience of their lives. In addition to this innovative program, Dr. Kanar developed a post-graduate program for dental practitioners that was presented in many Michigan communities. With support from the American Association of Dentistry for the Handicapped, these one-and two-day programs were presented to private dentists and their staffs to help them gain knowledge of ways to improve the dental care provided to individuals with disabilities.\n\n2001 - Hilary U. Cohen and Sandy Ryder\n\nHilary Cohen and Sandy Ryder have made theater accessible to audiences and participants with disabilities as co-artistic directors of the Wild Swan Theater, which they founded in 1980. Wild Swan has developed an exemplary program to make productions and workshops accessible to children and teens who are deaf, blind, developmentally disabled, or have mobility impairments. Many performances have been offered that include pre-performance backstage touch tours that allow props, sets, and costumes to come alive for blind and visually impaired individuals. \"Audio description\" provides blind audience members a complete description of staging, which they hear over tiny receivers during pauses in the dialogue. Wild Swan has given 400 performances interpreted in American Sign Language, with the signing completely integrated into the dramatic production. A teacher's handbook and videotape have been developed to help teachers, parents, therapists, and youth leaders include people with disabilities in dramatic activities. More than 10,000 youth with disabilities have had creative experiences through Wild Swan's programs.\n\n2000 - Rachel Meredith Arfa\n\nAs President of the Hearing Impaired Student Organization, she procured funding from the Michigan Student Assembly to support the \"Open Caption Movie\" project, which shows first-run movies captioned for individuals with hearing impairments. Instrumental in the implementation of a program to offer courses in American Sign Language and deaf culture as part of the undergraduate curriculum. Driving force and coordinator of \"And You Can Quote Me on That: Students With Disabilities at the University of Michigan,\" a documentary video about the experiences of UM students who have a wide variety of disabilities. Instrumental in making the Center for Community Service accessible to students who use wheelchairs. Recipient of the Outstanding Student Leader Award in 1999 and 2000."
