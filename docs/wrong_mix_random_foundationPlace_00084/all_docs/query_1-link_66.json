        "text": "On a rainy morning a few weeks ago, I spoke before a crowd of City Council field representatives and other municipal employees who have to deal with the press, in Pasadena City Hall.\n\nWhat with all the pandemic protocols and the working from home, a person doesn’t get out much. I hadn’t been in those beautiful chambers in years, a place I used to haunt regularly as a reporter and a citizen.\n\nWhy, there was even a press box, where scribes got to sit and write, over to the side of the horseshoe where the electeds sit. During long evening meetings, journalists were welcome to come back through the hallowed rear doors and share in the members’ and staff’s dinner, and kind of wander around, looking for quotes.\n\nI don’t think they’d shoot you if you breached the inner sanctum now, but there might be some sergeant-at-arms action.\n\nAfter lamenting the state of the local media and whatnot for a bit, I turned to the assembled and asked them to do something for me: Get their bosses to reinstate the annual giving of the Arthur Noble Award to an outstanding citizen.\n\nAs our late, very great City Editor Janette Williams wrote a few years back, it was Pasadena’s own Nobel Prize, even with an Arthur attached at the top end, only a small change in the spelling of the last name.\n\nAfter that rich fellow gave a $10,000 endowment for costs involved in giving the prize in 1925 — a dinner; there was no cash outlay involved — it was awarded more or less every year until 1999. I saw more or less because in the ‘90s the whole thing devolved into a squabble. It’s very, very true that most of the early prizes went to White businessmen, and the few times they weren’t, it would be to a Mrs. Joseph Jones.\n\nBut that had changed, and the giving of the prize was moved from some kind of consensus vote of the old (all White, all male) Board of City Directors, as the council was known, to rotate among the now-diverse geographical council districts.\n\nThen there was a weird spurt of a couple of years where the good city burghers felt guilty for not being able to award it annually, and so they had multiples in a year.\n\nI walked over to the north wall of the council chambers and read from the list of the most recent recipients in ‘97, ‘98, ‘99. I knew them all, because we all knew each other back then. Dr. John Perkins of the Harambee Ministries. Peggy Phelps, arts leader and dear friend. Gretchen Sterling, who started and ran the Farmers Market. Don Wheeldin, the Black community activist who used to advise our underground paper when I was in high school. Marge Wyatt, the wonderful school board member. Bob Oliver, Caltech prof and city director. Dianne Scott of the Junior League. Raul Rodriguez, the finely flamboyant float designer. Joel Sheldon of Vroman’s.\n\nBut then I ran my fingers over the plaques from the ‘40s and while they may have been greats — Caltech founder Robert Millikan — they were also eugenicists — Robert Millikan. And then into the ‘60s and ‘70s, while good people, all White men: Arnold Beckman of Caltech; Lay Leishman, “Mr. Pasadena” and Rose Bowl booster; Bill Pickering, head of JPL; Louis Vincenti, big on redevelopment; Harold Jurgensen, gourmet grocer; Warren Dorn, “boy mayor” of Pasadena and then county supervisor; Orrin Fox, a mayor and car dealer; Max Colwell, general manager of the Tournament of Roses.\n\nAnyway, the thing fell apart, and it’s a ridiculous shame. Bring it back, City Council! The money is still in the kitty and giving out the Noble Award will be much more fun than balancing the budget.\n\nThe Noble is back in the news because another of the early White-guy recipients, Herbert Hahn, of the ancient and famed Hahn & Hahn law firm — now a majority woman- and minority-owned business! — was associated with a group I wrote about a few years ago that created the godawful racial covenants that segregated the city’s neighborhoods.\n\nI was sent an anonymous letter about former Mayor A.I. Stewart and his work with the (sic) Pasadena Improvement Association, and wrote about it, as did others. Now some want to take Hahn’s name off the plaque. I don’t know — fine with me. But how about reinstating the Noble as well? And how about this fine response from today’s H&H: “We unreservedly condemn Pasadena’s history of racist housing policies and our firm’s participation. Today, more than 85 percent of Hahn & Hahn personnel identify as female, BIPOC, and/or LGBTQ+.”\n\nWrite the public editor at lwilson@scng.com."
