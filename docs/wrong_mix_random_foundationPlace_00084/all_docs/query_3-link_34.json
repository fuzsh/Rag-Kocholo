        "text": "The European Union and the United Kingdom agreed a Trade & Cooperation Agreement which contains a Protocol on Social Security to take effect from 1st January 2021. The Protocol provides for a wide range of social security issues into the future. On the 31st December 2020, the Convention on Social Security agreed between Ireland and the United Kingdom was commenced. Together these Agreements ensure, that all existing social security arrangements for Irish & UK citizens are maintained into the future. Ireland as an EU Member State, will extend on a unilateral basis the advantages of the Convention to Union citizens, as required.\n\nWhere a person has been married or registered in a civil partnership more than once, the condition of being widowed or a surviving civil partner relates only to the last spouse or civil partner of the person. However, a person who is divorced from his or her spouse, or their civil partnership has been dissolved prior to death of spouse or civil partner, being a divorce or dissolution that is recognised as valid in the State, and had not remarried or entered into another civil partnership, will qualify as a widow/widower/surviving civil partner provided all other qualifying conditions are satisfied.\n\nFrom 4th of June 2024, any maintenance received for a child will be excluded from means for One Parent Family payment. However, all other maintenance, including spousal maintenance, will continue to be assessed in the normal manner. Housing costs for the benefit of child(ren) are also excluded. Vouched housing costs of up to €95.23 per week (rent or mortgage) may be offset against spousal maintenance payments, with half the balance of spousal maintenance being assessed as means in establishing the rate of One-Parent Family Payment due.\n\nA person must have the main care and charge of a child(ren). Generally speaking this means that a person must show that the child spends the greater amount of time (weekly) with the claimant. This aspect may have to be verified by a Social Welfare Inspector of the department. Under current legislation One-Parent Family Payment is not payable where a couple have joint equal custody of a child/ren.\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2009, an applicant for One-Parent Family Payment must be the parent, step-parent, adoptive parent or legal guardian of at least 1 relevant child, who normally resides with him or her.\n\nHowever, it is a qualifying condition for One-Parent Family Payment (as above) that, if a person is not the parent, step-parent or adoptive parent of at least 1 relevant child, they must be the legal guardian of that child. Simply being in receipt of Guardian’s Payment for a relevant child, does not necessarily mean that they are the legal guardian of that child.\n\nIf a person is in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment, marries or is in a civil partnership or remarries or is in a new civil partnership, entitlement to payment ceases as and from the date of marriage or civil partnership or remarriage or new civil partnership.\n\nA new statutory rental disregard of up to €269.23 per week (€14,000 per year) has been introduced and applies from the 12th July 2022 in respect of rental income from renting out a room(s) in your home to someone who is not an employee or an immediate family member. See \"Means Assessment\" guidelines for more details.\n\nTo qualify for One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) there must be a qualifying child under the relevant age threshold. From January 2012 onwards, the age limit of the youngest child for OFP entitlement purposes was gradually reduced to seven years of age. The reduction in the age limit was applied to new and existing customers on a phased basis.\n\nQualification for OFP is based on the age of the youngest child in the family. If a person qualifies for OFP based on the youngest child in the family then, payment of an Increase for the other qualified Child(ren) will continue, until they reach 18 years or 22 years if they are in full-time education.\n\nOne-Parent Family Payment is made up of a personal rate and an increase for each relevant child. The rate of payment depends on a person's means or income, that is rate of payment reduces as means or income increase. See SW 19 for current rates of payment.\n\nOne-Parent Family Payment has been classified as a Family Benefit with effect from 5 May 2005 (EU Regulation 883/2004). The effect of this is that an EEA national, who is employed or self-employed in Ireland and paying Irish PRSI, does not have to satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition. Such entitlement continues where the person becomes unemployed and is in receipt of Irish Jobseeker's Benefit or incapable of work and in receipt of Illness Benefit.\n\nThese entitlements are payable even if his or her children are habitually resident in another EEA State. The amount of Family Benefits payable by the Department of Social Protection will depend on whether there is entitlement to Family Benefits from another EEA State in respect of the same children.\n\nOne-Parent Family Payment is not payable to anyone residing outside the State, except for EEA nationals who are working in Ireland and qualify under the provisions of (EU) Regulation 883/2004, Article 7 and Articles 11 to 16 . A person may, however, have an absence of up to a maximum of 3 weeks outside the State for the purposes of holidays, attending a funeral and so on, and receive payment. The department must be notified in advance of the intention to leave the State and the reason for the absence.\n\nIf a person fails to make a claim within the prescribed time (see section - Time Limits on making of a Claim , she or he will be disqualified from receiving payment in respect of any period prior to the date of claim. This also applies to making a claim for any increase in payment or allowances, for example claim for increase in payment in respect of an additional child.\n\nHowever, where a person can prove to the satisfaction of a Deciding or Appeals Officer that entitlement existed and that there was good cause for the delay in making a claim for One Parent Family Payment, payment may be made for a period up to 6 months before the date of claim.\n\nAlso, where a claim for payment or an increase in payment is made outside the prescribed time, the period for which payment is made can be extended where the delay in making the claim is due to:\n\nBack to Work Enterprise Allowance is available to persons in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment who become self-employed. This allowance which is paid instead of One-Parent Family Payment is subject to certain conditions, including that they have been in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment for 12 months.\n\nThe allowance is payable on a reducing scale over a two year period, that is 100% of a person's social welfare payment (in this case One-Parent Family Payment (OFP)) in year one and 75% in year two. Applicants must be setting up a self-employment business that has been approved in writing, in advance, by a Local Integrated Development Company or a Case Officer from this department.\n\nA person in receipt of Back to Work Enterprise Allowance may retain secondary benefits, for example Fuel Allowance, while in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment. Other payments a person may qualify for are: Rent Allowance, Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and a Medical Card.\n\nNew participants on Community Employment Schemes from 16 January 2012 are disqualified from claiming OFP and participating in a CE Scheme during the same period. In these cases, an additional €20 per week that is paid to all CE participants will apply.\n\nPersons in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment are eligible, subject to certain conditions, to participate in the Back to Education Allowance scheme. The Back to Education Allowance Scheme is an educational opportunities scheme for persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments who wish to pursue an approved full-time second or third level course of education in an approved college, leading to a recognised qualification. From January 2013 participants will continue on their current rate of payment, rather than being increased to maximum rate as in the past. The annual cost of education allowance is no longer payable from the start of 2013. Also, participants may continue to receive any secondary benefits to which they otherwise have an entitlement.\n\nIf under 21, a customer must be 2 years out of education to qualify (confirmation required). In general a person must be over the age of 21 and in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment for at least 3 months (in the case of approved second level courses), or at least 9 months (in the case of approved third level courses).\n\nThe BTEA application (form BTE1) should be completed as soon as a place has been secured on an approved second or third level course. The rate payable on the BTEA is the same as is payable on the OFP (means apply).\n\nFrom 4 July 2013 former One Parent Family customers affected by the age related changes to OFP in full-time education who did not opt for BTEA at the start of the course may be admitted to BTEA ‘mid-course’ where the OFP is being withdrawn due to the age of the youngest child.\n\nThis scheme is administered by the Department of Education and Skills and is operated through ETB’s. To participate, a person must be in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment for 6 months and be at least 21 years of age. Application should be made to the local ETB for a place on a scheme.\n\nWhere a person in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment is working for an employer and on low income, she or he may qualify for this payment in addition to One-Parent Family Payment. Certain conditions apply in relation to hours of work and duration of employment. One Parent Family Payment is assessable as means for Working Family Payment.\n\nPayable for a 26 week period from October to April if a person is living alone or with dependent children or other categories of exempted persons. Only one Fuel Allowance per household is payable. A person must apply for the allowance.\n\nThe scheme was introduced in April 2000 and applies only to widow/ers who are widowed on or after 1 December 1999 and surviving civil partners (since 01 January 2011) who have at least one relevant child.\n\nOn the death of a qualified child, payment continues for six weeks at the rate in payment at the date of death. Notification of the date of death should be given to the department at the earliest possible date.\n\n(2) From February 2012 a person in receipt of a reduced rate One-Parent Family Payment may be paid (a partial rate) of one of the following payments provided the conditions are satisfied and provided that the total payment does not exceed the maximum rate payable for the benefit that the person qualifies for:\n\nAn increase for a qualified child is only payable once in respect of a child and is not payable to a person's spouse or civil partner on another social welfare payment. There is no half rate increase for a qualified child on One-Parent Family Payment.\n\nAn Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) is not payable on any social welfare payment, in respect of a child for whom Guardian’s Payment (Contributory) or (Non-Contributory) is in payment. Where a customer in receipt of Guardians Payment has an additional child or children in respect of whom they are not in receipt of Guardians Payment, an IQC may be payable in respect of that child or children so long as the IQC conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe One-Parent Family Payment claim form OFP 1 should be completed with all relevant questions answered. The form should be signed by the claimant in all cases. Where the claimant is unable to sign the claim form, his or her mark instead of signature must be witnessed.\n\nThe claimant should forward relevant documentation, as indicated below, with the signed application form. However, the documentation may be sent to the department after the initial claim is made, if not immediately available. This may cause some delay in processing the claim as a Deciding Officer may not be able to decide on the entitlement until all relevant documentation has been received in the department.\n\nAn acknowledgement of a claim is issued on receipt of the application form. The claim reference number is quoted and the claimant is asked to quote same in any future contact with the department regarding their One-Parent Family Payment.\n\nA claimant of One-Parent Family Payment is required, under social welfare legislation, to produce certificates, documents, information and evidence requested, including Birth Certificate, Marriage Certificate, Civil Partnership Registration Certificate, Spouse or Civil Partners' Birth and Death Certificates (if appropriate), means details (for example bank statements, farm details, and so on) and any other supporting documents relevant to the claim.\n\nIt is an offence for a person to knowingly make a false or misleading statement, or to provide documents or information which she or he knows to be false in some respect for the purpose of obtaining or establishing entitlement to payment, or payment at a higher rate. A person found guilty of such an offence could be liable to a fine of €1,269.74 or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. Any overpayment of pension may also be repayable to the department.\n\nA person is disqualified from payment of One-Parent Family Payment for any period before the date on which the claim is made and entitlement exists. Failure to claim One-Parent Family Payment at the appropriate time may result in loss of payment.\n\nHowever, the payment may be backdated for up to six months where \"good cause\" is shown for the delay in making the claim, provided the claimant can prove to the satisfaction of a Deciding or Appeals Officer that she or he satisfied the qualifying conditions for receipt of payment during that period. The same procedure also applies to claims for increases for child dependants and other allowances. Good cause may be shown to exist where the customer can demonstrate that incorrect information was received from the department or ill health prevented a person from making a claim for One–Parent Family Payment at the correct time.\n\nSee also \"Claims and Late Claims\" guidelines for more information on late claims and other circumstances in which backdated payments or allowances may be made. The guidelines also deals with the circumstances in which extra statutory payments may be made and the circumstances in which payment for loss of purchasing power may be made.\n\nSome claims may be referred to a Social Welfare Inspector prior to decision by a Deciding Officer, to establish if the conditions of entitlement to One-Parent Family Payment are fulfilled. Depending on the circumstances, a Social Welfare Inspector's report should address issues such as means or income, divorce, dissolution of civil partnership, separation, child dependency, maintenance arrangements, housing costs, household composition, possible cohabitation, and where appropriate inspection of relevant certificates.\n\nClaims are decided by Deciding Officers appointed by the Minister under Section 299 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended. Deciding Officers are independent in the exercise of their function in deciding on entitlement to One-Parent Family Payment. See \"Decision-Making\" guidelines for more general information.\n\nA written notification of the decision of the Deciding Officer is issued to the claimant. When a claim is awarded at a rate other than the maximum rate of payment, the claimant is given an explanation of the reason for the reduced rate of payment. Details of how means or earnings are assessed are issued to the claimant. If the claim is disallowed the claimant is advised of the reason(s) for the disallowance.\n\nWhere new information is made available as part of an appeal by the claimant, a Deciding Officer may revise a decision on entitlement, if it is to the advantage of the claimant. There is also a right of appeal against a revised decision. See \"Decision-Making\" guidelines for more information regarding revised decisions.\n\nAll award notifications advise the claimant of circumstances which could affect continued entitlement to the payment and request the claimant to advise the department of any such changes in circumstances. Certificates (birth, marriage, civil partnership etc.) are also returned at this stage.\n\nClosing Claims where documentation is not supplied: If a claimant fails to furnish all documentation necessary to make a decision on their One-Parent Family Payment application, or fails to attend for interview with a Social Welfare Inspector, a decision cannot be made on the claim in the absence of the information or documentation outstanding. In this event following relevant advice having been issued regarding the consequences, the claim is closed. Any future claim will only be considered from the date of re-application.\n\nIf a claimant is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer she or he may appeal directly to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. An Appeals Officer may decide the matter summarily or may deal with the case by way of an oral hearing.\n\nA statement is prepared on the facts relied on by the Deciding Officer in the making of a decision on entitlement to payment and on the extent to which the facts and contentions advanced by the appellant are admitted or disputed. This statement is put before the Chief Appeals Officer.\n\nOne-Parent Family Payment is payable weekly in advance on a Thursday (or Friday in the case of widow/ers/surviving civil partner). Where the day from which payment takes effect is a day in the week other than Thursday or Friday, the payment takes effect from the following Thursday or Friday. The same procedure applies where there is a change in the rate of payment.\n\nOne-Parent Family Payment is payable for as long as a person continues to satisfy the qualifying conditions and is not disqualified for any reason. Once the last relevant child on the claim reaches the relevant age (see Section Cut-off point of youngest child that applies to OFP claims table on page 10) both personal payment and increase for a relevant child cease simultaneously. The claimant is advised in advance that the payment will cease and advised of other payments for which she or he may qualify.\n\nWhere a relevant child dies, payment continues for six weeks at the rate of payment at the date of death. See \" Payment Related Issues \" guidelines for more details on after death payments.\n\nStop dates are inserted on the department's computer system as appropriate, for example where there is a younger child in a family who satisfies the age requirements of the scheme, a stop is applied to the payment of an increase for an older child who reaches 18 years and the case is reviewed to establish if she or he is continuing in full time education.\n\nWhen a Social Welfare Services Card or a cheque from the department is lost or stolen it should be reported to the department immediately. The Gardaí and the Post Office of payment should also be notified immediately of any such loss or theft.\n\nA person should notify the department if leaving the State and payment will be suspended for the period of the absence abroad. Payment may be made in certain circumstances for a short period (up to 3 weeks) during which a person is temporarily outside the State, for example on holidays and so on. See \"Payment Methods\" guideline for more detail.\n\nDirect Provision is the means by which the State seeks to meet its obligations to provide for the material needs of people seeking protection in the State. Protection seekers are offered accommodation under the system of direct provision operated by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice. Protection seekers living in Direct Provision receive a weekly Direct Provision Allowance. This allowance is a non statutory payment administered by designated persons of the Department Social Protection on behalf of the Department of Justice.\n\nPersons seeking refugee or other status cannot meet the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) and therefore cannot qualify for DSP means tested payments. Once a protection seeker is granted status they may apply for a DSP means tested payment appropriate to their circumstances. HRC is a condition for DSP means tested payments. Prior to 1 October 2020, persons who remained in Direct Provision for a period before moving into the community may have the value of the non-cash benefit taken into account in assessing their means under the scheme rules. Non-cash benefit is not assessable from 1st October 2020. See Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) guidelines and Social welfare entitlements of people in Direct Provision centres (or similar centres) guidelines.\n\nArrangements may be made for payment where a person is too ill to attend their Post Office to cash their payment. See \" Payment Related Issues \" guidelines for more details.\n\nThe onus is on the One–Parent Family Payment customer to notify the department of any changes in circumstances which may affect their qualification to One-Parent Family Payment. Any increase in means or income must be notified to the department immediately.\n\nWhen a claim is awarded, the customer is advised that they must inform the department of any changes (a number of changes are listed) that may affect their payment.\n\nA review form (OFP 40) issues once a year requesting the customer to fill in a questionnaire, provide documentary evidence in certain circumstances and make a declaration that the information they are providing is factual and complete.\n\nFailure to notify the department of any of the above events may result in overpayment of One-Parent Family Payment, which may be recoverable from the recipient by way of lump sum repayment or deductions from weekly payment. It may equally result in an underpayment of One-Parent Family Payment, for example where means have reduced.\n\nA review is initiated when the department is notified of any change in circumstances that may affect entitlement. This review may be carried out by way of a visit from a Social Welfare Inspector, or by direct correspondence or phone contact.\n\nPeriodic reviews (OFP 40 issues yearly) are also initiated by the department to confirm that the correct payment is being made to the appropriate person and that the qualifying conditions for receipt of One-Parent Family Payment continue to be fulfilled.\n\nWhere initial enquiries with a person, including written communication, fail to establish the facts as required, for example current or past means, current address and so on, payment of One-Parent Family Payment may be suspended until the relevant information has been provided by the claimant.\n\nWhere a claim is reviewed and the conditions for payment are not satisfied, the claim is disallowed. The customer is informed of this decision and if they are not satisfied they are advised that they can appeal this decision.\n\nCredited contributions are awarded to a Lone Parent who qualified for Lone Parents Allowance or One-Parent Family Payment for the first time since October 1990 and who, immediately prior to qualifying for the receipt of these payments was in receipt of another social welfare payment for which credits were awarded, that is Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance, Maternity Benefit, Illness Benefit, Health and Safety Benefit, Adoptive Benefit, Invalidity Benefit or Pre-Retirement Allowance."
