        "text": "What is alimony?\n\nAlimony is financial support paid by one ex-spouse to the other after the marriage has legally ended.\n\nAlimony is also sometimes called spousal support.\n\nTemporary alimony (also called pendente lite alimony) can be granted while the divorce is in progress, to help until the divorce is final. When the divorce becomes final, there may or may not be an order for alimony after the divorce. If alimony after the divorce is awarded, that amount could be higher or lower than the temporary amount.\n\nWhat is separate maintenance?\n\nSeparate maintenance is financial support paid from one spouse to the other while they are still married to one another.\n\nThe court will order separate maintenance only if the spouse with money fails or refuses to support the other spouse and the other spouse is in \"genuine need.\"\n\nSeparate maintenance is used when the spouses do not want to get a divorce, but want to live apart or to get a legal separation.\n\nWhat is the purpose of alimony?\n\nTo provide \"reasonable and necessary\" support. The person asking for alimony must show the court that he or she needs financial support, and that the other spouse has the ability to provide financial support.\n\nWhat do I do if I want alimony?\n\nYou can ask for alimony as part of a divorce proceeding.\n\nIf you and your spouse reach an agreement about alimony, you can ask the judge to make the agreement a part of the court order.\n\nIf you cannot reach an agreement, the judge will decide whether you are entitled to alimony.\n\nClick here for a Complaint for Divorce that you can fill out on the computer. It includes a section where you can ask for alimony. You will still need to file it with the court after you fill it out.\n\nWhat if I don't ask for alimony during the divorce, but later I decide I need it?\n\nYou must request alimony during your divorce proceeding. You will not be allowed to request it after the divorce case is over.\n\nWhat do I do if my spouse wants alimony but I don't think I can pay, or I don't think he or she needs financial support from me?\n\nWhen one of the parties in a divorce or separation wants alimony but the other party does not agree, the judge will decide if an alimony award should be made and if so, for how much.\n\nCan men ask for alimony?\n\nYes. Either spouse can ask the court to award alimony.\n\nHow long can I receive alimony?\n\nYou and your spouse can agree to include the length of your alimony arrangement in the court order.\n\nIf you do not agree, the judge will decide what is appropriate for your situation.\n\nIndefinite alimony or permanent alimony lasts until either spouse dies or until the court determines that alimony is no longer appropriate.\n\nTime-limited alimony (also called rehabilitative alimony) lasts for a limited time, as determined by the judge (for example, to allow the receiving spouse to obtain work experience or training necessary to become self-supporting).\n\nWhat if I am receiving alimony and I get remarried?\n\nRemarriage could be a basis for ending an alimony award, but alimony does not automatically end if you re-marry. Your ex-spouse would have to ask the court to terminate your alimony.\n\nWhat if my spouse agrees to pay me alimony?\n\nParties may agree to any alimony arrangement that they wish without having to have the judge decide the issue.\n\nThe parties' agreement should be reflected in the court order. If there is not a written agreement or a court order, your spouse can stop paying alimony at any time.\n\nWhat if my spouse disagrees with me about alimony?\n\nYou can ask the court to decide. The Court may require either party to pay alimony \"if it seems just and proper.\" The judge will look at all of the relevant factors in your situation. The law states that those factors include:\n\nYour ability to support yourself;\n\nTime necessary for you to get a job or get training so you can become employed;\n\nThe standard of living established during the marriage;\n\nLength of the marriage;\n\nCircumstances leading to the separation;\n\nEach party's age;\n\nPhysical and mental condition of each party;\n\nAbility of the spouse paying alimony to support him or herself while making payments;\n\nFinancial needs and resources of each party, including income, income from assets, potential income, previous awards ofchild support, financial obligations of each party, rights of each part to receive retirement benefits, and taxability or non-taxability of income.\n\nWhat do I do if my former spouse is behind in alimony payments?\n\nIf your former spouse is behind in alimony payments, you can file a motion for contempt and ask the court to take steps to enforce the order. Click here for a motion that you can fill out online. You will still need to file it with the court.\n\nCan my alimony order be changed after the divorce?\n\nAlimony may be modified if there has been a change in circumstances. The party seeking the modification must return to the court that granted the order to file for the modification. Click here for a motion that you can use to request a change in alimony. You can fill it out online, but you will still need to file it with the court.\n\nFor what reasons might a judge change an alimony award after the divorce?\n\nThe judge may modify an alimony award if the ability of the paying ex-spouse to make payments has changed or if there has been a change in the needs of the person receiving the payments."
