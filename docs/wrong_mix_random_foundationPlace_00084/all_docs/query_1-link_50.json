        "text": "APART-MINT is a funding programme for excellent young scientists in mathematics, natural and life sciences, technical sciences and medicine in the first post-doc phase of their careers.\n\nThe fellowships with a duration of 12 months are intended to support unconventional, innovative, potentially risky ideas with an uncertain outcome.\n\nExceptions\n\nRecognition is given to time taken out for (child)care or in the case of disabilities/illness or military or civilian service. Exceptions must be discussed with the Department of Fellowships and Awards prior to application.\n\nDoctoral studies must be completed before the application or the completion of the doctoral studies (Rigorosum/Defensio) must take place no later than six weeks after the submission deadline and the corresponding proof must be submitted as soon as possible.\n\nDuration of funding\n\nThe fellowships are awarded for a period of 12 months.\n\nIn the case of a positive assessment of the progress of the project by the end of the funding period, an extension for a further six months is possible.\n\nLevel of funding\n\nInformation to the amount of the fellowship: Fellowship Rates (= personnel costs)\n\nAdditional funding amounting to a maximum of EUR 12,000 can be applied for in order to finance project-specific travel and materials expenses.\n\nIn case of an extension for a further six months, the amount of the fellowship for this period is EUR 41,195 gross/gross.\n\nA subsidy of up to EUR 2.000 per annum is available for childcare.\n\nPayment\n\nThe funding is paid in annual instalments either directly to the fellow (“Neue Selbstständige”) or to the university or non-university research institute in Austria at which the fellow is employed. Employment within the framework of the funding programme is conditional on confirmation by the director of the institute that in the event of a fellowship being awarded a workspace will be available.\n\nThere can be no payment of the fellowship for any period before its commencement.\n\nConditions\n\nThe project should be started not later than four months after the fellowship was granted.\n\nFor the duration of the project fellows must be employed or get support by an Austrian university or research institute that provides the necessary infrastructure.\n\nFellows who fail to adhere to the conditions of the fellowship due to their own fault are obliged to return the funding."
