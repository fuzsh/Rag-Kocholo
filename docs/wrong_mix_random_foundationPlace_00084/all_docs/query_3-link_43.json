        "text": "TIOBE Index for July 2024\n\nJuly Headline: Rust is preparing itself for the top 10\n\nThis month, high-performance language Rust jumped from position #17 to position #13 in the TIOBE index. This is an all time high for Rust. Gaining 4 positions might seem a small change, but Rust has been \"the talk of the town\" the last couple of years without making much progress in the TIOBE index. Rust is finally moving up. After the tailwind of the US government, which recently announced to recommend moving from C/C++ to Rust for security reasons, things are going fast for Rust. The community is growing, including the number of third party libraries and tools. In short, Rust is preparing itself for a top 10 position in the TIOBE index. --Paul Jansen CEO TIOBE Software\n\nThe TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.\n\nThe index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.\n\nJul 2024 Jul 2023 Change Programming Language Ratings Change 11Python16.12%+2.70%23C++10.34%-0.46%32C9.48%-2.08%44Java8.59%-1.91%55C#6.72%-0.15%66JavaScript3.79%+0.68%713Go2.19%+1.12%87Visual Basic2.08%-0.82%911Fortran2.05%+0.80%108SQL2.04%+0.57%1115Delphi/Object Pascal1.89%+0.91%1210MATLAB1.34%+0.08%1317Rust1.18%+0.29%1416Ruby1.16%+0.25%1512Scratch1.15%+0.08%169PHP1.15%-0.27%1718Swift1.13%+0.25%1814Assembly language1.11%+0.10%1920COBOL1.08%+0.21%2026Kotlin1.05%+0.35%\n\nOther programming languages\n\nThe complete top 50 of programming languages is listed below. This overview is published unofficially, because it could be the case that we missed a language. If you have the impression there is a programming language lacking, please notify us at tpci@tiobe.com. Please also check the overview of all programming languages that we monitor.\n\nPositionProgramming LanguageRatings 21Classic Visual Basic0.91%22R0.83%23SAS0.79%24Ada0.78%25Dart0.74%26D0.72%27Lisp0.67%28Prolog0.67%29(Visual) FoxPro0.66%30Perl0.66%31Haskell0.65%32Lua0.60%33Scala0.59%34Julia0.56%35Objective-C0.40%36VBScript0.40%37GAMS0.33%38ML0.31%39Solidity0.30%40Logo0.28%41PL/SQL0.28%42Transact-SQL0.27%43PowerShell0.27%44TypeScript0.26%45Bash0.26%46Scheme0.24%47ABAP0.24%48Awk0.22%49Ladder Logic0.22%50RPG0.21%\n\nThe Next 50 Programming Languages\n\nThe following list of languages denotes #51 to #100. Since the differences are relatively small, the programming languages are only listed (in alphabetical order).\n\nABC, ActionScript, Algol, Apex, APL, ATLAS, AutoLISP, Ballerina, bc, Carbon, CFML, Chapel, CHILL, CLIPS, Clojure, Crystal, cT, Curl, DiBOL, Eiffel, Elixir, Erlang, F#, Forth, Groovy, Icon, Inform, Io, J, JScript, LabVIEW, Modula-2, Mojo, NATURAL, Nim, OCaml, OpenCL, OpenEdge ABL, PL/I, PostScript, Q, Racket, Ring, S, Smalltalk, SPARK, Tcl, VHDL, Wolfram, X++\n\nVery Long Term History\n\nTo see the bigger picture, please find below the positions of the top 10 programming languages of many years back. Please note that these are average positions for a period of 12 months.\n\nProgramming Language20242019201420092004199919941989 Python138682623-C22122111C++34433222Java4121115--C#5657721--JavaScript6799919--Visual Basic719------SQL89--92---Go91735-----PHP108656---Objective-C321033442---Lisp35321421141363(Visual) Basic--745337\n\nThere are 2 important remarks here:\n\nThere is a difference between \"Visual Basic\" and \"(Visual) Basic\" in the table above. Until 2010, \"(Visual) Basic\" referred to all possible dialects of Basic, including Visual Basic. After some discussion, it has been decided to split \"(Visual) Basic\" into all its dialects such as Visual Basic .NET, Classic Visual Basic, PureBasic, and Small Basic, just to name a few. Since Visual Basic .NET has become the major implementation of Visual Basic, it is now called \"Visual Basic\".\n\nThe programming language SQL was added to the TIOBE index in 2018 after somebody pointed out that SQL is Turing Complete. So although this language is very old, it has only a short history in the index.\n\nProgramming Language Hall of Fame\n\nThe hall of fame listing all \"Programming Language of the Year\" award winners is shown below. The award is given to the programming language that has the highest rise in ratings in a year.\n\nYearWinner2023 C#2022 C++2021 Python2020 Python2019 C2018 Python2017 C2016 Go2015 Java2014 JavaScript2013 Transact-SQL2012 Objective-C2011 Objective-C2010 Python2009 Go2008 C2007 Python2006 Ruby2005 Java2004 PHP2003 C++\n\nBugs & Change Requests\n\nThis is the top 5 of most requested changes and bugs. If you have any suggestions how to improve the index don’t hesitate to send an e-mail to tpci@tiobe.com.\n\nApart from “<language> programming”, also other queries such as “programming with <language>”, “<language> development” and “<language> coding” should be tried out.\n\nAdd queries for other natural languages (apart from English). The idea is to start with the Chinese search engine Baidu. This has been implemented partially and will be completed the next few months.\n\nAdd a list of all search term requests that have been rejected. This is to minimize the number of recurring mails about Rails, JQuery, JSP, etc.\n\nStart a TIOBE index for databases, software configuration management systems and application frameworks.\n\nSome search engines allow to query pages that have been added last year. The TIOBE index should only track those recently added pages.\n\nYes, the only condition is to refer to its original source “www.tiobe.com”.\n\nIf a language meets the criteria of being listed (i.e. it is Turing complete and has an own Wikipedia entry that indicates that it concerns a programming language) and it is sufficiently popular (more than 5,000 hits for +”<language> programming” for Google), then please write an e-mail to tpci@tiobe.com.\n\nWe spent a lot of effort to obtain all the data and keep the TIOBE index up to date. In order to compensate a bit for this, we ask a fee of 5,000 US$ for the complete data set. The data set runs from June 2001 till today. It started with 25 languages back in 2001, and now measures more than 150 languages once a month. The data are available in comma separated format. Please contact sales@tiobe.com for more information.\n\nWell, you can do it either way and both are wrong. If you take the sum, then you get the intersection twice. If you take the max, then you miss the difference. Which one to choose? Suppose somebody comes up with a new search term that is 10% of the original. If you take the max, nothing changes. If you take the sum then the ratings will rise 10%. So taking the sum will be an incentive for some to come up with all kinds of obscure terms for a language. That’s why we decided to take the max.\n\nThe proper way to solve this is is of course to take the sum and subtract the intersection. This will give rise to an explosion of extra queries that must be performed. Suppose a language has a grouping of 15 terms, then you have to perform 32,768 queries (all combinations of intersections). So this seems not possible either… If somebody has a solution for this, please let us know.\n\nGet your own proof of concept\n\nCurious how your projects will be ranked by our TiCS Framework?
