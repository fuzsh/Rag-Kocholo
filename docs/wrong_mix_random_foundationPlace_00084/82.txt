About the Work

Honor of Kings, a national game, hopes that in the Spring Festival of 2021, the public can be aware of the deeper needs and believe that love can break the dimensional wall. Warm gathering of cherished partners, fresh opening of a new year.

The content and format are different from the previous ones. This is the first time we have combined a grand and complete world view of a game with reality.

The work is based on Chang'an in the prosperous Tang Dynasty, using Chinese traditional culture to construct a kingdom full of oriental fantasy and Lantern Festival. The spokespersons send blessings to everyone, meaning that no matter how far apart we are, have fun together at Honor of Kings.
