        "text": "The Man With The Golden Gun (1974) Director: Guy Hamilton\n\n“A duel between titans. My golden gun against your Walther PPK.”\n\n★★☆☆☆\n\nInspired by the Bruce Lee Kung Fu cinematic craze of the 1970s, the second of Roger Moore’s James Bond films, The Man with the Golden Gun, also marks the ninth Eon Bond film, and the fourth and final Bond film directed by Guy Hamilton. In some ways, The Man with the Golden Gun, marked a turning point for the series, as it was the last film to be co-produced by Albert “Cubby” Broccoli and Harry Saltzman because their fraying relationship was simply no longer salvageable. Harry Saltzman departed the Bond series the following year due to financial problems that forced him to sell his 50% share to United Artists (and his departure caused a nearly three-year delay to the production of The Spy Who Loved Me). Today, many fans regard The Man with the Golden Gun as one of the worst in the whole series. By all accounts, The Man with the Golden Gun was a disaster both on and off the screen –even Roger Moore has called it one of the worst films in the Bond series.\n\nChristopher Lee plays an international assassin named Francisco Scaramanga who is located in Asia (Christopher Lee is the few good things about this movie). For some reason, Scaramanga has a superfluous third nipple as a sign of his strength and virility (the third nipple was also briefly mentioned in the original Fleming novel, though the film adaptation has almost nothing in common with the book). We begin on Scaramanga’s private island (filmed on Ko Khao Phing Kan, located in southern Thailand near Phuket) wherein a ruse is devised for Scaramanga to kill an assassin named Rodney (Marc Lawrence, who previously appeared in Diamonds Are Forever) during a staged shootout at Scaramanga’s remote lair filled with mirrors and traps, narrated by his small associate –a parody of Oddjob from Goldfinger— named Nick Nack (played by Hervé Villechaize who was apparently voracious in his appetite for Asian prostitutes during the production of the film, Roger Moore has since claimed he slept with about 35 women). Apparently, Scaramanga’s funhouse lair was based on Guy Hamilton’s idea of having Bond travel to Disneyland. In the next scene, a golden bullet is sent to MI6 outlined with “007” written on it. Apparently, Bill Fairbanks (agent 009), was killed by Scaramanga in Beirut five years prior to Bond’s mission. Bond then travels to Beurut to search for clues, and he meets a belly dancer named Saida, the last person to see Fairbanks alive, and Bond accidentally swallows a golden bullet situated in her belly button as he is attacked by thugs who inexplicably appear in his room. Bond is then sent to track down the golden bullet’s manufacturer in Macau, a Portuguese gunsmith named Lazar (Marne Maitland). This leads Bond to Andrea Anders, the mistress and lover of Scaramanga. This leads to a club called Bottoms Up (and a vague reference by Bond to his Aunt Charmian who was described in M’s obituary for Bond at the end of Ian Fleming’s novel You Only Live Twice). And this quickly leads to the central MacGuffin of the film: Scaramanga is stealing a device called the “Solex Agitator” which is a key component of a solar-powered space station. Bond is re-assigned to capture the Solex device.\n\nIn a somewhat ridiculous side-plot, Bond travels to Hong Kong and then to Bangkok to meet the men suspected of ordering a hit on a man named Gibson, or the man Scaramanga killed to retrieve the Solex. Bond is joined by his rather ditzy associate, Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland ) and he poses as Scaramanga (with a fake third nipple) but his ploy is destroyed when Scaramanga himself suddenly appears in the shadows and a group of martial arts students are instructed to kill Bond, but he escapes on a boat. Bond makes contact again with Andrea Anders, Scaramanga’s lover. There is a cringeworthy scene in which Mary Goodnight is hiding underneath the blankets in Bond’s bed as Andrea Anders enters the room and confesses that it was actually she who sent the bullet to Bond and she pledges to deliver him the missing Solex, in exchange for prostituting herself. Bond hides Mary Goodnight in a closet where she falls asleep while Bond and Anders make love –who in the world came up with this highly uncomfortable idea? Anyway, Anders promises to meet Bond at a fighting match the following day with the Solex. But when Bond arrives, he sees that Anders has been shot in the heart by Scaramanga’s golden gun. Scaramanga, himself, then suddenly appears and during the course of their conversation, Bond spots the Solex on the floor and conceals it. Bond smuggles the device to his allies and chases after Scaramanga. He also hilariously encounters the ever-goofy Sheriff J.W. Pepper on vacation in Asia with his wife –he is the clumsy, bungling American sheriff who is every stereotype of a heavy, rural, southern white American (he also appeared in Live and Let Die and quickly began an audience favorite). Pepper’s character was a carryover from Live and Let Die and he was inspired by the crew’s true interactions with racist southern policemen while shooting in Louisiana. There is also an entirely goofy, slapstick Kung Fu training sequence wedged in here at Hai Fat’s estate wherein Bond cheats and kicks a man in the face, before he is forced to face-off against Chula, the lead student, who forces Bond to flee out a window only to be rescued by Lieutenant Hip and his two nieces, who are apparently well-trained fighters. But they all strangely leave Bond behind (even though they were rescuing him). This is all…bizarre to say the least, in keeping with the rest of the tone of this oddball movie.\n\nAt any rate, Bond tracks Scaramanga to his remote island where he has captured a bikini-clad Mary Goodnight, and upon arrival, Scaramanga demonstrates the power of his energy beam to destroy Bond’s getaway plane. Apparently, this was all intended to be a toopoical allusion to the ongoing energy crises on the 1970s. Scaramanga then proposes a duel with Bond and the fight leads into Scaramanga’s funhouse lair. In the end, Bond manages to outwit and kill Scaramanga (his only kill in the film) by posing as a mannequin of himself, before escaping from the island, and then comically strapping Nick Nack in a cage to the mast of a ship as Bond and Goodnight sail away.\n\nUnsurprisingly, The Man with the Golden was not a particularly profitable film at the time of its release. The plot and goofy acting placed the future of the Bond saga in great jeopardy as did the deteriorating relationship between many people behind the scenes, not least of which were the producers. Much of this film presents a bland, cheap, brownish hue to its scenes, giving it a boring, stilted aesthetic. While watching The Man with the Golden Gun I kept asking myself, what is going on here? Bond is suddenly in Macau, and then he is in Thailand, and China? What exactly is Scaramanga trying to accomplish here? Why does he reveal his weapon to Bond only to then propose a duel which turns into a shootout? Why not just kill Bond like so many other enemies? So many questions arise from this clumsy, convoluted plot, and so few answers are offered in the James Bond world. United Artists rushed Eon to production with this film and unfortunately it shows. I suppose these movies were never really meant to be seriously analyzed so it’s not really worth trying to do so.\n\nClick here to return to my survey of the James Bond saga.\n\nBook Review: The Man with the Golden Gun (1965) by Ian Fleming"
