        "text": "Hiroshi Innami's first film is a startling hybrid that combines a detective plot transposed from a British novel with American-style cross-cutting, sets influenced by German Expressionism, and location footage from the Foreign Settlements and surrounding mountains of Kobe, Japan. The film was restored and rediscovered by the Kobe Planet Film Archive and is presented here with English subtitles and an original soundtrack. A version of the film with an accompanying narration by benshi Kumiko Omori is also available."
