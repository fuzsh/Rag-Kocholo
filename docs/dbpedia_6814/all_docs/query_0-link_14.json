        "text": "The Legend of the Western Movie\n\nSite Index Home\n\nThe Western Defining Westerns Directors\n\n55 Top Westerns 170 More Super Westerns\n\nThe 500+ Best Westerns 1903 - 2019\n\nCreated 2001\n\nUpdated January 2022\n\nThe Western\n\nby Simón Cherpitel\n\nNearly all the text below, save a few insertions, was written 18 years ago, & i can see that much can be better stated & some revised. Hopefully soon.\n\nWesterns were clearer cut in the old days, the good guys and the bad guys, maybe like it was 60 years ago in our perception of the real world. As i grew up in Kansas, in the early 1950s (I was born in early 1943 while Casablanca was number one in theatres), Gene Autry was my hero. Thirty years later, reading his autobiography, I learned that my childhood emulation was perhaps not so out-of-place. Gene was a singular man, pragmatic & idealistic, a worldly success with personal integrity & a sense of fairness in his business dealings.\n\nHe never made a great western film, yet his 1949 Riders in the Sky remained in my inner eye because the cinema covering the title song was unique in a Western of the \"B\" sort, while the song itself was my earliest experience of being emotionally swayed by music on the radio. Perhaps as a testament to our consciousness then, the song remained the #1 hit in the U.S. for over a month. Shortly afterwards, my dad took me to see Audie Murphy's first Western The Kid from Texas, a Billy the Kid story that had one scene which always stuck in my mind, & only recently in obtaining the French DVD did I confirm that my memory of that scene was precise.\n\nAt about that same time I saw my first significant Westerns, Raoul Walsh's Colorado Territory, named by a couple of critics as one of the best films of all time in Sight & Sound magazine's 2012 poll, & Sam Fuller's 1st movie I Shot Jesse James. A few years later, shortly after choosing to see Roy Rogers' In Old Amarillo instead of going with a friend to Viva Zapata!, the 'B' Western ceased; then I saw Shane, the same year John Wayne did Hondo and James Stewart stirred me most in The Naked Spur. Thus, i was affected early on by some of the best of the genre.\n\nThere are wonderful moments in some of these old films. At the top of this column, William S. Hart rides in Tumbleweeds, performing a truly incredible Chariots of Fire catch-up (recall where Eric Liddell falls, gets up and wins?) in the midst of the Oklahoma Land Rush. It is said that Hart's depiction of this epic race was never done better, although repeated in Cimarron (1931), & the great Western director's Anthony Mann's 1960 remake, and several other films. Looking back, it seems the 12 years from 1950 through 1962 were the Golden Age of the Western.\n\nI loved The Searchers when I saw it in 1956. This western was really special & different, though in my 13-year-old mind I didn't know why, & was disappointed when it was ignored for Oscar nominations at the end of the year. Simultaneously I embraced The Ten Commandments as the best film of the year.\n\nThough DeMille's movie got its critical due back then (ayhee! the dialogue really appalled me later), The Searchers received little critical recognition & no award nominations, yet today it is considered one of the 10 top films of all time via the survey of international critics, in Sight and Sound Magazine's 2012 poll, & first came to prominence in their 1982 poll. Because my childhood endorsement is now 'justified', an icon of The Searchers is part of the Cinemacom.com logo.\n\nThe Western was defined by John Ford & Roaul Walsh, perfected by Howard Hawks, Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher & Delmer Daves, extended & deepened by Sam Peckinpah & Sergio Leone, then rarefied and coalesced by Clint Eastwood.\n\nThese are the major Western movie directors, and only Clint Eastwood is still alive and working today, though he's not made a Western since Unforgiven in 1992. (Interesting to note is that Eastwood made White Hunter, Black Heart just prior to Unforgiven, playing John Huston making The African Queen, whose only classic period Western was titled The Unforgiven, considered by many one of Huston's lessor efforts but which I've always liked.)\n\nIn addition, top westerns were made epic by George Stevens, King Vidor and William Wyler, tightened by Anthony Mann and Budd Boetticher and glorified by Delmer Daves, Raoul Walsh, John Sturges, Henry Hathaway, Andrew V. McLaglen and Henry King, while being variously interpreted by William A. Wellman, Fred Zinnemann, Robert Aldrich, Nicholas Ray, Richard Brooks, Robert Wise, Samuel Fuller, Arthur Penn, Martin Ritt, Jacques Tourneur, Allan Dwan, Joseph H. Lewis, Elia Kazan, J. Lee Thompson, Tom Cries, George Roy Hill, Don Siegel, John Huston, Robert Parrish, Rudolph Maté, Marlon Brando, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Robert Altman, Alejandro Jodorowsky, George P. Cosmatos, Kevin Costner and Joel & Ethan Coen.\n\nIt is a matter of defining the heroes. William S. Hart, Eastern born, but a true cowboy-Westerner from the 1800s, evolved into Gene Autry, Oklahoma bred, who entered movies at the urging of Will Rogers, singing and setting a code of ethics to help youth develop good character. Gene suspended his career to fight in WWII, and his 'King of the Cowboys' screen title was assumed by Roy Rogers at Republic Pictures where John Wayne also did most of his work. After the war, Gene returned to making 'B' Westerns that were essentially the same as those he'd made before the war, but produced by his own Flying A production company, which made him a millionaire, while John Wayne, working with John Ford and Howard Hawks, and later with Henry Hathaway and Don Siegel, forged his uniquely diversified Western icon that today lives in the image created by Clint Eastwood.\n\nWorld War II changed the style and content of major Westerns, just as however obtusely it influenced and motivated new creativity in cinema world wide, such as film noir. Ford's 1939 community of Stagecoach evolved into Wellman's divisively tragic Ox Bow Incident (1942), followed by Vidor's tragically romantic Duel in the Sun and Ford's tormented Doc Holliday in the otherwise serene My Darling Clementine, both in 1946. Then came Hawk's epic Red River (1947). In this film John Wayne emerged as the quintessential Western hero, the good, the bad and the ugly, which reached its definitive portrayal with his Ethan Edwards in Ford's The Searchers, nine years later. Meanwhile, we saw Joel McCrea redo High Sierra in Walsh's Colorado Territory (1949); Gregory Peck die in King's The Gunfighter (1950); James Stewart lose his wife in Daves' Broken Arrow (1950) and go looking for revenge in The Naked Spur (1953) and other Mann Westerns; Gary Cooper act out of courage and duty rather than desire in Zinnemann's High Noon (1952); Alan Ladd ride in, fight the fight and ride away wounded in Steven's Shane (1953); Sterling Hayden and Joan Crawford make out in Ray's Johnny Guitar, John Payne overcome false accusation with false endorsement in Dwan's Silver Lode and Cooper and Burt Lancaster shoot it out in Aldrich's Vera Cruz, all in 1954; Robert Taylor go mad and freeze to death in Brook's The Last Hunt and Indian renegade Richard Widmark save the settlers in Daves' The Last Wagon, both in the same year The Searchers appeared, 1956.\n\nBy this time, the Western had become very diverse and its heroes very flawed. Besides the film's epic sweep, the sustaining interest of The Searchers lies in tone set by the ambiguous and obsessive John Wayne character. Randolph Scott had been playing laconic roles in Westerns for several years, and in 1956, he teamed with Budd Boetticher for a series of tight, confrontation Westerns, most motivated by a revenge or obsession theme that also embraces all the Mann-Stewart Westerns.\n\nAt a certain point, obsession for revenge or obsession of any sort becomes madness. Wayne's Ethan Edwards character influenced many later Westerns, such as Gregory Peck's character in King's The Bravados (1958. Note the difference in John Sturges's portrayal of Wyatt Earp in his 1957 Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and ten years later in Hour of the Gun (1967). Paul Newman's Billy the Kid in Penn's The Left-Handed Gun (1958) and Anthony Quinn in Dmytryk's Warlock (1959) were somewhat bonkers. James Stewart in Mann's westerns, and Gary Cooper reflect peculiar obsessiveness in Mann's Man of the West (1958) and Delmer Daves' The Hanging Tree (1959). Hawk's vastly entertaining Rio Bravo (1959) was the most significant departure from the madness that laced most great Westerns after 1950---indeed, it was the 2nd most popular Western on Sight and Sound's poll in 1992, after The Searchers, racking up identical votes with Ford's My Darling Clementine in the top 50 of all films, (though closely followed by Ford's Stagecoach and Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad & the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West).\n\nHowever, it was with John Wayne's portrayal in The Searchers that John Ford set a tone for the Western hero that influenced Peckinpah and Leone and nearly every major Western to follow, still echoing in the last two significant Westerns of the 20th Century, Eastwood's Unforgiven (1992) and Cosmatos Tombstone (1995), which is the most entertaining of all the fine Earp-Holliday-OK Corral movies, due to its embracing of today's brutal, fast-moving action complemented by eccentric character portrayals, especially Val Kilmer's definitive Doc Holliday.\n\nThe Golden Age of the Western ended in 1962. Gary Cooper died in 1961, with Daves' The Hanging Tree making a suitable denouement to his cowboy career which began in 1925 and gave him stardom in 1929 with Victor Fleming's The Virginian. After 1960, Daves never made another Western nor did Anthony Mann. Budd Boetticher, after his collaborations with Randolph Scott, made one more with Audie Murphy in the late 60s, after spending many years on a bull-fighting film that caused him a mental breakdown, and some think that the Boetticher-Scott Westerns more influcence Clint Eastwood's Westerns than any other director's. A moot point, for present art always derivies from the past, whatever the source.\n\nDeserving mention is one TV Western series of the many that dominated video in the late 1950s. For 6 seasons from 1957 to 1963 Have Gun Will Travel became a benchmark in quality writing, acting & directing, packing more plot & subtle development into each of its more than 200 episodes than many good feature length films. Richard Boone's Paladin character and various plot set-ups can be found in numerous later westerns, including the Leone-Eastwood collaborations, while the major director Andrew McLaglen went on to direct several of John Wayne's later films, & series writers Gene Roddenberry & Bruce Geller went on to their own historic TV creations. No other western series equaled it in intellectual depth.\n\nRegardless, great Westerns after 1962 would be more innovative in style, reflecting the influence of international cinema creativity that bloomed in the post WWII 1950s, while paying hommage to their classic predecessors. (There is also the insight that Westerns are reflective of current politics and world situations, none maybe more obvious than Dwan's take on McCarthyism in Silver Lode.\n\nThe era ended with four fantastic, summary Westerns. Marlon Brando released One Eyed Jacks in 1961, followed by a triumphant trio in 1962: Sam Peckinpah's Ride the High Country, not only showing his uniquely formative directing style to a wider audience than The Deadly Companions the year before, but also serving as the sunset saga for two of the screen's traditional Western greats, Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea, who 'enters his house justified'. David Miller's Lonely Are the Brave presented horse riding cowboy Kirk Douglas battling the forces of modernity in present day fairly amounting to classic tragedy in structural terms, signifying the final gasp of a western life that can never be again. Lastly, John Ford cast James Stewart and John Wayne in his commentary on the death of the Western mystique with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, whose closing statement on the genre of 'we print the legend, not the facts' throws away any concept that the Western film had ever tried to portray the reality of what really happened in the West. Directed in a deliberate, old-fashioned stagy style, Liberty Valance says that the whole genre is based on myth, and the great Westerns to come would only amplify and luxuriate in this concept, while their characterizations became more naturalistic in line with contemporary cinema screenwriting.\n\nIt is significant that only one decent minor Western was released in 1963, after the multitude from the previous dozen years, then in 1964 Sergio Leone's Per un Pugno di Dollari appeared in Italy, with the U.S. release not coming until early 1967, titled A Fistful of Dollars, making Clint Eastwood an international star and a new Western icon. Leone's Italian 'spaghetti' Westerns borrowed from the best of his predecessors, while amplyfiying the effect and adding the director's innovative, unique style.\n\nA Fistful of Dollars was a Western version of Akira Kurosawa's Samurai tale Yojimbo (1961), just as Sturges successfully used Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954) to provide the story of The Magnificent Seven (1960). Similarly Martin Ritt's The Outrage (1964) redid Kurosawa's Rashomon (1951). Thus the superb Japanese director became a major influence on the develpment of the American Western. Look at the 45 second, frozen frame final standoff duel in Kurosawa's Sanjuro (1962) sequel to Yojimbo to see his influence on Leone's style. Leone was a wonderful assimilator of worldly cinema culture, a film giant bending his assimilations much as Shakespeare did his borrowed plots. In Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), he references Ray's Johnny Guitar, Ford's 1925 Iron Horse, uses Ford's Monument Valley setting, plus scene set-ups from The Searchers, Shane and High Noon - Sanjuro's final duel. At the same time, one has to realize that here is a director influenced equally by the Fellini of La Dolce Vita (1960) and 8 1/2 (1963) and perhaps also by the Stanley Kramer of Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) in his circular camera movement (for which few critics credit Kramer), as well as Truffaut and Goddard and even David Lean, then putting it altogether in a Western. Ennio Morricone's superior music scores, with the whistling motif, might have been inspired by Nelson Riddle's haunting theme from Robert D. Webb's The Proud Ones (1956).\n\nDuring this tiime there were also excellent transitionary Westerns: Peckinpah's Major Dundee (1965) that muddied the waters with grayish heroes and villains, however badly MGM made the final cut; Brook's The Professionals (1966) playing off a bunch of good bad guys against the bad supposed good guys; Hathaway's Five Card Stud (1968), making a rare Western mystery out of perception and deception; Tom Cries' Will Penny (1968), with Charlton Heston trying to portray a real cowboy's life; George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), with Newman and Redford shooting them up and making a running joke of it all, including their demise; J. Lee Thompson's Mackenna's Gold (1969), with Gregory Peck wanting the loot like everyone else and by chance coming out on top; Hathaway's True Grit (1969), where a drunken, one-eyed Wayne takes the reins in his teeth and blasts away the bad guys, the one scene nearly exactly duplicated in the Coen brother's equally outstanding 2010 film from the same novel.\n\nIn 1969, Peckinpah created The Wild Bunch, making his definitive mark on the genre and additionally applying his own 'end game' to the Western tradition that he saw as expiring in 1913: \"Let's go,\" with the most extraordinary shoot-out ever filmed. In many of the best Westerns since, the central characters have been the outlaws, or those beyond the law, and the 'law' itself has been either been portrayed as ineffectual or dishonest or evil or merely a means to an end in either getting the money or revenge, e.g.: Peckinpah's The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973); Mankiewicz's There Was a Crooked Man (1970); Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971); Don Siegel's The Shootist (1976), John Wayne's final film with James Stewart playing his last Western role, while featuring Ron Howard who has since become a major American director; also Arthur Penn playing protagonist cattle rustler Jack Nicholoson against Marlon Brando's apparently trans-sexual killer-for-pay. Lawrence Kasdan's Silverado (1985); George Cosmatos' Tombstone (1995); and Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (1973), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Pale Rider (1985) and Unforgiven (1992) all had their quirky moments, seldom seen in traditional westerns.\n\nKevin Costner made the excellent Open Range (2003), following his well-meant but pretentiously skewed Indian agitprop Dances with Wolves (1990), significantly honored by the first Best Picture Academy Award since Cimarron in 1930, followed by Unforgiven in 1992. The 1990s saw incredibly new variations on the western with Sam Raimi's The Quick & the Dead & Jim Jarmusche's Dead Man in 1995, & Uli Edel's Purgatory & Antonia Bird's Ravenous in 1999, then John Hillcoat's The Proposition from OZ, which was released in the US in 2006, followed by a nearly equally odd and effective, but not enduring Western the next year, David Von Ancken's Seraphim Falls.\n\n2007 saw the release of two major westerns, James Margold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma, which he'd quoted in his commentary on his excelllent CopLand years before; & Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, a pretentiously disappointing attempt at an \"art\" western (that gets worse with repeated views), while Mangold's film attempts to reshape the Daves' film into a modern action-thriller but gets its forced realistic character development buried under an action barrage and an ending that bleakens & absurdifies the original. 2008 brought Ed Harris's well-intentioned & likeable Appaloosa, but not especially re-watchable.\n\nBut finally in 2010, we have a great western in the Coen's True Grit, the best since Costner's Open Range, while the 2011 Bolivian Blackthorn by Mateo Gil gives Sam Shepard one of his best late roles with spare action & much character.\n\nFrom the icons of William S. Hart through Gene Autry, Gary Cooper and John Wayne to Clint Eastwood, and the most recent esoteric departures from traditional stories & structure, this is the evolution of the American Western film. Right now it is . . . 'searching'. What is mainly missing from most modern attempts is the sense of the mythic combined with character depth.\n\nDefining the Western\n\nWhat makes a great Western or any great film in general, regardless of genre?\n\nSomehow they resonate more broadly with more people, and continue to do so after years and years, and repeated viewings.\n\nHow do we define what is a Western? A perplexing, controversial question, pondered by many, and we tackle now, even considering that perhaps the Western is the easiest of all genres to define.\n\nFor me, the Western is defined by style, atmosphere and tone, character portrayal, and mainly by location in space and time.\n\nGenerally, a Western is essentially set West of the Mississippi River from the early 1800s through about 1915. It is about conflict and confrontation, wars waged on an individual basis---people overcoming deadly obstacles in the form of other people, creative individualism opposing grouped forces that seek to thwart a person's individualism. Protagonists and antagonists can be on either side of the law, and of any race, white, red, yellow, black or brown, depending on the narrative set-up.\n\nHorses are a primary means of locomotion in a Western, thus Westerns generally have to take place before the automobile became widely used.\n\nThe hand gun is a major means of resolving the central conflict. Western protagonists don't say, \"I'll call the cops!\" or \"I'll sue you!\" They say: \"I'll shoot you!\" or simply, \"Draw!\"\n\nA Western features rugged landscapes and small frontier towns, not developed lands and large cities.\n\nPhysical action and conflict, gunfights, hard riding--these are usually necessary elements in any good Western. Not extensive dialogue. Westerns are about doing, not talking.\n\nWesterns can contain humor but are generally serious in tone.\n\nThus, according to our definitions, we exclude all musical Westerns like:\n\nFred Zinnemann's super 1955 Oklahoma or less than great ones like Joshua Logan's 1969 Paint Your Wagon (yes, Clint Eastwood sings!) or stylized experiments like George Marshall's 1954 Red Garters.\n\nExcluded comedies & spoofs are: Leo McCarey's Ruggles of Red Gap (1935) with Charles Laughton as an English butler transported to the old West, Norman McLeod's Paleface (1948) and Alias Jesse James (1959) and Frank Tashlin's Son of Paleface (1952) all with Bob Hope, Norman Taurog's Partners (1956) with Martin and Lewis, Raoul Walsh's The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw (1958), Henry Hathaway's North to Alaska (1960), Andrew V McLaglen's McLintock! (1963), Elliot Silverstein's Cat Ballou (1965), Burt Kennedy's Support Your Local Sheriff (1969) & Support Your Local Gunfighter (1971), Mel Brook's wonderful (at the time) Blazing Saddles (1974) and Hal Needham's The Villain (Cactus Jack) and Robert Aldrich's The Frisco Kid, both 1979. George Marshall's Destry Rides Again (1939) is perhaps the most debatable exception, yet the overall movie & James Stewart's character have attitudes that lack serious intent, which makes Marlene Dietrich's tragic demise, treated surprisingly off-handedly, seem from another movie.\n\nMost all of the above ARE included in the big list, partly because in a perhaps popular perspective, they ARE Westerns... of sorts. Sydney Pollock's The Scalphunters (1968) is recently added to my secondary list, because Lancaster gives the protagonist a believable persona within the almost farcical tale.\n\nIt's a matter of tone.....is there a life &/or death situation at the center? Or is the whole thing being handled so lightly that you know nothing very bad is going to happen to the characters you care about.\n\nAlthough the original TV series was happily inventive on the Western structure, Barry Sonnenfeld's The Wild Wild West (1999) is not only over-the-top Victorian sci-fi and personality comedy, but also rather mediocre entertainment. The only difference between it and the much-maligned but more enjoyable Jeremiah S. Chechik's 1998 film of The Avengers was about 100 years in time.\n\nSome westerns with sci-fi or time-travel trappings are excluded, like Gene Autry's The Phantom Empire (1935), Michael Crichton's 1973 Westworld Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future III (1990), or silly stuff like Jim O'Connolly's 1969 Valley of Gwangi where cowboys try to herd dinosaurs. A few are included: William Dear's 1982 Timerider\n\nWhy Michael Mann's exquisite 1992 Last of the Mohicans has been called a Western, I don't know, or Ford's 1939 Drums Along the Mohawk. They're pre-Revolutionary War sagas, Eastern settler pieces. Mohicans is about the end of a way of life, that of a particular Indian tribe in the East. Harder to peg is Burt Lancaster's only directorial effort The Kentuckian (1955), maybe because its adverts makes it look like one, & it vaguely feels like one with its traveling, individualistic hero, who is in the process of going West, yet he walks, doesn't ride a horse, & the title state is as far as he gets in the story. (I like the movie overall & rewatch, & it represents my indecisiveness as it's included on the long 500+ list but not in my special 145 :) Meanwhile, from the same era, Rudolph Maté's lesser 1955 The Far Horizons is a Western simply because of its location West of the Mississippi.\n\nA movie like Joseph Kane's 1955 The Vanishing American is a Western because it is about a Western tribe from a book by Western writer Zane Grey. Settler confrontations with 'Indians' or native inhabitants do not a Western make. Otherwise, one could call Ken Annakin's memorable New Zealand drama Land of Fury (1954) a Western.\n\nJust because a film's location is in frontier America during the 1800s does not mean it is a Western, eg: Clarence Brown's 1946 The Yearling & Robert Stevenson's 1957 Old Yeller.\n\nMountain man stories are nearly always Westerns.\n\nSome Civil War movies are Westerns while others are not. Victor Fleming's Gone With the Wind (1939) is clearly not a Western, it's a romantic historical saga and domestic drama. Likewise William Wyler's 1956 Quaker oriented Friendly Persuasion is not a Western. However, Andrew V. McLaglen's 1965 Shenandoah is a Western (although not one i'm very fond of), because James Stewart and his sons do a lot of riding and hold up a train. It's a matter of style & action. John Ford's 1959 The Horse Soldiers is a Western, & also Dmytryk's Alvarez Kelly; John Huston's 1951 The Red Badge of Courage is not.\n\nAt the same time, though placed at the very end of the historical time period of the Western, Mexican revolution films are almost always Westerns. Again, it's their style, men fighting in a rugged landscape, which is just an extention of the American West South of the border. Pancho Villa himself was finally shot down while riding in a motor car in 1923, but at least in his movies, he mainly went round on horseback. However, William Dieterle's 1939 Juarez is a political drama.\n\nHere are some superb movies that many class as Westerns but I do not:\n\nA Western is 'serious' or seriously treats the basics of the genre, mainly that of choices or actions meaning either life or death. Even the most basic Gene Autry or other series Western contains this element. However they, & many Westerns, contain comedy as most of John Ford's do. Westerns that are predominantly comedies or spoofs are not Westerns but comedies. Even the threats to life are often contrived to make comedy. Elliot Silverstein's Cat Ballou (1965) is perhaps the major example.\n\nGeorge Stevens' Giant (1956), Martin Ritt's Hud (1963) & Peter Bogdonvich's The Last Picture Show (1971) are domestic dramas and family sagas set in the modern West, not Westerns. Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven (1978) is located within the same era as The Wild Bunch, but despite the final chase and gun-down, it's mainly a romantic tragedy. Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2005) is a modern social adventure.\n\nBogart as the central figure in John Huston's classic Treasure of Sierra Madre (1948) fills the film with more of an urban noir sense than that of a Western, despite the location, horses and shootings.\n\nHugo Fregonese's Blowing Wild blantantly borrows set-up story points from Huston's movie, plus has a big climatic Western-style shootout with Mexican bandit raiders, yet presents a prime study of what is a \"Western\" & what is not, in this instance it being a romantic noirish adventure melodrama thru Barbara Stanwyck's murderous femme fatale with most everyone except the baddies using cars rather than horses.\n\nEdward Zwick's Legends of the Fall (1994) has many Western elements, but its epic sweep includes WWI, sea voyaging, domestic love triangles, bootlegging and bad cops again driving cars.\n\nThe predominance of horse riding verses car driving is a major motif that separates a Western from a non-Western. Automobiles are a fact of the post-Western era.\n\nLikewise, both Frank Perry's 1975 Rancho Deluxe and Sydney Pollack's 1979 Electric Horseman contain too many contemporary attitudes and trappings to be Westerns within our perspective.\n\nJohn Sturges' Bad Day at Black Rock (1955) is decidely Western in execution and setting; however, its racism focus and the denouement with Spencer Tracy blowing away Robert Ryan via a Molotov cocktail made from the gas in a jeep is as urban as John McTiernan's great thriller Die Hard (1988), which not only borrowed and expanded in spades the shoot-out from High Noon, but also paid verbal hommage to the genre.\n\nFilms like these provide a basis for redefining the Western, however the genre has experienced long periods of plenty in the past, followed, like now, by equally long periods of famine, so it will be another five years or so before we can say that the traditional Western that fits our definitions of style, time and place is unlikely to be seen again.\n\nMartin Campbell's 1998 The Mask of Zorro is highly entertaining the first view, but not a Western, while Elia Kazan's 1952 Viva Zapata is. Why? Mainly because Zapata is a real person in Mexico in the midst of the revolution, and uses a gun, not a fictional archtype operating within the palaces of the rich in urban old California, and fighting with a sword.\n\nThe Western is largely defined by its location within a territory that is undefined or striving for development, primitive and blasted by natural untamed elements. Which is why Henry King's South African Untamed (1955) is also a Western. where they ride horses and shoot it out just as though they were in the American Southwest during the same era.\n\nHowever, Heping Fandian (Peace Hotel) by Ka-Fai Wai (1995), though Western styled, is set in China in 1930, and thus is less American Western feeling than any of Kurosawa's three great Western source materials mentioned above.\n\nRodeo movies aren't westerns, they're more sports stuff, regardless of time period, thus excluding Nicholas Ray's The Lusty Men, Cliff Robertson's J.W. Coop or Peckinpah's superb Junior Bonner, both 1972. The same is true of John Huston's wonderful The Misfits (1961).\n\nJan Troell's 1974 Zandy's Bride is romantic drama, not a Western, though its depiction of mundane life on the American frontier in the 1800s is maybe more accurate than any Western. Though rather boring, it's good enough to include on our long list; however Troell's 1971 Utvandrarna {The Emigrants}, which is conerned with getting to Minnesota from Sweden, is excluded, and also his 1972 sequel Nybyggarna {The New Land}, which is concerned with day to day living on the Midwest frontier.\n\nThey say exceptions define the rule. Thus, Alan J. Pakula's post WWII Comes a Horseman (1978) is a Western because of the settings, horse riding and final shoot-out. It 'feels' like a Western., & its modern trappings are spare. The same is true of the little know but also included (& in my personal collection) Edgar G Ulmer's The Naked Dawn (1955). George T. Miller's Oz-based 1982 The Man from Snowy River is a Western because the landscapes are super vistas worthy of any movie made in the North American West (many Westerns today are shot in Canada) as well as Kirk Douglas in dual roles as rancher and prospector and above all, some of the best horsemanship ever displayed in cinema.\n\nJohn Sayles' 1996 Lone Star is an interesting study. It's modern day & doesn't feel like a Western, yet contains several Western elements. Sayles manages to combin past and present, myth and magic within contemporary Western times, bringing together on an inner level themes that haunted the traditional Westerns and tying them to a modern mystery drama that is very connected to the West of the past, so as to say, 'What we might have thought it was, was not; what we think about it now has no end; what we are is what we have come to, because we cared, because we had integrity to be our true selves, right or wrong.' Lone Star perhaps represents a modern day succesor to the great Westerns of the past, in part because all the sheriffs carry the single-action six-shooter .45s that were developed by the Colt company in 1872. Any Western supposedly occurring before 1872, showing guys shooting manufactured bullets instead of loading the pistol chambers with cap and ball are anacronistic. This includes John Ford's The Searchers that states \"Texas, 1868.\" Film the legend, not the fact.\n\nDavid Miller's 1962 Lonely Are the Brave is a Western because its protagonist Kirk Douglas rides his horse and shoots it out with contemporary life (including downing a helicopter - 20 years before Stallone did the same in First Blood), escaping the posse by dragging his horse over a mountain, only to be felled crossing a highway by a semi carting toilets in a classic tragedy structure---the final word on the fate of the cowboy hero.\n\nGood Westerns contain a lot of myth.\n\nHorses, hand guns and hard enemies.\n\n\"Print the legend.\"\n\nWhat finally defines a Western is the feeling, a feeling of space not necessarily in terms of wide open physical space, but an inner space, the sense of space separating people whether physical or psychological expressed in the space, even with town-bound Westerns like High Noon or Rio Bravo, the streets & interiors are never hugely crowded with people, except rarely. Maybe merely for me is the sense of the lone rider isolated by space (nature), perhaps the single image of the spirit of the pioneer, alone on the trail. Maybe why i love riding a motorcycle. Not in a group. Alone. A classic cinema example of our true aloneness in the world?\n\nWestern Directors\n\nMajor directors who made Westerns:\n\nJohn Ford's The Searchers is now generally considered the finest Western film ever made, as well as his greatest film. He began his film career in 1917 and received six Academy Awards. Two were for his WWII efforts, the other four were given as Best Director for The Informer (1935), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), How Green Was My Valley (1941) and The Quiet Man (1952). His only Western to receive a nomination for Best Picture was Stagecoach (1939) for which he also received a Best Director nomination.\n\nSam Peckinpah is noted mainly for his Westerns. His first major film Ride the High Country served as a fitting denouement to the fine careers of both Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea. He revitalized the genre with gritty anti-heroes, who many feel are an extension of John Wayne's Ethan Edwards in The Searchers; however, his directorial approach is unique in terms of human interaction and dialogue, and a violent realism that is simultaneously conveyed with esthetic distance. Thus, his slo-mo so-called 'ballets of death' are not gratuitous baths in blood, but poetic portrayals that by their Brechtian presentation we realize are staged. The Wild Bunch is generally considered his greatest work.\n\nSergio Leone, an Italian, contributed as much to the development of the Western as Ford and Peckinpah. His artistic creations within the new spaghetti Western with the Man Without a Name trilogy between 1964-1966 spawned a new vista. That he chose to shoot his greatest creation Once Upon a Time in the West in Ford's monument valley while basing the story's premise on Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar and the conclusion on John Ford's Iron Horse is evidence of his homage to them and their influence.\n\nClint Eastwood achieved international stardom via Leone's first three films, then became the new screen icon that John Wayne had created in his minimalistic way, & directs films in a style & with a choice of material which makes him the most interesting & consistently watchable & enjoyable American director working today. After years of boxoffice success & dismissal by critics, he finally achieved recognition with an Oscar as Best Director of Unforgiven with the film widely regarded as the Best Picture of 1992, & got a 2nd Oscar for Million Dollar Baby in 2004.\n\nThrough his Malpaso (a creek near his home in the California Big Sur coastal country) Company, he has directed not only his superb Westerns but also the first-rate psychological thriller Play Misty for Me (1971) which predated Fatal Attraction by 15 years; the ultra-feminist Dirty Harry saga Sudden Impact (1983); the jazz musician biography Bird (1988); an unusual portrayal of John Huston in White Hunter, Black Heart; humanistic dramas like Bronco Billy (1980), Honkytonk Man (1982); the romantic Bridges of Madison County (1995) and Breezy with William Holden in 1973; heavy drama with Mystic River (2003); excellent thrillers Absolute Power (1997), True Crime (1999) & Blood Work (2002); action thrillers The Gauntlet (1977) & The Rookie (1990); the sci-fi adventure Space Cowboys (2000); unique simultaneous views of WW2 in the Pacific from both sides with Flags of Our Fathers & Letters from Iwo Jima (2006); and perhaps his most unrecognized accomplishment of A Perfect World (1993) which gave us the America of our imagination in the days preceeding the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 and portrays the after-effect of our jarring loss of innocence in a single helicopter shot.\n\nHoward Hawks is well known for films like Bringing Up Baby &The Big Sleep as his great Westerns, Red River and Rio Bravo.\n\nAnthony Mann had an allegorical approach to the western and collaborated with James Stewart on 6 films in the 1950s that redefined the actor's screen persona, before going on to stage some of the last great costume spectacles with El Cid and The Rise & Fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nBudd Boetticher brought a special leanness to the western and reached his apex in several films created during the 1950s with Randolph Scott and producer Harry Joe Brown, and often scripted by Burt Kennedy, who went on to direct also, while the aging Scott himself, in his quiet way, was also redefining the quintessential western hero. Nearly every western the actor did from the late 1940s through his retirement with Ride the High Country in 1962 is enjoyable for his presence.\n\nDelmer Daves, writer and director, creator of Bogart's Dark Passage, had a particular affinity for the western genre as evidenced in Broken Arrow, 3:10 to Yuma, Cowboy and The Hanging Tree.\n\nNicholas Ray also directed In a Lonely Place, Rebel Without a Cause and Bigger Than Life.\n\nHenry Hathaway was excellent at creating a natural tension in most all of his movies, & moved easily from modern day thrillers like 23 Paces to Baker Street to Westerns, several with John Wayne.\n\nRaoul Walsh began his career with silent two-reelers in 1912, gave John Wayne his first starring role in The Big Trail in 1930, and continued working in film until 1964. His best Westerns are the noirish Pursued & his 1949 Colorado Territory remake of his High Sierra, the 1941 Bogart crime thriller, with as nearly a shockingly violent ending as his White Heat with Cagney on \"Top of the world, Ma!\"\n\nMichael Curtiz also directed Casablanca.\n\nFritz Lang was director of Metropolis, Dr. Mabuse, M, The Big Heat and Beyond a Shadow of a Doubt.\n\n55 Fabulous Westerns\n\nFor students or critics who wish to assimilate the western movie as briefly as possible, I offer this list of a top 55 Westerns and an additional selection to total around 225. In the list of 500+ Westerns are more complete casts, plus an additional 300 or so Westerns that i've seen, & MAY be enjoyable for one view, but which i won't see again in lieu of revisiting any of the 225. Series Westerns are not included, thus no Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, Rex Allen, Rocky Lane, The Durango Kid, Tim Holt, Lash LaRue, Whip Wilson, Rod Cameron, Johnny Mack Brown or early John Wayne, etc, nor most of the 500+ Spaghetti Westerns of the late 60s & early 70s, which rode tropes to death as much as the simplistic & repetitious USA series Westerns.\n\nThe Ox-Bow Incident - William A.

An example is Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail that is notable mainly for its incredible spectacle in Fox's 1st CinemaScope process experiment 23 years before they could make it practical for general exhibition. Thru blu ray it can now be enjoyed as it was seen in only 2 theatres (LA & NYC) in 1930.\n\nSentimental inclusions: Although Raoul Walsh's Colorado Territory & Sam Fuller's I Shot Jesse James are the earliest Westerns of note I saw first run, both unforgettable because of the main characters' tragic demises, Kurt Neumann's The Kid from Texas was far more emotionally upsetting, maybe because at age 7 & unaware of the historical legend of Billy the Kid, I identified more with the young Audie Murphy, & less with Joel McCrea or John Ireland. Dodge City is less interesting than Virginia City, but my Mom loved it, having flown with my dad & the local newspaper editor in his private plane to Dodge City for its premiere & meeting & being chased by Errol Flynn.\n\nYou may be surprised that I don't have Ford's Stagecoach or Hill's Butch Cassidy & Sundance Kid in my 55 top group. Both lack character depth. The first I find too predictable after several viewings, & the 2nd, too comedic, where the characters live because of Goldman's clever repartee, yet funny lines are less amusing after several viewings.\n\nI've recently removed Butch Cassidy & Sundance Kid from my 2nd group, for it is really more of a sophisticated example of the better comedic Westerns like Cat Ballou & Support Your Local Sheriff, which i do not consider so much Westerns as Comedies.\n\nComedy in Westerns, for my taste, is a delicate balance. Whereas the 'forced' or clowning humour in a John Ford Western serves to highlight or give intentional comic relief as in classic tragedy (think Shakespeare) within a story's serious or tragic context, the intentional comedies have nothing to offset. Pollack's Scalphunters is an example that pushes the comedy as much as any Western & still retain a grip on presenting something more than merely making fun of everything, as Butch & Sundance even joke about their tragic demise. Finally to me, the movie does not endure because it tries too hard to make me like it.\n\nAnother instance of a Western trying too hard to entice with an undercurrent of comedyoverlaying the melodrama is Kasden's Silverado, whose quirkiness wore thin after 2 or 3 views, & again the characters lack dimension or depth, whereas Clint's Pale Rider released simultaneously (and helping to maintain the Western genre in the mid-80s) has grown in interest during ensuing years because of Eastwood's naturalistic direction and nuances.\n\nRe Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller, depressingly predictable even on first view - a dead end like the end the characters achieve - is enhanced by Leonard Cohen's great songs, the cinematography & unusual ambiance. Personally, i have an ongoing problem believing Warren Beatty as a clever 'dummy' similar to most all his 'slow-witted' roles throughout his career, however, for me, the movie's grown in stature over the years as i've grown more emotionally detached from what i view. Beatty is something else: He's most acceptable or believable as the football player who 'catches on' quickly in Heaven Can Wait - maybe because it's his least serious movie. And he's most believable in his Reds maybe because the character is closest to his true intellignece. In nearly all the rest of his roles, he seems to be 'acting' dense, for i find it impossible to not see the intelligence or calculation behind his eyes. Why he so often mis-cast himself throughout his career is a mystery to me. His recent portrayal of Howard Hughes in Rules Don't Apply is one of his best.\n\nThe Big Trail - Raoul Walsh (1930) John Wayne\n\nDodge City - Michael Curtiz (1939) Errol Flynn\n\nStagecoach - John Ford (1939) John Wayne\n\nVirginia City - Michael Curtiz (1940) Errol Flynn, Randolph Scott\n\nThe Desperados - Charles Vidor (1942) Randolph Scott, Glenn Ford\n\nCanyon Passage - Jacques Tourneur (1946) Dana Andrews\n\nDuel in the Sun - King Vidor (1946) Gregory Peck, Jennifer Jones\n\nAngel & the Badman - James Edward Grant (1947) John Wayne\n\nPursued - Raoul Walsh (1947) Robert Mitchum, Teresa Wright\n\nRamrod - André DeToth (1947) Joel McCrea, Veronica Lake, Don DeFore\n\nBlood on the Moon - Robert Wise (1948) Robert Mitchum\n\nFort Apache - John Ford (1948) John Wayne, Henry Fonda\n\nFour Faces West - Alfred E.

The Internet Movie Data Base (IMDb.com) listed 11,000 Westerns a few years ago. Well, that's a bit much, so we settled on the more digestible number of 500+. For someone who loves the genre, these are all fairly enjoyable. I've seen all but maybe a dozen based on others' recommendations.\n\nNo character series Westerns are included, thus nothing of Tom Mix, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, 30s John Wayne, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Rex Allen, Charles Starrett, Al 'Lash' LaRue or Whip Wilson. A few 'Wild Bill' Elliott's are included, as the stories and excecutions were a grade above the others, like In-N-Out's burgers outshine McDonald's.\n\nThese actors as protagonists make almost any Western worth seeing: John Wayne, Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Randolph Scott, Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Henry Fonda, William Holden, Charlton Heston, Robert Ryan, Audie Murphy and Clint Eastwood.\n\nThe Westerns below are all pretty good, some significant for historical reasons. In my top list of about 200 above (relisted with more complete casts below), there are only 22 (& only 4 in the top 55) that date after 1978 - the midpoint year from the first listing in 1939 until now. My view is obvious in not believing that most recent Westerns are up to those from earlier years. Note the action-oriented remakes of 3:10 to Yuma and The Magnificent Seven, neither equal to their originals. The failure is in putting effects & action above characterisation & simple story-telling. The more recent listed are simply the best of what's appearing today.\n\nSpaghetti Westerns: the Italian often joint Euro bunch usually shot in Spain between 1963 & 1976 - there are approximately 600 reportedly made. A number are very watchable in hi-resolution. Leone's were the best & were the model for the majority of the others. I'm certain i've overlooked including a few of the better ones.\n\nFrom recent years, a number of Westerns 'made-for-TV' are included, and some are better than those made for theatrical exhibition. Most Western TV series from the late 50s and early 60s were on a par with & many better from the cowboy series of the 30s and 40s. A few in recent years have provided unique entertainment, such as HBO's production of Zane Grey's Riders of the Purple Sage. I've not seen them all, however, in the interest of being comprehensive, I've accepted recommendations by others. The Western in recent years has ventured into some very weird territory.\n\n1903\n\nThe Great Train Robbery - Edwin S. Porter (Broncho Billy Anderson)\n\n1914\n\nThe Squaw Man - Oscar Apfel, Cecil B.
