“Convex Insurance, a leading aviation insurer, is delighted to support the work of FGA and the global efforts to decarbonise aviation” – Rachel Delhaise, Head of Sustainability, Convex Insurance

“SAF is an important part of the decarbonisaton of travel. That’s why we are so proud to have helped fund the research with University of Amsterdam in 2018 that led to the creation of Fly Green Alliance. From that initial investment, it’s been inspiring to see how FGA has continued to scale their impact, speaking, educating and training businesses about low carbon travel and SAF, as well as enabling strategic development work to happen across the industry.”
