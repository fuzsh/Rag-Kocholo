M is sent a golden bullet with his name on it. The bullet has come from Francisco Scaramanga, an assassin with golden bullets. Scaramanga wants to have a duel with James Bond to the death.

Bond is sent to the Far East with Mary Goodnight to track down the elusive assassin. The investigations lead to an island off the coast of Thailand where Scaramanga and his henchman Nick Nack live. Scaramanga has built a laser weapon which James aims to destroy as well as killing Scaramanga in a duel.

On a slow boat off the Island, James has to deal with Nick Nack but doesn't kill him, instead has him trapped inside a wooden cage roped up high.
