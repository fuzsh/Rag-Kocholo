        "text": "CRONIN\n\nHistory of Crawford County, Iowa...by F. W. Meyers. 2 vols. Chicago: S. J.\n\nClarke Pub. Co., 1911.\n\nAmong the prosperous citizens of Boyer township few have enjoyed the favors of fortune more abundantly in recent years than P.H. Cronin. He was born in Warren county, New York, January 29, 1871, a son of Philip and Julia (Hartnett) Cronin, both of who were natives of Ireland. The father went to England and lived for a time in London, where he worked as as brick mason. He was married in England to Julia Hartnett and soon afterward came with his bride to America. They lived for a while in Warren county, New York, and then decided to locate in Iowa, selecting Clinton county for their home. In 1881 Mr. Cronin removed with his family to Crawford county and permanently located in Boyer township, where he is still living. His wife passed away in 1896. There were four children in their family: P.H. of this review; Timothy, of Willow township; D.J. who is now a druggist at Platte Center, Nebraska; and Mary, the wife of William Shannahan, who lives near Ute, Iowa.\n\nP.H. Cronin received his education in the district schools and early engaged in farming, to which he has since devoted his attention. He has applied himself with gratifying results and is the owner of one hundred and sixty acres of highly productive land. He raises grain and pays special attention to raising and marketing a good grade of horses and cattle.\n\nPolitically he is identified with the Democratic party and has served as a member of the school board. In religious beliefs he adheres to the Catholic church and fraternally he is a valued member of the camp of Modern Woodmen of America at Dow City. He is unmarried and has no important interests aside from his farm, his chief attention being concentrated upon his business. This accounts in a large measure for his success.\n\nMcKEEVER\n\nGue, B.F. Biographies and Portraits of the Progressive Men of Iowa. Des Moines: Conaway & Shaw Publishers, 1899.\n\nMckeever, A. J., of Sheldon, O'Brien county, is a product of Ireland, the little green isle that has furnished so large a quota of the men who have been foremost in preserving and developing this great land of the free. His parents, Michael and Rose (O'Kane) McKeever, were farmers, and despite the despicable system of landlordism prevailing in Ireland, were in moderate financial circumstances when they came to the United States in 1860.\n\nThe youth of Mr. A. J. McKeever was spent on a farm in Dubuque county, where his parents resided until 1884, when he removed to O'Brien county. In 1888 he engaged in the grocery business at Sheldon, in partnership with Mr. Theodore Geiger, and after one year's prosperous business Mr. McKeever bought out the interest of his partner and continued the business alone. In his youth he learned well the lessons of prudence, frugality and industry, so valuable to men everywhere in business, and these qualities enabled him to increase his stock and extend his business until now he owns and occupies the handsomest business block in that city. He is the embodiment of a first-class business man; strictly honorable in his dealings, courteous to all, and genial and companionable to a high degree. He makes a friend of everyone with whom he comes in contact. Coming direct to Iowa from Ireland in 1860, he begun with pioneer life, and has lived to see the wild prairie upon which he first came for a home transformed into a grand agricultural paradise, all settled up with good citizens and industrious farmers, and has accumulated for himself a goodly portion of this world's wealth to make himself comfortable in old age. Religiously, like the greater share of his nationality, he is a Catholic, and is faithful in his labors for, and self sacrificing in his devotion to, his church. In polities he is a democrat, but one of that kind who has the greatest consideration for the views of those opposed to him.\n\nDILLON\n\nBiographical History and Portrait Gallery of Scott County...1895; American Biographical Publishing Co.\n\nHon. John F. Dillon, one of the most distinguished members of the American Bar, widely known as the attorney of the Jay Gould estate and general counsel of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, was for many years a member of the Davenport Bar. He was born in Washington County, New York, on the twenty-fifth of December, 1831. His father was Thomas Dillon. His paternal and maternal grandfathers were each born in Ireland, and emigrated to this country at an early age and settled in the State of New York, whence his father immigrated to Iowa.\n\nIn 1838, when he was little over seven years old, his parents removed from Herkimer County, New York, to Davenport, in the then Territory of Iowa, in which city he has resided constantly ever since. He commenced the study of medicine at seventeen years of age, under the direction of Egbert S. Barrows, M.D., then the leading physician of Davenport. He attended two courses of medical lectures at the Keokuk Medical College, and graduated at the age of twenty-one years. He entered upon the practice of his profession, but finding, after a trial of a few months, that it did not accord with his tastes, he commenced reading law in the office where his sign as a physician was displayed. He was licensed as an attorney in Scott County, Iowa, in 1852, and at once commenced the practice of his profession, being soon afterward elected prosecuting attorney of the County.\n\nIn 1858, when twenty-seven years of age, he was elected by a majority greatly exceeding the majority of his party as the Republican candidate for Judge of the Seventh Judicial District of Iowa, a district then composed of the four populous Counties of Scott, Muscatine, Jackson and Clinton. The first work he did after his election was the giving of a close, critical study to all the then reported decisions of the Supreme Court of the State. This resulted in the preparation of his first legal work, \"A Digest of the Decisions of the Supreme Court of Iowa.\" In 1862 he was reelected without any opposition, the bar of the district, without distinction of party, uniting in a request to him to continue in the office. During the year following his second election he was nominated by the Republican party of his State for one of the judges of the Supreme Court, and was elected for a term of six years, taking his seat on the first of January, 1863. In 1869 he was unanimously renominated and reelected for another term of six years without any considerable opposition, but before he qualified under his second election, and while still holding the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, he was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate as Circuit Judge of the United States for the Eighth Judicial Circuit, embracing the States of Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and Arkansas, and later, also, the State of Colorado.\n\nDuring the time he was on the Supreme bench of the State he commenced collecting data for a work on \"Municipal Corporations,\" and having become bound to the publishers to prepare the treatise, he was compelled to write it out after his accession to the Federal bench. The work has an extraordinary sale. The first edition of twenty-five hundred copies, published in the year 1872, was exhausted in a few months, and the second edition, expanded into two volumes, was soon gone. The royalty to Judge Dillon on the published editions amounted to several thousand dollars.\n\nIn 1872, seeing the necessity for the publication of a first class law journal in the Valley of the Mississippi, he was instrumental in setting on foot the publication of the \"Central Law Journal,\" himself sketching out the plan and for a time contributing much of the material. Having given it a fair start, and being unable longer to give it supervision, he committed the management of it to Seymour D. Thompson, Esq., of St. Louis.\n\nWhile holding thirteen terms of court every year in several judicial districts and six States, he edited and published several volumes of \"Circuit Court Reports,\" mostly his own opinions.\n\nJudge Dillon's opinions while on the Supreme bench of the State may be found in the twelve hundred volumes of \"Iowa Reports\", from the fifteenth to the twenty-eighth volumes. During this period the judges adopted and rigidly maintained the habit of consulting thoroughly upon every case before the opinion was written. These consultations extended to an agreement upon the facts of the case, upon the judgment to be rendered, and upon the grounds on which the judgment should be placed. This system of voluntarily enforced discipline could not fail to be productive of important results, and the decisions of the Supreme Court of Iowa naturally acquired a high standing throughout the Union and carried with them at home the additional weight which attaches to the understanding that an opinion of the Court was not merely the opinion of a single judge.\n\nAfter serving with distinction several years on the Circuit Bench, Judge Dillon resigned to accept the position of general counsel of the Union Pacific Railroad Company and removed to New York City. Becoming intimately associated with the late Jay Gould, he has, since the death of that noted financier, sustained the relation of attorney to Gould's successors in the management of his vast estate.\n\nJudge Dillon's wife to whom he was married in 1853, was a daughter of Hon. Hiram Price, for many years a representative in Congress from the 2d Iowa district.\n\nMcILHINNEY\n\nHistory of Tama County, Iowa; Springfield, Ill.: Union Pub. Co., 1883.\n\nAndrew McIlhinney is a native of Ireland, born in March, 1829. He made his home in his native land and with his parents until he attained his majority, and then came to America, and settled in the state of Pennsylvania. His marriage with Miss Nancy A. Smith occurred in 1859, and the same year they came to Iowa, and settled in Geneseo township, on land which Mr. McIlhinney had previously entered. They have four children living- Estella J., Fayette F., Byron W. and Theressa O.\n\nAndrew McIlhinney, a native of Ireland, settled on section 20, in 1859, on land he had entered a few years previously and on which he had built a house the year before. In this house he now lives.\n\nBRADLEY\n\nHistory of Wapello County, Iowa; Chicago: Western Historical Company, 1878.\n\nBradley, Francis; Superintendent of County Poor Farm, Sec. 33; Center tp.; Contains 149 acres; born Oct 26, 1817 in Ireland; in 1836 came to Butler Co, Penn.; in 1837 to Ind.; in 1840 to Ohio and kept a dairy in vicinity of Cincinnati for about 15 years; in 1865 came to Jefferson co, Iowa; the following year removed to Wapello Co.

Married Johanna Bernard who was born in Canada in 1854.\n\nM'COURTNEY\n\nBiographical History and Portrait Gallery of Scott County...1895; American Biographical Publishing Co.\n\nJames McCourtney, a native of Waynesburg, Greene County, Pennsylvania, was born September 8, 1825, to Arthur and Nancy (Gordon) McCourtney. His father, who was born in Ireland, March 8, 1792, was a man of literary tastes and in early life fitted himself for teaching. Thinking to better his chances in his chosen calling the father left his native land in 1817 and came to America, landing at St. John's, Newfoundland. Thence he went to New York City, where he had a sister living. At her earnest solicitations he settled there and remained three years and prospered. In 1820, with a friend, McDonough, who came with him from Ireland, he made a trip over the mountains from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and thence to Wheeling, West Virginia, and from there to Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, where an uncle of McDonough lived. Their intention was to soon return to their native land, but this uncle took an interest in the young men and persuaded them to remain in Waynesburg, promising to secure schools for them, which he did. There our subject's father met and married the estimable and cultured lady above named, and continued to reside there till 1834, and then moved with his family to a farm in Perry County, Ohio, near Somerset.\n\nYoung McCourtney attended the public schools taught by his father, under whose preceptorship he received all his preliminary education. In 1848 he began the study of medical works and during the next three years was engaged in teaching, his purpose being to secure means with which to pay his expenses in college. He used all his spare time in study, and in October, 1851, entered the medical department of \"Western Reserve College,\" at Cleveland, Ohio. He made rapid progress in his studies and took a high stand and was graduated with honors.\n\nSoon after his graduation he began the practice of medicine at Rehoboth, Ohio, but six months later removed to New Lexington, in Perry County, near his father's home. Here, surrounded by his friends, who knew his abilities and the strenuous efforts he had made to fit himself for his profession, he had a good degree of success, and it was with reluctance that he left them for a new and untried field in the West, a step rendered necessary by the delicate health of his wife, Margaret F., nee Green, whom he married on June 30, 1853. She is a native of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and a woman of charming accomplishments and rare womanly virtues. Locating in Davenport Dr. McCourtney soon became well and favorably known, and his practice steadily increased from year to year, yielding him a most satisfactory income. In 1864 he was appointed \"contract surgeon\" in the army, and filled that office till the close of the war. In March, 1865, with a small detachment of soldiers he conveyed five hundred and three rebel prisoners of war from Rock Island to Richmond, Virginia.\n\nDr. McCourtney has always shown a commendable interest in public affairs and in whatever pertained to the welfare of his adopted city, and has been honored by his fellow-citizens with numerous positions of trust and responsibility. In 1885 he was elected coroner of Scott County for two years and reelected at the expiration of his term. He was again tendered the nomination in 1889 but declined it. Two years later he yielded to the persistent solicitations of his friends and accepted a nomination for the same office and was elected, and at the expiration of that term was elected for another two years' term. But Dr. McCourtney is in no sense a politician, being a man of modest, retiring disposition and of domestic tastes. In political sentiment he has always been a Democrat. In his chosen calling and in the quiet retirement and enjoyment of his home he finds his chief delight.\n\nThough in his seventieth year time has dealt kindly with him and he is uncommonly well preserved, a fact to be attributed in large measure to his simple and correct habits of life. He is courteous and genial in manner, and in all his intercourse and dealing with others has the bearing of a high-minded and cultured gentleman.\n\nHis estimable wife and devoted helpmeet died November 22, 1892, at the age of sixty-three years, ten months and eighteen days, beloved by all who came within the circle of her benign influence.\n\nOf ten children born to them but three survive, viz: Mary Eugene, known as \"Lillie\", Fannie Claudius and Ella. Of the others who lived to maturity, Eugene, born December 18, 1867, died October 11, 1888; Libbie, born October 10, 1865, died May 3, 1890; Nettie, born October 25, 1863, died February 18, 1891; Gertie, born November 10, 1869, died October 4, 1891.\n\nOLIVER\n\nThe History of Linn County, Iowa...Chicago: Western Hist.

His parents came to this country from Ireland in their youth, and were married on this side of the water. His father was a brass moulder and gas fitter by trade, and in this business was very successful. His mother died when he was very young, and he was taken into the family of her brother, with whom he resided and by whom he was educated.\n\nHis youth was spent in obtaining his schooling at the Christian Brothers' School and at a select school taught by John Cavanaugh, both being located in Pittsburgh. Here he remained until he was about seventeen years of age, at which time he learned the trade of stove moulding, with the firm of Graff & Co and continued at this work until he was twenty-one years of age. It was about this time that his uncle and his aunt with their family concluded to move to the West. It was their idea that in this section of the world would be found greater opportunities for the accumulation of money than could be found elsewhere. Mr. McDermott desired to leave his trade and take up the occupation of farming, and for that reason when the party came to the vicinity of Davenport they located, not in the city, but in the country - in Winfield township- where Mr. McDermott purchased a farm.\n\nMr. McSteen remained with his uncle, engaging in agricultural pursuits and giving up his trade also. They had reached Davenport some time during the spring of 1859, and Mr. McSteen remained with his uncle for about sixteen years, or until some time in 1876.\n\nHe accumulated enough during his career as a farmer to purchase an acre of ground, and built for himself a cozy home thereon. Later, as time dealt kindly with him, he got together funds to purchase a threshing machine, and during four or five seasons-some time in the 70s-he conducted a very prosperous business throughout the County. His machine was entirely destroyed by fire during the beginning of one season, and Mr. McSteen found himself face to face with a state of affairs which was calculated to discourage and dishearten the strongest of men. He owed several hundred dollars, which had been borrowed on the outfit, and although he was not compelled to do so, owing to the nature of his contract, he gave up his home in the country in the settlement of his debt. Friends and relatives had endorsed his notes, and, had he been so disposed, he could have allowed them to pay the sums necessary to square his accounts, but he chose the more honorable course, and as a result moved into the city of Davenport, where he had just enough money to pay one month's rent-leaving but fifty cents in his pocket.\n\nHe had absolutely no opportunities for making money. He cast about for some time in the effort to find the means to make a living, and finally got work over at Rock Island Arsenal as a teamster, which occupation he followed for a couple of years with reasonable good success.\n\nThis employment enabled him to purchase a lot and build himself a home in the City of Davenport, and in partnership with Joseph Nole he engaged in the implement business, having borrowed six hundred dollars. Misfortune again overtook him. This time, however, not in the same manner as before, although he lost everything. He had given promissory notes for the money he had borrowed, and as a result, when the failure of the firm took place, the little property which he had accumulated was seized, and he was left again without a home. This was early 1879.\n\nHe was a candidate during that spring for the city clerkship, and good fortune overtook him when he was elected to the office by a large majority. It was, perhaps, true that his business failure had something to do with his success at the election. However, it would appear that he must undoubtedly have been very successful in the office, for he was ten times reelected, and his friends insisted upon him running the eleventh time, when he was defeated, but not in fair competition. It happened that after that he had refused to allow his name his friends came to him and urged that he allow himself to be placed in nomination. This he absolutely refused to do at first, but finally consented to run independently, there having been previously chosen a representative from his party ranks. He consented to run for one election, only upon condition that the Republicans would not place a candidate in nomination. This the Republicans had promised, but they failed to fulfill their promise, and as a result there were three candidates in the field, the Republican winning.\n\nInside a week after the contest was decided Mr. McSteen went into the life, fire and accident insurance business, representing the following companies: American of Newark, New Jersey; Union of Philadelphia; Security of Davenport; Grand Rapids of Michigan; United States Mutual Accident Company; Firemen's of Newark, New Jersey; Eagle Fire of New York; State of Des Moines; Capital of Des Moines, and Manhattan Life Insurance Company. He has been very diligent in this and his success has been very good.\n\nMr. McSteen's political aspirations were not confined entirely to his ten years' service in the city clerk's office. While he was a resident of Winfield Township he was justice of the peace for four years and secretary of the school for six years, also township clerk for seven or eight years.\n\nSome time in 1890 he purchased a cigar store and has conducted a successful business in that line in connection with his insurance. He has his insurance office in his cigar and tobacco establishment, but regards the cigar business as of small importance compared with his insurance business.\n\nMr. McSteen is one of the substantial citizens of Scott County. He is possessed of an indomitable will and great energy, coupled with which he has ability and good business judgment. His career has been an interesting one in many respects, and owing to the misfortunes which have befallen him great credit is due him for what he has accomplished. He not only has sustained severe financial losses, but in 1861 met with the loss of his leg as the result of a threshing machine accident. A strange thing about this accident was the fact that Mr. McSteen had arranged all his affairs to enlist in an Iowa regiment for service in the War of the Rebellion. He was to have enlisted on the evening of the accident, and, in fact, had started for the place of enlistment, when he was called by some neighbors to assist in the work which later resulted in the loss of his limb and necessarily in the giving up of his military career.\n\nThrough adversity and trial Mr. McSteen has toiled onward, steadily and resolutely, until he has been successful to a degree of which he has a right to feel proud.\n\nHe was married, October 21, 1860, to Miss Elizabeth Loyd, a native of New York City. The children of this union are: Charles F., residing in Phillipsburgh, Kansas, who is an engineer; Edward, who died at the age of one year; John P., residing in Horton, Kansas, and also an engineer; J.E., connected with the train dispatcher's office on the Rock island Railroad; Thomas P., residing in Davenport, a timekeeper at the Eagle Manufacturing Company's works, and Florence and Gertrude, residing at home.\n\nMARTIN\n\nBiographical History and Portrait Gallery of Scott County...1895; American Biographical Publishing Co.\n\nCharles D. Martin is a native of Davenport, having been born, October 26, 1848, the son of Luke and Mary (Dyer) Martin, both natives of Ireland. Mr. Martin's father was a farmer, and came to Davenport in 1846, where he resided until his death in 1848. Mrs. Martin's death occurred in 1862. In the family there were but two children, James, residing now in the West, and Charles D., who is prominently identified with the business interests of the city in which he has spent his entire life.\n\nThe latter was educated in part in the public schools, and in part at Father Pelamorgues' school, an institution which flourished in Davenport for a number of years. Mr. Martin has been his own guide and counselor since he was thirteen years of age, and since that time has depended entirely upon his own resources for his advancement in the world. The first employment he had after leaving school was at farm work, for which he received eight dollars a month. Then he learned the harness maker's trade, in which he continued for about four years. Some time in 1868 he have up his trade to accept employment on one of the river packets, with which he was connected for a couple of years.\n\nIn 1870 he joined a party of Davenporters, who immigrated to the Greeley Colony, in Colorado. A spirit of adventure and a desire to accumulate money prompted Mr. Martin to undertake this trip. Greeley at that time was an insignificant hamlet, there being few people there, and the chances for making money did not seem at all promising. The outlook not being favorable, Mr. Martin remained there only about six months, returning to Davenport to take a position in the retail grocery establishment of P.F. Kelly. In this he remained for a couple of years, when he engaged in the grocery business on his own account in partnership with Daniel Leonard, under the firm name of Martin & Leonard. Mr. Leonard retired from the business at the end of a year and Mr. Martin continued the establishment in his own name for six years. In 1879 he formed a partnership with J.F. Kelly in the wholesale liquor business under the firm name of Kelly & Martin. He had disposed of his grocery establishment in which he had been quite successful, and in the new venture with Mr. Kelly was more than ordinarily prosperous. Their business continued until prohibition was inaugurated in this State. The latter had the effect of bringing about a dissolution of the partnership and Mr. Martin went into the wholesale fruit business, in partnership with O.C. Woods and George W. Noth, under the firm name of Martin, Woods & Comapny. This establishment is still doing business in Davenport, having since been incorporated. It is now known as the Martin-Woods Company.\n\nIn 1891 Mr .Martin was appointed County recorder to fill the unexpired term of Recorder Susenmiel. This position Mr. Martin held for six months, and in 1892 he organized the Davenport Bag and Paper Company in connection with George Noth and Gus Eckhardt. Of this company Mr. Martin is still the president.\n\nOn the first of January, 1892, Mr. Martin formed a partnership in the real estate business with George A. Koester, in which business he is engaged at the present time, giving the greater part of his attention to the transactions of this firm.\n\nHe has had a busy life for a young man, and the fact that he has succeeded in different kinds of business evidences his resourcefulness, sagacity and executive ability. He has to-day interests in a number of enterprises in the city, and has stock in concerns which are not mentioned above. He is a very energetic man, but has a great aversion to office work-in fact, this is one of his peculiarities, if it may be termed such-and for that reason he has never been able to content himself with a life of confinement. In his present active connection with the firm of Koester & Martin he does the greater part of what is commonly termed \"outside work\" in connection with the real estate transactions, and is better suited, perhaps, to this kind of work than to any other. He likes to come into contact with other men, enjoys the making of new acquaintances, and is full of enthusiasm concerning the prospects for Davenport's future greatness. He gives strangers a splendid impression of the city and its resources, and is an active promoter of its material growth and prosperity.\n\nHe has always taken a lively interest in the city's welfare, and has found time to serve the city in the capacity of alderman from the Fifth Ward for six years. He was for five years chairman of the finance committee and in this position many important matters came under his supervision. His record as an alderman is that of a man faithful and diligent in the performance of his obligations to his constituents.\n\nMr. Martin was married February 19, 1878, to Miss Johanna Grace, daughter of Edward Grace of this city. To this union have been born seven children: Mary Elizabeth, William Henry, Grace Alice, Raymond Luke, Charles D., Florence Gertrude and Charles Edward, the last of whom died in infancy. Mr. Martin has a handsome home located at the northwest corner of Eighth and Farnam streets.\n\nMcHUGH\n\nThe History of Linn County, Iowa...Chicago: Western Hist.
