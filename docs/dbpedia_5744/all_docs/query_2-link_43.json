        "text": "Norwich - James Cronin, whose tenure as president of the Dime Bank saw assets soar from $71 million to nearly $700 million, said Thursday he will retire this fall after a four-decade career at the community bank.\n\nNick Caplanson, the bank's chief financial officer, will assume the reins as president and chief executive officer of the Norwich-based Dime, whose bank network includes 11 branches stretching across southeastern Connecticut into Westerly.\n\nCronin, 65, who was born and raised in Norwich, is the second longest-serving president and chief executive of the Dime, holding the post for 24 years since being appointed in 1987. The Dime's first president in 1869, its founding year, was Edward Thompson, who served the institution for 28 years.\n\n\"It's extremely difficult to walk away,\" said Cronin during a Thursday news conference at bank headquarters officially announcing his retirement. \"I've been here for 40 years,\" he said. \"I love my job. This has been very rewarding. It's been more of an avocation than a job.\"\n\nCronin will retire in September, but he'll still serve as the bank board's chairman and as a director. \"It's time to shut off my calculator,\" quipped Cronin, who sported a green tie for St. Patrick's Day.\n\nCaplanson, who will be the Dime's 13th president, has extensive financial-service industry experience, having worked for three banks - the former Northeast Savings, Shawmut Bank and American Savings Bank - and as a consultant. Before his promotion, he served as a senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer for the bank, overseeing operations that included finance, investing and accounting. Caplanson, 48, a Franklin resident, said he was honored to serve as the new president, pledging to keep the bank local, community-focused and a mutual, or depositor-owned, institution.\n\nHe holds a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Connecticut and a master's degree in accounting from the University of Hartford. He also graduated from the American Bankers Association's senior leadership institute.\n\n\"I'm very confident about the Dime's future,\" Caplanson said. \"Our financial foundation ... is truly solid and exceptional.\"\n\nThe Dime ended 2010 on a strong financial note, with profits rising $1.2 million to $4.3 million. The bank saw robust gains, as well, in its loan portfolio and deposit base, and its assets grew in its investment services and trust division, one of the bank's growth areas.\n\nCronin has been a strong proponent of community-based mutual savings banks throughout his long career. He said he wanted his successor to be equally adamant that the Dime remain a mutual, community-focused institution.\n\nBesides his role as a leading banker in southeastern Connecticut for decades, Cronin also has been heavily involved in civic and community organizations and has been a driving force behind the need for more affordable housing in the region.\n\nThe Dime Bank Foundation, which Cronin was instrumental in forming in 1998, has committed funds to a host of community causes, from affordable-housing initiatives to food and shelter for the homeless. In addition, Cronin said he's proud of the thousands of hours of community service that his employees offer each year to the communities and organizations served by the regional bank.\n\n\"What the Dime is all about is its mutuality and sense of community,\" Cronin said. \"There is such a difference between a (stockholder-owned) institution and a mutual (depositor-owned) institution.\"\n\n\"Our country is really made up of community banks,\" added Cronin. \"They're an institution that stands out on Main Street, so to speak.\"\n\na.cronin@theday.com"
