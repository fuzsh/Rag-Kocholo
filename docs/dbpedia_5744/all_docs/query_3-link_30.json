        "text": "Sheep / Goat is the eighth in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac. The Years of the Sheep include 1919, 1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027, 2039, 2051...\n\nSheep (goat, or ram) is among the animals that people like most. It is docile, mellow, and timid. The white cute creature often reminds people of beautiful things. In Chinese culture, the sheep is considered auspicious since long time ago and it was often used to offer sacrifices and pray for good fortune. It was also once served as currency in ancient times, and thus the sheep represents rich and lucky.\n\nPeople born in the Year of the Sheep are gentle, calm, and decent, while sometimes they can be naive and emotional.\n\nEarthly Branch of Birth Year: Wei\n\nWu Xing (The Five Elements): Tu (Earth)\n\nYin Yang: Yin\n\nInput the names and birthdays of you and your partner, you can easily calculate your love compatibility according to the “Chinese Zodiac Compatibility Test” tool. It is also feasible to find your best zodiac matches in the following directions, and remember trying to avoid those bad matches.\n\nBest Matches: Rabbit, Horse, Pig\n\nBoth of the Sheep and the Rabbit are unselfish so that they can think of each other, even when meeting disagreements, which helps them become a good couple. Most Sheep people have clear plans when doing things and the Horses happen to have the same view. For the Sheep and the Pig, they have common interests in food and it is easy for them to lead a harmonious life.\n\nBad Matches: Ox, Tiger, Dog\n\nPeople born in the Year of the Sheep have less common language with the three zodiac signs and therefore they may not form a good bond with each other. As the Ox is always busy at work, the Sheep’s feelings may be ignored while the Tiger cannot give support to the Sheep at the appropriate time. It is also a little difficult for the Sheep to communicate effectively with the Dog.\n\nHow to Build Relationships with the Sheep\n\nPeople born in the Sheep years don’t like loneliness and they need accompanies from their partners. They will feel very left out when the partners are not by their side. So don’t make your Sheep partner feel lonely and neglected. Another thing that should be paid attention to is that the Sheep care more about the present than the past. They don’t like looking at the past and quibbling over small details in a relationship. So when getting along with the Sheep, don’t rake up the past if you have disagreements, or they will feel very frustrated and lose faith in the relationship."
