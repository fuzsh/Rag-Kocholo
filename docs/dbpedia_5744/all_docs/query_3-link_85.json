Use your 2021 birthday.\n\nView solution in original post\n\nIf you were born in 1931, your RMD age was 70 1/2.\n\nPer the IRS, the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act) became law on December 20, 2019. The Secure Act made major changes to the RMD rules. If you reached the age of 70½ in 2019 the prior rule applies, and you must take your first RMD by April 1, 2020. If you reach age 70 ½ in 2020 or later you must take your first RMD by April 1 of the year after you reach 72.\n\nRetirement Plans FAQs\n\n**Say \"Thanks\" by clicking the thumb icon in a post\n\n**Mark the post that answers your question by clicking on \"Mark as Best Answer\"\n\nThat didn't answer my question.
