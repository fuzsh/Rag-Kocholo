        "text": "Goat is the 8th animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac signs, coming after the Horse and before the Monkey. Recent years of the Goat include 2015, 2003, 1991, 1979, 1967, 1955, and 1943, with the next Goat year in 2027 (Year of the Fire Goat). It is associated with the earthly branch sign wÃ¨i.\n\nGoat is gentle and mild, sensitive and content, and may suffer bouts of pessimism when facing adverse circumstances. Theyâre passive and loyal in love, emotionally dependent on their partner, and prioritize the spiritual over the material.\n\nChinese Zodiac Years for Goat\n\nThe Chinese zodiac animals align with the lunar Chinese calendar, which varies slightly from our Gregorian calendar (the lunar calendar is commonly used in Chinese culture).\n\nWhen finding your animal sign, make note of when Chinese New Year begins, especially if you were born in January or February, since your zodiac may be from the previous year.\n\nChart of Years, Dates, and Elements for Goat Zodiac Signs\n\nGoat Year\n\nLunar Year Start Date\n\nLunar Year End Date\n\nElement\n\n1919\n\nFebruary 1, 1919\n\nFebruary 19, 1920\n\nEarth\n\n1931\n\nFebruary 17, 1931\n\nFebruary 5, 1932\n\nMetal\n\n1943\n\nFebruary 5, 1943\n\nJanuary 24, 1944\n\nWater\n\n1955\n\nJanuary 24, 1955\n\nFebruary 11, 1956\n\nWood\n\n1967\n\nFebruary 9, 1967\n\nJanuary 29, 1968\n\nFire\n\n1979\n\nJanuary 28, 1979\n\nFebruary 15, 1980\n\nEarth\n\n1991\n\nFebruary 15, 1991\n\nFebruary 3, 1992\n\nMetal\n\n2003\n\nFebruary 1, 2003\n\nJanuary 21, 2004\n\nWater\n\n2015\n\nFebruary 19, 2015\n\nFebruary 7, 2016\n\nWood\n\n2027\n\nFebruary 6, 2027\n\nJanuary 25, 2028\n\nFire\n\nPersonality Traits of Goat Signs\n\nGoats (sometimes also translated as Rams) are the most tender and mild of the zodiac signs, known for their honest, kind, and empathic nature. Theyâre selflessly giving, willing to lend their last penny to their closest friends without a second thought. When it comes to yin and yang, Goats are considered yin.\n\nTheyâre born compassionate, so when they meet others who have suffered, Goats may grow despondent themselves. Theyâre also creative, almost indulgently so, with no shortage of whimsical images and ideas floating around in their mind.\n\nHowever, it may be hard to pry these ideas out of Goats because they fear failure to the point of not being able to try again, which stems from stubborn pride that they possess.\n\nSocially, Goats are soft-spoken, elegant, and personable, meek on the outside yet strong and resilient on the inside. If anyone mistakes their docility as a weakness, however, Goats will be sure to deliver a rude awakening.\n\nGoat Strengths\n\nGoat people combine creativity with great enthusiasm for research, making them the ideal innovator for any field. Their thirst for knowledge means theyâll try to get to the bottom of everything they commit to with devotion.\n\nThey may also divert that creativity towards artistic pursuits. Their personality is introverted, but their shyness masks inner resources that they can draw upon in necessary situations when theyâll surprise everyone with their courage and passion.\n\nGoat Weaknesses\n\nGoats are easily hurt since beneath their mild manners lay an inferiority complex that makes them anxious to please. They fall in love easily, but when that love ends, Goat can become despondent and inconsolable.\n\nGoats can also be gullible and pestered into committing to something against their nature, often by family and friends. Theyâll need to learn to guard their own interests and stand their ground as they mature.\n\nGoat Zodiacs and the Five Elements Theory\n\nThe Chinese Five Elements Theory assigns one of the five elementsâMetal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earthâto each year, in addition to the zodiacs. Depending on the year they were born, there are different types of Goats with different personalities.\n\nLucky (and Unlucky) Things for Goats\n\nAs an Earth zodiac, Goat has luck with shades of brown and coffee, 2 and 7, and north. On the contrary, gold and silver tones, 4 and 9, and northeast should be avoided if possible.\n\nAccording to Chinese astrology, your zodiac birth year, or Ben Ming Nian, is expected to bring bad luck, so make sure to wear the color red when your year comes around (Year of the Goat).\n\nLucky Things\n\nLucky numbers: 2, 7\n\nLucky colors: Brown, Coffee\n\nLucky directions: North\n\nLucky flowers: Carnation, Primrose\n\nUnlucky Things\n\nUnlucky numbers: 4, 9\n\nUnlucky colors: Gold, Silver\n\nUnlucky directions: Northeast\n\nLove and Compatibility for Goats\n\nGoats remain their mild selves in love, although they have the tendency to lose themselves in a relationship by being overly obedient to their other half, that is, unless itâs something they care deeply about.\n\nItâs more likely that Goats will become pushovers rather than pushy in love. As such, most Goats will share compatibility with equally amiable zodiacs like Rabbit and Pig, although some prefer charismatic and leader-like signs like Horse.\n\nâ¤ï¸ Best Match: Goat and Rabbit\n\nThis is one of those couples that strikes everyone as enviably warm and caring towards each other since theyâre similar in temperament and the kind of laid-back lifestyle that they want to create for themselves.\n\nThere are still subtle differences to these mild zodiacs, as Rabbit is less easygoing and needs attention from their partner, while Goat is selfless and has no problem giving it to the object of their affection.\n\nâ¤ï¸ Best Match: Goat and Pig\n\nGoat appear mild, but theyâre actually romantic and creative, which no one recognizes and appreciates better than Pig when these two come together. Goats beauty, indeed, shines most brightly in the eye of their beholder.\n\nTheir home will be a sight to behold as well since Goatâs natural creative talents will have the backing of their generous Pig partner. Since both are agreeable introverts, theyâll love spending time together there.\n\nâ¤ï¸ Best Match: Goat and Horse\n\nHow different these neighboring zodiac signs are at first glance! Horse is such a brash adventurer, while Goat is the consummate homebody, but somehow, that makes them thick as thieves instead of keeping them apart.\n\nWhat Horse adores most in Goat is that this undemanding sign allows Horse to have their freedom, while Goat loves listening to their partnerâs adventures. Both will prove indispensable to this solid union in love.\n\nWorst Matches: Ox, Rat\n\nGoat and Ox: If this pair ends up together, both must do their best not to interfere with their partnerâs privacy. Keeping a distance from each other is the only way for Ox and Goat to make their love work.\n\nEven then, once jealousy and possessiveness permeate the romance, itâs basically over between them, as both will unleash their most stubborn selves and collide. Itâll be difficult to communicate and get along with each other.\n\nGoat and Rat: This is not an ideal marriage, but thankfully, they most likely wonât find their way to each other, whether at work or in love, since both are introverts who arenât used to being the pursuer.\n\nItâs odd that even though both want a stable family life, somehow, Goat and Rat are unable to provide that sense of security for each other. Over time, the resentment builds until the relationship disintegrates.\n\nCareers Fit for the Chinese Zodiac Goat\n\nGoats may appear mild-tempered about everything, but they would still hate to work on anything they dislike, in which case theyâll protest firmly but without aggression, explaining their point of view with patience and endurance.\n\nTheyâre motivated to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to become subject-matter experts while making full use of their talents and creativity. With space, Goats will almost certainly achieve success and financial abundance.\n\nIn general, Goats dislike being in a leadership position. They must look to others to give them guidance and support when the going gets tough, but they possess plenty of grit to excel in a field of study that suits their temperament.\n\nBest careers for Goats\n\nLiterary Agent\n\nResearch Scientist\n\nWriter\n\nArtist\n\nEditor\n\nWorst careers for Goats\n\nTrader\n\nPolitician\n\nAthlete\n\nAttorney\n\nReal Estate Agent\n\nHealth and Lifestyle Advice for Goats\n\nGoats are blessed with good health, and their mild temperament keeps their mind free from worry as well. Theyâre advised not to socialize too much, especially over meals, however, as theyâre prone to weight gain.\n\nConsider abstaining from smoking and alcohol if you can help it, Goat, since youâre at risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. If you can manage it, try moving a bit more.\n\nGoat and the 12 Zodiac Animals (Origin Story)\n\nGoat is honored as the 8th animal, even though itâs not the most conspicuous of animals. How did this happen? The Chinese have an origin story, or myth, that explains how the 12 zodiac animals were chosen.\n\nAt the beginning of time, the heavenly Jade Emperor held a race across the celestial river to select the zodiac animals. Goat is neither ambitious nor confident, unlike the Tiger, Rat, or Ox, but decided to participate just to take part.\n\nDuring the race, Goat decided to just keep pace with its friend Horse. Without breaking a sweat and following Horseâs hooves, Goat managed 8th place â ahead of Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig â and became enshrined as one of the revered zodiac animals.\n\nFamous People Born in the Year of the Goat\n\nGoats may not be striking in the same way as Dragon or Horse, but this mild and patient artistic type can, and often does, achieve fame and fortune as experts in their chosen field.\n\nRobert De Niro: August 17, 1943, Water Goat\n\nJulia Roberts: October 28, 1967, Fire Goat\n\nSteve Jobs: February 24, 1955, Wood Goat\n\nKourtney Kardashian: April 18, 1979, Earth Goat\n\nEd Sheeran: February 17, 1991, Metal Goat\n\nBill Gates: October 28, 1955, Wood Goat\n\nNicole Kidman: June 20, 1967, Fire Goat\n\nFrida Kahlo: July 6, 1907, Fire Goat\n\nGoatâs Horoscope for 2024 (Year of the Dragon)\n\nThe year 2024 is the year of the Dragon, which doesnât affect Goats greatly. Thatâs to say, whether Goat wants to succeed, coast along, or take it easy, theyâre on their own this year.\n\nIf you decide to work with diligence on your endeavors this year, Goat, your sweat and tears will be rewarded, and not through any cosmic favors. Isnât that even betterâto know you earned everything?\n\nGoatâs 2024 Love and Relationships Forecast\n\nGoat can maintain the status quo in their love life with ease in 2024, meaning your marriage or partnership isnât likely to suffer unforeseen circumstances. But if you start out single, youâll probably stay single.\n\nUnless, Goat, you want to be proactive for once in your life? You could sign up for that dating app or ask a friend to play matchmaker. Ultimately, if youâre happy being single, enjoy yourself!\n\nThose who are paired off can rest easy knowing their relationship wonât change much in 2024. That is, again, unless Goat decides to proactively change something, whether that means getting engaged or trying for a baby.\n\nCareer Prospects for Goat in 2024\n\nGoatâs career will be smooth sailing in 2024.

Itâs as easy as putting your knowledge and experience to good use.\n\nAlthough youâre not known for your sociability, you should know that youâre well-liked.

Keep that up, Goat, especially since there arenât any major troubles ahead.\n\nBut may we suggest trying a gentle, slow-moving sort of sport? Perhaps yoga or hiking and cycling in natureâmoving your body ensure that you can occasionally indulge your appetite without paying the price.\n\nYou usually strike a good balance between alone time and socializing.
