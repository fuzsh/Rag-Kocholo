He had been unwell in the buildup to Munster's 2019–20 Champions Cup round 2 match against Racing 92 on 23 November 2019, and had been prescribed antibiotics by Munster's team doctor. However, when Cronin collected the prescription, he was mistakenly given the prescription for a different person with the same name by the pharmacy. When selected for an in-competition anti-doping test following the match, Cronin tested positive for two banned substances: prednisolone and prednisone, neither of which Cronin had a therapeutic use exemption for. Though the independent judicial officer found that there \"was no significant fault on behalf of the player, and that there were clear and compelling mitigating factors\", it was determined that Cronin bore some responsibility for his failed test.[30]\n\nCronin was released by Munster at the end of the 2020–21 season.[31] His final appearance for the province was in their 31–27 win against Cardiff Blues in round 4 of the Pro14 Rainbow Cup on 28 May 2021.[32]\n\nBiarritz\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing his release by Munster, Cronin joined French club Biarritz, who had recently been promoted back to the Top 14, ahead of the 2021–22 season.
