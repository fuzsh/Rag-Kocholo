        "text": "As a kid he was tossed about some. One minute he’s being born in England, his extravagant dad setting him up in life with the extravagant name of Kiefer William Frederick Dempsey George Rufus Sutherland, the next he’s living in Los Angeles. He’s three. His mom, Canadian actress Shirley Douglas, and his dad aren’t getting along. In fact, his dad is carrying on with Jane Fonda. The marriage dissolves. His mom goes away, leaving Kiefer and his twin sister, Rachel, behind. It’s during this time that Kiefer evolves his first real memory of his father. His father, the larger-than-life movie star, wears his hair long, wild and tangled, with a great big beard to match. A leather coat occludes his shoulders. He drives his son to preschool in a Ferrari he won in a poker game. His father is “different.” The other parents stare. Kiefer likes how they stare and by his mid-twenties he will dress similarly, drawing similar stares, albeit from within a 1970 beater Porsche 911, not a Ferrari.\n\nAfter six months, his mother returns and eventually takes him back to Canada. Over the next ten years he attends seven different schools, learning to make friends by making the other kids laugh. He’s insecure, nervous, a compensating cutup but not a great student. In his fifteenth year, he drops out of school, determined to be an actor, despite the usual parental misgivings. Shortly thereafter, he lands the lead in a coming-of-age film, The Bay Boy, and is nominated for a Genie award, Canada’s Oscar. With a $30,000 payday in his pocket, he descends on New York and the actor’s life. A year later, nearly broke, he moves to L.A. and for a few months lives out of his sweet ’67 Mustang. In 1985, he gets his first Hollywood movie, from Sean Penn: a small role in At Close Range (with the greatest tag line ever: “Like Father. Like Son. Like Hell.”), most of which ends up on the cutting-room floor. Around the same time, he lands a part in the Steven Spielberg TV show Amazing Stories, and, as he likes to say, “When Steven Spielberg hires you, that’s good for three jobs easy.” And so it was, first as a gang leader in Stand by Me, then as the most raffishly charming vampire ever in The Lost Boys and as a sensitive cowboy in Young Guns.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nHe’s thinking, “Well, this is easy. I am that good. And it’s just going to keep going.”He was twenty-one years old. What else would he think?\n\nBut what interests me most about this period in Kiefer’s life are those six months early on that he spent separated from his mom. He says it’s no big deal – “It wasn’t unusual for any member of my family to go away for quite some time” – but you have to wonder.\n\nI ask him if he knows where she went. “I’ve never been really quite sure,” he says. “I think she may have gone back to Canada for a while.” So, he’s never asked her about it. “And have you ever talked to your father about his affair with Jane Fonda?”\n\n“No.” “What do you imagine that conversation would have been like?” “He’d probably say, ‘I fell in love.’ I understand that. People do. And when they’re falling in love, they believe in everything so strongly and passionately, this kind of heightened experience, that it’s very hard to judge somebody for it.”\n\nRelated\n\nThat, of course, is what the adult says looking back at the child. How the child might have felt, and how those feelings might have worked on the child in later life, Kiefer doesn’t come out and say.\n\nThese days, the neighborhood he chooses to live in is predominantly Salvadoran, and at night there, walking his dog, a border collie named Molly, he’s been held up with a gun pressed to his noggin. His place is huge, almost a quarter-acre in size, not cut up into rooms but left wide open, with only a half-wall to partition off the sleeping area. Showing me around, he says, “It took a while to get used to sleeping in a barn.” Kiefer has at times led a kind of messy life, but his home suggests an almost obsessive attachment to order. Nothing is out of place. His bed is made and looks freshly plumped; the pack of Camel filters on the bedside table has been set down square to the corners. No dirty dishes or food crumbs mottle his kitchen sink. His guitar collection is neatly arranged according to make and body style.\n\nEventually, this attention to neatness comes up during a discussion about his various possible failings as a boyfriend. “I think I’m pretty demanding as a person,” he says. “I like things to be a certain way, everything from being on time to being tidy. I haven’t been flexible with that. I mean, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve hopefully become a lot more flexible. But, of course, I am living alone.”\n\n“Does disorder bother you?” I ask. “I had the 24 cast over for dinner one night and I heard that Reiko Aylesworth, who played Michelle, said, ‘It’s so nice that he cleaned up his place.’ Someone else said, ‘He didn’t clean it up for you, honey. It’s always this clean.’ And her response was, ‘Ewwww.’\n\nBut there’s so much disorder in every other aspect of what we do, if you can control your environment at home, you do it.” “It’s a little freaky to walk into,” I say. “Yeah?” he says, and he says it with a smile.\n\nWhy “24” succeeds on the level that it does – since 2001, it’s won or been nominated for dozens of awards, topped critics’ lists and been dominant in its time slot – Kiefer isn’t exactly sure, though he does have one main theory: “People respond to a guy who is trapped and succeeds on some level and fails on another.” It’s glib to say so, but that’s probably also true of Kiefer himself. For instance, one problem with being tied to a show like 24 is that, while you might succeed on some level with girls – with the occasional one-night stand and so forth – you can forget about anything deeper. Kiefer often, and at length, bemoans this fact. “I’ve had one-night stands, but they’re just not my nature,” he says. “I think of myself as much more of a romantic than that. The point of being with someone is out of the hope and desire for connection. Otherwise, you might as well just go home and masturbate. Actually, there is someone who I really like a lot."
