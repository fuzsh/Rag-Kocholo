In addition to donors who supported our program by increasing an existing scholarship or establishing another scholarship, the following new scholarship donors made generous gifts in support of undergraduate named scholarships.\n\nBy endowing a scholarship, you can support future generations of first-rate students who, if given the opportunity, can change the world."
