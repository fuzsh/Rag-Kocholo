        "text": "115 Years Ago – Jan. 9, 1908\n\nTea, anyone? — Andrew Murchie of Benton, New Brunswick, salesman for Red Rose Tea, was in town Saturday calling on his customers. He was the guest of Frank Mills during his stay.\n\nImportant business change in Caribou — Messrs. J.A. Clark and John F. Jerrard, who have been engaged in the dry and fancy goods business in Caribou under the name of Clark & Jerrard, have dissolved partnership and have formed a stock company under the name of Clark-Jerrard Company. This business was established by J. A. Clark nearly 30 years ago and since that time each year has shown some marked advancement in each department of the business. The forming of this corporation will be another step forward for this enterprising concern..\n\n100 Years Ago – Jan. 11, 1923\n\nOff to Boston — Miss Nellie Tarris, a popular milliner of Caribou, left for Boston last week where she will spend a couple of months getting new ideas for the spring millinery. Before returning she will attend the New York and Boston Spring Millinery Openings.\n\nReturning from the woods — E.J. Mushrow returned to Fort Fairfield Monday noon from New Sweden, where he had been for eight weeks cutting pulpwood for the Briggs Hardware Company, which has recently cut about 250 cords in New Sweden. The same concern is still getting cut hardwood and pulpwood in Washburn with a good crew.\n\n25 Years Ago – Jan. 14, 1998\n\nCaribou restaurant closes doors again — A well-known Caribou landmark has closed its doors again. Yusef’s on Bennett Drive reopened last fall after the Northern Maine Development Commission and the Caribou Development Corporation loaned Joe Hackett $250,000 to buy the building and support some of the capital costs. Hackett’s decision to close was not announced to Yusef’’s employees until Tuesday. A total of 58 people were employed there and the organizations are trying to find someone to take over the building and the business.\n\nBarber celebrates 50 years — Laurien Nadeau of Caribou recently received several honors for having been a barber for a half a century. Honoring him at his current employer, Classic Cuts in Caribou was: state Sen. Leo Kieffer, R-Caribou; state Rep. James Donnelly, R-Presque Isle; wife Marie Nadeau; Ouellette Variety owner Robert Ouellette, Marlene McClelland, owner of Classic Cuts; Laurien Nadeau; Rob Kieffer; Classic Cuts employee Sherry Knight; Malachi Anderson; and Don Collins. Kieffere presented Nadeau with a plaque from the state Senate and House of Representatives."
