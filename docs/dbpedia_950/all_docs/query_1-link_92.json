        "text": "Then just 15 years of age, driving for Carlin, the Brit stormed to the seriesâ€™ inaugural title, collecting eight victories and a further seven podium finishes to beat nearest rival Ricky Collard to the crown by 42 points becoming our very first champion.\n\nFrom there he went on to win the New Zealand Toyota Racing Series, Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup and Northern European Cup and the 2017 European Formula 3 Championship.\n\nNorris made his debut in the Formula One World Championship in 2019 at the Australia Grand Prix with Mclaren and has most recently signed a contract extension with the team as he enters his sixth F1 season.\n\nJamie Caroline graduated into British F4 in 2016 off the back of two seasons in the Ginetta Junior Championship. 2017 saw him win eight of the opening 11 races which set him on his way to the title that year. Since racing in British F4, Jamie has been seen in the USF2000 Championship and British GT winning the GT4 category in 2020.\n\nOscar Piastri made his debut in 2017 as part of the TRS Arden Junior Racing team. He claimed six wins and six pole positions to finish as the runner-up to Jamie Caroline. The following years saw Oscar in the Formula Renault Eurocup championship which lead him to becoming the 2019 champion.\n\nA period of dominance followed which saw Oscar win the FIA Formula 3 Championship in 2019 and the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2020. With his championship, Piastri joined an illustrious company of Nico Rosberg, Lewis Hamilton, Nico HÃ¼lkenberg, Charles Leclerc, and George Russell, as the only drivers to win the F2 title in their rookie seasons. He also became just the fifth driver after Hamilton, HÃ¼lkenberg, Leclerc and Russell to win the F3 title, and then the F2 title the following year, and the first driver to win three consecutive F1 feeder seriesâ€™ championships, with his 2019 Formula Renault Eurocup title.\n\nAfter a year on the sidelines, Oscar was announced as Lando Norrisâ€™s teammate at McLaren and recently signed a extension to stay at the team until the end of 2026.\n\nSingle seater rookie Kiern Jewiss delivered Double R Racing their first title in Britainâ€™s FIA Formula 4 series in 2018 when he entered the series. It was after this in 2019 and 2020 he went to race in the British Formula 3 championship and then moved out of single seater racing into the Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britian. In his debut season he went on to finish 3rd in the Pro category and took top honours in 2022 with Team Parker Racing. Jewiss has since competed in GT World Challenge Europe and Intercontinental GT Challenge.\n\nMaloneyâ€™s first single seater season was with British F4 in 2019 for Carlin Motorsport. He went on to win ten races and was on the podium 15 times in his rookie season. This kicked off his journey trough the motorsport ranks by taking the title in his first attempt. From there he races in the Euroformula Open Championship and Formula Regional European Championship. 2022 saw him race in the FIA Formula 3 Championship then move into FIA Formula 2 in 2023.\n\nMaloney has previously been apart of the Red Bull Junior Team and was Red Bull Racings reserve driver in 2023. In January 2024, he was announced as part of the Sauber Academy and will serve as the Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber reserve driver that year.\n\nLuke Browning joined the British F4 Championship in 2019 and won his first single seater race at the season opener, Brands Hatch. The season was memorable for the tight battle for the title between Browning and Carlinâ€™s Zak Oâ€™Sullivan. He took seven wins, six poles and sixteen podiums. In 2021 he moved into the ADAC Formula 4 and GB3 categories where he would claim the GB3 championship in the following year. In 2023 Browning signed with Hitech for the FIA Formula 3 and is continuing that relationship into 2024. A stand out win for Browning was his Macau Grand Prix victory in 2023.\n\nMatthew Rees was another rookie who made their single eater debut in British F4 after a successful karting career. He took double pole position at round 1 and another double pole at the second round at Snetterton Circuit. Entering the final round of the season in the championship lead Rees finished in the top 5 in all three races, enough to seal the overall title and rookie title. Following on from his success in the British F4 Championship he went on to race in the GB3 championship.\n\nIrelandâ€™s Alex Dunne prevailed, driving for Hitech GP in 2022 winning the championship after he started his season out in commanding fashion, winning the pair of main races at the season opener at Donington Park, whilst taking second in the reversed-grid race. Despite missing the final round, instead having chosen to complete his campaign in Italian F4, Dunne was crowned champion at the final weekend, with his points gap having been insurmountable. Following on from this he raced in the GB3 chamionship in 2023 and has announced his move into the FIA Formula 3 Championship with MP Motorsport for the 2024 season.\n\nIn 2022, the talented Kiwi teenager from Christchurch, secured a dream move to the ROKiT F4 British Championship certified by FIA. Despite being the youngest driver on the grid and, still aged 14, being too young to contest the opening three races, Sharp was quick to underline his potential and in the following year he became the 2023 British F4 Champion. Sharp was then awarded with UKâ€™s National Racing Driver of the Year for 2023, was presented the coveted Henry Surtees Trophy, for the most outstanding performance by a BRDC Rising Star."
