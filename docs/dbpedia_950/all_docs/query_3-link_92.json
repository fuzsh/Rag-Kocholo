        "text": "Abstract\n\nIntercellular communication between different cell types in solid tumors contributes to tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. The secretome of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) plays major roles in these processes. Using human mammary CAFs, we unveil a mechanism of cell-cell communication between CAFs with myofibroblast phenotype and endothelial cells (ECs) based on intercellular protein transfer through extracellular vesicles (EVs). CAFs transfer proteins to ECs, including plasma membrane receptors, which we have identified by using mass spectrometry- based proteomics. Using THY1 as an example of transferred plasma membrane-bound protein, we show that CAF-derived proteins can influence how ECs interact with other cell types. Here, we show that CAFs produce high amounts of matrix-bound EVs that have a key role in protein transfer. Hence, our work paves the way for further studies to understand how CAF-derived matrix-bound EVs influence tumor pathology by regulating functions of neighboring cancer, stromal and immune cells."
