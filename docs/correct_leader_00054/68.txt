Introduction

Japanese politics is notoriously unstable. Although the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) managed to clutch to power for half a century (from 1958 to 2009), this is only a semblance of stability. Factions within the LDP act almost like rival political parties, making governments fall every year and a half in average. Other political parties have changed name, dissolved and reformed new parties with a disconcerting regularity. Japanese Prime Ministers rarely last long in office. Apart from the 7 oligarchs who monopolized the post of PM during all the Meiji and the early Taisho periods, Japanese Prime Ministers have since stayed in office for an average of only 2 years.

Under the Meiji Constitution which lasted from 1885 to 1947, Japan has had 35 Prime Minsters holding 44 offices. 9 Prime Ministers have served more than once, with Itô Hirobumi serving 4 times and Katsura Tarô 3 times.

The longest serving Prime Minister was Katsura Tarô (almost 12 years in office), followed by Itô Hirobumi (7.5 years in office), then Saionji Kimmochi and Yamagata Aritomo (both nearly 4 years).

The average length of office was 21.7 months, with Prime Ministers changing in average 1.5 year.

Under the New Constitution imposed by the Americans after WWII, there has been 31 Prime Ministers, and only one (Junichiro Koizumi) served more than once. 8 Prime Ministers have served for less than a year, including 4 for 3 months or less.

In comparison:

The 23 US presidents from 1885 to 2012 have stayed in office for an average of 5 years and 6 months.

There has been 25 Prime Ministers in the UK from 1885 to 2012, holding their post for an average of 5 years.

France has had 23 presidents from 1887 to 2011 (average 5.3 years so far), 8 from 1947 to 2011 (average 9.2 years) , and only three in the 30 years from 1981 to 2011.

Pre-WWII connections of post-war Prime Ministers

Several politicians, including Prime Ministers, of the post-war era had clear involvement with the pre-war militarist government. This was allowed to happen because of the relative lenience of the American victors. Not only did they keep emperor Hirohito rather than trying him as class A war criminal, but they showed great generosity toward war-time politicians and bureaucrats, only executing 7 military leaders (among whom war-time PM Tojo Hideki).

Yoshida Shigeru, who was already ambassador to Italy and the Uk before the war, served as Prime Minister from May 1946 to May 1947, then again from October 1948 to December 1954.

Hatoyama Ichiro, who was a Diet member since 1915, education minister between 1931-34 (heavy brainwashing period) and leader of the prewar Seiyukai party and postwar Liberal party, also became Prime Minister after the war, serving from 1954 to 1956. He had been banned from becoming PM during the American occupation because of his prewar and war-time activities, but was elected PM just 2 years after the Americans left !

But the worst connection I can see with the pre-1945 militarist government is Kishi Nobusuke, who worked for the Ministry of Commerce and Industry from 1920 to 1935, then was appointed by general Tojo Hideki in person as Minister of Commerce and Industry in 1941 - position which he held till the surrender of Japan in 1945. Actually, Kishi was imprisoned as a class A war criminal until 1948, but was found not guilty (despite his fierce nationalistic views). He served as Prime Minister from 1957 to 1960. Note that his brother, Sato Eisaku, was also PM from 1964 to 1972.
