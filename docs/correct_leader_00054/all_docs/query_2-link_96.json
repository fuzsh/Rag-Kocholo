        "text": "I had stumbled upon this book after conversing with a Chinese colleague on the Sino-Japanese War (1937-45), and had inquired about the involvement of the emperor Hirohito in sanctioning the war. He was after all the supreme commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese armed forces and symbolically revered as a god-like figure. My inquiry was spurred on as I became a teaching assistant for a course on war and society, and I thought more deeply about the Japanese war culture after encountering John Dower’s War Without Mercy which is a description of how derogatory racial depiction of the other side fired up the American and Japanese public during World War II. Noriko Kawamura, a historian based in the University of Washington, aptly provides the answer for the inquiry on Hirohito’s involvement.\n\nThe essence of the argument is that Hirohito has been a reluctant warrior, but felt that he could not really resist the overwhelming force of argument and political influence of the generals. He was a weak leader. Kawamura cited Weber three times (p. 100, 110, 161) to claim that in an absolute monarchy, the seemingly powerful monarch has to blindly trust the powerful bureaucracy in deciding on policy. To some extent, this cannot be entirely surprising, because the emperor is born into a family of rulers and encounters an army of bureaucracy once assuming the throne. Should the treasury cut taxes to stimulate the economy or raise infrastructure spending to stem unemployment? Should the army go to war to preserve access to natural resources or work on maintaining peace for as long as possible?\n\nIt would be difficult to expect Hirohito to have full oversight of the practicalities of governance. After all, he became heir apparent at the tender age of 11 (1912), when the death of his grandfather, putting an end to the long Meiji era, resulted in his father Yoshihito assuming power. Unfortunately, for the young Hirohito, his father was not a very capable ruler, suffering from mental illness, so the court officials made Hirohito the Regent at age 20 (thus representing his father in all important decisions), and at age 25 after Yoshihito passed away, became the emperor of Japan.\n\nBut does Hirohito lack any knowledge and independent will? Kawamura’s account does not suggest his lack of agency. While he relented to the military pressure to invade Manchuria (1931), mainland China (1937), southeast Asia (1941) and attack the Americans at Pearl Harbor (1941), his reservations delayed the attack on Pearl Harbor by a full two months. Most decisively, when the cabinet and the military were internally divided in the days before unconditional surrender, Hirohito took the unilateral initiative to announce unconditional surrender shortly after the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Soviet invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria.\n\nDuring Hirohito’s reign the most important advisers were the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal (Makino Nobuaki and Kido Koichi were the most influential ones), the cabinet led by the Prime Minister (the most pre-eminent during the duration of the war was Tojo Hideki, 1941-44), the War Minister (and the underlying ministry), the Navy Minister, the Chief of the Army General Staff, and the Chief of the Imperial Navy General Staff.\n\nHow was Hirohito convinced to approve the war? There were three political factions in Japan in the 1920s, which included a diplomatically oriented civilian government, the politically cautious court advisers and the war-hungry military. Since the late nineteenth century, the prime minister would either come from the military (especially the army, in some cases the navy) or from the major political party (Rikken Seiyukai an later Kenseikai and Rikken Minseito). But the civilian government became gradually weaker, culminating in the assassination of the civilian prime minister Hara Takashi by a right-wing railroad switchman in 1921. Hara’s critics accused him of being too conciliatory, allowing for self-rule in Japanese occupied Korea, or agreeing to the Paris Peace Conference and joining the League of Nations. The civilian government faction was further weakened in another failed assassination plot directed against Hamaguchi Osachi in 1930. Hamaguchi surrendered power the next year as he became physically unable to rule.\n\nHamaguchi, a civilian government bureaucrat, had taken over in 1929, when the Great Depression was harming the Japanese economy (a point that has not been mentioned by Kawamura’s account), and he implemented highly deflationary austerity policies, which increased the economic pain on the Japanese economy (similar to Heinrich Bruning in Weimar Germany on the eve of the Nazi election victory in 1932). This situation had empowered the ultra-nationalist military faction, which became incensed over budget cuts affecting the military, and claimed that military expansionism could furnish Japan with the necessary raw materials and markets to grow.\n\nHamaguchi’s successor Wakatsuki Reijiro was not more successful than his predecessor in stemming the militarist-nationalist faction’s rise. Senior-level officers in the Kwantung Army that were garrisoning the Kwantung Leased Territory (in what is now Liaoning) went rogue and ordered an invasion of the entire Manchuria (northeast Chinese provinces) in 1931. Hirohito and the civilian cabinet had opposed the seizing of Manchuria, but once it was taken, there was no turning back. Hirohito feared that restraining the military too much could result in a coup d’etat, which could destabilize the country.\n\nThe end to civilian rule came when another civilian successor prime minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated in May 1932, putting the military firmly in control of the civilian government (though they allowed non-partisan civilians run the office as well, though not during the war with the US). In 1933, Japan facing the ostracism in the League of Nations for the Manchuria invasion withdrew from the League of Nations, which came with the quiet complaint by Hirohito. In 1935, the war opposing Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Makino Nobuaki resigned facing external pressure from the military leaders, which strengthened the war voices sitting next to Hirohito.\n\nOn February 26, 1936, the radical army faction that was upset about the accommodationist foreign policy wanted to overthrow the civilian elements of the government and army officers that were considered too moderate. The young army officers also were upset about being excluded from joining the elite officer corps, hoping for advancement after the coup. The alarmed Hirohito sent Army Minister Yoshiyuki Kawashima to successfully crush the coup attempt. But the coup attempt only further consolidated the power of the military.\n\nIn 1937, the army leadership took advantage of provoked border skirmishes with China to launch a full-scale invasion of China proper. Hirohito worried that the invasion of China would drag out too long and could result in war with the US, an even more formidable enemy. Japan, by controlling much of China, also shared a considerable border with the Soviet Union, which could also turn against Japan in an inopportune moment. Nonetheless, the obliterated influence of peace-oriented civilian government bureaucrats, and the full control of the military policies by the military itself allowed the military to portray a rosy image to the emperor about the prospects for succeeding in war.\n\nGenerals convinced Hirohito that a war with China could be won in three months time, which is reminiscent to Imperial Germany’s hope to defeat the French in six weeks in World War I (they were not successful until World War II). Hirohito welcomed an invasion on Shanghai and Nanjing after the Navy convinced him of a quick defeat of Chinese forces (there was actually heavy Chinese resistance, which encouraged Japanese soldiers to pillage and rape after capturing Nanjing). As this prediction turned out to be false, Hirohito hoped to conclude the conflict with China as early as in 1938, even as the generals insisted on continuing the war with China until the KMT (Nationalist) army of Chiang Kai-shek was defeated.\n\nThe next challenge was the signing of the treaty with the Axis powers (Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy), which Hirohito opposed, because he did not want to further antagonize the Americans. But because he was isolated, he signed the treaty in 1940. With the increasing American sanctions, which crippled the Japanese supply to oil, iron and other vital military resources, the generals became increasingly hawkish on declaring war on the US. Hirohito’s opposition delayed the attack on Pearl Harbor from mid-October to the beginning of December 1941. A September 1941 resolution passed by the Japanese government sanctioned military preparations against the US as well as a simultaneous diplomatic attempt to maintain peace if the US agreed to restore trade relations with Japan and accept Japanese demands for keeping parts of China under occupation and withdraw from southern Indochina. The end of November was listed as deadline.\n\nOn October 18, 1941, the Army general Tojo Hideki became prime minister, who was inching for war as did much of the rest of the army staff. Why did Hirohito appoint him? Apparently, Hirohito harbored the hope that by appointing a high-level general, he would be able to restrain the most extreme pro-war factions within the army. (Interestingly, the German Centrist Party had endorsed a coalition government with Hitler as chancellor in 1932, similarly hoping that the Nazis could be restrained by the moderates.)\n\nHirohito instructed Tojo and the general staff to primarily negotiate for peace, and Tojo agreed, although his mindset was ready for war. The ultimatum to the US was formulated in a way that allowed for very little wiggle room. Either the US agrees to the Japanese demands for restoration of trade relations with minimal territorial losses to the Japanese empire, or there will be war. When Hirohito approved of the ultimatum resolution, he had the strange hope that the Americans might agree to it. The US rejected the Japanese proposals on November 26, and on November 30, Hirohito convened the generals and admirals to seal the war decision. Hirohito spoke with Navy Minister Shimada and Admiral Nagano, asking them whether they had sufficient resources to conduct a war with the US. Shimada replied “Both men and supplies are fully prepared and we are waiting for an imperial mandate.” (p.109)\n\nThe Japanese Navy struck Pearl Harbor on December 7, hitting all eight US Navy battleships out of which four sank. The Japanese also destroyed three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, one minelayer, 188 aircraft,killed 2,403 Americans and wounded 1,178. The US declared war on Japan, and Germany declared war on the US, holding their end of the bargain in the Axis Treaty.\n\nHirohito was very pessimistic about the war, and as the Americans began their island-hopping campaign of reconquering the Pacific islands and southeast Asia, out-producing the Japanese in aircraft and vessel production, Hirohito became increasingly upset, blaming the Japanese losses on the lack of army and navy coordination. These were two independent military branches with their own command structures. There are scholarly disputes about how well Hirohito was briefed during the course of the war, but in Kawamura’s account, the information flows were restricted by Prime Minister Tojo, which might have depicted a highly rosy version of actual events in the battlefield, underestimating Japanese losses and exaggerating the losses of the enemy.\n\nAccepting the decorum of the constitutional monarch, there is no evidence that Hirohito was very active in war planning, leaving operational decisions to the cabinet and the military leaders. This stands in contrast to Nazi Germany, where Hitler- also the supreme commander of his armed forces- was very involved in operational decisions, e.g. whether to focus resources on taking Moscow (as many generals wanted) or taking Stalingrad (which Hitler wanted, because of the natural resources).\n\nIn the early parts of war with the US, Tojo and the general staff had the hubris to convert most of southeast Asia and even Australia and South America into Japanese colonies. But the Battle of Midway, in which the Japanese lost most of their vital aircraft carriers, was the turning point in the war. Successful American reconquests led to the creation of an “absolute defense line” in the south-west Pacific in the hope of halting further American advances. In the decisive Battle of Saipan in June 1944, the Americans captured the islands, which allowed them to build air bases that could dispatch B-29 bombers to directly bomb Japanese cities. Tojo lost the support of the emperor, and as prime minister was replaced by another weaker general Koiso Kuniako.\n\nAs the number of Japanese defeats mounted, especially after Iwo Jima in February 1945, some military leaders and Hirohito considered an end to the war. When the Americans captured Okinawa (June 1945), a Japanese island chain just to the south of the big Japanese islands, Hirohito realized that defeat was imminent and unavoidable. The problem was that outright surrender could provoke assassination attempts by the war-hungry Army officers, who wanted to fight to the bitter end. Smaller factions in the army leadership would accept surrender, but on the condition that no Allied troops would enter Japan and Japanese authorities get to decide how to deal with “culprits” who caused the war. These were terms that the US would never accept. Hirohito’s only concern was to preserve the imperial throne (not including himself, as he was ready to face prosecution by the Allied occupiers), but he accepted Allied occupation and the punishment of military leaders for the sake of the survival of the Japanese people.\n\nThe Potsdam conference that was held between July 17 and August 2 among the Allied powers and decided the post-Nazi era in Europe also came with an American demand for the unconditional surrender of Japan. The Japanese government under prime minister Suzuki Kantaro (serving since April of 1945, former navy admiral and peace-oriented) did not bother to respond to the Potsdam declaration. In the last days of war, the Japanese were still hoping to relay a negotiated surrender, perhaps with the assistance of the Soviet Union, which was not belligerent to Japan at that point (with the exception of some border skirmishes with the Kwantung Army in Manchuria). By that point, the Soviets had developed their own plans of seizing Manchuria by force as well as retaking the Sakhalin and Kuril islands north of the Japanese main islands.\n\nHirohito and his closest advisers, including the prime minister (Suzuki) and the Lord of the Privy Council (Kido), were considering to issue the seidan, which is the emperor’s declaration of surrender. As commander-in-chief, Hirohito had the technical right to declare surrender, and the military command had to submit to his desires, but in reality, Hirohito was very hesitant to make unilateral decisions, fearing the pushback of military leaders.\n\nOn August 6, the US dropped the atomic bomb over Hiroshima and three days later in Nagasaki. The US had prepared plans to stage amphibious assaults on the main Japanese islands, but the fierce resistance in Okinawa, which led to the death of over 14,000 American soldiers made them reconsider that option. A war of attrition would have taken much longer, so instead the US used the newly developed atom bomb, which was in part aided by German scientists who fled to the US during the war. While the destruction fell over Nagasaki, the Soviet Union, which had spent the summer reinforcing their troops along the Chinese border, invaded Manchuria and within 11 days they completed their objective of seizing the north of China and the northern portion of Korea.\n\nIt was only the twin shock of the atomic bomb and the Soviet invasion that shifted the consensus toward unconditional surrender. But even in the last days of the war, the Japanese leadership was hoping for a conditional surrender with the Japanese Emperor still at the helm. The US secretary of state responded with a note, saying that the emperor and the Japanese government would be under the command of the Allied powers (i.e. US), and that Japan should have a government that is established “by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people” (p.167). When Hirohito received the US reply, he accepted the terms of surrender, believing that this could save the imperial house, even as he was ready to stand trial himself (presumably his infant son would take over as next emperor, though that was not made explicit in Kawamura’s account).\n\nHirohito noted, “If the Japanese people no longer want the imperial house, even if the United States allows it to continue, there will be no use trying to save it. If the Japanese people still continue to trust the imperial house, I would like them to make that decision through their freely expressed will.” (p.172) Was Hirohito becoming a liberal? Kawamura gives a two-sided reply. Yes, in that Hirohito is described as a moderate, with democratic political views, a realistic sense of patriotism and awareness of what was necessary to preserve Japan as a nation (p.176). No, in that his belief in the raison d’etat, the protection of the state and the imperial house was more important than the lives of individual Japanese subjects. The state and the imperial house were one and the same, and Japan cannot survive without the monarchy (p.183). That truly does not sound very liberal!\n\nPart of the Army leadership was still very unhappy about these surrender terms, especially War Minister Anami and General Umezu (chief of Army Staff), and they had heard of other army leaders (including vice chief of the Army Stafff Lieutenant General Kawabe Torashiro, Lieutenant Colonel Takeshita Masahiko, Lieutenant Colonel Shiizaki Jiro, Major Hatanaka Kenji, and Colonel Arao Okikatsu) considering a coup d’etat to block the emperor from pronouncing unconditional surrender and killing the conciliatory cabinet members of the government. Major Hatanaka and Lieutenant Colonel Shiizaka made a last stand by carrying out a coup in the palace, but loyalist army units came to the palace in time to quell the coup. Anami and Umezu did not actively support the coup, indicating their loyalty to the emperor. Anami committed suicide on the day of Japanese surrender, and Umezu was sentenced to life in prison after the war.\n\nThe prime minister and the pro-surrender crowd in the government were not able to break the deadlock, so Hirohito himself had to act. The atomic bomb and the Soviet invasion had consolidated the view in Hirohito that he had to unilaterally call an end to the war and convened an assembly with the cabinet and the military leaders.\n\nThe emperor announced Japanese surrender on the 15th of August, although the Kwantung Army fought a few more days before surrendering their weapons. Hirohito was willing to abdicate, but the Japanese government and even the US occupiers refused that request. The Americans believed that it could be easier to introduce major changes to the Japanese constitution if Hirohito stayed on as emperor. The post-war constitution ratified in 1947 was truly revolutionary in that the landlords were expropriated and the land rights were transferred to the peasants. The military would be dismantled and only 9 years after the end of war (1954) would Japan found a slimmed down self-defense force. The new constitution transformed Japan into a parliamentary democracy with the monarch continuing as head of state with ceremonial duties. It renounced any future war. Japan also was integrated into the US security umbrella with US military bases stationed there.\n\nEven prior to the US occupation, the Meiji constitution, which had been in force since 1890, had limited the absolute power of the monarch by relegating the affairs of state to the cabinet, Privy Council and later the military. On the other hand, the Meiji constitution took Prussia as role model, which still gave sweeping powers to the emperor if he chose to use it, thus making the Meiji constitution somewhat ambiguous. The sovereign was the emperor, not the Japanese people, who were the subjects! A personality that had been more domineering than Hirohito would have more intensely taken advantage of his power over policy, but with regard to the war, it was not the emperor who was the driving force, but the military leaders who sidelined the civilian cabinet in a series of power struggles that reached back to the 1920s.\n\nTo some extent, the ambiguity of the Meiji constitution and the self-defined impotence of the supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces facilitated Japanese militaristic expansionism. Hirohito was rather reluctant to prosecute foreign wars, as he lacked the militarist training to inculcate him to the ways of war. Yet, his pacifist inclinations were subsumed in a polity that increasingly marginalized the voices of peace, often with violent means. The unrestrained military attempted to restore pride to Japan, which had been battered by faulty austerity policies, a severe economic crisis and a sense of being left out by western power arrangements. In the militarist view, economic supremacy and access to raw materials could only be established by foreign military conquest.\n\nDuring the height of Japanese military power in the early-1940s, the military generals created the image of the Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, in which the Asian nations under the leadership of Japan could carve out influence and power apart from the white man. It is not surprising that the subjected populations of China and southeast Asia were less than enthralled about the yoke of Japanese domination. As for Hirohito, as long as the Japanese military was able to score military successes he implicitly endorsed the foreign invasion campaigns, but as the tide of battle turned, he went onto damage control and tried to defy the war hawks. But he only spoke out in favor of surrender after the devastating atomic bomb and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Hirohito may, therefore, be considered a rather weak leader.\n\nThe ambiguity of the Meiji constitution with the weakness of the emperor also had the convenient feature of exonerating Hirohito from any war guilt, and allowed him to serve on as emperor, although the post-war constitution relegated him as a completely constitutional monarch without any powers. This stands in stark contrast to Mussolini, who was captured by communist partisans and shot the next day on the street. Only two days later, Hitler committed suicide as the advancing Soviet troops were entering Berlin. High level Japanese military officials like Tojo Hideki were condemned to death similar to Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi general.\n\nHirohito never spoke about the war or his role in it after the war ended. He died in 1989. The lack of public examination of Hirohito’s involvement in the war decision comforts the Japanese national psyche in that it carries no formal responsibility over its conduct in the war. While German textbooks deeply engage with the Nazi crimes, no such depictions are included in Japanese textbooks. It is unlikely that in the future Japan could restore its military power and pose a threat to the world, so the primary concern is about whether the rise of a nationalist spirit that glorifies one’s own nation while condemning other nationalities can be prevented.\n\nBackground readings\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirohito\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Tojo\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Japan\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_government_and_military_commanders_of_World_War_II\n\nBBC documentary clip on Japanese surrender https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKD-0mJ94B4"
