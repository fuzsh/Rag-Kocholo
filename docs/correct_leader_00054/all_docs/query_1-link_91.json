        "text": "Temin [1989] and Eichengreen [1992] argue that monetary policy played a key role in each country&#x27;s economic performance during the Great Depression, and that some European policymakers hesitated to pursue an expansionary monetary policy even after departing from gold. Why did these policymakers not pursue the opportunities they were able to pursue to the fullest extent? This study explores this issue by looking at the case of Japan, focusing on the constraints it faced and the remedies available to it as a small, open economy. This study explores the relationship between interest rates in Japan and in the major international financial centers, using a new series of representative long-term interest rates and narratives. This study reveals that Japan imposed a restrictive monetary policy on itself even after departing from the gold standard. Japan did so because it needed to maintain its ties both with its trading partners and with the international financial markets.\n\nThe world has gotten used to Japan’s great slowdown and it becomes easy to forget its many surprising features. Record-breaking magnitudes and baffling anomalies have appeared at every turn. Much of it now looks like a pre-play of the global financial bubble that peaked in 2007–08. At the height of the 1989 financial bubble, then the greatest bubble of its type, Japanese banks looked set to dominate international finance. As it turned out, their position was built on a mountain of bad debt that may ultimately have reached ¥200 trillion (more than US$2 trillion). Japan after the bubble underwent the first extended price deflation, anywhere, since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Japanese financial authorities experimented with the greatest peacetime fiscal stimulus and with the lowest interest rates in history. They effectively socialized a great amount of private debt, ramping up the public debt to extraordinary levels. For all of this, the country continued to run large trade surpluses, retained its new status as the world’s number-one international creditor, and continued to export capital, even as US rating agencies downgraded Japan’s national debt to the level of a developing country (and even as the US government itself continued to borrow—from Japan). Far from fearing a currency crash, the Japanese government strove to support the US dollar and hold down the value of the yen. The period ended with gigantic bank mergers among the half-nationalized banks and an extraordinary monetary expansion via the banks, known as “quantitative easing.” There is no agreement on the nature or meaning of most of this, and the clash of interpretative views begins to take on shades of the unending debate over the causes of the Great Depression of the 1930s. The recovery of the early 2000s also begins to permit a perspective of the period as a period of history, if still a very near history whose ends remain unknown.\n\nSince World War II, Japan has transformed into one of the countries with a fairly stable economy. Almost after 1945 Japan is rare experienced an economic crisis, especially in the 1960s Japan experienced rapid economic development. But with status as one a country with a strong economy, does not guarantee Japan is spared to the economic crisis. In exactly 1990 the Japanese economy experienced stagnation and crisis that lasted for a decade. It is then known with the term decades gone. The crisis is causing an inflation asset prices in Japan before 1990. Coupled with the emergence of that condition known as zombie firms ie the conditions under which the company has a level high debt and unable to pay it off even though it has been declared bangkrut.Krisis that hit Japan is quite long because in addition to magnitude asset price bubbles are also accompanied by the size of bank loans which is beyond expectations. In addition, the role of the less effective government also becomes a separate factor for the survival of the crisis. Thus can the author present the research that the length of the crisis is so great asset price bubbles that can not be controlled by the government. Japan's economic condition after World War II\n\nAs the world economic crisis continues, people are turning to the Japanese example. Japan has experienced the burst of the Bubble economy, financial crisis, and more than a decade-long deflation and stagnation known as the Lost Decade. Some commentators are even suggesting the Japanization of the Western countries. The paper focuses mainly on the economic controversies and debates during the Great Stagnation from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s along with a brief description of the Japanese economy characterized by a series of macroeconomic policy mistakes. It is true that there are some distinct differences between Japan and the other countries including their academic economics culture and initial policy responses to the financial crisis. However, there are certain similarities: the discussions became more and more divisive and heated as the crisis continued; economists turned to more “structural causes” of the stagnation, as the crisis prolonged; the effectiveness of macroeconom..."
