        "text": "By saying retrospective elections, the retrospective Japanese general election of 1930 would be following the OTL 1928 results instead of the AH.commer 1928 results, or it would become thoroughly role play. Of course, I may try to connect all retrospective general election results into one single WikiTable\n\nOkay, now comes 1930. In OTL, the Constitutional Democrats are in power since 1929, after the collapse of the Seiyukai-led government of Giichi Tanaka following the Zhang Zuolin Incident. Despite the outbreak of the Great Depression, Osachi Hamaguchi was very popular at the time of the election, held on February 1930. The previous Seiyukai regime was to be blamed for virtually all bad things.\n\nThe Hamaguchi regime decides to lift the ban on gold export just before the election. Also, in light of the economic crisis, the ruling Constitutional Democrats vow to cut military but also education spending. It continues to support anti-military policies that would lead to better international cooperation, including to limit naval shipbuilding.\n\nThe opposition center-right Seiyukai, now led by Tsuyoshi Inukai, opposed the lift of gold export ban, arguing that it would only harm the economy further. However, Inukai supports cutting military expenses in light of the Great Depression, and argues that the military should be under civilian control.\n\nA firm believer in the constitution, Inukai believes that while the Ministries of Army and Navy should be independent from the parliament, the parliament is acting on behalf of the emperor, and should be allowed to cut military expenses and limit Japan's military development. While opposing negotiations with the West to limit naval shipbuilding, Inukai also opposed militarist aggression in China.\n\nThe National Comrade Association is the successor of the Business Comrade Association, and is still led by businessman Sanji Muto (武藤山治). It was in favor of tax cuts, privatization and economic liberalism. Vigorously opposing the lifting of gold export ban, the NCA calls for the resignation of Junnosuke Inoue, Finance Minister and former CEO of the Central Bank.\n\nThe Reform Party still exists, and campaigns on a single issue of further political reforms and tackling corruption.\n\nThe Social People's Party (社会民衆党) is still around, it is still anti-capitalism but anti-communism. It is led by Abe Isoo, a prominent Christian socialist. It continues to fight for more welfare protection and collective bargaining rights. It has however adopted a Syndicalist platform as well.\n\nThe Japan Masses Party (日本大衆党) is the merger of the parliamentary anti-Moscow Communist \"Japan Labor-Farmer Party\", along with the Japan Farmers' Party and another small party. Another anti-Soviet communist party, it was led by Professor Iwasaburo Takano, an intellectual with republican tendencies. The party campaigns on the simple platform to fight for the nationalization of all land and women suffrage, labeling zaibatsus as exploiters.\n\nThe Labor-Farmer Party that had connections with Communist International and Moscow has been banned, but Ikuo Oyama (大山郁夫) decides that he is to form the New Labor-Farmer Party (新労農党) despite opposition from Moscow, which now favors a workers' revolution instead of electoral politics due to the economic downturn. Instead of embracing communist policies, Oyama simply campaigns on the slogan the all existing parties are useless, and is marginalized by other socialist parties while being labeled as a traitor of communism by Moscow. The pro-Soviet Communist did not support Oyama at all, and therefore did not participate in the election."
