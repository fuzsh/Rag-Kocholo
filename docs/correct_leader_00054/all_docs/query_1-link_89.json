        "text": "1. No.8 1930s and War Economy Economic Development of Japan\n\n2. Pure dictatorship Full democracy Democratic institution (Form) Political competition Constitution Laws Parliament Election Court Reform vs conservatism, big vs small government, other policy debates Edo Meiji Taisho Fascism Constitution Parliament Democracy movement, Party cabinet Democratization New constitution Showa2 War 1937 1945-51 LDP dominance Lack of policy debate Male suffrage 1960 Now US rule Defeat Showa1 1889 1925 1931 Military rises 1937-45 (Content)Political fights\n\n3. Two-party Politics 1924-1932 PP.130-32 Minsei Party 民政党 (Kenseikai until 1927) Seiyukai 政友会 (Estab. in 1900 by Hirobumi Ito) Economy Small government, free market, fiscal austerity & industrial restructuring for return to gold Big government, fiscal activism, local public works for securing votes Foreign policy Oppose militarism, protect Japan’s interest by diplomacy, promote disarmament To attack Minsei Party, support military and fascism if necessary, even deny democracy Remark Peace orientation is laudable, but stubborn deflation policy caused fascism to gain force Economic recovery policy was welcomed, but its opportunism severely undermined democracy Seiyukai statements: “Prof. Minobe’s theory denies the supreme dignity of Emperor. Just banning his books is not enough.” “Go, go, Japan, the leader of Asia, the vast land of Manchuria and Mongolia is waiting for you!!!” (election campaign song)”\n\n5. Shidehara Diplomacy His policy was more moderate than before or after him • Maintain good relations with US and UK • Respect Washington Naval Disarmament Treaty (1921-22) • No military intervention in China; secure Japan’s economic interest through diplomacy and negotiation • When China protests and resists, his diplomacy breaks down • Domestically, criticized as Coward Diplomacy • Fail to stop Manchurian Incident (1931) started by Kantogun (Japanese Army stationed in China) PP.106-9 Kijuro Shidehara, 1872-1951 Foreign Minister, 1924-27, 1929-31 Prime Minister 1945-46\n\n6. Tanaka Cabinet (Seiyukai), 1927-1929 • The Oriental Conference (Japan’s policy toward China): defend Japan’s interests in Manchuria- Mongolia 満蒙, but welcome FDI from any country. • Send Japanese troops to prevent Chiang Kai-shek 蒋介 石’s army to unify China (1927 & 1928). • Suppress communists and proletariat parties. • Strengthen Security Maintenance Law 治安維持法 (introduce death penalty). • Kantogun 関東軍 (Japanese army in China) kills Chinese military leader 張作霖 by train bombing. PM Tanaka did not report the truth to Emperor. Emperor criticizes him and he resigns. Giichi Tanaka 1864-1929\n\n7. Hamaguchi Cabinet (Minsei Party), 1929-31 • Fiscal austerity and industrial restructuring for returning to gold standard ($1=2 yen) • Disarmament (supported by people, opposed by navy) • Social policies for workers and farmers Prime Minister Osachi Hamaguchi Finance Minister Junnosuke Inoue Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara Hamaguchi Cabinet is regarded as the crown of pre-WW2 democracy achievement. However, its stubborn deflation policy encouraged fascism and militarism, despite Minsei Party’s peace orientation.\n\n8. Promoting Naval Disarmament • London Naval Disarmament Treaty (1930) signed and ratified against opposition by Navy and Privy Council (cruisers & submarines, 69.75% vs 70% of US/UK tonnage) • Navy attacks government for “violation of Emperor’s supreme command authority” 統帥権干犯 • Seiyukai supports Navy to undermine Minsei Party Government (=helping fascism) • PM Hamaguchi shot at Tokyo Station (1930), dies next year Note: Before WW2, many PMs were assassinated or almost killed: Ito, Okuma, Hara, Inukai, Hamaguchi, Takahashi, Saito, Suzuki\n\n9. Showa Economic Crisis 昭和恐慌 Causes (1) Impact of global depression (2) Austerity policy initiated and continued by FM Inoue Consequences (1) Severe price deflation (2) Rural impoverishment, coupled with famine (3) Cartelization and rationalization (“free market doesn’t work”) (4) Rise of fascism (army, navy, right-wing groups) --Rejection of party politics --“Reform” movement 1/ Military readiness for total war 2/ Totalitarian state for the benefit of farmers and workers PP.126-130 0 5 10 15 20 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 Nominal GNP (bil yen)\n\n10. Takahashi Budget and Recovery 1932-36 • Korekiyo Takahashi, FM in Inukai Seiyukai Cabinet and two other cabinets (1932-36)--“Japanese Keynes” • “If someone saves 30,000 yen out of his income of 50,000 yen, his savings will increase, which is fine for him. But from the viewpoint of national economy, his saving will surely reduce demand elsewhere, which lowers national output. For the nation, it is actually better that this person spend all his income of 50,000 yen.” (Takahashi speech on austerity and returning to gold standard, 1929) • Reversing Inoue’s austerity policy --Terminate gold standard, let yen fall --BOJ monetization of fiscal deficit --“Spending Policy” on public works PP.131-32 Takahashi was assassinated by rebellion army in 1936\n\n11. Manchurian Incident (1931) (Sep. 18 Incident) • Kantogun (関東軍 Japanese army stationed in China) initiates well-planned invasion of Manchuria without informing Tokyo • Tokyo Government and Army HQ try to stop it but fails  Kantogun is now uncontrollable  Violating “open door, equal opportunity” principle • US Secretary of State Stimson’s press statement undermines FM Shidehara (regarding Jinzhou bombing) • Seiyukai (Inukai) Government declares the “independence” of Manchuria (1932). • The League of Nations determines that Manchuria is not an independent state and Japan’s action is not self-defense  Japan withdraws from the League of Nations (1933) PP.133-35\n\n12. Democracy Fascism/militarism Pro- Zaibatsu, Pro-Capit- alism Workers’ & Farmers’ Rights Multiplicity of Political Players and Policy Debates (1930s until the outbreak of Japan-China War (July 1937) Seiyukai Party Minsei Party “Proletariat” parties Military Ugaki\n\n13. Proletariat parties Minsei Party Seiyukai Party Discipline Faction Imperial Faction Navy R Wing Political parties in parliament Army factions Social reform through parliament Social reform thru coup & terrorism Political terrorism 1931‐36 Failed coup Feb. 26 Incident, 1936 X Dominant & suppressive Rivalry among fascio groups Supports fascism to undermine Minsei Party Lose election Feb. 1936 Opposes fascism, promotes social policies Gain seats under broad voter base, demands social policies FASCIODEMOCRACY Attempt to cooperate to fight fascism fails Anti-military criticism in parliament X Japan-China War, 1937 Dissatisfied with two major parties, sympathetic to “social reform” by fascio groups 無産政党 民政党 政友会 陸軍統制派 陸軍皇道派\n\n14. Why People & Media Supported Military? (Not all of them, but some) • The Sense of “Crisis in Manchuria-Mongolia” 満蒙の危機—need to protect Japan’s interests against the emergence of anti-Japanese movement in China; Shidehara Diplomacy is regarded as too soft • Showa Economic Crisis—workers and farmers suffer severely while big businesses make money • Disgust with political parties—both Seiyukai and Minsei Party are regarded as corrupt and unfriendly to workers’ welfare • However, some journalists criticized militarism consistently--Tanzan Ishibashi 石橋湛山, Kiyoshi Kiyosawa 清沢冽\n\n15. War Economy 1937-45 • Political debate and democracy completely suppressed. • Economic planning to mobilize people and resources under private ownership (no nationalization). 1937-39 Planning Board, National Mobilization Law; State Power Management Law 1939-41 Control over civil life becomes pervasive 1941-44 Total war with US--Ministry of Military Demand; Military Needs Company Act 1944-45 Economic collapse due to lack of inputs War with China prolongs  Resource shortage within Yen Bloc  Invade SEA for more resources  Total war with US and rest of the world PP.136-39\n\n17. 0 5 10 15 20 25 1942:H1 1942:H2 1943:H1 1943:H2 1944:H1 1944:H2 1945:H1 Other Oil from SEA Nonferrous metals Iron ore Coal Million tons (1937=100) 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 Weapons & ammunition Planes (army) Planes (navy) Battleships 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 1933 1935 1937 1939 1941 1943 1945 1947 1949 1951 1953 Total Food Clothing (1933=100) Military Production Consumer Product Supply Maritime Transport during Pacific War 1941-1945"
