While details of the suspect's motives are gradually emerging, we unreservedly condemn this shocking attempt to silence a public figure through violence.\n\nAbe was shot while making a campaign speech on the morning of July 8 in the western city of Nara. He was rushed by helicopter to a hospital for emergency treatment, but was pronounced dead later that evening."
