        "text": "(1870–1931). Japanese statesman Hamaguchi Osachi served as prime minister of Japan in 1929–30. His unpopular policies, combined with the outset of the Great Depression, led to the fall of his cabinet.\n\nHamaguchi Osachi (also called Hamaguchi Yuko) was born on May 1, 1870, in Kochi, Tosa province, Japan. He was adopted into the Hamaguchi family at an early age. After he graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University in 1895, he held a finance position in the government. Hamaguchi was elected to the Diet (Japan’s national legislature) in 1914. Ten years later he became finance minister in the government of Kato Takaaki and then minister of home affairs. Soon Hamaguchi was elected president of the liberal Minseito (“Democratic Party”), and in July 1929 he was made prime minister.\n\nAlthough Hamaguchi won reelection the following year, his policies were unpopular. In order to combat rising inflation, he returned Japan to the gold standard and promoted the mechanization of industry. The effects of the worldwide depression, however, deflated the Japanese economy even further, and Hamaguchi’s measures led to great social unrest. In 1930 Hamaguchi agreed to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, which limited armaments of the countries that signed the accord. His actions were greatly resented, and he was shot in the Tokyo Railway Station by a right-wing youth in November of that year. He died of his wounds nine months later, on August 26, 1931, in Tokyo, Japan."
