        "text": "Lots of variables there. My wild guess is similar to the present on a per capita basis. Gross wealth could be much larger. I am assuming here there is a liberalization & the 'empire' evolves into some sort of common wealth. If Japan tries to preserve a actual empire through the 20th Century then it may end up like Portugal [emphasis added].\n\nI think Japan has much better odds of maintaining its empire than Portugal ever did. For one, the substantial majority of the population and economic production would be in the Japanese home islands. I thik it is a relatively safe bet that Taiwan stays content under Japanese rule, as IOTL they treated it as a \"model colony\" and their policy was geared towards assimilation and eventual integration of the island into the Japanese mainstream as a sort of additional home island. They encouraged people to adopt Japanese customs, language, and names but did so in a much gentler way than they did in Korea. They also governed pretty competently and I think granted Taiwan some representation in the Diet. I'd expect it to have a relationship with Japan much like that of the Ryukus- distinct from Japan but also with a sense of being a part of it. So in this scenario I wouldn't think Japan would need to fight to keep Taiwan in the empire. Micronesia is hardly an issue. I mean, the population is so small and the resources are meager that if Japan wants to keep them there's nothing the inhabitants can do about it. Really the only place where Japan is going to have to fight is Korea, and that will be one ugly, ugly war. I think it'll come down to how successful the policies to integrate Korea/suppress Korean identity are. If they work, it'll be Japan hunting down insurgents in the Korean mountains. If they don't work, it will be a full on France in Algeria. But I get the feeling that Japan would be pretty damn brutal to hang on to Korea.\n\nI think Japan has much better odds of maintaining its empire than Portugal ever did.

If they don't work, it will be a full on France in Algeria. But I get the feeling that Japan would be pretty damn brutal to hang on to Korea.\n\nAlso lets not forget Karafuto (South Sakhalin). It was already part of the home islands OTL, would have a higher populaation of OTL - a lot of them Ainus, and it has oil.\n\nDid the Japanese ever have much issues in holding Korea historically?\n\nAfter the 1910 annexation? Not very, from what I gather. There was some level of Korean resistance, but the few attempts to revolt were easily dealt with. Avoiding the militaristic overtones that took over Japan in the 20s and 30s would actually improve Korean-Japanese relations.\n\nAfter the 1919 demonstrations, Japan relented some on military government policy and brought back a limited version of free press among other things--if Japan keeps a light touch in Korea through the 20s and 30s, you can avoid a lot of the violence that hit Korea IOTL. That's not to say Japan can keep it forever, but it may give a chance to form a sort of... amicable divorce; or escalate into a Time of Troubles where Northern Korea is like Ireland and Southern Korea is like Ulster.\n\nBut no, the Korean nationalists were too disorganized and lacked a strong sponsor to really give the Japanese a hard time.\n\nAfter the 1910 annexation?

The Soviets probably won't due to their oil deal with the Japanese however, but who knows how relations could change.\n\nMaybe Korea could be the Scotland to Japan's England (and Taiwan ends up Wales?). Otherwise the Irish analogy seems more realistic. If Japan is staying Taisho and relatively liberal here, there may be less of a push for Korean Nationalism here.\n\nThere'd likely be a larger Korean diaspora TTL. Imagining Korean-Americans on the West Coast being as nationalistic as Irish-Americans in the northeast and midwest is an interesting concept.\n\nAdding to that I'd say Japans most dangerous enemy in this scenario is itself. Assuming that Japan goes through a transition akin to OTLs South Korea and Taiwan I fully agree that they could proabably keep everything, just with more difficulty in Korea than elsewhere.\n\nIf on the other hand it merely avoids OTLs lunacy, but still devolves more and more into authoritarianism, with all the corruption, cronyism, etc that leads to long-term poverty for everyone including most Japanese that's another matter.\n\nIn that scenario it'll not just be easy for the USSR and/or PRC to raise the banner of Communist liberation in Korea. Eventually you might see a Japanese internal Civil War during which Korea and Taiwan both break away without hardly an effort. Taiwan might do so not because of any deep commitment to independence, but merely to sit avoid the Civil War spilling over to it.\n\nIt would be the other way around. During their occupation, the Japanese built up the industries in the North more than the South. So the Japanese would probably want to keep the northern portion.\n\nBut the Koreans might want it more, especially if it's still majority Korean. Instead...\n\nThis Southern Korea would need to have a Japanese majority or Korean \"loyalist\" population, if a partition of Korea was going to be similar to Ireland. Maybe Busan and the very southern part of Korea could attract a this type of population due to its proximity to Japan.\n\n...I feel that this scenario is more likely, but I don't have any data to back this up. Common sense would suggest that the areas closest to Japan would see the largest proportions of Japanese settlement. Does anyone have a reliable map of ethnic Japanese in Korea during Japanese rule IOTL?\n\n1 - any Soviet data is to be treated with extreme caution, i.e. it is false unless proven true. Japan probably passed the USSR years earlier.\n\n2 - the POD is pre-1931, pre grabbing of Manchuria.\n\n3 - Japan sitting out WWII will make it as rich - if not richer - as Italy. Without any special effort on its side. And from that point onward the only way is up!\n\nI trust nothing about the Soviets but I use Maddison data just to be on the same page. I have Manchuria carved out as I think it is doable without going full war and knocks China back a peg or two. Even taking out the Chinese there, not a massive populace as I recall, so we are still looking at Japan, Korea and Taiwan, modern ROK and Taiwan both have bigger per capita GDP, I took everyone to Japan's, and this smaller Imperial Japan is even more defensible, less prone to break-up and here the Japanese should out number the Korean and Taiwanese ethnic minorities. I think you get a country that is about one-third to one-half the strength of TTL USA and is on par with an ATL Imperial Germany or TTL USSR."
