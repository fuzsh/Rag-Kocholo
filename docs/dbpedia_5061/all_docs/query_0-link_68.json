        "text": "Anyone that resides in Mumbai or has ever made use of the local trains in the city will agree that it is about time for a makeover for some (read: most) of the railway stations. The well-connected train network is supremely convenient, time-wise, and pocket-wise, but it would definitely be reasonable to zhuzh them up.\n\nThere is certainly no better way to do this than by integrating the local culture of the city, more specifically the communities inhabiting the area. The Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) will renovate 19 of the suburban railway stations in Mumbai and Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) with the help of local artists and architects of the stationâ€™s respective areas. Making sure to include the local culture, art and cuisine, the stations will see a new face come 2023.\n\nThe Hindustan Times tells us that the renovations will be theme-based keeping in mind the local theme of the area and important locations that are significant to the location [of the railway station as mentioned by Ravi Agarwal, Chairman and Managing Director of MRVC. It also informs us that the 19 stations to be renovated are Mumbai Central, Bhandup, Mulund, Thane, Kandivali, Mira Road, Jogeshwari, Dombivli, Govandi, Ghatkopar, Mankhurd, GTB Nagar, Bhayandar, Vasai Road, Nallasopara, Virar, Shahad, Neral, and Kasara railway stations.\n\nBy next year, we may see the railway stations in all their brand new glory, bask the city in the impressions of their surrounding heritage."
