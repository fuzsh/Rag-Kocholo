        "text": "The heavy downpour that Mumbai has been experiencing since Sunday evening has resulted in waterlogging at many places, including railway stations on the Central suburban railway line. As of Monday morning, heavy rains continued to lash Mumbai, causing the railway tracks between Bhandup and Nahur stations to become submerged at many locations. This disrupted the morning local train services between Thane and Mumbai. Many office-goers have been reported stranded at main stations like Thane and Dombivli.\n\nIn a social media post on the microblogging website ‘X’ (previously Twitter), Central Railway posted an update saying, “Train services on the main line are running; however, due to heavy rains and waterlogging between Bhandup and Nahur, trains are being run by clamping and padlocking the points. Clamping was completed at 06:45. Harbour line services are running normally.”\n\nCentral Railway also suspended long-route express trains between Mumbai and Pune due to waterlogging. “Due to waterlogging at various stations in Mumbai Division on 08.07.24: 1) 12110 (MMR-CSMT) JCO 08.07.2024, 2) 11010 (PUNE-CSMT) JCO 08.07.2024, 3) 12124 (PUNE CSMT DECCAN) JCO 08.07.2024, 4) 11007 (PUNE-CSMT DECCAN) JCO 08.07.2024, 5) 12127 (CSMT-PUNE INTERCITY EXP) JCO 08.07.2024,” read another post by Central Railway. Trains between Kasara and Thane and Badlapur and Thane were running normally. Due to the unavailability of local trains further between Thane and Mumbai, many office-goers were seen stranded at Thane station on the first day of the week. According to Central Railway, various teams have been deployed to clear the clogged water between Bhandup and Nahur.\n\nVarious parts of Mumbai and Thane also experienced waterlogging after the first heavy downpour of the season. Areas like ‘Tembhi Naka’ in Thane experienced waterlogging due to continuous rains since Sunday evening. In Mumbai, the main highway at Sion, Matunga, Kurla, and King Circle saw disrupted road traffic leading towards Dadar and South Mumbai. This year, BMC was confident that waterlogging would not happen as the cleaning work of drains had been satisfactory, but the first heavy rain has exposed all the tall claims of the BMC. According to the BMC, at many places in Mumbai, 300mm of rain was recorded between 1 am to 7 am on Monday, which caused many low-lying areas of Mumbai city to experience waterlogging.\n\nThe BMC requested the people of Mumbai not to venture out unless necessary. “The weather department has predicted extremely heavy rainfall in Mumbai today. In light of the continuous rainfall, the entire machinery of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is actively working on the ground. Citizens are requested not to believe in any rumours and to step out of their homes only if absolutely necessary. In case of an emergency, please contact the number 1916 for immediate assistance,” the BMC posted."
