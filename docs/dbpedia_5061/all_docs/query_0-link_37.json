        "text": "One regular commuter Mrs. Babita B. Gosavi from Dombivli travelling in AC local working as Superintendent in City Civil and Sessions Court, Mumbai said “I am travelling in AC local from Dombivli to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in the morning and from CSMT to Dombivli in the evening during peak time. This journey is very pleasant & stress free.\n\nThough I have been travelling for the last 33 years between Dombivli and CSMT in local trains, ever since I shifted to air-conditioned local, the travel stress has completely reduced. Because, it is well known how difficult it is to get off and o­n from Dombivli Station. In such a situation, the air-conditioned local introduced by Central Railway is a gift for our daily commute.”"
