        "text": "Of all 85 stations on CR, Dombivali retains pride of place with maximum number of passengers travelling to and from the station, generating the highest amount of revenue every day.\n\nA RTI query filed by activist Anil Galgali has revealed that Dombivali is the most crowded and highest fare generating suburban station on CR. A total 2,33,635 passengers travel through this station on a daily basis and Rs 14,94,538 is collected in fares every day. Thane stands at second spot with 2,25,490 passengers using the station every day, generating Rs 13,84,020 in fares per day.\n\nThane remains number one in terms of ticket selling on a daily basis (60,895) followed by Kurla (55,552) and Ghatkopar (42,977). A total of 8,97,019 tickets are sold at all 85 stations and 38.56 lakh passengers travel daily, generating '2.19 crore in fares. By contrast, Kalamboli, a station on the Diva-Panvel route witnesses the lowest number of passengers with only 55 tickets sold daily and only Rs 887 generated daily in fares. Mr Galgali said, -\"Railway authorities have completely failed to live up to the aspirations of local train commuters and that is why every day, over 10 passengers die owing to different kinds of incidents.‚Äù"
