These unfortunate incidents took place between Dombivli to Kopar and Diva to Mumbra railway stations. The headache of the railway administration has increased as the number of local accidents has not decreased despite increasing the number of local trains.\n\nOver 400 passengers have died between Dombivli and Diva railway stations in the last year. More than 800 locals have been injured in falls. The railway administration is taking various measures to prevent train accidents. However, this series of accidents does not end.\n\nAlso Read: BMC Plans To Cut Down 316 Trees For SoBo's New Eastern Freeway Service Road\n\nThese cases have been registered at Lohmarg Police Station. Riya Shyamji Rajgor (26) died between Dombivli and Kopar railway stations on Monday morning. At Dombivli railway station, Riya caught the Mumbai-bound local on Monday morning. Due to overcrowding in the coach, she could not enter the coach. She was travelling standing in the door of the local. As the local sped up after Dombivli station, she lost her balance near Kopar railway station and fell on the track and died on the spot."
