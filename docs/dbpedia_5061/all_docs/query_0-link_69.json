        "text": "From a daily average of 5,939 passengers in February-2022 to that of 34,808 passengers in July-2022, traffic has increased almost 6 times, said Central Railway's chief public relations officer\n\nDombivli station on Central Railway has topped the number of AC local train passengers with the highest numbers of tickets sold there between February and July 2022. Dombivli has been followed by Thane and Kalyan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking with mid-day, Central Railway's chief public relations officer said, “Central Railway’s suburban commuters have given an overwhelming response to AC suburban locals. The number of passengers travelling by AC locals has increased considerably in the past six months. From a daily average of 5,939 passengers in February-2022 to that of 34,808 passengers in July-2022, traffic has increased almost 6 times.”\n\n“The tremendous response to AC locals has been due to the fact that travelling by AC suburban locals is not only fast but also most economical in comparison to other means of air-conditioned transport systems in the city and suburbs. The response has also risen after the slashing of single journey ticket rates by 50% with effect from 5.5.2022,” he elaborated.\n\n“Central Railway has been at the forefront in its efforts to provide a comfortable travel to its passengers and running of AC locals is one of them. The overwhelming response to AC locals has given a boost to CR’s efforts in its motto of giving the best service to its passengers,” he added.\n\nThe top five stations of Central Railway in terms of ticket sales (both single and season ticket) for the period from February 2022 to July 2022 are\n\nDombivli – 94,932 tickets\n\nThane - 84,309 tickets\n\nKalyan - 77,412 tickets\n\nCSMT - 70,444 tickets\n\nGhatkopar – 53,512 tickets"
