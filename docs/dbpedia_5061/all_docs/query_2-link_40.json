        "text": "Dombivli: In an effort to enhance railway safety awareness among commuters, Dombivli Railway Police has taken a creative approach by painting a picture of Yamaraja on a wall near the railway station. Dombivli, being one of the busiest railway stations on the Central Railway network, witnesses heavy footfall daily, with many commuters often risking their lives by crossing tracks instead of using designated railway bridges.\n\nThe Railway Security Force regularly encounters passengers attempting risky crossings, often leading to tragic consequences. In response, the Dombivli Railway Police has strategically painted a depiction of Yamaraja, the Hindu deity of death, urging commuters to reconsider unsafe practices."
