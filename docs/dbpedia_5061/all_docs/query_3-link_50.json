More express highways and more bridges have been built since then. Notable additions to the road network are the Banda-Worli Sea Link (opened 2009), which bridges Mahim Bay on the west side of the city, and a new expressway between eastern Mumbai and Navi Mumbai (opened 2014) that supersedes the earlier Thana Creek bridge.\n\nAir traffic is handled by Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in the northern part of the city. It consists of two terminals—domestic and international—which are about 3 miles (5 km) apart on either side of the runway system. A new international terminal opened in 2014, replacing an older facility. Mumbai is one of two principal air hubs in India—the other being Delhi—and handles most of the country’s international flights and a large proportion of its domestic service.\n\nThe facilities provided by the city’s harbor make Mumbai India’s principal western port. Although other major ports have sprung up on the west coast—Kandla, in the state of Gujarat, to the north; Marmagao, in the state of Goa, to the south; and Kochi (Cochin), in the state of Kerala, farther south—Mumbai still handles a significant portion of India’s maritime trade. The original port on the east side of Bombay Island was supplemented in 1989 by the opening of a large facility in Navi Bombay that handles containers and bulk liquid cargoes.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFormer Names of Current Places Quiz\n\nSuburban electric train systems provide the main public transportation, conveying hundreds of thousands of commuters within the metropolitan region daily. There are also thousands of taxis and auto-rickshaws fueled by liquid petroleum gas, which are identifiable by their iconic black-and-yellow painted bodies. In addition, a municipally owned bus fleet operates throughout the inner city and in parts of Navi Mumbai and Thane. Those services have been supplemented by a rapid-transit train system, the first line of which opened in 2014. The first portion of a monorail line in the city also began operating in 2014.\n\nGovernment\n\nAs the capital of Maharashtra state, the city is an integral political division of the state government, the headquarters of which are called the Mantralaya. The state administers Mumbai’s police force and has administrative control over certain city departments. The central Indian government controls communication and transportation infrastructure, including the postal service, the railways, the port, and the airport. Mumbai is the headquarters of India’s western naval fleet and the base for the Indian flagship, INS Mumbai.\n\nThe government of the city is vested in the fully autonomous Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). Its legislative body is elected on adult franchise every four years and functions through its various standing committees. The chief executive, who is appointed every three years by the state government, is the municipal commissioner. The mayor is annually elected by the MCGM; the mayor presides over corporation meetings and enjoys the highest honor in the city but has no real administrative authority."
