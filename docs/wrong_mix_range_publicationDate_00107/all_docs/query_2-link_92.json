        "text": "June 17, 2011\n\nThis is the second book I’ve read by the Norwegian writer Johan Harstad. My review of Hässelby, his other book, is also on my blog. Both books deal with a young man trying to find a way to live their life as they want it.\n\nBuzz Aldrin is out in the English translation this month, but I read the Dutch translation earlier this year.\n\nBuzz Aldrin: What it is about\n\nIn this book, Mattias, in his early thirties, loses his job at the garden center ánd his girlfriend almost at the same time. When his friend Jørn has to go to the Faroe islands with his band, he asks Mattias to come along as sound man.\n\nHe does, but after getting onto the ferry, the next thing he knows is that he’s laying in the middle of a desolate road in the rain with a lot of money in his pocket. He’s taken in by a man called Havstein.\n\nMattias great example is Buzz Aldrin, the second man to set foot on the moon. Mattias was born the night of that great event in 1969. Aldrin never got to be as well known as Neil Armstrong, who was the first person ever to walk on the moon.\n\nMattias has been trying all his life to be one of a crowd, not to stand out, to be second, never first. In the Faroe Islands, he hopes to be an unimportant person in an unimportant place. However, in the book he realizes that for some people, who care for him, he will be first, no matter what.\n\nThis book is reasonably realistic, unlike Hässelby, in which events take place that are decidedly surrealistic. However, the plans that are made (and carried out) at the end of the book are rather odd (but possible). They are more likely to happen in a children’s book than in a contemporary fiction novel for adults. An intelligent adult would immediately doubt the feasibility of the plans.\n\nBuzz Aldrin: What I thought\n\nThe book is the story of Mattias, first person, from just before he loses his job until the events at the end. There are few flashbacks, most is “live”, happening while we read. There are some parts that resemble stream of consciousness, sentences that go on for a whole paragraph. Most of the time, the book is easy to read.\n\nAny book that takes place in a Nordic country has a bit of an advantage in my opinion as a reader. I’m biased. I love stories taking place in Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and, when I think about it, the Faroe islands and Svalbard too.\n\nIn case you’re not sure, the Faroe islands are situated between Iceland and the Shetland Islands, which in their turn are a group of islands above the Orkney Islands, which are situated just North of Scotland.\n\nMattias is having a difficult time while on the Faroe islands and this is described well. The story is slow-going but we learn a lot about Mattias and the people around him in the mean time.\n\nMattias himself wasn’t the most interesting person in the book (how could he be, if he wants to blend into the background) but sometimes he surprised me. There were a few other characters that livened the book up, too.\n\nIn all, I enjoyed reading the book and I liked the fact it was set in an unusual place.\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nI got this book: from the library\n\nI read this in: Dutch, the original language is Norwegian (Buzz Aldrin, hvor ble det av deg i alt mylderet?)\n\nNumber of pages: 480\n\nFirst published: 2005, English edition June 2011"
