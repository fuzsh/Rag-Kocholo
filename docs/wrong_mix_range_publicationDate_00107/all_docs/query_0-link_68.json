        "text": "In an interview, Aldrin can discuss:\n\n•The blossoming of space tourism, and why public space travel by private citizens is critical as it makes space more familiar.\n\n•Why a second race to the moon is a dead end and a waste of precious resources.\n\nWhy there is high value on the political and collaborative front by letting partners such as China and India tie into the International Space Station.\n\n•Apollo was a get-there-in-a-hurry, straightforward, space-race strategy. Today, Aldrin calls for a unified international effort to explore and utilize the moon, a partnership that involves commercial enterprise and other nationwide building upon the Apollo mission.\n\n•What Aldrin views as the biggest mistake he ever made relative to the future of the space program.\n\nAldrin is honest in his critiques of space policy, discussing the economic, political, technological and other issues of viability of various options. It is a personal book in which he discusses his family, especially his father (whose impact on Aldrin is particularly striking); his own life, including his time in the Korean War; his initial rejection by NASA (he was one of the only astronauts who did not start as a test pilot, but as an MIT engineer); his eventual journey to the moon; and his hopes and frustrations. He even calls out large aerospace contractors for a lack of transparency with NASA and admits that he made a big mistake in the 1970s by not being more vocal about his displeasure with the initial design that preceded the Space Shuttle.\n\nMISSION TO MARS uncovers an intimate side of Aldrin, while spotlighting some of the most important issues facing our nation’s space program today.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nBuzz Aldrin, best known for his Apollo 11 moonwalk, holds a doctoral degree in astronautics and, at the age of 83, continues to wield influence as an international advocate of space science and planetary exploration. He has written three nonfiction books, two science fact/fiction novels and two children’s books."
