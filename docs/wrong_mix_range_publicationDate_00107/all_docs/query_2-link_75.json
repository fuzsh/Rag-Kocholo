        "text": "The newÂ Guinness World Records 2017 Edition contains an exclusive foreword by lunar explorer and space scientist Dr Edwin E. âBuzzâ Aldrin Jr, a man who will forever be known for the central role he played in the First manned landing on the moon in 1969.\n\nÂ\n\nThis yearâs book is inspired by two major themes of record-breaking: the conquest of space and pioneering adventures â topics which Buzz, a multiple record-holder, is undoubtedly qualified to talk about.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nThe astronautâs debut record-setting experience took place during the Gemini 12 mission back in 1966, when Buzz took the First selfie in open space.\n\nÂ\n\nâI just opened the hatch and looked around,â Buzz told us, âjust like a sightseeing tourist would. I saw the camera and thought, âI wonder what would happen if I took a picture of meâ, not knowing whether it would turn out at all! The lighting was not too well selected, but you could tell who it was.â\n\nÂ\n\nThree years later on Apollo 11, Buzz and Neil made the first ever human landing on the surface of the Moon.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nGuinness World Records Editor-In-Chief Craig Glenday caught up with Buzz in London earlier this year to talk about his remarkable achievements.\n\nÂ\n\nThe 86-year-old remains passionate about the continuing discoveries in outer space and is currently interested in Mars in particular: âThe children born between the years 2000 and 2010 will be the ones making the first landings on Mars. And itâs those kids that we would like to ensure are enthusiastic about the future,â he says.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nIn the video below Buzz Aldrin shares what it was like to take those world-changing first steps on Earthâs moon and introduces his new book Welcome to Mars which is out now.\n\nÂ\n\nvideo\n\nBuzz was recently evacuated from Antarctica after suffering a health scare during a tourist visit. He was discharged from hospital a couple of weeks ago and we wish him all the best with his continued recovery.\n\nÂ\n\nTo read the special introduction by Buzz and find out more about both historical and recent achievements that have taken place in our incredible universe, pick up a copy of Guinness World Records 2017 Edition."
