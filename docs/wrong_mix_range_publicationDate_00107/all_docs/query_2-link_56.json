Armstrong made three flights in the X-1B to validate the Reaction Control System (RCS) – small thrusters used to stabilize or redirect a vehicle in a near vacuum.\n\nApril 20, 1962: Armstrong completed longest flight in X-15 (12 minutes, 28 seconds); it was an accident. Armstrong was actively engaged in piloting and engineering aspects of the X-15 program from its inception.\n\nMay 6, 1968: Astronaut Armstrong, Apollo 11 mission commander, was forced to eject from the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle seconds before it crashed.\n\nJuly 16, 1969: The 363-feet tall, 6.2 million pound Saturn V rocket launches on the Apollo 11 mission from Kennedy Space Center. Onboard are astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, commander; Michael Collins, command module pilot; and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot. Apollo 11 was the United States’ first manned, lunar landing mission.\n\nJuly 20, 1969: Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin land on the Moon. Armstrong, commander, took this picture of Aldrin with a 70mm Hasselblad lunar surface camera.\n\nMarch 1, 2014: NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center is redesignated NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center. Legislation was signed into law by President Obama in January 2014 to rename NASA Dryden after the late Neil A. Armstrong.\n\nBiography\n\nNeil A. Armstrong\n\nFirst man to set foot on the Moon.\n\nNeil A. Armstrong served as a naval aviator from 1949 to 1952 before joining the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in 1955. Later that year, he transferred to the NACA’s High-Speed Flight Station in Edwards, California, as an aeronautical research scientist and then as a pilot, a position he held until becoming an astronaut in 1962. He was one of nine NASA astronauts in the second class to be chosen.\n\nRead More About Neil about Neil A. Armstrong\n\nFeatured Story\n\nJuly 20, 1969: One Giant Leap For Mankind\n\nJuly 1969.
