        "text": "About the Book\n\nWith vibrant, historically accurate paintings by Wendell Minor, this extraordinary picture book--the first by one of the \"Apollo 11\" astronauts--documents the journey Aldrin made from childhood that eventually led him to achieve his dream and walk on the Moon. Full color.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nPerfect for the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing in summer 2019!\n\nIt's been fifty years since Buzz Aldrin walked on the Moon. But the journey didn't begin when he stepped on board Apollo 11 that fateful day in July 1969. It began the day he was born.\n\nThis picture book is Buzz Aldrin's story, in his words. Wendell Minor's gorgeous paintings evoke the wonder of space exploration for young readers.\n\nBecoming an astronaut took more than education, discipline, and physical strength. It took years of determination and believing that any goal was possible--from riding a bike alone across the George Washington Bridge at age ten to making a footprint on the moon.\n\nWe all have our own dreams. This is the story of how Buzz's came true.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nI walked on the moon. This is my journey. But it didn't begin when I stepped on board Apollo 11 on July 1, 1969. It began the day I was born.\n\nBecoming an astronaut took more than education, discipline, and physical strength. It took years of determination and believing that any goal is possible--from riding a bike alone across the George Washington Bridge at age ten to making a footprint on the Moon.\n\nI always knew the Moon was within my reach--and that I was ready to be on the team that would achieve the first landing. But it was still hard to believe when I took my first step onto the Moon's surface.\n\nWe all have our own dreams. This is the story of how mine came true.\n\nReview Quotes\n\nâ˜… \"Entertaining and informative. Excellent, realistic paintings.\" -- School Library Journal (starred review)\n\n\"A Buzz-worthy book!\" -- Time for Kids\n\n\"Precisely rendered illustrations help this effort really take off. A brief chronology rounds out this solid title.\" -- ALA Booklist\n\n\"Calling all dreamers and wannabe space travellers!\" -- Child Magazine\n\n\"Beautiful and realistic illustrations...in first-person voice. A child's-eye view on space exploration.\" -- Kirkus Reviews"
