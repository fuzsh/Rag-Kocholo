        "text": "April 14, 2013\n\nThis was written in 1973 and the distance between then and now is vast. The excitement of \"man\" landing on the moon, where a nation (might I even say the world?) pulled together, has disappeared and it seems we have deteriorated into a world where no one cares about anything except themselves. Nevertheless, considering the past and the present, I enjoyed this story very much, it vividly outpictures that those we consider heroes and/or celebrities are very much as we: they have their ups/downs, goods/bads, successes/failures. The most important point to me was \". . . there had been the most important goal of all, and it had been realized--I had gone to the moon. What to do next? What possible goal could I add now? There simply wasn't one, and without a goal I was like an inert ping-pong ball being batted about. . .\" [300]. So many of us spend (literally spend our time, like money) pursuing our goals and, when we have achieved them, we had not planned for our success, i.e. what do we do next and where do we go from here? Good read!\n\nJanuary 18, 2013\n\nI heard about this book when it first came out in 1973 and it sounded interesting, but I just got around to reading it in 2013.\n\nThis book is the autobiography of Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon. While there's a chapter on his childhood, it's mostly about his trip to the moon and the next few years of his life\n\nafter he got back.\n\nOn the cover of the book it says, \"An American hero's tragic crack-up and triumphant recovery -- the shocking courageous true story\". That was pretty much the marketing I heard for this book back in the 70's. Well ... if you're looking for some dramatic story about how the famous and respected astronaut ended up as a drug-addled bum living in a dumpster or some such, this isn't it. He talks about a period of a few months when he sufferred from clinical depression and had difficulty concentrating. He eventually checked into a hospital where he was given medication that pretty much solved the problem, and then he was back on his feet. At the same time he was having an affair and considered divorcing his wife to marry this other woman, but in the end he stayed with his wife. That's pretty much it for the \"crack-up and triumphant recovery\". While he doesn't give exact dates for these events, based on the few dates he does give, the whole business started and ended in well under a year. Frankly, I've been through worse times myself. I'm sure it was rough while he and his family were going through it. But it wasn't much of a crack-up, and there was no \"triumphant recovery\" -- he just took some meds and got better. I felt a little guilty when I finished the book, that I was wishing the poor man had gone through some horrible torment just so it would be more entertaining for me to read about. :-)\n\nIn general, the book is your basic autobiography: A somewhat rambling account of the life of a man who had the opportunity to do some extraordinary things. If you're interested in the history of space exploration -- as I am -- you'll find a lot of interesting tidbits in this book. He talks about some of the things happenning behind the scenes at NASA, and in general gives a personal perspective on historic events that brings the Moon landings down to Earth (no pun intended when I started writing that sentence). As I presume most readers are aware that Apollo 11 made it to the Moon, landed, and returned safely, there are no cliff-hangers here, nor are there any dramatic revelations. Just a lot about the day-to-day happennings around that event. If you're looking for something exciting and tense, this isn't the book. If you're looking for details and the personal stories behind big events, you should find this book interesting.\n\nOne other odd thing: Many books start with the most dramatic event, and then flash back to what led up to that event, and then go on from there. But curiously, Aldrin starts with the public relations tour he went on after returning to Earth. Then he goes back to his childhood, events leading up to the Moon landing, and then forward to what he did after the PR tour. I thought the PR tour was about the least interesting thing in the book. I don't know why he put that first. I would have started with the Moon landing.\n\nJuly 10, 2018\n\nI tried, really I did. I kept plugging away at it for a couple weeks. But I ended up reading only a few pages at a time, and then I had to stop. I honestly thought this would be far more interesting than it was. And it could have been. It's told in first person, and the narrator's voice is lifeless and boring. It was like listening to that one college professor who always lectured in the same flat monotone. I'm sorry, Buzz, you are probably a really nice person, but I just wasn't thrilled with the book.\n\nDecember 31, 2014\n\nThe best astronaut autobiography I have read. I have been waiting for one that is real. These were driven men but in the end, human.\n\nMay 18, 2020\n\n2.5 stars\n\nThough well intentioned the writing is rambling. I’ve not read a lot of biographies written by the subject and I was constantly missing the voice of a professional writer. I think the heart of my issue was that the book wandered and lacked clear distinction of purpose. Having defined sections would have helped with this. It seemed like It covered the subject of Aldrins life well but you had to mine out the interesting details. I liked the look at the space program but the singularity of voice made some things vague or left unanswered. Again I wished for an outsiders perspective, someone who had conducted interviews with the others closely involved in the events discussed.\n\nOthers details like Aldrins affair(s?) lacked clarity. Was Aldrin serially unfaithful, or was their just the one long term affair. Also did he explain to his wife that he had been unfaithful and would continue to be and she agreed? I was left with all of these questions.\n\nI was often unclear on what his actual job was, beyond title like astronaut. Again sections could have helped with this.\n\nOther then the space anecdotes the highlight of the book is Aldrins detailing of his struggles with depression. I believe it is important for prominent people, especially those seen as “hero’s”, to be open about their mental health struggles. That said though it was dull reading. Maybe it would be comforting for someone similarly struggling but it contained no expertise so it wasn’t instructive and I, well appreciating its inclusion, was bored by it.\n\nOverall I wouldn’t recommend the book. I think there are probably more interesting ways to get the information. If you do venture in I recommend skim reading whenever you get bored, you won’t miss much.\n\nFebruary 13, 2022\n\nInsightful look into the space programme\n\nBuzz Aldrin used to be just a name I knew. There was no personality behind it, no big story. It turns out he has a PhD in mechanical engineering and also a military background, which is highly interesting.\n\nAfter reading this, I have come to appreciate his intelligence and views. The book shows us that he didn't plan from a young age to go to the moon. Instead, it was a combination of decisions on his part, and fate, which paved the way for him to make it onto the Apollo 11 mission. Had he been place on any other Apollo mission, and history would've looked completely different.\n\nHe speaks not only about the buildup to getting to the moon, but also about the burnout he suffered afterwards. Who can blame him? Once you've made it to the moon, there comes the undeniable feeling that nothing you do will ever live up to that.\n\nHe also speaks about how how some gifts were stolen from him during their world tour, showing that even the best of us are not immune to the evils of the world.\n\nAnyone with an interest in space travel will appreciate this book. It also provided an opportunity for me to learn dozens of new words.\n\nAugust 2, 2019\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon(shot). A straightforward recounting by Buzz Aldrin of the days after his return from the historical voyage to the moon. It's told in a very matter of fact way so can seem a bit listless at first but the story that is told is a fascinating one of a very driven individual who after he achieves one of the greatest human feats ever (w/the help of countless others of course) asks himself, \"What now?\" & has no good answer. I think Buzz was clinically bi-polar, he would definitely probably be diagnosed as that nowadays but at the time he was treated speedily for depression which was just one side of the man's inner demon coin. He's a total douche to his wife, which he admits to completely in the book, but still, it's a little infuriating to read about him having an affair w/an unmarried woman in NYC while his wife is home w/the kids. Buzz's image certainly took a beating w/the publishing of this memoir. It's kinda been resurrected over the years because the guy still is a freakin' hero, I mean, 2nd guy on the moon and all that, but, boy-o did this Icarus have wings of wax.\n\nMay 14, 2020\n\nI was 18 when Apollo 11 landed, and as a kid growing up in Los Angeles, I loved astronauts and the space race. Many of my friends had parents working on components for Apollo.\n\nBut Buzz Aldrin was not one of my favorites. Reading this book 50 years later, in which Aldrin tells his own story, provides reasons for my youthful disconcertment.\n\nA great pilot, brilliant orbital mechanic and thoughtful space walker, he was and is also a highly flawed man. But hey, so are we all. But he also appeared to be arrogant and almost unfriendly.\n\nAs a psychology major in college, I was cautioned by a professor that beneath arrogance often is hiding tremendous insecurity and self doubt. It seems to me Aldrin still suffers these.\n\nBut this book made this national icon more accessible to me than he ever seemed before, and thus, more human, just like the rest of us. I still would rather have a beer with either Neil Armstrong or Mike Collins, but at least now Aldrin seems a more sympathetic soul.\n\nSeptember 27, 2017\n\nI found Return to Earth a quite original book. Even though the style is quick, I still knew what was happening in the biography because it had lots of detail. The book's setting starts off in the module when Neil, Mike and Buzz are about to hit the ocean coming back from the moon. For the rest of the book, though, he is on Earth. The book describes best the struggles that Buzz got after he came back to Earth. He was sick more often since then, for example. The book was predictable as well as \"fast-motioned\". I quite enjoyed the author's voice because it came directly from Buzz and that is why it was quite detailed. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in space and the moon as Buzz describes those part the best.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nSeptember 14, 2019\n\nInteresting inside look at history from within the man\n\nI save 5 stars for life changing works. While I wasn't changed by this autobiograhy, I was impressed with the author's candor. As a child of the space age, I remember where I was when Col. Aldrin walked on the moon. As an adult, I realized that just like everyone, my hero was a man as well as a hero. It's not often that we get to glimpse behind the hype to see the man. He's still a hero to me even after knowing what he considered to be his shortcomings. In fact, perhaps a greater hero to be willing to be so self-disclosing. May God bless him and his family for their many sacrifices to our country and scientific advancement,\n\nAugust 20, 2017\n\nMy love is Buzz is complete\n\nIn a reading challenge this year and had to read a non fiction. I do not like non fiction. But with the anniversary of the Apollo 11 and my long time secret crush on Buzz Aldrin, this was an easy pick. It did take me longer to read than normal, only because when he was not talking about the mission I found it boring. But his honesty with his marriage and mental state, made it worth the effort. Thank you Mr. Aldrin\n\nJuly 28, 2019\n\nI’ve always been fascinated with the moon. Like what even is it? Why do we have it? Does the moon like like me or just like me? This book answered none of those questions but Buzz is a fascinating character who really let people into his struggles with fame, masculinity, traditional family values, and depression with this memoir in a way that would be considered admirable today but (I assume) completely extraordinary in 1973. Anyways, what even is the moon and does it like me like that?!\n\nSeptember 5, 2022\n\n3.5 methinks! definitely slow and dry in places, but still very interesting in many aspects. I really enjoyed the chapters on the internal workings of the air force and space program, and was pleasantly surprised by aldrin’s openness about his mental health struggles and advocacy for mental health awareness. a really special time in history to read a first-hand account from and hopefully a good segue into future space non-fiction schtuff!\n\nOctober 3, 2018\n\nI new Buzz had a story to tell side from the trip to the moon, but I was disappointed that the entire moon trip was just one chapter. He is still a childhood hero for making that trip as well as for all that he has done since then. His story is still a brave one to tell, just not for the reasons I expected.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJuly 18, 2019\n\nHonest and fascinating\n\nI couldn't stop reading this book. It was an in depth look at the flight to the Moon and also the extreme difficulty in dealing with the life that followed. Normal life was impossible after Apollo 11, and I appreciate the candor that Aldrin shows in sharing the details of the depression he faced.\n\nOctober 7, 2019\n\nVery interesting bio\n\nIn fact this book deserves 41/2 stars as most of it is captivating.\n\nIt’s not only the story of the moon landing but the life story of Buzz Aldrin and what happened to him AFTER he was back from the moon, his struggle to go back to a “ normal life” which was never normal.\n\nIt’s the story of Aldrin the astronaut and, more interesting, of Aldrin the man.\n\nNovember 17, 2019\n\nAldrin has a good book with a great moral. He was one of those blessed people - football star, all state, Air Force Academy, chosen to be an astronaut, chosen to land on the moon...then what. He shows both the power of setting goals and the let down that happens when all the goals have been \"checked off.\"\n\nJuly 8, 2021\n\nAn honest and deep look into someone who appears to be invincible. A lot more personal struggles than most astronaut biographies. Still included a lot of the facts we know and love but really added something more. Was pleasantly surprised by this book.\n\nJanuary 19, 2023\n\nWhat an incredibly candid story written from the perspective of the second man to walk on the Moon.\n\nI really applaud Buzz Aldrin for being so open about his struggle with mental health and depression.\n\nDecember 25, 2018\n\nI learned a fair amount about the journey to the moon and the aftermath of such a trip experienced by Col. Aldrin. Glad to have read it.\n\nJanuary 10, 2020\n\nBravo\n\nIncredibly candid, courageous and helpful insights into incredible success and subsequent depression. Easy reading but highly thought provoking. Read it\n\nFebruary 7, 2020\n\nGood thing when he was going to and on the moon he was more stable and made better decisions than subsequently in his personal life.\n\nMay 23, 2020\n\nReturn to earth.\n\nVery dry. Hard to read could not read for a extended period. Does it stay sequential either. Sad as a little work it would be very good.\n\nJune 13, 2020\n\nHard to read\n\nI .was a little confused on the fact that Buzz injected another book on the end of the original book.\n\nMarch 11, 2021\n\nEnthralling book. Every time I picked it up I had to pry myself away from it.\n\nOctober 21, 2023\n\nCan you make a book about 1st Moon landing boring? Yes you can. Wasted time and money.\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nI have always thought Buzz Aldrin was a bit egotistical, how he comes across in interviews and such, and this book cements it. He takes no responsbility for any of his actions, from not taking any photos of Armstrong on the moon to cheating on his wife, none of it is his fault. He was the best at this so he was entitled to do that, he should have been this, I knew from other stories that he thought he deserved to be the first on the moon not the second, well he doesn't take much in his stride, he is all ego."
