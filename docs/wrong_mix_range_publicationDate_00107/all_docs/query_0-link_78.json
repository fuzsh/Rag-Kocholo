We reserve the right to limit the number of books signed per person. No personalization, no memorabilia, no posed photos will be allowed.\n\nxlsteve\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 391\n\nFrom: Holbrook MA, USA\n\nRegistered: Jul 2008\n\nposted 08-27-2009 12:00 PM Astro Auction has an interesting item. It's a dutch auction for photos signed only \"Buzz.\" I wonder if these are more or less desirable due to unusual nature of the signature.\n\nAlso, if you were to bring one of these to a show would Buzz charge you only half the signing fee to add his last name? Or would a 'completion fee' be applied? (These questions are slightly tongue-in-cheek, but they did pop up when I saw this auction).\n\nSpaceSteve\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 428\n\nFrom: San Antonio TX, USA\n\nRegistered: Apr 2004\n\nposted 10-31-2009 08:23 PM I drove up to Austin TX (about 65 miles) today to attend Buzz Aldrin's discussion and book signing at the annual Texas Book Festival, held inside, and on the grounds and immediate vicinity of the State Capital Building.\n\nBuzz came out at 12:45 and talked a bit about Apollo 11 and his life both before and after. Nothing really noteworthy or new, but an enjoyable 45 minutes. He seemed to be in good spirits.\n\nAt 1:30, he began signing his book \"Magnificent Desolation\". This is where my only problem occurred (not at all Buzz's fault). In all the handouts, flyers, and their website, it was announced that all book signings would be held in the \"Book Signings Tent\". This tent was approximately 8 city blocks from the Paramount Theatre, where Buzz discussed the book. This was apparently standard among all book signers (the Austin Book Festival is a huge event, with dozens of authors, and thousands of attendees). Also, another author went onstage at the Paramount Theatre at 1:30 to discuss her book.\n\nSo... I left the theatre as soon as Buzz left the stage, and walked the 8 blocks to the signings tent. Upon getting there, I noticed that Buzz was not listed on the book signing schedule! What's going on here!!\n\nI tracked down a worker, and she informed me that Buzz's (and another author's) signings were being done at the Paramount Theatre, presumably due to the expected crowd size. This is where I raised the point that there was no announcement made of this fact... nothing to indicate that Buzz's signing was any different from any of the other dozens of attending authors. The lady apologized and expressed surprise that there was no announcement made of the signing venue.\n\nSo, I proceeded to trek the 8 blocks back to the theatre and got in line. Ultimately, there were only about 15 people behind me (out of perhaps 500 or so). A few others had also made the trek back-and-forth between the theatre and tent. Anyway, the line was moving relatively quickly, and at 2:40, I finally got to Buzz's table.\n\nHe was in a very good mood... laughing, smiling, and making small friendly comments to all attendees... especially the kids.\n\nHe was only signing Magnificent Desolation; no other books or memorabilia. I saw a few people with photos, Life Magazines and such, and I had also brought my copy of \"Voices from the Moon\" by Andrew Chaikin, just in case.\n\nAll-in-all, it was a good couple of hours. And I even got some extra exercise!\n\nDickDasturdly\n\nNew Member\n\nPosts: 4\n\nFrom: NW GA USA\n\nRegistered: Jan 2010\n\nposted 01-11-2010 01:33 PM I went to \"An Evening With Buzz,\" a book signing in Atlanta this past fall.\n\nTo start, I knew nothing about Buzz' attitude toward autographs and such... But I have a special baseball bat that I get \"Hall of Fame\" types to sign.\n\nOn it, I have baseball players Eddie Mathews, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine. I later added President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Rosalyn Carter. Still later, I added singer Willie Nelson, who actually signed during his concert (I was on the front row in Columbus, GA.)\n\nWe decided that we'd try to get Buzz on the bat. We got to the bookstore early and while looking for a parking spot I saw a black SUV pull up. Buzz hops out of the back along with a lady (turns out to be his wife — and she was/seemed to be the real obstacle to getting him) I shook his hand and told him I was a teacher of 21 years, yada, yada and \"Dr. Aldrin, will you please sing my bat\"? He looked at me funny and then his wife said \"NO, WE don't do memorabilia.\" As he walked off (they were entering the rear of the book store, so there was zero crowd) he said, \"I don't sign baseballs either...\"\n\nWe didn't give up. I snuck the bat into the show by sticking it down my jeans. I bought seven books and as he signed them I asked about the bat again. He said \"I don't play baseball\" and I replied \"neither did Willie Nelson or President Carter\" (it was funny to me!)\n\nMeanwhile, I had been talking to his driver — the husband of the store owner and he said he would see what he could do about getting it signed. As we waited in the parking lot the gentleman (nice guy!) came out and held up FIVE fingers — meaning he'd sign it for $500.00. I said \"no\" and that was that.\n\nI will say that I was disappointed just because I really work to get HoF'ers on the bat and I knew that was my last crack at Buzz... but all in all it was a thrill to meet the guy and we left with a great story!\n\nAND I had one of the autographs framed and matted with the ticket to the signing and the famous 8'x10\" visor shot. It is very cool.\n\nmjanovec\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 3811\n\nFrom: Midwest, USA\n\nRegistered: Jul 2005\n\nposted 01-11-2010 09:42 PM It's not a surprise to most space collectors that Buzz said \"no\" to your request. Generally, Buzz will only sign memorabilia at a dedicated memorabilia signing (like Spacefest or the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation autograph show) or a mail-in signing, and only for a fee (that generally ranges from $350-600 or more). Besides money reasons, he likely refuses to sign memorabilia at book signings because everyone else in the audience will also expect their memorabilia to be signed for free. Plus, since the book tour is paid for by the publisher, it is expected that Buzz will sign as many books as possible in the limited amount of time he has, in order to make as many sales of the book as possible for the publisher.

If it's only the signature that matters to you, then that may be the best solution.\n\nNovaRob\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 242\n\nFrom: Tucson, Arizona, USA\n\nRegistered: Nov 2008\n\nposted 04-06-2012 02:13 PM Buzz is not the only astronaut that charges extra for a completion.

Out of respect I try not to be too intrusive.\n\nBuzz Aldrin gave a talk at the Royal Festival Hall in London a few years ago and I bought his book which had his signature on a bookplate inside which I was more than pleased with.\n\nAlthough it is nice to have an autograph to me it is not the most important thing. I am just happy to have met them and feel honoured to have done so thanks to the people who make this possible.\n\nGACspaceguy\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 2474\n\nFrom: Guyton, GA\n\nRegistered: Jan 2006\n\nposted 04-07-2012 06:56 AM Here is my take on signing fees, extra words and completions. Jackie and I will sell anyone on the forum our individual signature on a 8x10 glossy of our living room display for $10 and if we both sign it will be an additional $10 for a crew completion. Would you do it? I would say not. Why, because it holds no value for you.\n\nWhat you need to decide is; what is the value of that signed item worth to you? At the last ASF signing we had planned on two Buzz signatures, one on our LM model (and that spot is still open on the LM itself, as Buzz did not make the signing) the other on the \"Wonder of it All\" poster.\n\nBefore we went we counted up our Buzz signed items, we have 16 of them. So was it worth paying the ($400x2)+$100 (3D item) +$50 (mission number) = $950 to add another Buzz signature to our collection. Yes, and for us it was, the LM model discussion is already on this site and the poster had a sentimental value that for us was and is priceless.\n\nWe were willing to pay that amount for those items to be signed; it was not just the signature. The last signature we picked up of Buzz was $35 in one of his fictional books. But I could not take that inexpensive signature and place it on our desired items. But what I did do is I turned it into a display for a friend at work for a total of $100 of framing and pictures.\n\nI know it is frustrating to pay a lot of money for something you would really like to have, especially when just four years ago it was less than half the current price. I have no pity for the people that take a dozen of 8x10 WSS shot to have signed for resale; it makes no sense to do that with all of the availability of Buzz's signature out there. To me they are at the event for all the wrong reasons, for them they are okay with it.\n\nFor me it is interesting that it was okay to pay John Young $595 for his signature as \"he never signs\" but for a guy who signs all the time, $400 is \"ridiculous,\" when they are both equal in historic value (let us not debate that statement and just take it in context). We pay for what we hold as valuable. Decide the value for you and determine your actions based on that decision.\n\nHart Sastrowardoyo\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 3445\n\nFrom: Toms River, NJ\n\nRegistered: Aug 2000\n\nposted 04-07-2012 07:40 AM Funny (or not) Buzz story: At the MIT+150 event were about half a dozen astronauts, including Aldrin. Granted, he was in a wheelchair and that may have something to do with it, but before and after the event, people for the most part shied away from asking Aldrin for an autograph.\n\nJust to play devil's advocate, I will throw out there probably the hardest thing for some people to accept is an astronaut charging a fee, when on occasion they will sign without a fee (and it's not just Aldrin.) I won't repeat my argument that there's really no such thing as a \"free\" autograph. But I will surmise that there would be less debate if a person was more consistent, e.g. \"I'm sorry but I don't sign in-person. However, if you send me your items at this address, I'll be more than happy to for this amount for my time.\"\n\nmachbusterman\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 1778\n\nFrom: Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland\n\nRegistered: May 2004\n\nposted 04-07-2012 01:21 PM\n\nquote: Originally posted by Daugherty54:\n\nConsidering the signature is of the second man ever to set foot on the moon on the first landing and it's probably a fair price.\n\nFair price?

Nor was their fame part of their job responsibility for the government.

Their deceitful actions have hurt the hobby, and introduced doubt about the earnest nature behind youthful enthusiasm.\n\nThat aside, I think you need to ask yourself why it is you are writing. If you want to share your admiration for Dr. Aldrin, then send your letter and consider any reply to be an unexpected bonus. If however, you really desire an autograph, then I'd suggest perhaps looking for a newspaper route, snow shoveling job or some other means (agreeable to your parents) for setting the autograph as your goal and saving up the money you raise.\n\nMr. Apollo 17\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 55\n\nFrom: Ashland, OH USA\n\nRegistered: Feb 2012\n\nposted 11-25-2012 10:44 AM I want to write him because I want to go to Mars, and with him being the second man to walk on the Moon, it would be a great honor to write one of my heroes.

My flight arrived into Phoenix late, and as a result, I just missed my connection to Flagstaff â the plane hadn't left yet, but the gate was closed and they wouldn't let anyone else on board.â¨\n\nAs I was standing at the check-in desk trying to talk my way onto the plane, this old guy comes up behind me and starts raising hell with the gate clerk, demanding to speak to the pilot, cursing, etc. I turn around to see who's making such a commotion, and see this guy who looks an awful lot like Buzz. After shouting at the guy for a minute or two, he pauses. I look at him and ask, \"Are you Buzz Aldrin?\" He looks over at me and say, \"Yeah I'm Buzz Aldrin, now get that damn pilot on the phone...!\"\n\nAnyway, long story short, Buzz and I ended up renting a car together and I spent the next two hours driving him up to Flagstaff (where he was attending the IAA Planetary Defense Conference). On the drive up talked about lots of things: Mars missions, SpaceX, politics, and diving. I didn't have the nerve to ask him anything about Apollo XI or his experience on the moon mission, but he wasn't shy about giving his opinion on the current space program! A few times during the drive, I glanced out my driver's side window at the almost-full moon above the horizon. Then I'd glance over at the man who sitting next to me â amazed that I had ended up here, driving one of the very first moonwalkers through the Arizona night. An amazing evening indeed.\n\nOnce we got to Flagstaff and dealt with the rental car, he gave me his business card and some contact information. As he handed it to me, I saw that it was a very cool Apollo XI card with the mission emblem and a little astronaut logo. I couldn't resist asking him to sign it for me (which he did). At the time I didn't know he was such a reluctant public signer âÂ probably never would have asked otherwise.\n\n(Best moment: When we were waiting at the rental car place, he took out his iPhone to call his niece to pick us up in Flagstaff. He looked for the phone number in his contact book for a few seconds, then, having difficulty reading the small letters, he handed the phone to me: \"What does that say...?\" I looked at the phone number. \"It says Neil Armstrong.\" Buzz paused a moment, looked at me, then said: \"Don't think he's gonna be picking up any time soon...\" Priceless!)\n\njamato99\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 147\n\nFrom: Leesburg, VA USA\n\nRegistered: Apr 2003\n\nposted 10-09-2013 03:24 PM Wow!!!
