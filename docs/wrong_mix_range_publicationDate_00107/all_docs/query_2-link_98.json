        "text": "Each month, the Columbia Public Library offers selections from its collection related to a current best-seller or hot topic. Library Associate David Litherland compiled this month’s selections.\n\nScience fiction has captured readers' imaginations for as long as we have wondered about the future. From H.G. Wells’ and Jules Verne’s early escapades, to the far future via time machine and to the moon by way of a cannon, came a fascination as to what we could do and where we could go with the powers of science.\n\nImmerse yourself in the aspirational themes of today’s science fiction, with a corresponding dose of science fact to deepen your understanding and increase your excitement for tomorrow’s world.\n\nWhat would a human’s life on Mars look like? Can we survive and thrive in its rust-red desert, or can we change the planet to fit us? One of science fiction’s preeminent preoccupations, the settlement, and eventual terraforming, of Mars has been a part of the futurist outlook since Ray Bradbury’s novel on the idea in the 1950s. Kim Stanley Robinson’s “Red Mars” (Bantam Books, 1993) dives deep into the technology and techniques that would be needed to build a sustainable colony on Mars, as well as the political, social and relationship struggles of the first hundred humans to settle on the Red Planet.\n\nOf course, living somewhere other than Earth is an intrinsically challenging thing even in the most fanciful and optimistic sci-fi. For one, how do we have kids in a zero/low-g environment? Scientist and humorist duo Kelly and Zach Weinersmith’s “A City on Mars” (Penguin Press, 2023) tempers the expectations of those who push for us to settle on Mars soon, and discusses the true difficulties a species that evolved on Earth would face to survive in places that are not Earth — all with their signature wit and comical drawings.\n\nIn the actual course of history, the American Space Race sent three men, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, to land on the Moon in 1969. “The Calculating Stars” (Tor, 2018) by Mary Robinette Kowal tells an alternate story: after a meteorite strikes the Eastern Seaboard in 1952, early plans for space exploration are accelerated as scientists warn of a climate disaster due to the impact. Thus begins a different kind of space race: a race to get humankind off a doomed planet.\n\nElma York, an accomplished pilot, physicist and computer for the fledgling space program, knows that if you want to send mankind to the stars, you'll need to send womankind too. The novel follows her struggles against the prejudice, racism and sexism of the time.\n\nTo complement the story of the fictional first women in space, read about the real ones. “The Six” (Scribner, 2023) by Loren Grush highlights the first class of American women to be selected for NASA’s shuttle program. Follow the lives of Sally Ride, Judy Resnik and their four compatriots as they are recruited into the astronaut training program to help establish the foundations of the space shuttle era of exploration, all while struggling with media scrutiny, establishment sexism and the tragedy of accidents like the Challenger explosion.\n\nBeyond travel to our cosmic neighbors, some science fiction holds grander goals of exploring and spreading to other solar systems, and, hopefully, encountering life beyond our pale blue dot. Lauded fantasy writer Christopher Paolini’s first foray into science fiction, “To Sleep in a Sea of Stars” (Tor, 2020) follows Kira Navárez, a xenobiologist exploring just that idea.\n\nShe has it all: a stable job researching new forms of life on a moon in the Sigma Draconis system, a chance to settle down in a new space colony once her contract is up and a loving partner to forge this new life with. But after accidental exposure to alien technology hidden on the moon leads to tragedy, Kira faces a lifelong bond with an intelligent alien weapon as well as a future that is in grave danger from ancient threats awoken by her actions.\n\nOf course, the existence of alien life, let alone alien intelligence, is a highly-debated topic in the scientific world. The director of the Carl Sagan Institute, Lisa Kaltenegger, explores what we have learned about the planets surrounding far-flung stars in her debut science book “Alien Earths” (St. Martin’s Press, 2024).\n\nFrom the first confirmation of a planet orbiting another star in the early ‘90s to the discovery of the five-thousandth planet two years ago, the roster of planets potentially like our own has grown dramatically. Kaltenegger examines some of the more unique specimens, as well as speculates on what these strange new worlds could mean for what life is like out in the cosmos."
