— Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) narrates the opening of Tim Burton’s Ed Wood (1994)

It would have been abundantly easy to make the bio-pic Ed Wood (1994) a mean-spirited film about the so-called “worst director of all time.” It would have been safe — and it would have gone mostly unquestioned — if director Tim Burton had created a film version of Wood’s life that aped the mocking tone of books such as the Medveds’ popular Golden Turkey Awards.

But Burton does not select that easy, familiar route here.

Instead of crafting a film about someone who — by accepted and widely-held standards — made incredibly “bad” movies, Burton creates a film about someone who was inspired by and actually in love with the movie-making process.

In other words, Tim Burton’s Ed Wood is not about those characteristics and talents that separated Ed Wood from Orson Welles. It’s about the qualities those legendary cinema talents have in common.

And that simple conceit makes Ed Wood not merely a heartfelt, emotional story of artistic endurance, but, in some sense, an inspirational tale about overcoming obstacles (including the entrenched obstacles of Tinsel Town…) and the primacy of pursuing one’s own vision.

Naturally, this film is not strictly “true,” since Ed Wood never really met Orson Welles, and since details of Bela Lugosi’s career and life have been altered to some degree for dramatic purposes. And yet Ed Wood feels emotionally true because Burton sees in Wood an indomitable figure — an eternal optimist — who despite the mocking of the masses and the disinterest of Hollywood power did precisely what he desired…and is remembered and even loved for it.

Like so many Tim Burton films, Ed Wood concerns a protagonist who is far afield from what society-at-large terms “the norm.” However, Wood’s response to his own apparent “strangeness” is not isolation, resentment or even bitterness. Instead, as the film reveals beautifully, Ed Wood creates a “bubble” of acceptance for those “hunted” and “despised” individuals who don’t conform, either socially or sexually to society’s rules or standards. Importantly, Ed’s world of film making is one entirely without harsh judgement…or judgement of any kind for that matter.

“Ed, this isn’t the real world. You’ve surrounded yourself with a bunch of weirdos.”

Ed Wood tells the story of a young artist on hopeful but rocky ascent. Although Ed (Johnny Depp) has assembled an entourage of colorful actors, including girlfriend Dolores (Sarah Jessica Parker) to support his work, he’s bedeviled by bad reviews and a lack of interest by the public at large.

When Wood’s new play, Casual Company opens in L.A., it is met with disinterest and negativity, but Ed is able to see the silver lining around every cloud. When a famous movie critic comments positively on the Army costumes that appear in the play, Ed trumpets his production’s “realism.”

Soon, Ed learns that Screen Classics is preparing a movie based on the sex change of Christine Jorgensen. Because of his own fetish for angora and women’s clothing, Ed pitches himself as director for the project. At first he is rebuffed, but then, serendipitously, Ed meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), the former screen Dracula who has not worked in years. Ed returns to Screen Classics and pitches Bela as a participant in the sex change picture, and history is made. Before long, Ed shoots Glen or Glenda, an autobiographical film about men who “feel comfortable” in women’s clothes.

After Glen or Glenda bombs, Ed dives into his next project, Bride of the Atom (soon to be titled Bride of the Monster). He casts wrestler Tor Johnson (George Steele) as the monstrous henchman Lobo, and Lugosi as a villainous mad scientist. Loretta King (Juliet Landau) becomes his lead actress when she intimates (falsely…) that she has the money and inclination to support the production, a fact which alienates Dolores. While they make Bride of the Atom, Bela and Ed deepen their friendship, and Ed learns that Bela is a morphine addict. After the film is completed, Ed helps Bela check into rehab.

Following the disappointing reception of Bride of the Monster, Bela passes away, leaving a despondent Ed. But with a small film reel consisting of footage of Bela that he shot before the actor passed away, Ed realizes he possesses “the acorn” of a great tree. With funding secured from a fundamentalist Baptist church, Ed plans to resurrect Lugosi on screen one last time for his magnum opus: Plan 9 from Outer Space. Committed to making a final film “for Bela,” Wood pulls together his friends, including Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), the great Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), Vampira (Lisa Marie) and Tor Johnson.

Finally, countenancing interference from the baptists on the set, Ed stands to lose everything until a fateful chance encounter with Orson Welles…

“Eddie is the only fella in town who doesn’t judge people.”

The friendship between Lugosi and Wood is very much at the heart of Ed Wood, and both roles are impeccably performed. Landau earned an Academy Award for his heartfelt, often very funny performance as Lugosi, and rightfully so. Again, in a notable example of art imitating life, Landau himself had gone through a kind of “career death” in the mid-1980s before a resurgence that saw him headlining in films such as Tucker: A Man and His Dream (1987) and Woody Allen’s Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). Landau is at his expressive best here portraying a man who is not just addicted to morphine, but to movie-making itself…to the magic of the silver screen. It’s clear that only one thing makes Lugosi well: the opportunity to practice his art.

As silly as that dialogue clearly plays, it does a good job of revealing Ed’s positive influence on those around him. His creation of a “bubble of safety” allows people like Lugosi and Breckinridge to find a safe harbor in an often-cruel town. Notably, the woman he falls in love with, Kathy, passes the same test. Ed informs her up front about his cross-dressing habits and she accepts them, no ifs, ands or buts. Once Eddie knows that Kathy is accepting, little else matters.

But Eddie never lets those assholes get him down, at least for very long, and the script often references this fact. When Eddie is told by a studio head that he made “the worst movie ever,” his immediate response is “my next one will be better.”

When at the end of the film, Eddie suggests driving to Las Vegas, his girlfriend Kathy (Patricia Arquette) reminds him that it is raining, and that it is a five hour ride to Vegas. Wood’s response is, again, characteristic of his optimism: “It’s only a five hour drive and it’ll probably stop by the time we get to the desert. Heck, it’ll probably stop by the time we get around the corner. Let’s go.”
