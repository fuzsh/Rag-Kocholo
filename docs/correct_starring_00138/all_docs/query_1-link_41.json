        "text": "The list of film directors that have a style so signature that their name can be “conjugated” into shorthand to describe a visual or emotional cue is a short one. Lynchian, Fellini-esque, Kubrickian, and so on. Tim Burton is one of them. Few fans of film don’t know exactly what “Burton-esque” entails. Frequent collaborations with artists like composer Danny Elfman and production designer Bo Welch certainly helped bring this about, but it’s Burton’s own personality that shaped it. A fondness for the weird and macabre, rooting interest in social misfits, rigid and joyless real life/normalcy juxtaposed against the creativity and flamboyance of the afterlife/idiosyncrasy, etc. Towards the end of the 20th century, he was one of the most imaginative and consistently interesting directors working in Hollywood; even when the stories or characters came up a bit short, the images, playfulness, and atmosphere would save the day. Then the 21st century arrived.\n\nIt’s not fair to say that Burton “lost it” in the last couple of decades. Some things worked, like a pair of enjoyable animated pictures, a big-budget musical, an imaginative father-son story…but too many of his projects during this span didn’t feel like stories he should care about (or the audience, for that matter). Too many remakes. Too much CGI. Too much fuzziness in themes, storytelling, and visuals. I don’t know about you, but when it comes to really talented filmmakers, I’d rather see them go for broke with a spectacular failure than churn out something mediocre that feels unloved, unnurtured, and pointless. One gets a sense that Burton really has affection for that fella Ed with the scissors for hands and that fella Ed who loved making cheap exploitation movies. Did anyone really feel like Burton gave a rat’s behind about anyone in that “Dark Shadows” adaptation or that monstrosity “inspired” by the work of Lewis Carroll? I know I didn’t.\n\nNeither of those two are getting an appraisal below, but nine other Burton pictures are. Anyone interested in more T.B. can check out three additional films already reviewed on this site (including that aforementioned father-son tale): Big Fish, Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, Planet of the Apes.\n\nBeetlejuice (1988)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Starring Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, Winona Ryder, Michael Keaton, Catherine O’Hara, Jeffrey Jones, Glenn Shadix, Sylvia Sidney, Robert Goulet, Dick Cavett, Annie McEnroe. [PG]\n\nWickedly bent, bizarre and hysterical supernatural-black comedy-fantasy (family-friendly, to boot!) detailing the outlandish afterlife of suddenly deceased married couple Davis and Baldwin, whose spirits linger in the material world and are forced to deal with an obnoxious new family moving into their house. Their plan: get rid of these intruders by scaring them right off the premises, which they decide to do with a little help from the titular vulgar, mischievous “bio-exorcist” played by a barely-recognizable Keaton. Raucous fun, particularly for those with a predilection for the manic and moribund, even if it’s heavier on gimmicks and gags than plot or character; imaginative production design from Bo Welch, oodles of funny visuals and clever camerawork, and spot-on performances from the entire cast. The pairing of Danny Elfman’s joyfully wonky score with multiple Harry Belafonte tunes is unorthodox, to be sure, but also near-brilliant. Oscar-winning makeup effects. Later an animated television series and a stage musical.\n\n84/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nBig Eyes (2014)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Starring Christoph Waltz, Amy Adams, Danny Huston, Krysten Ritter, Delaney Raye, Jon Polito, Madeleine Arthur, Jason Schwartzman, Terence Stamp, James Saito. [PG-13]\n\nSad but true story of prolific painter Margaret Keane (Adams), famous for an idiosyncratic artistic gimmick of depicting children with large, melancholy eyes like watery black pancakes…or, at least, she would have been famous if her second husband, Walter (Waltz), didn’t take credit for her work all along. A tender and well-meaning exposé of artistic ownership and spousal control/silencing, but also a curiously artificial one, with almost all of its pleasures and emotions resting on the surface, mimicking the flat pop-art stylings of Keane’s bright but soppy kitsch. Adams gives an affecting performance, wounded, trembling and cloistered, expressing volumes (appropriately enough) in her eyes, but it’s a poor match with Waltz’s more cartoonish hysterics—it’s not so much that his efforts are trashy so much as it seems like he’s plying his trade in an entirely different film than his co-star. Burton’s storied fondness for misfits and outsiders doesn’t seem to extend to the beleaguered Mrs. Keane, and there’s nothing distinguishing about the stylized polish he applies to the period detail. Script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the writing duo that previously scripted Burton’s Ed Wood.\n\n49/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp, David Kelly, Freddie Highmore, Noah Taylor, Helena Bonham Carter, Julia Winter, AnnaSophia Robb, Missi Pyle, Jordan Fry, James Fox, Adam Godley, Deep Roy, Christopher Lee, Philip Wiegratz, Franziska Troegner, David Morris, Liz Smith, Eileen Essell, (voice) Geoffrey Holder. [PG]\n\nSecond cinematic stab at adapting the beloved Roald Dahl children’s book isn’t a musical like the first film (though there are a handful of peculiar song numbers in the second half) and goes all in on stylized synthetic production sheen to gloss over all the familiar elements. As before, poor good boy Charlie (Highmore) lucks into a golden ticket to tour the candy factory of eccentric recluse Willy Wonka (Depp) along with four other children, each of them spoiled, pathetic, and/or nasty in some way. Creative set design and uneven but always eye-catching visual effects dominate throughout (even before arriving at the factory), but most of the changes don’t work well, especially the decision to continuously interrupt the tour with flashbacks to Wonka first meeting the Oompa Loompas (all of them played here by Deep Roy) and his candy-less childhood as the son of a strict dentist (Lee)—these sojourns always throw off the rhythm and pad out the running time, mostly just so John August’s script can clumsily alter the original ending. Depp is fun when he’s snipping at the bratty young’uns, but his overall performance is too weird, full of the kind of distractingly showy tics that the actor loves to trot out; Highmore’s work is so small and sincere that he practically disappears from the picture once he gets to the factory. May play better for those who’ve never read the book or seen the 70s version with Gene Wilder.\n\n61/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nCorpse Bride (2005)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton & Mike Johnson. Starring (voices) Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, Richard E. Grant, Tracey Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Enn Reitel, Jane Horrocks. [PG]\n\nMacabre but delightful stop-motion feature from Burton and company, telling the story of a fish merchant’s timid, clumsy son (Depp), engaged to marry the daughter (Watson) of an aristocratic family that has fallen on hard times, but the poor guy accidentally slips the wedding ring onto the finger of a dead woman (Carter) who rises from the grave and accepts the “offer”! If Burton’s involvement wasn’t enough of a clue, the color scheme gives away this fantasy’s outlook—the land of the living is dull and washed-out and grim, but the land beyond is full of energy, hue, and humor. The trim running time helps overcome some pacing issues, yet this handsome, engaging fable gets overly cluttered with plot as it goes; the sly humor, love story, and performance pieces are what count, not the dark schemes and secrets of a murderous con-artist voiced by Grant. Splendid voice cast, with special notice to Reitel’s amusing (if brief) send-up of Peter Lorre in the form of a lime-green maggot that lives in the corpse bride’s head. Music by frequent Burton collaborator, Danny Elfman; he also voices the singing lounge skelly called Bonejangles. Loosely based on an old Russian folktale, with original characterizations by Burton and Carlos Grangel.\n\n74/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nDumbo (2019)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Starring Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito, Michael Keaton, Nico Parker, Eva Green, Finley Hobbins, Alan Arkin, DeObia Oparei, Roshan Seth, Joseph Gatt. [PG]\n\nThe Disney animated classic of a baby circus elephant with oversized ears who learns to fly gets the live-action remake treatment, but the story so poorly resembles the original that the description hardly qualifies. Instead, this overextended enterprise focuses the lion’s share of its attention on the newly-added human characters, like one-armed war veteran circus worker Farrell and his kids, ringmaster DeVito, and pitiless entertainment entrepreneur Keaton; as for li’l Dumbo, he’s a sad-eyed sweetie far more deserving of the spotlight. To those wondering just how far removed everything is, be advised that this picture is almost twice as long as its predecessor, and Dumbo is flying by the forty-minute mark. As (artificially) eye-filling as it is vacuous, it’s somehow both half-baked and overbaked, the script is typical hackwork from Ehren Kruger, and the actors get little to work with and do little in return (the villains sneer for the back row, but DeVito underplays a part he probably seemed perfect for, and Arkin is astonishingly lazy as a hard-to-impress potential investor). Not the Burton-Keaton-DeVito reunion one might have hoped for, and there’s hardly a moment onscreen that has even the faintest stamp of the director’s personality or signature style—that’s the House of Mouse for you. Boxing announcer Michael Buffer makes an appearance, tweaking his trademark line to declare, “Let’s get ready for Dumbo-o-o-o!”\n\n39/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp, Dianne Wiest, Winona Ryder, Alan Arkin, Kathy Baker, Anthony Michael Hall, Conchata Ferrell, O-Lan Jones, Caroline Aaron, Vincent Price, Robert Oliveri, Dick Anthony Williams. [PG-13]\n\nRemarkably imaginative fairy tale of a lonely man—or lonely man-like creation—with scissors for hands named Edward (Depp). He lives in a decrepit old Gothic mansion on top of a hill, looming over an incongruously idyllic vision of magazine suburbia; when the local friendly Avon lady (Wiest) discovers him, her nurturing side takes over and she brings him to live with her family, causing quite the tizzy among her nosy neighbors. A delightful mix of whimsy, melancholy and social satire for a while, but the second half loses focus of what’s working so well, introducing an improbable (and underwritten, even by fable standards) romance angle between Edward and Wiest’s daughter (Ryder), as well as jarring tonal shifts and violence in the final act. Depp is well-cast as the sad-eyed recluse, Wiest is great as always, and Arkin has fun playing a send-up of the well-meaning but unmindful 50s dad stereotype; Ryder, however, is miscast as a blonde cheerleader, and it’s just as peculiar seeing former “John Hughes dweeb” Hall playing her jock jerk of a boyfriend. Script by Caroline Thompson from Burton’s screen story. The lullaby-waltz musical score was provided by regular Burton collaborator Danny Elfman; Bo Welch and Tom Duffield’s production design is fantastic, especially in the old laboratory where Edward was created by his inventor, nicely played by Price in his last onscreen feature film appearance.\n\n77/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nEd Wood (1994)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, Juliet Landau, Lisa Marie, George “The Animal” Steele, Mike Starr, Max Casella, Brent Hinkley, Clive Rosengren, G. D. Spradlin, Ned Bellamy, Stanley DeSantis. [R]\n\nDepp is a scrappy delight as Edward D. Wood Jr., the director of some of the worst movies ever made (Glen or Glenda, Plan 9 from Outer Space, etc.), but as director Burton and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski are eager to point out, no one can make such “innocent disasters” without being a cheerful optimist absolutely in love with making movies. Capturing the tone and aesthetic of the man’s life and work more than the specific details/chronology, this clever and visually arresting biopic may stretch the truth at times (and prudently overlooks some of the darker aspects of the man’s life, such as the alcoholism that would lead to his deterioration and early death), but it’s a disarming joy just to watch Ed and his “usual cast of misfits and dope addicts” go about their laughably inept business. It’s also as much a glimpse into Ed’s erratically wacky moviemaking efforts as it is a sweet story of his friendship with declining horror star Béla Lugosi (flawlessly portrayed by Landau in an Oscar-winning performance). Stefan Czapsky’s beautiful black & white photography and the lovingly-recreated “phony” sets from Tom Duffield and Cricket Rowland should prove a great pleasure for Wood newbies and cultists alike. Also won an Academy Award for Makeup. Funny cameo from Vincent D’Onofrio as Wood’s filmmaking idol, Orson Welles (voice dubbed by Maurice LaMarche).\n\n93/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nMars Attacks! (1996)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Starring Jack Nicholson, Jim Brown, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martin Short, Lukas Haas, Rod Steiger, Natalie Portman, Sylvia Sidney, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox, Pam Grier, Lisa Marie, Paul Winfield, Danny DeVito, Tom Jones, Joe Don Baker, O-Lan Norris, Jack Black. [PG-13]\n\nAll-star, big-budget sci-fi spoof with hundreds of Martian flying saucers traveling to Earth to eradicate their interplanetary neighbors; Earth might have stood a chance if most of its inhabitants weren’t so spectacularly stupid (thank goodness for Slim Whitman, then). Burton and company are clearly having a good time, giving its huge cast opportunities to land a one-liner or two and then step aside—they don’t inhabit characters so much as stereotypes that should be recognizable to anyone who loves drive-in fodder and/or VHS cheese. It’s flaky and inconsistently paced, but also bright, bizarre, silly, and imaginative, with its cartoonishly retro special effects being a real treat, and the production expertly riding that treacherous line between affectionate and mean-spirited when it comes to its carnival of cardboard; besides, a double dose of buffoonery from wily Nicholson in a dual role (the US president and a sleazoid casino boss) shouldn’t be scoffed at. The script, by Jonathan Gems and an uncredited Burton, is inspired by a Topps trading card series from the 1960s, but probably even more so by the alien invasion hysteria pictures from the 1950s (to say nothing for its “accidental” send-up of the blockbuster Independence Day, which opened a mere five months before this one). Sidney’s final film; also the last time Fox would appear in the flesh in a feature film that wasn’t merely a cameo.\n\n75/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Ed Sanders, Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener, Sacha Baron Cohen, Laura Michelle Kelly. [R]\n\nDark but dazzling adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler musical infuses the Grand Guignol with toe-tapping melody, an operatic tragedy with the cold steel of a slasher and the pounding heart of a hopeless romantic. Burton didn’t seem a likely candidate to ever helm a snazzy song-and-dancer, but who else but him could bring this deliciously sordid story to life on the big screen? By dropping much of the dancing and group choruses and focusing on intimate musical performances driven by the plot, emotions, and inner thoughts of the characters, Burton does what few movie musicals ever have: near-total immersion in the (heightened) reality of the narrative. Strong production values (set designer Dante Ferretti already knew a thing or two about infernal urban slop of the 19th century with Gangs of New York) and top-notch casting of the leads—not to mention a memorably flamboyant turn from Cohen as a rival barber—make up for the occasional lull and a few too many unvaried throat slittings. In both their performances and the characters they play (equally insipid), Bower and Wisener’s would-be-lovers spoil the ghoulishly glorious fun almost every time they show up, but it’s a small price to pay for the opportunity to see Depp show more affection for shiny straight razors than for Carter’s aroused meat pie vendor downstairs. Per Sondheim, the only film version of his work that has his approval.\n\n81/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nCheck back in tomorrow for the next daily update!"
