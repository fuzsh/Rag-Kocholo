        "text": "The Salt of Life\n\n\n\nThe Story: A 60-something retiree with a distant wife goes looking for some outside companionship. The Lowdown: A genial, shambling little comedy about the pitfalls of aging and the realization that comes when you're simply not young anymore.\n\nThe Madness of King George\n\n\n\nIn Brief: Beautifully crafted, wittily written and cleverly directed film version of the play detailing the descent of Britain's King George III (you know, the one who lost the colonies) into insanity -- the things done to treat him and the plots hatched against him. A splendid cast pulls it all off with great aplomb.\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou?\n\n\n\nIn Brief: Taking the concept of the film that never gets made in Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels, the Coen Brothers then imagined it as a 1930s take on The Odyssey. The results? Possibly their best film -- certainly their most congenial one -- and already an established classic.\n\nCranky Hanke’s Weekly Reeler May 9-15: Monsieur Dark Shadows\n\nA singularly slack week is upon us — at least in terms of quantity. We’re only looking at one mainstream release and one art title. Of course, most the world is likely to be resting up after the headlong rush to shell out big bucks to see The Avengers last week. But the week’s two new offerings have something to be said for them.\n\nCronos\n\n\n\nIn Brief: Guillermo del Toro's first feature film, Cronos, is one of the more audacious debut works you're likely to find. It's a rethinking of the vampire film -- and unlike most rethinkings, this one really brings something new to the table. The film boasts all the horror tropes -- and adds some new ones…\n\nThe Avengers\n\n\n\nThe Story: When the Earth is threatened by a seemingly unstoppable enemy, Nick Fury calls The Avengers together to save the day. The Lowdown: It's big splashy entertainment that delivers on its promise more than it doesn't.\n\nMonsieur Lazhar\n\n\n\nThe Story: An Algerian immigrant in Montreal takes over a class of third graders when their teacher commits suicide. The Lowdown: This graceful, sometimes surprising variant on the often cloying \"teacher who makes a difference\" film is both clear-eyed and completely uncloying, and definitely worth a look.\n\nSullivan’s Travels\n\n\n\nIn Brief: This classic Preston Sturges comedy is about a popular movie director (Joel McCrea) who wants to make a serious movie called O Brother, Where Art Thou? When the studio points out to him that he has no clue what poverty is like, he agrees -- and sets out on the road to discover…\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\n\n\nIn Brief: Tim Burton's ultra-stylized and stylish -- not to mention bloody -- film version of the Stephen Sondheim musical about the infamous \"Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" is not likely to please theater purists or Sondheim junkies, but it is undeniably brilliant filmmaking that effectively blends theater, horror and music into a unified whole.\n\nEd Wood\n\n\n\nIn Brief: More or less true -- but more true in spirit than fact -- this is the story of bargain-basement, cross-dressing filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Johnny Depp), centering on his strange relationship with down-on-his-luck horror icon Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). A quirky, warm and loving tribute to one of cinema's most original characters.…\n\nLady Jane\n\n\n\nIn Brief: A solidly produced, (mostly) impressively cast and very long historical drama in the Masterpiece Theatre mold about the nine-day rule of England by the ill-starred Lady Jane Grey -- with a very thick coating of balderdash romance to make it more palatable. It will appeal to those who like this sort of thing…\n\nThe Raven\n\n\n\nThe Story: In the final days of his life, Edgar Allan Poe is called in to help solve a series of murders based on his stories. The Lowdown: Glossy, slick, utterly absurd thriller that pits Edgar Allan Poe against a serial killer. It's entertaining on its own merits -- well, mostly -- but definitely not…\n\nThe Deep Blue Sea\n\n\n\nThe Story: An adaption of Terence Rattigan's play about a woman who gives up her secure married life for a younger, more dashing man -- and the price all involved pay as a result. The Lowdown: Beautifully made and acted, with a deeply felt core of emotion. Easily one of the best films this year.\n\nThe Five-Year Engagement\n\n\n\nThe Story: An altar-bound couple's marriage keeps getting deferred by the intrusion of her career. The Lowdown: Unbearably overlong, not terribly funny, and banking way too much on the appeal of its stars.\n\nDamsels in Distress\n\n\n\nThe Story: A group of girls who are the self-appointed arbiters of good taste and mental health at an upscale university set out to change the world — or at least the school. The Lowdown: A delightfully quirky, intelligent and surprisingly warm-hearted small-scale comedy that some will likely find meandering and shapeless, while those in…\n\nPersepolis\n\n\n\nIn Brief: The very unusual and surpringly powerful Oscar-nominated animated biographical film about the extraordinary -- and yet perfectly relatable -- life of an Iranian girl. It's a film that should be seen -- and one that benefits from a second look, as well.\n\nJason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI\n\n\n\nIn Brief: The sixth (obviously) in the seemingly unstoppable (for a while anyway) Friday the 13th movies may not be exactly a good movie in the strict sense, but it's easily the best in the series. It delivers the expected slicing and dicing in something of a post-modern vein, but it also spoofs itself, the…\n\nCranky Hanke’s Weekly Reeler May 2-8: Avenger Damsels in Deep Blue Distress\n\nProbably only a mere handful of us care that anything other than The Avengers is opening this week — and those of us who care about those other things probably are pretty ambivalent about The Avengers. It evens out. But the fact remains that there indeed are other things, and some of them are mighty tasty.\n\nCranky Hanke’s Weekly Reeler April 24-May 1: Being Flynn with a Bike Footnote\n\nThis is a week of riches where the art titles are concerned. It’s not all that unusual that we get three art movies in one week. It is unusual when we get three of them I’d classify as being in the “must-see” realm. And it’s even more unusual when it happens in April. For that matter, there are also four other movies of the mainstream variety headed our way. Offhand, they seem likely to be shy of the “must-see” realm.\n\nFootnote\n\n\n\nThe Story: A phone call mistakenly notifies the wrong candidate that he's won the prestigious Israel Prize, plunging the world of Talmudic scholarship into a dilemma. The Lowdown: A brilliantly made, but exceedingly bitter film that does a fine job of skewering academia, but isn't going to be to every taste."
