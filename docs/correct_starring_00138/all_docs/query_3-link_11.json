        "text": "Jeffrey Jones -- best known for playing the principal in the movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" -- was charged Wednesday with a felony count of failing to update his sex offender registration last year.\n\nThe 63-year-old actor -- who is scheduled to be arraigned July 14 -- was required to register as a sex offender as a result of his no contest plea in July 2003 to a felony charge of employing a minor for purposes of taking sexually explicit photos.\n\nJones is accused of failing to register annually within five days of his birthday last Sept. 28, according to Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.\n\nHe was freed on $20,000 bail shortly after his June 23 arrest, according to sheriff's records.\n\nAlong with the sex offender registration, Jones also was ordered to serve five years probation and undergo sex offender counseling as a result of his July 8, 2003, no contest plea. A misdemeanor charge of possession or control of child pornography was dismissed.\n\nHis attorney said then that the actor was \"not accused of touching or having any physical contact with any minors whatsoever\" and that the case involved \"photographs.\"\n\nThe actor said after his 2003 sentencing that \"this concludes a really painful chapter in my life.\"\n\nLocal\n\nGet Los Angeles's latest local news on crime, entertainment, weather, schools, COVID, cost of living and more.
