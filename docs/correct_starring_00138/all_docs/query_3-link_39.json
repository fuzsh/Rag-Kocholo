        "text": "Tim Burton has created strange and wonderful worlds that children and adults alike can get lost in. Though Burton has directed a bit of everything, from Pee-wee's Big Adventure to Planet of the Apes to Dumbo, one common characteristic in Burton films is that the same actors - such as Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter, to name a few - show up again and again.\n\nHowever, a surprising number of these actors also have their dark side. While some scandals can be more easily forgotten, like Ryder's 2001 shoplifting incident, others are much more despicable. Below, we'll look at the controversies, allegations, and crimes of the most famous actors to appear in Tim Burton films."
