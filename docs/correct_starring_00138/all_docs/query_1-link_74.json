        "text": "In season 1, episode 6, titled âOur A-Story is a âDâ Storyâ, the main character, Bojack Horseman (voiced by Will Arnett) steals the âDâ from the Hollywood sign. As a result, native Angelenos subsequently refer to the area as âHollywooâ (since the âDâ from the sign is missing). The conclusion of the episode sees the âDâ accidentally destroyed in a helicopter crash near the Hollywoo Hills Super-Max prison.\n\nLos Angeles, 1949: A secret crew of police officers led by two determined sergeants work together in an effort to take down the ruthless mob king Mickey Cohen who runs the city.\n\nIn the first scene of the movie, it shows the Griffith Observatory then the camera zooms over to the Hollywoodland Sign.\n\nArgo is a 2012 American thriller film directed by Ben Affleck; it is a dramatization of the âCanadian Caperâ based on an article published in 2007, in which Tony Mendez, a CIA operative, led the rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.\n\nSet in 1987 Los Angeles, Drew and Sherrie are two young people chasing their dreams in the big city. When they meet, itâs love at first sight, though their romance will face a series of challenges.\n\nRockstar knocked it out of the park once again with this monster hit title, which frames its deeply detailed plotline within hyper-realistic Los Angeles settings drawn from historical 1940s photographs. As you might expect, the Hollywood Sign is a ubiquitous sight in the game and is seen in its original form, reading âHollywoodland.â\n\nâ¦Weâre going at it tonight tonight\n\nThereâs a party on the rooftop top of the world\n\nTonight tonight and weâre dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign\n\nI donât know if Iâll make it but watch how good Iâll fake it\n\nItâs all right, all right, tonight, tonightâ¦\n\nKaty Perryâs high sugar content video for âCalifornia Gurlsâ centers around Snoop Dogg playing a board game called âCandyfornia: Face the Sugar Daddyâs Dice to Free the Queens of Candyfornia,â in which Katy Perry is the game piece. The game board is a large 3-D super-confectionary trip through the landmarks and topography of California, including the Hollywood Sign rendered in delicious Red Vines atop three large ice cream hilltopsâ¦\n\nâ¦My heart goes boom as the stars go blue,Like a sea of cell phone lights,The moon gets light as the sun goes down,Somewhere behind the hollywood sign,Have you ever felt like your living in the shadows?Have you ever felt kept down?I know sometimes that it feels like a battle,But it can turn aroundâ¦\n\n20th Century Fox knows that nothing says âshowbizâ like the Hollywood Sign, which is why the world-famous icon is now being used to open all of the studioâs releases â¦ Looks like weâll be seeing even more of the Hollywood Sign at the movies in the very near future!\n\nâ\n\nNo movie about star struck teens going to Hollywood would be complete without a mandatory shot of the Sign, and this popular Disney Channel Original Movie is no exception. The landmark also figures large in the promotional Bus Tour mini-films made for the film, as the filmâs stars are taken on a special tour of glamorous Hollywood sights.\n\nThe Sign plays a part in the opening credits as Victoria Justice sings. Look for the Sign several times in the background and near the âHollywood Artsâ performing arts high school. You can also see the Sign in several quick edits between scenes in the show.\n\nThe opening credit sequence for this ill-fated late night variety show, which depicted a whirlwind tour of the most important landmarks of Los Angeles, included a nighttime tracking camera shot of the Sign from behind silhouetted against the LA skyline.\n\nâ¦I hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and my cardiganWelcome to the land of fame, excess, whoa am I gotta fit in?Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first timeLook to my right, and I see the Hollywood signâ¦\n\nA young man awakens from a four-year coma to hear that his once pure high-school sweetheart has since become a pinup star. He and his girl-crazed best friend decide to take a cross-country road trip to crash a party at the Playboy mansion and win back the girl. The Hollywood Sign has a cameo as the guys near L.A. and are about to pull up to the mansion.\n\nA teenager discovers heâs the descendant of a Greek god and sets out on an adventure to settle an on-going battle between the gods. The Sign appears towards the end, as the gate to Hades!\n\nIn this 2009 TV miniseries, an enterprising young woman navigates the professional waters of Beverly Hills in order to land the hottest producer in town, fully unaware that she is about to get in way over her head.\n\nThe Hollywood Sign can be seen at the end.\n\nAnother thrilling game from Rockstar, allowing players to buy the hottest cars and race them through hyper-realistic Los Angeles settings, complete with traffic, weather, and the police. The Hollywood Sign is seen in all its glory in the game, as well as on the packaging, letting players know exactly where they are as they drive.\n\nâ¦Iâm gonna lose my mindGet 30 inch spinners and pimp my rideGo back in time, be there that night and save 2 Pacâs lifeThen pay my fine for getting caught f***ing on the Hollywood signI got the game on lockIâll have a bottle and a glockwith biceps like The RockBuy Tomâs soul back from Rupert Murdochâ¦\n\nThis latest version of a venerable television franchise includes many passing references to the Sign, and the cast uses the Sign as a backdrop for a documentary film they are shooting. In addition, Season 3 sees one character (Jasper) throwing himself off the âHâ and narrowly escaping death.\n\nBolt arrives in Hollywood and takes in a gorgeous view of the whole city with the Sign prominently in the background. While he stands there, two aspiring Hollywood writer pigeons approach Bolt to pitch a bird-brained script idea for his next movie.\n\nNear the end of the movie, where Carl is jogging with Allison and her yoga/jogging/photography group at the Griffith Park Observatory, the Hollywood Sign can be seen setting the stage in the background.\n\nIn the 2007 seasonâs fourth episode, titled âThe Kindness Of Strangers,â Claire and a date fly over to the Hollywood Sign at night and sit on top of the letter âH.â Â Claire purposefully falls off the âHâ to test and see if her date will swoop in and rescue her (he does, thankfully).\n\nâ¦Till the next time that we meet at the top of the Hollywood Sign. Donât leave me next to the pool bar where Iâm all alone with the conscience of fate. Iâll choose my favorite beverage and vomit it up on the chest of my date. The names Baby, and in the spot light Iâm a real lady but when the cameras off, I die slowly. Iâve got Entourage but they don't know me. Cuz Iâm the ghost of the Hollywood Signâ¦\n\nA man decides to donate part of his liver to save his sonâs life. They travel to California for the surgery. On the night before the operation, his wife takes pictures of the man and his son in front of the Hollywood Sign.\n\nThe Sign, which at the time of the filmâs setting (1940) still read HOLLYWOODLAND, was near the site of the grisly Black Dahlia murder. Itâs shown, accurately, with the âHâ damaged, as it would have been before the Chamber of Commerceâs 1949 refurbishment.\n\nâ\n\nThe opening credit sequence of this long-running behind-the-scenes look at Hefnerâs famous Mansion includes a shot of the Sign. The Sign is also shown repeatedly in several episodes, including one where the girls ride horseback to the Sign.\n\nThe Sign appears repeatedly in this Friends spin-off, usually during scene switches. Joey makes reference to the Sign in the first episode, where he comments that from his apartment he can see the âOllywooâ sign â since his window has no view of the H or the D.\n\nThis game is set in a seedy fictional city called Los Santos, which takes the seedier side of Los Angeles to the extreme. Thankfully, the real Los Angeles is no where near as exciting as this game! High on a hillside overlooking the city, there is a sign modeled on the Hollywood Sign, reading âVinewood.â Fantasy or not, the game designers obviously felt that even a fictional Los Angeles would look incomplete without a fictional Sign looming over it.\n\nThis emmy-nominated TV movie depicts what would happen to Los Angeles in the event of a 10.5 earthquake. Given the magnitude of the quake, the damage isnât that bad: Only one of the Ls and a W go toppling over the hillside this time. Heck, the Sign probably looked worse circa 1976.\n\nAt the end of season 4, main characters Dr. Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) and Dr. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) sell their successful, Miami plastic surgery business and relocate to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.\n\nThe Hollywood Sign is shown in a most spectacular fashion, with great aerial shots of both it and a couple of far-away shots of the city below. The two doctors are shown simply hanging around the Sign. All this is set to Kool & the Gangâs âHollywood Swinginâ.â\n\nThe Bachelorette is a spin-off from the American competitive reality dating game show The Bachelor. In the 9th season, they had a dinner date sitting on top of the âLâ in Hollywood.\n\nOnce again, the Sign sets the scene. At the very start of the movie, we hear a police radio requesting S.W.A.T. assistance, and the camera flies over the Sign into downtown Los Angeles to show a thrilling bank robbery taking place.\n\nThis Hollywood-themed heist film has three washed up actors trying to steal $10,000,000 using their acting skills. In addition to the movie title, the film begins with a cool tracking shot of the Sign as a car with a trunk full of smuggled cocaine rolls past into Los Angeles.\n\nThe main plot of the movie is in Hollywood and the sign appears at the very beginning of the movie right before the scene with Cotton weary in his car.\n\nIn âThatâs Lobstertainmentâ (Episode #3, Season #8), the Planet Express crew flies to Hollywood to revive the career of Dr. Zoidbergâs formerly famous comedian uncle Harold Zoid. The Sign still stands proudly over LA, but the Capitol Records building seems to have been repurposed as a âSwap Meet.â\n\nThe video begins with singer Joshua Todd sitting on a perch and when the camera pans around, heâs seated in the crook of an âLâ. Â Then the band is set up and playing the song in front of the sign. At the second chorus, the sign bursts into flames and the band plays on, as ashes fall onto a star-studded (Tara Reid) movie premiere.\n\nIt is a helicopter shot from behind the sign on Mt. Lee and the camera nearly passes through. The purpose of the shot is to establish the all-powerful presence of Hollywood as an industry, a place where anything can happen.\n\nâ\n\nThe Sign (again depicted in its original Hollywoodland incarnation) serves as the perfect backdrop for this film about Orson Welleâs struggle to make Citizen Kane. The film is accurate in that the LAND portion of the Sign, which wasnât scrapped until 1949, would have been standing during the time of Citizen Kaneâs filming (1940-41). Still, the Sign would have looked much worse for wear than it appears here.\n\nWhen Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny see the R-rated Canadian movie âTerrance & Phillip: Asses of Fireâ, they are pronounced âcorruptedâ. Kyleâs mom Sheila, with the rest of the parents, pressure the United States to wage war against Canada. The Sign is used as a backdrop when the Canadian Air Forces bomb the Baldwin brothersâ mansion. (Alec, Stephen, etc.).\n\nA cult classic racing game that allowed players to test their driving skills on challenging tracks based on famous USA locations, including Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Hawaii, and more. The Hollywood Sign features prominently in the Los Angeles track portion, as well as on the packaging.\n\nThe film is about a man who discovers that what he thought was his life is, in fact, a TV show. His existential crisis is punctuated by a shot revealing that his hometown (Seahaven) is actually a set built inside of an enormous dome â¦ located just north of the Hollywood Sign.\n\nRemarkably, the Sign is spared. It is, however, the compositional centerpiece of a shot featuring a tower (in the foreground) thatâs knocked over to dam a river of molten lava.\n\nâ¦He said do you know where Carson lives\n\nSo we drove up to Malibu\n\nCruisinâ down Sunset Strip\n\nI let him steal a kiss or two\n\nUnder the Hollywood sign\n\nI tried to hide a smile as I whispered low\n\nI wanna be the first to tell you\n\nHere we say Rodel, not rodeoâ¦\n\nFrom our contributor: Protagonist Flynt gets told âThereâs only one place for your kind . . . â (or something like that), then the film cuts to a helicopter shot that circles the Hollywood sign! When I saw it in NYC, the audience roared and applauded! The camera pans back as the helicopter circles around to show the Flynt Building on Wilshire Blvd. in the same shot. (Director Milos Forman won the Golden Globe for this movie.)\n\nAs the aliens are introduced to us by the director he gives us a great shot of the Hollywood sign to make sure that we know where the alien invasion is taking place. (Contributed by Angel Frost)\n\nThis barbed satire of L.A. (and, in turn, American) pop culture features a shot of the Sign with the Hollywood hills on fire in the background âa poignant image of just how badly things have gone in Los Angelesâ future as imagined by Carpenter.\n\nThe Sign is featured during the first and final shots of the film as part of a wide-angle pan. The purposefully artificial-looking, miniaturized depiction of Hollywood serves as the perfect introduction to Woodâs world.\n\nThereâs a hilarious scene in which Robin Hood arrives at the coast of England. How do we know? A giant Hollywood Sign-style sign spells out ENGLAND on the distant hillside. It was the Signâs first comedic role â¦ but not its last.\n\nThe movie features a great scene where Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. ride horses up to the sign (Fairbanks even takes a leak on the sign) and discuss the rising tide of Americanism sweeping the country as Fairbanks proceeds to climb the sign and even performs some gymnastics on one of the letters as the camera pulls back to reveal the entire âHollywoodlandâ sign. (Contributed by Leslie A. Turner)\n\nThe film offers the other alternate explanation for the loss of the LAND portion of the Sign: Villain Neville Sinclair (Dalton) crashes into them with a faulty rocketpack. Whatever else she achieves during her career, Jennifer Connelly will almost certainly go down in history as the only actor/actress to star alongside the Sign in two films in the same year.\n\nDepicted in its original âHollywoodlandâ form, the Sign is used to efficiently communicate place (Los Angeles) and time (relatively early in the 20th century) during an establishing scene in the film.\n\nThere is a framed picture in The Peach Pit of the sign reading âHollywoodland.â (Contributed by Meredith Gardner)\n\nThe Sign also appears in the final episode of the 92-93 season, which is a graduation episode. In the opening scene, the gang is gathered at a viewpoint of the Sign. At the end of the show, we see a banner created by the gang hanging over the Sign that reads âW BEV HIâ 93.â All created with Hollywood magic, of course!\n\nWill Smith was still primarily a rap star when he was first featured in this hugely popular Hollywood fish-out-of-water series. The showâs rap intro featured Will Smith hailing a funky taxi upon his arrival in Bel Air, which he enters right below the Sign. The cab driver seen in the credits is actually Quincy Jones, executive producer of the show.\n\nBelinda Carlyle wasnât the only former member of the Go-Gos who went on to a successful solo career. Punk guitarist Jane Wiedlan, who penned their hit âOur Lips Are Sealed,â released 4 solo albums of her own with some respectable chart success. Her last charting single âWorld on Fireâ was accompanied by a steamy video filled with pyrotechnics as her music and attitude literally burned up the screen. Shot in many Hollywood locations, the Sign is seen in the backdrop in several spots and then bursts into flames as a finale.\n\nIn this made-for-TV remake of 1974âs EARTHQUAKE, the Hollywood Sign comes crumbling down letter by letter as one of many victims of a huge quake.\n\nThe movie opens with a helicopter shot that comes up the back side of the Hollywood Hills meant to recall the jungle setting of the first movie. Then the helicopter flies over the hills to reveal the city of L.A. in the distance, and the Hollywood sign."
