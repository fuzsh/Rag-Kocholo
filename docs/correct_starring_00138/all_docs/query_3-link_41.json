        "text": "When it comes to style, few filmmakers are in the same class as Tim Burton. Unfortunately, Burton's films have far too often lacked the substance to go with it. Even solid novels (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) have made for underwhelming adaptations in Burton's hands.\n\nTechnically innovative and tremendously successful commercially, but underwhelming nonetheless.\n\nThere have been a few films, however, that Burton has gotten just right, yielding more than just visually interesting diversion. Big Fish and Sweeney Todd come to mind. I would need to revisit it, but Edward Scissorhands might qualify. In these ranks I would also include Ed Wood.\n\nBurton's first time in the director's chair since helming his second of two turn-of-the-'90s Batman movies, Ed Wood dialed down commercial expectations while seemingly cranking up its maker's passion for the subject matter. It's not as if Gotham City didn't have Burton's full attention and vision, especially the imprint-bearing Batman Returns. But one gets the impression that Burton cares a lot more about Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi than the Penguin and Catwoman.\n\nAs you should know, Edward D. Wood, Jr. was a writer, director, and producer of B movies beginning in the 1950s. That he is remembered and most of his contemporaries forgotten indicates that Wood was no ordinary filmmaker. But the reason that Wood remains renowned and is immortalized by Burton here is because he is considered perhaps the worst filmmaker who ever lived. His amateurish movies included infamous attempts at horror (Bride of the Monster) and science fiction (Plan 9 from Outer Space). People like Wood are the reason that \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" existed and flourished (three of his movies were skewered on that cable institution). His films are of the so bad they're good variety. The cheap, hasty works invite derision and there is much ironic amusement to be had on account of that.\n\nThe third screenplay by Problem Child and Problem Child 2 scribes Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, Ed Wood both fits and defies the biopic mold. Its subject is clearly unworthy of conventional hero worship and yet the movie possesses respect and admiration for Wood's gung-ho spirit and can-do attitude.\n\nIn his second of eight (and counting!) turns for Burton, Johnny Depp portrays Wood, a longtime occasional transvestite with a taste for angora sweaters whose predilections became the basis of the 1953 exploitation flick Glen or Glenda, his feature-length debut. Revealing the secret fetish puts a strain on his genuine relationship with girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), his go-to leading lady on stage and screen.\n\nWood works quickly, cheaply, and with the help of a small, loyal, supportive crew, including showy sham prognosticator Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) and gender-conflicted friend Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), whom he often assigns acting roles. Despite those assets, the director meets resistance even from schlock-churning studios and even after he meets and befriends aging former movie star Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). Broke, unemployable, recently separated, and addicted to morphine, Lugosi agrees to any work that Wood will send his way. The director's troupe expands to include monstrous Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (WWE Hall of Fame inductee George \"The Animal\" Steele) and television's horror movie hostess Vampira (Lisa Marie), both found by fortuity.\n\nWhen Wood decides to go independent, he courts potential financiers much less versed in the business and even they have their reservations. But Wood will take funding anywhere he can get it, as he boasts that he can make a movie for $60,000 that others would spend a million on. The fast shoots are chaotic and their fruits are not really appreciated by anyone. Still, Wood keeps plugging away, hoping to make the film for which he will be remembered, the equivalent of his hero Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.\n\nBurton's film is an affectionate send-up of his genre-treading forebear.\n\nEd Wood does not emphasize the fact that it is a true story, but most of its ludicrous claims do check out. You will discover as much after this entertaining romp inspires you to see Glen, Bride, and Plan 9, the three films whose productions it details.\n\nBurton proves to be a perfect fit for the material. Rather than warping it to fit his signature moody style, he honors the subject by fully embracing it with a black & white look resembling '50s cinema (without the technical kinks and limits). Miniature scale models, flimsy sets, and cheap props come to life with authenticity and awe. Instead of Burton's regular composer Danny Elfman supplying his usual wonderment, Howard Shore is hired for a delectable throwback score.\n\nThe technical elements of a Burton film are rarely a concern. But here, they're attached to a fine and funny script by Alexander and Karaszewski. The writers could have made this a pure farce, laughing at Wood's artistic futility. And to a degree, they do just that. However, they also imbue this with humanity, portraying the director as a decent, well-meaning optimist whose enthusiasm and speed greatly exceed his creativity and talent.\n\nBeetlejuice put Burton on Hollywood's map and landed him the chance to redefine the superhero movie to record numbers. Ed Wood not only extended Burton's streak of representation in the technical categories of the Academy Awards by winning Best Makeup, it also got recognized in a more major way, with Martin Landau's exquisite Lugosi impression netting him Best Supporting Actor, the first (and still only) Oscar of his long, distinguished career."
