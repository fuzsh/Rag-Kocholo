        "text": "Will Jeffrey Jones appear in Tim Burtonâs hugely anticipated Beetlejuice sequel, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice?\n\nThatâs the question on the mind of eagle-eyed fans of the upcoming Warner Bros. filmâs trailer, who noticed a glimpse of the actor on a headstone in a funeral scene. But a rep for Jones confirms to The Hollywood Reporter that the actor does not appear in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\n\nThe funeral is attended by Catherine OâHara (playing Delia Deetz, second wife of Jonesâ Charles Deetz in the original film), Winona Ryder (Lydia Deetz, Charlesâ daughter with his first, deceased wife) and Jenna Ortega (a newcomer to the franchise, who plays Astrid Deetz, Lydiaâs teenage daughter).\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIn Beetlejuice, Charles is a big-city real estate developer who buys a Connecticut home after the previous owners â the Maitlands, played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis â die in a car accident.\n\nThe Maitlands soon learn they are ghosts and watch in horror as Delia proceeds to turn their quaint farmhouse into a gaudy, postmodern funhouse.\n\nCharlesâ death in the sequel did not necessarily rule out his participation in the sequel, as the film follows the Maitlandsâ misadventures of the afterlife.\n\nA gifted physical comedian, Jones, 77, stole scenes in a string of films throughout the 1980s, most notably playing Emperor Joseph II in 1984âs Amadeus and Ed Rooney, the principal in 1986âs Ferris Buellerâs Day Off. Working with Burton, he followed Beetlejuice with performances in 1994âs Ed Wood and 1999âs Sleepy Hollow.\n\nHe worked far less in the years following a 2003 plea of no contest to hiring a 14-year-old boy to pose naked for photos, for which he was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to register as a sex offender.\n\nBut Jones did play real-life newspaperman A.W. Merrick on HBOâs Deadwood throughout the showâs run from 2004 to 2006. He reprised the role for Deadwood: The Movie in 2019 â but amid a more sensitive, post-#MeToo climate, his presence in the narrative was greatly reduced.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKuxxZ%2BpnrFdn7yvsdJmpaisXZ67bq7EnqulnZqqtqSxjK2pmqGcmr9ufZFsbHFtaGh%2Fdns%3D"
