        "text": "A complete list of all Oscar-winning movies, with all the films that ever won and the number of Academy Awards that each of the winners took home. If a movie is on this list, then rest-assured, it is one of the best films ever made. Every year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes Hollywood filmmakers for various achievements within the industry. Some years, a small handful of highly-recognized films sweep a majority of the awards—think Titanic and The English Patient—but other years, the awards are spread out and several films win one or two Oscars in various categories. The number of Oscars that any given film wins has to do with how good the film is, but can also be determined by luck, release date, the mood of the Academy members, and the quality of the other films that were released that year.\n\nThis list of Academy Award winning movies is ordered by the number of statues each of these films brought home, so you can easily glance and see which films have won the most awards. It also lists the awards each film won and highlights those awards which are most coveted, the so-called Big Five Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay. Only three movies in history have won all of the Big Five Academy Awards. These films are The Silence of the Lambs (1991), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), and It Happened One Night (1931). Based on their successes, these films should be at the top at any film buff's must-see list.\n\nTo many, the Academy Award, also known as the Oscar, is considered the most prestigious award in Hollywood. The awards are given to individuals for their various roles within the production of their films. Somebody involved in all the films listed won an Oscar. For people who worked on these award-winning movies, the recognition is a career changer, and for a movie it can mean a surge in additional profits at the box office."
