        "text": "Ed Wood\n\n(1994)\n\nSynopsis\n\nHomage to 1950s schlock director Edward D. Wood Jr., focusing on his friendship with Bela Lugosi. Wood was a surreal character: self-deluded, eternally optimisticâ€”and a heterosexual who enjoyed wearing women's clothing. He's become a cult icon thanks to the unintended humor of his schlock classics \"Glen or Glenda?\" (1952) and \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1959)."
