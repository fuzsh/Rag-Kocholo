The mysterious. The unexplainable. That is why you are here. And now, for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened, on that fateful day. We are giving you all the evidence, based only on a secret testimony, of the miserable souls, who survived this terrifying ordeal. The incidents, the places. My friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer. Can your heart stand the shocking facts about Edward D. Wood Jr.?\n\nThis film is a close masterpiece about the story of an incredible director. A man that made such Turkey films that his films became analysed and evaluated into exactly what went on in the mind of Ed Wood. I love firstly how it is shot in Black & White. It gives that nostalgia classic hollywood look around the film. The Direction by Tim Burton is great. Burton knows how to shoot good stories and Ed Wood is a well shot film.\n\nAs for Performances, Johnny Depp gave a top notch performance as Ed Wood. He could literally be the spitting image of the actual man because his performance is so convincing. Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi is a great emotional performance about the actor`s final years and his close relationship with Ed Wood. Jeffrey Jones as Criswell is an excellent performance with such mystery and compassion. One more role i`ll mention is the role of Bunny played by Bill Murray. Billy Murray is one of those talents that can do almost anything if he puts his mind to it. and in Ed Wood he does.\n\nI would love to see some of Ed Wood`s films but they are very tricky to find. I would love to see Bride Of The Monster and Glen or Glenda just to get a glimpse of what was going on inside Ed Wood`s mind at the time.\n\nOverall Ed Wood is a fantastic biopic and one of the best you will ever see. SEE IT. ITS A MUST SEE.\n\nRating - 94% - A"
