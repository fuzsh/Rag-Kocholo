        "text": "Hollywood can be a very cruel place. It seldom gives second chances once you falter. But these celebs were lucky enough to grab it and get out. Some of them are trying to do better. Some of them are back to their ways. These celebs did bounce back. But at what cost?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Biggs\n\nThe star of the American Pie series had Hollywood on his fingertips. He had it all. Fame, wealth, and clout – all in equal proportions. But that was never going to last. The actor found work in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie and Orange is the New Black series in the 2010s. The former was going to propel him into international stardom until his past social media posts came to light and his entire world came crashing down.\n\nBiggs ‘hilarious’ tweet on the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 did not go down well with the fans. The tweet was found to be offensive and Biggs lost any major projects. After getting out of the stigma of being the Hollywood Pariah, Biggs is finding work in hit shows like Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\n\nAzealia Banks\n\nRapper and singer Azealia Banks lives and thrives on controversies. Her outspoken views on politics and race have attracted scores of haters. But sometimes, despite the respect she gets for being a woman who doesn’t hold back, she does cross the line. And when she does, it is worth face-palming.\n\nIn May 2016, Azealia Banks called One Director star Zayn Malik a “Curry scented n***a”. That did not bode well with Zayn Malik, who went on record to state that he found the remark offensive. Fans also called her homophobic for that retort. Her social media antics led her UK booking agency to drop her from their client lists. Azealia Banks is still just as outspoken and popular. But now she stays away from stuff that can get her into real trouble.\n\nFun Fact: Banks calls Vladimir Putin her “Favorite supervillain’. Whatever that means…\n\nJeffrey Jones\n\nBack in the ’80s and ’90s, Jeffrey Jones was a household phenomenon. He was the most sought after actors in the big screen entertainment business. You may have seen him in movies like Ed Wood, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, and Amadeus. But little did we know, Jeffrey Jones was hiding a deep and dark secret. In 2003, a lawsuit was filed against the actor for soliciting a minor boy to pose for nude pictures. What was even more surupsing was that Jeffrey Jones pleaded no contest in that case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Jeffrey Jones is now listed in USA’s Sex Offender database, Jones is trying to make amends to his career. His role in 63 Trillion, a theater production, received massive praise. He has also starred in movies like Who’s Your Caddy? and 10.0 earthquake.\n\nVanessa Hudgens\n\nEver wonder why Disney child stars like Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Zendaya made it big while Vanessa Hudgens, who is so, so talented, is still struggling to bag major blockbusters? It is because of her social media antics. Vanessa Hudgens angered the whole world when she went live on her social media channel and made insensitive remarks about the global pandemic.\n\nIn her Instagram stories, Hudgens claims that everyone is going to get the disease anyway and that death was inevitable. So according to her logic, we should just all go about our merry way while a global pandemic decimates humanity. Hudgens has shown signs of remorse, and is now trying to make a comeback with projects like Downtown Owl and Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas.\n\nJames Franco\n\nFranco had been reportedly dealing with cases of sexual misconduct for a long time before those cases could no longer be swept under the run and were forced to come out. The final nail in the coffin that would be his career came in the year 2018. When he was one of the actors roped in for Time’s Up movement, a campaign for #MeToo awareness, multiple women came forward to claim sexual impropriety.\n\nFranco denied all allegations but the die had already been cast. Franco lost many major Hollywood projects and was kicked out of many more in pre-production. He returned to the world of acting with HBO’s The Deuce. He also starred in The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, one of Netflix’s most critically acclaimed movies."
