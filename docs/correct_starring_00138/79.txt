Actor Jeffrey Jones — who’s best known for playing the principal in the movie “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” — pleaded guilty today to a charge that he failed to update his sex offender registration last year.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Horwitz ordered Jones to serve three years on probation and do 250 hours of Caltrans service, according to Jane Robison of the District Attorney’s Office.

The actor, who turned 64 today, was required to register as a sex offender as a result of his no contest plea in July 2003 to a felony charge of employing a minor for purposes of taking sexually explicit photos. Prosecutors alleged that Jones failed to register annually within five days of his birthday last year.

Along with the sex offender registration, Jones also was ordered to serve five years on probation and to undergo sex offender counseling as a result of his July 8, 2003, no contest plea. A misdemeanor charge of possession or control of child pornography against him was dismissed.

His attorney said then that the actor was “not accused of touching or having any physical contact with any minors whatsoever” and that the case involved “photographs.”

The actor said after his 2003 sentencing that “this concludes a really painful chapter in my life.”

“I’m sorry that this incident was allowed to occur. Such an event has never happened before and it will never happen again,” Jones told reporters then.

Jones has more than 60 television and movie credits, including his role as hapless Principal Ed Rooney in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” Criswell in “Ed Wood” and the father in “Beetlejuice.”
