        "text": "\"When All Was Dark\", 1910\n\n\"The eyes, so long blind, opened to the light. It was a grim joke that nature played on this man to whom the light had failed, that the first sight should reveal his wife in the arms of his \"friend.\" And now the husband heard that so long as he remained blind, she would not desert him -- but should his sight be recovered she would then join her illicit love. \"\n\nSnare of Society, Lubin Studio, One Sheet, 1911.\n\nThe contribution of graphic design in transmission of information in this early 20th century movie poster is at minimum. The image is basically a classic representation of two characters in a balanced composition in which the enigmatic color pallet plays the most crucial role. The function of the simple black typeface at the top of the poster is just to provide a title for the film, and there is no attempt by the illustrator to integrate and engage the typography with the overall design. Nevertheless, the pure conventionality of the design renders it somewhat agreeable to a modern taste. The main character, Florence Lawrence, originally became known as the \"Biograph Girl\" and worked at that studio under the direction of D.W. Griffith. She left Biograph in 1909 to join Carl Laemmle, who had just started Independent Motion Picture Company, or IMP in New York. She and her husband, Harry Solter were IMP's first featured players.\n\nREVIEW, The New York Dramatic Mirror, May 20, 1914:\n\n\"To see ourselves as others see us is often-times for our own good. To see others as the directors see them is often misleading. The worst that has happened in this picture of life in Egypt is that the girl sells apples, oranges, and pineapples in the marketplace. We doubt very much whether in any season of the year this combination of fruit is sold in Egypt. It may seem at first that this is overcaptious on our part, yet where we saw the picture it excited considerable comment. The play is the next in the Diplomatic Free Lance series. Acquaintance is necessary with the characters as they have occurred in the previous installments. Not only that, but there is a good deal of doubt as to the action as the play proceeds. The faces of a good many are swarthy, and add to this the further confusing fact that some Caucasians make themselves up as Egyptians, and the very closest of attention is required. In the main, the story runs along in an interesting vein, until finally the girl is imprisoned in the rooms of the Sheik. Then the offering overflows with excitement and holds it so until the end.\n\n\"The conspiracy consists of the fact that the Mohammedans have discovered a deadly germ. Lord Trevor has been sent to Egypt by his government to investigate the nature of the conspiracy which his government has heard is being planned, but of which no details can be obtained. Months of work have not forwarded his task much, and he is now at his wits' end, for the natives by now know him and his mission. His intrepid ward volunteers for the work, and, disguised, sells fruit at a stand in the marketplace. The Sheik arouses her suspicions and she follows him to his laboratory, where he instructs the faithful in the use of a new deadly germ to be put in the water and food of the English. He suspects the girl and attacks her after the meeting when the others have left. Selim [sic; other accounts say Abdul], the servant, comes to her rescue, and after killing the Sheik, helps her to destroy the fatal germs.\"\n\nThe Illiterate Digest, Goldwyn, 1920, One Sheet.\n\nIn this poster the graphic design and the typography are integrated fully. The signature of Will rogers and a colloquial quot \"It's A Dog Gone Good Novelty. See It Every Week\" adds a touch of intimacy. The character and his cowboy lasso are drawn extending beyond the black canvas at the center. Will Rogers began his entertainment career in vaudeville, charming audiences with his down home comedy and iconic American cowboy appeal. His popularity in the Ziegfeld variety review Midnight Frolic lead to his engagement with the more famous Ziegfeld Follies. By 1918, Hollywood and Goldwyn came knocking, allowing Rogers to branch out into silent films. Until his contract ended in 1921, Rogers completed twelve movies for Goldwyn, and during the same period he also made the Illiterate Digest film-strip series for the Gaumont Film Company. Although not this stage performers strongest medium, Rogers would go on to make 48 successful silent films, and with the arrival of sound in 1929, he would become a leading star in that medium.\n\nThis expressionist poster by Heinz Schulz-Neudamm for Metropolis (1926) has became rather famous after the Reel Poster Gallery brokered the sale of a copy of it for a staggering $690,000, in 2005. The high price has led some to believe that it was a testament to its artistic merits! In 2012, the poster was repurchased by a New Jersey film memorabilia collector, Ralph DeLuca, as part of a lot in a Los Angeles bankruptcy court for $1.2 million.\n\nMade in Germany during the Weimar Period, Metropolis is set in the year 2026 in a dystopian society in which a wealthy elite rules from vast tower complexes, oppressing the workers who live in the depths below. Schulz-Neudamm's illustrates the female Robot of the story, created by a mad scientist to seduce workers in the futuristic urban city. The silent film was written by Fritz Lang and his wife Thea Von Harbou, and starred Brigitte Helm, Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel and Rudolf Klein-Rogge. Fritz Lang used the evil protagonist character in Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (1922), to express his view about the phenomenon at the time. “Expressionism ” Dr. Mabuse scoffs is “ just a game. Everything is a game nowadays.” This cynicism is part of the Expressionist design of Schulz-Neudamm for this poster.\n\nGold Diggers of 1933, 1933, Mervyn LeRoy.The choreographer Busby Berkeley and Director Le Roy innovations in this musical was truly groundbreaking. They used the \"stage musical\" as a vast arena for their artistic self-expression using camera work and cinematography which played a key role in the dance sequences. The camera itself danced among the bevy of girls in their scanty costumes, giving the viewers a point of view it had never seen before. By creating the image of two overlapping posters, the graphic designer of this poster appears to transfer the scene from th musical into the world of the viewer. Winter Carnival, 1939, Charles Reisner, United Artists. In this poster the artist uses multiple view points in conjunction with a clever use of typography and a color scheme that minimizes the cluttering effect of the text. The cold blue of the background provides a wintry feel for the onetime Snow Queen at the carnival, Ann Sheridan, in this her first really big movie since she became known as the \"Oomph\" girl. Because the film was produced by one of Hollywood’s first independent producers, Walter Wanger, the design of the poster appears to be less conventional for the era. This is the poster for the re-issue of Gone with the Wind, by Howard Terpning, showing Rhett Butler sweeping Scarlett O‘Hara off her feet and carries her up over the declining fortunes of the Southern Confederacy after the fall of the city of Atlanta. The image on this poster was not drawn from the film footage; rather, it was created independently by still photographers and artists before or during production of the film. (With Many thanks to poster artist Steve Chorney, Who provided me with the original poster from the 1940s of Gone with the wind and the information about its re-issue) Out of the Fog, 1941, Anatole Litvak. This is another film noir poster, in which the bold and somewhat sensual typeface for the movie title, and its placement help to define the role of Ida Lupino as the femme fatale of the movie. Adopted from the play The Gentle People by Irwin Shaw, this dark drama was ahead of its time, but ended much differently from the stage version. Shaw's more pessimistic play makes a symbolic plea against fascism and calls for a united front in Europe. The film-script was changed and a more hopeful ending added, where the bad guy, unlike the stage version, gets punished. Going My Way, 1944, Leo McCarey. The multiple view points illustration together with various typefaces are used smartly to create an agreeable poster for this musical movie. The towering image of Father O'Malley at the center aptly represents the main portrayal of him in the movie that as one critic argued \"seems like a character generated by a marketing arm of the Catholic Church. He's too good to be true - a trait that sinks the character and the movie along with it.\" Born to Kill, 1947, Robert Wise. Based on the book \"Deadlier Than Male\", which Wise stumbled upon in the RKO story files, the story of a twisted woman's attraction for a psychopathic murderer provoked the criticism from the Production Code that said this is \"the kind of story which ought not to be made because it is a story of gross lust and shocking brutality, and ruthlessness.\" The poster however tries to remain within the conventional parameters a film noir. The Misfits, 1961, John Huston. This exquisite black and white poster, depicts the main idea of The Misfits, the final film for both Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable, which tells the story of three misfits lusting after Roslyn Tabor a dancer who descends upon Reno to be divorced. In a series of misfitted rectangular images that even dislocate the typography of the film, the poster depicts various scenes from the movie that has its origins in a short story that Arthur Miller had written for Esquire magazine. A Man For All Seasons, 1966, : Fred Zinnemann. The poster depicts the character of Thomas More from the behind in silhouette, and it is left to the viewer to imagine the character of this pious Catholic, who could not in good conscience serve as the Lord Chancellor of England for King Henry VIII after the King announced his plan to end his marriage to Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn, and thus gave up his high office and eventually his life. The outstanding typography in yellow against the black background create a superb focus for this delicately balanced composition."
