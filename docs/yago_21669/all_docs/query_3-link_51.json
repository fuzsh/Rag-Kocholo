        "text": "Hotchka Movies by the Decade feature #126 :: December 21•27\n\nWith the studios releasing their heaviest hitters ahead of the awards consideration deadline, and the week after Christmas a virtual dead zone, this week across the last nine decades — there were no releases in 1922 — is full of films that were popular, earned awards and nominations, and have become classics selected for preservation. One interesting bit to notice about 1932 and 1942 are the horror movies that were released, with two in ’32 and one in ’42. There were also several high seas swashbucklers this week, and a number of literary adaptations including one from Charles Dickens that isn’t A Christmas Carol. In fact you’d be hard-pressed to find more than one holiday-specific film released this week, and that one didn’t even make it to the US until February. Several big names were making their debuts this week or appearing in uncredited roles pre-stardom. And one film this week even caused one of its stars to quit acting for five years. Want to learn more? Read on and tell us in the comments section below if any of your favorites are celebrating this week.\n\n1922\n\nNo new movies were released this week in 1922.\n\n1932\n\nDecember 22 – F.P.1 antwortet nicht (Germany)\n\nGerman Cast: Hans Albers, Sybille Schmitz, Paul Hartmann, Peter Lorre, Hermann Speelmans, Erik Ode, Werner Schott, Gustav Püttjer, Georg John\n\nFrench Cast: Charles Boyer, Danièle Parola, Jean Murat, Marcel Vallée, Pierre Piérade\n\nEnglish-Language Cast: Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton, Donald Calthrop, George Merritt, William Freshman, Nicholas Hannen\n\nDirector: Karl Hartl\n\nProduction Company: Gaumont British Picture Corporation, Les Productions Fox Europa, Universum Film (UFA), distributed by UFA (Germany), Gaumont British Distributors (UK), Fox Film Corporation (US)\n\nTrivia: Released in the US on September 15, 1933 as F.P.1. French version is titled Î.F.1 ne répond plus. German title translates to F.P.1 Does Not Answer. Based on the 1931 novel of the same name by Kurt Siodmak. The UK version of the film ran 74 minutes, more than 30 minutes less than the original. The US version ran 90 minutes.\n\nDecember 22 – The Mummy (USA)\n\nCast: Boris Karloff, Zita Johann, David Manners, Arthur Byron, Edward Van Sloan, Bramwell Fletcher, Noble Johnson, Kathryn Byron, Leonard Mudie, James Crane, Henry Victor\n\nDirector: Karl Freund\n\nProduction Company: Universal Pictures\n\nTrivia: Boris Karloff was billed simply as KARLOFF. It took eight hours to get Karloff into the mummy make-up for the film’s opening scene. Filming began at 7 PM and completed at 2AM. While publicity stills prominently feature Karloff in the mummy make-up, he appears in the rest of the film in less elaborate make-up. A longer flashback sequence was filmed but the footage is lost.

Winner of the Silver Lion awards at the 14 Venice International Film Festival. To play Toulouse-Lautrec, Ferrer designed a set of knee pads so he could walk on his knees, which were used in addition to specially created and photographed sets with pits for him to walk in. John Houston wanted the color palette of the film to look as if Toulouse-Lautrec painted it, and Technicolor was reluctant to produce a more muted color scheme which was opposed to the sometimes gaudy ‘glorious Technicolor’ the film process was known for. Nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director and Actor, winning two for Best Color Art Direction and Best Color Costume Design. Also nominated for three BAFTAs, and received a Golden Globe for Colette Marchand as Most Promising Newcomer – Female. Critics were surprised the film was not nominated for its cinematography.\n\nDecember 24 – Against All Flags (USA)\n\nCast: Errol Flynn, Maureen O’Hara, Anthony Quinn, Alice Kelley, Mildred Natwick, Robert Warwick, Harry Cording, John Alderson, Phil Tully, Lester Matthews, Tudor Owen, Maurice Marsac, James Craven, James Fairfax, Bill Radovich\n\nDirector: George Sherman, Douglas Sirk\n\nProduction Company: Universal International Pictures, distributed by Universal Pictures\n\nTrivia: The film was originally written for Douglas Fairbanks Jr. but the project never materialized and the script was sold to Universal. Though Errol Flynn was under contract to Warner Bros., he was allowed to make one film a year outside of the studio. His contract for the film with Universal entitled him to a percentage of the profits. Filming was delayed so Flynn could finish Maru Maru at Warners. This was Flynn’s last Hollywood swashbuckler. Flynn’s contact specified the end of the filming day would be 4:00 PM by which time he would be inebriated. Maureen O’Hara said Flynn was a professional even though he did sneak booze onto the set, often injecting it into oranges. O’Hara often had to film her close-up while looking at a flag while someone read Flynn’s line off camera. Filming had to be suspended with only ten days left in production after Flynn broke his ankle. When filming resumed more than two months later, director George Sherman had moved on to Willie and Joe Back at the Front, and the film was completed by Douglas Sirk.\n\nDecember 25 – Blackbeard the Pirate (USA)\n\nCast: Robert Newton, Linda Darnell, William Bendix, Keith Andes, Torin Thatcher, Irene Ryan, Alan Mowbray, Richard Egan, Skelton Knaggs, Dick Wessel\n\nDirector: Raoul Walsh\n\nProduction Company: RKO Radio Pictures\n\nTrivia: Based on an original story by DeVallon Scott. The film was originally conceived as a vehicle for Faith Domergue and was to be titled Buccaneer Empire, directed by Robert Stevenson.\n\nDecember 25 – My Cousin Rachel (USA)\n\nCast: Olivia de Havilland, Richard Burton, Audrey Dalton, Ronald Squire, George Dolenz, John Sutton, Tudor Owen, J. M. Kerrigan\n\nDirector: Henry Koster\n\nProduction Company: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nTrivia: Based on the 1951 novel of the same name by Daphne du Maurier. Richard Burton’s first US film. George Cukor was the film’s original director but exited the project when he and du Maurier were unhappy with the screenplay’s adaptation. Burton had no interest in the story but took the role to work with Cukor. He never knew if the director had quit or was fired. Du Maurier’s agent tried to sell the rights to the story for $100,000 and 5% of the international box office and every studio rejected the offer. Fox paid $80,000. Burton was going to ask for no less than £7,000 (about $18,000 USD) and was surprised when the studio offered him $50,000. Olivia de Havilland allegedly insisted that she be addressed as ‘Miss de Havilland’ by cast and crew, a change from the more informal ‘Livvie’ that had been acceptable on other sets. Burton earned his first Oscar nomination, and the film received three others in technical categories. De Havilland was Golden Globe nominated, and Burton won the New Star of the Year – Actor Globe.\n\nDecember 25 – Ruby Gentry (USA)\n\nCast: Jennifer Jones, Charlton Heston, Karl Malden, Tom Tully, Barney Phillips, James Anderson, Josephine Hutchinson\n\nDirector: King Vidor\n\nProduction Company: Bernhard-Vidor Productions Inc., distributed by Twentieth Century Fox\n\nTrivia: The film’s title inspired Roberta Lee Streeter to sing under the name Bobbie Gentry.\n\nDecember 25 – The Bad and the Beautiful (USA)\n\nCast: Lana Turner, Kirk Douglas, Walter Pidgeon, Dick Powell, Barry Sullivan, Gloria Grahame, Gilbert Roland, Leo G. Carroll, Vanessa Brown, Paul Stewart, Sammy White, Elaine Stewart, Ivan Triesault\n\nDirector: Vincente Minnelli\n\nProduction Company: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nTrivia: The film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2002. Based on a 1949 magazine story ‘Of Good and Evil’ by George Bradshaw. The film won five Oscars out of six nominations, including Best Supporting Actress (Grahame), the most for any film not also nominated for Best Picture or Best Director. Kirk Douglas was the only nominee to not win. The film also scored two Golden Globe nominations in the Supporting categories for Grahame and Gilbert Roland. The same creative team also collaborated on the film Two Weeks in Another Town (1962), with the song ‘Don’t Blame Me’ featured in both films. In a very meta moment, the characters in that film are watching scenes from The Bad and the Beautiful. John Houseman had been offered the project to produce, under the title Memo to a Bad Man, and he accepted on the condition he could make it a Hollywood story instead of a Broadway story, feeling he could add nothing new to a Broadway story especially after All About Eve. Clark Gable was originally signed to star, then Spencer Tracy before Kirk Douglas took the lead role. The film’s title was changed to Tribute to a Bad Man but the studio feared people would mistake it for a Western, and the title was changed again. Houseman thought the new title was dreadful, loathsome, cheap and vulgar, but after the film’s success he said it was one of the greatest titles ever conceived.\n\nDecember 25 – The Member of the Wedding (USA)\n\nCast: Ethel Waters, Julie Harris, Brandon De Wilde, Arthur Franz, Nancy Gates, William Hansen, James Edwards, Harry Bolden, Dickie Moore\n\nDirector: Fred Zinnemann\n\nProduction Company: Stanley Kramer Productions, distributed by Columbia Pictures\n\nTrivia: Based on Carson McCullers’ 1946 novel of the same name. Dickie Moore’s last film appearance. Julie Harris received an Oscar nomination for her performance.\n\nDecember 27 – Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd (USA)\n\nCast: Bud Abbott, Lou Costello, Charles Laughton, Hillary Brooke, Bill Shirley, Leif Erickson, Fran Warren\n\nDirector: Charles Lamont\n\nProduction Company: Woodley Productions Inc., distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nTrivia: During a slump in his career, Charles Laughton reprised the role of Captain Kidd from the 1945 film of the same name for the small salary of $25,000. The second film shot in SuperCineColor, a three-color version of the standard two-color CineColor process. Universal, the comedy duo’s home, would not foot the bill for color so they did it themselves exercising their contract option to produce one independent film a year using Bud Abbott’s company Woodley Productions. Filming was completed in one month.\n\n1962\n\nDecember 21 – In Search of the Castaways (USA)\n\nCast: Maurice Chevalier, Hayley Mills, George Sanders, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Michael Anderson, Keith Hamshere, Antonio Cifariello, Wilfrid Brambell, Jack Gwillim, Inia Te Wiata\n\nDirector: Robert Stevenson\n\nProduction Company: Walt Disney Productions, distributed by Buena Vista Distribution Company\n\nTrivia: Freely based upon Jules Verne’s 1868 adventure novel Captain Grant’s Children. The third of six films Hayley Mills made for Disney. The film was originally titled The Castaways, and was developed specifically for Mills. Walt Disney wanted her brother Jonathan to play her brother on screen but his school teachers turned down the offer. Charles Laughton was cast in the lead role but had to drop out after his cancer diagnosis and was replaced with Maurice Chevalier.\n\nDecember 22 – Le procès (France)\n\nCast: Anthony Perkins, Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli, Suzanne Flon, Orson Welles, Akim Tamiroff, Madeleine Robinson, Paola Mori, Arnoldo Foà, Fernand Ledoux, Michael Lonsdale\n\nDirector: Orson Welles\n\nProduction Company: Paris-Europa Productions, Hisa-Film, Finanziaria Cinematografica Italiana, Globus-Dubrava, distributed by UFA-Cormacico (France), Astor Pictures Corporation (USA)\n\nTrivia: The film opened in the US on February 20, 1963 as The Trial. Based on the 1925 posthumously published novel of the same name by Franz Kafka. Orson Welles also wrote the screenplay. The film’s reputation has grown over time with some critics now calling it a masterpiece. Producer Ilya Salkind wanted Welles to direct a story available in the public domain and offered him Taras Bulba, but then learned a film was already in production. Salkind offered Welles a list of 82 other titles to choose from and Welles felt The Trial was the most feasible to produce. It was only then that they learned the story had not yet entered the public domain and the rights had to be purchased. Welles wanted to cast Jackie Gleason in the role of Hastler, but when he rejected the offer Welles took the role himself. Welles also dubbed some dialogue for 11 actors including Anthony Perkins and defied Perkins to determine where the dubbing took place. Perkins was unable to identify where the dubbing occured.\n\nDecember 25 – Who’s Got the Action? (USA)\n\nCast: Dean Martin, Lana Turner, Eddie Albert, Walter Matthau, Paul Ford, Nita Talbot, John McGiver, Jack Albertson\n\nDirector: Daniel Mann\n\nProduction Company: Amro-Claude-Mea, distributed by Paramount Pictures\n\nTrivia: Based on the novel Four Horse Players Are Missing by Alexander Rose.
