        "text": "Directed by Leo McCarey, The Awful Truth (1937) opens with Jerry Warriner (Cary Grant) at his New York City's men club getting a sun lamp tan. He is supposed to have taken a solo vacation to Florida, but he really stayed in the city to play cards with his friends. When he arrives home, Jerry finds his wife, Lucy (Irene Dunne), coming in with her handsome French voice teacher, Armand Duvalle (Alexander D'Arcy), with whom she was forced to spend the night in the country after his car — so they claim — unexpectedly broke down. Lucy then notices that the Florida oranges Jerry has gifted her are actually stamped «California,» leading her to believe that her husband is lying. Mutual suspicions inevitably result in divorce.\n\nIrene Dunne, Cary Grant, Esther Dale and Ralph Bellamy in The Awful Truth.\n\nDuring the divorce proceedings, Lucy moves in with her Aunt Patsy (Cecil Cunningham), who introduces her to their neighbour Dan Leeson (Ralph Bellamy), a presentable and eligible Oklahoma oil man. Lucy and Dan are instantly attracted to each other and soon announce their engagement, which Jerry resolves to break up. However, when Dan's mother (Esther Dale), who is opposed to the engagement, starts spreading gossip about Lucy, Jerry comes to her defense.\n\nThrough a series of events, Lucy and Dan do separate, but by that time Jerry has got involved with heiress Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont). To break up this relationship, on the night before the final divorce decree, Lucy crashes a party at the Vance mansion, posing as Jerry's sister. She pretends to get drunk, parodies the risqué musical number of one of Jerry's former girlfriends and insinuates that «their» father had been a gardener at Princeton University, not a student athlete as Jerry had claimed. Realizing that his chances with Barbara have been effectively sabotaged, Jerry drives Lucy away in her car. Determined not to lose Jerry, Lucy tricks him up to Aunt Patsy's cabin, where they are happily reconciled just before the clock strikes midnight.\n\nLucy Warriner: You've come home and caught me in the truth, and it seems there's nothing less logical than the truth.\n\nThe son of a promoter of prize fights in California, Leo McCarey tried everything from boxing to mining to practicing law before entering the film industry as a writer in 1918. Five years later, he was hired to work at the Hal Roach Studios, where he supervised, wrote and directed several silent shorts starring comedic duo Stan Laurel and Olivier Hardy. With the coming of the sound era, he signed with Paramount Pictures and focused on feature-film directing, achieving great success with Duck Soup (1933) and Ruggles of Red Gap (1935).\n\nFollowing a failed attempt at resurrecting Harold Lloyd's career with The Milky Way (1936), McCarey directed the unsettling Depression-era family tragedy Make Way for Tomorrow (1937), the personal favourite of all his movies. Despite opening to positive reviews from critics, the film performed poorly at the box-office, prompting Paramount head Adolph Zukor to drop McCarey's contract. At the same time, Columbia chief Harry Cohn was looking for a replacement for Frank Capra, who had left the studio after being denied a salary raise. An admirer of McCarey's comic talents, Cohn immediately signed the director and assigned him to a follow-up to Theodora Goes Wild (1936), a movie that revealed the until-then undiscovered comic talents of Irene Dunne and earned her a second Academy Award nomination.\n\nLEFT: Leo McCarey c. 1930. RIGHT: Cary Grant and Leo McCarey on the set.\n\nOne day, McCarey ran into Cary Grant on the corner of Vine and Melrose in Hollywood and discovered the actor, too, had just been dropped by Paramount. But neither knew the other had joined Columbia until that studio decided to pair Grant with Dunne under McCarey's direction. They handed McCarey a script based on a 1922 Broadway play by Arthur Richman titled The Awful Truth. The story had been filmed twice before: first in 1925 as a silent feature starring Agnes Ayres and Warner Baxter, and then in 1929 as a sound picture directed by Marshall Neilan for Pathé, starring stage veteran Ina Claire. The man who purchased the rights to the latter version, D. A. Doran, had become an executive at Columbia, which had bought Pathé's scripts after that company folded. Cohn believed in recycling «sure things,» as he liked to call remakes, because he thought it gave his pictures «better odds.» When he found The Awful Truth among the Pathé scripts, he commissioned an updated version that he could make inexpensively.\n\nCary Grant and Irene Dunne in publicity stills for The Awful Truth.\n\nAfter reading the original Pathé script for The Awful Truth, McCarey promptly threw it in the trash and rewrote it from beginning to end with the help of his friend and occasional collaborator Viña Delmar, who had written Make Way for Tomorrow. He retained the basics of the original play, which centered around an estranged husband's doubts over his wife's relationship with another man, but dropped almost all of the plot incidents, which dealt with mining interests, a fire in an apartment building and a midnight assignation at a luxurious mountain camp.\n\nDuring the making of The Awful Truth, Cohn had not bothered to assign an office to McCarey — he did not believe directors needed such «extravagances» — so the director was forced to do the majority of his daily rewrites by hand in the front seat of his car, with Delmar sitting next to him on the passenger side, scribbling down pages of dialogue in pencil. Then after trying out that day's pages, they kept what worked with the actors and rewrote what did not for the next day's shoot. This was a directing style that Grant particularly loathed, as he preferred to work from a completed script and rehearse his fixed lines with the other cast members several times until «he had nailed every detail of his verbal and physical performance in advance.»\n\nRalph Bellamy, Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in The Awful Truth.\n\nBecause Grant's pre-set approach as so radically different from McCarey's improvisational style, it did not take long for the two to clash. On the first day of filming, someone handed him a series of notes handwritten on scraps of brown paper bag. Grant, as he read what McCarey wanted to get from him that day, thought the director was joking. When none of the routines seemed to work, the director simply told his actors to «make something up that sounded funny.» Grant was appalled, but said nothing. When the same thing happened the following day, however, Grant abandoned the set and went directly to Cohn's office to express his dissatisfaction. Cohn brushed him off, but the next day Grant returned to ask if he could switch roles with Ralph Bellamy, who had been cast in the supporting role of a wealthy oil heir. He claimed that he was much better suited for that role, but Cohn once again sent Grant on his way.\n\nThe day after that, Grant went back again to Cohn, offering him $5,000 in cash as a bribe to be taken off The Awful Truth, on top of which he promised to star in another picture for Columbia — any other picture — for free. Cohn refused the money and again told him to go back to work. Apparently, McCarey became so angry at Grant's attitude that he went to Cohn and said he would double Grant's offer if Cohn would fire the actor. Despite the friction between the two, Grant and McCarey eventually found a way to work together, with the director helping the actor find a way to «use physical humor to portray the essential humanity of Jerry Warriner.»\n\nCary Grant, Irene Dunne and Ralph Bellamy in The Awful Truth.\n\nThe Awful Truth premiered on October 21, 1937 at the famed Radio City Music Hall in New York. (This was the first of 28 Cary Grant movies that would open there, a record never broken.) Critical reviews were uniformly positive. Otis Ferguson the The New Republic described it as «a foolishness that doesn't go wrong or strained,» the New York Sun called it «a rollicking comedy that should delight anyone,» TIME magazine deemed it «delightfully effective entertainment,» and The New York Times considered it «an unapologetic return to the fundamentals of comedy [that] seems original and daring!» While still in its first-run release, the film surpassed the half-million-dollar profit mark, making it one of Columbia's all-time box-office hits. At the 10th Academy Awards, The Awful Truth received nominations for Best Picture, Best Actress (Dunne), Best Supporting Actor (Bellamy), Best Screenplay, Best Editing, and Best Director. When McCarey received the directing award (a big surprise, he said), he was rumored to have remarked, «You gave it to me for the wrong picture,» referring to Make Way for Tomorrow, which he considered his proudest achievement.\n\nWith the success of The Awful Truth, Cary Grant went from a position of relative unimportance only two years earlier, when he had received less than one percent of the annual votes cast at the Motion Picture Herald poll, to one of the top five male box-office attractions of 1937.\n\nThis post is my contribution to The Cary Grant Blogathon hosted by Phyllis Loves Classic Movies.

A drama graduate from Northwestern University, she had just arrived in Hollywood following a Tony Award-winning performance in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest . Impressed by Patricia's looks, Vidor approached the young actress and asked if she would be interested in doing a screen test for the female lead in his newest film, The Fountainhead (1949). Gary Cooper had already signed as the male protagonist, and the studio was then considering Lauren Bacall and Barbara Stanwyck to play his love interest. Neal liked the script and about two months later, she met with the director for sound and photographic tests. Vidor was enthusiastic about Patricia, but her first audition was a complete disaster. Cooper was apparently watching her from off the set and he was so unimpressed by her performance that he commented, « What's that!? » He tried to con\n\nIn the mid- and late 1930s, screwball comedy was in vogue and practically every actress in Hollywood tried her hand at it. Barbara Stanwyck never considered herself a naturally funny person or a comedienne per se , but after delivering a heart-wrenching performance in King Vidor's Stella Dallas (1937), she decided she needed a « vacation » from emotional dramas. In her search for a role, she stumbled upon a « champagne comedy » called The Mad Miss Manton (1938), originally intended as a Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda as Melsa and Peter in The Mad Miss Manton . Directed by Leigh Jason from a script by Philip G. Epstein, The Mad Miss Manton begins when vivacious Park Avenue socialite Melsa Manton finds a corpse while walking her dogs in the early hours of the morning. She calls the police, but they dismiss the incident — not only because Melsa is a notorious prankster, but also because the body disappears in the meantime. Sarcastic newspaper editor\n\nAt the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony, MGM's hugely successful prison drama The Big House (1930) earned writer Frances Marion an Oscar for Best Writing. Hoping that she would be inspired to repeat that accomplishment, Irving Thalberg, head of production at Metro, sent Marion to Chicago, Illinois to research story ideas. While flicking through the pages of The Saturday Evening Post , she found an article revealing that, in a city where people distrusted the police, a small group of leading citizens met in secret to arrange their own justice for criminals. Marion took inspiration from that story and wrote The Secret Six (1931), in which Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone, stars of The Big House , play two mobsters prosecuted by a half a dozen vigilantes. Thalberg was pleased with the leading roles Marion wrote for Beery and Stone, but asked if she could also fill out one of the minor leads for Clark Gable , a tall, dark and handsome 30-year-old actor whom Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had recen\n\nTheatrical release poster Directed by George Sidney , Who Was That Lady?

This list includes both classic and «modern» films, which make up a total of 161 titles. About three or four of these were re-watches, but I decided to include them anyway. Let me know how many from these you have seen. As always, films marked with a heart ( ❤ ) are my favorites. Sherlock Jr. (1924) | Starring Buster Keaton, Kathryn McGuire and Joe Keaton The Crowd (1928) | Starring James Murray, Eleanor Boardman and Bert Roach Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) | Starring Henry Fonda, Alice Brady and Marjorie Weaver Brief Encounter (1945) | Starring Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard and Stanley Holloway The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) | Starring Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman The Girl He Left Behind (1956) | Starring Tab Hunter and Natalie Wood Gidget (1959) | Starring Sandra Dee, Cliff Robertson an\n\nWings was the first ever film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Since then, it has become one of the most influential war dramas, noted for its technical realism and spectacular air-combat sequences. This is the story of how it came to be made. A man and his story The concept for Wings originated from a writer trying to sell one of his stories. In September 1924, Byron Morgan approached Jesse L. Lasky, vice-president of Famous Players-Lasky, a component of Paramount Pictures, proposing that the studio do an aviation film. Morgan suggested an «incident and plot» focused on the failure of the American aerial effort in World War I and the effect that the country's «aviation unpreparedness» would have in upcoming conflicts. Lasky liked the idea, and approved the project under the working title «The Menace.» LEFT: Byron Morgan (1889-1963). RIGHT: Jesse L. Lasky (1880-1958).

I used to watch dozens of classic films every month, and every time I discovered a new star I liked I would go and watch their entire filmography. But somewhere along the way, that passion dimmed down. For instance, I watched 73 classic films in 2016, and only 10 in 2020. The other day, I found this film with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. that I had never heard of — the film is Mimi (1935), by the way — and for some reason it made me really excited about Old Hollywood again. It made me really miss the magic of that era and all the wonderful actors and actresses. And it also made me think of all the reasons why I fell in love with classic films in the first place. I came up with 80 reasons, which I thought would be fun to share with you. Most of them are just random little scenes or quirky little quotes, but put them together and they spell Old Hollywood to me. Yesterday I posted part one ; her\n\nChristmas has always been a source of inspiration to many artists and writers. Over the years, filmmakers have adapted various Christmas stories into both movies and TV specials, which have become staples during the holiday season all around the world. Even though Christmas is my favourite holiday, I haven't watched a lot of Christmas films. Still, I thought it would be fun to rank my top 10 favourites, based on the ones that I have indeed seen. Here they are. 10. Holiday Affair (1949) Directed by Don Hartman, Holiday Affair tells the story of a young widow (Janet Leigh) torn between a boring attorney (Wendell Corey) and a romantic drifter (Robert Mitchum). She's engaged to marry the boring attorney, but her son (Gordon Gebert) likes the romantic drifter better. Who will she choose? Well, we all know who she will choose. Holiday Affair is not by any means the greatest Christmas film of all time, but it's still a very enjoyable Yule-tide comedy to watch over the holi\n\nIn January 1944, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer happened to see a young crooner by the name of Frank Sinatra perform at a benefit concert for The Jewish Home for the Aged in Los Angeles. According to Nancy Sinatra, Frank's eldest daughter, Mayer was so moved by her father's soulful rendition of « Ol' Man River » that he made the decision right then and there to sign Frank to his studio. Sinatra had been on the MGM payroll once before, singing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in the Eleanor Powell vehicle Ship Ahoy (1942), although it is very likely that Mayer never bothered to see that film. Now that Frank was «hot,» however, Metro made arrangements to buy half of his contract from RKO, with the final deal being signed in February of that year. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra in Anchors Aweigh Being a contract player at the studio that boasted «more stars than there are in the heavens» gave Frank a sudden perspective regarding his own talents as a film performer.
