Three years later, the sight of a dilapidated ante-bellum mansion and the odor of oleander and wild orange trees lure him to an island off the Georgia coast to seek fresh water. There he meets unsophisticated Millie Stope and her fear-crazed grandfather, Litchfield Stope, who are being held in terror by Nicholas, a dim-witted escaped murderer who is the only other inhabitant of the island. Nicholas, who has designs on Millie, tries to frighten the strangers away by destroying a barrel that Paul has brought ashore to replenish the boat's water supply.

Title cards within the film refer to Virginia Valli's character as \"Millie Stope,\" while some contemporary sources referred to her as \"Nellie Stope.\" The Var review listed a running time of sixty-six minutes, but the print viewed, which was a 2006 restoration broadcast on the Turner Classic Movie network, ran approximately eighty-six minutes. The restored print was accompanied by an original music score by Vivek Maddala.\n\nLess\n\nDespondent and guilt-ridden when his new bride is killed after being thrown from a runaway carriage he is driving, Bostonian John Woolfolk escapes from his grief by living in his sailboat with his cook, Paul Halvard, as his only companion.

That evening, as Millie and Litchfield prepare to leave, Nicholas, who is insanely jealous, begs Millie to marry him and threatens that he will not be responsible for his actions if she does not. Although Millie tries to keep Nicholas out of the study, where she and her grandfather are hiding, Nicholas breaks through the door and, in a struggle, strikes Litchfield with a club, killing him. Millie tries to keep Nicholas at bay with a revolver, but he knocks it away and overpowers her. Meanwhile, at the dock, John becomes concerned when Millie does not arrive at the agreed upon time and rushes to the mansion to find her. After seeing Litchfield's body, John then goes upstairs, where he discovers that Nicholas has tied Millie to a bed. After a fight, John subdues the madman and escapes with Millie to the yacht. Following them to the water's edge, Nicholas fires Millie’s retrieved revolver at the boat, injuring Paul as he and John prepare to cross the dangerously low channel. Nicholas is finally killed by a fierce dog that has broken its leash and bites into the man's throat. Despite the low tides, John is able to maneuver the boat to safety as Millie takes the wheel. The next morning, as Paul recuperates from his wounds, John and Millie look forward to spending their lives together.\n\nLess"
