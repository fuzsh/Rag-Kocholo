        "text": "November 6, 2023\n\nFor the most part, unless you are something of an aficionado of classic Hollywood films, you're likely to notice the author of this memoir and say to yourself 'King Who?'.\n\nYou may, of course, have seen 'The Wizard of Oz', directed (mostly) by Victor Fleming. When Fleming was removed from the 'Oz' filming late in production in order to take over duties for the filming of 'Gone With the Wind', King Vidor was called in to finish 'TWOO'. It was left to KV to film the sepia-toned Kansas sequences (which included Judy Garland singing 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' and the subsequent tornado).\n\nKV was an excellent film director and, apparently, one that was rather well-liked in showbiz circles (mainly for being level-headed and egalitarian). Starting in the silent era, he helmed such memorable films as 'Hallelujah' (one of the first major studio films with an all-African-American cast), 'The Crowd', 'Show People', 'Street Scene', 'Stella Dallas', 'The Citadel' and 'Solomon and Sheba', among others.\n\nHe also had the 'misfortune' to be behind the camera for the likes of 'Duel in the Sun', 'The Fountainhead' (a personal favorite due to its Ayn Rand-wackiness in a gorgeous setting), 'Beyond the Forest' and 'Ruby Gentry': films which nowadays hold considerable camp appeal (through no fault of KV).\n\nHe was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1979, mainly for his impressive innovations.\n\nI would imagine there are few Goodreads folk who are ever in the market for a memoir by a film director - or, rather, if it's someone like Quentin Tarantino, then perhaps. But perhaps not if it's by someone who hails from the early days.\n\nNevertheless, KV's memories are lovingly detailed and he comes across as not only engaging (and light-spirited) but as something of a humanitarian in the way he viewed the purpose of filmmaking (particularly as opportunities allowed in the earlier years of his career). Not surprisingly, KV's tone is very down-to-earth. Again, this breezy and genuinely fascinating autobiography will be best appreciated by those with a deeper interest in Hollywood's earlier days of glory. For me, it could easily have been longer, with lots more stories.\n\nOctober 17, 2018\n\nVidor's autobiography is an excellent first hand account from the pioneering days of early silent film that takes us a little past the end of Hollywood's golden age and studio system. From the outside his achievements rightly place him among the greatest directors the medium has ever seen but his films match his writer's voice with this autobiography and you will probably not find a single peer of his in the history of film who was less pretentious and seemingly more honest. So what we get here is his straightforward and remarkable story up until the time he wrote it* and it is probably as edifying in terms of learning about film theory and production as it is regarding Vidor himself and the various people he knew including Charles Chaplin, W.R. Hearst, Howard Hughes, David Selznick, Greta Garbo, Gary Cooper and the list can go on an on.\n\n*The book was published in 1953 before he had retired and significantly before 1967 when he spent a year trying to solve and make a film out of the unsolved mystery of William Desmond Taylor's murder in 1922. If you want to read about this, see the fascinating book, \"A Cast of Killers\" by Sidney Kirkpatrick.\n\nApril 5, 2019\n\n\"David Selznick once queried me concerning ‘the icebox element’ in one of my pictures. By this he meant the thought and discussion that a good film ought to provoke when the family returns home from the theater for a midnight snack.”\n\nOctober 14, 2022\n\nFascinating memoir! Too bad this remarkable book is so difficult to find!\n\nRead\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\n\"The book is now out of print, fetching high prices in the usual corners, although I was able to find an affordably priced copy with a little legwork. The book’s rarity seems symptomatic of the larger obscurity surrounding Vidor. Even his 1926 masterpiece The Crowd, one of the first films selected for preservation by the Library of Congress, is unavailable except on the Criterion Channel platform. This relegation to a certain fanatical circle of cinephiles is a sad end for a director who never lost faith in the intelligence of the “average” movie-goer:\n\n“If the intent is sincere and the content psychologically sound, I have never yet found that the audience was incapable of understanding and reacting appreciatively … [When] one of my better films, The Crowd, was reported to be over the heads of the audience, I made a point of discussing it with every bellboy, salesgirl, soda jerker, and taxi driver I met who had seen it. I never found one who hadn’t thoroughly understood every idea that I was trying to put forth.” (p. 76)\n\nAs the above excerpt suggests, the book bears the telltale candidness of an elder statesman who finds himself with the opportunity to speak directly to his audience for the first time. And yet I was struck from the opening pages by a strange sense of familiarity, as though the cadence and phrasing of his voice were recognizable to me from his films alone.\"\n\nMore of my thoughts on Vidor here.\n\nApril 30, 2008\n\nA really enjoyable memoir by director King Vidor, from his early days as a newsreel cameraman, through the silent film era and his days with Goldwyn. Fascinating stuff. This book is worth seeking out.\n\nWant to read\n\nJune 16, 2020\n\nPage one: “I saw in the scene music reduced to movement; I felt its rhythm, tempo, beauty, humor; I was aware of form and composition, of line and action. I wanted to record it, to show others what had been shown me; there must be some way of capturing and preserving what I saw and felt.”\n\nI’m going to love this book.\n\n#classicfilmreading"
