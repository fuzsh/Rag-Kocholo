He was the last of the several directors who worked on the 1939 MGM film The Wizard of Oz.\n\nVidor directed 70 films from 1913 to 1959; he also earned credits as a writer and producer. Vidor was brought onto the Oz project when the main director Victor Fleming left to direct Gone With the Wind. Vidor was responsible for the Kansas sequence of the finished film. He was offered credit on the finished film, but refused, stating the Fleming deserved undisputed credit for the movie."
