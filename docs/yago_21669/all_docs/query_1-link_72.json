        "text": "The Golden Age of Hollywood was all about the glitz and glamour. Movie stars were fashion icons, western heroes, brooding outsiders, average Joes, and femme fatales. Some had careers that spanned decades, others were short-lived in their success, and most of them were no strangers to scandal. In such crazy times as these, there are bound to exist some wild facts about the stars and films that made Old Hollywood legendary. I've rounded up 10 of them. In all honesty, they're not really «wild» facts; they're more like random, useless tidbits.\n\n1. When Clark Gable appeared without an undershirt in It Happened One Night (1934), women across the nation stopped buying the garment for their husbands. This caused a depression in undershirts in the 1930s.\n\n«I didn't know what I was doing to the undershirt people,» Gable said in 1957. «That was just the way I lived. I hadn't worn an undershirt since I'd started school. They made me feel hemmed in and smothered.»\n\n2. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1949.\n\nSince he was not a citizen of the United Kingdom or any of the Commonwealth realms, he could not be styled as Sir Douglas Fairbanks.\n\n3. While filming on location in the Belgian Congo for The African Queen (1951), everyone on the set got dysentery from drinking contaminated water. The only people that escaped illness were Humphrey Bogart and director John Huston.\n\nAccording to Bogart, «all we ate was baked beans, canned asparagus and drank Scotch Whiskey. Whenever a fly bit me or Huston, it dropped dead.»\n\n4. Greta Garbo was Adolf Hitler's favourite actress. The film he liked the most was Camille (1936), which apparently made him «glow.»\n\n«Mr. Hitler was big on me,» Garbo said. «He kept writing and inviting me to come to Germany, and if the war hadn't started when it did, I would have gone and I would have taken a gun out of my purse and shot him, because I'm the only person who would not have been searched.»\n\n5. Lon Chaney was not only one of the most powerful and versatile actors in cinema history, but he was also a master of makeup.\n\nChaney often played grotesque characters and he did his own makeup for the roles. He is recognized as a groundbreaking makeup artist, and he even wrote the entry for «makeup» in the 1929 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\n6. To film the burning of Atlanta scene in Gone with the Wind (1939), MGM actually burned many old sets that needed to be cleared from the studio back lot, including ones from King Kong (1933) and The Garden of Allah (1936).\n\nThe resulting fire was so intense that Culver City residents jammed the telephone lines, thinking that MGM was truly burning down.\n\n7. Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman were active FBI informants in Hollywood, reporting on other actors who they suspected of subversive activities.\n\nAccording to an FBI report, the Reagans provided the Bureau with «information regarding the activities of some members of the [Screen Actors] Guild who they suspected were carrying on Communist Party work.» This may have directly or indirectly contributed to the blacklisting of a large number of Hollywood employees during the HUAC hearings in 1947.\n\n8. Whenever Errol Flynn was banned from drinking on a film set, he would inject oranges with vodka and eat them during his breaks.\n\nBesides emptying half a bottle of cognac into his coffee when no one was looking, Flynn would use a hypodermic syringe to inject fresh oranges with vodka. Apparently, he picked up this trick from Ann Sheridan.\n\n9. Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel shared a room in a boarding house in New York, when they went on a tour of the U.S. in 1910, as part of Fred Karno's comedy troupe.\n\n«We had a lot of fun in those days,» Laurel recalled. «Charlie and I roomed together and I can still see him play the violin or cello to cover the noise of the cooking of bacon I was doing on the gas ring (forbidden of course). Then we'd both take towels and try to blow the smoke out of the window.»\n\n10. Jean Harlow was the godmother of Millicent Siegel, daughter of the notorious mobster Benjamin «Bugsy» Siegel.\n\nHarlow was one of the first stars Siegel met when he moved to Hollywood in the early 1930s. Soon enough, she became Millicent's godmother. Not officially, since the role had no formal place in Jewish families. «It wasn't a formal ceremony,» Millicent explained. «She just decided she was going to be my godmother, so that's what she became.»\n\n______________________________________\n\nSOURCES:\n\nBenjamin «Bugsy» Siegel: The Gangster, the Flamingo, and the Making of Modern Las Vegas by Larry D.

A drama graduate from Northwestern University, she had just arrived in Hollywood following a Tony Award-winning performance in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest . Impressed by Patricia's looks, Vidor approached the young actress and asked if she would be interested in doing a screen test for the female lead in his newest film, The Fountainhead (1949). Gary Cooper had already signed as the male protagonist, and the studio was then considering Lauren Bacall and Barbara Stanwyck to play his love interest. Neal liked the script and about two months later, she met with the director for sound and photographic tests. Vidor was enthusiastic about Patricia, but her first audition was a complete disaster. Cooper was apparently watching her from off the set and he was so unimpressed by her performance that he commented, « What's that!? » He tried to con\n\nIn the mid- and late 1930s, screwball comedy was in vogue and practically every actress in Hollywood tried her hand at it. Barbara Stanwyck never considered herself a naturally funny person or a comedienne per se , but after delivering a heart-wrenching performance in King Vidor's Stella Dallas (1937), she decided she needed a « vacation » from emotional dramas. In her search for a role, she stumbled upon a « champagne comedy » called The Mad Miss Manton (1938), originally intended as a Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda as Melsa and Peter in The Mad Miss Manton . Directed by Leigh Jason from a script by Philip G. Epstein, The Mad Miss Manton begins when vivacious Park Avenue socialite Melsa Manton finds a corpse while walking her dogs in the early hours of the morning. She calls the police, but they dismiss the incident — not only because Melsa is a notorious prankster, but also because the body disappears in the meantime. Sarcastic newspaper editor\n\nAt the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony, MGM's hugely successful prison drama The Big House (1930) earned writer Frances Marion an Oscar for Best Writing. Hoping that she would be inspired to repeat that accomplishment, Irving Thalberg, head of production at Metro, sent Marion to Chicago, Illinois to research story ideas. While flicking through the pages of The Saturday Evening Post , she found an article revealing that, in a city where people distrusted the police, a small group of leading citizens met in secret to arrange their own justice for criminals. Marion took inspiration from that story and wrote The Secret Six (1931), in which Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone, stars of The Big House , play two mobsters prosecuted by a half a dozen vigilantes. Thalberg was pleased with the leading roles Marion wrote for Beery and Stone, but asked if she could also fill out one of the minor leads for Clark Gable , a tall, dark and handsome 30-year-old actor whom Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had recen\n\nTheatrical release poster Directed by George Sidney , Who Was That Lady?

This list includes both classic and «modern» films, which make up a total of 161 titles. About three or four of these were re-watches, but I decided to include them anyway. Let me know how many from these you have seen. As always, films marked with a heart ( ❤ ) are my favorites. Sherlock Jr. (1924) | Starring Buster Keaton, Kathryn McGuire and Joe Keaton The Crowd (1928) | Starring James Murray, Eleanor Boardman and Bert Roach Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) | Starring Henry Fonda, Alice Brady and Marjorie Weaver Brief Encounter (1945) | Starring Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard and Stanley Holloway The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) | Starring Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman The Girl He Left Behind (1956) | Starring Tab Hunter and Natalie Wood Gidget (1959) | Starring Sandra Dee, Cliff Robertson an\n\nWings was the first ever film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Since then, it has become one of the most influential war dramas, noted for its technical realism and spectacular air-combat sequences. This is the story of how it came to be made. A man and his story The concept for Wings originated from a writer trying to sell one of his stories. In September 1924, Byron Morgan approached Jesse L. Lasky, vice-president of Famous Players-Lasky, a component of Paramount Pictures, proposing that the studio do an aviation film. Morgan suggested an «incident and plot» focused on the failure of the American aerial effort in World War I and the effect that the country's «aviation unpreparedness» would have in upcoming conflicts. Lasky liked the idea, and approved the project under the working title «The Menace.» LEFT: Byron Morgan (1889-1963). RIGHT: Jesse L. Lasky (1880-1958). During his development of the scenario with William Shepherd, a former war correspondent, Morga\n\nI started this blog six years ago as a way to share my passion for classic films and Old Hollywood. I used to watch dozens of classic films every month, and every time I discovered a new star I liked I would go and watch their entire filmography. But somewhere along the way, that passion dimmed down. For instance, I watched 73 classic films in 2016, and only 10 in 2020. The other day, I found this film with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. that I had never heard of — the film is Mimi (1935), by the way — and for some reason it made me really excited about Old Hollywood again. It made me really miss the magic of that era and all the wonderful actors and actresses. And it also made me think of all the reasons why I fell in love with classic films in the first place. I came up with 80 reasons, which I thought would be fun to share with you. Most of them are just random little scenes or quirky little quotes, but put them together and they spell Old Hollywood to me. Yesterday I posted part one ; her\n\nChristmas has always been a source of inspiration to many artists and writers. Over the years, filmmakers have adapted various Christmas stories into both movies and TV specials, which have become staples during the holiday season all around the world. Even though Christmas is my favourite holiday, I haven't watched a lot of Christmas films. Still, I thought it would be fun to rank my top 10 favourites, based on the ones that I have indeed seen. Here they are. 10. Holiday Affair (1949) Directed by Don Hartman, Holiday Affair tells the story of a young widow (Janet Leigh) torn between a boring attorney (Wendell Corey) and a romantic drifter (Robert Mitchum). She's engaged to marry the boring attorney, but her son (Gordon Gebert) likes the romantic drifter better. Who will she choose? Well, we all know who she will choose. Holiday Affair is not by any means the greatest Christmas film of all time, but it's still a very enjoyable Yule-tide comedy to watch over the holi\n\nIn January 1944, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer happened to see a young crooner by the name of Frank Sinatra perform at a benefit concert for The Jewish Home for the Aged in Los Angeles. According to Nancy Sinatra, Frank's eldest daughter, Mayer was so moved by her father's soulful rendition of « Ol' Man River » that he made the decision right then and there to sign Frank to his studio. Sinatra had been on the MGM payroll once before, singing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in the Eleanor Powell vehicle Ship Ahoy (1942), although it is very likely that Mayer never bothered to see that film. Now that Frank was «hot,» however, Metro made arrangements to buy half of his contract from RKO, with the final deal being signed in February of that year. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra in Anchors Aweigh Being a contract player at the studio that boasted «more stars than there are in the heavens» gave Frank a sudden perspective regarding his own talents as a film performer.
