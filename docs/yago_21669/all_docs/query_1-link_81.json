        "text": "” Some of the most exciting cinema these days has an Asian flavor, and one of the best places to see it is at the Asian American International Film Festival. The 22nd edition of the popular fest kicks off Friday and continues on July 24, 25, 30 and 31 at Florence Gould Hall (55 E. 59th St.). The series then moves to the Brooklyn Heights Cinema (Henry and Orange streets) on Aug. 6-8. In past years, the event offered New Yorkers a first look at works by directors Ang Lee, Mira Nair, Wayne Wang and Chen Kaige. Who knows how many of this year’s new helmers will become stars? Slated are 35 features, documentaries and shorts from the United States and six other nations. The festival will also hand out several awards, including one to Sammo Hung, who plays a tough cop on TV’s “Martial Law.” Sponsored by Asian CineVision, the festival began at NYU, then moved to Chinatown’s Rosemary Theater before settling in Midtown in 1989. This year’s event kicks off Friday night with “Shiri,” a high-tech espionage thriller from Korea and the all-time box office champ in its homeland. From Singapore comes “That’s the Way I Like It,” a comedy about a frustrated young man who seeks solace in Bruce Lee movies and fast motorbikes. (The flick begins a commercial run in New York on Aug. 6.) The Philippines is sending “Jose Rizal,” a portrait of the real-life social reformer, who was executed at age 35. Nair, who made a name for herself with “Salaam Bombay!” in 1988, is represented by “My Home Country,” the story of an Asian doctor treating AIDS victims in the Smoky Mountains. The ensemble cast includes Marisa Tomei, Hal Holbrook and Swoosie Kurtz. For more information, call (212) 925-6014. (-sbull-) The Museum of Modern Art has a wish. No, make that 77 wishes – one for each of the films that it would like to add to the more than 17,000 titles already in its permanent collection. Through Sept. 14, the Modern is screening the 77 movies its curators are hoping some kind souls will donate to MoMA. They date from King Vidor’s “Wild Oranges” (1924) through James Cameron’s “Titantic” (1998), and include documentaries, features and experimental works from around the globe. It’s an eclectic mix: Howard Hawks’ “Bringing Up Baby” (1938), John Woo’s “Face/Off” (1997), Sidney Lumet’s “Dog Day Afternoon” (1975), Martin Scorsese’s “GoodFellas” (1990), Todd Haynes’ “Safe” (1995), Aki Kaurismaki’s “The Match Factory Girl” (1990) and John Waters’ “Pink Flamingos” (1972) are among them. MoMA is on West 53rd Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues. For more information, call (212) 708-9400. (-sbull-) A rare chance to see Orson Welles’ “Citizen Kane” (1941) on the big screen presents itself Tuesday and Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. at the Whitney Museum of American Art (Madison Avenue and 75th Street). Other noir masterpieces screening this week at the Whitney include John Huston’s “The Maltese Falcon” (1941), Otto Preminger’s “Laura” (1944) and two by Hawks, “To Have and Have Not” (1944) and “The Big Sleep” (1946). For more information, call (212) 570-3676. V.A. Musetto is film editor of The Post. He can be e-mailed at vam@nypost.com"
