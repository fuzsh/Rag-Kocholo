        "text": "By Iain Blair\n\nThe Woman King director Gina Prince-Bythewood is one of the most versatile storytellers working in film and television. Her eclectic resume includes writing and directing such feature films as Love & Basketball, The Secret Life of Bees and Beyond the Lights.\n\nPrince-Bythewood’s newest is The Woman King for Sony’s Tristar Pictures. It tells the story of the Agojie, the all-female unit of warriors who protected the African Kingdom of Dahomey in the 1800s. Inspired by true events, The Woman King follows the epic journey of General Nanisca (Viola Davis) as she trains the next generation of recruits and readies them for battle against an enemy determined to destroy their way of life.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes creative team includes Prince-Bythewood’s longtime editor Terilyn A. Shropshire, DP Polly Morgan (ASC, BSC), VFX supervisor Sara Bennett and composer Terence Blanchard.\n\nI spoke with the director about making the film, editing and dealing with all the VFX. Editor Shropshire joined the conversation as well.\n\nCan you talk about the post prep?\n\nWe put the team together very early on, starting with my editor Terilyn Shropshire who’s cut every project of mine and is such a close collaborator. She can do it all – great drama, great action – and I can’t imagine doing this without her. My visual effects supervisor Sara Bennett, who did my last film The Old Guard, also came on very early, and so did Corinne Villa, our first assistant editor. She’s done a couple of projects with me and Teri, and she’s an invaluable part of the team. It’s great to have a close-knit post team like this where we all know each other and work together well.\n\nDid you do a lot of previz?\n\nWe did a lot of stunt-viz because we had a lot of epic battles, so Polly and I could really work out how we wanted to CG them, but also so we could really hone the fighting style. We wanted to do something really distinct, as they’re female warriors based on true life, and we’ve never seen this before. What does it look like, women fighting and beating men?\n\nDanny Hernandez was our stunt and fight coordinator and designer, and it was supremely important that we had all that stuff worked out ahead of time. And we had a couple of very complex stunts that Sara helped previz as well.\n\nTalk about how you collaborated on the look with Polly Morgan.\n\nEarly on, I talked to her about two phrases that summed up what I wanted: “intimately epic” and “pretty gritty.” The story is epic in scope, but it’s also about the relationships between the women. I wanted the women to look beautiful and to be shot beautifully, but for it to look real and of its time period. I didn’t want it to just look glossy.\n\nHow tough was the shoot?\n\nIt was hard work because we shot for 63 days, all on location in South Africa, but that’s where it needed to be filmed to get the real environments and spectacular vistas. I didn’t want it to be a bluescreen movie shot in Atlanta or wherever, and it was important for the actors to be dropped into the real African environments and not to see the usual cars, shops and planes and so on. We created a whole 360-degree world of this epic historical action drama.\n\nWhere did you post?\n\nWe did my director’s cut at PacPost in the Valley, which was great because then we could have not just Teri and her team of assistants there but also our whole VFX team. Even though they’re based in London, we had them stay out here, as there was so much real-time information to deal with. We also had our music editors, and we mixed all the sound on the Sony lot in Dolby Atmos. The big problem during post was that our release date got pushed up by two months, so it’s been a real scramble to get it all done in time.\n\nDo you like the post process?\n\nI love post, but the first three weeks of my director’s cut are really hard. I’m still studying what happened on-set. I haven’t fully separated from the shoot yet, and you can’t help but think about the stuff you didn’t get. It takes a while to get past that and to focus on the coverage you did get and to see the film you actually shot. You just never know what you have until you start putting it all together.\n\nTalk about editing with Terilyn.\n\nWe’ve worked so much together, and there’s so much trust. When I’m shooting, she’s my first audience, and I really rely on her. When you’re shooting it’s all moving so fast. You feel stuff on-set, but you don’t know if it’s translating. It’s only when you sit down together later that it all starts to become clearer, and Teri puts together such great assemblies that then it’s a process of building on that. And while the first part of the director’s cut is hard, it’s also my favorite part because it’s just the two of us working away.\n\nOnce that 10-week period is over, you have to bring in everyone else in to the process. But when it’s a movie you believe in and love, it’s a good process as you’re fighting for your vision.\n\nTerilyn, what were the big editing challenges?\n\nTerilyn Shropshire: Time and volume since there was a lot of film shot, with first and second units often shooting simultaneously. I always aim to watch it all as soon as possible, so my assistant had a real challenge trying to turn around the dailies for me so I could give some feedback about the coverage. It helped that I was on-set. We began editing last October, and we only just locked picture, so it’s been almost a year now.\n\nTerilyn, can you walk us through your editing process?\n\nShropshire: We started editing in Cape Town and then moved back to LA after production wrap. We used Avid Media Composer 2018.12.12. on the macOS platform. The Sony engineering team was phenomenal in minimizing downtime during the transition back to the States. We were able to transfer a lot of our media ahead of our arrival back in the US.\n\nThe team was able to restore our media to a different Avid Nexis, allowing us to hit the ground running, and we were able to use Jump Desktop for the first week in the US. It gave us time to get acclimated and to ensure we could adhere to health and safety protocols. As post continued, we used Jump Desktop to create a really solid remote workflow. The ability to jump in from home or from the mixing stage has proven to be extremely valuable.\n\nThis film has a lot of VFX. Can you talk about working with VFX supe Sara Bennett, who co-founded London’s Milk VFX?\n\nRight from the start we talked about authenticity and that all the VFX had to help build this historical epic and the world of 1823 in West Africa. It all had to look real, not just in terms of removing anything modern in the frame, but in terms of the VFX feeling totally part of the environment. Sara completely embraced that. We did a ton of research, and she also worked very closely with the production designer and pulled from the artwork and illustrations we had.\n\nWhen people think of “world-building” they tend to think of the huge Marvel movies, but anytime you create a world people haven’t seen – whether it’s Braveheart or Gladiator – you go through the same highly detailed process to make all the VFX as seamless as possible.\n\nSara was on-set for the whole shoot, which was very important because she’d let me know if something would work or not. Then she came back here to LA for post and stayed all the way through our first preview, which was also very important because often the VFX tell the story even if they’re not finished. So I gave her my wish list of the VFX shots I wanted finished for that preview and my cut for the studio, and she worked with her team and did some postviz for a lot of the VFX that’d help with the storytelling.\n\nWe did have a lot of VFX, and Sara and Milk did the bulk of the work, but there was so much to do that we also had some other vendors, including Egg VFX, Untold Studios, Nexodus, Host VFX, Jellyfish and Clear Angle.\n\nHow involved are you in the DI and how important is it to you?\n\nI love the DI, and it’s so crucial. I like to discuss the look and then give the colorist and the DP a week to work on it together before I go in. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the choices available to you, and it’s such a specific talent they bring to the DI. We did it with colorist Walter Volpatto at Company 3.\n\nWe had a great LUT on-set, and we’re enhancing that and making sure the women all look beautiful and that the colors are rich and full for all those kingdom scenes. There’s also a whole different element of the city where the slave trade is centered. We wanted that to look far grittier and harsher, so we were working on the contrast between those two very different worlds. I’m really happy with how the film’s turned out.\n\nIndustry insider Iain Blair has been interviewing the biggest directors in Hollywood and around the world for years. He is a regular contributor to Variety and has written for such outlets as Reuters, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe.\n\nBy Randi Altman\n\nSony Pictures’ Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse isn’t your ordinary Spider-Man movie, from its story to its look to its sound. The filmmakers took a familiar story and turned it on its head a bit, letting audiences know that Spider-Man isn’t just one guy wearing that mask… or even a guy, or even from this dimension.\n\nThe film focuses on Miles Morales, a teenager from Brooklyn, struggling with all things teenager while also dealing with the added stress of being Spider-Man.\n\nAudio played a huge role in this story, and we recently reached out to Sony supervising sound editors Geoff Rubay and Curt Schulkey to dig in a bit deeper. The duo recently won an MPSE Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing — Feature Animation… industry peers recognizing the work that went into creating the sound for this stylized world.\n\nLet’s find out more about the sound process on Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse, which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\nWhat do you think is the most important element of this film’s sound?\n\nCurt Schulkey: It is fun, it is bold, it has style and it has attitude. It has energy. We did everything we could to make the sound as stylistic and surprising as the imagery. We did that while supporting the story and the characters, which are the real stars of the movie. We had the opportunity to work with some incredibly creative filmmakers, and we did our best to surprise and delight them. We hope that audiences like it too.\n\nGeoff Rubay: For me, it’s the fusion of the real and the fantastic. Right from the beginning, the filmmakers made it clear that it should feel believable — grounded — while staying true to the fantastic nature of the visuals. We did not hold back on the fantastic side, but we paid close attention to the story and made sure we were supporting that and not just making things sound awesome.\n\nHow early did your team get involved in the film?\n\nRubay: We started on an SFX pre-design phase in late February for about a month. The goal was to create sounds for the picture editors and animators to work with. We ended up doing what amounted to a temp mix of some key sequences. The “Super Collider” was explored. We only worked on the first sequence for the collider, but the idea was that material could be recycled by the picture department and used in the early temp mixes until the final visuals arrived.\n\nJustin Thompson, the production designer, was very generous with his time and resources early on. He spent several hours showing us work-in-progress visuals and concept art so that we would know where visuals would eventually wind up. This was invaluable. We were able to work on sounds long before we saw them as part of the movie. In the temp mix phase, we had to hold back or de-emphasize some of those elements because they were not relevant yet. In some cases, the sounds would not work at all with the storyboards or un-lit animation that was in the cut. Only when the final lit animation showed up would those sounds make sense.\n\nSchulkey: I came onto the film in May, about 9.5 months before completion. We were neck-deep in following changes throughout our work. We were involved in the creation of sounds from the very first studio screening, through previews and temp mixes, right on to the end of the final mix. This sometimes gave us the opportunity to create sounds in advance of the images, or to influence the development of imagery and timing. Because they were so involved in building the movie, the directors did not always have time to discuss their needs with us, so we would speculate on what kinds of sounds they might need or want for events that they were molding visually. As Geoff said, the time that Justin Thompson spent with us was invaluable. The temp-mix process often gave us the opportunity to audition creations for the directors/producers.\n\nWhat sort of direction did you receive from the directors?\n\nSchulkey: Luckily, because of our previous experiences with producers Chris Miller and Phil Lord and editor Bob Fisher, we had a pretty good idea of their tastes and sensitivities, so our first attempts were usually pointed in the right direction. The three directors — Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman — also provided input, so we were rich with direction.\n\nAs with all movies, we had hundreds of side discussions with the directors along the way about details, nuances, timing and so on. I think that the most important overall direction we got from the filmmakers was related to the dynamic arc of the movie. They wanted the soundtrack to be forceful but not so much that it hurt. They wanted it to breathe — quiet in some spots, loud in others, and they wanted it to be fun. So, we had to figure out what “fun” sounds like.\n\nRubay: This will sound strange, but we never did a spotting session for the movie. We just started our work and got feedback when we showed sequences or did temp mixes. Phil called when we started the pre-design phase and gave us general notes about tone and direction. He made it clear he did not want us to hold back, but he wanted to keep the film grounded. He explained the importance of the various levels of technology of different characters.\n\nPeni Parker is from the 31st century, so her robot sidekick needed to sound futuristic. Scorpion is a pile of rusty metal. Prowler’s tech is appropriated from his surroundings and possibly with some help from Kingpin. We discussed the sound of previous Spider-Man movies and asked how much we needed to stay true to established sounds from those films. The direction was “not at all unless it makes sense.” We endeavored to make Peter Parker’s web-slings sound like the previous films. After that, we just “went for it.”\n\nHow was working on a film like this different than working on something live-action? Did it allow you more leeway?\n\nSchulkey: In a live-action film, most or all of the imagery is shot before we begin working. Many aspects of the sound are already stamped in. On this film, we had a lot more creative involvement. At the start, a good percentage of the movie was still in storyboards, so if we expanded or contracted the timing of an event, the animators might adjust their work to fit the sounds. As the visual elements developed, we began creating layers of sound to support them.\n\nFor me, one of the best parts of an animated film’s soundtrack is that no sounds are imposed by the real world, as is often the case in live-action productions. In live-action, if a dialogue scene is shot on a city street in Brooklyn, there is a lot of uninteresting traffic noise built into the dialogue recordings.\n\nVery few directors (or actors) want to lose the spontaneity of the original performance by re-recording dialogue in a studio, so we tweak, clean and process the dialogue to lessen unwanted noise, sometimes diminishing the quality of the recording. We sometimes make compromises with sound effects and music to support a not-so-ideal dialogue track. In an animated film, we don’t have that problem. Sound effects and ambiences can shine without getting in the way. This film has very quiet moments, which feel very natural and organic. That’s a pleasure to have in the movie.\n\nRubay: Everything Curt said! You have quite a bit of freedom because there is no “production track.” On the flip side, every sound that is added is just that — added. You have to be aware of that; more is not always better.\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animated film with a unique visual style. At times, we played the effects straight, as we might in a live-action picture, to ground it. Other times, we stripped away any notion of “reality.” Sometimes we would do both in the same scene as we cut from one angle to the next. Chris and Phil have always welcomed hard right angle turns, snapping sounds off on a cut or mixing and matching styles in close proximity. They like to do whatever supports the story and directs the audience. Often, we use sound to make your eye notice one thing or look away from another. Other times, we expand the frame, adding sounds outside of what you can see to further enhance the image.\n\nThere are many characters in the film. Can you talk about helping to create personality for each?\n\nRubay: There was a lot of effort made to differentiate the various “spider people” from each other. Whether it was through their web-slings or inherent technology, we were directed to give as much individual personality as possible to each character. Since that directive was baked in from the beginning, every department had it in mind. We paid attention to every visual cue. For example, Miles wears a particular pair of shoes — Nike Air Jordan 1s. My son, Alec Rubay, who was the Foley supervisor, is a real sneakerhead. He tracked down those shoes — very rare — and we recorded them, capturing every sound we could. When you hear Miles’s shoes squeak, you are hearing the correct shoes. Those shoes sound very specific. We applied that mentality wherever possible.\n\nSchulkey: We took the opportunity to exploit the fact that some characters are from different universes in making their sound signatures different from one another. Spider-Ham is from a cartoon universe, so many of the sounds he makes are cartoon sounds. Sniffles, punches, swishes and other movements have a cartoon sensibility. Peni Parker, the anime character, is in a different sync than the rest of the cast, and her voice is somewhat more dynamic. We experimented with making Spider-Man Noir sound like he was coming from an old movie soundtrack, but that became obnoxious, so we abandoned the idea. Nicolas Cage was quite capable of conveying that aspect of the character without our help.\n\nBecause we wanted to ground characters in the real world, a lot of effort was put into attaching their voices to their images. Sync, of course, is essential, as is breathing. Characters in most animated films don’t do much breathing, but we added a lot of breaths, efforts and little stutters to add realism. That had to be done carefully. We had a very special, stellar cast and we wanted to maintain the integrity of their performances. I think that effort shows up nicely in some of the more intimate, personal scenes.\n\nTo create the unique look of this movie, the production sometimes chose to animate sections of the film “on twos.” That means that mouth movements change every other frame rather than every frame, so sync can be harder than usual to pinpoint. I worked closely with director Bob Persichetti to get dialogue to look in its best sync, doing careful reviews and special adjustments, as needed, on all dialogue in the film.\n\nThe main character in this Spider-Man thread is Miles Morales, a brilliant African-American/Puerto Rican Brooklyn teenager trying to find his way in his multi-cultural world. We took special care to show his Puerto Rican background with added Spanish-language dialogue from Miles and his friends. That required dialect coaches, special record sessions and thorough review.\n\nThe group ADR required a different level of care than most films. We created voices for crowds, onlookers and the normal “general” wash of voices for New York City. Our group voices covered many very specific characters and were cast in detail by our group leader, Caitlin McKenna. We took a very realistic approach to crowd activity. It had to be subtler than most live-action films to capture the dry nonchalance of Miles Morales’s New York.\n\nWould you describe the sounds as realistic? Fantastical? Both?\n\nSchulkey: The sounds are fantastically realistic. For my money, I don’t want the sounds in my movie to seem fantastical. I see our job as creating an illusion for the audience — the illusion that they are hearing what they are seeing, and that what they are seeing is real. This is an animated film, where nothing is actually real, but has its own reality. The sounds need to live in the world we are watching. When something fantastical happens in the movie’s reality, we had to support that illusion, and we sometimes got to do fun stuff. I don’t mean to say that all sounds had to be realistic.\n\nFor example, we surmised that an actual supercollider firing up below the streets of Brooklyn would sound like 10,000 computer fans. Instead, we put together sounds that supported the story we were telling. The ambiences were as authentic as possible, including subway tunnels, Brooklyn streets and school hallways. Foley here was a great tool for giving reality to animated images. When Miles walks into the cemetery at night, you hear his footsteps on snow and sidewalk, gentle cloth movements and other subtle touches. This adds to a sense that he’s a real kid in a real city. Other times, we were in the Spider-Verse and our imagination drove the work.\n\nRubay: The visuals led the way, and we did whatever they required. There are some crazy things in this movie. The supercollider is based on a real thing so we started there. But supercolliders don’t act as they are depicted in the movie. In reality, they sound like a giant industrial site, fans and motors, but nothing so distinct or dramatic, so we followed the visuals.\n\nSpider-sense is a kind of magical realism that supports, informs, warns, communicates, etc. There is no realistic basis for any of that, so we went with directions about feelings. Some early words of direction were “warm,” “organic,” “internal” and “magical.” Because there are no real sounds for those words, we created sounds that conveyed the emotional feelings of those ideas to the audience.\n\nThe portals that allow spider-people to move between dimensions are another example. Again, there was no real-world event to link to. We saw the visuals and assumed it should be a pretty big deal, real “force of nature” stuff. However, it couldn’t simply be big. We took big, energetic sounds and glued them onto what we were seeing. Of course, sometimes people are talking at the same time, so we shifted the frequency center of the moment to clear for the dialog. As music is almost always playing, we had to look for opportunities within the spaces it left.\n\nCan you talk about working on the action scenes?\n\nRubay: For me, when the action starts, the sound had to be really specific. There is dialogue for sure. The music is often active. The guiding philosophy for me at that point is not “Keep adding until there is nothing left to add,” rather, it’s, “We’re done when there is nothing left to strip out.” Busy action scene? Broom the backgrounds away. Usually, we don’t even cut BG’s in a busy action scene, but, if we do, we do so with a skeptical eye. How can we make it more specific? Also, I keep a keen eye on “scale.” One wrong, small detail sound, no matter how cool or interesting, will get the broom if it throws off the scale. Sometimes everything might be sounding nice and big; impressive but not loud, just big, and then some small detail creeps in and spoils it. I am constantly looking out for that.\n\nThe “Prowler Chase” scene was a fun exploration. There are times where the music takes over and runs; we pull out every sound we can. Other times, the sound effects blow over everything. It is a matter of give and take. There is a truck/car/prowler motorcycle crash that turns into a suspended slo-mo moment. We had to decide which sounds to play where and when. Its stripped-down nature made it among my favorite moments in the picture.\n\nCan you talk about the multiple universes?\n\nRubay: The multiverse presented many challenges. It usually manifested itself as a portal or something we move between. The portals were energetic and powerful. The multiverse “place” was something that we used as a quiet place. We used it to provide contrast because, usually, there was big action on either side.\n\nA side effect of the multiple universes interacting was a buildup or collision/overlap. When universes collide or overlap, matter from each tries to occupy the same space. Visually, this created some very interesting moments. We referred to the multi-colored prismatic-looking stuff as “Picasso” moments. The supporting sound needed to convey “force of nature” and “hard edges,” but couldn’t be explosive, loud or gritty. Ultimately, it was a very multi-layered sound event: some “real” sounds teamed with extreme synthesis. I think it worked.\n\nSchulkey: Some of the characters in the movie are transported from another dimension into the dimension of the movie, but their bodies rebel, and from time to time their molecules try to jump back to their native dimension, causing “glitching.” We developed, with a combination of plug-ins, blending, editing and panning, a signature sound that served to signal glitching throughout the movie, and was individually applied for each iteration.\n\nWhat stands out in your mind as the most challenging scenes audio wise?\n\nRubay: There is a very quiet moment between Miles and his dad when dad is on one side of the door and Miles is on the other. It’s a very quiet, tender one-way conversation. When a movie gets that quiet every sound counts. Every detail has to be perfect.\n\nWhat about the Dolby Atmos mix? How did that enhance the film? Can you give a scene or two as an example?\n\nSchulkey: This film was a native Atmos mix, meaning that the primary final mix was directly in the Atmos format, as opposed to making a 7.1 mix and then going back to re-mix sections using the Atmos format.\n\nThe native Atmos mix allowed us a lot more sonic room in the theater. This is an extremely complex and busy mix, heavily driven by dialogue. By moving the score out into the side and surround speakers — away from the center speaker — we were able to make the dialogue clearer and still have a very rich and exciting score. Sonic movement is much more effective in this format. When we panned sounds around the room, it felt more natural than in other formats.\n\nRubay: Atmos is fantastic. Being able to move sounds vertically creates so much space, so much interest, that might otherwise not be there. Also, the level and frequency response of the surround channels makes a huge difference.\n\nYou guys used Avid Pro Tools for editing, can you mention some other favorite tools you employed on this film?\n\nSchulkey : The Delete key and the Undo key.\n\nRubay: Pitch ‘n’ Time, Envy, Reverbs by Exponential Audio, Recording rigs and microphones of all sorts.\n\nWhat haven’t I asked that’s important?\n\nOur crew! Just in case anyone thinks this can be done by two people, it can’t.\n\n– re-recording mixers Michael Semanick and Tony Lamberti\n\n– sound designer John Pospisil\n\n– dialogue editors James Morioka and Matthew Taylor\n\n– sound effects editors David Werntz, Kip Smedley, Andy Sisul, Chris Aud, Donald Flick, Benjamin Cook, Mike Reagan and Ando Johnson\n\n– Foley mixer Randy Singer\n\n– Foley artists Gary Hecker, Michael Broomberg and Rick Owens\n\nBy Randi Altman\n\nSony Pictures’ Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not your typical Spider-Man film… in so many ways. The most obvious is the movie’s look, which was designed to make the viewer feel they are walking inside a comic book. This tale, which blends CGI with 2D hand-drawn animation and comic book textures, focuses on a Brooklyn teen who is bitten by a radioactive spider on the subway and soon develops special powers.\n\nWhen he meets Peter Parker, he realizes he’s not alone in the Spider-Verse. It was co-directed by Peter Ramsey, Robert Persichetti Jr. and Rodney Rothman and produced by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the pair behind 21 Jump Street and The Lego Movie.\n\nEfilm senior colorist Natasha Leonnet provided the color finish for the film, which was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Animated Feature category. We reached out to find out more.\n\nHow early were you brought on the film?\n\nI had worked on Angry Birds with visual effects supervisor Danny Dimian, which is how I was brought onto the film. It was a few months before we started color correction. Also, there was no LUT for the film. They used the ACES workflow, developed by The Academy and Efilm’s VP of technology, Joachim “JZ” Zell.\n\nCan you talk about the kind of look they were after and what it took to achieve that look?\n\nThey wanted to achieve a comic book look. You look at the edges of characters or objects in comic books and you actually see aspects of the color printing from the beginning of comic book printing — the CMYK dyes wouldn’t all be the same line — it creates a layered look along with the comic book dots and expression lines on faces, as if you’re drawing a comic book.\n\nFor example, if someone gets hurt you put actual slashes on their face. For me it was a huge education about the comic book art form. Justin Thompson, the art director, in particular is so knowledgeable about the history of comic books. I was so inspired I just bought my first comic book. Also, with the overall look, the light is painting color everywhere the way it does in life.\n\nYou worked closely Justin, VFX supervisor Danny Dimian and art director Dean Gordon What was that process like?\n\nThey were incredible. It was usually a group of us working together during the color sessions — a real exercise in collaboration. They were all so open to each other’s opinions and constantly discussing every change in order to make certain that the change best served the film. There was no idea that was more important than another idea. Everyone listened to each other’s ideas.\n\nHad you worked on an animated film previously? What are the challenges and benefits of working with animation?\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to do all of Blue Sky Studios’ color finishes so far, except for the first Ice Age. One of the special aspects of working on animated films is that you’re often working with people who are fine-art painters. As a result, they bring in a different background and way of analyzing the images. That’s really special. They often focus on the interplay of different hues.\n\nIn the case of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, they also wanted to bring a certain naturalism to the color experience. With this particular film, they made very bold choices with their use of color finishing. They used an aspect of color correctors that are used to shift all of the hues and colors; that’s usually reserved for music videos. They completely embraced it. They were basically using color finishing to augment the story and refine their hues, especially time of day and progression of the day or night. They used it as their extra lighting step.\n\nCan you talk about your typical process? Did that differ because of the animated content?\n\nMy process actually does not differ when I’m color finishing animated content. Continuity is always at the forefront, even in animation. I use the color corrector as a creative tool on every project.\n\nHow would you describe the look of the film?\n\nThe film embodies the vivid and magical colors that I always observed in childhood but never saw reflected on the screen. The film is very color intense. It’s as if you’re stepping inside a comic book illustrator’s mind. It’s a mind-meld with how they’re imagining things.\n\nWhat system did you use for color and why?\n\nI used Resolve on this project, as it was the system that the clients were most familiar with.\n\nAny favorite parts of the process?\n\nMy favorite part is from start to finish. It was all magical on this film.\n\nWhat was your path to being a colorist?\n\nMy parents loved going to the cinema. They didn’t believe in babysitters, so they took me to everything. They were big fans of the French new wave movement and films that offered unconventional ways of depicting the human experience. As a result, I got to see some pretty unusual films. I got to see how passionate my parents were about these films and their stories and unusual way of telling them, and it sparked something in me. I think I can give my parents full credit for my career.\n\nI studied non-narrative experimental filmmaking in college even though ultimately my real passion was narrative film. I started as a runner in the Czech Republic, which is where I’d made my thesis film for my BA degree. From there I worked my way up and met a colorist (Biggi Klier) who really inspired me. I was hooked and lucky enough to study with her and another mentor of mine in Munich, Germany.\n\nHow do you prefer a director and DP describe a look?\n\nEvery single person I’ve worked with works differently, and that’s what makes it so fun and exciting, but also challenging. Every person communicates about color differently and our vocabulary for color is so limited, therein lies the challenge.\n\nWhere do you find inspiration?\n\nFrom both the natural world and the world of films. I live in a place that faces east, and I get up every morning to watch the sunrise and the color palette is always different. It’s beautiful and inspiring. The winter palettes in particular are gorgeous, with reds and oranges that don’t exist in summer sunrises.\n\nBy Iain Blair\n\nWriting and movies have always been in director/writer Dan Gilroy’s DNA. The son of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Frank Gilroy, he has two brothers who’re also in the business — director/writer Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton, the Bourne franchise) and editor John Gilroy.\n\nAfter making a name for himself as a successful screenwriter on such projects as The Bourne Legacy, Real Steel and Two for the Money, he made his feature directorial debut with Nightcrawler in 2014. He also wrote the film, which starred Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed. Nightcrawler earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nHis film, Roman J. Israel, Esq., which earned its star Denzel Washington an Academy Award nomination and recognition from the Golden Globe and SAG, is another intense character study. Set in the underbelly of the overburdened Los Angeles criminal court system, it stars Denzel Washington as a driven, idealistic defense attorney whose life is upended after his boss and mentor, a civil rights icon, dies. When Roman is recruited to join a law firm led by one of the legendary man’s former students — the ambitious George Pierce (Colin Farrell) — and begins a friendship with a young champion of equal rights (Carmen Ejogo), a series of events ensues that put the activism that has defined Roman’s career to the test.\n\nCollaborating with Gilroy behind the scenes was director of photography Robert Elswit, editor John Gilroy, production designer Kevin Kavanaugh and costume designer Francine Jamison-Tanchuck.\n\nI recently talked with Gilroy about making the film and collaborating with Washington.\n\nIs it true you wrote the film on spec specifically for Denzel?\n\nI did. After Nightcrawler I took myself off the market for a year, researched this and wrote it on spec. I could only ever see Denzel playing Israel.\n\nWould you have still done it without him?\n\nNo, I would have just put it away. He was crucial to the film. You have to take a pill with every movie and buy into the premise, and on this you had to believe that for 40 years he’s toiled away in the shadows and never compromised his beliefs. And Denzel utterly transformed himself physically for the role, but he’s also a man of faith who believes in something bigger than himself.\n\nWhat did he bring to the role?\n\nApart from being this incredibly gifted actor, he brought a deep conviction to the part.\n\nWhat sort of themes were you interested in exploring through this?\n\nMy biggest struggle is with my conscience. Am I doing enough? And this was a chance to examine activism, which can take a big emotional toll, but then you also know that you’re helping make the world a better place. That’s one of the key themes of the film — the importance of belief. It’s an homage to activism and to anyone who dedicates some of their time to a cause other than themselves. That sort of belief can be both a blessing and a burden, as it can get you up in the morning to fight for something, but it can also sap you.\n\nWhy did you shoot 35mm rather than digital?\n\nWe wanted that great film look, even though it’s very expensive to shoot that way now. Denzel and I actually shared the added cost.\n\nDoesn’t that affect the post workflow nowadays?\n\nYou’re right, it does, as you have to find a lab that can still handle film as everyone’s so used to digital now, and you have a slight delay in dailies — 24 hours. But apart from that, there’s not much interruption to the flow. One big thing it does is cut way down on the footage you have to deal with in editing and post. When you shoot digitally, you don’t think twice about doing 10 or 15 takes in a row. You don’t do that with film. You’re far more careful and specific about what you shoot.\n\nYou shot all on location downtown. How tough was that?\n\nVery tough. We had over 60 locations, and unlike Nightcrawler it was nearly all daytime, and the traffic is just brutal and makes it very hard just moving around. I always wanted to put the character in real-world situations, so sometimes we’d hide cameras down alleyways and behind cars and shoot stuff as if it was surveillance footage. Denzel would be walking around and people would bump into him and not give him a second glance — and those weren’t extras.\n\nWhere did you post?\n\nOn the Sony lot. We did all the sound at Formosa.\n\nDo you like the post process?\n\nI absolutely love it. You have all the pieces in front of you, and they haven’t hardened yet. They’re malleable, and you can do anything you want and rewrite the whole movie in post if you want. You can pre-lap dialogue, you can intercut and do so many things that have a profound impact on the flow of the story. You can speed up stuff and slow it down by the way you cut and use transitions, and give scenes a whole new energy. Post is amazing.\n\nYou edited again with your brother John, who cut Nightcrawler. How did that work?\n\nHe read the script before we began shooting, and then he was on the set and then we worked side-by-side on the assembly. He’s like my right arm. (See our interview with John.)\n\nWhat were the main challenges of editing this film?\n\nThe time! We were running long and had to keep cutting. We went to the Toronto Film Festival with it and screened it at 2 hours 14 minutes, but that was still too long, so we had to go back and cut another 13 minutes… that was very tough to do.\n\nI heard Denzel was also involved in the edit.\n\nIt’s true, he was. Isn’t that crazy? Normally I couldn’t have even conceived of having an actor come into the cutting room and doing that, because most actors are just not objective. But Denzel is such an asset, and he truly is objective and has an incredible eye. Of course, he’s directed films himself, so it made perfect sense to keep collaborating in the edit.\n\nHow many visual effects shots were there and who did them?\n\nZero VFX did them, and there were quite a few. The biggest VFX shot — which originally was going to be done practically — was when we dropped down 400 feet at night into this alley. We planned to do it with a drone, so we sent it up with an Alexa on it, but it was wet and windy that night and it just didn’t work, so we had to redo it all in post. The apartment building they’re constructing next to Israel’s building was all a big VFX shot, and we had a lot of smaller shots and clean-up and so on.\n\nIt has a great soundtrack. Can you talk about the importance of music and sound?\n\nThey’re so important to me, and they’re a huge percentage of the final film. Music can instantly transport you to other levels and places and change the whole emotional fabric of a scene. Denzel was very involved in that too. He has over 20,000 songs on his iPod and he came up with specific songs that would be the soundtrack to Roman’s life — songs from the ‘60s and ‘70s — and picked a lot of the cues. James Newton Howard, who did Nightcrawler, did the film score.\n\nHow about the DI?\n\nWe did it at Company 3 in LA with Stefan Sonnenfeld who has worked a lot with Tony. I’m very involved in about 85% of it, and then I leave the last 15% to the DP and my brother John. I love the DI as you can go in and highlight small details and play around with the look and color so much. It’s so creative.\n\nDid it turn out the way you hoped?\n\nIt’s beyond what I imagined when I was writing it, and I think Denzel’s performance is truly amazing.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nI’m in pre-production on a film for Netflix, a drama set in LA’s contemporary art world. It’s starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Renee Russo, and it’ll be out in October.\n\nIndustry insider Iain Blair has been interviewing the biggest directors in Hollywood and around the world for years. He is a regular contributor to Variety and has written for such outlets as Reuters, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe.\n\nBy Mel Lambert\n\nWriter/director Edgar Wright’s latest outing is a major departure from his normal offering of dark comedies. Unlike his Three Flavours Cornetto film trilogy — Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World’s End — and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, TriStar Pictures’ Baby Driver has been best described as a romantic musical disguised as a car-chase thriller.\n\nWright’s regular pair of London-based picture editors, Paul Machliss, ACE, and Jonathan Amos, ACE, also brought a special brand of magic to the production. Machliss, who had worked with Wright on Scott Pilgrim, The World’s End and his TV series Spaced for Channel 4, recalls that, “very early on, Edgar decided that I should come along on the shoot in Atlanta to ensure that we had the material he’d already storyboarded in a series of complex animatics for the film [using animator Steve Markowski and editor Evan Schiff]. Jon Amos joined us when we returned to London for sound and picture post production, primarily handling the action sequences, at which he excels.”\n\nDeveloped by Wright over the past two decades, Baby Driver tells the story of an eponymous getaway driver (Ansel Elgort), who uses earphones to drown out the “hum-in-the-drum” of tinnitus — the result of a childhood car accident — and to orchestrate his life to carefully chosen music. But now indebted to a sinister kingpin named Doc (Kevin Spacey), Baby becomes part of a seriously focused gang of bank robbers, including Buddy and Darling (Jon Hamm and Eiza González), Bats (Jamie Foxx) and Griff (Jon Bernthal). Debora, Baby’s love interest (Lily James), dreams of heading west “in a car I can’t afford, with a plan I don’t have.” Imagine, in a sense, Jim McBride’s Breathless rubbing metaphorical shoulders with Tony Scott’s True Romance.\n\nThe film also is indebted to Wright’s 2003 music video for Mint Royale’s Blue Song, during which UK comedian/actor Noel Fielding danced in a stationery getaway car. In that same vein, Baby Driver comprises a sequence of linked songs that tightly choreograph the action and underpin the dramatic arcs being played out, often keying off the songs’ lyrics.\n\nThe film’s opener, for example, features Elgort partly lipsyncing to “Bellbottoms,” by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, as the villains commit their first robbery. In subsequent scenes, our hero’s movements follow the opening bass riffs of The Damned’s “Neat Neat Neat,” then later to Golden Earring’s “Radar Love” before Queen’s “Brighton Rock” adds complex guitar cacophony to a key encounter scene.\n\nEven the film’s opening titles are accompanied by Baby performing a casual coffee run in a continuous three-minute take to Bob & Earl’s “Harlem Shuffle” — a scene that reportedly took 28 takes on the first day of practical photography in Atlanta. And the percussion and horns of “Tequila” provide syncopation for a protracted gunfight. Fold in “Egyptian Reggae,” “Unsquare Dance,” and “Easy,” followed by “Debora,” and it’s easy to appreciate that Wright is using music as a key and underpinning component of this film. The director also brought in music video choreographer Ryan Heffington to achieve the timing precision he needed.\n\nThe swift action is reflected in a fast style of editing, including whip pans and crash zooms, with cuts that are tightly synchronized to the music. “Whereas the majority of Edgar’s previous TV series and films have been parodies, for Baby Driver he had a very different idea,” explains Machliss. Wright had accumulated a playlist of over 30 songs that would inspire various scenes in his script. “It’s something that’s very much a part of my previous films,” says director Wright, “and I thought of this idea of how to take that a stage further by having a character who listens to music the entire time.”\n\n“Edgar had organized a table read of his script in the spring of 2012 in Los Angeles, at which he recorded all of the dialog,” says Machliss. “Taking that recording, some sound effects and the music tracks, I put together a 100-minute ‘radio play’ that was effectively the whole film in audio-only form that Edgar could then use as a selling tool to convince the studios that he had a viable idea. Remember, Baby Driver was a very different format for him and not what he is traditionally known for.”\n\nAustralia-native Machliss was on set to ensure that the gunshots, lighting effects, actors and camera movements, plus car hits, all happened to the beat of the accompanying music. “We were working with music that we could not alter or speed up or slow down,” he says. “We were challenged to make sure that each sequence fit in the time frame of the song, as well as following the cadence of the music.”\n\nAlmost 95% of music included in the first draft of Wright’s script made it into the final movie according to Machliss. “I laid up the relevant animatic as a video layer in my Avid Media Composer and then confirmed how each take worked against the choreographed timeline. This way I always had a reference to it as we were filming. It was a very useful guide to see if we were staying on track.”\n\nEditing On Location\n\nDuring the Atlanta shoot, Machliss used Apple ProRes digital files captured by an In2Core QTake video assist that was recording taps from the production’s 35mm cameras. “I connected to my Mac via Ethernet so I could create a network to the video assist’s storage. I had access to his QuickTime files the instant he stopped recording. I could use Avid’s AMA function to place the clip in the timeline without the need for transcoding. This allowed almost instantaneous feedback to Edgar as the sequence was built up.”\n\nWhile on location, Machliss used a 15-inch MacBook Pro, Avid Mojo DX and a JVC video monitor “which could double as a second screen for the Media Composer or show full-screen video output via the Mojo DX.” He also had a Wacom tablet, an 8TB Thunderbolt drive, a LaCie 500GB rugged drive — “which would shuttle my media between set and editorial” — and an APU “so that I wouldn’t lose power if the supply was shut down by the sparks!”\n\nLA’s Fotokem handled film processing, with negative scanning by Efilm. DNX files were sent to Company 3 in Atlanta for picture editorial, “where we would also review rushes in 2K sent down the line from Efilm,” says Machliss. “All DI on-lining and grading took place at Molinare in London.” Bill Pope, ASC, was the film’s director of photography.\n\nPicture and Sound Editorial in London\n\nInstead of hiring out editorial suites at a commercial facility in London, Wright and his post teams opted for a different approach. Like an increasing number of London-based productions, they elected to rent an entire floor in an office building.\n\nThey located a suitable location on Berners Street, north of the Soho-based film community. As Machliss recalls: “That allowed us to have the picture editorial team in the same space as the sound crew,” which was headed up by Wright’s long-time collaborator Julian Slater, who served as sound designer, supervising sound editor and re-recording engineer on Baby Driver. “Having ready access to Julian and his team meant that we could collaborate very closely — as we had on Edgar’s other films — and share ideas on a regular basis,” as the 10-week Director’s Cut progressed.\n\nBritish-born Slater then moved across Soho to Goldcrest Films for sound effects pre-dubs, while his co-mixer, Tim Cavagin, worked on dialog and Foley pre-mixes at Twickenham Studios. Print mastering of the Dolby Atmos soundtrack occurred in February 2017 at Goldcrest, with Slater handling music and SFX, while Cavagin oversaw dialog and Foley. “Following Edgar’s concept of threading together the highly choreographed songs with linking scenes, Jon and I began the cut in London against the pre-assembled material from Atlanta,” says Machliss.\n\nTo assist Machliss during his picture cut, the film’s sound designer had provided a series of audio stems for his Avid. “Julian [Slater] had been working on his sound effects and dialog elements since principal photography ended in Atlanta. He had prepared separate, color-coded left-center-right stems of the music, dialog and SFX elements he was working on. I laid these [high-quality tracks] into Media Composer so I could better appreciate the intricacies of Julian’s evolving soundtrack. It worked a lot better than a normal rough mix of production dialog, rough sound effects and guide music.”\n\n“From its inception, this was a movie for which music and sound design worked together as a whole piece,” Slater recalls. “There is a large amount of syncopation of the diegetic sounds [implied by the film’s action] to the music track Baby is listening to. Sometimes it’s obvious because the action was filmed with that purpose in mind. For example, walking in tempo to the music track or guns being fired in tempo. But many times it’s more subtle, including police sirens or distant trains that have been pitched and timed to the music,” and hence blend into the overall musical journey. “We strived to always do this to support the story, and to never distract from it.”\n\nBecause of the lead character’s tinnitus, Slater worked with pitch changes to interweave elements of the film’s soundtrack. “Whenever Baby is not listening to music, his tinnitus is present to some degree. But it became apparent very soon in our design process that strident, high-pitched ‘whistle tones’ would not work for a sustained period of time. Working closely with composer Steven Price, we developed a varied set of methods to convey the tinnitus — it’s rarely the same sound twice. Much of the time, the tinnitus is pitched according to either the outgoing or incoming music track. This then enabled us to use more of it, yet at the same time be quite subtle.”\n\nMeticulous Planning for Set Pieces and Car Chases\n\nPicture editor Amos joined the project at the start of the Director’s Cut to handle the film’s set pieces. He says, “These set pieces were conceptually very different from the vast majority of action scenes in that they were literally built up around the music and then visualized. Meticulous development and planning went into these sequences before the shoot even began, which was decisive in making the action become musical. For example, the ‘Tequila’ gunfight started as a piece of music by Button Down Brass. It was then laced with gunfire and SFX pitched to the music, and in time with the drum hits — this was done at the script stage by Mark Nicholson (aka, Osymyso, a UK musician/DJ) who specializes in mashup/bastard pop and breakbeat.”\n\nStoryboards then grew around this scripted sound collage, which became a precise shot list for the filmed sequences. “Guns were rigged to go off in time with the music; it was all a very deliberate thing,” adds Amos. “Clearly, there was a lot of editing still to be done, but this approach illustrates that there’s a huge difference between something that is shot and edited to music, and something that is built around the music.”\n\n“All the car chases for Baby Driver were meticulously planned, and either prevised or storyboarded,” Amos explains. “This ensured that the action would always fit into the time slot permitted within the music. The first car chase [against the song ‘Bellbottoms’] is divided into 13 sections, to align to different progressions in the music. One of the challenges resulted from the decision to never edit the music, which meant that none of these could overrun. Stunts were tested and filmed by second unit director Darrin Prescott, and the footage passed back to editorial to test against the timing allowed in the animatic. If a stunt couldn’t be achieved in the time allowed, it was revised and tweaked until it worked. This detailed planning gave the perfect backbone to the sequences.”\n\nAmos worked on the sequences sequentially, “using the animatic and Paul’s on-set assembly as reference,” and began to break down all the footage into rolls that aligned to specific passages of the music. “There was a vast amount of footage for all the set pieces, and things are not always shot in order. So generally I spent a lot of time breaking the material down very methodically. I then began to make selects and started to build the sequences from scratch, section by section. Once I completed a pass, I spent some time building up my sound layers. I find this helps evolve the cut, generating another level of picture ideas that further tighten the syncopation of sound and picture.”\n\nAmos’ biggest challenge, despite all the planning, was finding ways to condense the material into its pre-determined time slot. “The real world never moves quite like animatics and boards. We had very specific points in every track where certain actions had to take place; we called these anchor points. When working on a section, we would often work backwards from the anchor point knowing, for instance, that we only had 20 seconds to tell a particular part of the story. Initially, it can seem quite restrictive, but the edits become so precise.\n\n“The time restriction led to a level of kineticism and syncopation that became a defining feature of the movie. While the music may be the driving force of the action scenes, editorial choices were always rooted in the story and the characters. If you lose sight of the characters, the audience will disengage with the sequence, and you’ll lose all the tension you’ve worked so hard to create. Every shot choice was therefore very considered, and we worked incredibly hard to ensure we never wasted a frame, telling the story in the most compelling, rhythmic and entertaining way we could.”\n\n“Once we had our cut,” Machliss summarizes, “we could return the tracks to Julian for re-conforming,” to accommodate edit changes. “It was an excellent way of working, with full-sounding edit mixes.”\n\nSumming up his experience in Baby Driver, Machliss considers the film to be “the hardest job I’ve ever done, but the most fun I’ve ever had. Ultimately, our task was to create a film that on one level could be purely enjoyed as an exciting/dramatic piece of cinema, but, on repeated viewing, would reveal all the little elements ‘under the surface’ that interlock together — which makes the film unique. It’s a testament to Edgar’s singular vision and, in that regard, he is a tremendously exciting director to work with.”\n\nMel Lambert has been involved with production industries on both sides of the Atlantic for more years than he cares to remember.

He is also a long-time member of the UK’s National Union of Journalists.\n\nPanels focus on specifics of music, effects and dialog sound design, and immersive soundtracks\n\nBy Mel Lambert\n\nDefining a sound designer as somebody “who uses sound to tell stories,” Mark Mangini, MPSE, was adamant that “sound editors and re-recording mixers should be authors of a film’s content, and take creative risks. Art doesn’t get made without risk.”\n\nA sound designer/re-recording mixer at Hollywood’s Formosa Group Features, Mangini outlined his sound design philosophy during a keynote speech at the recent The Art of Sound Design: Music, Effects and Dialog in an Immersive World conference, which took place at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City.\n\nMangini is recipient of three Academy Award nominations for The Fifth Element (1997), Aladdin (1992) and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986).\n\nAcknowledging that an immersive soundtrack should fully engage the audience, Mangini outlined two ways to achieve that goal. “Physically, we can place sound around an audience, but we also need to engage them emotionally with the narrative, using sound to tell the story,” he explained to the 500-member audience. “We all need to better understand the role that sound plays in the filmmaking process. For me, sound design is storytelling — that may sound obvious, but it’s worth reminding ourselves on a regular basis.”\n\nWhile an understanding of the tools available to a sound designer is important, Mangini readily concedes, “Too much emphasis on technology keeps us out of the conversation; we are just seen as technicians. Sadly, we are all too often referred to as ‘The Sound Guy.’ How much better would it be for us if the director asked to speak with the ‘Audiographer,’ for example. Or the ‘Director of Sound’ or the ‘Sound Artist?’ — terms that better describe what we actually do? After all, we don’t refer to a cinematographer as ‘The Image Guy.’”\n\nMangini explained that he always tries to emphasize the why and not the how, and is not tempted to imitate somebody else’s work. “After all, when you imitate you ensure that you will only be ‘almost’ as good as the person or thing you imitate. To understand the ‘why,’ I break down the script into story arcs and develop a sound script so I can reference the dramatic beats rather than the visual cues, and articulate the language of storytelling using sound.”\n\nPast Work\n\nOffering up examples of his favorite work as a soundtrack designer, Mangini provided two clips during his keynote. “While working on Star Trek [in 2009] with supervising sound editor Mark Stoeckinger, director J. J. Abrams gave me two days to prepare — with co-designer Mark Binder — a new soundtrack for the two-minute mind meld sequence. J. J. wanted something totally different from what he already had. We scrapped the design work we did on the first day, because it was only different, not better. On day two we rethought how sound could tell the story that J. J. wanted to tell. Having worked on three previous Star Trek projects [different directors], I was familiar with the narrative. We used a complex combination of orchestral music and sound effects that turned the sequence on its head; I’m glad to say that J. J. liked what we did for his film.”\n\nThe two collaborators received the following credit: “Mind Meld Soundscape by Mark Mangini and Mark Binder.”\n\nTurning to his second soundtrack example, Mangini recalled receiving a call from Australia about the in-progress soundtrack for George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road, the director’s fourth outing with the franchise. “The mix they had prepared in Sydney just wasn’t working for George. I was asked to come down and help re-invigorate the track. One of the obstacles to getting this mix off the ground was the sheer abundance of material to choose from. When you have so many choices on a soundtrack, the mix can be an agonizing process of ‘Sound Design by Elimination.’ We needed to tell him, ‘Abandon what you have and start over.’ It was up to me, as an artist, to tell George that his V8 needed an overhaul and not just a tune-up!”\n\n“We had 12 weeks, working at Formosa with co-supervising sound editor Scott Hecker — and at Warner Bros Studios with re-recording mixers Chris Jenkins and Greg Rudloff — to come up with what George Miller was looking for. We gave each vehicle [during the extended car-chase sequence that opens the film] a unique character with sound, and carefully defined [the lead proponent Max Rockatansky’s] changing mental state during the film. The desert chase became ‘Moby Dick,’ with the war rig as the white whale. We focused on narrative decisions as we reconstructed the soundtrack, always referencing ‘the why’ for our design choices in order to provide a meaningful sonic immersion. Miller has been quoted as saying, ‘Mad Max is a film where we see with our ears.’ This from a director who has been making films for 40 years!”\n\nHis advice to fledgling sound designers? Mangini kept it succinct: “Ask yourself why, not how. Be the author of content, take risks, tell stories.”\n\nCreating a Sonic Immersive Experience\n\nSubsequent panels during the all-day conference addressed how to design immersive music, sound effects and dialog elements used on film and TV soundtracks. For many audiences, a 5.1-channel format is sufficient for carrying music, effects and dialog in an immersive, surround experience, but 7.1-channel — with added side speakers, in addition to the new Dolby Atmos, Barco/Auro 3D and DTS:X/MDA formats — can extend that immersive experience.\n\n“During editorial for Guardians of the Galaxy we had so many picture changes that the re-recording mixers needed all of the music stems and breakouts we could give them,” said music editor Will Kaplan, MPSE, from Warner Bros. Studio Facilities, during the “Music: Composing, Editing and Mixing Beyond 5.1” panel. It was presented by Formosa Group and moderated by scoring mixer Dennis Sands, CAS. “In a quieter movie we can deliver an entire orchestral track that carries the emotion of a scene.”\n\nDescribing his collaboration with Tim Burton, music editor Bill Abbott, MPSE from Formosa reported that the director “liked to hear an entire orchestral track for its energy, and then we recorded it section by section with the players remaining on the stage, which can get expensive!”\n\nJoseph Magee, CAS, (supervising music mixer on such films as Pitch Perfect 2, The Wedding Ringer, Saving Mr. Banks and The Muppets) likes to collaborate closely with the effects editor to decide who handles which elements from each song. “Who gets the snaps and dance shoes How do we divide up the synchronous ambience and the design ambience? The synchronous ambience from the set might carry tails from the sing-offs, and needs careful matching. What if they pitch shift the recorded music in post? We then need to change the pitch of the music captured in the audience mics using DAW plug-ins.”\n\n“I like to invite the sound designer to the music spotting session,” advised Abbott, “and discuss who handles what — is it a music cue or a sound effect?”\n\n“We need to immerse audiences with sound and use the surrounds for musical elements,” explained Formosa’s re-recording mixer, Andy Koyama, CAS. “That way we have more real estate in the front channels for sound effects.”\n\n“We should get the sound right on the set because it can save a lot of processing time on the dub stage,” advised production mixer Lee Orloff, CAS, during the “A Dialog on Dialog: From Set to Screen” panel moderated by Jeff Wexler, CAS.\n\n“I recall working on The Patriot, where the director [Roland Emmerich] chose to create ground mist using smoke machines known as a Smoker Boats,” recalled Orloff, who received Oscar and BAFTA Awards for Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). “The trouble was that they contained noisy lawnmower engines, whose sound can be heard under all of the dialog tracks. We couldn’t do anything about it! But, as it turned out, that low-level noise added to the sense of being there.”\n\n“I do all of my best work in pre-production,” added Wexler, “by working out the noise problems we will face on location. It is more than just the words that we capture; a properly recorded performance tells you so much about the character.”\n\n“I love it when the production track is full of dynamics,” added dialog/music re-recording mixer Gary Bourgeois, CAS. “The voice is an instrument; if I mask out everything that is not needed I lose the ‘essence’ of the character’s performance. The clarity of dialog is crucial.”\n\n“We have tools that can clean up dialog,” conceded supervising sound editor Marla McGuire, MPSE, “but if we apply them too often and too deeply it takes the life out of the track.”\n\n“Sound design can make an important scene more impactful, but you need to remember that you’re working in the service of the film,” advised sound designer/supervising sound editor Richard King, MPSE, during the “Sound Effects: How Far Can You Go?” moderated by David Bondelevitch, MPSE, CAS.\n\nIn terms of music co-existing with sound effects, Formosa’s Scott Gershin, MPSE, advised, “During a plane crash sequence, I pitch shifted the sound effect to match the music.”\n\n“I like to go to the music spotting session and ask if the director wants the music to serve as a rhythmic or thematic/tonal part of the soundtrack,” added sound effects re-recording mixer Will File from Fox Post Production Services. “I just take the other one. Or if it’s all rhythm — a train ride, for example — we’ll agree to split [the elements].”\n\n“On the stage, I’m constantly shifting sync and pitch shifting the sound effects to match the music track,” stated Gershin. “For Pacific Rim we had many visual effects arriving late with picture changes. Director Guillermo del Toro received so many new eight-frame VFX cues he wanted to use that the music track ended up looking like bar code” in the final Pro Tools sessions.\n\nIn terms of working with new directors, “I like to let them see some good movies with good sound design to start the conversation” offered Files. “I front load the process by giving the director and picture editors a great sounding temp track using dialog predubs that they can load into the Avid Media Composer to get them used to our sound ideas It also helps the producers dazzle the studio!”\n\n“Successful soundtrack design is a collaborative effort from production sound onwards,” advised re-recording mixer Mike Minkler, CAS, during “The Mix: Immersive Sound, Film and Television” panel, presented by DTS and moderated by Mix editor Tom Kenny. “It’s about storytelling. Somebody has to be the story’s guardian during the mix,” stated Minkler, who received Academy Awards for Dreamgirls (2006), Chicago (2002) and Black Hawk Down (2001). “Filmmaking is the ultimate collaboration. We need to be aware of what the director wants and what the picture needs. To establish your authority you need to gain their confidence.”\n\n“For immersive mixes, you should start in Dolby Atmos as your head mix,” advised Jeremy Pearson, CAS, who is currently re-recording The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 at Warner Bros. Studio. He also worked in that format on Mockingjay – Part 1 and Catching Fire. “Atmos is definitely the way to go; it’s what everyone can sign off on. In terms of creative decisions during an Atmos mix, I always ask myself, ‘Am I helping the story by moving a sound, or distracting the audience?’ After all, the story is up on the screen. We can enhance sound depth to put people into the scene, or during calmer, gentler scenes you can pinpoint sounds that engage the audience with the narrative.”\n\nMinkler reported that he is currently working on director Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight, “which will be released initially for two weeks in a three-hour version on 70mm film to 100 screens, with an immersive 5.1-channel soundtrack mastered to 35 mm analog mag.”\n\nSubsequently, the film will be released next year in a slightly different version via a conventional digital DCP.\n\n“Our biggest challenge,” reported Matt Waters, CAS, sound effects re-recording mixer for HBO’s award-winning Game of Thrones, “is getting everything competed in time. Changes are critical and we might spend half a day on a sequence and then have only 10 minutes to update the mix when we receive picture changes.”\n\n“When we receive new visuals,” added Onnalee Blank, CAS, who handles music and dialog re-recording on the show, “[the showrunners] tell us, ‘it will not change the sound.’ But if the boats become dragons…”\n\nPhotos by Mel Lambert.\n\nMel Lambert is principal of Content Creators, an LA-based editorial service, and can be reached at mel.lambert@content-creators.com.
