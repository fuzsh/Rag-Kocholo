Congratulations to our 2023 "Yes I Can" Award winners! The 13th annual event celebrated 17 exceptional students at Chateau Elan in a "Night Under the Stars" themed evening. The Apalachee High School Jazz Band Ensemble welcomed guests with music and the Barrow Arts and Sciences Academy Chamber Ensemble performed two inspirational songs. The keynote speaker was Dr. Allison Nealy, University of Georgia Department of Communication Studies and Special Education Clinical Professor and Department Head of Language and Literacy Education.

Chosen from over 2,500 students in Barrow County, teachers nominated and selected each of the school winners based on their outstanding accomplishments. The "Yes I Can" award is modeled after the state and national award given by the Council for Exceptional Children. Any student in Barrow County who has an IEP is eligible.
