        "text": "1. Best Paper Submitted to Annual Meeting\n\nThis award is given to the paper judged to be the Best Paper submitted to the HCM program of the annual Academy of Management meeting. The award is sponsored by the Foundation of the American College of Healthcare Executives and comes with a certificate of recognition and $500 check from ACHE, and an award plaque from the Division. Based on the numerical ratings given all submissions by the program reviewers, the top 10 percent of the papers are considered for this award. A committee headed by the Program Chair and comprised of selected members of the Executive Committee and the previous year's winner of the award (first author), selects the winner. [See the Archive of Award Winners]\n\n2. Best Student Paper Submitted to Annual Meeting\n\nThis award, sponsored by AUPHA, is given to the paper judged to be the best paper with a current student, as of the annual meeting submission date, listed as either the sole author or the first author on a multi-author paper. The “student” self-designation, which is selected by the submitter at the time of submission, will be used to identify eligible papers. Papers that are identified as eligible for the HCM Division Outstanding Paper Based on a Dissertation award will not be eligible for the HCM Division Best Student Paper award; however, papers reporting on dissertation-related research will be eligible. A committee headed by the Program Chair and comprised of selected members of the Executive Committee and the previous year's winner of the award, selects the winner. [See the Archive of Award Winners]\n\n5. Best International Paper Award\n\nThis award is given to the paper judged to be the best international paper submitted to the HCM Division. The award is sponsored by the HCM Division and comes with a cash award and an award plaque from the Division. Eligible papers must be self-identified and identified by the Program Chair as international or Carolyn Dexter Award nominees. The HCM Best International Paper will be submitted to AOM as the HCM Division nominee for the Dexter Award. Authors of eligible papers are encouraged to identify their papers for consideration of this award during the Academy’s paper submission process. A committee headed by the Program Chair and comprised of selected members of the Executive Committee and the previous year's winner of the award, selects the winner. [See the Archive of Award Winners]\n\n7. Myron D. Fottler Exceptional Service Award\n\nThis award is considered by many to be the most distinguished award given by the HCM Division. It was established to recognize a member of the Division who has provided extraordinary service to HCM and to the profession. It is not an annual award; rather it is given only when the Division identifies a suitable nominee who meets the following requirements:\n\nThe individual must have dedicated at least ten years to the Health Care Management Division and to the profession, and must have established a consistently strong presence in the Division over a long period of time.\n\nThe individual must have served as a meaningful mentor, not only to colleagues and students at his or her own university but also to others in HCMD.\n\nIf the individual has served as a Division officer, he or she must have continued active participation in the Division long after serving as a Division officer (this requirement automatically exempts anyone for consideration while a current officer).\n\nNominations for this award are solicited by the Division chair-elect every Spring term/semester. In the years when an award is given, the winner will be announced at the annual meeting and recognized during the Division’s business meeting and awards ceremony. [See the Archive of Award Winners]"
