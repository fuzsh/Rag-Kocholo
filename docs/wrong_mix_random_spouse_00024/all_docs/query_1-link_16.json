        "text": "San Bernardino\n\nFoster youth from local high schools were honored at the 2016 “Unstoppable Awards” held Saturday, June 11. The event also honored two judicial officers.\n\nDeborah Howell of 94.7 the WAVE served as this year’s Mistress of Ceremonies. The event, held at the Brookside County Club in Pasadena, celebrated the achievements of these students who beat considerable odds to graduate from high school while being in foster care. Each student received an “Unstoppable” scholarship in an amount between $500 and $3400 to cover tuition and other costs for college or trade school.\n\nThe honorees included, Sabrina Magro, Devontee Chism Brown, her nephew Torieaun Hilbert, Catherine Gonzalez, Erriyanna Slaughter, and Eesja Slaughter.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Education, out of nearly 60,000 children in foster care statewide, only about 50 percent graduate from high school, out of which 10 percent attend college or technical school, and only 3 percent finish.\n\nThe “Unstoppable Awards” are aimed at youth with average GPAs of 2.3 – 3.2. The scholarship seeks to recognize their scholastic accomplishments in spite of the significant obstacles that impact many transition-age foster youth, chief among them—multiple home and school placements, and the resulting disruption in their lives.\n\nDr. Anissa McNeil, an education consultant and a former foster youth created the “Unstoppable Awards” program and named it in honor of her mother. “After being homeless with my mother, I was raised by my grandmother, who is my inspiration to try to help make a difference in these kids’ lives,” she said. This year, the scholarship program provided scholarships to ten foster youth who overcame challenges and according to Dr. McNeil, “Have a can-do attitude about life and learning.”\n\n“In the years to come,” she added, “I’d like to build the momentum via increased community awareness, so we can honor the achievements of increasing numbers of graduating foster youth.”\n\nThis year the organization also honored Jude D. Zeke Zeidler with the Foster Youth Service Award and Retired Referee Sherri Sobel with the Trailblazer Award for leading the effort to develop education services for foster youth in Edelman’s Children’s Court."
