These lists include matriculating undergraduate students enrolled in 12 or more academic credits who do not have open grades (I, IP, or RD). Students who have requested that their educational records be designated as “Confidential” are not included in these public lists.\n\nPlease note that transcripts include President's and Dean's List designations as well and can be ordered here."
