She attends New York School of the Arts with her two best friends, Natalia Suárez (Talina Duclaud) and Vanessa Miller (Vanessa Pose). One night after a dance rehearsal, they all go to a bar, where Aurora meets Lorenzo Lobos (Eugenio Siller), a dance instructor and single father. Aurora and Lorenzo fall madly in love but Vanessa, who had always been jealous of Aurora, is infuriated by this because she is also in love with Lorenzo. She tries everything to separate them, going as far as inviting Lorenzo to Aurora's lavish twentieth birthday party (Lorenzo was unaware that Aurora was wealthy), where she makes sure he sees Federico (Ismael La Rosa) kiss Aurora. Lorenzo storms off, believing that he has been betrayed. Aurora runs after Lorenzo and declares her love for him, but it doesn't work and Lorenzo wants nothing more to do with Aurora.\n\nAurora returns home heartbroken and after an argument with her father, Gustavo (Braulio Castillo), she faints. Gustavo takes her to his cryogenic clinic to run tests. It is discovered that Aurora is pregnant with Lorenzo's baby. Her father refuses to tell Lorenzo about the pregnancy and sends her as far away from him as possible.\n\nA few months pass and Aurora tries to run away and return to Lorenzo, but she falls and goes into labor. She gives birth to a girl, who she names Blanca. Aurora becomes very ill and on her deathbed, calls Lorenzo, and says to him with her dying breath, \"I will always love you.\" Lorenzo hears a flat line and all the commotion, and Gustavo decides to freeze Aurora in a cryogenic capsule.\n\nAurora wakes up after 20 years, only to discover that Lorenzo (Jorge Luis Pila) is married to Natalia (Sandra Destenave). Blanca (Lisette Morelos) doesn't know that Aurora is her mother, because she was raised by her grandparents, who told her that her mother was her sister. Aurora plays along with it and keeps her real identity a secret. However, after Lorenzo's son Martin (Eugenio Siller) falls in love with Aurora, all the secrets starts coming out. Nothing remains the same as father and son share one love. But will the love of them last?\n\nYear Award Category Nominated Result 2012 The Best Bad Girl Aylín Mújica Nominated Best Supporting Actor Jorge Luis Pila Nominated Best Novela Soundtrack Aurora, by Eugenio Siller Nominated"
