        "text": "Student Honors & Awards\n\n30 Under 30 for Science by Forbes Magazine\n\nAlumni Awards\n\nArcher Fellowship Program\n\nFounded in 2001, the Archer Center is where Texas meets the world. As the Washington, D.C., campus of The University of Texas System, the Center provides talented undergraduate and graduate students from across the UT System with the opportunity to live, learn, and intern in the nation’s capital.\n\nCongratulations to the Archer Fellowship Program Award recipients!\n\nBarry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation Award\n\nThe Goldwater scholarships support sophomores and juniors who show exceptional promise to become the next generation of research leaders. Established by Congress in 1986 to honor the late Arizona senator, the scholarships award up to $7,500 per academic year.\n\nBBS Honors\n\nStudents graduating with BBS Honors have successfully completed an independent research project and Honors Thesis under faculty mentorship and approved by two faculty members, completed other designated research-related activities, and maintained a UTD GPA of 3.5 or higher.\n\nCongratulations to the BBS Honors recipients on your outstanding accomplishments!\n\nBest Dissertation Award\n\nBio-Behavioral Sciences Research Award\n\nBuhrmester Rising Star Award\n\nThe Buhrmester Rising Star Award was created to annually recognize one of the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences’ graduates, a former student who has shown outstanding early- career accomplishment during his or her first 10 years after receiving an undergraduate degree. It is named after Dr. Duane Buhrmester, who served as the school’s associate dean for undergraduate programs from 1997 until his death in August 2010 in a climbing accident with his wife, Linda. The Rising Star Award was named after Dr. Buhrmester because of his deep commitment to preparing our students for successful careers. He took great pride in the success of our students, and it is fitting that this recognition be named after him.\n\nBurroughs Wellcome Postdoctoral Diversity Enrichment Program Fellow\n\nCarol L. and Maynard S. Redeker Fellowship\n\nDean’s Awards for Excellence\n\nThe Dean’s Awards for Excellence are given in recognition of students achieving the highest academic performance or GPA, and for overall excellence within their major, including additional academic accomplishments.\n\nCongratulations to the Dean’s Award recipients for your stellar academic accomplishments!\n\nDiane Cash Fellowship\n\nDuane and Linda Buhrmester Undergraduate Research Award\n\nThe Duane and Linda Buhrmester Undergraduate Research Award was established to help prepare undergraduate students in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences for their career paths after graduation. The award honors Dr. Duane Buhrmester, who served as associate dean of the school for 14 years. He and his wife Linda died in a hiking accident in 2010.\n\nOne outgrowth of the award is to provide undergraduate students with summer research opportunities. Duane Buhrmester was known for encouraging students to engage in research opportunities and for facilitating involvement in such projects.\n\nOther activities supported by the award include the BBS Senior Launch and two lecture series designed to help students as they choose a path after graduation. The Guide to Grad School series provides information and support for undergraduates preparing for new careers.\n\nAs the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences continues to grow, contributions are necessary to serve the growing number of BBS graduates each year. Please consider supporting the Buhrmester Student Development Fund.\n\nGreen Fellows Research Program\n\nThe Green Fellows program offered jointly by The University of Texas at Dallas and the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, provides a semester-long, fully paid undergraduate research fellowship. The program is most appropriate for those students interested in PhD or MD/PhD pathways after graduation from UT Dallas.\n\nHabits, Ideals, Values, and Ethics in Human Subjects Research (HIVE) Awards\n\nThe HIVE award is a way to recognize UTD students and staff exhibiting positive Habits, Ideals, Values, and Ethics in human subjects research.\n\nJames C.

Student nominations are invited from faculty, staff and students; a committee of faculty and staff then select the awardees from the nominees based on students’ involvement in campus and state/national professional organizations and UTD student leader programs.\n\nCongratulations to the Student Leadership Award recipients! We are extremely grateful for your generous contributions to UT Dallas and other organizations.\n\nTerry Foundation® Scholarship\n\nThe Terry Foundation, based in Houston, Texas, is the largest provider of private scholarships in the state of Texas, awarding funding to scholars state-wide.
