        "text": "ANNOUNCING THE 2023 STUDENT RESEARCH GRANT AND DEVELOPING NATIONS RESEARCH AWARDS\n\nNoa Pinter-Wollman, 1st Member-at-Large\n\nChair, 2023 Student Research Grant Committee\n\nWe are pleased to announce the recipients of the 2023 Student Research Grants and the Developing Nations Research Awards. We received many high-quality proposals, but as in previous years, the number of applications exceeded the number we could fund. We received a total of 129 applications across all award categories, and were able to award funding to 56 applicants.\n\nEach proposal was reviewed independently by at least 2 referees, who provided evaluations and constructive feedback for the student grant writers. As always, members of the Society went above and beyond to provide constructive reviews. The Research Grant Committee extends a very heartfelt thank you to the following (140!) volunteer referees:\n\nAlexis Dollion, Adriana Maldonado-Chaparro, Adwait Deshpande, Alexis Dollion, Andrea Grunst, Anita Aisenberg, Ann Hedrick, Anne Clark, Anne Jacobs, Anne Jacobs, Arielle Fogel, Ashley Robart, Becca Hale, Ben Dantzer, Ben Sandkam, Brett Seymoure, Brittany Florkiewicz, Carolyn Kocman, Chase LaDue, Cheng-Yu Li, Chi-Yun Kuo, Christina Kolbmann, Clare Rittschof, Claudia Rauter, Clayton Vondriska, Clint Kelly, Corinna Most, David Logue, Delia Shelton, Desmond Maynard, Eduardo Bessa, Ejigu Worku, Eli Baskir,,Eliane Gonalves de Freitas, Elizabeth Peterson, Elizabeth Tibbetts, Emilie Snell-Rood, Emily DuVal, Eric Walters, Erica Westerman, Erika M.

These awards were administered by Delia Shelton, with the assistance of Noa Pinter-Wollman and Adriana Maldonado-Chaparro (the Members at Large or MALs). For both the Latin American Travel Awards (LATA) and Graduate Student Travel Grants (GSTG), 1-2 MALs independently rated each application, and those scores were combined with a score designated for previous attendance to ABS with higher scores given to participants that have either never attended ABS or only attended ABS virtually. Within those rankings, ties were broken by giving preference to PhD students who were further along in their graduate studies. The top 13 applicants were provided with a $700 award and the others were provided with a $500 award. This year, we received many more deserving applications than we were able to fund, and we appreciate the widespread interest in these awards. We were able to fund 6 of 8 applications for the Latin American Travel Awards, with first time ABS attendees receiving $1800 awards, and others receiving $1400 awards.\n\nLATA awardees for the 2023 conference are:\n\nAline Vieira e Silva, Universidade Estadual de Campina\n\nSamuel Rodrigues, Pontifical Catholic University of Minas\n\nAndre Rodrigues, University of Sao Paulo\n\nPedro Plravelor, Universidad Nacional de Colombia\n\nVanessa Cuhna, University of Sao Paulo\n\nFlorencia Barrios, University of the Republic\n\nGSTG awardees for the 2023 conference are:\n\nWenyi Zhou, University of Florida\n\nJulia Zeh, Syracuse University\n\nHsiang-Yu Tsai, University of Chicago\n\nPiuli Shit, University of Regensburg\n\nAlyssa Sargent, University of Washington\n\nPreethi Rajasekara, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru\n\nMuhammad Mahmudur Rahman, Oregon State University\n\nStefan Popp, University of Arizona\n\nConner Philson, University of California - Los Angeles\n\nManish Pathak, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research - Kolkata\n\nKatherine Otter, University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\nKelly OâNeill, University of Memphis\n\nIshani Mukherjee, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research - Kolkata\n\nAnastasia Madsen, University of Nebraska - Lincoln\n\nSage Madden, University of California - Davis\n\nRikki Laser, Cornell University\n\nGeorgia Lambert, University of Edinburgh\n\nTamara Kumpan, University of Toronto\n\nPhoebe Koenig, Cornell University\n\nBrooke Karasch, Ball State University\n\nClara Howell, Duke University\n\nDanae Diaz, Duke University\n\nJaime Corcoran, University of Nebraska at Omaha\n\nMadison Clarke, University of Lethbridge\n\nMoth Castagna, Missouri State University\n\nTyler Brown, University of Maryland, Baltimore County\n\nAmanda Bevan, University of Northern Colorado\n\nTHE 2023 CAREGIVER TRAVEL GRANT\n\nThe Caregiver Travel Grant award provides financial assistance for active ABS members whose caregiving responsibilities for dependent persons would otherwise limit their ability to attend and present at the annual ABS meeting. Dependents include but are not limited to young children and aging parents and awarded funds can be used for care-giving responsibilities necessary while you're at the conference including expenses incurred for care at home or at the meeting as well as travel expenses for the dependent. This year we received 13 applications and were able to award 7, equivalent to 58% funding rate. We were able to award one graduate student member ($500), four postdocs ($2900), and two research fellows ($1600). We congratulate all the applicants that received this award. Awards were administered by Adrianna Maldonado-Chaparro (3rd Member-at-Large), with assistance of Delia Shelton (2nd Member-at-Large) and Noa Pinter-Wollman (1st Member-at-Large). Thank you also to Elizabeth Phillips | Senior Project Leader at SPLTrak, for her assistance on the online grant submission system."
