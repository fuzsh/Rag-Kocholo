There is, moreover, one quality too often wholly lacking in men of high intellectual ability, without which real character cannot exist--namely, the fundamental gift of common sense.\"\n\nAfiwa Afandalo\n\nScott Cole\n\nChristina Enodien\n\nUniversity Service Award\n\nHonors that senior whose influence, ideals and activities have been devoted unselfishly to serve the best interests of their Alma Mater and fellow students. The intangibles of character, loyalty and service, which go to make up this ideal Lehigh student, are not always easy to ferret out and identify. It is for this reason that fellow students who know them most intimately are called upon, not only to recommend the candidate, but to support the recommendation with rather full statements as to just why they think a particular candidate is most deserving of the award."
