        "text": "Although we recognize first-years and transfer students as new to campus, we don't often think about another group that is just settling in: newly hired faculty.\n\nSpencer Galen, Ph.D. is one of those new professors. He teaches General Biology and General Physiology Lab at Scranton. This is his first full-time job as a professor.\n\n“It has been a dream of mine to become a professor for many years,” Dr. Galen said. “It is thrilling to finally be living that reality.”\n\nThis semester, Dr. Galen is teaching both of his classes with a hybrid method of some in-person meetings and some online. Dr. Galen said he wanted to have some in-person interaction while also reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission for both his students and himself.\n\n“My thought was that hybrid teaching would be a good balance between these two goals, though it has not been without challenges,” he said.\n\nThe current situation has made Dr. Galen more aware of his students’ varying needs. Dr. Galen said the current stressful times are affecting people at all different levels.\n\n“Some people have been affected more than others by the pandemic,” Dr. Galen said, “I have tried to keep that in mind this semester.”\n\nDr. Galen’s hybrid schedule allows him to interact with and meet some of his students and colleagues. Dr. Galen said his brilliant students and colleagues are his favorite part about teaching at Scranton.\n\n“It’s exciting going to work every day in such an intellectually stimulating environment,” he said.\n\nDr. Galen spends a lot of time prepping for his class periods, especially because it is his first time teaching these classes. Dr. Galen said he never understood how much time when into class preparation as a student.\n\n“Even if you are an expert in the subject, preparing for a single class period takes far longer than you can ever imagine,” Dr. Galen said, “As a student, I never understood just how much time goes into one class period.”\n\nDr. Galen earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Delaware, his master’s degree from the University of New Mexico and his doctoral degree from the Richard Gilder Graduate School in New York City. In addition to his academic work, Dr. Galen also participates in scientific research regarding ornithology, the study of birds, and parasitology, the study of parasites.\n\n“I study birds and parasites in the scope of how organisms interact with each other and their environment and evolutionary biology,” he said.\n\nApart from his teaching and his research, Dr. Galen enjoys hiking, bird watching and taking photos of wildlife.\n\nJoshua Perry, associate director of admissions at The University of Scranton, discusses the adaptions the University is implementing to the application process for competitive majors, such as physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing. Understanding the challenges high school students have faced scheduling standardized tests during the pandemic, the University is implementing flexible and proactive steps for programs that normally require SAT and ACT scores.\n\nHow is the University approaching the application process to competitive programs during the pandemic?\n\nWe understand the college search is hard in a normal year, but this year is exceptionally so. We want to help alleviate concerns parents and students have about SAT and ACT testing and scores. This year, we will be flexible with applicants to our nursing, OT and PT programs. We will meet the needs of students and not hold something against them that is outside of their control. With SAT and ACT test dates being postponed or cancelled basically since March – we are implementing steps to make sure students can apply to competitive programs.\n\nHas the University adjusted the SAT or ACT requirement for applying to the competitive programs?\n\nThis year, students can apply to these programs even if they were not able to take an SAT or ACT. They just need to alert us when they apply if they have been unable to take the SAT or ACT due to the pandemic. We will also work individually with students who had taken the SAT or ACT prior to everything shutting down and planned to take the test again.\n\nWhat if the situation changes regarding SAT and ACT testing and a student who applied without test scores can now take the test?\n\nWe are happy to re-evaluate our admissions and merit scholarship decisions. Again, we are looking to be flexible. If a student who applied without a test score takes the SAT or ACT and wants to use the test score, then we will consider their test results for admissions and merit scholarships.\n\nIf students apply to these competitive programs without a SAT or ACT test score, what will you consider when evaluating their application?\n\nStudents are never just a test score to Scranton. We look at the whole student. We consider their high school record, including their GPA, class rank if available, rigor of course work the student is taking. We also evaluate their essay, extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, other accolades and achievements and leadership roles. These are all important pieces of the application process. All of these factors go into evaluating how good of a fit a student will be at Scranton and how successful they will be in a very competitive program. The nursing, PT and OT programs are challenging. We want to make sure that we are admitting students into the programs that we believe can be successful.\n\nAre there any other adaptions you have made for the application process?\n\nYes, we are also using evaluative interviews to get to know student applicants better and to put context to certain elements of the application that we typically wouldn’t have when the application is being reviewed. Students can reach out to us directly to set up an interview or schedule an evaluative interview on their own using the following link: https://apply.scranton.edu/portal/interview.\n\nIf students or parents have questions regarding applying to competitive majors, who can they contact?\n\nIf they have questions or concerns about applying, they can reach out to our Admissions office by phone at 1-888-SCRANTON or by email at admissions@scranton.edu. They can also contact their admissions counselor directly. We are here to offer guidance and advice on the college search process in general and about applying to The University of Scranton.\n\nIn today’s global economy, a little more social justice could go a long way.\n\nWith that in mind, the Operations and Information Management (OIM) Department is making this main tenet of the Jesuit philosophy a significant part of its curriculum.\n\nThanks to the results of a research project by three professors, it appears that integrating social justice themes into undergraduate business courses is making a difference. These professors, all from the OIM department, infused social justice into statistics, management science, operations management and business information management core courses.\n\nThe intention is to mold business graduates who possess a firm understanding and commitment to ethics, justice and good works on behalf of underserved populations.\n\nProfessor Rose Sebastianelli, Ph.D., Alperin Endowed Chair in Business Administration, Associate Professor Yibai Li, Ph.D., and Assistant Professor Ozgur Isil, Ph.D., began their work in 2017.\n\nThey spent four semesters incorporating social justice elements into their courses. Using a rigorous pre-test post-test research design with control groups, they set out to determine if students’ beliefs, attitudes and intentions regarding social justice could be changed for the better.\n\nThe results were encouraging.\n\n“We found these efforts made a difference in attitude and perceptions of social norms surrounding social justice,” Sebastianelli said\n\nA Sense of Purpose for Faculty\n\nThe seeds of the project were planted several years ago, when Dr. Sebastianelli participated in the national Ignatian Colleagues Program for Jesuit university administrators and faculty seeking a deeper appreciation for the religious order’s core values.\n\nIt included online workshops, reflection papers, seminars and an immersion trip to the United States-Mexico border through the KINO Border Initiative. The program concluded with a capstone experience in which participants plan projects for advancing mission on their own campuses.\n\n“It really gave me a renewed sense of purpose in my work here – it’s so incumbent upon us to try to live our mission,” Dr. Sebastianelli said. “It made me think, ‘What more can I do to help students and faculty become instilled with these values?’”\n\nAs her capstone project, Dr. Sebastianelli organized a Business Education for Justice seminar for Kania School faculty. Drs. Li and Isil were among the participants, and its focus on issues like environmental sustainability, ethics and corporate social responsibility paved the way for the research project.\n\nSocial Justice a Timely Topic\n\nDr. Sebastianelli is confident social justice can be seamlessly integrated into the curriculum, considering the many issues now at play in the international business community – be it child labor laws or environmental regulations.\n\nEven a highly analytical course like statistics, which Dr. Sebastianelli teaches, can be infused with social justice via examples that revolve around societal problems like gender and racial discrimination, she said.\n\nDr. Li plans to use assignments and case studies to weave social justice into his Business Information Management course.\n\n“A lot of new technologies such as cloud computing, big data, business intelligence and blockchain, terms that people didn’t hear about 10 years ago, now have been widely applied in the business world,” Dr. Li said. “Things happen so quickly that the legal, ethical, social justice and privacy implications of these technologies have not been fully understood by the industry.”\n\nDr. Isil will specifically focus on incorporating environmental sustainability into the OIM courses.\n\n“Environmental sustainability issues often have implications on social justice. For example, environmental degradation in the developed world can negatively impact less developed countries, such as through increased flooding in developing countries due to worsening climate change caused by emissions from developed countries,” he said. “How should the scientific consensus on worsening environmental degradation inform business, which causes much of the environmental degradation?”\n\nImpacting the Future\n\nThe professors have presented their research at several conferences, and have written a manuscript that was published in the September 2020 issue of the Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education. They hope the concept will eventually spread to other business schools.\n\n“This is something that, to me, has meaning and could have an impact on the future,” Dr. Sebastianelli said. “Maybe if we can get students to think this way now, they might consider the consequences and ramifications of their actions once they’re in their careers.”\n\n“In the future, when they are in managerial positions, I hope they will recall what they learned in my course,” Dr. Li added. “And I hope they will make thoughtful decisions that will benefit not only their business but also all of society.”\n\nThis year’s general election is less than two weeks away and for eligible voters now is the time to make a plan to cast your ballot. Voting will look a little different due to the coronavirus, but with education and a little preparation each of us can safely cast our ballots.\n\nThose seeking information and resources or ready to drop off their mail-in ballots for Lackawanna County can join a When We All Vote Together voter activation event this Friday, October 23 from 12:30 p.m. – 1:30 p.m. outside of City Hall.

Mariotti, D.M.D., ’75 and Monsignor Joseph G. Quinn, J.D., J.C.L., ’72, raised more than $900,000. Proceeds from October 8th celebration, during which the honorees were presented with the University’s President’s Medal, support the University’s Presidential Scholarship Endowment Fund, and this year will also support the James P. Sweeney, S.J., Family Outreach Fund for students facing unexpected financial hardship and the Scott R. Pilarz, S.J., Scholarship, a need-based scholarship established in 2011 by the Sorbera Family.\n\n“Tonight, we gather in spirit from all over the country and the world,” said Rev. Scott R. Pilarz, S.J., president of The University of Scranton at the virtual celebration. “Tonight, we celebrate what is best about Scranton. Our honorees Maggie and John Mariotti and Monsignor Quinn are great examples of the best about Scranton. Ours is a University committed to building community and I know few people who are more committed to building community than these great friends – Maggie, John and Joe.”\n\nIn presenting the President’s Medal, the University and the PBC recognize individuals who have achieved excellence in their fields and who have demonstrated extraordinary compassion for others while personifying the University’s mission of Catholic and Jesuit excellence and service.\n\nIn his remarks, Father Pilarz recalled that Monsignor Quinn chaired the University’s Presidential Search Committee in 2003 “that had the audacity to pluck someone out of the classroom with no administrative experience and whose scholarly life was dedicated to 16th century poetry. Only Joe Quinn would have an imagination big enough to make me the President of The University of Scranton.”\n\nFather Pilarz said Maggie and John Mariotti were his “special Scranton welcome wagon,” noting “their love for Scranton was contagious.”\n\nFive of the University’s class of 2021 Presidential Scholars also spoke during the celebration: Molly Elkins, Owings, Maryland, a biochemistry, cell and molecular biology and philosophy double major and member of the Special Jesuit Liberal Arts Honors Program, undergraduate Honors Program and the Magis Honors Program for STEM; Hannah Graff, Melville, New York, an accounting major currently pursuing her master’s in accountancy with a concentration in forensic accounting; Jacob Myers, Ambler, a biochemistry, cell and molecular biology and philosophy double major and member of the Special Jesuit Liberal Arts Honors Program and the Magis Honors Program for STEM; Megan Osborne, Mifflinville, a mathematics major; and Amanda Tolvaisa, Springfield, an English and philosophy double major and member of the University’s Special Jesuit Liberal Arts Honors Program.\n\nThe Presidential Scholars expressed their gratitude to those whose generous support made their scholarships possible, and spoke of the research, internship and academic opportunities the scholarships offered to them.\n\n“The Presidential Scholarship and my time at Scranton has given me an unrivaled education in science supplemented by a robust background in the humanities,” said Myers. “This experience has allowed me to participate in several research programs funded through the NSF (National Science Foundation) over the last several years. This past summer, I had the opportunity to work on determining how long SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, survives on surfaces in order to better understand its transmission.”\n\nThrough its previous 18 dinners, the PBC has generated over $16 million for the Presidential Scholarship Endowment Fund.\n\nThe President’s Business Council (PBC) 19th Annual Award Celebration can be seen here.

Pryle ’89, executive director of the PBC. “While we all know the challenges of accomplishing that, we have embraced the opportunity that a virtual event offers by providing greater access to more members of our University of Scranton community who might not normally be able to join us in person.

(Jack) Brennan ’68, P’06, who served two different terms on The University of Scranton’s Board of Trustees, passed away on Saturday, Sept. 19, at the age of 74.\n\nJack is remembered by many for his kindness, honesty, intelligence, a self-deprecating sense of humor and his dedication to the University.\n\nHe served on the Board of Trustees longer than any other lay person in the University's history during his twin terms of service (1992-2001 and 2002-2008, respectively). He was also a member of the Kania School of Management (KSOM) Advisory Board and the President’s Business Council.\n\nIn October 2000, Brennan Hall, home of KSOM, was named in his honor.\n\nDr. Michael Mensah, who served as the dean of the Kania School from 2005-2018, spoke fondly of Jack’s dedication and service to The University of Scranton.\n\n“Jack was outstanding in regards to his personal service to the Kania School of Management and our students. He was selected to the KSOM Advisory Board in 2006 and brought some much-needed personal characteristics to the board, including his humbleness. This was very helpful to a new dean like myself,” Dr. Mensah said.\n\nMensah recalled the story of a very tense board meeting early on in his term as dean and how Jack immediately was able to lighten the mood with a joke regarding his own performance as a student.\n\n“The devotion to student affairs and student issues is what I want people to know about Jack. He drove to Scranton for every board meeting (from New Jersey) and was always present on campus giving his personal time to interact with students,” Dr. Mensah said. “The KSOM Internship Office, along with the Career Development Center, were all things that Jack fought for and devoted his time to.”\n\nClose friend Bill Lynett '72 offered similar sentiments regarding Jack’s dedication to the University.\n\n“Jack cared so deeply about The University of Scranton and he devoted so much time to it. He served as a guest lecturer in several classes and students liked him because they could identify with him,” Lynett said. “He wasn’t out to better himself, but to better the University and those that lead the University.”\n\nJack served as a mentor for several students during his time on the KSOM Advisory Board and was the recipient of the University’s O’Hara Award for Management in 2003. He was also among the first inductees into the KSOM Business Leader Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\n“Some people just build a certain kind of relationship with their alma mater, and Jack felt that way about The University of Scranton. He not only loved the Kania School of Management, but everything about the University as a whole,” Lynett added.\n\nLynett served on the Board of Trustees with Jack in the 1990s and is a current member of the KSOM Advisory Board.\n\n“What you saw was what you got with Jack,\" said close friend Edward R. Leahy, J.D. '68. \"He was as honest as the day is long and was a smart and direct guy. There was a real practicality about his intelligence.\"\n\nEd and Jack became fast friends during their first day on campus on a Sunday night before classes began the next day, in the fall of 1964. In fact, Ed recalled that after walking up to main campus from his dorm, the old Hotel Casey, which was located across the street from the now Hilton Hotel in downtown Scranton, he saw Jack sitting on a bench in the quad. The two began talking, and Jack became Ed’s first friend at the University.\n\nLittle did both know at the time that their conversation would mark the start of a more than 50-year friendship as both served together on the Board of Trustees from 1994-2000.\n\nJack graduated from the University in 1968 and then enlisted in the U.S. Army. His service included a tour of duty as a first lieutenant with the U.S. Army Signal Corps.\n\nHis experience with the Signal Corps led to a long and distinguished business career over the years. Jack was a co-founder of Metro Mobile CTS, Inc., which was one of the first cell phone providers, and served as president & COO of the company. During his career, he also served as president and COO of SkyWay systems; vice chairman of the board of directors of Southern Union Company; president of Activated Communications; and member of the board of directors of Spectrum Signal Processing.\n\nJack is survived by his wife, Lucinda, and the couple’s two children, Ryan and Sarah, as well as several other relatives. His son, Ryan, is a 2006 graduate of the University."
