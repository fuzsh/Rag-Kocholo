        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Vanderbilt was represented by 88 student-athletes on the 2024 Spring SEC Academic Honor Roll, SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey announced Tuesday.\n\nThe 2024 Spring SEC Academic Honor Roll includes the sports of baseball, golf, lacrosse, tennis, and track & field. It is based on grades from the 2023 Summer, 2023 Fall, and 2024 Spring terms.\n\nAbout the SEC Academic Honor Roll\n\nAny student-athlete who participates in a Southeastern Conference championship sport or a student-athlete who participates in a sport listed on his/her institution’s NCAA Sports Sponsorship Form is eligible for nomination to the Academic Honor Roll. B. The following criteria will be followed: (1) A student-athlete must have a grade point average of 3.00 or above for either the preceding academic year (two semesters or three quarters) or have a cumulative grade point average of 3.00 or above at the nominating institution. (2) If a student-athlete attends summer school, his/her grade point average during the summer academic term must be included in the calculation used to determine eligibility for the Academic Honor Roll. (3) Student-athletes eligible for the Honor Roll include those receiving an athletics scholarship, recipients of an athletics award (i.e., letter winner), and non-scholarship student-athletes who have been on a varsity team for two seasons. (4) Prior to being nominated, a student-athlete must have successfully completed 24 semester or 36 quarter hours of non-remedial academic credit toward a baccalaureate degree at the nominating institution.
