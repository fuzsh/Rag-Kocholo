        "text": "Zamanethzie Granados, Spindletop Community Impact Partners Women in STEM Award 2024, Computer Science at Texas A&M University\n\nI am beyond grateful for your support. Being a first generation student makes this award extremely supportive to my future. I loved heard in the encouraging and motivations speech from Jesus Terrones. It was one that I will never forget because of the inspirational message. Thank you for such a wonderful evening!\n\nReagan Crow, Spindletop Community Impact Partners Women in STEM Award 2024, Biology at University of Texas at Dallas\n\nAs a third-time BAFTX Women in STEM Award recipient, it is truly remarkable to reflect on the opportunities and experiences I’ve had over the past two years that would not have been possible without the generous support of BAFTX and Spindletop. [My words] cannot contain my gratitude for these organizations or their transformative impact on my personal and professional development. As I prepare for my summer internship and junior year, I will carry with me appreciation and admiration for your kindness, thank you!\n\nSara Mai, Junior Achiever 2021\n\nI gained more knowledge and personal confidence. It made me realized that even though people all have different cultures, we are not really that much different and it made me realize the closeness I share with people all around the world. Additionally, the experience of traveling on my own without the presence of my parents made me more independent and confident that I can achieve my ambitions and overcome all obstacles that comes in front of me.\n\nAnh Thy Nguyen, Junior Achiever 2021\n\nThe experience I gained from the program inspires me to seek and explore more opportunities to travel outside of the United States. I hope to travel alone or with family to experience newer sites in other countries to satiate both my curiosity and passion for learning. Furthermore, I felt that I have developed a greater sense of confidence and independence after staying in the United Kingdom for nearly two weeks, and I hope to pave a journey much greater than my home back in Houston, Texas. I’m truly grateful for the experience I received, and I feel much more assured in myself knowing that there is so much left in the world to see and learn from.\n\nI feel that at first, I was very scared and anxious to be in an unknown place but after being there for a short amount of time I loved every single moment of it. I had some culture shocks, learned that the people there my age weren't so different, and that what makes a place special is the people that you are there with.\n\nJaquelin Franco, Junior Achiever 2022\n\nThrough this program I definitely gained a new sense of autonomy that I didn't quite have before. I was expecting to be extremely homesick the whole time or feel some type of imposter syndrome. Nonetheless, this was not the case. Everyday provided an enjoyable experience in which I felt independent and ready to take in the British sights. I also learned a lot more about the world through this experience. I came to realize that there are other cultures out there and it was amazing to be able to have some exposure to them. All in all, this program opened up my eyes to the world that could be found outside of Houston, Texas. I know that I will never forget these two weeks and that I will use them as a catalyst for traveling more in the future.\n\nGeorgette Djenadoum, Junior Achiever 2022\n\nThis program has changed my perspective on how I viewed the world, to embrace those who are different from me, and motivated me to keep an open mind and travel the world more in the future. It promoted confidence within myself to appreciate the young woman I am and to love the woman I am becoming and become more independent, but also leave room to learn from others. It allowed me to acknowledge and seize every opportunity that’s opened up to me and as for my ambitions, it’s taught me to work hard for everything I strive for and to appreciate the journey.\n\nUpon receiving the news that I was a recipient of this award, I remember feeling a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Thank you for relieving some of the financial burden and thank you for this opportunity that will allow me to dedicate myself to my studies. I hope that this award will allow me to become who I am meant to be. Thank you.\n\nWhat this award means to me is ever-lasting change. I’d like to thank BAFTX and my sponsor who fortunately chose me as their recipient. This is an incredible gift that has been graciously offered to me and I know that this scholarship will aid in the betterment of my future. Financial issues have always been prevalent in my life, so it was imperative to me to make sure I have worked diligently throughout my high school career to ensure a chance at my future education. This award means the absolute world to me, and I couldn’t be more grateful for this opportunity. Thank you.\n\nAfter going to London, I could describe the way I felt afterwards in one word: empowered. I feel that there is a whole other side of the world that I have never been to and if I work hard enough and put forth the effort to do so, I have the ability to explore those parts of the world and really make an impact wherever I end up. England was beautiful and I was surrounded by people who had the same ambition and drive as I do even though we all came from such different parts of the world and different backgrounds. It was nice to hear that I wasn't the only one who was anxious about the next step after high school. It was also very refreshing to gain a sense of the \"real world\" outside of my hometown. I feel that it helped me find myself and the setting I would like to be a part of in college. I also feel more confident as I begin my college application process. Overall, I am grateful and I now know that I have the ability to go wherever and be whatever I would like, the possibilities are limitless!\n\nAshley Sessums, Undergraduate scholar 2019, Mechanical Engineering, University of Houston\n\nThis scholarship motivates and enables me to be the best student I can be as I continue my college education and prepare to begin a career in the energy industry. I am so grateful to organizations like BAFTX that support students like me and encourage us to dream big. Thanks to the scholarship, I will be able to focus on dedicating my time to my studies and increasing my involvement on campus and in my community. One day I hope to give back to, and support and inspire students with scholarships and mentorship.\n\nElizabeth Lara, Undergraduate Scholar 2019, Industrial Engineering, University of Houston\n\nThe impact the scholarship will have on my life is indescribable. I will have the opportunity to pursue my education in engineering. I will be the first one in my family to pursue an education and I'm more than grateful for this opportunity. I also want to continue my education (Masters in Engineering or MBA). I hope to continue to give back in the future. Thank you!\n\nRomelia Sanchez, Graduate Scholar 2019, Finance, University of Houston\n\nI am eternally grateful for the scholarship. At the beginning of this year I wasn't sure if I would be able to continue grad school, and I told myself that if I didn't receive any of the awards I applied for, it meant I would need to pause my education and go into the workforce. When I received the news about the BAFTX scholarship, I called all my family members because I was so excited. They all know what education means to me and they are all proud that I'm able to continue my education, since I will be the first of my family to receive a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree.\n\nAriana Morris, Undergraduate Scholar 2019, Mathematics, Texas A&M\n\nI am very grateful for this opportunity. It means a lot to me that others are willing to invest in my education. It is my full intent to pass on this act. While I may not become financially able to support future students, I will be doing everything I can to build their lives in the classroom. I will be an inspirational teacher, not only of math but also of connections to the real world, applications, and how to truly learn. I intend to inspire students to look beyond the routine and seek greatness. For me, this will be true success.\n\nDiana Olmos, Junior Achiever 2018\n\nThanks to this wonderful opportunity, I have learned that I have the ability to conquer and achieve anything I want. I learned that limitations are figments of our own insecurities, that I can go above and beyond to achieve the impossible. I found out how incredible it feels to learn from collaboration and shared experiences. I made friends that have widened my perspective. I have experienced the fulfillment that independence gives you. During my time in London, I realized that my love for learning and love for education brought me there. The experience really revitalized my desire to continue my education and share my passions with the world. I am now ready to begin the next chapter of my life at a college/university, and share what I have learned with my community.\n\nI received the prestigious BAFTX scholarship in 2018 and I am extremely grateful for being selected me as a recipient. Because of this scholarship, I can finish college in a timely manner with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. And now I am planning to pursue a PhD in pure mathematics after graduation to dedicate myself to research in inverse problems. I am able to fulfil all my dreams due to the BAFTX scholarship.\n\nHeriberto Triana, Undergraduate Scholar 2018, Houston Community College\n\nYour contribution to my college education has made a tremendous impact on my life. You have helped my financial situation in college and relieved me of stress in my life. Thanks to the award I was given, I have been motivated to do even better in both in school and in my personal life. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”\n\nMagy Avedissian, Undergraduate Scholar 2017, Texas A&M\n\nI am now a rising senior and have recently been elected as president of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Student Chapter at Texas A&M University. This summer, I will be interning with Schlumberger in Houston. Next steps include finding what part of the energy industry I would like to further study. I have found interest in an international scope of oil and gas, and am considering possible graduate school options outside of the United States after gaining some work experience. But, I do not feel that I am necessarily tied down to any certain experience. I am open to learning as much as I can about this exciting industry.\n\nMadelaine Heaven, Junior Achiever 2014\n\nThe BAFTX trip was an immensely formative experience for me, and came right at a time when I was still figuring out how to navigate the world on my own. The program opened my eyes to cultures and opinions that sometimes directly contrasted my own worldview up to that point, and as a result, made me a much more open-minded and considerate adult. My father was English and did a great deal of travelling when he was younger, so I grew up hearing all of his stories, but I would never have been able to experience any of it for myself had I not been sponsored by BAFTX. That experience has resulted in my returning to the UK (travelling up and down the island) for at least a month every year since the trip, and pushed me to apply for a whole host of scholarships and programs I never would have dreamed of beforehand. I am now a Terry Scholar at Texas A&M Galveston, with a full ride all four years of university-- including a stipend for a semester abroad that I will be taking next year. I am a Community Leader (a university job), an officer in the Terry Organisation, and a leader on campus.\n\nBAFTX allowed me to dream, then gave me the tools to make those dreams a reality.\n\nDavid Rochelle, Undergraduate Scholar 2013, Swansea University\n\nI did my study abroad, funded by BAFTX, from August to December 2013. I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to study abroad and I feel it has added to my skill set in various ways. In 2015 I graduated from Swansea University with a first class degree (hons). The same year I started my current course, an integrated PhD (Master's degree and PhD) at the University of Leeds. My course title is: Centre of Doctoral Training in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine - innovation in medical and biological engineering. I am in the third year of four currently and in an integral part of my research. The study abroad programme demonstrated to me the dedication and determination needed to achieve your goals, something that I need to complete my PhD.\n\nYarid Hassad Puentes, Undergraduate Scholar\n\nI want to take a moment to personally thank you once again for all of your support. Attending the BAFTX gala was an amazing experience for my parents and I, one that allowed us to more comprehensively understand what you and the team of directors do independently and collectively to make a difference in the community. As a beneficiary, I greatly appreciate the investment in my education and in me as an individual. I offer you my heartfelt appreciation and my commitment to continue in my educational goals so that one day I too can financially support the next generation of students who receive from you a new opportunity to succeed.\n\nYuribia munoz, undergraduate scholar, university of houston\n\n\"I am a fifth year geology PhD student in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Houston. I was awarded a BAFTX award during my junior year in this same department. It was the first award for which I was nominated and I was so happy to have won the award. Shortly after this, I started working with my current PhD advisor. I would describe myself as a marine geologist, with a specialty in sedimentology. My dissertation research focuses on the study of sedimentary processes and sediment distribution in fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula. In the future, I want to continue working on similar research, not only in Antarctica but also in the Texas Gulf Coast. I also want to teach earth science and environmental geology at college level. What brought me into geology was the curiosity to understand the processes that shape this planet, and during all this time I have never ceased to be amazed by the natural world. I hope one day I can transmit this sentiment to others.\"\n\nJoi Bartholomew, Junior Achiever 2002\n\nMy life was completely and utterly transformed courtesy of the scholarship that I received that summer from BABC [who awarded Junior Achiever scholarships prior to the launch of BAFTX in 2006]. I graduated from Lamar High School in 2003 with the International Baccalaureate diploma, went on to graduate from Occidental College (where I participated on a couple of study abroad programs) with a BA in Diplomacy and World Affairs, and then graduated with an MA in International Studies from Goldsmiths College, University of London in 2010. I now serve as an Academic Advisor in the Bauer College of Business, University of Houston where I advise undergraduate business students on learning abroad opportunities. My entire personal and professional trajectory has been courtesy of the kindness and generosity of BABC and the scholarship donors."
