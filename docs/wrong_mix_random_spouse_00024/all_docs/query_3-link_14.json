        "text": "What better way to spread holiday cheer than by supporting some badass women-owned brands? Finding the perfect gift can be tricky, so we've curated a list that makes shopping a breeze and supports female-founded companies that are doing amazing things in the world.\n\nAs of 2023, one-third of businesses making waves globally are run by women. By supporting female entrepreneurs this holiday season, you're not just giving a gift; you're investing in a world where glass ceilings are shattered daily.\n\nFrom the foodie and bookworm to the techie and wellness-obsessed, we have options for everyone on your list (including you). The best part? Many of them give back to great charitable causes. Keep reading to see and shop our picks (in no particular order!), then raise a glass to these incredible female founders.\n\n1) Anchal self-care gift box, $210\n\nGive the gift of an at-home spa day with Anchal’s organic cotton robe, matching headband, and toiletry bag. Anchal is an ethical brand co-founded by sisters Colleen and Maggie Clines that works with local artisans in Ajmer, India to create eco-friendly textiles. They have also established programs to train, employ, and support survivors of domestic violence and those vulnerable to exploitation.\n\n2) Fashion Fair Iconic lipstick, $28 HALL OF FEMME HONOREE\n\nFashion Fair was founded by and for Black women in 1973, and helped define and transform the Black beauty industry as we know it. These days, the legacy brand is helmed by Hall of Femme honoree Desirée Rogers — and this “iconic” lipstick makes a great stocking stuffer! Formulated with sunflower seed oil and rosemary leaf for balm-like hydration and rich, buildable coverage, it comes in a range of shades that pop on all skin tones.\n\n3) Fazeek striped coupe glasses, $99\n\nFounded by Melbourne-based designer Jackie Fezakas, Fazeek’s glassware is hand-blown and made from high-quality borosilicate glass. We love this set of striped coupe glasses — sure, they’re made for champagne, but they’re also a fun way to serve cocktails, seafood, or dessert.\n\n4) Clare V. Icon sweater, $365\n\nEveryone deserves a cozy knit, and this one is wooly, plush, and perfect for winter afternoons. Founder and designer Clare Vivier is dedicated to supporting various social justice causes — the brand partners with (and gives back to) organizations like Every Mother Counts, The Center for Reproductive Rights, and Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\n5) Aplat baguette tote, $60\n\nAplat founder Shu Bertrand draws inspiration from Korean, French, and American cultures in all of her products, including this cheeky tote bag. Sustainably made — and with enough room for two baguettes! — it’s a great gift that’s perfect for picnics or bakery runs.\n\n7) Alice Brainstorm mushroom chocolates, $29\n\nAlice’s decadent treats are made from functional mushrooms and organic dark chocolate, and Brainstorm offers a boost of energy and focus during the midday lag. These pretty tins make a great stocking stuffer! Alice was created by Lindsay Goodstein, a former pharmaceutical executive, and Charlotte Cruze, a food scholar and wellness authority, with the desire to create “safe, effective consumables that pair long-term benefits with immediate boosts to cognitive functioning.”\n\n8) Frēda Salvador Willow Wallabee, $295\n\nFrēda Salvador co-founders Cristina Palomo Nelson and Megan Papay dreamed up their footwear company “over many bottles of wine” — that’s something we can get behind. Their products are handcrafted in family factories in Spain and El Salvador, where they source the highest quality leathers for longtime wear. These cozy shearling wallabees are great for tipsy nights at home and around town, and will last for winter seasons to come.\n\n9) Bella Freud Hunky Dory egg cup set, $106\n\nBritish designer Bella Freud’s bone china egg cups are equal parts classy and sassy. Since founding her namesake brand in 1990, Bella’s irreverent designs have made her an industry staple and built a cult following among the likes of Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, and Zadie Smith.\n\n10) Ourside Eau de Parfum discovery kit, $35\n\nOurside founder Keta Burke-Williams is an “outsider inspired by countless other outsiders.” She blends clean, responsibly-sourced aromas that reinvigorate the senses. This trio of unisex scents, with notes of floral wood, earthy citrus, and warm amber, is fit for the fragrance lover on your list (and tiny enough to slip into their stocking).\n\n11) Flower by Edie Parker Boobs on Drugs tee, $30\n\nBrett Heyman is the founder of Flower by Edie Parker, which offers luxury cannabis smoking accessories and vintage-inspired apparel. Not only does this tee nod back to the classic 80s/90s anti-drug PSA, but 15% of profits will be donated to the Women's Prison Association, an organization that empowers women to redefine their lives in the face of injustice and incarceration.\n\n12) Golde Matcha Lovers Kit, $52\n\nWith Golde, co-founder and CEO Trinity Mouzon Wofford aims to make wellness easy, fun, and accessible to everyone. The brand’s Pure Matcha is ceremonial grade and sourced from Uji, Japan, and Matcha Turmeric is a great alternative for those looking for a jitter-free boost. This kit has everything the matcha lover needs to make the perfect cup at home.\n\n13) Dieux x Violette Forever Eye Mask, $25\n\nDieux’s trio of female founders teamed up with French makeup artist Violette_FR on these silicone eye patches that help hold serums and creams close to the skin, allowing for better absorption and hydration. The best part? They’re reusable.\n\n14) Our Place Dream Cooker, $225\n\nOur Place’s latest best-selling gadget is a dream. This stylish multicooker steams, sears, sautees, and slow cooks, all while saving space and looking sleek in the kitchen. Founded by Shiza Shahid (who is also co-founder of the Malala Fund), Our Place works with women-owned manufacturing collectives and donates to systems-based causes like Feeding America and Rare Impact Fund.\n\n15) The Last Love Note by Emma Grey, from $15 HALL OF FEMME HONOREE\n\nZibby Owens is the founder of Zibby Owens Media, a modern media company on a mission to “help busy people live their best lives by connecting to books and each other.” Her publishing imprint’s latest offering, Emma Grey’s romantic comedy, will make your Bumble-obsessed BFF laugh, cry, and renew their faith in the resilience of the human heart — and in love itself.\n\n16) Pineapple Collaborative The Natural Red Wine Vinegar, $28\n\nPineapple Collaborative was founded by six women on a mission to connect and celebrate with people who love food. The brand collaborated with winemaker Martha Stoumen and vinegar alchemist Joanne Krueger on “Northern California in a bottle,” AKA this slow-fermented vinegar made from a delightful blend of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, and Nero d'Avola grapes.\n\n17) CHANI The Deck of Plenty affirmation cards, $65\n\nThe Deck of Plenty contains 82 cards for affirmation and inspiration, and each daily pick-me-up offers a written message or illustration to spark new thoughts and prompt fresh ideas. CHANI co-founder Chani Nicolas is a New York Times best-selling author and astrologer, and the company donates 5% of all revenue to Freeform, an organization that supports survivors of gender-based violence.\n\n18) GlassTats Holiday Bundle, $56\n\nGlassTats, co-founded by friends Maya Pacheco and Corinne Golden, is making sure you never lose your wine glass at a party ever again. For the hostess with the mostess, we love the brand’s bundle of drink markers, which includes four sets of tats fit for all types of holiday soirees.\n\n19) Caminito Tierra Lila Blanket Roll, $92\n\nCaminito’s mother-daughter team, Elizabeth and Liz Clark, create each of their colorful blankets as “a tribute to Mexico’s color and craft.” Each one is hand woven by talented artisans in central Mexico and features a handmade leather carrying strap — you can use them for yoga, beach hangs, or gathering around a campfire.\n\n20) Gohar World Mother of Pearl Column Spoons, $148\n\nCrafted by artists and sisters Laila and Nadia Gohar, these iridescent spoons are a luxe gift for the champagne and caviar lover (mother of pearl ensures the delicate flavor of caviar stays as fresh as possible!). Gohar World is “a tableware universe that embraces craft, time, tradition, and humor.” Nadia and Laila conceive their pieces as future heirlooms, and work with family-owned ateliers around the world, from Vietnam to Austria, Italy to Egypt.\n\n21) Chunks Bow Barrette, $20\n\nTiffany Ju was on the hunt for the perfect hair accessory when her brand, Chunks, was born. Their fun, colorful clips and barrettes are made from high-quality acetate and work for all hair types. We especially love this bow-rette, which adds French flair to any fit.\n\n22) Ellevest Gift Card, $50-$1,500\n\nFounded by Sallie Krawcheck, Ellevest offers financial guidance designed to help women build their wealth, reach their goals, and feel confident along the way. Their gift cards can be used toward 1:1 financial planning sessions, live workshops, budgeting advice, and more. Financial freedom is a gift in itself, so why not spread the dollars and sense?\n\n23) Sézane Les Mots Correspondence Set, $20\n\nWe all have that friend who sends beautiful thank you cards through the mail (or maybe you’re that friend). This stationery set from Sézane is a great gift that celebrates the lost art of letter writing. Morgane Sézalory started her label as France's first online brand — Sézane is now B-Corp certified, and through their DEMAIN initiative, the company donates 10% of global sales and 100% of the proceeds from a dedicated design to programs that support access to education and equal opportunities for children worldwide.\n\n24) Piecework Fancy Ideas 1,000 piece puzzle, $38\n\nJena Wolfe and Rachel Hochhauser are the co-founders of Piecework, which makes this “fussy, fanciful, opulent” puzzle. (We’re partial to any activity that includes caviar.) Gift it to your bougie friend; the one who always inspires you to treat yourself and celebrate life’s little indulgences.
