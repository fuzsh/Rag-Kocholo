        "text": "Property value must be reassessed every five years, according to a bill passed by the Delaware House Thursday and sent along to the Senate. House Bill 62, sponsored by Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton, D-Newark, would require counties to reassess real property values at least once every five years, starting with the next reassessment. That hasn’t been done in New Castle County since 1983, in Kent County since 1987, and in Sussex County since 1974. Wilson-Anton said that reassessments are being done in Delaware under a court order, and the bill will make sure that the state won’t have to be ordered again to do a reassessment. House Minority Whip Lyndon Yearick, R-Camden, said he would have preferred there be a rolling reassessment, rather than just one every five years. “Say for example, 2008 reoccurs and there’s a dramatic reduction in property values,” Yearick said. “You may capture that based upon that five year cycle, whereas rolling reassessment, I think, mitigates some of the risk of that occurring.” Yearick wanted to know who is going to pick up the tab. “The state so graciously was paying for this one,” he said. Wilson-Anton said the state is not picking up the tab, the three counties are and that county council members support the bill. “I know New Castle County has made it revenue neutral. And so they’ve really picked up the tab there,” she said. Future reassessments would be a county responsibility to pay, she said. Rep. Rich Collins, R-Millsboro, said he wouldn’t support the bill unless they wait for the results of the current reassessment first. “Would it not make sense, and be the responsible thing to do, to see what the results of this current reassessment are? I mean, our citizens, our constituents are out there. Many of them are wondering what is this going to do to me, and I can’t begin to tell them on any individual basis,” Collins said. “So why would we pass a law when we have literally seven years to pass it to do whatever needs to be done?” Speaker of the House Rep. Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, said he’s opposed to reassessment, but supports the bill because if they have to do a reassessment, they should do it every five years. The bill, which doesn’t require a fiscal note, has 17 additional sponsors and cosponsors, with 15 Democrats and two Republicans. The House also approved four other bills Thursday: House Bill 118, sponsored by Rep. Kevin Hensley, R-Odessa, which would create a civil citation for people who smoke in a car that also contains someone under the age 18, whether or not a window is open, passed 32 to 5. It now heads to the Senate for consideration. Senate Bill 97, sponsored by Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola, D-Newark, would make the Delaware code gender silent by removing all references to gender from future bills, and require revisers to correct several male only references. The bill now goes to the governor’s desk for a signature. House Bill 134, sponsored by Rep. Franklin Cooke, D-New Castle/Minquadale, would remove references to the word coroner from the Delaware code, as the state switched to an Office of Medical Examiner in 1969. The bill was unanimously approved and now heads to the Senate. House Bill 130, sponsored by Rep. Valerie Longhurst, D-Bear, would change the definition of a state employee to include those working on a temporary basis, allowing them to qualify for the state pension plan. The bill was unanimously approved and now heads to the Senate. None of the four bills required a fiscal note.\n\nThe Wilmington Learning Collaborative’s governing council voted Tuesday night for a budget containing various programs intended to improve outcomes for city students. The budget is for this fiscal year, which concludes June 30, 2024. It totals $16,632,690.20, with $10 million set in the state budget for this year, and the other $6,632,690.20 is carryover funds from last year. Executive Director Laura Burgos said the programs are largely a result of her working with all nine principals of the schools involved in the collaborative. She also said it’s important the budget gets passed so the group isn’t in January or February and still waiting to get programs started. The collaborative’s state funds are allocated towards the following initiatives: Those funds are then further broken down by the collaborative, whose goal is to improve academic and societal achievement for students at nine city of Wilmington elementary schools across the Brandywine, Christina and Red Clay school districts: Expanded Learning Time ($4,900,000) Summer Academy – $3,000,000 A Summer Academy will be created to serve at least 2,500 students from mid-June through mid-August. The program will span 6-8 weeks across multiple WLC school sites and staffed by current teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, and nonprofit partners. There will be a weekly skill focus and thematic unit with daily activities focused on project-based learning and STEAM activities. Spring Break Academy – $750,000 The Spring Break Academy will serve students at or approaching grade level, as well as students identified as Gifted and Talented, which by state code, are students identified with the capability of high performance because of their: general intellectual ability specific academic aptitude creative productive thinking leadership ability visual and performing arts psychomotor ability Attendance will be emphasized and student participation will be incentivized through gift cards and technology equipment. This will be an invite-only pilot program. Programming content will focus on 21st Century Skills with students participating in college and career readiness activities led by local nonprofit partners and career professionals. The academy will take place from April 1 – April 5 and serve up to 500 students across. Saturday STEAM Academy – $500,000 The WLC Saturday STEAM Academy will be a weekly full-day college exploration opportunity taking place at the Delaware State University Campus, a contracted partner of the collaborative. It will be a six-month pilot running from January to June 2024 and serve up to 100 students. Students will participate in approximately 20 daylong sessions, attending college-like courses focused on science and technology. Learning activities will be led by DSU students and faculty, and chartered buses will pick up students from downtown Wilmington to campus. Early Academy (On-site) – $500,000 The Early Academy is designed to reduce student tardiness by providing early morning tutoring and mentorship support. This program will target students in Pre-K through fifth grade and will be piloted at two or three WLC school sites (those without existing early learning programs). Timely student arrivals will be tracked and families will be rewarded via gift card incentives for reaching attendance goals. The program will be staffed by parents, nonprofit partners, and other community members who are cleared for school employment. Student Transportation – $150,000 Given the current shortage of yellow bus drivers and available vehicles, the WLC is looking to partner with private van and charter bus operations to alleviate the current strain on yellow bus companies. This allocation will allow the collaborative to explore at least one or two long-term partnerships. This may include working with local rental van companies and employing retired school personnel as drivers. School-Driven Innovation Pilots – Educator Leader Teams ($4,500,000) Achievement Solution Pilots – up to $500,000 per school Each school-based educator leader team will be provided with an initial Year 1 allocation of $500,000 to design and implement a pilot solution to an existing school goal, as indicated on the annual success plan.

The use of the Clement Clark Moore poem to decorate the Odessa’s 249-year-old Corbit-Sharp House caught the attention of author Pamela McColl, who has written a book tracing the art and history of the Moore’s classic poem, and “Mr. Christmas” Benjamin Bradley, who hosts Netflix’s “Holiday Home Makeover.” They’ll be in Odessa to celebrate the bicentennial of “Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas,” which is the real title of the enduring poem published anonymously in 2023. McColl, a historian and author of “Twas The Night: The Art and History of the Classic Christmas Poem,” will be introduced by Bradley at 4:30 p.m. in the Corbit-Sharp House for her lecture about the book and research. She will sign books after her talk. The event is expected to end by 7:30 p.m. McColl’s book traces the evolution of the holiday and shows how the historic figure of Saint Nicholas evolves into the central character in the story. It also talks about how characteristics of today’s Santa Claus originated with Clement Clark Moore. She uses dozens of vintage illustrations from the thousands of editions published over the last 200 years in her presentation. McColl created a sensation in 2012 when she published “Twas the Night Before Christmas,” edited by Santa Claus for the Benefit of Children of the 21st Century. It was hailed as the first “smoke-free” edition of the poem since McColl omitted the image of Santa smoking a pipe with a ring of smoke over his head. It not only was covered by an amazing amount of national and international press, but also won Global EBook Best Christian Book of 2012, A Gold Medal Best Holiday Book for the Moonbeam Children’s Book awards, and four Benjamin Franklin book awards for 2013. Odessa display designer Brian Miller, who used the “Twas the Night Before Christmas” as a decorating theme in 2006 said it was a no-brainer to bring the poem back to celebrate its bicentennial. The exhibit also marks the 35th year Historic Odessa has been picking a piece of children’s literature as a theme for decorating one of its houses. Bradley, a member of the organization Golden Glow of Christmas Past, has loaned some of his vintage Christmas decorations to Historic Odessa’s holiday exhibit celebrating the classic poem turning 200. Three members of that organization have loaned original “Twas the Night” books and artwork from the many editions of the poems. They are on display in the hall entrance of the Corbit-Sharp House. Miller hopes their presence will allow visitors to spot — but not touch — the version they read as children, as well as the versions they may have read to their children and grandchildren later. “I think that’s a really cool thing,” Miller said. Odessa’s Delaware connection One of the Delaware connections to the poem is that Claymont resident and illustrator F.O.C. Darley did the artwork for an 1862 version of the poem. The Darley House, now owned by the Claymont Renaissance Development Corp., has loaned seven framed reproduction art works from that book to Historic Odessa for the display. “It’s one of the coolest things in the house,” Miller said. “They each have the words of the poem below each illustration.” Darley’s work ties into Delaware’s and the Brandywine Valley’s long history of area illustrators include Howard Pyle, Maxfield Parrish, Frank Schoonover and N.C. Wyeth “What I love about Darley is that he was before Howard Pyle and the others, so it’s nice to highlight another Delawarean,” he said. Miller said he was able to reuse a few things from his 2006 display, including the stockings hung by the chimney with care. “They’re very hard to find with a sort-of old style look,” he said. He also reused a plate of cookies but upped the ante, by having Santa spill the milk in the kitchen and leave the mess, courtesy of a fake spill they had created by a food artist. “People have seemed to have liked that already,” he said. IN THE NEWS: Take a look at these 10 Delaware holiday pop-up bars Many visitors have been a little surprised to find the children and the parents in their beds, he said. But, Miller notes, he’s just illustrating the “snug in their beds” part of the tale, before the daddy hears Santa arrive. Some of his decorations were pulled from Historic Odessa’s collections and he made some. Miller is particularly proud that “Twas the Night Before Christmas” is an American holiday story. Most of the children’s Christmas literature is English, he said. To celebrate that, the tree in the parlor is festooned with American flags. He is particularly delighted with the way the parents’ bedroom turned out. Its paneled walls are a verdigris green. Instead of using red in the room, he chose to use oranges, which pop against the background color. “The orange is an old symbol related to St. Nicholas,” he said. That little tidbit is an example of the research and inspiration behind all the exhibits, he said. There’s lots of red and white, a collection of Santas, sleigh bells, and plenty of homey touches like popcorn and cranberry garlands spread throughout the house. “If ever there was a year that shows Christmas, this is the year,” Miller said. “Some of our other stories, it happened in the background and I had to kind of bring it in subtly, kind of through the back door. “But this is full-tilt Christmas, and what a great way to celebrate 200 years.” If you go Visitors can tour the exhibit and property through Dec. 31, 2023. Historic Odessa is open to the public March through December, Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and Sunday 1 to 4:30 p.m. Monday by reservation. Admission is adults, $10; groups, seniors and students, $8; children under 6 […]"
