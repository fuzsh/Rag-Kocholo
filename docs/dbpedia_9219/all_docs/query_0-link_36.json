        "text": "U.S. Marine Corps Capt. Jason Kellam serves in the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) as the assistant operations officer in the G-6 communications section. Throughout his twenty-year career he served first as an enlisted Marine, earning the rank of staff sergeant, then commissioned into the warrant officer program, earning the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 3. He now serves as a limited duty officer (LDO) at the rank of Captain. For Kellam, leading within each rank structure came not only with different expectations, but also provided different opportunities. Kellam initially considered joining the Marine Corps during his senior year in high school. Unsure of which jobs were available, at first he decided against joining. Later, faced with a growing family, he decided to enlist with a signing bonus into the 2841 military occupational specialty (MOS), ground radio repairer, now called ground electronics transmission systems maintainer. His early enlisted years included a deployment to Iraq as a member of a provisional rifle company, which in part inspired him to reenlist. \"Other reasons that helped [me] to make the decision was that it was 2008, the housing market and economy had crashed, unemployment was high, and the Marine Corps was offering me a sizeable bonus, a decent duty station, and four years of employment,\" said Kellum. After achieving the rank of staff sergeant during his second enlistment and deploying twice to Okinawa with 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment as an electronics maintenance chief, Kellam began considering the Marine Corps warrant officer program. “These were the people in my MOS community that were able to make things happen,” Kellam said. “I enjoy solving complex problems and projects and that’s what warrant officers in my community do.” The warrant officer program is designed to provide the Marine Corps with technical specialists who perform duties that require extensive knowledge of a particular military occupational specialty, and can be assigned successive tours of duty in their primary MOS. After his appointment to Warrant Officer, Kellam was assigned to Communications Company, 4th Marine Division, and served as site support staff. After seeing the positive impacts made on the local community by the Marine Corps, Kellam then decided to request a commission as a limited duty officer (LDO). “Senior chief warrant officers in my MOS tend to stay more technically engaged with equipment specifics,” said Kellam. “LDOs tend to become more engaged with policies and procedures and also have opportunities to be company commanders.” Kellam decided to go the LDO route because he enjoyed working on large scale projects and leading Marines. The Marine Corps LDO program is designed to provide technically oriented officers to perform duties that are limited to specific occupational specialties, require authority and responsibility greater than that normally expected of a warrant officer, require strong managerial skills, and are outside the normal development pattern for unrestricted officers or for which no unrestricted officers are available. “It was rewarding to help young Marines develop new skills and mentor them in as many areas as I could,” Kellam said. “I realized that the scope of impact would be much larger as a limited duty officer and it is one of the things I’ve tremendously enjoyed, influencing Marines and having an impact on what we do and how we do it.” Since becoming an LDO and serving as a Captain, Kellam has been able to provide an even wider influence both within 2nd MAW and across his occupational field. Twice each year, Kellam participates in the ground electronics maintenance advisory group, a Marine Corps-wide event in which senior leaders and available ranks from the community gather to deliver updates, discuss issues, and work on projects regarding topics of interest to the community. Through this venue, Kellam is able to collaborate with representatives from 1st and 3rd MAWs on topics that affect communication systems maintenance across the Marine Corps. After twenty years of service, each day Capt. Kellam uses the lessons learned and skillsets he gained within three unique rank communities to support 2nd MAW's mission.\n\ncontinue reading\n\nMarine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron (HMLA) 269, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), reactivated during a ceremony aboard Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, North Carolina, July 1. HMLA-269, known as “The Gunrunners,” previously deactivated on Dec. 9, 2022, in accordance with Force Design initiatives. Throughout the course of the squadron’s brief deactivation, the Marine Corps conducted analysis on force management in order to ensure that no operational commitments were left unfulfilled. This analysis identified the need for an additional HMLA squadron on the East Coast to provide sustained operational support to II Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF). This change within 2nd MAW represents incremental change to Force Design to meet the conditions described in recent national security and defense strategies. The reactivation ceremony featured remarks from Col. David Fitzsimmons, commanding officer, Marine Aircraft Group 29, who thanked the various advocates at 2nd MAW, II MEF, and Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, that made HMLA-269's reactivation possible. “It was a decidedly somber day when HMLA-269 deactivated,” said Fitzsimmons. “That was certainly reversed today.” Also present was Lt. Col. Jens Gilbertson, commanding officer, HMLA-269, who highlighted Marine Attack Helicopter Squadron (HMA) 269’s legacy as the Marine Corps’ first attack helicopter squadron and recounted the multiple pilots and aircrew within HMA and HMLA-269's history who received the Distinguished Flying Cross. He noted that HMA and HMLA-269 was recognized eight times by the Marine Corps Aviation Association as the Marine Corps’ Light Attack Helicopter Squadron of the Year, more so than any other Marine Corps light attack helicopter squadron in history. Gilbertson also recognized the Marines of HMLA-269 who enabled the squadron’s reactivation. “Ultimately, it was up to these Marines to get it done,” said Gilbertson. “They have discipline, and they have precision, and that’s the same discipline and precision they’re going to bring when they maintain and fly our aircraft.” The squadron will resume operating the AH-1Z “Viper” attack helicopter and the UH-1Y “Venom” utility helicopter. Both aircraft are manned, trained, and equipped to fight from the sea into austere environments and confined littoral spaces, and support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force by providing offensive air support, utility support, armed escort, and airborne supporting arms coordination.\n\ncontinue reading"
