        "text": "Military Escort probably has introduced more Americans to the regimental march style than any title in that vast and fascinating musical literature. And while it may not enjoy–in this era of supposed musical sophistication–the position it held so firmly half a century ago, it remains a classic example of effective and disarming simplicity, reflecting the innocence and charm of a bygone time in American music education. Its composer, the versatile and enormously gifted musician, Henry Fillmore, wrote it under the Harold Bennett pseudonym as part of what became the famous Bennett Band Book No. 1–A Collection of Original Compositions for Band. This was in 1923 when organized instrumental music instruction and participation were in their infancy in our public institutions.\n\nToday’s plush bandrooms generously staffed and with their long corridors of practice rooms, instrument lockers, orthopedically designed chairs, forests of music stands–and instruments tuned at the factory were but the wildest dreams of the dedicated bandmaster who taught his kids the fingerings in the boiler room.\n\nAfter the kids knew how to play–what would they play? Henry Fillmore knew what they could play. His Bennett Band Books (there were 4) held out genuine incentive, honest reward, and that ultimate satisfaction in performance for which there are no words. The various musical styles contained in these books offered Waltzes, Serenades, Overtures, Fox Trots, Two-Steps, and Marches; Military Escort is No. 7. With these sixteen titles printed in the then convenient double fold march size format, Henry Fillmore probably was a greater part of the initial ensemble musical experience for more instrumentalists than any single composer whose music was played in the schools of the United States in the 2nd quarter of the 20th century. The Bennett Band Books became the model for the many others that still follow."
