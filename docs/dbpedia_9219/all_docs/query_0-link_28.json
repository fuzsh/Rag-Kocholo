How can my city earn this designation?\n\nYou may contact your local Coast Guard unit or the Coast Guard's Community Relations Branch in Washington, D.C. , at (202) 372-4609 to request support of an event.\n\nThe Coast Guard participates in official civil ceremonies, including inaugurals, dedications of public buildings and projects, ceremonies for official visitors, and the convening of legislative bodies. The Coast Guard often participates in patriotic programs, national holiday celebrations and events open to the public with no charge for admission. However, uniformed Coast Guard personnel may not participate as ushers, escorts, doormen, drivers, etc., for non-military guests or local dignitaries.\n\nAdditionally, the Coast Guard participates in commercial events under certain conditions. The Coast Guard generally does not participate in events that charge for admission, unless our participation is incidental to the program, is patriotic in nature, and does not benefit or appear to benefit selectively the commercial activity of the sponsor. The Coast Guard does not participate in events that charge for admission if our participation is, or could be considered to be, the primary or major attraction. As an example, a color guard appearance at a professional football game is incidental to the event, is not designed to be a drawing factor for the game and does not add to the spectators' cost.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nWhere can I find information about joining the Coast Guard?\n\nFor information about career opportunities, benefits, programs etc., visit www.gocoastguard.com. Or, locate your nearest recruiter by visiting the Find A Recruiter section which provides addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail contact information\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow do I find out if there's a Coast Guard unit near my home, and how do I arrange a visit?\n\nCheck out our map and listing of Coast Guard units on our Service's home page at: http://www.news.uscg.mil/News_Region/.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow do I request a Coast Guard speaker for my organization?\n\nContact the Coast Guard district public affairs office nearest you (see table below) or the Coast Guard's Community Relations Branch in Washington, D.C. , at (202) 372-4643 to request a speaker. Many Coast Guard units have Speakers Bureaus to support such requests. Units unable to accommodate requests often seek support from local Coast Guard Auxiliary units, many of which have Auxiliarists available and prepared to conduct such speaking engagements.\n\nCoast Guard District Public Affairs Offices:\n\nFirst Coast Guard District\n\nBoston, MA (617) 223-8515\n\nEighth Coast Guard District\n\nNew Orleans, LA (504) 671-2020\n\nThirteenth Coast Guard District\n\nSeattle, WA (206) 220-7237\n\nFifth Coast Guard District\n\nPortsmouth, VA (757) 398-6272\n\nNinth Coast Guard District\n\nCleveland, OH (216) 902-6020/21\n\nFourteenth Coast Guard District\n\nHonolulu, HI (808) 535-3230\n\nSeventh Coast Guard District\n\nMiami, FL (305) 415-6683\n\nEleventh Coast Guard District\n\nAlameda, CA (510) 437-3325\n\nSeventeenth Coast Guard District\n\nJuneau, AK (907) 463-2065\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow do I request an exhibit of Coast Guard artwork for my organization?\n\nThe Coast Guard's Community Relations Branch maintains a collection of original artwork. Works from this collection can be requested for exhibit by public entities such as museums, libraries, schools, and veterans' organizations as well as Coast Guard units, other military services and branches of the federal government. Requesting organizations are responsible for the safety and continued good condition of the artwork while it is in their custody.\n\nWorks and easels for displaying them are available by placing a request through the Coast Guard's Community Relations Branch, (202) 372-4643, at least six months prior to the intended display. Long-term displays of several weeks to months are preferred, especially when these are viewed by a large audience. Images of works in the collection along with titles, artist names and captions can be viewed on the following site.\n\nCoast Guard Visual Imagery website: https://www.dvidshub.net/search/?filter[type]=image&filter[branch]=Coast Guard&sort=date\n\nMuch of the information can be downloaded or copied to create handouts.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow do I request a Coast Guard aircraft exhibit?\n\nRequests must be submitted in writing to the Coast Guard Public Affairs Office.\n\nCoast Guard aircraft participate in appropriate public events that help contribute to public knowledge of the Coast Guard. Participation may be a flyover, demonstration or static display. Appropriate events include airport dedications, air shows, expositions and fairs.\n\nStatic displays must be held at airfields or heliports. Civilian sponsors must agree to provide or reimburse transportation, meals and lodging costs of Coast Guard participants. Sponsors also must provide suitable aircraft fuel at military contract prices. Sponsors are required to pay all costs over military contract prices, including any transportation and handling charges, if fuel is not available at such prices.\n\nAerial demonstrations must be within FAA guidelines and must be over open water or suitable open areas of land, where spectators will be safe.\n\nThe Coast Guard may support flyovers for civic-sponsored, public ceremonies such as: Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day and for similar local holidays overseas; memorial services for dignitaries of the armed forces or federal government; national conventions of veterans' organizations; and occasions of more than local interest designed primarily to encourage the advancement of aviation.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nWhere can I see the Coast Guard Cutter EAGLE?\n\nEAGLE's schedule can be found on the Coast Guard Academy 's Web pages at the following link: http://www.cga.edu/eagle.aspx?id=690\n\nEAGLE's primary mission is to assist in the training of Coast Guard Academy cadets. The Commanding Officer of EAGLE begins planning the port schedule one year in advance, with requests or recommendations on domestic port visits due at the Coast Guard Academy not later than 1 September the year before the cruise. The Coast Guard receives more requests than can be accommodated without interfering with EAGLE's training mission. For more information, contact the Coast Guard's Community Relations Branch at (202) 372-4609.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow may I request that the Coast Guard Band perform in my town?\n\nRequests for the Coast Guard Band at public events must be in the best interests of the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard will participate only if the event (parade, concert, etc.) meets general community relations criteria, at no additional cost to the government. The sponsor - often a local newspaper - must fund transportation, meals, lodging, promotion efforts, ticket printing and distribution, programs, sites, and all incidental expenses connected with the appearance. Such funding is legally considered as a gift.\n\nThe band conducts a regional tour each year, with free public concert appearances. Daytime school visits are often included in the band's tour. Tour schedules are normally decided one year in advance and generally do not allow for added performances. If you want your community considered in a future tour, submit your suggestion early to the Coast Guard's Community Relations Branch at (202) 372-4609. For the tours, the Community Relations Branch funds tour transportation and per diem. Local sponsors are required to fund and carry out promotion, ticket printing and distribution, programs, sites, and all incidental expenses connected to the performance.\n\nAlso, please note that there are several restrictions on use of the Coast Guard Band:\n\nMilitary musicians are prohibited by law from playing at public-domain events that put them in competition with non-military musicians.\n\nThe band may, with approval of the Community Relations Branch, provide patriotic programs at national conventions and meetings of nationally-recognized civic, patriotic and veterans ' organizations.\n\nThe band receives more requests than it can fill. To ensure the widest exposure and to avoid favoritism, repeat performances are generally not granted.\n\nEven when the band is committed for an event, official Coast Guard activities take precedence over any other appearance.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow may I request that the Coast Guard Ceremonial Honor Guard support my organization's event?\n\nThe Coast Guard Ceremonial Honor Guard is stationed at U.S. Coast Guard Telecommunications and Information Systems Command, Alexandria, Va. The Ceremonial Honor Guard is under the direct control of the Military District of Washington (MDW) and loaned to the Coast Guard for special events. MDW uses the Ceremonial Honor Guard for White House functions, dignitary visits, state funerals and other high-level, official ceremonial events.\n\nWithin the Ceremonial Honor Guard are separate teams - a precision drill team, a parade unit and a color guard. These units may be available for public performances; however, official Honor Guard activities take priority over other appearances. Please contact the Coast Guard Community Relations Branch at (202) 372-4609 to request support for engagements outside Washington, D.C.\n\nRequests from the public for events must be in the best interests of the Coast Guard and the event sponsor. The Coast Guard will participate only if the event meets general community relations criteria and is without additional cost to the government. The sponsor must fund transportation, meals, lodging, promotion efforts, ticket printing and distribution, programs, sites, and all incidental expenses connected with the appearance.\n\nNeither the Ceremonial Honor Guard, nor its units, go on tour.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nMay I use the words \"U.S . Coast Guard\" in promotional material?\n\nFederal law (14 USC, Section 639) is the basis for Coast Guard policy. The law protects the words \" United States Coast Guard,\" or any variation thereof, including but not limited to \"USCG\" and \"U.S. Coast Guard.\" This law prohibits the use of these words as part of a business name; for the purposes of trade or business; or as part of any advertisement that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual, business or association has any connection with the Coast Guard. The law also prohibits anyone from falsely representing that any project, business, product or service is in anyway endorsed, authorized or approved by the Coast Guard.\n\nThe Coast Guard may approve the use of its protected words by non-federal entities provided that the usage falls within the provisions of the federal law, the public interest is served and the Coast Guard in no way appears to endorse a product or service.\n\nTo submit a request, please contact the Community Relations Branch at (202) 372-4640.\n\nThe words \"United States Coast Guard\" or \"USCG\" or any variation thereof may not be used for commercial purposes as part of an Internet domain name, email address or to \"brand\" Internet pages by any commercial or private entity.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nMay I use Coast Guard insignia, such as the Coast Guard Seal, Emblem and Mark, in promotional material or on products?\n\nThe Coast Guard Seal is a pair of crossed anchors superimposed by a life ring with shield and surrounded by a line grommet. The Seal must not be reproduced outside the Coast Guard.\n\nThe Coast Guard Mark - known as the racing stripe - and Emblem - similar to the Seal but without the line grommet - must not be reproduced outside the Coast Guard without approval. Please visit the Insignia Requests page for more information.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nMay I photograph or videotape Coast Guard personnel for my promotional material?\n\nPlease visit our advertising policy, which can be accessed by visiting http://cgvi.uscg.mil/media/advertising_notice.html\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow may I obtain official Coast Guard photographs for personal or commercial use?\n\nPlease visit our advertising policy, which can be accessed by visiting http://cgvi.uscg.mil/media/advertising_notice.html.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nMay I advertise on Coast Guard Internet sites?\n\nOfficial Coast Guard Internet sites may not include any advertisements.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nMay I link my Internet page to and from Coast Guard Internet sites?\n\nOfficial Coast Guard Internet sites often provide hyperlinks to sites outside the public sector provided that there is no perception of implied endorsement of any product or service. Links from official Coast Guard Internet sites to external Internet sites are decided on an individual case basis by the Coast Guard office having responsibility for the Internet site making the link. Decisions to link to external sites are made after assessing relevance to the office mission and maintenance factors. Links to external sites may not be used to endorse a particular non-governmental product or service or provide preferential treatment.\n\nCommercial and personal Internet sites may include links to official Coast Guard Internet sites. The Coast Guard Emblem and Mark may be used as hyperlink buttons from a commercial site to an official Coast Guard site provided that the insignia is used in good taste and is not used to portray the commercial site as an official Coast Guard site. The Coast Guard Seal is reserved for official Coast Guard use and may not be used as a hyperlink button on such sites. Coast Guard logos and graphics may not be used to create a non-official Internet site that gives the appearance and general look and feel of the official USCG Internet site.\n\nInformation presented on Coast Guard Internet sites is considered public information and may be distributed, copied or linked by non-Coast Guard Internet sites. However, the contents of Coast Guard Internet sites may not be used for commercial purposes or to imply endorsement by the U.S. Coast Guard of products or services.\n\nThe words \"United States Coast Guard\" or \"USCG\" or any variation thereof may not be used for commercial purposes as part of an Internet domain name, email address or to \"brand\" Internet pages by any commercial or private entity. Federal law (14 USC, Section 639) is the basis for this Coast Guard policy. The law prohibits unauthorized use of the words \"Coast Guard,\" or any variation thereof, to lead people to believe that any individual, association or business has any connection with the Coast Guard. The same law also prohibits anyone from falsely representing that a product or service is in any way endorsed, authorized or approved by the Coast Guard.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow may I obtain a Coast Guard flag?\n\nThe Coast Guard has both an Ensign (vertical red stripes) and a Standard (white field with blue eagle).\n\nThe Ensign is a symbol of United States Coast Guard law enforcement authority and is, by law, restricted to official use only.\n\nThe Coast Guard Standard is used during parades and ceremonies and is adorned by our 34 battle streamers. Service-related organizations may use the Standard on temporary loan with approval from the Coast Guard's Community Relations Branch.\n\nThe Coast Guard cannot donate or sell flags to individuals or organizations.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nWhat does it mean to be \"A Coast Guard City\"? How can my city earn this designation?\n\nThe Commandant takes great pride in the many services provided by the men and women of the Coast Guard to American citizens in general and, in particular, to the residents of the communities in which they are assigned. It is the intent of this program, in accordance with federal law, to provide for the recognition of those cities that, in return, have made special efforts to acknowledge the professional work of the Coast Guard men and women assigned to their area by regularly reaching out to them and their families and making them feel \"at home at their home away from home.\" Such efforts should be indicative of a longstanding and enduring relationship with an emphasis on considerations the community has made for the members of the Coast Guard family and their dependents.\n\nBackground\n\nOn November 13, 1998, a law was enacted that allowed the city of Grand Haven, Mich. , to formally be called \" Coast Guard City, USA \" (Section 409 of P.L. 105-383). That law also provides for other cities to be similarly designated with a 90-day notice of intent from the Commandant to the two authorizing congressional committees.\n\nIn accordance with that provision, on June 3, 2000, Eureka, Calif. , became the second city to receive the tribute and was proclaimed \"A Coast Guard City.\" Grand Haven's designation was based on their 75-year-long history of extraordinary support for Coast Guard personnel assigned to the Grand Haven area. Eureka 's designation, likewise, was based on a multi-year history of community sensitivity to the needs of the local Coast Guard personnel and the many actions they took and activities they sponsored each year to benefit the Coast Guard personnel in their area. While formal criteria did not exist for the designations of either Grand Haven or Eureka , the precedence of those actions provided de facto criteria for future considerations.\n\nProcedures\n\nA city or municipality must make formal request by letter, signed by the mayor or city manager, addressed to Commandant (CG-092), 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE, Washington, D.C. 20593 . The request must include a narrative of no more than two pages describing its relationship with the local Coast Guard unit(s) in terms that would be indicative of a proactive, systematic outreach and support agenda based on community-wide efforts. In addition, the city must provide a separate document listing specific examples of actions the community has taken and events it has sponsored that would be descriptive of how it has reached out to Coast Guard personnel, welcomed them into the community, and embraced them in a full community partnership. A board at Coast Guard Headquarters will review the request, consider recommendations from the appropriate field commands and, should the request meet the requirements detailed below, provide a recommendation to the Commandant.\n\nUpon approval by the Commandant, the appropriate congressional committees will be notified and a required 90-day waiting period will begin. With no dissent from either committee, the requesting city will be proclaimed to be \"A Coast Guard City.\" The proclamation will have a five-year term after which the city will be required to apply for recertification. Recertification is an abbreviated form of the procedures required for the original request in that the city need only provide a letter six months prior to the end of the five-year term describing its on-going relationship with the Coast Guard with examples of their recent programs and projects.\n\nRequirements\n\nA city's request will be judged against the following list of actions and programs that are examples of the types of support shown Coast Guard personnel in cities where the Coast Guard serves. It is not necessary for a city to have initiated nor replicated every one of the actions listed. Rather, a city should be able to demonstrate that its people and the community at large have consistently reached out to the local Coast Guard command(s) in a manner that would include, but not be limited to, a number of the initiatives below. In addition, the request should specify which groups or organizations within the community are responsible for, or participated in, the initiatives. They could include city government, Chamber of Commerce, non-government organizations (e.g., Navy League), civic organizations (e.g., Lions, Kiwanis, etc.), corporate, police/sheriffs/fire departments, EMS , educational organizations, or individuals.\n\nSupport for Coast Guard morale, welfare and recreation events.\n\nSupport for educational/scholarship programs.\n\nAvailability of community support services to Coast Guard members and their families.\n\nSponsorship of Sailor of the Quarter, Sailor of the Year, Recruiter of the Year, and other similar types of awards.\n\nDemonstrations of sensitivity to life-altering events within the Coast Guard community including expressions of congratulations for weddings and newborns, and expressions of sympathy or deaths and other family tragedies.\n\nSponsorship of community patriotic events that specifically include members of the Coast Guard family. These events could include but not be limited to Memorial Day picnics, July Fourth picnics, Armed Forces Day events, Veterans Day observances, Coast Guard Birthday events, etc.\n\nOffer military or Coast Guard \"Days\" within the business community, at local sporting events, and other entertainment events.\n\nCity-Coast Guard partnerships in community-based projects including law enforcement/fire/EMS projects, civic organizational projects, food drives, home building projects, educational projects, etc.\n\nEstablishing monuments, memorials, commemorations, or other tangible forms of public recognition."
