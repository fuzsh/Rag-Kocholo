The service began on the steps of the Library and concluded inside the Place of Meditation where Eisenhower is buried.\n\nGun Salutes\n\nThere were four gun salutes during the Eisenhower funeral ceremonies:\n\n1. When the body was taken to the Capitol, a saluting battery (1 officer and 13 enlisted men) fired a 21-gun salute at 5 second intervals.\n\n2. When the body arrived at Union Station, a saluting battery (1 officer and 13 enlisted men) fired a 21-gun salute beginning when the hearse entered Delaware Avenue with the last shot fired as the hearse stopped at the entrance at Union Station.\n\n3. Before benediction in Place of Meditation, six howitzers manned by 2 officers and 36 enlisted men delivered a 21-gun salute.\n\n4. After benediction, a firing party (8 members) discharged three volleys.\n\nResting Place\n\nPlace of Meditation\n\nLocated across from the Eisenhower Home is the Place of Meditation, the final resting place of Dwight D. Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States. In November 1979 Mamie Doud Eisenhower was interred in the building. Dwight and Mamie's first born son, Doud Dwight, was interred in 1966. The Place of Meditation was built with private funds under the auspices of the Eisenhower Presidential Library Commission.\n\nOutstanding elements of the interior design of the Place of Meditation are the richly colored windows, the Travertine marble wall panels, the walnut woodwork, and the large embroidered hanging, which carries the words of the prayer that President Eisenhower wrote for his first Inaugural Address on January 20, 1953. There is a meditation portion of the building where, according to General Eisenhower's wishes, it was hoped that visitors would reflect upon the ideals that made this a great nation and pledge themselves again to continued loyalty to those ideals.\n\nCasket\n\nThe casket is $80 government issue requested by Eisenhower. The only difference between his casket and those furnished for any soldier buried by the Army is an inner glass seal that cost an extra $115. It was lined with tailored eggshell crepe.\n\nUniform\n\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower was buried in his World War II uniform. It consists of “pink” trousers and the green “Ike” jacket that he made famous. Although he was one of the most decorated military men in history, his uniform had only the following medals: Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Navy Distinguished Service Medal, and the Legion of Merit.\n\nVault\n\nThe vault is bronze and cement. Both Dwight and Mamie's graves are covered with a marble slab.\n\nMarkers\n\n11 3/4\" x 8\" x 3/4\" bronze.\n\nMarker Inscriptions:"
