Fillmore bought the work for $35, revised the melody and harmony, added an additional 96 bars of his own material, and copyrighted the march in 1923 for both band and orchestra, using his Harold Bennett pseudonym.\n\nDesigned for beginning groups, Fillmore was amazed when the manuscript was read by his Shrine Band, and the members proclaimed it one of his very best marches. The composer apparently did not realize that the open-tone cornet fanfares and low brass melodies, as well as the repetitive \"shave-and-a-haircut\" rhythms, had been familiar to instrumentalists for centuries. Using these basic patterns, Fillmore produced an uncomplicated masterpiece which rises and falls in the band popularity polls but never disappears. According to Paul Bierley, Military Escort even outsold The Stars and Stripes Forever march for a period of about four years. A few years later, Sousa told Fillmore, \"I wish that march had my name on it!\"\n\n- Program Note by Program Notes for Band\n\nMedia\n\nAudio: Reference recording.
