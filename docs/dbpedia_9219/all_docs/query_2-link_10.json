A full-time experienced tour escort travels with each group to ensure that group members will have an enjoyable and rewarding travel experience.\n\nIn the view of American Music Abroad, music is indeed an “international language”. It is our mission to provide opportunities for musical exchange fostering better understanding and friendship."
