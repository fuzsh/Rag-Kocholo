        "text": "In February 1990, I flew to the USA to interview him for Irish music magazine Hot Press. I was 28 years old, on my first trip to the States, sitting jetlagged in a soulless Detroit arena. The star had performed at the Grammys in LA the night before, where his megahit We Didn’t Start the Fire had been nominated for three awards; it failed to win any. Then he’d flown with his deflated band all the way across the country to resume touring. They weren’t exactly tearing the house down. I left before encores to find a cab back to my hotel.\n\nImagine my astonishment when I walked into the quiet hotel bar … to see Billy Joel sitting alone at a table drinking a beer. Our interview was scheduled for the next day, but I cautiously introduced myself, uncertain whether he would welcome the attention. “Siddown,” said the star. “If I wanted to drink alone, I would have stayed in my room.”\n\nAnd so the first of many drinks were ordered, beers followed by whiskey shots, as Billy explained how he had got to the hotel before me by running straight off the stage and into a van with a police escort, changing out of sweaty clothes whilst running red lights. “This is the greatest thing about this gig, cops stopping traffic for me. They should really be arresting someone like me!”\n\nBilly turned out to be a very funny, down to earth guy. “Whaddya make of the show?” he asked but didn’t wait for an answer. “It was a bad one. You came all the way from Ireland for that? We were all exhausted. This has been hell week, man! Guess you watched the Grammy’s last night? It’s OK, I got five of the suckers already! It’s a cheap little trophy. It’s something you can get in a trophy store for about 20 bucks. The horn unscrews. The little plaque that they put on slides off. It doesn’t legitimise songwriting.”\n\nBilly was on a roll, mixing up streetwise New York banter, with mimicry and sound effects, and the timing of a standup comedian. His most acerbic remarks were saved for his losing song, We Didn’t Start the Fire. “It’s really just a laundry list,” he muttered. “It started out as a rap song – that’s an oxymoron! A rap thing! I thought maybe I could bullsh-t my way onto the radio, call myself Plain White Wrapper, put a paper bag on my head!”\n\nAfter a while, the bar started to fill up, and we were joined by members of his band and crew. A character called Rocco sat down, introduced as a friend from his hometown of Hicksville, Long Island – a big, slick Italian American with a head that looked like someone had used it as a punching bag. “We set Rocco on the record company when we want to avoid them,” said Billy. “He could tell them, ‘Billy can’t make it today, he can’t find his underwear’ and they’ll go, ‘Oh, OK.’”\n\nAt the time, Billy was married to supermodel Christie Brinkley, and he slipped off to call his wife, who was visiting family in Hawaii. “Hawaii’s like paradise, you know,” he said on his return. “You can’t have a fight with your wife when her parents own a beautiful beach house in Hawaii. It’s like any excuse to pack your bags and run home to momma!”\n\nWith his sharp suit and tight curly haircut, Billy had a look that might be characterised as New York Italian but allied to a self-deprecating Jewish vein of humour. Which, it turned out, is exactly how he saw himself. “I was the only Jew in an Italian neighbourhood! I went to Catholic church! The only times I ever realised I was Jewish was when some kid would go ‘You killed Christ!’ ‘I did not!’ And I’d get into a fight.”\n\nAfter that, the night began to go awry. The bar closed but the manager kept supplying us with drinks. Around two in the morning, Billy drifted to a baby grand piano and began to tickle the ivories, treating us to As Time Goes By. He talked about the piano as “the emperor of instruments” and gave us a chordal tour of the world: “Ireland is like an open 5th, a very sort of sad chord. America is A Major, very positive and bland.”\n\nHe improvised comedic blues and played some rock’n’roll. The manager begged him to sing his sentimental hit, Just The Way You Are, written for his first wife before a bitter divorce. “It makes my feet lead, that song,” he demurred. “My mind wanders whenever we play it. I start ‘Don’t go changin’ nah nah nah’ and I forget the words, and go ‘She got the house, the dog, the car …’” Instead, he ran through some Beatles songs, which was all the excuse I needed to belt out Twist and Shout with Billy Joel. It was four in the morning by the time the party broke up, leaving a few stragglers unconscious in their chairs.\n\nThe next day, I was standing in the lobby, head pounding with an almighty hangover, when I was approached by Billy’s tour manager. “You f---ed my man! You f---ed my man!” he was roaring. Turns out, Billy had woken up barely able to speak, and he still had three more shows to play in Detroit. He did eventually make it down to croak through a ragged interview, a couple of hours late. “Hell week continues,” he grimaced.\n\nBilly Joel plays Principality Stadium, Cardiff, tonight; tickets"
