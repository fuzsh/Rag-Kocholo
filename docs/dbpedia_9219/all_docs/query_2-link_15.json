This may result in inaccuracies.\n\nSmoothing has been applied to series for lower-frequency words, using a moving-average algorithm. This reduces short-term fluctuations, which may be produced by variability in the content of the Google Books corpus.\n\nDecade Frequency per million words 17501.817601.517701.717801.917902.518003.118104.218205.018305.718406.118506.718606.818706.918807.118907.319006.819105.919205.319305.219405.419505.219604.619704.119803.719903.720003.720103.8\n\nFrequency of escort, n., 2017–2023\n\n* Occurrences per million words in written English\n\nModern frequency series are derived from a corpus of 20 billion words, covering the period from 2017 to the present.
