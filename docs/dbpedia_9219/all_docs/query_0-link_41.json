        "text": "Retired Marine Corps Gen. Gen. Alfred Gray Jr., the 29th commandant of the Corps, was laid to rest with full military honors Monday at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va.\n\nGray died March 20 at 95.\n\nGray, from Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1950 and commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1952, according to his official biography. He served a tour as an artillery officer with the 2nd Battalion, 11th Marines, and a subsequent tour as an infantry officer with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines.\n\nGray served for nearly three years in Vietnam before returning to Washington for duty in February 1968. Then-Maj. Gray received the Silver Star Medal for his actions on May 14, 1967, for rushing into a minefield to save an injured Marine, guiding medical attention to the Marine and administering first aid, according to his citation.\n\nGray was promoted to general and became commandant on July 1, 1987, and retired from the service on June 30, 1991. The general oversaw significant changes to the Marine Corps during his time, including the development and publication of Fleet Marine Force Manual 1, also known as “Warfighting.”\n\nGray also placed emphasis on large-scale operations in desert and cold-weather environments, as well as robust maritime special operations capabilities. His staunch advocacy for military education resulted in the establishment of Marine Corps University in August 1989 while he was commandant.\n\nGray was interred with his wife, Janie Ann Gray. As Gray and his wife had no surviving family, U.S. Marine Corps retired Lt. Gen. George Flynn received the U.S. flag from Gray’s funeral service."
