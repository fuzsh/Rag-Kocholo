Irving Newman in Section 4 of Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Va., Apr. 11, 2024. \r\n\r\nFrom a news release from Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA):\r\n\r\nIn May 1943, Newman was assigned to the 343d Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 98th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 9th Air Force, in the European Theater. On May 6, Newman along with the other nine crew members of a B-24D Liberator were participating in a bombing mission of Reggio di Calabria harbor, in Sicily. While heading to the target, their plane began experiencing engine trouble forcing the pilots to make a course correction away from the main bomber group, directly into enemy anti-aircraft fire. During an emergency landing the plane caught fire and crashed into the water near Benghajsa Point, Malta, injuring at least five crew members. Nine airmen survived the incident, but Newman was not able to be rescued and his remains were not recovered following the war.\r\n\r\nFollowing the war, the American Graves Registration Command (AGRC), Army Quartermaster Corps, was the organization tasked with recovering missing American personnel in the European Theater. In 1949, a board of officers reviewed the AGRS field investigations for 82 personnel missing from the Mediterranean area, including Newman. The board recommended the individuals be designated non-recoverable. The Identification Branch of the Office of the Quartermaster General approved the recommendation on September 6, 1949.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the University of Malta and a private company located the wreckage of a B-24D near Benghajsa Point, Malta, at a depth of 180 feet. Beginning in 2018, a partner organization supported by DPAA archaeology recovered material evidence, life support equipment, and suspected human remains from this crash site.\r\n\r\nTo identify Newman’s remains, scientists from DPAA used anthropological analysis. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and dental analysis.\r\n\r\nNewman was accounted for June 20, 2023. Edwin Wurster, Newman’s cousin, received the U.S. flag from his funeral service.\r\n\r\n(U.S. Army photo by Elizabeth Fraser / Arlington National Cemetery / released)",
