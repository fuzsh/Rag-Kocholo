        "text": "DETROIT, MI - He's the co-founder of one of the biggest bands of all-time. Don Henley returned to Detroit just four months after rockin' the Joe with the Eagles.\n\nRelated: The Eagles at Joe Louis Arena on July 6, 2015.\n\nThis time was Henley's chance to showcase his solo career, which features his first new album in 15 years, \"Cass County.\" The album debuted at number one on the Country chart. While Henley isn't necessarily a country singer, the songs on the new album show his versatility as a singer/songwriter.\n\nShawn Colvin:\n\nBefore Henley took the Fox Theatre stage on November 7, 2015, singer/songwriter Shawn Colvin performed. Colvin is a three time Grammy Award winner. You may remember her biggest hit \"Sunny Came Home,\" which received a big ovation from the Detroit crowd.\n\nColvin released her ninth album in 2015, \"Uncovered.\" The album is filled with cover songs from artists like Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, and Stevie Wonder.\n\nColvin performed a few songs from the album, including \"Baker Street\" by Gerry Rafferty. Eagles member Steuart Smith took the stage with Colvin for her 45 minute acoustic set. The crowd enjoyed her music and it was good to see her back in Detroit.\n\nDon Henley:\n\nThere's a reason Don Henley is one of the front men for one of the biggest bands in music history. His signature voice has stood the test of time. He sounded great, even without the harmonies he and his fellow Eagles are known for.\n\nHenley brought an eight piece band with him which included Eagles guitarist Steuart Smith, three terrific female background singers and a full five piece horn section which appeared on and off throughout the show.\n\nHis backup singers also had their moments to shine by each performing a duet with him from his new album, since Miranda Lambert, Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood and Dolly Parton, who perform with Henley on the album, could not be in attendance in Detroit, of course.\n\nHe decided to showcase the voices of his band at the start of his nearly 2 and a half hour set as they appeared together center stage performing \"Seven Bridges Road,\" showing fans they have great harmonies, too.\n\nHenley performed numerous songs from his new album including \"Praying For Rain,\" \"Take a Picture of This,\" and \"When I Stop Dreaming.\"\n\nHenley made sure to include all of his big solo hits: \"The End of Innocence,\" \"The Heart of the Matter,\" \"The Last Worthless Evening,\" \"New York Minute,\" \"Dirty Laundry,\" \"The Boys of Summer,\" and \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance.\"\n\nHenley also performed the big 80s hit \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World,\" made famous by Tears for Fears. He didn't change it up at all, which is probably a good thing because that song sounds great just the way it is. It sounded just as great with Henley's strong vocals.\n\nHenley throws fan out of the Fox Theatre:\n\nAbout two hours into the show, Henley shocked the crowd by asking security to escort a fan in the front row out of the Fox. It happened as Henley introduced Eagles guitarist Steuart Smith.\n\nHenley tells MLive the fan in the front row yelled out Don Felder's name. \"So, I called him out,\" said Henley. \"But, he wasn't finished. Then, he blurted out, \"Don Felder taught Tom Petty how to play guitar. I said, ok, that's it, you're outta here and I had security escort him out.\" The audience cheered. Henley then told the crowd \"I did exactly what Glenn (Frey) would have wanted me to do in his hometown.\"\n\nSummary:\n\nAt 68, Henley proved his voice still has plenty of miles left in it. This tour gives fans a chance to hear not only his new music, but his solo hits you don't get to hear much in person. As enjoyable as this show was, here's hoping he tours at least one more time with the Eagles in the near future.\n\nRelated: Detroit native Glenn Frey of the Eagles facing major surgery."
