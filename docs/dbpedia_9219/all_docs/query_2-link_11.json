        "text": "The Reytons will play their biggest show to date in just a number of months.\n\nWhile currently performing across the country on their sell-out UK tour, the group are not showing any signs of slowing down in the near future. Their third album which is slated for release in January will once again demonstrate their determination to put music first.\n\nThe group, hailing from Rotherham, South Yorks, remains unsigned but have a career some artists could only dream of. Earlier this year, they released their second album, What's Rock and Roll? which instantly shot to the top of the charts. Now, frontman Jonny Yerrell, lead guitarist Joe O'Brien, bass player Lee Holland, and drummer Jamie Todd have announced a major show in their hometown.\n\nSpeaking to ITV Calendar, Jonny said: \"It's been a dream for us since the beginning.\" Lee added: \"I think you might find me crying at that point,\" while Jonny added: \"This is not for us, this is not our night, this is everyone's night. There's people visiting Rotherham for Clifton Park from all areas of the UK, it makes us proud. Rotherham's not always had the best press but times are changing.\"\n\nIn a statement, the group said: \"It's happening! Something we've dreamed of since the very beginning... Reytons are headlining Clifton Park! Right in the heart of Rotherham for the biggest concert our town has ever seen. Let's go down in history!\" The news was met with huge excitement, with singer-songwriter Lucy Spraggan responding: \"Absolutely mental. Amazing!\" Meanwhile, Sheffield-based band The Sherlocks commented: \"Well in lads! Smash it.\" \"Class from the boys,\" added another.\n\nWith hits including Kids Off the Estate and Red Smoke, the quartet are known for their high-energy performances and even had a car on stage with them for their headline show at Sheffield's Utilita Arena on September 30. Now, they're swapping arenas and smaller venues for one that they once described as Disney Land â€“ Rotherham's Clifton Park.\n\nThe DIY indie band will play to a jaw-dropping 20,000 fans at the historic venue which is referenced on their hit, Kids Off the Estate, with the lyrics: \"Nintendos came second hand and Clifton Park was Disneyland.\" Clifton Park will also be their biggest show, following their recent gig in Sheffield.\n\nBut while their gig, which is likely to sell out is their biggest show, it's also the biggest outdoor event to take place in Rotherham, it's also the first time a musician has played to fans at Clifton Park since Marc Bolan and T-Rex performed in 1971. Currently, the four lads have sold over 40,000 tickets for their current UK tour, with all four members celebrating on stage at Sheffield as they relived the moment they discovered they had topped the charts.\n\nAs if this wasn't enough, the group are preparing for the release of their third record, Ballad Of A Bystander, which will be available on January 19, 2024, and just last week released their first single from the record, Let Me Breathe. As the group continues their current tour, they will headline venues such as London's O2 Forum Kentish Town for 2,300 music lovers as well as an epic show at Manchester's O2 Victoria Warehouse.\n\nSince they formed in 2016, the group have gone on to rack up over 110,000,000 Spotify streams as well as being played on the likes of BBC Radio 1, 6 Music, and Radio X - while also boasting thousands of followers on social media. Their first release in 2017, It Was All So Monotonous caught the attention of rock and indie lovers with tracks such as Slice Of Lime catapulting them to stardom before performing at the likes of Tramlines Festival as well as In It Together.\n\nTickets for their headline show at Clifton Park on July 6, 2024, will be available to buy on Friday, October 6, at 10am, here."
