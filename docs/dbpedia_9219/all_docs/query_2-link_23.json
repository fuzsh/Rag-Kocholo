        "text": "Kesha is back.\n\nSorry, let me be more clear: Ke$ha is back.\n\nThe dance-pop singer has returned with her new single “Joyride,” officially kicking off a new chapter of her career. The tune is her first since being released from her contract with Dr. Luke, the man who helped propel her to super-stardom, but who Kesha also accused of sexual assault.\n\n“Joyride” is an anthemic EDM track that can only be described as a banger. It begins with an odd accordion loop, which almost makes it seem like Kesha is leaning into polka. Don’t worry, that’s not the case, and her use of the instrument on the poppy cut somehow works brilliantly."
