Maj. John Canley in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Va., Aug. 25, 2022.

Canley was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2018 for his actions in 1968 during the Battle of Hue City, Vietnam. While serving as the company gunnery sergeant, Company A, 1st Battalion, 1st Marine, 1st Marine Division, Canley and his marines fought off multiple attacks as they attempted to relieve another company of marines. Despite being wounded in these engagements, Canley repeatedly rushed across dangerous terrain, braving enemy fire to rescue wounded marines, carrying them to safety. He took command of his company after enemy fire wounded his company commander and, for three days he led the unit against fierce enemy resistance.

Because of his undaunted courage, selfless sacrifice and unwavering devotion to duty, Sgt. Maj. Canley was awarded the Medal of Honor.
