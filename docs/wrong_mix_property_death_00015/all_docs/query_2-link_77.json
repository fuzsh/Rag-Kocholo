When their courtship floundered, she married John Rogers in 1725, only to separate from him within a year. Rogers left Philadelphia, and Franklin returned in 1727. By law Read was blocked from marriage by strict divorce laws, so Read and Franklin publically established a common law marriage which lasted until her death in 1774.
