The conversation was led by Dr. Carla Easter, the Assistant Director for Education, Outreach, and Visitor Experience at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and the panel consisted of Dr. Darryl N. Williams, Senior Vice President of Science and Education at The Franklin Institute; Michael Madeja, Head of Education Programs at the American Philosophical Society Library & Museum; and Sonia Aronson, Climate Resilience Researcher at ICF.\n\nA compilation of PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs coverage about citizen science, and a panel discussion about how Benjamin Franklin, Citizen Science and STEM storytelling are all connected.
