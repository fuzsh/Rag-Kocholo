        "text": "Deborah (Read) Franklin (about 1708 – December 19, 1774) was the spouse of Benjamin Franklin, a prominent inventor, printer, thinker, revolutionary and Founding Father of the United States. He signed the Declaration of Independence and was also one of the 39 signers of the US Constitution.\n\nShe was the daughter of John Reed (Read) and Sarah White.\n\nFamily\n\nMarriage to Benjamin Franklin\n\nTheir marriage would have been legal, except that Deborah was already married to John Rodgers, who had fled to Barbados to avoid his debts, never to return.\n\nWhen Franklin returned from a trip to England, he and Deborah began a common-law marriage in 1730.\n\nThey had two children together:\n\nFrancis Folger Franklin[1] (October 20, 1732 - November 21, 1736), who died of smallpox at age four, and\n\nSarah Franklin Bache, called Sally.\n\nTogether they also raised William Franklin, Franklin's illegitimate son and future Colonial Governor of New Jersey.\n\nFind A Grave Memorial# 9405519; http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=9405519\n\nDeborah Read Franklin\n\nBirth: 1708 Marlborough, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, USA\n\nDeath: Dec. 19, 1774 Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nWife of Statesman, Benjamin Franklin,\n\nMother of Sarah(Sally) Bache, Francis Folger (died at age 4-smallpox).\n\nBen and Debbie where married on Sept.1,1730.\n\nWhile Ben was abroad, Deborah kept the business going, collected on loans, and other issues.\n\nBen was on government business in London when Deborah died of a stroke.\n\nCause of death: Stroke\n\nFamily links:\n\nSpouse: Benjamin Franklin (1706 - 1790)\n\nChildren:\n\nWilliam Franklin (1731 - 1813)*\n\nFrancis Folger Franklin (1732 - 1736)*\n\nSarah Franklin Bache (1743 - 1808)*\n\nBurial: Christ Church Burial Ground Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, USA, Plot: Section A, With husband Benjamin\n\nCreated by: Frank W Nichols, Record added: Sep 03, 2004\n\n******************************\n\nDeborah's first husband, John Rogers, deserted her in 1725.\n\nIn 1727, she heard of Rogers' death and began dating her former sweetheart, Ben Franklin.\n\nFranklin had proposed to her when she was just 15, but her mother would not allow it.\n\nShe married Ben Franklin in 1730 (1 SEP 1728/9? ).\n\nThey had two children together, Francis Folger Franklin, and Sarah Franklin Bache.\n\nThey also raised William Franklin together, Franklin's illegitimate son.\n\nShe operated a general store out of the front of Ben's print shop.\n\nHer fear of ocean voyages prevented her from traveling with Ben, so she spent many years alone in Philadelphia while Ben was in Europe.\n\nIn 1774, while Ben was on an extended trip to England, she died unexpectedly of a stroke.\n\nSource: Updated from WikiTree Genealogy by SmartCopy: Mar 30 2015, 1:06:38 UTC\n\n******************************\n\nDeborah's Mother objected to her marrying Ben Franklin who was only 17 years old and penniless.\n\nWhen Ben went away to england, Deborah was wooed by a Mr. Rogers who received Deb's parents permission to marry her.\n\nThen it was learned that Rogers had a wife in England.\n\nHe escaped to the West Indies and died in 1728, two years before Deb married Ben Franklin.\n\n****************************** http://marriage.about.com/od/historical/a/benfranklin.htm\n\n* Benjamin and Deborah first met in 1723 when Ben moved into her parents' boarding house.\n\nTheir wedding was on September 1, 1730.\n\nBecause of the uncertainty of Deborah's marital status, they had a common-law marriage.\n\nBenjamin: \"Our mutual affection was revived, but there were now great objections to our union. The match was indeed looked upon an invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in englad; but this could not be easily proved, because of the distance; and though there was a report of his death it was not certain. Then, though it should be true, he had left many debts, which his successor might be called upon to pay. We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took her to wife September 1st, 1730.\"\n\nSource: Carl Van Doren. Benjamin Franklin. 1938. page 37.\n\nDuring their 44-year marriage, Deborah and Benjamin Franklin were apart for eighteen years.\n\nThroughout their marriage, Deborah remained loyal to Benjamin even though he apparently was unfaithful with \"low women.\"\n\nJ.A. Leo Lemay on whether or not Benjamin was a notorious womanizer:\n\n\"False. Although Franklin was an inveterate flirt, and he sired an illegitimate child before his 1730 wedding to Deborah Reed Rogers, there is no evidence that he had any affairs during his marriage.\"\n\nSource: Kathy Canavan.
