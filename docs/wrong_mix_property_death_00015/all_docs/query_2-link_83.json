Most Americans know the name Ben Franklin and know he is a founding father of a great nation. What they may not know is Franklin as a man with a wry sense of humor, an intellect that was hid behind his cultivated image of commonality and humbleness as a middle-class member and his pursuit of “industry and frugality.” He had an endless urge to learn, experiment and fight injustices. He was a free spirit in every sense of the word. Something Jack Ma would probably relate to in his book Alibaba.\n\nIn reading through the first few decades of his life, it becomes clear that Benjamin Franklin was not born to lead, per se. It was his endless quest for knowledge that molded the man in preparation for what was to come. For example, his adoption as a young man of the Socrates method of argument through gentle questioning evokes images of the older man who would later participate in the discourse that led to the forming of a new nation. Similar to Home Depot Co-Founder Ken Langone’s urge to learn and work hard, as he discusses in his book I Love Capitalism!\n\nBenjamin Franklin was a prolific writer over the years, and he had no issue with abandoning and then reshaping personal ideas and philosophies after reading a variety of books on religion, politics and industry.\n\nReading the Franklin life story as written by Isaacson produces some fascinating revelations about the man. Franklin was a picture of contrasts. He had a remarkable knack for coming across as just an ordinary person. However, he had an enormous ego, could be manipulative (think: Socratic method of controlling discourse) and neglected his wife and son. Another book about a great business mind in Ready Fire Aim about building big businesses that run on their own.\n\nOn the other hand, he was an inventor, a visionary thinker and a passionate defender of justice. It is not generally known, but Benjamin Franklin wanted to abolish slavery, putting forth a petition in 1790 which is the year he died. After retiring in his early forties, he spent the next 40 years as a diplomat, scientist and statesman.\n\nWant to buy a book review like this?\n\nClick here to learn how to get your book reviewed!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nIsaacson did well by providing so much detail about Benjamin Franklin’s early years. Once you understand Franklin’s love of writing, learning, conversing and inventing, it is easy to see how Franklin became one of the leading figures during the effort to create the United States. Everything he learned the first 40 years of his life was applied in the last 40 plus years. Scott Belsky is similar in all these ways. He founded Behance which sold to Adobe and tells his amazing story in The Messy Middle.\n\nHe was the only person who contributed to all the founding documents of the new country, from the treaty of alliance with France to the Constitution of the United States of America. He became the archetype for the American – free spirited, unwilling to be dominated, rejecting of royalty and trusting of the middle class. In the working class, Franklin saw a hearty spirit, positive values, strong work ethic and a sense that these are the people who can build a great country. This support, belief and encouragement is a major part of leadership discussed in the book Leading. It is also to Isaacson’s credit that he can convey the humanness of Benjamin Franklin in his relationships with people, including his family.\n\nThe problem with icons is that they are often reduced to images of near perfection, making it easy to forget they loved, learned, made mistakes, struggled and experienced failures and successes. Though the author’s explanations devolve every now and then into justifications of the times Franklin acted poorly, he quickly recovers and gets back on track with the facts.\n\nMany myths are dispelled in this book – historical myths and myths about Franklin. The book also turns an American icon into a human being with faults, brilliance, humor, emotions and a remarkable self-awareness that gives readers clear insights into his motivations and decisions. There is a lot of detail in this book, and the details are supported with a plethora of extensive footnotes, supporting sources and full chronology. Mr. Franklin is an outlier and to learn more about what that means and what is means to the word success, read the book Outliers.\n\nAbove all, this is a story that has clear relevance in today’s setting. Benjamin Franklin knew it would be difficult to maintain a Republic. He was truly a visionary who understood the enormous advantages and perils the country would face. What may surprise and please him is that over 245 years later, the great experiment of the United States of America continues to thrive.
