        "text": "19 March of the year 1778: the monarchy to the rescue of a republic\n\nWe have come such a long way since, in September 1776, Mr. Deane asked us in the name of an American ‘Congress’ to negotiate a purchase of weapons and uniforms! Who would have been able to imagine that the autodidact physician and printer who accompanied him would become the center of attention of all of Versailles, and sign a treaty of allegiance between a group in rebellion against its King and one of the oldest monarchies in Europe?\n\nWhat a character this Benjamin Franklin is! For it is of course about him I write. He was already well known among scientists in Versailles and Paris for his invention of the lightning conductor, and this talented autodidact was able, upon his arrival, to renew acquaintances he made during his first visit to Versailles during the reign of Louis XV.\n\nAt the head of his delegation, he finds in the fertile spirit of our age the support that he was hoping for. And we are seeing a veritable bout of Franklinomania arise: women wear ‘lightning dresses’ in homage to his invention of the lightning conductor. I have lost count of the number of young lieutenants who dream of setting off for the New World in the footsteps of the marquis de La Fayette, who people say needed only one dinner to be persuaded to leave to fight alongside the insurgents.\n\nThe Court’s enthusiasm for the representatives of a people rising up against their monarch caused some reticence from our King, who is taking the affair very seriously indeed. That was why we met many times in his appartments to discuss this pressing matter.\n\nWhile we were secretly meeting the envoys from the Congress, he spent many hours studying the question with reports, letters and other books from his library. While we were negotiating in secret, Louis XVI composed a truly beautiful letter to the King of Spain asking him not to leave France alone to make this decision that was so heavy with consequences: open war against the world’s most powerful navy.\n\nIt was the news of victory at Saratoga, which reached us shortly before the arrival of the American delegation, that swept away our King’s remaining doubts.\n\nOur monarch has decided to negotiate a trade agreement with the delegation and to receive it as an official ambassador in order to hand the Americans the treaties personally…\n\nThis audience will take place tomorrow!\n\n22 March of the year 1778: we have witnessed a nation’s birth\n\nI must tell a story of that visit that we made with what has since become an official delegation. It was on the morning of 20 March that we found ourselves together: Croÿ, myself and the ambassadors led by the famous Franklin. From afar, I had already glimpsed his silhouette, then, as they approached, his features. Benjamin Franklin has the face of a great man. Wearing a hat on his white, unpowdered hair, he presented himself in the middle of our Court’s splendour dressed as an American farmer. His brown woollen cloth waistcoat stood out from the embroideries and perfumes of the small crowd that was already building up around him, attracted by the originality of the scene. Everyone was struck by disbelief to see this simple and peaceful man headed straight towards his destiny in the sumptuous scene of flannel and precious stones that is the fashion of our Court.\n\nWe entered the chamber of our King, to whom I presented the three visitors in turn. His Majesty then pronounced a sentence that History has recorded:\n\n« I would like you to assure the Congress of my friendship. I hope that this will be for the good of our two nations. »\n\nTo my ears, these words resounded like cannon fire in the calm morning air. If the treaties were already signed and war with England was unavoidable, there is a gulf between seizing a trading or military opportunity and giving birth to an independent democracy on the other side of the ocean.\n\nThrough these words our King crossed the Atlantic like Caesar crossed the Rubicon, bringing France into the fate of the American adventure. In the simplicity of that phrase, we had just witnessed, greatly moved, a nation’s birth.\n\nWe were therefore still stunned when we heard resonate, like an echo, Mr Franklin’s response – sobre, measured and sincere: “Your Majesty can count on the gratefulness of Congress and on its faithfulness in the engagements that it is undertaking.”\n\nWhile I was presenting the people who were in attendance, I thought I saw Mr Lee and Mr Deane appear a little disappointed by soberness of the protocol. A crueler pen would written that, with their powder and their outfits ‘à la française’ they were hoping for the splendor of the time when ambassadors who travelled across the oceans were welcomed in gold and silver.\n\nMedal of the Order of Military Merit awarded to Scottish sailor John Paul Jones, who was presented to Louis XVI by Benjamin Franklin.\n\n© Paris - Musée de l'Armée, Dist. RMN-Grand Palais / image musée de l'Armée\n\nAs for Benjamin Frankin, he seemed to hear the wheels of history turn in the calm of the King’s words. His face without makeup, which normally had the air of a statue of a classical philosopher, was glowing, as if rejuvenated by the importance of the moment. It is in that face that I understood the promise of this new America that we had seen be born in this first day of spring. An America that, like him, believes in the power of reason and work, a nation of cultivated and simple autodidacts that gives things value based only on their use or the value that they bring. A nation that was marching into the century, free and conquering, under the protective wing of one of the oldest monarchies of the continent!\n\nOther visitors’ tales"
