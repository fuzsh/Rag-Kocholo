        "text": "| The American Revolution Story : Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Marquis de Lafayette |\n\nAs a cornerstone in world history, the American Revolution stands for the birth of a new nation and challenging the established norms of monarchy and colonial rule. At the heart of this revolutionary saga are the remarkable individuals who shaped its course, among them, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Marquis de Lafayette.

His insatiable curiosity and passion for knowledge fueled his diverse interests, ranging from science and literature to diplomacy and politics.\n\nIn addition to his activities as a printer and politician, Benjamin Franklin is also known for his scientific research work, particularly in the field of electricity. We owe him common terms like battery, negative, load, condenser… He is also the inventor of the lightning rod.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s Contributions to the American Revolution\n\nFranklin served from 1776 to 1778 on a commission to France charged with the critical task of gaining French support for American independence.

He thus became the only “founding father of America” to sign the three founding documents of the United States: the Treaty of Paris (1783) and the American Constitution (1787), the Declaration of Independence. The Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. It was engrossed on parchment and on August 2, 1776, delegates began signing it.\n\nThomas Jefferson was appointed to develop a Declaration of Independence first draft. He was the main author of the text on June 21, 1776 and submitted it to the committee which made some modifications. The committee of 5 representatives consisted of John Adams, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Livingston and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nWashington and Lafayette at Mount Vernon, 1784 by Rossiter and Mignot, 1859 – Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nGeorge Washington (1732-1799) : The Commander-in-Chief\n\nBackground and Rise to Leadership\n\nGeorge Washington, revered as the “Father of His Country,” emerged as a beacon of leadership during the turbulent years of the Revolution.

Its legacy reminds us of the enduring value of freedom and democracy and the sacrifices required to uphold these principles.\n\nThe American Revolution Story: Benjamin Franklin, Washington, and Lafayette\n\nBenjamin Franklin is undoubtedly one of the most illustrious and influential figures in American history.

Through the leadership of visionaries like Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Marquis de Lafayette, the American people rose to challenge the mightiest empire of their time and emerged victorious, for a nation founded on principles of freedom and equality.\n\nBenjamin Franklin in Paris\n\nLiving in the Suburb of Paris\n\nThe Hôtel de Valentinois (at that time the property of Monsieur de Chaumont) in Passy was the home of Benjamin Franklin during the 9 years that he lived in France during the American Revolutionary War, when he represented American interests and sought French support for American independence.\n\nRue Raynouard and rue Singer angle – Hotel de Valentinois\n\nOn this site stood a vast property in the 18th century including an elegant private mansion, the Hôtel de Valentinois, located in a park of approximately four hectares. This is where Benjamin Franklin, who was special representative and then the first Ambassador in the history of the United States to France, lived from 1777 to 1785.\n\nBenjamin Franklin left Philadelphia for France on October 26, 1776\n\nBenjamin Franklin, aged 71 with his 2 grandsons, William Temple Franklin and Benjamin Franklin Bache, left Philadelphia for France on October 26, 1776, 3 months after the Declaration of Independence of the States (July 4, 1776). Franklin was mandated by the Continental Congress to obtain the financial, logistical and diplomatic support of King Louis XVI for the War of Independence against the crown of England.\n\nOn December 4, 1776, his ship docked in the small port of Saint-Goustan, in Auray, in Brittany. On December 21, 1776, he was in Paris. He first stayed at the Hôtel d’Entragues, 2, rue de l’Université, until January 8, 1777, then at the Hôtel de Hamburg, 52, rue Jacob, until the end of February.\n\nFranklin was then invited by the Frenchman Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont, shipowner and merchant, one of the richest and most powerful aristocrats in the kingdom. He was also a supporter of the cause of the American Insurgents, to stay free of charge at his residence in Passy.\n\nThe village of Passy was then a destination sought after by foreign diplomats, slightly outside Paris on the road to Versailles. Benjamin Franklin therefore settled in the small pavilion of the Hôtel de Valentinois, with his two grandsons who assisted him in his secretariat. He installed a printing press in another building, allowing him to have his own printing press.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s visitors in Paris\n\nBenjamin Franklin received many visitors in Passy: Turgot, Buffon, d’Alembert, Condorcet, Malesherbes, La Rochefoucauld, Mirabeau, and Beaumarchais, responsible for conveying financial aid to the American Insurgents. It was also in Passy that Franklin met the young Marquis de La Fayette, before his departure for America.\n\nHowever, the greatest success of Benjamin Franklin’s diplomatic work was the signing, on February 6, 1778, at the Hôtel de Coislin, of the Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Alliance between France and the United States.\n\nWhen Benjamin Franklin left Paris, in July 1785 to return to the United States, he received as a gift the portrait of the King of France Louis XVI in a frame studded with 408 diamonds.\n\nEmy,\n\nParis Trip Planner\n\nFAQs Benjamin Franklin, Washington, and Lafayette\n\nHow did Benjamin Franklin contribute to the American Revolution?\n\nBenjamin Franklin played a crucial role in securing support from France, negotiating key alliances and securing vital aid for the American cause.\n\nWhat was George Washington’s significance in the Revolution?\n\nGeorge Washington’s leadership as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army was instrumental in rallying the American forces and securing pivotal victories.\n\nWhy was Marquis de Lafayette important to the Revolution?\n\nMarquis de Lafayette’s military expertise and unwavering dedication bolstered the American forces.
