        "text": "Benjamin Franklin, the Printer\n\n\"Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\"\n\nIn October, 1723 Philadelphia was one of the largest cities in the American colonies. Upon his arrival, Ben continued to work as a printer and made many friends in the trade. One of his friends, Sir William Keith, governor of Pennsylvania, convinced him to move to London to buy printing equipment. In London, he would then be able to purchase the equipment needed to begin his own business. Within a year, at the age of eighteen, Franklin had arrived in London and was ready to begin work at Palmer's and then Watt's, two of the most prestigous printing firms in the city.\n\nIn October, 1726 Ben returned to Philadelphia . He continued his trade as a printer, first working with a partner then, at the age of twenty-four, taking the business over on his own.\n\nIn 1729, Franklin bought the Pennsylvania Gazette, an ailing paper known to be dull and poorly managed. Known for his hard work and determination, Ben used his wit and intelligence to turn the gazette into an informative and entertaining paper. Ben's philosophy for success, work harder than your competition, drove the success of the paper as it gained recognition throughout the colonies.\n\nIn 1730, Ben entered into a commonlaw marriage with his longtime friend Deborah Read Rogers, whose husband John had left her in 1725."
