It opened to the public for the first time in 2006 as a dynamic museum and educational facility. Though originally built as a lodging house where Franklin lived from 1757 to 1775, the building was used as a hotel and a base for several non-profit groups during the twentieth century. In the late 1990s the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House were granted the freehold by the British government. The building was in a state of disrepair and was restored by the Board, management team and various organisations and volunteers. The House brings Franklin’s time in London to life through an immersive historical experience, architectural tours and events, as well as offering a free education programme for children.\n\nHistorical Designation\n\nCity Landmark\n\nFunding\n\nThe property is funded by entrance fees as well as donations from prominent sponsors. These include the Heritage Lottery Fund, Robert H Smith Family Foundation, Bloomberg LP and the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nPhysical Condition\n\nPreserve\n\nTourism\n\nOpen to Public: Yes\n\nFamily Friendly: Yes\n\nHours of Operation: 10:30 - 17:00, Monday and Wednesday - Sunday\n\nAdmission Fees: Varies depending on tour\n\nLodging: No\n\nPromotional Materials Available\n\nBrochures: No\n\nCatalogues: No\n\nDVDs: Yes; YouTube Link\n\nCalendar Events: Website Link"
