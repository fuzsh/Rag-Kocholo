        "text": "Answer: Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson\n\nElizabeth Graeme Fergusson’s life was one of heartbreak and intrigue. Born in Philadelphia in 1737, Elizabeth was the daughter of prominent physician Dr. Thomas Graeme and Anne Diggs. She lived with her family at their estate, Graeme Park, located in Horsham, Pennsylvania. In the 1750s, Elizabeth made her societal debut, and she became engaged to William Franklin, Benjamin Franklin’s son. Benjamin Franklin and Graeme’s father were business acquaintances until political differences formed a rift between the two men. Neither wanted their children associated with one another. In the late 1750s, William decided to accompany his father on a trip to England, and when he returned, it was with another woman as his wife.\n\nAfterward, Elizabeth’s parents recommended that she visit England, where she met with members of the Penn family, King George III, and other notable figures of the time. But during her stay overseas, in 1765, Elizabeth received word that both her mother and sister had died. She returned to the Philadelphia area shortly thereafter. Back at Graeme Park, Elizabeth invited the city’s cultural and social leaders to discussion gatherings she called “Attic Evenings.” It was at one of these meetings in 1771 that she met Scottish immigrant and British sympathizer Henry Fergusson. Although her father did not approve, the couple married in 1772. That same year, Elizabeth’s father died, and the newly married couple inherited Graeme Park.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Henry asked Elizabeth to ferry letters between British and American military personnel. Henry was later labeled a traitor and Graeme Park was confiscated. It took Elizabeth three years to regain control of the property. She lived at Graeme Park for the remainder of her life with good friend Eliza Stedman, and she continued her work as a published poet and writer. Due to her ill health, Elizabeth sold Graeme Park in the 1790s. She died in Horsham in 1801.\n\nSome of Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson's writing are available at HSP (Am .067), and the Library Company of Philadelphia's collection of her works can be accessed here as well.\n\nImage: Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson, engraving (undated)\n\nMany thanks for sharing this colorful story. I wish I had known it, some years back when I hosted the London Carpenter Company at Graham Park, as William Penn,\n\nOn behalf of the Hatboro Horsham Historical Society. Her prospects would have seemed so much better, as the wife of New Jersey's last Royal Governor, but her\n\nEarly marital disappointment in not becoming Mrs Franklin, was a blessing in disguise. William Franklin, who I have portrayed in New Jersey, was sent off to prison in Connecticut during the American Revolution and his wife was left destitute\n\nIn Burlington, NJ, where she died from sickness caused in large part to her abandoned state. Tory friends provided her with burial and a handsome memorial stone at New York City's Trinity Church, near Wall Street. Shortly after the war,\n\nWilliam Franklin sailed back to London, England, where he had attended law school. He and his father, Benjamin, remained estranged? William would never return to his birthplace of Pennsylvania. Dear Elizabeth Graham was saved from a terrible fate.\n\nI look forward to reading her poems at HSP. They may have some interesting insights to be discovered."
