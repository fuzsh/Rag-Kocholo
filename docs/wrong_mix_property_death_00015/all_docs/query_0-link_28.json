September 9: King George III commissioned William Franklin the royal Governor of New Jersey November 1: Franklin returned to Philadelphia\n\nOctober 1: Franklin was defeated in his campaign for a seat in the Pennsylvania Assembly. The election campaign was notable for vicious attacks on Franklin's character (it was alleged that he favored royal government because he coveted governorship; that he had drawn large income from public monies while Assembly agent in England; that he had been careless with public funds given to his supervision; that William's mother was his maidservant Barbara, and that he had buried her in an unmarked grave). November 1: Franklin left Philadelphia for London, as the agent of the Pennsylvania Assembly\n\nFebruary 27: Stamp Act passed in House of Commons September 16-17: Franklin’s house threatened by Stamp Act protestors. Deborah refused to flee, and the mob was dissuaded by 8oo Franklin supporters ready to combat them.\n\nJanuary 17: Franklin turned 60\n\nOctober 29: Franklin’s daughter Sarah married to Richard Bache, Philadelphia merchant.\n\nJuly 20: In a letter to Polly Stevenson, Franklin used and explained his new phonetic alphabet. Fall: Franklin had maps printed showing the course of the Gulf Stream.\n\nJanuary 2: American Philosophical Society elected Franklin its President (and reelected him every year until his death.) Winter: Deborah Franklin suffered a stroke, which impaired her memory and understanding; her health deteriorated thereafter. August 12: Franklin’s grandson, Sally’s son, Benjamin Franklin Bache born."
