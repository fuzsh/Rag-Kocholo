Marriage to Benjamin Franklin

Their marriage would have been legal, except that Deborah was already married to John Rodgers, who had fled to Barbados to avoid his debts, never to return.

When Franklin returned from a trip to England, he and Deborah began a common-law marriage in 1730.

They had two children together:

Francis Folger Franklin[1] (October 20, 1732 - November 21, 1736), who died of smallpox at age four, and

Sarah Franklin Bache, called Sally.

Together they also raised William Franklin, Franklin's illegitimate son and future Colonial Governor of New Jersey.

******************************

Deborah's first husband, John Rogers, deserted her in 1725.

In 1727, she heard of Rogers' death and began dating her former sweetheart, Ben Franklin.

Franklin had proposed to her when she was just 15, but her mother would not allow it.

She married Ben Franklin in 1730 (1 SEP 1728/9? ).

They had two children together, Francis Folger Franklin, and Sarah Franklin Bache.

They also raised William Franklin together, Franklin's illegitimate son.

She operated a general store out of the front of Ben's print shop.

Her fear of ocean voyages prevented her from traveling with Ben, so she spent many years alone in Philadelphia while Ben was in Europe.

In 1774, while Ben was on an extended trip to England, she died unexpectedly of a stroke.

******************************

Deborah's Mother objected to her marrying Ben Franklin who was only 17 years old and penniless.

When Ben went away to england, Deborah was wooed by a Mr. Rogers who received Deb's parents permission to marry her.

Then it was learned that Rogers had a wife in England.

He escaped to the West Indies and died in 1728, two years before Deb married Ben Franklin.

* Benjamin and Deborah first met in 1723 when Ben moved into her parents' boarding house.

Their wedding was on September 1, 1730.

Because of the uncertainty of Deborah's marital status, they had a common-law marriage.

Benjamin: "Our mutual affection was revived, but there were now great objections to our union. The match was indeed looked upon an invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in englad; but this could not be easily proved, because of the distance; and though there was a report of his death it was not certain. Then, though it should be true, he had left many debts, which his successor might be called upon to pay. We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took her to wife September 1st, 1730."

During their 44-year marriage, Deborah and Benjamin Franklin were apart for eighteen years.

Throughout their marriage, Deborah remained loyal to Benjamin even though he apparently was unfaithful with "low women."

J.A. Leo Lemay on whether or not Benjamin was a notorious womanizer:

"False. Although Franklin was an inveterate flirt, and he sired an illegitimate child before his 1730 wedding to Deborah Reed Rogers, there is no evidence that he had any affairs during his marriage."
