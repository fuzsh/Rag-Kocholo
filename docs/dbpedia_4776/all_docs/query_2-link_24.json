        "text": "In the world of British poetry, Carol Ann Duffy is a superstar. Highbrow and lowbrow, readers love her: from critics such as Sean O'Brien, who calls her \"the representative poet of her day\", to students who study Mean Time, her majestic 1993 collection, as an A-level set text. Her poems are accessible and entertaining, yet her form is classical, her technique razor-sharp. She is read by people who don't really read poetry, yet she maintains the respect of her peers. Reviewers praise her touching, sensitive, witty evocations of love, loss, dislocation, nostalgia; fans talk of greeting her at readings \"with claps and cheers that would not sound out of place at a pop concert\". Here it is: she is easy, and she is good.\n\nBut her superstar status was noticed by the rest of the world only when the government decided not to make Duffy poet laureate after the death of Ted Hughes earlier this year - because, as a Downing Street official told a reporter, \"Blair is worried about having a homosexual as poet laureate because of how it might play in middle England.\" Thus, Duffy became a caricature - the lesbian single-parent, with a black partner, from a Scottish working-class background - rejected in favour of Andrew Motion - similarly caricatured as a public-school, Oxford-educated, married, white male toff. The media set up an opposition between the Oxbridge-style poets who have the power: Motion, James Fenton, Craig Raine; and the \"postmodern provincials\" who'd been rejected yet again: Duffy, Don Paterson, Liz Lochhead, Simon Armitage. The decision was labelled \"a disgrace\", \"an insult to the country's intelligence\" and, infamously,\n\n\"a bag o'shite\". Suddenly, Duffy was headline news, doorstepped by journalists obsessed with her sexuality, misquoted, a celebrity.\n\nBut first, the present. Duffy is now under the spotlight for far more appropriate reasons: a new collection, her first for six years, is tipped to win her the Forward prize, one of poetry's biggest, for an unprecedented second time. The World's Wife is a joyous, exuberant book of poems about women usually excluded from myth and history: wives, such as Mrs Pilate, Mrs Aesop, Mrs Darwin, Mrs Faust, Frau Freud, Mrs Quasimodo; women usually defined by their men - Delilah, Anne Hathaway, Eurydice; and re-tellings of old stories in which the lead changes sex - Queen Kong, the Kray Sisters and Elvis's twin sister, the nun.\n\nIt is a collection full of wit (Mrs Aesop is bored to tears by her husband's attempts\n\nto make a fable out of every incident; Elvis's sister says, \"They call me/Sister Presley here./The Reverend Mother/digs the way\n\nI move my hips/just like my brother\"). But, as one poet says of Duffy, \"she is able to combine the comic and the serious in the same poem\".\n\nSo The Devil's Wife, about Myra Hindley, makes the point, \"The Devil was evil, mad, but I was the Devil's wife/which made me worse\". In Mrs Faust, the couple are seduced first by his 'n' hers bathrobes, then money, politics and corruption; finally, Faust becomes an arms dealer. (\"I grew to love the lifestyle,/not the life./He grew to love the kudos,/not the wife,\" says Mrs Faust.) Frau Freud declares that, contrary to her husband's theories, she is really not envious of the penis; while the Kray Sisters are ÂŸber-feminist vigilantes who patrol London's East End demanding respect.\n\nWhen we meet, Duffy wears a linen trouser suit and enjoys the walk up a urine-soaked alleyway from the tube station to the restaurant: \"This is great! I love alleyways. I haven't been in an alleyway like this for a long time.\"\n\nThe World's Wife is her most overtly feminist work, and I ask if it was her primary intention to give voice to women denied a say in the past. \"I think the poems are looking for the missing truth, rather than accepting the way we've been taught. If you look at King Kong, which is one of my favourite movies, it's not necessarily the way a woman would go about things. I thought that if a woman gorilla had fallen in love with a man, she'd have been much more subtle about it.\n\n\"So it's looking for missing or hidden or unspoken truths in old stories. It wouldn't have worked if you'd just gone through a list of favourite tales and revised them. You had to find something hard and truthful in the story. That's why it took so long to write. Each poem had to be personally honest, and have some kind of autobiographical element in it, whether it had happened to me or whether\n\nit was an emotional or intellectual truth.\"\n\nAs in the past, there is much that is personal in the new collection, although not to the extent of Mean Time. But, she says, emotional confessions do not make her feel vulnerable. \"I don't think you do feel exposed in poetry, because it's a made thing. It's a crafted piece of writing, rather than a diary extract or letter. All the work that goes into a poem pushes it away from your own vulnerable moment. I feel quite hard-hearted towards a poem when I've finished it.\"\n\nHer work has never been such rollicking, sexy good fun, though, has it? \"It's meant to be funny, but there's also the darker side of love - like Mrs Quasimodo [whose love affair with the hunchback turns nasty when he abuses the way she looks]. I tried to use both strands.\" Certainly, she enjoys what she describes as the \"sexiness\" of poetry. \"It's quite a glamorous, show-offy form of writing. You choose the best words and you can cover quite a lot of distance. And writing itself has an erotic quality. It's an eroticism of the mind. There's a surge of pleasure when you're writing a poem that's akin to physical eroticism.\"\n\nDuffy's partner is Jackie Kay, who won last year's Guardian Fiction Prize for her novel, Trumpet. They live in Manchester with Ella, Duffy's four-year-old daughter, and Kay's\n\n11-year-old son. According to another poet, \"they have the most stable relationship in poetry\". When told this, Duffy seems rather taken aback. \"Who said that? Really? That is nice.\" How long have they been together? \"What time is it now?\" she laughs, looking at her watch. \"Um, you mean from when I've been with her, sort of thing?\" Yes. \"About eight years. We're very happy. I love her dearly.\" How did Kay feel about the press revelations that Duffy was gay? \"She was very supportive.\"\n\nHer personal life has not always been so straightforward, as anyone who has read Mean Time would testify. (A powerful and desperate account of a \"dramatically bad\" break-up with a boyfriend, it was once described by a friend as \"the sort of book you'd read instead of listening to a Leonard Cohen record\".) She was still at school when she started going out with the Liverpool poet Adrian Henri, 23 years her senior. (Mean Time is not about him.) \"Don't worry, I'm not terrified of being in-ed!\" she says. \"Yes, I did go out with him, and yes, he was a little older than me. I met him at a poetry reading when I was 16. I went to university in Liverpool to be with him. I love him dearly. I saw him only yesterday.\" That's quite an age difference.\n\n\"I think it's because I went to a convent. It makes you wild. I'm joking, of course. I was never really wild.\" So, is her relationship with Kay her first gay relationship? \"No, I had a dress rehearsal.\" Just one? \"One. Yes.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the announcement of\n\nthe poet laureateship, and prompted by the\n\nhow-will-it-play-in-middle-England comment from Number 10, the press focused on the question of sexuality, as if it were a barrier to holding official posts. \"My view is that anyone who has a problem with people being in gay relationships has a problem,\" says Duffy.\n\n\"I think gay, straight, whatever, relationships are just a banal fact of life. They're just straight facts. I was very surprised: it made me see that the country I thought I lived in wasn't the one I lived in. It was appalling that sexuality could be written about in that kind of way. I think that gay people should be proud and relaxed and celebratory of their lives, in the same way that straight people are. There is no issue. When two young women from the Daily Mail walked into my garden, I told them they should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nBut what about the laureateship itself? \"The ridiculous thing about it is that the press whipped up this nasty sort of race between a few poets, and no doubt caused a lot of hurt to people, whereas in my experience the poetry community is very supportive. It's made me very cautious of the press.\"\n\nDoesn't she think it a shame that the government missed out on such an easy and symbolic way of defining a new, inclusive, meritocratic Britain? There has never been a woman laureate, for a start (Christina Rossetti should have got it in 1892 after Tennyson died but, rather than appoint the foremost poet of the day, the post was left vacant for two years until Rossetti herself was dead). \"My view of the laureateship is that I didn't want to do the thing,\" says Duffy. \"But when all these stories started appearing, I got scores of letters from women saying do it, do it, do it. But I was never really sure. I never really came out and said whether I wanted it or not.\" (At the time, she was quoted as saying that we needed a \"much more democratic\" laureateship, more people's poet than monarch's bard, and said, \"I will not write a poem for Edward and Sophie. No self-respecting poet should have to.\")\n\nAnyway, she says, she took out a bet on others getting the gong. \"I put Â£200 on Ursula Fanthorpe at 33-1, and a side bet on Simon Armitage. I could have won Â£6,000. I've still got the slip. I keep meaning to get it photocopied and framed for each of them.\" What does she think of Andrew Motion? \"I like him, I've known him for years,\" she says. \"I like his poems very much.\"\n\nMotion returns the compliment with fervour: \"Carol Ann Duffy is a very, very bright, appealing, clever, ingenious, approachable and generally heartwarming writer. She's a Good Thing, capital G, capital T, one of the poets I most enjoy reading, and I felt that there was a completely false antithesis created in the press about what we would both do with the laureateship.\" Duffy's egalitarian approach to poetry, he says, has guided him in his first few months in the post. \"I admire everything she's done within and for poetry; the work she's done in schools is particularly fine, heroinic. The way she takes poetry into places where it doesn't normally go has been inspirational to me in what I'm trying to\n\ndo as laureate.\" The poem she wrote for last week's TUC conference in Brighton was, he says, \"a dramatic example\" of this.\n\nAll the fuss around the laureateship highlighted the alleged elitism of poetry; how, even at a time when Hughes's Birthday Letters can top the bestseller lists, poems are still the province of the few. \"I don't agree,\" says Duffy. \"Poetry now is much more part of the fabric of people's lives than it was, say, 30 years ago. There weren't any women poets around then. The best thing that made poetry less Oxbridge, I think, was the Liverpool poets. They had quite a lot of hostility and snobbery to deal with from the Oxbridge mafia, who fortunately now don't have as much power. As a teenager, I went to poetry readings like pop concerts: I heard Norma MacCaig, Peter Porter, Adrian Mitchell, when I was 15, 16. It was wonderful. That all these poets should be alive and talking in the language I thought in.\"\n\nDuffy thus discovered poetry as a teenager, when she was growing up in Stafford. She was born in 1955 in Glasgow; the family moved south when she was five, and she bears no trace of a Scottish accent. (In fact, her voice is rather strange, if powerful: it's as if she's speaking with the bottom row of her teeth.) They moved because her father, Frank, got\n\na job at English Electric (now GEC). \"He's always been very involved in politics,\" she says. \"He stood for the Labour Party in one of the terrible Thatcher elections, the one after the Falklands. Didn't get in. He's been a Labour councillor, and worked for his union most of his life. And my grandad was put in prison by Churchill for sedition! He occupied some tenements that were either going to be pulled down or have their tenants evicted. In his old age he became quite respectable and became Deputy Lord Provost of Glasgow.\"\n\nShe recounts this colourful family history with pride, although she says she isn't very political herself. \"I think the kind of energy politics would take has gone into poetry.\" What about her mother? Does Mrs Duffy, Mrs Frank, have an untold story? \"She was largely looking after us,\" she says.\n\nThere are four brothers, all younger: one works with children in care, one is managing director of Doc Martens, one is \"footloose and fancy-free in Aberdeen\", another is a journalist on the Mirror. (\"He's very loyal and would never write about me. And, as he says, all the muckraking about me was done by the broadsheets, not the tabloids.\") She describes it as a loving, strict, happy Catholic household: holidays in Blackpool every summer \"from six to 16\"; parents who still live in the house she grew up in. \"They're like salt and pepper,\" she says of them. \"The idea of them not being together is funny.\" How did they feel about her relationship with Adrian Henri? And how do they feel about Jackie Kay? \"Oh, fine,\" she says, breezily. \"They're very loving, not judgmental. They treat Jackie just like a daughter-in-law. I mean, we all stay there. They're the kind of parents who, if you murdered someone, their first instinct would be to hide you.\"\n\nIt was at school that she was encouraged to explore poetry, with two \"inspirational\" teachers, one each at the convent and the comprehensive she attended. Prompted by them, she had an \"excruciating pamphlet\" published when she was 16, \"a mixture of Keats and Sylvia Plath and Dylan Thomas and the Bible. A sort of teenage mix.\" She's so embarrassed about this publication that she won't even admit its title. \"I was at a signing last year and someone came up to me with it. I actually screamed. There was this anorak in front of me who'd paid Â£30 for it. I offered him Â£50, I wanted to destroy it. But he refused.\"\n\nThe image she presents of her life is so idyllic, so bouncy and healthy and straightforward, a world where everyone is \"supportive\" and she \"loves them dearly\". Perhaps this is because, as she says, she is increasingly distrustful of the press and would rather not reveal the darker side of her life. But perhaps there's another, simpler reason. Perhaps she's just got older, got happier, stopped needing to make sense of her sadnesses in her poetry.\n\nFor years, Duffy's poems have been about pain. Aching, powerful, they have been poems about loss: of love, of childhood, of the past. She describes poetry as \"trying to grow a past with words\". In 1985's Standing Female Nude, she meets an ex-lover and laments, \"Darling, whatever it was that covered/such an ordinary form with light/has long since gone.\" In 1990's The Other Country, she spends \"the weekend in bed, dozing, lounging/in the past. Why has this happened? I mime/the gone years where I lived. I want them back.\" And in Mean Time, her magnificent, supremely bleak 1993 collection, she feels her \"heart gnaw/at all our mistakes\". \"If the darkening sky could lift/more than one hour from this day/there are words I would never have said/nor have heard you say.\"\n\nNow she can write hopeful, happy poems, such as Demeter, a beautiful, optimistic work about how her daughter has changed her life; or poems that show a new kind of emotional confidence, such as Mrs Beast (\"Let the less-loving one be me\"), or Delilah, in which a man begs \"teach me how to care\". The World's Wife is simply a happier book than Mean Time, indeed than any of her other collections.\n\n\"I wonder why that should be,\" she says. \"I suppose since I've been writing poems I've drawn on my own life from about the age of 16 when I started having, you know, relationships. And because a lot of what I'm writing about is quite far away now, it felt both personal and re-moved. I was able to look at it in a much more objective way than if I was writing about something very recent. But, yes, this is a happier time in my life. Having a child has been like being in a house and finding a whole suite of rooms that you didn't know were in the house.\" There is a sense of wonderment about this, of surprise. \"That's how it feels. Or being a poem instead of writing it.\" She still courts nostalgia, with visits to Blackpool, holiday destination of her childhood. But these days she takes her daughter, the future, with her, too.\n\nSuddenly, Duffy is where she wants to be, no longer longing for the past. \"There's a poem in Mean Time called The Windows, about walking past other people's houses and seeing them happily cooking, and there's a line 'opening the front door to a wet dog'. It seemed to me a symbol of having a life. Well, I've never had a dog and we've just got one, a puppy. And the puppy came bounding in wet, and came up and knocked me over. And I thought, oh god, I've written this true.\" She shakes her head, smiling. \"That was just last week.\" Whoever said art can't come out of happiness?\n\nThese poems are exclusive extracts from The World's Wife, by Carol Ann Duffy, published by Picador on October 8, priced Â£10.
