        "text": "Steve Duffy’s Post\n\nProject Manager at Choose Life the Prisoners Initiative\n\n10mo\n\nThe Choose Life project was today in Ysgol Treffynnon Flintshire, again we come across a Teacher who saw Choose Life as a fourteen year old and is now taking his year nines to see a Choose Life event. Attached is our conversation with Mr Faulkes. The Choose Life project exists to provide first class education to young people and professionals and also allow our volunteers (all in recovery from drugs and alcohol and commonly ex offenders ) to receive a huge boost to their self esteem by playing a critical role in addiction education. We are financially sound but must charge expenses to remain sustainable , an event outside Liverpool normally costs about £70.00 all in. If you would like to book in Choose Life to your school, college or university please call 07809687762. Attached are the formal evaluations of Choose Life.

And then yeah just to choose life project we are in here today and strange little thing you saw your teacher here now. Yeah I'm a teacher here and I'm Mr. Folks. I run the Welsh literacy here at Scott Refund on and it was great coming in with my own year nines this morning to go through the Cheers life project with them based on the fact that 14 years ago I was sat in there. It sat in their seats granted at my own high school over on the other side of North Wales. And it's great to see that A, it's still going and B, it's obviously having a massive impact because you are consistently going. And the pupils have very much come out of here today with a lot to think about and a lot of discussions to be had as well. I think it's a really, really great project to be involved with. And what was your thoughts about it when you was a 14 year old in the school? What do you think about it then? I was petrified to be perfectly honest with you because it's something that I've never really kind of come across drugs myself in my own life. Or at least at that point I had, yes. And being a 14 year old, I didn't quite realize how naive I was to what was actually going on in the world around me. Yeah. And so many people now have now grown up that I see. Well, actually there was a lot going on. I just wasn't necessarily Privy to it. And the struggles that so many people have had and that to this day some of my friends are still having. It really, really puts things into perspective for me that you you never know. It could be that one moment, yeah, that will affect your life for the rest of your life or the manager. So come across drugs and university, absolutely. It's something that party drugs in particular were a big thing at university, people taking MDMA and things like that when they're going to clubs. And it never really interested me because I kind of saw the aftermath of them the following morning and it just really didn't didn't do anything for me at all. And it's something that I've gone into teaching. Try and encourage the next generation to make the best decisions for them. So then when we've got projects like this coming in where it's not just us as teachers telling them what they need to be doing, it's also they're getting real life authentic context from people who have been there, done that and got shirts. So I think it's really, really important that the kids experience this across the board. And that's great. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Thank you.\n\nSee more comments\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in"
