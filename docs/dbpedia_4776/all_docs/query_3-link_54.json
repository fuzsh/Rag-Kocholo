        "text": "In 2013, Law360 named Joseph one of five “Rising Stars” in the nation in the class action category. He was honored by the legal media after helping a global financial services firm defeat class actions over alleged foreclosure and debt collection practices, and for securing a verdict for an international toy retailer in the first consumer class action trial under California’s gift card law. Since that time, he has represented numerous financial services firms and retail clients in a variety of consumer class actions around the country.\n\nHis financial industry litigation experience includes defending various claims brought under state and federal statutes around the United States following the recent financial crisis. Joseph also defends a large number of national retailers facing class actions on behalf of consumers related to advertising, pricing, point of sale, privacy, and statutory claims. In addition, he serves as national coordinating and trial counsel in product liability and mass tort litigation, including having served as first- or second-chair trial counsel on more than a dozen cases. He represents chemical, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and construction products companies in product liability matters, including those related to asbestos, silica, and benzene. Joe’s commercial litigation work has also included matters involving employee rights, unfair competition, and OSHA claims.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Joseph advises retailers on gift cards, loyalty programs, sale advertising, and credit card compliance, including Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) issues. An active member of the firm’s food industry program, he also counsels food and retail companies on labeling and warning issues."
