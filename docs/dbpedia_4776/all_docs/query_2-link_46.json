        "text": "How Do Knee Surgeons Treat Meniscal Tears?\n\nIf you’ve ever torn your meniscus you might have felt it locking. It may have made the knee difficult to straighten. You might have experienced a sort of popping sensation. But what’s really happening inside the knee?\n\nIn this short (2m28s) video, Dave Duffy takes a camera into a meniscus procedure, to demonstrate exactly what happens during the process.\n\nNotes for the squeamish: This video features footage from an operation.\n\n• There is no blood – because the meniscus doesn’t have its own blood supply. All you’ll see are the off-white cartilages of the tibia and femur, and the meniscus itself.\n\n• The video also includes the cutting of a torn piece of the meniscus and the shaving of loose pieces of meniscus. Again, this is all blood-free.\n\nWant to talk about your knee pain? Please get in touch.\n\n> Discover more about Dave Duffy\n\n> Watch more of Dave Duffy’s videos"
