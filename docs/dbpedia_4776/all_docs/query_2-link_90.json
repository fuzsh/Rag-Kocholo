Throughout 2020, we've researched the impact of COVID-19 on people who are blind or have low vision, and advocated for meaningful responses to the pandemic. This work is only possible because of donations from people like you. If you value the information you've found on our site, please make a gift today!\n\nDonate Now\n\nFacts about Low Vision\n\nMost surveys and studies indicate that the majority of people in the United States with vision loss are adults who are not totally blind; instead, they have what is referred to as low vision. You may have heard the terms \"partial sight\" or \"partial blindness\" or even \"poor vision\" also used to describe low vision. Those descriptions are no longer in general use, however.\n\nHere is one definition of low vision, related to visual acuity:\n\nLow vision is a condition caused by eye disease, in which visual acuity is 20/70 or poorer in the better-seeing eye and cannot be corrected or improved with regular eyeglasses. (Scheiman, Scheiman, and Whittaker)\n\nVisual Acuity and Low Vision\n\nVisual acuity is a number that indicates the sharpness or clarity of vision. A visual acuity measurement of 20/70 means that a person with 20/70 vision who is 20 feet from an eye chart sees what a person with unimpaired (or 20/20) vision can see from 70 feet away.\n\n20/70 can best be understood by examining a standard eye testing chart that you may have used in your own doctor's office during an eye examination.\n\nIn the United States, the Snellen Eye Chart (pictured at left) is a test that ophthalmologists and optometrists use to measure a person's distance visual acuity. It contains rows of letters, numbers, or symbols printed in standardized graded sizes.\n\nYour eye doctor will ask you to read or identify each line or row at a fixed distance (usually 20 feet), although a 10-foot testing distance is also used.\n\nIf you can read line 8 (D E F P O T E C) from 20 feet away while wearing your regular glasses or contact lenses, the doctor records your vision (or visual acuity) as 20/20 with best correction.\n\nIf the smallest print you can read is line 3 (T O Z) from 20 feet away while wearing your regular glasses or contact lenses, the doctor records your vision (or visual acuity) as 20/70 with best correction.\n\nPlease note: An actual Snellen Eye Chart is much larger than the one depicted here; therefore, it's not recommended that you use this chart to test your own (or a friend's or family member's) visual acuity.\n\nA Functional Definition of Low Vision\n\nNot all eye care professionals agree with an exclusively numerical (or visual acuity) description of low vision. Here's another — more functional — definition of low vision:\n\nLow vision is uncorrectable vision loss that interferes with daily activities. It is better defined in terms of function, rather than [numerical] test results. (Massof and Lidoff)\n\nIn other words, low vision is \"not enough vision to do whatever it is you need to do,\" which can vary from person to person.\n\nMost eye care professionals prefer to use the term \"low vision\" to describe permanently reduced vision that cannot be corrected with regular glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery.\n\nIf you have low vision, it is necessary to have a different kind of eye examination that uses different and more detailed tests to determine what you can and cannot see. You can learn more about these specialized eye charts and testing procedures at What is a Low Vision Examination?\n\nLow Vision vs. Legal Blindness\n\n\"Legal blindness\" is a definition used by the United States government to determine eligibility for vocational training, rehabilitation, schooling, disability benefits, low vision devices, and tax exemption programs. It's not a functional low vision definition and doesn't tell us very much at all about what a person can and cannot see.\n\nPart 1 of the U.S. definition of legal blindness states this about visual acuity:\n\nA visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better-seeing eye with best conventional correction (meaning with regular glasses or contact lenses).\n\nThis is a 20/200 visual acuity measurement, correlated with the Snellen Eye Chart (pictured above):\n\nIf you can only read line 1 (the big \"E\") from 20 feet away while wearing your regular glasses or contact lenses, the doctor records your vision (or visual acuity) as 20/200 with best correction.\n\nUpdate: In 2007, the Social Security Administration updated the criteria for measuring legal blindness when using newer low vision test charts with lines that can measure visual acuity between 20/100 and 20/200. Under the new criteria, if a person's visual acuity is measured with one of the newer charts, and they cannot read any of the letters on the 20/100 line, they will qualify as legally blind, based on a visual acuity of 20/200 or less.\n\nPart 2 of the U.S. definition of legal blindness states this about visual field:\n\nOR a visual field (the total area an individual can see without moving the eyes from side to side) of 20 degrees or less (also called tunnel vision) in the better-seeing eye.\n\nThis is a representation of a constricted visual field:\n\nA living room viewed through a constricted visual field.\n\nSource: Making Life More Livable.

It is a classification system, rather than a definition.\n\nLight Perception and Light Projection\n\nThese terms describe the ability to perceive the difference between light and dark, or daylight and nighttime. A person can have severely reduced vision and still be able to determine the difference between light and dark, or the general source and direction of a light.\n\nThe stereotypical assumption – that people who are blind or have low vision live in a type of \"blackness\" that sighted people see when they close their eyes – is generally not accurate.\n\nAlthough every person sees differently, including persons with low vision, an individual who has light perception/projection can perceive the presence or absence of light. Some people describe light perception as knowing when a room light is on or off, or being able to walk toward a lighted lamp on a table in an otherwise darkened room.\n\nTotal Blindness\n\nTotal blindness is the complete lack of light perception and form perception, and is recorded as \"NLP,\" an abbreviation for \"no light perception.\"\n\nFew people today are totally without sight. In fact, 85% of all individuals with eye disorders have some remaining sight; approximately 15% are totally blind.\n\nLiving room image source: From Maureen A.
