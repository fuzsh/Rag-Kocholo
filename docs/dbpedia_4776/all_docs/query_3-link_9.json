For clients of this firm, you should read this notice alongside our general terms and conditions which provide further information on confidentiality, data privacy etc. This notice does not apply to any websites that may have a link to ours.\n\nWho we are\n\nData is collected, processed and stored by Duffy Fowler Gabbi; and we are what is known as the âdata controllerâ of the personal information you provide to us. Duffy Fowler Gabbi is a legal disciplinary practice authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority under number 405573.\n\nChildren\n\nOur services are not aimed specifically at children because in legal work children are generally represented by their parent or guardians.\n\nWhat we need\n\nThe exact information we will request from you will depend on what you have asked us to do or what we are contracted to do for you. There are two types of personal data (personal information) that you may provide to us:\n\nPersonal data: is the general information that you supply about yourself â such as your name, address, gender, date of birth, contact details, financial information etc.\n\nSensitive personal data: is, by its nature, more sensitive information and may include your racial or ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinions, health data, trade union membership, philosophical views, biometric and genetic data.\n\nIn the majority of cases personal data will be restricted to basic information and information needed to complete ID checks. However some of the work we do may require us to ask for more sensitive information.\n\nSources of information\n\nInformation about you may be obtained from a number of sources; including:\n\nYou may volunteer the information about yourself\n\nYou may provide information relating to someone else â if you have the authority to do so\n\nInformation may be passed to us by third parties in order that we can undertake your legal work on your behalf. Typically these organisations can be:\n\nBanks or building societies\n\nPanel providers who allocate legal work to law firms\n\nOrganisations that have referred work to us\n\nMedical or financial institutions â who provide your personal records / information\n\nWhy we need it\n\nThe primary reason for asking you to provide us with your personal data, is to allow us to carry out your requests â which will ordinarily be to represent you and carry out your legal work. The following are some examples, although not exhaustive, of what we may use your information for:\n\nVerifying your identity\n\nVerifying source of funds\n\nCommunicating with you\n\nTo establish funding of your matter or transaction\n\nObtaining insurance policies on your behalf\n\nProcessing your legal transaction including:\n\nProviding you with advice; carrying out litigation on your behalf; attending hearings on your behalf; preparing documents or to complete transactions\n\nKeeping financial records of your transactions and the transactions we make on your behalf\n\nSeeking advice from third parties; such as legal and non-legal experts\n\nResponding to any complaint or allegation of negligence against us\n\nWho has access to it\n\nWe have a data protection regime in place to oversee the effective and secure processing of your personal data. We will not sell or rent your information to third parties. We will not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.\n\nGenerally, we will only use your information within Duffy Fowler Gabbi.

There may be some uses of personal data that may require your specific consent. If this is the case we will contact you separately to ask for your consent which you are free to withdraw at any time.\n\nHow do we protect your personal data\n\nWe recognise that your information is valuable and we take all reasonable measures to protect it whilst it is in our care. We have exceptional standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personally identifiable data from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. Similarly, we adopt a high threshold when it comes to confidentiality obligations and both internal and external parties have agreed to protect confidentiality of all information; to ensure all personal data is handled and processed in line with our stringent confidentiality and data protection policies. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and we enforce, where possible, physical access controls to our buildings and files to keep data safe.\n\nHow long will we keep it for\n\nYour personal information will be retained, usually in computer or manual files, only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected; or as required by law; or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you may hold with us.
