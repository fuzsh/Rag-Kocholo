        "text": "As regular readers of the blog (especially in the beforetimes) will know, I spend a lot of time thinking about how I want to allocate my time and structure my days. I suspect I would think about this a lot regardless, but part of why I do is because I have interests and obligations outside of work that mean that I need and want to be pretty efficient and careful with how I spend my working hours.\n\nWhile I would like to pretend that summer is just beginning, I’m already finding that I need to start scheduling things, including recurring meetings, for the fall semester. (I drafted this in mid-July but delayed posting, so I regret to inform you that, once this post appears, it will be August. Eek!) There is a LOT of stuff that I want and need to do, and I’m trying to think about how I want to set up my weekly schedule. This has me revisiting an idea I was thinking about last year, but never quite fully implemented – the idea of setting a minimum amount of time I want to spend a week on some tasks and a maximum amount of time for other tasks. It also has me thinking about how I want to structure those tasks. I’m sharing this both in case it helps other folks thinking about similar things, and because I’m curious about different strategies people use.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nContrary to what I thought when I wrote this post, I will be teaching a 100-student upper level undergraduate course this fall. The course will focus on the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, and I’ve been thinking about the different components of the course. As I do so, a thing that constantly pops into my head is what the impact of generative AI tools like ChatGPT would be on a certain assignment.\n\nGiven the topic of the course, an obvious assignment (to me, at least), would be to ask students to take a scientific article that is relevant to the course and write a short summary of it for a general audience. But I banished that idea pretty much as soon as it popped into my head – surely at least some students would ask ChatGPT or something similar to do the assignment, and I don’t feel equipped yet to figure out how to handle that, especially with 100 students.\n\nSomething that is clear is that lots of folks are struggling to figure out what to do about writing assignments. As one example, the Chronicle of Higher Education covered this in June, including this:\n\nThe explosion in AI use, the endless hours spent figuring out whether — as he put it — there was a person on the other side of that paper, and the concern that students who cheat could end up getting the same grades as those who did the work sent Wilson reeling.\n\n“I’ve been teaching at this university for 17 years and suddenly this comes along to devalue everything I’ve done to become a caring, competent instructor, and the students are creating make-work for me,” he says, describing the shift as “devastating.” “I’m grading fake papers instead of playing with my own kids.”\n\nThat last part – whew. That hit home.\n\nFor this semester, I’ve settled on a mixture of assessments & assignments:\n\nexams that will be in class & sort of open note (more about this in a future post),\n\nsubmitting comments on readings before class,\n\n‘exit tickets’ based on in class discussions and activities, and\n\na science communication assignment where the options include making a video or visual (infographic/cartoon/comic) related to course material.\n\nMy hope is that I will mostly find myself grading work that my students actually did, and that doing the work will help them learn the course material and also develop some science communication skills.\n\nIf I was still teaching Grad Ecology, as originally planned, I would be thinking less about how to sidestep generative AI and more about how to incorporate it into the course (which I touched upon a bit here.) That would be harder, but also interesting in some ways.\n\nI’m curious what others are doing for their fall courses. Are you changing things? If you are changing (or already have changed) things, have the changes mainly been for writing-related (and maybe coding) assignments?\n\nIn the fall, I will be teaching my department’s graduate ecology course – a shift from my normal Intro Bio routine! I taught a section of the grad ecology course this past fall, but this coming fall will be my first time doing the whole thing.\n\nOne thing I’ve been wondering about is whether to have a debate in the course, where students are divided into groups and asked to argue in favor of a particular position. I have very little experience with this type of assignment (as either a student or instructor), and, sadly, have never seen one of the ASN meeting debates. I’d love to get feedback about possible debate topics and about how to structure the debate!\n\nA key reason I started thinking about this type of assignment was seeing a few recent papers on the impact of wolves in Yellowstone, including this paper by Gable et al. and this paper by Hobbs et al., which was the focus of a recent feature in the NY Times. So, at the top of my list of ideas of debate ideas is: what was the impact of reintroducing wolves on Yellowstone, or, if framed more generally, what is the evidence that reintroducing top predators restores ecosystems? (I think I would leave it intentionally a bit vague.)\n\nOnce I started thinking about that more, I started to wonder if it would be helpful to have more than one debate topic, with students only taking part in one of the debates. One reason for that is there will probably be about 30 students in the class, and having 15 students on a side seems like a lot.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nLast week, I had a post about the nuts and bolts (and emotions!) of responding to reviewers. In it, I talk about how my initial reaction to constructive criticism of my manuscripts is for my brain to fall out, leaving me unable to process anything for a while. I still think of myself as someone who is not very resistant to criticism, but who is resilient – I often feel pretty flattened by negative feedback, but bounce back fairly quickly. My approach is to give myself some time, then use a variety of strategies (post it notes, responding to X number of comments before taking a break, lots of chocolate, etc.) to revise the manuscript in response to the reviewer feedback. And, as I hope I made clear in that earlier post, it always ends up better as a result. The process is totally worth it in the end, but it’s definitely a process.\n\nWhat I want to cover in this post is something that I’ve been trying to figure out now that I have an administrative role: when getting feedback on something (e.g., a revised policy related to teaching), it feels to me like a live version of peer review. I’m realizing that many of the strategies I have used successfully to deal with the emotional parts of responding to peer reviews of manuscripts don’t work as well in the live setting, so I’ve been trying to develop some additional approaches. This is definitely still a work in progress for me, and I’d love to hear how others deal with this!\n\nAround the same time that I was thinking about this, I stumbled across the Handle Hard Better impromptu speech given by Kara Lawson, the coach of the Duke women’s basketball team. It’s less than 3 minutes, so it won’t take long to watch it. This is the key part (to me, at least):\n\nMake yourself a person that handles hard well, not someone that’s waiting for the easy. Because if you have a meaningful pursuit in life, it will never be easy.\n\nI had a whole variety of reactions when I first watched this – some of them complicated – but my overall takeaway is that this idea of trying to figure out how to handle hard better is a really helpful framing. The key then is figuring out how to actually do that! I’m still figuring it out, but right now one thing that is helping me is thinking about potatoes.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAlmost 10 years ago, I wrote a post about writing a response to reviewer comments. It focused on the overall structure of a response to reviewers, with suggestions on what to include and how to address things like if reviewers disagree. That post – which I think is still relevant – focused on the response itself. In this post, I want to focus more on my process for actually writing the response to reviewers and making the revisions. As I said in the earlier post, I’ve generally had the good fortune of responding to reviews that are thoughtful and constructive. Even with that, it can be…. an emotional journey. So much so that, when I saw this cartoon by Liz Fosslein* it immediately made me think of responding to reviewers:\n\nContinue reading →\n\nOne of the things we’re planning on doing with Dynamic Ecology 2.0 is revisiting some old posts that are still relevant, but possibly with some updating. This is one of those posts! The original post was a guest post by Catherine Searle, who at the time was just finishing up a postdoc and moving to a faculty position at Purdue. She’s now an Associate Professor! Being able to give a short, concise overview of your research is super useful and a skill that pretty much all of us could use some more practice with. Cat’s old post is still very relevant, so I encourage you to click through to read her original post, which you can find here.\n\nOnce you’ve done that, come back here to read some more ideas about specific exercises to help you hone your elevator pitch (a great lab meeting activity!) A PhD student in my lab, Teresa Sauer, led a lab meeting on this theme this past fall. While ‘elevator pitch’ is a common term for this, that particular setting – a 30 second ride in an elevator with someone to whom you are introducing yourself – is, well, unlikely. Teresa came up with some excellent ideas of more realistic scenarios where you’d want to give a quick introduction of what you work on to a range of people, including a visiting seminar speaker, a thirteen year old at a pop up outreach event, and two men at the boat launch who are about to go fishing (perhaps the most common informal outreach for people in my lab!)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIn a recent Friday linkfest, I shared a NY Times interview with Tara VanDerveer. There were a lot of things I loved about it, one of which came at the end:\n\nWe draw inspiration from those who play (and work) for us. Tell us about some players who inspired you.\n\nAngela Taylor was on the national title-winning team with two all-American guards so she almost never got to play. I asked her about her role. She said, “to spread sunshine.”\n\nThis didn’t only stand out to me – a colleague with whom I shared the article also loved that part, which led me to suggest that maybe we should add a section to our Annual Faculty Reports (‘tis the season) that asks about how much sunshine we’ve spread.\n\nI think this is not that hard to do, perhaps especially for those of us who are no longer early career. And I think a lot of people would enjoy doing this – it’s fun to receive the positive feedback, sure, but it’s also fun to share it. I think some of why it doesn’t happen more is people just don’t think to do it, hence this post. If you think of something positive you can share and you’re in a position to do so, consider spreading a little sunshine.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNote from Meghan: This is a guest post by my colleague Gina Baucom on a topic that’s sure to be of interest to lots of readers!\n\n***\n\nI lead a graduate-level professional development seminar* where we read about and discuss academia-related topics like mentoring, improving communication (Crucial Conversations ftw!), how to write grants and papers, social and emotional aspects of graduate school, and how we frame our relationships with work. I had to cancel a recent class because of an early-morning snow storm that made getting into campus at 9 am nearly impossible and pretty dangerous. (It took getting stuck behind three wrecks for me to finally decide to cancel). I felt pretty bad about canceling class from the road**, rather than earlier in the morning, and was also bummed that the students would miss out on that day’s planned discussion, which was on reading the literature and developing project ideas – arguably two pretty important topics for beginning graduate students! So, I wrote up a quick guide on both for the students, and then thought it might also be useful as a blogpost. The Dynamic Ecology bloggers (Hi! OMG you’re back!!) agreed, and the end result is below. These quick thoughts on literature reading and project formation are non-definitive; there are a number of ways one could go about either. I hope this guide is helpful nonetheless.\n\nContinue reading →"
