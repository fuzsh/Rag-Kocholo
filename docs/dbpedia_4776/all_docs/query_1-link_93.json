        "text": "The Library is pleased to present the Culture Picks for the month of March, curated, researched and written by Library volunteer Mike Duffy.\n\nMarch Culture Picks by Mike Duffy brings us three artists, three eras and three movements. All three artists were interested in science and even what some call science fiction. Two thought deeply about how we see. Two developed theories about how colors communicate. Two are credited with starting movements in art and one is the epitome of his era. In the Renaissance Leonardo da Vinci labored to represent what he saw exactly. At the end of the 19th Century, Sérusier strove to convey his feelings about what he saw in vibrant color and helped launch the Nabi movement and, perhaps, all of what we call modern art. In the middle of the 20th Century Vasarely developed a visual language of abstract symbols and colors leading the way to Op Art and beyond. What a rich feast for this season.\n\nAs always, we’ve selected books from our collection to go with the cultural visits. These books are displayed in the Members’ Lounge and available to be checked out.\n\nGuest blogger: Mike Duffy lives in Paris following his retirement from a career in university teaching and management. He spent his first 30 years in Pennsylvania (born in Pittsburgh, college and grad school in Philadelphia), then spent a bit more than that in California where he taught accounting and finance at the Universities of California (Berkeley), Southern California and San Francisco. He can now be found in art museums, historic sites, and concert halls throughout the city.\n\nVASARELY — SHARING FORMS\n\nCENTRE POMPIDOU\n\nThrough 6 May 2019\n\nWhat can you say about an exhibition of 300 works by one artist who is not Picasso? In the case of Vasarely — Sharing Forms you can say, “Wow!” You can say, “What fun!” You can say, “How intriguing.” This amazing, dizzying display at the Centre Pompidou invites all of these reactions. Vasarely’s art sometimes dazzles, sometimes razzle-dazzles and sometimes is just plain fun. As was the case with several other modern artists (Warhol, for example), Vasarely studied graphic arts and designed marketing and advertising materials before turning full-time to being an artist. From that background he knew how to create with an audience in mind, how to catch the eye and how to repeat an image to make a point. All three of those insights appear throughout this exhibition which is truly a feast for the eyes.\n\nVery early Vasarely showed an interest in visual perception. In the waving stripes of two rather fun pairs of zebras from 1936 and 1938, for example, you see the animals, but there are only waving stripes, no outlines. His 1947 Goulphar’s very flat fields of black looking like a disassembled Calder mobile and the more organic shapes in Kerrhon (1953 – 1954) soon give way, however, to geometric pieces, for a long time only in black and white, which break traditional rigid grids with pulsating bubbles and warped surfaces. Along the way there is a small 1952 painting of the town of Gordes clearly showing his awareness of Cézanne’s work with volumes and shapes followed by Cintra (1955 – 1956) which looks like a Mondrian on acid and Homage à Malévitch (1954 – 1958) in which he takes that painter’s static squares of white and black and puts them at angles to create uncertainty and movement. In fact, Vasarely seems to have drunk deeply at the early 20th Century fountains of the Russian constructivists like Malévitch (theory based geometry), the Dutch DeStijl like Mondrian and the Bauhaus like Klee (repetitive formal structures with bright colors) and the Parisian painters Kupka and Robert Delaunay (colorful, geometric works which “move”).\n\nHis own work moved into geometric abstraction, then increasingly into an abstraction of ideas and a concern for a universal form of communication. Eventually, he concentrated on designs using a limited set of forms and colors and believed that these could constitute a universal alphabet to create communication across cultures. There is a fine display of these forms and colors in one section of the exhibition including Étude 5 (Study 5, 1958 -1959/1975) and later many completed works utilizing his squares, circles, ovals and triangles. He turned to preparing formulas for works and having assistants create multiple variations in different materials. Some see this as an outsourcing which denies Vasarely the title of artist, while others see a prescient understanding of what will become computer generated art. Vasarely was interested in science throughout his life and his works are influenced by ideas about relativity and uncertainty that he gleaned from Einstein and Heisenberg who are both honored by pieces in this exhibition and his late works show a deep involvement with science fiction. He stated that “the two creative expressions of man, art and science, meet…to form an imaginary construct…” For Vasarely, his work was that imaginary construct. He was not an abstract expressionist looking deeply into his tormented soul, struggling to express his emotions. He was a rational, theory-based artist working on perception and perspective in a simplified but rich vocabulary of forms.\n\nOver the course of a life which nearly spanned the 20th Century, Victor Vasarely (1906 – 1997) explored and exploited a myriad of materials and methods and became the progenitor of a global artistic movement which plays with optical illusions and optically complex designs. In fact, in Thames and Hudson’s Dictionary of Art Terms, it is a Vasarely piece which defines Op Art. He worked with oil and acrylic on canvas, with paper, plastic and glass, with small ceramic dishes and massive ceramic walls, in two and three dimensions, in architecture, sculpture, collage, painting, posters, and prints. He willingly let his designs be exploited on book covers, plates and dishes, in fashion ads and just about anywhere they could be used. All of these uses are on display and the very nicely presented Gallimard book covers, for example, still look fresh and inviting. Especially interesting and worth a pause in the narrow area with slide presentations are the projects in which he cooperated with architects where the use of his circles and squares and bright colors bring both wonder and fun to the middle 20th Century bare concrete structures.\n\nVasarely wanted to share his designs everywhere and, in the 1970s, it seemed that they were. When I mention this exhibition to people who recall his designs when they were ubiquitous, I often get the reaction, “Oh, I don’t think I like Vasarely.”, but when I talk to anyone who has seen the works at the Centre Pompidou, I only hear how much that person enjoyed the show. Whether you are in the camp which is wary of Vasarely or if you don’t know his work, you should visit Vasarely—Sharing Forms to be amazed at the chronicle of a lifetime exploring lines, color and shapes, a life of sharing the forms which fascinated this exceptionally creative artist.\n\nRecommended books from the Library collection:\n\nLEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE—DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTIONBEAUX-ARTS DE PARIS, CABINET DE DESSINS\n\nThrough 19 April 2019"
