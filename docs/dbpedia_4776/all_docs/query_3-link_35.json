        "text": "http://duffymotors.co.uk/ (âWebsiteâ) is provided by DUFFY MOTORS MANCHESTER LTD (âweâ/âusâ/âourâ). In doing so, we may be in a position to receive and process personal information relating to you. As the controller of this information, weâre providing this Privacy Notice (âNoticeâ) to explain our approach to personal information.\n\nWe intend only to process personal information fairly and transparently as required by data protection law including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular, before obtaining information from you (including through use of cookies) we intend to alert you to this Notice, let you know how we intend to process the information (including through use of cookies) and (unless processing is necessary for at least one of the 5 reasons outlined in clause 2 below) weâll only process the information if you consent to that processing. The GDPR also defines certain âspecial categoriesâ of personal information thatâs considered more sensitive. These categories require a higher level of protection, as explained below.\n\nOf course, you may browse parts of this Website without providing any information about yourself and without accepting cookies. In that case, itâs unlikely weâll possess and process any information relating to you.\n\nWeâll start this Notice by setting out the conditions we must satisfy before processing your data. However, you may wish to start with this table at clause 4, which summarises what we intend to collect, or this table at clause 8.5, which summarises our use of cookies. The Notice also explains some of the security measures we take to protect your personal information, and tells you certain things we will or wonât do.\n\nSometimes, when you take a new service or product from us, or discuss taking a new service or product but decide against, we might wish to provide you with further information about similar services or products by email or other written electronic communication. In that situation, we will always give you the opportunity to refuse to receive that further information and if you change your mind please let us know. Weâll endeavour to remind you of your right to opt-out on each occasion that we provide such information.\n\nIdentity and contact details\n\nRegistered number: 6338500\n\nRegistered office: Arch, 16-17 Watson Street, Manchester, M3 4LP\n\nduffymotors@btconnect.com\n\nWhen weâre allowed to collect information from you\n\nWe will only collect personal information relating to you if one of the following conditions have been satisfied:\n\nYou have clearly told us that you are content for us to collect that information for the certain purpose or purposes that we will have specified.\n\nThe processing is necessary for the performance a contract that we have with you.\n\nThe processing is necessary so that we can comply with the law.\n\nThe processing is necessary to protect someoneâs life.\n\nThe processing is necessary for performance of a task thatâs in the public interest.\n\nThe processing is necessary for our or anotherâs legitimate interest â but in this case, weâll balance those interests against your interests.\n\nHow to consent\n\nAt the point of collecting the information, weâll endeavour to explain how we intend to use the information and which of these purposes apply. If we rely on consent, weâll provide you with the opportunity to tell us that youâre happy to provide the information.\n\nIf at any point in time you change your mind and decide that you donât consent, please let us know and weâll endeavour to stop processing your information in the specified manner, or weâll delete your data if there is no continuing reason for possessing it.\n\nIf you donât consent to a particular bit of processing, weâll endeavour to ensure that the Website and our service continue to operate without the need for that information.\n\nInformation we expect to collect from you\n\nWe envisage asking for the following types of information from you:\n\nWe may collect personal information about you from a number of sources, including the following:\n\nFrom you when you agree to take a service or product from us, in which case this may include your contact details, date of birth, how you will pay for the product or service and your bank details.\n\nFrom you when you contact us with an enquiry or in response to a communication from us, in which case, this may tell us something about how you use our services.\n\nFrom documents that are available to the public, such as the electoral register.\n\nFrom third parties to whom you have provided information with your consent to pass it on to other organisations or persons â when we receive such information we will let you know as soon as is reasonably practicable.\n\nIf you refuse to provide information requested, then if that information is necessary for a service we provide to you we may need to stop providing that service.\n\nAt the time of collecting information, by whichever method is used, weâll endeavour to alert you and inform you about our purposes and legal basis for processing that information, as well as whether we intend to share the information with anyone else or send it outside of the European Economic Area. If at any point you think weâve invited you to provide information without explaining why, feel free to object and ask for our reasons.\n\nUsing your personal information\n\nData protection, privacy and security are important to us, and we shall only use your personal information for specified purposes and shall not keep such personal information longer than is necessary to fulfil these purposes. The following are examples of such purposes. We have also indicated below which GDPR justification applies, however it will depend on the circumstances of each case. At the time of collecting we will provide further information, and you may always ask for further information from us.\n\nTo help us to identify you when you contact us. This will normally be necessary for the performance our contract.\n\nTo help us to identify accounts, services and/or products which you could have from us or selected partners from time to time. We may do this by automatic means using a scoring system, which uses the personal information youâve provided and/or any information we hold about you and personal information from third party agencies (including credit reference agencies). We will only use your information for this purpose if you agree to it.\n\nTo help us to administer and to contact you about improved administration of any accounts, services and products we have provided before, do provide now or will or may provide in the future. This will often be necessary, but sometimes the improvements will not be necessary in which case we will ask whether you agree.\n\nTo allow us to carry out marketing analysis and customer profiling (including with transactional information), conduct research, including creating statistical and testing information. This will sometimes require that you consent, but will sometimes be exempt as market research.\n\nTo help to prevent and detect fraud or loss. This will only be done in certain circumstances when we consider it necessary or the law requires it.\n\nTo allow us to contact you by written electronic means (such as email, text or multimedia messages) about products and services offered by us where:\n\nthese products are similar to those you have already purchased from us,\n\nyou were given the opportunity to opt out of being contacted by us at the time your personal information was originally collected by us and at the time of our subsequent communications with you, and\n\nyou have not opted out of us contacting you.\n\nTo allow us to contact you in any way (including mail, email, telephone, visit, text or multimedia messages) about products and services offered by us and selected partners where you have expressly consented to us doing so.\n\nWe may monitor and record communications with you (including phone conversations and emails) for quality assurance and compliance.\n\nBefore doing that, we will always tell you of our intentions and of the specific purpose in making the recording. Sometimes such recordings will be necessary to comply with the law. Alternatively, sometimes the recording will be necessary for our legitimate interest, but in that case weâll only record the call if our interest outweighs yours. This will depend on all the circumstances, in particular the importance of the information and whether we can obtain the information another way thatâs less intrusive.\n\nIf we think the recording would be useful for us but that itâs not necessary weâll ask whether you consent to the recording, and will provide an option for you to tell us that you consent. In those situations, if you donât consent, the call will either automatically end or will not be recorded.\n\nWhen itâs required by law, weâll check your details with fraud prevention agencies. If you provide false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we intend to record this.\n\nWe will not disclose your personal information to any third party except in accordance with this Notice, and in particular in these circumstances:\n\nThey will be processing the data on our behalf as a data processor (where weâll be the data controller). In that situation, weâll always have a contract with the data processor as set out in the GDPR. This contract provides significant restrictions as to how the data processor operates so that you can be confident your data is protected to the same degree as provided in this Notice.\n\nSometimes it might be necessary to share data with another data controller. Before doing that weâll always tell you. Note that if we receive information about you from a third party, then as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards weâll let you know; thatâs required by the GDPR.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes we might consider it to be in your interest to send your information to a third party. If thatâs the case, weâll always ask whether you agree before sending.\n\nWhere you give us personal information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that you have provided them with the information set out in this Notice and that they have not objected to such use of their personal information.\n\nIn connection with any transaction which we enter into with you:\n\nIf you provide false or inaccurate information to us and we suspect fraud, we will record this and may share it with other people and organisations. We, and other credit and insurance organisations, may also use technology to detect and prevent fraud.\n\nWe may need to transmit the payment and delivery information provided by you during the order process for the purpose of obtaining authorisation from your bank.\n\nWe may allow other people and organisations to use personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:\n\nIf we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired or are in the process of being acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us, about our customers, will be one of the transferred assets.\n\nIf we have been legitimately asked to provide information for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings.\n\nWe may employ companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf and we may disclose your personal information to these parties for the purposes set out above, for example, for fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links) and providing customer service. Those parties will be bound by strict contractual provisions with us and will only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and they may not use it for any other purpose. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Notice and as permitted by the GDPR. From time to time, these other people and organisations to whom we may pass your personal information may be outside the European Economic Area. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Notice and the GDPR.\n\nProtecting information\n\nWe have strict security measures to protect personal information.\n\nWe work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt information you input.\n\nWe reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.\n\nWe maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.\n\nIt is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.\n\nThe internet\n\nIf you communicate with us using the internet, we may occasionally email you about our services and products. When you first give us personal information through the Website, we will normally give you the opportunity to say whether you would prefer that we donât contact you by email. You can also always send us an email (at the address set out below) at any time if you change your mind.\n\nPlease remember that communications over the internet, such as emails and webmails (messages sent through a website), are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before they are delivered â this is the nature of the internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.\n\nCookies and other internet tracking technology\n\nWhen we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. This sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your computer, which is sent back to us at a later time. These are called âcookiesâ. These cookies are listed in the table at clause 8.5.

Multiple cookies may be found in a single file depending on which browser you use.\n\nWhere applicable, this section of the Notice also relates to that technology but the term âcookieâ is used throughout.\n\nSome of these cookies are essential to services youâve requested from us, whereas others are used to improve services for you, for example through:\n\nLetting you navigate between pages efficiently\n\nEnabling a service to recognise your computer so you donât have to give the same information during one task\n\nRecognising that you have already given a username and password so you donât need to enter it for every web page requested\n\nMeasuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and that there is enough capacity to ensure they are fast\n\nTo learn more about cookies, you may wish to visit:Â allaboutcookies.org,Â www.youronlinechoices.euÂ orÂ www.google.com/policies/technologies/cookies/\n\nThis Website uses, or allows use of, the following cookies:\n\nThe distinctions referred to in the above table are as follows:\n\nFirst party versus third party cookies â we set first party cookies ourselves; third party cookies are set by other entities via our Website.\n\nSession versus persistent cookies â session cookies only persist for the duration of that visit; persistent cookies last for longer\n\nIdentifying information removed â just because weâve done this, they will still be personal information if the relevant information can be reassembled\n\nCategories 1-4 found in the ICC UK Cookie guide, as explained below. Category 1 cookies donât require the userâs consent, though you must still tell them about the cookies. Categories 2-4 do require their specific and informed consent.\n\nAs with any other information we may collect from you, weâll work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt information you input.\n\nThe Website may include links to third-party websites.
