        "text": "FRom the pRL / originally written in english / C20TH / Europe / england\n\n“Just as the body is shaped for movement, the mind is shaped for poetry.”\n\nJeanette Winterson writing about Carol Ann Duffy in the Guardian\n\nIntroduction\n\nEach of the thirty poems in this book takes as its theme a character from history, mythology, literature or popular culture and gives it a feminist treatment, usually by telling the untold story of the woman lost in the shade cast by a better-known male character.\n\nEntitled The World’s Wife, and first published in 1999, the collection presents stories, myths, and fairy tales popular in western culture. But this time we hear them from the point of view of women; the unsung, silenced or marginalised women close to famous men. Traditionally these women may have had no names; some of the poems’ titles follow a pattern (‘Mrs Midas’, ‘Mrs Darwin’, ‘Pygmalion’s Wife’ and so on) which bitterly suggests that women have been so neglected by history and culture the only way they can be identified is by association with their husbands’ name.\n\nLearner Profile: Risk-taker\n\nStudents approach unfamiliar situations and uncertainty with courage and forethought, and have\n\nthe independence of spirit to explore new roles, ideas and strategies. They are brave and articulate in defending their beliefs.\n\nOne of the most powerful and disturbing poems in this collection is The Devil’s Wife, where Duffy adopts the voice of a convicted child murderer to explore notions such as the nature of evil, the limitations of the justice system and the phenomenon of ‘trial by media.’ One of her intentions was to re-humanize a person who was called ‘the most evil woman in Britain.’ This approach is not without certain dangers for a person of Carol Ann Duffy’s standing and reputation. While you study The Devil’s Wife, consider the risk she was taking when writing and publishing a poem like this.\n\nLang and Lit Concept: Identity\n\nMuch of literature through the ages and (despite some recent redressing of balance) even today is patriarchal, presenting the world from a male perspective. The phrase ‘dead white man’ has been applied to the canonical lists of literary texts prescribed by schools and universities. These poems were intended by Carol Ann Duffy to rectify this imbalance. The poems – and through them, the voices of heretofore-silenced women – are witty, smart, adventurous, playful, sharp and complex, revealing the plurality of identities that were, until now, lost in the shadow of the stories of great men.\n\nLittle Red Cap\n\nDo Your Research\n\nAs well as alluding to the British Military Police, red caps were a significant symbol of the French Revolution. Find out more about the history and meaning of this symbol, then discuss the connotations Duffy brings not only to this poem, but to the entire collection, through the title character: Little Red Cap.\n\nDiscussion Points\n\nIn what ways is knowledge of the original ‘Little Red Riding Hood’ fairy tale helpful to your understanding of this poem?\n\nIn what ways are aspects of relationships between older men and younger women explored in this poem? To what extent does the poem clarify or complicate your ideas about this issue?\n\nHow far do you agree with the view that Little Red Cap is essentially about learning to accept what life throws at you?\n\nResources\n\nLittle Red Cap: Litchart\n\nLittle Red Cap: Worksheet and Activities\n\nLearner Portfolio: Rite of Passage\n\nAlthough Little Red Cap is a speaker of the poet’s own invention, her story is autobiographical; Little Red Cap’s journey is an imitation of Carol Ann Duffy’s own rite of passage. For example, the wolf is a reflection of Adrian Henri, Duffy’s mentor with whom she had a ten-year affair. Write a learner portfolio entry that shows your understanding of this ‘rite of passage,’ and how the speaker’s voice develops through the poem. You might like to follow these stages:\n\nQueen Herod\n\nDo Your Research\n\nFind out about The Massacre of the Innocents. After you have read the poem, discuss whether Duffy’s Queen seems like a person who could do such as thing. Why has Duffy portrayed her like this?\n\nDiscussion Points\n\nDo you agree or disagree with the following statement? Explain your thoughts: Despite the religious backdrop of the poem, Queen Herod has very little to do with religion.\n\nHow confident do you think the voice of Queen Herod sounds throughout this poem?\n\nResources\n\nQueen Herod: Worksheet and Activities\n\nLearner Portfolio: Practise for Paper 1 (Literature students only)\n\nIf you are a Language A: Literature student, at the end of your course you will sit Paper 1: Guided Literary Analysis. This paper contains two previously unseen literary passages. SL students write a guided analysis of one of these passages; HL students write about both passages. The passages could be taken from any of four literary forms: prose, poetry, drama or literary non-fiction. Each of the passages will be from a different literary form.\n\nHere are two passages taken from The World’s Wife; as this is a collection of poems the literary form is ‘poetry’. We didn’t focus on either of these poems when we studied Duffy’s collection, so you can approach them as unseen texts. Each passage is accompanied by a guiding question to provide a focus or ‘way in’ to your response. Choose one passage and complete this Learner Portfolio entry in the style of Paper 1: Guided Literary Analysis.\n\nThetis\n\nDo Your Research\n\nFind out who Thetis is; once you know, ask why did Duffy choose her story to retell in her The World’s Wife?\n\nDiscussion Points\n\nWhat does the poem suggest about the experiences of a woman living in a world dominated by men?\n\nHow would you describe ‘masculinity’ as presented in this poem?\n\nThetis is a being who is able to ‘shape-shift’ or change her appearance. To what extent does the poem explore the idea that, in actual fact, she alters not just her appearance but her very identity?\n\nLearner Portfolio: Living in a Man’s World\n\n“Duffy’s version of Thetis helps us to contemplate how difficult it can be for a woman to express her true identity in a male-dominated world.”\n\nWhat are some of the ways she encourages us to think about this idea in Thetis and other poems? Write a one-two page portfolio entry where you discuss this theme.\n\nSalome\n\nDiscussion Points\n\nWhat are ladettes? How, and why, does Duffy tackle this subject in her poem?\n\nTone can reveal the attitude of the speaker towards her subject matter. How would you describe the poem’s tone? Give reasons for your impressions. Does the tone change or is it consistent?\n\nLearner Portfolio: Practise for Paper 2\n\nWrite this Learner Portfolio in the style of a practice Paper 2 response. You can use one of the prompts below, or another prompt given to you by your teacher. Although Paper 2 requires you to write about two literary works, for the sake of this exercise you could focus only on your response to The World’s Wife, or you could try to compare your ideas to another literary work you have studied.\n\nChoose one of the following prompts (or use another prompt you have been given), talk with your teacher about how to approach and structure your writing, then complete your portfolio entry:\n\nReferring to works you have studied, consider the ways in which writers employ humour and to what effect.\n\nContrast is often necessary to hold the attention of readers. How and with what effects do writers you have studied use contrast?\n\nExplore how women are represented as stronger than men in literary works you have studied.\n\nJudging by literary works you have studied, what would you say are the main causes of unhappiness?\n\nMrs Midas\n\nDo Your Research\n\nLook up the story of King Midas. When you have read the story, discuss how much of the myth Duffy has used in her poem, and how far has she changed it?\n\nDiscussion Points\n\nWho do you think came off worse in this poem – Midas or his wife? Explain your choice.\n\nIn some versions of the myth, the curse is lifted. Why do you think Duffy chose to finish her poem without this happening?\n\nResources\n\nMrs Midas: Worksheet and Activities\n\nMrs Midas: Litchart\n\nWider Reading – Unhappily Ever After\n\nLearner Portfolio: Thematic Investigation\n\nChoose one of the following themes. Write a Learner Portfolio entry about how this theme is manifest in Mrs Midas and one other poem in the collection:\n\nThe silencing or marginalisation of women;\n\nLoneliness;\n\nConsequences of greed.\n\nQueen Kong\n\nDo Your Research\n\nYou might like to watch the original (and best) movie of King Kong when you read this poem.\n\nDiscussion Points\n\nTo what extent is it necessary to have knowledge of King Kong in order to appreciate the poem Queen Kong?\n\nIs the poem written in chronological or non-chronological order? What is the effect of the structure of the poem?\n\nQueen Kong is a modern ‘beauty and the beast’ story. What points do you think Duffy is making through the humorous retelling of this story?\n\nResources\n\nQueen Kong: Film Comparison\n\nQueen Kong: Study Questions\n\nLearner Portfolio: Dramatic Monologue\n\nThink of a female character from a novel, play, story, television show or movie that is male-driven. Write a monologue from the point of view of the female character. Use your monologue to give the reader insights into the thoughts, feelings and concerns of the woman in the story.\n\nThe Devil’s Wife\n\nDo Your Research\n\nResearch the story of The Moors Murderers and the lingering aftermath of the crimes committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. Think about why, and how, murder cases such as this might stay in the public consciousness for so long.\n\nDuffy’s poem raises the issue of misogyny in the public eye. Would Myra Hindley have been as despised if she were not a woman? How does the treatment of Hindley (by the media, the general public and the family of the victims) in the aftermath of her conviction compare to that of Ian Brady? Although this might be a difficult subject, you can watch a case study of Myra Hindley here.\n\nDiscussion Points\n\nWhat is the significance of Duffy choosing to write using the voice of Myra Hindley. Why does she make this decision? What are the risks for the poet in choosing to write from Hindley’s point of view?\n\nOnce you have read the poem, consider your personal response. Is it a sympathetic portrayal? How were you left feeling by Duffy’s portrayal of Myra Hindley? Did she succeed in making you feel sorry for her at any point?\n\nDuffy has written the poem in five stanzas, and given each stanza a provocative heading. What do you think is the significance of each one?\n\nLearner Portfolio: Humanising Evil\n\nWhat are the effects of using Myra Hindley’s voice as the narrator of this poem? Write a portfolio entry answering this question. You might like to include some of the following ideas and concepts in your piece:\n\nTowards Assessment: Higher Level Essay\n\nStudents submit an essay on one non-literary text or a collection of non-literary texts by one same author, or a literary text or work studied during the course. The essay must be 1,200-1,500 words in length. (20 Marks).\n\nPlease find suggestions here; but always be mindful of your own ideas and class discussions and follow the direction of your own programme of study when devising your assessment tasks.\n\nNow you have read The World’s Wife, you might like to turn your attention to the Higher Level essay that all higher level students must write. If you would like to write about this collection, an interesting line of inquiry would be an examination of the voices of the women. Many of the women in the collection are bystanders, forced to watch husbands and lovers make idiots of themselves. In some poems, the women are forced to act in ways that seem unpleasant in order to get out of the mess that men have made, and still other women make compromises or end up disappointed… or worse. Throughout, we hear the voices of women while they express scorn and disgust for their husbands.\n\nIn writing an essay like this, you should consistently reference two or three particular poems in the collection that you think best support your ideas. As suggestions, interesting questions might therefore be:\n\nHow far do the voices of women in The World’s Wife express contempt for the behaviour of men?\n\nTo what extent is The World’s Wife preoccupied with the idea that men are to blame for the insecurities of women?\n\nWith what methods, and creating what effects, does Carol Ann Duffy depict men in The World’s Wife?\n\nExamine the use of rhythm, rhyme and/or repetition in The World’s Wife by Carol Ann Duffy.\n\nWhat effects are created by different kinds of juxtaposition in Carol Ann Duffy’s The World’s Wife?\n\nHow does Carol Ann Duffy craft and shape the voices of women in her collection The World’s Wife?\n\nTowards Assessment: Individual Oral\n\nSupported by an extract from one non-literary text and one from a literary work (or two literary works if you are following the Literature-only course) students will offer a prepared response of 10 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of questions by the teacher, to the following prompt: Examine the ways in which the global issue of your choice is presented through the content and form of two of the texts that you have studied. (40 marks)\n\nPlease find suggestions here; but always be mindful of your own ideas and class discussions and follow the direction of your own programme of study when devising your assessment tasks.\n\nThe World’s Wife would make an excellent text to discuss in this oral assessment. The poems are witty, moving, funny and assured. The themes they explore may seem straightforward, but the variety of poetic effects Duffy employs elevates her ideas beyond mere polemic, and will give you lots to analyse throughout the talk. Now you have finished reading and studying the poems, spend a lesson working with the IB Fields of Inquiry: mind-map the novel, come up with ideas for Global Issues, make connections with other Literary Works or Body of Works that you have studied on your course and see if you can make a proposal you might use to write your Individual Oral.\n\nHere are one or two suggestions to get you started, but consider your own programme of study before you make any firm decisions about your personal Global Issue. Whatever you choose, remember a Global Issue must have local relevance, wide impact and be trans-national:"
