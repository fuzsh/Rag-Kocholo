        "text": "The first time I met Carol Ann Duffy she made me cry. I was meant to be interviewing her but within minutes of meeting her I had told her everything about my broken heart.\n\nI could tell her because I knew she understood about love and loss, passion and pain.\n\nShe gets it, and that's what makes her the best poet of her generation and an inspired choice as the next Poet Laureate.\n\nAnyone who has ever known love or heartbreak will find a home in her work. Not that there is anything soppy about Carol Ann Duffy.\n\nShe can look quite serious until you say something that she likes and her face cracks open and she laughs her wonderfully dirty laugh.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, the child of a Scottish father and Irish mother, the family consisting of Carol Ann and her four brothers moved to Staffordshire when she was four.\n\nHer dad Frank was a strong trade unionist, active in the Labour Party and stood as a parliamentary candidate. He followed the path of his own father, also Frank, who was one of the early leaders of the Scottish Labour movement. Carol Ann says her family weren't bookish: \"My mother had to leave school at 14 and she regretted it so much - so she was determined that we were going to get the best out of our education.\"\n\nBut mum May was more than ambitious for her children. Carol Ann says: \"She was entrancing, fantastic at making up rhymes and stories. I think it was her Irish syntax and voice music that started my love of words.\" Carol Ann started writing poems as a teenager: \"I put together my first pamphlet when I was 16 - they were awful teenage stuff.\"\n\nSoon afterwards she met Liverpool poet Adrian Henri. Later, when she went to Liverpool University he became what she calls \"the first love of her life\" even though he was a good deal older. \"I lived with him for about a decade. We were friends, then lovers, then friends. I was with him when he died.\"\n\nThe second great love of her life was the Scottish poet Jackie Kay, whom she also lived with for 10 years. \"It's over now but we are still the warmest of friends. She supports me.\"\n\nCarol Ann is single now but lives with the greatest love in her life, her 13-year old daughter Ella, by the novelist Peter Benson. \"I let her decide whether I should accept the Laureateship or not.\n\nShe was all for it, she said, 'Mum. it's time a woman did it'.\"\n\nCarol Ann says: \"I always wanted a child. Being a mother is the central thing in my life. Having a child takes you back to all those parts of your own childhood that you had hidden away.\"\n\nMay, Carol Ann's mother entranced her daughter with her stories and rhymes. Carol Ann does the same for Ella but she publishes hers. \"Since I had Ella, I have written more for children than for adults. I read everything to Ella first.\"\n\nElla herself is more interested in music than poetry although her mother says she does \"cruelly accurate imitations of me reading my poems\". Ten years ago, Carol Ann was quoted as saying she didn't want the Laureateship because \"no poet should have to write poems about Edward and Sophie's wedding\".\n\nBut age and motherhood have tempered that view. \"I am a poet of the family, and the symbol of the Royal Family is entwined with the history of Britain. I don't see why that can't make a good poem. On the other hand, no one would thank me for writing bad poems to order.\" Family is at the heart of Carol Ann's life and work. For the past four years Carol Ann and her brothers and their 13 children go to Connemara to remember their mother and grandmother May, who died four years ago from cancer.\n\n\"She had a very rare form of cancer and died in less than a year. She was barely 70. It was four years ago, but it feels like four months, the pain is still fresh. That was real heartbreak.\" May wasn't just Carol Ann's inspiration - some of her best poems are about her - she was part of her working life, looking after Ella at readings and literary festivals. But she was also crucial as a reader.\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nCarol Ann says: \"She read everything I wrote. If something was too complex, she would ask me what it meant. So I have always tried to use simple words to express complicated things. I think that's a good thing for a poet.\" She says: \"You can find poetry in your everyday life, your memory, in what people say on the bus, in the news, or just what's in your heart.\"\n\nCarol Ann writes or reads poetry every day. \"I have piles of poetry books in the bathroom, on the stairs, everywhere. The only way to write poetry is to read it.\" Her favourite among her own poems is A Child's Sleep, which she wrote about her daughter Ella.\n\nBut her work ranges from love poems such as the collection Rapture which charts the intense progress of a love affair, to the comic, such as these lines from The World's Wife: Mrs Darwin 7th April 1852 Went to the Zoo.\n\nI said to Him - Something about that chimpanzee over there reminds me of you.\n\nToday, Carol Ann's deceptively simple poems are studied at school and university.\n\nShe is the director of the creative writing school at Manchester Metropolitan University and her last collection Rapture won the T.S Eliot prize (the most prestigious prize in poetry) in 2007. She lives in Didsbury in South Manchester and does the school run every morning.\n\nShe is donating the Laureate's money to finance a new poetry prize.\n\nShe is quite the pillar of the community - except that Carol Ann Duffy will always be a free spirit.\n\nI once sat next to her when she was giving a radio interview after winning the Forward Prize. The interviewer said he had counted four breasts in one of the poems. Carol Ann told him, on air: \"Grow up - it's a love poem.\"\n\nCarol Ann isn't a woman poet or a gay poet or a poet who grew up in Staffordshire.\n\nShe is just a great poet who can do the difficult stuff in words we can all understand.\n\nMonday: Exclusive new children's poems from Carol Ann\n\nThe ode Fellows Poets Laureate, the full list..\n\n1668 John Dryden\n\n1688 Thomas Shadwell\n\n1715 Nicholas Rowe\n\n1718 Rev Laurence Eusden\n\n1730 Colley Cibber\n\n1757 William Whitehead\n\n1692 Nahum Tate\n\n1790 Henry James Pye\n\n1813 Robert Southey\n\n1843 William Wordsworth 1785 Rev Thomas Warton\n\n1850 Alfred, Lord Tennyson\n\n1896 Alfred Austin\n\n1913 Robert Bridges\n\n1930 John Masefield\n\n1967 Cecil Day-Lewis\n\n1972 Sir John Betjeman\n\n1984 Ted Hughes\n\n1999 Andrew Motion\n\n2009 Carol Ann Duffy yesterday"
