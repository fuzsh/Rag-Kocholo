        "text": "Meanings of loss\n\nUnderstandably traumatic bereavement leads to thoughts and feelings of loss. A key aim of therapy is to differentiate beliefs that are normal after bereavement and that generate sadness such as ‘I have lost my loved one and will miss her dearly’ from idiosyncratic added negative meanings that generate pathological grief such as ‘I have lost everything’, ‘I am permanently changed’ and ‘I am forever alone’. Such appraisals, whilst maintaining PTSD, also keep traumatic grief in place and can be inhibitors to the patient engaging in rebuilding life activities. A few sessions into treatment when the patient may have benefited from some rebuilding life activities, the therapist may gently guide the patient to think about what has not been lost and what the deceased would want for them. The therapist will be working to shift the focus from loss to moving forward with loss. The therapist may use surveys to help normalise the patient’s feelings of loneliness and isolation as well as to generate compassionate responses from other people, which may help the patient to take steps to engage in social activities. For further discussion on how, when and why to use surveys in CBT, please see Murray et al. (2022). The therapist will often use imagery transformation to create a sense of continuity with the meaning of the person who died, focusing on how the patient can take the loved one forward with them. The therapist may summarise core learning on a flashcard. Updating information, such as what the patient has not lost and how they are taking their loved one forward with them, will be brought back into the trauma memory when the patient and therapist work together on the memory.\n\nJasmine’s son died in a road traffic accident. She had two surviving children. She believed she had lost everything and that she was all alone, that no-one would understand or want to socialise with her, that she was burdensome and that she would experience zero joy from being around other people. The therapist created a survey with Jasmine and then a behavioural experiment. See Table for an example of the completed survey with one respondent; see Table for the experiment the therapist planned with Jasmine.\n\nTable 2.\n\nSurvey\n\nA mother of three lost her son in a road traffic accident three years ago. She no longer wants to go out, believing that she is a burden and that no-one would want to socialise with her. She believes that seeing other people would bring her zero joy.\n\nHow much, out of 100%, do you think this woman is a burden because of her experience?\n\nBereavement is so tough and it’s common to feel like a burden because the feelings are burdensome for the person who has lost someone they love. I empathise. I would not find this person a burden. 0%\n\nIf you met her at a social occasion, would you want to socialise with her?\n\nI would definitely want to socialise with her. Our experiences make us who we are.\n\nIf this were a friend of yours, what would you say to her?\n\nI would hug her and say how sorry I am at what she has gone through, I do understand how devastating it is and how there will be times it will be tough to get out of bed in the morning, let alone try to meet up with people. I would encourage her to take small steps and to be kind to herself, moving forward with this grief takes one step at a time. Over time, moments of joy will punctuate her grief after lots of small steps. I’d ask her how I could help and what I could do that might make things more manageable for her like cooking dinner or taking her other two children out with mine whenever she would like.\n\nTable 3\n\nSituationPredictionsExperimentOutcomeLearningGoing for coffee with Fatma, Zaheera and CindyI will be a burden 100%. I will know this because my friends will want to leave after 20 minutes or they will make efforts to change the conversation\n\nThey will tell me I should think about moving on 100%Go for coffee, be honest about how I am feeling when asked without apologisingHad coffee, only intended to stay for an hour but we chatted for almost two and a half hours. I did cry and they were so great. Zaheera held my hand. Although I felt like a burden my friends did not treat me like one\n\nNo one told me I should be moving onIt was hard to go out. I’m glad I did, I do feel better for it and I wouldn’t have discovered this if I had avoided it. Maybe seeing some friends on occasion is good for me\n\nI am a burden 50%\n\nMy friends think I should move on 50%\n\nThe therapist created a flashcard for Jasmine with the learning from the behavioural experiment and the survey (see Table ). They added to the flashcard what she thought her son would want for her, as well as how she would take her son forward with her. When Jasmine spotted the urge to avoid seeing friends or to try other rebuilding life activities, she would read her flashcard then give the activity a go.\n\nTable 4.\n\nMy Flashcard\n\nSamuel would want me to smile. He would want me to see my friends. I have discovered that although I find my feelings burdensome, no-one treats me like I am a burden. I have tiny moments of relief when I see my friends and I will build on this by trying more activities. I have not lost Jerome or my daughter, Latitia. Samuel was pure love and innocence, he meant the world to me. I take him forward when I feel love, he is a part of that, a part of me when I’m feeling loved. I take his innocence forward in my values of honesty and good-naturedness with my family, my colleagues and my friends, this value that captures Samuel is with me, a part of me.\n\nUpdating information is then brought back into the trauma memory at the point in therapy when the therapist and patient are conducting memory work. This procedure is discussed in the next section, ‘Memory updating and imagery transformation’. Here we see Jasmine’s updated memory related to the moment of Samuel’s death:\n\n‘Samuel sets off for school on his sister’s hand-me-down bike. He’s not gone two minutes when I hear a colossal screeching of brakes. I run out and he is in the road. Laying in the road! I cradle over his little body weeping, Sam, Samuel. I think paramedics arrive quickly they take me to the side and start resuscitating him, I see a paramedic’s shoulders shake and he shakes his head. The other paramedic walks over to me, head down, he puts his hand on my shoulder and says they did everything they could. The driver is questioned by the police. I am stunned, devastated, it doesn’t feel real. The police officer calls my mother. She breaks down when she arrives and we hold each other. They take Samuel’s body for a post-mortem. He is gone. Just like that. My beautiful boy gone forever. I am forever without him, alone. I am devastated. I have lost everything. I have nothing…’ [Pause, therapist prompts ‘What are you feeling, Jasmine?] ‘I feel devastated, alone, forever alone and so deeply sad.’ [Therapist prompts: ‘You’re doing a great job, Jasmine, stay with the feeling…’] ‘You feel devastated, alone, deeply sad…[pause] and when you’re ready I’d like you to bring in the new information, call to mind what we know now.’\n\n‘… I now know I’m not alone. I know that Jerome and Latitia are healthy, they are safe, they are with me, they need me. I have not lost them. I have a beautiful photo of them on my phone cuddling on our new sofa. I now know that to me, Samuel means pure love, innocence. I take him forward in the innocence I see in Jerome and Latitia, in the innocence I hear in morning birds waking the day, in the innocence of my husband when he tries to help with the cooking, carefully cutting onions but leaving the skin on … I take Samuel forward with me when I feel love, he is there a part of me, I take him forward in my innocent honesty, my values that I share with my family, my colleagues, my friends. This value that captures Samuel is with me every day, a part of me, shapes me.’\n\nImagery transformation\n\nWith traumatic bereavement, the patient often experiences distressing images of the person who died. The images may be snapshots of memories of worst moments or perceived suffering. The images maintain distress because they link meanings related to the deceased’s continued suffering (e.g. image of my wife’s face in distress when she died from a catastrophic brain haemorrhage, meaning ‘My wife is dead. She is suffering forever because of how she died’) or loss (e.g. image of my daughter’s face as her life faded away, meaning ‘I’ve lost my daughter. I’ve lost the rest of my life’) or guilt (e.g. image of my boyfriend on the road after a cardiac arrest, meaning ‘I should have known how to do CPR; he died because of me’). Such meanings are difficult to update in the context of repeated re-experiencing. The persistent images contribute to difficulties in recalling memories of the deceased before they died and as such, prevent the loss memory from being more fully integrated with other autobiographical memories from their relationship or relevant information (e.g. their pain was limited by medication; they were unconscious). When the images are in mind, patients may feel as though they are losing their loved one all over again. Transforming the distressing images can help to update the trauma memory and linked appraisals. There are six steps to transforming images of loss summarised in Fig. .\n\n1. Identify the image. The first step is to identify the image. Patients may disclose in assessment or in discussion of questionnaires, notably the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013), that they are distressed by images of their loved one suffering. This gives clues early on about images the therapist is likely to be working with in treatment. As intrusive imagery is often linked to particular moments from the trauma memory, the therapist can prompt the patient to describe the main unwanted memories that repeatedly come to mind and ask if they experience an image of any part of the memory that is distressing, vivid and recurrent. When the patient has beliefs related to their loved one’s continued suffering it is important to ask them to describe their perception of their loved one’s experience of death beyond the point of dying. Patients may experience images of worst fears, such as their loved one being buried sentient and aware, which did not happen. We strongly recommend that the therapist ask how distressing the image is on a scale of 0 (low) to 100 (very distressing) and how ‘now’ it feels from 0 (like a memory from the past) to 100 (happening in the here and now).\n\n2. Elicit the meaning of the image. The next step is to elicit the worst meaning of the image. The worst meaning extends beyond the recognition that the loved one died and carries substantial emotional pain. We have found that worst meanings linked to images of suffering usually relate to perceptions of pain that were perceived to be undeserved or preventable, of their loved one feeling deserted or of their loved one’s fear of dying or of perceived suffering as continuing in the present, or responsibility for failing to prevent suffering, including not being with the loved one when they died. Exploration of these meanings may require a discussion of the patient’s beliefs about an afterlife and cultural or religious norms about dying (e.g. rituals and rules that ensure a successful transition to the afterlife). Table gives examples of common meanings associated with distressing images linked to loss.\n\n3. Consider what information the patient may have now that updates the worst meaning. The third step is to work together to update the worst meanings. New information can emerge through imaginal reliving or narrative writing of the traumatic loss memory. Most often guided discovery and cognitive therapy tools can address cognitive themes (outlined in the ‘Addressing core cognitive themes’ section above) and elicit updating information. Table shows common appraisals and CT-PTSD tools to elicit new information.\n\nTable 6.\n\nWorst meaning relates toExample appraisalsCT-PTSD tools used to elicit updating informationSufferingMy loved one suffered enormously\n\nThey are still sufferingNarrative writing of the traumatic loss memory\n\nImaginal reliving\n\nPsychoeducation\n\nGuided discovery – is the suffering over now?

How can I take them forward in my actions, an image, a personal value or quality, behaviour or activity that captures their meaning?Loss of meaningI am alone now\n\nLife has no meaning\n\nI have lost everythingShift the focus.

They are still sufferingNarrative writing of the traumatic loss memory\n\nImaginal reliving\n\nGuided discovery – is the suffering over now? Would the patient agree that their loved one is no longer suffering?\n\nImagery transformation\n\nSurveys with or speak to experts\n\nBelow is an example of new information that came to light after narrative writing of the traumatic loss memory.\n\nSamira lost her sister to cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Samira had recurrent images of her sister dying alone and struggling to breathe. The worst meaning of the image was Samira’s belief that her sister suffered enormously and died alone. Imaginal reliving of the trauma had revealed that Samira’s sister was holding the bracelet Samira had given her and they’d shared over the years in her hand when she died. The nurse who telephoned Samira when her sister passed away had said she and another nurse were at her bedside when she died.\n\nIn this example, narrative writing revealed that two nurses were beside Samira’s sister when she died. The therapist helped Samira to update the worst meaning from ‘She suffered enormously and died alone’ to ‘She held my bracelet when she died, wrapping my love for her in her fingertips, captured in that bracelet. The nurses, Stella and Lizanne, were with her when she passed away. She died in the loving thoughtfulness of kind-hearted nurses with a bracelet that caught our connection. She did not die alone. She is no longer suffering.’\n\nTypically information that the loved one is no longer suffering is included in updating information. We also often include how the patient would like to take their loved one forward. This latter concept, ‘taking the loved one forward’, requires a shift in focus from ‘they are not here anymore’ to ‘how can I take them with me?’. The treatment aims to create intangible continuity: a sense of continuity of the loved one in the patient’s life in an intangible and meaningful way.\n\nThe therapist will need to explore with the patient what qualities they felt connected to when they were with their loved one. They will be encouraged to think about their loved one’s best qualities as well as their own qualities that were more alive when they enjoyed time together. Perhaps they felt more light-hearted with their loved one or perhaps more calm or safe. The therapist may ask what the relationship they shared says about their loved one as a person. Importantly, the therapist will guide the patient to discover what their loved one meant to them. Table gives questions to ask to elicit the meaning of the loved one.\n\nTable 7.\n\nWhat were the qualities you loved about them?What qualities were alive in you when you were with them?What does the loving relationship you shared say about them as a person?What did they mean to you?\n\nFor example, Faye lost her husband to cancer, which had been mis-diagnosed as stress for over a year, meaning that her husband deteriorated rapidly once properly diagnosed. Faye had recurrent images of her husband’s favourite sweater he had been wearing when the doctors told them that the diagnosis was cancer. The worst meaning of the image linked to perceptions of immense suffering coupled with beliefs that the patient couldn’t help him and therefore let him down and was now all alone.\n\nGuided discovery elicited updating information, including that what Faye loved most was her husband’s warm-heartedness. The worst meaning of the image was updated from ‘He suffered and was so vulnerable. I let him down and am all alone now’ to ‘He isn’t suffering anymore. I am here with our daughter, Tessa. We are okay. I was with him every step of the way. I held his hand, I cared for him, I loved him every minute of our relationship and through his experience with cancer and his last days here. He knew how much I loved him. Now, he is no longer suffering.’ The next step in imagery transformation would be to bring to mind an image that represents warm-heartedness, the meaning of Faye’s husband.\n\n4. Discover a new image that represents the updating information. The fourth step is to guide the patient to discover a new image that represents the updating information. For example, Samira’s new image captured the information that had been discovered with narrative writing of the trauma story. In her new image, she pictured her sister holding their bracelet with two nurses by her bedside. Faye thought that an image of sunshine would best capture the warm-heartedness of her husband.\n\n5. Transform the image to the new image. The next step is to call to mind the distressing image, hold it in mind and then to run it on to the new image. It can be helpful in this process for the patient to remind themselves of their new information as they bring the new image to mind.\n\nFor example, Samira called to mind the distressing image of her sister alone in a hospital bed, struggling to breathe. She pictured the image vividly in her mind’s eye. She reminded herself that two nurses were with her when she died and then brought to mind an image of her sister holding their bracelet with the nurses, Stella and Lizanne, overlooking her with kind eyes and gentleness as she lay in the hospital bed peaceful, no longer suffering.\n\nFaye brought to mind the distressing image of her husband’s grey sweater. She held it in mind and then pictured sunshine warming the sky and capturing the warm-hearted nature of her husband, no longer suffering.\n\nAt this point, we encourage the therapist to take distress ratings, to ask the patient how distressing the image feels to them now after they have transformed it. A drop in distress is an indication that the updating image is working and distress linked to the loss image is reducing.\n\n6. Link the image to the relevant moment in the memory (memory integration). The final step is to link the new image to the relevant moment in memory. This is often done together with the patient to update their trauma narrative. It could also be done in an imaginal reliving format. For example, Faye added the updating information and image to her trauma story in a different colour to the rest of her narrative. She wrote:\n\nMy husband, Partha, isn’t suffering anymore. I am here with our daughter, Tessa. We are okay. I was with him every step of the way. I held his hand, I cared for him, I loved him every minute of our relationship and through his experience with cancer and his last days here. He knew how much I loved him. Now, he is no longer suffering and the warmth of sunshine represents his positive, steady continuation of warm-heartedness. Northern Soul captures his upbeat, party, happy sense of self. When I feel the sun on my arm, I am connecting with the warmth of his warm-heartedness touching me, being with me, being all around me. When I listen to Northern Soul, I am connected to his happy, dancing sense of self being with me, all around me, now a part of me.\n\nSamira called the relevant worst moment in her trauma story to mind in imaginal reliving:\n\n‘The nurse calls me and says Meira has died. I picture her struggling to breathe and dying alone. I can’t imagine the pain she must have endured, the suffering. Dying alone. I am bereft, I couldn’t be there with her, to hold her, tell her again how much I love her, how grateful I am to have had her as a sister through all those tough times. I feel crushed, lost. I imagine her last moments, I see her struggling to breathe, raspy, tired, wanting to let go, all alone and in pain…\n\n… I now know that Meira was holding the bracelet I had given her that we shared over the years when she died. It was wrapped over her fingertips, our loving connection in her hands. I now know that the nurses, Stella and Lizanne, were with her when she died. She did not die alone. She died in the loving kindness of big-hearted nurses with our bracelet that caught our connection over the years. She is no longer suffering. I am picturing in my mind peaceful-looking Meira holding our bracelet with the two nurses, their gentle presence quietening her, making her feel safe, peaceful, no longer suffering.’"
