        "text": "BIG NEWS ALERT! I'm so thrilled to announce that I've joined G2 as VP of Research Insights. We are where the world goes for software, and it's going to be an epic adventure for me to be part of this team. I'll continue to be reporting on the advances of technology, especially AI. So stay tuned. Looking forward to working closely with Godard Abel, Sydney Sloan, Palmer Houchins, Dr. Chase Cunningham, Matthew Miller, Victoria E. Blackwell and Eugene \"Blue\" Bowen to name a few! Check out this video announcement featuring our CEO, Godard Abel. Link to the full press release in the fir$t c@mment. Here's an excerpt: ‚ÄúG2 has an unmatched depth and breadth of data on the world of B2B software,‚Äù said Godard Abel, CEO and co-founder of G2. ‚ÄúWith more than 2.5 million verified reviews, 90 million annual visitors researching on G2.com, and 180,000+ software products and services listed, there‚Äôs a treasure trove of insights to tap into.

When I felt I no longer knew everyone at work, the idea came to me to connect people in an atypical way. A few people have asked me about jump-starting that book club again, so... Calling all knowledge lovers! Join a unique monthly book club where we ditch the \"one book for all\" norm. Instead, come share what you're currently reading or listening to - books, podcasts, anything that sparks your curiosity! It's an informal knowledge-sharing event to inspire each other. General format - people share what they are reading/listening to for 5 mins. The group asks questions. Then the next person shares. First virtual meetup: 4/24 at 12:30 PM Central Call-in details coming the week of the club. Reserve your spot now: https://lnkd.in/giR-qSGZ #bookclub\n\nWe believe that a well-rested & balanced workforce is essential for success. üôå That's why we provide our employees with the time & support they need to prioritize their well-being. Our aligned PTOs encourage G2ers to focus on their physical, mental, and spiritual health needs. And on that note, G2 will be closed Dec. 25-Jan. 1. See how some of our global G2ers will be spending this time off!üëá #EmployeeWellness #PTO"
