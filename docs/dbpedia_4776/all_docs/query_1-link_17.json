        "text": "My research interests are in the areas of service user and carer involvement, social inclusion, citizenship based social work, social justice and the interface between social work and political conflict. I am a Fellow of The Senator George J Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice and led the 2019 research project: Voices of Social Work through the Conflict in Northern Ireland with colleagues from New York University (NYU), University College Dublin (UCD) and Queen's. This project was funded by the Northern Ireland Association of Social Workers (NIASW) and the Northern Ireland Social Care Council (NISCC).\n\nMy research publications, particularly in the field of service user involvement, have informed social work education locally, nationally and internationally. I am committed to working in partnership with service users as peer researchers and several of my publications evidence this approach. I have established strong international research links with New York, Penn State, Belmont, Alicante and Ljubljana Universities resulting in completed and ongoing research outputs.\n\nMy approach to teaching reflects a commitment to transformative and progressive pedagogy. I am particularly interested in the contribution that service users and carers can make to helping students understand the impact of political conflict. Using what I describe as a 'pedagogy of lived experience', a defining aspect of my approach to education involves partnering with service user and carer groups in teaching challenging pedagogical concepts to social work students such as social work values, international social work and political conflict. I have been recently exploring ways in which music, performance and the arts can also assist students in their understanding of difficult topics.\n\nAs a former recipient of a US-UK Fulbright All Disciplines Scholar Award 2018-19, the first in the discipline of Social Work in 50 years, I worked with Belmont University, Nashville, Tennessee, New York University Silver School of Social Work and the U.S. Council for Social Work Education to focus on ways in which service user involvement could be developed in social work education in the United States. A particular focus of my work in New York University was the involvement of 9/11 survivors in teaching social work students about the insights and knowledge they require in helping people affected by trauma. This mirrors the pedagogic research I have been involved in working with people similarly affected by the trauma of the Northern Ireland 'Troubles'. I am currently leading the research and development of a Curricular Guide for Service User Involvement in Social Work Education for the United States Council of Social Work Education. This work is due for publication in the Autumn of 2025.\n\nMy pedagogic research and teaching have also been recognised by the following Awards:\n\nUnited Kingdom National Teaching Fellowship Award (NTF), Higher Education Academy (HEA) (October, 2014).\n\nhttps://www.heacademy.ac.uk/person/joe-duffy\n\nNorthern Ireland Health and Social Care Regional Social Work Award (September, 2013)\n\nQueen’s University Teaching Award (July, 2013)\n\nQueen's University Teaching Award (June, 2017)\n\nUS-UK Fulbright All Disciplines Scholar Award (2018-19) (The first Fulbright awarded to Social Work in this Program since 1967)\n\nhttp://www.fulbright.org.uk/about-us/meet-our-fulbrighters/2018-19-us-uk-fulbright-award-grantees/2018-19-british-scholar-award-grantees\n\nSelect Publications\n\nDill, K & Duffy, J (2024) Episode 3: Service User Perspectives in Social Work Education.
