        "text": "Duffy provides quick access to your step count directly on your Apple Watch face as a complication.\n\nI was surprised to find that a steps complication wasnât included on Apple Watches out of the box. Being a veteran iOS developer, I decided to build one in my spare time. I really loved my prototype version and thought there were more people who would love it too. So I put in the extra effort to release it to the App Store for everyone! Duffy is completely free, has no ads, and is even open source so if youâre also a developer, you can help me enhance it.\n\nDuffy is a simple app, but it will probably turn into the most used app on your Apple Watch. No more opening the Activity app and scrolling around to find your steps. Itâs now available at a glance.\n\nDuffy is more than just an elegant Apple Watch complication. Use the full watch app for easy access to your steps, flights climbed and distance travelled for today and the past week. Set a daily steps goal and be notified on your watch when you reach it. The companion iPhone app provides the same access to your steps, flights and distance on a much larger, easier-to-read surface while also allowing you to dig deeper into your data to see trends and statistics over time.\n\nDuffy reads the steps, flights climbed, distance travelled, and activity energy from your iPhone and Apple Watch from the Health app (via the HealthKit API).\n\nAnon36463635464 ,\n\nBEST steps app hands down!\n\nSince getting an Apple Watch Iâve been really missing the 10k steps count and notifications. I tried lots of apps and they range from bad to worse, and all seem to have a million ads or subscriptions of like $9.99 a month.\n\nThis is the first app I found that is super clean, actually gives me a 10k steps reached notification, and doesnât have ads or a subscription! Iâm super impressed the creator was able to make it work so well despite all the Apple limitations, I canât imagine it was easy.\n\nThe only thing this app has is a tip jar if you like it. The tip amounts are also all really reasonable and personally with all the work that went into this, the fact thereâs no ads or subscriptions, and it works so well, I was more than happy to tip the max option. I encourage you if you like it to tip at least something to keep more awesome apps like this on the App Store!\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThank you so much for the kind review.\n\nAppKitten ,\n\nAwesome App thats Almost Perfect\n\nI didn't want complexity or excess. All I wanted was a simple, READABLE display on my apple watch face that showed the step count for the day so I can see it by just raising my wrist. The built in Activity app requires too much navigation. (Shame on Apple) \"Duffy\" fits this desire perfectly. It does one thing so not surprisingly it does it well. Duffy displays step count clearly, in large easy to read text directly on my watch face in whatever location I select. (I have it on the center so its the largest text possible.) I don't have to fiddle with it or trip over excess features to see what I want. 1 star off for two reasons: 1) Duffy isn't always realtime, there's often a short delay, 2) Ever so often I want the real-time count so I tap go to the screen to hit \"refresh\". It updates immediately to the most current step count but the updated count isn't immediately reflected on my watch face. Sometimes it won't synch up for several minutes after refresh... Minor issue since the delay isn't long but still. Otherwise its the best complication design for step counts (and only step counts) that I've found. Good Job!\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThank you for the review. Unfortunately the frequently of the updating and the delay is a limitation of operation system on the watch, but watchOS 3.0 was a huge improvement over 2.0. Here's hoping that Apple annouces 4.0 next week at their developer convention and it can get even better."
