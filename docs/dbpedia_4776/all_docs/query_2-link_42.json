        "text": "Preferred pronouns: She/Her\n\nMajor/Concentration: Sport and Movement Science, recreation and event management concentration\n\nMinor(s): Business, Dance\n\nHometown: Framingham, MA\n\nWhat made you choose Salem State, and what is the one thing you think a prospective student should know about our campus community?\n\nWhen I decided to return to school after a 27-year hiatus, I looked at many online options. I was accepted to Penn State, the University of Arizona, Purdue Global, Framingham State, and Lesley University. I chose SSU because of its affordability, the variety of programs, and the fantastic and compassionate assistance from Carole Rizzo. She was instrumental in guiding my son and me through the process when he started on his journey here in the fall of 2021, and she was even more supportive when I inquired about becoming a Viking.\n\nBecoming a full-time student and taking classes on campus was pivotal in my academic success and experience on campus. Students should know that SSU is a welcoming campus, and you can feel comfortable and at home. You may need to find your place and seek opportunities that suit your personality. Yet, I have not seen or experienced people treating one another differently because of external factors or personal lifestyle choices. You can be who you are! I returned to school at age 57 and will graduate at 59, and nobody treated me differently. Being the oldest person in the class, I have always felt like one of the kids (just with a little more wisdom).\n\nWhat have you enjoyed most about your experience living on campus?\n\nI lived on campus during the Spring 2024 semester because I received a Completion Grant, which Carole Rizzo was instrumental in helping me research. I commuted daily from Fall 2022 until Spring 2024, and it became exhausting. Yet, commuting, working on and off campus, and maintaining a 4.0 were just part of what I felt was the college experience. I participated in many activities like Paint Night, attending the shows on campus, staying late in O’Keefe, and doing homework to avoid the traffic on my commute back to Framingham.\n\nI went to sporting events on campus to share in the Viking spirit and show support for my fellow student-athletes. Living on campus has saved me at least a couple of years of my life from the stress and anxiety of commuting and working while maintaining academic excellence.\n\nAlso, living in the dorm was something I had never experienced, and the experience has positively impacted me emotionally and spiritually. Meeting my roommates and learning about their lives has added a personal side to the academic environment. I have also made new friends with whom I believe I will continue to be friends even after graduation despite having a 16-year to 35-year age difference.\n\nWhat are you involved in on campus? (Student groups, clubs, organizations, jobs, internships, honors, or athletic affiliations)\n\nI currently work as a contractor at the Center for International Education as a program coordinator, and that has been a huge part of my enjoyment and educational experience since Fall 2023. Having the opportunity to meet, engage with, and support students from around the world has been life-changing.\n\nI am part of the Tri Alpha Honor Society and the Tri Alpha E-board. I will be inducted into Phi Kappa Phi on May 7 and have been invited to join Phi Epsilon Kappa with an induction ceremony in the fall. I loved my internship with the DCR this past summer. I was part of the inaugural Salem State University and MA Department of Conservation and Recreation Fellowship program initiated by Professor Katharine Bloom.\n\nCan you describe the educational value and affordability you’ve experienced at Salem State University? How has the university supported your academic journey regarding quality and accessibility?\n\nThe Salem State University Financial Aid office and Sean and Carole in the Navigation Center have been instrumental in understanding and utilizing financial aid efficiently. It is important to be your advocate and ask questions about classes, majors, and how to use the various systems needed for academic success (Canvas, Navigate vs. Navigator), be curious, and take classes that interest you, challenge you, or are curious about. It is not always easy to find the information you need in one location, and it is not always a good match with your academic advisor or professor.\n\nHowever, that is going to happen in real life. We need to know how to seek out needed information, work with someone who may not be ideal, advocate for ourselves while remaining respectful and objective, and let our voices and ideas be heard. If you reach out to professors and are authentic and respectful, they are more willing to work with you. Most professors have understood that life happens and have been willing to work with me when extra time or explanation is needed.\n\nNumerous departments are available to support students academically, emotionally, and physically. It would be helpful if the information about what is available for support was easier to find and all in one place. However, if a student is willing to seek assistance and ask for it and guidance, it will be available.\n\nCould you discuss the relationships you’ve developed with faculty members at Salem State and how these relationships have influenced your learning and personal growth?\n\nI have found that most professors are real people! My older age contributes to my ease of communicating with my professors and other SSU personnel. I have also realized and experienced that if you do not ask for what you need, you are likely not to receive it.\n\nI have appreciated the relationships I have developed with my professors because they have added a personal touch to my education. Because of my connection with the professor, I have felt closer to the topic. I have formed relationships with professors and shared personal stories and life experiences, which has given them insight into my career goals. They have also been able to provide guidance and encouragement.\n\nSalem State emphasizes hands-on learning experiences. Can you share any memorable experiences where you’ve applied classroom knowledge in real-world settings through projects?\n\nDuring my internship with the DCR, I was able to experience and apply information I had learned in some of my SMS classes geared toward the study of parks and recreation and the challenges of balancing recreation and conservation. I utilized my 30 years of skincare knowledge in my final assignment for Health Illness and the Body, taught by Professor Sara Moore. My knowledge of how skincare products and ingredients are polluting our water supply and the environment expanded and became more real because of my DCR internship. The challenges and obstacles faced by various marginalized communities that were discussed in Professor Moore’s class gave me the idea to combine my existing knowledge and my newfound knowledge into a comic strip on the dangers certain cosmetic ingredients pose to our body, the ecosystem, and how certain communities of individuals are more at risk of encountering these toxic ingredients.\n\nWhat have you accomplished during your time at Salem that you are most proud of?\n\nI have accomplished a tremendous amount. However, my dream and goal for many years has been to earn a bachelor’s degree. I have done and am continuing to work and will proudly (God willing) walk across the stage on May 18 and achieve my goal. I have completed and achieved my goal while being a single mom to two amazing boys that are also in college, keeping my home up and running even with an income below the poverty level, have paid for my son's college tuition, and I did it all with grace, composure, and determination. Achieving academic success and being invited to and inducted into three honors societies is something I am incredibly proud of.\n\nDANCING AGAIN! I will be taking to the stage this spring, and I am so proud of my bravery and determination to dance again. I have danced for about 25 years, and it was my passion. here I am, finally reaching my degree with a minor in dance!! That is amazing. I was in a very bad place emotionally and financially after losing my job during the pandemic. Returning to school was something I did to make a bad situation better, prepare a better future for myself, and be an example and role model for my sons, never to give up and to keep following their dreams even when it is hard to see them.\n\nIn what ways has Salem State demonstrated its commitment to your success, both academically and personally? Can you share any specific instances where the university has gone above and beyond to support you?\n\nOnce again, Carole Rizzo has worked with me, advocated for me, and help me receive a completion grant, making my final semester doable and a joy. My boss, Lauren Prema, assistant director of Study Abroad, has been remarkably supportive in helping me obtain employment, coaching me, supporting me in my role in CIE, and encouraging me to focus on my studies. The entire team in CIE has made my experience this year remarkable and special beyond words.\n\nAs you near graduation, how do you feel Salem State has prepared you for your future career? What resources or opportunities have been particularly valuable in this regard?\n\nSalem State has given me the space to participate in designing a degree program that is appropriate for my career goals and took into consideration my previous academic and professional experiences.\n\nMy DCR internship opened my eyes to new possibilities for a career path. My time at SSU and being a part of the CIE have also given me the opportunity to work with students. I have discovered a passion and a skill for improving students' on-campus experiences, and I would love to join the university as a full-time professional.\n\nAdmittedly, I need to use career services more, and I believe the school needs to promote its services more effectively. We have wonderful resources available, and they need to be promoted.\n\nWhat are your post-graduation plans, and how do you believe your time at Salem State has equipped you for success in pursuing them?\n\nMy post-graduation plans are to return to the “real world” and be better prepared for a new career. SSU has allowed me to regain lost confidence and equipped me with passion and purpose for continuing a new career path of helping others through recreational programming opportunities or academic support.\n\nI had to make my way on this campus; nobody handed me anything. I had to seek out honor society information and advocate for myself, and I did so with pride and confidence. That is part of the “college experience” that is not taught in the classroom.\n\nThe world is our classroom, and every day, we are learning how to navigate through various situations. School is no exception. I know this because I lived in the real world and approached my time at SSU as my “job,” my career path was to excel, graduate, and continue learning."
