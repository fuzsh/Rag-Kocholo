        "text": "Transcript\n\nCharlene: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for joining another one of our live interview videos. Today I’m absolutely delighted to be joined by Karen Duffy, and she is going to be talking to us about her sarcoidosis experience. Absolutely delighted to have her join us all the way from America. So, just before we get into the video I would like to just point out a couple of things that we’ve got going on at the minute with our charity. Firstly, for those of you who did attend the Sarcoidosis Patient Day that we held with the Royal Brompton, thank you so much for attending, the event was a massive success. It was held on the 1st of April, the first day of Sarcoidosis Awareness Month, you can still watch the video back if you want to and we’ll shortly be posting some clips online, some shorter segments of some of the sessions and talks that the specialists did. This evening, we will be posting a link to the post-event survey, so we’d love to hear your feedback about how you thought the event went and really get your recommendations for what you’d like to see more of in the future; we hope to be able to make the event an annual one. So any recommendations that you have, anything more you’d like to see, we’d love to hear from you. I also want to say a massive shout out to all our fundraisers that we’ve got going on at the moment, so many of you are taking part in our Warrior Walk for Sarcoidosis Awareness Month. And we are absolutely thrilled at the amount that has been raised so far. If you are one of those people, thank you so much. And if you still want to see other ways that you can get involved, then we will be posting the link to our Sarcoidosis Awareness Month web page in the comment section. We’ve got another fundraiser coming up soon that you can get involved with, a Bake Off that we’ll be launching over the weekend and we’ve also got some new exciting things like products in the shop, so we’ve got new hoodie colours and t-shirts to choose from, a new bag design as well. Also, some Sarcoidosis Awareness Month Facebook frames that you can add to your profile pictures to spread awareness, so lots of ways to get involved. We’re really so grateful for the support that we’ve had so far this awareness month and as I said, absolutely delighted that today we get to have another video interview with someone well known that has sarcoidosis. Hearing from people like this is really helping us to spread awareness which is obviously a core goal of our charity. So without further ado, I’d like to introduce Duffy. As I said, she is an American writer. Some of you may know her more commonly by the name that she goes by, Duff. Thank you so much for joining us today, Duffy. It’s great to have you.\n\nKaren: Thank you so much. And I am so inspired with all the things that you guys are doing for my brothers and sisters who live with sarcoidosis. So thank you.\n\nCharlene: Thank you so much. It’s honestly, it’s great to have you join us. As I said, for those of you who don’t know, Duff does go by the name Duffy. And you might recognise her she was in a lot of modelling television commercials in the late 80s and she also became a video jockey for MTV in the early 1990s. Then she also went on to do some roles in film, she was in Dumber and Dumber and most recently provided the voice for Linda Otter in Fantastic Mr Fox. So it’s a really notable things there and then you’ve also gone on, alongside the TV side and the modelling and acting, also gone on to write some books as well, which we’ll come on to shortly. But besides all those fantastic achievements, the main reason that we’ve got Duff joining us today is because she has sarcoidosis. We really wanted to chat to her a bit about her experience and how she’s found living with this rare disease over the years. So, are you alright to tell us a bit, Duffy, just about how you were first diagnosed, when it happened and how you came to realise that you have sarcoidosis?\n\nKaren: Thank you for asking. I was possibly; I was probably in my late 20s when I noticed I would have this peculiar headache that would pop up. It was always the same spot; it was just right below my ear to my neck. And I was actually doing a show called TV nation, which was actually produced by BBC One, an international TV show with Michael Moore, the American political writer. And we were nominated for an Emmy Award, which is a big TV Award. And I just remember, like, oh, this is such a great night, but my neck hurts so badly. I was in LA, and I flew directly to New York and went to see my doctor who set me up with a neurologist. And like many of your clients and friends with sarcoidosis, it takes a long time to get diagnosed. And so it probably took about 18 months to two years to get a diagnosis of sarcoidosis of the central nervous system. So I’ve kind of had it, you know, in my respiratory system, in my eyes, but I would say the most dominant is in my central nervous system. And so I’ve got a granuloma, my doctor is Italian, and he says it’s the size of a mostaccioli. So between my spinal column up to my medulla, and one of the biggest issues, and I think many people understand this is that, really, there’s not a lot of visible indications to our friends and our loved ones, that we are really dealing with a heavy load. And so with me, it’s the chronic pain because the granulomas destroyed so many nerves. So that’s probably the biggest issue that I deal with. But I try to squeeze as much as I can out of every day.\n\nCharlene: Yeah I think that’s it’s a great way to live, from your point of view, as you said, trying to make the most of the situation but as you said, I think it is something that a lot of people can empathise with, because people who have sarcoidosis as you said, it’s an invisible disease. And that can make it really quite hard for friends and family to understand what you’re going through. And it can also make people feel quite lonely sometimes because they feel they’re just fighting this invisible battle, no one really understands, and it’s really hard to try and put into words when someone can’t physically see it. Did you find that with some of your friends and family? Did you have that kind of struggle at the start, I suppose of trying to convey to them what it was and how you were feeling?\n\nKaren: You know, I think the biggest I would say the biggest hurdle was kind of accepting it within my own life because I was so young. And I was on this career path. And it felt like I had built a plane by hand. And right when I was ready to take off, kind of had to put it back in the hangar and put myself back together again. So , I think I had to accept that my life was going to change. And it was interesting, you know, one of the impacts of having a chronic illness is the sense of shame or embarrassment. I was embarrassed to extract all the worry resources from my family. I was embarrassed that I didn’t want to lose all my jobs that I worked so hard for. Some people still don’t quite understand. And many people will be familiar with the saying, well, ‘but you look so good’. And I always think, well, that’s a compliment. But too many people live with chronic illness; it can be quite tedious because it shows that perhaps they don’t understand. So it’s every day I’ve been dealing with it. I mean, I’m a grizzled, old veteran of sarcoidosis. So to any young upstarts, I want you to know I’m here for you and in any way that I can be of service.\n\nCharlene: That’s great. I think it’s really reassuring for people who have just been diagnosed know that there are other people out there who both experienced the same thing and have gone on this longer journey of sarcoidosis and it’s so great to hear that you have got to the point today where you’re at that you could have found a way to live with the disease and still get the most out of everyday life and be as positive as you are. It’s very inspiring. I’m sure a lot of people will take great comfort in that fact that you’ve been able to get to that point. Am I right in thinking that after you got diagnosed, you actually did go on to train as a hospital Chaplain? Is that right? Where you kind of give support and things to people that need a chat when they are going through something like this?\n\nKaren: Yes, before I worked at MTV, back when they played music, I had been volunteering at a nursing home since I was 12 years old. And, you know, I guess we have a motto in our family that service is the rent we pay for life on Earth. And so I always felt that my service was, you know, working with the elderly. And I really enjoyed it. And when I got sick, and I figured, you know, when I get well enough, my goal, well, I had to shift. And like everyone, even just coming out of this pandemic, we’re all having to adapt and shift. And I believe that all skills are transferable. So your life doesn’t end. Your professional life doesn’t have to end, your love life. You know, I met my husband when I was actually at my most unwell. And I just feel like there’s so much we can do. And that’s what I try and focus on. I’m deeply inspired by my favourite philosopher, one of the stoics called Epictetus. And he believes we can’t control what happens; we can only control our response. And so I’ve just tried to respond with grace and with vigour and with the goal of helping others. And so far, that’s worked out.\n\nCharlene: As I said, it’s such an admirable way to approach things. And I think that obviously, clearly has such a positive impact on your outlook and things at the minute. And something that actually really resonated with me when you were saying that about how your life doesn’t stop, it just adjusts, and we see that in our community of SarcoidosisUK supporters as well. And we’ve actually got a fantastic lady, Juliet, at the minute. She’s always wanted to run a marathon and unfortunately, due to her sarcoidosis, she isn’t able to. But for Sarcoidosis Awareness Month, she has taken on her own challenge, where she’s doing 3000 metres in 30 days, which for many people that doesn’t sound like a lot, but to her, that is really such a challenge. She has to be aided by oxygen and it’s a real uphill struggle. But for her, that is such an example of adjusting to life with her sarcoidosis. And the fact that her dreams aren’t over; they’ve just been adjusted to cope with the sarcoidosis and still be able to do something incredible. So yeah, I think a lot of our supporters are going to really be able to empathise with that. We’ve had some people commenting live that are watching us and thank you so much for joining. Ali on Facebook said Duff, you are amazing for talking so openly about this. And Elizabeth also said that she agrees, the feeling of embarrassment and trying to justify her illness can be exhausting. So as I said, I think a lot of people really do completely empathise and understand where you’re coming from with that. Could you talk to us a bit then about the two books that you’ve written? So am I right in thinking you wrote one quite a few years ago? And then one more recently in 2017?\n\nKaren: Yes, I wrote a book “Model patient – my life as an incurable wise-ass,” which was really, I would say, the beginning of my, of making the adjustments to live with a chronic illness. My most recent book called “Backbone.” It’s ‘living with chronic pain without turning into one’. And then I have a new book about stoic philosophy that will be coming out in 2022. But I think what’s really interesting is that you know, the word chronic comes from the Latin Cronus, meaning time. So essentially, having a chronic illness is an illness that transcends time. Where acute comes from the Latin Accu, meaning sharp, so when you have an acute illness, there’s usually a visible injury and lasts up to about three months. Anytime from three months to the rest of your life is a chronic illness, and I felt that was kind of helpful to explain to people. Because again, sarcoidosis is somewhat in-pronounceable, and it is so rare. So I’m so grateful for everything that you are doing to get the word out.\n\nCharlene: Thank you. As I said, you’re helping us today by being a part of it. So it’s great to have you talk about your experiences. And I think it would be great as well, with the books to just put those out there to our supporters; if you do want to check out Duffy’s books, they are available on Amazon. And it’s really interesting, the way that you tackle things because you deal with sarcoidosis, and the effects of it in your books with quite a lot of wit and humour. I feel like the impression I get is that that’s how you deal with everyday life as well and just try to have that, that positive any energy residing through. Would you say that’s quite accurate?\n\nKaren: Yes, well, you know, every day I try and be of service. And listen, today is a really good day for me. And, you know, I take a lot of medicine, and I’m very compliant with what my doctors suggest for me. I wear a lidocaine patch, maybe some of your members will know, it’s a pain patch, and I was out to dinner outside before the pandemic, and I was sitting next to the cellist, Yo-Yo Ma. And he’s really charming and outgoing. And he said you know, what’s that thing on your neck? And it’s the size of a playing card. Well, you know, it’s a pain patch. It is a prescription patch for chronic pain. And he very directly said, what’s it like to live with chronic pain? And we were outside in the garden, and it was evening, and the mosquitoes were buzzing around. And it kind of had this epiphany, like when you get a mosquito bite, it itches. So you scratch it. And so when you’re scratching it, you are like trading the sensation of the itch for a low-level pain. And I think when, with me living with chronic pain, I’m always looking for low-level happiness. So always looking for a small way. One of the things I do every day is write a thank you letter. And you know, it’s not about reciprocity or starting a pen pal, but I just write a letter, you know, to some random person or somebody I know. But every day, I try and, it just, even if I can just get that one thing done. I buy postcards everywhere, and just saying thank you, I appreciate what you’re doing. Or I’m sorry, you’re going through a difficult time. And that, to me, is a low-level way of filling my life up. I feel like my head’s a giant pinata. And I’m just trying to shove it with good vibes rather than candy. Yeah, candy, too, sometimes.\n\nCharlene: A bit of both. Always good to have balance in life. Definitely, as I said, it’s that sounds like such a good outlook to have on things. Obviously you mentioned the chronic pain and you mentioned that you’re using the patch. Do you find that other medication has helped over the years? Do you think since your diagnosis, you’ve seen any change in the way that sarcoidosis is being treated? Or do you think that we’ve still got a way to go with things like that?\n\nKaren: Well, I think with organisations like SarcoidosisUK, and here in the United States, Stronger than Sarcoidosis, we’re all doing our best because it’s such a mysterious disease. It’s also an orphan disease, meaning that it feels like a lot of us have it, but you know, globally, the numbers are rising. And in the United States, because of the epidemic, it’s been frustrating to get pain medication. And the laws are somewhat unstable. And it’s something that I rely on every single day of my life for the past 25 years. I do see that in the US, doctors are recommending more Neurontin called gabapentin, it’s a generic name. And that is an anti-seizure medication, which has also been successful for pain treatment. And then in the US, CBD oil and medical marijuana. But that’s not really my thing, but I am trying CBD oil. I’m trying topical CBD, which has been great.\n\nCharlene: Yeah, I think it’s really interesting to hear from over the pond how stuff has been with you because obviously I feel like, especially in the last year, everyone has been incredibly insular. And just because of the pandemic, we’re actually just coming out of our lockdown in stages here in the UK. So a lot of our sarcoidosis community have been classed as clinically extremely vulnerable. And they’ve been shielding for the best part of the last year, which has been really, really difficult, both from the point of view of not being able to meet their consultants as regularly and then possibly not having anyone really to talk to about the changes and things that they’re experiencing. Even just down to the fact that they’re so isolated and can’t meet anyone, because being classed as vulnerable, obviously, they’re at that higher risk. So I think the pandemic in itself has brought its own bout of challenges. That’s been really, really difficult for everyone. Do you think has that really impacted you on in your side in the States? Has the pandemic had that effect on people who have underlying conditions and diseases in that way?\n\nKaren: Yes, in New York City, where I live; I’m on my family’s farm right now, but New York City also has been extremely locked down. And it’s been great to see everyone compliant. I would usually see my doctor every month, and I see him on video chats. I think it’s important to do what you love and lots of it when you deal with the stress of having a chronic illness, economic insecurity and just being so isolated. As much as morphine, Ms content, lidocaine patches, and gabapentin are the medicines I take, I find that I get great happiness from reading. So I feel like books are a big part of my therapy. Walking is a big part. And again, I can’t really keep up with my husband and son. So, you know, if you want to do cardio, you guys walk ahead, but I’m just taking it all in. In Japan, it’s called Shinrin-yoku, which translates to forest bathing. And I love that idea of just bathing in a forest. And just, you know, getting out as much as you can. And being on lockdown, two nights a week, I have a happy hour calls with different groups of friends. And that really helps. That really helps. And just trying to stay connected because this has been hard for all of us. But it’s really been challenging when you live with a chronic illness. Absolutely.\n\nCharlene: Yeah, I think as you said, it’s been so important for everyone to stay connected. And I know that things like Zoom or FaceTime, it’s become such a big part of our lives that we never even anticipated it to be. But it’s kind of been the saviour for a lot of people. Just kind of coming back to the family and friends side. We have quite a few people within our SarcoidosisUK community as well who are not personally affected themselves. They aren’t diagnosed with sarcoidosis, but they have a friend, family or loved one who has been diagnosed. And sometimes it can be quite confusing, or they don’t quite know what best to do, how to support them. Is there any advice that you think you can give to someone who wants to be there for someone who’s got sarcoidosis that they just don’t quite know how? What would you suggest in your experiences the best way to support someone?\n\nKaren: You know, with my work as a patient advocate, I find that just saying ‘I’m here if you need me’. That is really the best we can do, if you have a loved one who’s been isolated, you know, maybe helping them with the groceries. I have neuropathy and can’t carry things, and always dropping things. It’s hard to walk my dog with chronic pain. So the one thing that really helps is offering, you know, saying I’m here if you need me and you know what I’m really good at carrying in the wine that you may need this week or the groceries or walking your dog. So, you know, can I pick up your laundry? Something, something specific? A general, how do you do? But one of the things, Charlene, I think, is we often don’t know what to say. And for me, just saying, I’m here if you need me, has been really the best advice I can share.\n\nCharlene: Definitely, I think that’s the main thing, just for people to know that they have got someone, they’re not alone. And it really does make the world of difference for someone. It’s those little things, as you said stuff that if you aren’t impacted by sarcoidosis, you wouldn’t even think twice about, but for someone who is really suffering, especially experiencing common chronic pain and other symptoms like that, it can make the world of difference. Just in terms of the support as well, SarcoidosisUK do have resources to support you. We’ve got a very active Facebook group, so if you’re not already part of that, I would encourage you to join. We’ve got, I think, almost up to 6000 members now. And that’s such a community of people; as you touched on before, this disease is rare, but the community of people who do have it are so supportive and very engaged with one another. You kind of stick together more, I think when you’re small in numbers, but mighty in force, they say. So that Facebook group is available, and we’ve got another one as well for family and friends of people who have sarcoidosis. So definitely check those out if you think that those can be of help to you. We’ve had a couple more comments come in, and people are absolutely loving the interview. So thank you so much for joining us today, Duff. Dara on Facebook said ‘it’s absolutely fantastic with Neurosarcoidosis being so rare, Neurosarcoidosis patients rarely meet others who have the same type of sarcoidosis as them. And that can be quite hard having no one to identify with or use as a reference point to explain your condition. So it’s so great that you’ve been able to get the word out’. And Lorraine Duff actually said ‘hello, Karen, you are my namesake!’. So someone with the same name, there we go, a bit of an inspiration there for you. So then just in terms of going forward, what would you like to see change in the next few years with sarcoidosis, and how do you think we can raise even more awareness? Obviously, we’re a small charity, SarcoidosisUK but as I said, mighty in force. We really try and get our impact as far-reaching as possible by funding things like vital research. But what would you like to see change in the next few years in sarcoidosis awareness and getting healthcare professionals more aware of the disease and also the general public?\n\nKaren: Well, I would love to see that Stronger than Sarcoidosis and SarcoidosisUK will have a big party to celebrate the cure. But until then, I think it would be great to do more events like this, internationally. Like checking in again, because being mighty in numbers. You know, what’s interesting is we are coming up on the 20th anniversary of the 911 World Trade Centre attacks. And what’s really interesting, Charlene is that 2973 people died that day. But since then, another 20,000 have died of 911 related illnesses. And sarcoidosis is actually the number two disease that’s causing illness in first responders in workers. And there’s a comedian who’s a good pal of mine. His name is Jon Stewart. And he’s been incredible, supporting the Sarcoidosis Foundation. And I think just events like this, just you and I have having a chat. Now I can go back to my team and say, you know they’re doing great things. I love your Warrior Walk; I’m going to go support ten people after we get off on this, on their walk. I love that you’re doing a bake sale. Again, you know, it’s just every day taking a step closer. I mean, that’s what’s so incredible is just that we could just sit on our butts and just think, you know, I’m sick. I don’t feel good. But to know that you can make a small effort and it can have a huge result. I mean, I’m so grateful that you reached out for me today and just to connect with the people who were asking questions. I am so deeply honoured. And I hope I can do more. And you know, it’s hard. One of the things is I’m no longer insurable to work as an actor. And so I’ve been approved, become a producer and a writer, and I’m always trying to get the message of sarcoidosis out. I feel like that is my duty. That’s my responsibility.\n\nCharlene: Well, thank you so much, equally, Duff, it’s been absolutely incredible chatting to you today and everyone who has been watching us live, the feedback has been incredible. I think it’s, as I said, so great to have someone of your stature talk out about sarcoidosis and help raise awareness and to touch on what you said about taking those small, little steps. It really does relate back to the people who are supporting our charity at the moment; you really are the ones who are helping to make a difference. We don’t receive any government funding, so we are 100% reliant on your generous donations. And it is only through things like the donations and our incredible fundraisers and people who are willing to take those small steps together that we’re actually able to make an impact like that. And so it does really show that even though if you are doing something literally so small, as you know, making a five-pound donation or partaking in a fundraiser activity, you are really helping us reach that goal and be one step closer also, hopefully to one day finding a cure, but in the meantime, supporting people living with the disease, and being there and being that source of information as well. With rare disease, we know that sometimes the information out there is scarce, so I think it really does all come into one and play a massive part. So thank you for highlighting that as well. But I think that’s all the questions that have come in at the moment. As I said, I would absolutely love to do another one of these videos in the future with you. And I think everyone would as well. But for the time being, we’ll leave it there for today. And honestly, thank you so much, Duff, I can’t thank you enough for joining us, it’s been so great chatting to you. Thank you very much. Great to have you.\n\nKaren: Thank you, Charlene. And to all my brothers and sisters with sarcoidosis, I’m here if you need me. You can find me on social media, I think I’m @DuffyNYC, and I’m on Instagram and Twitter. I don’t really do Facebook as much, but I am going to check in and help you out and get one of those colourful hoodies because I want to spread the word."
