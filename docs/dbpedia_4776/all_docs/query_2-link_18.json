        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nCarol Ann Duffy's collection of poems 'The World's Wife challenges gender roles and perceptions of women by retelling famous historical or fictional tales from a woman's perspective. In this paper, I intend to explore power dynamics in the collection and examine how relationships can be empowering, distorting, or limiting to women. I will consider to what extent such empowering or distorting relationships suggest a subverted, disruptive, or limited control, and how either thematic choice interprets the concepts of empowerment. I am interested in how the characters in The World's Wife relate to each other, and my approach toward the selection of the poems reflects that. The selection draws from those poems which engage with the theme of despair particularly, while using a multi-faceted approach: for instance, envy may typify one character's relationship with another, while the other character may despair of the narrator's obtusely unquestioned superiority and naivety. I have also selected some of the lesser-known poems in the collection. These poems explore 'lesser' characters and suggest how the individuals in challenging relationships are perceived from a seemingly 'neutral' angle. In this context, Carol Ann Duffy seems predominantly interested in the role of power and its relationship with identity. The narrator in these poems is generally not lacking in power, but she more often than not seems despondent, envious, dispirited, or oppressed, even when she seems to exude confidence or when the reader's responses reflect these traits in the narrator. While using the terminology specific to these relationships, I will explore how it is both the source and structure of this power which causes the negative emotions. I firmly believe that Carol Ann Duffy's reconstruction of familiar tales allows her to examine the very machinations of those tales, concluding that she situates the influence of women in the community of women as the ultimate arbitrators of the power dynamics illustrating the emotional wars raging between the sexes.\n\n1.1. Background on Carol Ann Duffy\n\nCarol Ann Duffy was born in Glasgow in 1955 but moved to Stafford, England, when she was six. Duffy studied at the University of Liverpool and started to attract attention in the early 80s with books such as \"Fleshweathercock and Other Poems\" and \"Selling Manhattan\". Many of her poems reveal a fascination with, and a fresh look at, women's experiences. The World's Wife, published in 1999, was a departure for her and a critically and popularly successful one at that. Using women's pre-existing relationships to powerful and historical figures, Duffy reclaims the narrative of these influential men in her short, witty, mischievously humorous poems. By playfully speaking in a woman's voice, Duffy challenges ideas about women as objects of male musings as well as females' own assumptions of their place in the world. After World's Wife, she became Britain's first female Poet Laureate in 2009, which also garnered her even more global attention.\n\n2. Exploration of Power Dynamics in 'The World's Wife'\n\nIn this introductory chapter, I will explore the volume as a whole, focusing on the many faces of the 'wife' and the many ways in which the concept of womanhood is undermined and subverted. These are all ways in which the position of power in which a woman is placed by her traditional role as wife is called into question, and my wider thesis is that the woman's discovery of the endpoints of that power, its boundaries, contributes to an eventual redefinition and reappropriation of identity. I use the inclusive 'we' throughout because all women are seen to be desiring change and questioning received ideals and values. We might also distinguish two layers of power addressed in the poems. The first, more conventional layer, is the familiar, if often overremarked-upon, concept of the poet as \"leech-gatherer of the city's imagination,\" who will feed firsthand experience, terrible visions of the dark future of the self and the world where it has lost all power, into the common human mold of the poem so as to educate and delight future readers. The second is the specific layer of power that the traditional figure of the wife is supposed to proffer the woman - suffocating power, that makes a group of satirical feminist poems true. These are interchangeable powercapes. However, to embark on the kind of literary criticism that will show their implausibility and fragility is a difficult task. In Chapter 2, we shall look at the literary theory relative to much contemporary women's writing, and the suspicions and assumptions that feminist theory has about the influence of contemporary \"female poetry\".\n\n2.1. Gender and Power\n\nThe first order of business when investigating power dynamics in The World's Wife is to notice where different powers lie or the lack thereof. Stripped to the bone, power is the authority to rule, the ability to command, or the place of dominance in a hierarchical social context. These processes are usually affected by historical, political, or cultural factors where gender has been playing an important role for centuries. According to Susan Rutherford, gender effects, in turn, the most crucial relationships amongst men, women, society, and power. It is important that these masculinist power constructs become a topic of investigation. Carol J. Adams writes in The Sexual Politics of Meat that the succulent beauty of meat is at the center of the patriarchal, magical belief that the oppression mastered by one gives power to the other. Adams fills the gap in the contemporary meat-eating world where nobody knows why certain food is supposed to be considered masculine or even where the connection originates from. There are different levels of power present in society where people are governed, led, and instructed by discourse along lines of power, but gender bears especial attention. Duffy makes deliberate attempts to challenge conservative gender power options that build up towards a male-centered society and basically champion the power of silence in women, neither socially nor physically. Collaboration between masculinity and power depends on careful social control, as well as collaboration between these politically encoded values towards male/female dominance. Where men articulate their existence and create a male subtext, we must dismiss the female subtext as inferior, so the male dominates. Also, the media contribute to the production and broadcasting of information, which support the masculine stereotype of women. Dubious choices about representation of men frequently transform women into vastly mythologized symbols, tokens, or objects; not essential forms of humanity. Carol J. Adams says that \"women are the object of the male gaze, and that gaze is a cultural act, though linked to the patriarchal power.\" The male gaze continues to perpetuate itself in silence. Carol Ann Duffy takes on the challenge to expose the power of silence.\n\n2.2. Historical and Mythological Figures\n\nIn \"The World's Wife,\" we find poems on historical and mythological women with various degrees of power. Likewise, Robin Hunnicutt points out the relevance of many of the dilemmas that the female characters of Duffy are struggling with: \"The personal, psychological, and - perhaps equally importantly - socially political conflicts and dilemmas that are most immediately important to the suppressed figure become significant; and their significance is swollen by the long history of women's suppression that continues still in the life of any woman who chooses the conventional role of it and is embraced daily by the many women who feel they have no other viable choices. These suppressed figures are not only tragic in their delimited options but comic also in the extreme measures they must take of rebel or control or communicate\" It is the purpose of The World's Wife to fill that silence, or at least give such figures their voice and chance to express themselves. The power struggles that these women were engaged in were not heard before. 2.2.1. Medusa Three poems deal with the myth of Medusa. When The Guardian spoke with Duffy about The World's Wife, she seemed fond of the poem \"Medusa,\" yet before she could say something about it, the first question she gave herself was \"Why did you make a monster of jealousy of Medusa, the Gorgon?\" Not only the monster, she is in other poems a snob; she is the Miss Havisham in Mrs. Beast, his jailer. In the final poem she is \"a sword swallower\". These personas that Carol Ann Duffy has created are nothing of what we are used to. The first question that comes to our minds while reading \"Medusa\" is whether jealousy had driven the Medusa to become the Gorgon or whether her gaze of to stone is a punishment awarded to her by several gods. The thoughts of Nancy Chorlton convey part of the dilemma and signify the necessity of examining such poems and see what they reveal: \"The task of literary critics isn't to pronounce judgment on the merits of literature that contradicts their own sense of aesthetics. It is to pay attention to the creations in which women tell their tales. These voices will alter the way we consider language and the meanings we attach to the words we choose. They will also change our concept of power, for the voices do not emerge from a literature written entirely by and for the male power structure\" Therefore, if we are \"not viewing classical female characters as men did and hoped to present in order to instruct and influence other men about ideal behavior and societal obligations produced to maintain male power and control\" we must read between the lines, interpret them through different perspectives, so that later interpretations by male authors can be undone.\n\n3. Subversion of Traditional Power Structures\n\nDuffy's collection has been described as a convenient weapon for feminist ideologies, for subverting seemingly normalized male conquests and authority that permeate throughout the ages. One could say that the collection revolts against the \"hegemony\" of patriarchal discourse, which attempts to create a set of politically and morally correct structures. James Limburg argues in his essay, Doublespeak in the Poetry of Carol Ann Duffy, that a change in the societal position of women is long overdue, that women's \"claim for the recognition of her equality has been heard in virtually all segments of modern society, except religion and literature\". To be sure, Duffy's majority of poems will \"nudge poetic mythology off its powerful and masculine Enlightenment pedestal,\" Earle notes. This is most clear in her text, \"The Laughter of Stafford Girls' High,\" which takes up the theme of the corrupt final judgement and after-life of \"The Last Judgement\" by Michelangelo. Three of Duffy's poems, where women play the dominant role in affecting major events in history as well as religion, are: \"Queen Herod,\" \"Mrs. Tiresias,\" and \"Demeter.\" The three opposing male-dominated powers described prior. Feminists have often tried to rewrite religion in a way that empowers women; Christine Froula argues that Duffy successfully accomplishes this in her poems.\n\n3.1. Reversal of Gender Roles\n\nThe poems in Duffy's collection, The World's Wife, show an exchange of gender roles. She changes some characters into those of the opposite gender. However, she did not do so to reveal and emphasize the secondary role of those who were finally turned into females or to enjoy the absence of males. Instead, it was a strategy or a tool to create her own gender criteria. By creating male characters once more, all the qualities attributed to being strong, loved, ambitious, and boastful are restored in their characters. But once again, she uses a female for the protagonist role, making all the events happen and leading the plot towards her body. This creates a gender base for her as well. Both female and male characters are comprehensively created. By emphasizing the dominance of gender through the addition of a new identity, they both receive the espionage status quo according to Duffy.\n\n4. Impact of Power Dynamics on Relationships\n\nAnother aspect of the power relationships being described in 'The World's Wife' is the way in which subordination and dominance operate within the human relationships. The idea that people tolerate subordination, that they empower themselves with the knowledge that by their very compliance, they reserve their own power, is explicit in these poems. Relationships in which conflict seems constant, the overarching power of one partner over the other is generally blatant. For example, Salome and Samson: 'Revenge is sweet and his honeyed world fills quickly to the brim, reflecting twinkling lights.' Yet many poems suggest that while Samson may not be getting much cooperation from Delilah, he knows exactly on what side his bread is buttered. Similarly, the wife in 'Pygmalion's Bride' seems jaded in the extreme; speaking of the only worth she would catch enough breath to utter, 'The only thing I want is relief'. In other instances, the personal relationships are positioned much closer to the work in which they are involved. Mrs. Midas's sense of betrayal by her husband's transfigured relationship with power and abandonment of their own conjugal understanding hurts most because it is personal. Equally, in relationships between women, notably the mother and daughter in 'The Virgin's Memo', there is a frisson and depth of feeling in the description of their joint endeavoring to liberate the Virgin from her burden. Such contact underscores a complaisant and subtle knowingness of their relationship in the way that the daughter advises her mother to keep money taken during an armed robbery and use it to bribe a bigger well. Without prescribed roles, or those who seem to fight almost to maintain the status quo unquestionably still rely on it. The paradoxical roles of commitment and duty serve to highlight the distortion of more obviously unequal relationships. Daring, refusal of the title of wife seems insubstantial before the complex balance of enduring submission to or complicity with money and its trappings. And although having made up her mind to return the key, given the opportunity to leave, she too remains.\n\n4.1. Marriage and Love\n\nMany of Duffy's poems in The World's Wife deal with marriage and the idea of love. Love and romance are challenged and subverted in these poems in the way that the parties in the relationships feel about themselves and each other. Poems examined in this chapter which deal with marriage and love include: 'Little Red Cap', 'Mrs Lazarus', 'Queen Herod', 'Mrs Sisyphus', 'Mrs Aesop' and 'Mrs Faust'. The wife's voice provides a means for a revealing, and often shocking, view of love and marriage. The absence of gender in these poems speaks loudly in a reader's interpretation of them, testing traditional ideas of marriage and love. Some are the wives of well-known story-telling men who have agents in love and marriage, as well as the male tale characters. The wives give voice to challenging ideas concerning men; their love and desire for love causes problems which men, however, seem less in the business of identifying for themselves. The often unnoticed voice of the wife in these poetic depictions presents to outsiders a relationship, memorable and significant critiques of those party to the marriage. Duffy encourages her readers to take time from their busy lives in order to reconsider the complexities of a universally understood relationship which has come to symbolize so many different things at so many times throughout history.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we have seen in this paper that power dynamics are central to the understanding and interpretation of the poems in Carol Ann Duffy's poetry collection 'The World's Wife'. Power is expressed vertically both in terms of a Marxist power distribution between man and woman as well as in terms of a moral hierarchy between good and evil. Power is also presented in a horizontal, less abstract way, as it can be either visible or concealed. In the picture thus outlined, the central figure of this particular unequal balance is the woman, since, in everyday life, it is the woman who is socially, economically, and legally subordinate to her husband. However, in Duffy's world, she is only superficially marginalized. This is so because Carol Ann Duffy, by placing well-known myths in an everyday context, wants to show us the mechanisms, the characteristics, and, above all, the poetic, ironic, joking force of these women who are experienced in 'walking on the water'. For Duffy, humor is an ideological choice because 'having fun means positioning oneself in the face of life, interpreting and respecting the power inherent in the laughter one provokes in others'. This application of humor within these confines also serves a number of other functions. Humor is used to mock, to dislocate and, in time, to invert today's still valid stereotypes, such as that of the woman who plays a nurturing role towards their spouse by giving everything she has. Additionally, through the use of humor, the poems also offer a space where the uncontrolled and destructive side of life is explored in a way that makes ethical, instructive, vivid, and genuinely gripping texts. Finally, the purpose of preparing a portal of interpretation, certainly not unique, but practicable by everyone. In so doing, Duffy prepares the ground so that these mythical figures may sketch themselves out, heal the wounds she has suffered and, once again, as Elizabeth Woledge says in her essay 'Lost And Found, Buried And Submerged, Hidden And Secret: Secrets from the Depths of The World's Wife', become 'better and happier'."
