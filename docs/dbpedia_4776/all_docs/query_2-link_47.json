        "text": "See the Assessment section of the Dysarthria Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/care partner perspective.\n\nScreening\n\nScreening for dysarthria is pass/fail and identifies the need for further assessment. Screening may also result in referral for other examinations or services. It does not provide a diagnosis or a detailed description of the severity and characteristics of speech deficits associated with dysarthria.\n\nDysarthria Assessment\n\nAn SLP conducts the assessment of individuals with suspected dysarthria using both standardized and nonstandardized measures. See ASHA’s resource on assessment tools, techniques, and data sources for more information.\n\nThe goals of dysarthria assessment are to\n\ndescribe perceptual characteristics of the individual’s speech and relevant physiologic findings;\n\ndescribe speech subsystems affected (i.e., articulation, phonation, respiration, resonance, and prosody) and the severity of impairment for each;\n\nidentify other systems and processes that may be affected (e.g., swallowing, language, cognition); and\n\nassess the impact of the dysarthria on speech intelligibility and naturalness, communicative efficiency and effectiveness, and social participation.\n\nSee Duffy (2020) and Freed (2020) for examples of dysarthria assessment procedures.\n\nThe severity of the disorder does not necessarily determine the degree of disability. Speech-related disability will depend on the communication needs of the individual, the perceived impact of the disorder, and the comprehensibility of their speech in salient contexts.\n\nConsistent with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework (ASHA, 2016; WHO, 2001), the assessment identifies and describes\n\nimpairments in body structure and function, including underlying strengths and weaknesses in speech production and verbal/nonverbal communication;\n\nthe individual’s limitations in activity and participation, including functional status in communication, interpersonal interactions, self-care, and learning;\n\ncontextual (environmental and personal) factors that serve as barriers to, or facilitators of, successful communication and life participation; and\n\nthe impact of communication impairments on quality of life and functional limitations relative to the individual’s premorbid social roles and abilities and the impact on their community.\n\nSee Person-Centered Focus on Function: Dysarthria [PDF] for an example of assessment data consistent with the ICF.\n\nTypical Components of the Dysarthria Assessment\n\nThe assessment section below is not prescriptive; it outlines the components of a comprehensive evaluation. Some components may not be applicable in all clinical settings.\n\nCase History\n\nComponents of case history include the following:\n\nMedical diagnosis and history, including\n\netiology of dysarthria, if known;\n\nonset and course of symptoms;\n\nassociated deficits (e.g., language, cognitive communication, swallowing);\n\nmedical procedures, hospitalizations, and prior treatments and their outcomes;\n\nother medical and rehabilitation specialty referrals and interventions and their outcomes; and\n\nmedications and potential side effects/symptoms.\n\nReview of auditory, visual, motor, cognitive, language, literacy, and mental health status.\n\nEducation, vocation, cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and social determinants of health. See ASHA’s resource on social determinants of health.\n\nPatient and family report, including\n\nawareness, observations, and perspectives;\n\nperson-specific communication needs; and\n\nthe impact of the presenting problem on activities, participation, and overall quality of life.\n\nIdentification of facilitators of and barriers to communication, such as\n\nvariation in effort for speaking in different contexts (e.g., when fatigued, at different times of day, relative to medication schedule);\n\nadaptability in different communication contexts (e.g., in noisy environments, with distractions, with multiple communication partners, with unfamiliar listeners, with personal protective equipment); and\n\nemotional adaptation (e.g., not wanting to communicate due to listener perception and resulted frustration).\n\nNonspeech Examination\n\nThis is an assessment of speed, strength, range, accuracy, coordination, and steadiness of nonspeech movements as well as an assessment of the speech subsystems using objective measures, as available. The following are typically included:\n\ncompletion of a cranial nerve exam to assess facial, oral, velopharyngeal, and laryngeal function and symmetry\n\nobservation of dentition, appearance of oral mucosa, and secretion management\n\nobservation of facial and neck muscle tone—at rest and during nonspeech activities (Clark & Solomon, 2012)\n\nassessment of sustained vowel prolongation—to determine if there is adequate pulmonary support and sufficient laryngeal valving for phonation\n\nassessment of alternating motion rates and sequential motion rates or diadochokinetic rates—to judge speed and regularity of jaw, lip, and tongue movement and, to a lesser extent, articulatory precision (see Kent et al., 1987)\n\nassessment of overall body posture and breathing pattern\n\nSpeech Production\n\nA clinician uses auditory-perceptual approaches in addition to standardized assessments to evaluate speech production (Pernon et al., 2022). The type of speech sampling used in the auditory-perceptual assessment varies based on the areas that the clinician wants to evaluate. Speech sampling can include\n\nsingle-word, phrase-length, and sentence-length material of low semantic predictability that is unknown to the listener;\n\nwords that provide a sampling of most of the phonemes; and/or\n\nconnected speech (reading and/or spontaneous speech).\n\nA speech production evaluation targets the following areas:\n\nPhonation—the ability to voice phonemes using vocal fold vibrations in the larynx (Freed, 2020). Atypical vocal quality (e.g., breathy, harsh, strained) and difficulty changing loudness and pitch can indicate neuromotor damage to the phonatory system. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Voice Disorders.\n\nArticulation—a combination of appropriate timing, direction, force, speed, and placement of the articulators (Freed, 2020). The following articulation tasks can also reveal diagnostic information:\n\nStress testing—2 to 4 minutes of reading or speaking aloud to assess deterioration over time (can use spontaneous conversation, reading text aloud, or counting).\n\nRepetition of simple and complex multisyllabic words and sentences—to determine if apraxia of speech (AOS) is present and assess motor speech planning or programming. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Acquired Apraxia of Speech.\n\nProsody—use of variations in pitch, loudness, and duration to convey emotion, emphasis, and linguistic information (e.g., meaning, sentence type, syntactic boundaries); speech naturalness reflects prosodic adequacy. Targeted prosodic tasks include asking and answering questions, contrastive stress tasks, and reading statements using prosodic variation to express different emotions.\n\nSpeech intelligibility—the degree to which the listener (familiar or unfamiliar) understands the individual’s speech signal. Intelligibility and comprehensibility are typically reported as a percentage of words correctly identified by a listener.\n\nComprehensibility—the degree to which the listener understands the spoken message, given other information or cues (e.g., topic, semantic context, gestures, facial expressions) to enhance communication. The speaker’s use of comprehensibility strategies or the stimulability/potential to adopt these strategies can also be assessed during these tasks.\n\nEfficiency—the rate at which intelligible or comprehensible speech is communicated, typically reported as the number of intelligible or comprehensible words per minute. Sentences are transcribed by a rater, and the number of correct words per minute is computed.\n\nAdditional areas of assessment may include the following:\n\nLanguage—assess receptive and expressive language skills in oral and written modalities to help distinguish between dysarthria and aphasia. All languages that the individual speaks should be assessed. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Aphasia.\n\nCognitive-communication—identify aspects of verbal or nonverbal communication that may be affected by disruptions in cognition (e.g., attention, memory, organization, executive function, level of alertness). See ASHA’s resources on cognitive-communication.\n\nSwallowing—assess swallowing function. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Adult Dysphagia.\n\nFluency—assess for stuttering and cluttering. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Fluency Disorders.\n\nAssessment may result in the following outcomes:\n\nDiagnosis of dysarthria and classification of dysarthria type.\n\nClinical description of the dominant auditory-perceptual speech characteristics and the severity of the disorder.\n\nPresence of comorbid conditions, including AOS, aphasia, cognitive-communication disorder, or swallowing disorder.\n\nStatement of prognosis and recommendations for intervention related to overall communication adequacy.\n\nDevelopment of an intervention or management plan (in collaboration with the patient, care partner, and rehabilitation team), including augmentative and alternative communication, as appropriate. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Augmentative and Alternative Communication.\n\nIdentification of relevant follow-up services, including support for individuals with dysarthria.\n\nReferral to other professionals as needed, such as a prosthodontist for palatal lift candidacy, a neurologist for diagnosis of an underlying etiology, a surgeon for implanting a diaphragmatic pacer, or a physical therapist or an occupational therapist for seating and positioning.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n\nCharacteristic AOS Dysarthria Aphasia Muscle weakness No Yes No Articulatory deficits Yes Yes No Prosodic deficits Yes Yes No Language processing deficits No No Yes Consistent error patterns* No Yes No Groping for articulatory postures Yes No No\n\n*See the Distinguishing Dysarthria From AOS and Distinguishing Dysarthria From Aphasia sections below for further details.\n\nPlease note that the chart above does not capture all the nuances of differential diagnosis of dysarthria. The information below may further clarify this subject.\n\nDifferentiating Among Dysarthria Types\n\nGiven the overlap in speech characteristics and other deficits across the dysarthrias, it may be difficult to determine dysarthria type (Fonville et al., 2008; Van der Graaff et al., 2009; Zyski & Weisiger, 1987). However, accurate differentiation supports treatment planning and can assist in the physician and medical team’s efforts to determine an underlying diagnosis if it is not known. See Distinguishing Perceptual Characteristics and Physiologic Findings by Dysarthria Type.\n\nDistinguishing Dysarthria From AOS\n\nListed below are characteristics and comparisons often used to distinguish dysarthria from AOS. Some dysarthria types (e.g., ataxic, hyperkinetic, and unilateral upper motor neuron) share some characteristics with AOS and can be difficult to distinguish (Bislick et al., 2017; Duffy, 2020).\n\nMuscle weakness or spasticity is present in several dysarthria types; AOS does not present with muscle weakness or spasticity unless there is a concomitant dysarthria.\n\nSeveral subsystems can be affected in dysarthria—unlike AOS, which is predominated by articulatory and prosodic deficits.\n\nIn contrast to AOS, dysarthric speech may present with more consistent error patterns and is generally not influenced by automaticity of speech production, stimulus modality, and linguistic variables (Duffy, 2020).\n\nOther apraxic speech characteristics, such as a larger variety of articulatory errors and groping for articulatory postures, are typically not seen in dysarthria.\n\nPoorer performance on sequential motion rates than on alternating motion rates in AOS may distinguish it from ataxic dysarthria (Duffy, 2020).\n\nFor more information about AOS, see ASHA's Practice Portal page on Acquired Apraxia of Speech.\n\nDistinguishing Dysarthria From Aphasia\n\nAphasia affects language comprehension and expression; dysarthria affects only speech production. Dysarthria can significantly compromise speech intelligibility and speech naturalness; however, delays during speech and/or attempts by the speaker to revise content might indicate language expression problems associated with aphasia. In such cases, it may be necessary to assess written language expression and oral and written language comprehension to make a definitive diagnosis. If deficits are found in these modalities, it is likely that language problems are contributing to verbal expression difficulties (Duffy, 2020). For more information about aphasia, see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Aphasia.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Factors\n\nWhen selecting screening and assessment tests, the SLP considers the influence of cultural and linguistic factors on the individual’s communication style and the potential impact of impairment on function. Variations in dialect and accent are taken into consideration before marking phonemes in error if they were not part of the client’s repertoire or dialect prior to injury or disease.\n\nThe assessment is conducted in the language(s) used by the person with dysarthria, with the use of interpretation services as necessary. Some structural impairments may have a more significant impact on intelligibility of some languages than others (e.g., tonal languages, languages where aspiration of stops and nasality of vowels impact meaning). See ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Cultural Responsiveness; Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators; and Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology.\n\nAppropriate accommodations and modifications must be made to the testing process to reconcile cultural and linguistic variations. Comprehensive documentation includes descriptions of these accommodations and modifications. Dynamic assessment is an alternative to standardized testing, when appropriate. See ASHA’s resource on dynamic assessment.\n\nThe clinician considers how changes in resonance and respiratory support impact the ability to produce a voice that is congruent with gender and gender expression. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Gender Affirming Voice and Communication.\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Dysarthria Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/care partner perspective.\n\nTreatment is individualized to address the specific areas of need identified during assessment. It is provided in the language(s) used by the person with dysarthria—either by a bilingual SLP or with the use of trained interpreters, when necessary. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators.\n\nConsistent with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework (World Health Organization, 2001), the goal of intervention is to help the individual achieve the highest level of independent function for participation in daily living.\n\nIntervention is designed to\n\ncapitalize on strengths and address weaknesses related to underlying structures and functions that affect communication across partners, activities, and settings;\n\noptimize the retention of new motor skills by implementing principles of motor learning (Maas et al., 2008);\n\nfacilitate the individual’s activity and participation by (a) teaching new skills and compensatory strategies to the individual with dysarthria and their partner(s) and (b) incorporating augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies if appropriate; and\n\nmodify contextual factors that serve as barriers to and enhance the factors that facilitate successful communication and participation, including development and use of appropriate accommodations.\n\nSee Person-Centered Focus on Function: Dysarthria [PDF] for an example of functional goals consistent with the ICF.\n\nTreatment Approaches\n\nDysarthria treatment focuses on facilitating the efficiency, effectiveness, and naturalness of communication (Rosenbek & LaPointe, 1985; Yorkston et al., 2010) and supporting functional communication between the speaker and their listeners.\n\nRestorative interventions maximize intelligibility by addressing the function of the speech production subsystems. Restorative approaches focus on improving\n\nspeech intelligibility,\n\nprosody and naturalness, and\n\nefficiency.\n\nCompensatory interventions maximize a person’s participation in activities by addressing functional communication. Compensatory approaches focus on the following goals:\n\nImproving comprehensibility by\n\nincreasing the speaker’s use of communication strategies,\n\nimproving listener skills and capacity, and\n\naltering the communication environment.\n\nIncreasing effective use of AAC strategies (e.g., speech-generating devices, letter board).\n\nSometimes the goal of treatment is to preserve or maintain function or to slow further decline, such as when an individual has a progressive disease.\n\nConsiderations for Treatment Planning\n\nBecause dysarthria is a motor speech disorder, treatment planning considers the goal of the intervention and principles of motor learning and neuroplasticity. These principles impact how someone acquires, or learns, a motor pattern as well as how they retain and transfer those patterns (Maas et al., 2008). Principles of motor learning impact the structure of practice and feedback. Clinicians can modify practice by the amount and schedule of practice time and the variability and complexity of the targets during practice. For example, blocked, constant practice is associated with skill acquisition, whereas random, variable practice is associated with retention and transfer (Maas et al., 2008). Feedback can be modified in its frequency and focus, moving from frequent knowledge of performance feedback (e.g., “You put your lips together”) during skill acquisition to variable knowledge of results feedback (e.g., “That was correct”) during retention and transfer. Clinicians may also incorporate principles of neuroplasticity during treatment planning, including specificity of training, repetition, intensity, and salience (Ludlow et al., 2008). Clinicians consider each of these principles, their intersection with each other, and differences in their application between nonspeech and speech tasks when choosing interventions, selecting targets, and recommending dosage.\n\nIndividual client factors that may influence motor learning include\n\nthe severity of the underlying subsystem impairment;\n\nthe natural history and prognosis of the underlying neurologic disorder;\n\nthe presence and severity of co-occurring conditions (e.g., aphasia, cognitive impairment, apraxia of speech);\n\nresponse to cueing, accuracy, and capacity to modify motor performance; and\n\npatient and care partner preferences and opportunities for supported practice.\n\nIt can be important to consider the sequence of targeted subsystems in restorative approaches. For example, respiration and phonation are usually targeted initially, but prosthetic management of velopharyngeal dysfunction may be needed first to achieve efficient and effective breathing and phonation for speech (Duffy, 2020; Yorkston et al., 2010).\n\nSome treatments have benefits that extend to subsystems other than the one being targeted. For example, improving prosody can benefit naturalness and intelligibility (Patel, 2002; Yorkston et al., 2010), and increased loudness (vocal effort) may induce changes in articulation and resonance (Neel, 2009).\n\nAs dysarthria impacts functional communication between the individual and both familiar and unfamiliar communication partners, planning for compensatory strategies considers the individual’s level of independence in self-advocacy and ability to modify their environment. For example, a dysarthric speaker with no limitations in ambulation or the use of their hands will be able to access supportive tools such as a text-to-speech app independently, whereas someone with motor limitations may be more dependent on partner support.\n\nIndividual client factors that may influence compensatory strategies include\n\nthe presence and severity of co-occurring conditions (e.g., aphasia, cognitive-communication impairment, apraxia of speech);\n\nthe presence and severity of other motor limitations;\n\ninsight into communication limitations and capacity to repair breakdowns;\n\npatient and care partner preference and capacity for support and modification; and\n\nsocial determinants of health (see ASHA’s resource on social determinants of health).\n\nSLPs use their independent clinical judgment and the best available evidence in partnership with the client and their care partners when selecting treatment strategies. Research continues to add new understanding of the relationship between restorative strategies and compensatory strategies. ASHA members can use ASHA Evidence Maps and ASHA journals to integrate the principles of evidence-based practice and make an evidence-based clinical decision that is appropriate for their clients. Below are brief descriptions of treatment options for addressing dysarthria. This information is not prescriptive or exhaustive, and the inclusion of any specific treatment does not imply endorsement from ASHA.\n\nRestorative Treatment Approaches\n\nRestorative treatment approaches aim to restore function of the speech subsystems. The restorative treatment techniques below (e.g., Clark, 2014) might also be combined with compensatory treatment approaches. Certain treatment techniques may not be the best fit for every person with dysarthria or in all situations. Choosing the appropriate strategies will depend on the etiology of dysarthria, the differential diagnosis of dysarthria type, and the affected subsystems.\n\nRespiration\n\nPostural adjustments (e.g., sitting upright to improve breath support for speech)\n\nInspiratory muscle training to facilitate better efficiency of sustained or repeated inspirations\n\nslow and controlled inhalation and exhalation\n\ninspiratory training devices to tax the muscles beyond their typical use (i.e., overload)\n\nPhrase grouping\n\noptimal phrase length based on respiratory support and syntactic boundaries (i.e., for each breath, speak only the number of syllables that can be comfortably produced)\n\nExpiratory muscle strength training using a pressure threshold device (e.g., manometer) to overcome a preset threshold\n\nUsing maximum vowel prolongation tasks to improve duration and loudness of speech\n\nResonance\n\nVelopharyngeal exercise to overload musculature, such as resistance training during speech using continuous positive air pressure (Kim et al., 2022).\n\nVisual feedback or biofeedback (e.g., dental mirror under the nose, nasometry) during speech with progressive difficulty.\n\nSpeech pattern modification (e.g., overarticulation). See also ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Resonance Disorders.\n\nProsthetic management in collaboration with other disciplines (e.g., dentists, prosthodontists), such as\n\npalatal lift prosthesis and\n\nnasal obturator to occlude nasal airflow.\n\nPhonation\n\nLee Silverman Voice Treatment or LSVT LOUD® (LSVT Global, Inc., n.d.; Ramig et al., 2018)—an intensive program that targets high phonatory effort to improve loudness. LSVT LOUD may also influence intelligibility (Levy et al., 2020) and/or voice quality (Moya-Galé et al., 2022).\n\nPitch Limiting Voice Treatment (de Swart et al., 2003)—a program for increasing vocal loudness without increasing pitch.\n\nSPEAK OUT!® (Parkinson Voice Project, n.d.)—a standardized, comprehensive program developed for individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related movement disorders. SPEAK OUT! is based on principles of motor learning and places high emphasis on maintaining speech and communication skills. SPEAK OUT! combines individual therapy with weekly speech and singing groups, daily home practice, and education for patients and their care partners. Individuals with PD and related movement disorders are trained to “speak with intent,” converting speech from an automatic function to an intentional act. This increases patient loudness (Behrman et al., 2020; Levitt, 2014; Watts, 2016) and improves their vocal intensity, vocal quality, articulation, and intonation over time (Behrman et al., 2022; Boutsen et al., 2018, 2023). Patients may also experience improved quality of life (Behrman et al., 2022; Levitt & Walker-Batson, 2018).\n\nReduction of atypical phonatory function\n\nhypo-adduction (e.g., head turn, manual lateralization of the thyroid cartilage, surgical management)\n\nhyper-adduction (e.g., relaxation, massage)\n\nLaryngeal exercises\n\nadduction (e.g., effortful closure through cough, pulling upward on chair seat)\n\npitch glides, pitch matching\n\nCoordination of respiration and phonation\n\nincreased duration of inhalation prior to initiating speech\n\ninitiating phonation at the top of inhalation\n\nArticulation\n\nPhonetic placement to optimize the positioning of the mouth, tongue, lips, or jaw during speech\n\ndemonstration, placement cues, photos, and videos for feedback of positioning\n\nminimal contrasts to emphasize sound contrasts that differentiate one phoneme from another\n\ncomplex phonetic sequencing to emphasize coarticulatory effects (e.g., multisyllabic words with consonant blends in varying positions)\n\nExaggerated articulation (overarticulation) to emphasize phonetic placement and increase precision, sometimes called “clear speech”\n\nProsody\n\nReduced speaking rate\n\npacing strategies, including hand tapping or use of a pacing board or metronome\n\ndelayed auditory feedback\n\nindirect strategies such as increased loudness and/or overarticulation\n\nLexical stress\n\nvisual cues (e.g., hand gestures) to signal variations in loudness, pitch, or duration\n\ncontrastive stress tasks to promote naturalness and support comprehensibility, such as differentiating “night rate” from “nitrate”\n\nvarying pitch and/or loudness to repair communication breakdowns\n\nMatching breaths to natural pauses in speech\n\nCompensatory Treatment Approaches\n\nCommunication Strategies\n\nA variety of communication strategies can be used by the individual with dysarthria (speaker) and their communication partner to enhance communication when speech intelligibility or efficiency is reduced. These strategies can be used before, during, or after other treatment approaches are implemented to improve or compensate for speech deficits (e.g., Duffy, 2020).\n\nSpeaker strategies include\n\nmaintaining eye contact with the communication partner, as appropriate;\n\npreparing the communication partner by gaining their attention and introducing the topic of conversation before speaking;\n\npointing and gesturing to help convey meaning;\n\nlooking for signs regarding whether the communication partner understood the message; and\n\neffectively using conversational repair strategies (e.g., restating message in different words, using gestures to help clarify message).\n\nCommunication partner strategies include\n\nmaintaining eye contact with the speaker, as appropriate;\n\nbeing an active listener and making every effort to understand the speaker’s message;\n\nasking for clarification by asking specific questions;\n\nproviding feedback and encouragement; and\n\noptimizing the ability to hear the speaker and to see their visual communication cues (e.g., by wearing prescribed hearing aids and glasses during conversations).\n\nEnvironmental Modification\n\nEnvironmental modification involves identifying optimal parameters to enhance comprehensibility.\n\nThese parameters include\n\nreducing background noise (e.g., choose a quiet setting for conversations; turn off TV, radio, and fans);\n\nensuring that the environment has adequate lighting;\n\nreducing the distance between the speaker and their communication partner; and\n\nusing face-to-face seating for conversations.\n\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)\n\nAAC involves supplementing or replacing natural speech and/or writing.\n\nThe two forms of AAC are\n\nunaided (e.g., manual signs, gestures, and finger spelling) and\n\naided (e.g., line drawings, pictures, communication boards, tangible objects, speech-generating devices).\n\nSpeech supplementation, a form of AAC, uses additional cues to enhance the speaker’s spoken message. Supplementation strategies, which can be low-tech or computer-based, can include (Hanson et al., 2013) the following:\n\nAlphabet-based—The speaker indicates the first letter of a word on a letter board.\n\nTopic-based—The speaker indicates the topic of the spoken message using a communication display (e.g., written word, drawings, photographs) before speaking.\n\nGestural—The speaker uses an easily understood gesture with the spoken word or phrase.\n\nOther augmentative supports include voice amplifiers, artificial phonation devices (e.g., electrolarynx devices and intraoral devices), and oral prosthetics.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Augmentative and Alternative Communication.\n\nMedical/Surgical Intervention\n\nSLPs may refer the individual to a medical specialist to assess the need for medical interventions. Medical or surgical interventions may be used in combination with behavioral interventions, as needed.\n\nThese interventions can include, for example,\n\npharyngeal augmentation, pharyngeal flap, or palatal flap to treat velopharyngeal incompetency and improve resonance;\n\nlaryngeal (vocal fold) augmentation (e.g., autologous fat or collagen), laryngoplasty, or recurrent laryngeal nerve sectioning to improve phonation;\n\na diaphragmatic pacer for individuals with impaired/paralyzed diaphragm; and\n\npharmacological management to relieve symptoms of the underlying neurologic condition (e.g., spasticity, tremor) associated with an underlying neurologic disease.\n\nFactors Influencing Treatment Decisions\n\nNot all individuals with dysarthria are candidates for treatment. Factors influencing decisions about treatment include the individual’s communication needs, their motivation regarding treatment, and the presence of other deficits or conditions that can hinder communication.\n\nManagement of dysarthria related to neurodegenerative disease requires consideration of present needs and those that may arise over the course of the disease. The goal of treatment is to maximize communication at each stage of the disease, not to reverse decline (Duffy, 2020). This may include additional strategies to conserve energy and minimize fatigue, as well as initiating AAC systems and voice banking as early as possible following a diagnosis.\n\nSLPs may need to provide counseling and education to clients and their care partners about the various factors influencing treatment decisions. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Counseling for Professional Service Delivery.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Factors\n\nViews of the natural aging process and acceptance of disability vary by culture. Cultural views and preferences may not be consistent with medical approaches typically used in the U.S. health care system. It is essential that the clinician be responsive to client/patient and care partner wishes when sharing potential treatment recommendations and outcomes. Clinical interactions should be approached with cultural humility.\n\nTreatment goals should take into consideration all languages and the specific dialects spoken by the person receiving services and their different communicative environments. See ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Cultural Responsiveness, Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, and Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators.\n\nThe clinician also considers how changes in resonance and respiratory support impact the ability to produce a voice that is congruent with gender and gender expression. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Gender Affirming Voice and Communication.\n\nService Delivery\n\nSee the Service Delivery section of the Dysarthria Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/care partner perspective.\n\nIn addition to determining the optimal treatment approach for an individual with dysarthria, the clinician considers service delivery variables—such as format, provider, dosage, timing, and setting—that may have an impact on treatment outcomes.\n\nFormat refers to the structure of the treatment session (e.g., group and/or individual). Individual treatment may be most appropriate for learning new techniques and strategies. Group treatment provides opportunities to practice techniques and strategies in a naturalistic setting and to receive feedback about their effectiveness in improving comprehensibility and overall communication. Telepractice may be appropriate for some individuals with dysarthria (Tenforde et al., 2020). See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Telepractice for more information.\n\nProvider refers to the person providing the treatment (e.g., SLP, trained volunteer, family member, care partner). In addition to skilled treatment provided by the SLP, care partners and other communication partners can be trained by the SLP to provide opportunities for practice, encourage the use of strategies such as AAC, and give feedback about performance in functional settings.\n\nDosage refers to the frequency, intensity, and duration of service. Dosage may vary depending on the individual’s type and severity of disease, energy level, motivation, and degree of community support. Individuals with dysarthria may benefit from frequent and intense practice consistent with the principles of motor learning to enhance retention of speech skills (Bislick et al., 2012; Kleim & Jones, 2008; Maas et al., 2008).\n\nTiming refers to when intervention is initiated relative to the diagnosis. Early initiation of treatment may be beneficial for learning or relearning motor patterns; however, improvements in comprehensibility using communication strategies are possible at any point. Timing for introducing prosthetic management and/or AAC may vary with the setting, the individual’s preferences, and the severity and stage of disease.\n\nSetting refers to the location of treatment (e.g., home, community-based). Individuals may benefit from a naturalistic treatment environment that incorporates a variety of communication partners to facilitate generalization and carryover of skills.\n\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association.
