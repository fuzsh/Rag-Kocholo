        "text": "Marjorie Duffy represents corporations, directors, and officers in securities, shareholder, and derivative litigation in federal and state courts across the country, including in the Delaware Court of Chancery. She concentrates on litigation arising from significant corporate events, as well as on fiduciary, Caremark oversight, M&A, governance, and appraisal claims.\n\nMarjorie's representative litigation success includes obtaining dismissals of securities class actions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) and of shareholder derivative and class actions. She successfully has litigated M&A disputes, including those involving actual or alleged controlling stockholders, as well as other commercial and contractual claims. She has extensive experience with stockholder and director demands for books and records under Delaware's General Corporation Law (DGCL) Section 220 and other statutes. Named by BTI Consulting as a \"Client Service All-Star,\" Marjorie also regularly advises boards, committees, and senior management regarding corporate governance matters and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nIn 2019, Law360 selected Marjorie as one of the top six securities litigators in the country under 40 years old. Before joining Jones Day in 2008, she was a law clerk to the Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and she is admitted in New York and Ohio.\n\nMarjorie teaches at The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law through its Distinguished Practitioners in Residence Program. She is active in the community, having served on the boards of several nonprofits, and was recognized by Columbus Business First in its 2018 list of \"40 under 40\" honorees."
