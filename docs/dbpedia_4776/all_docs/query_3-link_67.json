Melissa counsels clients on day-to-day compliance operations, and she advocates daily before the U.S. government, in coordinating meetings for clients with regulators, drafting requests for regulatory guidance, preparing export and sanctions license requests, advising on rulemakings, preparing commodity classification and jurisdiction requests, counseling on tariff strategies, and investigating and preparing complex voluntary disclosures.\n\nTouted as having “a very good technical understanding of the regulations” by Chambers, Melissa is a known authority on international trade regulations, frequently sought after by leading news publications and associations. She began her legal career in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of the General Counsel, where she discovered her enthusiasm for talking with engineers. She has since developed extensive experience across the technology sector, having built deep relationships with clients in the aerospace, cybersecurity and encryption, software, autonomous vehicle, sensor and artificial intelligence, computer, telecom, satellite/spacetech, semiconductor and network infrastructure industries. Melissa also regularly counsels clients in the financial, manufacturing, consumer goods, and clean energy sectors, always attuned to applying industry norms and best practices to achieve desired results.\n\nMelissa has done significant work on pro bono matters, focusing on the representation of arts organizations and other nonprofit entities in Washington, D.C."
