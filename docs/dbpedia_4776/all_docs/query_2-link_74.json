But in any event, Corey drove George back across town to his house in St Francis Wood and dropped him off there and started to head home himself back towards, I guess, Pacific Heights where he was living. And he became aware of a car following him and he, I think made a couple of evasive turns or whatever you know, he finally, you know, he realized, yes this car was following him and he didn't really know what with the what it was about. Finally at one point, I think somewhere on the Nob Hill area top of the hill somewhere around the Fairmont hotel, Cory finally said, “alright enough of this, I'm gonna find out what's going on.” He pulled over and the car pulled behind him. I guess Corey got out of his car and he confronted two Chronicle reporters. One was a guy named Michael Taylor, the other was a reporter named Rob Hazler(?). They had been put on the Moscone-gate case whatever that was. And Corey confronted the two of them and said, “this is crazy. What are you doing? There’s nothing going on.” Whatever. And he called me after that happened, he called me and said, “did you know about this? Did you know anything about this?” And I said look, this is where I mentioned earlier that our adversarial relationship was such that we didn't let it interfere with our professional relationship and I said, “of course I knew about it, but I was going to tell you about it and, you know, I don't know what they were looking for or doing” I said but [he said], “those guys are damn lucky I didn’t have a gun with me because I was scared.” And so that's a typical kind of example of you know how George would be out at night, working the neighborhoods, meeting people. If he had other things going on that, you know, that would have been embarrassing, I'm not aware of any of what they would have been."
