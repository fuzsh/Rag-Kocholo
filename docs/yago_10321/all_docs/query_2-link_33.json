        "text": "Movie Review\n\nThirty-five years ago, in the small town of Vernon, three teenage girls were brutally murdered by a masked assailant right around Halloween.\n\nThe sheriff bungled the investigation, and the killer got away. The newspapers dubbed the masked man the “Sweet 16 Killer” since each victim was stabbed 16 times. But eventually, the people of Vernon moved on from those horrific events.\n\nWell, everyone but Pam and Blake Hughes.\n\nJamie, their daughter, doesn’t understand why her mom hates Halloween so much. OK, the killer got away. So what? And yeah, people dress up like him for the holiday. Who cares? And sure, there’s a local podcast that directs murder tours of the crime scenes. What else is new?\n\nIt’s all a bit macabre. Still, Jamie’s parents have prepared her for the worst. She’s taken self-defense lessons since she was a little girl. She takes mace and a rape alarm everywhere she goes. She even carries the protection crystal Pam got from her psychic. Surely, they can trust her to go to a concert for one evening?\n\nUnfortunately, Jamie isn’t the one they should be worried about.\n\nWhile Jamie and her dad are at the concert, someone dressed as the Sweet 16 Killer breaks into their house and murders Pam.\n\nJamie’s heartbroken. And confused.\n\nWhy would the killer return after 35 years to kill Pam? Pam was nice. Everybody liked her. Certainly, there’s nobody out there holding a grudge. Right?\n\nSo why Pam? And why now?\n\nBefore Jamie can find any answers, she’s attacked by the Sweet 16 Killer herself. And in a Back to the Future Marty McFly moment, Jamie escapes death via a nearby time machine created by her best friend, Amelia.\n\nShe travels back in time to 1987, right to the day of the first murder. Amelia had speculated that if they could stop the first crime from taking place, perhaps they could save Jamie’s mom in the future.\n\nWell, no time like the present, er, past.\n\nSexual Content\n\nTotally Killer really likes to play on the promiscuous teenager trope. Though we never see the act on screen, teens are constantly hooking up. And many of those teens are later murdered. But I digress.\n\nTeenage couples make out and grope each other in several scenes. (In a couple of cases, a teen boy grabs his own crotch to emphasize it. And a teen girl draws attention to her breasts with her hands.) One couple is caught partially disrobed. Teens sit in a hot tub without clothes (we only see them from the shoulders up). Several teenagers wear swimsuits (including bikini tops) in a pool.\n\nA young woman wears a midriff-baring shirt. Jamie is disturbed by the short length of the school-issued gym shorts she and several other girls must wear for P.E. in the ‘80s. Some teen girls talk about flashing drivers on the road. A woman reads what appears to be an erotic novel with a scantily clad man and woman on the cover.\n\nWe hear a ton of jokes about different sex acts and certain characters’ level of sexual activity. We learn about two different premarital pregnancies, including one involving teenagers (though the couples wed in both cases). And we hear a story about two middle schoolers whose braces got locked together when they kissed.\n\nJamie’s dad tells her that if he and her mom had gotten together in high school, they never would’ve lasted. So when Jamie accidentally lets it slip to a young Pam that the pair eventually weds, she finds herself trying to keep her parents’ hands off each other. (In one scene, she pushes them apart and begs, “Leave room for Jesus!”)\n\nPam, who doesn’t understand why Jamie is trying to keep her away from Blake, uses a rude term to imply that Jamie is gay. Jamie is upset by the comment not because she’s a lesbian but because it’s unkind. We hear about a girl who was bullied because her classmates thought she had had sex with the female gym coach (which was untrue). There is a gay pride flag in Jamie’s house. We learn about two men who are married and have a daughter together.\n\nJamie ogles two different guys before realizing they’re related to her. She’s upset by a shirt that reads “Federal Booby Inspector.” When a guy suggests that a girl would still be alive if she performed a certain sex act, Jamie immediately shuts that suggestion down.\n\nPolice suspect that Jamie’s mom cheated on her dad (though this turns out to be false).\n\nViolent Content\n\nThis film begins by narrating the grisly murders of three teenage girls. It tells us that these victims were each stabbed 16 times. And we see police photos of the blood-filled crime scenes (as well as wax doll replicants).\n\nFrom there, it only gets worse.\n\nSeven more deaths take place on screen. And each of these is accompanied by a gruesome fight sequence. The female victims get beaten up and tossed around like sacks of flour. One girl is thrown over a staircase, cracking her body on the steps below. Other young women have their heads slammed into various pieces of furniture. More than one victim attempts to crawl away from the Sweet 16 Killer only to be easily caught and repeatedly stabbed. (He also slices one girl’s neck open from behind and stabs a man in the head.) And the killer doesn’t mind beating the snot out of those who attempt to help his intended victims either.\n\nSpeaking of those helpers, they deal some blows of their own. The teenagers band together to punch, kick, stab, crowbar and break vases over the killer’s head. One girl even attempts to shoot him with a gun. She misses, but even if she hadn’t, it’s hard to say if it would’ve worked. Being outnumbered doesn’t deter this serial lunatic. Neither does being stabbed. He just pulls the knife out of his own back and uses it to keep stabbing others.\n\nSomeone is killed by a scythe. A woman attempts to fight off an assailant using hidden guns around her home and knives from her kitchen. A teen boy describes a video game where bad guys explode in a shower of pink dust when players kill them. Later, we see a man die in a similar manner after he’s shot in the chest multiple times with a nail gun. We hear that a teen girl died in a drunk-driving accident.\n\nA teen girl accidentally cuts her hand with a knife because she was too drunk and high to realize that it was her hand and not the food. We see several characters sporting cuts and bruises after their encounters with the Sweet 16 Killer. A woman finds her daughter bleeding on the floor after the killer attacked her.\n\nDuring an intense game of dodgeball, several girls are whacked in the face, and one loses her retainer. Another girl receives a bloody nose, but her gym coach places the blame on her for not catching the ball instead of on the overly aggressive thrower.\n\nA bully puts another teen boy in a headlock. The same bully throws a girl over his shoulder to remove her from a party. When he attempts to do so a second time, she uses self-defense to shove him into a kitchen counter.\n\nJamie notices a boy writing very violent statements (such as “shoot them all”) in a notebook. She also learns he spent time in juvie for fighting classmates. And later on, she kicks him in the face, believing he was going to hurt her. (He wasn’t, and she apologizes.)\n\nSeveral teenagers watch a movie about killer robots, and we see characters getting shot in that film. A young woman states her belief that someone should have to kill at least six victims to be considered a serial killer. (And she’s condescended for her inappropriate comments since several people still died.)\n\n[Spoiler Warning] Jamie eventually learns the Sweet 16 Killer’s motive. It turns out that Pam’s three best friends (“the Mollys” as they’re known around school) got one of their classmates drunk at a sleepover in order to find out if a nasty rumor about her was true. Distraught by their bullying, the girl left the party and attempted to drive home. But impaired by her inebriation, she crashed and died. The Sweet 16 Killer (and Jamie, too) blames the Mollys for the girl’s death and goes on his revenge killing spree. Near the end of the film, we learn of a second Sweet 16 Killer. And he justifies his own round of murders because his podcast about the original killer was losing interest. (He also kills his own father in the past because the man was allegedly more interested in his career than his son.)\n\nConclusion\n\nYou know, if Totally Killer served as the sole representation of the ‘80s, then it would be hard to believe that folks back then did anything but get high and get pregnant.\n\nJamie is shocked by the culture her parents grew up in—the casual attitude surrounding drinking and driving, the latent sexism, the incessant bullying. She tries calling some of this behavior out, to little effect. But that’s not where the film’s worst problems lie.\n\nTotally Killer is actually a very apt title considering the film is totally filled with killings. But that’s not a good thing.\n\nIf Scream and Back to the Future got together to have a child, it would be this movie. Seriously, nearly every major plot point was taken from one of those films. A masked serial killer preys upon high school aged students (and later, upon the adult survivors and their children). Jamie escapes death by climbing into a time machine and then tries to make her parents’ future better by changing their past.\n\nBut if a derivative storyline isn’t enough to keep you away, then perhaps the film’s other issues will be. Harsh language, including the f-bomb and unnecessary abuses of God’s name (paired with “d–mit”) permeate the film.\n\nThose murders I mentioned are just as gory as any other ‘80s slasher. Seriously, the Sweet 16 Killer does Halloween’s Michael Myers proud.\n\nCharacters seem to be perpetually drunk and/or high—which might explain why 1) the killer is so easily able to slay them and 2) why they can’t seem to take the guy down even when they manage to stab him.\n\nAnd finally, the nonstop sex. We never see it on screen, but a few teens are caught partially disrobed making out. Everyone seems to be hooking up with everyone else. And when they aren’t offscreen copulating, they’re onscreen talking about it in vulgar detail.\n\nIn my opinion, Totally Killer is totally lame. But even if it wasn’t, those content issues should be enough to deter all but the most ardent horror seekers."
