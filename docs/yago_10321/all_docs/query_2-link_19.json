        "text": "Carnivals and amusement parks are supposed to be places filled with laughter, thrills, and joy. However, when the lights go out, and the laughter turns into screams, these happy places can quickly transform into spine-chilling settings for some of the most memorable horror movies.\n\nSpanning seven decades from the ’60s to the present, we’re going to take a look at some of the most terrifying carnival and amusement park-themed horror films that will make you think twice before visiting your next funfair.\n\nThe Funhouse (1981)\n\nOut of every film on this list, “The Funhouse” is the only one that completely takes place at an actual carnival, almost from start to finish. Directed by Tobe Hooper, “The Funhouse” is a horror film that revolves around a group of friends who decide to spend the night in a carnival funhouse, only to become the targets of a deformed, murderous carny. This atmospheric horror film is full of suspense, gruesome deaths, and nightmarish settings.\n\nEditor’s note: For my 10th birthday in 1992, I had some school friends over for a sleep over, and my mother let us rent The Funhouse from Blockbuster. We stayed up late and watched it while eating popcorn, our eyes glued to the television anticipating each morbid murder that awaited the teenage characters. I still consider it an underrated gem in the horror genre and a flick I still refuse to let my daughters watch despite being older than i was when my mother first let me watch it. The times have changed, no doubt.\n\nFun Facts: The mask of the main antagonist, Gunther, was designed by renowned makeup artist Rick Baker, who later won multiple Academy Awards for his work in the makeup and special effects field. Under the pen name Owen West, Dean R. Koontz authored a novelization of the screenplay, which includes an abundance of backstory added by Koontz himself. Due to a post-production delay, the book was released before the movie, leading many to mistakenly believe that the film is an adaptation of the book. However, in reality, the book is based on the movie.\n\nHell Fest (2018)\n\n“Hell Fest” is a thrilling horror film directed by Gregory Plotkin, set in a macabre, horror-themed amusement park. The movie follows a group of six friends, led by Natalie (played by Amy Forsyth), who decide to attend Hell Fest, a traveling Halloween carnival filled with terrifying mazes, rides, and live performances. Unbeknownst to them, a masked serial killer known as The Other (played by Stephen Conroy) has infiltrated the park, using the chaos and scares as cover to carry out his brutal murders.\n\nAs the friends navigate the park, they slowly begin to realize the true horror unfolding around them. The lines between the park’s frightful attractions and the real-life threat become increasingly blurred, leaving the group to fight for their lives in a twisted game of cat and mouse. “Hell Fest” effectively combines the adrenaline of amusement park attractions with spine-chilling suspense, making for a thrilling and terrifying cinematic experience.\n\nFun Fact: The movie was shot at Six Flags Over Georgia during the park’s actual Halloween event, Fright Fest, with many of the park’s real employees and attractions being featured in the film.\n\nFinal Destination 3 (2006)\n\nJames Wong’s “Final Destination 3” is the third installment in the popular Final Destination franchise. The movie begins with a group of high school students enjoying an amusement park when the protagonist has a premonition of a roller coaster accident. As they cheat death, the survivors are hunted down by an unseen force, leading to a series of gruesome and inventive deaths.\n\nFun Fact: The roller coaster used in the film, named “Devil’s Flight,” was an actual roller coaster called “Corkscrew” located at Playland in Vancouver, British Columbia. As of March 2019, however, the park’s website no longer lists it as a roller coaster inside the park, and it has been sold to a buyer whose identity has not been disclosed.\n\nSomething Wicked This Way Comes (1983)\n\nBased on the novel by Ray Bradbury, “Something Wicked This Way Comes” is a dark fantasy horror film about a mysterious and sinister carnival led by the enigmatic Mr. Dark, who grants the townspeople’s deepest desires but with a terrifying cost. Directed by Jack Clayton, this movie is as haunting as it is visually stunning.\n\nFun Fact: The film’s title is taken from a line in Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,” spoken by a witch, “By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.”\n\nCarnival of Souls (1962)\n\n“Carnival of Souls,” directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic and one of the earliest examples of a carnival-themed horror film. The movie tells the story of a woman who, after surviving a car accident, is drawn to an abandoned carnival where she encounters strange apparitions and a mysterious man. The film’s eerie atmosphere and unsettling visuals make it a must-watch for fans of the horror genre.\n\nFun Facts: The movie was filmed on a budget of just $33,000, and the director, Herk Harvey, also played the creepy character known as “The Man.” The movie was also filmed in its entirety in only three weeks.\n\nHouse of 1000 Corpses (2003)\n\nRob Zombie’s directorial debut, “House of 1000 Corpses,” is a gruesome horror film that follows two couples who become trapped in a sadistic, murderous family’s home. The story unfolds near a creepy roadside attraction called Captain Spaul\n\nding’s Museum of Monsters and Madmen, which features a horrific carnival-like atmosphere. The film is filled with gory imagery, dark humor, and a truly twisted cast of characters.\n\nFun Facts: Rob Zombie initially created the character of Captain Spaulding, portrayed by Sid Haig, as a part of his stage show and later decided to incorporate him into the movie. The film also initially received an NC-17 rating, but was eventually cut to an R rating. The cut footage was never released.\n\nZombieland (2009)\n\nDirected by Ruben Fleischer, “Zombieland” is a horror-comedy that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. The film follows four survivors who band together in search of a safe haven, eventually finding themselves in an abandoned amusement park. The movie is known for its witty humor, inventive zombie kills, and the iconic Bill Murray cameo.\n\nFun Fact: The amusement park featured in the film, Pacific Playland, is actually a combination of two real-life amusement parks – Wild Adventures in Georgia and Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in California.\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Freak Show (2014)\n\nThough not a movie, “American Horror Story: Freak Show” is the fourth season of the well-recieved television series created by both Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. Set in the 1950s, the season follows the story of a traveling freak show led by Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange) and their struggle to survive in a world that despises them. This season features various carnival-themed horrors, such as Twisty the Clown and the dark history of the freak show performers.\n\nFun Fact: Sarah Paulson, who plays conjoined twins Bette and Dot Tattler, had to learn how to perform everyday actions, such as eating and drinking, with her non-dominant hand to accurately portray the sisters’ different personalities.\n\nIt: Chapter Two (2019)\n\nDirected by Andy Muschietti, “It: Chapter Two” is the sequel to the 2017 film “It” and based on Stephen King’s novel of the same name. The story follows the now-grown-up members of the Losers Club as they return to their hometown of Derry, Maine, to confront the shape-shifting entity known as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. A small portion of the film takes place at a local carnival funhouse where one of the main characters, Bill, is unsuccessful at saving a child from the hands of Pennywise the clown.\n\nFun Fact: Bill Skarsgård, who plays Pennywise, has a brother named Alexander Skarsgård. Alexander appeared in the Stephen King-inspired series “Castle Rock,” making them the first pair of siblings to both appear in Stephen King adaptations.\n\nWilly’s Wonderland (2021)\n\n“Willy’s Wonderland,” directed by Kevin Lewis, is a horror-comedy that stars Nicolas Cage as a janitor who becomes trapped in an abandoned family entertainment center. He is forced to fight off a group of possessed animatronic mascots to survive the night. This film is packed with over-the-top action, dark humor, and plenty of Cage’s signature intensity.\n\nFun Fact: Nicolas Cage’s character, known only as “The Janitor,” does not have a single line of dialogue throughout the entire film.\n\nThe Funhouse Massacre (2015)\n\nAndy Palmer’s “The Funhouse Massacre” is a horror-comedy that takes place at a haunted attraction called “Land of Illusion” on Halloween night. The film follows a group of psychopathic killers who escape from a nearby asylum and take over the haunted attraction, turning it into a real-life house of horrors. The movie is filled with gory kills, a twisted sense of humor, and plenty of genuine scares.\n\nFun Fact: The film features a cameo appearance by horror icon Robert Englund, best known for his portrayal of Freddy Krueger in the “A Nightmare on Elm Street” franchise.\n\nThe world of carnival and amusement park horror movies offers a unique blend of terror and entertainment. These films use the contrast between the fun and excitement of amusement parks and the darkness lurking beneath to create unforgettable experiences for viewers. With a mix of suspense, gruesome deaths, and sometimes even humor, these movies showcase the dark side of the places we usually associate with joy and laughter.\n\nSo, the next time you visit a funfair or amusement park, remember these chilling tales and keep an eye out for the sinister secrets that may be hiding in plain sight."
