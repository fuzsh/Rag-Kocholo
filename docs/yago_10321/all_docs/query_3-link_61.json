Regrettably, this site was a fraudulent scheme orchestrated by individuals with harmful motives and had no connection to me or Entner Consulting Group, LLC. I‚Äôve managed to temporarily address the issue with the domain name registrar. Nonetheless, if you‚Äôve divulged your private information to anyone linked with this site, I urge you to immediately place a fraud alert on your credit report and change any sensitive information you‚Äôve shared, like passwords. It‚Äôs incredibly disheartening that we‚Äôre forced to confront such threats regularly. Numerous individuals out there aim to exploit those in search of employment or other opportunities that necessitate a bit of trust. My sincere thanks go out to those who alerted me to this problem. Your assistance was vital in supplying the registrar with evidence, helping to derail this attempt at personal information theft. Please remain vigilant ‚Äî and never hesitate to reach out about matters like this, even if they don‚Äôt pertain directly to me. My support is always here for you. Additionally, for those job seekers affected by this ordeal, please feel free to comment on this post with the types of jobs you‚Äôre seeking and consider connecting with me. Times are challenging, but together, we‚Äôll persevere. #phishing #cybersecurity\n\nPretexting ? What is it ? Lets learn more about it . A social engineering tactic where an attacker creates a fabricated scenario or pretext to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as personal details, financial information, or access credentials. Security Experts Gavin Watson, Andrew Mason, and Richard Ackroyd write that most pretexts are composed of two primary elements: a character and a situation. The character is the role the scammer plays in the story. To build credibility with the potential victim, the scammer typically impersonates someone with authority over the victim, such as a boss or executive, or someone the victim is inclined to trust, such as a coworker, IT staffer or service provider. Some attackers may attempt to impersonate a targeted victim's friends or loved ones. The situation is the plot of the scammer's fake story‚Äîthe reason why the character is asking the victim to do something for them. Situations may be generic‚Äîe.g., ‚Äòyou need to update your account information‚Äîor they may be very specific, especially if the scammers are targeting a particular victim. To make their character impersonations and situations believable, threat actors typically research their character and their target online. It‚Äôs not that difficult to do. #securityawareness #cybersecurity #threatmanagement #cyberattacks\n\nPicture a scammer posing as someone you trust‚Äîa coworker, tech support, a family member, or even your bestie Jen. That's pretexting. They spin a convincing tale to extract sensitive information or access. ‚ÄúUse the following tips to ensure that you do not fall victim to a pretexting social engineering attack: Regularly review search results for your name on an Internet search engine and request to have personal information removed from any public sites. Use a trusted channel to verify the phone number or email address of an unusual message. Always be suspicious of unsolicited \"urgent\" requests. Never provide passwords, SSNs, personal/confidential information where you cannot be sure who you are talking to. Don't click on links in email, instead navigate to a trusted webpage and don't open unexpected attachments. If a company you do business with is requesting information, inform them that in order to protect yourself against identity theft, you will need to reinitiate contact with the company through a trusted channel.‚Äù Source: https://lnkd.in/eg2B9KjD #blackgirlshack #blackwomenincybersecurity #cybersecurity #infosec #diversitymatters #diversityandinclusion #womenintech\n\nCyber Crime is often seen as a bit of a black art in that how it's done is poorly understood and many assume it's a highly technical skill. And of course, there are attacks, or hacks, that are highly technical, but it starts with a very non technical process. Cyber criminals generally start with profiling your organisation and its employees. There's a lot of information out there which can be obtained with little effort or cost. Check out Company's House. They hold lots of information on you company, its board members and latest filings, providing a criminal with the names of who to target, and if your company is financially worth targeting. Social Media becomes an very important stop for the criminal. You maybe surprised at just how much information can be gained. Isn't it great when Jane from accounts payable puts up a post saying what a great company it is to work for, or perhaps puts up a selfie of her and her work mates in the accounts department, once again giving another layer of who to target for the next scam. There's a whole lot more to this, but how much better if your staff understand the imoplications of how criminals approach this and asre aware of what to look out for. Simple procedures, at no or little cost, can save money, time and reputational damage, and perhaps, your business. I never tire of saying that cyber awareness training is the most effective quick win you can take to safeguard your business from cyber crime.
