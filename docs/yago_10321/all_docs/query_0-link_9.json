        "text": "Known in Germany as \"Gern hab' ich die Fraun gekillt\" and \"Karneval der Killer\", it features the stars of the Karl May westerns that were incredibly popular in Europe in the 1960s. Lex Barker, Stewart Granger and Pierre Brice each play the leading role in one of three segments of a crime thriller anthology, filmed in Vienna, Rio and Rome.\n\nHowever; the stars never meet and we don't see too much from the three cities. It's a dull at times and fairly cheap made movie, but it's nice to see Margaret Lee, Karin Dor and Klaus Kinski in supporting roles. Personally, I came for Barker, Lee and Kinski, but Granger had the best episode and the most memorable moments.\n\nCharming trash for fans of the Euro-crime scene of the 60s."
