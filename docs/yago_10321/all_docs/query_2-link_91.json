        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nI’m going to be frank with you: I’m not much of a fair guy. Never have been really.\n\nLet’s not confuse this as misleading, though, because I do have fond memories of our local fair back home and the Mower County Fair has provided its fair share of memories as well.\n\nCould have been more had I taken up the offer to be a celebrity bull rider a few years back, but I came down firmly on the side of not really caring if the bull is a senior citizen or not — I’m not getting on a bull’s back. Ever.\n\nNevertheless, fairs have never been truly that appealing to me where two weeks out I start planning things out. The attractions and the food just aren’t that important to my own personal satisfaction.\n\nBut I do recognize the social importance of the fair, something Mower County Board President Kevin Finley reminded me of when we talked for the fair preview last week.\n\nIn a lot of ways, the fair is a reunion. A reunion for family. A reunion for friends. It’s an opportunity for those who don’t see each other that often to come together and enjoy time with each other.\n\nEven I can attest to that as I usually see a great number of people when I’m wandering about the fairgrounds. Some days I spend more time talking than I do taking pictures.\n\nAll of that being said, there are a few moments from my own life prior to writing stories about the fair that stand out.\n\nLast year, I recited the story of the fun carnival worker who gave me and a friend extra rides on the ferris wheel toward the end of the night, a truly unique experience that I’ve taken with me through the years.\n\nAnother story that stands out includes the fair as an end destination, but not so much the memory itself.\n\nIt was towards the end of fair week when I was a senior in high school in Murray County, possibly a Friday, and either I had already gone to the fair or didn’t really have an intention of going to the fair. What I do remember was that I was content to spend the night at home.\n\nIt was that golden hour where the late summer sun was lighting up the landscape in gold. With very little in the way of natural or artificial mechanisms to block the light, everything was painted in the bright light of the day.\n\nLounging about the house, I got a call from a friend of mine. Mary Jo was also apparently looking for something to do and suggested a trip to the fair in the absence of anything else to do.\n\nWeighing my options, I decided to throw in with her and in a few minutes her car had pulled up in front of the house.\n\nIf memory serves me right, and if she sees this column she can either agree or disagree, the car she drove was the a-typical teen car of the day. Old, large and possibly of a greenish color (that I definitely do not remember for sure so take that for what you will). Back in the early 90s and 80s you largely drove what you were afforded. That was either a parent’s vehicle or if you were lucky enough to have your own it was generally one of either massive girth or extended age.\n\nEither way, that car was yours and cliche or not, it was freedom.\n\nWhile Mary Jo contributed the wheels, I brought some tunes with me in the form of my boom box and my newest musical addition — Damn Yankees’ debut album.\n\nThat was one of the big albums of the day with Night Ranger’s Jack Blades, Styx bassist Tommy Shaw, Ted Nugent and drummer Michael Cartellone. On that album you found killer tracks like “High Enough,” “Coming of Age” and “Runaway.” It was one of those albums that didn’t have a bad track.\n\nFirmly entrenched in the front seat, Mary Jo put it in gear and I switched on the tunes. The fair itself must not have been that extraordinary because I don’t remember much of that. I’m sure we had fun and thoroughly enjoyed the night.\n\nWhat does stand out was the ride there. Two kids with nothing to do, talking about the unimportant topics of teenagers and listening to music.\n\nOutside of the window, the familiar landscape slid by and the sun continued to alternate its colors upon the sky as it fell closer to the horizon.\n\nIt was honestly one of those times that could be played in a coming of age movie and we already had the perfect soundtrack.\n\nSo, if you’re going to the fair, I hope you have a good time and enjoy that time with friends and family, but don’t forget the moments that seem idle or unimportant, because those are often the times you remember the most.\n\nSimple can sometimes mean more in the end."
