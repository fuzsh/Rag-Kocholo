        "text": "July 8, 2024\n\nI wanted to love this - the premise is so cool! A masked carnival worker with dark side and a troubled female lead? What's not to love?\n\nA lot apparently.\n\nAurora is supposedly some wild child who's \"all f'd up\" and been through a lot, but I don't see that at all. She comes across as a little insecure, TSTL and basic (like ok she's got dark fantasies about the guy stalking her but that's it) and Gage... Oh boy.\n\nCRINGE. CRINGE. CRINGEEEEE\n\nHe's like if you asked a teenager to write fanfiction of an edgy \"bad boy\" murderer lead. He's sadistic, kills without remorse, cares for no one and is totally obsessed with and is stalking Aurora after running into her one time. He talks in the worst cringe-inducing way, often referencing the \"voices\" or \"the darkness within him\" and \"the monster within\" for why he does what he does. There's a lot of \"howling darkness\", growling, \"dark sides\" and inner monologues and course he's stunningly handsome, tall and has blue eyes. *Of course*.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this one star is that some of the spicy bits are ok but that's all I can say.\n\nSOME HIGHLIGHTS / THOUGHTS FROM MY READING EXPERIENCE:\n\n- Dan and Charlotte are basically stereotype cardboard cutouts of friends with like no personality\n\n- Gage being misogynistic is low key gross\n\n- Why is everyone scared of Gage, bro just wears a mask and has intense blue eyes. My guy, stop telling me how scared ppl are of you, I get it\n\n- Aurora is supposed to be some super messed up troubled girl but so far she's worn ripped jeans like one time bc Charlotte told her so and she's a virgin? How exactly is she a wild child? She self harmed a few times? That's it?\n\n- Aurora creeping on a guy she just met who copped a feel because ~he's hot~ is *sigh* basic? IDK\n\n- Gauge killing a homeless person because he's\"so bad and tortured and the voices told him too\" is soooo standard \"dark romance\" cringe\n\n- Gage stalking her and doing his annoying monologue thing constantly gets old SO FAST.\n\n- I GET IT. You have an inner monster, you're so messed up, you hear voices!? How many times am I going to hear about it? like 5 times a chapter?!\n\n- Aurora is TSTL. Girlie! This man wired cameras all over your apartment, stalked you and beat your friend almost to death and you come right home and give him a show / get yourself off while he watches? Wtf? Friend of the year over here.\n\n- Aurora goes to the carnival after all that? And dresses up to proposition him? Does she have NO self preservation?\n\n- “You’re telling the truth,” I murmur, my voice rough. “A virgin, untouched by any man.” - barf!\n\n- Aurora begging him to fuck her in the dirt for her first time? Girl are u ok?\n\n- Gage calling her \"little one\" constantly gives me the ick\n\n- gun sex.... Ok? We've seen this before in the genre but it's so eh? Who is that for?\n\n- Why is this SO boring? Aurora has zero personality. I get it, you want to be roughed up in a shed by a murderer, but can I get a crumb of character development? Some sense of connection? Like aside from the fact she's not afraid of him and likes what he does it's not much of a romance, definitely some lust but other than that they barely know each other.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: DNF @ 90% This is not my thing and I got tired of cringing and rolling my eyes.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nAfter reading numerous fairytale retellings, I craved something darker, and Carnival Monster by Selena Winters certainly delivered!\n\nHere is what you can expect from this erotic horror story:\n\n- a mysterious masked hero looking for his next victim\n\n- a tempting and fearless heroine\n\n- an instant attraction with intoxicating kink\n\n- gut punching triggers\n\n- a sweet HEA\n\nI appreciated the depth of the characters and the fleshed-out storyline. If you're in the mood for a wild and thrilling escape into the darker side of romance, I recommend reading this story!\n\n✨ ... familiar darkness calls to me, promising the thrill of the hunt and the satisfaction of the kill. But her gaze holds a different promise of connection, understanding, and life beyond the shadows. - Gage✨\n\n🗣️Dual POV\n\n⚠️check out the author's website for the many trigger warnings here: https://www.selenawintersauthor.com/t...\n\n💋Safe - no cheating, no sharing, no ow/om drama, no manwhore.\n\n18 y.o. virgin h.\n\nAugust 6, 2024\n\nLoved it 🖤\n\nIt was a short read I wish it was a bit longer but I loved it. It was different from most dark romances I've read and I like that 🖤🫶🏻\n\nAugust 18, 2024\n\ni’m sorry but this was fucking garbage. couldn’t finish a 200 pg book, i only got to 54%\n\nboth the mcs are LOSERS.\n\n- there’s nothing attractive ab a man referring/calling women “bitches” or thinking he’d rape his friends gf to show him “how insane he actually is and teach him a lesson” or threatening to kill and actually planned on murdering a teenage girl.\n\n- there’s nothing attractive ab a man putting hands on a woman and body slamming her to a wall to send the women he’s stalking a message, even if tossing her too hard was an “accident”\n\n- there’s nothing attractive ab feeling aroused for a man who put hands on said woman, your BESTFRIEND btw, while visiting her in the hospital just bc he’s “coming for you” and is the man from the carnival you have feelings for after hugging one time and “coincidentally” the same person stalking you.\n\n- there’s nothing attractive ab a man who is obsessed w ur virginity/needing you to be “pure/tight.” (the way virginity was brought up was uncomfortable and to serve the man.)\n\n- there’s nothing attractive ab a man saying he’d actually kill you so you’d stop crying bc he doesn’t like it.\n\nyet, what does the fmc do when he tells her AFTER fucking her that she should stay away from him bc he was going to murder a teenager girl just to take her away from her bf if she hadn’t stopped him ?\n\nthat he’s dangerous and might possibly kill her even tho “ugh there’s something ab her that’s so different from the rest. she gets me. she’s dark, i can feel it. 😼” which is the only reason he hasn’t killed her.\n\nwho cares ? the fmc has NEVER been able to fulfill her sexual fantasies w someone before. she’s never felt this way ab someone, this is new excitement! and he’s soooo dark and “hot.” there’s just something ab him ! ♥️\n\ninstead she shows him she’s not afraid then gives him her number and basically says “he can trust her, to let her in, she’ll get it!” so what if he was going to murder an innocent girl, she knows there’s more to him and they can connect on that ! 🥺🥺\n\nLMFAOOOO FUCK OFF, i couldnt do it, they both fucking suck. specifically the mmc who needs to fucking die actually.\n\nAugust 10, 2024\n\nOf course I had to read Gages’ story after reading Carnival Nightmare ☺️ Damn those masks that show the colour of their eyes are brilliant 👀\n\nThe MCs have a connection that means they are attracted to each other like magnets, their past plays a big part in their future, meaning their darkness pulls them towards one another. Naturally, all that darkness needs an outlet and both have their own way of seeking it 🖤🔪🩸\n\nI liked this one because though it could be read as a standalone, it was nice I knew the feel of the circus 🎪\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\nOMG this was spicy and fun to read! I devoured this book in about 3 hours. It captured my attention, I loved the characters and their darkness and attraction to each other. It was just an over all good, fast paced, easy read! 4⭐\n\nAugust 3, 2024\n\nI really need to stop trusting booktok\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\n….What (and I cannot stress this enough) the hell did I just read???? I simply cannot put into words how bad this was so instead of trying to formulate a cohesive and coherent review I’m copy/ pasting from my notes app of my thoughts throughout.\n\n* feels like word vomit with little to no editing\n\n* Clearly knows nothing about psychology of psychopaths/ killers. Do some research if you’re going to publish a book maybe?\n\n* He wears the mask…. All the time? Weird\n\n* Feels like a Wattpad book written by an overly horny middle schooler\n\n* One minute she’s in the hospital with her friend that got attacked by this guy?, the next she’s jorkin it to the idea of him watching her after finding evidence of him being in her apartment\n\n* ^^^also for him to watch cause she found the cameras and set them all up for him to watch….\n\n* Bff just got out of the hospital and they’re going to have a movie night… and fmc ditches to wear a slutty costume and go find the guy that assaulted bff to get some dick (not slut shaming, we love a sexy costume, you’re just a shitty friend)\n\n* He’s got VoIces In hIs heAd\n\n* The whole chase through the woods scene was so over hyped and lasted approx 5 seconds\n\n* Noooooo she’s a post-sex crier\n\n* The pet name “little one” is making me physically ill\n\n* Soooo he’s fucks her in a nasty abandoned cabin in the woods…. Is like “oh this is a mistake, I’m not a good guy for you” and then proceeds to give her his phone number…. But also won’t take the mask off so she won’t know his identity cause he told her he kills people… but tells her his name. And gives a phone number… cool cool cool\n\n* 58% through- I feel like the only way this story can end well is if he takes his mask off, kills her, and then just moves on with the traveling carnival… so why I do I feel like this author is going to try and make them live happily every after\n\n* Aurora continuing to win worst friend ever award\n\n* A second chase through the woods… that also lasts approx 2 seconds…..\n\n* I will never understand why people immediately start cpr when people stop breathing. She’s still got a heart beat?? So why are you doing cpr????\n\n* Good lord now he’s crying\n\n* Their text conversation is killing me. It’s so bad it’s funny\n\n* So Dan is gay. Which we found out at like 70%… and now that we know he’s gay, his dialogue is SO stereotypically gay. This is horrific\n\n* “Shall we go in” “shall we get the burger?” Girl no one talks like that\n\n* So a stranger says that he’s dating your bff (who for the last week has been absolutely panicked cause someone is staking her and also another friend literally got assaulted and ended up in the hospital) and that he’s now just going to whisk her away with his traveling carnival… and yall ask almost no questions? I take it back maybe yall get the worst friend award\n\n* Kills her apparently abusive dad that we’ve never heard a thing about before. Cool cool cool\n\n* So they just live happily ever after? He no longer has the “darkness?” The voices? The urge to kill?\n\nI think this book actually gave me wrinkles from the constant look of “wtf is this”\n\nAlso how does this have like 4/5 stars??????? Have yall no taste?? I can find you better books I promise\n\nAlso, am I allowed to curse in book reviews? This book certainly had cursing so I guess it’s fine right??\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nAugust 20, 2024\n\nI can’t control the darkness. If I slip up again, I may be unable to save you.\n\nTwo troubled souls, blackened by the depravity of abusive childhoods, would find one another and instantly collide to create a light from the darkness in one another. Gage has been running with the carnival for years at it offered him the anonymous lifestyle he craved for when the darkness begins creeping in. Living off of fear and terror of his victims, listening to them beg and plead as like music to his troubled ears. One night while in Glendale, he would lock eyes with Aurora Montgomery and everything lost and broken to him would become brighter.\n\n“You don’t know what you’re asking for, do you?”\n\nTormented by her own childhood of sexual and physical abuse, she craved pain and cutting to help cure the sorrows inside. Once the two locked eyes, it was almost fated they would belong to one another. For three nights she would approach him, before engaging in rough and demanding sex. Each pushing their bodies to the limit, until Gage would take it too far and strangle her to the point of needing to be given CPR. Terrified by the aspect of losing her permanently, he wants to push her away but his blackened heart simply can't handle losing her. Convincing her she needs to leave her friends Charlotte and Dan behind, it's been merely days but she's ready to embrace life on the road within the carnival. Meeting Lily and Alice, she's amazed how quickly they also felt the draw in.\n\n“I’m going to ruin you for anyone else. I’m going to make you scream my name until you forget your own.”\n\nJuly 19, 2024\n\nrun, little one, run\n\nThoughts: love that he calls her little one! Gage is mysterious and dark, but especially dangerous. Aurora needs the dark in her life to help heal her past. Spice was SPICING! Gage is the definition of Primal!

He likes to chase and unalive. He craves it, needs it. He deleted his step father after years of being SA’d by him after his mother passed.\n\nAurora is content in her life but is haunted by her past. Her father SA’d her for years also. When her mother found out she took Aurora away. But Aurora’s darkness grew, silently. Aurora has had to hid her darkness, until she meets Gage.\n\nHe chases her and she loves it. Gage can’t believe he has found someone like her who accepts him. At first he tries to push her away because he almost unalived her, but Aurora doesn’t care. They leave with the carnival and travel around.\n\nGage finds her father and they go to delete him.\n\nJuly 26, 2024\n\nOh, no. I've found a new romance subgenre. I should hate it. I should be disgusted by it. Instead, I read this book in less than twenty-four hours. What is wrong with me? Seriously? Can someone tell me? Because this dark horror romance was not what I was expecting to read. Yet, I did. And I liked it. Ugh! I'm so disappointed in myself.\n\nThe book is trigger warning central. The author was great to put it all out there up front. She even has a list on her website of exactly every single one. If you can't do dark romances, don't bother. If you don't like horror, don't bother. This book is for a very particular type of reader. You probably already know if it's you or not just by reading the synopsis.\n\nThe only things that annoyed me a bit was the over-the-top references to THE DARKNESS. Like, dude, we get it. You're a dark individual. Now, get on with the creepy, sexy stuff. I skimmed some of the *trigger* knife play parts. It was a bit too much for me. But overall, the entertainment value was top notch. Oh, and please, please don't mess around with guns like that. Besides being extremely dangerous, there are trace chemicals like lead. You think arsenic tampons are bad. Yikes.\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nCarnival Monster\n\nSelena Winters, you never disappoint. I devoured Carnival Monster. If you are into a dark, murderous, dominate, stalker this book is for you. We quickly meet Gage in Carnival Nightmare. We get to learn about Gage's story and his obsession with Aurora, who is just as twisted as he is. They both embrace the darkness together and learn how to tear each other's walls in the most twisted and darkest ways.\n\nAurora is a strong woman who knows the monster that Gage can be and does not run from it. Instead, she stands her ground and gets her man. She fights to help Gage see what they are together and they are perfectly twisted for each other. Gage sees that Aurora loves the darkness as much as he does but is scared to hurt her. For the first time, he wants to be something other than a monster for someone.\n\nSelena's books are always ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ quality. The spice in her books are always 🥵 and the dominant MMC never fails to make the MFC scream in pleasure, mixing a bit of pain, making her and the reader want more. 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶 for the spice.\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\nThe carnivals bad boy meets his match !\n\nTwo dark twisted souls come together in this super spicy stalker/ serial killer dark romance\n\nAurora goes to the carnival with her besties only to come face to face with a 6.6 masked man who takes her breath away.\n\nGage doing his part in the haunted house goes to scare a customer only to be pinned in place by beautiful eyes who he can’t get enough of\n\nGage is far from a good boy he’s killed he’s tortured and most of all he’s stalked Aurora since the moment he met her. Aurora feeling like she’s being watched and stalked enlists her friends in helping her but what she don’t know is that Gage won’t stop at anyone not even her best buds to get her.\n\nThey both have had terrible childhoods and both have dark and depraved sexual needs which together they fulfil these needs much to the shock of eachother.\n\nLoved Aurora and Gage story, lots and lots of spice and even a HEA for these two love birds\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\nA fun dark read that I devoured in one sitting\n\nSelena is a new, to me, author who caught my eye with this yummy tail that has all my favorite things in a dark romance.\n\nGage is a carnival worker who has a very dark hobby. When he sees Aurora, it’s obsession at first sight and when he has her, he learns that he doesn’t want to give in to those urges he normally has.\n\nAurora is a young woman that is drawn to darkness. When she encounters Gage for the first time, she knows she has found what has been missing in her life.\n\nI really enjoyed this tale of mutual obsession - it was hot and twisted with an edge of suspense. Selena wrote two characters that came together by chance and changed each other’s lives forever. It was just dark enough to get my blood pumping without dipping into the pitch black side of romance. I will definitely be checking out more by this author.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nDark & Spicy\n\nPart of why I love dark romance books so much is because I love watching the way the characters evolve and grow, without magically turning into happy, mentally healthy, normal people. This one was executed perfectly, in my opinion.\n\nGage and Aurora are instantly drawn to each other, and their path towards uniting isn't conventional. The monster inside him needs to draw blood and watch fear take hold of his victims. The darkness inside her seeks danger and pain. Seeing the two collide made a great story. There were moments of healing that were written so well. As a reader, this book reminds us of the darkness in the world that even children don't get to escape.\n\nJuly 20, 2024\n\n“Carnival Monster,” by Selena Winters\n\nAurora seeks danger to cope with her trauma filled past so when the carnival comes to town she’s there. There she meets Gage, a carnie who wears a mask and scare people for fun. They are drawn to each other despite the dangers the outcome could have.\n\nShort book about a masked man who loves to kill and stalk. It is definitely dark romance coded and perfect if you love the morally black (not grey) bad guy who is the love interest. A few things in the book put me off a little, just wasn’t my style type of thing but it still was a good book. 3 out of 5 stars.\n\n-Stalking\n\n-Serial Killer\n\n-Dark Romance\n\n-Masked Man\n\nThank you for the ARC, Booksprout.\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nCarnival Monster by Selena Winters romantic thriller novel. This was definitely a twisty turn book but I love those! It was a psychological ride where both main characters have a lot of mental baggage to deal with from their past. The character development in this novel was quite interesting and there was definitely character development individual and as a couple.\n\nGage and Aurora had a very unusual relationship, one built on obsession and a traumatic past. The chemistry was full tilt. Despite all the craziness you could sense some love and goodness growing out of the relationship.\n\nDefinitely check your CWs! If you like dark romance a little on the psychological and thriller side give this one a go.\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nGage and Aurora have both been broken as children. Gage has allowed this to control his life as a monster in the darkness without a moral compass. Aurora is more able to hide the darkness within, but it is still a deep dark part of her. An encounter at the carnival has put them both on each other’s radar. The raw emotions, obsession, and fear will take a hold of you and keep you turning page after page. Then the lust, acceptance, gratification, and love will take you to the end as the two discover that the other is the missing piece that makes them whole. This story holds nothing back, it shows you there are monsters in the dark.\n\nJuly 9, 2024\n\nI would give this a 4.5 star rating. I definitely enjoyed it, even more so than Carnival Nightmare. I felt like there was more of a plot to this book and more depth to the characters. There was definitely more of a connection between the main characters as well. Me liking It could also have something to do with the fact that I have a thing for serial killers. I don’t know.🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nAs always check your trigger warnings. There are several. There is a 🌶️Spicy🌶️ gun scene and yes it’s one of the better ones I’ve read. Definitely hotter than anything you will find in Haunting Adeline and I will never look at a Ferris Wheel the same way again.🥵\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nI enjoyed this book, it was a pretty quick read with plenty of spice. It isn’t particularly plot-heavy, it focuses on the spice and shock factor in that. The two characters both have terrible pasts and find solace in each other, each completely accepting the other and all their demons. The FMC looks for thrill and fear to make her feel alive, and the MMC gives into all her twisted desires easily because he’s just as messed up. Are all the things they do things I’d want to do? No lol. But I can step out of reality and enjoy the story. I got an arc copy and am leaving the review of my own volition.\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nGage (H), a carnival worker with a violent past, becomes obsessed with Aurora after a fateful encounter at the carnival's haunted house.

Ultra-hot and steamy dark stalker romance, about finding wholeness in shared darkness through a unique, non-conventional bond. Plenty of heat in this one. including stalking, blood play, gun play, primal play, breath play, knife play, bondage, CNC, and more.\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nI loved this from start to finish. It’s so dark and spicy, with well thought out characters. I loved following their growth, individually and together as the story developed. If you’re a fan of Haunting Adeline then this will definitely tickle your fancy! As a dark romance any triggers should be taken seriously as there are some hard hitting topics discussed. I thoroughly enjoyed how it explored truly embracing your dark desires and the true beauty to be found in doing so.\n\nCannot wait to read more from this author and have already made a start on Cade and Lilys story!\n\nJuly 26, 2024\n\nIf you want something dark, look no further! This author has quickly became one of my favorites this year. Gage is totally morally black and when he finds Aurora an obsession forms and he isn't about to let her go. Aurora is very curious about the masked man with the piercing eyes. She knows she has a dark side in there somewhere and wants to see where things will go....it's a crazy, unhinged ride! Please make sure to check your triggers. There are alot of triggers and kinks in this book that isn't for everyone.\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nHalloween carnivals and unhinged psychos\n\nSelena Winters can write the most unhinged psychos with a laundry list of depravities under their belt, but you will still find yourself rooting for them by the end.\n\nGage is the killer carnie with a past that made him into a monster.\n\nAurora had a similar traumatic past, but now she finds herself feeling as if she's missing something.\n\nThey meet by chance at the carnival and soon they realize that they could be each other's answer to what they've been missing. The other half of each others soul.\n\nAugust 9, 2024\n\n3.5⭐️ but I couldn’t round down.\n\nI mean, this book had its moments. The romance aspect was unhinged and psychotic, but it worked for them. They were each the person the other needed. Which was sweet in its own twisted way. The cover was hot. Gage was hotttt. The smut was hotttttttt! But, it seemed extremely repetitive at times, which is often a thing in dual POV, but here, the same words were used repeatedly which made it sound even worse. The instant obsession in here seemed a little more forced than in other books. Possibly because the dialogue during their first encounter.\n\nAugust 17, 2024\n\nBinged the whole book in one sitting-\n\nI liked the characters themselves and liked the entire concept of the book itself.\n\nA lot of people keep saying they don’t understand etc but I thought it was executed well,\n\nTwo people with childhood trauma that like things a little more adventurous.\n\nIt’s not a story for everyone, I liked how the MMC kept the mask on for the story as it added to the fact he never wanted to show her his true self, when the mask did come off it was a well portrayed scene.\n\nIt’s a good story for those who crave the thrill\n\nJuly 9, 2024\n\nLove,love Gage and Aurora story and love returning to this carnival crew it was good to see a bit of Cade and Lily. Now that I have read Gage I don’t know who was more unhinged between Cade and Gage. But I what do know is that this two have their special ways in getting what they want. And for me that was just what had me so captivating in every each story, reading how far this two will go to get what they wanted.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nthe darkness makes me feel right at home\n\nThis book is dark, its rough, its almost unforgiving but its found a special place in my heart.. if you understand the need to fall into the darkness and enjoy CNC, knife play, etc then this book is for you. It’s not a long book but it’s definitely one I want in physical copy.. sick fantasy ? Maybe .. but she wouldn’t have wrote about it if she didn’t think someone would relate to it 😉"
