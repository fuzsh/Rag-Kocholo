        "text": "ABOUT\n\nLuke Charles\n\nLukas Charles Stafford is an American actor, singer, and songwriter best known for his work with Carrie Underwood, Sheldon Reynolds of Earth, Wind, and Fire, and for performing in Broadway’s production of “Home for the Holidays”.\n\nBorn and raised in small-town Anderson, Indiana, Luke began a passionate life in the midwest working summer labor jobs, playing baseball, and teaching music at an early age. Luke is the son of two middle class parents, Robert Sheldon Stafford Jr., a manufacturing plant manager, and Cathy Elaine Stafford (Putcho), a cafeteria worker and substitute teacher. A small town kid with humble, hard-working roots and big dreams; his deep love for music, film, and entertainment pushed him to move quickly.\n\nAt the age of 11, Luke picked up the saxophone and started learning musical theatre. At 18 years old, Luke graduated high school and began degrees in music, business, and theatre. During his college career, Charles took every opportunity available outside of the classroom to grow his talents.\n\nAt 19, Luke began singing gospel music, playing the piano, and music directing for Celebration Church at Arrow Heights in his hometown. At 21, Luke took his first lead music role in Cedar Point’s, “Luminosity”, Cedar Fair’s highest-grossing pop show located in Sandusky, Ohio and produced by Pepsi. At 22, Luke took his first role on screen, joining Carrie Underwood in her 2016 hit music video, “Dirty Laundry”. Starting at the top of the following year, Luke began his first domestic tour with Sheldon Reynolds of Earth, Wind, and Fire, hosted by Kalimba: The Spirit of EWF. Dreams destined for something greater, Luke finished his college degrees and moved to Los Angeles where his career expanded quickly.\n\nIn late 2017, Luke moved to New York City for his Broadway debut in \"Home for the Holidays\" playing saxophone and singing back-up for American Idol winner, Candice Glover, America’s Got Talent champion, Bianca Ryan, YouTube sensations Peter and Evynne Hollens, and The Voice champion, Josh Kauffman. Luke returned to LA in 2018, where later that year he starred in “By & By”, a film directed by Brian Lucke Anderson.\n\nIn fall of 2019, Luke made his feature film debut as Tom Hawkins in “East of Middle West”, produced by Stained Glass Productions in Los Angeles, and filmed in Iowa City, Iowa.\n\nLuke was also seen on ABC’s American Idol: Season 3 and directed/starred in “H O M E: The Christmas Story”. This fall, Charles will be seen in Captain 80’s, a mockumentary-style feature film starring rock legends Foreigner, as well as Nickelodeon stars Kira Kosarin, Amar Wooten, and Raini Wilson.\n\nStill a simple soul from the midwest, Luke’s hobbies include playing piano, leading worship music for his local communities, and riding his 2007 Harley Sportster, “Roxanne,” across the country. Luke is a certified life & fitness coach, enjoys writing, reading, long-boarding, fishing, baseball, football, and smoking a pipe whenever there’s something worth celebrating."
