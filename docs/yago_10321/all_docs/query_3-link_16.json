        "text": "ONE thing has certainly been discovered; this business of making movies from television shows is an excellent way to determine the difference between the men and the boys. And most of the television material brought to the screen has turned out pretty juvenile.\"Foreign Intrigue\" is no exception. This inspiration from a TV serial, which came yesterday to the Victoria, is a stale melodrama about a man who tries to trace the background of his mysterious employer, now deceased, in Vienna and Stockholm. It is shot through with hackneyed situations, the direction of Sheldon Reynolds is slow and dull, badly imitative of old spy-thriller techniques, and the acting is downright bad.Especially is the performance of Robert Mitchum as the self-appointed sleuth a drab, droopy-eyed demonstration of physical and mental lethargy. Mr. Mitchum, whose mental processes have never appeared overly alert, is favored, at least, in this instance, by not being overly taxed. A small child of average intelligence could make the deductions he has to make.What it boils down to simply is that Mr. Mitchum's employer has died of a heart attack in a villa on the French Riviera. The man's young wife, played by Genevieve Page, professes to know nothing of his background, but Mr. Mitchum is interested, so he goes to Vienna and Stockholm, looking lackadaisically for clues. In the latter city he finds a Scandinavian sweetie, played by Ingrid Tulean, who seems to interest him more than does the mystery and we dally with her for awhile. Then back he goes to Vienna for a showdown that is barren of surprise.Frederick O'Brady as an opposition agent with a sense of humor is occasionally a bit of fun, but the rest of the assorted gum-shoes and intelligence officers are very dull boys. There are a few scenic shots that might be handsome if the color were better than it is.Mr. Reynolds, producer of the TV series, has showed himself one of the boys with this film.\n\nFOREIGN INTRIGUE, written, produced and directed by Sheldon Reynolds; based on an original treatment by Mr. Reynolds, Harold J. Bloom and Gene Levitt; a United Artists release. At the Victoria.Bishop . . . . . Robert MitchumDominique . . . . . Genevieve PageBrita . . . . . Ingrid TuleanSpring . . . . .

Peter CopleyALTHOUGH it is more concerned with mood and motivation than with gunplay, \"The Fastest Gun Alive,\" which crashed into the Globe yesterday, emerges as an engrossing and, on occasion, a comic and tricky adventure. The production team of Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene, who sometimes obscure their story of a harassed gent trying to escape an unfounded, deadly reputation with psychological overtones, have handled some familiar Western ingredients with intelligence and dexterity.List this \"Fastest Gun\" as a sort of disturbed distant relation to the more impressive \"The Gunfighter.\" Our hero, the seemingly meek storekeeper of Cross Creek, is torn by the knowledge that he is the West's quickest on the draw and that he is afraid to try his skill against an opponent. Only his wife knows his secret until, that is, he is goaded by village braggarts into exposing himself.There are complications, of course. Chief of these is Vinnie Harold, a vicious killer and bank robber and a slightly unstrung citizen himself, who compulsively has to prove his manhood by claiming the title of \"fastest gun.\" Naturally, the word gets around and first thing a viewer knows, the craven shopkeeper and our villain are facing each other on that deserted, dusty street. Since this department has never divulged a guarded climax, suffice it to say that justice does prevail.Although it takes a mite too long to reveal the reasons for his actions, Glenn Ford's characterization of a man driven by fear and a desire for a peaceful life is both sensitive and forceful. Broderick Crawford's delineation of the snarling outlaw is tough to the point of caricature. John Dehner does a-professionally smooth and funny job as one of his callous sidekicks; Jeanne Crain adds a tender and compassionate stint as Mr. Ford's understanding wife, and Leif Erickson, Allyn Joslyn, Rhys Williams, J. M. Kerrigan, Chris Olsen, the child actor, and Russ Tamblyn, who contributes an acrobatic dance reminiscent of his chore in \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,\" weigh in with competent performances as Cross Creek's leading lights.Although its sights waver, \"The Fastest Gun Alive\" does manage to hit the target most of the time.\n\n'The Fastest Gun Alive'THE FASTEST GUN ALIVE, screen play by Frank D. Gilroy and Russell Rouse; based on the story \"The Last Notch\" by Mr. Gilroy; directed by Mr. Rouse; produced by Clarence Greene for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At the Globe Theatre.George Temple . . . . .
