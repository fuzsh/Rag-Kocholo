        "text": "If you’ve ever been stuck indoors or outdoors and driven stir crazy from lack of social interaction, these trapped movies help you feel not so alone.\n\nWhat is a Trapped Movie?\n\nA trapped movie or stuck movie is a film whose main characters find themselves stuck, stranded, or otherwise unable to escape a particular circumstance in order to return to normal life.\n\nTechnically speaking, a trapped movie can take place anywhere.\n\nWhat Criteria Did We Use?\n\nThere’s a lot to consider when reviewing the best stuck movies of all time.\n\nWe tried to be strict with the “stuck” aspect. For instance, The Running Man has a stuck portion… but half of the movie is Schwarzenegger running amok in the wild.\n\nWe even struggled with movies that DID make the list, like Predator. Because… couldn’t they just have walked out of the damn jungle? But with the threat of the Predator so pervasive, and some of the “bridge burning” moments to kind of make the characters trapped early on.\n\nSo, that’s just one aspect. Does it qualify?\n\nThen, we get into quality.\n\nWould we honestly recommend these movies? There were a LOT of bad movies that qualify for their trapped-ness, but they sucked. We wouldn’t recommend them in anyway, and will leave them unmentioned for the sake of saving you sanity.\n\nTop 28 Trapped Movies of All Time\n\nNow that the preamble is out of the way, let’s dive right in.\n\n28) The Platform\n\nThis is a disturbing movie, for the gross food aspect alone.\n\nBut in all seriousness, The Platform (El Hoyo/The Hole) is a socially provocative Spanish film that combines lots of genres.\n\nIt’s a foreign film, so it has subtitles. And sometimes thing don’t land quite right to a western sensibility, but that honestly just dovetails into making the world building more foreign.\n\nThe plot has a nice dungeon-like structure. From IMDB: “A vertical prison with one cell per level. Two people per cell. Only one food platform and two minutes per day to feed. An endless nightmare trapped in The Hole.”\n\nThere’s also just some legitimately good scenes that had us on the edge of our seats. It gets more and more intense as the levels go up, down, and so forth.\n\n27) 30 Days of Night\n\n30 Days of Night is one of those situations where source material > adaptation.\n\nThe movie is okay, but it doesn’t capture the atmosphere of the comics well enough for us. Nor the leading man. We like Josh Hartnett, we just don’t like him in this role.\n\nGo read the comic book, then watch the movie. You’ll like it better that way.\n\nRead 30 Days of Night on Amazon/Kindle/comiXology\n\nRent 30 Days of Night on Amazon\n\n26) Cube\n\nIn the landscape of trapped or confinement narratives, the 1997 Canadian science fiction horror film Cube, directed by Vincenzo Natali, holds a unique place.\n\nThe movie unveils a narrative that is as geometrically precise as it is psychologically terrifying. A disparate group of individuals find themselves in a seemingly endless maze of deadly, cube-shaped rooms. Each room has six doors, one on each face of the cube, which lead to other identical rooms, some of which are booby-trapped with lethal contraptions.\n\nWith no recollection of how they got there, the group must navigate through this geometric prison, deciphering complex mathematical clues to avoid the deadly traps, all while dealing with the psychological and emotional turmoil that ensues.\n\nThe film explores themes of human nature, social cooperation and the terrifying idea of existential entrapment within a mechanized, indifferent system.\n\nAs the characters delve deeper into the geometric abyss, the lines between sanity and madness blur, portraying a stark reflection of humanity’s struggle against the incomprehensible and often merciless structures of existence.\n\nCube is not just a horror film, but an exploration into the human psyche when faced with the unknown and the uncontrollable.\n\nIts simplistic yet effective set design, combined with a well-executed plot, draw the audience into a claustrophobic reality, making it a memorable entry in the genre of trapped narratives.\n\nThrough Cube, the audience is not only entertained but also provoked to ponder on the inherent fears of entrapment, the unknown, and the human capacity for both intellect and savagery when pushed to the limit.\n\n25) Snowpiercer\n\nThe 2013 science fiction thriller Snowpiercer, directed by Bong Joon-ho, embarks on a chilling voyage through a post-apocalyptic world, all within the confines of a perpetually moving train.\n\nThe Earth’s remaining inhabitants are aboard the Snowpiercer, a self-sustaining train that travels around the globe, shielding them from the frozen wasteland that the world has become following a failed attempt to combat global warming.\n\nThe movie is a stark exploration of class struggle, as the train’s compartments are segregated into a rigid class system, with the affluent residing in luxury at the front and the impoverished crammed into squalor at the back.\n\nThe narrative gains momentum as the tail-end passengers, led by Curtis Everett (played by Chris Evans), revolt against the oppressive social hierarchy, fighting their way car by car toward the front, each car revealing a new, often bizarre, facet of the train’s society.\n\nSnowpiercer exemplifies a trapped narrative with a moving twist. The train, both a sanctuary and a prison, is a microcosm of the broader societal structures and injustices.\n\nAs the characters battle through each compartment, they confront not only the physical barriers and adversaries but also the psychological and moral dilemmas that arise from their desperate quest for survival and equality.\n\nThrough a blend of action-packed sequences, poignant social commentary, and a darkly imaginative setting, Snowpiercer invites the audience to reflect on the human condition amidst extreme adversity.\n\nThe film’s relentless pace, matched with its thought-provoking themes, make it an exhilarating and insightful ride through the chilling consequences of environmental recklessness and social disparity.\n\n24) Identity\n\nThe chilling narrative of Identity, directed by James Mangold, takes the trapped genre to a psychological realm. On a stormy night, ten strangers find themselves stranded at a desolate Nevada motel.\n\nAs they settle in for the night, a series of gruesome murders begins to unfold, each one hinting at a sinister connection among them. With every death, the tension escalates, and trust disintegrates, leading to a feverish quest for survival.\n\nThe motel acts as a menacing cage where not just physical, but psychological entrapment unfolds.\n\nThe characters, each with a murky past, find themselves ensnared in a deadly puzzle, the pieces of which reside in the dark corners of the mind. As they grapple with the reality of their situation, the boundary between the killer and the innocent blurs, plunging them into a harrowing ordeal of self-doubt and fear.\n\nThe brilliance of Identity lies in its ability to intertwine the trapped scenario with a psychological thriller narrative. The plot, laden with twists, turns, and revelations, delves into the complexity of human psyche, identity, and the haunting specter of past deeds.\n\nAs the storm outside rages on, the storm within the characters brews with equal ferocity, leading to a climax that challenges the notions of reality and identity.\n\nWith a cast delivering compelling performances, eerie cinematography, and a storyline that keeps the audience on tenterhooks, Identity stands as a thrilling exploration of the human mind amidst a claustrophobic setting.\n\nThe film doesn’t just trap its characters physically, but entangles them in a web of psychological terror, making Identity a memorable and nerve-wracking venture into the realms of horror and mystery within the trapped genre narrative.\n\n23) 127 Hours\n\nIn the annals of survival and entrapment movies, Danny Boyle‘s 127 Hours carves a niche with its harrowing true tale of human endurance and the will to live.\n\nThe movie is a cinematic recounting of real-life adventurer Aron Ralston’s ordeal in 2003 when he gets trapped in a Utah canyon with his arm pinned under a boulder.\n\nAt the heart of 127 Hours is a singular performance by James Franco, who portrays Ralston’s desperate fight for survival over five days. The confines of the canyon become both a physical prison and a psychological crucible as Ralston battles thirst, hunger, despair, and the haunting solitude of his predicament.\n\nThe narrative dives deep into the human psyche’s resilience and the profound self-reflection that such a dire situation can evoke. As hours turn into days, Ralston’s memories, hallucinations, and an unyielding hope fuel his struggle to break free, culminating in a gut-wrenching, life-altering decision to amputate his own arm to escape.\n\n127 Hours is a stark departure from conventional entrapment movies. Instead of a fabricated set or a maze, the trap here is a merciless rock in a vast and indifferent landscape.\n\nThe cinematography captures the beauty and brutality of nature, juxtaposing the majestic canyon’s expanses with the claustrophobic crevice that holds Ralston captive.\n\nWith a tight narrative, exceptional performance by Franco, and a compelling direction that does not shy away from the visceral reality of Ralston’s ordeal, 127 Hours is a gripping exploration of human fortitude.\n\nIt’s a journey of self-discovery, of life hanging by a thread, and ultimately, the indomitable spirit of survival that defines the essence of being alive in the face of insurmountable odds.\n\n22) Castaway\n\nCastaway is an unconventional pick for a trapped/stuck movie.\n\nIt’s outdoors, but yet the main character is unescapably stuck on this remote island with nothing but volleyballs to keep him company. So, it qualifies in our opinion under the criteria above for stuck movies.\n\nAs for quality, Castaway is a great movie that has aged incredibly well, because being stuck on a desert island hasn’t changed much in the last few decades.\n\nTom Hanks is at peak Tom Hanks performance. He’s incredible and can easily carry the screen all alone. His energy in this is pure magnetism.\n\n21) Shutter Island\n\nShutter Island is another one on the list that qualifies for a number of complex reasons, some of which we can’t go into because of spoilers.\n\nBut it’s a damn fine watch. Maybe even two or more watches.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is at that point in his career when he was clearly a dramatic powerhouse. Who knows when his peak will be–guy seems to just keep getting better. But this is a great early-mid-career DiCaprio.\n\nThe supporting cast is splendid, the plot is twisty, and the payoff is… either incredibly dissatisfying or illuminating, depending on your perspective.\n\n20) Funny Games\n\nThe realm of entrapment in films takes a sadistically psychological turn in Michael Haneke‘s Funny Games, a narrative so disturbing that it was brought to audiences twice, first in 1997 and then in a shot-for-shot American remake in 2007.\n\nIn both versions, a vacationing family finds themselves held hostage in their own home by two eerily polite young men. The invaders, donning white gloves, subject the family to a series of twisted games, with survival as the elusive prize.\n\nThe horror in Funny Games emanates not from a physical prison, but from the psychological cage of fear, humiliation, and utter helplessness.\n\nThe antagonists, with their disarming smiles, tear down the veil of security within the family’s home, turning it into a terrifying arena of torment.\n\nThe cinematic experience is further intensified by Haneke’s deliberate breaking of the fourth wall, making the audience complicit in the on-screen horror.\n\nWhat sets Funny Games apart in the realm of trapped narratives is its exploration of violence and voyeurism in media.\n\nIt is less about the escape from a physical entrapment and more about the psychological ordeal and moral questioning it induces in both the characters and the audience. The film starkly portrays the thin veneer of civility and the ease with which it can be shattered, plunging ordinary lives into an abyss of horror.\n\nThrough its minimalist yet deeply disturbing narrative, Funny Games poses uncomfortable questions about the nature of violence, the ethics of spectatorship, and the dark underbelly of human psyche when subjected to extreme fear and domination.\n\nIt’s a brutal, chilling venture into the concept of entrapment, one that leaves a lingering, disquieting echo long after the credits roll.\n\n19) Gravity\n\nGravity is one on the list that really stretches the definition of stuck or trapped. I mean, she’s in space… she’s the least trapped right?\n\nEhhhhh… she’s sure in a tight spot. Sure, she could freefall into Earth’s atmosphere at any point, but she’d be burnt to a crisp. Getting out ALIVE is the key, and it’s what makes this movie–in the great wide open–so trapped feeling.\n\nSandra Bullock delivers one of her best performances, and Alfonso Cuaron shows his technical and artistic brilliance off.\n\n18) Predator (1987)\n\nThe Predator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a trapped movie. Because he is essentially trapped in the jungle with The Predator.\n\nEven though it’s outdoors, and he could conceivably walk away, we all know that’s not easy to do when being hunted alive in the middle of an untamed wilderness (if we had a nickel…).\n\nPlus, the Predator kind of makes it difficult to get to certain escape routes.\n\n17) Shawshank Redemption\n\nThere are so many things that make Shawshank Redemption a perfect movie for this list. But we struggled with whether or not this qualifies.\n\nFor one, are prisoners trapped? Or are they… imprisoned? The distinction seems pedantic, but it does make a difference. Still, it’s irrefutable that Andy Dufrane is stuck, and we can’t recommend watching The Shawshank Redemption enough.\n\n16) REC (2007)\n\nREC is a Spanish film and Quarantine is its American remake.\n\nBoth movies feature TV journalists trapped inside a quarantined building with a patient-turned-monster. We wanted to include it, because… I mean, the title alone, right? Since we all experienced what it was like in our own 2020 quarantine.\n\nBut the 2008 remake got widely panned by critics, so we’re going with REC. It’s not as amazing or iconoclastic as some of the entries on this list, but it’s one of those “just too perfect not to include” situations.\n\n15) Rear Window\n\nIn the domain of trapped narratives, Alfred Hitchcock‘s Rear Window holds a special place.\n\nStarring James Stewart as L.B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photographer, the movie intricately weaves the theme of physical confinement with voyeuristic intrigue. Stuck in his apartment with a broken leg, Jefferies becomes an unwilling spectator to the lives of his neighbors, whose daily routines unfold before him through the rear window of his apartment.\n\nThe movie’s tension escalates when Jefferies suspects one of his neighbors of committing murder.\n\nThe apartment complex transforms into a cauldron of suspense, with each window acting as a portal to a different facet of human behavior.\n\nThe audience is drawn into Jefferies’ perspective, sharing his curiosity, fear, and moral dilemma as he contemplates intervening in the dangerous affairs unfolding before him.\n\nThe brilliance of Rear Window lies in its ability to turn the mundane into the menacing.\n\nThe restricted setting becomes a playground for Hitchcock’s masterful storytelling, using limited space to build a narrative that is rich in suspense, character dynamics, and social commentary.\n\nHitchcock uses the theme of entrapment to delve into broader topics such as voyeurism, ethical responsibility, and the human penchant for curiosity, even in the face of danger.\n\nRear Window is not merely a tale of physical entrapment, but a narrative that explores the psychological and ethical boundaries that come with it.\n\nWith memorable performances, clever direction, and a story that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats, Rear Window remains a classic example of how a confined setting can serve as a powerful backdrop for exploring complex human emotions and societal norms.\n\n14) Phone Booth\n\nIn Phone Booth, director Joel Schumacher capitalizes on a simple yet effective premise to craft a story of entrapment and moral reckoning within the tight confines of a New York City phone booth.\n\nColin Farrell stars as Stu Shepard, a fast-talking publicist who finds himself trapped in a phone booth by an unseen sniper, his every move dictated by the menacing voice on the other end of the line.\n\nThe narrative thrives on the tension built within the limited space, where the phone booth transforms from a mundane urban fixture to a glass cage of terror.\n\nThe sniper, acting as a malevolent puppet master, forces Stu to confront his own moral failings under the deadly gaze of an unseen gun and the watchful eyes of a growing crowd and the media.\n\nPhone Booth is a high-stakes psychological thriller that explores themes of guilt, accountability, and the quest for redemption under extreme duress. The minimalistic setting serves to amplify the mental and emotional turmoil experienced by Stu, allowing for a taut, character-driven narrative to unfold.\n\nWith its real-time pacing, the movie maintains a breathless urgency as Stu negotiates for his life, while the bustling chaos of the city continues unabated, just beyond the fragile glass that separates him from freedom and peril alike.\n\nSchumacher’s clever use of space, pacing, and a well-executed performance by Farrell, creates a nail-biting cinematic experience in Phone Booth.\n\nIt’s a thrilling examination of the human conscience under siege, providing a stark reminder of the thin line between safety and danger in the urban jungle.\n\nThrough its compelling narrative, Phone Booth holds its audience in a tight grip of suspense, making it a notable entry in the genre of trapped narratives.\n\n13) The Mist\n\nThe Mist, directed by Frank Darabont, presents a harrowing tale of entrapment where a small town community finds itself besieged by an otherworldly mist filled with monstrous creatures.\n\nThe local supermarket becomes their makeshift fortress, but as the mist shrouds the town, it also clouds the judgment, morality, and humanity of those trapped inside.\n\nAs the external threat looms, the internal discord among the survivors escalates, exposing the frailty and the ferocity of human nature under duress. The supermarket, a symbol of everyday normalcy, turns into a battleground where fear and fanaticism clash, leading to a spiraling descent into chaos.\n\nThe Mist explores the theme of entrapment on multiple levels – physical, psychological, and societal. The characters are not only fighting the monsters lurking in the mist but also the monsters within, as panic breeds hostility and desperation corrodes empathy.\n\nFrank Darabont masterfully intertwines the horror and thriller genres with profound social commentary, creating a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is terrifying. The film delves into the human psyche, unraveling the thin veneer of civilization when faced with the unknown.\n\nWith its eerie atmosphere, compelling performances, and a chilling narrative that holds a mirror to society, The Mist offers a tense, atmospheric, and ultimately haunting exploration of entrapment.\n\nIt’s a grim reflection on the human condition, showcasing the precarious balance between hope and despair, unity and division, when the familiar world dissolves into a terrifying unknown.\n\nThrough its grim narrative and chilling climax, The Mist leaves a lasting impression, marking a significant and poignant entry in the entrapment genre.\n\n12) Green Room\n\nGreen Room, directed by Jeremy Saulnier, plunges its characters into a chilling narrative of survival within the confined quarters of a backwoods music venue.\n\nFollowing a gig gone awry, a young punk rock band finds themselves trapped in the green room, targeted by a vicious group of neo-Nazis led by a menacing Patrick Stewart. What follows is a savage battle for survival, as the band members struggle to escape the clutches of their ruthless captors.\n\nThe film explores the terror of entrapment with a gritty realism that sends shivers down the spine.\n\nThe green room, once a symbol of opportunity and excitement, quickly morphs into a deadly cage where the threat of violence looms large. Saulnier crafts a suffocating atmosphere, with the claustrophobic setting intensifying the palpable fear and desperation.\n\nGreen Room stands out for its unflinching portrayal of violence and the primal instinct for survival. It delves into the dark underbelly of human nature, exposing the lengths to which individuals will go when pushed to the brink. The tight setting serves as a pressure cooker, amplifying the tension and dread with every passing moment.\n\nWith gripping performances and a no-holds-barred approach to storytelling, Green Room offers a raw, nerve-wracking exploration of entrapment. The harrowing circumstances force the characters to confront the grim reality of their situation, sparking a ferocious will to survive against all odds.\n\nGreen Room is a visceral, blood-pumping thriller that holds its audience in a tight, unyielding grip from start to finish.\n\nIt’s a stark reminder of the thin line between civilization and savagery, making it a memorable and harrowing entry in the annals of trapped narrative films.\n\nThrough its brutal tale of survival, Green Room leaves an indelible mark, showcasing the horrifying consequences when the shackles of societal norms are shattered amidst the desperate fight for survival.\n\n11) An American Crime\n\nAn American Crime, directed by Tommy O’Haver, unveils a deeply disturbing narrative of entrapment, based on a true story.\n\nThe film revolves around the harrowing tale of Sylvia Likens, a teenage girl who, alongside her sister, is left in the care of Gertrude Baniszewski while their parents travel with a carnival.\n\nAs events unfold, Sylvia finds herself trapped in a horrifying situation of abuse and torture orchestrated by Gertrude, with neighborhood children also participating.\n\nThe residence of Gertrude Baniszewski becomes a gruesome prison for Sylvia, where the walls of a supposed safe haven morph into the boundaries of a living nightmare.\n\nThe entrapment here is not just physical but extends to a horrifying psychological and emotional realm.\n\nAn American Crime delves deep into the dark corners of human nature, exposing the capability for cruelty within ordinary individuals when societal norms and empathy are discarded.\n\nThe portrayal of apathy and dehumanization is not just a commentary on the individuals involved but also a reflection on the broader societal context that allows such atrocities to occur.\n\nThe performances, especially by Ellen Page as Sylvia and Catherine Keener as Gertrude, bring a harrowing authenticity to the narrative, immersing the audience in a terrifying reality that’s hard to shake off.\n\nAn American Crime is a chilling exploration of real-life entrapment, where the terror emanates from the human capacity for evil.\n\nThe film holds a haunting mirror to society, reflecting the dire consequences of unchecked cruelty and the desperate cries for empathy and justice.\n\nThrough its grim narrative, An American Crime offers a stark, haunting examination of the dark facets of human behavior, making it a significant, albeit disturbing, entry in the realm of trapped narratives.\n\n10) 1408\n\nThis is not one of those legendary Stephen King stories that will stay with you for years afterward, but the trapped movie entertains in just the right amount and does contain a dose of that Stephen King charm.\n\nJohn Cusack plays a paranormal debunking expert who wants to stay in the much-fabled, titular room of 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. To put it mildly, the hotel room is rumored to be haunted.\n\nThis is an interesting one on the list, because it’s an instance of a character willingly putting themselves into a trapped situation. Things get a little complicated later in the story, but Mike Enslin (Cusack) could easily just walk out the hotel room’s door at any point in the beginning.\n\n9) 10 Cloverfield Lane\n\nJohn Goodman is just too good in this movie.\n\nMary (Elizabeth Winstead) wrecks her car and gets knocked out. Post car crash, she wakes up in a bunker with Howard (John Goodman) and Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.).\n\nShe’s told the world is basically over and they’re lucky to be alive in this fallout shelter, thanks to Goodman, a supposed Good Samaritan who found Winstead just as stuff hit the fan.\n\nBut is Goodman a good guy or is he a nut job? Or both? 10 Cloverfield Lane is like the “will they, won’t they” of character judgment, and it keeps you guessing way longer than most movies manage to accomplish.\n\n8) Buried\n\nTalk about trapped. Buried is about a man, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) trapped inside a coffin, which is well… buried. With him to aid his escape, only a cell phone. Oh, and a few creature comforts: a lighter, flask, flashlight, knife, glowsticks, pen, and pencil.\n\nSet in Iraq, Ryan Reynolds plays the main character, an American truck driver. Although we get interaction with other characters, Reynolds is the only person we see on camera. The rest appear only in voice via Conroy’s cell phone.\n\nDirector Rodrigo Cortés’ ambitious filming choice heightens the claustrophobia of this trapped movie and really brings out some of Reynolds’ best acting.\n\n7) The Martian\n\nAndy Weir‘s novel and subsequent sci-fi thriller movie adaptation–perfectly cast with star Matt Damon–features an astronaut stranded (or trapped, eh?) on Mars. So, yes, The Martian is a movie about a man trapped… on an entire planet to himself.\n\nWhile it seems like that’d make for some spacious feelings, it’s quite the opposite. Mark Watney (Damon) must work in tight little habitats, air locked and pressurized. This makes for an extremely claustrophobic feeling, especially in the many moments where Watney finds himself with even less to work with than which he started out.\n\nMaking matters worse, there’s a ticking close element to this sci-fi thriller trapped movie, which makes it feel all the more desperate.\n\n6) Misery\n\nYet another Stephen King story (we really can’t seem to stay away from this guy). Misery stands apart as perhaps the quintessential trapped movie.\n\nPaul Sheldon (James Caan) is a novelist who just published the latest installment of his successful series. Although, Sheldon’s book does have a somewhat controversial end to it that has left some fans upset.\n\nWhen Sheldon crashes his car during a blizzard, nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) finds him and takes him back to her house. As she begins to nurse him back to health, she reads his new manuscript, and well… she was his number one fan, but now…\n\nMisery is a classic. And while it’s not a biological threat keeping James Caan at bay, it’s a perfect movie for anyone who knows what it feels like to be trapped.\n\n5) Panic Room\n\nDavid Fincher followed up the edgy Fight Club with the trapped movie Panic Room, more of a psychological thriller reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nMeg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) have just bought a new house. One nifty little selling feature: a securely fortified room meant to protect the house’s occupants in case of emergency. It’s colloquially referred to as a panic room.\n\nWell, of course, this panic room sees use. Three ne’er do wells attempt to break in and mother and daughter Altman lock themselves in their house’s fortress-like room.\n\nOf course, things grow complicated. We won’t spoil it, but let’s just say the movie isn’t two hours of watching people sit in a room.\n\n4) Room\n\nBefore Brie Larson inexplicably became detested by fanboys everywhere, she starred in the heartfelt trapped movie Room.\n\nJoy (Larson) is a young woman, a kidnap victim, held hostage for nearly a decade. Her captor, Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), routinely rapes her and at some point over the years he impregnated her.\n\nSo, Joy gave birth in captivity and now does her best to raise her son (Jacob Tremblay) while being held prisoner.\n\n3) Saw\n\nMany unsatisfying games have been played in households across the world as families shelter in place due to pandemic-related orders.\n\nJigsaw‘s game takes it to the next horrible level in this trapped movie.\n\nTwo strangers, photographer Adam (Leigh Whannel) and oncologist Lawrence (Cary Elwes), wake up in a dirty bathroom after a kidnapper knocked them unconscious.\n\nAfter watching some creepy videos starring a doll, a mask, and a deep, distorted voice, they learn that a serial killer wants them to complete a puzzle in order to free themselves.\n\nOne side effect to watching Saw is that you’ll feel like washing your hands thoroughly. That’s a bonus!\n\n2) The Shining\n\nStephen King has got to really go stir crazy when writing in whatever underground bunker he chooses to write from within, because he creates scenario after scenario that draws upon isolation.\n\nThe Shining is a classic–both the horror novel and this trapped movie. Stanley Kubrick‘s film adaptation of Stephen King’s novel is an intimately pieced together work of art.\n\nThe Shining is painstakingly detailed. It borders on mental illness. Much like the main character Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) experiences, as he devolves into madness. A madness at once influenced by ghosts, alcohol, and isolation.\n\nNow, it’s mostly the weather that keeps the Torrance family trapped within the Overlook Hotel.\n\n1) This Is The End\n\nThere have been plenty of jokes about how this pandemic has apocalyptic vibes. But hey, it could be worse. It could be an actual apocalypse.\n\nThis Is The End is hilarious. And it’s one of those movies that will probably be remembered for years after its release. Simply because it’s such a time capsule for that cohort of comedic actors. In that regard, it’s sort of like Animal House. Except the characters find themselves stuck in a house instead of throwing a party in a house.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Trapped Movies\n\nDid we miss a movie you consider the quintessential trapped movie or stuck movie?
