Jack must decide to spend the rest of his life with his girlfriend Terri. Marina must reconnect with her aging father. Laurel must embrace her new pregnancy and come to terms with her father’s early Alzheimer’s. Lis is learning to live with MS. And Dave must learn why life is worth it.\n\nThe cast includes Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights), Sienna Guillory (Resident Evil: Afterlife, Love Actually), Graham Greene (The Green Mile, The Twilight Saga), Shawn Roberts (xXx: Return of Xander Gage, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter), and Tammy Blanchard (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Into the Woods), with Eric Peterson and Polly Shannon). Stephen Wallis directed and wrote the screenplay.\n\nALSO CHECK OUT: Nora Arnezeder Talks About the Preparation For Her Starring Role In The Colony [Exclusive Interview]\n\nLRM Online’s Gig Patta spoke with actors Eric Peterson and Polly Shannon with director Stephen Wallis.
