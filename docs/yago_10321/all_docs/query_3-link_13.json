From the French Riviera to Vienna and Stockholm, trouble seems to follow Bishop as he investigates the past of his now deceased boss Victor Danemore. Having served as Danemore’s press agent, hired to create a past for him, Bishop has now become curious after being asked the same question by a few men. Bishop found Danemore lying on the…"
