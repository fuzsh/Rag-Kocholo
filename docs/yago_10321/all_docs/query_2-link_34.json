        "text": "This list is regularly updated as movies rotate on and off of Prime Video. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nWho wants to be scared tonight? While there are fantastic streaming services dedicated to horror nuts, there’s also a wealth of genre hits and indie darlings on Prime Video. In fact, they have one of the most diverse arrays of horror hits, including films by vets like David Cronenberg and Paul W.S. Anderson, alongside newer films from indie studios. This regularly updated list will keep Prime Video subscribers in the know on what are the best horror movies they can watch right now. Turn the lights off and lock the doors.\n\nHow We Pick Our Films\n\nCritic Brian Tallerico watches and writes about movies and TV every day. To curate this list, he dives into Amazon Prime Video’s catalogue every month to surface terrifying horror titles — using his taste and a lifetime of cinema study as his guide, instead of whatever the algorithm happens to be pushing. After triple-checking to make sure they’re still available, he watches each and writes his recommendation. We highlight more than just the crowdpleasers: Filmmakers can use horror to craft spine-tingling moods, keep audiences on their toes, and comment on culture. Read on to find something to watch.\n\n*Bram Stoker’s Dracula\n\nYear: 1992\n\nRuntime: 2h 7m\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola’s 1992 epic retelling of the classic novel is one of the most lavish and ambitious Hollywood productions of its era. Gary Oldman gives one of his best performances as the title character, but it’s Coppola’s incredible craftsmanship and unforgettable design that make this movie an underrated horror classic.\n\nCandyman\n\nYear: 2021\n\nRuntime: 1h 31m\n\nDirector: Nia DaCosta\n\nToo many people easily dismissed the Nia DaCosta remake of the 1992 classic about a boogeyman who terrorizes a Chicago community. Yes, it’s imperfect in its messaging, but it’s a spectacularly well-made film, including some excellent sound design and chilling compositions. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stars in this film that was co-written by the insanely talented Jordan Peele.\n\nCarnival of Souls\n\nYear: 1962\n\nRuntime: 1h 20m\n\nDirector: Herk Harvey\n\nAn independent filmmaker who had made his career doing industry safety videos just happened to direct one of the most essential horror flicks of all time in this absolute classic. Candace Hilligoss stars as Mary Henry, a woman who barely survives a car accident and starts seeing ghostly, zombie-like figures in the new city she’s trying to call home. As the figures draw her to an abandoned carnival, some of the best horror imagery of the 1960s surfaces in a film that didn’t get much attention on its release but has gone on to be recognized as a genre masterpiece.\n\nCube\n\nYear: 1998\n\nRuntime: 1h 30m\n\nDirector: Vincenzo Natali\n\nA true cult hit, this horror classic didn’t really make a dent at all until it was successful on VHS first and then DVD and Blu-ray. It’s a film with an undeniable premise as a group of people wake up in a facility that contains multiple, connected cubes. As they travel the labyrinth, they discover some cubes are safer than others. It’s a sharp, clever piece of genre filmmaking.\n\nThe Dead Zone\n\nYear: 1983\n\nRuntime: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: David Cronenberg\n\nDavid Cronenberg and Stephen King joined forces on one of the best adaptations of the master of literary horror. Christopher Walken stars as a normal guy who discovers he has psychic powers, which lead him to a senator who could destroy the world. It’s a smart, tight piece of genre filmmaking by one of the best horror directors of all time.\n\nEvil Dead Rise\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 36m\n\nDirector: Lee Cronin\n\nRebooting the Evil Dead series for the second time (after the successful 2013 iteration), this one moves the action to an L.A. apartment building where a single mother (the phenomenal Alyssa Sutherland) gets taken over by the same evil force that once terrorized poor Ash. Twisted and clever, Evil Dead Rise is a gruesome horror flick that was so successful that it feels like a sixth film in the series won’t take a decade to rise from the dead.\n\n*From Beyond\n\nYear: 1986\n\nRuntime: 1h 21m\n\nDirector: Stuart Gordon\n\nGordon’s other H.P. Lovecraft adaptation may be more legendary but this one is nearly as good. How do you even begin to explain this truly insane movie? It’s about a couple of scientists who develop a device that can allow people to see the unseen. When you mess with the other side, you risk the kind of chaos unleashed in this truly insane cinematic nightmare.\n\nHell House LLC\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 1h 23m\n\nDirector: Stephen Cognetti\n\nWe’re all tired of found footage movies but this flick can be one of the exceptions. So popular that it spawned a franchise (there have already been two sequels), this is the story of a documentary crew that captures the creation of a Halloween haunted house that becomes all too real, ultimately killing 15 ticket buyers and staff. Structured both in a “what happened that night” and in-the-moment found footage doc, this is a truly clever indie horror film.\n\nHellraiser\n\nYear: 1987\n\nRuntime: 1h 34m\n\nDirector: Clive Barker\n\nThe horror author Clive Barker directed this adaptation of his own novella The Hellbound Heart and made genre movie history. Introducing the world to the iconic Pinhead, who would go on to appear in so many sequels, the original film here is still the best, the tale of a puzzle box that basically opens a portal to Hell. The sequels have kind of lost the thread, but the original is still incredibly powerful. It’s one of the few films from the ‘80s that would still shatter audiences if it were released today.\n\nHigh Tension\n\nYear: 2005\n\nRuntime: 1h 29m\n\nDirector: Alexandre Aja\n\nThis movie is bonkers. Directed by Alexandre Aja (and sometimes called Switchblade Romance) it stars Cecile de France and Maiwenn as two young woman who go to a secluded farmhouse, where they’re attached by a serial killer. The twist ending to this brutal film will likely either make it or break it for you. Note: Shudder also added a few other French Horror Wave films, including Inside and Martyrs — both essential for horror fans, neither for the faint of heart.\n\nThe Host\n\nYear: 2007\n\nRuntime: 1h 59m\n\nDirector: Bong Joon-ho\n\nThe success of Parasite brought an entirely new, larger audience to the work of Bong Joon-ho, and they probably loved this riveting genre piece about a giant monster living in the Han River. Parasite star Song Kang-ho plays the patriarch of a family that’s forced into action when the creature kidnaps his daughter. When it was released, it became the highest-grossing South Korean film of all time.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers\n\nYear: 1978\n\nRuntime: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Philip Kaufman\n\nThere’s a reason that Hollywood keeps returning to Jack Finney’s novel The Body Snatchers—it strikes at a common fear that our neighbors and loved ones aren’t who they were yesterday. The best film version of Finney’s tale is the ‘70s one with Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Veronica Cartwright, Jeff Goldblum, and Leonard Nimoy. A riveting unpacking of ‘70s paranoia, this is a truly terrifying movie.\n\nIt Follows\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 1h 40m\n\nDirector: David Robert Mitchell\n\nMaika Monroe stars in this 2014 indie horror breakthrough hit as a young woman who discovers that her recent sexual activity has cursed her with a supernatural force that will chase her until she passes it along to someone else. Stylish and striking, this felt like nothing else on the American horror market in 2014, really ushering in the era of what is now called “elevated horror.” Whatever you call it, It Follows is still an unforgettable genre flick.\n\n*Jacob’s Ladder\n\nYear: 1990\n\nRuntime: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: Adrian Lyne\n\nAdrian Lyne’s 1990 horror film has developed an increasingly vocal fan base in the three decades since its release (helped in part by a horrible remake in 2020 that reminded everyone how much better the original was.) Tim Robbins stars as Jacob, a man who starts having increasingly terrifying visions and hallucinations, many of them related to his time in Vietnam. A stunning journey into Hell, it’s also an anti-war film that’s given weight by Robbins’s genuine, in-the-moment performance.\n\nPearl\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 42m\n\nDirector: Ti West\n\nMere months after the release of X, Ti West dropped a prequel in the form of this unforgettable horror flick that will now be the centerpiece of a trilogy with the Summer 2024 release of MaXXXine. Mia Goth is phenomenal as the title character, now captured in the early part of the 20th century as she tries to be a movie star but ends up a serial killer instead. It’s a fearless performance, topped by one of the genre’s best monologues.\n\nPhantasm\n\nYear: 1979\n\nRuntime: 1h 29m\n\nDirector: Don Coscarelli\n\nAnother low-budget flick that produced an empire, Don Coscarelli’s totally bonkers 1979 film isn’t as much an influential genre classic as it is kind of unlike anything before or since. Who can forget the first time they saw Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man, one of the best horror characters of his era? The crazy plot here is secondary to the unforgettable imagery and style. There’s a reason it spawned four sequels and has a very loyal cult following 40 years later.\n\nSmile\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Parker Finn\n\nParamount has been regularly funneling some of their biggest theatrical hits to their streaming service for a small window of time before they roll over to Prime too. That was the case with Parker Finn’s debut feature film that was in theaters just last summer and made a fortune worldwide (over $200 million). One of the biggest commercial and critical horror hits of 2022, Smile is about a therapist who discovers something supernatural stalking her patients. It will get under your skin.\n\nTotally Killer\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Nahnatchka Khan\n\nWhat if Scream and Back to the Future had a baby? It would look a lot like this Prime Original thriller about a young woman (a fun Kiernan Shipka) who travels back in time and joins forces with the teenage version of her mother to stop a serial killer. Quirky and clever, it works as a mystery, slasher film, and an ‘80s comedy.\n\n*Warm Bodies\n\nYear: 2013\n\nRuntime: 1h 32m\n\nDirector: Jonathan Levine\n\nNicholas Hoult has become one of the more consistently interesting actors of his generation and this remains one of his most delightful early performances. The star of The Great plays, well, a dead guy. Named only “R,” this zombie discovers that you don’t need a beating heart to fall in love when he meets Julie, played by a charming Teresa Palmer. A zom-rom-com, this one certainly isn’t like anything else on Prime.\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
