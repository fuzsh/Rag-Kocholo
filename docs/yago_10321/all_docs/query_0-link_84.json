        "text": "“ I'm not a stranger, okay, I'm just strange ”\n\n–Eli Hudson to Emma Duval, Let The Right One In\n\nEli Hudson was a recurring character in the second season of Scream. Eli was the 16 year old, friendly yet intriguing cousin of Kieran Wilcox, and the nephew of the late Clark Hudson. Despite his character being a red herring, Eli ended up for the most part, a sympathizer for the Lakewood Five and a friend. He moved from Atlanta to Lakewood at the insistence of himself and his single mother, Tina Hudson.\n\nEli, due to his association with being Kieran's cousin, who was dating his nonreciprocating crush Emma Duval, would be brought in as a suspect during the Second Lakewood Murders during the second latter of its events, beginning in January-February 2016, around his arrival. Despite his tendencies to break in, Eli would be a vigilante as he would try to better himself and strive towards Emma's attention. It's revealed that most of Eli's trust issues and anger stems from his own upbringing and volatile relationship with his cousin, Kieran, who falsely accused him of breaking into a girl's home in Atlanta and posting her nude photos online, due to Kieran being jealous of Eli getting the girl.\n\nThis led Eli to get a wrongful restraining order from the girl's family against him, which led to a then 15 year old Eli arriving to Lakewood during the 2015 murders, to find Kieran, but whose plans to seek revenge were foiled in light of the tragedy and who attended the funeral for the victims in November, following the death of the mastermind, Piper Shaw. In the end, it's revealed Eli's cousin was the killer and Piper's secret loverand who ambushed him once Eli began to suspect, and who would become the final victim, who died in the end trying to warn Emma and Audrey Jensen of the truth. His innocence would be proven following Kieran shooting him dead, and revealing himself.\n\nHe was portrayed by Sean Grandillo.\n\nDescription\n\nDespite his squeaky clean image, he might be hiding ulterior motives. His arrival in Lakewood brings along secrets of Kieran's past that were buried long ago.\n\nBackground\n\nEarly Life\n\nEli was born aprox. in early to mid-1999 to Tina Hudson and an unknown father in Atlanta. Not much is known about Eli's past or childhood, except for that he grew up alongside his older cousin, Kieran, and whose uncle was his mother's older brother; whom as parents, were troubled (Clark as a drug addict and Tina as a harlot), which led to Eli and Kieran bonding. At one point in Eli's youth (approx. 2008/2009), he became aware of Kieran's true nature and lies when Kieran stole and killed a (or his, unclear) neighborhood dog, alongside and blaming it on him.\n\nThis led to Eli's wariness of Kieran and ultimately reached a point in approximately 2014 (or 2015, unstated), when a then 14/15-year old Eli and alongside a then 15/16 year old Kieran (prior to his stepfather and mother's deaths, as well as Eli knowing the truth that Kieran indirectly caused it due to him arguing, as well before Kieran was taken in by his father to Lakewood), fell in love with an unknown teenage girl in Atlanta. Feeling jealous due to Eli and the girl, Kieran would break into the girl's bedroom and breach her privacy by leaking private nude photos of her online and blaming it on Eli, going as far as going to the girl's home and convincing her mother it was him. This would land Eli with a criminal record and restraining order from the girl against him (unclear if his criminal record alongside him being a trespasser occurred during this time, but likely).\n\nSecond Lakewood Murders\n\nFirst Lakewood Murders, 2015\n\nIn the fall of 2015, during Eli's (and Kieran's) junior year of high school in Atlanta (possibly Weaver), a then 15/16-year old Eli would try and seek revenge on his cousin, by visiting Lakewood in approximately mid-late October 2015 (who had moved 2 months prior to Lakewood and attended George Washington High). However, due to the recurring Second Lakewood Murders (first since 1994) occurring at the same time as well as the death of his uncle and the town's former sheriff, Clark, by the Lakewood Slasher; and the funeral memorial services for the victims in November, left Eli distressed and with a change of mind. This occurred after he saw his supposedly mourning cousin Kieran, alongside his (faux) girlfriend, Emma Duval (who was the long lost half-sister of the new murders' perpetrator, Piper Shaw; who was Kieran's secret lover), and the other survivors whom he would later meet in the next 3 moths known as the Lakewood Six (later Five, due to death of Jake Fitzgerald; unclear if Eli knew him but perhaps was likely aware, unstated).\n\nSecond Lakewood Murders, 2016\n\nFollowing having attended the funeral memorial services for his uncle and the other victims of Lakewood in November 2015, both Eli and his mother, Tina (who attended not long after; unclear but most likely unaware of her son's disappearance in fall-2015 to Lakewood), returned to Atlanta, in where Tina was in a relationship with her boyfriend (alluding to Eli having had to endure this growing up and having potential unknown stepfathers) and who, according to Eli, they lived in a \"shitty\" two-bedroom apartment.\n\nRegardless, Tina left her now orphaned 16 year old nephew Kieran alone, despite court mandated orders to visit him, leaving him alone throughout the holidays, with occasional visits, in order to receive the state stipends. Eli continued his studies as a junior in Atlanta, up until Tuesday, January 26th, 2016, when him and his mother went to Lakewood, due to being called by the new Lakewood Sheriff, Miguel Acosta, which led to them settling into his former uncle's house to live with Kieran. Prior to convincing his mother, he visited unannounced to George Washington to talk to Emma and unofficially meet her, due to his growing crush on her.\n\nHe would be enrolled in the school the following day on Wednesday, January 27th, and would become by his cousin (and faux-member, due to being the actual killer), associated to the Lakewood 6, unofficially, much like his classmate and Noah's girlfriend, Zoe Vaughn. During the week he was enrolled, he would get a job at the Grindhouse Cafe to get closer to Emma, much to Kieran's dismay. Regardless, he blended well and whose old habits of trespassing and watching and appearing to people from afar, was apparent, due to being the new kid, and who would be made a suspect during the reinitiated murders, especially by Audrey. His past once again caught up to him during a break in for picnic date at the abandoned Wren Estate houses near Wren Lake, which caught fire (revealed to be Kieran as the killer) when he and Emma tried to get close and who unknowingly was in the same house where Kieran held a barely-living Seth Branson and a deceased Eddie Hayes in the bathroom of the house.\n\nHowever, following the death of Haley in the first week of February, and who had gotten into a fight with his cousin due to each vying (truly being Eli) for Emma's affection the day prior on the Lakewood Carnival, and the remaining survivors being targeted and others killed being revealed (such as when Jake's body fell down on Friday, January 29th), the doors would close in on him, as his past history would be brought in a ploy to try to implicate him by the Lakewood Slasher.\n\nDeath\n\nFriday, February 5th, 2016\n\nFollowing Emma and Audrey's arrest the following night and escape by the Lakewood Slasher after being framed by them, Eli would be concerned about Emma's absence and who didn't believe the story of her or Audrey killing Quinn Maddox (due to his own fear of trying to blackmail the shady mayor a day prior to his death and breaking into his house). Eli would find Kieran's behavior suspicious during Kieran's supposedly secret help and guiding Emma and Audrey around Lakewood hidden. He would find the hidden letters trying to implicate him as the killer, and who would follow Kieran (not long after his encounter at Zenith Theatre, where he would strike as the killer and attack Brooke; as well as kidnap Audrey) to the abandoned Blessed Sister's Orphanage (where a night party was held 3 days prior and led to the death of Eli's classmate, Haley, who was Kieran's unknowing assistant. Eli would head in only to be stabbed by Kieran unmasked, and who would tell this as he found Emma and Audrey locked and trapped, before being shot in the chest by Emma in false context, before Kieran would reveal himself, and as Eli resuscitated and was shot again point blank 4 times, ultimately killing him, much to Emma's shock.\n\nAppearances (9/24)\n\nSeason 2 (9/14)\n\nPsycho\n\nVacancy\n\nHappy Birthday To Me\n\nDawn of the Dead\n\nLet The Right One In\n\nVillage of the Damned\n\nThe Vanishing\n\nHeavenly Creatures\n\nWhen a Stranger Calls\n\nQuotes\n\nRelationships\n\nFamily\n\nTina Hudson - Mother\n\nUnnamed father\n\nClark Hudson † - Uncle\n\nUnnamed aunt via Clark - †\n\nKieran Wilcox † - Cousin\n\nAllies\n\nLakewood\n\nThe Morgue - Podcast\n\nMaggie Duval - Friend via Emma\n\nGeorge Washington High School\n\nZoë Vaughn † - Friend/Classmate\n\nKristen Lang - Teacher\n\nLakewood Five\n\nEmma Duval - Unrequited Love/Friend\n\nNoah Foster - Friend/Classmate\n\nAudrey Jensen - Friend/Classmate/Contempt of (formerly)\n\nGustavo Acosta - Friend/Classmate\n\nBrooke Maddox - Friend/Classmate\n\nEnemies\n\nLakewood Slasher\n\nKieran Wilcox † - Killer/Cousin (accomplice of first (albeit second) new Lakewood Slasher in 2015)\n\nLakewood\n\nQuinn Maddox † - Mayor/Attempted to Blackmail (failed; cousin killed him to frame him)\n\nGeorge Washington High School\n\nHaley Meyers † - Frenemy (due to instigating fight with Emma and unbeknownst to him (and her) was the assistant to his cousin as the killer)\n\nLakewood Sheriff's Department (due to his past criminal history and distrust in general)\n\nMiguel Acosta - Sheriff\n\nDeputy Stevens † - Deputy\n\nLaverne Shell - Deputy\n\nDwayne † - Deputy\n\nTrivia\n\nHe shares similarities with Cotton Weary.\n\nHe marked his first appearance in the series in Psycho.\n\nHe is the son of Tina Hudson, the cousin of Kieran Wilcox and the nephew of the deceased Sheriff Hudson.\n\nHe is a romantic interest of Emma Duval.\n\nIn Vacancy, he transferred to George Washington High and commenced his studies at the school as a new student.\n\nHe is shown to have a lot of knowledge of alcohol, due to his mother, Tina Hudson being an alcoholic.\n\nIn Happy Birthday To Me, he is revealed to have a fake ID to Emma.\n\nKieran revealed that Eli killed his dog when he was young in Happy Birthday to Me.\n\nJeepers Creepers is the first episode Eli does not appear in.\n\nIn Let The Right One In, he revealed to Emma that he has a history with the police.\n\nIn Let The Right One In, it was revealed that he works at the Grindhouse Cafe.\n\nIn Village of the Damned, it was revealed that he had a restraining order filed against him by an unnamed girl in Atlanta.\n\nIn When a Stranger Calls, before he died, he revealed the truth about the incident in Atlanta.
