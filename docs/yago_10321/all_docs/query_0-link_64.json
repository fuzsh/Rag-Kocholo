        "text": "I love this week's variety on digital, Blu-ray and DVD. There's everything from arthouse sensations, book club adaptations, superheroes, children's films. horror movies, classic science fiction, television series, documentaries, and foreign-language releases. And I've only watched a handful of them. There's just so much to choose from.\n\nDigitally, I'm thrilled that \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\" is now able to make its way into homes and smartphones. It's simply one of the most uplifting films and manages to be incredibly smart, poignant, and topical without straying from its cuteness. \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" is an interesting thriller made all the more palpable byDaisy Edgar-Jones. Everything, except for the surprisingly obscure Ryan Reynolds film \"Paperman,\" is unexplored by me. The election documentary \"This Land\" is definitely of interest.\n\nOn the physical side of things we have the blockbuster prequel \"Minions: The Rise of Gru;\" Leslie Manville's delightful \"Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris;\" the must-see (regardless of your personal stance) abortion drama \"Happening;\" a gaggle of television seasons; and most importantly, the 4K UHD release of the Director's version of \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" that transports me back to sitting on the floor with my father on the couch behind me as I'm introduced to the Enterprise for the very first time.\n\nDigital to Own\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On\n\nStudio Synopsis:Marcel is an adorable one-inch-tall shell who ekes out a colorful existence with his grandmother Connie and their pet lint, Alan.

A beloved character gets his big-screen debut in this hilarious and heartwarming story about finding connection in the smallest corners.\n\nWhere the Crawdads Sing\n\nStudio Synopsis:Where the Crawdads Sing tells the story of Kya, an abandoned girl who raised herself to adulthood in the dangerous marshlands of North Carolina. For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” haunted Barkley Cove, isolating the sharp and resilient Kya from her community. Drawn to two young men from town, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world; but when one of them is found dead, she is immediately cast by the community as the main suspect. As the case unfolds, the verdict as to what actually happened becomes increasingly unclear, threatening to reveal the many secrets that lay within the marsh.\n\nBatman and Superman: Battle of the Super Sons\n\nStudio Synopsis:11-year-old Jonathan Kent discovers he has superpowers, thrusting the half-Kryptonian into the complicated world of Super Heroes and Super-Villains – who are now under attack by a malevolent alien force known as Starro!

No melodrama.\n\nPaperman\n\nStudio Synopsis:A washed-up writer forms an unlikely friendship with a teenager from Long Island. Starring Ryan Reynolds, Emma Stone, Jeff Daniels, Lisa Kudrow, and Kieran Culkin.\n\nSomething in the Woods\n\nStudio Synopsis: Nora Thompson, a reporter, has become an overnight celebrity by exposing Senator Morrison’s illegal activities.

He recognizes her. Takes a selfie with her. Tells her he wrote a screenplay for her and even has it with him. Soon, Janet’s bound to the dolly and Walter’s shooting his movie right there in her house. Of course, Walter is no delivery boy at all. He’s a renegade filmmaker doing whatever it takes to get his movie in the can, which just so happens to be the worst movie of all time, Water Under the Fridge.

Brand, in his later guise as a cyber futurist, coined the phrase “personal computer” and inspired many in Silicon Valley, including Steve Jobs who cited Brand as a major influence. Now in his ninth decade, still committed to long term thinking, he controversially advocates for a new approach to nuclear power and the bio-reengineering of keystone extinct species.\n\nBlu-ray & DVD\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru\n\nStudio Synopsis: Long before he becomes the master of evil, Gru (Oscar nominee Steve Carell) is just a 12-year-old boy in 1970s suburbia, plotting to take over the world from his basement.

The film successfully launched the Star Trek franchise beyond the original television series, despite having been rushed to theaters with incomplete special effects and forced editing choices.\n\nIn 2001, director Robert Wise revisited the film to refine the edit and enhance the visual effects. His updated vision was released on DVD in standard definition and embraced by fans but has never been available in higher definition until now. Meticulously assembled and restored by producer David C. Fein with post-production supervisor Mike Matessino, both of whom originally collaborated with Wise, the film has been prepared for presentation in 4K Ultra HD with Dolby Vision™ high dynamic range (HDR) and a new powerful and immersive Dolby Atmos soundtrack.* Fein and Matessino assembled a team of visual effects experts, led by returning visual effects supervisor Daren R.

After more than six months of painstaking work, the updated movie looks and sounds better than ever while staying true to Wise’s original intention.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture—The Director’s Edition—The Complete Adventure 4K Ultra HD\n\nThe Director's Edition\n\nThe Theatrical Cut\n\nThe first-ever widescreen presentation of the Special Longer Version of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, originally created for broadcast television in 1983\n\nThe set is presented in deluxe packaging along with exclusive collectibles, including reproductions of original promotional material, a booklet with behind-the-scenes images, stickers, and more.\n\nStar Trek: The Original Motion Picture Collection\n\nThis comprehensive 15-disc collection includes the first six big-screen adventures featuring the original series crew in 4K Ultra HD with Dolby Vision and HDR-10.
