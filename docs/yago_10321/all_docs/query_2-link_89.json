        "text": "Carnival Row spoilers ahead.\n\nOrlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne's steampunk allegory of war, society and bigotry has come to a close with the final two episodes.\n\nCarnival Row, which was announced to be ending in November, had a lot of ground to cover as those fighting for peace and freedom rose up against those that were suppressing them, with plenty of blood shed.\n\nBut what exactly happened as the show reached its climax?\n\nHere's a breakdown of season two, episode 10.\n\nCarnival Row ending explained\n\nIn the final two episodes of Carnival Row, no one was safe – with a number of significant deaths within the final hours of the show.\n\nBut then again, this show has never been afraid to kill off cast members, particularly in season two.\n\nIn episode nine, 'Battle Lines', Imogen is back in high society – but at a cost. After returning to the Burgue to negotiate a peace treaty on behalf of the New Dawn, she's lost Agreus on the way and murdered her brother Ezra.\n\nThe New Dawn, led by Leonora, arrive at the Burge and negotiate a deal with vigilante faes the Black Raven, which now has Vignette (Cara Delevingne) back in their fold with plans for revolution.\n\nWhile all this is happening, Philo (Orlando Bloom) is making it his mission to find out who – or more precisely what – has been murdering faes and humans alike.\n\nWith life in the Burgue falling apart, fae Tourmaline, who has visions of the future, learns something new – she can stop transformations. This is particularly handy for Darius, a Marrok (kind of like a werewolf but more associated with moods than the moon).\n\nHer visions eventually lead her to discover the truth about the shapeshifting Sparas – it's Mikulas Vir (Andrew Buchan), a character who has infiltrated the Burgue unnoticed on behalf of New Dawn, until now.\n\nSo that's one major (sorry) question solved, but with revolution upon the Burgue, the Row and its fae-people are rising up with Vignette and Leonora as their leaders.\n\nAgneus is recaptured and tortured by the Black Raven, and one of his horns is broken off before being sent to Imogen.\n\nThat brings us to episode 10, focusing on the civil war, with all the major groups present and correct as they fight for control of the Burgue.\n\nVignette and Philo, once so bound together, are now on opposite sides, with Philo desperately trying to stop the fight and Vignette leading the charge.\n\nMajor Vir reveals himself as the Sparas in a locked-down parliament, and all hell breaks loose. The Pact, the New Dark, the Black Raven and the Burgue all fight it out for their place in society.\n\nDarius, intent on protecting Tourmaline, remains on the Row to keep an eye on her, but she commands him to leave, telling him there's nothing between them and she's safer without him. She later connects with the Sparas, narrowly stopping him from killing Philo.\n\nAs Tourmaline accepts her fate, the Sparas comes to get him but, in the final moment, a transformed Darius appears out of nowhere, ambushing the Sparas and sending him through a glass window. Vignette then turns up and helps in the fight, almost dying as she sacrifices herself for Tourmaline.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, Philo arrives, allows himself to be consumed by the Sparas, then shoots him from the inside out, finally killing him.\n\nUnfortunately, Darius is the only one that doesn’t survive the attack, too badly injured to survive. In his final moments, Tourmaline and Philo watch over him as he takes his last breath.\n\nPhilo and Vignette share a moment, and while Philo says he loves her, she says her heart lies with Tourmaline, and they make peace with each other.\n\nMeanwhile, over on the Row, Constable Thatch has been galvanising the radical racist humans who want the fae gone. Despite Sergeant Dombey – who was once against the fae, but is now sympathetic towards them – begging him not to, Thatch bursts through the gates of the Row, and a murderous siege ensues.\n\nThe Black Raven begin to fight back, even though they are unprepared for the amount of people with literal torches and pitchforks, and pull them into a controlled area of the Row, with Leonora's comrades picking them off one-by-one from afar.\n\nPhilo drags the body of the Sparas into the centre of town, and declares the fight over. Leonora, knowing she's lost, demands their comrades hide.\n\nAgreus, catching them trying to leave, confronts Leonora and prepares to shoot her, but instead tells the authority where she is. Rather than face repercussions, she stabs herself in the throat, telling them that her message has already made its way out there.\n\nAs the police begin their mission of cleaning up the row and arresting the stragglers, Constable Thatch emerges from hiding and shoots Philo in the back. Sergeant Dombey then shoots Thatch in the head.\n\nCarnival Row: What next?\n\nFlashing forward into the future, there is light and colour back in the world – with Millworthy no longer the Parliamentary figure he was, instead performing puppet plays to children, educating them on how someone is beyond what they look like.\n\nPhilo has miraculously managed to survive the shooting, though now walks with a cane, and is offered the position of Chancellor.\n\nIn a speech to Parliament, he talks about hiding who he is while others like him are persecuted. Knowing they \"have no intent on changing as they have too much invested in how things are\" he turns down the position, saying he refuses to be their excuse not to change.\n\nHe also speaks briefly of his loss of Vignette, saying she deserved better.\n\nImogen and Agreus have reunited, with Agreaus getting his horn back after it was placed with gold. Together, they start an electric company.\n\nBut in the biggest happy ending, Vignette and Tourmaline get married, with the pair planning a future together.\n\nWith the Row returning to its former glory, humans and fae are now living somewhat more at peace."
