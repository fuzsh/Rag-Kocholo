        "text": "(bell ring)\n\n(suspenseful organ music)\n\n(thunder)\n\n[Narrator] Herk Harvey was a Kansas-based director\n\nof industrial films,\n\nwhen he made his one and only feature, Carnival of Souls,\n\nin 1962, and it's a great one.\n\nIt's a horror film of sorts,\n\nbut a film of psychological horror,\n\nwith a metaphysical dimension\n\nthat remains uncertain throughout.\n\nIt's a story of its time. (organ music)\n\nA story of death, sex and religion,\n\nand it's rooted in its place in time\n\nlike a documentary.\n\n(pipe organ music)\n\nThe action starts in a Kansas town where Mary Henry,\n\nplayed by Candace Hilligoss,\n\nis involved in a drag race on a rickety bridge.\n\nThe car plunges into a muddy river and Mary is,\n\npardon the pun, the sole survivor.\n\n(organ music)\n\nMary's an organist who has been hired\n\nto work in a church in Utah.\n\n(organ music)\n\nIt's not clear whether her cold, detached,\n\nrigidly secular attitude preceded the accident.\n\nIn any case, she heads to Salt Lake City\n\nand strange things start happening.\n\nMary begins to see, or to imagine,\n\nthe face of a ghoulish man, played by the director,\n\nturning up unexpectedly and scaring her out of her wits.\n\nShe becomes obsessed with an abandoned pavilion\n\nthat she passes on the road.\n\n(pipe organ music)\n\n(clanging noise)\n\nMeanwhile, there's a real life man troubling her,\n\nJohn Linden, her neighbor in a boarding house,\n\nwho vacidiously drools over her and keeps trying\n\nto ask her for a date.\n\n(organ music)\n\nMary has an extreme aversion to dating, and to men,\n\nbut her terrifying visions deepen her erotic torment,\n\nand she's trapped in a self-perpetuating\n\nvortex of delusions.\n\n(Mary breathing loudly, nervously)\n\nHey what's the matter with you?\n\n[Narrator] Harvey has an amazing eye.\n\nThe movie was made on an ultra-low budget,\n\nbut it's compositional sense is virtually musical.\n\nThe locations seem to come alive with their\n\noverwhelming sense of overemotional significance for Mary.\n\nThe cinematography is almost animistic.\n\n(pipe organ music)\n\nThe director also has an ingenious way\n\nwith the simplest techniques of the cinema.\n\nWhether crude but powerful special effects, or above all,\n\nthe detachment of the soundtrack from the image,\n\nwhich gives rise to a sequence that's one of the simplest,\n\nmost potent, living nightmares on film.\n\n[Mary] What's the matter with her?\n\n(suspenseful organ music)\n\nWhat the hod's the matter with everyone?\n\n(suspenseful organ music)\n\nWhy don't they answer me?\n\n(suspenseful high-pitched organ music)\n\n(Strings and organ music)\n\n(footsteps)\n\n(high-pitched suspenseful string music)\n\n(footsteps)\n\n(suspenseful, haunting string music)"
