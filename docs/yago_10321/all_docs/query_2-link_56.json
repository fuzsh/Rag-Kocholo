        "text": "Coney Island carnival of doom.\n\nPsychotronic carny fun for Herschell Gordon Lewis drive in deviants… Burt Young as gimpy, the bickering unlikable carnival patrons, the fortune teller, the damn balloon dart game, the drunks, a balding psycho with mommy issues… this is solid carnival grime that hits a tripped out regional post Romero/pre Hooper scuzz vibe that I love so much and it just runs with it… feeling sort of like the logical next step in carnival swill after Freaks and She-Freak.\n\nNot as good as the similarly titled Malatesta’s Carnival of blood, but it’s still Something Weird for the weirdos.\n\nYou know how a polite way to describe someone's cluttered house is to say it looks \"lived in?\" Low budget movies from this era look \"lived in\" to me. The interiors are clearly someone's real apartment: awkwardly decorated with a fishnet or a framed van Gogh print, paint peeling, walls dirty. It makes you realize how sterile and Ikea-showroom-esque most Hollywood living spaces are. Then there's the location shooting at Coney Island which at times gets \"too real\" when unsolicited extras come in and out of frame.\n\nCarnival of Blood transcends its novelty as a time capsule, however, by containing no fewer than five or six show stopping character performances. At the screening I was at, much ado was made…\n\nbefore directing a slew of XXX films, Leonard Kirtman made this wild proto-slasher set at a carnival that is histrionic to a fault, features Burt Young as a dog killing man named Gimpy with facial scarring and lays the Coney Island love on thick; basically a Herschell Gordon Lewis-esque riff on She Freak, with that pastel red blood we all know and love and some truly admirable performances from just about everyone put on screen (but especially every drunk person that tries to throw darts and win a teddy bear)\n\n\"Gimpy, there's something I've been wondering about. What's your real name?\"\n\nGimpy\n\n\"Come on. Nobody's called Gimpy. What's your real name?\"\n\nMister Gimpy.\n\nHad to watch this CRAZY flick, on Burt Young's birthday. Great footage of Coney Island, in the early 70's. Loved the spookhouse. Loved Young's interactions with the rude customers. Especially the OBNOXIOUS woman with the very chic sunglasses. By the end, you'll be muttering \"What the fuck, is going on\" Recommended for fans of seedy carnivals, teddy bears, and Burt Young.\n\nI preferred the other Carnival of Blood that I watched earlier today, but this meant a lot to me because of where it was filmed! I used to go to Coney Island with my dad every weekend as a kid, so it was pretty great to see someone get decapitated on the Spook-a-Rama ride there. I loved the frenetic editing in the opening credits that just kept cutting between rides, a fighting couple, and a talking head that got sliced open. That teddy bear stuffed with guts was pretty cool too. Also, “Carnival” by Bikini Kill has been stuck in my head all day.\n\nA weird, trashy coney island murderfest- there are shades of The Strangler, but much cheaper and scuzzier. And it's awesome. The wonderful trippy score is enhanced by loops of, like, laughing animatronic clowns from the dark ride, and crowd noises, and the whooshing of a Rollercoaster, etc. It's disturbing and so enticing at the same time.\n\nThe characters are angry, misanthropic, yelling, always fighting...it's such a hectic scene. I love the poor fortune teller who keeps seeing portents of death but no one will just go home when she tells them to, not to mention all the bitching and complaining at her $5 fee!\n\nAlthough this is pretty bizarre all through, the ending is so gloriously insane that I can't even really describe it. I just loved it. Also, DA Dan... next time maybe try calling the cops to help you out, just a thought.\n\na cyclic proto-slasher that’s far too repetitive and loaded with filler to grasp the delirium it strives to emulate, and that’s alright—the Coney Island backdrop rocks, and the bloody carnival mess, when allowed to cut loose, gets feverish enough to keep the film moderately mesmeric. sucks it gets lost in this abnormal thread of romance stitched together by a recurring folk song without enough indulgence in the malice or zaniness to offset the misplaced drama.\n\n1970s / No Mans Land: Regional Horror Oddities\n\n\"This is where she got killed last night\"\n\n\"I know that, that's why I want to go in there\"\n\nI can only take so much of watching people play carnival games, awkwardly fool around and have their fortunes told. The music in this isn't helping anything either. Putting organs inside teddy bears is pretty morbid but this whole thing is a never ending loop of boredom so any surreal killer carnival stuff gets lost.\n\nI’ve only been to Coney Island once, but it was worth remembering. After buying my date ice cream, we walked over to a game called Shoot the Freak. The goal was to annihilate some dude in a pit with paintball rifles while a sleazy carnival barker riffed into his mic. The freak swore at us a lot as he got shot by little kids. We walked away and the barker announced over the PA, “Yeah, buddy, you go eat your ice cream. Why don’t you take that ice cream and smear it all over your girlfriend’s tits.”"
