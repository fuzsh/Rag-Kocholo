        "text": "THE LOST HONOUR OF CHRISTOPHER JEFFERIES\n\nThe Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies is based on the true story of Christopher Jefferies, a retired schoolmaster who was arrested when his tenant, 25-year-old landscape architect Joanna Yeates, was found murdered on Christmas Day in 2010. While in police custody, Jefferies became the most familiar face in Britain.\n\nThis powerful award winning drama begins the day before Yeates’ disappearance, and follows the innocent Jefferies through his arrest, release and subsequent isolation as his un-sought fame profoundly affected his life. On January 20th the real killer, neighbour Vincent Tabak, was finally arrested.\n\nBased on exclusive interviews with Jefferies, writer Peter Morgan tells the true story behind those events and his subsequent legal actions against those newspapers that put him through such an ordeal."
