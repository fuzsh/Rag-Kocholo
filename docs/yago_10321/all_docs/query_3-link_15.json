        "text": "Sheldon Reynolds, helmer, producer and scribe behind popular 1950s spy skein “Foreign Intrigue” and others, died Jan. 25 at home in upstate New York after a long battle with emphysema. He was 79.\n\nThe dapper Reynolds, a noted bon vivant, at first leaned toward mechanical work and woodcraft but on a lark, after reading a friend’s script, he wrote one of his own, which was quickly bought and established his reputation in the industry.\n\nHe made a name for himself by the time he was 33 as producer, writer and sometime-director of the syndicated skein “Foreign Intrigue,” which ran on U.S. TV 1951-55. Reynolds pioneered TV location shooting with the skein, which was lensed in Europe. He would go on to simultaneously direct, produce and write all of his remaining series.\n\n“Foreign Intrigue” also became one of the first TV series to spawn a feature film. Reynolds helmed the 1956 pic, which starred Robert Mitchum.\n\nThe success of “F.I.” gave Reynolds the means to acquire facilities in Paris, where he shot his next series, “Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson” (1959). In the ’60’s he helmed the series “Dick and the Duchess,” co-starring Patrick O’Neal and Hazel Court, and pics “A Place Called Glory” and “Assignment to Kill.” He wrapped another deal with the Arthur Conan Doyle estate in the late ’70s for a new “Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson,” series, which was shot entirely in Poland.\n\nOne who knew the ladies’ man and fashion plate fondly eulogized, “He will be sorely missed by all the tailors of the Western World.”\n\nSurvivors include wife Joesphine Neilson Reynolds and ex-wife Andrea Milos Frottier Reynolds Plunket."
