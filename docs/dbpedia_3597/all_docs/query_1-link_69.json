        "text": "The Franco-Prussian War (July 19, 1870-May 10, 1871) was a war between France and Prussia, with Prussia being supported by the North German Confederation and the South German states. The war resulted in the unification of the German Empire, the diminishment of French influence throughout Europe, and the territory of Alsace-Lorraine becoming part of the newly formed German Empire.\n\nThis database contains 248 lists of German army officers and soldiers who either died, were injured, or went missing during the Franco-Prussian War. These lists were published in Berlin on a nearly daily basis during the war. They were later compiled into a single volume and represent nearly a complete record of German casualties from this war.\n\nInformation provided in the lists about the soldiers and officers may include:\n\nName\n\nRank\n\nRegiment and company\n\nInformation about the death, injury, or missing status\n\nPlace of origin\n\nBattles fought in\n\nOther details about the personâ€™s circumstances and situation in becoming a casualty\n\nThe same person may be mentioned in multiple lists if their status changed or more information about them was later found out.\n\nUse of the data and images in this online database is governed by the terms and conditions of this site. Any use of these records not specifically permitted in the terms and conditions requires the permission of the Niedersachsen State Family History Society, Hannover."
