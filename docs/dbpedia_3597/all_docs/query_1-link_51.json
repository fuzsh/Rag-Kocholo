        "text": "A history museum unique in Europe\n\nThis museum, which opened in 2014, is the only one entirely devoted to the history of the Franco-Prussian War [la Guerre de 1870] and the annexation of Alsace and part of Lorraine by the German Empire (1871-1918). It takes a fresh look at the issues raised by this conflict which signed the end of the Second French Empire: German unity, life during the annexation, the tensions in the run-up to the First World War, etc.\n\nSome exceptional Franco-German exhibits\n\nThe permanent exhibition 900 m² presents some rare French and German collections. Military objects, remarkable paintings, sculptures, fragments of monuments and everyday objects.\n\nInnovative architecture and museography\n\nA visit to this astonishing modern museum is both visually pleasing and educational. The visitor learns about History through the history of men and women retraced by their personal effects, photographs and testimonies, and enriched by several audio-visual displays.\n\nOn the battlefields\n\nThe museum is located on the site of the August 1870 fighting, opposite the most important place of commemoration of the War of 1870: la Halle du Souvenir [the Hall of Remembrance]. Visitors can prolong their visit by discovering other monuments in the surrounding area and walking trails evoking the conflict."
