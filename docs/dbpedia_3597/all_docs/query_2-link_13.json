        "text": "The First Reich was Charlemagne's creation.\n\nThe Second was Bismarck's\n\nThe Third was Hitler's.\n\nThe English cognate for \"Reich\" is \"Commonwealth\".\n\nWell, the first wasn't really German though.\n\nEmperor -I am sure that you are wrong re Switzerand, The Swiss fought for their independence from Hapsburg Austira-see William Tell .\n\nAnd Germany pre -Bismarrk was dominated by the Austro Hungarian Empire. Netherlands was the Spanish Netherlands colony before the Dutch grabbed their independence from Hapsburg Spain in 1580.-no German connection at all.\n\nBohemia was an independent kingdom for centuries too.\n\nan independentd Kingdom before succumbing to Austrian Hapsburg rule\n\nBelgium was known as the Austrian Netherlands -no German connection here either so your take on Europe's historical Geography and German history is deficient.\n\nThe Hapsburgs wee Spanish /Austrian -not German except by marriage..\n\n.\n\nAn independent Austrian identity only emerged post-45. Before that they were Germans.\n\nNo actually it was the \"Heiliges römisches Reich deutscher nation\", which was founded by emperor Otto I, also founder of the Ottonian dynasty (919-1024).\n\nAfter defeating the Hungarians Otto, as king of the east Frankish kingdom was called to Rome and there in 962 AD crowned emperor by the Pope, in return for military protection of the Papacy — which inaugurated the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation. If one likes it can be considered a successor to the empire of Charlemagne, which was the successor of the West Roman Empire.\n\nOf course it didn't really get referred to as the \"first Reich\" until the second Reich came about in the 19th c. And the second Reich didn't recognize Charlemagne as founder of anything really German (he was simply too French by then), so Otto it was.\n\nEven then it's kinda a historical rebranding. The whole \"of the German nation\" came only about very late in the HRE's existence and I think officially there is only one document calling it like that (? might be right, that's what I remember). The idea of the HRE being German is a weird one given that it was inhabited by Danes, Dutch, Flames, Belgian Germans and French, Swiss Germans, French and Italians, Italians, Czechs, Slavonians, Poles, Slovacs, Lithuanians, Latvians and so on aside Germans. The German national (not cultural and linguistic) identity is a 19th century construct and should not be applied to the HRE - also done by the \"new\" Germans post 1871 to legitimize themselves and create a national heritage.\n\nOf course it didn't really get referred to as the \"first Reich\" until the second Reich came about in the 19th c. And the second Reich didn't recognize Charlemagne as founder of anything really German (he was simply too French by then), so Otto it was.\n\nThe terms 'First Reich' and 'Second Reich' were only used after the fall of the 'second'. The concept comes from a book of right-wing, nationalist political philosophy (named, appropriately, The Third Reich) published in the 1920s. The book reads very much like an early Nazi-blueprint, but the author was apparently not a big fan of Hitler - thinking he lacked intellectual sophistication\n\nThe conservative thinks of Germany's Third Empire. Just as the mediaeval empire of our great Germanic emperors lived on in Bismarck's Hohenzollern empire, so the Second Empire will live on in Germany's Third Empire.\n\nThe conservative is fully conscious that history is an inheritance which the peoples of the past hand on to the peoples of the future. But this inheritance must be striven for and won, and won again, that the unity of the great trinity may be perfected; the great trinity of empires of which we know the past and the present ones, while the future one exists as yet only in our dreams.\n\nGermany's Third Empire will come into existence when we will it. But it will live only if it is a new creation, not a slavish copy of the earlier empires.\n\nEmperor -I am sure that you are wrong re Switzerand, The Swiss fought for their independence from Hapsburg Austira-see William Tell .\n\nAnd Germany pre -Bismarrk was dominated by the Austro Hungarian Empire. Netherlands was the Spanish Netherlands colony before the Dutch grabbed their independence from Hapsburg Spain in 1580.-no German connection at all.\n\nBohemia was an independent kingdom for centuries too.\n\nan independentd Kingdom before succumbing to Austrian Hapsburg rule\n\nBelgium was known as the Austrian Netherlands -no German connection here either so your take on Europe's historical Geography and German history is deficient.\n\nThe Hapsburgs wee Spanish /Austrian -not German except by marriage..\n\n.\n\nSwitzerland: Until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 Switzerland was a part of Germany (the same with the Netherlands). You are right that the swiss fought a lot of wars against the Habsburgs in Austria. One example includes, when the they fought against it at a time when it was outlawed, and the german king Sigismund gave them in 1415/1423 the imperial banner (the first one, a white cross on red, not the second with the black double headed eagle on gold). The banner then evolved into the current flag of Switzerland.\n\nAustria-Hungary only exists since 1867.\n\nEven if we ignore the fact, that the Netherlands was part of Germany until 1648 and the southern Netherlands until 1806 - there are places that were part of the Spanish Netherlands (and Austrian Netherlands), that are now part of todays Germany - so how should there be no connection at all?\n\nYou are 100 % right about Bohemia, it was never part of Germany (with the exception of the \"Sudetenland\" after the Munich Agreement - but I see this as illegal), together with Germany, Italy and Burgundy, it was one of the kingdoms which formed the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n@ ShortHistory\n\nIn my opinion, what you should really change in the video, if possible, are the following to points:\n\n1. At the end in the english text (I don't know if it is also the case in the russian one) you write something like that:\n\n\"...the German Empire became one of the most powerful nations in the world.\".\n\nI know it is a mistake native english-speakers often do. Nation =/= Country. You should either write \"...the German Empire became one of the most powerful countries/states in the world.\" or \"...the germans became one of the most powerful nations in the world.\".\n\n2. You say that in 1871 Germany took Alsace and Lorraine. That is not correct. Germany took a part of Lorraine (a medium sized part in the north, most of Lorraine stayed with France) and a part of Alsace (most of it, but a small part stayed with France). The map is also wrong in respect to Lorraine - you highlight the whole region, not the one ceded by France to Germany.\n\n3. You should make it clear that Germany was formed in 1867. After the war of Prussia against Austria, Prussia and the northern german states formed in 1866 a confederation, the North German Federation, but in 1867, this confederation was transformed into a country - Germany (the official name stayed the same - North German Federation). In 1871 Germany simply changed its name from North German Federation to German Reich (like the UK changed its name from United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927) and Baden, Wuerttemberg as well as Bavaria joined Germany (like Texas joined the USA in 1845).\n\nEmperor -I am sure that you are wrong re Switzerand, The Swiss fought for their independence from Hapsburg Austira-see William Tell .\n\nAnd Germany pre -Bismarrk was dominated by the Austro Hungarian Empire. Netherlands was the Spanish Netherlands colony before the Dutch grabbed their independence from Hapsburg Spain in 1580.-no German connection at all.\n\nBohemia was an independent kingdom for centuries too.\n\nan independentd Kingdom before succumbing to Austrian Hapsburg rule\n\nBelgium was known as the Austrian Netherlands -no German connection here either so your take on Europe's historical Geography and German history is deficient.\n\nThe Hapsburgs wee Spanish /Austrian -not German except by marriage..\n\n.\n\nFirst want to clarify to everyone that all of the Holy Roman Empire was the First German Reich, or Germany and that is what Germany meant and what unifications were attempting to recreate. In the 19th century what is now regarded as German unification was seen as \"little Germany\" and us seeing it as something different is really us just choosing to acknowledge Prussian/German propaganda(and like I've said the German Empire was almost twice the size of today's Germany).\n\nThen again we can't really retract that mistake since the entity that actually conquered/brought \"Germany together(Prussia) no longer is part of \"Germany\". So it's not like we can undo that name change and just rename it the Prussian Republic or something and there is no other distinctive name that really accurately describes the make shift collection of former German states. Guess we could have called it the Central European Republic or something and been just as accurate.\n\nHere's my responses to your points.\n\n1)Austria and Switzerland were both part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Hapsburg's were one of many feudal houses with various holdings within the Holy Roman Empire nominally ruled by a separate emperor from one of the other houses, even though the Hapsburgs later became the de facto royal house. What makes the situation more complicated is that the Hapsburgs were actually from Switzerland conquered Austria and then had their original territory(Switzerland) rebel.\n\nIt was dominated by the Austrian Empire(basically the Hapsburgs holdings) for centuries and any German unification was assumed to be under Austrian rule. However the dynamic changed in the century between Frederick making Prussia a great power.\n\n2)Bohemia was not an independent Kingdom after it's initial centuries in existence. It was part of the HRE, even though it was the ONLY part of the HRE prior to Prussia whose ruler was allowed to be styled a King and not an Elector or Duke. This is why I think you're having this misconception. Bohemia was almost always ruled by a House from some other part of Germany though at one point it became united with the Hungarian royal house(which wasn't part of the HRE). Of course non HRE royals could have holdings in the HRE came way the King of England could be a fief to the King of France.\n\nThe Bohemian King was also one of the seven electors(though again the only one to be styled King) who chose a Holy Roman Emperor. So it was not only part of the HRE,it had a distinct status within the HRE. It's funny due to the electoral structure of the HRE, the Hapsburgs hadn't had a vote until they became Kings of Bohemia as Austria was not an electorate.\n\n3)Again you are fundamentally misunderstanding what Germany is. That being said them being an Austrian holding was not the first time the Low Countries had been part of the HRE or even the Hapsburgs.\n\nTo simplify what is a very complicated timeline\n\n1)Low Countries were part of the HRE\n\n2)Burgundian conquest\n\n3)Became a holding of the German House of Hapsburgs after Mary's death\n\n4)Was LEFT to the Spanish House of Hapsburgs after they split when Charles V split up the Hapsburg House\n\n5)Dutch independence. Modern day Belgium remains in Spanish hands.\n\n6)Was given back to the German House of Hapsburgs after the War of Spanish Succession\n\n7)Conquered by Napoleon who later goes on to end the HRE\n\n8)Regains independence after Napoleons ouster\n\n9)Belgian independence from the rest of the Netherlands\n\nSo yes the Low Countries were German and part of the HRE for the lions share of their history, much longer than the Swiss.\n\n3)First off Austrian is German, second off the Hapsburgs actually originated from Switzerland which was also German. Third, almost every royal family has a ton of German blood seeing the nature of how royal marriages worked and how many German nobles there were due to decentralization.\n\nI think you should do more research on the HRE."
