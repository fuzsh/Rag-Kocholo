When it was in German hands it was called Elsass or Alsace, earlier in history it was part of the Elsass-Lothringen.. Presently most of Alsace is on the eastern border and in France next to the Rhine River and across the Rhine River is Germany. The area comprises of Bas-Rhin[e] and Hut-Rhin[e]. The chief cities are Strasbourg, Comar, and Mulhouse. The history is difficult to follow at times because it has been pulled back and forth from French hands to Germans hands. In 870 it was part of the East Franksih Kingdom. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 carried it to French hands by annexations when Louis XIV was king. But not all of the area was annexed, at least not until the French Revolution. It was ceded to Germany and became part of the Lorraine in 1871. The French regained control in 1918. During the Great War [WWI], Germany occupied Alsace area. After the defeat of Germany, Alsace most of Alsace became part of France and has remained so since that time.\n\n..\n\nPLACES IN ALSACE\n\n.\n\nA /B / C / D / E / F / G / H / I / J / K / L / M / N / O / P / Q / R / S / T / U / V / W / X / Y/ Z /\n\n.\n\nA\n\n.\n\nAlsace History. There was a Celtic Alsace until the Roman invaded in 58 BC and established a center for vitculture. When the Roman Empire declined, the territory fell into the hands of the Alemanni people. Realizing the importance of Alsace area, Clovis and the Franks marched into the area in the 5th century...... The grandsons of Charlemagne inhierted part of their grandfather's domain. This created Middle Francia, Lothariingia (Lorraince) and two brothers shared the West Frankish area. In the treaty of Meersen in 870- the region known as Alsace went into the hands of he Holy Roman Empires and was merged with the Duchy of Swabia. Vikings raided Alsace from 889 to 962. Politics, wars, inhertitance squabbles and greed splintered Alsace the Alsace area even more. The 14th centuury was miserable for Alsace area. There were extra cold winters, harvests that failed and rotted, a terrible earthquake and then the Black Sea that eliminated huge numbers of people. The French became agress toward the Alsace area.... The Thirty Years' War interupted the French's desires but rose up again when the war was finsihed. In 1444 the French troops moved into Lorraine and Alsace... In 1469 the Treaty of St. Omer caused Archduke Sigismund of Austria to sell Upper Alsace to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy but Frederick III, the Holy Roman Emperor bought back Upper Alsace in 1477. Despite the Catolic Habsburg's efforts, the Protestant Reformation created many of it's citizens left the Catholic Church and the areas became doted with the new circles who became known as Protestants. The largest group of Protestants were in the southwest of Alsace which was under the rule of Counts of Wuerttemberg. The Franco-Dutch war came the French sovereignty over the area, again. The French Revolution changed borders.... As the Germans fled, the French confiscated lands as they moved and occupied areas.... There were two large waves of Germans who migrated to Austria-Hungary and/or Russia. 1794 Germans who settled in Catherine II \"the Great's\" Russia area along the Volga became known as the Volga German-Russians. In 1804-5 and 1809 migrated to the Black Sea area (New Russia) under Alexander I. Conditions in the French controled Alsace were not a place where the Protestants wanted to remain. And, the lack of good crops caused hunger... In 1843 and 1844 ships were sailing to New York, USA filled with Alsatian.... 1870 to 1871 was the Franco-Prussian War. The Prussians came out the victors and boders changed, again. Elsass-Lothringen was created..\n\nAlsace-Lorraine: Created by the German Empire after it annexed most of the Alsace and the Moselle region of Lorraine after the Pranco-Prussian War.\n\nWWI borders changed. Treaty of Versailes cause Germans to lose Alsace to France (1919-1940)\n\n1940 to 1944 the Nazi Germany invaded Alsace and took control. Having lost the war, the Germans lost Alsace and in 1945 became part of France and has remained under the French rule.\n\n.\n\nAdditional History.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nClick and go to larger map, see list of Dept. and towns......\n\nThe Karl Stumpp Book (The Emigration from Germany to Russia in the Years 1763 to 1862) lists the following \"Kantons\" from which German migr. to Russia.

It is Selestat in French, Schestatt in Alsatian and or Schlettstadt in in German.\n\nChateaiu di Jait-Koenigsbourg is west of Selestat in the town of Orschwiller in the Vosges mountants. It overlooks the Alsatian plain. Since the original owner is unk nown, it is believed to have been built about 1147 and the name indicates that it was a German King's castle by 1192. Around the turn of the 1200s the castle came into the pocession of the Hohenstaufen House, who were by then the Dukes of Lorraine, who gave the duties of protection of this castle to the Ratsamhausen family who did so until it was attacked and bured in 1462. Thiersteins was given the castle who started the rebuilding in 1479.... The castle became part of the system of defense and the military's artillery was placed here. When the last Thierstein male died, it came into the hands of Maximillian I, Emp. of the oly Roman Empire in 1517. During the Thirty Years' War, the Swdish army lay siege for 52 days and it was left abandoned and became hidden in the forest... The hidden castle was fodder for poets and romantic authors. Emp. Wilhelm II restored the castle in the early 1900s (1900 to 1908). It was Bodo Ebhart, who's duty was to restore this historical castle, to return it to it's beauty before the Thirty Years' War. As often happens, Ebhart was subjected to Wilhelm II's family and the history of the Hohenzollern may be \"overly exmpasized\". In WW I, the French state confiscated the castle. As often happens with enemies, they tend to down play the role of the Hohenzollerns and the castle became a place to mock. But, historians have won and the castle has become a \"monument Historique\". Today, it attracts tourist from all over the world.\n\nFreiburg is in the bottom right had corner of the map.

This area was one part of German but presently it is part of the northeastern part of France. Hisory. According to one article I read, it is a \"...little, rustic village \"; the history is easy to miss\" and known because of the German Johann Wolfang von Goethe, who fell in love with the local pastor's daughter\". Goethe was from `770 to 1771 a student in Strasbourg and spent a lot of time in Sessenheim during that years. See Alsace Section\n\nAnna Maria Metzger b. poss. Sessenheim / Hagenau, Alsace m.

Bischweiler is west and slightly south. History. It is known for it's pottery. It has been discovered tha molds date back to 400 B.C.. In 1147 Emperor Frederich I \"Barbarossa\" gave the potters of Soufflenheim the right to extract clay from the clay pit in Haguenau forest, which was part of the Emperors hunting grounds and this right continues up to the present. Accrdig to legend, a potter save the Emperor from a large boar. This could be \"Sufflenheim\" mention in Sufflenheim / Bischeiler, Alsace where the Buerger family is said to have originated. It is interesting --to me-- that Alsatian is still spoken here as well s most of Alsace. Alsatian is \"Low Alemannic German\" which is related to German spoiken by Swiss Germans, Swabian and Badisch (Baden area).\n\nFriedrich Buerger migr. in 1817 It is believed the Buerger family. migr. from Sufflenheim / Bischweiler, Alsace to Heilbronn / Ku (Caucasus) They did not come from Heilbronn/ Wu See Soufflenheim.\n\n+++++++++++++ Catharine Burger in 1830 migrated with her husband, Antony Kieffer, from Soufflenheim , Alsace to East Eden, Eire County, New York, USA.
