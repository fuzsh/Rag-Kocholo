        "text": "Itinerary\n\nDay 1 – DEPARTURE\n\nBoard your flight from your home destination to Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nThis itinerary assumes this to be an overnight flight.\n\nAir fare independently arranged.\n\nDay 2 – WELCOME TO ZURICH AND ALSACE\n\nArrival in ZURICH, Switzerland. At 12 noon we depart from the airport and head first into France, to your hotel in Alsace which will be your home for the next three nights.\n\nAlsace was fought over for centuries by France and Germany, and owned by both for extended periods. The culture is a unique but predictable resulting blend. Today, the region presents only a peaceful aspect, with pastel-painted villages, fortified towns, and sleepy vineyards.\n\nRest in the afternoon, begin exploring the town, or just take it easy.\n\nTonight you'll meet your travelling companions and tour director and enjoy a great welcome dinner.\n\n> Your tour includes: Your tour includes: Transfer from airport to hotel, three-course dinner with menu choice, including one beverage and coffee or tea after dinner, hotel in Alsace\n\nAlsace\n\nDay 3 – CASTLE HAUT-KOENIGSBOURG, ALSATIAN WINE ROUTE\n\nSince its construction in the 12th century, the HAUT-KOENIGSBOURG CASTLE at Orschwiller in Alsace has been a constant witness to both European conflicts and rivalry between lords, kings and emperors.\n\nA number of illustrious owners each left their mark on the castleâs history, and successive events even led to changes in the castleâs structure. Enjoy a tour of this magnificent castle with its majestic architecture and its incredible view across the Alsatian plain.\n\nWe continue on the ALSATIAN WINE ROUTE, stopping in villages along the way, each of them offering a delightful picture postcard setting and some the best examples of Alsatian architecture.\n\n> Buffet breakfast, door-to-door transportation, entrance fees, wine tasting, three-course dinner, hotel in Alsace\n\nCastle Haut-Koenigsbourg\n\nDay 4 – STRASBOURG AND COLMAR\n\nThis morning we drive into France to visit STRASBOURG, seat of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. Join your guide for a walking tour of the old town and visit the Cathedral of Notre Dame. The 142-metre (466-foot) spire is a masterpiece of architectural elegance and intricacy. We also visit La Petite France, the most picturesque district of old Strasbourg, with magnificent half-timbered houses that date from the 16th and 17th centuries. Fishermen, millers and tanners once lived and worked in this part of town where the streets have been built level with the waterways.\n\nWe continue to COLMAR in the heart of Alsace. Colmar's Germanic and French architectural heritage was spared by the frequent wars that ravaged this area. The town has preserved the charm of its romantic districts (Tannerâs District, Little Venice). Enjoy your guided tour of the old town, which also includes a visit to the Bartholdi museum, housed in a vast residence which was the birthplace of the creator of New York's Statue of Liberty, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Auguste Bartholdi.\n\nDinner tonight in France.\n\n> Buffet breakfast, door-to-door transportation, entrance fees, tours in Strasbourg and Colmar, services of local guides, three-course dinner, hotel in Alsace\n\nColmar\n\nDay 5 – FREIBURG, BREISACH, WINE CELLAR TOUR\n\nThis morning go for a stroll around the old city of FREIBURG with your guide. Walk the main streets and squares, its small streams (BÃ¤chle) and lanes with the colourful mosaics made of Rhine pebbles, the Cathedral Square (MÃ¼nsterplatz) with its merchant town houses and secular buildings, the colourful farmers and trader market, and get to know the city's very long history. A tour of the Gothic cathedral with its wealth of medieval treasures forms the highlight of the tour.\n\nVisit the winery Badische Winzergenossenschaft, the largest of its kind in Europe, explore their wine cellars, and enjoy some wine tasting.\n\nContinue to BREISACH for a stroll along the Rhine River and a visit of the town, followed by dinner.\n\nThen we cross the Rhine and head to beautiful LAKE TITISEE in the Black Forest for two nights.\n\n> Buffet breakfast, door-to-door transportation, service of local guide, three course dinner, hotel at Lake Titisee\n\nFreiburg\n\nDay 6 – HOHENZOLLERN AND LICHTENSTEIN CASTLES\n\nToday visit two of Germany's most beautiful castles, both rising majestically from atop the Swabian Hills. First we go to HOHENZOLLERN CASTLE for an inside guided tour. King Frederick William IV. of Prussia had it reconstructed between 1846 and 1867. The bastions and towers offer a breathtaking panorama over the countryside, and the splendid halls and rooms offer lots of valuable works of art pertaining to the history of PrussiaÂ´s Kings and Germany's emperors.\n\nWe continue to LICHTENSTEIN CASTLE. The first castle was built here in 1200 but it was destroyed twice, in 1311 and in 1381. Lichtenstein Castle evolved into its present glorious appearance when it passed to King Frederick I of WÃ¼rttemberg's nephew, the Duke Wilhelm of Urach. Its new owner ordered the castle's reconstruction and that was carried out between 1840 and 1842 by architect Carl Alexander Heideloff. Today Lichtenstein Castle is still owned by the Dukes of Urach, but it is open to the public. Enjoy breathtaking scenery from the hilltop.\n\nDinner tonight in the country in the heart of the Black Forest.\n\n> Buffet breakfast, door-to-door transportation, entrance fees, three-course dinner, hotel at Lake Titisee\n\nLichtenstein Castle\n\nDay 7 – RHINE FALLS, LUCERNE, SWITZERLAND\n\nToday it is goodbye to Germany and the Black Forest as we cross the border into Switzerland. We stop in Schaffhausen to see the largest waterfalls in Europe, the RHINE FALLS, where in summer 600,000 liters of water falls down 23 meters (75 feet) every second.\n\nWe continue to LUCERNE, this most beautiful city at the foot of the Swiss Alps on fabulous Lake Lucerne. See the Lion Monument (the famous dying Lion of Lucerne), walk the wooden Chapel Bridge and join your guide for a stroll of the old town.\n\nLater shop for something really Swiss â chocolate, watches or army knives â or stroll along the Lake this afternoon.\n\nTonight look forward to a typical Swiss dinner in town, on your own.\n\n> Buffet breakfast, door-to-door transportation, visits at Rhine Falls and Lucerne, hotel on Lake Lucerne\n\nLucerne\n\nDay 8 – LUCERNE, MOUNT PILATUS\n\nThis morning be prepared for incredible views as you climb up MOUNT PILATUS by cogwheel train, the steepest in the world. From the top enjoy endless views of the mountains and plains and lakes below. Time for a Swiss hot chocolate before we return downhill on the other side of the mountain by cable car.\n\nBack in LUCERNE you have the afternoon free to spend at your leisure. Maybe go for a cruise on Lake Lucerne, visit the Swiss Museum of Transport or one of the many Art Galleries, go hiking in the stunning surroundings or just enjoy time in or on the Lake and relax, or to get your final shopping done.\n\nTonight be prepared for lots of fun at a Swiss Folklore Farewell Dinner.\n\n> Buffet breakfast, door-to-door transportation, cogwheel train and cable car rides, three-course dinner with show, hotel on Lake Lucerne\n\nLake Lucerne from Mount Pilatus\n\nDay 9 – HOME FROM ZURICH\n\nTime to say \"Auf wiedersehen\". One final breakfast and then a complimentary transfer to Zurich Airport for your return flight home.\n\nIf your flight is leaving earlier then 10.30 a.m. we can arrange for an alternative transfer at your expense.\n\n> Buffet breakfast, transfer to Airport\n\nChristmas Tour\n\nThe Christmas version of this tour â Black Forest, Alsace and Switzerland - Castles, Scenery, Wine and Christmas Markets of the Three Corners â has the same route and accommodation arrangements as the regular season version.\n\nIt visits almost all the major destination features of the regular tour. We can't go to Lichtenstein Castle, but we substitute a scenic drive through the Black Forest and a stop for Black Forest Cherry Cake on a lake. And we use cable cars both ways for our trip up Mount Pilatus.\n\nBut this Christmas version of the tour adds visits to charming Christmas Markets in Freiburg, Strasbourg, Colmar, and Lucerne. Take in the sights. Join in the festivities. Shop if you wish, or just window-shop. Soak up the atmosphere. Soak up some glÃ¼hwein too!\n\nWe pass along savings from travel in the off-peak season to help your shopping budget.\n\nWe've prepared a separate itinerary just for this trip:\n\nComplete printable Christmas Tour itinerary in PDF format >\n\nBlack Forest, Alsace and Switzerland - Castles, Scenery, Wine and Christmas Markets of the Three Corners\n\nThis is one of our Christmas tours. We also offer two tours on our Christmas Markets page and a Christmas version of our Berlin and the East of Germany tour."
