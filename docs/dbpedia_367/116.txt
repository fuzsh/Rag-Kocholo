Here is my list of must-see films from each genre, listed chronologically, from 1900–2000. I made this list for a friend who wanted to watch the classic movies from each category to gain a solid foundation on cinema history. For functional purposes, I have combined some film types/genres into one category. If a film is italicized, that means it is cross-listed. If a film is in bold, that means it is a personal favorite of mine. If it is not in bold, that does not necessarily mean I dislike the film—it simply means that it did not make it to my all-time favorites. This list is by no means comprehensive, but I tried to narrow it down to the classic films in each genre. Not all films are necessarily aesthetically “good,” but if they are important for the genre, then I included it. For instance, Birth of a Nation is not a particularly good film by modern standards, but it is important in the development and evolution of cinema history, so it has to be in there. Some categories deserve their own genre, but they were combined because they were too small on their own. For instance, since there are just a few films from the Czech New Wave, those films have been assimilated into other categories. Additionally, subgenres of drama, such as “road films” or “coming-of-age” films, were assimilated into the larger categories. Similarly, if a film fits into multiple categories, I tried to prioritize its categorical membership. For instance, an action film might also fit into the New Hollywood genre, but if it is more of an example of the action genre, it is probably not cross-listed. In other words, I had to make some subjective choices. Most film titles are in English, although if a film is commonly referred to in its original language, I kept it that way. As all categories are ultimately meaningless, I had to make some difficult decisions for many films for functionality’s sake. I am sure I have forgotten some films, but I tried my best to make a solid list from cinema around the world. What essential films have I missed? Let me know and I will add them.
