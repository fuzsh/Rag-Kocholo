        "text": "Vienna has more English-language cinemas than many British and US cities (I made that fact up, but it feels plausible).\n\nIf you do want to catch the latest Hollywood blockbuster or arthouse release, you should have few problems.\n\nMany movie theatres specialise entirely in English-language films\n\nLook for the abbreviations OV, OmU or OmdU\n\n…all mean shown in the original language\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat to do in Vienna\n\nSuggestions for the evenings\n\nFilm festivals\n\nInternational cinema\n\nThe number of screens showing films without dubbing is only partly due to Vienna’s large international community and visiting tourists.\n\nMany locals want to watch films in English; partly to improve their language skills and partly because their English is often good enough for them to enjoy the movie as it was intended.\n\nAs a result, even German-language cinemas may have the occasional showing in English. However, several places specialise in original-language film.\n\nFor popular, mainstream movies, try these English cinemas:\n\nThe Haydn Kino\n\n(The cinema we go to most)\n\nThis is where my family go to watch the latest films. The Haydn sits on one of the main shopping streets, close to the Haydn monument. Reach it easily on the U3 subway line. The area is full of restaurants and snack bars (including a McDonald’s).\n\nThe Haydn also has numerous specials, such as:\n\nLive performances of opera, theatre and similar. La Traviata anyone?\n\nScreenings around events or individuals. For example, Love Actually at Christmas or Barbie on International Women’s Day\n\nSing-a-longs to films like Mama Mia! and Grease\n\nAddress: Mariahilfer Straße 57, 1060 Vienna | Website\n\nArtis International\n\n(Conveniently located in the very centre of town)\n\nPart of the Cineplexx chain and the most central of the English cinemas, slap bang in the middle of the old town between the famous Ankeruhr and Judenplatz (which has the Jewish Museum and Holocaust Memorial).\n\nAddress: Schultergasse 5, 1010 Vienna | Website\n\nThe Burg Kino\n\n(Home to showings of The Third Man)\n\nAnother central one, close to the grand old Kunsthistorisches Museum. This cinema also does regular specials, such as Austrian and international films with English subtitles, vintage screenings or discussion evenings.\n\nMost importantly, the Burg shows The Third Man every week.\n\nThis 1949 Oscar-winning movie based (and filmed) in Vienna is worth seeing for the locations alone. They didn’t have to build any sets for the war-torn outdoor shots: they just filmed the reality of the post-WWII city.\n\nFor further The Third Man experiences, check out my extensive location guide (with photos), the dedicated museum and the themed sewer tour.\n\nAddress: Opernring 19, 1010 Vienna | Website\n\nAd:\n\nOther English-language cinemas\n\nFor less mainstream English-language movies, try the list below. When browsing, look for these abbreviations:\n\nOV: Originalversion – original version. This means it’s shown in the original language the film was made in\n\nOmU: Original mit Untertitel – original with subtitles. So the same as OV, but showings feature subtitles (usually meaning subtitles in German)\n\nOmdU: Original mit deutschem Untertitel. As OmU but making it very clear the film’s subtitles are in German\n\nOmeU: Original mit englischem Untertitel – original with English subtitles. Again, the same as OV but subtitles are in English\n\n(A movie’s original language may, of course, be something other than English.)\n\n(The Votiv Kino. Also home to, for example, the Festival du Film Francophone)\n\nThe first three cinemas in this list are relatively central, being close to (or on) the Ring boulevard that surrounds the old town:\n\nVotiv Kino (often participates in film festivals so look out for special showings)\n\nWähringerstarsse 12 (9th district) | Website\n\nDe France\n\nSchottenring 5 (1st district) | Website (shared with the Votiv Kino)\n\nGartenbaukino (possibly the most prestigious address)\n\nParkring 12 (1st district) | Website\n\nFilmcasino (another film festival favourite)\n\nMargaretenstraße 78 (5th district) | Website\n\nShikaneder\n\nMargaretenstraße 24 (4th district)| Website\n\nTop Kino\n\nRahlgasse 1 (6th district) | Website\n\nFilm festivals\n\nVienna also hosts various international film festivals and film events, many featuring movies in English (with subtitles) or movies in other languages with English subtitles.\n\nAnd finally…\n\nFor the record, the German for cinema is Kino.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, some local cinemas also have the occasional showing in English. If you’re checking listings in a paper or outside a movie theater, look out for these abbreviations given above that tell you about languages and subtitles.\n\nFor more English-language culture, note that opera houses, theatres, etc. in Vienna often now have English subtitles either above the stage, available through an app, or appearing on a small screen at your seat.\n\nOh…and enjoy your popcorn."
