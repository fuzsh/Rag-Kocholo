        "text": "1. GENRE & SUBGENRES L/O: to be able to identify film genres & subgenres and explain their meanings with key terms\n\n2. GENRE • What is this?\n\n3. GENRE • Category, kind sort etc • A way to categorize films\n\n4. Genre Purpose (horror) • ALL GENRES HAVE A PURPOSE – example horror: • To frighten/disgust the audience • Create negative emotional reactions by playing on audience’s – primal fears and vulnerabilities – Terror of unknown – Fear of death/injury • Startle the viewer (key scenes) • Cause dread or alarm • Invoke worst hidden fears • Yet…..Captivate and entertain!\n\n5. FILM GENRE • Copy and complete…. (as many as you can) FILM GENRE PURPOSE OF GENRE FILM EXAMPLES Drama\n\n6. Something to ponder….. -How do you know the films fit under a specific genre? -What makes them that genre?\n\n7. Basic film genres (13) GENRE EXAMPLES DRAMA My Sister’s Keeper COMEDY Bridesmaids ACTION/ADVENTURE The Terminator ANIMATION Monsters Inc ROMANCE The Notebook FOREIGN/WORLD Pan’s Labyrinth SCI-FI Alien HORROR Saw THRILLER Paranormal Activity MUSICAL Sound of Music WAR/HISTORICAL Saving Private Ryan CRIME The Godfather DOCUMENTARY Catfish FAMILY Mary Poppins\n\n8. SUBGENRE • What do you think this means?\n\n9. SUBGENRES • Sub-genres are genres that combine or share elements or characteristics of multiple genres. • Sub-genres seem inevitable that films (and genre) are ever changing and evolving; they don’t stay the same • They develop their OWN familiar codes/conventions/elements/characteristics to make meaning to an audience – There are many reasons for this = Why do you think? • Example: THRILLERS (which are made to create intense thrill, suspense, anticipation and excitement on audience) – There are different TYPES of thrillers….action thrillers, sci-fi thrillers, crime thrillers • DISASTER (natural/weather, alien, creature, accident, planets/apocalyptic, criminal/terrorist,disease/zombie .\n\n10. SUBGENRE GENRES NEW SUBGENRE EXAMPLE COMEDY ROMANCE/COMEDY (ROM-COM) Bridget Jones Something about Mary DRAMA DRAMA + ACTION = DISASTER 2012 Day After Tomorrow HORROR COMEDY/HORROR Piranha Shawn of the Dead THRILLER THRILLER/SUPERNATURAL Paranormal Activity The Others When you combine 2 genres together\n\n11. Hybrid • Word? • What do you think this means in terms of film?\n\n12. Hybrid • Word = mixture or fusion (example hybrid cars are a combination of petrol/electric) • What do you think this means in terms of film? 3 or more genres or mixtures of subgenres\n\n13. HYBRID GENRES NEW SUBGENRE HYBRID EXAMPLE COMEDY ROMANCE/COMEDY (ROM-COM) ROMANCE COMEDY BRITISH Bridget Jones DRAMA DRAMA/ACTION = DISASTER DRAMA ACTION NATURAL DISASTER Sweeney Todd Rocky Horror Picture Show HORROR COMEDY/HORROR COMEDY HORROR ZOMBIE PARODY Shawn of the Dead FAMILY FAMILY/ROMANCE FAMILY ROMANCE SCI-FI THRILLER Avatar ACTION ACTION/KUNG FU ACTION KUNG FU THRILLER WESTERN Kill Bill When you combine 3 genres together\n\n14. Conventions • what do you think film conventions are? • If something is conventional it means…..?\n\n15. Codes and conventions • Codes are systems of signs, which create meaning. Codes can be divided into two categories – technical and symbolic: – Technical codes are all the ways in which equipment is used to tell the story in a media text, for example the camera work in a film. – Symbolic codes show what is beneath the surface of what we see. For example, a character's actions show you how the character is feeling. – Some codes fit both categories – music for example, is both technical and symbolic. Codes can be divided into two categories – technical and symbolic: CONVENTIONS Conventions are the generally accepted ways of doing something. OR FEATURES THAT ARE GENERALLY EXPECTED/FAMILIAR. There are general conventions in any medium, such as the use of interviewee quotes in a print article, but conventions are also genre specific. How codes and conventions apply in media studies Codes and conventions are used together in any study of genre – it is not enough to discuss a technical code used such as camera work, without saying how it is conventionally used in a genre. For example, the technical code of lighting is used in some way in all film genres. It is a convention of the horror genre that side and back lighting is used to create mystery and suspense – an integral part of any horror movie.\n\n16. Genre & Conventions - Horror • Familiarity causes agreement/understanding • Conventions function as agreement between: author + audience (for what to expect in a genre) • In a survey, the horror genre had the most agreed components than any other genre – Sense of horror – Normal situations turning into death situations – Blood & gore – Weapons – Murder/killing – Action – Presence of supernatural • Iconic symbols of horror: – Haunted house – Unknown creatures – Dark places – Flashing images QUESTION: Why do film conventions in a genre or subgenre change over time? These icons still exist in modern films but they evolve over time according to the era and audience (what terrified an audience 10 years ago does not terrify one now as the world is different)\n\n17. Convention questions Read the following questions and discuss in groups (3 mins) • Why do conventions become predictable in film? • What happens when conventions become predictable? • Why do conventions have to be predictable? • Yet, why do they have to adapt and evolve?\n\n18. Change with subgenre A paranormal horror will have different conventions from a slasher horror as their purposes are different. • i.e. Zombie horror – Hero trying to save human race – Overgrown/rough settings to illustrate abondonment – Survival theme – etc\n\n19. Can you name conventions? • Let’s think of disaster-thriller film genre…. Disaster-thriller film conventions: • . • . • . • . Advice: think of all 4 categories for tv drama exam\n\n20. Conventions checklist • Think of a range of factors with conventions • Plot • Theme • Character types • Setting/location • Music/sounds • Camera shots/angles • Special effects • Editing techniques • Narrative structure (the way the story is presented/structured)\n\n21. Homework (Due next Mon) • Title: Assignment 1: Genre Exploration Task • Format: Computer – powerpoint or other presentation program (present to class) • In pairs • 1 week to complete, save on Office 365 or USB\n\n22. Task • Choose a partner (wisely) • Choose a subgenre from hat • Do research on subgenre • Watch some clips/trailers too • Choose 3 films as examples • After research, decide and record conventions of the subgenre • Complete worksheet together • Then construct a powerpoint to present to class • Slide 1: title page with names • 2: name of subgenre • 3: 3 or more films in the subgenre • 4: explanation of the conventions with screen shots from films"
