        "text": "The BA (Hons) in English combines the traditional core elements of the British literary canon with comprehensive offerings of Asian literature and culture, new literatures in English and film and theatre studies, as well as incorporating contemporary literary and cultural studies. Thus, while the degree retains canonical core elements, particularly in the Period Studies category, it also reflects a breadth of interests that is relevant both regionally and globally, and embraces many of the key areas that comprise contemporary literary studies. In addition, the degree is structured to allow the possibility of a range of specialisations within the degree itself. As such, once a student fulfils the basic requirements of the degree, they are then entitled to specialise exclusively, if they wish, in any of the specific categories.\n\nThe curriculum is designed as a four-year course. Well-prepared students can complete the degree in a shorter period by taking more courses during the semester and/or attending inter-semestral sessions.\n\nA.
