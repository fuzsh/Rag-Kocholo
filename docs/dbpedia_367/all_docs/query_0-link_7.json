        "text": "I'm from Canada, but live in the States now.\n\nIt took me a while to get used to writing boolean variables with an \"Is\" prefix, instead of the \"Eh\" suffix that Canadians use when programming.\n\nFor example:\n\nMyObj.IsVisible MyObj.VisibleEh\n\nI'm from Egypt. I think we switch to English by default when we talk, or even think about code. Most of the learning resources - regular ones like books, and even blogs, podcasts and so on - are in English. Switching to your mother tongue means turning your back to lots of great resources.\n\nI guess this post might convey my point, via Jeff Atwood: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/the-ugly-american-programmer.html\n\nSpain has a traditional problem with foreign languages. Spaniards younger than 40 are supposed to know English from school but the plain fact is that the level of English is close to zero almost everywhere.\n\nSo there're basically two type of software environments: code that's supposed to be shared with international parties (open source projects, Spanish offices of foreign multinationals, vendors who sell abroad) and code that's sold locally. The former is of course written in English but the latter is normally written in Spanish, both variable names and documentation. Words in variables lose accents and tildes as required to fit into 7-bit ASCII (dirección -> direccion) and English bits may be used when they represent a standard language feature (getDireccion) or a concept without an universally accepted translation (abrirSocket).\n\nIt happens that the Spanish word for year (año) becomes the word for anus when you remove the tilde. I don't have any problem with writing ano but most other programmers avoid it at any cost and produce all sort of funny alternatives like anno or anyo :)\n\nSome samples:\n\n/** * Devuelve una cadena aleatoria de la longitud indicada elegidos entre la lista proporcionada; * contempla caracteres multi-byte */ function mb_cadena_aleatoria($longitud=16, $caracteres='0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'){ // v2010-06-03 $cadena = ''; $max = mb_strlen($caracteres)-1; for($i=0; $i<$longitud; $i++){ $cadena .= mb_substr($caracteres, mt_rand(0, $max), 1); } return $cadena; } /* * Da formato a un número para su visualización * * numero (Number o String) - Número que se mostrará * decimales (Number, opcional) - Nº de decimales (por defecto, auto) * separador_decimal (String, opcional) - Separador decimal (por defecto, coma) * separador_miles (String, opcional) - Separador de miles (por defecto, ninguno) */ function formato_numero(numero, decimales, separador_decimal, separador_miles){ // v2007-08-06 numero=parseFloat(numero); if(isNaN(numero)){ return \"\"; } if(decimales!==undefined){ // Redondeamos numero=numero.toFixed(decimales); } // Convertimos el punto en separador_decimal numero=numero.toString().replace(\".\", separador_decimal!==undefined ? separador_decimal : \",\"); if(separador_miles){ // Añadimos los separadores de miles var miles=new RegExp(\"(-?[0-9]+)([0-9]{3})\"); while(miles.test(numero)) { numero=numero.replace(miles, \"$1\" + separador_miles + \"$2\"); } } return numero; }\n\nIn France, many people tend to code using French objects/methods/variables names if they work with non English speaking colleagues. However, it is really depends on your environment.\n\nThe thumb rule is 'the more skilled people you are working / the projects you are working on are, the more likely it is that it is going to be in English'/\n\nIt seems to be the same in Germany.\n\nI'm form Quebec and I saw a lot of programmers prefer to code in English. I got a good quote for you.\n\nLet them program in English and you will see they don't know English.\n\nSo you could find gems like :\n\n//putting the conter to 0 i=0\n\nIn clear, it's better to code in your native language if you don't master the target language. otherwise, it's just obfuscate the code.\n\nI am from England, and I try to code (and post on sites like Stack Overflow) in US English, because that is the established international language for programming.\n\nI think I am in the minority though. Some British programmers I know insist on using British spellings even when collaborating with other coders who are using US English and can get upset when an American or Indian colleague edits their comments to change from British to US English (don't try that on Ward's wiki.)\n\nI live and work in the Netherlands, but all the code we write is in English. Here are some reasons I can think of why we code in English:\n\nThe .NET framework we work with is in English. It's always better to follow conventions of the framework you're working with and I believe this includes the language.\n\nDutch is a horrible language for describing technical concepts. English has words that can accurately describe something technical, e.g. a piece of software, but many of these words have no Dutch equivalent. The word \"interact\" is an example of this; there's no commonly used Dutch word that conveys the same message.\n\nA small percentage of the company doesn't speak Dutch (yet).\n\nThe only reason I can think of why you would not code in English, is in the context of domain-driven design. Practicing DDD includes defining a ubiquitous language with your client. If your client demands the use of non-English terms, it would be unwise to translate these terms to English in your code; it defeats the purpose of the ubiquitous language.\n\nI'm from Germany and I write my class, method, variable names all in english and I think most of the people do this as well. But in comments it depends on whom I'm working with.\n\nAnd I have to admit if I see code written in some other language than english I really hate it cause you can't \"read the code\". It's like if someone would write a sentence in german mixed with english.\n\nA other reason you definitely should use english when coding is that API calls and language specific calls are always written in english. So why switching languages? I would even say using english helps you thinking cause you don't have to switch languages.\n\nAlso all those documentations and most questions and answers on the internet are in english so IMO you HAVE TO work in english anyway.\n\nOne example I think it is horrible to see is\n\nmeinObst = \"Apfel;Himbeere;Traube\" meinGeteiltesObst = meinObst.split(\";\") for obst in meinGeteiltesObst: ...\n\nYou absolutely can see it in the for statement you are switching from one language to an other and that's not a good thing IMO.\n\nI'm from Denmark.\n\nCode, documentation, naming, design documents etc. is all done in English. I have only ever seen otherwise in hobbyist and student projects - and even then only very rarely.\n\nThe only open question that I see is what to do about (potentially) user-visible strings:\n\nwindow.setHeader(\"????\"); throw new ThisMightBeSeenByTheUserInAnErrorMessageException(\"????\");\n\nFor exceptions I prefer using English messages. It looks better and you have to deal with English exception-messages from frameworks anyway.\n\nFor GUI texts I am more agnostic. It is a more elegant solution to write everything in English and use a localization solution to translate to Danish, but it is a lot of work for an application that will only ever be used by Danish users.\n\nI'm Italian. I usually use English for everything(*), but when I was writing web stuff I couldn't manage to use English for database objects. Having to translate concepts between a \"program language\" and a \"documentation/URL/UI/customer language\" adds too much burden. Besides, sometimes your database objects take their names from bureaucratic terms that are hard or impossible to translate. So I used Italian for database objects and anything related to that. Comments were also in Italian, since they refer to those same objects and it would sound awkward (many English technical words do not exist in Italian, but DB is a field where the lexicon is pretty complete).\n\nHowever, when I wrote class libraries meant to be reused, I strictly used English, for all of classes, variables, and comments (except maybe the toplevel comment, which had code samples and was bilingual).\n\n(*) one exception: I consistently name my dummy variables pippo and pluto (\"Goofy\" and \"Pluto\") rather than foo and bar. :)\n\nI am currently in the Netherlands, but coming from Russia originally. 11 years ago, many programmers in Russia didn't have a good command of English, hence the comments were often in Russian. Variable names and function methods were still in English, or what people thought was English, simply because corresponding Russian words tend to be long, and sometimes seem to obscure the sense. Now it's probably like everywhere: the more professional people are, the more the chance that their comments are in English.\n\nIn the Netherlands, I have seen Dutch comments and variable / method names in the company where the majority of the programmers were Dutch (such companies do exist:) ) But it was the only case.\n\nBy the way, the question 'Did you know the Latin alphabet until you came to the West' used to annoy me, until I have learned to laugh at it:)\n\nI came to US less than a decade ago and English is not my first language. Even though I learned how to read and write English in school, I did not speak English reasonably well until I got married to someone who did not speak my language. Well, English was not her first language as well but we found it was easier to use English to communicate than trying to learn each others language. I think the same holds for programming too. If everyone expressed their ideas in their own language, the knowledge would become too scattered. Should English be mandatory? Probably not. Most people wouldn't need it. My family was mostly farmers and most of them would never need to know English to lead a useful life. I wouldn't say successful life because it has different meanings in different parts of the world.\n\nI don't wish to enter a holy war but English in programming may have nothing to do with 'Ugly American' programmer. It may just be a convenient way to collaborate for people speaking different languages. It could have been any language. May be in the future we will code and comment in Chinese. If that happens it probably wouldn't be because of 'Ugly Chinese' programmers, rather it would be because more people in more countries use Chinese to communicate with outsiders.\n\nEven for personal projects I tend to use English mostly because it's easier to ask questions about the code on Stack Overflow or other websites. The same goes for my operating system - I only use English. I had a Dutch operating system once, and it's really horrible to google for errors or information.\n\nThere is one advantage of coding in another language and that is that you most likely won't run into conflicting or reserved words."
