        "text": "ON THIS PAGE ShowHide\n\nAP News Taxonomy\n\nAP News Taxonomy is a classification system for English-language news content that includes standardized subjects, geographic locations, people, organizations and publicly traded companies. This search- and SEO-friendly taxonomy is designed to support digital news products. Each tag includes a relevance score that can be used to filter tags or sort stories in your systems. Only the most salient and relevant tags are returned to make it easier for you to discover AP content and to use it in your own production systems.\n\nAP Classification system automatically enriches news content with all the relevant metadata tags from the News Taxonomy.\n\nAccurate and relevant metadata tags. AP Classification of news content goes well beyond mere text extraction; it uses a hybrid approach to concept and entity tagging, leveraging a deep knowledge graph for better domain targeting, as well as human-created context-aware semantic rules that understand the content and identify the most pertinent entities and topics. Only the tags that truly describe the content are returned, along with their relevance scores. The AP Classification system not only recognizes and returns specific entities that it finds in the content, but also uses human-created semantic rules to identify topics that may not be explicitly mentioned in the text at all. For example, a story about a particular country music star can trigger the \"Country music\" subject, even if the word \"music\" does not appear in the story.\n\nFrequent, timely metadata updates. AP metadata is continuously updated to capture the latest news and the biggest newsmakers. Whether itâs this weekâs IPOs or the new crop of college athletes, APâs taxonomy developers are always working to keep the vocabularies current and relevant.\n\nAP Subject\n\nAP Subject is a set of topics geared toward news coverage, ranging from broad categories (for example, Education) to specific concepts (for example, School curricula), including relevant, timely topics, such as Activism, Diversity, Equity and inclusion, and Wellness. Only subjects that directly match the content are returned; broader topics are not returned unless they also match the content directly.\n\nAP Subject also includes many named events; for example, Academy Awards and Tour de France, as well as breaking news events as they happen. Events that drop out of the news cycle and seem unlikely to return are reviewed and deprecated on a rolling basis.\n\nValue\n\nID (GUID)\n\nBusiness\n\nc8e409f8858510048872ff2260dd383e\n\nClimate and environment\n\n8783d248894710048286ba0a2b2ca13e\n\nEducation\n\n1af99ec3cb954ff4b349b32d60d0376d\n\nEntertainment\n\n16cb0ba3e6d24d97ace39f5a1924669a\n\nGeneral news\n\nf25af2d07e4e100484f5df092526b43e\n\nU.S. news\n\na4677d70863b4012b846a1b00f5079f5\n\nWorld news\n\nbb2d2c5f441a452cb24bb511a2ab5eea\n\nWashington news\n\nabfca78268874726966cdad8c35c4ae3\n\nHealth\n\ncc7a76087e4e10048482df092526b43e\n\nLifestyle\n\n3e37e4b87df7100483d5df092526b43e\n\nMedia\n\nc188eb1088be10048dceb097165a0203\n\nObituaries\n\n30c418e4b7644a9eb54409baf55036d1\n\nOddities\n\n44811870882f10048079ae2ac3a6923e\n\nPolitics\n\n86aad5207dac100488ecba7fa5283c3e\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nec28dcdfc4ca4ac9918d3b61427e65c3\n\nReligion\n\n026a1118e94443a2aacc08a2e70cc77b\n\nScience\n\n4bf76cb87df7100483dbdf092526b43e\n\nSports\n\n54df6c687df7100483dedf092526b43e\n\nTechnology\n\n455ef2b87df7100483d8df092526b43e\n\nFor more information, see a complete list of AP Subject terms.\n\nAP Geography\n\nAP Geography contains geographic place names, such as cities, U.S. states, Canadian provinces, Australian states and territories, countries, continents, points of interest and natural features; for example, lakes and mountain ranges.
