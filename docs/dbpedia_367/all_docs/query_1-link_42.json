These cinemas are not just venues for watching films; they are woven into the fabric of Parisian history and culture. This article explores the top independent cinemas in Paris, delves into what makes them stand out, and how cinephiles, especially English-speaking audiences, can support and enjoy these local treasures.\n\nThe City of Light has been a haven for film lovers ever since the Lumière Brothers gave the first public film screening at the Grand Café de Paris on December 28th, 1895. Today, anywhere from 450 to 500 different films are screened every week in Paris on 400 screens. A quarter of those screens are found in independent and arthouse cinemas, more than any other city in the world. Much like independent bookstores, it’s hard to stroll through the narrow streets of the Latin Quarter without noticing all of the independent cinemas…although some are so small and discreet that you may not notice them at all!\n\nIndependent Theatres in Paris\n\nFar from the generic glare of mainstream movie theaters owned by Gaumont-Pathé, MK2 and UGC, independent cinemas offer a unique cinematic experience, often in intimate or historic settings with distinct architectural heritage. Each one has its own character and particular personality, with a strong focus on events that bring the film community together.\n\nMy Ten Favorites\n\nLe Cinéma du Panthéon (13 Rue Victor Cousin, 5th): The city’s oldest surviving movie house, first opened in 1907, was also the first ever to show films in their original language with French subtitles (instead of dubbing them). Today is known for its films d’auteur​​, and the café-lounge (with terrace) decorated by French film legend Catherine Deneuve.\n\nLe Champo (51 Rue des Écoles, 5th): Also known as the Espace Jacque Tati (one of France’s most famous filmmakers), this cinema opened in 1938 is known for its packed schedule of retrospectives and special events like the Nuits du Champo “midnight until dawn” triple-features of cult classics (followed by breakfast). It was saved from demolition in 1999 by becoming a listed historic monument, it was completely restored in 2000 (I love the twinkling start ceiling).\n\nStudio Galande (42 Rue Galande, 5th): This tiny Latin Quarter cinema has been screening the Rocky Horror Picture Show weekly since 1978, with troupes of live actors performing the scenes simultaneously. Rice and water allowed (and if you’re not sure what that means…bring a rain poncho!) They also show other cult classics on the big screen (like Fight Club) and interesting contemporary films that didn’t last long in the mainstream cinemas.\n\nLe Lucernaire (53 Rue Notre Dame des Champs, 6th): A lively cultural center opened in 1974 in a former factory near Luxembourg Gardens, combining a theatre, cinema, a gallery, bookstore, and a restaurant. The setting is adorable, recreating a Parisian street with cobblestones, benches and street lamps.\n\nLe Publicis Cinémas (29, av. des Champs-Elysées, 8th): This grand cinema right on the Champs Elysées is known for its Salle Prestige, with an immense screen and a stage often used for high-level film premiers and concerts. They host many of the screenings for the Champs Elysées Film Festival.\n\nMax Linder Panorama (24 Boulevard Poissonnière, 9th): Hiding behind a rather small façade on the Grands Boulevards, this grand cinema was opened in 1919 by the French Burlesque actor Max Linder. It’s famous for its massive 16-meter screen and 557 seats​​ on three levels: orchestra, mezzanine, and balcony. It hosts premiers, the annual PIFFF (Paris International Fantastic Film Festival), and is perfect for epic films best seen on big screens.\n\nLe Louxor (170 Boulevard de Magenta, 10th): This 1921 cinema with the neo-Egyptian façade cinema was closed from 1988-2013, when it was completely renovated​​ and restored in all its glory, with a terrace bar on the 3rd floor (views of Sacré-Coeur Basilica), and three gorgeous screening rooms showing all the recent films from around the world.\n\nL’Escurial (11 Boulevard du Port Royal, 13th): An arthouse cinema opened in 1911 with a beautiful red velour and gold décor and panoramic screen. Aside from lesser-known arthouse films, it specializes in short films, documentaries and cinema debates.\n\nL’Entrepôt (7 rue Francis-de-Pressensé, 14th): Similar to the Lucernaire, this cultural hub in the Pernety neighborhood is housed within three floors of a former printshop with a cinema focusing on arthouse films, a restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, an art gallery, concert venue, and lively bar under a massive glass atrium. There’s always something going on here, including screenings of French films with English subtitles with Lost in Frenchlation.\n\nLe Cinéma des Cinéastes (7 Avenue de Clichy, 17th): This 1930s cinema run by the filmmakers of the ARP (Authors-Directors-Producers) promotes independent cinema, including new films, (re)discoveries and restorations. Their events bring together the general public and filmmakers in roundtable discussions. Don’t miss the Bistro des Cinéastes hidden upstairs.\n\nOthers in the Cinémas Indépendants Parisiens (CIP) Network:\n\nLuminor Hôtel de Ville (20 Rue du Temple, 4th): First opened in 1912 as a silent film cinema, the Luminor-Marais became a popular arthouse cinema in the 1960s (and even had a bowling alley). For 30 years it specialized in Latin American films under the name Le Latina, then returned to its arthouse roots in 2014. The only cinema in the Marais has been threatened with closure since March 2020, but is still hanging on thanks to strong community support. The upstairs bar is open to “members” (you can become one with a donation of any size when you purchase a beverage).\n\nLe Reflet Medicis (3 rue Champollion, 5th): On a street with three historic cinemas, this one opened in the 1960s is relatively new, but stands out for its dedication to arthouse films and the prestigious retrospective of the Cannes Film Festival’s “Un Certain Regard”. It’s a lively cinema, with weekly events hosting directors, actors, and film critics.\n\nLa Clef Revival (34 Rue Daubenton, 5th): This tiny arthouse cinema near the Jardin des Plantes opened in 1973 specializes in documentaries and indie films. It was saved from closure in 2019 when a collective of moviegoers, film professionals, artists and local residents initiated a citizen occupation. The fight has continued for five years, and today this collective has until March 2024 to raise the €400k to purchase it for good (they’re still short €30k; you can donate on their website to help out).\n\nLe Studio des Ursulines (10, rue des Ursulines, 5th): One of Paris’s oldest cinemas opened in 1926, it initially debuted avant-garde films and now focuses on child-friendly screenings​​ to instill a love of cinema in the next generation.\n\nL’Épée de Bois (100 rue Mouffetard, 5th): This tiny arthouse cinema opened on a popular pedestrian street in the 1970s, screens vintage and modern European art films. You’d walk right past if you weren’t looking for it!\n\nGrand Action (5 rue des Ecoles, 5th): There are three small screening rooms and a bar at this cinema opened in 1970. Here you’ll find recent French and international films, as well as re-releases of classics.\n\nChristine (formerly “Christine 21”, 4 Rue Christine, 6th) and Écoles (formerly “Action Écoles”, 23 Rue des Écoles, 5th) Cinema Club: These two arthouse cinemas in St-Germain-des-Prés and the Latin Quarter specialize in classic films, exclusive re-releases, 35mm screenings, retrospectives, and themed series of international and French films. The American classics are screened in English with French subtitles, but are listed with their French titles, so you may have to go by the poster or the names of the actors to figure it out (or Google, as always). There’s also a Paris Cinema Club Gallery-Bookstore dedicated to cinema at 28 rue Mazarine, 6th.\n\nL’Arlequin (76 rue de Rennes, 6th): Located between Saint-Germain-des-Prés and Montparnasse, this arthouse cinema first opened in 1934. It’s known for film festivals, lively events with directors and stars, and can screen 35mm and 70mm films (increasingly rare).\n\nNouvel Odéon (6 Rue de l’École de Médecine, 6th): One of the few wheelchair accessible independent cinemas in Paris, this Latin Quarter cinema and bar screens a selection of French and international films, many with provocative themes (which are discussed in their “ciné-débat” events). They also show kids’ films with a snacktime afterward (VF, dubbed in French).\n\nLe Saint André des Arts (30, rue Saint-André des Arts, 6th): Opened in 1971, this cinema screens international arthouse films, documentaries, classics (such as Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid), and regular events to discuss the films.\n\nLes 3 Luxembourg (67, rue Monsieur le Prince, 6th): Inaugurated in 1966, this was one of the city’s first Parisian arthouse cinemas. Today it promotes representative films and auteur cinema, with debates, previews, festivals, retrospectives and special evenings.\n\nCinema Le Balzac (1 Rue Balzac, 8th): A 1930s Art Deco cinema just off the Champs-Elysées, it was one of the first to show American films in their original language. Today you’ll find documentaries, independent films, and special events like opera nights and children’s puppet shows​​.\n\nLe Brady (39 Boulevard de Strasbourg, 10th): First opened in 1956, this cinema once specialized in horror films. Now it’s known as a “continuation theater”, allowing films at the end of their run to remain in the theatres a bit longer. It specializes in international films, especially from Turkey and India, as well as diverse sexualities with its film club “Le 7ème Genre”.\n\nMajestic Bastille (2-4 boulevard Richard Lenoir, 11th): An arthouse cinema with a 1930s façade just off the Place de la Bastille, with eclectic programming and an 11-meter panoramic screen.\n\nMajestic Passy (18 rue de Passy, 16th): Opened in the 1930s, this is the only cinema in the vast 16th arrondissement, with general programming and kids programming in addition to arthouse films.\n\nCinema Studio 28 (10 Rue Tholozé, 18th): Opened in Montmartre in 1928 as the first avant-garde film house on the Right Bank, it was the favorite of famed French poet and filmmaker, Jean Cocteau​​. Today it’s known for its excellent sound system and café-bar overlooking a hidden garden courtyard.\n\nThree Other Unique Cinemas Worth a Visit:\n\nLa Cinémathèque Française (51 rue de Bercy, 12th): This cinema arts center – in a dramatic Frank Gehry building overlooking Bercy Park – houses a café, the excellent Musée Méliès cinema museum, and a modern cinema screening retrospectives of international directors, experimental cinema and cult films​​. Every Friday their “Cinema Bis” series screens double-features “devoted to supposedly minor genres: peplum, horror, Italian western, martial arts film, giallo, cheap SF, erotic delirium, and a thousand other subversive and insolent cinematographic forms, naive and sophisticated at the same time.”\n\nLe Grand Rex (1 Boulevard Poissonière, 2nd): A legendary Art Deco film palace opened in 1932, it’s known for its luxurious interior décor inspired by Hollywood’s Golden Age. The massive Grand Hall with its baroque interior has 2702 seats, a mezzanine and two balconies. Locals take their kids to the annual La Féerie des Eaux holiday show (with water jets and laser lights) screening the latest Disney film. The Grand Rex managed to survive when many other cinemas of its size closed by also hosting live shows and prestigious music concerts, guided “backstage” tours, and even Escape Games. Last week the Grand Rex opened a newly remodeled “Infinity” screening room with extra-comfortable reclining seats and bar (only open until the film starts) with tickets priced at €18 per ticket. These aren’t the most expensive seats in the cinema, which also offers VIP seating in the mezzanine of the historic Grand Hall for just 20 lucky people at €50 (includes skip-the-line entrance, a glass of Champagne, and snack). They show all of the recent blockbusters and regular double-features and movie marathons (but these are sometimes in French only, so be sure to confirm when booking).\n\nLa Pagode (57 bis rue de Babylone, 7th): Built in 1896 by the director of Le Bon Marché for his wife in the Japanese pagoda style so popular at the time, complete with a Japanese garden, it was transformed into a cinema in 1931, the first in the 7th arrondissement. Sadly, it has been closed since 2015 for massive restoration work (and the addition of a new reception area). It should have opened in 2023 but is behind schedule. Watch this space…\n\nA Note on Accessibility\n\nWhen I think of independent cinemas, I usually think of steep staircases and narrow hallways. Sadly, most of these theatres were built before elevators or ramps were required, so most of them simply cannot accommodate wheelchairs or anyone with mobility issues. Notable exceptions are the Nouvel Odéon in the 6th arrondissement, the Publicis in the 8th and the Cinémathèque Française in the 12th.\n\nThe Kinds of Films You’ll Find at Independent Cinemas\n\nIndependent cinemas in Paris are legendary for their diverse and eclectic selection of films. On any given day you might be able to see a 1940’s Hollywood classic like Casablanca, a Jean-Luc Godard retrospective of French New Wave, a Spanish-Italian thriller-mystery, a 1960s Swedish sex documentary, or an all-night movie marathon of Monty Python films introduced by one of the stars and followed by breakfast at dawn. Of course, you can also find the latest releases. It would almost be easier to say what you probably won’t find at these cinemas (the latest Marvel production). Here’s a bit of a breakdown:\n\nClassic French Cinema: Independent cinemas in Paris often pay homage to the rich history of French cinema by screening classic films from legendary directors like François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and Agnès Varda. These will be in French, of course, but if you’ve already seen them on the small screen with subtitles, it may be worth seeing them on the big screen in Paris.\n\nInternational Art Films: A significant portion of the programming is dedicated to art films from around the world, including critically acclaimed works from international filmmakers that never made it into mainstream theaters (especially in the US). Be warned that if the film is screened in “VOSF” (Original Version with French Subtitles), you’ll need to know what language the original version is in if you can’t follow the written French!\n\nDocumentaries and Non-Fiction Films: Documentaries are also a popular offering in independent cinemas for their insights into various cultures, social issues, historical events, and personal narratives. The ones addressing more thought-provoking (or flat-out controversial) topics usually include an audience debate/discussion after the film (with a moderator and possibly the director). You’ll never get a more authentic Parisian experience than sitting in on one of these, even if you don’t participate (or follow the French 100%).\n\nAvant-Garde and Experimental Films: For those interested in the unconventional and outright weird (David Lynch’s Eraserhead, anyone?), these cinemas often feature avant-garde and experimental films that push the boundaries of traditional filmmaking with their innovative narratives, visual techniques, and thematic explorations that may “challenge” the viewers.\n\nShort Films and Indie Productions: Independent Parisian cinemas love to showcase emerging filmmakers and less commercial works, often as part of festivals or as one-off events. A total grab bag of offerings, but if you see a trailer that speaks to you, who knows, you might get lucky.\n\nThematic and Retrospective Screenings: Many independent cinemas host thematic nights or retrospective screenings dedicated to specific genres, directors, actors, or cinematic movements. These events are often accompanied by discussions, Q&As, or introductions by film experts. These may be “serious films” but it could just as easily be a screening of Legally Blonde followed by a karaoke party in the cinema’s bar.\n\nFilm Festivals: Independent cinemas in Paris frequently host or participate in film festivals, offering a range of films under a particular theme, region, or style. These festivals are often accompanied by special events like director talks, panel discussions, and cultural activities. Of note for English-speaking audiences in the annual Champs-Elysées Film Festival featuring the best of French and American cinema, specifically the discovery of new talents (all films are shown in French with English subtitles or in English with French subtitles).\n\nNew Releases: Alongside these unique offerings, these cinemas also screen select new releases, especially those that are artistic, independent, or have received critical acclaim in international film circles. Lost In Frenchlation often organizes screening of the latest French releases with English subtitles so visitors and English-speaking audiences can enjoy the latest French films.\n\nYou might be able to find these films streaming online “back home” but seeing them in a historic Parisian setting adds the extra charm of cultural immersion, even if you’re watching an American film. I’ve seen French audiences laugh out loud at what were supposed to be serious/romantic scenes in Twilight, and sit in stony silence as I tried to muffle my laughter during Team America (let’s just say some jokes don’t translate into French). 😉\n\nLost in Frenchlation: Bridging the Language Gap\n\nIt’s not hard to find English-language films in Paris, whether they’re the latest Hollywood blockbusters, or films made in Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, India, or even some Scandinavian films. But if you want to enjoy the latest French films, or rereleases of French cult classics like Delicatessen, Lost in Frenchlation organizes several screening events each month in independent cinemas in Paris, Biarritz, Caen, Lyon and Beaulieu (near Monaco). They not only show French films with English subtitles, they make an entire event out of it, welcoming English-speaking audiences with a special reception and often including themed walking tours or discussions with the directors/actors. They’ve even hosted parties on the rooftop of the Drugstore Publicis – right across from the Arc de Triomphe – for the annual Champs-Elysées Film Festival. These events are immensely popular in Paris, and can sell out quickly, subscribe to their newsletter to get the monthly program.\n\nHistory & Price: Why They’re the Best Choice\n\nEven if you decide to stick to the latest releases in English, look first for screenings in independent cinemas so we can help support these local institutions. Why? Because you’ll be supporting local culture AND saving money.\n\nWhen welcoming audiences at a screening of Le Règne Animal at the Luminor last month, Lost in Frenchlation co-founder Manon Kerjean made sure to remind the audiences to support independent cinemas. I asked her afterward to tell me a bit more about her choice to only work with these cinemas instead of the usual chains.\n\n“I’ve always been working with independent, arthouse cinemas in Paris because they are the most interesting to me — in terms of the movies they choose to program their architecture, their story, since they’re often historical venues — and the ones which need the most support,” said Manon.\n\n“For example Luminor Hôtel de Ville, which I’ve been working with for five years now is threatened with closing down, and this would be very sad news for Paris’ cinema culture since it’s the last independent theatre in Le Marais. Thankfully they have received a lot of public support, and the decision hasn’t been made to shut it down yet, but I’m very happy to see that our spectators keep coming in large numbers to our events there and sign their petition as well.”\n\nAlthough you might think they’d cost more, independent cinema tickets are usually LESS expensive, with the average ticket costing €9 as opposed to €11 in the chains. Some of these cinemas will even accept UGC, Gaumont or MK2 movie passes, although you can also subscribe to La Carte CIP (which stands for Cinémas Indépendants Parisiens), accepted in 79 theatres in Paris, which brings the cost per screening down to €5.30. If you don’t have a pass, check the weekday specials and matinée prices offered.\n\nBy visiting these independent cinemas, you not only contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage, but you also get to experience a beloved Parisian pastime with the locals. Isn’t that one of the reasons we’re all here? 😉"
