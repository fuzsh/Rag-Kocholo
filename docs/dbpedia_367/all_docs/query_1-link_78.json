Dirty Films has been so generous with me this whole time and I was blinded by excitement, but unfortunately, I no longer feel able to fully realise this film.‚Äù\n\nDirty Films are yet to announce a new director for the film.\n\nAlmod√≥var‚Äôs decision was confirmed by his brother, Agustin Almod√≥var, who runs El Deseo production company with him.\n\n‚ÄúPedro Almod√≥var is leaving the ‚ÄòA Manual for Cleaning Women‚Äô project, which will continue forward with Cate Blanchett,‚Äù Agustin wrote on Twitter.\n\nAlmod√≥var has made 22 feature films over a 50-year career. Until this venture, all his films have been in Spanish.\n\nHe has frequently worked with Pen√©lope Cruz and Antonio Banderas throughout a decorated career that has seen his films nominated for nine Oscars, winning Best Foreign Language Feature for ‚ÄòAll About My Mother‚Äô and Best Original Screenplay for ‚ÄòTalk to Her‚Äô.\n\n‚ÄòAll About My Mother‚Äô also won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival, with his 2006 film ‚ÄòVolver‚Äô winning Best Screenplay. His films are some of the most decorated Spanish filmmakers ever at the Spanish Goya film awards with 117 nominations and 32 wins."
