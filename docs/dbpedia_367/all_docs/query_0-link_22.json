        "text": "Representation\n\nThe way in which the media ‘represents’ people and the world around us.\n\nRoyalties\n\nPayments paid to performers and song writers when their music is played on radio (or television or video games).\n\nRunning story\n\nThis is a story that appears in two or more consecutive editions of a newspaper or for two or more days in other news media. If a breaking story has this potential, journalists may say ‘this one will run and run’.\n\nSecondary research\n\nSecondary research involves the collation and analysis of research that already exists.\n\nSegmentation\n\nThe division of audiences into segments and categories.\n\nSelf-regulation\n\nThis occurs when media industries set up and pay for their own regulatory bodies. Unlike statutory regulators, these do not have legal powers, but they rely on companies within the industry to accept a code of practice. Examples include IPSO (newspapers and magazines) and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).\n\nSemiotics\n\nThe use and study of sign, sign systems and their meanings. Also known as semiology.\n\nSerif and Sans Serif\n\nA serif is a small decorative line added to the letters of certain typefaces. Sans means without so sans serif typefaces don’t have these features.\n\nSFX\n\nSpecial Effects. Graphics techniques that are applied to moving images to create specific effects.\n\nShot\n\nA single image taken by a camera, or a single take of video footage.\n\nSign\n\nAnything that expresses meaning is a sign. Examples include written or spoken words, an image, a sound, a gesture or an item of clothing.\n\nSignposting\n\nThe technique of establishing what the location of a scene is from the beginning. For example, a hospital drama might be signposted by audio of medical equipment or ambulance sirens.\n\nSkyline\n\nA line of text, with or without a coloured strip background, that runs across the top edge of a magazine page, poster or other printed product. It contains important information to appeal to the audience.\n\nSlogan\n\nA catchy, eye-catching and memorable phrase, often used in advertising.\n\nSocial cohesion\n\nThe tendency for individuals in society to bind together with shared views, beliefs and behaviour.\n\nSocial construction\n\nThe belief that masculine and feminine behaviours, values and beliefs are constructed by society and not by nature.\n\nSocial fragmentation\n\nThe tendency for individuals and groups within society to split apart because they have few values or beliefs or behaviours in common.\n\nSocial groups\n\nTwo or more people who share a common sense of identity.\n\nSocial media/networking\n\nWebsites, platforms and apps that enable users to communicate with other people across the world.\n\nSocial realism\n\nA film genre the deals sympathetically with everyday issues and problems faced by working-class people. Typical themes of social realist films include unemployment, poverty, homelessness, prostitution, drugs and the effects that these have on people’s relationships.\n\nSpin\n\nA form of biased communication used by advertisers, marketers or politicians to present someone or something in a very positive or very negative light. Experts in spin are called ‘spin doctors’.\n\nSponsorship\n\nA marketing technique involving the funding or support of, for example, a person, media product or event in order to increase exposure for a brand or product or service.\n\nStandfirst\n\nA term used in print and website design which refers to introductory material, usually appearing immediately after a headline and often distinguished by a different typeface.\n\nStatutory regulation\n\nStatutory regulators have legal powers to control the industry for which they are responsible (a statute is a law). For example, Ofcom is the UK regulator for TV, radio, video-on-demand and phones. It sets rules and enforces them in these sectors.\n\nStereotyping\n\nThe reduction of a social group to a limited set of characteristics or pre-conceived ideas.\n\nStoryboard\n\nA visual representation and plan of how a moving image scene will be shot. Typically includes a sketch of each frame, camera movements, edits and timing, etc.\n\nStoryline\n\nAnother word for plot.\n\nStrapline\n\nA cross-column subheading, usually found in newspapers, magazines and websites, that emphasises part of an article or advert.\n\nSubculture\n\nA group with beliefs or values that differ from most people in the wider culture to which it belongs.\n\nSubjectivity\n\nInformation that is based on an individual interpretation or opinion. It can be clouded by bias, values or beliefs. Subjective views may not be backed up by scientific proof or hard evidence, but they can still have great value in opening our eyes to a deep understanding of something that is not measurable such as humanity, love or grief.\n\nSubscription video-on-demand\n\nSVOD is the same as VOD but is only available to paying customers. Amazon Prime Video is an example.\n\nSubscription broadcasting\n\nAny platform/broadcaster that offers access to its content for a subscription.\n\nSymbol\n\nA sign which doesn’t physically resemble the thing it stands for. Words are symbols because they don’t look like the idea or object that they stand for. The red white and blue tricolor flag is a symbol of France.\n\nSynergy\n\nWhere two or more media products are linked for commercial purposes, eg a film and a video game based on the film.\n\nTarget audience\n\nProducers of media products always have in mind an intended audience, often defined by age, gender or social class. The product is fashioned to appeal to the specific wants and needs of this group, a process called targeting the audience.\n\nTeaser\n\nA form of trailer that ‘teases’ the audience about a forthcoming film. Often meant to intrigue, teasers are typically short and aimed at perking interest.\n\nTilt\n\nA camera movement on a vertical axis. The camera, usually tripod mounted, is angled upwards or downwards.\n\nTime shifting\n\nThe viewing of a broadcast programme at the time of the viewer’s choice rather than at the time of transmission.

The most common type of transition is the cut: an instant shot change between the two shots. Others are crossfade or mix or dissolve, in which one shot gradually merges into the next. Digital editing can also achieve many special effect transitions. A fade in is a transition between a blank screen (usually black) and a shot. Fade out is the same in reverse.\n\nTransmission\n\nA broadcast programme on television or radio. A live transmission is broadcast simultaneously with the event actually happening.\n\nTreatment\n\nA short outline of an intended media production. This might include written descriptions, sketches and mock-ups.\n\nTypography\n\nThe design and arrangement of written material for a printed page or screen.\n\nUK independent films\n\nFilms made without any financial or creative input from the ‘big six’ American studios which also pass the cultural test for ‘Britishness’. The individuals and companies producing these films make up the UK Independent sector.\n\nUnique selling point\n\nThe factor that makes a specific product or service stand out in comparison to other similar products.

Premium paid-for services such as Sky Movies do not have to operate a watershed but must offer PIN protection with a security code.\n\nVideo Standards Council (VSC)\n\nResponsible for age rating of video games in the UK using the PEGI system.
