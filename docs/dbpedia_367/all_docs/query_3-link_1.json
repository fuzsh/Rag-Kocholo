        "text": "Discover the top, most popular movies available now, along with what’s stoking early buzz and hype! Across theaters, streaming, and on-demand, these are the movies Rotten Tomatoes users are checking out at this very moment, including Deadpool & Wolverine (starring movie duo Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in an MCU superhero production), disaster sequel Twisters, detective horror Longlegs (which has cleared Parasite as Neon‘s highest-grossing movie), Trap (from M. Night Shyamalan), and A Quiet Place: Day One (see 2024’s best horror movies)\n\nCheck back for latest updates to the charts, and also take a look at the most popular TV shows out right now!)\n\n#1\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine (2024) 78%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 103954%\n\nCritics Consensus: Ryan Reynolds makes himself at home in the MCU with acerbic wit while Hugh Jackman provides an Adamantium backbone to proceedings in Deadpool & Wolverine, an irreverent romp with a surprising soft spot for a bygone era of superhero movies.\n\nSynopsis: Deadpool's peaceful existence comes crashing down when the Time Variance Authority recruits him to help safeguard the multiverse. He soon... [More]\n\nDirected By: Shawn Levy\n\n#2\n\nTrap (2024) 55%\n\n#2\n\nAdjusted Score: 65874%\n\nCritics Consensus: An arch thriller given some grounding by Josh Hartnett's committed performance, Shyamalan's Trap will ensnare those who appreciate its tongue-in-cheek style while the rest will be eager to wriggle out from it.\n\nSynopsis: A father and teen daughter attend a pop concert, where they realize they're at the center of a dark and... [More]\n\nDirected By: M. Night Shyamalan\n\n#3\n\nTwisters (2024) 75%\n\n#3\n\nAdjusted Score: 99691%\n\nCritics Consensus: Summoning a storm of spectacle and carried along by the gale force winds of Glen Powell's charisma, Twisters' forecast is splendid with a high chance of thrills.\n\nSynopsis: Daisy Edgar-Jones stars as Kate Cooper, a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her... [More]\n\nDirected By: Lee Isaac Chung\n\n#4\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 104194%\n\nCritics Consensus: Grounded in raw humanity by Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, this sideways entry into A Quiet Place finds fresh notes of fright to play amid the silence.\n\nSynopsis: Experience the day the world went quiet.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Michael Sarnoski\n\n#5\n\nLonglegs (2024) 86%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 104900%\n\nCritics Consensus: Saturated in disquieting mood while leveraging a nightmarishly gonzo performance by Nicolas Cage, Longlegs is a satanic horror that effectively instills panic.\n\nSynopsis: In pursuit of a serial killer, an FBI agent uncovers a series of occult clues that she must solve to... [More]\n\nDirected By: Oz Perkins\n\n#6\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 29958%\n\nCritics Consensus: A high-concept treatment that misses out on the blissful simplicity of its source material, Harold and the Purple Crayon is a tribute to imagination that's content to only color inside the lines.\n\nSynopsis: Inside of his book, adventurous Harold (Zachary Levi) can make anything come to life simply by drawing it. After he... [More]\n\nDirected By: Carlos Saldanha\n\n#7\n\nThelma (2024) 99%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 110837%\n\nCritics Consensus: A stellar showcase for the talented June Squibb, Thelma avoids cheap laughs as it finds the lighter side of some serious issues.\n\nSynopsis: Inspired by a real-life experience of director Josh Margolin's own grandmother, THELMA puts a clever spin on movies like MISSION:... [More]\n\nDirected By: Josh Margolin\n\n#8\n\nHit Man (2023) 95%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 111703%\n\nCritics Consensus: A deceptively dark thriller that's also loaded with laughs, Hit Man is an outstanding showcase for leading man Glen Powell -- and one of the most purely entertaining films of Richard Linklater's career.\n\nSynopsis: Oscar-nominated director Richard Linklater's sunlit neo-noir stars Glen Powell as strait-laced professor Gary Johnson, who moonlights as a fake hit... [More]\n\nDirected By: Richard Linklater\n\n#9\n\nKill (2023) 90%\n\n#9\n\nAdjusted Score: 94901%\n\nCritics Consensus: A relentless thrill ride grounded in raw emotional stakes, Kill serves up a knuckle sandwich that action fans will gleefully eat up.\n\nSynopsis: When army commando Amrit (Lakshya) finds out his true love Tulika (Tanya Maniktala) is engaged against her will, he boards... [More]\n\nDirected By: Nikhil Nagesh Bhat\n\n#10\n\n#10\n\nAdjusted Score: 79820%\n\nCritics Consensus: Cranking up a true story of derring-do into a high-octane action flick that's heavy on spectacle if not suspense, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is another solid entry into Guy Ritchie's pantheon.\n\nSynopsis: Based upon recently declassified files of the British War Department and inspired by true events, THE MINISTRY OF UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE... [More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#11\n\nDeadpool (2016) 85%\n\n#11\n\nAdjusted Score: 101972%\n\nCritics Consensus: Fast, funny, and gleefully profane, the fourth-wall-busting Deadpool subverts superhero film formula with wildly entertaining -- and decidedly non-family-friendly -- results.\n\nSynopsis: Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former Special Forces operative who now works as a mercenary. His world comes crashing... [More]\n\nDirected By: Tim Miller\n\n#12\n\nWicked Little Letters (2023) 80%\n\n#12\n\nAdjusted Score: 89423%\n\nCritics Consensus: Thanks largely to a strong cast that leans into the story's humorous side, Wicked Little Letters is a diverting comedy even if the mystery at its core isn't particularly clever.\n\nSynopsis: A 1920s English seaside town bears witness to a farcical and occasionally sinister scandal in this riotous mystery comedy. Based... [More]\n\nDirected By: Thea Sharrock\n\n#13\n\nOnce Upon a Deadpool (2018) 56%\n\n#13\n\nAdjusted Score: 58573%\n\nCritics Consensus: Once Upon a Deadpool retains enough of the franchise's anarchic spirit to entertain, but doesn't add enough to Deadpool 2 to justify its own existence.\n\nSynopsis: Wisecracking mercenary Deadpool meets Russell, an angry teenage mutant who lives at an orphanage. When Russell becomes the target of... [More]\n\nDirected By: David Leitch\n\n#14\n\n#14\n\nAdjusted Score: 50151%\n\nCritics Consensus: No consensus yet.\n\nSynopsis: Zack Snyder's sci-fi saga expands with his hardcore director's cut about a search for warriors to defend a peaceful moon.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Zack Snyder\n\n#15\n\nGhostlight (2024) 100%\n\n#15\n\nAdjusted Score: 105206%\n\nCritics Consensus: A small film that elicits a huge emotional response, Ghostlight is a deeply moving and superbly acted meditation on grief.\n\nSynopsis: When melancholic construction worker Dan (Keith Kupferer) finds himself drifting from his wife and daughter, he discovers community and purpose...
