        "text": "How many times do you scroll through the menu on Netflix and can’t find something new to watch? At last count (according to a search with the app JustWatch) there are 6,047 movies on Netflix.\n\nBut when you look at the main menu, you only see 40 or 50 movie titles. How do you find the others?\n\nIf you know some secret codes, you can view Netflix’s vast library of movies and TV shows.\n\nDating back to its early days of DVD rentals, Netflix established categories of genres and sub-genres and they’re still being used today.\n\nThe main Netflix menu shows categories but they’re pretty wide. There is a Horror category of course. But we all know there are different kinds of horror movies. Without looking into the sub-horror movie genre, you would miss some of the classic cult movies, foreign horror films, B-movies, and horror comedies.\n\nOnce you have the secret codes, you simply need to search for one in a web browser by going to www.netflix.com/browse/genre followed by the four or five-digit secret code.\n\nFor example, the secret code for the horror comedy sub-genre is 89585. Type in www.netflix.com/browse/genre/89585 to see all of the movies in the Netflix library that are in the horror comedy genre.\n\nWhen I did, I found a fairly recent movie called “We Have a Ghost” that’s rated PG-13. The title did not appear in the main Netflix menu and I might never have run across it.\n\nI’ve found searching the secret codes within the Netflix search bar on a TV screen doesn’t result in seeing the titles in a particular sub-genre. So the best way to do it is on a computer and typing in the address, Netflix.com/browse/genre/ the secret code.\n\nFind one you want to watch, and then search for it on Netflix.\n\nIt’s great not for just finding movies for Halloween but also Christmas movies, musicals, screwball comedies, and about 100 other sub-genres.\n\nbookmark this page of special codes\n\nNetflix codes for drama films and series\n\nDramas (5763)\n\nClassic Dramas (29809)\n\nDramas based on Books (4961)\n\nDramas based on real life (3653)\n\nSports Dramas (7243)\n\nGay & Lesbian Dramas (500)\n\nIndependent Dramas (384)\n\nTeen Dramas (9299)\n\nMilitary Dramas (11)\n\nPeriod Pieces (12123)\n\nPolitical Dramas (6616)\n\nRomantic Dramas (1255)\n\nShowbiz Dramas (5012)\n\nSocial Issue Dramas (3947)\n\nNetflix codes for arthouse and non-English language films and series\n\nArt House Movies (29764)\n\nAfrican Movies (3761)\n\nAustralian Movies (5230)\n\nBelgian Movies (262)\n\nKorean Movies (5685)\n\nLatin American Movies (1613)\n\nNew Zealand Movies (63782)\n\nRussian (11567)\n\nScandinavian Movies (9292)\n\nSoutheast Asian Movies (9196)\n\nGerman Movies (58886)\n\nFrench Movies (58807)\n\nEastern European Movies (5254)\n\nDutch Movies (10606)\n\nIrish Movies (58750)\n\nJapanese Movies (10398)\n\nItalian Movies (8221)\n\nIndian Movies (10463)\n\nChinese Movies (3960)\n\nBritish Movies (10757)\n\nNetflix codes for LGBTQ+ content\n\nGay & Lesbian Movies (5977)\n\nGay & Lesbian Comedies (7120)\n\nGay & Lesbian Dramas (500)\n\nRomantic Gay & Lesbian Movies (3329)\n\nNetflix codes for horror series and films\n\nHorror Movies (8711)\n\nB-Horror Movies (8195)\n\nCreature Features (6895)\n\nDeep Sea Horror Movies (45028)\n\nForeign Horror Movies (8654)\n\nHorror Comedy (89585)\n\nMonster Movies (947)\n\nSlasher and Serial Killer Movies (8646)\n\nSupernatural Horror Movies (42023)\n\nVampire Horror Movies (75804)\n\nWerewolf Horror Movies (75930)\n\nZombie Horror Movies (75405)\n\nSatanic Stories (6998)\n\nNetflix codes for independent productions\n\nIndependent Movies (7077)\n\nExperimental Movies (11079)\n\nIndependent Action & Adventure (11804)\n\nIndependent Thrillers (3269)\n\nRomantic Independent Movies (9916)\n\nIndependent Comedies (4195)\n\nIndependent Dramas (384)\n\nCodes for musicals and music on Netflix\n\nMusic (1701)\n\nKids Music (52843)\n\nCountry & Western/Folk (1105)\n\nJazz & Easy Listening (10271)\n\nLatin Music (10741)\n\nUrban & Dance Concerts (9472)\n\nWorld Music Concerts (2856)\n\nRock & Pop Concerts (3278)\n\nMusicals (13335)\n\nClassic Musicals (32392)\n\nDisney Musicals (59433)\n\nShowbiz Musicals (13573)\n\nStage Musicals (55774)\n\nNetflix codes for romantic films and series\n\nRomantic Movies (8883)\n\nRomantic Favorites (502675)\n\nQuirky Romance (36103)\n\nRomantic Independent Movies (9916)\n\nRomantic Foreign Movies (7153)\n\nRomantic Dramas (1255)\n\nSteamy Romantic Movies (35800)\n\nClassic Romantic Movies (31273)\n\nRomantic Comedies (5475)\n\nNetflix codes for science fiction content\n\nSci-Fi & Fantasy (1492)\n\nAction Sci-Fi & Fantasy (1568)\n\nAlien Sci-Fi (3327)\n\nClassic Sci-Fi & Fantasy (47147)\n\nCult Sci-Fi & Fantasy (4734)\n\nFantasy Movies (9744)\n\nSci-Fi Adventure (6926)\n\nSci-Fi Dramas (3916)\n\nSci-Fi Horror Movies (1694)\n\nSci-Fi Thrillers (11014)\n\nNetflix codes for sports productions\n\nSports Movies (4370)\n\nSports Comedies (5286)\n\nSports Documentaries (180)\n\nSports Dramas (7243)\n\nBaseball Movies (12339)\n\nFootball Movies (12803)\n\nBoxing Movies (12443)\n\nSoccer Movies (12549)\n\nMartial Arts, Boxing & Wrestling (6695)\n\nBasketball Movies (12762)\n\nSports & Fitness (9327)\n\nNetflix codes for thriller series and films\n\nThrillers (8933)\n\nAction Thrillers (43048)\n\nClassic Thrillers (46588)\n\nCrime Thrillers (10499)\n\nIndependent Thrillers (3269)\n\nGangster Movies (31851)\n\nPsychological Thrillers (5505)\n\nPolitical Thrillers (10504)\n\nMysteries (9994)\n\nSci-Fi Thrillers (11014)\n\nSpy Thrillers (9147)\n\nSteamy Thrillers (972)\n\nSupernatural Thrillers (11140)\n\nNetflix codes for TV series and TV movies\n\nTV Shows (83)\n\nBritish TV Shows (52117)\n\nClassic TV Shows (46553)\n\nCrime TV Shows (26146)\n\nCult TV Shows (74652)\n\nFood & Travel TV (72436)\n\nKids’ TV (27346)\n\nKorean TV Shows (67879)\n\nMiniseries (4814)\n\nMilitary TV Shows (25804)\n\nScience & Nature TV (52780)\n\nTV Action & Adventure (10673)\n\nTV Comedies (10375)\n\nTV Documentaries (10105)\n\nTV Dramas (11714)\n\nTV Horror (83059)\n\nTV Mysteries (4366)\n\nTV Sci-Fi & Fantasy (1372)\n\nNetflix codes for reality TV\n\nReality TV (9833)\n\nNetflix codes for teen and young adult content\n\nTeen TV Shows (60951)\n\nNetflix codes for series and films for Christmas"
