        "text": "29 Teaching English Language through Movies\n\nDr. Neeru Tandon\n\nINTRODUCTION: In the modern education system technology has changed the overall outlook of teaching and learning. Movies or videos used for teaching English language appear as good teaching tool and very helpful to explain concepts to the class. But when we take the case of tiny tots, we cannot solely rely upon it, as they need individual attention and involvement in the learning process.\n\nMOVIES AND ELT: The conventional method of teaching English will not always work but the ideas and creativity of the teachers and inclusion of various teaching tools will certainly make the learners concentrate and achieve the desired language competency effectively. Movie is one such tool or activity through which English can be taught to the SLLs in an effective manner. Many teachers show movies in the classroom because they understand that this activity ensures that students learn pronunciation, vocabulary, modulation and delivery of words in an effective, enthusiastic, and entertaining way.\n\nChoosing the movies\n\nStoller (1988) emphasizes that planning the lessons well beforehand and approaching the use of films systematically is significantly important. The films should be previewed and selected carefully. It is also important that the students understand the instructional objectives of a film lesson, since it is probable that they do not necessarily consider the film as a teaching tool, at least not in a similar way as they would consider a textbook. Thus, it is important to give understandable and simple instructions to the students, in order to make them understand that the film is not just an entertaining way to pass time but that it has certain pedagogical goals. However, Allan (1985) emphasizes that it is important to choose topics that are relevant to the students. The stories should interest and appeal in order for the students to stay motivated. All in all, the topics should be both interesting and pedagogically rich, which can be a challenging combination.\n\nAdditionally, one important factor that should be taken into account when selecting appropriate movies is the proficiency level of the students and the comprehensibility of the film. The film should be sufficiently comprehensible so that students can complete the language related tasks and that the teacher does not have to work too hard in order to help the students to understand the language. The comprehensibility of the film is not determined only by the degree of difficulty but also by the specific demands made on the students by the assignments. Moreover, it is important that the students gain confidence and feel in command of the medium (Stoller 1988). In addition, Allan (1985) points out some concrete factors which should be taken into account when choosing a film for certain proficiency level. Firstly, the density of language is important. There should be enough pauses in the dialogue in order for the students to be able to follow along. Secondly, the film should provide the students with enough visual support. This means that the visual messages support the verbal message and it is also possible, at least to some extent, guess what is happening in the film. On the other hand, for the more advanced learners there should be perhaps less picture support, in order for them to receive a greater comprehension challenge. Thirdly, delivery of the speech is also a factor that affects understanding. If the characters speak too quickly or there are various different accents, it can be difficult for the students to understand the language. However, for instance different accents are again a simulative challenge for the more advanced learners. Fourthly, it is important that the teacher selects good pause points, bits of film that can stand on their own and still be comprehensible.\n\nStoller (1988) points out detailed criteria for choosing appropriate films for EFL classes. Depending on student proficiency levels, the needs and interests of the students can be taken into account, as well as instructional and curricular objectives and a variety of different film types. Allan (1985) also lists some important phases in selecting a film for English class. The first phase is previewing, since it is important for the teacher to be familiar with the material he or she is teaching. The second phase is viewing the material without sound in order to notice the visual messages. After watching the film without sound it should be watched with sound in order to decide whether the language is comprehensible enough. The teacher should think about the reasons why he or she wants to use the film, what for and with which students. The teacher should also ponder if there are any other materials that can be used with the film, and what makes the film entertaining for the students, why will they like it. It is also important to think beforehand, what he or she expects the students to understand from the film. It makes the preparations easier, if the teacher also thinks about what techniques might work with the film, how much time the film will need and what kind of preparatory work is necessary before the film lessons.\n\nIt is also important to link the film into the syllabus in order for it to be more than a time-filling element. It can be rather challenging at times, and it may even be one reason why some teachers consider using movies too difficult and time-consuming. However, Stoller (1988) states that films can be linked into syllabus in various ways: by language items, by functions or by thematic units. It is also possible to use content- based curriculum, in which case the subject matter of the selected film must be related. In this case students can benefit from their previously learned information in the film-related activities or vice versa, reflecting true-to- life demands. Stoller (1988) emphasizes that the type of film chosen should also complement one’s overall instructional and curricular objectives. Academically for instance following categories could be considered appropriate: documentaries, historical narratives, historical drama, educational films, social issue films, drama, mystery and suspense and animated films. Also cartoons can be used in the ELT class. They are usually short, and they have a clear storyline. The humour can also be a motivating factor for some students. It makes it easier to follow the story if the characters are familiar to the students, and it also provides the teacher with more material However, cartoon can sometimes be too colloquial and the voices may be distorted. This can make the film more difficult to follow, at least for some students.\n\nThe positive effect of films on language learning\n\nMany of the English Language teachers avoid showing movies in the classrooms because they think that their job is to teach books and not to show movies. Using films in ELT may seem to be inappropriate or too arduous. Moreover, films are quite often used as a light stimulation in the beginning of a lesson or in the end of it. In addition, teachers do not necessarily consider the film as a proper teaching resource, since it may be seen only as entertaining and not as educational. However, Stoller (1988: 1) mentions that some teachers have at first commented on technical difficulties associated with using films and film equipment, but on the other hand have agreed that films enhance the study of culture as well as English language skill development. Using films has brought authenticity, variety, reality and flexibility into ELT.\n\nAccording to Champoux (1999) videotapes are nowadays easily accessible and easy to get also for classroom use. In addition, the production quality of the films is high, they are an economical option and they offer both cognitive and affective experiences. Thus, the use of videotapes as teaching material has increased rapidly since the 1970s. Stoller (1988: 1) points out that films extend the range of classroom teaching techniques and resources and not only enhance, but also diversify the curriculum. Champoux (1999) emphasizes that film scenes can make it easier to teach abstract themes and concepts because of their visuality. Also inexperienced students can benefit from films because of their greater feeling of reality. Allan (1985: 48-65) also highlights the realistic examples that the films enable. Combining both audio and visuality makes film a comprehensive tool for language teaching. The visuality also supports the students: it helps learners by supporting the verbal message and provides a focus of attention while they listen.\n\nThe time is ripe for teachers to guide intelligently in a manner to learners who are bloggers and tech savvy. Teaching is not just a routine activity of the classrooms; rather it is more interactive including more and more discussion, interaction and orientation. Out of the loads of the information available on NET, teachers are very much needed to empower students to select, align and apply this information in a correct way. Rather than just verbally discussing text, showing movies to teach is a better option. According to Stoller (1988) films are a flexible tool for second language learning and instruction since they add an extra dimension to course design and assure a rich variety of language and cultural experiences. Additionally, films expose the students to authentic target language, speech forms that are not normally encountered in the more restricted classroom environment. The more realistic language often also motivates the students to participate actively in film-related activities. Katchen (2003: 221-236) also emphasizes the authenticity of the language in films. Since the films are often made to sound natural to native speakers of the language, they thus represent authentic language. Films can even to some extent substitute for the input that ELLs cannot receive from outside the classroom. In addition, real spoken language includes several characteristics that a textbook cannot present. These characteristics are for instance false starts, incomplete sentences and hesitations. There are also several regional, gender and ethnic variations and also differences in the level of formality. With the help of films teachers can present these characteristics to students better than with only a textbook. By watching films the students can also explore the issues of appropriateness and pragmatics while observing also linguistic, paralinguistic and nonverbal behaviour.\n\nCotton and Oliver(1992) have argued that though the written word has had a central authority in society and our notions of rationality and valid argument are also bound up with thoughts derived from writing as a medium, the development of hypermedia represents a return to richer, pre print modalities of expression and provides opportunities to speculate, to debate and to learn in more concrete terms. According to Allan (1985: 48-65) films actually get students to talk and they can be a stimulus to genuine communication in the classroom by bringing out different opinions within the group. Sufen (2006) emphasizes that films are considered an insightful means of teaching, since they reflect people’s way of life in terms of variety, contemporaneity and authenticity. The realistic verbal communication also helps the students to pick up the language more spontaneously.\n\nStoller (1988) points out that the use of films in a content-based curriculum gives the students an opportunity to explore several aspects of a given thematic unit. While watching a film, they can develop their possibly weak background knowledge. At the same time they also get exposure to the language. Together such content exploration and language exposure promote more sophisticated language use. Both content and language are mutually reinforcing and the content provided is not just something with which to practice language, but language becomes the tool with which to explore the content.\n\nEven though there are several positive aspects in using films as authentic teaching materials, Mishan (2004: 216) points out that it can be rather challenging at times. In order to keep the language classes enjoyable and relaxed instead of making the students passive while watching films, it is important to plan the tasks carefully beforehand and also to check the learners’ knowledge of the vocabulary and topic. When the students are familiar with the topic and the vocabulary of the film, it is easier for them to focus on the film as a learning experience as well as an entertaining experience.\n\nMovies in different areas of language teaching: While learning with the help of movies learners deal with the audio visual text and goes beyond simple background study and it becomes imperative to reject the historical approach which advocated simple repetition of safe and received opinions about texts. Bech(2012) said, ‘’Audio is an important part of any—project. It adds personality and customization through music, narrative, and sound effects.’’\n\nAdvantages of using movies in teaching English as a second Language: It has several advantages compared to the more traditional teaching styles. Firstly, movies can be considered as authentic material and they provide the learners with genuine input (Mishan 2004: 216). The genuine input helps the pupils to understand that there is a connection between the more traditional classroom teaching and the real world and that the foreign language is used in real everyday situations outside the classroom.\n\nMoreover, as Krashen (1985: 4) points out, a natural input helps the learners to acquire language without necessarily even noticing that they are hearing or reading a foreign language.\n\nSecondly, it has been studied that films enhance English language skill development since they bring variety, reality, authenticity and flexibility into the EFL classroom and before anything, diversify the curriculum (Stoller 1988: 1).\n\nThirdly, using movies can motivate the students to study English and the visuality of the film may also help the weaker students to understand since it offers another channel of understanding in addition to just listening to the language (Champoux 1999, Allan 1985: 48-65, Stoller 1988).\n\nThese reasons for using movies in EFL teaching are dealt in more detail in how movies are used in five different areas of language teaching: teaching oral communication, teaching writing, teaching vocabulary, teaching grammar and teaching cultural aspects. When teaching oral skills it is important to notice that textbooks usually focus on more formal language and do not focus on, for instance, small talk or conversational interaction. Movies, on the other hand, can be a good way to teach these skills needed in everyday speech since the language used for instance in contemporary movies can be rather up-to-date and can thus motivate the pupils. Moreover, movies can also rouse feelings and opinions and create discussion (Katchen 2003: 221-236). Thus, for example different types of group discussions or debates can be useful assignments when practicing oral communication.\n\nFurthermore, when teaching writing, movies can provide new ideas and bring variety into the classroom. Since writing is a rather complex productive skill and several different aspects need to be taken in to account when teaching it, it can sometimes be challenging to make the pupils interested in it (Katchen 2003: 221-236). However, for instance a film review is an assignment type, which interests probably most of the students.\n\nMovies can be also a useful tool when teaching vocabulary. If the goal of the teaching is to provide the students with communicative competence, it is good that they hear contemporary language and more informal discussion as well. This makes it possible for them to pick up for instance phrases or expressions that they could actually use in an English-speaking environment.\n\nOf course this depends on the chosen film and its style, but usually films with themes that are closer to the young people own lives also interest them and can motivate them to study. In that case also the language is usually rather close to the speech of young people. Additionally, words are learned for both active use (i.e. recall and production) and passive use (i.e. recognition and comprehension) and usually the rich language used in movies provides examples of both of these types (Celce-Murcia and Rosensweig 1979: 241-257). Moreover, movies can be a good way of teaching vocabulary related to a certain theme. It can be easier to practice for instance restaurant or shopping situations with the help of an example provided by a movie.\n\nAlso grammar teaching can take advantage of movies. Since students may have different opinions about learning grammar, it can sometimes be very challenging for the teacher to find a way of teaching grammar that would motivate as many pupils as possible. There are several different methods of teaching grammar but still it can be rather difficult for some pupils. However, using audiovisual methods can be motivating and make the teaching more efficient (Van Abbé 1965: 11). A scene of a movie can be used for instance as an introduction to a new grammar theme or as an example of a certain grammar structure.\n\nUsing movies is generally highly appropriate for teaching cultural aspects. The textbooks can give a rather narrow picture of the English speaking world and thus it is important to present the pupils also other English-speaking cultures than just the British and American cultures.\n\nMovies provide an authentic and interesting way of doing this and usually movies make it easier for the pupils to relate to different cultures. Moreover, a second language learner’s view and understanding of another culture is affected by his or her worldview, beliefs, assumptions and presuppositions. These can, on the other hand, be affected by authentic movies (Hinkel 1999: 6). Films can work for instance as a springboard for discussion or as an introduction to a new culture.\n\nUsing movies can be an entertaining and motivating tool also for learners with different skill level. Movies provide the learners with real-life language input, which may be difficult to receive otherwise in a non-English-speaking environment. In addition, according to many previous studies there are several reasons to use movies in foreign language teaching. Some of these reasons are authenticity, the quality and amount of input provided by movies and the several positive effects that movies have on language learning, for instance the exposure to foreign language and the entertaining aspect of films which also affects students’ motivation. Movies as a teaching resource affect Brain and learning styles as well.\n\nTeaching Oral Skills Through Movies\n\nUntil the late 1960s second language learner’s speech was taken as an imperfect version of the native language. Errors were seen as signs of learning failures. But in the changed scenario of language learning the scene is slightly different. Now the teacher is expected to encourage the learners to compensate for the gaps in their second language learning by using communication strategies.\n\nTraining one’s oral skills sometimes consists also of more formal speaking.\n\nMoreover, formal speech is often also affected by written language. Usually it involves speaking from notes and academic vocabulary. In addition, formal speaking is done in a careful style in clear and deliberate way with an opportunity for the speaker to monitor the production of speech. Finally, an important point about formal speaking is that it usually requires to be taught, since it is not a skill that comes naturally, but needs also a great amount of practicing (Nation and Newton 2009: 120- 122).\n\nThe learner should experience the task from the listener’s point of view. It also helps to develop a sense of having an audience. The learner should also be able to work through several different spoken tasks that gradually increase in complexity. However, even though the attitudes have changed, teaching oral skills can be challenging at times. Since learners may hesitate and lack confidence to speak the foreign language, it is important that the teacher provides the learners with opportunities to communicate and motivating communication exercises.\n\n‘’Thus, different communicative activities are useful, since they help the learners to integrate their separate sub-skills into an effective system for communicating meanings. They also activate the learner’s capacity for acquiring language through natural processes. The learner’s attention is focused on meanings to be communicated rather than on language items to be learnt.\n\nKatchen (2003: 221-236) emphasizes that textbooks usually do not teach for instance small talk and conversational interaction. Thus, films can be an effective way to motivate the learners to develop their oral skills, since movies usually present the most current and real language with for instance different types of fashionable words or expressions. In addition, it is very common that films invoke feelings, opinions and create discussion. This usually helps the teacher to provide the students with reasonable discussion topics. Some tasks focused on oral skills and based on a film could be for instance group discussions about the topic with the learners’ own opinions, a debate, re-acting a scene of a film or acting an alternative ending to the film. Mishan (2005: 216-225) also mentions the ’image-sound skim’ which means that the learners are encouraged to mention some images or sounds from the movie that particularly struck them and what feelings they evoked. This is a useful way to find out the learners’ immediate reactions, since usually the film is still ’working’ on their minds and the responses are rather immediate. Another version of this activity is to ask somewhat more detailed questions, such as ”what surprised you?” or ”what pleased you?”\n\nTeaching writing through movies\n\nWriting is an active and a productive skill, unlike reading and listening. Reading and Listening require the active involvement of the brain, but it is more utilized in writing. For writing properly one must consider various aspects of language like word choice, use of appropriate grammar, syntax, mechanics and organization of ideas into a coherent and cohesive form. However, writing also includes a focus on audience and purpose, and a process of discovering meaning. Choosing different text types can make writing more versatile and fun also for the learners. There also comes the role of films as films can bring variety to writing tasks.\n\nSome examples of writing tasks based on a film could be for example a film review, a review comparing a film and a book, writing an alternative ending to the film or writing a letter to one of the characters of the film. Also prewriting can be used before watching the movie: the students can for instance write down what they expect the movie to be about based on the title. In prewriting the students get to practice also different ways to get started with their writing: brainstorming, clustering, strategic questioning, sketching, free writing, interviewing and information gathering. (Gebhard 1996: 221-246).\n\nTeaching vocabulary\n\nDuring the past decades teaching vocabulary has been of secondary importance. However, nowadays the teachers try to balance between all the different areas of language teaching and thus vocabulary alongside with grammar and oral skills is rather recognized.\n\nAccording to Celce-Murcia and Rosensweig, there is also a difference between the active use of vocabulary (i.e. recall and production) and the passive use of vocabulary (i.e. recognition and comprehension). Active use of vocabulary is of course somewhat more important, whereas the passive use of vocabulary for listening or reading may exclude productive facility altogether. Moreover, the vocabulary items necessary for the development of formal reading and writing skills may not be appropriate when one is learning the less formal vocabulary typical for listening or speaking. Another important point is that the teacher must decide whether the passive vocabulary is to be learned permanently or temporarily, for instance to understand a piece of text or a movie with no consideration for later use. However, all in all both passive and active vocabulary is needed in foreign language learning.\n\nLearning new words in a second/foreign language is not always easy, and it requires a great amount of repetition and practising. Yuksel and Tanriverdi (2009: 48-54) emphasize the usefulness of English captions when watching a movie. Captions facilitate acquiring vocabulary, since they help the learner to incorporate a word into a context. This was the case at least when shorter clips of movies were used in EFL teaching. Moreover, films can help to learn for instance vocabulary around a certain theme. In fact, according to Wray (2004: 249-267) it is possible to teach vocabulary and even ready scripts of a certain social situation with the help of television. With sufficient repetition and practicing even a beginner learner may be able to acquire a great amount of vocabulary despite his or her previous linguistic experience. However, this vocabulary may not be acquired entirely correctly but well enough in order to be able to communicate in social situations. Finally, the acquired vocabulary can then be used for instance in an oral exercise (discussion, interview etc.) or in a written assignment (an essay, film review etc.)\n\nTeaching grammar through movies\n\nSeveral different methods in grammar teaching appeared during the past decades . Grammar-Translation Method consists of explanation of a grammar rule, presenting vocabulary as a bilingual list, a reading section emphasizing the rule presented and the vocabulary presented and exercises designed to provide practice both on grammar and vocabulary. The second methodology is Audio-lingualism, which consists of a dialogue, which contains the structures and vocabulary of the lesson. The third methodology is Cognitive-code, which tries to help the student in LSRW. However, Cognitive-code emphasizes the communicative competence and aims for fluency. Direct method as the fourth methodology uses the target language in every situation in the classroom and it is closely connected to inductive teaching, which gives the learners an opportunity to guess or work out the rules of the language. The fifth approach is the Natural approach, which is originally meant for language instruction.\n\nThe sixth method is Total Physical Response, which has the following principles:\n\nspeech is delayed from students until understanding of spoken language ”has been extensively internalized” 2) ”Achieve understanding of spoken language through utterances by the instructor in the imperative” 3) ”Expect that, at some point in the understanding of spoken language, students will indicate a ’readiness’ to talk”. ‘’The seventh method is Suggestopedia, which consists of three parts: review done by traditional conversation, games etc., presentation of new material in the form of dialogues and finally reading the dialogue by the teacher while students follow the text and do Yoga breathing in order to reach a relaxed and meditative state.\n\nGrammar teaching also has two different approaches, the deductive and inductive ways of teaching and learning. The deductive style is more traditional and teacher-led. The inductive way, in turn, allows the learner himself or herself to come up with the rule after the teacher has presented some examples. According to Thornbury (1999) a synonym for deductive way could be ’rule-driven’, and for inductive ’rule-discovery’.\n\nMoreover, using audiovisual methods, such as movies, can motivate the students to study grammar in a different way. Van Abbé (1965: 11) points out that using audiovisual methods makes the teaching more efficient and motivates the students to attend the classes. He refers to a course in which audiovisual material was used and as a result of the course the students were able to take in grammatical structures, which they could never have learned during the traditional and more formal grammar lessons.\n\nSince grammar can be taught in numerous different ways, also using versatile materials is useful. Thus, using films to teach grammar is also worth trying. Moreover, grammar assignments based on a film could be for example gap-fill exercise, an introduction to new grammar topic, a revision of already learned grammar topic or coming up with a grammar rule based on a scene of the film.\n\nTeaching cultural aspects\n\nAccording to Hinkel (ibid.) ”culture and language are inseparable”. In conclusion, studying different cultures can make an individual more tolerant and liberal and decrease one’s prejudices.\n\nHinkel (ibid.) also points out that in teaching at least four different notions of culture must be recognized: ethnic culture, local culture, academic culture and disciplinary culture. All these affect the teaching and for instance the discussions about culture. When it comes to film, it must be thought, how cultural the television and movie codes actually are. Additionally, they must be cross-culturally interpretable.\n\nMovies in ELT are a great way to present English-speaking culture. There are movies for instance about Australia, New Zealand or the English-speaking India. Films provide an entertaining way to get to know these somewhat less known English- speaking areas. A film can work as springboard for culture discussions, as an introduction to new culture, or as an informative material. However, movies are a good way to raise questions and discussion in the class, and different students’ different views and experiences can be extremely interesting and motivate the students to talk.\n\nAspects to consider when using movies in EFL teaching\n\nChoosing the movies\n\nCopyright matters\n\nThe teaching environment\n\nThe proficiency level of the\n\nMoreover, Stoller (1988) points out that the use of films and videotapes requires attention and the teacher must play an important part in an effective film lesson in order for the film to be more than just a time filler. It is also important to remember, that the films are neither a substitute for the teacher nor instruction.In addition, it is the teacher’s responsibility to promote active viewing and the film should also promote active participation from the beginning of the lesson in order for the students to be more than just passive listeners and watchers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe teachers’ responses show that movies are rather suitable for teaching oral communication, writing and vocabulary. Reasons for using movies for teaching oral communication were for instance the fact that they encourage students to speak and evoke feelings and opinions. Also (Katchen 2003: 221- 236) emphasizes that since films usually evoke some type of ideas and opinions, it is usually also easier for the learners to speak about their own ideas. However, also negative factors were found, since some of the respondents think that using movies is too time-consuming and difficult and not all students are willing to discuss movies. Nevertheless, most of the respondents think that movies are a useful tool when teaching oral communication and most of them also gladly use movies.\n\nyou can view video on Teaching English Language through Movies"
