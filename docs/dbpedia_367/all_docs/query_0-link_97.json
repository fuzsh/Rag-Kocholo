To satisfy a requirement of a grade H3 at higher Leaving Certificate level students presenting EB must present the subject at grade 7 or better.\n\nIndicative Points Equivalence\n\nStudents are ranked on the basis of their six best distinct recognised subjects from one sitting of the EB Exam. Points for each 3, 4 &5hr subject=the points awarded to the higher level Leaving Certificate grade in the same percentage range. Points for each 2hr subject=the points awarded to the ordinary level Leaving Certificate grade in the same percentage range.\n\n*Advanced subjects will not be counted where there is already a result in the same subject. E.g. Advanced English and English. Where there are only 5 distinct 3,4 or 5 hour subjects the best 2 hour subject will be counted.\n\nPercentage Range\n\nGrade\n\nPoints > 3hour subjects\n\nPoints 2 hour subjects\n\n90 to 100\n\nH1/O1\n\n100\n\n56\n\n80 but less than 90\n\nH2/O2\n\n88\n\n46\n\n70 but less than 80\n\nH3/O3\n\n77\n\n37\n\n60 but less than 70 H4/O4 66 28\n\n50 but less than 60\n\nH5/O5\n\n56\n\n20\n\nBonus points for maths: 25 additional points will be awarded for a grade 6 or better on 3, 4 or 5 hour mathematics.\n\nUS High School Qualifications\n\nDue to the ongoing challenges facing students seeking to sit standardized tests and the continued impact of COVID-19, Trinity admissions office will consider alternative evidence from students applying for entry in 2022/23.
