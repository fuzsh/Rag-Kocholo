        "text": "Hollywood is synonymous with the film industry. However, in recent decades, international films have gained greater resonance among American audiences, with non-English language productions making their way into the highest-grossing movies in the United States.\n\nWith the aim of “promoting a close relationship between American cinema and those of other countries,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences created the category of ‘Best Foreign Language Film’ at the Oscars in 1956. Through this category, the best non-English language productions of the year are recognised. In 2019, ‘Parasite’ made history by becoming the first and only foreign language film to win the Oscar for “Best Picture,” setting a precedent for international cinema.\n\n‘Parasite’ (2019) not only triumphed at the Academy Awards. Bong Joon-ho’s film also dominated the box office in the United States, becoming one of the most successful foreign films in history, although the top spot in terms of revenue still belongs to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000).\n\nTop grossing foreign language films in the United States\n\nBelow, we share the list of the 10 highest-grossing non-English language films in the United States, according to the IMDB and Mojo databases:\n\nForeign films nominated for an Oscar in 2024\n\nWhile none of the foreign films nominated for Oscars this year managed to break box office records – at least not yet – many of them will go down in history for their high impact on critics. Here are the non-English language films nominated for the 96th Academy Awards:"
