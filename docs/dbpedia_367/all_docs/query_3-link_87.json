        "text": "The Hollywood industry has grown massively strong over time, with a wide range of high-budget films. Along with that, the content's quality has improved. This compiled list is a one-stop destination for all movie fans looking for information on top-tier Hollywood films.\n\n1.

Nash's story begins as a graduate student at Princeton University.\n\nNash develops paranoid schizophrenia early in the film and experiences delusional episodes while witnessing the burden his condition places on his wife Alicia and friends.\n\nOn December 21, 2001, A Beautiful Mind was released in theatres in the United States. It earned over $313 million worldwide and four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress for Connelly.
