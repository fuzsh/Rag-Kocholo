        "text": "“A Bigger Splash”\n\nLuca Guadagnino’s sun-soaked retelling of Jacques Deray’s 1969 “La Piscine,” starring Alain Delon, is a simmering hothouse of sexual tension and upper-class ennui on the banks of the Mediterranean. Tilda Swinton headlines as a former rock star turned mute, summering with her hunky, younger lover played by Matthias Schoenaerts. Dynamics get complicated when her ex, played by an outrageously over-the-top Ralph Fiennes, shows up with his younger paramour, played with chilling reserve by Dakota Johnson. Guadagnino, establishing the groundwork of his canny explorations of sexuality to come in such films as “Call Me By Your Name” and “Suspiria,” ups the tension in a wild third act that plummets the romantic drama into thriller territory — to brilliant results.\n\n“Scarlet Street”\n\nFritz Lang’s 1945 noir tragedy remakes Jean Renoir’s 1931 “La Chienne” to tell the story of starving artist Christopher (Edward G. Robinson), caught in both a love triangle and an art-world con game with Joan Bennett’s alluring Kitty and Dan Duryea’s two-bit crook Johnny. Hollywood artist John Decker contributed original paintings for the film, which have been displayed at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\n“A Fistful Of Dollars”\n\nSergio Leone’s classic, 1964 spaghetti western “A Fistful Of Dollars” remakes Akira Kurosawa’s 1961 samurai epic “Yojimbo.” The film was massively popular in Italy before taking off in the United States a few years later, and it cemented Eastwood’s reputation as a gunslinging leading man. Eastwood went on to collaborate with Leone on the subsequent films that rounded out his “Dollars” trilogy, including “For a Few Dollars More” and “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.”\n\n“Passion”\n\nEver the master of the psychosexual thriller, Brian De Palma remade 2010’s “Love Crime” for this lurid tale of women tearing each other apart amid the high-stakes corporate advertising world. Rachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace give terrific performances as they navigate a dangerous game of one-upmanship, while both proving to be untrustworthy, unreliable narrators of this deliciously trashy yet sleekly made film.\n\n“The Ring”\n\nGore Verbinski’s terrifying 2002 remake of the J-horror classic “Ringu” stars Naomi Watts, in a fantastic follow-up performance to her breakout work in “Mulholland Drive,” as a creeped-out investigative reporter tracing the origins of a deadly videotape. Haunting images, from fingernail scratches on the inside of the bottom of a well to the black-haired ghost of Samara crawling out of a TV screen in an unexpected third-act gut punch, create a sense of dread that’s impossible to shake off.\n\n“Victor/Victoria”\n\nWith “Victor/Victoria,” director Blake Edwards crafted the perfect comedy showcase for his wife Julie Andrews, who plays a struggling soprano singer moonlighting as a male impersonator in the garish nightclub scene of 1930s Paris. This whimsical, gender-bending musical comedy is a remake of the 1933 German film “Viktor und Viktoria.” Andrews received a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for the film, with co-stars Robert Preston and Lesley Ann Warren earning noms in the supporting categories.\n\n“The Birdcage”\n\nAs a 1996 film about an openly gay couple who agree to pass as straight so that their son can introduce them to his girlfriend’s conservative parents, “The Birdcage” remains pretty transgressive. Penned by Elaine May, Mike Nichols’ witty and delightful comedy is a remake of the 1978 European film “La Cage aux Folles,” inspiring several sequels and a popular stage adaptation.\n\n“The Postman Always Rings Twice”\n\nTay Garnett’s sexy and dangerous 1946 adaptation of James M. Cain’s pulp novel is the most successful telling of this shadowy noir tale of a restless married woman, played here by Lana Turner, whose life blows up when she begins an affair with a surly drifter. The novel was adapted previously in France as “Le Dernier Tournant” and in Italy as “Obsession.” Bob Rafelson remade the film in 1981 with an unsettling misogynistic version featuring Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson baring all in a series of violent sex scenes.\n\n“Solaris”\n\nSteven Soderbergh’s unfairly maligned 2002 “Solaris” is a compact riff on Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1971 outer-space epic, distilling the most primal elements of the story, which is really a romance, into a neat 98 minutes. George Clooney convincingly sheds his matinee-idol image to play a psychologist who, adrift in the cosmos, discovers what he believes to be the reincarnation of his late wife. Based on Stanislaw Lem’s novel, Soderbergh’s “Solaris” sunk at the box office at the time, but has since earned a worthy cult appreciation. Cliff Martinez’s electro-tinged score is an all-timer.\n\n“The Departed”\n\nMartin Scorsese’s addictively entertaining remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film “Infernal Affairs” is the film that, in 2007, finally won the filmmaker his long-overdue Academy Award, both for Best Director and for Best Picture. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, and Vera Farmiga all deliver ace performances as pawns within the machinations of a Boston crime syndicate.\n\n“The Talented Mr. Ripley”\n\nAnthony Minghella’s sexy, scary 1999 take on René Clément’s 1960 thriller “Purple Noon,” itself an adaptation of mystery scribe Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley novels, oozes with dread and sexual discomfort. Matt Damon plays the closeted, sniveling Tom Ripley, who cons his way into the lives of an affluent American couple, portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law, summering in an Italian seaside town. The film leaves you hanging on a disturbing final note that is unimaginable today for a mainstream studio film.\n\n“Twelve Monkeys”\n\nTerry Gilliam’s vividly imaginative 1995 sci-fi film “Twelve Monkeys” blends elements of steampunk in its production design, tipping its hat to everything from “Alphaville” to Gilliam’s own “Brazil” in its depiction of a wasted, dystopian future landscape. But the film is really a reinvention of Chris Marker’s achingly beautiful 1962 photo-essay film “La Jetée,” which tells the story of a man coming to terms with his own death in a most unusual way."
