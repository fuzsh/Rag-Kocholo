        "text": "The programs of study, known as majors or minors, include a narrative description and a summary of course requirements. Students should read the complete narrative descriptions because the summary eliminates essential information. An explanation of the components of each course entry follows.\n\nCourse Numbering\n\nUnless an exception is noted, course numbering typically follows standard guidelines. Courses numbered 10000 are general education and introductory courses. Courses numbered 20000 are intermediate, advanced, or upper-level courses that are open only to undergraduates. Courses numbered 30000 and above are graduate courses that are available only to undergraduate students who obtain the consent of the instructor. Undergraduates registered for 30000-level courses will be held to graduate-level requirements. With the exception of BUSN courses, when a course is cross listed between the College (10000- to 20000-level courses) and graduate divisions or professional schools (courses numbered 30000 and above), College students may only register for the undergraduate number. Higher-numbered courses within each of these categories do not indicate increasing levels of difficulty.\n\nIn some departments, students with advanced standing and consent of instructor may register for higher-level courses. Except for language instruction courses, these courses are not listed in this catalog; students should contact individual departments for further information.\n\nA number shown, for example, as 211xx, indicates that it is a course within the series 21100 through 21199; any information that describes 211xx applies to the entire range of courses available within the series.\n\nCourse Description\n\nA narrative description follows the course number and title. Unless otherwise designated, courses are taught on campus.\n\n\"L\" at the end of the course description indicates that the course has a laboratory requirement. Courses with laboratories do not yield extra credit.\n\nUnits\n\nA student receives 100 units of course credit for most undergraduate courses. The appropriate unit value is listed next to the course title in the catalog and in the course details at Class Search.\n\nTerm Offered\n\nCourses may be offered in Summer, Autumn, Winter, or Spring Quarter, or in multiple quarters. If a course is not offered in the current academic year but will be offered at a future time, that information appears in this field.\n\nInstructor\n\nFor faculty contact information, visit the University of Chicago online directory at directory.uchicago.edu. Many departmental websites include additional information about the research and scholarly interests of faculty members.\n\nEquivalent Courses\n\nBecause of the interdisciplinary nature of the College, many courses are cross listed in multiple programs of study. For example, CMST 10100 Introduction to Film Analysis is cross listed among Cinema and Media Studies, English Language and Literature, and Visual Arts.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA course may have one or more prerequisites for registration. Before registering for MATH 21100 Basic Numerical Analysis, for example, a student must first have completed MATH 18400 Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences II, MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra, MATH 20400 Analysis in Rn II, MATH 20410 Analysis in Rn II (accelerated), or MATH 20420 Analysis in Rn II (IBL). Another example: Some courses require students to be in their third or fourth year in the College.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Notes field contains additional information that may be of use to students, for instance, that the course meets a general education requirement or that the course is required for students in a certain major. Certain courses, especially those that meet general education requirements, have mandatory attendance for the first class meeting; otherwise the student's registration will be dropped. Students are advised to pay close attention to these notes.\n\nFor More Information"
