        "text": "Michigan Compiled Laws (MCL) 380.1531 and the Teacher Certification Code typically require teachers hold the endorsement for the subject(s) and grade levels in which they are assigned to teach. This resource will serve as a guide for assigning staff to common or typical course titles offered in Michigan middle and high schools (6-12 departmentalized). It is understood that this is not an exhaustive list of all possible courses. Companion guides for placement are also available for Assignments for “All Subjects” Endorsed Teachers and Appropriate Placement of Educators. These guides are subject to change and update with new state endorsements, new course titles named by K-12 schools and districts, and Michigan curriculum expectations. For a comprehensive list of nationally recognized course titles with a crosswalk to Michigan endorsement areas, please see the Center for Educational Performance and Information’s (CEPI) Registry of Educational Personnel Crosswalk. Districts must consider the following elements when using this document to make the best decisions for the assignment of teachers:\n\nCurriculum and content\n\nCredit being awarded to PK-12 students\n\nContext and funding\n\nCertification, endorsement, and preparation of staff\n\nCoding and reporting\n\nNote: The Michigan Department of Education (MDE) maintains a list of endorsement areas that are currently displayed on Michigan Certificates."
