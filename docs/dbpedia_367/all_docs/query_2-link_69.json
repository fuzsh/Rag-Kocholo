        "text": "On the site www.netflix.com, you will not find any categories, they are not presented in the navigation. However, Netflix does have secret codes that allow them to classify movies and series in order to present you with recommendations. These codes can be used to navigate directly to the category.\n\nIt is thanks to a mix of human and artificial intelligence that Netflix categorizes its series and movies.\n\nIn other words, Netflix has a lot of employees who are there to watch, evaluate and tag the platform's content to get metadata: the ending of the movies, the plot, the locations, the work of the main characters, to name a few.\n\nNot surprisingly, the amount of recording collected became massive, forcing engineers to step in. Through the magic of algorithms, the content was divided into tens of thousands of different micro-genres, or as Netflix likes to call them, \"alt-genres\".\n\nYes, all codes work. Sometimes a code associated with a category may not work because it is either not available in your area or Netflix has decided to change it. We try our best to make sure that all codes on Netflix-codes.com work. Please feel free to report a code that does not work for you."
