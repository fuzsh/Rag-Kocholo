        "text": "Movies (or films) have become an important part of almost everybody's life. Hollywood, Bollywood and many other film centers make a wide variety of films to keep us entertained. This lesson focuses on encouraging students to discuss some of their favorite films by asking students to discuss examples of different films they like. Next, students write short plot summaries to share with each other.\n\nAim: Conversation about films to practice and learn new vocabulary related to movies / films\n\nActivity: Initial conversation followed by group work for writing practice\n\nLevel: Intermediate\n\nOutline:\n\nStart the lesson by asking students which type of films there are. Make a few suggestions of recent films using some of the film types to get students started.\n\nProvide a sheet with quick definitions of different film types.\n\nHave students get into small groups and try to come up with at least one film for each type of film.\n\nIntroduce the idea of a plot. As a class, choose a movie with which everyone is familiar. Write a quick plot summary together on the board.\n\nEach student then chooses a film and writes a short plot summary for the film.\n\nHave students get into pairs.\n\nStudents describe their chosen films to each other. Students should take notes on each other's films.\n\nStudents switch partners and describe the plot of their first partner's film to another student.\n\nSpeaking About Movies / Films\n\nExercise 1: Movie Types\n\nTry to come up with one example for each type of film.\n\nExercise 2: Plot Summary\n\nYou can describe movies by speaking about their plot. Think of a movie you've enjoyed and write up a plot summary.\n\nPlot\n\nThe plot is the general story of the movie. For example, Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. Girl doesn't love boy back. Boy finally convinces girl that he's the right guy.\n\nTypes of Films\n\nProvide students with these brief descriptions of the following common film genres.\n\nHorror\n\nHorror films feature lots of monsters such as Frankenstein, or Dracula. The object of horror films is to make you scream and be afraid, very afraid!\n\nAction\n\nAction films are films in which the heroes have lots of battles, do incredible stunts and drive fast.\n\nMartial arts\n\nMartial arts films feature martial arts such as Judo, Karate, Taekwondo and so on. Bruce Lee made very famous martial arts films.\n\nAdventure\n\nAdventure films are like action films, but they take place in exotic places. Adventure films include films about pirates, historical adventures such as sailing around the world and space exploration.\n\nComedy\n\nThere are many different types of comedy films. In general, comedies make you laugh - a lot!\n\nRomance\n\nRomance films are love stories made to melt our hearts with stories of people finding each other and falling in love. Many romances are romantic comedies.\n\nRomantic comedy\n\nRomantic comedies are sweet films that include romance, but also lots of funny moments as well.\n\nMockumentary\n\nA mockumentary is a type of joke documentary. In other words, the film is like a documentary, but about something that doesn't really exist. Mockumentaries are often comedies, such as \"Borat.\"\n\nDocumentary\n\nA documentary is a film that investigates some real-life story that is very interesting for a number of reasons. Many documentaries look at the causes of world problems or new types of scientific discoveries.\n\nAnimation\n\nAnimation films are sometimes cartoons such as Disney films. However, with computer animation, many cartoons are now animation films. Animation films use computer graphics to make elaborate stories of adventure, comedies, and more.\n\nBiographical\n\nBiographical films focus on someone's life story. These films are usually about very famous people. Biographical films are also often documentaries.\n\nDisaster\n\nDisaster films are a type of adventure film. Unfortunately, disaster films focus on horrible things happening to us like the end of the world films of 2012.\n\nSuperhero\n\nSuperhero films are also a type of adventure film. These films feature superheroes from comic books such as Superman, Batman, and Spiderman.\n\nScience-fiction\n\nScience-fiction films are set in the future and might be about other planets, or just about the future of our planet Earth. Science-fiction films often feature many elements of adventure films such as chases and battles.\n\nDrama\n\nDrama films are often sad stories about difficult situations in life such as fighting cancer or difficult love stories.\n\nHistorical drama\n\nHistorical dramas are based on real events that happened in the past that are historically important.\n\nThriller\n\nThrillers are spy or espionage stories that are similar to adventure films, but often feature international spy rings, or countries trying to find out secrets about each other.\n\nDetective story"
