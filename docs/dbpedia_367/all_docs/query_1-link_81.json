        "text": "Language learning through TV shows and films sounds like a scenario straight out of science fiction, doesn‚Äôt it? Yet, it‚Äôs not. You might be thinking, ‚ÄúWhy should I even bother googling this? It can‚Äôt be true.‚Äù But here you are. To save you some time: yes, you can learn languages from TV. Context plays a vital role in comprehension and retention when it comes to language learning, and what textbook can provide a more immersive visual context than ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù or ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù? Probably none.\n\nI grew up in Eastern Europe in the ‚Äò90s and learned most of my English by watching cartoons and later movies. If only learning French later in school had been as easy! Luckily, the movie industry isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and I can catch up on my French by watching ‚ÄúLupin‚Äù on Netflix. Oui, monsieur!\n\nBut what about you? What language do you want to learn? Spanish or maybe Korean? By the way, do you know what these two languages have in common? Two very popular Netflix series that feature characters wearing red coveralls. I‚Äôll let you guess the answer.\n\nNow, stick around if you want to find out more about my experience and gain some tips on how you can maximize your binge-watching and learn languages through movies and TV shows.\n\nThe power of TV and film in language learning\n\nLearning a language by watching TV shows and films works for two main reasons: visual context and addictiveness. There may be many more reasons behind this, but these two are the most important ones. Let‚Äôs see why.\n\nContext is king\n\nFirst of all, as already mentioned, context plays a vital role in comprehension and retention. With movies and TV shows, you don‚Äôt only get general context but also visual and auditory context. Examples can include facial expressions, body language, and paralinguistic sounds such as gasps, moans, and sighs, forming a multisensory guide to understanding. Not to mention the fact that you can see how certain vocabulary might be used in different situations.\n\nAdditionally, changes in the music, background noise, or special effects can help viewers guess what might happen next in the story or what words might be used. This does more than just expose you to a new language. It also helps you see how the way people talk and the tone they use can change depending on what they‚Äôre feeling. It literally puts everything into context.\n\nYet, the best thing about learning a language from movies or TV shows is natural conversations. Things people actually say in real life. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to watch a well-written film or series, conversations should flow naturally. That is unlike textbooks, where conversations seem forced. ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù, Alex asks Anna, who then responds, ‚ÄúI am good. How are you‚Äù. In real life, people never speak in such a simple manner. Don‚Äôt you think?\n\nFor example, watching South American or Spanish soap operas is a great way to learn Spanish. Although they tend to be a bit overly dramatic, this will actually boost the learning process. It‚Äôs the out-of-the-ordinary that we tend to remember. The stuff people actually say outside the classroom.\n\nBinge-watching is study time\n\nThere‚Äôs no denying that watching TV series and movies is addictive. While inch-thick textbooks can become dull after a while, a TV series you like will keep you glued to the screen until the end. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called binge-watching.\n\nSo why is this important? Because combining TV watching with language learning it‚Äôs a win-win situation. Let‚Äôs say you just started watching ‚ÄúDark‚Äù on Netflix. You‚Äôll not only get to watch one of the best German series ever made, but you‚Äôll also learn German in the process. Now, don‚Äôt imagine that 3 seasons of ‚ÄúDark‚Äù are enough to make you fluent, but they will certainly help. The more you watch, the more German words you will pick up.\n\nThe effectiveness of TV and film in language learning is in its power to help you learn new vocabulary naturally. You watch, you learn. The only condition is to pay extra attention.\n\nHow to learn languages from TV shows and movies\n\nIt‚Äôs possible to learn languages through movies and TV shows. But don‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôll wake up one day knowing French after watching a couple of French movies.\n\nNope. It doesn‚Äôt work like that. If your objective is to learn the language, you have to put in some extra effort and attention. Here are the tips that helped me learn a language while watching movies and TV shows.\n\nChoose the right level of difficulty: We‚Äôll discuss a little bit more on that later, but what I want to highlight is that diving into very complex movies will not help. For example, if you want to learn Spanish, I‚Äôd recommend starting out with a couple of cartoons (you can find some recommendations here) and only then moving on to comedies and soap operas. Easy does it.\n\nUse subtitles wisely: Once again, it‚Äôs all about going step by step. If at first you gonna watch Danish movies with English subtitles, you will (much) later switch the subtitles to Danish as well. Ultimately, removing subtitles completely encourages a deeper understanding of the language.\n\nWatch regularly: I don‚Äôt need to tell you this. You‚Äôll probably do it anyway, right?\n\nPractice active learning: One of the most important things you can do is to take notes of new words and phrases. I know it probably takes a bit of the fun away, but it‚Äôs a crucial step for learning the language. The good news is that you can do this however you like: for example, some people may want to create vocabulary lists for each episode and revisit them afterward.\n\nSupplement your immersion: Watching TV is not always enough. To speed up the process, you can get a language learning app such as Mondly and learn simultaneously.\n\nChoose your favorite TV series or film: This is by far my favorite tip. Let‚Äôs say you want to learn Italian. Once you know the basics, my personal recommendation would be to watch your favorite TV series or film dubbed in Italian (if available) or with Italian subtitles. Being your favorite one, I suppose you already know what happens in it so that you won‚Äôt lose any information. It‚Äôs a win-win situation.\n\nEnjoy the process: Avoid getting too caught up in it. Losing the joy of learning a language through movies won‚Äôt do you any good. You might actually end up disliking the activity altogether.\n\nTips for improving pronunciation through movie dialogues\n\nLearning a language by watching TV will not only teach you the real language, it will also help you learn what‚Äôs the proper intonation and articulation for it. So here‚Äôs how to make the most of it:\n\nStart with movies and TV shows with clear and articulate dialogue: For example, ‚ÄúThe Crown‚Äù is perfect for those wanting to perfect their British English pronunciation. What non-native English speaker wouldn‚Äôt want to master the Queen‚Äôs English?\n\nBe a character in the movie: And by this, I mean ‚Äúrepeat the words the characters are saying‚Äù. Nobody‚Äôs watching you, so don‚Äôt be afraid to pause the movie (if you‚Äôre watching on a streaming service) and do your own impersonation of certain characters. Practice makes pronunciation perfect, right?\n\nFocus on tricky sounds: Are there any sounds you seem to have trouble grasping and pronouncing? Make sure you pay extra attention every time a character pronounces that specific sound. Look at the way their lips move and try to imitate them.\n\nBreak down and practice difficult words: Just like with tricky sounds, if you encounter unknown or challenging words, pause and repeat them multiple times until you can pronounce them accurately.\n\nThe bottom line is: imitate the characters as much as you can. After all, it should be a fun activity to do, right?\n\nThe influence of film and TV on language and culture understanding\n\nAnother great thing about learning a language from TV series and films is being able to experience cultural understanding and immersion. As you probably already know, knowing the language is not enough. You also have to understand the culture and even history around it.\n\nThe accessibility of foreign films and TV shows allows viewers to travel through the screen to far-off lands and times. This experience enables a deeper comprehension of the cultural subtleties that may not be captured in textbooks or traditional language classes. For many language learners, this adds an exciting dimension to their educational experience. Take, for example, the movie ‚ÄúSeven Samurai‚Äù, which presents a fascinating image of 1586 Japan.\n\nOf course, if you want to learn about the current situation, you‚Äôll have to watch movies and TV shows set in the present day. A good example of modern-day Japan is the highly acclaimed movie ‚ÄúDrive My Car‚Äù (2021).\n\nExplore cultural and language diversity through movies\n\nEven within a single country, films and TV shows can capture the diversity of regional dialects, customs, and traditions. For instance, the difference between urban and rural life, young and old generations, or various social classes can be clearly depicted, offering a more comprehensive picture of society. Watching a wide array of content can, therefore, provide a multi-faceted understanding of the place and its people.\n\nThe potential downside is that, at times, films and TV shows might depict a romanticized or stereotyped version of a culture. This can lead to misunderstandings or oversimplified views. So it‚Äôs essential to approach such content carefully.\n\nIn the age of streaming services, where a plethora of international content is available at one‚Äôs fingertips, the impact of films and TV shows on language and culture understanding has never been more potent. It offers a window into the soul of different societies, enabling people to explore, learn, and grow without ever leaving their living rooms. Whether it‚Äôs delving into historical Japan from a Kurosawa classic or navigating modern-day South Korea through the work of Bong Joon Ho, these media provide valuable tools for language learning and cultural exploration.\n\nLearn languages with Netflix and other streaming services\n\nNetflix has taken the world by storm in recent years. We can‚Äôt help but marvel at its success. It‚Äôs easy to use, it‚Äôs addictive, and it‚Äôs a great tool for anyone wanting to learn a new language. Why? Because you have a lot of options for audio and subtitles ‚Äì especially if you use a VPN.\n\nLet‚Äôs admit it. Having your favorite actor speaking in your target language whenever you turn on your TV makes it easier to grasp the accent and pronunciation of native speakers.\n\nDo you want Brad Pitt to teach you Spanish? Great! Then turn on Netflix, look for ‚Äú7 Years in Tibet‚Äù, and change the audio to Spanish. Not everyone loves dubbed versions of movies, but this is a very useful way to learn the language you want to learn. If you previously saw the film in its original English, it‚Äôs even better because it will be easier to pick up new words in Spanish. Once you feel comfortable, you can switch the subtitles to Spanish as well.\n\nAnother thing you can do is watch the movie with its original sound (if you‚Äôre unhappy with dubbed versions) and switch the subtitles to Spanish. You‚Äôll do this for a long while, but the final level is to watch a movie in Spanish with no subtitles. Fingers crossed!\n\nNow, I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt use other streaming services as well, but Netflix seems to offer the most varied catalog of foreign language audios and subtitles. Just watch and learn!\n\nHow to choose the best movies and TV shows for language learning\n\nGrab the popcorn and hit play.\n\nOh, wait. Not so fast. First, you‚Äôll have to choose a suitable movie or TV show if you want to learn a new language. Not every movie on Netflix will help you boost your vocabulary. Here are a few things you should consider when making your choice:\n\nStarting with shows or films with slower dialogue, simple vocabulary, and clear enunciation is ideal for beginners.\n\nFantasy and SF movies tend to feature more complex vocabulary, so leave them for last. My advice would be to start with comedies and continue with romance movies, then dramas, thrillers and finally fantasy and SF. From my experience, comedies usually feature simpler vocabulary and more natural conversations.\n\nSometimes, shows set in historical or fantasy contexts may not accurately represent contemporary speech norms. So, as previously mentioned, leave them for last when you know how to make the difference between current and outdated lexicons.\n\nMake sure to incorporate different types of content. Documentaries can offer clear and precise language, but dramas or comedies will provide more colloquial and conversational expressions.\n\nMake sure you know whether a particular TV show or film uses a certain accent or dialect. It wouldn‚Äôt be very funny to wake up one day speaking English with a Brummie accent in a corporate setting. Or would it?\n\nThat‚Äôs it for now. If you still have questions about learning languages through TV shows and films, you can ask away in the comments or check the following frequently asked questions.\n\nWhere to go from here: Mondly\n\nWhile TV shows and movies are a great way to make language learning entertaining, they may not be enough. If you‚Äôre ready to dive in deeper, get Mondly, the award-winning language learning app.\n\nWith Mondly, you will learn languages naturally using:\n\npractical topics;\n\nhands-on, interactive language lessons;\n\nintelligent suggestions and instant feedback on pronunciation;\n\ncrystal-clear audios of fluent speakers;\n\nreal-life conversations and so much more."
