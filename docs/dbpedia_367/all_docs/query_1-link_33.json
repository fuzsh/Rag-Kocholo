        "text": "For many avid cinema-goers, dealing with heavy-handed dubbed movies can take its toll. Furthermore, watching their favorite Hollywood stars, be it Robert De Niro or Meryl Streep, speak German (or any language for that matter) just doesn’t feel right. Equally, if they haven’t quite mastered the German language just yet, going to see an original German movie might seem a little daunting.\n\nLuckily, for English-speaking expats living in Germany, there is a solid network of cinemas that offer, and sometimes specialize in, cinema in its original language. So grab the popcorn and head to one of these English-language movie theatres.\n\nDisney+\n\nPrefer to watch something at home? Disney+ brings together great TV shows and movies in one easy-to-use on-demand subscription service. From Homer Simpson to Han Solo, you'll find all your favorite characters on Disney+. Sign up today and get the popcorn ready!\n\nGo to website\n\nUnderstanding German cinema listings\n\nWhen consulting movie guides in Germany, you will usually come across the same abbreviations which are used to indicate the language of the film. It is important to understand what these mean so you don’t end up feeling clueless as to what’s going on on the big screen. Below are the acronyms to look for in the cinema listings.\n\nOV means “Original Version”. It may also say OF meaning “Original-Fassung”. However, note that this doesn’t necessarily mean English. For instance, if it is a French-made film then the original version is likely to be in the French language; with or without German subtitles. For most blockbuster Hollywood movies, however, the original version will be English.\n\nOmU means “Original with subtitles”. This means you will see the movie in the original language (English, French, or whatever) with German subtitles.\n\nOmenglU means “Original language with English-language subtitles”. Now that you know what abbreviations to look for when choosing a movie, you can head to your nearest cinema.\n\nExpatica’s guide to\n\nWatch the 10 best movies for expats living abroad\n\nRead more\n\nThe best English-language cinemas in Berlin\n\nUnsurprisingly, Berlin boasts a good selection of cinemas that screen films in English.
