        "text": "No.\n\nThose are not common pizza toppings in America at all.\n\nIn America there are these (rather well known) pizza styles:\n\nChicago style\n\nChicago style pizza is a deep-dish pizza that is baked in a thick heavy cornmeal based crust. The toppings are also added in reverse order of a traditional pizza. First the cheese is added, then a pound or more of sausage is added in a dense patty layer, finally it is topped with sauce. You eat it with a fork and knife.\n\nNew York style\n\nNew York style pizza is wide thin-crust pizza. The crust is made with a very high gluten bread flour and hand-tossed. Some say that it gets a lot of it's flavor from the NYC water. It is typically cut into only 8 slices for a large pie. You fold the piece in half to eat.\n\nNew Haven style\n\nNew Haven style pizza is a bit lesser known, and originates from New Haven, Connecticut. There it is commonly called \"apizza\". It is similar to a New York style pizza in that it has a thin crust, but it is always brick oven fired until crispy. You should not be able to fold a New Haven slice of pizza in half without cracking it. It should also be crispy enough to stand up to it's own weight when held by the crust.\n\nIn a New Haven pizza a \"plain\" does not have mozzarella. A plain pizza consists solely of sauce, oregano, and a bit of parmesan and romano grated on top. Mozzarella is considered a separate topping.\n\nThey are most known for their white pizzas. These have no tomatoes at all, the \"sauce\" consists of olive oil, oregano, chopped garlic, and grated parmesan. The most well known is the clam pie which has fresh clams as a topping. It is generally frowned upon to order this with mozarella.\n\nVerace pizza napoletana style\n\nAlthough this is the original Neapolitan pizza, it has become very popular in the Pacific Northwest (and maybe elsewhere?). There is a certifying organization, which has stringent requirements for the crust ingredients, oven and so forth. The pies are very thin in the interior, with a slightly puffy edge, and are typically lightly charred in spots, which contributes a lot of flavor. Toppings tend to be minimalist.\n\nThere are four pizza toppings or combinations that are the most popular in the US:\n\nCheese - nothing but tomato sauce and mozzarella (sometimes a blend of cheeses)\n\nPepperoni - add pepperoni to a cheese pizza\n\nSupreme - many variations, but commonly tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, loose ground pork sausage (or \"Italian\" sausage), bell peppers, mushrooms and onions (often black olives)\n\nall meat - many variations, but often tomato sauce, mozzarella, three or more of: pepperoni, ground beef, loose ground pork sausage (or \"Italian\" sausage), ham, bacon, Canadian bacon, other \"cased\" and sliced meats such as salami, etc.\n\nAlso popular:\n\nVeggie: some combination of vegetables with tomato sauce and mozarella\n\nHawaiian: ham or Canadian bacon and pineapple with tomato sauce and mozzarella\n\nMargherita: red tomato sauce, white mozzarella cheese, green basil\n\nBBQ - barbecue (aka BBQ, Bar-B-Q, etc.) sauce and shredded or diced chicken, pork or beef (usually brisket)\n\nWhite - no sauce or sometimes alfredo sauce, mozzarella or another white cheese and spinach\n\nMany menus list available toppings, crust types, sauce choices and sizes and the customer chooses their own combination\n\nIn addition to the other crust styles already mentioned by hobodave, there are quite a few variations mostly of thickness, crispness and chewiness (also variations in added ingredients such as garlic or herbs and even cheese). Some restaurants serve a \"Neopolitan\" style which may or may not be authentic but frequently the only discernible distinction is that it's rectangular instead of round.\n\nAmerican pizzas typically are covered fairly heavily in toppings in contrast to what I understand to be the case with genuine Italian pizzas.\n\nWith the increase in the number of good restaurants, international travel, cooking and travel shows on TV, etc., awareness of and interest in authenticity and variety have increased and many people have ventured outside their familiar territory to try new things.\n\nSee also the Wikipedia article Pizza in the United States.\n\nIt's often claimed that modern pizza originates from the US Chicago and Detroit area. In Italy it was a simple bread dish with a few flavorings on top, and for poor people. Then in the US it started getting more elaborate toppings; then this got exported to Italy by returning expats, some of whom started businesses offering this US-style, topping heavy pizza. Then demand by American visitors (some say mostly troops during WWII) expecting the local \"authentic\" pizza to be a refined dish expanded these returnees' businesses and prompted them to refine it to met this demand. This cultural back-and-forth-and-back-again is refered to as the pizza effect sometimes. I think with respects to pizza this has happened several times already, in various ways, and this might be just the latest iteration of this phenomenon.\n\nBut most people here in Europe I think know Americans don't eat corn on pizza. There's other pizzas that have corn as a topping, I think it probably refers more to the bell peppers and the hot salami, which is imitating the American \"pepperoni\" (which is not and actual Italian word, there's a word \"peperoni\" which means something compeltely different) which is a spicy salami-like meat product and the stereotypical American topping. Corn as spereotypically American might and probably does play a role, but in American pizza chains here don't have corn on pizzas so I think it's not a misunderstanding. I think Americans might not realize people use geographical terms like that as shorthand like that without actually implying that this is an authentic dish from there, I guess here in Europe people we can do that because different countries are more nearby and we actually see what they're like firsthand. While Americans might interpret these things much more literally as might be the case here."
