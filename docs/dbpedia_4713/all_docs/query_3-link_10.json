Went with Flyer’s…holy chicken!! They marinate their chicken, and it is soo good! The crust sauce isn’t the same as the bbq drizzle on top, and please ask for extra fresh cilantro if that’s your thing!! ♨️🐔🍕😋\n\nread moreread less\n\nBrittany H.\n\n*Update*\n\nIt took me a while to give this place another chance after a really poor experience, but since then they’ve really improved. They’ve actually become my favorite pizza spot. Their service has tremendously improved. Everyone that I’ve encountered over the past few month has been really pleasant and helpful. The food is really good. They can still be expensive from time to time, but they do have some good deals and the portion sizes are decent.\n\n*Original Post – One Star Review* Didn’t get the chance to try the food. First experience was bad from when I first called. The worker seemed rude. When I called back someone picked up the phone but was talking to someone without ever acknowledging me. Called back again to order and they didn’t follow the pricing that’s listed on their website and I wasn’t given a time frame. After the fourth call I ended up just cancelling my order.\n\nread moreread less\n\nFaith H.\n\nI ordered a pretty big order for our office today! The manager actually delivered our order and was AMAZING! They had accidentally forgot our plates and he was extremely apologetic. He even went out of his way to run and grab some plates at the store for us. Absolutely amazing and thoughtful. Everything was hot and fresh. 10 out of 10!!!!!\n\nread moreread less\n\nSarah\n\nHonest review. We got 2 pepperoni pizzas and bone in wings. Everything was fresh and hot however this just wasn’t for us. The sauce is plain and very different tasting and has a tomato/sweet undertone. The old world pepperonis did not taste like the ones at marcos which we are used to but they were crisp like you would want. The wings have a fried breading type coating and then are dipped in a sauce after being cooked. Also not our preference. However that being said if you like your pizza and wings that way then this is the place for you but the flavors just weren’t our style. The place was very clean. Prices are steep though. $20 for a large pepperoni is a bit much.\n\nread moreread less\n\nFred B.\n\nAs usual pretty good.\n\nGot home to inspect our pizza, outer crest was burnt and hard.\n\nread moreread less\n\nRubber S.\n\nIf you love sandwiches, they were delicious and different varieties and homemade potatoes chips, we loved it…\n\nread moreread less\n\nSheryl H.\n\nWalked in, they took our order and it was maybe 15 minutes and we had our order to go. The girls working the counter were friendly and polite. We waited outside on the patio for our order and they brought it out to us. I love Flyers !!🛩️🍕\n\nread moreread less\n\njustin t.\n\nPizza in Columbus area is terrible. It is all the same… Thin crust cut into squares. Thankfully Flyers offers traditional options to satisfy us regular pizza lovers. The food has always been ready on time, and the staff is friendly.\n\nread moreread less\n\nSteve R.\n\nFirst timers. Not busy but early afternoon. Food was amazing. Had the bomber pizza I think it’s called. I must say it was everything and then some. Great service. Definitely return and bring more people\n\nPlease bring you store to Delaware. You will do great there. 👍👍\n\nread moreread less\n\nBarbara\n\nTasty thin crust pizza. Lots of toppings. Cooked just right. Delivered faster than expected! Just picked up this 1/2 bacon chicken ranch and bomber pizza. Omg soo tasty\n\nread moreread less\n\nAlan\n\nI have to say that the garlic white pizza we just had was THE BEST ever from Flyers. We make the order a bit complicated as we skip the chicken, and only want the tomatoes and garlic sauce. One half also gets mushroom/onion, but usually some gets on the other half, wife is allergic to onion so it gets tricky. Samantha, who took the order, made this one perfectly; it looked like it was cut in half first…and each half was done exactly to order. She was also very polite. I realize this all sounds a bit “much”, but my point is that this is the BEST Flyers experience ever. Now if I can figure out how to get it made like that again. 🙂\n\nread moreread less\n\nFlame E.\n\nThe Pizza was delicious. I got their cauliflower crust pizza with the chicken honey BBQ style. It was phenomenal! Their cheese bread was delicious as well! I would highly recommend them\n\nread moreread less\n\nbilly l.\n\nWe just went there and had like 15 ppl. I called early and asked about reserving seats and they said they don’t do that hut they would leave a note for the manager for that day. We arrived today and they had it saved for us. Kayla was amazing helping us with food and drinks. All the food was amazing. They made my son very happy. I will for sure be back. Thanks for everything\n\nread moreread less\n\nLinda C.\n\nWe have been getting our pizza from Flyers in West Jefferson for as long as I remember. They never disappoint. We always get the old world pepperoni!!!!!\n\nread moreread less\n\nmary m.\n\nNatasha is an excellent ambassador for your company. She is always friendly and gives outstanding customer service. In this day and age that is lacking but not at Flyers pizza. It is one of the reasons I order at least once a week from this location good job\n\nread moreread less\n\nStephanie M.\n\nFlyers is a great company with outstanding employees. The food is always delicious. I have had many different pizzas, subs, salads and wings. I have had food from 5 different Flyers and the food and the service is always consistent and outstanding. Thank you Flyers!\n\nread moreread less\n\nDana E.\n\nWe’ve picked up from the drive thru a lot but dined in for the first time tonight. The interior was clean and well maintained (possibly recently renovated). Their free chips are great! They come out warm, are a bit thicker cut but still nice and crisp, and have a great seasoning. The gentleman running the front counter greeted us right away and provided excellent friendly service. It’s so refreshing to have the staff actually engage with you.\n\nread moreread less\n\nEd S.\n\nPizzas are good and staff is friendly but man they can’t never get my girlfriend’s sub made right to save their life. I’ve been ordering here for over 6 years and the pizzas are accurate 90% of the time. Overall it’s a great pizza toppings are good, crust is good, cheese is good and the sweet pizza sauce is delicious better than anyones else’s around these parts. I order her a veggie sub no onions, no bell peppers and no green peppers. Every time I get home it has peppers or onions on it. Why is this so difficult to get right? She picks them off but its annoying. I will start checking in the parking lot but I shouldn’t have to after $40 something orders. Doesn’t seem to matter calling back and complaining because there is a entirely new Staff every time I go there. I’m not a complainer really but the last 20 orders they’ve gotten something wrong on our order 16 times I mean come on.\n\nread moreread less\n\nJason\n\nYour typical Columbus area pizza. Good sauce and decent cheese. Good amount of toppings on the pepperoni pizza. Above average pie\n\nread moreread less\n\nRobert B.\n\nImpressive. Fries were some of the best ever. Thank you for following instructions on the pizza. The sauce is very good.\n\nread moreread less\n\nJohn Y.\n\nGreat food! But.

Been short on items a few times, today ordered 2 salad dressing, only got one.\n\nread moreread less\n\nKimberly S.\n\nWe’ve been to the West Jefferson location twice in 4 months.

It was made as ordered and we didn’t have any issues.\n\nread moreread less\n\nBo B.\n\nItalian sub is very good and the 9″ is a perfect size. More meat and better bred than competitors”big don”.

Loved it then, love it now. I’m happy they still use the same sausage recipe that Wayne had. Little pricey, but what isn’t?\n\nLove the Stromboli also. Clean, friendly and great buffet!\n\nread moreread less\n\nGrady G.\n\n5 STARS FOR NATASHA – EVERY TIME she answers, she provides top notch service and is fast and accurate while also being SOO friendly and personable..

Keep it up guys!\n\nread moreread less\n\nJennifer M.\n\nToday my husband and I ordered from Flyers in Hilliard, as we frequently do. Our front door didn’t close all the way after my husband got our pizza from the delivery driver, and the wind blew it open further. Our driver Autumn went out of her way to text me to let me know it hadn’t shut because she didn’t want our pups to get out. Though they are very good dogs and don’t typically run, I am so appreciative of her doing so! Also, with it being Super Bowl Sunday, I expected it to take a little longer than normal but we received our order very quickly with no issues! Thank you for the outstanding service!\n\nread moreread less\n\nWill M.\n\nFast delivery and tasty pizza. Tried at least 4 pies and each was delicious.\n\nread moreread less\n\nYane F.\n\nPizza was great!

Love the drive thru option for pickup after ordering.\n\nread moreread less\n\nCarol R.\n\nI love their pizza, however I live an hour an a half away. I like to take a pizza home to cook later. With the fresh dough it has to be on foil or parchment to take home. They have none of this in the establishment.\n\nread moreread less\n\nAaron K.\n\nHave had several times. Very consistent, very good pizza. Have had several different pizzas from here and they’re all really good. My personal favorite is the smokin buffalo though! Just wish it was closer to home.\n\nread moreread less\n\nBrian L.\n\nGreat pizza as always. I am so glad that after years when we moved away their food still tastes the same. Very good pizza.\n\nread moreread less\n\nAlex T.\n\nGreat pizza, friendly service, traditional pizza place atmosphere (mom and pop type, i.e. not a chain feel). We looked up the pizza place in west Columbus with the highest Google rating. This one slightly edged out any others and now we know why. Crispy pepperoni, tons of toppings, good flavor. Three 15″ pizzas definitely filled up 6 hungry adults and a couple pre-schoolers.\n\nread moreread less\n\nStephanie P.\n\nCustomized a personal pizza and they made it perfectly. Fries and cookies are always fresh and hot. They forgot my ranch, but honestly the fries didn’t even need them\n\nread moreread less\n\nCasse K.\n\nUpdate 11/1 recd call from their manager. Apologized, corrected training issue, issued credit so we will be ordering from there again. Thanks for the followup!\n\nOrdered an Italian Sub. We get home and I reached for my sandwich. There was sooooo much Italian dressing on it that the paper that held the sandwich was in shreds. The bread was soaked and was soggy. This was within minutes of us picking order up. Not had this happen before, but whoever made my sandwich went crazy with the dressing.\n\nread moreread less\n\nDiana T.\n\nIt was our family’s first visit here. Our family ate inside. Workers were very nice and attentive, asking if we needed anything and made our visit memorable. Food was hot, delicious and on our table before we knew it.

Except for Flyers. We used to live close to the Groveport location & it became our go to spot.\n\nread moreread less\n\nCharacterMatterz\n\nThey knocked it out of the park.

Yes, I have a book….\n\nread moreread less\n\nKelsey H.\n\nI was looking for something new and decided to give flyers a chance. I was not disappointed! Flyers is right up there as one of the best pizzas in the area! On top of that, the customization they allow on your orders is amazing. The pizza is fantastic. I ordered breadsticks with cheese on them and added pepperoni to them. Delicious!! If you’re debating giving them a shot, do it! Highly recommend!\n\nread moreread less\n\nArlesia B.\n\n1st time buying on purpose. Other times, it was available at gatherings. They were patient with me. Very pleasant. I wanted to try everything. Ordered 2 pizzas and cheesy garlic bread. They were extremely busy that day but got us in and out. Everything was good.

Their customer service at the Hilliard location is second to none. This is THE reason I come back.\n\nread moreread less\n\nJordan Y.\n\nStaying at an Airbnb and our host recommended Zamarellis or Flyers Pizza. Flyers has a few tables outside so we chose Flyers over Zamarellis. We ordered 2 large pizzas–The Bomber and the Old World Pepperoni with extra cheese. They do a square cut. I have never seen a pizza covered with toppings loaded that much. It will be hard to eat other pizzas now. Great flavor, ingredients were fresh. They had about 10 staff working. It was busy and they said it’s busier on Weekends. Staff friendly. Staff seemed like they were working as a team and got along. Great job!!!!\n\nread moreread less\n\nLaven C.\n\nI ordered 4 pizzas 3 was medium and 1 was small and it was over $60 but the pizzas was pretty good.

I appreciate your customer service and food always tastes great\n\nread moreread less\n\nReb S.\n\nPizza is always good and so was my son’s sub. The cheesy bread is kind of a rip off because there’s no cheese on the ends.\n\nread moreread less\n\nV R.\n\nThis place was recommended to my wife and I by our nieces. Therfore we had no idea what to expect. Well we can safe the pizza is good and the chocolate chip cookies are great. We had a cheese pizza, it was fresh when we picked it up. They have a good crunchy crust, the sauce is sweet, and it had a good amount of cheese. There was nothing special about this place, but we would definitely come back if we’re in the area. They do have cheese fries and other appealing foods, so we see why our nieces love this place.\n\nread moreread less\n\ncrystal j.\n\nThe pizza was delicious and our server was as sweet as pie.\n\nread moreread less\n\nMelody R.\n\nLove the place!\n\nI live nearby so I order out from here ALOT. The staff are always on point. Always get my very specific order perfect and they’re always friendly and thoughtful. Several of them have even learned my name and recognize me and always give me extra paper plates and napkins(because they know I have a bunch of kids lol).\n\nThe food itself is also fantastic. Definitely the best pizza place in/near Groveport!!\n\nHighly recommend the funnel cake fries WITH icing!\n\nThis location even does a lot of deals and coupons, my favorite is the dinner special!\n\nKeep up the great work Flyer’s!!\n\nread moreread less\n\nTee A.\n\nOmg so good been looking for a new pizza spot and found flyers pizza in Blacklick yes my new fav😁\n\nread moreread less\n\nMark B.\n\nFantastic!

I appreciate this crew greatly for the integrity that they carry and the respect that they have for their product.\n\nNothing satisfies after a 60 hour work week like Flyers Old World Pepperoni… it just cannot be beat, and I’m originally from Chicago…that’s saying something.\n\nThank you everyone, you are appreciated.\n\nread moreread less\n\nRusty W.\n\nTheir food is great 👍 I just went for an interview but I don’t rate things out of bias. The manager seems hard at work with his shop. I noticed right away how clean the inside was so that’s great. It was small inside but cozy. Just know what you’re going there for because some hours they are open only to drive through.\n\nread moreread less\n\nDarcyDoodle (.\n\nAlways excellent service! Something as simple as requesting “no ham or salami” on my Italian Sub has left other Pizza Shops perplexed 🤯, but NOT Flyers! Its like they get that sometimes folks just want slight variations from their amazing menu selection. The BEST part is that they dont make me feel annoying when I change things up a bit. It is 💯 OKAY to veer off script. Food got a 4 star because my sub was severely under-baked, or not at all and had tomatoes that I asked to be held.\n\nread moreread less"
