        "text": "It was 1918 when my Grandpa Dominick and his brother, Uncle Jim Guido, immigrated from Cozenza, Italy. They opened their first restaurant, Wells Brothers, in Racine, Wisconsin. Following in the family tradition, my Dad, Bill Wells went to Chicago in the 1940's and learned the art of making the best pizza that can be made. Not many people know that the original Chicago-style pizza actually had the thin crust that our Guido's customers have come to love! Dad continued to work with his cousins, Guy and Tony Wells operating the restaurant that their fathers had started, with pizza and classic Italian dishes always our specialty. Today, Wells Brothers restaurant in Racine is operated by my cousins Paula & Bill and still enjoy success after nearly 90 years.\n\nIn 1962, Dad opened his first solo restaurant, the Cozy Lounge. Several years later, he changed the name to Guido's, in honor of our family's original last name. Over the years, there would be a total of ten Guido's restaurants located from Racine, Madison, and Green Bay, Wisconsin, down to Sarasota, New Port Richey, Crystal River and since 1984, Spring Hill, Florida. As I grew up, it was natural for me to work hand in hand with my father, learning the business and art of serving good food. Dad and I had a special relationship. We worked, lived, laughed and cried together. Dad passed away at the age of 73 on January 17, 2007. As the third generation owner of Guido's and after 50 years of tried and true experience, I am proud to carry on the tradition of truly caring, as my father taught me.\n\nToday, Guido's is all the more cherished by our family and devoted staff as we remember the guiding love and passion that my dad and his wife, Kelly, brought to the restaurant everyday. I too, believe that our customers are our first priority. Just like Dad, Grandpa and our family in Racine, we continuously strive to prepare the finest quality food available with courteous and efficient service in a cozy atmosphere. We hope you enjoy your dining experience. Bon Appetito!\n\nThank you,"
