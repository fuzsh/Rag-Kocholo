Zhang1, Y. L. Campbell1, S. P. Suman2, J. D. Hendrix1, W. Zhai3, S. Li2, J. Chen4, and H. Zhu4, 1Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA, 2Animal and Food Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA, 3Poultry Science, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA, 4Proteomics Core Facility, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA, *kvt34@msstate.edu\n\nObjectives: Wooden or woody breast (WB) is a myopathy in the Pectoralis major of fast-growing broilers and downgraded due to undesirable appearance and impaired nutritional quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in growth and proteomes of normal (NB) and WB among 5 genetic broiler strains.\n\nMaterials and Methods: For each of 5 strains, 128 chicks were randomly assigned to 8 pens (1 pen/block) and raised at the Mississippi State University Poultry Farm according to an approved animal welfare protocol (IACUC-16-542). After 8 wk, 4 birds/pen were randomly selected and evaluated for WB at 24 h postmortem according to Tijare et al. (2006) where breast samples were grouped into NB and WB. Completely randomized designs were used to evaluate the differences among 5 genetic strains with respect to the body, carcass, and breast weights for both NB and WB groups. Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference test was used to separate treatment means among strains (P < 0.05). A two-tailed t test was used to evaluate the difference between NB and WB within each strain (P < 0.05). A group of live male birds (1 bird/pen) were also evaluated for WB myopathy by manual palpation. Within each strain, 4 birds with NB and 4 birds with WB were selected. Next, the birds’ cranial breast muscles were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The whole muscle proteomes (3 samples/strain, 2 gels/sample) were analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for protein spots that exhibited a fold change of 2.0 threshold in spot intensity (P < 0.05).\n\nResults: Birds from strains 1, 3, and 5 in the WB group were heavier than those in the NB group (P < 0.05). Although there were no differences in breast weights within WB meat (P > 0.05), WB meat from all strains was heavier than breast meat from NB (P < 0.05). Within WB, strain 5 had a greater breast percentage than strains 1, 3, and 4 (P < 0.05). WB from strains 2–5 had a greater breast percentage than that of NB (P < 0.05). Within NB—when compared with strain 5—alpha-actin, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, cofilin-2 muscle isoform, and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2 were underexpressed (P < 0.05) in strain 2; nucleoside diphosphate kinase and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2 were underexpressed (P < 0.05) in strain 3; and myozenin-1 isoform X2 was underexpressed (P < 0.05) in strain 4. Within WB—when compared with strain 5—alpha-actinin-2 and gelsolin were overexpressed (P < 0.05) in strain 1; elongation factor 2 and myozenin-3 were underexpressed (P < 0.05) in strain 1; adenosylhomocysteinase and LIM domain-binding protein 3 were underexpressed (P < 0.05) in strain 2; and myozenin-3 and LIM domain-binding protein 3 were underexpressed (P < 0.05) in strain 3. Desmin, serum albumin precursor, annexin A5, actin-related protein 3, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, and troponin T were underexpressed (P < 0.05), while mitochondrial 60 kDa heat shock protein and myosin-binding protein H were overexpressed (P < 0.05) in strain 4 compared to strain 5.\n\nConclusion: Protein profiles of broiler breast were affected by genetic strains and the presence of WB myopathy. This helps us understand how breast muscle proteins affect the growth performance of broiler strains and further elucidates the etiology of WB development in different commercially available genetic strains.\n\nKeywords: genetics, poultry, proteomics, woody breast myopathy\n\n63 - EFFECT OF EARLY POSTMORTEM OXIDATIVE STRESS ON MITOCHONDRIAL REDOX STABILITY AND APOPTOSIS OF TWO PORCINE MUSCLES\n\nM. Abdelhaseib1*, J. Zhang1, and Y. H. B. Kim1, 1Animal Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, *maha@purdue.edu\n\nObjectives: Apoptosis has been suggested as a novel mechanism affecting meat quality attributes. Oxygen-deprivation-induced apoptosis is dependent on the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, which is closely associated with metabolic status and mitochondria dysfunction of the muscle cells. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under oxidative stress could lead to further mitochondrial damage. However, the exact mechanisms of ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of oxidative stress on early postmortem muscles and its impacts on mitochondrial functionalities and apoptosis of 2 porcine muscles.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Longissimus dorsi (LD) and Psoas major (PM) muscles were excised from 6 pork carcasses at 2 h postmortem. Each muscle sample was subdivided into 2 fractions and allocated to 2 treatments as follows; oxidizing condition as being immersed in 20 mM H2O2 for 60 min or control as being treated with distilled water. Upon treatments, all samples were vacuum packaged and stored for 0, 6, 24, and 48 h at 4°C. Biochemical attributes, including mitochondrial membrane permeability, mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial Ca2+, and cytochrome c redox stability, were determined at each storage time. Data were analyzed by SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to compare the traits across muscle types and treatments over time. Least-squares means were separated by least significant differences.\n\nResults: Overall, the mitochondrial membrane permeability was increased at 0–48 h post treatment in both muscles. PM had a higher membrane permeability than LD at 0–24 h (P < 0.05). The effect of oxidative stress on the mitochondrial membrane permeability was only significant in LD at 6–24 h. Oxidative stress resulted in a significant increase in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and Ca2+ flux in both muscles. However, PM had a greater mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and Ca2+, compared to LD (P < 0.05). While the cytochrome c redox stability decreased in both muscles, PM had a greater cytochrome c redox stability than LD (P < 0.05). These observations further support the hypothesis that ROS-mediated oxidative stress plays a major role in the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis by influencing important regulators of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. These results also imply that oxidative stress could induce the rate and extent of apoptosis process, but it could be muscle specific.\n\nConclusion: The ROS generated by H2O2 significantly increased the mitochondrial oxidative stress levels. The results from the present study found that ROS-mediated oxidative stress enhanced the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indicated by increased mitochondrial membrane permeability, mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, and overload of the production of mitochondrial Ca2+, from early postmortem muscles. However, the rate and extent of response to the given oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis could be muscle specific, where PM showed more ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis compared to LD. Further research looking into the impact of oxidative-stress-mediated apoptosis on proteolytic enzyme activity and subsequent myofibrillar protein degradation is currently underway.\n\nKeywords: apoptosis, pork loins, reactive oxygen species\n\n64 - EFFECT OF COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND COOKING ENDPOINT TEMPERATURE ON THE FLAVOR PROFILE OF BEEF\n\nN. Prieto1*, J. L. Aalhus1, I. L. Larsen1, Z. Pietrasik2, and N. J. Gaudette2, 1Lacombe Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Lacombe, Canada, 2Food Processing Development Centre, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Leduc, Canada, *nuria.prietobenavides@canada.ca\n\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of country of origin and cooking endpoint temperature on the flavor profile of beef.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Full ribeye primals (Longissimus thoracis) were purchased from Australia (n = 18), Canada (n = 16), and the US (n = 20) to represent Meat Standards Australia Grade 4 star mixed grain, Canadian AAA barley, or USDA Choice corn-finished beef steers, respectively. Upon arrival at the Lacombe Research and Development Centre (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Canada), all ribeyes were aged at 2°C until 45 d to equal the aging time incurred during shipping of the Australian product, and subsequently frozen at −35°C until analyses. Two 2.5-cm steaks from each loin were cut, thawed overnight under refrigeration, and randomly grilled to an internal endpoint temperature of either 63°C (rare) or 71°C (medium-well). Steaks were presented in a balanced design to a 9-member trained sensory panel to rate the intensity of aromas (n = 19), tastes (n = 5), and flavors (n = 19) using a 15-cm line scale. Flavor profile data were analyzed using the MIXED model procedure of SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), with the main effects of country of origin and endpoint cooking temperature and their interaction in the model, and panel session and assessor and their interactions included as random effects.\n\nResults: Beef identity and buttery flavors were rated higher (P < 0.05) in Canadian and US compared to Australian steaks, whereas bitter taste and barnyard, liver-like, and rancid flavors were higher (P < 0.05) in Australian than in both Canadian and US steaks. Canadian steaks presented higher (P < 0.05) fat-like flavor than Australian and US steaks, whereas brown roasted flavor was higher in US, lower in Australian, and intermediate in Canadian steaks (P < 0.05). Steaks cooked to a 63°C endpoint presented higher (P < 0.05) cruciferous aroma, sour taste, and bloody/serumy and sour/dairy flavors and tended (P < 0.1) to have higher metallic flavor than the 71°C steaks. Steaks cooked at 71°C had higher (P < 0.05) sweet taste and beef identity flavor and tended (P < 0.1) to have higher buttery flavor and brown roasted aroma and flavor than the 63°C steaks. There was only one significant interaction between endpoint cooking temperature and country of origin; the 71°C treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased the beef identity flavor compared to the 63°C in Canadian steaks, but no cooking endpoint temperature effect was observed for this flavor attribute in either US or Australian steaks.\n\nConclusion: Even after 45 d of aging, trained panelists were able to discern variations in beef taste/flavor intensities arising from production differences in country of origin. Cooking beef steaks to a low endpoint temperature of 63°C resulted in a combination of aromas, tastes, and flavors that may be attributed to limited formation of Maillard reaction products. Increasing endpoint temperature to 71°C lengthened the cooking time and contributed to additional flavor development. Nevertheless, the endpoint temperature increasing from 63°C to 71°C did not enhance umami taste regardless of country of origin, which suggests that higher temperatures/longer cooking times may be required to promote the formation of umami compounds.\n\nKeywords: beef, cooking endpoint temperature, country of origin, flavor\n\n65 - THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HINDGUT MICROBIOMES AND CARCASS MERIT IN ANGUS STEERS\n\nT. Krause1*, J. Lourenco1, C. Welch1, T. Callaway1, and T. D. Pringle1, 1Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA, *trk73598@uga.edu\n\nObjectives: It is well known that microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle contribute protein and energy to meet the host’s nutrient requirements. These nutrients go on to influence animal performance and ultimately carcass composition. While the rumen is often accredited with the largest contribution of nutrients to requirements, recent research has suggested that the secondary fermentation occurring in the hindgut may also provide significant levels of nutrients that may explain portions of the variation seen in animal performance. Therefore, variation in carcass value, through the quality and quantity of beef produced, could be partially attributed to variation in the microbial fermentation occurring in the hindgut. The objective of this study was to determine whether dissimilarities in microbial taxa from the cecum and rectum contents of Angus steers could be correlated to differences in carcass lipid accretion in terms of intramuscular and subcutaneous fat deposition.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Twenty-four Angus steers were slaughtered to collect cecum contents, feces, longissimus muscle samples, and measurements for the calculation of carcass quality and yield grades. Cecal and fecal microbial DNA extraction and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing were performed to determine microbial relative abundances. Proximate analysis was performed to determine chemical lipid content of longissimus muscle samples. A variety of correlation and regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationships between the cecal and fecal microbiomes and carcass traits.\n\nResults: The relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria in the feces was negatively correlated to marbling score (P = 0.009) and longissimus lipid content (P = 0.015), indicating that lower abundances of bacteria within the phylum Proteobacteria may be linked to greater intramuscular adipose accumulation. The abundance of the family Succinivibrionaceae in the feces was negatively correlated to longissimus lipid content (P = 0.017), and within that family, the genus Succinivibrio was negatively correlated to longissimus lipid content (P = 0.018). In the feces, the abundance of the genus Ruminococcus was positively correlated to longissimus lipid content (P = 0.031). In the cecum, the abundance of the genus Mycoplasma was positively correlated to marbling score (P = 0.029). In contrast, the abundance of the genus Methanosphaera in the cecum was negatively correlated to marbling score (P = 0.03), suggesting that lower abundances of methane-producing bacteria in the cecum may be linked to greater marbling deposition through reductions in energy wasting in the hindgut. The genus Bulleidia was positively correlated to 12th rib adjusted backfat thickness (P = 0.002) and yield grade (P = 0.019), suggesting that greater abundances of bacteria within this genus in the cecum may be linked to increased subcutaneous fat deposition.\n\nConclusion: No other bacterial taxa in the hindgut were correlated with 12th rib adjusted backfat thickness or yield grade, indicating that the hindgut microbiome may not play a substantial role in subcutaneous fat deposition. The hindgut microbiome may, however, influence intramuscular fat deposition through the fermentation end products of various microbial taxa. Overall, these results suggest that the microbiomes of the cecum and rectum impact adipose accumulation in the carcass via distinct mechanisms due to the lack of overlap in significant taxa.\n\nKeywords: hindgut microbiome, lipid, marbling, subcutaneous fat, yield grade\n\n66 - PALATABILITY ASSESSMENTS OF BEEF TOP LOIN STEAKS PORTIONED BY WEIGHT OR BY THICKNESS SOURCED FROM VARIOUS CARCASS WEIGHT/RIBEYE SIZE COMBINATIONS\n\nM. K. Foster1, K. R. Caldwell1, R. R. Kirkpatrick1*, A. N. Arnold1, D. B. Griffin1, K. B. Gehring1, J. W. Savell1, 1Animal Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, *j-savell@tamu.edu\n\nObjectives: The study objectives were (1) to determine whether carcass weights and ribeye sizes influence consumer acceptance of beef top loin steaks and (2) to determine whether differences exist in palatability between steak portions cut by thickness and those by weight.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Beef carcass sides (n = 90) were selected to be USDA Choice (Small marbling only) and to meet a 3 × 3 treatment scheme of ribeye area (REA) sizes (83.9 to 89.8 cm2, 90.3 to 96.1 cm2, and 96.7 to 102.6 cm2) and hot carcass weights (HCW) (340.6 to 385 kg, 386.0 to 430.9 kg, and 431.4 to 476.3 kg). Beef strip loins were obtained, vacuum packaged, boxed, and shipped to a collaborating purveyor. Subprimals were passed through a Marel® intelligent portion cutter (M Series 3000, Marel®, Lenexa, KS) intelligent portion cutter to generate steaks with 2 target endpoints: (1) portion thickness of 3.18 cm and (2) portion weight of 340 g. Steaks were assigned to either consumer sensory panel (n = 360) or Warner-Bratzler shear (WBS) force (n = 180) determinations, individually vacuum packaged, transported in insulated containers, and flash frozen for 24 h at −40°C before storage at −20°C until analyses were performed. Steaks were thawed (2°C to 4°C) for approximately 28 h before being cooked on grated, nonstick electric grills preheated to a surface temperature of 177°C ± 2°C. Steaks were flipped at internal temperatures of 35°C and were removed from the grills at 70°C. Cooked steaks for WBS force evaluation were placed on metal trays in a single layer, covered with plastic wrap, and stored (2°C to 4°C) for approximately 12 to 16 h before six 1.3-cm cores were removed for WBS force determinations. Steaks for consumer panels (IRB2019-0820M) were held in an Alto-Shaam oven set at 60°C for not more than 20 min before serving to panelists, who scored steak samples on 9-point scales (9 = like extremely; 1 = dislike extremely). Analysis of variance was performed wherein the main effects of REA, HCW, and portioning method (thickness or weight) along with the REA × HCW interaction were included.\n\nResults: There were REA × HCW interactions for WBS values for both steaks portioned by thickness (P = 0.031) and by weight (P = 0.014). In both cases, the trend was for the lowest WBS values to be from the lightest HCW/smallest REA combinations with the highest WBS values among the largest REA categories regardless of HCW category. Regardless of these trends, WBS values were all extremely low and met most thresholds for “very tender” classifications. When portioned by thickness, there were REA × HCW interactions for overall liking (P = 0.042) and flavor liking (P = 0.006). In both cases, there were significant differences among the palatability ratings for HCW within the largest REA category, whereas HCW did not impact these ratings within the other 2 REA categories. It is not clear why this occurred. When portioned by weight, only overall liking (P = 0.42) and tenderness liking (P = 0.009) were impacted by REA with the highest ratings given to the smallest REA category. No palatability trait was influenced by HCW.\n\nConclusion: Carcass weight and ribeye size do impact beef steak palatability. Fortunately, all palatability ratings and shear force values were in ranges thought to be highly acceptable.\n\nKeywords: beef, carcass weight, palatability, ribeye area, Warner-Bratzler shear force\n\n67 - CONSUMER PALATABILITY OF AUSTRALIAN GRASS- AND GRAIN-FED SMOKED BEEF RIBS\n\nJ. C. Sarchet1*, N. C. Hardcastle1, A. J. Garmyn1, R. J. Polkinghorne2, and M. F. Miller1, 1Animal and Food Science, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA, 2Birkenwood, Birkenwood, Hawthorne, Australia, *jcsarchet@sbcglobal.net\n\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to identify the effects of grade, diet (grass vs. grain), muscle, and hold time on the consumer palatability of smoked beef ribs.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Beef ribs of varying quality grades (2, 3, 4, 5) were collected from 2 commercial abattoirs in Australia, equally representing grass- and grain-fed carcasses. The subprimals were then vacuum packaged, frozen at 3 d postmortem, and shipped frozen to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. Upon arrival, the ribs were sorted into cook batches and returned to frozen storage (−20°C). Prior to cooking, ribs were thawed, excess external fat was trimmed, and ribs were lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. On their designated testing day, ribs were placed in electric pellet smokers (Green Mountain Grills set to 120°C) and cooked until reaching an internal temperature of 93.3°C. After removal from the smoker and resting for at least 30 min, the rib meat was deboned and separated into intercostales externus et internis (INT), as well as chuck and rib portions of the serratus ventralis (SV). The samples were allocated to serve time treatment. Half of the samples were held warm (~60°C) and fed to consumers; the other half were vacuum packaged, refrigerated for 7 d, reheated, and served the following week. Hot and reheated samples were fed to consumers and evaluated for tenderness, juiciness, flavor liking, overall liking, and satisfaction. Consumer data were analyzed to determine the effects of Meat Standards Australia (MSA) grade, diet, muscle, serve time (hot vs. reheat), and their interactions. Only MSA grade × diet remained in the model as a fixed effect (P < 0.05).\n\nResults: There was an interaction (P < 0.01) between quality grade and diet for all palatability attributes and consumer satisfaction scores. Grass-fed samples from grade 2 (lowest) carcasses were scored lower (P < 0.05) than their grain-fed counterparts for all traits. Tenderness was greater (P < 0.05) for grass-fed samples from grade 3 carcasses compared to grain-fed samples, but all other palatability traits were similar for grade 3 carcasses. Flavor liking, overall liking, and satisfaction were greater (P < 0.05) for grade 4 grass-fed carcasses compared to grain fed, but the opposite trend was observed for grade 5 (highest grade) carcasses, where grain-fed samples were preferred (P < 0.05). Additionally, consumers were able to distinguish (P < 0.01) between muscle for all palatability traits and consumer satisfaction. The SV rib portion was scored greater (P < 0.05) for all traits compared to the SV chuck portion or INT. The SV chuck portion was scored greater (P < 0.05) for flavor and overall liking and satisfaction compared to INT, but those samples did not differ for tenderness or juiciness. Panelists also noted a difference in serve time for juiciness, flavor liking, overall liking, and consumer satisfaction (P < 0.01), where hot samples were scored more favorably than reheated samples.\n\nConclusion: Quality grade and diet interacted to affect the eating quality of smoked beef ribs, with inconsistent trends between MSA grade depending on the diet. The palatability of the posterior end of the SV was preferred by consumers compared to the anterior portion and to the rib fingers, when prepared using a smoked cookery method. Samples served hot were scored more favorably for all palatability traits, except tenderness, compared to reheated samples.\n\nKeywords: beef ribs, consumer, palatability, quality grade, smoking\n\n68 - EVALUATION OF DIETARY ZINC SUPPLEMENTATION ON LAMB PERFORMANCE AND CARCASS CHARACTERISTICS\n\nJ. G. Logar1*, C. L. Gifford1, R. M. Knuth1, H. C. Cunningham-Hollinger1, A. L. Julian1, C. M. Page1, J. R. Whaley1, B. Bisha1, and W. C. Stewart1, 1Animal Science, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, USA, *jakelogar57@gmail.com\n\nObjectives: The objectives of this study were to assess the impacts of feeding 3 concentrations of a dietary zinc supplement pellet on lamb feedlot performance, carcass characteristics, and nutrient composition.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Commercial Rambouillet lambs (n = 33) were weighed (49.0 ± 1.0 kg) and randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups consisting of a zinc-sulfate (80%) and zinc amino acid (20%) complex supplementation pellet (Zinpro Corp., Eden Prairie, MN) included in feedlot diets. Treatment groups consisted of diets with a zinc concentration of 72.7 mg/kg (T1), 95.5 mg/kg (T2), or 315 mg/kg (T3). Individual feed intake and body weights were recorded at day 10, 24, 38, 52, 66, and 73. Following the feeding phase, lambs were transported to a commercial harvest facility, and samples of the liver were collected for mineral analysis. At 24 h postmortem, carcasses were allowed at least 20 min to bloom after being ribbed between the 12th and 13th rib and carcass characteristics were measured. Objective color (L*, a*, and b*) scores were measured from the Longissimus dorsi and Rectus abdominis (flank) by obtaining 3 scans and recording a mean reading (HunterLab MiniScan EZ 45/O-L; Reston, VA). Samples of the Longissimus dorsi were removed from the 13th rib region of each carcass for proximate composition. All data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\n\nResults: An interaction between treatment and feeding period was observed for dry matter intake (P < 0.001). No treatment effects were identified for growth performance, but average daily gain (P < 0.001) and grain/feed ratio (P = 0.04) was greatest during the final feeding period. Treatment impacted a* values (P < 0.05) of the flank, resulting in greater a* values of the flank from lambs in the T2 treatment group compared to the T3 treatment group. Treatment did not affect L* (P = 0.37) and b* (P = 0.11) values from either muscle. No treatment differences were identified for other carcass characteristics, proximate composition, or mineral analysis, but a trend of higher sodium (P = 0.06) among the T1 treatment group and lower calcium (P = 0.07) among the T3 treatment group was observed.\n\nConclusion: Results suggest that dietary zinc supplementation impacts dry matter intake dry matter intake and redness values in the flank of lamb carcasses. This information will be beneficial to future work assessing optimal level of zinc supplementation in feedlot lambs.\n\nKeywords: carcass characteristics, lamb performance, zinc supplementation\n\n69 - INFLUENCE OF CARCASS CHILLING SYSTEM ON CHUCK, LOIN, AND ROUND TEMPERATURE DECLINE\n\nL. M. Hite1*, C. E. Bakker1, T. C. DeHaan1, A. D. Blair1, K. R. Underwood1, and J. K. Grubbs1, 1Animal Science, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD, USA, *lydia.hite@sdstate.edu\n\nObjectives: Spray chilling has been utilized to replace loss of moisture and increase yields during beef chilling. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of spray chilling beef carcasses on temperature decline of the chuck, loin, and round.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Ten beef animals were slaughtered at the South Dakota State University Meat Laboratory across 2 slaughter days (n = 5/d). Hot carcass weight for each side was recorded. The left side of each carcass was chilled by air movement only (AIR), and the right side was spray chilled (SPRY). Air temperature of the cooler was 3.8°C (range 2.5°C–6.0°C), and air movement was 3,500 m2/min. The SPRY treatment was chilled under similar conditions to the AIR treatment with addition of a timed spray of chilled water at 5.5°C with a volume of 3.78 L for 80 s repeated every 32 min for 24 h via 10 sprinkler heads. Temperature data loggers were placed in the round, loin, and chuck of each side 60 min postmortem, and temperature was recorded at multiple positions every 30 min. Loggers were placed in the center of the round in the semimembranosus at depths of 20.32, 15.24, 10.16, and 5.08 cm from the surface. Loggers were placed in the chuck immediately posterior to the foreleg in the pocket between the brisket and the chuck in the serratus ventralis at depths of 20.32, 15.24, and 10.16 cm. A data logger was placed 10.16 cm deep into the longissimus lumborum of the loin, at the third lumbar vertebra. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Hot carcass weight was used as a covariate for all data. Temperature decline from the round and chuck were analyzed as repeated measures with day, time, treatment, and logger depth and their interactions as fixed variables. Temperature decline from the loin was analyzed as a repeated measure with day, time, and treatment and their interactions as fixed variables. Statistical significance was considered at an alpha of P < 0.05.\n\nResults: Sides exposed to SPRY treatment were cooler (P < 0.001) than AIR chilled sides in the round, loin, and chuck. No treatment by time interactions were observed for any primal (P > 0.05). A treatment by depth interaction was observed in the chuck (P = 0.001) with SPRY sides having lower temperatures than AIR sides at the 10.16-cm depth (21.4°C vs. 22.5°C; P < 0.0001) and 20.32-cm depth (23.4°C vs. 24.0°C; P = 0.0006). A depth by time interaction was observed in the round (P < 0.0001). In the round at time 0, the 5.08-cm probe recorded lower (30.0°C; P < 0.0001) temperatures compared to the 10.16-, 15.24-, and 20.32-cm probes, which were similar (39.5°C, 40.2°C, and 39.8°C, respectively; P > 0.05). At 1,440 min, as depth in the round increased, temperature increased and differed at each depth (5.2°C at 5.08 cm, 10.2°C at 10.16 cm, 12.2°C at 15.24 cm, and 13.6°C at 20.32 cm; P < 0.0001).\n\nConclusion: Spray chilling of beef carcasses resulted in lower internal temperatures in the round, loin, and chuck compared to the air chilled sides. Internal temperature decline differs between carcass locations and muscle depth. Tissue closer to the surface reached lower temperatures and chilled faster than deep tissue in both AIR and SPRY treatments. These data suggest that spray chilling helps chill carcasses more rapidly; however, additional research is needed to optimize spray chilling systems.\n\nKeywords: beef, internal, spray chilling, temperature\n\n70 - SMART TUMBLING IMPROVED QUALITY AND PALATABILITY ATTRIBUTES OF FRESH BEEF M. LONGISSIMUS LUMBORUM AND M. SEMITENDINOSUS\n\nJ. R. Tuell1* and Y. H. B. Kim1, 1Animal Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, *tuell@purdue.edu\n\nObjectives: Beef round muscles often exhibit unacceptable tenderness and require extensive aging to reach targeted eating quality. Our recent study indicated a feasibility in improving tenderness of beef loins immediately following the tumbling process without the use of brine enhancement, as well as promoting enzymatic degradation of muscle fiber structure with aging (termed Smart Tumbling). However, it is currently unknown whether consumers would find a tumbled fresh beef product to be acceptable, as well as what role muscle type (i.e., tender vs. tough) may have. As such, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of Smart Tumbling on the quality attributes and consumer acceptability of 2 beef muscles.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Beef loin (M. Longissimus lumborum [LL]) and eye of round (M. Semitendinosus [ST]) muscles (n = 16; USDA Low Choice) at 5 d postmortem were cut into 4 sections and allocated among 4 tumbling (T) treatments (in minutes: T0 [control], T40, T80, T120). The beef sections were individually vacuum packaged, tumbled in a Lance LT-30 at 8.5 rpm, and aged either 0 d or 10 d. Meat quality attributes, including pH, water-holding capacity, Warner-Bratzler shear force, and instrumental color, were analyzed. Consumer sensory evaluations (n = 120) per each muscle were conducted by assessing their liking of various attributes including tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and overall acceptability. A model per each muscle was created using the MIXED procedure of SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with tumbling and aging durations serving as fixed effects and carcass included as a random effect.\n\nResults: Both Smart Tumbling and aging main effects decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force in LL, but only aging improved instrumental tenderness in ST (P < 0.05). The consumer panel could clearly distinguish tenderness differences between Smart Tumbled and control (T0) beef samples from both LL and ST. Consumers found LL steaks tumbled for any duration to be more tender than the control (P < 0.05), whereas juiciness, flavor, and overall liking were unaffected (P > 0.05). In particular, Smart Tumbled steaks from LL (T120) without further aging had equivalent tenderness liking values to control steaks with additional 10-d aging (P > 0.05). Consumer panelists found improved tenderness values for Smart Tumbled (T120) steaks from ST (P = 0.050) after 10 d of aging, while no positive aging impact was found in the non-tumbled control (T0) counterpart (P > 0.05). This may be attributed to a similar interaction observed in liking of juiciness in ST (P < 0.05). Smart Tumbling increased cooking loss in LL (P < 0.05) regardless of aging duration, while 10-d aging appeared to mitigate tumbling-induced detriments to cooking loss in ST (P < 0.05). Smart Tumbling did not impact color attributes at either aging duration (P > 0.05).\n\nConclusion: Overall, the results suggest that tumbling vacuum-packaged fresh beef (Smart Tumbling) can improve tenderness and possibly other eating quality attributes of beef LL and ST muscles. Smart Tumbling may allow fresh beef muscles to reach targeted eating quality outcomes with shorter aging. As the effects of combined tumbling and aging treatment appear to be muscle specific, further study on other muscles (i.e., round and sirloin) would be warranted.\n\nKeywords: beef tenderness, consumer evaluation, meat tumbling, natural processing, sensory panel\n\n71 - EFFECT OF REPLACING COTTONSEED MEAL AND SORGHUM GRAIN WITH CORN DRIED DISTILLERS GRAINS WITH SOLUBLES IN LAMB FEEDLOT DIETS ON VOLATILE AROMA COMPOUNDS OF LAMB CHOPS\n\nK. M. Hodges1, Z. Hicks1*, C. R. Kerth1, T. R. Whitney2, K. R. Wall1, R. K. Miller1, W. S. Ramsey1, and D. R. Woerner3, 1Department of Animal Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, 2Department of Animal Science, Texas A&M AgriLife Research, San Angelo, TX, USA, 3Department of Animal and Food Sciences, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA, *zmhicks@tamu.edu\n\nObjectives: The objective of this project was the examine the presence or absence of volatile aroma compounds in lamb chops from lambs fed diets differing in percentage of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS).\n\nMaterials and Methods: Frozen Longissimus muscles (n = 45) were received from lambs fed one of 5 different treatment diets: cotton seed meal, sorghum grain, and cotton seed hulls, but no DDGS (CNTL), and 4 treatment diets that were similar to CNTL but did not contain cotton seed meal where corn DDGS replaced 0% (0DDGS), 33% (33DDGS), 66% (66DDGS), or 100% (100DDGS) of the sorghum grain in the treatment diets (9 lambs/treatment). Each frozen loin was cut into 2.54-cm chops and stored at −10°C until cooking. Chops were thawed (4°C) for 12 to 24 h, then cooked on a 2.54-cm-thick flat-top grill set at 177°C ± 2.8°C. Chops were cooked until the internal temperature reached 35°C, were turned, and continued cooking to a final internal temperature of 71°C. Chops were cut into cubes (1.3 cm × 1.3 cm × chop thickness), trimmed of excess fat and connective tissue, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until volatile analysis. Samples were placed in a glass jar with a Teflon lid, placed in a water bath (60°C), and thawed for 60 min. Then, a solid-phase micro-extraction portable filed sampler was placed in the headspace for 2 h to collect volatile compounds. The solid-phase micro-extraction was then injected into a multidimensional gas chromatographer/mass spectrometer that desorbed, separated, and identified each volatile compound. Data were analyzed using JMP version 14.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) using model fitment for a completely randomized design with finishing diet as fixed effects. Treatments were testing using one of the following: orthogonal contrasts of CNTL versus 0DDGS; or linear or quadratic effects of 0DDGS, 33DDGS, 66DDGS, and 100DDGS diets with the highest order relationship (linear or quadratic; P ≤ 0.05) discussed.\n\nResults: The volatile aroma compounds 2-heptenal (fried, buttery), heptanal (fatty), and 2-pentyl furan (caramel-like) linearly increased (P < 0.03) as DDGS increased. Conversely, 2-butanone (fruity) linearly decreased (P = 0.004) as DDGS increased. Furthermore, 2-heptanone (banana, fruity aroma) tended (P = 0.065) to increase linearly with increasing DDGS. 2-(hexyloxy)-ethanol had a quadratic decrease with up to 33DDGS in the diet and then an increase to 100DDGS in the diet (P = 0.005); however, 2,3-octanedoine and methyl pyrazine quadratically increased to 33DDGS then decreased to 100DDGS (P < 0.05). 2-ethyl-5-methyl pyrazine tended (P = 0.089) to increase quadratically to 33DDGS then decrease as DDGS increased above that, and 2,5-dimethyl pyrazine tended (P = 0.089) to decrease with increasing DDGS in the diet. Decanal (orange, citrus flavor) tended (P = 0.054) to be lower in the CNTL diet when contrasted with the 0DDGS diet.\n\nConclusion: Replacing cottonseed meal with dried distillers grains in lamb feedlot diets alters the composition of volatile compounds of lamb chops. Aromatic compounds that are perceived as fried, fatty, and caramel aromas increased as DDGS increased, suggesting that higher levels of 33% to 66% DDGS may improve flavor in lamb chops.\n\nKeywords: gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, lamb, volatile compounds\n\n72 - INFLUENCE OF FEEDING COMPOSITION AND STORAGE TIME ON PHYSIC-CHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF CHURRA LAMB MEAT\n\nP. E. S. Munekata1*, R. Bermudez1, M. Pateiro1, R. Dominguez1, A. Maggiolino2, D. Franco1, and J. M. Lorenzo1, 1Food Science and Technology, Centro Tecnológico de la Carne de Galicia, Ourense, Spain, 2Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy, *paulosichetti@ceteca.net\n\nObjectives: The use of natural and residual sources from food processing in animal feeding is an important strategy to evolve the meat productive sector towards more sustainable practices and also reduce the environmental impact of food processing. Apple is an important source of nutrients, and heather (Calluna vulgaris) is a relevant source of bioactive compounds found in several countries of Europe. In this sense, the present study aimed to study the effect of apple, heather, and their combination and the storage time in the physic-chemical parameters of Churra lamb meat.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The handling of animals was performed according to the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (2010). Sixty Churra male lambs (already weaned, 6 to 8 wk old) were used. The animals were separated in 5 groups according to diet composition: Control (14), Concentrate (12), Apple (12), Heather (11), or Heather + Apple (11). The water and feeding were offered ad libitum. The lambs were slaughtered at age 4 mo in a commercial abattoir (1.5 h transport) where they were stunned, exsanguinated (jugular vein), eviscerated, and skinned. The carcasses were chilled for 24 h at 4°C. The meat samples were collected from the longissimus thoracis muscle, vacuum packaged, and stored for 3, 9, and 15 d at 4°C. During the storage period, the meat samples were evaluated regarding the pH, color, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and texture. The influence of feeding composition and storage time on quality characteristics of Churra lamb meat were examined using analysis of variance, with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).\n\nResults: Regarding the pH, the lowest value (P < 0.05) was obtained from animals fed with Concentrate after 3 d of storage. This difference was not observed on other storage days wherein the pH values ranged from 5.61 to 5.74. In the case of L*, not-significant differences were obtained from storage time and feeding composition. Differently, the a* value increased during storage for all animals regardless of feeding composition. A similar outcome was obtained for b* for animals fed with Control, Concentrate, and Heather + Apple. The storage time reduced the firmness, shear force, and total work of Churra lamb meat, particularly after 9 d of storage. The formation of lipid oxidation increased gradually (P < 0.05) during storage, but it was not affected by feeding composition.\n\nConclusion: The inclusion of apple, heather, and their combination were associated with minimal effect on physic-chemical parameters of Churra lamb meat and could be used in its production.\n\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by European Research Area on Sustainable Animal Production Systems (SusAn, ERA-NETSUSAN 2016/48 [PCIN-2017-053], EcoLamb project).

Setyabrata1*, S. Xue1,2, K. Vierck3, J. Legako3, B. R. Cooper4, T. J. Sobreira4, and Y. H. B. Kim1, 1Meat Science and Muscle Biology Lab, Department of Animal Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, 2Key Laboratory of Meat Products Processing, Ministry of Agriculture; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Meat Production and Processing, Quality and Safety Control; College of Food Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China, 3Department of Animal and Food Science, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA, 4Bindley Bioscience Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, *dsetyabr@purdue.edu\n\nObjectives: Postmortem aging has been well known to improve meat palatability. Dry aging, specifically, has been known to improve flavor of the meat, generating unique flavor such as beefy and umami. However, compounds that are associated with dry-aged beef flavor have not been fully identified and understood. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify flavor-related compounds that can be naturally liberated through different aging methods.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Paired beef loins (M. longissimus lumborum) from 13 cull cow carcasses (42 mo +, Holstein) were collected 5 d postmortem, split into 4 equal portions, and randomly assigned to 4 different aging treatments: wet aging (WA), conventional dry aging, dry aging in water-permeable bag, and conventional dry aging with ultraviolet light (2 treatment/d, 5 J/s/treatment) for 28 d at 2°C, 65% relative humidity, and 0.8 m/s air flow. After aging, loins were trimmed, and steaks were collected for sensory evaluation, biochemical analyses, and metabolomics analysis. Steaks were evaluated for various flavor and palatability attributes by both trained (n = 11) and consumer (n = 130) panelists. The free amino acid concentration, fatty acid profile, and volatile content were measured for all treatments. Metabolomics were analyzed using an ultraperformance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry system. All data were analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Least-squares means for all traits were separated (F-test, P < 0.05) using the PDIFF option. Principal component analysis was performed on the metabolites using R software.\n\nResults: From the analysis, 1,407 metabolites were detected, and 60 were significantly affected by the treatments (P < 0.05). Of these, 44 were able to be identified. Greater abundance of protein metabolites was observed in all dry aging treatments compared to WA. Similarly, free amino acids analysis also showed significant treatment effect, where dry-aged samples had greater abundance of amino acids compared to WA (P < 0.05), except for aspartate, hydroxyproline, and cysteine. No difference in the fatty acid profile was found between different aging treatments (P > 0.05). More lipid-related metabolites, however, were identified in the WA treatment, potentially from the limited exposure to the environment. Volatile analysis indicated that dry aging generated more volatile compounds, especially from hydrocarbon and alcohol groups, compared to WA. Additionally, more sulfur containing compounds, such as thioproline and erysothiopine, were observed in dry aging treatments compared to WA. Sulfur containing compounds have been often related to desirable flavor in beef product. The trained panel identified that conventional dry aging steaks and steaks dry-aged in water-permeable bag had significantly lower fat and sour flavor and a trend of lower oxidized flavor (P = 0.07) compared to steaks from WA and conventional dry aging with ultraviolet light. The consumer panel, however, found no differences in sensory attributes between treatments (P > 0.05).\n\nConclusion: The results showed that dry aging treatments resulted in greater amino acids and sulfur containing compounds, whereas more lipid-related compounds were observed in WA. This observation potentially indicates that different postharvest aging methods could affect the liberation of flavor-related compounds of beef. Further research correlating these compounds to sensory quality and conducting pathway analyses to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which dry-aged beef flavor-related compounds can be generated is currently underway.\n\nKeywords: cull cow, dry aging, metabolomics, volatile compounds\n\n74 - TASTE-RELATED COMPONENTS IN HANWOO STEER AND COW LONGISSIMUS DORSI MUSCLES\n\nS. Cho1, K.-H. Seol1, S. M. Kang1, Y. Kim1, H.-W. Seo1, J.-H. Kim1, and H. V. Ba1*, 1Animl Products Utilization Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Wanju-gun, Republic of Korea, *smkang1014@naver.com\n\nObjectives: Taste (e.g., sweetness and umami, etc.) is an important factor affecting the eating quality of beef. Cow and steer are the 2 main sex classifications of Hanwoo (Korean native cattle) beef in the Korean meat market. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine and compare the taste-related components of beef from Hanwoo steers and cows.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles (n = 10 per sex class) with the same quality grade (1+ grade) collected from the left sides of Hanwoo steers (31–32 mo old) and cows (47–53 mo old) at 24 h postmortem were used in the present investigation. The average marbling scores and intramuscular fat content of the LD muscles used were 6.8 and 6.0, and 17.82% and 16.69%, for the steers and cows, respectively. After trimming of visual fats, the lean muscles were used for analysis of taste-related components including free amino acids (FAA), metabolites, and nucleotides. The FAA were analyzed using an ultraperformance liquid chromatography, and the results were expressed as milligram per 100 g meat. Nucleotides were analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography, and then were identified by using external standards. For metabolite analysis, each sample (20 mg) was extracted with acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) mixture. The extracts were freezing-dried and then dissolved in deuterated water containing 2 mM 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionicacid-d4 as an internal standard. 1H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra were acquired on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with 600 MHz 4-mm gHX NanoProbe at a 1H frequency of 599.93 MHz. Metabolites were tentatively identified using a 600 MHz library database and NMR.\n\nResults: Based on their similar taste qualities, researchers have classified the FAA into several classes, such as umami, saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, and sourness. The outcome of our analysis revealed that the levels of some FAA associated with umami (e.g., glutamic acid and lysine), sweetness (e.g., proline and glutamic acid), and saltiness (e.g., histidine and glutamic acid) in the LD muscles were significantly higher in the cows compared to the steers (P < 0.05). No differences were found in amounts of all the detected nucleotides (hypoxanthine, uridine, guanosine monophosphate, inosine 5′-phosphate) between the 2 types of beef (P > 0.05). A total of 27 metabolites were identified in the LD muscles of both cattle genders. Out of them, 8 compounds (e.g., acetate, creatine, creatinine, glucose, glycine, inosine, trimethylalanine, and tyrosine) showed their significantly higher amounts in the cow meat compared with those in steer meat (P < 0.05).\n\nConclusion: The cattle sex type partly showed its effects on the levels of taste-related components (e.g., FAA and metabolites) in the 1+ grade LD muscles. However, further study is needed to determine the associations of the identified taste-related compounds with eating quality attributes of cooked beef.\n\nKeywords: Hanwoo, taste, free amino acid, metabolite, nucleotide\n\n75 - THE INVESTIGATION OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF VITAMIN A AND ITS EFFECTS ON CARCASS TRAITS, AND THE CONVERSION RATE OF EXTERNAL FAT COLOR IN CULL COWS\n\nJ. T. Parkinson1*, H. J. Cochran1, A. E. Relling1, S. L. Boyles1, and L. G. Garcia1, 1Animal Science, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA, *parkinson.78@osu.edu\n\nObjectives: The study objective was to evaluate different feeding strategies and their effects on fat color, carcass yield, and quality traits in cull cows.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Angus crossbreed cull cows (n = 98) were used with a feeding time of 56 d under clean bunk management. Cows were blocked by location and year and then divided into 2 feed treatments (8 pens with 7 to 22 cows per pen). Each treatment had 4 replications, and pens were used as the experimental unit. Treatments included low vitamin A (LVA) and high vitamin A (HVA) diets. The LVA diet was formulated using corn, soybean hulls, soybean meal, and a mineral-vitamin supplement. The HVA diet was formulated using corn, fescue hay, distillers dried grains with solubles, and a mineral-vitamin supplement. A subcutaneous fat biopsy was taken in the rump area on 0 d. Fat biopsy consisted of 1 × 1 cm size sample removed after area was shaved and scrubbed, followed by 5 mL of lidocaine used locally. Upon 3 min, a cut with a sterile scalpel was made to remove the subcutaneous fat tissue, bagged, then placed in dry ice and transported back to Ohio State University. Visual evaluation of fat color was conducted by using a 1 to 5 number scale published by the American Meat Science Association ranging as follows: 1, white; 2, creamy white; 3, slightly yellow; 4, moderately yellow; and 5, yellow. Upon day 56, cows were harvested; carcass data were collected 48 h postmortem. Yield and quality grade was evaluated at the 12th/13th rib interface using USDA grading standards. Additionally, subjective visual color score of carcasses was conducted using the same American Meat Science Association 1–5 fat color scale as on 0 d. Statistical analysis was conducted using a proc mixed procedure. The color of the fat from the 0-d biopsy was used as covariable for 56-d fat color. Differences between treatments showing significance was determined at P ≤ 0.05.\n\nResults: Carcass external fat, ribeye size, internal fat percent, and hot carcass weight did not differ (P > 0.10) among treatment groups. Similarly, quality traits including skeletal maturity, lean maturity, marbling, and overall quality grade were not significantly affected (P > 0.10) by treatment group. Subcutaneous adipose color scores did differ significantly (P < 0.01) by treatment. Cows on the LVA treatment exhibited lower color scores compared to HVA (2.19 vs. 2.59) (P = 0.0039).\n\nConclusion: Results indicate that feeding strategies with feed ingredients differing in concentration of vitamin A had no effect on carcass yield or quality traits in cull cows; however, the reduction of subjective subcutaneous fat color scores seen in the LVA treatment group lends merit to the feeding of an LVA diet to cull cows prior to slaughter in order to target a “white-cow” premium.\n\nKeywords: beef, quality traits, subcutaneous fat color, yield\n\n76 - QUALITY DIFFERENCES IN TRADITIONAL AND CLEAN-LABEL CHICKEN PATTIES FORMULATED WITH WOODY BREAST MEAT\n\nT. Jarvis1*, X. Zhang1, C. Rowe2, B. Smith3, C. Crist1, and M. W. Schiling1, 1Food Science, Nutrition & Health Promotion, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA, 2Research & Development, Perdue Foods Inc., Salisbury, MD, USA, 3Business Development, Hawkins Inc., Birmingham, AL, USA, *trj215@msstate.edu\n\nObjectives: The objective of this research was to evaluate quality differences between chicken patties composed of different percentages of normal (NOR) and severe (SEV) woody breast (WB) meat and formulated with a control (salt), traditional (salt, sodium phosphate), or clean-label (salt, potassium carbonate) marinade.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Chicken breasts were collected from broilers with an average live weight of 4.2–4.3 kg at a commercial poultry plant. Breasts collected were graded NOR and SEV and stored at 2°C–3°C for 6 d. On the processing day, NOR and SEV WB were ground through a 1.27 cm plate, then a 0.48 cm bone-extracting plate. Meat was combined into 18.1 kg batches. Each meat block was blended with control, traditional, or clean-label marinades. Each batch was vacuum blended at 25 mmHg, chilled with CO2 to −2.7°C, then formed into patties using a 11 3/4 × 10 4/5 × 25 cm3 plate (166 g). Ten raw patties were frozen to −62.2°C in a CO2 cabinet. The remaining patties were belt grilled at 257°C for 75 s, cooked for 12 min at 163°C, 82°C dew point, and 800 rpm fan speed, then individually frozen for 25 min at −62.2°C. Samples were stored at −23°C and evaluated within 3 mo of processing. A 3 × 4 factorial structure within a randomized complete block design with 3 replications (processing dates) was used to evaluate the impact of marinade (control, traditional, clean label) and % NOR (0% NOR, 33% NOR, 67% NOR, 100% NOR) on pH, cook yields, texture profile analysis attributes, and protein bind. A 2 (traditional vs. clean label) × 4 (% NOR) factorial structure within a randomized complete block design with 2 replications (processing dates) was used to determine the impact of % NOR meat on descriptive sensory attributes (n = 10 trained panelists) and consumer acceptability (n = 105 for traditional and 113 consumers for clean label) of chicken patties within each marinade treatments (traditional and clean label). Means were separated using Fisher’s protected least significant difference test. Orthogonal contrasts were also conducted to determine whether there were linear or quadratic effects (P < 0.05).\n\nResults: The 100% NOR patties had greater cook yields than 33% and 0% NOR patties (P < 0.05) and better protein bind than other treatments (P < 0.05). Traditional patties had greater cook yields and better protein bind than clean-label and control patties (P < 0.05). For texture profile analysis, 100% NOR patties were harder, gummier, chewier, and springier than 33% and 0% NOR patties (P < 0.05). For descriptive analysis, 100% NOR patties were chewier and more cohesive than 0% NOR patties (P < 0.05), and traditional patties were springier, gummier, chewier, juicier, more cohesive, uniform, and fracturable than clean-label patties (P < 0.05). Consumers rated all patties acceptable for appearance, aroma, texture, flavor, and overall acceptability (>6).\n\nConclusion: Protein functionality was hindered when WB meat was included in chicken patties, which contributed to decreased cook yields. In addition, use of sodium phosphate in the traditional marinade maximized yields and protein bind in the 100% NOR treatment and was superior to the clean-label and control samples, but was less effective in formulations with WB meat. It appears that all WB formulations could be used without a major impact on acceptability, but yields and protein bind decreased as WB amount increased in the formulation and when potassium carbonate was used in place of sodium phosphate.\n\nKeywords: chicken breast, marination, myopathy, water-holding capacity\n\n77 - MUSCLE WATER PROPERTIES BY TIME-DOMAIN NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN RAW INTACT BROILER PECTORALIS MAJOR WITH THE WOODY BREAST CONDITION\n\nH. Zhuang1*, B. Pang2, and B. C. Bowker1, 1US National Poultry Research Center, USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Athens, GA, USA, 2Food Science and Engineering, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, China, *hong.zhuang@usda.gov\n\nObjectives: In addition to having unique tactile properties in the raw state, woody breast (WB) fillets (pectoralis major) also exhibit altered muscle water characteristics, with increased moisture content and decreased water-holding capacity (WHC) compared to normal fillets. Time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR) is a rapid analytical methodology that provides information about muscle water properties, such as mobility, compartmentalization, and relative content. Previous studies have shown a relationship between water properties measured with TD-NMR and the WB condition. However, these studies utilized only small subsamples of the pectoralis major and did not analyze the relationships between the water properties and WHC. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of WB on muscle water properties determined by TD-NMR and their relationship with WHC in raw intact broiler breast fillets.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Pectoralis major muscles (n = 144) from 8-wk-old broilers deboned at 3 h postmortem were collected from a commercial plant and categorized as normal, moderate WB, or severe WB based on fillet hardness and rigidity. For WHC, fillet purge loss was determined based on weight differences before and after overnight storage at 4°C. Muscle water properties were determined by TD-NMR based on the following measurements: relaxation parameters mobility (time constant of peak, T), distribution (area of peak relative to other peaks, P), and relative abundance (peak area per 100 g meat, A); values were transformed using an inverse Laplace algorithm.\n\nResults: There were 3 water components identified in raw broiler breast meat: hydration water (T-HW), intra-myofibrillar water (T-INTRA), and extra-myofibrillar water (T-EXTRA). As WB scores increased (from normal to severe), time constant T-HW increased (P < 0.05) from 0.39 to 0.44 ms, T-INTRA from 49 to 57 ms, and T-EXTRA from 205 to 235 ms. There was also an increase in the proportion of extra-myofibrillar water (P-EXTRA) from 18% to 39% (P < 0.05) and increases in the relative abundance of intra-myofibrillar water (A-INTRA) from 385 to 404 unit/100 g meat and extra-myofibrillar water (A-EXTRA) from 88 to 273 unit/100 g. However, P-HW decreased from 0.79% to 0.35%, P-INTRA from 81% to 60%, and A-HW from 3.65 to 2.25 unit/100 g. In addition, the WB condition resulted in increased (P < 0.05) purge loss from 1.14% to 1.84%. Correlation analysis revealed that the strongest overall correlation (r = 0.64) was between A-EXTRA and purge loss. There was no correlation (P > 0.05) between A-INTRA and purge loss. Within normal fillets, purge loss correlated to T-HW, T-INTRA, A-INTRA, and A-EXTRA (r ≥ 0.38, P < 0.001). Within the severe WB group, only the A-EXTRA correlated to purge loss (r = 0.5; P < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: The WB condition has a significant impact on water mobility, compartmentalization, and abundance within raw breast fillets. The WB condition results in increases in water mobility, P-EXTRA, A-INTRA, and A-EXTRA but decreases in P-HW and P-INTRA. In normal broiler pectoralis major, T-HW, T-EXTRA, A-INTRA, and A-EXTRA are involved in meat purge loss. However, A-EXTRA may be a key factor responsible for the poor WHC in WB meat.\n\nKeywords: extra-myofibrillar water, intra-myofibrillar water, meat water-holding capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance, wooden breast myopathy\n\n78 - PINUS TAEDA POLYPHENOLS ADDITION IN BEEF FEEDING: EFFECTS ON VOLATILE COMPOUNDS AND ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME ACTIVITY\n\nA. Maggiolino1*, E. Casalino1, M. Faccia2, J. M. Lorenzo Rodriguez3, and P. De Palo1, 1Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Valenzano, 2Department of Soil, Plant and Food Sciences, University of Bari, Bari, Italy, 3Centro Tecnológico de la Carne de Galicia, Parque Tecnológico de Galicia, Oruense, Spain, *aristide.maggiolino@uniba.it\n\nObjectives: Natural antioxidants obtained from leaves, seeds, or flowers of plants, containing bioactive substances such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and volatile oils, have been used in animal feeding. Consumers perceive this strategy positively, as these compounds have an effectiveness also in human health, they are natural, and usually they are from agricultural byproducts, in a context of increasing circularity of the economic activities. The aim of the work was to evaluate the effects of Pinus taeda Hydrolyzed Lignin (PTHL) polyphenols’ inclusion on the volatile organic compounds (VOC) profile and antioxidant enzyme activity of beef meat stored at 4°C for 15 d of aging.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Forty Limousin bulls (340 ± 42 kg) were fed ad libitum on a total mixed ration (TMR) for 120 d. The control group received exclusively TMR, while the experimental group received the same TMR as the control group but supplemented with PTHL polyphenols (Oxifenol, I-Green, Padua, Italy; 35 g/d per head at 1–90 d and 70 g/d per head at 91–120 d). Samples of longissimus thoracis muscle (mean weight of 2,000 ± 100 g) were removed from the right carcass side between the 11th and 13th thoracic vertebra from each animal and placed in a dry aging meat chamber (2°C, 82% of humidity) until analyses. Steaks of 2.5 cm of thickness were obtained from the sample at 2 different storage times (1 and 15 d) and analyzed. At each aging time, samples were grill cooked at 130–150°C for 5 min, and VOC profile was performed by solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Moreover, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase meat activity were detected on raw samples at both aging times and in both experimental groups. VOC profile and enzyme activity were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the spectrophotometric method, respectively, and the results obtained were analyzed using a nested analysis of variance using the general linear models procedure by SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), where aging time and PTHL polyphenols’ inclusion were set as independent variables. Means were compared using the Tukey test for repeated measures.\n\nResults: Ketones and aldehydes were the most common VOC from cooking meat, representing around 60% of the total VOC. The ketones showed to be produced less in meat from the polyphenols group at 15 aging days (P < 0.01); however, they increased in both groups during aging (P < 0.01). They usually derived from lipid oxidation, in particular from fatty acid oxidation, and showed how these processes are probably characterized by lower intensity if animals are fed with added polyphenols. Also aldehydes, derived from lipid oxidation although through different pathways than ketones, did not show any difference between groups (P > 0.05). However, they increased after aging (P < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity did not change during aging, with no differences between groups (P > 0.05); instead, glutathione peroxidase activity showed different trends between experimental groups, increasing during aging time in PTHL group (P < 0.01) and decreasing in the control group (P < 0.05), with higher activity in meat from animals fed with polyphenol additives at 15 aging days (P < 0.01).\n\nConclusion: Some changes are present in beef meat after grilling cooking, and these changes involved primarily those indicative of lipid oxidation, with less production in animals fed with PTHL polyphenols.\n\nKeywords: aging time, antioxidants, enzymes, volatile organic compounds\n\n79 - IMPACT OF PRODUCTION CLAIMS AND COLOR SCORING UNDER CONTROLLED LIGHTING ON PORK QUALITY TRAITS\n\nK.

Auditors purchased up to 10 retail packages of center loin pork chops per retail brand, per retailer. A mobile quality laboratory was set up in each city. All chops were weighed individually to calculate retail purge as compared with retail sale weight. Chops were individually evaluated for National Pork Board (NPB) color and marbling scores under controlled lighting prior to being vacuum sealed and frozen and shipped to University of Florida. Chops were weighed frozen, thawed at 4°C, then weighed prior to and after cooking on grills to an internal temperature of 65°C; they were then evaluated for tenderness using slice shear force protocol and recorded as KG of force. Total weight loss was calculated by summing retail, thaw, and cooking loss.\n\nWith claim\n\n(n = 385) Without claim\n\n(n = 904) P value Light\n\n(n = 850) Dark\n\n(n = 435) P value Retail Purge, % 4.2 ± 0.3 5.1 ± 0.2 0.003 5.1 ± 0.2 4.5 ± 0.3 0.04 Thaw Loss, % 3.2 ± 0.2 2.6 ± 0.1 < 0.001 2.8 ± 0.1 2.7 ± 0.1 0.48 Cook Loss, % 18.0 ± 0.6 18.2 ± 0.4 0.73 18.5 ± 0.4 17.4 ± 0.5 0.02 Total Weight Loss, % 26.1 ± 0.9 26.8 ± 0.5 0.44 27.3 ± 0.5 24.8 ± 0.7 <0.001 Slice Shear Force, Kg 15.8 ± 0.4 16.1 ± 0.3 0.52 16.3 ± 0.3 15.6 ± 0.4 0.07\n\nResults: Seventy percent of purchased chops (n = 904) contained no production claim on the label, which represented 427 different retail packages. The top 3 label claims were hormone or steroid free, antibiotic free, and vegetarian fed. The presence of a production claim did not affect (P ≥ 0.18) NPB color or marbling score under controlled lighting (data not shown in table). Center loin chops with production claims had less retail purge (P = 0.003) than chops without production claims. The opposite was found with thaw loss, where chops with production claims had a greater percentage (P < 0.001) than chops without production claims. Production claim did not affect cooking loss, total weight loss, or slice shear force (P ≥ 0.44). Chops determined to be light (NPB color score 1 or 2; n = 145 and 705, respectively) under controlled lighting had more retail purge, cooking loss, and total weight loss (P ≤ 0.04) than chops determined to be dark (NPB color score 3 or 4; n = 408 and 27, respectively). Additionally, dark colored chops tended (P = 0.07) to have lower slice shear force values than light colored chops.\n\nConclusion: Grouping pork loins by the presence of a production claim had less influence over total post-packaging weight loss and slice shear force than evaluating subjective NPB color scores under controlled lighting. Subjective evaluation of color under controlled lighting can distinguish differences in weight loss and potentially objective tenderness, when chops are purchased from multiple retailers.\n\nKeywords: color scoring, pork quality, production claim, retail benchmarking\n\n81 - EFFECTS OF FEEDING BREWERS GRAINS, MAIZE STARCH, AND OMEGA 3 FATTY ACIDS ON GROWTH PERFORMANCE, MEAT QUALITY ATTRIBUTES, AND BLOOD STRESS INDICATORS OF VEAL\n\nF. M. Giotto1*, E. L. Shebs1, A. M. Cavender1, D. E. Gerrard2, M. A. Fonseca1, and A. S. De Mello1, 1Agriculture, Veterinary, and Rangeland Sciences, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA, 2Animal and Poultry Sciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA, *amilton@cabnr.unr.edu\n\nObjectives: From to 2008 to 2018, the veal production in the United Sates decreased from 143 to 76 million pounds. Therefore, research focusing on developing and promoting veal production in the US is needed. In this study, we evaluated the effects of feeding starch and omega 3 oils on growth performance, blood stress indicators, pH, tenderness, sensory attributes, and fatty acid profile of veal as a feeding strategy to improve animal welfare and overall veal quality.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Twenty-three veal calves approximately 2 mo old and 94.67 ± 12.07 kg were randomly assigned to one of 3 dietary treatments (Control n = 7, Starch, n = 8, and Omega 3 n = 8 animals per treatment). Diets included the following: milk replacer, 200 g of brewers grain, and mineral supplement (Control); Control + maize starch (Starch); and Control + 3% of omega 3 (Omega 3). All animals were individually fed and offered ad libitum amounts of milk replacer. Diet composition changed among treatments mostly on ethereal extract and energy content. Calves were fed for 68 d, and blood samples were collected during exsanguination for creatinine and cortisol analysis. After slaughter, hot carcass weight was recorded as well as weight after 24 h (cold carcass weight). Values of pH were assessed using a Hanna® pH meter (Hanna Instruments, RI), and instrumental color (L*, a*, b*) was recorded by using a CR-400 Konica Minolta® (Konica Minolta Sensing Inc., Osaka, Japan) color reader. Approximately 24 h postmortem, the M. longissimus dorsi et lumborum was excised from the loins and aged for 14 d. Steaks (2.5 cm) were fabricated and evaluated for proximate composition, fatty acid profile, Warner-Bratzler shear force, and sensory attributes. Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). When significance was detected at P ≤ 0.05, means were separated using LSMEANS.\n\nResults: Dietary treatments did not affect hot carcass weight, cold carcass weight, pH, moisture, color, Warner-Bratzler shear force, sensory attributes, and creatinine. Veal from calves fed Control and Omega 3 diets were significantly fatter than veal from calves fed Starch. Calves fed Starch and Omega 3 had lower levels of blood cortisol compared to calves fed Control. Veal from calves fed Control had the highest concentrations of C20:2n6, C22:4n6, and C20:3n3, whereas feeding Starch increased C18:2n6 and C20:4n6 compared to Omega 3 and increased C22:5n3 compared to control. Veal fed Starch also showed higher total omega 6 when compared to veal fed Omega 3. Feeding Omega 3 increased the deposition of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n3) fatty acids.\n\nConclusion: Supplementing veal calves with maize starch and omega 3 oils does not affect growth performance and veal quality attributes. Animals fed supplemented diets had lower blood cortisol levels. Feeding milk replacer with brewers grains with or without maize starch increased omega 6 fatty acid deposition in the lean, whereas feeding Omega 3 favored deposition of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Feeding management is a viable strategy to decrease blood cortisol and manipulate nutritional values of veal.\n\nKeywords: omega 3, quality, stress, veal\n\n82 - EFFECT OF FAT LEVEL ON PREMATURE BROWNING OF MARBLING BEEF\n\nW. Liu1, X. Luo1, Y. Zhang1, Y. Mao1, P. Dong1, X. Yang1, and R. Liang1*, 1Food Science and Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China, *lrr327@126.com\n\nObjectives: The problem of premature browning (PMB) leads to consumers’ wrong judgment on the endpoint of cooking and can cause food safety problems. Highly marbled beef has more intramuscular fat, and the lipid oxidation is more severe during storage and cooking. Lipid oxidation will probably cause more PMB in cooked meat. However, very little of the literature can be found that focuses on the impact of lipid level on PMB in cooked beef. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of lipid level on PMB in marbled beef.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Longissimus lumborum muscles with 2 different Japanese marbling levels, A1 (Fat % = 8.08 ± 1.15) and A3 (Fat % = 15.81 ± 2.28), were collected from Angus × Black Waygu crossed cattle (28 mo) in an abattoir. The cattle were fed with the same fodder using the same farming practices. Six Longissimus lumborum muscles were collected for each marbling level from 6 different cattle after grading, and 12 Longissimus lumborum were obtained in total. Then, the muscles were vacuum packaged and transported to the laboratory within 2 h in boxes on ice. Muscles were divided into steaks of 2.54 cm, and all were packaged under high-oxygen packaging (80% O2 + 20% CO2) and stored in a dark environment of 0°C–4°C for 0 d, 5 d, and 10 d. Four steaks from each cattle were prepared for each sampling day, and thus 72 steaks from 6 cattle were used in each treatment. On each day, the steaks were cooked to a central temperature of 55°C, 66°C, and 72°C, respectively, and the center cooked color was recorded immediately using an X-Rite spectrometer (SP62, 8 mm diameter aperture, Illuminant A, 10° observer, Grand Rapids, MI).\n\nGrade Center temperature (°C) Storage time (day) SE 0 5 10 A1 55 14.65aAX 14.31aAX 11.26bAX 0.2007 66 13.68aAX 7.31bAY 7.04bAY 72 10.54aAY 6.85bAZ 6.57bAY A3 55 13.29aBX 11.02bBX 9.15cBX 0.4439 66 10.99aBY 6.51bAY 6.52bBY 72 8.56aBZ 6.59bAY 6.38bAY\n\nResults: There was a significant interaction of fat level, storage time, and center temperature on the cooked color of a* values (P < 0.05, Table 1). As the central temperature increased, the central a* values of both fat levels decreased significantly. And with the extension of storage time, the a* values decreased as well. Significant differences were observed between 2 fat levels. On day 0, the a* values were much lower in high fat level compared to the lower fat level. This indicated that steaks with a high fat level had more PMB problem even on day 0 of storage. When stored to day 5 and day 10, PMB was observed in steaks from both marbling levels, but it was more obvious in A3 steaks. The fat level showed no significant impact on L* values and b* values (P < 0.05, data not shown).\n\nConclusion: Fat levels impacted PMB in high-oxygen packaging.\n\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by the fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31871731), China Agriculture Research System-beef (CARS-37), and Key R. and D.

Wang1, R. Liang1, Y. Zhang1, X. Luo1, and Y. Mao1*, 1College of Food Science and Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China, *maoyanwei@163.com\n\nObjectives: Beef rolls are popular among Chinese consumers, which makes them a widely used ingredient in hot pot meals. Beef rolls are usually stored and transported in a frozen state, during which the color deteriorates quickly due to freezing. Therefore, a number of storage methods and package methods for frozen beef rolls aiming to extend color shelf life were investigated.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Samples were obtained from the Longissimus lumborum muscle of 6 Chinese Luxi yellow cattle. The Longissimus lumborum were removed from carcasses at 48 h postmortem, and then frozen and cut into thin slices of 0.1 cm and rolled into solid beef rolls with a diameter of about 2 cm. The slices were assigned randomly to 10 package × temperature groups (50% O2: 50% O2 + 30% CO2 + 20% N2; 60% O2: 60% O2 + 40% N2; 80% O2: 80% O2 + 20% CO2; CO: 0.4% CO + 30% CO2 + 69.6% N2 and overwrap packaging, stored at −12°C or −18°C). The surface color of beef rolls was determined by using an X-Rite spectrophotometer (Model SP62, 4 mm diameter aperture, Illuminant D65, 10° observer, X-Rite, USA). The first measurement was carried out after blooming for 30 min at day 0, and the other measurements were taken immediately in frozen state after opening packages at days 30, 90, 120, and 180.\n\nPackaging methods Storage temperature (°C) Storage times (d) 50%O2 60%O2 80%O2 CO OP -12 0 22.27±0.38akx 22.27±0.38akx 22.27±0.38akx 22.27±0.38akx 22.27±0.38akx 30 19.89±1.02akx 20.05±0.74aklx 15.67±0.98bly 17.81±1.53ablx 18.73±1.38ablx 90 15.82±1.94bclx 17.98±1.52ablmx 9.96±1.42dmy 20.88±2.60aklx 14.67±1.84cmx 120 11.81±2.04bcmy 14.84±1.44bmx 9.07±1.97cmy 23.05±2.20akx 11.28±1.40cny 180 11.14±2.07cmy 15.05±1.86bmx 10.87±2.16cmy 20.39±2.39aklx 12.49±1.76bcmnx -18 0 22.27±0.38akx 22.27±0.38akx 22.27±0.38akx 22.27±0.38akx 22.27±0.38akx 30 20.29±0.99aklx 21.36±0.74akx 21.18±0.96aklx 16.83±1.53blx 20.15±1.76aklx 90 18.33±1.10almx 19.39±0.86aklx 18.11±0.84almx 17.64±2.29alx 16.70±0.90almx 120 15.39±1.32amx 16.90±0.96alx 15.55±1.76amx 17.04±1.57aly 15.83±1.49amx 180 15.75±0.43amx 17.19±0.61alx 16.90±0.49amx 18.01±1.23alx 15.50±0.87amx\n\nResults: Combined with the results in Table 1 and the consideration of economic factors, the following conclusions are drawn. When stored at −12°C and the storage period is within 30 d, it is recommended to use overwrap packaging, and when the storage period needs to reach 30–90 d, 60% O2 modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is recommended, for CO MAP is forbidden in China. When stored at −18°C and the storage period is within 90 d, overwrap packaging is recommended, and when the storage period needs to reach 90–180 d, 60% O2 MAP is recommended.\n\nConclusion: This study established a number of storage methods suitable for different conditions of frozen beef rolls in terms of color stability.\n\nKeywords: color, frozen beef rolls, modified atmosphere packaging, shelf life\n\n84 - ANALYSIS OF FOAL MEAT SHELF LIFE UNDER VACUUM AND MAP PACKAGING CONDITIONS\n\nD. Franco1*, R. Bermúdez1, P. E. S. Munekata1, L. Cutillas-Barreiro1, L. Purriños1, and J. M. Lorenzo1, 1Food Science and Technology, Centro Tecnológico de la Carne de Galicia, Ourense, Spain, *danielfranco@ceteca.net\n\nObjectives: Horsemeat is characterized by low fat and cholesterol content, higher amounts of iron and vitamins of B group, as well as a favorable dietetic fatty acid profile and balanced protein profile. For this reason, horsemeat could be an alternative to conventional red meat, and it could play an important role. One of the main concerns of the meat industry is preserving food to extend its shelf life while ensuring its safety and quality. The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the effect of packaging under vacuum or modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) during 21 d at 4°C on main quality attributes (color, microbial spoilage, lipid oxidation, and odor) of fresh foal meat.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Five foals of Galician breed reared in an extensive system were slaughtered at 15 mo of age. Steaks of longissimus dorsi were stored in polystyrene tray and packaged with a gas mixture of 80% O2/20% CO2 (MAP group) and under vacuum conditions (VAC group) at 4°C. Instrumental colorimeter parameters (luminosity [L*], redness index [a*], and percentage of metmyoglobin), microbial spoilage (counts of CFU mesophiles and enterobacteria), and lipid oxidation expressed as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values were measured at 0, 7, 14 and 21 d of storage. Additionally, an acceptance test with 12 trained panelists for discoloration and odor was carried out using a 5-point hedonic scale (1 = excellent and 5 = not acceptable). An analysis of variance was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 program (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and considering storage time and type of packaging as fixed effects. The least-squares means were separated using Duncan’s post hoc test for a significance level P < 0.05.\n\nResults: Regarding instrumental color, there were significant differences between VAC and MAP packaging after 14 d of storage. Long-term storage strongly affected metmyoglobin and redness index of MAP samples which increased (159%) and decreased (259%) from 0 to 21 d. Concerning lipid oxidation, foal steaks from the VAC group did not show significant (P > 0.05) changes during storage time, displaying values below 2 mg malondialdehyde/kg meat considered for several authors as rancidity threshold. On the contrary, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of the MAP group increased significantly (P < 0.001) from 0.12 to 10.56 mg malondialdehyde/kg meat during storage time. With respect to microbial spoilage, there was no significant (P > 0.05) difference between the 2 types of packaging (VAC vs. MAP). As expected, the number of counts significantly raised as storage time increased in all cases. This increment was slower for enterobacteria than for mesophilic microorganisms, reaching average final values of 3.6 and 6.6 log CFU/g at 21 d storage, respectively. Finally, sensory attributes of the acceptance test (discoloration at surface and odor) for the VAC group obtained scores within the acceptability range (<3); meanwhile, MAP samples exceed this score for discoloration at surface and odor at seventh day of storage.\n\nConclusion: From the findings of this preliminary study, we can conclude that VAC is preferable to MAP packaging maintaining the color, avoiding the discoloration at the surface, and improving the odor acceptance and lipid rancidity.\n\nAcknowledgments: This research received funding by INIA-Spain RTA2017-00081-C04-00.

Meinert1*, A. G. Koch1, and T. Jacobsen1, 1Food Safety, Danish Meat Research Institute, Taastrup, Denmark, *lme@dti.dk\n\nObjectives: The aim was to develop mathematical models that describe the microbial development and sensory shelf life of cooked pork products. The hypothesis is that it is possible to estimate shelf life, when you know the number of bacteria in the cold cuts at the time of packaging combined with storage temperature and preservations used.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The dataset used to develop the models consists of 37 individual trial series in which approximately 2,000 packages of cold cuts were analyzed for psychrotrophic colony forming units and lactic acid bacteria. Furthermore, approximately 10,000 sensory assessments were made of the appearance, smell, and taste of the cold cuts by 5 expert assessors. The sensory assessment was based on scores from 1–4 (1–2 acceptable; 3–4 unacceptable)\n\nThe growth models: As primary model a logistic function of the form (see below in the Image section) was applied. Here, I0 is the aerobic initial counts in the used meat, and t is the storage time in days. The variable φ constitutes the secondary model depending on water phase salt content, temperature, and whether nitrite and lactate were added.\n\nThe sensory models: The time dependency of all sensory profiles is all linear or slightly logistic. These profiles were modeled using a small neural network with 6 input neurons, 2 hidden neurons with logistic response functions, and a single output neuron. The 6 inputs were, nitrite (Y/N), lactate (Y/N), water phase salt, temperature, I0, and storage time. This neural network model incorporates both primary and secondary models.\n\nResults: The results in Figure 1 show an example of a dataset used in the model. It can be seen from Figure 1 that, after 28 d of storage at 8°C, some samples were assessed as unacceptable (above 2). At this time, the number of bacteria was between 7 and 8 log CFU/g. The psychrotrophic colony forming units reached a maximum after approximately 30 d. At that time, the sensory assessments were above an average score of 2, which means that most of the assessors assessed the product as sensory unacceptable.\n\nlog(cfu(t))=8/(1+(8log(I0)−1)e−t/ϕ\n\nConclusion: The data showed variations in the number of bacteria in the cold cuts packages, both between different products and within the same product, as expected. These variations are a part of the real life situation for meat producers when they determine end dates of their products. But even so, it is possible to predict shelf life of cooked meat products with the use of the mathematical models, which will be of great help for the quality managers in companies producing cooked meat products.\n\nFind the shelf life model (and other predictive models) at DMRIPredict.dk.

Font I Furnols* Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, *maria.font@irta.cat\n\nObjectives: Firmness or softness of bellies is an important quality characteristic because it is related to fat quality, processing difficulties, and visual appearance. It depends on intrinsic and extrinsic production factors. Non-castration versus castration can affect fat content and composition and, consequently, firmness. There are few studies in which the effect of immunocastration over the quality of the bellies is studied, and it is worthwhile to study this effect when comparing to bellies from intact male pigs. The aim of the present work was to determine the effect of the non-castration versus the immunocastration of pigs on the morphological, compositional, and mechanical (firmness) characteristics of bellies.\n\nMaterials and Methods: A total of 17 bellies were used from intact male (EM) and 13 from immunocastrated (IM) pigs fed the same diet. Bellies were cut using as a reference anatomical points of the carcass and weighted. Length and width were measured in the central part. Fat content was measured with dual X-ray equipment. Firmness was determined by means of the flop distance and angle measured skin-side up and skin-side down using the bar-suspension method. The height of each belly was measured skin-side up in the center of the dorsal side. Then the skin was stretched with tweezers until the base of the belly gets up and the height was measured. The difference between these 2 heights is calculated as a measure of firmness in terms of fat separation. Subjective firmness was also measured by 2 trained technicians, applying pressure with a finger, using a 5-point scale from 1 (very firm) to 5 (very soft). Analysis of variance was performed with SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) including the castration condition (non-castrated and immunocastrated) as fixed effect.\n\nResults: No significant differences in bellies’ weight, width, and thickness were found between IM and EM. The length was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in IM than EM bellies. As expected, fatness was higher in IM than EM since IM pigs behave as surgically castrated after the second dose of the immunocastration vaccine. Flop distance and angle, both skin-side up and skin-side down, were significantly higher in bellies from IM than those from EM, indicating that IM bellies were firmer. This was also confirmed with significantly lower measure of fat separation and subjective firmness value in the center of the cranial side of the bellies.\n\nIntact males Immunocastrated RMSE P-value n 17 13 Weight (kg) 44 4.7 0.56 0.204 Width (cm) 24.0 23.6 1.34 0494 Length (cm) 42.1 45.9 2.57 0.001 Thickness1 (cm) 3.9 3.7 0.57 0.322 Fat (%) 29.3 33.9 4.29 0.008 Flop distance (cm) Skin-side up 13.9 18.8 4.88 0.010 Skin-side down 16.2 22.5 6.28 0.011 Flop angle (°) Skin-side up 38.5 48.3 12.32 0.040 Skin-side down 45.6 59.8 18.25 0.044 Firmness2 Fat separation (cm) 2.0 1.5 0.45 0.013 Pressure3 4.3 3.6 0.57 0.005\n\nConclusion: Firmness of the bellies is affected by the castration condition of the animals. In this sense, bellies from IM pigs are firmer and fattier than those from EM pigs. More work is needed to determine the effect of immunocastration on fat composition.\n\nKeywords: fat content, firmness, flop angle, flop distance\n\n88 - POTENTIAL OF 2D QUANTITATIVE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (2D qNMR) SPECTROSCOPY ANALYSIS FOR CHICKEN BREAST MEAT METABOLITES\n\nH. C. Kim1*, Y.-J. Ko2, K. H. Baek1, and C. Jo1,3, 1Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Center for Food and Bioconvergence, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 2National Center for Inter-University Research Facilities, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 3Institute of Green Bio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang, Republic Of Korea, *eoenhc@naver.com\n\nObjectives: Acquiring accurate metabolic information is important to understand and/or elucidate biological changes in meat samples. Among the different quantitative analyses, one-dimensional (1D) 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis is rapid, reproducible, and simultaneous for various metabolites without derivatization. However, despite these advantages, 1D 1H NMR analyses still need to overcome the problem of chronic overlap, which is critical in cases of mixtures such as meat extracts. For this problem, the application of two-dimensional quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (2D qNMR) can be helpful to reduce overlap issues via its dimensional expansion. Hence, in this study, 2D qNMR analytical methods were applied for metabolite analysis in meat, investigating its potential in comparison to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 1D 1H NMR.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Chicken breasts meat were purchased from a local market and pooled prior to the analyses. The breast meat (5 g) was extracted with 0.6 M perchloric acid, neutralized with potassium hydroxide, and lyophilized for elimination of the water. Lyophilized samples were reconstituted with 1 mL of 20 mM phosphate buffer in D2O solution (1 mM 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid, pH 7.0) and applied for 1D 1H NMR, 2D qNMR (heteronuclear single nuclear quantum coherence [HSQC]), and HPLC. Prior to setting up 2D qNMR, artificial free amino acid mixture was prepared manually and acquired on HSQC for quantification. All results were triplicated, and statistical analysis was performed using the procedure of the general linear model. Significance of differences among mean values was determined by a Student-Newman-Keul test (P < 0.05).\n\nResults: A total of 18 free amino acids were found in chicken breast meat extracts using 3 different analyses (Table 1). Compared to HPLC and HSQC, 1D 1H NMR showed good precision with lower variation. However, some metabolites (arginine, glutamate, proline, histidine, lysine, serine, and tryptophan) were quantified in 1D 1H NMR because of its overlap. Unlike 1D 1H NMR, HSQC could qualify and quantify all metabolites without overlap. Different quantification in 2D qNMR was observed in the contents of arginine, proline, glutamine, histidine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and valine, while other free amino acids were not different when compared to the conventional HPLC method (P < 0.05). This inconsistency can be improved by further optimization as it is possibly due to difference of ionic strength between breast meat extracts and artificial standard mixture, different 90° pulse (p1) of metabolites, and/or NMR acquisition parameters. In addition, although quantification of was not consistent on HSQC, standard of each free amino acid showed good linearity (R2 = 0.97 in proline and R2 > 0.99 in others).\n\nConclusion: Based on the results, 2D qNMR can be helpful in acquiring interactive and accurate information, which could be advantageous when compared to traditional chromatographic analysis. However, further optimization is needed for more accurate numerical quantification.\n\nKeywords: one-dimensional quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance, two-dimensional quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance, chicken breast, high-performance liquid chromatography, heteronuclear single nuclear quantum coherence\n\n89 - SOW CLASSIFICATION BASED ON WEIGHT AND PARITY AFFECTS PORK QUALITY\n\nJ. J. Nehls1*, K. E. Hwang1, and J. R. Claus1, 1Animal Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA, *jrclaus@wisc.edu\n\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of sow classification used by the industry based on a combination of slaughter weight and parity on various meat quality attributes.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Six sows representing 2 commercial classification groups (low weight [LW] = 155–165 kg; high weight [HW] = 278–308 kg) were harvested. The weight classes were further controlled by age and parity (LW average age = 1 y, average parity = 1; HW average age = 3.8 y, average parity = 8). Sows were electrically stunned, bled, skinned, eviscerated, cut into anatomical lateral sides, and fabricated (~45 min postmortem). One side was sampled for water-holding capacity (WHC) and pH. The other side was hot-boned, and the meat was ground through a 3/4” plate. The ground meat was mixed with salt (1.5% meat weight basis) and dry ice (28% meat weight basis) and stored (3 d) before being re-ground (5/32” plate). Ground samples were homogenized and then analyzed for moisture, fat, and protein. Additional samples (~150 g) were placed on Styrofoam trays, overwrapped with polyvinyl chloride, and continuously displayed (1,615 lux, 3°C). Color measurements were taken on 1, 4, and 7 d (CIE L*a*b*; reflectance: chemical states of myoglobin). Oxygen consumption (OC) and metmyoglobin reductase activity (MRA) were calculated using a reflectance method. Ability of the meat to hold water was measured using a centrifugal method (expressible moisture [EM]%) on ground meat and Carver Press (WHC %) on Longissimus lumborum (LL) and Semimembranosus (SM) muscle samples. Ground meat samples premixed with 40% water added (meat weight basis) prior to being centrifuged (15,000 G, 5 min, 4°C) were used to determine EM%. Patties (~125 g each) were prepared and cooked in an oven until 160°F, cooled (30 min), and weighed for cook loss. Animal served as the experimental unit. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED procedures (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and significance was set at P < 0.05.\n\nResults: Ground meat from LW compared to HW had more moisture (68.59% vs. 66.42%, P < 0.05), less fat (8.14% vs. 10.57%, P < 0.05), and slightly lower protein (20.83% vs. 21.19%, P < 0.05). During lighted display, the HW ground meat had lower L* values, higher a* values, and greater oxymyoglobin (P < 0.05) than LW. Also, the L* and a* values decreased while the metmyoglobin estimate increased with increasing display time (P < 0.05). The calculated OC was higher (P < 0.05) in the HW ground meat compared to LW, but no differences were found in MRA. WHC % was greater (P < 0.05) in HW than LW for both the SM and LL. In contrast EM% was not affected (P > 0.05) by weight class. The pH of HW (5.74) was higher than LW (5.55). In addition, the pH of the SM (5.77) was higher (P < 0.05) than in the LL (5.52). The cook loss percentage was almost identical for the HW and LW patties, and the HW cooked patties were noticeably darker in color.\n\nConclusion: Sow classification, based on weight relative to age and parity, had a significant effect on moisture content, fat content, OC, WHC percentage and meat color during lighted display. However, sow classification did not have an influence on the protein content, MRA, EM%, pH, and cook loss. Time in lighted display had a significant effect on meat color. The results serve as valuable information for pork harvest facilities making decisions on which sow classification provides the most positive impact on meeting consumer quality expectations.\n\nKeywords: meat quality, parity, pre-rigor, slaughter weight, sows\n\n90 - EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTATION WITH MANGANESE AND CHONDROITIN SULPHATE ON CARCASS TRAITS AND BROILER MEAT QUALITY\n\nJ. A. Muñoz1*, T. S. Martins2, T. A. J. Sant’Ana2, P. L. M. Garbossa2, L. F. Mueller1, A. M. Ferrinho1, G. V. de Moura1, I. H. S. Fuzikawa1, J. L. Gemelli1, T. R. Amorim1, H. C. Rocha2, L. B. Ferreira1, C. B. Barbalho1, M. M. da Silva1, M. D. Poleti1, and A. S. C. Pereira2, 1Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, 2Department of Animal Nutrition and Production, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of São Paulo, Pirassununa, Brazil, *julianmunoz@usp.br\n\nObjectives: The goal of this study was to verify whether different levels of chondroitin sulphate (CS) and manganese (Mn) could influence the presence of myopathy, macroscopic measurements of breast, carcass traits, and quality of broiler breast meat.\n\nMaterials and Methods: A total of 1,152 male Cobb chicks were housed during 47 d and distributed in a completely randomized design, in a 4 × 3 factorial arrangement: 4 doses of CS (0.00%, 0.06%, 0.12%, and 0.18%) and 3 doses of Mn (0, 40, and 80 mg/kg), totaling 12 treatments of 8 repetitions with 12 birds each. In the slaughter process, one breast was collected per experimental unit to verify the presence of white striping myopathy and to perform macroscopic analysis (area, width, and length). After 24 h of chilling, the carcasses were weighed to calculate the yield. During boning, the breasts, thighs, drumsticks, and wings were weighed to calculate the yield of the cuts. Then, 3 breasts per experimental unit were collected to determine the meat quality by analyzing pH, color (CIELAB system: L*, a*, and b*), cooking loss, and shear force. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and the means compared by the Tukey test at 5% probability.\n\nResults: It was observed that CS and Mn supplementation levels did not influence (P > 0.05) carcass yields, macroscopic breast characteristics, nor the cooking loss, shear force, and luminosity (L*) of broiler breasts. However, there was an effect (P < 0.05) on breast yield, with the highest percentages presented by the birds supplemented with 0.18% CS compared to the breasts of the diet without CS inclusion. There was interaction (P < 0.05) for thighs-drumsticks and wings yield, in which the highest yields for thighs and drumsticks were presented by diets without the inclusion of additives (CS and Mn) and it was evident that the different relationships between CS and Mn levels did not provide increases in thigh and drumstick yields. For the wings, the diet of greatest prominence was that formulated from 0.18% of CS and 80 mg/kg of Mn, since it presented the highest yields of wings. There was an effect (P < 0.05) of the CS levels in a* values, where the highest levels of red were present in the breasts from 0.18% CS diet compared to those of the diet without added CS. The pH and b* values were influenced by Mn levels (P < 0.05). The breasts from 0 mg/kg Mn diet had a higher b* than the breasts of chickens that consumed the diet with 80 mg/kg Mn. The 40 mg/kg Mn diet reached the highest pH values concerning the other Mn inclusion levels. Regarding the presence of myopathies, it was found that, regardless of CS or Mn levels, the breasts showed moderate white striping myopathy. However, it is noteworthy that the control diet without the inclusion of CS and Mn provided the breasts with the largest striation sizes (0.78 mm) when compared to the striations of the breasts of the diets of 0.18% CS and 80 mg/kg Mn (0.64 mm) and the diet of 40 mg/kg Mn (0.64"
