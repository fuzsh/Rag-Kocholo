        "text": "A Canadian man is at his wit's end due to a nefarious individual who has repeatedly ordered pizzas to his home and workplace for the last six months. The weird case reportedly began back in November when Justin Rybicki's dinner at his home in the community of Stony Plain, Alberta was interrupted by a delivery driver from the Canadian restaurant chain Pizza 73. Since he had not ordered anything that evening, he initially assumed the visit was some kind of mistake, but an email confirming the transaction soon led to the suspicion that he was the victim of identify theft. The following day, the situation became even stranger when Pizza 73 contacted him about a sizeable order set to be delivered to his job.\n\nMore on this very strange story at the Coast to Coast AM website."
