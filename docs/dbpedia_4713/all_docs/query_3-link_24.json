        "text": "EDMONTON, ALBERTA--(Marketwire - Oct 17, 2012) - The one in 133 Canadians who are affected by an allergic intolerance to wheat or gluten will now find it a little easier to enjoy quick-serve pizza in Western Canada. Pizza 73, a leading pizza chain in the region, has introduced a gluten-free offering that features four new pizzas at its 72 locations in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.\n\nAvailable in a 10\" crust, the line of gluten-free pizzas are made using a rice-based flour as the main ingredient and were launched in response to the dietary needs and trends expressed by its customers. Customers can choose from four types of pizzas: Cheese, Pepperoni, Hawaiian (ham and pineapple) and Veggie (fresh mushrooms, green peppers, red onions and Roma tomatoes), priced at $9.99 or $10.99 each.\n\n\"We''re dedicated to offering a diverse menu selection to all customer groups,\" said Pat Finelli, chief marketing officer for Pizza 73/Pizza Pizza. \"That includes people with celiac disease or related intolerance. A significant segment of the population has a sensitivity to gluten and often an entire household has to change its eating habits to adapt to someone suffering from gluten intolerance.\"\n\nGluten intolerance, or celiac disease, is an inherited autoimmune disease where the lining of the small intestine is damaged by gluten, a protein found in grains like wheat, barley and rye. The only therapy for celiac disease is to follow a gluten-free diet.\n\nIn making the gluten-free crust, Pizza 73 has implemented a series of procedures and controls to prevent product cross-contamination. In addition to having specific utensils for the product and preparation surfaces, the company has sent all store staff an updated training guide containing new product information, educational material about allergens, as well as cooking and sanitizing procedures to ensure maximum food safety.\n\nThe gluten line-up adds to Pizza 73''s crust options, which includes traditional pan, super pan and whole-wheat multigrain dough recipes.
