        "text": "Workshop Summary\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWith more than one-third of the U.S. adult population considered obese,1 a figure that has more than doubled since the mid-1970s (Flegal et al., 2010), obesity has emerged as a major public health challenge. Among children, obesity rates have more than tripled over the same period. Not only is obesity associated with numerous medical complications, but also it incurs significant economic cost. Although at its simplest, obesity is a result of an energy imbalance, with obese (and overweight2) people consuming more energy (calories3) than they are expending, in reality it is very difficult for many people to balance calories consumed with calories expended. Human eating behavior is inordinately complex, with multiple layers of influence. Eating is impacted not only by the biological responses that occur when the presence of food or even the smell of food triggers physiological\n\n____________\n\nchain reactions but also by societal norms and values around portion size and other eating behaviors.\n\nBehavioral scientists have made significant progress over the last 10–20 years toward building an evidence base for understanding what drives energy imbalance in overweight and obese individuals. Meanwhile, food scientists have been tapping into this growing evidence base to improve existing technologies and create new technologies that can be applied to alter the food supply in ways that reduce the obesity burden on the American population. As just one example, chemists at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) developed a novel, low-oil-uptake rice batter that absorbs 50 percent less oil than regular wheat batter and can be used for coating chicken, fish, vegetables, and other foods. Food scientists have developed a range of other fat-reducing technologies as well, including new processing technologies for multiple grain doughs, new baking technologies, and technologies that incorporate fiber as a fat replacement. Reducing fat content might seem like the most obvious way to reduce the energy density of a food, given the high caloric value of fat,4 but there are other ways. For example, food scientists in the beverage industry have developed reduced-calorie sweetened beverages by replacing sucrose using various zero- and low-calorie sweetener technologies.\n\nReducing the energy density of foods is by no means the only or best way to leverage food technologies in the effort to reduce and prevent obesity. Other technologies being leveraged for obesity prevention and reduction efforts include ready-to-eat portion-controlled frozen meals, which have been shown to be associated with reduced energy intake and increased short-term weight loss; a variety of fruit- and vegetable-based technologies, based on the association between fruit and vegetable intake and maintenance of a healthy weight (when substituted for more energy dense foods) and reduced risk of many chronic diseases; and technologies that enhance micronutrient density, developed on evidence suggesting that micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to overeating.\n\nOn November 2 and 3, 2010, the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM’s) Food Forum convened a public workshop in Washington, DC, to examine the complexity of human eating behavior and explore ways in which the food industry can continue to leverage modern food processing technologies to influence energy intake as one population-based change of the many\n\n____________\n\nmultifaceted societal changes that will help to reduce and prevent obesity. Through invited presentations and discussions, behavioral scientists, food scientists, and other experts from multiple sectors discussed evidence-based associations between various eating behaviors and weight gain and considered the opportunities and challenges of altering the food supply—both at home and outside the home (e.g., in restaurants)—to alleviate overeating and help consumers with long-term weight maintenance. The workshop agenda and biographies for speakers and moderators are included in Appendixes A and B, respectively.\n\nThis workshop summary was prepared by the rapporteurs for the Forum’s members and is organized into sections as a topic-by-topic description of the presentations and discussions that took place during the workshop. The main topics covered include, in order, the following: trends in overweight and obesity over the past 30 years; the complexity of eating behaviors; lessons learned and best practices; major challenges; and potential for innovation: next steps. These proceedings are not intended to be an exhaustive exploration of the subject matter. They summarize only statements made and information presented by participants at the workshop. Although participants made several suggestions for moving forward with respect to leveraging technologies in obesity reduction and prevention efforts, the goal of this workshop was not to reach consensus on any issue(s). As such, the statements summarized here represent individual beliefs; they do not represent the findings, conclusions, or recommendations of a consensus committee process.\n\nTRENDS IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY: FROM THE MID-1970s TO THE PRESENT5\n\nIn addition to 33.8 percent of the U.S. population aged 20 and over that is considered obese, another 34.2 percent is considered overweight, according to the most recently available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2007–2008) (Flegal et al., 2010). This makes for a staggering 68 percent of American adults who carry excess body weight, according to U.S. standards. Not only are all organ systems adversely affected by excess body weight, causing significant medical complications, but these medical complications in turn incur significant\n\n____________\n\nFIGURE 1 Prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults aged 20 years or older, 1976–2008. Among U.S. adults, the prevalence of both overweight and obesity has been steadily increasing since the mid-1970s. Today, approximately 70 percent of American adults are either overweight or obese.\n\nSOURCE: Data adapted from Flegal et al., 1998, 2010; Ogden et al., 2006.\n\neconomic cost. Between 1998 and 2006, the annual medical burden of obesity increased from 6.5 to 9.1 percent of annual medical spending,6 with per capita medical spending for obese persons being more than 40 percent greater than it is for persons of healthy weight (Finkelstein et al., 2009).\n\nAmong adults, the prevalence of both overweight and obesity has been increasing steadily since the mid-1970s (Figure 1) (Flegal et al., 1998, 2010; Ogden et al., 2006). Likewise among children, the prevalence of obesity more than tripled between the early 1970s and mid-2000s (Figure 2) (Ogden and Carroll, 2010). As Gary Foster, professor and director of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University, remarked, childhood obesity is especially worrisome because obese children risk developing adult conditions such as hypertension, increased cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes at a much younger age; also, obese children are more likely than normal-weight children to experience psychosocial complications such as\n\n____________\n\nFIGURE 2 Prevalence of obesity in children (6–11 years) and adolescents (12–19 years), 1971–2008. The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents has tripled since the mid-1970s, with an estimated 18 percent of today’s 6–19 year olds considered obese. SOURCE: Foster presentation (November 2, 2010); data adapted from Ogden and Carroll, 2010.\n\npeer rejection, bullying, and impaired academic performance. Additionally, obese adults who were overweight as children have a greater prevalence of medical conditions than obese adults who were not overweight as children (Baker et al., 2005; Must and Anderson, 2003; Wearing et al., 2006).\n\nAccording to 2007–2008 NHANES data (Flegal et al., 2010), non-Hispanic blacks are disproportionately burdened by obesity. Non-Hispanic blacks not only have a higher prevalence of obesity than other ethnic groups (i.e., non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and Mexican Americans), they also have a higher prevalence of class II and class III obesity.7 Increasing trends in class II and III obesity are particularly alarming because they are associated with greater impairment of quality of life, greater co-morbidity, and greater medical cost compared to the other classifications of overweight and obesity. Non-Hispanic blacks have also shown a slightly greater increase in the prevalence of obesity over time, since the mid-1970s, compared to non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans (Flegal et al., 1998; Ogden et al., 2006), with most of the divergence being among women.\n\nAccording to Foster, the fact that non-Hispanic blacks are disproportionately impacted by obesity raises questions about the extent to which\n\n____________\n\nvariation among different segments of the American population should be considered when exploring ways to leverage food technology for obesity prevention and reduction efforts. For example, are there certain types of food products that non-Hispanic blacks buy more frequently? If so, are there ways to aim interventions toward those products? Later in the workshop, other participants identified poverty as another important socioeconomic factor to consider when exploring the possibilities for intervention. For example, speaker Brendan Boyle, partner and chief invention officer at IDEO, suggested that product distribution is as important to consider as product innovation when devising technology-based strategies for obesity intervention, with a major challenge being the distribution of novel food products to lower-income neighborhoods where people would otherwise not have access to such products.\n\nArguably one of the first and most obvious variables to consider when exploring possible causes of the obesity crisis is the amount of energy in food available for human consumption, as measured by calories per capita per day. Indeed, available daily dietary energy in the U.S. food supply increased from about 3,300–3,400 calories per capita to more than 4,000 calories between 1980 and 2004 (Hiza and Bente, 2007). As Foster explained, by assuming that energy expenditure remained constant during that time, an increase in daily energy per capita of that magnitude would be enough to account for the increased prevalence of obesity in the U.S. population. However, on closer examination, macronutrient contribution to the dietary energy supply changed very little over the same time. Although the share of the daily energy supply coming from carbohydrates increased slightly in the 1980s, it has since plateaued; none of the other macronutrient profiles have changed much. One might expect to see an increase in energy availability from fat, if anything, given the high caloric density of fat, but this is not the case. Nor has there been much change in the proportion of available energy coming from any particular major food group (i.e., grains; fats and oils; sugars; meat, poultry, fish; dairy; vegetable; fruit; eggs; nuts, soy; miscellaneous). The only increases, and they have been slight (less than 5 percent change in share of total daily available calories derived from each), have been with grains and fats or oils, the latter slightly more than the former. In short, Foster concluded, while there have been slight increases in the proportion of available dietary energy coming from carbohydrates and fats or oils, the evidence does not implicate increased consumption of any particular macronutrient or food group as a primary driver of the obesity crisis.\n\nChanges in Eating Behavior Since the Mid-1970s: Three Illustrative Trends\n\nIf it is not any particular macronutrient or major food group, then what is driving the increasing prevalence of obesity among U.S. adults and children? Rather than providing a comprehensive account of every change that has occurred in behavior over the past 30 years, Foster highlighted three trends by way of illustration: (1) increases in portion size; (2) increases in snacking frequency among adolescents; and (3) increases in meals eaten outside the home (i.e., at restaurants). He identified portion size as a promising target for intervention, that is, through portion-controlled dieting, based on evidence from several studies comparing portion-controlled dieting to other diet methods.\n\nPortion Size\n\nThe fact that available calories are increasing but without any major changes in the proportion of available energy coming from any particular macronutrient or major food group suggests that people are simply eating more (of everything). Indeed, Nielsen and Popkin (2003) reported increases in portion sizes between 1977 and 1998 for many foods, including salty snacks, desserts, soft drinks, fruit drinks, French fries, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, pizza, and Mexican food. The most dramatic increases were with soft drinks and fruit drinks. In 1977–1978, the average portion size was 13.1 ounces (oz) for soft drinks and 11.3 ounces for fruit drinks; in 1989–1991, those figures jumped approximately 28 percent and 11 percent to 16.8 and 12.6 ounces, respectively; in 1994–1996, they jumped again by approximately 51 percent and 33 percent, to 19.9 and 15.1 ounces, respectively (Figure 3). Foster remarked that these data point to beverage consumption as a possible target for intervention, a strategy that Marge Leahy, director of health and wellness at the Coca-Cola Company, revisited during her presentation on zero-calorie and reduced-calorie sugar substitutes for beverages and other products. In another presentation, Jennifer Fisher, associate professor and research scientist at Temple University, explored in more detail the growing body of evidence showing that increased portion sizes are associated with increased energy intake. (Summaries of the information presented by Leahy and Fisher are provided later in this report.)\n\nFIGURE 3 Changes in portion sizes, 1977–1998.

Ditschuneit and colleagues (1999) reported significantly greater weight loss among individuals who ate four portion-controlled meal or snack replacements daily, compared to individuals on an energy-restricted diet with conventional foods (with both diets totaling 1,200–1,500 calories daily).\n\n____________\n\nThe individuals were placed on their respective diets for three months and then placed on the same weight maintenance diet (energy restricted with two portion-controlled meals or snacks daily) for 24 months. Total weight loss over the entire 27 months, as a percentage of initial weight, was 5.9 kg for the energy-restricted group and 11.3 kg for the portion-controlled group. Similar results were observed in a four-year study comparing energy restriction and portion control (Flechtner-Mors et al., 2000). Finally, a meta-analysis of reduced-calorie diets versus partial meal replacement diets concluded that partial meal replacement diets resulted in significantly greater mean weight loss over both 3-month and 12-month periods (Heymsfield et al., 2003).\n\nFoster opined that part of the reason portion control works is its simplicity. The mountain of evidence and advice on how to eat is overwhelming. By cultivating a “one-and-done” way of thinking, portion-controlled meals with fixed calorie amounts reduce much of the cognitive burden that is often placed on patients in nutrition-based obesity treatment programs. People do not need to weigh, measure, or calculate calories, fat, or any other component of what they are eating because that information is readily available on the package. Fixed-portion meals also reduce contact with “problem” food and are convenient to use because of their ready-to-eat nature. Portion control as a potentially effective target for intervention was revisited several times during the course of the workshop.\n\nSnacking Behavior Among Adolescents\n\nAccording to USDA data, snacking behavior among adolescents (12–19 years old) has changed dramatically over the past 30 years (ARS, 2010a; Hiza and Bente, 2007). In 1977, 40 percent of adolescents were not consuming any snacks at all. By 2005–2006, that figure had decreased by more than 50 percent, with only less than 20 percent of adolescents not consuming any snacks. Conversely, the percentage of adolescents consuming two or more snacks a day increased. About 15–17 percent of adolescents consumed two snacks a day in 1977, compared to nearly 30 percent in 2005–2006, and about 5 percent of adolescents consumed three snacks a day in 1977, compared to about 17 percent in 2005–2006. Not only has snacking frequency increased, but adolescents are also obtaining a greater percentage of their daily nutrients from snacks than they did in the past. In 1977–1978, adolescents obtained 14 percent of their daily nutrients (300 calories) from snacks, compared to 23 percent (a little more than 500 calories) in 2005–2006. In sum, Foster explained, adolescents are snacking\n\nFIGURE 4 Mean calorie intake by snacking frequency, adolescents aged 12–19, 2005–2006.\n\n* indicates a statistically significant trend.\n\nSOURCE: ARS, 2010a.\n\nmore frequently and obtaining more absolute calories and a greater percentage of their daily calories from snacks.9\n\nFoster remarked that increases in snacking frequency and snacking-related energy intake do not reveal much about obesity unless they are associated with increases in total energy intake. If adolescents are simply distributing the same number of calories throughout the day in the form of snacks instead of meals, an increase in snacking frequency would not have an impact on obesity, but this is not the case. The same USDA data indicate that adolescents who consume more snacks also have higher total energy intakes (Figure 4).10 Although adolescents comprise only a small proportion of the population, these data point to snacking as another potential target for intervention.\n\nFood Consumption Outside the Home\n\nFoster observed that often when people think about the products that the food industry manufactures they have in mind foods that are\n\n____________\n\nbeing purchased in grocery stores and consumed in the home. In fact, a significant portion of the food supply is consumed outside the home. Kant and Graubard (2004) reported that the percentage of adults not eating out decreased from 28 percent in 1987 to 24 percent in 1999–2000 (p < 0.0001). Not only are more people eating outside the home, but also they are eating outside the home more frequently. Kant and colleagues (2004) also reported that the percentage of adults eating three or more meals per week outside the home increased from 36 percent in 1987 to 41 percent in 1999–2000 (p < 0.0005). Even more compelling, Foster noted, are data showing that restaurant sales increased from $42.8 billion in 1970 to a forecasted $580.1 billion in 2010 (National Restaurant Association, 2010). Foster remarked that while these data do not in any way point to eating outside the home as the primary driver of the obesity crisis in America, they do suggest that commercially prepared meals that are eaten outside the home serve as another potential target for intervention.\n\nIDENTIFICATION OF TARGETS FOR INTERVENTION: EVIDENCE FROM BEHAVIOR STUDIES\n\nIndividuals make 200 to 300 food-related decisions a day (Wansink and Sobal, 2007). Multiple factors come into play when these decisions are made, creating several behavioral challenges for food scientists to tease apart when innovating technologies for the purpose of obesity prevention and reduction. This section summarizes the workshop presentations and discussions that revolved around those behavioral challenges, with a focus on portion size (and the challenge of moving the public toward eating more healthful portions); energy density (and the challenge of providing the public with less energy dense foods that taste as good or better than their counterparts); satiety (and the challenge of providing consumers with less energy dense foods that satisfy the appetite as much as their more energy dense counterparts do); and consumer perception of labels and pricing (and the challenge of providing the food industry with incentives to develop innovative technologies when faced with unpredictable consumer response).\n\nAs much progress as behavioral scientists have made over the past 10–20 years toward building an evidence base for understanding what drives energy imbalance in overweight and obese individuals, there is still a great deal to learn. Richard Mattes, distinguished professor at Purdue University, argued that it is not even clear, at a fundamental level, whether eating is controlled by an internal biological system (i.e., homeostatically)\n\nstated that it would make more sense to target food accessibility (i.e., access to a superabundant food supply, not access to nutritious and affordable foods). In traditional agricultural populations, cyclical patterns in weight gain and loss are clearly documented that offset each other, leading to stable body weight over the long term. For example, Prentice and Jebb (2004) reported a cyclical pattern in Gambian women, with annual cycles of weight loss and regain; the severity of weight loss depended on the adequacy of the previous year’s harvest. Over time, the women maintained stable weights. As another example, Corvalan and colleagues (2008) showed significant seasonal fluctuations in obesity among children (i.e., higher during fall and winter than spring and summer). Again, weight status remained the same over time. These cyclical patterns suggest that there is a functional role for eating in excess of need for a period of time because this would provide an energy reserve when external energy resources may be scarce. If this is true, Mattes remarked, the reason we have an obesity epidemic is that excess intake has not been balanced by an externally imposed food restriction (e.g., food shortage, famine). If this is the case, then according to Mattes, food accessibility (again, access to overconsumption, not access to nutritious and affordable foods) would be the most appropriate target for intervention.\n\n3. Eating is regulated through a dysfunctional internal control mechanism, with diet and lifestyle being the most appropriate target for intervention. Alternatively, eating behavior could be internally regulated but with something having become dysfunctional in the United States in the 1970s such that people’s internal biological systems are no longer sensitive enough to monitor, or strong enough to modify, energy intake in order to achieve energy balance. For example, perhaps changes in the proportion of energy from different macronutrients or food sources (e.g., beverages vs. solid foods) or decreases in daily energy expenditure have altered the functionality of regulatory systems for energy balance. Regarding the latter, studies have shown that exercise is an effective way to control appetite. Racette and colleagues (1995) reported that individuals who exercised demonstrated better compliance to an energy-restricted diet and took in less excess energy than individuals who did not exercise. If this is the case—that is, if a dysfunctional internal biological regulatory system is driving the current obesity epidemic in the United States—then\n\naccording to Mattes, the most appropriate target for intervention would be diet and lifestyle.\n\n4. Eating is regulated through both internal and external mechanisms, with palatability being the most appropriate target for intervention. A fourth scenario and one receiving considerable attention in the current scientific literature (Zheng et al., 2009) is that eating behavior is regulated by both internal and external systems. That is, appetite is internally controlled, but the body’s reward (hedonic) system is not; foods available today are so palatable that the positive feedback individuals receive from eating those foods overwhelms any biologically based appetite control. According to Mattes, if this is the case, then palatability would be the most appropriate target for intervention.\n\nMattes remarked that it is not clear which of these four theoretical eating regulation scenarios most accurately explains what is driving the current obesity epidemic in the United States. Thus, it is not clear where interventions to reduce obesity should be targeted—meal patterning, accessibility, diet and lifestyle, or palatability. In Mattes’ opinion, until such clarity is reached, it is difficult to know how best to intervene to effectively stop the spread of the obesity epidemic in the United States. Moreover, Mattes argued that fixing the magnitude of overconsumption that is driving the increase in overweight and obesity prevalence in the United States will require more than minor interventions. He pointed out the logical error in the often-cited example where a 10-calorie daily increase in energy intake over a five-year period should lead to a weight gain of 2.37 kg (Veerman et al., 2007). This would hold only if 10 calories more than needed was consumed every day, not just a fixed 10-calorie increment relative to the first day of the theoretical experiment. Thus, as weight is gained, the increment would continually rise and after five years, the required increase in energy intake to maintain body weight would be substantive. Note that the population is consuming several hundred calories more daily compared to the late 1970s, not 10 calories more. Small increments in energy will lead to small increases in body weight (other factors being held constant), and small decreases in energy intake will lead to small reductions of body weight before a new plateau is reached. Incremental reductions of energy intake may be a useful approach for some individuals, but to achieve marked weight reduction will require multiple successive adjustments.\n\nAlthough there may be no “best” intervention, this does not mean that there are no known effective interventions to reduce overeating. As already\n\nmentioned, in Foster’s opinion, one of the most promising obesity treatments is portion control, based on available evidence comparing portion control to other diet plans. As discussed in a later section of this report, Al Bolles, executive vice president of research, quality, and innovation at ConAgra Foods, effectively concurred, arguing that ready-to-eat, frozen, portion-controlled meals in particular are an underutilized resource in obesity reduction and prevention efforts. The remainder of this section explores the behavioral science evidence base from which these and similar claims are drawn.\n\nPortion Size, Energy Intake, and Obesity\n\nFisher reviewed evidence on the relationship between portion size, energy intake, and overweight and obesity; identified major challenges to reversing the recent trend in increasing portion size; and suggested potential solutions to “normalizing” portion sizes in a way that promotes more healthful eating. This section summarizes Fisher’s presentation and the discussion that followed.\n\nTrends in Portion Size\n\nFisher reiterated what Foster had mentioned in his keynote presentation—that Americans have been consuming increasingly larger portions over the past several decades, with the introduction of larger portions into the marketplace coinciding with increases in overweight and obesity in the United States (Young and Nestle, 2002, 2007). Portion size increases have been observed over a range of food types, particularly beverages, and portion size increases have been observed both inside and outside the home (Nielsen and Popkin, 2003) and among both children and adults (Popkin and Duffey, 2010). Moreover, people are eating larger portions more frequently, and snacking has increased in recent decades with increases seen in both grams and calories per snacking occasion (Piernas and Popkin, 2010a,b).\n\nRelationship Between Portion Size and Energy Intake\n\nMost of the research on the effects of portion size on energy intake has been conducted only since the early 2000s. Fisher highlighted the most salient evidence, with studies on both amorphous and unit foods (i.e.,\n\nfoods with distinct shapes) showing a strong association between increasing portion size and increasing energy intake among both adults and children. For example, in a study of 51 adults who were served a range of amorphous portion sizes of macaroni and cheese (500–1,000 g), Rolls and colleagues (2002) demonstrated a 30 percent increase in energy intake (cal/g) from the smallest to the largest portion sizes, with no observed differences in hunger or fullness. The same is true of children, with studies showing that food intake increases by about 25–60 percent, depending on the study, when children are served larger portions (2–2.5 times larger) of macaroni and cheese; energy intake of other foods served alongside the larger portions does not compensate for the extra energy intake associated with the larger portions, leading to an overall increased energy intake of 13–39 percent, again depending on the study (Fisher, 2007; Fisher et al., 2003, 2007c; Rolls et al., 2000).\n\nThe effect of portion size on energy intake is independent of the effects of energy density on energy intake, in both adults and children, with the effects of portion size exacerbated when the foods are energy dense. For example, Fisher and colleagues (2007c) reported that serving children larger portion sizes of macaroni and cheese (within the 250–500 g range) led to a 30 percent increase in energy or calorie intake on average; serving portions with increased energy density (within the 1.3 to 1.8 cal/g range) led to a 40 percent increase in energy intake; and serving larger portions of more energy dense macaroni and cheese led to a 75 percent increase in energy intake from the entrée. Again, the children did not compensate for their increased energy intake of macaroni and cheese with other foods served as part of the same meal, leading to an overall increased energy intake of about 30 percent on average.\n\nSimilar effects have been seen when either adults or children are served larger portions of unit foods (Fisher et al., 2007c; Geier et al., 2006; Rolls et al., 2004a,c), beverages (Flood et al., 2006; Rolls et al., 2007), snacks (Raynor and Wing, 2007; Rolls et al., 2004a; Wansink and Kim, 2005; Wansink et al., 2006), and fruits and vegetables (Kral et al., 2010; Mathias et al., 2009; Rolls et al., 2004b, 2010).\n\nThese data raise the question: Why do people eat more food when served larger portions? Fisher observed that the answer is unclear. Data have shown that among both children and adults, large portions lead to larger bite sizes (Fisher, 2007; Fisher et al., 2003). Bite size even increases when participants are blindfolded during eating, provided the participants are allowed to see the meal portions before the blindfold is put in place. In\n\na study of 30 adults, 14 of whom were overweight, Burger and colleagues (2011) reported that bite size increased by 2.4 g per bite—a small but significant amount—when the participants were blindfolded and served larger portions of macaroni and cheese (820 g compared to 410 g). Bite size and energy intake similarly increased when participants were allowed to view the food while eating. A study with children yielded similar findings: when served larger portions, the children took larger spoonfuls of food (Mathias et al., 2009). Fisher explained that although it is difficult to fully interpret the findings, given that adults normally do not eat when blindfolded, these data suggest that visual cues may trigger the increase in bite size. However, it is still unclear which particular visual elements impact behavior.\n\nAlthough most of the portion size studies over the past 10 years have been laboratory studies, data collected in more naturalistic settings (e.g., child care setting, movie theater) show the same effects, with some research indicating an even greater magnitude outside of controlled settings (Diliberti et al., 2004; Fisher et al., 2003; Wansink, 2004; Wansink and Kim, 2005).\n\nLong-Term Effects of Portion Size on Energy Intake and Weight Status\n\nA recurring theme throughout the course of the two-day workshop was the need for more long-term studies on the effects of various eating behaviors and interventions targeting those behaviors in terms of cumulative energy intake and, more importantly, weight status. Regarding cumulative energy intake, Fisher noted that one of the longest studies conducted to date examining the impact of portion size on energy intake was an 11-day crossover study showing that the effect of portion size on energy intake was sustained over the entire study period (Figure 5), with adults served 150 percent portion sizes daily demonstrating a significantly greater cumulative energy intake (4,928 calories) compared to the same adult participants when they were served 100 percent portions daily (Rolls et al., 2007). The 4,928 calories hypothetically translates into a weight gain of about 1.25 pounds.\n\nA handful of cross-sectional studies have evaluated associations between portion sizes consumed and actual weight status (Burger et al., 2007), but it is unclear whether trends in increasing portion size are contributing to the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States. For example, in one of the largest studies on the association between portion and weight status, involving 3,610 Swedish adults, participants were asked\n\nFIGURE 5 Mean cumulative energy intake for 10 women and 13 men served baseline portions (100 percent) and large portions (150 percent) of all foods over 11 days. Serving large portion sizes led to a significant increase in cumulative energy intake (p < 0.0001) for both sexes.\n\nSOURCE: Fisher presentation (November 2, 2010); data adapted from Rolls et al., 2007.\n\nto identify what they considered to be a typical portion size from a set of nine different sizes (Berg et al., 2009). The researchers observed a 13 percent increased risk of obesity for each increase in typical portion size—that is, participants who perceived increasingly larger portion sizes as being typical were increasingly more likely to be obese. Fisher emphasized that these and similar data are associational only, with no clarity around whether there is any causal relationship. Additionally, if there is direct causation, it is unclear which factor is driving the other—that is, whether larger individuals are drawn to larger portion sizes or larger portions are driving weight gain. The same is true of children. Although data show that heavier toddlers consume larger portions, the relationship is associational only (McConahy et al., 2002). Most experimental studies of child and adult portion sizes have not found evidence of an association between the susceptibility to overconsume large portions and weight status (Fisher, 2007; Fisher et al., 2007a,b,c; Flood et al., 2006; Rolls et al., 2000, 2004c, 2006a,b, 2007). These studies suggest that the intake-promoting effects of large portions are not specific to overweight individuals.\n\nOpportunities to Reverse the Negative Effect of Increasing Portion Sizes\n\nGiven that portion sizes are increasing and that increased portion sizes are associated with increased energy intake, the question becomes: How can the trend in increasing portion size be reversed? Steenhuis and Vermeer (2009) identified seven ways that technology can potentially be used to reverse the negative influence of increasing portion size: (1) improve front-of-package labeling; (2) improve point-of-purchase labeling; (3) use proportional pricing; (4) reduce energy density; (5) offer a wider range of sizes; (6) decrease portion sizes; and (7) use portion-controlled packaging. Fisher elaborated on three of these strategies (1, 2, and 7).\n\nFisher remarked that there are a number of opportunities to improve front-of-package labeling such that the labels provide consumers with clearer guidance on portion size, including both calories per serving and servings per package (Kessler et al., 2003; Lupton et al., 2010). Likewise, point-of-purchase labeling, such as menu labeling in restaurants, is another area in which portion size information could be communicated to consumers in a useful way. The question is: What is useful? According to Fisher, part of the challenge with providing serving size information on labels is the lack of a standard definition of serving size (Ball and Friedman, 2010). Many adults generally have a difficult time estimating portion size based on the numerical information provided. The requirement for abstract reasoning can be difficult for low-literacy populations in particular (Jae and Delvecchio, 2004). Fisher opined that it would be helpful to move away from numbers and toward visual cues that help consumers see how large a portion size is on a plate and in a package to be able to clearly delineate portion size with minimal cognition. Studies have shown that portion size aids (e.g., communicating to consumers that a portion of meat is similar in size to a deck of cards) can improve estimation (Byrd-Bredbenner and Schwartz, 2004).\n\nWith respect to leveraging technology to provide portion-controlled packaging, single-serving portion-controlled foods have been shown to aid in weight loss (Hannum et al., 2004; Jeffery et al., 1993), with 100-calorie snack packs reducing daily energy intake among frequent snackers (Raynor et al., 2009). Other types of unit reductions include separating multiple servings into single-serve packages (Vermeer et al., 2010a) and reducing the size of unit foods (Geier et al., 2006). Fisher also pointed to the work of Brian Wansink (Bruton et al., 2010) and her own work on children’s eating behavior showing that the size of eating implements can influence the amount of food requested and consumed by young children as well as\n\nthe amount adults serve to themselves. Smaller bowls and dishes may, therefore, help consumers select smaller portions in situations where portion-controlled packaging is not an option, such as when families are eating at home (Wansink et al., 2006, 2008).\n\nAs far as which of the seven technology-based intervention strategies identified by Steenhuis and Vermeer (2009) are most likely to be effective in “real-world” settings, data on merchant and consumer perspectives indicate that of the seven technology opportunities identified above, only improved labeling and reduced energy density are viewed as win-win strategies (i.e., win-win for both merchants and consumers) (Vermeer et al., 2009, 2010b). Improved labeling is viewed by merchants as a way to provide valuable information, despite difficulties with definitions, and is viewed by consumers as a way to obtain readable, visible information. Reduced energy density is viewed by both merchants and consumers as a potential strategy for addressing price value issues. The other strategies are viewed as potentially not being as helpful. For example, simply reducing portion size is viewed as patronizing and freedom-limiting.\n\nHowever, implementing even the interventions considered most desirable from both a consumer and a merchant perspective in a way that results in positive change will not be an easy task. Fisher described four major challenges to reducing portion size:\n\n1. Portion size norms are inflated. In a survey of 300 chefs, while 76 percent surveyed said that they served “regular” portions, in actuality 83 percent served portion sizes exceeding the USDA standard (Condrasky et al., 2007). Interestingly, Fisher said, the larger portions were more likely to be served by younger chefs (under the age of 51 years), with 90 percent of chefs aged 50 or younger serving portions that exceeded the USDA standard. Fisher remarked that these findings are consistent with other findings showing generational shifts in perception of overweight status, with younger individuals less likely to perceive themselves as overweight (Burke et al., 2010).\n\n3. Consumer information on portion size is difficult to understand. The most recently available NHANES data (2005–2006) show that only 47.2 percent of Americans use serving size information on labels (Ollberding et al., 2010), with those using the information consuming less energy, sugar, and fat. A significant portion of the population has difficulty interpreting consumer information on portion\n\nsize (Rothman et al., 2006). Although individuals with low literacy or numeracy appear to have the most trouble, even individuals with higher literacy or numeracy sometimes find the information difficult to interpret. Anecdotally, Fisher remarked that about 19 percent of students failed to correctly answer test questions on portion and serving size in one of her university courses.\n\n4. Asking consumers to exert self-control is not enough. Along the lines of the fourth hypothesis that Mattes put forth during his presentation to explain the current dysregulation of energy balance that seems to be driving the increasing prevalence of obesity in the United States (see discussion in preceding section of this report), Fisher remarked that humans have a relatively weak defense against energy surfeit. Accumulating evidence suggests that environmental cues (e.g., portion size, dishware size) can overwhelm the internal biological signals that indicate nutrient sufficiency (Lowe, 2003; Zheng et al., 2009). Given that this may be the case—environmental cues may overwhelm internal hunger or satiety signals—an audience member questioned whether an intuitive eating approach to weight loss, whereby individuals are taught to use hunger and full signals to guide them in consuming the appropriate amounts of food, is therefore an ineffective strategy. Mattes replied that relying on these internal signals is probably the worst way to regulate energy intake; the data show that if food is available and palatable, people will eat more of it than they should based on their energy needs. Barbara Rolls, professor and chair of the nutrition department at the Pennsylvania State University, added that there has been limited research to evaluate whether children can be taught to be more in tune with their satiety cues but that similar studies have not been conducted in adults and more data have to be collected before it can be determined whether the intuitive eating approach is effective or not (Johnson, 2000).\n\nEnergy Density, Energy Intake, and Obesity\n\nAlthough portion size clearly has a powerful effect on energy intake, Rolls put forth the argument that energy density has an even greater effect. In fact, several recent U.S. policy documents, such as the Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines\n\nfor Americans 201011 and The Surgeon General’s Vision for a Healthy and Fit Nation,12 emphasize the importance of energy density. Additionally, the American Institute for Cancer Research, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other organizations have published materials noting the importance of energy density and its role in weight management. Rolls highlighted key evidence serving as the basis for these and other policy claims around energy density, and she discussed strategies for reducing energy density. This section summarizes her presentation and the discussion that followed.\n\nEffect of Energy Density on Energy Intake\n\nThere are two general approaches to studying the effects of energy density manipulation on energy intake: (1) satiety studies involve giving study participants a compulsory first course with a fixed amount of food (the “preload”) and then evaluating the impact on subsequent hunger or fullness and food intake in the next course (the “test meal”); and (2) satiation studies involve evaluating food intake when participants eat as little or as much as they want of the offered foods. Rolls discussed how evidence from both types of studies demonstrates that when palatability is controlled, people tend to eat a similar weight of food regardless of energy density; therefore, when energy density is reduced, for example by incorporating water into a food, energy intake decreases. This is true for both children and adults.\n\nSatiety Studies on the Effect on Energy Intake of Reducing Energy Density\n\nOne of the first studies conducted on the effect of reduced energy density on energy intake involved simply increasing the water content of foods. Specifically, Rolls and colleagues (1999) reported that adding water to a casserole preload to make a soup significantly reduced energy intake during a test meal served 17 minutes later. Not only did individuals consume fewer calories after eating the soup preload than after the casserole preload, but they also consumed fewer calories than when they drank 10 ounces of water with their casserole. Rolls explained that it was not just the water that\n\n____________\n\nreduced subsequent intake; rather it was the incorporation of water into the food that made a difference.\n\nIn addition to water incorporation, another way to reduce energy density is through aeration. Rolls and colleagues (2000) examined the effect of aerating the preload on subsequent intake and found that increased aeration of blended smoothies (ranging from 300 to 600 mL) was correlated with decreased energy intake in the test meal. In a subsequent study, Bell and colleagues (2003) compared the effects of volume versus calories in order to determine which factor had a greater impact on what is known as sensory-specific satiety, that is, the termination of a meal as a result of food tasting less pleasant as more of it is consumed. When individuals consumed shakes that were increased in volume by the incorporation of water (600 mL), they reported greater reductions in sensory-specific satiety regardless of energy content (either 494 calories or 988 calories) than when they consumed smaller-volume shakes (300 mL, 494 calories). In other words, it was the larger size of the shake—not its calorie content—that made a difference.\n\nAn audience member asked about the role of aeration in decreasing the energy density of snacks in particular. Rolls reiterated that several studies with different types of snacks, such as cheese puffs, have shown that aeration leads to lower energy intake. Consumers often adjust their intake somewhat to make up for the aeration but not to a point where they are consuming the same number of calories. However, there are not enough long-term data indicating whether increasing the volume of snacks or any other foods via aeration has any effect on body weight. Mattes added that when manipulating for volume, there may be a potential benefit to simultaneously manipulating foods in ways that affect gastric distention. Otherwise, what looks big on the plate is not so big after it is swallowed. He speculated that if the cognitive response to a larger volume of food could be coupled with the biological volume detector in the body, the effect on energy intake (and possibly long-term body weight) might be more pronounced.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of how reductions in energy density impact energy intake in typical eating situations, Rolls and colleagues (2004b) examined the combined effect of reducing energy density and decreasing portion size by serving a salad preload in three different energy densities (0.33 cal/g, 0.67 cal/g, 1.33 cal/g) and two different portion sizes (150 g, or about 1.5 cups; 300 g, or about 3 cups). All combinations of energy density and portion size were tested, enabling the researchers to examine the effect of salads that were sized differently but had the same number of calories (i.e., a 100-calorie, 150 g salad vs. a 100-calorie, 300 g\n\nsalad; a 200-calorie, 150 g salad vs. a 200-calorie, 300 g salad). The salad conditions were compared to a condition in which no salad was served before the test meal. The researchers found that energy intake was influenced by both energy density and portion size, with the greatest reduction in intake observed when individuals ate the large low-energy-dense salad (300 g, 0.33 cal/g); they consumed 12 percent fewer calories at the meal than when they ate no salad (p < 0.001). So bigger can be better, Rolls said, with consumption of a large portion of a low-energy-dense food (e.g., a salad or soup) at the beginning of a meal reducing overall meal energy intake. Eating a high-energy-dense salad as a first course, on the other hand, can backfire as an energy intake reduction strategy. When people ate high-energy-dense salads, regardless of size (i.e., either 150 or 300 g salads at 1.33 cal/g), they consumed significantly more calories overall than when they ate no salad with the meal (p < 0.05 for the 150 g salad, p < 0.0001 for the 300 g salad). So large portion sizes alone are not the problem; rather, large portions of high-energy-dense foods are the problem. Rolls observed that although the implications of this finding for weight loss are unknown, the use of large, low-energy-dense salads as a first course is being used as a calorie reduction strategy in weight loss clinics nationwide and is reportedly going very well (i.e., according to anecdotal reports).\n\nSatiation Studies on the Effect on Energy Intake of Reducing Energy Density\n\nUnlike satiety studies, which involve serving a preload and then assessing the effect of the preload on fullness and intake during a subsequent course, satiation studies involve serving test foods and letting people eat as much or as little as they like and then evaluating energy intake. Rolls observed that satiation studies are more difficult to conduct than satiety studies because of the necessity of ensuring that foods in different experimental conditions are matched in terms of taste so that differences in palatability do not confound the results. One of the first satiation studies on the effect of reduced energy density on energy intake involved serving meals with varied energy densities but with the same macronutrient composition (Bell et al., 1998). The researchers reported that increasing the proportion of water-rich vegetables led to a reduction in energy density and that adults ate significantly fewer calories when energy density was reduced, with about a 25 percent difference in energy intake between the low- and high-energy-density groups after two days. There were no reported differences in hunger\n\nor fullness ratings and no evidence of compensation for the reduction in energy intake by an increase in food intake.\n\nCurious about whether the same is true of children, particularly because children are thought to compensate more than adults do, Leahy and colleagues (2008) conducted a similar two-day study in 3- to 5-year-olds involving two different levels of energy density at test meals. However, unlike studies in adults, where all meals were manipulated, the researchers manipulated only breakfast, lunch, and daytime snack (i.e., leaving dinner and evening snack unmanipulated). They reduced the energy density in several ways, such as increasing the proportion of fruits and vegetables (e.g., pureeing vegetables into the pasta sauce), reducing fat, and reducing sugar. The researchers found that reducing energy density did not affect the weight of the food consumed over the course of the two days, which meant that the children were not compensating for the reduced energy intake, and that reducing energy density significantly reduced energy intake by 14 percent (389 calories) by the end of the two days. Although it remains unclear whether this effect would be sustained over a longer period of time, these findings nonetheless suggest to Rolls that reducing energy density in foods served to children is a potentially very powerful way to reduce energy intake. The challenge, she said, is to reach those children who need this type of intervention the most.\n\nSatiation studies have also been used to examine the combined effect of energy density and portion size. Rolls and colleagues (2006b) examined the effects of 25 percent reductions in either energy density and/or portion size over the course of two days, with the energy content of all meals exceeding the energy requirements of the subjects (so participants were not limited in the amount of food that they could consume) (Figure 6). Subjects were tested in all four conditions (i.e., no change in either energy density or portion size; reduced energy density; reduced portion size; reduced energy density and reduced portion size). Energy density was reduced in several ways—for example, by incorporating vegetables into mixed dishes, using less cheese on pizza or reducing the fat content of the cheese, reducing the fat content of salad dressing, and using fruit puree instead of fat in baked goods. The researchers reported that reducing energy density by 25 percent led to a 24 percent reduction in energy intake; reducing portion size by 25 percent led to a 10 percent decrease in energy intake; and reducing both energy density and portion size by 25 percent led to a 32 percent reduction in energy intake. So energy density and portion size each independently reduced energy intake, with energy density reduction having the greater\n\nonstrated that reductions in energy density were associated with weight loss and maintenance (Ello-Martin et al., 2007; Rolls et al., 2005) and that longitudinal studies have shown associations between increased energy density and greater weight gain over 10-year periods (Bes-Rastrollo et al., 2008). Additionally, self-reported data from population-based studies indicate that normal-weight children and adults consume lower-energy-density diets (Johnson et al., 2008a,b; McCaffrey et al., 2008) than obese individuals do and that lower-energy-density diets tend to be higher in nutrient density (Ledikwe et al., 2006).\n\nStrategies for Reducing Energy Intake by Reducing Energy Density\n\nAlthough there are several ways to reduce the energy density of foods, Rolls remarked that increasing water content—for example, by increasing the proportion of fruits and vegetables—has demonstrated the greatest effect. Recent studies from Rolls’ research group have shown that vegetables can be hidden in many different types of foods, from carrot bread to macaroni and cheese to chicken rice casserole, as a way to reduce energy density while maintaining palatability (Blatt et al., 2011). In fact, both adults and children (3- to 5-year olds) demonstrated a preference for vegetable-enhanced baked goods. In adults, reducing the energy density of main dishes by 15 percent (relative to standard versions) decreased daily energy intake by 6 percent, and reducing the energy density by 25 percent decreased energy intake by 11 percent. Food intake by weight was the same across all conditions, indicating no evidence of compensation. Vegetable-enhanced entrees did not affect the intake of vegetable side dishes; overall vegetable intake increased 49 percent when adults were served main dishes with the 15 percent reduction in energy density and 80 percent when adults were served main dishes with the 25 percent reduction.\n\nOther ways to reduce energy density include increasing volume via aeration, as was done in some of the satiety studies, and decreasing fat content, as was done in some of the satiation studies. As summarized in a later section, Mohan Rao, research and development (R&D) senior director at Frito-Lay, and Elaine Champagne, ARS Food Processing & Sensory Quality research leader, discussed several innovative fat-reducing technologies (e.g., baking, using rice batter instead of wheat batter for frying) and fat-replacing technologies (e.g., replacing fat with fiber) that have been developed or are currently in development.\n\nFood Properties, Satiety, and Energy Intake\n\nAlthough high protein content, glycemic index, and certain other food properties can reduce energy intake by increasing satiety,13 speaker Mattes argued that the effects are unpredictable and likely to be only modest at best. He reviewed evidence on the association between four food properties (high protein content, glycemic index, high fiber content, food form), satiety, and energy intake. This section summarizes Mattes’ presentation and the discussion that followed.\n\nEffect of a High-Protein Diet on Satiety and Energy Balance\n\nDespite popular claims that protein has a disproportionate influence on satiety compared to other macronutrients, Mattes said that the evidence is mixed. Mattes questioned conclusions by Gardner and colleagues (2007) that the greater weight loss associated with the high-protein Atkins diet, compared to non-high-protein diets, was a result of the greater satiety value of the higher protein content of the Atkins diet. Mattes argued that the only way that the Gardner and colleagues (2007) satiety claim can be true is if participants on the high-protein diet actually reduced their energy intake. However, the data indicate otherwise, that is, no significant difference in energy intake between the high-protein diet and the other diet groups. Although there are published data indicating an effect of protein on satiety, with a higher-protein diet leaving people feeling especially full and some evidence of lower energy consumption with higher-protein diets, a number of studies have shown either that protein has no effect on satiety or energy intake, that protein has an effect on satiety but no effect on energy intake, or that it has an effect on energy intake but no effect on satiety (Eisenstein et al., 2002). According to Mattes, most of the studies that do show a clear relationship between protein, satiety, and energy intake are very short term studies. Most of the long-term studies show a less robust effect or no effect. More recently than the review by Eisenstein and colleagues (2002), Gately and colleagues (2007) reported that serving children attending a summer camp either a high-protein diet or a normal-protein diet resulted in no difference in either satiety or energy intake.\n\n____________\n\nWhy is the relationship between high protein content, satiety, and energy balance so unclear? One plausible explanation, according to Mattes, is that the vehicle for conveying the protein may be playing a role. When the same studies reviewed in Eisenstein et al. (2002) are categorized by food type, those involving proteins embedded in solid foods show much stronger associations between protein, increased satiety, and reduced energy intake compared to studies involving proteins embedded in beverages. It is not clear why. Although it has been argued that the weak associations in beverages are likely due to the fact that only so much protein can be put into a beverage, Mattes observed that beverages can in fact have substantial protein loads and that consumption of high-protein beverages may not moderate energy intake. Rumpler and colleagues (2006) compared high-protein beverages (40 g protein per 750 g), high-carbohydrate beverages (113 g carbohydrates per 750 g), and high-fat beverages (50 g fat per 750 g) and found that the average energy intake associated with drinking high-protein beverages over an eight-week period increased over time.\n\nAnother plausible explanation for the mixed evidence on the relationship between high protein content, satiety, and energy balance is that the source of the protein makes a difference. For instance, Hall and colleagues (2003) found that whey protein increased satiety and decreased appetite more than equal amounts of casein. However, Lang and colleagues (1998) reported no significantly different satiety ratings or energy intakes among different protein sources (i.e., egg protein, casein, gelatin, soy protein, pea protein, wheat protein). Bowen and colleagues (2006) also found that although the two milk proteins—casein and whey—were observed to increase satiety more than lactose (a milk sugar), all three had essentially the same effect on appetite and energy intake suppression.\n\nAlthough it is unclear whether protein really has a greater effect than other macronutrients on energy intake by virtue of its effect on satiety, Mattes explained that protein can impact energy balance in other ways—for example, through thermogenesis (i.e., protein requires energy for digesting, absorbing, etc.) and via the retention of lean body mass (which leads to increased metabolism and greater caloric expenditure).\n\nEffect of High-Fiber Foods on Satiety and Energy Intake\n\nAs with high-protein foods, there is widespread belief that high-fiber foods can impact satiety and, as a result, energy intake. Indeed, the 2010 USDA Dietary Guidelines recommend increased fiber consumption partly\n\nbecause of the purportedly increased satiety value of high-fiber foods (DGAC, 2010). However, again, Mattes argued that the disproportionate effect of high fiber content on satiety and energy balance is unclear. As with protein, the evidence is mixed. As an example of the type of research being cited as showing an association between high-fiber foods and satiety, Tiwary and colleagues (1997) reported significant differences in satiety between individuals served orange juice by itself versus orange juice with pectin, with individuals served the latter reporting higher satiety scores. However, the authors also acknowledged that a number of the participants served the high-fiber orange juice were nauseated and under gastrointestinal distress, which likely explained why they did not want to continue eating. Mattes speculated that results from other studies showing positive effects on satiety and energy intake as a result of high-fiber consumption may similarly be confounded by the fact that very high doses (e.g., the recommended daily allotment: 25–38 g for females and males, respectively) are administered in one meal to participants accustomed to eating a third of this amount in a day to document a proof of principle. This may result in a misleading, non-ecological outcome. As an example of a recent study showing no effect of high fiber content on satiety or energy intake, Willis and colleagues (2010) reported no dose-response difference in satiety or food intake among subjects served 0, 4, 8, or 12 g of mixed-fiber breakfast muffins.\n\nAgain, why is the relationship between high fiber content, satiety, and energy balance so unclear? Howarth and colleagues (2001) conducted a literature review of fiber, satiety, and energy intake, categorizing studies by time (shorter or longer than two days) and type of manipulation (mixed fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber) and found about a consistent 10 percent reduction in energy intake. So neither the length of the study nor the type of fiber made a difference. Moreover, Mattes explained, when the studies are categorized by fixed intake (i.e., people were given a fixed amount of food) versus ad libitum intake (i.e., people had some choice about how much they were going to ingest) daily weight loss as a function of added fiber was the same for both, even though studies with a fixed fiber load show a 20 g per day weight loss, on average, compared to a 24 g daily weight loss in the ad libitum intake studies. So regardless of whether individuals were on a fixed- or an ad libitum fiber intake diet, they lost the same amount of weight (2 g per day) for every 1 g of added fiber (average fiber consumption in the fixed load studies was 10 g per day, compared to 12 g per day in the ad libitum studies). Because appetite would be free to exert its effect on intake in the ad libitum trials, but not in the fixed-intake trials, Mattes interpreted this\n\nto mean that there is no benefit in terms of weight loss due to the greater satiety value of increased fiber consumption. People would have to consume significantly more fiber than is feasible in order to see any dramatic difference in weight loss. Again, this does not argue against increased fiber consumption for optimal health, but expectations about the effects on body weight should be realistic according to Mattes.\n\nEffect of Glycemic Index on Satiety and Energy Intake\n\nLike high protein and fiber, glycemic index does not make for a good predictor of satiety either. Jenkins and colleagues (2002) showed that glucose levels quickly peaked but then dropped in individuals served glasses of water with 50 g of glucose per glass. Yet when the same glycemic index load was served to people over the course of 3.5 hours, there was no change in blood glucose levels. So the amount of time that consumers spend eating a product influenced response. In another study (Alfenas and Mattes, 2005), when individuals were served and allowed to eat ad libitum for eight days either all low-glycemic-index or high-glycemic-index foods, no differences were observed in either glycemic or insulinemic response. Nor were any differences in hunger reported. So again, Mattes cautioned that glycemic index is not a useful predictor of energy intake.\n\nEffect of Food Form (i.e., Beverage vs. Solid) on Satiety and Energy Intake\n\nThe role of food form in determining energy intake via its impact on satiety is a very controversial topic, with strong views on both sides. Mourao and colleagues (2007) compared identical foods served in either beverage or solid form, with the predominant form of macronutrient being either a carbohydrate (watermelon), a fat (coconut), or a protein (dairy). For all foods, the researchers reported significantly greater energy intake when the foods were consumed as beverages. Thus, Mourao and colleagues concluded that liquid diets pose a greater risk for positive energy balance (e.g., weight gain) because liquids have a lower satiety value than solid foods. In one of the largest randomized controlled trials on food form and energy intake conducted to date, Houchins and colleagues (2011) provided individuals with five servings of fruits and vegetables in either beverage or solid form for eight weeks and reported that although all individuals gained weight over the course of the study (i.e., because adding foods to a diet without displacing other foods increases energy intake), individuals who consumed\n\ntheir fruits and vegetables in beverage form tended to gain more weight (significantly so in the obese participants), again presumably because of the greater satiety value of the solid foods. Mattes explained that compared to solid foods, beverages have different cognitive effects (i.e., anticipated lower satiety value for a beverage than for a matched solid form, such as apple juice [even correcting for fiber] versus apples), produce different orosensory signals, pass through the gastrointestinal tract faster, elicit different endocrine responses, and are absorbed differently than solid foods, with all of these physiological response(s) to beverages bypassing many of the normal regulatory influences on energy intake.\n\nConsumer Decision Making and Energy Intake\n\nIn addition to identifying eating behaviors that serve as good targets for innovative food technology-based obesity prevention and reduction interventions, it is equally important to consider how consumers make decisions about the products that have been altered with those technologies. As speaker David Just, associate professor in applied economics and management and director of graduate studies at Cornell University emphasized, an innovative food technology can be leveraged for obesity prevention and reduction efforts only if (1) a producer actually sells a product that has been improved with the technology, which means that the cost of production needs to be lower than that for comparable products or there has to be some additional value to justify the price premium; (2) consumers actually purchase the product, which means that the product needs to be reasonably priced and similar to or better tasting than comparable products and that consumers need to have a positive perception of the product; and (3) the improvement made possible by the technology is not immiserizing (i.e., does not have unintended consequences), which means that consumers need to understand the improvement in a way that leads to a preference for the product and in a way that does not lead to compensatory behavior.\n\nDeciding what food to purchase or eat is not an individual-level decision. It is part of a game between the manufacturer and the consumer, wherein consumers are not fully aware of their behavior (e.g., they often misunderstand information or misperceive the consequences of consumption) but manufacturers are (as a result of market research, etc.). When new foods are introduced to the marketplace, marketers make the decision about whether to differentiate the new product from other products already on the market. Consumers simply respond to the new product landscape.\n\nConsumers do not always react to prices and nutritional or other information about new products in rational ways; rather than weighing the various consequences of their actions and giving appropriate weight to vague information, most people fall back on habits and heuristic decision making. Just explained that when marketers differentiate between an improved product and the original product that it is replacing by drawing attention to the fact that the new product has certain health benefits, unpredictable behaviors can offset the intended health benefit of the new product. Health-conscious consumers are likely to overemphasize the health benefit of the new product and be willing to pay more than the innovation is really worth. It is also very likely that consumers that purchase the product would exhibit compensatory behavior, depending on the health claim. Narrow health claims (e.g., low fat, low calorie, low sugar) tend to be more distracting than broader health claims, with individuals often eating more than they intend (Wansink et al., 2004). For example, someone may eat more of something that is claimed to be “low fat” or may decide to eat dessert later because she or he ate a low-fat main course earlier. Unlike health-conscious consumers, consumers who associate health with bad taste or otherwise do not recognize the true health benefits of a new product would be much less willing to pay for the improved product and probably would continue to purchase the lower-priced product. Just remarked that many consumers believe that when changes are made to a food—for example, when sugar is reduced or fat removed—the food will not taste as good as the original product. Even when told otherwise, people expect the food to taste different. Wansink and Park (2002) have shown that just the appearance of the word “soy” can lead some consumers to believe that there is a huge difference in taste between soy-based products and other products. Consumers that decide not to purchase the new product would not receive any of the advertised health benefits at all. In summary, with differentiation, neither type of consumer would necessarily derive any benefit from the new product.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the marketer decides not to differentiate between the new product and comparable products, such that consumers are unaware of any special benefit of the new product, the marketer would be failing to take advantage of health-conscious consumers’ willingness to pay for the higher-priced product and would earn less profit. All consumers, health conscious or not, would choose the lower-priced product, and the new product would end up disappearing from the market. Again, neither type of consumer would derive any benefit from the new product. So, differentiating between new food products that have been improved through\n\ntechnology leads to anomalous consumer behavior, with people responding irrationally and with health measures often backfiring. On the other hand, not differentiating between products can lead to a situation in which consumers are not aware of the benefits while producers are not able to capture the profits from those benefits. The only exception, Just explained, would be in the event that the cost of production of the new product was low enough to offer only one product, that is, the new product. In that case, all consumers would purchase the product and benefit accordingly.\n\nGiven that neither approach leads to optimal consumption, are there other options? Because more people are likely to benefit from non-differentiation (i.e., if only the new product is offered and the old product is removed from the market), is there a way to make a new product the norm without creating product differentiation? Without profit incentive, what other incentives are there? How can firms be rewarded for innovation? Are there ways to introduce differentiated products without creating these anomalous behavioral responses? Just did not provide answers to these questions.\n\nWhen asked during the question-and-answer period how convenience impacts consumer behavior, Just replied that even a small change in convenience has a disproportionately large impact on consumer preference. As an extreme example, merely having the lid shut on an ice cream cooler in a store makes a big difference in how much ice cream people purchase. As another example, studies with school children have demonstrated that even a small, 6-inch difference in where milk versus chocolate milk is placed results in 20–30 percent of the children changing their minds about which type of milk to buy.\n\nLESSONS LEARNED AND BEST PRACTICES\n\nWorkshop participants described several different types of technologies that have been developed and commercialized for the purpose of providing consumers with foods that can be used for weight loss or maintenance. These include reduced energy dense foods with lower fat or sugar content (see previous section for a summary of the workshop dialogue on the relationship between energy density, energy intake, and obesity); foods that are packaged to make it easy for consumers to control portion size (again, see previous section for a summary of the workshop dialogue on the relationship between portion size, energy intake, and obesity); foods that increase fruit and vegetable intake (Tara McHugh, ARS research leader of the Pro-\n\ncessed Foods Research Unit, mentioned that low fruit and vegetable intake is a key risk factor for several chronic diseases); and foods with increased micronutrient density (as McHugh mentioned, biochemist Bruce Ames has hypothesized that insufficient micronutrient intake may drive overeating). This section summarizes the presentations and discussions that revolved around each of these various categories of technology.\n\nReducing Calories by Reducing Fat\n\nAlthough removing or reducing fat content of food products is technologically challenging, it is possible. The challenge is not the actual removal of the fat, rather it is maintaining taste. Food manufacturers and scientists have leveraged several different technologies for removing fat without sacrificing taste. For instance, Rao described Frito-Lay’s development of new mixing, cooking, and frying technologies that led to a 30 percent fat reduction in SunChips (compared to regular potato chips) and the company’s novel heat transfer technology, which led to the creation and commercialization of Baked Lay’s, while Champagne described USDA scientists’ several generations of grain-based technologies for reducing fat (i.e., by replacing fat with fiber and through an innovative low-oil-uptake rice batter). This subsection summarizes their presentations.\n\nFrito-Lay Fat Reduction Strategies for Snack Foods\n\nInitiated in the late 1970s by Frito-Lay’s Lawrence Wisdom, the drive behind SunChips was to reduce fat by at least 25 percent and provide consumers with a snack product that was less energy dense than potato chips and other snack products on the market. It was a lengthy and difficult challenge, one that required new mixing, cooking, and frying technologies. As Rao explained, blending and cooking the four grains that comprise SunChips—whole wheat, whole milled corn, whole oat flour, and rice flour—required a new manufacturing process, which in turn required significant investment and represented substantial risk. Frito-Lay had to invent a new process for making and cooking the multiple-grain dough in such a way that the end product was homogeneous with respect to both composition (of ingredients) and dough properties (e.g., same thickness and crunchiness throughout). This required designing a new type of extruder technology that could mix four different grains, with different properties, and cook them all to the same degree by integrating computa-\n\ntional fluid dynamics modeling into the extrusion process. This ensured that the flow of the food product through the extruder was exactly the same across its entire width so the extruded product had uniform quality in terms of texture, density, etc. Additionally, company scientists had to figure out how to control the fryer to ensure that the end product had, at a minimum, 25 percent less fat than regular potato chips, which required developing a novel type of dynamics matrix control technology—a system for measuring various output variables (e.g., amount of fat, color of chips) and using the information to change relevant input variables (e.g., temperature, length of frying) accordingly. The company ended up exceeding its goal of 25 percent less fat: SunChips contain 30 percent less fat than regular potato chips.\n\nThe fat content of Baked Lay’s was reduced through a different set of innovative technologies, all baking-related, not frying-related. Rao remarked that, again, development of the technologies required overcoming significant technological challenges, this time related to heat transfer. He explained that producing a baked potato chip that tastes good (not like cardboard) requires more than just slicing the potatoes and popping them in an oven. During “normal” processing of a potato chip, that is, via frying, heat transfer occurs quickly such that the center of the potato slice rapidly heats up while there is still water present, which makes for a nicely expanded, swollen, puffy chip. In the oven, where heat transfer is much slower, the starch inside the cells in the middle of the slices does not expand in the same way—in fact, it partially gelatinizes. Along with some other changes to the manufacturing process, Frito-Lay had to design an extremely high heat transfer rate oven in order to create a crispy-textured chip.\n\nUSDA Grain-Based Technologies for Fat Reduction\n\nOutside of the food industry, USDA scientists have been involved in developing a range of innovative grain-based technologies for fat reduction, including several types of soluble and insoluble fiber fat replacers and a reduced-fat-uptake rice batter.\n\nThe Trim soluble fiber fat replacement products, OATrim, Nutrim, and C-Trim, and the insoluble fiber fat replacer Z-Trim, were developed by USDA researcher George Inglett. As Champagne explained, all four products are tasteless white powders, which makes them easy to incorporate into food products; additionally, all are heat stable and therefore suitable for a wide range of cooked or baked foods.\n\nThe process for the first-generation fiber-based fat replacer, OATrim, involved alpha-amylase hydrolyzing the starch in oat, barley flour, or bran into a combination of amylodextrins and beta-glucan. The amylodextrins are the actual fat replacers; they create a smooth mouthfeel. The beta-glucan provides beneficial physiological effects, namely a reduction of blood cholesterol. As a dry powder, OATrim contains 4.5 cal/g, compared to 9 cal/g for fat. As a fat-like gel, OATrim contains only 1 cal/g. When OATrim is used as a fat replacer in ice cream, calories of a 4-ounce serving are reduced from 298 to 135, fat is reduced from 22 g to less than 1 g, and cholesterol is reduced from 85 mg to 4 mg. Studies (i.e., the OATrim TRIALS) conducted by ARS researchers Judith Hallfrisch and Kay Behall have demonstrated that in middle-aged men and women with high cholesterol levels, five weeks of an OATrim-enhanced diet (a total of 50 g, or 0.5 cup, per day, added to various foods throughout the day, amounting to one-quarter of all fat in foods being replaced by the OATrim) led to decreased LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels (but not HDL [high-density lipoprotein] cholesterol), an improvement in glucose tolerance (reduced insulin, glucagon, and blood glucose levels), weight loss (4.5 pounds on average), and increased satiety (Hallfrisch and Behall, 1997; Hallfrisch et al., 1995; Scholfield et al., 1993). It took five years for OATrim to move from the lab to the market, where it is now labeled as “hydrolyzed oat bran.” Hydrolyzed oat bran is used in a wide range of food products, including pasteurized cheeses, baked products (breads, cookies, and muffins), processed meats, extra lean ground beef, and nutrition bars.\n\nManufacture of the second-generation product, Nutrim, relies on jet-cooking, instead of alpha-amylase, to produce the same two end products, that is, amylodextrins (the actual fat replacer) and beta-glucan. Like OATrim, Nutrim contains only 4 cal/g, compared to fat’s 9 cal/g. Nutrim has some unique properties that give it a creamy texture and make it a good replacer for dairy and coconut cream. It is used in soups, spreads, and salad dressings and is also sold as a nutraceutical.\n\nThe manufacturing process for C-Trim, the most recent soluble fat replacer, relies on a specific sequence of aqueous extraction and jet-cooking steps to produce the same end products, the amylodextrins and beta-glucan, as well as a high proportion of proteins and some bioactive phenolics. C-Trim has some unique properties that give it a very high viscosity and make it a good fat replacer in yogurt, smoothies, baked goods, and chocolates (replacing as much as 25 percent of cocoa butter). It is also sold as a nutraceutical. At 2.5–3.5 cal/g, C-Trim is also less energy dense than either\n\nof the other two (powdered) products. A 4 percent addition of C-Trim to wheat batter can lead to a low-oil-uptake batter (a 40 percent reduction in oil uptake compared to traditional wheat batter).\n\nInsoluble fiber fat replacers are manufactured via a multistage jet-cooking process that chews up the insoluble fiber in the bran or hulls of various grains (oats, corn, rice, wheat, soy) and produces a cellular debris that can have any of a range of textures, from a particle-like structure to a creaminess to a gel. If a 75 kg individual were to consume Z-Trim, a zero-calorie insoluble fiber fat replacer, at the daily recommended amount of fiber and as a one-to-one replacement for fat, he or she would consume 225 fewer calories per day. Champagne suggested that, like C-Trim, insoluble fiber fat replacers not only reduce fat content, but may also increase satiety by virtue of their high viscosity, in this case absorbing 24 times their weight in water. However, insoluble fiber fat replacers are not as effective as soluble fiber fat replacers in improving glucose tolerance.\n\nReducing fat content through use of a novel low-oil-uptake rice batter represents a very different approach but one with multiple applications, like the TRIM technologies. As Champagne explained, not only does the small starch granule size of rice (3–5 microns) simulate a fat mouthfeel effect, but also its white color and bland taste, combined with the fact that it is hypoallergenic and gluten-free, make it a naturally good fat replacer. Initially, using a traditional wheat flour recipe, USDA chemists developed a rice batter that, because of its gluten-free composition, absorbed only 50 percent of the oil that traditional wheat flour batter absorbs. Gluten’s hydrophobic nature gives it a greater affinity for oil; gluten also has a leavening effect that makes wheat batter more porous, leading to greater moisture release and greater oil uptake. However the initial rice batter, while less absorbent, was also brittle and hard to chew because of its low viscosity. So the scientists tested ways to improve the properties of rice batter by increasing its viscosity; they eventually determined that incorporation of either 3–7 percent phosphorylated rice starch or 3–7 percent pre-gelatinized rice flour into the untreated rice flour enhanced the batter’s water-holding capacity enough to make a batter that not only absorbs 50 percent less oil, or fat, than a wheat-based batter but also is more viscous and easier to chew. In fact, the viscosity of the improved rice batter was even greater than that of wheat batter.\n\nPatented in 2001, the rice batter technology languished for a few years, until a class at Howard County Community College, Columbia, Maryland, adopted the technology in 2006 as part of a class project to determine the feasibility of commercialization. Two years later, a group of students from\n\nthe class founded CrispTek, LLC, and licensed the rice batter from USDA. In 2009, CrispTek released its first product, ChoiceBatter, with start-up funding from the Maryland Technology Development Corporation. Initially, ChoiceBatter was sold over the Internet. Today, it is sold in more than 400 grocery stores. A recent economic impact study predicts that sales will increase to $4.7 million by 2014, with 95 new jobs being created as a result of increased production. The batter can be used on chicken, fish, vegetables, etc., and it can also be used to make soups, sauces, and other foods for people on gluten-free diets. Through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with CrispTek, ARS is conducting research to expand application of the technology to pre-breaded frozen food products. As discussed later in this report, CRADA is one of two mechanisms through which manufacturers can partner with ARS to commercialize new food technologies developed by ARS scientists.\n\nReducing Calories by Reducing Sugar\n\nAlthough removing fat may seem like the most obvious way to reduce the energy density of foods, given that fat contains more calories per gram (9 cal/g) than any other macronutrient and that fiber, for example, contains only 1.5–2.5 cal/g, energy density can also be reduced by removing or reducing sugar. Removing or reducing the sugar content of beverages provides an especially excellent opportunity, given the increased consumption of sugar-containing beverages over the past several decades (a trend that keynote speaker Foster identified) and given that, as Leahy noted, beverages are essentially the only foods besides chewing gums and some mints that can be calorie-free. The food industry has developed numerous reduced-calorie beverages over the years by reducing or replacing sucrose with no- or low-calorie sweeteners. As a result, Leahy said, the overall mix of beverage products in the marketplace has changed over the past 20 years, with the average caloric density of beverages (calories per ounce) having decreased by 24.4 percent. Most of the change in caloric density (21 percent) has occurred over the past 10 years (Storey, 2010). When the Coca-Cola Company’s first zero-calorie soft drink, TaB, which is sweetened with saccharine, was introduced in 1963, only 1 percent of the company’s trademark product volume was zero-calorie products. When the company’s second zero-calorie soft drink, Diet Coke, sweetened with aspartame, was introduced in 1982, 32 percent of the Coca-Cola trademark product volume was zero- or reduced-calorie products. Finally, when Coke Zero, sweetened with aspartame and\n\nacesulfame K, was introduced in 2005, as much as 41 percent of the Coca-Cola trademark product volume was zero- or low-calorie. Leahy referred to research showing that using low-calorie sweeteners can aid in weight loss and maintenance (Blackburn et al., 1997; de la Hunty et al., 2006; Phelan et al., 2009).\n\nLeahy identified three general types of caloric sweeteners: (1) isolated refined sugars, including sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, glucose, fructose, and maltose; (2) fruit, including apple, grape, pear, and LoHanGuo (monk fruit) concentrate; and (3) other plant parts or products, such as honey, agave, and grain syrups. She identified two general types of no- or low-calorie sweeteners: (1) new and “natural” sweeteners made possible by technological advances, including Reb A (rebaudioside A or rebiana, an extract of Stevia that is based on the purity of one particular glycoside), other Stevia leaf extracts with greater numbers of glycosides, LoHanGuo extract, monatin (from a South African plant), brazzein (a sweet protein from a West African plant), and so forth; and (2) established sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame K, saccharine, and sucralose.\n\nWhile sweetened beverages provide an important opportunity for sugar reduction technologies to be leveraged for obesity prevention and control efforts, other foods stand to be improved as well. For example, Lydia Midness, vice president of R&D at General Mills, Inc., remarked that General Mills has been working toward reducing the sugar content to less than 12 g of sugar per serving for ready-to-eat cereals being advertised to children. She noted that reducing sugar poses enormous formulation challenges because sugar acts as a bulking agent; when sugar is removed, aeration or other tools need to be used to increase volume.\n\nUsing Portion-Controlled Frozen Meals to Reduce Calorie Intake\n\nReducing the energy density of foods by removing or reducing fats and sugars is by no means the only way to reduce calorie intake. Bolles highlighted key evidence indicating that portion-controlled frozen meals are another effective means of reducing calorie intake. As previously summarized, Foster opined that one of the most promising obesity treatments is portion control, with several studies showing that providing patients with portion-controlled meals is a more effective weight loss strategy than telling patients to keep track of calories. Bolles effectively concurred, stating that the weight loss benefits of including portion-controlled meals as a regular part of one’s diet can be immediate. McCarron and colleagues (1997)\n\nshowed that adult males and females who consumed a reduced-calorie diet for 10 weeks centered around frozen meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (N = 272) lost significantly more weight (–10.3 vs. –6.8 pounds, p = 0.03) compared to a control group on a reduced-calorie diet without frozen meals (N = 270). More recently, Hannum and colleagues (2004) showed that adult females who consumed a reduced-calorie diet for eight weeks with frozen meals for lunch and dinner (N = 26) lost significantly more weight (–12.3 vs. –7.9 pounds, p < 0.05) than a control group on a reduced-calorie diet without frozen meals (N = 27). Using an identical protocol, Hannum and colleagues (2006) demonstrated similar results for men, with weight loss significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the group consuming frozen meals (N = 25, –16.3 pounds) compared to the control group without frozen meals (N = 26, –11.2 pounds). A longer-term study by Metz and colleagues (2000) also demonstrated that individuals who consumed a reduced-calorie diet utilizing frozen meals for 12 months (N = 120, –12.8 pounds) lost significantly more weight (p < 0.001) than the reduced-calorie diet control group without frozen meals (N = 130, –3.7 pounds).\n\nIn 2010, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a Nutrition Evidence Library-based assessment of the relationship between weight loss and use of portion-controlled frozen meals (DGAC, 2010). A grading system was applied that considered research quality, quantity, consistency, magnitude of effect, and whether the observations could be generalized to the population of interest. These data were ranked as strong, the highest grade within the systematic review process. Recently, ConAgra Foods offered a weight loss program to employees in which 172 participants consumed two portion-controlled frozen or ready-to-eat meals daily from the ConAgra Foods portfolio over the course of four weeks and self-selected for additional foods. Mean weight loss was 7.5 pounds, and a follow-up survey conducted two months later found that 55 percent of the participants had maintained their weight loss and that 26 percent had continued to lose weight. The follow-up success was attributed to lessons learned during the initial program, with 83 percent of participants reporting that the use of frozen meals taught them the principle of portion control. Bolles interpreted these results to mean that not only can portion-controlled, frozen, ready-to-eat meals help people lose weight, but they can also help people to change their behavior by increasing awareness of portion size.\n\nAdditionally, Bolles said, portion-controlled frozen meals are an effective way to reduce energy density. ConAgra Food’s frozen meals across the Healthy Choice, Banquet, and Marie Callender’s brands have an energy\n\ndensity (calories per gram) in the lower quartile of energy density for the entire diet based on data from NHANES (Kant et al., 2008; Mendoza et al., 2007). Furthermore, these meals contain substantially less saturated fat, sodium, and sugar than typical self-selected lunches and dinners as reported in NHANES (ARS, 2010b).\n\nIncreasing Fruit and Vegetable Intake\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have identified low fruit and vegetable intake as a key risk factor for several chronic diseases (FAO-WHO, 2004). Additionally, the Economic Research Service (ERS) of USDA has found that people who eat more fruit servings per day have lower BMIs (the same is not true of vegetables because of the inclusion of French fries as a vegetable) (Biing-Hwan and Mentzer Morrison, 2002). Yet less than 30 percent of Americans eat the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables (Morales, 2010). In an effort to reduce the risk of obesity by increasing fruit and vegetable intake, in addition to the fat-reducing technologies described by Champagne (and summarized previously), ARS scientists have also been developing a variety of fruit- and vegetable-based technologies designed to make fruit and vegetable consumption more convenient. McHugh provided an overview of the types of products being developed with four of those technologies: forming, extrusion, casting, and coating. (As summarized below, McHugh also discussed a fifth technology, ultraviolet [UV] treatment, and its use in enhancing the micronutrient content of mushrooms and other vegetables.)\n\nForming Technology and Fruit Bars\n\nARS scientists developed a novel forming technology to create a 100 percent fruit bar, which Gorge Delights sells as the JustFruit bar, with each bar equivalent to two servings of fruit. Gorge Delights also produces a one-serving bar for school lunch and other programs, as well as organic and fortified versions of the bar. The bar was the product of a partnership between ARS and pear and apple growers who had been having trouble competing in the Oregon and Washington fresh fruit market; the partnership was formed to develop value-added technologies so that growers could continue to sell their fruit. Gorge Delights sold 500,000 bars the first year. The total number of bars sold to date amounts to about 550,000,000. (The\n\nsame forming technology is also being used to develop a micronutrient-rich bar. See below.)\n\nExtrusion Technology and Legume-Based Cereals and Snacks\n\nAs with fruit, the USDA ERS has found that people who eat more fiber have lower BMIs. In addition to having more fiber, legume-based products also have higher protein content than other extruded snack foods. As a way to increase legume intake, Jose Berrios of ARS and collaborators from Washington State University have been using a novel extrusion technology to develop legume-based breakfast cereals and snack food products.\n\nCasting Technology and Fruit- and Vegetable-Based Films and Sheets\n\nARS scientists used casting technology to develop films or thin sheets containing 85–90 percent fruits and vegetables, and the service partnered with NewGem Foods (formerly Origami Foods) to transfer the technology into commercialization of a variety of fruit- and vegetable-based nori (sushi wraps) and other products. In 2010, after only 1.5 years of production, the company reported having sold a total of $400,000 worth of wraps, amounting to about 131,555 pounds of fruits and vegetables. According to McHugh, it expects to increase sales to greater than $1 million in 2011.\n\nIn collaboration with Mantrose-Haeuser, Dominic Wang and other ARS scientists developed a fruit-based liquid coating technology that contains antioxidants and other compounds for extending the shelf life of fresh-cut produce. Mantrose-Haeuser has commercialized the technology through production of a range of products, including McDonald’s Apple Dippers. McDonald’s sold 54 million pounds of apples during 2005, the first year of production.\n\nIncreasing Micronutrient Density\n\nBiochemist Bruce Ames has proposed that overconsumption of macronutrient-rich foods (i.e., high-sugar and high-fat foods)—that is, overeating—may be driven by dietary deficiencies in essential micronutrients and that eliminating these deficiencies could reduce or eliminate overconsumption (Ames, 2006). In collaboration with the Ames research group at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI) in Oakland, California, the ARS is applying the forming technology mentioned above\n\nto develop a novel, micronutrient-rich “obesity prevention” bar. Phase II clinical trials are under way.\n\nIn a separate effort to increase micronutrient intake, McHugh and other ARS scientists developed a way to treat mushrooms with UV-B light in such a way that one of the mushroom’s naturally existing compounds, ergosterol, is converted into vitamin D, with 15 seconds of UV-B treatment producing 100 times the current Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in a single serving of mushrooms. McHugh remarked that application of UV-B technology to mushrooms represents a convenient way to increase vitamin D intake and that the process is being used nationwide by the number one mushroom producer, Monterey Mushrooms, on all of its mushroom varieties. ARS has also partnered with the USDA Western Human Nutrition Research Center to study the bioavailability of vitamin D from these mushrooms (compared to bioavailability from capsules) and is using USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture funds to evaluate how the same technology can be used to enhance antioxidant content of carrots and other vegetables.\n\nAccording to Leahy, food scientists in industry are developing other innovative technologies to enhance vitamin D and micronutrient content and bioavailability in various beverages, including milk. These new technologies include new bioconversion or bioprocessing technologies for adding soluble fibers and increasing nutrient levels; ne"
