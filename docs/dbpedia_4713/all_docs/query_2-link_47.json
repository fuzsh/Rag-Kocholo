        "text": "Pizza Pizza, the behemoth central Canadian pizza maker, has launched a cross-country food fight aiming to take a bite out of the West's burgeoning fast-food market through the acquisition of Edmonton-based Flying Pizza 73 Inc.\n\nThe deal, carrying a pricetag of $70.3 million, will give the Pizza Pizza Royalty Income Fund (TSX: PZA.UN) the \"intellectual property\" of Pizza 73 and its 48-restaurant system, and a nine per cent royalty on sales.\n\nThe announcement marks a step in Pizza Pizza's longtime plan to move outside Ontario and Quebec, where it is the dominant provider with 532 locations.\n\nIt came one day after Quiznos Sub heated up competition by presenting its own line of flatbread pizzas.\n\nMeanwhile, Western Canada's Panago, marketed as a premium pizza alternative, has opened stores in Ontario, hoping to win market share with side dishes like fresh salad with shrimp.\n\nThe company has also found success selling pizza slices to walk-in customers, according to Cameron Wood, editor of trade publication Canadian Pizza.\n\n\"The major trend in pizza right now is going towards the single-slice market,\" Wood said.\n\n\"You're looking at a lunchtime group, a commuter or urban professional-type â€“ a slice is a logical choice versus ordering a whole pizza.\"\n\nThe company has the opportunity to grab a piece of the booming Western Canada economy which has seen an influx of workers and plumped up Pizza 73's results.\n\nSystem sales were $65 million in the year ended April 21, up from $52.8 million in the previous year. Sales at outlets open a year or more increased 26 per cent.\n\nPizza Pizza said it expects same-restaurant sales to grow further, but not necessarily at the double-digit percentage rates experienced in recent years.\n\n\"I think the challenge for Pizza Pizza is keeping staff,\" he said, noting that this a problem for everybody in food service in Alberta, where many fast-food attendants are pulling in $15 or more per hour, plus incentives like trips and MP3 players.\n\nThe Pizza Pizza trust will acquire the trademarks and other intellectual property of Pizza 73 for $54 million, while the Pizza Pizza operating company will buy the operating business for $16.2 million.\n\nAn additional $3 million will be paid in July 2008 if sales and profit targets are met.\n\nThe Pizza Pizza operating company will license the trademarks and other intellectual property from the income trust and pay a nine per cent royalty on system sales.\n\nTo help fund the deal, the trust plans to issue 2.6 million units at $9.15 each for a total of $23.8 million, and has lined up a credit facility co-led by Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank."
