        "text": "Chapter Preview\n\nTop\n\nIntroduction Of The Chapter\n\nFood production and modern food technologies, unfortunately, are not a public health problem. Food processing and extension of their shelf life contributed to the evolution, adaptation and increase in the number of humanity and a settled population (Ludwig DS, 2011, Wrangham R., 2013, Pollan M., 2013, Kutkina M.N., Eliseeva S.A., 2018).\n\nThe need to increase food production has led to the mechanization of food production processes. Already from the middle of the 19th century, the mass production of some food products, such as bread, cookies, cakes, pies, sauces and meat products is marked. This was accompanied by a steady shift in emphasis in the habitual (traditional) diets of the population.\n\nIn the 20th century, standardized and unified technologies led to an increase in the production of cheaper foods with a high content of fat and sugar. The consumption of such products provoked an increase in the growth of cardiovascular diseases, first in high-income countries and then throughout the world (Omran AR., 1971, Popkin BM, 1993).\n\nResearch in the field of food sciences in general, from the 1970s to the 1980s, was aimed at creating and expanding the range of products with a long shelf life without special conditions produced from cheap ingredients and food additives. The global development of production of such products, their worldwide distribution and intense consumption has led to a sharp increase in obesity and related noncommunicable diseases (diabetes), first in high- and middle-income countries (Popkin BM, 2002), and then in countries with low income (Popkin BM, 2013).Food supplies are now becoming part of the global food system, in which ready-to-eat processed products are increasingly dominant (FAO, 2004, Stuckler D.et al, 2012, Monteiro CA.et al, 2012, McDonald's Corporation, 2019).\n\nThe traditional perception of the term “fast food” is restaurants, cafes and other fast food enterprises, however, the concept of fast food in modern times should be considered much more broadly."
