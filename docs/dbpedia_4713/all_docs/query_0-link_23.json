        "text": "Let the conversation begin: It’s simply not possible to put together a list of the 100 best restaurants and please everyone.\n\nThis list was a year in the making. Just days after wrapping up the last survey, we wiped the slate clean (nobody in the top 100 has a sinecure) and started over, combing the region in search of deliciousness—feasting on foie gras, munching on pizza. More than 350 diner’s report cards and some added pounds later, we came up with what we believe to be the area’s 100 best right now.\n\nWhat were we looking for? Not just good cooking but memorable cooking that communicates a sense of place or personal expression. Not just good service—is the server there when needed?—but the feeling of being pampered.\n\nDecor? Ambience? They’re not as important as some might think. Ambience can enhance an experience, but in our book it’s no substitute for really good dining.\n\nSo here’s to a new year of memorable meals. May our list be a trusty companion on your dining-out excursions, and may you find deliciousness wherever you go.\n\n100. 3 Bar & Grill ★★\n\n2950 Clarendon Blvd., Arlington; 703-524-4440\n\nCuisine: Brian Robinson oversees an appealing roster of upmarket pub grub (chips with house-cured bacon, mussels steamed in beer) and rib-sticking Southern staples (collard greens, scallops with grits and ham). The cooking is more sophisticated than it reads, but the owners—who also operate the popular bar Whitlow’s on Wilson down the block—keep the mood loose.\n\nMood: Clarendon/Courthouse yuppies flock to the Art Deco–accented dining room for comfort food in a dressed-up setting.\n\nBest for: A filling meal on a budget; drinks and appetizers on the patio.\n\nBest dishes: Fried oysters with cornmeal crust; shredded duck with pickled cucumbers, bourbon molasses, and lettuce leaves for rolling (Vietnam meets the American South); chicken and waffles; pork shank in a smoky stew of beans and chickpeas; Hawaiian malasada doughnuts with dark-chocolate/coffee dipping sauce.\n\nInsider tips: In winter, ask to sit in the ski-lodge-like room with a fireplace; in summer, the patio is the place to be. There’s a good weekday lunch deal: a soft drink and daily special for $10.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n99. Bibiana ★★\n\n1100 New York Ave., NW; 202-216-9550\n\nCuisine: Restaurateur Ashok Bajaj—having tried his hand at Modern American, cutting-edge American, traditional Indian, and Indian fusion—indulges his passion for Italian cooking with this elegant restaurant on the edge of Penn Quarter. His chef is Nicholas Stefanelli, most recently of Mio, who oversees a menu of salads, pastas, pizzas, and main courses and manages to balance the needs of his well-traveled diners for lightness with his desire to tweak tradition.\n\nMood: It’s no looker—from the garish appointments to the unrelenting tones of brown, the dining room seems to have been outfitted by the sort of furniture stores that supply the area’s McMansions. The early crowds—a mix of tourists, curiosity seekers, and diners with billable hours—don’t appear to mind and have given the place the buzz of a play on opening night.\n\nBest for: A client dinner.\n\nBest dishes: Oysters with lemon emulsion; tender veal meatballs with marinara; crisp-crusted pizza for one, capped with a runny egg and strips of lardo; braised veal cheeks with white polenta, wild mushrooms, and hazelnuts; a thick twirl of squid-ink spaghetti with good crabmeat; chocolate bomba, a half-moon of ganache-draped chocolate mousse with a hazelnut-mousse center; a superb tiramisu.\n\nInsider tips: The lounge offers a brief menu of small plates and pizza from 2:30 to 5:30 on weekdays.\n\nService: ••\n\nMonday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner. Expensive.\n\n98. Marvin ★★\n\n2007 14th St., NW; 202-797-7171\n\nCuisine: Late in life, soul legend and DC native Marvin Gaye found redemption in Ostend, Belgium, where he wrote his classic “Sexual Healing.” This upscale U Street tavern pays homage to Gaye’s beginning and end, combining the robustness of Belgian cooking with the directness of upscale soul food. The result? Pub grub of surprising finesse and power.\n\nMood: A large portrait of Gaye dominates the dimly lit dining room, which feels both cozy and festive.\n\nBest for: Hearty food before a night of U Street revelry; Belgian-beer enthusiasts; an early weeknight dinner.\n\nBest dishes: Seared foie gras over caramelized onions; sea scallops with braised leeks; Niçoise salad with ahi tuna; coconut-curry mussels or wine-and-shallot meunière mussels, both of which come with fries and three dipping sauces; chicken and waffles atop braised greens; seared halibut in beurre blanc; bacon-topped burger on a brioche bun.\n\nInsider tips: Reservations can be hard to come by on weekends. The inside bar upstairs can be noisy; the partially covered deck is great. Desserts remain the weak spot—if your sweet tooth beckons, head around the corner to Ben’s Chili Bowl for a post-meal milkshake.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n97. Pete’s New Haven Style Apizza ★★\n\n1400 Irving St., NW; 202-332-7383\n\nCuisine: The best pizza in DC. The New Haven–style pies sport wonderfully thin crusts—crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside—and spare, well-chosen toppings. Quality comes at a price: Whole pizzas are all one size—18 inches—and start at $19. Given how good the pies are, it’s easy to forget there are other options here, too, with pasta (spaghetti and meatballs), panini (a riff on an Italian sub), and seasonal antipasti (recently, sweet potatoes with cranberries).\n\nMood: Though slicker than most order-at-the-counter pizza shops—there are beautiful photographs of Italian street life, and food comes on ceramic plates—the space is refreshingly unpretentious and welcoming. Peak dinner hours bring a crush of families, shoppers, and hipsters in search of good pizza.\n\nBest for: A post-shopping slice; dinner with a group.\n\nBest dishes: Glorious, calzone-like Sorbillo’s, a turnover of soft dough stuffed with salty ricotta and cubed salumi; garlicky white-clam pie; a salt lover’s pie with anchovies, olives, and capers; a changing selection of antipasti, which has included black lentils with pickled celery root and bacon, fingerling-potato confit with anchovy dressing, and roasted beets with walnuts and Gorgonzola.\n\nInsider tips: There’s now delivery in a limited zone that includes neighborhoods north of Dupont Circle to Brightwood, and pizza arrives in tip-top shape. For added crispness, you can reheat slices in a hot, non-oiled sauté pan for a minute or two. At happy hour, Monday through Friday 4 to 6:30, a pint of Moretti beer and a slice of cheese pizza are $5.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Inexpensive.\n\n96. Acadiana ★★\n\n901 New York Ave., NW; 202-408-8848\n\nCuisine: The buttery biscuits that land on the table at the start of every meal amount to a declaration: This is no place for calorie counters. And it only gets better—or worse—from there. Jeff Tunks has fashioned a rich excursion into down-home “Looziana” cooking, from New Orleans–style barbecue shrimp to classic seafood gumbo to oyster po’ boys. If the menu says something is served with warm French bread, chances are there’s a buttery sauce to be mopped up with it.\n\nMood: For all the decadence, the dining room is almost matronly—with tall, tapestried booths, oversize chandeliers, and decorative urns. But that hasn’t kept it from becoming a power spot.\n\nBest for: Louisiana expats and anyone who craves Mardi Gras–like decadence and traditional Louisiana cocktails—with all the customary kick.\n\nBest dishes: Trio of deviled eggs with toppings such as ham, crab, and shrimp; seafood gumbo; roast duck over smoky greens; barbecue shrimp; shrimp and oyster po’ boys (lunch only); chocolate doberge cake; Pimm’s Cup cocktail.\n\nInsider tips: Deals here include a $29 three-course pre-theater menu from 5:30 to 6:30 daily, half-price wines on Sunday, and bar specials on drinks and nibbles during happy hours and Sunday football games.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n95. Equinox ★★\n\n818 Connecticut Ave., NW; 202-331-8118\n\nCuisine: Local-eating pioneer Todd Gray crafts carefully chosen ingredients into dishes that honor Italy and France and sometimes the Chesapeake. When the kitchen is on, it can be very good, but basic mistakes (gritty scallops, cold entrées) can get in the way of Gray’s vision. Former Maestro pastry chef Tom Wellings recently joined the kitchen, and his desserts are a highlight.\n\nMood: There are plenty of big-spending regulars schmoozing away—often with Gray, who makes the dining-room rounds—at this serene power haunt near the White House. (The Obamas dined there just before the inauguration.) The front dining room is a see-and-be-seen fishbowl; the taupe-painted back room is more date-friendly and low-key.\n\nBest for: Lunchtime dealmaking; expense-account dinners.\n\nBest dishes: A potted spread of rich foie gras slicked with quince gelée; cobia, a meaty white fish, with creamy grits and spinach; grilled beef strip loin in sweet Cabernet jus with a day-braised short rib; a cast-iron pot of truffled mac and cheese; ultra-light ricotta fritters; a layered panna cotta with foamed cider and sautéed apples.\n\nInsider tips: Gray was trained at DC’s Galileo, and he excels at dishes bearing an Italian bent. He’s also skilled at regional classics—nobody does summer soft-shells as well as he does.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for dinner. Very expensive.\n\n94. Et Voila! ★★\n\n5120 MacArthur Blvd., NW; 202-237-2300\n\nCuisine: Sturdy Belgian bistro classics, generous pours from French boutique wineries, a well-chosen Belgian beer roster, and a short menu of wonderful desserts—many of them centered around Callebaut chocolate—make chef/owners Claudio Pirollo and Mickael Cornu’s restaurant one that would be welcome in any neighborhood.\n\nMood: The modish space could fit right into the bustling bistro scene in Brussels—ivory and orange walls and clear wall panels embedded with grasses and leaves.\n\nBest for: A relaxed meal with friends or a significant other.\n\nBest dishes: Any of the carefully dressed salads, but especially the chopped endive with Chimay cheese and pecans; silken gravlax with crème fraîche and a wedge of olive-oil pancake; a robust carbonnade à la flamande (a kind of beef stew) spiked with dark beer; a flavorful organic Meyer-beef burger with Chimay and bacon; crisp golden fries; a standout chocolate mousse; Belgian waffle with poached pear and dark chocolate.\n\nInsider tips: As good as many plates are, there are some disappointments—the hanger steak and moules with garlic and white wine being two. The owners recently introduced a menu of savory and sweet crepes at brunch, and the early results are promising; we like a version with ham, cheese, and egg.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday for dinner, Tuesday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n93. Cedar ★★\n\n822 E St., NW; 202-637-0012\n\nCuisine: At this Penn Quarter newcomer, chef Andrew Kitko’s Modern American menu offers just a handful of appetizers and entrées, forgoing the chance to dazzle diners with elaborate dish descriptions and instead emphasizing his commitment to execution. Simple though his dishes are, many are elevated by house-made touches such as duck bacon and pickled figs.\n\nMood: The contemporary dining room evokes the Pacific Northwest with wood-trimmed walls and photos of giant cedars. A friendly staff and soft lighting keep the small, subterranean dining room from feeling like a basement.\n\nBest for: Happy hour, when there are $5 deals on beer, wine, and cocktails; brunch; an after-work dinner with office pals.\n\nBest dishes: Creamy oyster pan roast with leeks and Jerusalem artichokes; beet salad with pickled figs and goat-cheese fondue; pork-belly BLT (lunch and brunch) and smoked-salmon eggs Benedict (brunch); poached lobster atop a sort of deconstructed clam chowder; filet mignon with potato-porcini gratin and roasted carrots; trumpet mushrooms and poached egg over lentils; pumpkin-pecan tart; apple-almond brown-butter cake; Red Burro cocktail with ginger beer and blackberry purée.\n\nInsider tips: The bar is small, but the bartenders are friendly and eager to whip up special requests.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for brunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch. Expensive.\n\n92. Faryab ★★\n\n4917 Cordell Ave., Bethesda; 301-951-3484\n\nCuisine: Subtle spicing and assured cooking—from vegetable stews to open-faced meat-and-leek-filled dumplings—set a high standard for the area’s Afghan restaurants.\n\nMood: Afghan textiles and rugs give the white-walled space a gallery-like feel, but when tables fills up, conversation can get lively, transforming one of Bethesda’s most intimate hideaways into a convivial party.\n\nBest for: Families and groups who enjoy sharing; vegetarians.\n\nBest dishes: Fried appetizer pastries such as bulanee (with leeks) and sambosa (with meat and chickpeas); open-faced dumplings known as mantu (with meat) and aushak (with scallions), blanketed with creamy yogurt and meat sauce; quabili pallow, a fragrant heap of brown basmati rice studded with carrots, raisins, and braised lamb; stewed pumpkin with yogurt sauce; melting eggplant; spinach with onion and garlic.\n\nInsider tips: Several dishes are finished with dabs of tomatoey meat sauce and yogurt, which can make for a meal of redundancies; mix it up when ordering. Desserts are not a high point.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Tuesday through Sunday for dinner. Inexpensive.\n\n91. Heritage India ★★\n\n2400 Wisconsin Ave., NW; 202-333-3120\n\nCuisine: Opulent Indian. The curries are lush, the flatbreads are hot and flaky, and dishes seldom seen at quick-serve joints that gloss over the subtlety and variety of this complex cooking find their way into the mix.\n\nMood: With carved wooden screens, British Colonial furnishings, and vintage sepia photos of Indian princes, the main dining room channels the days of the Raj.\n\nBest for: A communal meal with a group, the better to order widely and experience the myriad styles of Indian cooking; a romantic dinner; a vegetarian meal full of conviction.\n\nBest dishes: Bhel puri, an Indian-style salad with puffed rice, chickpea vermicelli, cilantro, shallots, and sweet-and-sour chutney; eggplant in a velvety sesame-cashew sauce; black lentils elevated to star status with cream and butter; yakhani gosht, a Kashmiri lamb stew with yogurt and saffron; prawns in green-pepper sauce; a ginger-shot sag paneer, the classic cheese-and-spinach dish; first-rate flatbreads.\n\nInsider tips: While service is friendlier than in the past, the restaurant sometimes seems short-staffed, a situation that’s underscored when it’s crowded. Ask for a table in the dining room overlooking Wisconsin Avenue, preferably by the window.\n\nService: •½\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n90. Assaggi ★★\n\n4838 Bethesda Ave., Bethesda; 301-951-1988\n\nCuisine: The mozzarella bar might intrigue curiosity seekers, but the real draw is chef/owner Domenico Cornacchia’s cooking. It pulls from many regions of his homeland but rings truest when he draws from the stick-to-your-ribs, tomato-based dishes of central Italy. And he’s a whiz with pasta.\n\nMood: The open dining room channels the buzz of a DC hot spot, right down to the glimpse of the chef intently finishing dishes in the open kitchen.\n\nBest for: A family-style meal for groups who like to share—the staff is happy to bring plenty of plates.\n\nBest dishes: Burrata cheese with condiments of pesto eggplant, tomato marmalade, and roasted red peppers; salumi; fritto misto; tiny clams in a broth with toasted Israeli-couscous-like pasta; a vinegary kale-and-escarole salad; gnocchi topped with veal-short-rib ragu and pungent caciocavallo-cheese sauce; pasta with blue crab and spicy tomato sauce; zeppole, sugared batons of fried dough with zabaglione dip; raspberry-and-white-chocolate cake.\n\nInsider tips: Specials include a $14 two-course lunch and a 15-percent discount on dinner checks daily between 4 and 6.\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n89. Montmartre ★★\n\n327 Seventh St., SE; 202-544-1244\n\nCuisine: Mussels, steak frites, country pâté—rear-guard staples of the Parisian bistro scene—dominate the menu at this likable, dependable Eastern Market hot spot, but there’s an occasional nontraditional special or two.\n\nMood: A loud, clangy place that packs customers in so tightly you could pluck a fry off your neighbor’s table. In other words, a real bistro where you’ll find Le Chat Noir posters, not a celebrity chef.\n\nBest for: A budget date; a raucous, wine-soaked dinner with friends.\n\nBest dishes: Mussels with chorizo or shallots and cream; duck pâté with Armagnac (a special); braised rabbit with buttery linguine; hanger steak in a richly reduced red-wine sauce; floating island, a meringue surrounded by crème anglaise; crème brûlée; fruit tarts.\n\nInsider tips: Brunch, so often an afterthought, gets respect here.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Tuesday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n88. Art and Soul ★★\n\nLiaison Capitol Hill, 415 New Jersey Ave., NW; 202-393-7777\n\nCuisine: Chicago celebrity chef Art Smith—formerly of Oprah Winfrey’s home kitchen—and his local deputy, Travis Timberlake, serve up feel-good food. Their renditions of classic Southern fare are both gussied up (an oyster po’ boy turned into a hoecake) and faithful (simple fried chicken with white gravy).\n\nMood: It might look like a retro-chandeliered hotel restaurant (and you’ll see many a rolling suitcase) but looming portraits of Martin Luther King Jr. and Dwight Eisenhower—and perhaps a Nancy Pelosi sighting—remind you that you’re dining just steps from the seat of power.\n\nBest for: A crowd-pleasing dinner with a big group; a gut-busting power lunch; snacking at the bar; weekend brunch (oh, the lemon pancakes).\n\nBest dishes: Chesapeake Bay fry, a Southern take on fritto misto with oysters, hushpuppies, okra, and shrimp; arugula salad with blackberry vinaigrette and watermelon pickles; hoecakes (pancake-like rounds made with cornmeal) topped with either fried oysters and rémoulade, apples and blue cheese, or pulled pork and slaw; a wedge of buttery-crusted onion pie slathered with goat cheese; lunchtime fried chicken, boneless and wonderfully juicy; pecan-crusted chicken; crisply fried trout drizzled with rhubarb vinaigrette; spiced quince trifle; “baby cakes,” an ever-changing quintet of mini cupcakes.\n\nInsider tips: A budget-friendly Sunday supper features the fried chicken plus two sides for $18.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for breakfast, brunch, and dinner. Expensive.\n\n87. Grapeseed ★★\n\n4865 Cordell Ave., Bethesda; 301-986-9592\n\nCuisine: This wine bar/restaurant pairs whimsical-but-not-cutesy fare with sips from around the globe. The nearly 500 wines, $6 to $20 by the glass, are also available in inexpensive tasting portions.\n\nMood: Although there’s plenty of goblet swirling and chatter about the subtleties of, say, the cellar’s 37 Pinot Noirs, the blond-wood restaurant doesn’t feel pretentious. One category on the wine list is “kinda sweet, sorta dry.”\n\nBest for: Wine flights with friends; casual dates that still feel special.\n\nBest dishes: Roasted piquillo pepper oozing goat cheese; fried oysters swabbed in bacony beurre blanc; ultra-rich mushroom fricassee; sauté of calamari with chorizo and lemon; lobster in spicy-sweet Vietnamese-style caramel sauce; roasted balsamic chicken.\n\nInsider tips: Lunch specials abound. Tuesday through Friday there are three $6 shrimp specials plus a special of $12 for two courses chosen from the regular menu.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday and Saturday for dinner, Tuesday through Friday for lunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n86. Circle Bistro ★★\n\n1 Washington Cir., NW; 202-293-5390\n\nCuisine: After a rocky year, the kitchen seems to have stabilized with the arrival of Ethan McKee, a veteran of Equinox and Rock Creek at Mazza, whose French- and Mediterranean-influenced American menu runs to plates such as wild Alaskan halibut with chorizo, Swiss chard, and saffron butter.\n\nMood: Deciding where to sit can be hard. Will it be the teeming lounge, where you can nibble on snacks such as fries with fines herbes mayonnaise, or the conversation-friendly dining room done in shades of orange, yellow, and cream?\n\nBest for: The Kennedy Center–bound—there’s a $35, three-course pre-theater meal from 5 to 7.\n\nBest dishes: Crisp potato-crusted oysters with bacon-chive crème fraîche; roasted-beet salad with arugula and walnut vinaigrette; lamb rib eye with ratatouille and olive tapenade; duck with celery root, spinach, crispy leeks, and orange; a deconstructed brownie sundae including a dense, fudgy wedge of cake, house-made espresso ice cream, and candied walnuts.\n\nInsider tips: There are lots of deals, including half-price cocktails, beer, and wine at the bar Monday through Friday from 4:30 to 7:30 and free bottomless mimosas at Sunday brunch.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Saturday for breakfast and dinner, Sunday for breakfast, brunch, and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n85. Villa Mozart ★★\n\n4009 Chain Bridge Rd., Fairfax; 703-691-4747\n\nCuisine: Chef/owner Andrea Pace anchors his dishes with familiar Northern Italian flavors—prosciutto with melon, eggplant lasagna—but elevates them with unexpected accents. When he’s successful, which is often enough (chocolate pappardelle with wild boar), the result feels fresh; when he’s not (a caprese salad with buffalo-milk foam), it feels forced.\n\nMood: Long on charm, this cozy but contemporary townhouse is a prime destination for date nights. Each table is adorned with fresh red roses, and the Italian arias soaring through the dining room set the mood for an evening of romance.\n\nBest for: An old-fashioned date.\n\nBest dishes: Wide bands of smoked prosciutto sharing the plate with hemispheres of sweet cantaloupe; coins of eggplant and zucchini stacked with pungent Taleggio; a dressed-up “meat and potatoes” with lamb two ways (roasted shoulder, grilled rack) and a cube of potato mille foglie; delicately poached halibut filet in a comforting but light mushroom-based broth with white beans and artichokes; chocolate soufflé, cracked and filled with Grand Marnier sauce at the table.\n\nInsider tips: The wine list is small, but the corkage fee for bringing your own bottle is just $25—cheaper than almost anything else on the menu.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner. Expensive.\n\n84. Hell Point Seafood ★★\n\n12 Dock St., Annapolis; 410-990-9888\n\nCuisine: Bob Kinkead calls his Annapolis waterfront operation Kinkead Lite—a more casual, streamlined, and affordable version of his DC seafood emporium. The kitchen early on was a work in progress but has found its groove. Portions are bigger, execution is tighter, and the familiar-looking plates of mussels, oysters, lobster rolls, and smothered fish are now worthy of the Kinkead name.\n\nMood: The redeeming feature of the bland space, which for years housed Phillips Seafood, is the gorgeous view of the Annapolis harbor—seats along the glass windows fill up fast.\n\nBest for: That rarest of dining-out pleasures—a good meal with a view.\n\nBest dishes: Sweet mussels in green Thai curry with diced squash; an ever-changing roster of oysters on the half shell; plump, minimally bound crabcakes; cornmeal-crusted flounder in a creamy sauce garnished with tasso ham, mushroom matchsticks, and baby shrimp; swordfish steak with confit of basil-draped baby tomatoes; excellent seasonal tarts (peach in summer, pear in fall, apple in winter); elegant, Eastern Shore–style caramel layer cake.\n\nInsider tips: Think seafood calls exclusively for white wine? Think again: The important thing is to complement the sauce or accompaniment, and the embellishments for Kinkead’s seafood are generally big and bold-flavored. Accordingly, there are red-wine by-the-glass picks that pair well with the restaurant’s catches of the day, including a rosé made from Malbec. And servers will pour a taste of any by-the-glass wine.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Tuesday through Sunday for lunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n83. Passage to India ★★\n\n4931 Cordell Ave., Bethesda; 301-656-3373\n\nCuisine: Chef/owner Sudhir Seth tackles his native India’s every culinary corner on his menu, which ranges far beyond commonplace curries and tandoori meats. With an impressive level of accuracy and consistency, he conveys the flavors of not just the familiar north (with its reliance on kebabs) and south (with its breads and veggie stews) but also the east and west.\n\nMood: The low-lit dining room, with elaborate wood carvings and photographs of Indian palaces, is a throwback in an age of clean-lined, bustling spaces: quiet, serious, almost serene. Waiters in jackets and bow ties tend to their tables with a military-like precision.\n\nBest for: Anyone willing to venture beyond the safe ground of butter chicken; anyone seeking an oasis of calm to dine in.\n\nBest dishes: Sev-murmura chaat, a mash-up of puffed rice, vermicelli, and dates, sweetened with tamarind; a potato-stuffed samosa dressed up with chickpeas and yogurt; juicy, thin slices of lamb cooked in the tandoor oven; shrimp in a coconut-based curry with coriander and garlic; a marvelous pickle plate; a dessert of fresh mango peeking out from a blanket of cardamom-spiked yogurt.\n\nInsider tips: If you want to sample some of Seth’s complex and layered cooking but are on a budget, come at lunchtime. Main courses arrive with a side of lentils, rice, and a salad—all for about $10.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n82. Jackie’s ★★\n\n8081 Georgia Ave., Silver Spring; 301-565-9700\n\nCuisine: If restaurants were people, this would be the hearty partyer who hunkers down with Wittgenstein in his spare time: playful but with a serious side. That side—evident in the fine stemware, thoughtfully composed salads, and detailed riffs on American comfort food—transforms what otherwise might be a convivial night of fun into a minor gastronomic outing.\n\nMood: The dining room—all exposed beams, dangling light bulbs, hot-pink pillows, and sculpted plastic chairs—is a masterpiece of retro chic. It’s framed by a bar with a drop-down projection-screen TV and an open kitchen, and it crackles with an energy rare in fine dining.\n\nBest for: Dining out without getting dolled up—or having to leave the kids at home.\n\nBest dishes: Butter lettuce with anchovy dressing and aged sheep’s-milk cheese; Prince Edward Island mussels in a Madras curry broth with lime jelly and cilantro; pan-seared swordfish with shrimp butter; pimiento-topped “Elvis” burger; Hudson Valley duck leg with duck sausage; a roast of braised pork, house-made sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, and hominy stew.\n\nInsider tips: Frank Morales, who previously manned the stove at Rustico, has recently come aboard to run the show. The streamlined menu is a little less zippy, and Morales is given at times to overproducing his dishes, but the Elvis burger is better (and bigger) than ever and the cheese grits are otherworldly.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for dinner (cafe menu on Monday), Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n81. Hook ★★\n\n3241 M St., NW; 202-625-4488\n\nCuisine: Chef Jonathan Seningen turns out an ever-changing, all-over-the-map roster of seafood that encompasses the au courant (a crudo of mahi mahi with pickled jalapeño) and the enduring (fish and chips). Meat lovers might want to look elsewhere—there’s only one non-fish entrée on the menu—but seafood fanciers will smile. Every fish is sustainably caught; think Arctic char, not Atlantic salmon.\n\nMood: The softly lit, minimalist dining room has turned into something of a weeknight clubhouse for Georgetown couples and families. On weekends, tables are filled by a snappily dressed crowd of thirtysomethings and internationals.\n\nBest for: A quiet date or dinner; brunch.\n\nBest dishes: The menu changes daily, but look for a trio of smoked fishes—salmon, mackerel, and bluefish; oysters three ways; beet salad with pistachios and goat cheese; gingery tuna tartare; tempura-fried pufferfish with piquant cilantro sauce for dipping; whole grilled Greek dorade with olives and chimichurri; lingonberry linzertorte with Taleggio ice cream; butterscotch tart.\n\nInsider tips: Pastry chef Heather Chittum is a top talent; even if you’re not having a meal, you can graze on her sweets at the bar.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday for dinner, Tuesday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n80. Brasserie Beck ★★\n\n1101 K St., NW; 202-408-1717\n\nCuisine: Vegetarians and believers in portion control will find little to like about this buzzing den of immoderation, perhaps the finest of the area’s growing contingent of Belgian-inspired restaurants. Chef Robert Wiedmaier’s menu abounds in burly servings of beef stews, lamb sausages, and roasted rabbit—even salads sport bits of pork. Just as hearty is the Belgian-dominated beer list that’s as thick as a novel and closely managed by a suds sommelier.\n\nMood: A gleaming open kitchen is the backdrop for a frenetic dining room, where cooler-than-thou servers cater to hungry beer lovers and celebratory groups, while gaggles of young professionals swarm the granite bar at happy hour. In summer, try the patio for a quieter scene.\n\nBest for: Celebrating with a large group—you don’t have to worry about being too loud, and dishes are easy to share.\n\nBest dishes: Buttery lentils supporting a house-made lamb sausage; triple-fried frites, herb-dusted and served with three mayos; garlic-happy mushrooms and spaetzle with a crunchy baguette slice and a warm poached egg; coq au vin, liberally scattered with bits of bacon; fried-parsley-flecked snails; a soufflé-like black-currant-and-fig clafoutis.\n\nInsider tips: Resist the allure of the steamed mussels—more-flavorful pots are to be found elsewhere. Instead, splurge for Wiedmaier’s house-made charcuterie.\n\nService: •½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n79. Etete ★★\n\n1942 Ninth St., NW; 202-232-7600\n\nCuisine: Ethiopian is among the great strengths of Washington’s ethnic-dining landscape, with restaurants, bars, groceries, and even bakeries dotting the scene. This family-run operation remains the best spot to dig into the complex, spice-laden stews, called wats, that form the backbone of the cuisine. Tiwaltengus Shenegelgn, who runs the kitchen, is a star in the local community, and no wonder: Her cooking is the most refined, with clear flavors and a lingering depth in her saucing.\n\nMood: The coziness and sophistication call to mind a contemporary urban cafe, and the multicultural crowd, sipping cocktails and sharing platters of stews, reinforces the relaxed vibe.\n\nBest for: A cheap and sustaining meal before or after a concert or outing on U Street; a big gathering with friends (particularly if the group includes vegetarians).\n\nBest dishes: Sambusas, crisp, three-cornered pastries filled with spiced beef or lentils; yebeg wat and doro wat, the former made up of sliced lamb, the latter involving a leg of chicken and a hard-boiled egg, and both of them buried in the same thick, spicy, brick-red sauce; a vegetarian platter with azifa (brown lentils with Ethiopian mustard), kik alicha (a creamy, yellow-lentil stew), and yemisir wat (spiced red lentils).\n\nInsider tips: The coffee ceremony, which takes place in the afternoon, is a treat, featuring strong, dark brews, bowls of popcorn, and the smell of incense—a chance to take a moment, slow down, and breathe.\n\nService: •½\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Inexpensive.\n\n78. Eventide ★★½\n\n3165 Wilson Blvd., Arlington; 703-276-3165\n\nCuisine: Chef Miles Vaden’s ambitious Clarendon kitchen doesn’t produce anything too out-there, but his Modern American cooking is full of surprises. A classic tartare is made from bison, sweetbreads are rolled in oats, and octopus comes not grilled but marinated, escabeche style.\n\nMood: You might expect a crowd out of Twilight in this soaring, Goth-chic dining room. But under the black chandeliers sit casual families, empty-nesters, and smartly turned-out young professionals.\n\nBest for: Bar snacks in the downstairs lounge or, in the summer, on the roof; dinner dates.\n\nBest dishes: Grilled-pear salad with blue-cheese flan; octopus with olives and mashed chickpeas; Arctic char over spaghetti squash and spicy-tangy rémoulade; duck with foie gras butter and lush polenta cake.\n\nInsider tips: Virginia permits unfinished bottles of wine to be taken home, and the restaurant provides wine “doggie bags.”\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen Tuesday through Saturday for dinner, Sunday for brunch. Expensive.\n\n77. Addie’s ★★½\n\n11120 Rockville Pike, Rockville; 301-881-0081\n\nCuisine: What’s come out of the kitchen at Jeff and Barbara Black’s folksy first restaurant can best be described as uneven. But now it’s a different story with Nate Waugaman behind the stove. Gone are the scattered attempts at fusion fare, and in its place are house-made charcuterie (plus a whole lot of excellent Benton’s ham from Kentucky) and rootedly American roasts and fish dishes. Finally, the food has one personality, not 15.\n\nMood: Driving past strip mall after strip mall, you might miss this creaky, sunshine-yellow Victorian set back in the trees. (Look for the diner-like neon let’s eat sign.) Inside the tiny dining rooms, funky charm abounds, with cheerful young servers and side tables made from antique ovens.\n\nBest for: Lunch or dinner after hitting White Flint Mall; families (although the place can get very loud); satisfying a case of small-town nostalgia.\n\nBest dishes: Charcuterie, including lomo, peppery soppresatta, rustic rabbit pâté, and a wonderful pumpkin marmalade; fried green tomatoes stuffed with goat cheese; artfully presented beet carpaccio over rounds of ashy goat cheese; fried oysters with lemon and chopped egg; grilled trout with brown-butter vinaigrette; rustic vegetable lasagna; in the summer, a fabulous mixed-bean salad with ham.\n\nInsider tips: Don’t be hesitant to make a meal out of the generous appetizers—they tend to outshine the entrées.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for dinner. Moderate.\n\n76. Black’s Bar and Kitchen ★★½\n\n7750 Woodmont Ave., Bethesda; 301-652-5525\n\nCuisine: You never quite know what you’ll find at Jeff and Barbara Black’s Zen-slick suburban dining room. Sure, there will always be the solid raw bar and reliable wood-fired steaks and seafood. But beyond that, the ever-changing menu might skitter from fried chicken and waffles to white-bean-and-prosciutto bruschetta to plantain-crusted shrimp with mango salsa.\n\nMood: With its twinkling pool out front and mood-lit dining room inside, Black’s stands out among its neighboring chain restaurants. It’s the closest Bethesda gets to a Malibu brand of chicness and, not surprisingly, has become a magnet for expensively groomed thirtysomethings with a taste for $10 Dark and Stormys. But it’s not all see-and-be-seen: Look beneath the arty mural of a vineyard and you’ll see plenty of casual families and empty-nesters.\n\nBest for: An oyster craving; happy hour; a date or catch-up with friends; late-night dessert.\n\nBest dishes: Squares of airy cornbread with honey butter; mussels with tomato, lemon, and shallot; well-shucked oysters on the half shell (we lean toward the West Coast varieties); hanger steak with chimichurri or béarnaise; fried chicken with pecans and sweet-potato waffles; a spicy, saffron-scented stew packed with mussels, prawns, and other seafood and served with aïoli-slathered toasts; salty-caramel trio (with a dreamy caramel tart); Key-lime pie.\n\nInsider tips: The blond-wood bar room is an equally comfortable place to sit, especially in the booths for two. Happy-hour specials abound, with early- and late-night deals. Sunday is half-price wine-bottle night.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n75. Liberty Tavern ★★½\n\n3195 Wilson Blvd., Arlington; 703-465-9360\n\nCuisine: Robust American comfort cooking with Italian accents. Much is made in-house, from the sweet rolls in the bread basket to the egg noodles on the pasta menu to the marshmallow atop an upscale take on s’mores. Note to the waist-conscious: Nearly every dish celebrates duck fat, bacon, butter, or cheese, and portions are hearty.\n\nMood: The walk-in-friendly Clarendon restaurant has a split personality. The loud downstairs bar swarms with young people noshing on grilled cheeses and drinking up a storm. The second-floor dining room, with its cozy striped banquettes and open kitchen, feels more civilized.\n\nBest for: A casual date or pizza with friends downstairs, a quieter meal upstairs.\n\nBest dishes: Arctic char, smoked in-house and folded over johnnycakes; apple-and-endive salad, heavy on the blue cheese and bacon; fiery fra diavolo macaroni with fresh lobster; autumnal gnocchi with celery root and blue cheese; Vermont pizza with white cheddar and apples; skirt steak covered in tangy steak sauce; schnitzel-style skate, its richness cut with lingonberry sauce; homey roasted half chicken with lemon marmalade; light but decadent Black Forest cake; s’mores pot de crème; Masonic cocktail, a citrusy take on a mint julep.\n\nInsider tips: Liberty is among the better takeout options in the area, particularly for a fine-dining establishment—a dedicated window in the back of the restaurant makes it convenient.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday for dinner, Tuesday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n74. Potenza ★★½\n\n1430 H St., NW; 202-638-4444\n\nCuisine: DC has no Little Italy, and its best Italian restaurants have long been tasteful spots for expense accounts or luxe destinations for foodies. This newcomer thus represents a bold departure—an unassuming, big-hearted place where you can dunk your bread into your red sauce, a pizza can constitute the basis for a meal, and glasses of wine come in tumblers.\n\nMood: One part Carnegie Deli, one part Little Italy: a loud, sometimes chaotic space that practically demands you raise your voice to be heard and where flagging down your waiter is sometimes as tough as hailing a cab at rush hour. But there’s warmth, too, and the sight of diners heartily digging in is a welcome sight.\n\nBest for: A come-as-you-are night of pretense-free Italian indulgence.\n\nBest dishes: Rigatoni With Sunday Gravy, the very definition of red-sauce Italian; pappardelle with red Bolognese; a plate of gnocchi in a Gorgonzola cream sauce that steers clear of overrichness and is garnished with toasted walnuts; a lightly fried, almost delicate pork Milanese; the Salame Picante, the best of the surprisingly good, crisp-crusted pizzas; the best cannoli in the area; a perfect-textured lemon panna cotta; gorgeous bombolini (Italian doughnuts) with a side of jelly.\n\nInsider tips: Don’t skimp on bread; the loaves come from the adjoining bakery and are among the highlights of eating here. But also try to back-load your meal, saving room for the simple and generally wonderful desserts.\n\nService: •½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n73. BlackSalt ★★½\n\n4883 MacArthur Blvd., NW; 202-342-9101\n\nCuisine: Of all the restaurants in Jeff and Barbara Black’s local empire, this fishhouse is the most polished and most expensive. But the premise is wonderfully simple: an ever-changing roster of often rustic dishes built around well-sourced seafood and fish, from Maryland rockfish to Japanese hamachi.\n\nMood: A tidy fish market fronts the restaurant: A stainless-steel-accented bar/cafe is the casual counterpart to the bistro next to the glass-walled kitchen in back. The spaces share tight quarters, a menu, and—when the place is full—lots of energy.\n\nBest for: Seafood lovers who don’t want precious preparations of raw fish.\n\nBest dishes: Sweet Nantucket bay scallops atop a zesty puttanesca; a many-splendored salad of bitter escarole, sweet candied almonds, salty bacon, and tart apples; creamy chowder with crisp fried clams; steamed mussels with chorizo and tomato sauce; tart Key-lime pie; butterscotch pudding with a Scotch milkshake.\n\nInsider tips: You can easily make a meal from a couple of happy-hour-menu small plates and $5 Champagne cocktails, available daily from 4 to 7 in the bar and cafe. You can order one of pastry chef Susan Wallace’s seasonal fruit streusels from the market up front.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n72. PassionFish ★★½\n\n11960 Democracy Dr., Reston; 703-230-3474\n\nCuisine: It’s easy to look at this slick, bustling operation as a corporate seafood house in a Reston shopping center, but chef/owner Jeff Tunks’s kitchen makes a genuine effort to stock local produce and sustainable fishes for executive chef Chris Clime’s globally inspired dishes—from a simple bucket of fried clams to Peruvian ceviche.\n\nMood: The raw-bar items laid out on ice near the kitchen set a tone of authenticity, and the room has the buzz of a fishmonger’s stall. Because the space expands vertically, there’s not a bad seat in the house—all diners can enjoy views of the first-floor action, though things are slightly more subdued in the upstairs gallery.\n\nBest for: A night of downtown sophistication for Virginians—without the traffic or the long drive home from DC.\n\nBest dishes: Clams casino; fried clams; hamachi crudo with grapefruit and jalapeño; eight-piece “kamikaze roll” of tempura prawns, avocado, and spicy tuna; red Thai curry lobster; honest, lightly bound crabcakes; whole-roasted branzino; freshly fried doughnut holes.\n\nInsider tips: A special kids’ menu is a welcome departure from the usual chicken-fingers kind of offering. Servers here know their wines—one of the chefs lives on a nearby vineyard—and will bring samples.\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner. Expensive.\n\n71. Present ★★½\n\n6678 Arlington Blvd., Falls Church; 703-531-1881\n\nCuisine: The New Age–sounding names of many of the dishes, together with the over-the-top presentations (fried shrimp dangling in an elegantly carved pineapple boat), suggests an operation founded on kitsch. But there’s plenty of steak to go with the sizzle: This energetic restaurant has emerged as one of the leaders of Vietnamese cooking, turning out dishes of complexity and refinement—dishes that, at their best, rival the efforts of non-family-style places that typically cost three times as much.\n\nMood: From the tinkling fountain to the lodge-like surround of wood, a serenity belies the expectation of most ethnic family-run restaurants, which tend to emphasize a stark efficiency and a minimum of atmosphere. Present aims to dazzle you, and not just on the plate.\n\nBest for: Special occasions on the cheap.\n\nBest dishes: A mouthwatering hash of clams served in a giant sesame shell; a spot-on preparation of bun, with grilled pork and shrimp, a nest of veggies and a twirl of vermicelli; any of the masterful soups, including the Sour Spicy Seafood; a tenderer-than-usual rendition of “shaky” beef called Cow on the Open Field, tossed in a complex and zingy sauce; the best banh xeo, or stuffed crepe, in the area.\n\nInsider tips: Many of the dishes are large and best suited for sharing.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Inexpensive to moderate.\n\n70. Zentan ★★½\n\nDonovan House, 1155 14th St., NW; 202-379-4366\n\nCuisine: What Wolfgang Puck is to America, Susur Lee is to Canada—a culinary mastermind who fuses French techniques and Asian flavors into an exuberant brand. Lee—whose now-shuttered Lotus, in Toronto, was acclaimed as Canada’s best restaurant—was recruited to DC’s new Donovan House hotel after Todd English backed out, and his signature take on Asian fusion is on vibrant display: a Szechuan-style duck that pairs a confit-like bird with a stack of lotus pancakes; a mountainous slaw of 19 ingredients tossed tableside; a platter of dumplings concealed by a lacy pancake; and dazzling plates of unconventionally dressed nigiri and sashimi.\n\nMood: The hotel is owned by the fashionable Thompson Group, and the moodily lit dining room bears the hallmarks of that boutique chain: slick and garish and populated largely by businessmen dining alone and high rollers in search of a good time.\n\nBest for: Sushi. The freshness of the fish and the detail that goes into its preparation make this one of the area’s best spots for sashimi and nigiri.\n\nBest dishes: Singapore slaw; robust hot-and-sour soup; sashimi of scallop, yellowtail, mackerel, and fatty tuna; Brick Roll of spicy lobster, barbecue eel, and scallop; duck with lotus pancakes; crispy garlic chicken, a fine-dining take on the stir-fry classic; black cod with miso mustard; molten chocolate cake.\n\nInsider tips: Consider forgoing a main course and instead front-loading your meal. Some entrées rank among the most expensive in town, and the most successful meals here tend to be cobbled together from various parts of the menu: a soup, a salad, a couple of starters, and above all sushi.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Saturday for breakfast and dinner, Sunday for breakfast. Expensive.\n\n69. Sou’Wester ★★½\n\nMandarin Oriental, 1330 Maryland Ave., SW; 202-787-6868\n\nCuisine: Straightforward Southern cookery as seen through the eyes of one of the area’s most celebrated chefs, Eric Ziebold, and one of the world’s elite hotels, the Mandarin Oriental. From the expertly engineered biscuits and hushpuppies to the meticulously rendered grits and fried chicken, the mastery of detail is inescapable—you may come away marveling at the clarity of many of these dishes. It’s hard, too, not to wonder whether it was all necessary—whether down-home food really benefits from being so technically proficient.\n\nMood: The plate-glass window looks out onto the Southwest DC waterfront, but there the appeal of the multilevel room pretty much ends. This is as sterile as hotel dining gets (pouring a Miller into a Champagne glass seems as incongruous as grits and hushpuppies at the Mandarin Oriental), despite the few Southern-style touches on the table and the earnest efforts of the excellent staff.\n\nBest for: Those who crave unpretentious comfort food and who can put up with digging into it in a pretentious setting.\n\nBest dishes: Root-beer float with Jack Daniel’s; a remarkable, seemingly cream-free crab bisque; Rappahannock oysters with a house-made grilled sausage; the best hushpuppies you’ll ever eat, Sou’Wester’s inspired counterpart to the irresistible mini–Parker House rolls at CityZen; creamy yellow grits with a yolk-spilling poached egg and miniature bites of veal sweetbreads; juicy, well-seasoned pan-fried chicken; a filet of porgy with a rich crab imperial; banana cream pie.\n\nInsider tips: The hushpuppies, unlike a lot of hot, fried foods, hold up surprisingly well; order an extra round or two and take them home.\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n68. Sei ★★½\n\n444 Seventh St., NW; 202-783-7007\n\nCuisine: Asian/Latin fusion often seems sillier than Tom DeLay on Dancing With the Stars, but this Penn Quarter small-plates spot/sushi bar—a sister to nearby Oya—defies expectations. Dubious-sounding creations such as a fish-and-chips sushi roll and wasabi-jolted guacamole prove smart and satisfying.\n\nMood: With its white-on-white palette and mod wall of red branches, Sei makes a striking perch for the fashionistas and pretty young things who gather around the bar to sip Liquid Wasabi cocktails. The dining room tends to be just as loud but not as show-offy.\n\nBest for: A working lunch or pre-theater dinner; a big group of friends up for sharing small plates; creative and high-quality sushi.\n\nBest dishes: Steamed buns stuffed with hoisin-slicked pork; wasabi guacamole with wontons; Kobe-beef tataki dotted with jellied ponzu; fish-and-chips roll; Snow White roll with eel and roasted apple; traditional nigiri such as fatty tuna, fatty yellowtail, sweet shrimp, and sea urchin; lunchtime miso-glazed salmon burger on brioche.\n\nInsider tips: This is one of the town’s better sushi restaurants, and you can find traditionally cut fish amid all the funky rolls.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n67. Westend Bistro by Eric Ripert ★★½\n\nRitz-Carlton, 1190 22nd St., NW; 202-974-4900\n\nCuisine: This outpost of chef Eric Ripert’s empire benefits from the spending power of its peripatetic culinary master. Among the new wave of casually elegant restaurants to hit DC, this byline bistro has evolved and now speaks with a bit of a Southern accent, with fried okra and shrimp ’n’ grits joining salmon rillettes and tuna tartare.\n\nMood: The slick room fades into the background, making this a surprisingly versatile choice for special occasions, dates, and business meetings. It’s neither hushed nor lively but something in between.\n\nBest for: Happy hour at the U-shaped bar; dinner with friends, especially on the small patio in warmer months.\n\nBest dishes: A buttery tuna carpaccio sprinkled with chives; a pot of rich salmon rillettes; a homey shrimp-and-bean soup; macaroni and cheese with ham and toasted bread crumbs; a golden-crusted fish burger with saffron aïoli; a filet of wild striped bass with Asian spices.\n\nInsider tips: Desserts are a weak spot—the best of the recent bunch were the corn madeleines and the ginger parfait. And although the menu changes seasonally, the Web site fails to keep pace with those changes, making advance planning difficult.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for dinner. Expensive.\n\n66. PS 7’s ★★½\n\n777 I St., NW; 202-742-8550\n\nCuisine: Chef/owner Peter Smith might dabble in ragoûts and udon noodles, but his real passion lies in mining a deep vein of regional American cooking. He has the most fun with his lounge menu, which features upscale takes on Chicago-style hot dogs (everything made in-house) and the signature French-fry-topped sandwich from Pittsburgh’s Primanti Brothers. The more expensive dining-room offerings are less fun—and less reliable.\n\nMood: There’s a buzz in the bar and lounge, where cocktail maven Gina Chersevani presides in her flowered apron over a bright-yellow lava-rock bar. The mood in the steely dining room is quieter and more suited for business dinners.\n\nBest for: Happy hours or dates in the lounge (most everything is shareable); Chersevani’s excellent, outside-the-box cocktails, which feature everything from Miller High Life to marshmallows.\n\nBest dishes: Tiny oxtail “tots”; flatbread topped with Buffalo chicken, blue cheese, and celery; snappy miniature hot dogs with house-made ketchup; tuna-tartare-filled sliders on buttery Parker House rolls; Primanti Brothers sandwich with soppresatta, shoestring fries, and a runny egg; sirloin au poivre, light on the pepper but thick and satisfying; short ribs and foie gras baked in flaky pastry; warm beignets served in a paper bag; Situation Rum cocktail with hibiscus tea; Yes We Can-ton, with Cava and pineapple; toasted cider punch.\n\nInsider tips: A weeknight happy hour—with $3 beer, $4 wine, and half-price flatbreads—runs from 4 to 7.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner. Expensive.\n\n65. Indique Heights ★★½\n\n2 Wisconsin Cir., Chevy Chase; 301-656-4822\n\nCuisine: Dynamic Indian flavors find their way into unexpected preparations, such as crabcakes (spiked with anise), Caesar salad with chicken grilled in the tandoor, and especially the lineup of chef/owner K.N. Vinod’s flavor-packed street-snacks menu. Purists can rest assured there are plenty of classic dishes, too.\n\nMood: A low-lit series of elegant dining rooms, outfitted with silk curtains and a gurgling fountain, is energized by brightly colored plates, glittering granite tables, and red-and-orange-striped booths.\n\nBest for: An introduction to Indian cuisine; a filling meal after a day of shopping in the boutiques of Friendship Heights.\n\nBest dishes: Vegetable samosa chaat, spilling with tomatoey chickpeas; crab tikki, anise-spiked crab patties with spicy coconut flakes; cayenne-rubbed tilapia with lemony rice; coconutty Malabar shrimp curry; a very peppery chicken chettinad; shreekand brûlée, a yogurt-based riff on crème brûlée studded with pistachios.\n\nInsider tips: Midday deals abound. The all-you-can-eat lunch buffet holds about ten curries and dosas for $10.95. Weekday lunch boxes come both vegetarian ($6.95) and meat-filled ($7.95 to $8.95) and include two curries, rice pilaf, and naan.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n64. General Store ★★½\n\n6 Post Office Rd., Silver Spring; 301-562-8787\n\nCuisine: A loving and affordably priced tour of the simple, soulful dishes that define Americana, from pot pie to fish tacos to fried chicken. Chef Gillian Clark cooks what she loves, and when she’s on—which is often—it shows.\n\nMood: Burlap sacks of potatoes and quirky bits of memorabilia—vintage magazine ads, a stuffed bear—lend the front half of this eat-in/takeaway a homey flavor. But the two dining areas in back don’t really have a sense of place.\n\nBest for: Eating cheaply without resorting to the chains or fast food.\n\nBest dishes: Crispy shrimp on baguettes; meatloaf with sweet-sour onion gravy, an occasional special we’d like to see more often; tangy collards studded with pork; not-too-cheesy macaroni and cheese; nicely fried battered chicken; an ever-changing roster of luscious pies, including a wonderful coconut cream and lemon chess.\n\nInsider tips: Best to go for lunch, when crowds are usually at bay. The scene at night, especially on weekends, can be frenetic, and with so few tables it’s wise to consider takeout rather than a sit-down meal. Whole pies are available if you call a day or two ahead.\n\nService: •\n\nOpen Tuesday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Inexpensive.\n\n63. Nava Thai Noodle and Grill ★★½\n\n11301 Fern St., Wheaton; 240-430-0495\n\nCuisine: If it’s not Washington’s best Thai restaurant, it’s easily the most interesting. Owners and cooks Suchart and Ladavan Srigatesook have culled a fascinating assortment of dishes from the night-market stalls and floating barges in Thailand. The cooking is bright and bold, perhaps nowhere more so than in the marvelous and complex soups and the vivid papaya salad (made to order). Even pad Thai is transformed from a gloppy noodle dish into a small symphony of flavor.\n\nMood: The multi-room setting once housed a Greek taverna, and the rustic-chic appointments aren’t an ideal match for the restaurant’s vision of quick-serve Thai street food. The giant olive-oil bottles of fish sauce that sit on the tables feel almost comical. Then again, the atmosphere is cozy, and when the place is packed on weekends, it’s lively but not loud.\n\nBest for: Food adventurers.\n\nBest dishes: Papaya salad; pad Thai; hot-and-sour squid; a crispy frittata of mussels with green curry; Floating Market Noodle Soup, sweet and funky and sour and incendiary; drunken noodles.\n\nInsider tips: Don’t hold out for the desserts—none are worth the calories, even those made that morning.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Inexpensive.\n\n62. Minh’s ★★½\n\n2500 Wilson Blvd., Arlington; 703-525-2828\n\nCuisine: To judge by the inclusive menu at this East Coast outpost of the Nguyen family’s popular San Jose restaurant empire, this is one of the area’s preeminent destinations for Vietnamese cooking. Both northern and southern dishes are given their due—as are budget-minded diners: No entrée is more than $17.\n\nMood: The expansive dining room tempers its office-building locale with white tablecloths and soothing red walls. Although large groups are often the norm, the space retains its calm, Zen-like energy.\n\nBest for: A good introduction to Vietnamese food, and the menu is broad enough to include something for just about every taste and sensibility.\n\nBest dishes: Luscious pork vermicelli, both northern (saltier) and southern (sweeter); banh xeo, an oversize, web-like crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp, and pork; fried shrimp-and-yam patties; a fragrant, dill-laced catfish, to be broken into hunks and folded into giant leaves of lettuce; a clay pot bubbling with a sweet/peppery caramel sauce and bits of catfish; chicken, tart with lemongrass and covered in red-pepper flakes.\n\nInsider tips: Bring a large group—most dishes are served family style and can feed several.\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen Tuesday through Sunday for lunch and dinner. Inexpensive.\n\n61. L’Auberge Chez François ★★½\n\n332 Springvale Rd., Great Falls; 703-759-3800\n\nCuisine: It’s all about nostalgia at this Alsatian institution, now in its sixth decade. Plates are still garnished with sprigs of parsley, and the cooking runs to standbys such as Châteaubriand and Dover sole meunière. Founder François Haeringer’s three sons usually run L’Auberge these days, but it’s still a place to rediscover what made classical French the favorite cuisine of the Mad Men era.\n\nMood: Country French dining rooms with dark wood beams, decorative copper pots, and windows framing the countryside seem made for proper celebrations, and the Old World–style pampering reinforces the sense of grand occasion.\n\nBest dishes: A robust onion soup light on cheese and heavy on stock; a delicate crepe with chives, mushrooms, and Madeira-truffle sauce; grapefruit-mint palate-cleanser sorbet; the signature choucroute (a hearty lineup of pork, duck, and goose charcuterie and sausages; sauerkraut steeped in Crémant d’Alsace; red cabbage; and mustards); a marvelous chicken braised in Riesling with jus and haricots verts; whipped broccoli purée; hazelnut soufflé; plum tart with cinnamon ice cream.\n\nBest for: A leisurely romantic dinner, family gathering, or special event.\n\nInsider tips: In summer, the patio is the place to be—it feels as if you’re dining in a meadow. During winter, the coveted tables are fireside. Sunday lunch with light streaming in the walls of windows is also a hot ticket. The price of an entrée—from $59 to $75—includes appetizer, salad, sorbet, vegetable, dessert, and coffee or tea, plus lots of little extras from garlic bread to chocolate truffles. Sunday lunch is a deal at $39 to $49 for a similar meal but with some different menu items.\n\nService: ••••\n\nOpen Sunday and Tuesday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner. Very expensive.\n\n60. Eola ★★½\n\n2020 P St., NW; 202-466-4441\n\nCuisine: How’s this for risk-taking? Sending out a tiny spoonful of offal as an amuse-bouche, then following that with plates of chicken-fried tongue. You might expect that kind of thing from Michel Richard, but from a newcomer with little track record and no corporate backing? Fortunately, in Daniel Singhofen’s case, the chef is a young talent who can make good on his promises. Sometimes he tries too hard, but he connects more often than he whiffs, producing imaginative, intensely flavored dishes that hint at big things to come.\n\nMood: The space—tasteful and softly lit—suggests a cross between Obelisk and Komi, restaurants that define the new aesthetic of townhouse dining and that stand as models for the sort of place the chef and owners aspire to.\n\nBest for: Gastronomes who understand that supporting an interesting independent restaurant means enduring a misstep or two.\n\nBest dishes: Pork croquettes with apple-mustard sauce; chicken-fried tongue with braised lentils; a sunchoke velouté, most recently embellished with raisins and toasted almonds; agnolotti filled with bitter greens and accompanied by buttery squash fondue; roasted pheasant with deviled quail eggs and olives; apple galette; mocha-chestnut roulade.\n\nInsider tips: Eola boasts a fine, if smallish, roster of beers, a number of which match well with the dishes on the menu. And there are some surprisingly good deals on the well-chosen, 100-bottle wine list.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Tuesday through Saturday for dinner. Expensive.\n\n59. Kotobuki ★★½\n\n4822 MacArthur Blvd., NW, Second Floor; 202-281-6679\n\nCuisine: You’d have an easier time turning up a moderate Republican on the Hill than finding sushi that’s this fresh and this cheap. Equally uncommon is the rest of chef Hisao Abe’s menu, a roster of largely unfamiliar but traditional Japanese dishes—from the rice casseroles called kamameshi to oshizushi, a pressed-sushi preparation deriving from Osaka—that distinguish it from the conventionally minded raw-fish houses.\n\nMood: There’s barely space to breathe in this small second-floor dining room containing a sushi bar, a handful of tables, and nearly always a line out the door. Above the hum of the Beatles-only soundtrack, servers encourage diners—a mix of couples and families—to eat and run.\n\nBest for: A first date; a good on-the-go dinner for up to four—the wait will lengthen if tables have to be put together.\n\nBest dishes: Silky monkfish-liver pâté, known as ankimo—the foie gras of the sea; oshizushi, square blocks of saltier-than-normal rice pressed tightly and topped with thin slices of fish; eel kamameshi, a hot pot with charred rice, raw fish, and vegetables preceded by a parade of mezze-type appetizers; a smooth slab of fatty or white tuna atop a small bed of rice; green-tea mochi, a pouch of Japanese ice cream encased in a rice wrapper.\n\nInsider tips: Check out the specials posted on the wall—fresh fish comes in daily (look for the uni) and is the only time Abe strays from his otherwise unchanging menu.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for dinner. Inexpensive.\n\n58. Vermilion ★★½\n\n1120 King St., Alexandria; 703-684-9669\n\nCuisine: If only all neighborhood restaurants paid this much attention to the craft of cooking. Tony Chittum’s rustic comfort food is full of handmade details—the terrines, sausages, and pastas are prepared in-house, and many of the high-quality ingredients are from local farms.\n\nMood: One of Old Town’s most picturesque streets is the setting for this cozy restaurant, which achieves a tucked-away, boho feel with red velvet drapes and exposed-brick walls.\n\nBest for: Dates in one of the cushy banquettes; eating at the bar; a spur-of-the-moment dinner; the excellent brunch.\n\nBest dishes: Roasted scallops with leeks and a potato gratin; crusty fried oysters with fennel; roasted chicken with smashed grapes and kale; rockfish surrounded by clams and a light chowder; Maryland rib eye and short rib with blue cheese; seared duck with duck sausage and dirty rice; apple beignets with cider and apple sorbet; goat-cheese cake, at once rich and airy; profiteroles stuffed with rocky-road ice cream.\n\nInsider tips: A weeknight happy hour, with $4 appetizers and discounted beer, wine, and cocktails, runs from 4 to 7.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n57. Black Market Bistro ★★½\n\n4600 Waverly Ave., Garrett Park; 301-933-3000\n\nCuisine: Thoughtfully crafted renditions of home-kitchen fare (roast chicken, apple crisp) plus chef-driven creations with the occasional dash of lemongrass or chimichurri. The menu doesn’t change much, but this is one of the most consistent places around.\n\nMood: With its white-lattice porch and Pottery Barn aesthetic, this collection of cozy dining rooms is loaded with small-town charm. You’ll even hear the windows rattle now and then—that’s just the freight train rumbling by.\n\nBest for: Casual dinners; the terrific brunch; a brief respite from city living.\n\nBest dishes: Crunchy cornmeal-fried oysters with freshly made tartar sauce; roast chicken, straightforward and satisfying; barbecue shrimp over corn-studded grits; wood-grilled hanger steak with chimichurri; fried-onion-topped cheeseburger; apple crisp; potato latkes and orange-vanilla French toast at brunch.\n\nInsider tips: The restaurant takes a very limited number of reservations each night, so go early or late to avoid a wait. On nights when there’s a performance at Strathmore, tables usually open up around showtime.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate.\n\n56. The Majestic ★★½\n\n911 King St., Alexandria; 703-837-9117\n\nCuisine: Comfort cooking with a twist. The coq au vin is spiked with cocoa, and Old Bay aïoli livens up a Chesapeake seafood stew. The chef is Shannon Overmiller, hand-picked by proprietor Cathal Armstrong of Restaurant Eve, and more and more her stamp is on nearly every bowl and plate that emerges from the open kitchen—even the bread and pickles are made in-house.\n\nMood: The young and single hover by the bar, where the cocktails of Todd Thrasher and Melissa Horst hold sway; the dining room, with its big mirrors and soft lighting, draws couples of all ages.\n\nBest for: A top-notch meal without all the bells and whistles of fine dining.\n\nBest dishes: Chicken-liver mousse as dense as it is smooth; crumb-crusted whole sardines with caramelized onions and sage; Coco’a Vin, a delectable, cocoa-laced take on the wine-and-chicken stew that tastes like a cross between the French classic and a mole; well-seasoned slabs of meatloaf with mushroom gravy; one of the best coconut cakes in the area, served in tall, thick wedges; a bourbon milk punch that could double as dessert.\n\nInsider tips: Unless you want to do extra penance on the StairMaster, consider sharing some plates, especially dessert; portions are generous. And take advantage of the ongoing specials: The $12 Royal Pick lunch (an entrée and soda or iced tea) and Nana’s Sunday Dinner ($22 per person for entrée, sides, and dessert) are good deals.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday from 1 to 9 for dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n55. Inox ★★½\n\n1800 Tysons Blvd., McLean; 703-790-4669\n\nCuisine: When it first opened, it seemed that chef/owners Jonathan Krinn and Jon Mathieson—who had brought moments of playfulness to the white tablecloths at 2941—forgot how to have fun at their hotly anticipated Tysons Corner showpiece. A menu of esoteric ingredients felt forced. Krinn is now working the dining room, and Mathieson’s French-inflected American food is more relaxed. One thing hasn’t changed: The owners throw recession caution to the wind; hardly a dish exits the kitchen without being anointed by some little luxury, be it foie gras, truffles, or caviar.\n\nMood: The office-park dining room is about as exciting as a Ford Taurus. Browns and grays dominate—on the walls and on the suited-up diners, some of whom choose to be seated in the DVD-equipped private rooms. The lounge is livelier, with its conversation-piece bar and tables made from tree trunks.\n\nBest for: A client lunch or dinner.\n\nBest dishes: Most meats, including seared foie gras piggybacking on a gamey venison filet and a duo of duck with breast and leg confit; a generous slice of foie gras with caramelized apples; a pair of bass filets in a Vietnamese-pho-like ginger broth with cilantro and jalapeños; a decadent surf and turf of lobster poached in butter with a short-rib raviolo; a rich chocolate bread pudding, its denseness and intensity leavened by savory kalamata olives in the batter and a dollop of olive-oil ice cream; grapefruit custard tempered by intensely vanilla ice cream.\n\nInsider tips: If you see a dish you like on the tasting menu, you can almost always order it à la carte in an appetizer- or entrée-size portion. While sommelier John Wabeck’s wine list is hearty and excellent, don’t ignore the creative cocktail list.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for dinner. Very expensive.\n\n54. Trummer’s on Main ★★½\n\n7134 Main St., Clifton; 703-266-1623\n\nCuisine: This ambitious newcomer, taking up residence in an old inn in off-the-beaten-track Clifton, has emerged as a home of elegant rusticity. The secret’s in the sauces—ethereal reductions, froths, and marmalades drizzled or dolloped so judiciously that they never overwhelm. Even braised veal with root vegetables and vermouth cream isn’t as weighty as it sounds—its tiny pool of cream is almost like a condiment. The lineup of talent is formidable: Chef Clayton Miller came to Clifton after stints at the French Laundry in Napa Valley and Daniel in Manhattan; co-owner Stefan Trummer, who has shaken and stirred at New York’s Bouley, doubles as cocktail master; Tyler Packwood, late of the Inn at Little Washington, is sommelier; Chris Ford, from ChikaLicious Dessert Bar in New York, is pastry chef.\n\nMood: Few traces of the old Hermitage Inn remain in the airy main dining room, where French windows overlook a flagstone waterfall and garden and palm-frond fans twirl from the high ceiling. Service is formal enough that a table of four, six, or eight will all get its plates at precisely the same moment.\n\nBest for: A convivial meal with friends, a romantic repast, or a celebratory dinner for a group (there’s a big communal table in the center of the main dining room). A mostly over-30 crowd gathers in the first floor bar/lounge on weekends.\n\nBest dishes: The house Titanic 13 cocktail, with grape vodka, muddled grapes, and Champagne sorbet floating on top; flour-dusted ciabatta; a fresh take on pumpkin soup with sweet lump crab, salty bay-leaf crumble, and frothy pumpkin foam; frisée with mild curry vinaigrette and celery three ways (puréed, shaved, and steamed); vermouth-braised veal with rutabaga and vermouth cream; flaky Nantucket flounder with Yukon Gold purée; chocolate cream, a painterly swipe of lush chocolate pudding with hazelnut sorbet and crunchy cocoa nibs.\n\nInsider tips: The wait between starters and main courses can be long. Request a table in the Winter Garden; the third-floor dining rooms aren’t as charming.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Saturday for dinner, Sunday for brunch; bar/lounge open until midnight. Expensive.\n\n53. Cashion’s Eat Place ★★½\n\n1819 Columbia Rd., NW; 202-797-1819\n\nCuisine: Ann Cashion may no longer be here, but chef John Manolatos has maintained her standards, serving a consistently satisfying lineup of elegantly homey dishes. His Greek-inspired—and family-derived—fare particularly stands out.\n\nMood: A low-key charmer with the soul of a neighborhood restaurant, serving regulars from Adams Morgan and beyond in a warmly lit dining room brimming with good-time seekers.\n\nBest for: Dates and double dates; brunch; late-night eating—sous chef Sam Thresher takes over the kitchen at midnight on weekends, putting out a likable menu of chili dogs, shaved-beef sandwiches, and grilled veal.\n\nBest dishes: Pork souvlaki with tzatziki and chilies on grilled flatbread; a buttery skillet of Alaskan crab, Parmesan, and prosciutto with Parker House rolls; turbot with grapefruit beurre blanc; duck breast with foie gras; a juicy bison burger (brunch); pear clafoutis.\n\nInsider tips: Sunday through Thursday from 5:30 to 7:30, wines by the glass are half price.\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen Tuesday through Saturday for dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n52. Spice Xing ★★½\n\n100-B Gibbs St., Rockville; 301-610-0303\n\nCuisine: The sibling restaurant to chef Sudhir Seth’s Passage to India trades the elegance and formality of its big sister for a more casual and vibrant experience. It’s a looser operation, but the profusion of flavors emanating from the kitchen—complex, vivid curries, lovingly rendered street snacks, well-blistered breads—is testament to the commitment to authenticity. A tantalizing roster of cocktails complements—and balances—the heat in the dishes.\n\nMood: The quiet, colorful space manages to be stylish without feeling off-putting, soothing without being somnolent, and provides an appealing backdrop for the riot of flavors on the table.\n\nBest for: A grand meal that’s not out of reach for ordinary weekday dining.\n\nBest dishes: Mini-dosas; juicy, plump tandoori wings; a single butterflied barbecue jumbo shrimp, foil-tipped and hot from the tandoor oven; a Persian-style lamb-and-apricot stew; a simple and spot-on chicken tikka masala; roasted baby eggplants; lychee mojito.\n\nInsider tips: The curries travel extremely well, making good carryout choices. If you order in, you might want to consider getting an extra couple to go to help out with lunch for the week.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Inexpensive to moderate.\n\n51. The Prime Rib ★★½\n\n2020 K St., NW; 202-466-8811\n\nCuisine: No clever juxtapositions, no artful drizzles, no chef-inspired riffs on comfort-food classics. This elegant supper club serves as steward for straightforward if lavish renditions of meat, fish, and potatoes. Shrimp and flounder come stuffed with jumbo lump crab, and the titular star—slow-roasted beef with jus poured atop it at the table—remains a welcome reminder of the virtues of honesty and simplicity.\n\nMood: Economy? What economy? Here, women are draped in minks, men wear expensive suits, and the waiters are all tuxedoed. It’s a timeless, clubby place that reminds you of your grandfather—if he happened to have his own library.\n\nBest for: A guys’ night out; a special-occasion dinner for those who don’t cotton to too much innovation; an important business lunch.\n\nBest dishes: Chunky, creamy crab imperial; steak au poivre with a side of Marchand de Vin sauce; prime rib; pencil-thin grilled asparagus with hollandaise; house-made Key-lime pie; a pink pouf of strawberries Romanoff.\n\nInsider tips:At lunch, men are free to dine without jackets, and all can take advantage of the prix-fixe menu—three courses for $24.95. At dinner, there’s complimentary valet parking and live piano.\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner. Expensive to very expensive.\n\n50. Adour ★★½\n\nSt. Regis, 923 16th St., NW; 202-509-8000\n\nCuisine: Jet-setting chef Alain Ducasse—who has 18 Michelin stars and oversees 22 restaurants from Tokyo to Monaco—aims for elegance that appears effortless. Ducasse’s French technique is both rigorously followed (near-perfect macarons) and thoughtfully tweaked (a halibut meunière with grapes) by his kitchen staff. The menu says the cuisine is “designed with wine in mind”—and sommelier Ramon Narvaez, a Marcel’s alum, stocks an excellent bottle collection.\n\nMood: A polished team of servers dotes on jacketed men and glammed-up women in a whitewashed room that melds David Rockwell’s modern design with a dark, beamed ceiling. True to the Ducasse brand, the space feels elite, with buttery-leather chairs, glass-covered wine shelves, and three semicircular private booths with gold-painted ceilings.\n\nBest for: Diners who value wine as much as they do food.\n\nBest dishes: Frothed cauliflower velouté with crunchy bits of blanched cauliflower and perfectly cubed croutons; flawlessly cooked halibut garnished with grapes (peeled, of course) and walnuts; foie-gras-stuffed squab breast atop cabbage (who knew it could be so airy?); hazelnut soufflé with smooth orange sorbet; meringue slices with pear chutney and maple-pecan pastry.\n\nInsider tips: Every table gets a plate of macarons—one of the best items out of the kitchen—and house-made truffles at the end of the meal. Instead of dessert, try the cheese plate, a well-selected lineup with thoughtful condiments such as red-pepper jelly and toasted pine nuts in syrup.\n\nService: •••½\n\nOpen Sunday and Monday for breakfast, Tuesday through Saturday for breakfast and dinner. Very expensive.\n\n49. Cork ★★½\n\n1720 14th St., NW; 202-265-2675\n\nCuisine: What makes this bustling boîte the best wine bar in Washington? It has the best food. Chef Ron Tanaka, a Citronelle and CityZen alum, seldom employs more than five ingredients, creating complex but unfussy small plates that change with the season and are remarkable for their consistency. Owners Diane Gross and Khalid Pitts maintain the carefully curated list of Old World–only wines, many of which come from small producers.\n\nMood: Since it opened, this founding member of the newly hot 14th Street corridor has felt like a favorite pair of jeans. There’s an intimacy in the narrow space, framed by exposed brick and a pressed-tin ceiling, that draws a regular rotation of neighborhood twenty- and thirtysomethings, who squeeze in around the bar while waiting upward of an hour for a table.\n\nBest for: A group of friends looking to catch up over dinner; oenophiles in search of new thrills.\n\nBest dishes: Braised mustard greens with big bites of pork tenderloin and rings of tempura-fried lemon; long-roasted Brussels sprouts, their nutty flavor accentuated with fresh thyme; a croque madame by way of Italy with prosciutto and fontina; a Moroccan-inspired stew of chickpeas with saffron; garlic-and-lemon-kissed French fries with house-made ketchup; a densely creamy trio of crustless goat-cheese-cake quenelles.\n\nInsider tips: If you show up for dinner when the crowds start congregating just before 7, you can forget about trying to make a movie or show. But you can make reservations from 5:30 to 6:30. And on Sundays there’s rarely a wait.\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen Tuesday through Sunday for dinner. Moderate.\n\n48. Tallula ★★½\n\n2761 Washington Blvd., Arlington; 703-778-5051\n\nCuisine: Chef Barry Koslow’s terrines and pâtés stand out on a contemporary farm-to-table menu that has moments both robust (cavatelli with veal sausage) and refined (crisp fried oysters with puréed celery root).\n\nMood: The dining room, with its orange-red walls and Mission-style wood furniture, lacks the character of the restaurant’s popular gastropub, EatBar, but the curvy corner booths give you a wide-angle view on the whole room and subdued lighting makes it feel more intimate.\n\nBest for: Those who believe that good wine is essential to a good meal; besides three- and six-ounce pours, you can order ten-ounce beakers and half and full bottles.\n\nBest dishes: Terrines, including the rosy rabbit and silky chicken liver in ceramic pots; fried oysters with celery-root purée and apple “risotto”; marvelous spaghetti squash served casserole style; farmers-market lettuces with breakfast radishes and Champagne vinaigrette; roasted gnocchi with braised wild boar, Niçoise olives, and rapini; cavatelli with lemon, chili flakes, and veal sausage; toffee brownie with pistachio ice cream.\n\nInsider tips: Saturday brunch means old-time cartoons such as Foghorn Leghorn and Pepe Le Pew on the big screen in EatBar; on Sunday, look for family movie screenings.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n47. Ray’s the Classics ★★½\n\n8606 Colesville Rd., Silver Spring; 301-588-7297\n\nCuisine: Michael Landrum is so obsessive about his aged, hand-trimmed Hereford steaks that he worries a customer might ruin one by ordering it incorrectly. The New York strip can be ordered “rare, medium rare, and medium only.” This might sound like the work of a control freak, but it speaks to what makes the place worthwhile—uncommon engagement from a passionate proprietor that shows up in everything from the cut-rate pricing to the loving odes to regional classics such as crab bisque.\n\nMood: The anti-steakhouse steakhouse. Harking to the egalitarian promise of the new Silver Spring, Landrum emphasizes accessibility and affordability. The supper-club-by-way-of-Ikea dining room tends toward austerity, but the place is almost always busy, especially pre- and post-movie—the AFI Silver Theatre is across the street.\n\nBest for: Good dining without pretense.\n\nBest dishes: Perhaps the area’s best crab bisque; crab royale sprinkled with Old Bay; among the steaks, the entrecôte and the hanger steak; jumbo diver scallops, blackened or wrapped in bacon; the ten-ounce Ray’s Hell-Burger with most of the fixings offered at the Arlington original; creamed spinach; tangy Key-lime pie.\n\nInsider tips: In the bar area, a three-course Bistro Special offers soup or salad, entrée, and dessert for $23.95. For smaller appetites, the Petit Bistro Special—$18.95 for soup or salad, ten-ounce sirloin, and dessert—is an even better deal. Both bistro menus come with free mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen daily for dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n46. Mourayo ★★½\n\n1732 Connecticut Ave., NW; 202-667-2100\n\nCuisine: It used to be that the flaming cheese known as saganaki—lit tableside—delivered most of the excitement in going out to eat Greek. At this cozy bistro, the drama is quieter but more intriguing. It offers a modern makeover of a traditional, often heavy cuisine—from the liberal use of Greek wines and ouzos in dishes to the focus on native cheeses. Even better, for all of the refinement, the cooking still retains an essential gutsiness.\n\nMood: A dynamic ceramic sculpture anchors the back wall, while flashes of dark Aegean blue, glossy wood, and servers dressed in captain’s hats and stripes lend the narrow room a nautical feel. With a recent expansion, there’s now a bar area plus a handful of additional tables. The best part about the renovation? A new entrance means no more blasts of frigid air in the main dining room.\n\nBest for: A night of intense flavors and conversation.\n\nBest dishes: Crisp butternut-squash keftedes, a sort of vegetable meatball with sesame seeds and raisin paste; nicely charred octopus with octopus-ink vinaigrette; an elegant moussaka with duck, eggplant, and kefalotyri cheese; grilled whole fish, especially the branzino.\n\nInsider tips: Some platters, such as the symposium edesmata, a lineup of dips, are a mixed bag, with stellar (fava-bean purée; tzatziki; tyrokafteri, a spicy feta-and-hot-pepper spread) and not-so-stellar (hummus, skordalia, taramasalata) items. If you ask nicely, the kitchen has been known to let you order individual items or make substitutions.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday for dinner, Tuesday through Sunday for lunch and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n45. Cava ★★½\n\n527 Eighth St., SE, 202-543-9090; 9713 Traville Gateway Dr., Rockville, 301-309-9090\n\nCuisine: If all you know about Greek food comes by way of family-style diners trading on heaping portions of moussaka, these cozy mezzeterias—the creation of three Rockville natives and longtime friends—will be revelatory. They straddle the lines between authenticity and modernity, between lightness and heartiness.\n\nMood: The slinky hostess in her cocktail dress could have come straight from a hot club; the waitstaff wears jeans and black T-shirts. Those polarities define these brick-walled, bare-tabled restaurants, which have a good deal more heart and soul than a first glance suggests.\n\nBest for: Big groups of friends; a night of dining where you can feel free to roll up your sleeves and get your napkin messy.\n\nBest dishes: Spicy lamb sliders with tzatziki; olive-oil-drenched squares of watermelon with mint and feta; zesty, grandmother-style meatballs in tomato sauce; a tangy, full-bodied avgolemono soup; Disco Fries, a sort of Greek sloppy joe, with cinnamon-spiced braised lamb spilling over crispy French fries; superbly thick Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts; loukoumades, or Greek doughnuts.\n\nInsider tips: Portions are bigger and often heartier than at most small-plates spots, usually falling somewhere between a standard appetizer and an entrée—nearly twice the size of a tapa.\n\nService: ••\n\nDC location open Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner. Rockville location open Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for dinner. Moderate.\n\n44. Johnny’s Half Shell ★★½\n\n400 N. Capitol St., NW; 202-737-0400\n\nCuisine: Traditional doesn’t have to mean hidebound. Nor does a rarely changing menu have to be synonymous with a kitchen that has grown stale. Happily, neither is the case at Ann Cashion’s culinary tour of the Chesapeake and Gulf Coast, where fish and seafood are front and center and the chef, a James Beard Award winner, recedes into the background. More than a restaurant, Johnny’s is a celebration of values that may seem to have gone out of fashion amid a rapidly changing restaurant scene: rooted cooking, simplicity of design, consistency of execution.\n\nMood: A classic oyster house, from the tiled floor to the white-jacketed waiters to the rolling laughter at the bar. A magnet for the House and Senate (the Capitol is visible from out front), whose staffers flock to the bar after work, the place manages to remain above the political fray—a tribute, perhaps, to the power of good food and drink to diminish what divides us.\n\nBest for: All those who turn away from the increasingly ambitious ingredient lists of some local restaurants, with their many foams and powders and essences.\n\nBest dishes: A roasted-beet-and-cucumber salad with smoked sturgeon and a delicate caviar parfait; charbroiled Chesapeake oysters; made-to-order oyster stew; the best gumbo in the area; Maryland crabcakes; spicy whole lobster with drawn butter and fresh shell beans; a sigh-inducing coconut cream pie, one of the best desserts around.\n\nInsider tips: On Fridays in summer, the restaurant brings back its remarkable barbecue crabs—good-size hard-shells from Crisfield that are cut in two and dredged in Gulf Coast spices. They’re served on the outdoor patio, where a jazz trio plays.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Saturday for dinner. Expensive.\n\n43. Siroc ★★½\n\n915 15th St., NW; 202-628-2220\n\nCuisine: This modest newcomer stands out more for what it’s not than for what it is. It’s not, for one thing, an exercise in over-the-top richness, larding on the cream, the butter, and the prosciutto, as so many high-end Italian restaurants do. Nor is it the budget buster that the setting and level of execution would lead you to believe. It minds the middle—a place of quiet refinement and moderation. Martin Lackovic’s pastas are among the best in town, all of them imaginatively but judiciously sauced, and he manages to imbue common-sounding dishes with bites of luxury.\n\nMood: The former occupant of the space was Gerard’s Place, a serious destination for haute French cooking, and an air of formality lingers in this more casual (but still tasteful) setting, which retains its popularity as a spot for wooing potential partners (financial and romantic). But there’s also a new energy, and the staff goes about its rounds with cheer and professionalism.\n\nBest for: A grand night at a good price.\n\nBest dishes: Pan-seared shrimp with roasted peppers, anchovies, and fried capers; black-pepper pappardelle with scallops and chili flakes; capellaci, tiny squares of thinly rolled pasta filled with lobster and sweet corn; a lusty trio of coarse-grained house-made sausages with white beans; pan-roasted duck breast.\n\nInsider tips: You can order any of the pastas as a half portion—a way to save but also to sample more of them.\n\nService: •••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n2. Sushi-Ko and Sushi-Ko Chevy Chase ★★½\n\n2309 Wisconsin Ave., NW, 202-333-4187; 5455 Wisconsin Ave., Chevy Chase, 301-961-1644\n\nCuisine: For raw-fish fanciers, there are few better places to appreciate the subtleties of the genre than these restaurants, which trade on smart sourcing and eschew style points and overambitious menus in favor of careful execution. The nigiri in particular are models of purity and balance: small, well-seasoned pads of rice, atop which sit thin, delicately carved slices of fresh fish.\n\nMood: The original in Glover Park is the city’s oldest sushi bar and remains a template for the sort of unstuffy dining rooms cropping up around the area (though some might find it austere); the sumptuous spinoff in Friendship Heights manages to ride the line between glamorous and accessible.\n\nBest for: Sushi purists.\n\nBest dishes: Spot-prawn nigiri; a presentation of scallop sashimi, alternately rich and clean; sashimi or nigiri of salmon, yellowtail, yellowtail belly, and mackerel; a light and crisp deep-fried soft-shell crab with ponzu sauce; salmon teriyaki.\n\nInsider tips: Sushi, particularly sashimi, makes a surprisingly rewarding take-out dinner (unlike pizza, there’s no chance of steaming), and both locations are attentive to the needs of diners looking to duck in and out.\n\nService: ••\n\nDC location open Tuesday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday through Monday for dinner. Chevy Chase location open Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n41. 701 ★★½\n\n701 Pennsylvania Ave., NW; 202-393-0701\n\nCuisine: Twenty-eight-year-old Adam Longworth, an alum of New York’s Modern American pioneer Gotham Bar and Grill, has steadied this kitchen with surehanded American cooking that shows off an atlas of influences.\n\nMood: With its shimmery wall of silk threads and baby-blue leather chairs, the renovated dining room—so big it’s usually easy to get a table—has a freshly swank look. A pianist who plays Thursday through Saturday adds to the charm.\n\nBest for: Pre- and post-theater dining; business lunches; dinner with the parents.\n\nBest dishes: Clam chowder with gnocchi and prosciutto; classic steak tartare topped with a chilled hollandaise “yolk”; spinach salad with bacon and goat cheese; seared halibut with lovely jasmine rice and coconut sauce; a Spain-inspired branzino with Serrano ham and olives; custardy banana ice cream.\n\nInsider tips: Don’t overlook the cocktails. The bar features the talents of Mo Taheri, the charismatic bartender who’s been mixing Negronis in Washington for 20 years. He makes a mean Manhattan and passionfruit mojito.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for dinner. Expensive.\n\n40. Sushi Sono ★★½\n\n10215 Wincopin Cir., Columbia; 410-997-6131\n\nCuisine: Some of the most creative, exuberant sushi-making in the area emerges from the busy kitchen at this lakefront restaurant. Chef King Lin is a persnickety shopper (he procures some of the best chu-toro, or fatty tuna, around) and possessed of a vivid imagination. Witness the fishing boat he fashions from a small horse mackerel (the fish is sparklingly fresh) or his magnificent Dragon Roll, a tour de force of color and drama. Rolls are a point of pride—they’re not filled with the scraps from preparations of nigiri and sashimi but treated (and often priced) as featured players.\n\nMood: Eye-catching plates of sushi sail through the dining room as heads turn and point, and the line of diners congregating by the door for a table grows longer. (This is arguably the toughest reservation in Columbia.) The bustle is balanced by the serenity of Lake Kittamaqundi visible through the long plate-glass windows.\n\nBest for: A night of splurging on the high-priced delicacies and rarities that dot the menu.\n\nBest dishes: Snow Balls, panko-rolled, deep-fried shrimp croquettes dusted with Old Bay; shrimp hand rolls; sashimi or horse mackerel (ask the kitchen to fry the skin and bones for a pleasurable treat); sashimi of wild baby red snapper, fatty yellowtail, and o-toro, shipped from Japan; salt-grilled geoduck clam.\n\nInsider tips: Stick to sushi and sashimi—the tempura and the rendition of shabu shabu are ordinary.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen daily for lunch and dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n39. Willow ★★½\n\n4301 N. Fairfax Dr., Arlington; 703-465-8800\n\nCuisine: Briny scallops get a hit of sweetness from a dice of butternut squash. Creamy-sweet smoked tomato bisque goes tart and grainy with a zesty olive tapenade. Chef Tracy O’Grady plays with flavor and texture on her seafood-centric menu, and more often than not her pairings come off well. Her years with Bob Kinkead have also made her a master fryer; shrimp, scallops, and sweetbreads are all done to a golden turn.\n\nMood: This sprawling space, with its dramatic drapes and oversize burgundy lamp shades, is more fun when full; the bar/lounge has an intimate vibe.\n\nBest for: After-work get-togethers and dinner with gal pals—the rooms are spacious, and the menu abounds in high/low options.\n\nBest dishes: Crisp fried veal sweetbreads; lobster agnolotti filled with sizable chunks of lobster and berthed on a “butter” of lobster roe and sherry; lemony fried chicken; flatbread pizzas, including the signature Willow, with fontina, thyme, lemon, and truffle essence; gorgeous farm lettuces with shaved Manchego and citrusy sherry dressing; a perfect-for-sharing fisherman’s platter with fried shrimp, scallops, lobster, calamari, pickled fennel, and spiked rémoulade; seared day-boat scallops with butternut squash two ways, diced and in ravioli.\n\nInsider tips: Desserts have been disappointing lately, and the wine list is full of underwhelming picks. When making a reservation, ask to be seated in the main dining room; the two annexes, often used for private events, feel B-list.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday for dinner. Moderate to expensive.\n\n38. Poste ★★½\n\nHotel Monaco, 555 Eighth St., NW; 202-783-6060\n\nCuisine: Respectful of the classics but with a bit of whimsy, Robert Weland, one of the area’s most underrated chefs, has turned this hotel restaurant into an exciting and consistent destination for smartly conceived, carefully executed American cooking.\n\nMood: A bright and bustling multilevel space with vaulted ceilings, an open kitchen, and the air of a big night in the making.\n\nBest for: Dinner before or after a show or a game or concert at Verizon Center.\n\nBest dishes: Steak tartare on brioche, a clever variation on the mini-burger craze; a slow-cooked hen egg on toasted brioche with hollandaise and black truffles; wild-mushroom consommé, earthy and intense; spit-roasted poussin; a crisp-skinned filet of sea bass capped by a red-wine-poached egg; a loving ode to salted caramel, a multipart dessert that never descends into gimmickry.\n\nInsider tips: The restaurant hosts Poste Roasts several times a year during spring and summer—moderately priced prix fixe dinners centered on spit-roasted meats and small-batch whiskeys and served in the courtyard.\n\nService: ••\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch and dinner. Expensive.\n\n37. Patowmack Farm ★★★\n\n42461 Lovettsville Rd., Lovettsville, Va.; 540-822-9017\n\nCuisine: “Farm to table” is given fresh meaning at this country restaurant, where much of what’s served is grown on the surrounding farm. During dinner, chef Christopher Edwards sometimes can be seen outdoors snipping herbs to finish his produce-driven plates.\n\nMood: The dining room, a glass conservatory perched in the Potomac River Valley, commands a glorious sweep of mountains—and sunsets. By night, candelabras flicker inside and tiny white lights line the rafters.\n\nBest for: A romantic brunch or dinner while it’s still light out—that way you can work up an appetite with a stroll on the farm’s half-mile woodland trail and take in the view.\n\nBest dishes: Chèvre-and-herb crepe with roasted beets and a drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar; deconstructed croque madame with soft-cooked farm egg, dry-cured ham, and béchamel on a buttery house-made brioche cube; meaty beef short rib with spaghetti squash and chanterelles; seared diver scallops with carrot tagliatelle, black truffle, and Madeira jus; caramel-coffee soufflé with toffee ice cream and crystallized herbs.\n\nInsider tips: Service is solicitous, with servers waxing enthusiastic about every dish. More-informal—and less-expensive—Sunday suppers are sometimes offered.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Thursday and Friday for dinner, Saturday for brunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch. Very expensive.\n\n36. Makoto ★★★\n\n4822 MacArthur Blvd., NW; 202-298-6866\n\nCuisine: No sushi bar in the area can match the intensity, focus, and purity of this tiny restaurant in DC’s Palisades. Chef Tetsuro Takanashi’s $60 prix fixe menu presents a parade of tastes and textures, from the simple (a cube of avocado with soybean sauce) to the deceptively simple (a slab of orange roughy with a sweet miso glaze). Many diners also indulge in a few pieces of well-sourced sashimi and nigiri from the à la carte menu. These add-ons don’t come cheap, but selections such as the fatty yellowtail and live scallop offer some of the restaurant’s greatest rewards.\n\nMood: The dining room exudes Zen-like serenity punctuated by shouted salutations from waitresses and chefs. Wearing the required slippers and sitting on wooden boxes instead of chairs adds to the sense of transport. Most diners seem to modulate their voices as they talk with the Geisha-like, kimono-clad waitresses.\n\nBest for: Diners willing to put themselves in the hands of the chef and let a meal run its course.\n\nBest dishes: The tasting menu of ten or so courses changes regularly but can include persimmon with sweet tofu sauce; mussels marinated in oil with ginger and onion; shrimp wrapped in wheat bread and fried; fried eggplant with soybean sauce; fatty yellowtail sashimi with freshly grated wasabi; miso-glazed orange roughy; beef with mushroom sauce; grape purée with Grand Marnier granita.\n\nInsider tips: There can be hidden costs—the only water you’ll be poured is bottled water for an added charge, and the only tuna is the excellent but expensive fatty tuna.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Tuesday through Saturday for lunch and dinner, Sunday for dinner. Very expensive.\n\n35. Bourbon Steak ★★★\n\nFour Seasons Hotel, 2800 Pennsylvania Ave., NW; 202-944-2026\n\nCuisine: This Four Seasons hot spot is only nominally a steakhouse. The force behind it is San Francisco’s Michael Mina, known for his flair with fish. Accordingly, the tuna tartare is more memorable than the porterhouse. Beware the prices: Care for a $75 snifter of single malt after that $85 lobster pot pie?\n\nMood: The chocolate-leather-clad dining room exudes a sort of modern elegance. But the place has a sense of humor, too—a gratis trio of McDonald’s-inspired fries (fried in duck fat and served with house-made ketchup) welcomes every table.\n\nBest for: Dinner on the boss’s dime; splurging on date night; cocktails and appetizers in the lounge.\n\nBest dishes: Spice-poached-shrimp cocktail; chilled lobster with yuzu; classic wedge salad; tuna tartare, which sets itself apart with sesame oil and Asian pear; creamy shrimp Louis; pan-roasted chicken with mac and cheese, a Trump-style TV dinner; garlic-and-chive pierogi; boozy butterscotch pot de crème made with 18-year-old Macallan; caramel apple; coconut candy bar.\n\nInsider tips: Pace, pace, pace. After those fries comes the bread course: a skillet of buttery truffle rolls. Do too much nibbling at the outset and you might not make it through the appetizer—which would be a shame because the desserts are some of the area’s best.\n\nService: ••½\n\nOpen Monday through Friday for lunch and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for dinner. Very expensive.\n\n34. Teatro Goldoni ★★★\n\n1909 K St., NW; 202-955-9494\n\nCuisine: Chef Enzo Fargione, who was head chef at Roberto Donna’s late Galileo, revived this K Street destination almost two years ago, dazzling the business crowd and attracting foodies with creative spins on regional Italian cooking. Among his tricks: a slice of branzino in a cigar "
