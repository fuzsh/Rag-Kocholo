        "text": "By: Level Access\n\nPizza chain’s offerings now available to more Canadians through PizzaPizza.ca.\n\neSSENTIAL Accessibility and Level Access have merged! Read More\n\nMay 20, 2011 (Toronto) – Pizza Pizza, Canada’s leading pizza chain, announced today a new partnership with eSSENTIAL Accessibility to help extend its service to Canadians with physical disabilities. The company is the first major quick service restaurant chain to join the initiative, which is part of a Disability Community Involvement initiative sponsored by March of Dimes Canada.\n\neSSENTIAL Accessibility and March of Dimes Canada are leading this initiative by bringing organizations together to connect with and empower the disabled community in a meaningful way. The solution allows organizations to make expensive assistive technology available to all for free, thereby extending access to important online information and services to more Canadians.\n\n“Reaching out to Canadians with physical disabilities and providing this type of convenience is a very important achievement for our business, and the industry as a whole,” said Pat Finelli, chief marketing officer, Pizza Pizza. “Customers can order in our stores, through our central phone number, using the iPhone app or via our website. Now with the launch of this solution, an important new segment of the market will have a convenient way to order that works within their lifestyle.”\n\nUsers can click on the intuitive icons ( ) located on the PizzaPizza.ca homepage and use assistive technology to order their menu choices. The application is available to more than two million Canadians who have difficulty typing, moving a mouse or reading a web page. It is a virtual wheelchair for websites and empowers users with dexterity limitations that arise from a variety of conditions including stroke, paralysis, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and Parkinson’s disease. It also helps individuals who have difficulty reading because of literacy deficiencies, limited English proficiency, dyslexia, or a mild visual impairment.\n\n“Helping the disabled achieve independence is critical and that includes doing something as routine as ordering pizza online,” said Simon Dermer, managing director, eSSENTIAL Accessibility. “Pizza Pizza is a leader and the first in the Canadian quick service restaurant segment to join this initiative. They have set a precedent for others to foster inclusion and support for the disability community.”\n\n“We want to ensure all of our customers and suppliers understand this clear commitment to the initiative,” reinforced Finelli.\n\nPizza Pizza will be rolling out the program by advising its franchise partners, suppliers and employees, as well as notifying customers through its Facebook and Twitter pages.
