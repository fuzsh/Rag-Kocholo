        "text": "HAMILTON, ON (June 22, 2023): HARvEST Systems has successfully demonstrated its innovative waste heat recovery systems within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. HARvEST’s clean technology system, installed and commissioned at three Pizza Pizza locations, enables the restaurants to efficiently manage their energy usage, cut down on operating costs, and reduce emissions.\n\nDeveloped through a five-year research program at McMaster University, in partnership with Pizza Pizza Limited, the POWER (Pizza Oven Waste Energy Recovery) system is designed to repurpose waste heat from pizza ovens to offset heating needs within a restaurant and provide autonomous operations and resilience with the ability to generate electricity.\n\nHARvEST’s POWER system repurposes waste heat from Pizza ovens to offset heating needs within a restaurant.\n\nIn parallel, the integrated performance measurement and data analytics provides unmatched insight into the subtle energy interactions within a commercial kitchen, thus allowing the ability to monitor system health and measure energy savings with the integration of the POWER system. The POWER system is not just a waste heat recovery system; it is backed with the expertise and tools within HARvEST to understand energy utilization and provide high-efficiency gains within restaurants.\n\nWith support from NGIF and its Industry Grants program, HARvEST has been able to successfully build the first prototypes of the POWER system.\n\n“We are delighted to have the opportunity to move beyond the research lab and showcase the POWER system within three Pizza Pizza restaurants, each representing exhaust venting arrangements found throughout the food service industry. Being a fuel-less, carbon-free water heating system, the POWER system harvests waste heat from cooking appliances, such as ovens and fryers, resulting in lower operating costs and reduced emissions,” said James Cotton, CEO, HARvEST Systems. “The continued support from programs such as the NGIF Industry Grants is instrumental in supporting the transition of Canadian university research to commercial services, systems, and products.”\n\nNGIF Industry Grants supported this project, and I am pleased to see its successful deployment at the Pizza Pizza restaurants. HARvEST’s cleantech solution is poised to significantly reduce emissions and improve economics through direct cost savings,” said John Adams, President and CEO of NGIF Capital Corporation and Managing Partner of NGIF Cleantech Ventures. “Our Industry Grants program and its focus on de-risking clean technologies through field trials and pilots are part of NGIF’s integrated model of industry validation, customer creation, and market commercialization.”\n\n“Harvest’s POWER system can increase pizza oven’s energy efficiency and reduce operating costs for restaurants. It is exactly the type of low-carbon solution that can help our customers make a positive impact on the environment while keeping affordability in mind. Enbridge is pleased to be able to support this project through NGIF Industry Grants and its industry partners,” said Scott Dodd, Director of Business Development, Enbridge Gas.\n\n“As the initial commercial partner of McMaster and HARvEST, Pizza Pizza is proud to have played a key role in demonstrating successful proof-of-concept of this revolutionary technological innovation, which has the potential to provide ongoing environmental benefits and economic benefits for our restaurant operators across the country, a true win-win for all,” said Paul Goddard, President, and CEO, Pizza Pizza Limited.\n\n“Canadians want and need the affordable, reliable, clean energy service offering they have come to expect from the natural gas industry.
