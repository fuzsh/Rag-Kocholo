        "text": "Press Release\n\nThe Slices for Smiles program, which started on May 27th and is now in its 12th year, has returned with a twist. Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73’s Slices for Smiles Foundation is on a mission to personally deliver 10,000 slices of pizza to hospitals and local communities across the country in exchange for 10,000 children’s smiles.\n\nGoing hand in hand, Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73 encourage customers to join the fun, pay it forward and support the campaign by purchasing a small pepperoni Smile Pizza for $4.99 at their nearest participating Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73 locations. The Smile Pizza is available for one week only and a portion of the proceeds will be donated to Children’s Miracle Network. Throughout the week, the company is also inviting customers to top-off their orders with a monetary donation that will be directed in its entirety to Children’s Miracle Network.\n\n“I’m always amazed by the power of a smile on a child’s face,” Mark Hierlihy, president and CEO of the Children’s Miracle Network in Canada. “Slices for Smiles is symbolic in this quest for smiles, in that it engages Canadians across the country to enjoy a pizza while helping kids in their local community.”\n\nSimilar to past years, a portion of the proceeds from every pepperoni Smile Pizza goes to Children’s Miracle Network Canada and its member children’s hospitals across the country. Funds from each location will stay within the community in which they are raised, and support the nearest Children’s Miracle Network member hospital in that region.\n\n“As a brand we believe in paying it forward. We love our ongoing partnership and commitment with the Children’s Miracle Network, which is why we are kicking off the Slices for Smiles program by donating 10,000 slices to hospitals and communities across the country,” says Alyssa Huggins, VP marketing, Pizza Pizza. “We encourage our customers to continue the momentum and get involved in their local communities by purchasing a Smile Pizza or contributing to the Slices for Smiles Foundation.”\n\nPizza Pizza and Pizza 73 launched Slices for Smiles in 2007, and to date, have raised more than $3 million for children’s causes and Children’s Miracle Network member hospitals across Canada.\n\nFor more information on Pizza Pizza’s and Pizza 73’s fundraising initiatives or to make a donation as part of your pizza order, visit pizzapizza.ca and pizza73.com.\n\nAbout Children’s Miracle Network\n\nChildren’s Miracle Network raises funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals, 14 of which are in Canada. Donations stay local to fund critical treatments and healthcare services, pediatric medical equipment and research. Its various fundraising partners and programs support the nonprofit’s mission to save and improve the lives of as many children as possible. Find out why children’s hospitals need community support, identify your member hospital and learn how you can Put Your Money Where the Miracles Are, at childrensmiraclenetwork.ca and on Facebook.\n\nAbout Pizza Pizza Limited\n\nFor over 50 years, Pizza Pizza Limited has been guided by a vision of “always the best food, made especially for you”, with a focus on quality ingredients, customer service, continuous innovation and community involvement.
