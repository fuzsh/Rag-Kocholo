        "text": "TORONTO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Greenleaf Foods, SPC, owner of Field Roast Grain Meat Co™ (“Field Roast”), the original maker of artisan plant-based meats and cheeses and a pioneer in the plant-based industry since 1997, today announced its partnership with Canadian pizza chain and quick-serve restaurant leader, Pizza Pizza. This partnership brings Pizza Pizza’s first-ever plant-based pizza to the menu at all restaurants across Canada beginning June 24.\n\n“Always the best food, made especially for you”\n\nTweet this\n\nThe new ‘Super Plant Pizza’ will feature Field Roast’s Mexican Chipotle Sausage as a crumble. The artisanal plant-based sausage is made from grains, smoked Chipotle peppers, sweet onions, fresh-chopped garlic, apple cider vinegar, cumin seed, oregano and Chili de Arbol, creating bold flavour with a kick. The Field Roast Mexican Chipotle Sausage—along with other Field Roast plant-based meat and cheese products—is available in retail stores and natural food stores across Canada.\n\nTo complement the Field Roast crumble, the ‘Super Plant Pizza’ will also feature homestyle Italian tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and is topped with plant-based pepperoni. For an entirely vegan experience, consumers are also able to order the pizza with dairy-free vegan cheese. The new ‘Super Plant Pizza’ recipe is a delicious combination of flavours and is available on any crust, including Pizza Pizza’s newest innovation, Cauliflower Crust.\n\n“When dining out, plant-based options can seem less exciting, but we’re quickly changing that experience,” said Dan Curtin, President of Greenleaf Foods, SPC. “Now Pizza Pizza consumers don’t have to sacrifice taste because we’re bringing innovative and delicious plant-based options to the menu. We are always looking for ways to introduce more people to plant-based eating. Teaming up with Pizza Pizza will allow us to deliver our high-quality, artisanal products in new ways.”\n\nThe Field Roast brand offers plant-based meat and cheese that pay homage to regionally-beloved spices and ingredients, incorporating big, bold flavours that create a complex, layered taste experience. The brand makes it its mission to use only the finest quality, all-natural, whole food ingredients such as grains, fresh-cut vegetables, herbs and legumes. All Field Roast® products are vegan and do not contain any animal ingredients.\n\nFor more information on Field Roast, visit www.fieldroast.com and follow @FieldRoast on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
