        "text": "Pizza Pizza is game ready for one of its busiest days of the year. The company, Canada’s leader in the pizza segment of the quick service restaurant industry, is optimistic that sports fans will continue to gather around a pizza or wings order to enjoy the biggest football game of the year. In addition to logistical preparations at call centres, national promotions and advertising, Pizza Pizza introduces Buffalo-style menu items that include a new Buffalo Chicken Pizza and new sauced and tossed Buffalo chicken wings, available at all traditional Pizza Pizza locations in Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Buffalo-style additions join Pizza Pizza’s other new menu items just launched: a new chili dish prepared with seasoned ground beef, kidney beans, green peppers and simmered with tomatoes; and a classic poutine dish with fresh-cut fries, beef gravy and real cheese curds. Both menu items available for walk-in only, at $3.99 each.\n\n“Wherever people gather, there’s a pretty good chance someone is considering ordering a pizza and wings,” said Pat Finelli, Chief Marketing Officer for Pizza Pizza. “The Super Bowl may be about sports, but the parties are about friendship and camaraderie, and that’s where our product comes into play. Pizza and party favourites like chicken wings bring people together and can lighten up the mood at any gathering.”\n\nThe Super Bowl, which will be played in Indianapolis, Indiana on February 5, is traditionally the second busiest day of the year for the national pizza chain. The company expects to see over 28,000 orders processed during the peak hours of 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n\nTo beat the rush, Pizza Pizza recommends that customers place their orders online in advance of game day. Last year, the company’s restaurants across Canada sold over 40,000 pizzas and 200,000 chicken wings, which are the chain’s most popular menu items for the big game.\n\nBuffalo Chicken Pizza - $11.99 (Medium)\n\nBuffalo grilled chicken, red onions, roasted red peppers, mozzarella cheese with Pizza Pizza’s Buffalo and Blue Cheese sauce\n\nBuffalo Chicken Wings – 50 cents each (limited time offer with purchase of any pizza)\n\nSauced and tossed in Pizza Pizza’s new Buffalo sauce and seasoned with blue cheese\n\nAbout Pizza Pizza Limited\n\nFounded in 1967, Pizza Pizza Limited is Canada's pizza pioneer and one of the country’s most successful quick service restaurant chains. With its Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73 banners, the company offers a broad range of menu items that include hot and fresh pizza, gluten-free pizza, chicken wings, chicken bites, family-sized pasta, shrimp and salads. The company is guided by a mission to provide the “best food, made especially for you” with a focus on quality ingredients, customer service and continual innovation."
