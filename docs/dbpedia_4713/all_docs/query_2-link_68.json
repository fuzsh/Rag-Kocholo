        "text": "Mr. Paul Goddard reports\n\nPIZZA PIZZA ROYALTY CORP. ANNOUNCES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER and FULL YEAR RESULTS and a 3.6 per cent DIVIDEND INCREASE\n\nPizza Pizza Royalty Corp. has released its financial results for the three months and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nFourth Quarter highlights:\n\nSame store sales increased 13.0 per cent\n\nRoyalty Pool sales increased 11.2 per cent\n\nAdjusted earnings per share(5) increased 11.1 per cent\n\nWorking capital(5) reserve increased $0.5 million during the quarter to $7.5 million at December 31, 2022\n\nPayout ratio(5) was 91 per cent\n\n18 new restaurants opened\n\nMonthly cash dividend increased 3.7 per cent effective November\n\nYear-to-Date highlights:\n\nSame store sales increased 15.2 per cent\n\nRoyalty Pool sales increased 15.1 per cent\n\nAdjusted earnings per share(5) increased 14.3 per cent\n\nWorking capital(5) increased $1.0 million\n\nPayout ratio(5) was 95 per cent\n\n45 new restaurants opened\n\nMonthly cash dividend increased 16.7 per cent in 2022\n\nPaul Goddard, chief executive officer, Pizza Pizza Ltd. (PPL) said: \"Our sales increased by double digits during the year while we also opened a record 45 new restaurants. Our restaurants managed through inflationary pressures from both commodity and labour increases. The positive momentum throughout 2022 allowed for three dividend increases as walk-in and pickup sales increased significantly as pandemic restrictions were relaxed or removed, and we are pleased to announce another dividend increase surpassing our pre-COVID dividend rate. We look to continue the sales momentum by leveraging our marketing strengths while featuring our high-quality menu offerings.\"\n\nSales\n\nFor the three months ended Dec. 31, 2022, system sales from the 727 restaurants in the royalty pool increased 11.2 per cent to $153.2-million from $137.7-million in the same quarter last year when there were 725 restaurants in the royalty pool. By brand, sales from the 624 Pizza Pizza restaurants in the royalty pool increased 13.2 per cent to $132.1-million for the quarter compared with $116.7-million in the same quarter last year. Sales from the 103 Pizza 73 restaurants increased 0.4 per cent to $21.1-million for the quarter compared with $21.0-million in the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2022, royalty pool system sales for the year increased 15.1 per cent to $568.3-million from $493.6-million in the same period last year. By brand for the year, sales from the 624 Pizza Pizza restaurants in the royalty pool increased 17.7 per cent to $490.6-million compared with $416.9-million in the prior year. Sales from the 103 Pizza 73 restaurants increased 1.2 per cent to $77.7-million compared with $76.7-million in 2021.\n\nFor the quarter and year, the increase in royalty pool system sales is primarily driven by the increase in same-store sales and the full reopening of the economy, and many non-traditional locations reopening as the year progressed. Additionally, while the number of restaurants in the royalty pool increased in 2022, it remains less than 2019 when there were 772 restaurants in the royalty pool. The negative impact on royalty pool system sales due to prior-year restaurant closures has been mitigated by the make-whole carryover amount.\n\nSame-store sales growth (SSSG)\n\nSSSG, the key driver of yield growth for shareholders of the company, increased 13.0 per cent (2021: 12.4 per cent) for the quarter and 15.2 per cent (2021: 0.5 per cent) for the year.\n\nSSSG is driven by the change in the customer check and customer traffic, both of which are affected by changes in pricing and sales mix. During the quarter and year, the average customer check increased as the brands successfully passed along retail price increases largely related to commodity and labour increases. At Pizza Pizza, for the quarter and year, the increase in SSSG was driven by consumers significantly increasing restaurant visits compared with the prior year partially due to the lifting of COVID-19-related public health restrictions. Sales also benefited from value messages and promotional brand activities, plus the reopening of non-traditional locations as well as students returning to in-person classes. At Pizza 73, which depends heavily on pizza delivery versus in-store visits, the SSSG was adversely affected by customers preparing more meals at home plus competition from third party food delivery apps resulting in a decline in overall customer orders.\n\nMonthly dividend and working capital reserve\n\nSubsequent to the quarter-end, with the reported strong SSSG and working capital, the board of directors approved a 3.6-per-cent increase in the monthly dividend, from seven cents to 7.25 cents per share, effective March, 2023. The dividend will be payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2023, and will be paid on April 14, 2023.\n\nThe Company declared shareholder dividends of $5.1-million for the Quarter, or $0.2075 per share, compared with $4.4-million, or $0.180 per share, for the prior year comparable quarter. The payout ratio is 91 per cent for the Quarter and was 87 per cent in the prior year, comparable quarter.\n\nThe Company declared shareholder dividends of $19.6-million for the Year, or $0.7975 per share, compared with $16.9-million, or $0.685 per share, for the prior year comparable period. The payout ratio is 95 per cent for 2022 and was 94 per cent in 2021.\n\nThe Company's policy is to distribute all available cash in order to maximize returns to shareholders over time, after allowing for reasonable reserves. Despite seasonal variants inherent to the restaurant industry, the Company's policy is to make equal dividend payments to shareholders on a monthly basis in order to smooth out income to shareholders.\n\nThe Company's working capital reserve is $7.5-million at December 31, 2022, which is an increase of $0.5-million in the Quarter due to the 91 per cent payout ratio. With the increase in the monthly dividend in February, June and November 2022 and March 2023, the Company believes that there is sufficient cash flow to service the Company's obligations as they fall due, while also increasing the monthly dividend above its pre-COVID levels.\n\nThe reserve is available to stabilize dividends and fund other expenditures in the event of short- to medium-term variability in System Sales and, thus, the Company's royalty income. The Company has historically targeted a payout ratio at or near 100 per cent on an annualized basis. See \"Dividends\".\n\nCREDIT FACILITY\n\nOn June 28, 2019, the Partnership amended and extended its $47-million credit facility with a syndicate of chartered banks from April 2020 to April 2025. The credit facility bears interest at the Canadian Bankers' Acceptance rate plus a credit spread between 0.875 per cent to 1.375 per cent, depending on the level of debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), with EBITDA defined as annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nIn April 2020 the facility interest was at an effective interest rate of 2.685 per cent comprised of a fixed rate of 1.81 per cent plus a credit spread of 0.875 per cent through to March 31, 2021. In April 2021, the credit spread increased to 1.125 per cent pursuant to the table described below, raising the combined interest rate to 2.935 per cent. In April 2022, the credit spread decreased as the impact of COVID-19 lessened and earnings improved, the effective interest rate decreased to 2.685 per cent.\n\nCURRENT INCOME TAX EXPENSE\n\nCurrent income tax expense for the Quarter increased to $1.7-million from $1.5-million. For the Year, current income tax increased to $6.1-million from $5.2-million. The increase for the Quarter and Year are a result of the increase in the Company's earnings before income taxes.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS)\n\nFully diluted basic EPS increased 15.3 per cent to 20.75 cents for the quarter compared with the prior-year comparable quarter and increased 16.4 per cent to 79.75 cents for the year.\n\nAs compared with basic EPS, the Company considers Adjusted EPS(5) to be a more meaningful indicator of the Company's operating performance and, therefore, presents fully-diluted, adjusted EPS. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 11.2 per cent to 23.8 cents when compared with the same period in 2021 and increased 14.4 per cent to 88.3 cents for the year.\n\nRESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT\n\nAs announced earlier this year, the number of restaurants in the Company's Royalty Pool increased by two locations to 727 on the January 1, 2022 Adjustment Date, and consists of 624 Pizza Pizza restaurants and 103 Pizza 73 restaurants. The number of restaurants in the Royalty Pool will remain unchanged through December 31, 2022.\n\nDuring the Quarter, PPL opened 10 traditional Pizza Pizza restaurants, including four openings in British Columbia, three in Nova Scotia, two in Quebec and one in New Brunswick, and opened eight non-traditional Pizza Pizza restaurants. PPL closed one traditional and two non-traditional Pizza Pizza restaurants. At the Pizza 73 brand, PPL had no openings and closed one non-traditional restaurant.\n\nDuring the Year, PPL opened 24 traditional and 19 non-traditional Pizza Pizza restaurants, and closed eight traditional and 16 non-traditional restaurants, the majority of which were smaller movie theatre venues. Additionally, at the Pizza 73 brand, PPL opened one traditional and one non-traditional restaurant, closed four non-traditional restaurants, and converted two Pizza 73 traditional restaurants into Pizza Pizza restaurants.\n\nNew restaurant construction continues across Canada as PPL executes on its national expansion plan. PPL management expects to grow its traditional network by 3 to 4 per cent in 2023; its franchisee pipeline remains strong and its renovation program will continues through 2023.\n\nReaders should note that the number of restaurants added to the Royalty Pool each year may differ from the number of restaurant openings and closings reported by PPL on an annual basis as the periods for which they are reported differ slightly.\n\nSELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe following tables set out selected financial information and other data of Pizza Pizza Royalty Corp.
