It is the official pizza of the Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, WHL Saskatoon Blades, NLL Saskatoon Rush and Saskatoon Exhibition, and has become a regular contributor to the local children’s hospital, Jim Pattison Children’s Hospital Foundation in Saskatoon, through the Pizza 73 Slices for Smiles program."
