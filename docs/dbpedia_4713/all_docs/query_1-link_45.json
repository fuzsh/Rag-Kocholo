In the era of the fast-paced at-home lifestyle, QSRs have managed to satisfy a fundamental need in today’s social climate. The ability to order hot-and-ready meals through the digital space has become a crucial pillar for QSRs. \nWhy Invest in a QSR Franchise? \n\nRestaurants Canada predicts the need for at-home delivery and online ordering to continue and thrive over the next five years, especially with more and more QSRs developing an online presence. According to Restaurants Canada, the Canadian commercial food service industry is expected to grow substantially throughout 2022 and overcome its nominal 2020 decline by a whopping 74.6 billion dollars— a 22 percent increase over the year 2021. By 2025, quick service restaurants are forecasted to grow to 37.4 billion dollars in Canada alone. \nAccording to Restaurant Canada’s Foodservice Industry Forecast, the Canadian QRS industry is primed to undergo modern and digital changes to grow and excel over the next five years; QRSs are expected to lead growth in the short term by seizing opportunities on digital platforms coupled with decreasing rental costs for metropolitan real-estate. Some new trends that can be expected within the QRS industry include smaller, more intimate locations for easier consumer access and carbon footprint management, simpler menu options, and healthier alternatives to traditional meals to satisfy different consumer needs. These trends are incredibly positive for future QSR brands that focus on simple meals.",
