        "text": "When you move to a new city, you try out some new restaurants right? Well the family and I ran out to Westgate Mall yesterday and everyone was hungry afterwards.\n\nSo we hooked a left on Soncy and looked for a place we'd never been before. Enter Walk*On's Sports Bistreaux. It looked like the perfect place for us. Lots of sports on TV and with the way Bistreaux was spelled, it screamed Cajun style food. We were sold.\n\nFROM THE STREET\n\nA big sign greets you from half a mile away. You can see this clearly coming down Soncy to announce they are there and ready to hook you up with some grub. Bright and loud, it's an immediate attention getter. Nice work, you sucked us in.\n\nENTRANCE\n\nWhen you are walking in from the parking lot, a message on the brick outside will tell you exactly what you're getting into. This confirmed it was exactly what we were hoping it would be. All the sports you can take with Cajun style food that my family loves.\n\nBAR\n\nThis is what I'm talking about. Look at all those TV's with sports on em! A solid selection of beer on tap along with a fully stocked bar greets you to your left. It's inviting and draws you in immediately. I could see myself spending Sundays there during football season.\n\nFOOD\n\nAlright, let's get down to it. The menu was placed in front of us and we realized it was going to be a challenge to decide what to get. A lot of Cajun favorites like Crawfish Etouffee, fried catfish, Cajun inspired pasta were prevalent on the menu. Yes, they have some other favorites like sandwiches and burgers for those who aren't huge fans of the Cajun food.\n\nI ended up settling on the fried catfish and fries. When it came out, I was pleasantly surprised at what was on my plate. A HUGE portion to start with, so much so I've got lunch for the next day before I even start eating. The catfish came out in strips, so you could eat them as finger food if you so desire. I immediately dive in. The catfish is fried perfectly and has great flavor. Could've maybe used a little seasoning, but overall I came away happy with the catfish.\n\nOn to the fries...this is where it gets a little dicey. My youngest makes a comment, \"these fries taste stale dad\". He wasn't wrong. A good portion of them were definitely dry and chewy. No crunch and not light and fluffy like you hope on the inside. I hand one to my wife and her assessment was \"they almost taste freezer burnt\". I think that's the best way to put it. 3 out of 4 of us ended up with fries with their meal, and we all ultimately passed on eating pretty much any of them. Bummer, we all love some french fries.\n\nMy oldest got himself a bacon burger which he pretty much slammed down. If he doesn't speak and he just eats, it's probably pretty solid. He's a picky one, so I'm gonna say the burger was a winner.\n\nMy wife went with the soup and salad option. Crawfish Etouffee for the soup, Caesar salad on the other side. The Etouffee at first bite almost tasted as if it came out of a can, but give it a second and the flavor really popped. That saved it in my opinion because that initial bite threw me off a bit. The salad was ok, crunchy leaves on the top, but pretty limp and soggy on the bottom.\n\nMy youngest got the same thing I did, so no need to rehash that one.\n\nOVERALL\n\nOur final bill came out to $85. 4 meals, 2 appetizers, 2 beers and 3 soft drinks. Not overly bad, but felt a little pricey when you break down the quality of the food. I'm not opposed to going back and giving it another shot, but we'll all definitely be getting something that doesn't involve fries. However, I still see this being one of my go-to spots if I wanna hit the bar and watch a game or two."
