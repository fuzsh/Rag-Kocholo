        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nSince the mid-1980's, obesity increased dramatically across developed countries, such as the U.S., U.K., New Zealand, and Canada (World Health Organization, 2011) with socioeconomically disadvantaged populations disproportionately affected (McLaren, 2007; Ministry of Health, 2004). At the same time, a literature (albeit somewhat mixed) has developed suggesting a role for neighborhood SES in the availability of healthy foods, with lower SES communities having comparatively lower access to higher quality food sources (Block et al., 2004; Moore and Diez Roux, 2006; Morland and Filomena, 2007). Consequently, efforts to improve dietary behaviors and reduce obesity have targeted neighborhood restaurants, especially fast food restaurants, and lack of quality food stores in disadvantaged areas (Let's Move, 2012; The Food Trust, 2004). Yet, most of the evidence is based on cross-sectional studies that focused on a single part of the pathway, either direct associations for food stores and restaurants with dietary behaviors or with body mass index (BMI) (Caspi et al., 2012; Giskes et al., 2011). The extent to which changing food environments lead to individual-level dietary change and consequent reduction in obesity, through diet, is unknown.\n\nInternational researchers suggest that comprehensive strategies are needed to address environmental and societal factors to reduce obesity disparities (Foresight, 2007; World Health Organization, 2013) Yet, socioeconomically disadvantaged subpopulations in developed countries remain disproportionately affected by obesity (McLaren, 2007; Ministry of Health, 2004). Thus, researchers have begun to examine how temporal changes in food environments impact diet and obesity (Burgoine et al., 2009; Cummins et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2010). But findings are mixed and studies examining temporal patterns in food environments are sparse [see review (Mackenbach et al., 2014)]. A large gap remains in long-term, population-based research in racially diverse samples with detailed time-varying food environment data.\n\nCross-sectional studies cannot link changes in neighborhood environments with changes in individual-level diet and body weight (Gary-Webb et al., 2010). The few longitudinal studies (Block et al., 2011; Boone-Heinonen et al., 2011; Gibson, 2011) have generally examined associations between a single type of restaurant or food store with a single outcome, such as BMI, obesity, or a broad diet behavior (e.g., diet quality) (Moore et al., 2009). Moreover, we posit that food stores and restaurants do not influence dietary behaviors in isolation; rather, alternative food resources within the same neighborhood may also be important. New approaches to modeling complex pathways that simultaneously account for multiple food store and restaurant options may help explain inconsistent findings in the literature on neighborhood environment and BMI (Ball et al., 2012; Mackenbach et al., 2014).\n\nWhile neighborhood food stores and restaurants may influence obesity indirectly through dietary behaviors, presence of neighborhood food stores and restaurants may also relate to other neighborhood resources, such as street networks, presence of parks or other obesity-related amenities (Belon et al., 2014; Tseng et al., 2014). This necessitates control for a variety of other neighborhood characteristics through pathway-based approaches. Yet, a majority of research ignores complex pathways, instead using simple direct association. Use of simultaneous regression modeling via systems of equations may help clarify hypothesized pathways.\n\nWe used a single longitudinal structural equation model (SEM) in a large United States (U.S.)-based prospective cohort of adult black and white adults over 20 years to estimate simultaneous and separate pathways from neighborhood fast food restaurants, sit-down restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores to individual-level diet behaviors and BMI. We have two central hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: neighborhood restaurants and food stores are indirectly associated with BMI through the consumption of specific foods typically acquired from specific types of restaurants and foods stores; and Hypothesis 2: associations between restaurants and food stores with dietary behaviors and BMI become stronger over time due to the increase in restaurants and food stores over time (Economic Research Service - USDA, 2004; Lenard, 2012; National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), 2011; National Restaurant Association, 2013; The Reinvestment Fund, 2011) and the increase in away-from-home eating (Duffey et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2014; Zick and Stevens, 2006). We quantified indirect pathways from fast food restaurants, sit-down restaurants, supermarkets, and convenience stores to BMI, through consumption of specific foods typically acquired at each type of food resource. We also included direct pathways between fast food restaurants, sit-down restaurants, supermarkets, and convenience stores to BMI to capture neighborhood effects that occur through unmeasured factors that are independent of diet.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nUsing SEM, environmental- and individual-level data spanning two decades in the U.S., we found that pathways from neighborhood restaurants to BMI might operate through higher consumption of an obesogenic fast food-type diet (e.g., French fries and sugar sweetened beverages). Living near fast food restaurants was associated with greater consumption of foods typically consumed at fast food restaurants, while living near sit-down restaurants was associated with lower consumption of a fast food-type diet. Yet, we found no direct or indirect pathways from neighborhood supermarkets and convenience stores to BMI through dietary behaviors.\n\nResearch on the food environment, dietary behaviors, and body weight has proliferated over the past several years, yet most of this literature is cross-sectional and ignores multiple direct and indirect pathways from different types of restaurants and food stores to BMI through dietary behaviors (Ball et al., 2012; Hattori et al., 2013; Kegler et al., 2014; Pruchno et al., 2014). Further, the bulk of the literature involves a black box-step from the food environment to BMI and is largely mixed [see reviews (Giskes et al., 2011; Mackenbach et al., 2014)]. Inconsistent findings in the literature might relate to patterning by neighborhood SES (Baker et al., 2006; Borrell et al., 2004; Carson et al., 2007; Kershaw et al., 2010; Morland et al., 2002a; Morland et al., 2002b; Author et al., 2012; Author et al., in press; Zenk et al., 2005), by individual-level SES (Author et al., 2011) or by geographic location (Ahern et al., 2011; Sharkey et al., 2009). However, none of these studies accounted for complex pathways from neighborhood fast food restaurants, sit-down restaurants, supermarkets, and convenience stores to BMI through dietary behaviors.\n\nOur findings support our hypothesis that fast food restaurants impact weight gain through diet behaviors. In contrast, in one of the few longitudinal studies in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, Block et al. (2011) found no consistent association between neighborhood fast food and full-service restaurants with BMI. Yet, Block et al. (2011) used distance to nearest outlet to characterize the food environment, rather than the range of alternative neighborhood restaurants and food stores that we considered in our study. In (Author et al., 2011), we used longitudinal CARDIA data to examine fast food restaurant and supermarket availability in separate models where each model did not account for the availability of other restaurants and food stores. In the current study, we accounted for separate pathways in one model from fast food restaurants, sit-down restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores to dietary behaviors hypothesized to be associated with restaurants, food stores and BMI.\n\nWe did not expect to find that higher numbers of sit-down restaurants could lead to reduced BMI through reduced consumption of foods typically consumed at fast food restaurants. While sit-down restaurants offer some of the same foods and beverages as fast food restaurants they typically offer a wider variety of foods with less obesogenic options (e.g., vegetables). It is also possible that presence of sit-down restaurants may reflect unmeasured features of the neighborhood.\n\nCounter to our hypothesis, we found no statistically significant pathways from neighborhood supermarkets and convenience stores to BMI (either directly or through diet behaviors). In (Author et al., in press), we found that the most socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods (compared to socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods) had consistently greater numbers of convenience stores, despite similar numbers of supermarkets.\n\nThe lack of pathways from supermarkets to BMI in our study suggests that the number of supermarkets in a neighborhood, regardless of the SES of that neighborhood, does not substantially relate to diet behaviors or BMI. This finding could relate to the rise in new food and beverage products from the mid-1990s through 2010 offered in food stores [e.g., candy and snacks] (Economic Research Service - USDA, 2013), which could allow consumers to purchase a fast food-style diet from supermarkets, particularly given that supermarkets and convenience stores sell a mix of unhealthy and healthy food options (Bodor et al., 2010; Gustafson et al., 2013; Hutchinson et al., 2012; Rose et al., 2010).\n\nWe found very few direct pathways from food environments to BMI. After accounting for indirect pathways from neighborhood restaurants and food stores to BMI through diet, direct pathways from neighborhood food environments to BMI did not contribute consistently to BMI. Findings from our model suggest that associations in previous studies between food environments and BMI (Mehta and Chang, 2008; Pruchno et al., 2014), reflect a combination of measured and unmeasured direct and indirect pathways. In addition, we did not find strong evidence that baseline BMI is associated with future dietary behaviors 7 or 13 years later.\n\nOur study has limitations. Electronic business record data (e.g., D&B) are vulnerable to geospatial inaccuracy and misclassification (Bader et al., 2010; Fleischhacker et al., 2012). A ground-truthed study in Chicago and surrounding suburban/rural Census tracts found higher validity (D&B business listings compared to ground-truthed food store and restaurant locations) in white versus predominantly black race Census tracts and in high compared to low-to-middle income tracts (Powell et al., 2011). However differences could relate to urbanicity. The CARDIA study recruited participants from four major U.S. cities and after 20 years, over 90% of them were still living either in or less than a mile away from an urban area. Therefore, differential misclassification in our data by urbanicity is not likely.\n\nWe lacked diet history data from exam years 10 and 15, yet sensitivity models comparing three versus five exam years of fast food visit data indicated similar patterns of association between restaurants and BMI through dietary behaviors. Dietary recall may be biased; however, we had repeated measures of diet from three exam periods spanning 20 years. To facilitate model convergence we categorized dietary behaviors into low, medium, and high. However, this approach may miss temporal changes that reflect food environmental influences of diet and BMI. This could bias our findings either towards or away from the null.\n\nResidential location choice is complex and driven by more than dietary preferences. However, individual diet preferences and behaviors may be tied to unobserved characteristics (e.g., health consciousness) that underlie an individual's residential location. Not accounting for this path (individual influence on environment) might bias any paths we estimate in the other direction (environment influence on individual), which requires a model of substantial recursive complexity that allows for individual variation and warrants future research.\n\nWe hypothesized that the associations between the food environment, diet, and BMI operate concurrently, so we did not include pathways from the food environment to outcomes at later exams, except through tracking of the food environment over time. Our rationale stems from the fact that at a single point in time a person is only able to consume foods that are present at that same point in time. Certainly neighborhoods today are a function of their past and people may tend to live in similar types of neighborhoods over time. Therefore, we include autoregressive pathways that account for the tracking of food environments over time. We did not include pathways from current food stores and restaurants to future diet behaviors. However, we allowed neighborhood SES to have a temporal influence because people may experience neighborhood SES changes over time as their neighborhoods change or as they move to new neighborhoods. Using this approach we controlled for the participant's longitudinal residential SES history.\n\nWe did not use raw counts of restaurant and food store in our main model because they may reflect commercial development and can create spurious associations. For example, low SES neighborhoods located in dense inner-city areas may have more convenience stores than high SES neighborhoods because they have more businesses in general, and not necessarily because of disparities in the food environment. Commercial development, dense and connected roadways, and population density can track together as businesses and infrastructure respond to population demand for and access to businesses. Thus, to separate restaurant and food store disparities from other contextual features of the neighborhoods, we addressed commercial development by scaling food resource measures by roadway length and controlling for population density. While we did not use network buffers, we addressed differences in food resources according to overall commercial activity by scaling counts by roadway length while holding Euclidean area constant across geographic areas varying in terrain and network distances. Thus, the resources relative to roadway lengths provides measures relative to road network, whereas the Euclidean buffers provide the salient geographic area of focus.\n\nThe above modeling approach allows us to compare neighborhood disparities across a spectrum of population and commercial densities. Access is a complex construct as it reflects more than just simple availability of stores and restaurants (e.g., store sizes may be larger in more dense areas). In sensitivity analyses, we replaced roadway-scaled counts of restaurants and food stores with straight counts. In general, findings were similar using counts except that the estimated effects of restaurants on dietary behaviors were attenuated. We opted for the roadway scaled measures (Romley et al., 2007) in the central analysis as we wished to account for commercial development and potential routes of travel. Indeed, that we observed stronger associations between restaurants and dietary behaviors using roadway-scaled relative to those using straight counts may reflect that access to restaurants along roadways may play a role in eating away-from-home. However, we acknowledge that there may remain unmeasured differences in access by commercial development or other social or economic factors. Nonetheless our count results shown in the Web Fig. 2a and b provide policy relevance in terms of a true count of physical restaurants and food stores.\n\nTesting a linear trend over time in the estimated effect of food environment on BMI is not feasible in the SEM context. However, we can examine how the effect sizes of the associations between the food environments, dietary behaviors and BMI change over time. If a linear trend exists then we would expect the effects sizes to increase in magnitude as the exam year increased. We did not observe evidence that the effect of the food environments on BMI increased over time. Our findings do not support a linear trend of the food environment on obesity from young to late adulthood.\n\nWe assumed our estimates were not confounded by unmeasured factors, but sensitivity methods to address unmeasured bias (VanderWeele, 2010) do not exist for longitudinal SEMs. Thus, unmeasured confounding could bias our estimates away from or towards the null. Lastly, we present one causal model but there may be other valid causal models. While our findings shed light on the mechanism of how the food environment influences diet and BMI, they do not definitively clarify the underlying relationships between diet behaviors, restaurants and food stores.\n\nDespite these limitations, this study had several strengths, including using a large and unique GIS capturing multiple types of neighborhood restaurants and food stores, spatial characteristics, and demographics, with detailed diet and anthropometric data. We modeled latent factors and hypothesized causal relationships with longitudinal data from a large cohort during early- to late-adulthood. We used multiple dietary behaviors we hypothesized would be associated with restaurants and food stores. We included separate direct and indirect (through dietary behaviors) associations from neighborhood food stores and restaurants on BMI. We accounted for other restaurant (fast food versus sit-down) and food store (supermarkets versus convenience stores) options. While we controlled for physical activity which declined over time there are other factors that could contribute to weight gain over 13 years, such as previous BMI, race/ethnicity, and SES. All are accounted for in our model. In addition, age is related to dietary behaviors and BMI, thus we included baseline age as a confounder of dietary behaviors and BMI. How people interact with their environments, what and where they choose to purchase and consume food is complex. Traditional regression models of a single exposure and a single outcome cannot capture these complexities. Pathway-based modeling is a step towards disentangling which features of the food environment should be modified to influence dietary behaviors and improve health outcomes."
