        "text": "3 hours ago, Matthew.Taylor said:\n\nThat looks a whole lot like the pizza there! Judging by what pizza sauce they serve with their breadsticks, I believe the sauce is tomato paste based, so that’s something I know. I found a recipe for a focaccia type pizza dough, and I’ve heard Adriatico’s referred to that for awhile. It may be awhile before I can test it (I work a lot of overtime, and come home late a lot), but these are all good ideas. Thanks very much!\n\nAdriatico's is not a focaccia type of dough. It's going to have much less water than a focaccia- and there's a really good chance that it will use stronger flour as well. Also, while there's nothing wrong with Grandma or Detroit style pizza, Adriatico's isn't Grandma or Detroit either.\n\nIt is a little Prince Street Pizza-ish, which is what Kenji was trying to replicate in the Serious Eats recipe posted above. Had Kenji actually succeeded in making his clone, that might have been a good jumping off point for you, but, unfortunately, Kenji being Kenji, he misses the mark entirely.\n\nI've been doing a little more digging. In Adriatico's FAQ, it says that pizzas take \"20-30 minutes to prepare and cook on average.\" That doesn't give us an exact bake time, but it helps.\n\nI'm beginning to get a sense of where to start with an Adriatico's clone, but, I'd rather not guess at things (like flour) that you might be able to figure out with a trip there. One other important piece of reconnaissance you can do would be to buy a dough ball. Most pizzerias will sell dough, on it's own. Hopefully, they do as well.\n\nEverything hinges on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go. If you really love Adriatico's and want to invest time and energy recreating it at home, I can help you get there. But if you just want to be able to make a good square slice, without getting into too much complexity, then I think Detroit might be the way to go. It won't have Adriatico's crunchy exterior, but it will still be pretty good. Another option might be an existing Prince Street clone- created by someone that actually knows how to make pizza. But that might get a bit more involved than Detroit.\n\nIt all depends on how serious you are about recreating Adriatico's and how much time you're able to put into it.\n\nEdited December 12, 2021 by scott123 (log)\n\n13 hours ago, Matthew.Taylor said:\n\nOh I definitely want to recreate it, buying a dough ball never crossed my mind when I was there last. 20-30 minutes, huh? I wonder if that includes making the dough?\n\nMy time is rather limited at the moment though, due to heavy seasonal overtime at work, but I’ll put in what time I can. Any help you can give will be appreciated.\n\nThe 20-30 minutes definitely doesn't include making the dough. Dough takes a while. It has to mix, and then proof. The vast majority of pizzerias don't proof the dough for very long, but it's almost always at least an hour. Making the dough in the morning, and then having it available throughout the day is pretty common. If a place is churning out an extraordinarily high number of pies, then they might make multiple batches of dough during the day. Pan pizza typically has an extra proof in the pan. Even that's not included in the 20-30 minutes. The 20-30 minutes is most likely just for topping and baking.\n\nI'm about 98% certain that Adriatico's is using the same dough for all their pizzas. When you ask for the dough ball, if they just give you dough, you might ask if it's the bearcat (large sicilian) dough or if it's for NY. They might then confirm that it's all the same- which, to an extent, helps a little bit.\n\nPictures help. Photos of the dough ball, if you can get a closeup/macro of their crumb (cross section of a slice), that will tell us a bit about the dough. If you can film yourself stretching the dough into the pan, that would be nice. Definitely weigh the dough. Also, you'll need to get the dimensions of the pizza so you can get the right size pan.\n\nWhen you go, look for bags of flour. From photos, it doesn't look like the kitchen is exposed, but they might store the flour someplace visible. Go to the bathroom. Sometimes you can catch a glimpse of things on the way to the bathroom. See how accessible the dumpster is. Pizzerias have been known to get angry at folks looking through their trash, so this is something you want to be careful about, and, if it's not accessible and/or you feel like there's a chance you might get caught, then don't do it. Occasionally, though, folks have clocked dumpsters and found various refuse to the side or the covers have been open and the contents were fairly quickly and easily identified. Obviously, bring your camera\n\nAs I said before, Prince Street is probably going to be pretty close, and, fortunately, Prince has had a lot of exposure over the years. I'd take a look at these videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoEzahr_QU (Do not follow the presenter's recipe, just watch the stuff they film in the pizzeria).\n\nThis shows you the pan (they call it iron, but it's a steel pan), it shows him stretching the dough, and it shows how they proof the dough in the pan- and how the dough looks after it's been proofed.\n\nThis gives you another glimpse:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEJLHopLTCc\n\nOther than Kenji's ill fated attempt, there really is no existing recipe. This covers some fairly broad strokes:\n\nhttps://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=59014.0\n\nObviously, once you have something Prince-ish, it will need tweaking to make it more Adriatico's-ish, but Prince is a good starting point.\n\nBut, first, recon. They might not sell dough, the kitchen/flour might be entirely closed off and the dumpster could very well be off limits. If you strike out completely, it's not the end of the world, but, recon is absolutely worth a shot.\n\n16 hours ago, Matthew.Taylor said:\n\nThe flour they use is All-purpose\n\nAre you certain? Was this something a waitperson told you or did you catch a glimpse of a bag of flour?\n\nDid you inquire about buying dough?\n\nThere's two seeds at the bottom of the photo of the sauce. Also, in the pizza photos there's the occasional fleshy bit of non-paste tomato. In NY, a few places will combine paste with canned tomatoes. This could be what Adriatico's is doing. If it is a combo, it might also be cooked. Cooking is a lot of labor, so you don't find it that often, but, some places cook their sauce.\n\nAre you sure that the dipping sauce is the same sauce that's on the pizza? It's hard to tell, but, it almost appears like the sauce on the pizza might be a tiny bit wetter. I've seen places in my area that will give you a different sauce for dipping than they do for the pies- the dipping sauce is usually more of a pasta sauce.\n\nReally nice photos."
