        "text": "People from all over the world come to British Columbia to hike its many forested trails and take pictures of its towering mountains and bright blue lakes.\n\nWhen they check their maps, those names are often in English, the language of British Columbia's colonial settlers.\n\nThat got Jared Qwustenuxun Williams wondering whether First Nation — Quw'utsun, in the Cowichan Valley, a region just north of Victoria on Vancouver Island — had different names for prominent places that aren't used today.\n\n\"When you look at the lakes or the hills or everything, you only see colonial names,\" Williams said. \"It's really a disconnecting.\"\n\nWilliams uses his YouTube and social media channels to teach the Hul'q'umi'num names of geographical places around the valley, such as Swuq'us, which is known as Mount Prevost, near Duncan. It's named after a British settler James Charles Prevost.\n\nWilliams says the mountain was named by one of Quw'utsun's first ancestors, Stutsun, who was dropped there by the creator.\n\nAs Williams tells the story, Stutsun was very lonely and asked the creator for a friend. That's when he found a dog in a cave on the mountain. The dog had a condition that made it walk with its nose pointing to the sky.\n\nStutsun named the dog Swuq'us, after the condition, and when the dog died, he buried it at the top of the mountain.\n\nKnowing the traditional name for Swuq'us says a lot about the relationship between the place, its people and history, Williams says.\n\n\"Everything here has a name, and each one of them has a history that really connects us to the land,\" Williams said.\n\nWilliams highlights popular locations in his videos, often consulting with elders who might remember their Indigenous names.\n\n\"Only recently has the world wanted to hear this, and so there's not a lot of existing resources,\" Williams said.\n\nAcknowledging Indigenous place names confronts the colonial history that replaced them, Williams says. \"Once we can overcome that, I think it'll be easy to get all these names returned.\"\n\nHow do geographical places get named?\n\nNaming geographical places, such as mountains and lakes, became formalized in 1897 with the creation of the Geographic Board of Canada — now called the the Geographical Names Board of Canada.\n\nIn 1961 the board transferred to the provinces the power to name their jurisdictions.\n\n\"When settlers first came, they tended to apply names that referenced people or events or places from the countries that they had come from,\" said Genevieve Weber, manager of programs and services with the BC Heritage Branch.\n\n\"So sometimes those names had connections to what they were doing on the land, but often they did not.\"\n\nAt some point the names used by settlers became common, because surveys marked them on a map or some other document that helped direct people, Weber says.\n\nThese places were then formally recorded at the geographical names office, becoming the official names used today.\n\n\"Another very common … way of coming up with names in British Columbia are anglicized versions of Indigenous names,\" Weber said.\n\nHowever, Weber says the names office can change the official name of places, and often does.\n\nChanging names neither quick nor easy\n\n\"The vast majority of place-name changes that we receive are from Indigenous communities that have often done a lot of research and work leading up to them putting in their request,\" Weber said.\n\nHowever, such changes are neither quick nor easy, and the burden lies on individuals or communities to demand the change.\n\nWeber says the geographical names policy does not allow the office to propose new site names, which would be an unfair use of authority. Instead, the office reacts to requests for name changes.\n\nRecently, the Squamish Nation asked for Mount Garibaldi, about 90 kilometres north of Vancouver, to be officially recognized by its Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim name \"Nch'ḵay̓\" (in-ch-KAY).\n\nThe process for a name change can take between six months to a year once a request is received, Weber says.\n\nThis triggers a consultation process where surrounding First Nations, municipalities and stakeholding organizations are informed of the request and can weigh in on the change.\n\nWeber says the process ensures the department can listen to all the communities involved without rushing the process.\n\n\"Naming is a really, really important part of culture and connecting people to the culture,\" Weber said.\n\nKnowing the people behind place names matters\n\n\"We have to think about how these different state actors are memorialized in the places that we live, and how in a lot of circumstances, they're also part of the colonial project and part of the really unjust history involving Indigenous peoples,\" said Christina Gray, a Ts'msyen from Lax Kw'alaams and Dene, and a lawyer and fellow at the Yellowhead Institute who wrote Reclaiming Indigenous Place Names.\n\nGray points to places named after Joseph Trutch, B.C.'s first lieutenant governor who was known for racist policies against Indigenous people, drastically reducing the size of reserves and refusing to let Indigenous people purchase land from non-Indigenous people.\n\nCity councils in Victoria and Vancouver have moved to rename streets named after Trutch.\n\nHowever, this falls outside the jurisdiction of the geographical names office, which lists a Mount Trutch near the B.C.-Alberta border, Trutch Creek in northeastern B.C., and Trutch Island, about 625 kilometres north of Vancouver.\n\n\"There's so many examples of, like, the violence against Indigenous peoples that are embedded in the places that we live,\" Gray said."
