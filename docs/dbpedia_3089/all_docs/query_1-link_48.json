It serves as the main federal government office for Edmonton and a significant portion of Western Canada. The building is notable for its distinctive pink color and stepped design, which is intended to evoke the shape of the maple leaf on the Canadian flag. Positioned adjacent to the Edmonton Convention Centre, Canada Place offers striking views over the North Saskatchewan River valley, contributing to its prominence in the cityscape.\n\nThe structure consists of two office blocks that step down from 15 to 13 stories, connected by a central atrium.
