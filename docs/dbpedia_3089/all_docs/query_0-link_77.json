        "text": "The North Bay waterfront now has a new, inclusive spot for residents and visitors alike to gather.\n\nOfficially opened on Canada Day, the space known as \"North Bay Canada Place,\" is located across from the pedestrian underpass on Memorial Drive, alongside Lake Nipissing.\n\nNorth Bay Canada Place is billed as an “inclusive gathering space featuring an accessible pathway, a large maple leaf design, integrated into the paving stones, and two flag poles.”\n\nLarge blocks nestled against a grassy wall, make for a natural seating area.\n\nNipissing-Timiskaming MP Anthony Rota, representatives of Nipissing First Nation, and members of the Heritage Gardeners joined North Bay Mayor Peter Chirico for the official opening.\n\nThe mayor explained that the project is a culmination of a couple of years of hard work.\n\n“A couple of years ago at Canada 150 there was funding available to do a project like this in recognition of Canada. So, we applied and received funding, but it took a little while to figure out where, how and when to do it. But this council got it done,” explained Chirico.\n\n“At the end of the day, we had the full unanimous support of council to move ahead with this. This recognizes Canada. This recognizes a great meeting place on the shores of our beautiful lake.”\n\nChirico went on to say the space represents unity and respect.\n\n“By flying the Nipissing First Nation’s flag on the shore of Lake Nipissing, in their traditional territory, we honour our neighbours and recognize their contributions to our community.”\n\nHolding the official opening on Canada Day was no coincidence.\n\nThe day means something different to everyone, but the opening was to reflect that “we all share the lands and a commitment to truth and reconciliation, inclusivity and understanding.”\n\n“We already see people coming together at Canada Place. Much like Canada itself, where the best the world has to offer comes together,” said Nipissing—Timiskaming MP Anthony Rota.\n\n“That’s my Canada! In North Bay, we now have our own Canada Place.”\n\nThe project was initiated by the Heritage Gardeners of North Bay.\n\nPhase one resulted in the city building an accessible pathway.\n\nThree years later, in 2023, construction of the space proceeded with funding from the federal government, the City of North Bay and “funds raised by the Heritage Gardeners through the sale of engraved bricks incorporated into the design.\n\nWanda Wallace co-chair of the Heritage Gardeners, explains that vision came from looking at the underpass.\n\n“It was like a path going nowhere, so we wanted to bring it over here. That was the initial thought and then it was decided whatever we do, it should be inclusive, and involve a lot of people and a great design,” explained Wallace.\n\nAlthough not red in colour, the large maple leaf is an important part of the design.\n\n“I am pleased with it. Being here today and seeing this I love the way the monochromatic earthy colours match the stones. I quite like it now.”\n\nNipissing First Nation Deputy Chief Michael Sawyer held a smudge ceremony, followed by members of the Nipissing First Nation Council assisting with the raising of the Nipissing First Nation flag, which will remain permanently on display.\n\n“Nipissing First Nation recognizes the City of North Bay’s contribution to the revitalization of the shores of Lake Nipissing, a treasure within the traditional territory of the Nbisiing Anishinaabeg. The space promotes harmony, which ultimately speaks to our Seven Grandfather Teaching of respect, and we are grateful that the spirit of this teaching is embedded in the project,” said Nipissing First Nation Chief Scott McLeod."
