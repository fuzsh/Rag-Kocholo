        "text": "Artist Jag Nagra’s designs for the Komagata Maru Place signage contain layers of iconography. Both designs are based on 2 well-known archival photographs.\n\nSymbolism in the first sign\n\nIn the first sign, 19 doves represent the 19 lives lost. The pattern of ocean waves imitates the pattern of dupatta fabric seen in unraveled turbans. The reflection of the setting red sun is coloured to represent the bloodshed experienced as part of the tragedy.\n\nMourning passengers in the second sign\n\nThe second sign showcases 13 passengers with their eyes closed, mourning the tragedy. The passengers are crowded together to represent the poor living conditions on board the ship. Among the crowd are 2 women, often forgotten in the tragedy’s retelling.\n\nUsing colours and typography\n\nThe use of bright and sacred religious colours not only reflects South Asian culture, but also emphasizes the diversity of those onboard. Green turbans pay homage to Muslim passengers, the navy-blue ocean represents those who were Sikh, and saffron-coloured jackets symbolize those who were Hindu. Through use of colour, artist Jag Nagra responds to the prejudiced, racist, and demeaning historical news articles which labeled all passengers as Hindu, erasing the diversity amongst the passengers.\n\nAdditionally, the text is written in newsprint typeface to underscore the important role print media had in shaping public narratives about the passengers. And finally, Guru Nanak Jahaz, which the ship was renamed, is prominently written in Gurmukhi alongside the tragedy’s 1914 date.\n\nSignage for Komagata Maru Place were created by Jagandeep (Jag) Kaur Nagra, a queer, Punjabi, visual artist passionate about art accessibility, community development, and combatting LGBTQ+ stigma in the South Asian community.\n\nArtist statement\n\nWorking on this piece has been an emotional journey: from the beginning when I joined the City of Vancouver’s committee for Historical Discrimination Against People of South Asian Canadian Descent, to the secondary street naming advisory committee, and now having been given the opportunity to create the artwork proposal. The responsibility placed on the artist to create artwork that commemorates the tragedy that unfolded in Vancouver harbour is immense, and not one that I’ve taken lightly.\n\nThe phrasing Komagata Maru “incident” has minimized what our ancestors went through over their 6 gruelling months aboard the ship. While it may be a short blip in historical writings, for our people, it has had lasting effects. The racism, the lack of regard for human life. It’s not an incident, it’s a tragedy in every sense of the word.\n\nThrough this series of artworks, I’ve put thought into every single element and colour choice. Every line I drew felt heavy as I listened to interviews, podcasts, and read articles about the tragedy while I created. The voices of scholars, community members, and descendants are in every line, in every shape, and every colour.\n\nGuru Nanak Jahaz\n\nIn 1914, Gurdit Singh, a Sikh businessman and community leader chartered a Japanese steamship from Hong Kong named the Komagata Maru. The ship was renamed Guru Nanak Jahaz following an Ardaas (prayer service) at a Gurdwara (place of learning and worship) in Hong Kong.\n\nInformation icon Guru Nanak was the first of the 10 Sikh gurus and holds spiritual value for those practicing Sikhism. Jahaaz means ‘ship’ in Punjabi.\n\nThe passengers\n\nOn April 4, 1914, the Komagata Maru left Hong Kong carrying 376 passengers — approximately 340 Sikh, 24 Muslim, and 12 Hindu passengers — including 2 women and 5 children, most originating from Punjab, British India. The ship began its 2-month journey via Shanghai and Yokohama to Vancouver's Burrard Inlet. The passengers, all British subjects, were traveling across the globe, like many others, in search of a better life. They hoped to find work in Canada and support their families back home.\n\nDenied entry in Vancouver\n\nOn May 23, 1914, the ship arrived in Vancouver and anchored in Burrard Inlet. Despite possessing valid travel documents and complying with a large discriminatory $200 head tax, only 20 passengers were allowed to disembark as they had previously lived in Canada. The remaining 356 passengers were denied entry and were kept on board the ship, which was anchored in the harbor. The Canadian government argued that the passengers had not arrived by a continuous journey.\n\nThe Continuous Journey regulation\n\nThe Canadian government’s Continuous Journey regulation required immigrants to make a direct journey from their country of origin without stopping or disembarking at any other port along the way. This policy specifically targeted immigrants from India who, at the time, had no way to get to Canada in 1 continuous ship voyage. This regulation was passed within the context of rising anti-Asian and anti-“Hindoo” racism, antisemitism, increasing racism towards Black Canadians, and ongoing anti-Indigenous racism (for example, Gradual Civilization Act, 1857).\n\nLegal rulings and forced return\n\nHenry Herbert Stevens who was a Vancouver City Alderman (Councillor) until 1911, before becoming Member of Parliament for Greater Vancouver in 1912, publicly supported the Continuous Journey regulation. In a pamphlet titled, “Oriental Problem,” he named South Asian community leaders as being dangerous, exploitative, and ignorant. Stevens was strongly opposed to immigration from India to Canada, calling South Asians undesirables, and opposing their right to be joined by their families.\n\nOn July 6, 1914, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Government of Canada after finding no decision in Canadian or British law that gave the passengers a right of entry. All but approximately 20 of the passengers were ordered to return to India.\n\nTragic outcome in India\n\nAfter having been anchored in Vancouver’s Burrard Inlet with passengers detained on board for 62 days, the Komagata Maru (Guru Nanak Jahaz) was escorted out of the harbor by the Canadian military on July 23, 1914. Upon the ship's arrival to the Indian port of Budge Budge near Kolkata, India on September 29, 1914, 19 passengers were shot and killed, while many others were imprisoned or placed under house arrest by British Indian police and troops as they were labeled political agitators.\n\nThe Komagata Maru incident remains a significant moment in Canadian history, underscoring the discriminatory immigration policies of the time and the hardships faced by immigrants, particularly those from Asia.\n\nCouncil’s May 2020 report on the commemoration of the Komagata Maru incident PDF file (1.7 MB) delves deeply into our 1914 response to the arrival of the ship. It provides historical context, the viewpoint of a community historian, photos, and detailed historical information.\n\nNeglect of food requests\n\nOver their 62-day isolation in Burrard Inlet, passengers often went 3 to 4 days without food and water. Their representatives wrote repeated letters to the Vancouver Mayor, requesting food, water, and medical aid in response to the deteriorating living conditions on the ship. We did not respond to these letters, nor did we seek support from senior government to provide these provisions.\n\nExclusion of South Asians Dominion Hall public meeting\n\nVancouver Mayor Baxter organized a public meeting held at a community hall referred to as Dominion Hall. South Asians were refused entry and some of those wishing to attend were removed forcibly by police.\n\nQuote from Vancouver Mayor Baxtor, Vancouver Sun, June 23, 1914\n\n“We have here in the harbor seeking admittance a boat load of undesirables trying to force their way in defiance of our laws, and who will not stop at taking action in the courts to force their presence upon us. There is no room for them here. Work is not to be had even for our citizens. What I would like to see is that orders be issued for a couple of tugboats to hitch on to the Komagata Maru and haul her with her load of undesirables out to sea. We do not want this thing to get into the courts…. By holding this meeting we desire to show the government [in] Ottawa in a quiet way that we as citizens are behind them in any action that may be taken in ridding the country of these East Indians. The Hindu is not a desirable citizen, and when I say that I am backed up by public opinion.”\n\nMotion passed to exclude Hindus and other Asiatic races\n\nCouncil unanimously passed a motion which stated that:\n\n“...whereas it is known that if these Hindus succeed in landing it is the plan of promoters of the scheme to bring thousands of their compatriots into this country. And whereas the presenc e of these people would prove a serious menace to our civilization, both economically and socially, besides intensifying the present unsatisfactory labor condition. This Council, therefore, desires to place itself on record as unalterably opposed to the admittance of Hindus and other Asiatic races into this country, and that his worshiped the Mayor, be authorized to send a telegram to Premier Sir Robert Borden conveying this expression of the Council.”\n\nUse of force during deportation\n\nAfter the Board of Appeal decision of July 6, the passengers accepted the verdict and agreed to leave only after adequate provisions (food and water) for their long return journey were provided. In the early morning on July 19, 1914, a ship with 35 deputized officers and 125 City police officers, all armed, approached the Komagata Maru with the intention of forcing her out of the harbour as per the deportation order. The passengers were awake and resisted as they did not receive food and water for their long journey home and a battle commenced. Vancouver Police enforced the federal deportation order without objection from Mayor Baxter and City Aldermen (Councillors).\n\nProfiling and mass interrogations\n\nBefore, during, and after the incident, Vancouver Police were able to detain any South Asians they deemed suspicious and conduct mass interrogations and searches against the local South Asian population in Vancouver.\n\nSupport from local South Asian communities\n\nDespite these widespread racist sentiments and discriminatory setbacks, the local South Asian communities living in Vancouver advocated for the passengers and raised funds to pay for provisions and legal efforts in support of the passengers."
