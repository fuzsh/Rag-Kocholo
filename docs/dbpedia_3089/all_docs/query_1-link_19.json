The most widely accepted explanation comes from the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real, who recorded the area as Rio de San Johem in 1519. The earliest recording of the modern day spelling came from an English merchant who travelled to Newfoundland in the 1570’s.\n\n(Source: City of St. John's )\n\nFind out more:\n\nGeographical name search results: St. John’s\n\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\n\nThe name of the city was derived from George Montagu Dunk, second Earl of Halifax, who as president of the British Board of Trade aided in the foundation of Halifax and the colonization of Nova Scotia.
