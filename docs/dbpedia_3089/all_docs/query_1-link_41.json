        "text": "\"Lauren Beck looks at Canadian toponyms as they appear on current maps, then traces the history of their naming. It is a history of cultural tensions, often violence, as various victorious groups redefine the landscape by erasing previous markers of identity. Beck suggests that we can continue the process of renaming, now by consultation and peaceful agreement, in order to draw a new map 'that better reflects who we are.'\"\n\nBarbara Belyea, University of Calgary and editor of Peter Fidler: From York Factory to the Rocky Mountains\n\n\"Canadaâs Place Names and How to Change Them is very engaging. Lauren Beckâs rhetorical style is creative and the work is well-organized and coherently structured, with a strong linking narrative throughout. Her work highlights many of the questions of power and perception relating to place names in the postcolonial period, and this book should be an influential text in onomastic scholarship both within and beyond Canada.\"\n\nMaggie Scott, University of Salford and editor of The Concise Scots Dictionary (2nd ed.)"
