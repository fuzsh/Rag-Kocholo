        "text": "Is the Basic (free) version sufficient for my needs?\n\nThe Basic (free) database will meet many user's needs. You may want to purchase the Pro or Comprehensive versions if:\n\nYou need data for rural towns/villages or places that have fewer than 1,000 residents.\n\nYou need demographic data such as age, race, education or income.\n\nYou don't want to (or can't) attribute your use of our data on a public-facing website.\n\nDo you omit any populated places?\n\nYes. For clarity we don't show multiple places with the same name in the same province/territory. We only show the most important place of a given name in each province/territory. Also, we omit some rural places that are particularly insignificant.\n\nAm I allowed to redistribute the database if I purchase a paid license?\n\nNo. You are not allowed to sell the database or make it publicly available. However, you can make copies and backups of the data. You are also allowed to query the database to power publicly facing applications such as a store locator. To learn more, read the full license terms.\n\nHow often do you release updates?\n\nIt depends, we monitor our sources and release new versions when we have more current data. Upon purchase, you can elect to receive email alerts when we release new versions of the database.\n\nWhy should I trust this data?\n\nThis database was aggregated from authoritative sources and carefully processed by SimpleMaps. We've been developing and selling interactive maps to Fortune 500 companies and prominent international organizations for over 14 years. Over this time, we've learned a lot about geographic data. To get a sense of the expertise and support we offer, check out some of the testimonials from our happy customers.\n\nIf I use the free database, what type of attribution is required?\n\nIf you use the Basic (free) database, you must link back to this page:\n\nhttps://simplemaps.com/data/canada-cities\n\nfrom a public webpage where you are using the data. If you want to use the data internally, you must link back to this page from your firm's website on a page that can be easily found though links on the root domain. The link must be clearly visible to the human eye.\n\nHow recent are the demographic variables such as income_household_median?\n\nAll of the demographic variables come from Statistics Canada and are from 2021 Census (the most recent data available).\n\nDoes the database contain postal codes?\n\npostal captures the three-character Forward sortation area (FSA) that are within or overlap the city. It corresponds to the first half of a six-character Canadian postal code. You can learn more at Wikipedia. Since there are nearly a million six-character postal codes in Canada, it is neither easy nor practical to incorporate six-character postal codes into our database.\n\nHow come some demographic variables are blank (empty strings) for some cities?\n\nDemographic variables are only available for places recognized and tracked by Statistics Canada.\n\nHow do I calculate the distance between two cities?\n\nWe've published free formulas in popular programming languages. Check them out.\n\nDoes the database include commonly known populated places even if they don't have a legal/municipal existence?\n\nYes, such places are included in our paid databases.\n\nDoes the database contain neighborhoods?\n\nNo, the database does not typically contained named places that are within other listed towns/cities. There are some exceptions to this in large metropolitan areas like Vancouver and Toronto where important cities lie within larger cities and share municipal services."
