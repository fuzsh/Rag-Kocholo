I’m celebrating that freedom today.”\n\nHelen Nguyen, who migrated to Canada from Vietnam, said the event was an opportunity to celebrate a country that has provided her with new opportunity.\n\n“I feel very thankful to call myself a Canadian and today is the best day to celebrate the peace I have here.”\n\nBut Sparrow told Postmedia News she struggled with the idea of showcasing her woven work at a Canada Day event.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I was worried what it might mean if I was to be seen here, but as I was setting up I decided, you know what — I’m going to use this opportunity to show people that our culture is resilient and still being practised.”\n\nShe exhibited an intricately designed blanket that she, her mother and son wove out of sheep’s fur with a wooden loom.\n\n“This form of weaving was lost for around 100 years due to residential schools,” Sparrow said. “My mother brought it back to our community 40 years ago after studying blanket-making” among other Indigenous women.\n\nHer teenage son, Isaiah, wore the finished product to his high school graduation.\n\n“He was so proud to walk across the stage wearing a blanket we made that connected him to his ancestors and graduating from a system and school that wasn’t meant for us,” Sparrow said.\n\nIn May 2021 the suspected unmarked graves of 215 Indigenous children were discovered on the grounds of a former B.C. residential school. Since then, Sparrow says the Canadian public has shown more respect and interest in Indigenous culture.\n\n“People here are really trying to learn,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnother cultural practice lost during the residential school era was canoe carving and racing, said Ray Natraoro of the Squamish Nation.\n\nThe seventh-generation carver was proud to show off his latest red cedar in progress at Saturday’s event. The 21-foot-long canoe is just 40 hours away from being race ready.\n\n“I’m here to tell people that First Nations people are still here and thriving, and to show that even though there is a big city around us, Indigenous people are living within the general population.”\n\nFor Port Coquitlam’s Amy Yue, who came to Saturday’s event so her children could participate in free activities, celebrating the holiday has become less appealing lately.\n\n“I’ve had a hard time celebrating Canada Day since the discovery of those unmarked graves,” said Yue, who migrated to Canada from China with her parents when she was a child.\n\n“Before I used to be so proud to be a Canadian, but I’m glad that they have changed the event to incorporate more Indigenous culture.”\n\nsgrochowski@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nCanada Day weekend travel: 'Intermittent slowness' on reservations system continue | Long waits begin anew on major routes\n\nO Canada: 10 events to celebrate Canada Day around Metro Vancouver\n\nSupport our journalism: Our in-depth journalism is possible thanks to the support of our subscribers.
