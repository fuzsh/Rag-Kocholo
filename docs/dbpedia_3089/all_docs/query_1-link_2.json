        "text": "The City of Vancouver has given a second name to a prominent street on the city's waterfront in honour of the Komagata Maru, a ship carrying hundreds of South Asian people that was turned away from the city a century ago.\n\nCanada Place, the street where a cruise and ferry terminal and the Vancouver Convention Centre both stand, will now have the second name of Komagata Maru Place, as it was the site closest to where the ship was docked for nearly two months in 1914.\n\nCity officials made the second name official at a Friday event, with the initiative announced last year as the city works to recognize its role in an incident that saw the ship's passengers turned away due to an exclusionary immigration policy.\n\nThe Canadian law that targeted the Komagata Maru was called the Continuous Passage Act, passed in 1908.\n\nIt required all prospective immigrants to Canada to arrive directly from their point of origin, without stops in between — a near-impossible task for those travelling from India and Japan. The law remained in place until 1947.\n\nThe Komagata Maru, also called the Guru Nanak Jahaaz, docked near the current location of Canada Place in 1914 with 340 Sikh, 27 Muslim and 12 Hindu passengers on board, most of whom were denied entry into Canada despite having valid travel documents.\n\nThe ship sat in the harbour for two months, and the passengers on board had to contend with a lack of medical aid, food or water.\n\nIt was ultimately forced to return to India and was met by British soldiers. Nineteen passengers were killed and others jailed by colonial authorities there after being considered political agitators.\n\nRaj Singh Toor, the vice-president of the Descendants of the Komagata Maru Society and a grandson of one of the ship's passengers, said the street renaming would go some way to correcting the hurt inflicted 110 years ago.\n\n\"We can't undo the past, but we can move forward and leave a legacy for the future generations by educating them about the past,\" Toor told CBC News at the Friday event.\n\nMultiple city officials were in attendance Friday, including Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim, who apologized for the city's role in turning away the passengers at the time.\n\n\"I think it's incumbent upon all of us to unlearn what we've been taught in the past and learn the true history as to what's happened on these lands,\" Sim told a news conference.\n\nThe city officially apologized for its role in the Komagata Maru incident in 2021, and the federal government issued an apology in 2016.\n\nArtist cites lasting effects\n\nThe artwork that will be seen at the street signs marking Komagata Maru Place is designed by Jag Nagra, a local artist who has designed numerous prominent pieces in Metro Vancouver.\n\nIn an artist's statement on the City of Vancouver website, Nagra says the Komagata Maru incident had lasting effects on South Asian people in the region.\n\n\"The racism, the lack of regard for human life — it wasn't an 'incident'. It was a tragedy in every sense of the word,\" she told the Friday news conference.\n\n\"My hope with these two artworks is that they serve as a reminder every day to expect better, to do better, and to make sure we keep our histories alive so they're not erased.\"\n\nBoth street signs feature the year 1914, as well as the text \"Guru Nanak Jahaaz\" written in Punjabi. The first street sign depicts 19 doves, representing the 19 passengers killed on their return to India.\n\nThe second features a number of passengers crowded together, with Nagra saying she took care to represent the diversity of cultures and people on board, including women."
