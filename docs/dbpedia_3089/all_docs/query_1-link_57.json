        "text": "Driving\n\nFlyover's on-site parkade is operated by WestPark. The entrance to this parkade is at the base of Howe Street underneath Canada Place. When you enter the parkade, drive to the north end; you’ll see signs directing you to the elevators and up to Flyover.\n\nCruise Ship\n\nAre you travelling on a cruise to or from Vancouver? Great! Flyover is conveniently located at Canada Place, in the same building as the cruise ship terminal. We’re the perfect solution for an activity while you’re waiting to board, or to round out your cruise with an immersive adventure across the country and beyond.\n\nWalking\n\nFlyover is easily accessible by foot from most places in downtown Vancouver. Make your way to Howe Street or Burrard Street and walk north until you reach Canada Place — you can’t miss it! You can also reach Canada Place by walking east from Stanley Park along the beautiful Coal Harbour seawall. Once you arrive at Canada Place, you can purchase tickets at our ticket kiosk in the front plaza or head down the Canadian Trail until you see the main Flyover entrance.\n\nSkyTrain\n\nWaterfront Station is the closest SkyTrain station to Flyover and is just a short five-minute walk away. When you exit Waterfront Station, head right (west) on West Cordova Street, then right at Howe Street. Canada Place will be directly in front of you one block away.\n\nSeaBus\n\nComing from the North Shore? Jump on the SeaBus from Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver and enjoy the ferry ride over to Waterfront Station. When you exit Waterfront Station, head right (west) on West Cordova Street, then turn right onto Howe Street. Canada Place will be directly in front of you one block away."
