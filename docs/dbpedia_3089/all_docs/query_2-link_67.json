        "text": "Important Canadian buildings stand as a testament to the nation’s longstanding status as a global leader in talent, technology, and creativity. This list of monumental buildings has been curated by experts at Lenmak and Construction Global and consists of everything from skyscrapers to immaculately-designed cathedrals.\n\n18 Famous Canadian Buildings That Captivate Architects\n\n1. CN Tower\n\nPractically synonymous with Toronto, this looming tower was constructed in the 1960s amid a major construction boom in the city. As skyscrapers rose to unprecedented heights, existing communications towers struggled to get their signals around the city. The CN Tower solved that problem — and gave Canada its most recognizable structure, one of the tallest in the world.\n\nArchitects: John Andrews, Roger Du Toit, Web Zerafa Menkes Housden Partnership\n\nCompleted: 1976\n\nLocation: Toronto, Ontario\n\nKnown For: World’s tallest free-standing structure for more than 34 years.\n\n2. Parliament Buildings\n\nCanada’s original Parliament Buildings exemplified the Gothic architectural style. When those structures were largely routed by fires in 1916, architects John A. Pearson and Jean-Omer Marchand lent their services towards redesigning the complex in a manner representative of that original style.\n\nToday, the structures on Parliament Hill are about as iconic as Canadian heritage buildings get.\n\nArchitects: John A. Pearson and Jean-Omer Marchand\n\nCompleted: 1928\n\nLocation: Ottawa, Ontario\n\nKnown For: Canada’s seat of power.\n\n3. Notre-Dame Basilica\n\nThe province of Quebec is home to numerous famous Canadian buildings that showcase its French Catholic roots. The Gothic Revival-style Notre-Dame Basilica is among the most impressive of these.\n\nIt has ranked among Canadian heritage buildings since 1989 and is truly a sight to behold, with its intricate ceiling and stunning stained glass windows.\n\nArchitect: James O’Donnell\n\nCompleted: 1829\n\nLocation: Montreal, Quebec\n\nKnown For: Exemplary Gothic Revival architecture, historical significance.\n\n4. Confederation Bridge\n\nCanada’s geography and climate present many challenges for construction professionals to overcome. Architect Jean M. Muller designed Confederation Bridge, a multi-span post-tensioned concrete box girder, to link Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.\n\nIt’s the world’s longest bridge built over icy waters — a very Canadian feat, to say the least.\n\nArchitect: Jean M. Muller\n\nCompleted: 1997\n\nLocation: Boden-Carleton, PEI and Cape Jourimain, New Brunswick\n\nKnown For: Canada’s longest bridge and the world’s longest bridge over icy water.\n\n5. West Edmonton Mall\n\nThe next entry on our list of important Canadian buildings is a gargantuan shopping mall in Edmonton, Alberta. West Edmonton Mall is North America’s largest. In addition to that impressive feat, it houses the world’s second-largest water and amusement park in the world.\n\nThe postmodern structure sees upwards of 30 million visitors annually — twice as much as Disneyland.\n\nArchitect: Maurice Sunderland\n\nCompleted: 1981\n\nLocation: Edmonton, Alberta\n\nKnown For: North America’s largest shopping mall.\n\n6. St. Joseph’s Oratory\n\nSt. Josephs’s Oratory is another testament to Montreal’s French Catholic roots. Just like the CN Tower was constructed to solve a city’s growing pains, this church was constructed to house a congregation that had outgrown its original chapel nestled in the slopes of Mount Royal.\n\nThe resulting Italian Renaissance structure has been Canada’s largest church ever since. Problem solved!\n\nArchitects: Alphonse Venne, Dalbé Viau, Lucien Parent, Dom Paul Bellot, and Emilien Bujold\n\nCompleted: 1967\n\nLocation: Montreal, Quebec\n\nKnown For: Canada’s largest church and the home of a statue of Saint Joseph commissioned by Pope Pius X.\n\n7. Canada Place\n\nCanada Place, located on Vancouver’s Burrard Inlet waterfront, has often been referred to as the Sydney Opera House of Canada. While it’s not hard to see why, the structure still has plenty of its own architectural provenance.\n\nIt features five fibreglass ‘sails’ rising 90 feet into the air and houses many community and recreational activities.\n\nArchitects: Zeidler Roberts Partnership, MCMP & DA Architects + Planners\n\nCompleted: 1985\n\nLocation: Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nKnown For: Architectural beauty, local charm; every day at noon, the building chimes the first four notes of the national anthem for virtually everyone in downtown Vancouver and nearby to hear.\n\n8. Monique Corriveau Library\n\nAt first glance, one might expect the Monique-Corriveau Library to blast off into outer space at any moment. It’s an odd design for a library — let alone a church, which is what the structure actually was until 2013.\n\nAs part of the structure’s conversion into a library, architects actually added rectangular glass extensions. The original design was so forward-thinking, though, that you’d hardly know these were added in decades later.\n\nArchitects: Jean Marie-Roy (original), Dan Hanganu and Côté Leahy Cardas Architects (conversion)\n\nCompleted: 2013\n\nLocation: Quebec City, Quebec\n\nKnown For: Unique shape.\n\n9. Chateau Frontenac\n\nThe Chateau Frontenac is another gem within Quebec City. Its origins lie in the 19th century when the Canadian Pacific Railway firm was constructing numerous monumental and distinctive hotels.\n\nThese Canadian historical buildings, referred to as “grand railway hotels,” draw from various architectural styles: Chateauesque and Victorian are this structure’s influences.\n\nArchitect: Bruce Price\n\nCompleted: 1893\n\nLocation: Quebec City, Quebec\n\nKnown For: Its beauty and status as Quebec City’s tallest building from 1924 to 1930.\n\n10. Habitat 67\n\nHabitat 67 is one of the most adventurous and iconic apartment complexes in the world, let alone Canada. Architect Moshe Safdie crafted it while studying at McGill. It makes use of prefabricated concrete ‘modules’ stacked as high as 12 per section.\n\nToday, Habitat 67 stands as one of Montreal’s most iconic buildings, one unlike most people have ever seen before or since.\n\nArchitect: Moshe Safdie\n\nCompleted: 1967\n\nLocation: Montreal, Quebec\n\nKnown For: Unique concept and beloved, albeit sometimes controversial, design.\n\n11. Montreal Symphony House\n\nIt’s no accident that Montreal is home to some of the most iconic Canadian buildings. The city’s rich culture has made it a home for modern and historical structures alike.\n\nThe Montreal Symphony House fits neatly into the former category. SNC-Lavalin (a Canadian icon in its own right) was the project’s general contractor.\n\nArchitect: Jack Diamond\n\nCompleted: 2011\n\nLocation: Montreal, Quebec\n\nKnown For: Housing the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and Metropolitan Orchestra, among many.\n\n12. Sharp Centre for Design\n\nIf you’re going to build a structure for architecture faculty, you better make sure it’s distinctive. The Sharp Centre for Design is certainly that. It is recognized as one of Toronto’s five most influential buildings and houses OCAD U’s Faculty of Design.\n\nArchitects: Will Alsop, Robbie/Young + Wright Architects Inc.\n\nCompleted: 2004\n\nLocation: Toronto, Ontario\n\nKnown For: Distinctive look and architectural significance in Toronto.\n\n13. Art Gallery Of Ontario\n\nMere steps from the Sharp Centre for Design, the Art Gallery of Ontario has been said to resemble a spaceship made from crystals. The building quite literally reflects the city around it.\n\nArchitects: Numerous over the years; its latest iteration is the work of Frank Gehry.\n\nCompleted: 2008\n\nLocation: Toronto, Ontario\n\nKnown For: Housing the world-renowned Art Gallery of Ontario.\n\n14. Banff Springs Hotel\n\nThe Banff Springs Hotel is another grand railway hotel from the 19th century. As with the Chateau Frontenac, this building draws from various styles, namely Chateauesque and Scottish baronial. It is nestled within Banff National Park and overlooks Mount Rundle.\n\nArchitects: Walter S. Painter, Bruce Price, and John Orrock\n\nCompleted: 1888\n\nLocation: Banff, Alberta\n\nKnown For: One of Canada’s most popular grand railway hotels.\n\n15. Chan Centre for Performing Arts\n\nThe Chan Centre for Performing Arts is, by design, one of the most dynamic buildings in Canada. Many portions are integrated with nature, allowing the structure to showcase the various hues characteristic of Canadian seasons.\n\nArchitects: Bing Thom Architects and Artec Consultants\n\nCompleted: 1997\n\nLocation: Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nKnown For: Architectural beauty and being the product of what was the largest private donation accepted by a Canadian cultural institution at the time.\n\n16. Canadian Museum of History\n\nOne thing you should have a deep appreciation for by now (if you didn’t already) is Canada’s rich history. The Canadian Museum of History sees more visitors per year than any other museum in the country — and the artifacts aren’t just on the inside.\n\nThe centrepiece of the museum is a Grand Hall showcasing the nearby Ottawa River and Parliament Hill. Within the hall lies what is believed to be the world’s largest colour photograph.\n\nArchitects: Douglas Cardinal\n\nCompleted: 1980s\n\nLocation: Gatineau, Quebec\n\nKnown For: Housing Canada’s most popular museum.\n\n17. Science World in Vancouver\n\nRounding out our list, we have two more stunning buildings in Vancouver. The first of these is the jaw-dropping Science World in Vancouver, the centrepiece of which is a massive dome made from 15,000 pounds of aluminum.\n\nArchitects: Bruno Freschi\n\nCompleted: 1985\n\nLocation: Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nKnown For: One of Vancouver’s most iconic buildings.\n\n18. Vancouver Public Library (Central Library)\n\nMoshe Safdie, the mastermind behind Habitat 67, also designed this structure, reminiscent of the coliseum. As if the structure itself wasn’t stunning enough, it also has a “secret garden” on its rooftop, part of a recent $16.8 million expansion.\n\nArchitect: Moshe Safdie\n\nCompleted: 1995\n\nLocation: Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nKnown For: Housing the Central Library of the Vancouver Public Library system. It also has an extremely distinctive design."
