        "text": "The Canada Line\n\nWelcome to Waterfront\n\nLocated on Burrard Inlet between downtown’s historic Gastown and Canada Place, Waterfront Station is the sole northern terminus station of Canada Line as well as of the West Coast Express, Expo Line and Seabus. For travellers, it’s an easy point of connection between transit lines or an exciting destination full of heritage buildings, viewpoints, restaurants and evening hotspots.\n\nThere are 2 entrances to Waterfront Station. The main entrance is located in the historic Canadian Pacific Railway Station (built in 1910) at the foot of Seymour Street on Cordova Street. When entering the main Waterfront station from Cordova, Canada Line passengers turn left to reach the entrance, which leads into a bright, artfully designed underground passageway to the train platform.\n\nThe second entrance to Waterfront Station is on Granville Street between Pender and Hastings Streets and leads directly to the South end of the Canada Line platform."
