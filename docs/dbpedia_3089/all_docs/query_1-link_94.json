        "text": "Place names serve as a reflection of a society and the values it chooses to uphold. In Canada's Place Names and How to Change Them, Lauren Beck presents a compelling analysis that considers the toponymical practices of Euro-settler societies as well as First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities to demonstrate diverse relationships with the land and how such relationships have been authorized by the federal government through bodies such as the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Given the rise of societal movements to contest the legacy of individuals or events who have been commemorated, this book serves as an essential contribution that not only demonstrates how public recognition has been used to affirm power relationships but also provides tangible strategies to reclaim histories that have otherwise been silenced.\n\nBeck's analysis draws upon several theories and concepts including settler colonialism and critical toponymy. The former considers how the intellectual displacement of Indigenous knowledge and culture, alongside the propagation of settler knowledge, serves as a method of justifying physical displacement and the assertion of Euro-settler sovereignty. The latter shifts away from the etymological meanings of place names by demonstrating how they are influenced by clear political agendas informed by class, race, gender, and power. Beck's framework was influenced by Black studies, women and gender studies, and Indigenous studies, which is relevant to consider alongside the argument that place names in Canada have predominately been used to uphold white, heterosexual, and patriarchal societies.\n\nThe first and second chapters of this book effectively differentiate Indigenous and settler place-naming practices. Beck explains that Indigenous communities are more likely to utilize econyms such as Wendake, which provide insight into the ecological relationships between a people and their traditional territories. Settler place names can often be commemorative–such as Vancouver, which recognizes the exploits of a particular person and the role they played in establishing the region. Both of these chapters recognize a multiplicity of cultural perspectives and how these have influenced place-naming practices. Chapter 1 provides subsections that examine toponymy in Tl'azt'en, Chipewyan, Inuit, and Haudenosaunee territories, among others, which is a welcome divergence from scholarship that pan-Indigenizes cultural practices. Such specificity is also evident in Beck's analysis of place names in Quebec and the influences of Catholicism in the practice of hagiotoponymy or the naming of places after saints.\n\nThe third and fifth chapters of this book consider the intersections of toponymy, gender, ability, and race. These chapters consider the differences between names that are officially recognized through federal bodies such as the [End Page 634] Geographical Names Board of Canada and less official names that are supported by members of cultural communities, such as a neighbourhood that is recognized as a Little Italy or a Chinatown. One of Beck's central arguments is that multiple histories or identities can be ascribed to a single place, while, at the same time, existing governmental or societal mechanisms privilege one place name or identity over another. Beck considers the complications of toponyms based on racial terms and provides notable examples of when these have been changed. Alternatively, Beck presents examples of cultural communities that have called for the perpetuation of racially motivated place names so that these can serve as recognitions of the histories or contributions that are associated with those groups in a particular region.\n\nThe final chapter of this book presents examples of recent place names that have been changed, along with insights about best practices used in the renegotiation of a toponym. Beck considers the removal of commemorative settler place names including Ryerson University, which has been rebranded as Toronto Metropolitan University. Other examples demonstrate how the lack of community consultation can derail a proposed renaming, as seen with the recommended transition from Red Indian Lake, Newfoundland, to Wantaqo'ti Qospem, a Mi'kmaw term that translates to \"peaceful lake.\" Beck concludes with a reflection regarding contentious place names that are being recommended for renaming..."
