        "text": "Vancouver’s vibrant Coal Harbour waterfront district includes Canada Place and Burrard Landing. Both are just a few blocks away from the Auberge Hotel and are situated along Vancouver’s world-famous Seawall that wraps around Stanley Park. They are also within a short walk of Vancouver’s central business and entertainment district.\n\nCanada Place is an inspiring national landmark recognized worldwide for its iconic architecture depicting five white sails. Since it first opened as the site of Canada’s Pavilion for Expo ’86, it has grown to include the Vancouver Convention Centre East, the Pan Pacific Vancouver Hotel, Vancouver’s World Trade Centre, and the Vancouver Cruise Ship terminal that welcomes more than 900,000 passengers each year.\n\nCanada Place is also where you’ll find FlyOver Canada, an exhilarating family-friendly adventure that creates a virtual flying experience complete with wind, scents and mist as you “soar” over some of the most spectacular scenery the country has to offer.\n\nNext to Canada Place is Burrard Landing – a retail and office space that surrounds the perimeter of the Vancouver Convention Centre West. The area is a premier outdoor dining destination with numerous restaurants lining the waterfront boasting some of Vancouver’s best patios. Here you’ll enjoy stunning views of Coal Harbour, Burrard Inlet and the North Shore mountains. Popular eateries with both tourists and locals include the Original Tap & Barrel Pub, Cactus Club Cafe, and Mahony & Sons.\n\nBurrard Landing is also where you’ll find the Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre, Vancouver’s largest seaplane terminal serving the Pacific Northwest Coast, including Vancouver Island."
