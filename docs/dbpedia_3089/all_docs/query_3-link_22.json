Begin your journey by walking down The Canadian Trail that runs along the West Promenade of Canada Place. The interpretive route leads directly from the street to Flyover’s entrance at end of the pier, all while taking you on a unique walk across different locations in Canada. After visiting Flyover, your post-adventure options are endless: visit one of the many fantastic restaurants in the area, walk to nearby Gastown or take a leisurely stroll along the water to Stanley Park.\n\nWestcoast Sightseeing"
