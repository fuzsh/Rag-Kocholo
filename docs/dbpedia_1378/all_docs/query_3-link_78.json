I have seen pictures from this library before and was excited to go. Tårnby is a light and pleasant library.\n\nWhen entering your eye will quickly go to the beautiful courtyard and the daylight pouring in to the library from the skylights.\n\nThe spaces between the pillars gives a view of both floors of the library and you get a good sense of the layout right away.\n\nMy second thought was that all the corners of the library had a very homely feeling.\n\nEven at nine in the morning there were people in the cafe, in the courtyard, in the studyzone and in all the corners of the building.\n\nThe beautiful interior of the library seems very kid and family friendly.\n\nfrom the little shopping carts with baby seats to the fossball table and dress up corner.\n\nKids and families will feel welcome.\n\nWith the library being close to Copenhagen airport in Kastrup, the play area of course has a plane!\n\nThe library also has many different zones for people who wants to study, read the paper or a good book.\n\nThere is a quiet work og learning zone and between the bookcases there a many little nooks where you can dissapear into a good novel.\n\nThe library is a 20 minute ride on busline 5c from Copenhagen Central station and worth a visit for the library loving traveller!\n\nThe building is from 1982 and by architect Gehrdt Bornebusch.\n\nhttps://taarnbybib.dk"
