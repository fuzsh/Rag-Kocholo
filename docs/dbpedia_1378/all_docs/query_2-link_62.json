I have multiple years of construction and wildlife backgrounds, which led me to starting my own company in the wildlife career.\n\nI was born and raised in Pensacola, Florida and have so much love for this town. As a boy, I was constantly hunting and fishing which led to my becoming enamored with wildlife and nature; as a result, I developed a great respect for both.\n\nBecause of that respect, I earned a degree in elementary education and became a science teacher at Beulah Academy of Science. After teaching, I tried different professions before turning to the wildlife community. It allowed me both to help people in need, to make sure the wildlife would be treated in a humane way when they are removed.\n\nDW wildlife solutions is a locally owned and operated company ran by Daniel (owner), and his family. It is our goal to work hard to please people and to ensure we remove all wildlife and pest needs. If you have an animal in your house, you can count on us to get it out. We extensively exclude (block) entry to your house to prevent future wildlife entry. Regardless of if it is a racoon in your attic or animal trapping, you can count on DW Wildlife solutions to get the job done with minimal disruption to your home."
