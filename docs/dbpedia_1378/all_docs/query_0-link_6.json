        "text": "Daniel Wass (born 31 May 1989) is a Danish professional footballer who plays for Danish Superliga club Brøndby and the Denmark national team. He is capable of playing as a midfielder and full-back.[3]\n\nQuick Facts Personal information, Full name ...\n\nClose\n\nDuring the majority of his childhood, Wass played for Copenhagen-suburb club BK Avarta, but in 2006, he was scouted by Brøndby and promptly switched clubs. After a year of playing for youth teams within the club, he joined the first team.\n\nBrøndby\n\nWass made his debut for Danish Superliga team Brøndby in the 2007–08 season under manager Tom Køhlert. He played half of the matches that season but had to withdraw later on due to injury.\n\nFollowing his recovery from injury Wass secured his place as right defender in the 2008–09 season playing in 28 games from a possible 33, helping Brøndby to reach third place in the Superliga, Brøndby's best position since their second place in the 2005–06 season.\n\nBrøndby manager Kent Nielsen felt Wass should spend gain further developing at another club, so Brøndby chose to loan him out to Fredrikstad, a medal-competing side from Norway. On 21 August 2009, Wass made his debut in a 4–1 loss against Rosenborg and on 1 November 2009, Wass started and played the full 90 minutes scoring in a 5–0 win over Lyn. When the board of Fredrikstad FK signed a new manager, new coach Tom Nordlie informed Wass that he had no interest in an offensive right defender. As a result of that, Wass received no more than three games before returning to Brøndby in December 2009. For the remainder of the 2009–10 season, Wass played more games for Brøndby, securing his place in the starting eleven.\n\nThe season of 2010–11 proved to show Wass' importance for the Brøndby squad when he was selected as first-choice right back for the first 19 games. In February, during the three-month winter break in the Superliga between December and March, Wass announced he would not be renewing his contract with Brøndby. From the beginning of January there had been rumours of Wass' summer transfer to Benfica.[4] Wass did not comment on the rumours. In March 2011, with 14 matches of the season remaining, the attacking force of Wass was recognised, with Coach Henrik Jensen subsequently pushing the player up to right midfielder/winger. In his final matches for the club, Wass scored three goals, helping Brøndby to gain their third successive third place.\n\nTransfer to Benfica and loan to Évian\n\nOn 20 May 2011, Wass announced that he had signed a five-year contract with Benfica.[5] However, on 22 July 2011, he was loaned out to Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C. without taking part in any official games for Benfica.[6] Upon moving to Evian, Wass joined Danish countrymen Stephan Andersen, Christian Poulsen and Thomas Kahlenberg. In the four months after joining Evian, Wass was kept out of the first team under Bernard Casoni, who preferred Brice Dja Djédjé, while Wass stated his intention to return to his parent club.[7] On 15 October 2011, he made his debut, playing in right midfield, making an impact when he provided assist for Yannick Sagbo in a 2–1 loss against Saint-Étienne. Several weeks later, Wass scored in two consecutive games against Lorient and Rennes. He scored his third goal of the season in a 2–1 loss against Toulouse. Under new manager Pablo Correa, who succeeded Casoni, Wass secured a place in the first team, mostly being used as left-back, with Sidney Govou taking his former position in right midfield. After months of being kept out of the first team, he returned again, playing in left-back, due to Fabrice Ehret. Wass kept his place in the first team towards the end of the season when Guillaume Lacour took his position as left back, this time returning to the right midfield position. Two games before the end of the season, Wass scored his fourth goal in a 2–1 win over Ajaccio.\n\nTransfer to Évian\n\nOn 20 June 2012, Wass signed with Evian on a permanent basis for a €2.5 million transfer fee.[8] On 12 August 2012, in the opening game of the season against Bordeaux, Wass scored a free kick in a match that ended in a 2–3 loss for Evian. Like in the previous season, Wass played in various positions in defence and midfield. On 26 January 2013, Wass scored a further goal against Ajaccio in a 1–1 draw.[citation needed]\n\nCelta Vigo\n\nOn 22 June 2015, Wass joined Celta Vigo on a four-year contract.[9]\n\nWass scored a goal and assisted another in a 2–2 draw against Real Madrid.[10]\n\nValencia\n\nOn 10 July 2018, Wass joined Valencia on a four-year deal for a fee reported to be €6 million.[11][12] He made his debut for the club on 20 August in La Liga, providing an assist to Rodrigo's equaliser in a 1–1 home draw against Atlético Madrid.[13] His first goal for Los che came on 14 April 2019 in a 3–1 away win against Villarreal in the UEFA Europa League.[14] Wass was a starter in the 2019 Copa del Rey Final which saw Valencia lift the trophy after a 2–1 victory against Barcelona, his first ever career title.[15]\n\nOn 27 November 2019, Wass scored on an overcooked cross from a tight angle, which surprised goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and allowed Valencia to finish top of their UEFA Champions League group. The match finished 2–2.[16]\n\nAtlético Madrid\n\nOn 27 January 2022, Atlético Madrid announced the signing of Wass on a contract until 2023.[17] He made his competitive debut for the club on 6 February, coming off the bench at half-time for Šime Vrsaljko in a 4–2 loss away against Barcelona at Camp Nou.[18] The appearance would remain his only one for the Colchoneros, as he suffered a season-ending knee injury after a challenge by Ferran Torres.[19][20]\n\nReturn to Brøndby\n\nOn 12 August 2022, Wass returned to Brøndby on a permanent transfer.[21] He made his return debut two days later in a Superliga match against OB, starting at right-back in a 2–0 home win.[22]\n\nWass made his Danish international debut against England on 9 February 2011.[23]\n\nIn May 2018, Wass was named in Denmark's preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.[24] However, he did not make the final 23.[25]\n\nClub\n\nAs of match played 10 December 2023[28]\n\nMore information Club, Season ...\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National cup[lower-alpha 1] League cup[lower-alpha 2] Europe Other Total DivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoals Brøndby 2007–08 Danish Superliga 130————130 2008–09 Danish Superliga 28030—5[lower-alpha 3]1—361 2009–10 Danish Superliga 122————122 2010–11 Danish Superliga 32611—6[lower-alpha 3]0—397 Total 85841001110010010 Fredrikstad (loan) 2009 Tippeligaen 31————31 Benfica 2011–12 Primeira Liga 00————00 Évian (loan) 2011–12 Ligue 1 2941010——314 Évian 2012–13 Ligue 1 3425000——392 2013–14 Ligue 1 3891032——4211 2014–15 Ligue 1 3282111——3510 Total 104198143000011623 Celta Vigo 2015–16 La Liga 36271———433 2016–17 La Liga 32382—14[lower-alpha 3]2—547 2017–18 La Liga 35440———394 Total 1039193001420013614 Valencia 2018–19 La Liga 32180—10[lower-alpha 4]1—502 2019–20 La Liga 35110—8[lower-alpha 5]11[lower-alpha 6]0452 2020–21 La Liga 35410———364 2021–22 La Liga 19120———211 Total 121712000182101529 Atlético Madrid 2021–22 La Liga 1000—00—10 Brøndby 2022–23 Danish Superliga 24100—00—241 2023–24 Danish Superliga 17130———201 Total 41230—00—442 Career total 47750475534351058363\n\nClose\n\nInternational\n\nAs of match played 22 September 2022[29]\n\nMore information National team, Year ...\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year National teamYearAppsGoals Denmark 201140 201250 201310 201410 201530 201620 201700 201800 201940 202060 2021151 202230 Total441\n\nClose\n\nScores and results list Denmark's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Wass goal.[29]\n\nMore information No., Date ...\n\nList of international goals scored by Daniel Wass No. Date Venue Opponent Score Result Competition 11 September 2021Parken Stadium, Copenhagen, DenmarkScotland1–02–02022 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nClose\n\nValencia\n\nCopa del Rey: 2018–19[30]\n\nIndividual\n\nSuperliga Team of the Month: September 2023[31]\n\nDaniel Wass national team profile at the Danish Football Association(in Danish)\n\nDaniel Wass at BDFutbol\n\nDaniel Wass at ForaDeJogo (archived)\n\nDaniel Wass at Soccerway\n\nDaniel Wass at National-Football-Teams.com\n\nDaniel Wass – French league stats at Ligue 1 – also available in French"
