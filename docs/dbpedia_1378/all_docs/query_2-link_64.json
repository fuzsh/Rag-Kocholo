        "text": "HE HAS SIGNED A CONTRACT UNTIL 2023\n\nWelcome, Wass!\n\nThe Denmark international is a new Atleti player. Our club and Valencia have reached an agreement over the transfer of the right-back, who has signed a contract until 2023.\n\nAlvaro Martínez Irigaray\n\nAtlético de Madrid and Valencia have reached an agreement over the transfer of Daniel Wass. The Dane, who was born on May 31, 1989, has signed a contract until 2023.\n\nWass is a versatile player, who started off as a full-back and defender before moving up the pitch into midfield – where he has also played in central and wide positions. In the past few seasons, he has played as a right-back. His quality has allowed him to perform well all over the pitch.\n\nThe Dane grew up at BK Avarta, before joining Brondby at 17. He made his first team debut in the 2006/07 season. In 2009, Wass joined Norwegian club Fredrikstad on loan, before returning to Brondby the following year. He then signed for Benfica and joined Évian on loan. His performances for the French club earned him a permanent move to the Ligue 1 side, where he stayed until 2015. He went on to make 147 appearances for Évian – scoring 27 goals and providing 13 assists.\n\nWass then joined Celta, where he became a key figure over the course of three seasons. After 136 games, 14 goals and 20 assists, the Dane was signed by Valencia in 2018. His versatility has also allowed him to shine at Mestalla, where he has produced 15 goals and 20 assists in 152 matches.\n\nThe 32-year-old made his debut for the Denmark national team in 2011 and has so far made 41 appearances. At Euro 2020, he was a starter and played five games for the team that reached the competition’s semi-finals.\n\nA talented, versatile and experienced player joins Atleti. His ability to play in defence and midfield and to make a difference on both ends of the pitch makes him a valuable addition to Simeone’s side.\n\nWelcome, Daniel Wass!"
