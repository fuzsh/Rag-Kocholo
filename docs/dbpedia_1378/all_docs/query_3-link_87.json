        "text": "Please introduce yourself.\n\nMy name is William and I’m 14 years old. I live in Gladsaxe, Denmark and play for the Gladsaxe Gators. I’ve been playing softball since two and a half years. I’m playing for the U15, U19 and second division team. I have been playing for the national team since almost one year. I am a pitcher and I play first base and outfield.\n\nWhat made you want to play softball?\n\nMy opposite neighbor Lukas Lohmann plays softball too. I saw him playing at the end of our road one time. I went to a summer camp to try it too and I fell in love with the game.\n\nCan you tell me something about softball in your country?\n\nIn Denmark it's a really small sport. There are nine clubs and we have seven levels to play in. We have U12, U15, U19, the first and second division, women's division and slow pitch. For the national teams we have five age categories: boys U16, U19, men's, girls U19 and women's. Girls and boys are on the same team in the young leagues because it’s not possible to make separate girls and boys teams since there are not enough players. But I don’t think it’s a problem because I got many girls- and boyfriends on that behalf.\n\nHow often do you practice with your national team and what do they look like?\n\nIt's different for each level how often we practice and what we do during the practices. But we practice almost once a month. When we were practicing or the European Championship, we met in some weekend three or four months before the tournament.\n\nWhat's your best experience with the national team so far?\n\nIt was the European Championship for boys U16 in Prague last year. We ended at the third place.\n\nWhat's your goal for the 2018 season?\n\nMy goal for 2018 is to be better in the season (my pitching, at bats and my overall speed). Of course I would also like to get into the U19 national team.\n\nWho's your role model and why?\n\nI always have a good eye on some of my teammates who are playing in the first division because they always help when you need help. From the MLB it's Jose Bautista from the Toronto Blue Jays because he is a good player and his personality is how I want to be.\n\nDo you have a pre-game routine?\n\nI always listen to music and eat a good meal in the morning. When it comes to lacing my cleats, I always start with the left one.\n\nDo you think there is something we could do to make softball more popular in Europe?\n\nHere in Denmark it would be nice if the news would talk about softball for example after a European- or World Championship like they do with soccer and handball. It would also be good if the matches could be seen on live television.\n\nWhat do you think is the key to a successful team?\n\nA good and concentrated practice and a coach with goals and expectations of what he wants from the team. I also think the key is a good coach that can motivate his team and get the best out of them.\n\n- Romy Marinus -"
