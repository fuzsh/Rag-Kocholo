F. Parsons, executive sec- retary to the president; Mr. F. Stanton, Bursar; Miss Ella Olesen, Registrar; Mr. E. F. Mason, University Editor, and Miss Belle Sweet, Librarian. Mrs. Blomquist acts as assistant dean of women. Mr. L. F. Parsons, ex- ecutive secretary, acts as comptroller for the uni- versity. He estimates the needs of the institution and the way in which these needs are to be met. He makes up a_ budget which he presents to the president, who gives it to the Board of Education to be passed on. Mr. Parsons coordinates the requirements of different departments and then outlines a program as to how the money is to be spent. This includes not only the money from the state, but also federal money. Mr. Parsons is executive secretary to the president. Mr. Stanton, Bursar, must properly account for and report upon the receipts connected with university operation and maintenance. He collects all fees and de- posits from students at time of registra- tion, and all board and room accounts from residents of dormitories. He vouch- ers all claims against the university, and orders all supplies and equipment pur- chased for the university, upon presenta- tion of a properly authorized requisition. He also handles accounts for all trust funds. Miss Ella Olesen, University Registrar, is responsible for scholastic records of class Olesen Mason Sweet enrollment, attendance, credits, matricula- tion of new students, and keeping detailed records in connection with all of these things. Miss Olesen is secretary of the Academic Council, which is the executive committee of the faculty. Mr. Edward Mason, the University Ed- itor, has charge of the publication work. Pub- licity includes the news- paper publicity, and di- rect mail advertising cor- respondence with pros- pective students. This work also includes the editing of the Catalog of the University of Idaho. Mr. Mason is secretary of the faculty and has charge of instructional work in journalism. Iss BELLE SWEET. as University Li- brarian, is directly re- sponsible for the effi- cient management of the library, which consists of approximately §87,- 000 volumes, including state and government documents, beside several hundred pamphlets. It receives regularly 390 American and foreign pe- Stanton riodicals, both general and technical. Mrs. Louise Blomquist, as assistant dean of women, occupies the office of the dean of women part time, in addition to looking after Forney Hall with its 110 girls. She acts as assistant to Miss French in all the problems arising in the office of the dean of women, and during any ab- sence of Dean French, Mrs. Blomquist as- sumes full responsibility for the activities of the students. She also works with the students whenever possible as advisor. Parsons Blomquist University Women Permeal J, ISS PERMEAL J. FRENCH came M to the University of Idaho in the year of 1908 to accept the appoint- ment as first Dean of Women. Although she came with the intention of staying for one year, Miss French has been at the uni- versity continuously since that time with the exception of a one- year leave of absence in 1920-21. Born in Ida- ho City, Ida- ho, partially educated in the Gem State schools, first woman to hold a state superinten- dent of public instruction position, summarizes the history to the present of a true native of Idaho and a vital figure in state education- al work today. Through her years of service at the uni- versity Dean French has maintained a set of student regulations that have only been changed when better cooperation resulted from such _ altera- tions. One of the dean's first official acts was to make it compulsory for “out - of - town women to live on the campus. This requirement _necessi- tated the building of women's residences to satisfy the demands of accommodation, and today it is a ruling that practically every university in the United States is ei- mentary schools of / French, M.

Dean French has always been an advo- cate of woman's self-government, and in 1920 she urged them to compile a set of feasible regulations. The girls worked on the project only to decide that the rules which the dean had put in force were the best and needed no changes. Daleth Teth Gimel, or the Associated Town Women, was organized in 1922 under the direc- tion of Dean French. It now includes more than 100 women living in Moscow and the mem- bers of the association ad- here to the same regula- tions that direct the living policies of the women on the campus. This year a chap- ter of Daleth Teth Gimel was installed ‘at Pullman, These two chapters are the only ones of their kind in the United States and are desirable in that they organize those girls who do not live in groups on the campuses. Besides her activities as Dean of Wom- en, Miss French has in several ways been instrumental in deter- mining the character of the uni- versity. She is directly responsi- ble for several of Idaho's tradi- tions. In 1910 Dean French start- ed the Bury-the-Hatchet dance, a function to bring peace between the warring sophomore and the freshman classes. The same year she pro- moted the first campus day program, which remains as a tradition with few al- terations. Another year Miss French start- ed the custom of singing Christmas carols around a lighted tree on the campus. in and public further She Miss University Faculty J. Glover Eldridge, Ph.

This visit was made while they were en route to Naples, Italy. iby SAS was 8, 1875, in Doctor Hi ¢ has done While in the French city, Dean Eldridge gave a lec- ture to his friend's par- geaduate work in Germany and France. Doctor Eldridge start- ed his professorship at the Unt- versity of Idaho in 1901, and ed to it the present in- cumbent, Professor J. G. Eldridge, of the depart- ment of modern lan- guages, His duties at that since 1903. time involved the chair- manship of certain important committees, particularly the committee on admissions and courses, a work which was later di- vided among three committees. Two years later, the position of registrar was left vacant and his duties were temporarily transferred to the dean's office In 1920 Dr. A. H. Upham came to the University of Idaho to accept the presidency of the in- stitution. He organized com- mittees on scholarship, courses of study, and the granting of de- grees, and it became Doctor Eldridge’s du- ties as dean of the faculty to act as chair- man at these meetings. In 1925 the com- mittees were merged into an Academic Council, with Dr. Upham as the chair- man and Dean Eldridge the vice chairman. In case of the absence of the president, Doctor Eldridge takes charge, and makes the reports to faculty members concerning the business transacted. In the latter part of January, 1927, has been dean of the faculty ishioners. It was after their tour through Italy and Southern France, that Dean Eldridge entered as a student in the University of Paris for a two months’ post-graduate course. At the end of this term, Dean Eldridge intends to make an extensive tour through Germany and then he and Mrs. Eldridge will be ready to re- turn to America. Letters to faculty mem- bers say they are enjoying the trip. The Doctor and Mrs. Eld- ridge will return to the University this September, in time for Doc- tor Eldridge to continue his work as the Dean of the Fac- ulty, and the head of the Department of Modern Languages. 27 College of Letters and Science M. F. Angell, Ph. D., Dean HE College of Letters and Science [ies shown marked development un- der the direction of Dean M. F. An- gell. In the past two years the college has maintained a somewhat increased and more uniform requirement of scholarship in all its departments and with this there has been a fair increase in enrollment. The for- mation of Phi Beta Kappa, which is not open to students of vocations, is a definite indication of the high rating of this school. The College of Letters and Science has the only non-profession- al curriculum in the uni- versity. This school is the nucleus of the university. It was the first department formed in the university and out of it others have grown. Al- though the recent establishment of the School of Business Administration as a separate department decreased the enroll- ment in the College of Letters and Science about 300 stu- dents, there are now 655 en- rolled compared with 987 two years ago. The Dean makes consulta- tion with stu- dents, one of the most important parts of the teaching work. Espe- cially is this true in the sophomo r e M., F.

All stu- dents feel free to go to Dean Angell and consult with him re- garding any difficulty that they may have. Besides Dean Angell’s capacity as Dean of the College of Letters and Science he is chairman of the faculty athletic committee which gave us our present coach, secretary of the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Conference, and is direct- ly responsible for the de- velopment of the depart- ment of physics of which he has been professor since 1913. Assisting Dean Angell as profes- sors in the college are: Dr. J. E. Wodsed- alek, professor of Zoology and Entomol- ogy; C. W. Chenoweth, professor of Phil- osophy; E. O. Bangs, professor of Mu- sic; David MacMillan, director of Physical Education; J. G. Eldridge, professor of Modern Languages; Colonel E. R.

The college maintains laboratories for agricultural chemistry, agricultural en- gineering, agronomy, animal husbandry, bacteriology, dairy husbandry, horticul- ture, plant pathology and poultry. The College of Agriculture was created in 1908, with E. E. Elliot appointed first dean. He was followed by Dean W. L. Carlyle, who carried on the work of the college until it was taken over by Dean Iddings, in 1915. The institution has shown consistent development since its cre- ation, and the extension work which it promotes has been greatly beneficial to the state.

The college is in possession of many large silver loving cups which were awarded to the institu- tion for the showing the prize winning live stock has made in the exhibitions. The School of Practi- cal Agriculture, an orga- nization within the Col- lege of Agriculture, is maintained for the pur- pose of providing practi- cal agricultural training for men who lack the necessary preparation, or the time, for the regular courses in Agriculture. The instruction within the school is made as practical as possible and deals primar- ily with up-to-date farm practices in the various phases of agriculture. Graduates of the course should be qualified to be- come successful farmers, managers of live- stock, or other agricultural enterprises. As- sisting the dean in his work are: H. E. Lattig, M. S.; F.

In 1911 Professor MacLane left the university to become a dis- trict judge, and he was replaced by O. E. Mc- Cutcheon, who at that time was a member of the Univer- sity Board of Regents. Dean McCut- cheon remained at the University of Idaho un- til 1913. He was fol- lowed by Dean George D. Ayers (1913-1917), acting Dean J. J. Gill (1917-1918), Dean O. P. Cock- erill (1918-1923), and Dean Robert Mc- Nair Davis, in 1923. The purpose of the present administra- tion in the College of Law has been to improve the standards of legal education at the university and to cooperate with the commission ers of the Idaho Bar in bringing about higher re- quirements for admission into the legal profes- sion. Students entering the law school are re- quired to have a more thorough pre-legal train- ing than has _ previ- ously been customary. EAN i te eR, Missouri. University of | of 1923.

Progress is manifest in that graduate students are forging to the front in the le- gal profession and are holding important official positions in Idaho and elsewhere. With the cooperation of the law faculty it is the function of the dean to formulate policies of professional education for the state and to cooperate with the bar associations, the Association of Amer- ican Law Schools, and bar examiners in making possible adequate prepa- ration for service at the bar and on the bench, Dean Davis advocates service as the ultimate motive of the embryo lawyer. He encourages students to study law for the vast amount of good that can be done from an ethical standpoint and not from any mercenary gain that might be had. Assisting Dean Davis in the instruction of jurisprudence are: J. J: Gill, LL. B.; S. A. Harris, A. B., J. D.; F. L. Mechem, Ph. B., LL. B. Professor Mechem, who has only been at Idaho for one year, re- placed M. H. Merrill, for- merly a professor in the law department, who is now teaching in the Uni- versity of Nebraska law school. The members of the teaching staff do not practice law, but give all their time to instruction and research in the department. This pro- vision which limits the scope of activity for the professors enables them to give more time to interviews with law students. McNair Davis | and the | Dean College of Engineering Ivan C.

Economic opera- tion, conservation, and reforestation are vital questions in the final solution of which, the United States government and the state, including its educational system, and the lumber industry are supposed to camps that are short distances from the Uni- versity of Ida- cooperate. The function of the School of Forestry is to assist in the solution of these prob- lems by affording facili- ties for instruction in for- estry, and by encourag- ing the scientific manage- ment of forest resources. The success of the school FRANCIS GARNER MIL- LER was born June 2. 1866, in Lauarck, Illinois.

He was appointed Dean of the School of Forestry at Idaho in 1917. ho, give the students ex- ceptional advantages to do research work and get the practical experiences of foresters and lumbermen. Some of the largest sawmills and logging camps in the United States may be reached from the university. The school sends students out at all seasons of the year to study the mills, logging camps, virgin and cut-over forests, and other conditions involved in the study of forestry. As the faculty maintain, the best laboratory is the forest, and as much time should be spent there as is nec- essary for ac- quiring a thor- ough and prac- tical knowledge of details. Sta- tistics show that Idaho ranks fourth among the states of the union in the wealth of her forests. depends on the magni- tude of the field, its sci- entific bearing and standard, and the re- lationship which it maintains with the public schools, the lumber industry, and the agencies of the state and national gov- ernments. By maintaining the Arbore- tum, a tract of land comprising approxi- mately eighteen acres, the school affords the students sound, practical work in studying — silviculture and dendrology. The School of Forestry also has a section of land about six miles from Moscow, which is maintained as a demonstration forest. Dean Miller has been persistent in his efforts to develop the School of Forestry, and is largely responsible for its present reputation’ and high national standing. Assisting the dean in his department are: Ernest E. Hubert, Ph. D.; Clarence W. Watson, M. F.; Harry I. Nettleton, B. S. (For.); E. G. Wiesehuegel, B. S. (For.). Professor Wiesehuegel was add- ed to the staff this fall. School of Mines Francis A. Thomson, E, M,, Dean HE Idaho School of Mines, with Te A. Thomson as its dean, is the only one in the Northwest showing a steady and consistent growth. Begin- ning with the spring of 1925 a marked stimulus has been noted in the mining in- dustry of Idaho due to significant discov- eries in the south-central part of the state. There has also been a marked improvement in the mining industry throughout the west as a whole. These facts have had an interesting effect upon the attendance at the School of Mines, in their researches. Members of the staff have also frequently addressed various public bodies of a professional or commercial character and have discussed topics of in- terest and importance in their various fields. At the present time we have at Idaho far more students enrolled in the School of Mines than the U ni- : versity of Washington, notwithstanding the fact that the University of Washington has a total enrollment of over three 4 A. THOMSON, D. Sc., E. * M., was born in 1879, Greenwich, England. He re- ceived his higher education at Columbia College, New West- minster, B.

He was appointed Dean of the School of Mines at the University of Idaho in that public interest has 1917, been renewed in the min- eral industry throughout the state and has led a larger number of young men to en- roll in the school. The conspicuous success of the gradu- ates of the aniversity, trained in mining and metallurgy, is becoming more and more evident. From Alaska to Mexico and from Eastern Canada to New Caledonia, the _ university mining alumni are to be found filling ex- ecutive positions in the mineral industry. The state-wide work of the School of Mines in its cooperative relations with the State Bureau of Mines and Geology, with the United States Bureau of Mines, is ex- panding and is met with increasing recog- nition both within and without the boun- daries of Idaho. The work of the School of Mines is carried on in an atmosphere of applied and practical research because of its state connection. Various papers and reports have been written and pub- lished by the members of the School of Mines and cooperating staffs, based upon times as many students as at the University of Idaho. Such a condition is partially due to the personnel of the Idaho school fac- ulty, and to the location of Moscow, which is situated in the heart of the most diversely productive mineral region of the world. Within a radius of 300 miles has been produced mineral worth more than $2,000,000.000, most of it in the last 25 years. Besides Dean Thompson, the faculty consists of: E. W.. Ellis, as- sistant profes- sor of Mining and Metallur- zy: F. B. Lan- ey, professor of Geology; V.R. D. Kirk- ham, assis- tant profes- sor of Ge- ology. School of Education J. Franklin Messenger, Ph. D., Dean HE organization of the School of \"[ sucation as an independent unit of the University of Idaho was author- ized by the Board of Regents in June, 1920. With Doctor Messenger as its dean, the school shows rapid and consistent growth, In 1920 there were twenty-three students including three graduate students in the School of Education. The number of graduat- ing students was increas- ed to seventy-nine in 1926, and eight students were conferred Masters’ degrees in that year. Another source that gives evidence of the rap- *Ph.

Statistics show that approximately five hundred per cent more students are teaching in the state than were in 1920. In addition to this, at one time three of the highest state of- fices concerned with educational work in_ Idaho, were held by grad- uates of the School of Education at the University of Ida- ho. They includ- ed the Commis- sioner of Educa- tion, the Idaho State Superinten- dent of Pub- lic Instruc- tion, the State High School In- FRANKLIN was He worked for his B.

It is obvious that She the graduates from the uni- versity have gone quickly into influential positions in educational work in the state, and there are considerably more students teaching in Washington, Oregon and California, than there are in Idaho. Dean Messenger is en- thusiastic with his efforts to continue the growth and standing of the school. The fact that he is a fellow of the Ameri- can Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Psychological Association, and a member of the National Association of College Teachers of Edu- cation, in itself indicates Dean Messen- ger’s national standing as a progressive ed- ucator. His work at the University of Idaho has already brought results. The services of the school are at the dis- posal of teachers who wish to improve themselves while in service. Assisting the dean in the work of the school, which consists in training high school teachers, principals, superintendents and supervisors, are: Philip Soulen, M. A., Professor of School Administration; J. Wesley Barton, Ph. D., Professor of Psychology: Ralph D. Russell, Ph. D.., Professor of Secondary Education; Herbert E. Lattig, M. S.

Dale was ap- pointed as its first dean. The organizing of the school is resultant of a gradual and consistent growth in the enrollment of classes, and the addition of new courses that make up the curriculum for a business department. The catalog for the years 1894-1895 was the first to list any instruction in political science and economics. With the coming of President MacLean to the university in 1901, con- tinuous instruction was offered by the president in the field of political science, which included one or two courses in economics. The major emphasis, how- ever, was laid on government. Following President MacLean’s resignation in 1913, an associate professor of economics was appointed who gave the department a dis- tinctly “‘economic’’ slant. A _ year later, it was called for the first time the Depart- ment of Economics and Political Science. In 1915-1916 plans creating a separate Department of Busi- ness Administration were announced, and the following year under a professor of commerce, courses in advertising, retail store management, aud- iting, statistics, etc., were offered. In 1917-1918 the separate department of commerce was consolidated with the Department of Economics and Political Science. In 1922, on recommendation of the president of the university, there was announced the creation of a curriculum in ik School of Business Administra- M.. 1920, 1925. 35 HIARRISON Cc was born March 7, | 1885, in Massachusetts. educated at Harvard University and after instructing at univer- sities in Utah, Washington and Wyoming. he came to Idaho in He was made the Idaho School of Business in In 1907-08, Dean Dale did research work abroad. business with five majors organized with- in the college of Letters and Science, in- CR (Se cluding among its re- quired subjects, courses offered by the faculties of the other schools and colleges as well.

In 1921 there were only fifteen graduate students registered in the university, and there were only two Masters’ degrees conferred.

Besides his capacity as Dean of the Graduate School, Dr. Wodsedalek is head of the Department of Zoology, one of the largest science depart- ments in the university. He is chairman of the Graduate Council, chair- man of the University Research Commit- tee, and director of the Pre-Medical and Pre-Nursing Curricula. Dr. Wodsedalek is directly responsible for the development of the Graduate School, and he is largely responsible for a chapter of Sigma Xi, national honorary scientific fraternity, at Idaho. He is a devoted scientific investigator, and his ex- tensive publications have made him one of the most widely known educators in the state. He is appointed by the Ameri- can Association for the Ad- vancement of Science, as a committee of one in connec- tion with the freedom of teaching, science, and re- search, in the state of Idaho.

THE GEM OF THE MOUNTAINS—1927 Associated Student Body University of Idaho N ORGANIZED body for the A pensation of collegiate and in- ter-collegiate activities, the As- sociated Students of the Univer- sity of Idaho is now an entity that is composed of approximately 2000 stu- dents. Every person enrolled in the university who has paid the regular association dues is a member. The entity is responsible for the charac- ter and attractiveness of the _ university. Through the efforts of its members, func- tions are started, continued, and are made __ traditional. The body fosters and encourages ath- letics, debate, music and publications. It has expression through its executive agencies. the gradu- ate manager, the president of the stu- dent body and other members of the exec- utive board. Consistent growth in the enrollment of the university and the development of characteristics through the process of time have made the institution desir- able and distinctive. The association boasts of a decidedly democratic spirit that has grown with the university: student greets student with a “‘hello”’ whether the meeting individuals are acquainted. This custom may be traced back to the time when only a few well-acquainted students consti- tuted the associated group, and only a few students worked toward the ob- jectives which to an extent can now be realized. The student body association for the 1926-27 school year has carried on its activities with such success as is HARRY BAUGHMAN, 38 expected with the aid of increased numbers and the guidance of prece- dent. A laudable spirit has been man- ifest in supporting all association ac- tivities. NTHUSIASM reached its peak in the fall when the association was preparing for the annual W. S. C.- Idaho grid contest. A week prior to the game, peppy demonstrations com- menced and contin- ued up to the time scheduled for the an- cient rivals to meet in combat. Power- ful spotlights placed on the Adminstra- tion tower and on the bleachers served the two-fold purpose of furnishing light for night workouts and preventing mar- auding W. S. C. stu- dents from defiling the campus. By the aid of this lighting, Freshmen guarded the campus at night from possible inva- sion; large groups of students went from house to house singing their praises of the Gem state. The night before the contest, the an- nual pajama parade was held. Everyone interested in the Univer- sity of Idaho is eagerly looking for- ward to the construction of the pro- posed Memorial Building, which is expected to be started this year. The Alumni Association, the American Le- gion and the students of the univer- sity have contributed to the fund to build the gymnasium that Idaho needs. At the time of this publica- tion definite information concerning the structure of the building was not obtainable. President THE GEM OF THE MOouUNTAINS—1927 The Executive Board of the A. S. U. I. HE Executive Board of the A. S. U. I. was organized in 1924, when Talbot Jennings was pres- ident of the student body. The constitution incorporating an Execu- tive Board was accepted by the student body and passed by the Board of Regents March first. The Executive Board has charge of all depart- ments of the A. S. U. I. It examines the accounts and reports of all offi- cers of the association, makes temporary ap- pointments to fill all va- cancies occurring in the offices of the association, and has complete control over all A. S. U. I. prop- erty. The executive board exercises powers over all A. S. U. I. or- ganizations, including publications; it passes rules and regulations for the general welfare of the student body, bring- ing all questions before the students when it is deemed advisable. The executive board passes on all student body, class and organized functions which are held on the campus. It regulates the soliciting of advertising, oan appoints student manag- Ross i N ers, levies all student as- ferrill sessments, approves all expenditures from the fund created by student as- sessments as provided for in the by- laws of the A. S. U. I. constitution. and grants all athletic letters, and all other insignia within its jurisdiction. The Executive Board consists of the three officers of the A. S. U. I. asso- ciation; the president, who acts as the chairman of the board, vice president, 39 and secretary; also six members who are elected—two men members and one woman member from the incom- ing Senior class, and two men mem- bers and one woman member from the incoming Junior class. A member of the university faculty appointed by the president of the universi- ty from recommenda- tions of the executive board, and a resident alumnus appointed by the president of the Uni- versity of Idaho Alumni Association from recom- mendations submitted by executive board, are ex - officio members without vote. T THE present time the Executive Board consists of Harry Baugh- man, president: George Austin, vice president; Anna McGonigle, _ sec- retary; Beardslee Merrill and Frank Click, Junior men, and Alice Ross as Junior woman. Arthur Emerson and Edson Morris are senior men, and Josephine Keane is senior woman. Dean Crawford is serving his third year as faculty ad- MicConiahe visor. Because of his worn . Click broad - minded outlook Emerson on student problems, his intense interest in everything concern- ing the university, and his coopera- tive spirit he is a vital member of the board. This is also Mr. Baughman’s third year on the board, having served One year as junior man, one as senior man, and the third year as president of the A. S. U. I. The alumni are interested in the actions of the board and represented by Harold Cornelison. THE GEM OF THE MOUNTAINS—1927 The Graduate Manager of the A. S. U. I. HE graduate manager is an alumnus of the University of Idaho, appointed by the presi- dent of the university in consul- tation with the executive board, and is the business head of the A. S. U. L., in that he has charge of all property and funds of the association. The graduate manager has general control of athletics, publications, debate, music, dramatics and inter-collegiate compe- tition in stock judging, the six major departments of the student body, subject to the general supervision of the Executive Board of the Associated Students. George E. Horton, grad- uated from the University of Idaho in 1906, com- menced his activities as graduate manager in the fall of 1925. Besides his duties as general manager of ‘the: A. S: U. I,,. Mr: Horton is secretary-treasur- er of the Alumni Associa- tion, and the Memorial Building Association. Pri- or to 1925, he instructed for two years at the univer- sity engineering shops, and taught one year in the mechanical de- partment during the last war. In 1900 George Horton was captain of the football team that defeated the Universities of Washington and Spo- kane for the Northwest champion- ship. ‘‘Cap’’ is also a baseball and track man of the university. He was a member of the committee which drafted the first constitution for the A I., and was a member of the first committee to make athletic awards. In 1905 he was under-grad- uate football manager and brought the University of Washington to Moscow for a game which resulted in a cham- pionship victory. To bring a foot- GEORGE 40 HORTON ball team from such a distance as Se- attle in the days when Idaho had hardly enough players to make two squads was considered a major busi- ness promotion. After he had grad- uated, Mr. Horton was alumni rep- resentative on the executive board for two years. These activities scarcely summarize the manager's history in re- gard to his career with the university. His work and interests have distinguished him as one of the most ag- gressive and popular of Ida- ho Alumni; the pseudo- nym “Cap” has followed him through the years since he was captain of the foot- ball team in 1900, and he is known and called by that name in the university today. ESIDES having charge of and accounting for all A. S. U. I. property and funds, the graduate man- ager supervises the expend- iture of all class funds which are deposited in the student treasury. The graduate manager is assist- ed by student managers of the de- partments and organizations. Work- ing in cooperation with the student _ managers, the graduate supervisor has a better chance to know the needs and conditions of the departments, and the assisting managers have ample oppor- tunity to keep well posted on the fi- nancial standing of the association. At the beginning of each semester, the graduate manager and his assistants compile an A. S. U. I. budget to sub- mit to the executive board for its ap- proval. The graduate manager is re- sponsible to the executive board for the proper expenditure of the ap- proved budget for each department. daho Yesterday alk | a Je thbeld=t1 ntdptdaganns UT SS Se ae a: ae ae ae r= | The past may be compared to a shrine in the coigne of some sea cliff, whither the white birds of recollection come to roost and rest a while and fly away again into the darkness.

A look between the covers of usually a girl, for ankles were hidden in our early annuals will carry us back to those days—invariably got mixed up with the Idaho of not so long ago, and reveal to us the life and times of Idaho of Yesterday. October 3, 1892, was the formal opening date of the University of Ida- ho. The first Board of Regents had ap- the wire, and eight o'clocks had to be postponed until the fair victim was dis- entangled. As the ‘*Reminiscences’’ of the first GEM OF THE MOUNTAINS have it, “‘I still have visions of an old road—there was no “Erected by the Commonwealth of Idaho” pointed James H.

HEN the doors were opened only one-third of the Administration Building was fin- ished. The rest of it was still in con- struction, and wet plaster was every- road was ankle deep and through this waded eager boys and girls in search of an education.” EVENTEEN young scholars appear- ed the first morn- ing. There was no furniture for two weeks, so they reg- istered on the arch- itect’s table. Then President Gault lined them up in the hall, since there was nothing to sit on, and gave them the first University ad- Idaho's First and Lest Presidents 42 The Campus in 1902 dress. Among other things he remarked that not many universities gave students such standing the first day. Then they adjourned, to meet again two weeks later. HEN classes were finally taken up the administration discovered that of the thirty-two students then registered only a few were qualified to enter university courses. This led to the establishment of a preparatory department, which was much larger than the regular university. There were first year preps, second’ year preps and third year preps: at the bottom of the educational ladder were the sub- preps. In fact, the University was fur- nishing fourth grade education to some of its students. The preps continued un- til 1913. They were a large group, and felt their responsibility. They boasted of their achievements, as did all the regular classes. Class rivalry was keen—class pride was strong. Everything was class. There were no electives in the scientific and English courses in those days. Stu- dents in the so-called “classical course” revelled in five hours of electives in four years of their college course. But the bur- dens of an education were lightened by the very informal modes of obtaining it. An early annual says, Many rules now in Tie Olt “Aa\" force in the University were unnecessary at that time. The life of the student was a free and happy one. To see a student chasing another around the room and the teacher after both was not unusual.\"’ An example of this “free and happy life’’ was the joke played on President Gault by the biology class. The biology class—which, by the way, consisted of three members— had been presented with a skeleton as an aid to its studies. At that time there was only one telephone in the building. It was in a booth in the hall, and was used by students and faculty alike. Not even the president had a private phone, so he had to make frequent trips to the booth. One morning the biology class brought its skeleton out and put it in the booth. President Gault walked down the hall and opened the door. He peered within, and noticed the rather skinny figure draped over the telephone. ‘‘I beg your pardon,” he murmured, and withdrew. A few min- utes later he came out again. The figure was still there, in the same position. The third time this hap- pened the president smelled a rat, or per- haps it was the odor generally associated with skeletons. At any rate he investi- gated, and found that the occupant had ceased long ago to care anything about Building the phone service. 43 The University enrollment was more than a hundred by the end of the first year. Students from southern Idaho began to come in, most of them after the first day of registration. Railroad connections were rather uncertain, and many were the modes of travel adopted to reach Moscow. As late as 1896 students came up from south Idaho on pack horses, camping along the way. T WAS undoubtedly during this first year that the “Hello” spirit started. Every- body knew everybody else, and naturally everyone said ‘‘Hello.’’ As the Univer- sity grew, of course, it became impossible to know every student, but the custom per- sisted. Today it is a fine indication of the democracy that is so characteristic of Idaho. The first student organization, the Am- phictyon Society, appeared on the cam- pus November 18, 1892. At first only for men, it soon became co-educational, but in 1903-1904 withdrew membership privileges to women. Their reason was not to discourage the unfair sex, but, as the club members so painstakingly put it, to “encourage the young ladies to form societies of their own, so that by constant interchange of ideas among themselves they might receive mental, moral and spir- itual benefit.\"’ The aims of the Amphic- tyon were primarily literary. It produced plays, literature and music. Since there was no graduating class the first year, and consequently no graduation, the Amphic- tyon gave the closing exercises in the spring of 1893, “The Websterian Literary Society,” says an old annual, ““was organized in the fall of 1893 as a boys’ debating club. For two years debating was the main feature, but the programs gradually took on more of the nature of a literary society. A live- ly time took place the second year over the admission of girls as members. The adherents to the girls’ cause finally won, and on the following year the co-eds were admitted to the full privileges of the so- ciety.\"\" Debating was by far the most important University activity; in fact, it was almost the only activity—it was a regulation. During the first few years every student was required to give two orations a year from the rostrum on as- sembly days. The custom must have been a fearful one, for “ Twas a pitiful, as well es as a ludicrous sight, to watch each poor victim tremble up the aisle, bow to the faculty which sat in a rigid line behind him, and then tremble through an ora- tion, before the eyes of his fellow students. One poor individual, whose memory failed him, upon reaching for his manuscript in his hip pocket, pulled forth a dog chain and retired in con- fusion.” HE Websterian Society was di- rectly responsible for the founding of the Argonaut. In 1898 the Society appointed a com- mittee to present the plan for a college paper before the As- sociated Students. The A. S.. U. f., however, feared to undertake what they thought would be a great financial risk, and the Web- sterian Society it- self refused to take the _ responsibility for the publication of a paper. So a member of the com- mittee which pre- sented the plan to the students took it upon himself to write, edit, publish and sell the paper for that year. The student body agreed, if the paper paid for itself, to undertake its publication the second year. The first issue of the paper appeared in December, 1898, under the title of The Argonaut, the Searcher of the Golden Fleece. It came out monthly, in the form of a magazine, for the remainder of that school year. Then came the reckoning. Mr. Guy Wolfe, who was business man- ager as well as being editor, had secured enough subscriptions to make the paper itself a paying proposition, but he discov- o “The Searchec of a ai a ‘ et ea Ee Bags SOVEMBIIE TM the 45 ered, to his subsequent sorrow, that not all the subscriptions were paying proposi- tions. On the books, therefore, the Argo- naut was free from debt, but in reality the editor was in the hole. He borrowed enough money from his father to pay the bills incurred by publication and spent the next summer working out his indebted- ness. But the Ar- gonaut had made good, and from then on became an organ of the Asso- ciated Students. HERE were many bright spots to lighten the gloom of a stu- dent's life. One of the most prominent was an_ honorable society known as the Terrible Four. Its requirements were not very strict, at least for those days. ‘‘Whenever a student would get into trouble’’ (seri- ous trouble—ordi- nary mischief didn’t count) “‘and come safely out he was elected an ‘onery’ member of the Ter- rible Four.’’ They sent, each month, a lengthy article signed in blood to the president, telling how the institution should be run. Membership in- creased from four to seven, and then the society died a natural death, its members graduating one by one. The Tin Can Brigade, or Company Q, was an offspring of the Terrible Four. Every evening the stalwart soldiers of the Company paraded through the town, sing- ing and playing accompaniments on their buckets and tin cans. When the Spanish-American War broke out in the fall of 1898, Lieutenant—now Golden Fleece” Colonel—Chrisman, in charge of the military post at the University, was ordered to the front. | Lieutenant Chrisman was the most popular man on the campus. He was idolized by students and faculty alike. The news of his going to war naturally increased the devotion of the Uni- versity for him. The night before he left a very sumptuous and very wet banquet was held in his honor. Earlier in the day a figure of Spain in effigy had been raised, and this figure, with highest military dishonors, was burned as part of the farewell celebration. The next day, when the lieutenant left, was the first Chrisman Day. Some of the boys got together and decided that in honor of the occasion there should be a holi- day. They didn’t ask the faculty’s permission, and there wasn’t any argument about the mat- ter—it was just a holiday. Early in the morning, be- fore classes took up, they barricaded the street—there was only one way to get to the campus then—took the girls’ lunch boxes away from them, and told them that there would be no recitations that day. Some of the young ladies were peeved, and the faculty, when they heard about it, objected heatedly, but a holiday it was. Chrisman Day was observed for several years after that, although Colonel Chrisman himself did not return permanently until many years later. It was about this time that the Senior Sneak—the annual free- for-all pilgrimage of the graduating class—began, but there is probably no connection between the two tra- ditions. Burning Spain in Effigy NE result of the Spanish-American War was the es- tablishment of the Old Guard. Thirty-nine Idaho students enlisted and went to the front. Thirty-seven | of them returned; two had died in the service of their country. It is in their honor that Memorial Day is held, and it was to their memory that the statue on the campus was erected. The thirty-seven returned soldiers parad- ed every year as the Old Guard, until they had all graduated, Then the custom was continued as an annual drill and review by the cadet batal- lion. The Old Guard has now degenerated into a bur- lesque parade which takes place every year in the after- noon of Campus Day.

It was established as a Junior Class tradition, and was published by the Juniors from 1903 to 1924, with the exception of 1905, when there was no annual, and 1920, when the A. S. U. I. sponsored its publication. The GEM is now an organ of the student body, published by the GEM fio: Us T. OF THE The first Book of the Vandals summed up the history MOUNTAINS of the University for the first ten years of its life. By 03 the time of the book’s appearance the University was firm- ly established, and Idaho spirit was strongly inculcated in The Fiest Book of the Vandals the minds of all the students. The GEM was a natural 46 When Vandal First Met Cougar expression of the desire of the student body fora record of its history and achieve- ments. It gives a wonderfully clear im- pression of University life at that time. The Idaho yell, boldly printed on the ti- tle page of the book, was Rah! Rah! Rah!—Rah! Rah! Rah! Idaho! Idaho!—Boom! Ba! Bah! , l ‘HE Idaho colors, says a foot-note, were yellow and white, ‘‘emblematical of the gold and silver mined so extensively in the state.’’ The University was a lively in- stitution—there can be no doubt about that. There were organizations and _ societies galore. There was a Mando- lin Club; Mandolin Clubbing seemed to be the favorite in- door sport at that time. There was even a University Quartet, which consisted of three faculty members and one student. Dean J. G. Eldridge, the only member of the faculty at that time who is here today, was a member of the quartet. Student life hasn't changed much, as peeps into this first annual show. Every now and then someone would have to ‘walk the carpet” —they still do. Girls wore ‘‘I\"’ sweaters then—they still do. Boys and girls lost their hearts on the landings when they were supposed to be perusing their lessons —twenty-five years later, with a new building, new stairways, and new land- ings, they still do. A football team was organized in 1894. The first game was with Washington State College, then Washington Agricul- tural College. A pep rally held before this game was the first of the annual bonfires — Pe TEL, vy Th — 5 st y! The Morning After and pep rallies held before the W. S. C. game. ‘Gub” Mix, one of the members of this first team, says, “We didn’t know a lot about football in ‘94, but we'd heard what a devil of a game it was, so we got busy organizing a team . . . Guy Wolfe, Ed Smith and I were subs. I was about fourteen then, and a prep to boot, but in those days they needed subs for football. I’m not sure that all the players attended college, but that was all right in ‘94. We had no eligibility rules; anyone who didn’t care what his face looked like afterwards was eligible. «Ce ye that was in January, '94. Sure, I know it was the wrong time of the year for football, but we knew Pullman had a team—yes, I know you call ’em W. S. C. nowadays, and that’s right, too, but I prefer to call ‘em Pullman—and we wanted a game quick with Pullman. We got it, too, in the spring of '94, in Mos- cow down on a mud flat where the Madi- son Lumber Company now stands .. . “Football suits! No, we didn’t have any football suits. We wore baseball pants and an old shirt; no nose-guards, no shin-guards, no padding. You see, the Blowing Down the Walls idea we had was that padding kept you from hurting the other fellow. We fig- ured the best way to save yourself from getting banged up was to knock out your opponent, so we stripped for action. We played old style, mass formation, center rush, three downs to make five yards. The halves dropped back, the quarter took the ball and passed it to the full-back. The halves grabbed the full-back, one on each side, the quarter hooked him by the belt, the ends came around behind and pushed and everybody took a running jump through center. Idaho won that game, won its first game of football and its first game with Pullman, 10 to 0.” Another game that year, with Lewis- ton, was lost by a score of 8 to 6. The day was rainy, the players were wet, the field was soggy, and the ball was slick. Gub Mix, the ‘‘fastidious quarterback,’ had a little difficulty in holding on to the Erecting the New Building ball. Between plays he picked the slippery oval up and wiped it on the grass, instead of on the spectators’ clothing. Lewiston claimed that the ball was in play, and charged. Idaho, bewildered by the sudden attack, and highly offended at such an unjust accusation, lost the ball, and Lew- iston made a touchdown. It was this same Gub Mix whose edu- cation cost the state so much money. Gub, who received a B. S. in Agriculture in 1901, constituted the first graduating class of the Agricultural College. He had been in the University as a prep and a reg- ular student for seven years, and was the first and only graduate that the Ag Col- lege had produced in ten years’ time. The Morrill fund, by which the Ag College Was maintained, began in 1890 with $15,- 000 and increased $1,000 per year. Since the fund had produced so far only one graduate, some rather caustic comment 48 was reorganized to exclude preparatory students, who formed an association of their own. The first setback in the career of the University came early in 1906. On Fri- day, March 30, at 2 o'clock in the morn- ing, fire was discovered in the Administra- tion Building. The janitor who slept in the building was awak- ened by the smoke and im- mediately gave the alarm. Campus and town turned out together to try to check the fire. By the prompt action of Francis Jenkins, Bursar, all the records were saved, but practically everything else was destroyed. The li- brary was completely de- molished. Nothing _ re- mained of the building it- self but the walls. which were soon blown down to clear the site for the new building. ihe Idaho's educational sys- tem had received a crush- ing blow. Students and faculty were be- Dean French—-Founder of Many of Beautiful Idaho Traditions wildered and hopeless. President MacLean, with his untiring energy and unfailing op- timism, set to work to reorganize the Uni- versity. Classes were held in the halls, in the gymnasium, and wherever there was a vacant room. Things were soon run- ning smoothly again, and Idaho spirit once more overcame seeming insurmountable difficulties. On October 11, 1911, the Seniors pro- posed a set of campus rules which were passed on by the Assem- bly. The reg- ulations in cluded salut- ing the presi- dent, uncov- ering of the head in sing- ing “Alma M ater.” freshman nu- meral paint- ing and wear- ing of the green cap. There were no rules as yet to govern the annual May Day, freshman-sophomore scrap. This tradi- tion must have started with the beginning of school, as an imitation of other schools which were doing the same thing. Acci- dents were frequent and serious, since any offense was within the laws of the game, there being no laws. In the fall of 1914 a particularly rough hazing aroused much unfavorable comment throughout the state. From that time on both classes were watched rather close- ly, while the faculty cast around for some means to regulate the affair. In 1915 Dean E. M. Hulme drew up a set of regula- tions governing all hostili- ties between the two classes. The scrap had formerly taken place on the 17th of March, but the date was now changed to the first Saturday after registration in the fall. Ac- cording to the Hulme plan, teams are picked from each class to engage in wrestl- ing, boxing, a tug o' war, and other sportsmanlike contests. This does away with all the old promiscuous hazing, while still allowing for the posting of the edicts and the general mix-up some night early in the fall. A fitting end to class hostili- ties is the Bury-the-Hatchet Dance, orig- inated in 1910 by Dean French. It was originally an under-classman event, but now an all-college dance is held the same night for the benefit of the juniors and seniors. HE fresh- men don the green cap at 1 o'clock in the after- noon the day of the Hulme Fight. If they win the fight they are allowed to remove it at the begin- ning of the T hanksgiv- ing vacation; if not, they wear it un- til Christmas. The cap ap- 1910 arose over the fact that it took $250,000 to educate Gub Mix. The University seems to have been the subject of political quarrels since the founding of the institution. The question of dividing the University has often arisen in the legislature. In 1899, to forestall any harmful legislation, it was decided to present a play before the legislators. Dr. Aurelia Reinhardt, the head of the Public Speaking Department, who is now the president of Mills College, set to work to produce two plays. ‘She Stoops to Con- quer’’ and ‘““The Rivals’’ were chosen. In the fall of 1899 the troups traveled to Boise. They played in several towns on the way there and back, always to packed houses. In Boise the plays were over- whelmingly successful, and University stock went up a hundred per cent. The cut shown on page 47 is a photograph of the cast in “The Rivals.’ Among the members of the cast are Mrs. Reinhardt, Honorable Burton L. French, Mr. B. W. Oppenheim, Honorable William E. Lee, and Mr. Homer David. HE first Freshman Glee, given in 1905, was the last of the class dances to be- come a tradition. The Senior Ball must The have existed from the very first year. Junior Prom appeared in 1902, and the first Sophomore Frolic was in 1904. The Athletic Ball started in 1908—the Mili- tary Ball in 1905. If one judges from contemporary accounts, the orchestras at all these early dances were always excel- lent, the decorations lavish, and the re- freshments superb. ‘‘Needless to say,” boasts one write-up, ‘“‘the punch bowl was the center of attraction.” During the second semester of the year 1903-04 the Associated Students of the University of Idaho was formed. The Athletic Board, Debate Council and Ar- gonaut Staff, all of which had been inde- pendent organizations, were now included in the general head of the Associated Stu- dents. The Athletic Association had con- sisted only of track and baseball. The football adherents had refused to join, since football was making money and the Association wasn't. But the Associated Students included all branches of activity. At first only students representing the University in an intercollegiate contest were members of the Associated Students. The present plan of having every student a member was adopted in the fall of 1904- 05. On March 30, 1910, the A. S. U. I.

The green cap was worn at least as early as 1911, since in that year campus rules provid- ed for its being worn by fresh- men. It is the distinguishing mark for freshmen men. Ju- niors wear cords. Senior men tarry canes and go bareheaded. Senior women sport swagger sticks. Sophomores wear any damn thing they can get their hands on. \"THe first Campus Day was held in May, 1910. Dean French was the initiator of this tradition. The main event was the May Fete, with the winding of the Maypole. The custom of improving the campus in the morning and having the May Festival in the afternoon was begun in 1914. On April 10, 1911, ex-President Roose- velt visited the University of Idaho. As a memorial to his visit he planted a tree— a Colorado blue spruce—on the campus just across the driveway from the Admin- istration Building. The spruce forms the south angle of a triangle of three trees, all of which were planted by chief executives of the United States. In 1912 Idaho's battle cry, “Idaho Fights,’ was first heard on the campus. The slogan was originated by John G. “Pink\"’ Griffith, then Idaho football coach. The first Song and Stunt Fest was held in the spring of 1915. The Fest consists of a stunt and a song given by each class, the best song and the best stunt receiving The Presidents’ Trees President Roosevelt on the Wheat Sacks a prize. The Fest is an excellent oppor- tunity for the development of any latent local talent. The war year of 1918 was a slim year for Idaho. A training camp had been es- tablished in town and nearly all the men were in training. Several Idaho students had already gone to France; more were go- ing as the year progressed. Idaho's rec- ord in the world struggle for democracy is something to be proud of. About 1500 Idaho men, alumni and students, enlisted. Nearly forty of them made the supreme sacrifice. An article in the 1920 GEM OF THE MOUNTAINS, written by President Lindley, gives testimony to Idaho's valor: “A young American soldier was found dead on a battlefield in France. Near him lay the bodies of four German soldiers. By the side of the American was a knife driven deeply into the ground—token of his victory in the unequal combat. The only mark of identification found on _ the American was a ring bearing the seal of the University of Idaho.” N MARCH, 1923, under the supervision of the English Club, the Blue Bucket maga- zine was founded. The pur- pose of the publication was to complete the cycle of stu- dent activities at the university —athletics, dramatics, debate, music, and a college maga- 51 zine. The name was chosen, “‘not for its al- literative qualities, but because it possesses both historic and sym- bolic significance. The blue bucket was the blue wooden bucket that swung beneath the covered wagons, drawn by slow-mov- ing oxen, that made their way across the gray sagebrush plains of the Snake River on the old Oregon Trail. In 1845 a party of em- igrants reported that somewhere between the crossing of the Snake and the John Day River they had seen gold nuggets in quantity enough to fill one of their blue buck- ets. This statement gave rise to a curious legend of the lost Blue Bucket diggings, a phantom mine that oc- casions persistent but futile search to this day in Idaho, Nevada and Oregon. The Blue Bucket has never been “E-dah-ho the Light Upon the Mountains pation to the present. Singing of Christ- mas carols is one of Idaho's most beautiful traditions. The stu- dents gather around the Christmas tree on the campus and sing old hymns of praise. The fall of 1926 saw the retirement of one of the most famil— iar figures on the Ida- hocampus. John Alm- quist was the oldest employe of the U. He had served for nearly 28 years as greenhouse manager, gardener, and then, for almost two decades, as general care- taker of the campus. The presentation of the Harvard Trophy cup for the best dis- play of sportsmanship in the annual football contest between Idaho and’ .W. .S. GC: 4s: a comparatively new tradition. Idaho has won the cup every time that it has been award- ed. Another custom hardly old enough to found, nor is it likely to be, although the search for it will go on until the last sour- dough has crossed the Divide.” be a tradition is Homecoming Day. One iron-clad custom rigidly enforced by the But the “‘I’’ Club is that no dates are allowed at spirit of seeking, the spirit that made the Blue Bucket mine all the more alluring because it was lost has been reincarnated to- day. The Blue Bucket expresses that constant search for the nuggets of life and literature, that constant pursuit of the un- attainable, that constant urge, as Kipling phrased it, of “Something hidden. Go and find tt. Go and look behind the ranges. Something lost behind the ranges— Lost and waiting for you. Go!” “The Light on the Moun- tains,’ the first Idaho pageant, was given at Commencement, 1923. It portrayed in drama, song and dance the history of the state from the Indian occu- any athletic contest in which Idaho participates. This tradi- tion, needless to say, is excep- tionally well observed. The “‘I’’ bench, under the trees on the campus, is used only by seniors. The planting of the ivy by each graduating class expresses the desire of Idaho students leaving the University for a memorial to them and their achievements. HUS through the years Ida- ho has changed and grown. It has met the most severe tests successfully; it has become a permanent, powerful influence on the student life in the state. And since all worthy things must depend upon their foun- dation, let us give due apprecia- tion to the Idaho of Yesterday. ‘ aad = a in ji id _ hh “cq EO Se eae a eee et al q aon J UT TIMED OT Ts enor oT MMMM MMMM MMT Sl eecessertersee {——————+4 estan j | + Se» Site - + See «a «cee When winter comes the choice few lie in order- ly array, each with his alloted place within the world.
