NEW YORK (AP) - Tom Cruise and Katie Homes are calling it quits after five years of marriage.

Holmes' attorney Jonathan Wolfe said Friday that the couple is divorcing, but called it a private matter for the family.

Cruise, 49, wed the 33-year-old Holmes in 2006 in an Italian castle after publicly declaring his love on Oprah Winfrey's television show, emphatically jumping on her couch. The couple has a 6-year-old daughter, Suri.

The plan to divorce was first reported by People magazine.

Cruise, currently starring in "Rock of Ages," was previously married to Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman, with whom he has two children.
