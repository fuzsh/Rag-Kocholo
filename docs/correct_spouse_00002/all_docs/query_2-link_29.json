        "text": "Effects of Nonmigrating Diurnal Tides on the Na Layer in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere\n\nJianfei Wu, Wuhu Feng, Xianghui Xue, Daniel R. Marsh, and John Maurice Campbell Plane\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1792,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1792, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMetal layers occur in the MLT region (80–120 km) from the ablation of cosmic dust. The nonmigrating diurnal tides are the persistent global oscillations. We investigate the nonmigrating diurnal tidal variations in the metal layers using satellite observations and global climate model simulations; this has not been studied previously due to the limitations of measurements. We show that the nonmigrating diurnal tides in temperature are strongly linked to the corresponding change in metal layers.\n\nTechnical note: Towards atmospheric compound identification in chemical ionization mass spectrometry with machine learning\n\nFederica Bortolussi, Hilda SandstrÃ¶m, Fariba Partovi, Joona MikkilÃ¤, Patrick Rinke, and Matti Rissanen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1846,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1846, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) is widely used in atmospheric chemistry studies. We still have a limited understanding of the complex functioning of the instrument, therefore, we applied machine learning to provide insights from CIMS analyses. We were able to predict both detection and signal intensity with a fair error and we found out the most important structural fragments for negative ionization schemes (NH and OH) and positive ones (nitrogen-containing groups).\n\nHemispheric asymmetry in recent stratospheric age of air changes\n\nKimberlee Dube, Susann Tegtmeier, Felix Ploeger, and Kaley A. Walker\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1736,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1736, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe transport rate of air in the stratosphere has changed in response to human emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances. This transport rate can be approximated using measurements of long-lived traces gases. We use observations and model results to derive anomalies and trends in the mean rate of stratospheric air transport. We find that air in the northern hemisphere aged by up to 0.3 years/decade relative to air in the southern hemisphere over 2004–2017.\n\nTurbulent Energy Budget Analysis Based on Coherent Wind Lidar Observations\n\nJinhong Xian, Zongxu Qiu, Hongyan Luo, Yuanyuan Hu, Xiaoling Lin, Chao Lu, Yan Yang, Honglong Yang, and Ning Zhang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2163,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2163, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe existing methods for observing turbulent kinetic energy budget term can only rely on ground-based tower. We have developed a new detection method that can directly observe and analyze the generation and dissipation mechanisms of turbulent energy at different heights in the vertical direction of the boundary layer. This research result will extend our study of turbulent kinetic energy budget terms from near ground to high altitude, providing a higher and more detailed perspective.\n\nHeterogeneous formation and light absorption of secondary organic aerosols from acetone photooxidation: Remarkably enhancing effects of seeds and ammonia\n\nSi Zhang, Xinbei Xu, Luyao Chen, Can Wu, Zheng Li, Rongjie Li, Binyu Xiao, Xiaodi Liu, Rui Li, Fan Zhang, and Gehui Wang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2119,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2119, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSOA from acetone photooxidation can be formed more readily on neutral aerosols than on acidic aerosols, while heterogeneous reaction of carbonyl with ammonium is only active on acidic aerosols in the presence of NH3, which produces light-absorbing N-containing compounds. Our work suggested that the heterogeneous oxidation of highly volatile VOC, for example acetone, is an importance source of SOA in the atmosphere, which should be accounted for in the future model studies.\n\nHigh-resolution large-eddy simulation to understand ozone formation and atmospheric oxidation capacity in Houston, Texas\n\nAkinleye Folorunsho, Jimy Dudhia, John Sullivan, Paul Walter, James Flynn, Travis Griggs, Rebecca Sheesley, Sascha Usenko, Guillaume Gronoff, Mark Estes, and Yang Li\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1190,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1190, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study investigates the factors driving high ozone levels over the Houston urban area. Using advanced modeling techniques and real-world measurements, we found vehicle and industrial emissions especially of highly reactive organic compounds play a key role in ozone formation. Our study highlights spatial and temporal changes in ozone sensitivity and variability of atmosphere's self-cleaning capacity to emissions, signifying effective ways of controlling emissions to mitigate urban ozone.\n\nChanges in Aerosol/Gas-Phase Distribution Ratio of Semi-Volatile Products Affect Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation with NOx from α-Pinene Photooxidation\n\nShijie Liu, Xinbei Xu, Si Zhang, Rongjie Li, Zheng Li, Can Wu, Rui Li, Guiqin Zhang, and Gehui Wang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1599,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1599, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted α-pinene photooxidation experiments in an atmospheric chamber at different NOx concentrations. The increased distribution coefficient of the oxidation products between the aerosol and gas phases with NOx was responsible for the increased SOA yields with NOx under low-NOx conditions. We also found the fraction of SOA made up of nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) increased with NOx.\n\nQuantifying the impact of global nitrate aerosol on tropospheric composition fields and its production from lightning NOx\n\nAshok K. Luhar, Anthony C. Jones, and Jonathan M. Wilkinson\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1363,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1363, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrate aerosol is often omitted in global chemistry-climate models due to the chemical complexity of its formation process. Using a global model, we demonstrate that including nitrate aerosol significantly impacts tropospheric composition fields, such as ozone, and radiation. Additionally, lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen influence both nitrate aerosol mass concentrations and aerosol size distribution, which has important implications for radiative fluxes and indirect aerosol effects.\n\nContrasting the roles of regional anthropogenic aerosols from the western and eastern Hemispheres in driving the 1980–2020 Pacific multi-decadal variations\n\nChenrui Diao, Yangyang Xu, Aixue Hu, and Zhili Wang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1920,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1920, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe increase of industrial aerosols in Asia and reductions in North America & Europe during 1980–2020 influenced the climate changes over the Pacific Ocean differently. Asian aerosols caused El Niño-like temperature pattern and slightly weakened the natural variation in North Pacific, while reduced western countries’ emissions led to extensive warming in mid-to-high latitudes of North Pacific. Human impacts on the Pacific climate may change when emission reduction occur over Asia in the future.\n\nThe impact of uncertainty in black carbon's refractive index on simulated optical depth and radiative forcing\n\nRuth A. R. Digby, Knut von Salzen, Adam H. Monahan, Nathan P. Gillett, and Jiangnan Li\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1796,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1796, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe refractive index of black carbon (BCRI), which determines how much energy black carbon absorbs and scatters, is difficult to measure and different climate models use different values. We show that varying the BCRI across commonly used values can increase absorbing aerosol optical depth by 42 % and the warming effect from interactions between black carbon and radiation by 47 %, an appreciable fraction of the overall spread between models reported in recent literature assessments.\n\nMeasurement Report: An investigation of the spatiotemporal variability of aerosol in the mountainous terrain of the Upper Colorado River Basin from SAIL-Net\n\nLeah D. Gibson, Ezra J. T. Levin, Ethan Emerson, Nick Good, Anna Hodshire, Gavin McMeeking, Kate Patterson, Bryan Rainwater, Tom Ramin, and Ben Swanson\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1780,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1780, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFrom Fall 2021 to Summer 2023, SAIL-Net, a network of six aerosol measurement nodes, was stationed in the East River Watershed in CO, USA to study the variability of aerosol in mountainous terrain. We found that aerosol variability was related to elevation differences and the variability changed seasonally. This suggests that model accuracy could be inconsistent over different seasons in complex terrain. This work provides a blueprint for future studies in other mountainous regions.\n\nFull-scale spectra of 15-year time series of near-surface horizontal wind speed on the north slope of Mt. Everest\n\nCunbo Han, Yaoming Ma, Weiqiang Ma, Fanglin Sun, Yunshuai Zhang, Wei Hu, Hanying Xu, Chunhui Duan, and Zhenhua Xi\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1963,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1963, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWind speed spectra analysis is very important for understanding boundary layer turbulence characteristics, atmospheric numerical model development, and wind energy assessment. However, wind speed spectra studies in mountainous areas are extremely scarce. In this study, using a 15-year time series of wind speed observed by a PBL tower and eddy-covariance tower at a site on the north slope of Mt. Everest, we investigated the characteristics of wind speed and wind speed spectrum.\n\nDistinctive dust weather intensities in North China resulted from two types of atmospheric circulation anomalies\n\nQianyi Huo, Zhicong Yin, Xiaoqing Ma, and Huijun Wang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1923,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1923, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Mongolian cyclone, compared to the cold high-pressure system, caused more frequent and severe dust weather in North China during the spring seasons of 2015–2023. Different intensities of 500 hPa cyclonic and anticyclonic anomalies, control near-surface meteorological conditions, leading to two dust weather types in North China. The common predictor for the two types of dust weather successfully captured 76.1 % of dust days and provided a dust signal two days in advance.\n\nValley floor inclination affecting valley winds and transport of passive tracers in idealised simulations\n\nJohannes Mikkola, Alexander Gohm, Victoria A. Sinclair, and Federico Bianchi\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1900,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1900, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the influence of valley floor inclination on diurnal winds and passive tracer transport within idealised mountain valleys using numerical simulations. The valley inclination strengthens the daytime up-valley winds but only up to a certain point. Beyond that critical angle, the winds weaken again. The inclined valleys transport the tracers higher up in the free troposphere which would for example lead to higher potential for long-range transport.\n\nAn Investigation of the Impact of Canadian wildfires on US Air Quality using Satellite, Model and Ground Measurements\n\nZhixin Xue, Nair Udaysankar, and Sundar Christopher\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1781,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1781, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCanadian wildfires degrade US air quality through long-range smoke transport. This study uses surface, satellite, and numerical models to assess the PM2.5 increase due to Canadian fires during 2018 fire season. Satellite data, often limited by cloud cover, was supplemented with high-resolution simulated data to fill gaps. Weather systems significantly influenced smoke movement. Canadian fires led to a notable rise in PM2.5 levels across various US regions during the 2018 summer wildfire events.\n\nCombined CO2 measurement record indicates decreased Amazon forest carbon uptake, offset by Savannah carbon release\n\nSantiago BotÃ­a, Saqr Munassar, Thomas Koch, Danilo Custodio, Luana S. Basso, Shujiro Komiya, Jost V. Lavric, David Walter, Manuel Gloor, Giordane Martins, Stijn Naus, Gerbrand Koren, Ingrid Luijkx, Stijn Hantson, John B. Miller, Wouter Peters, Christian RÃ¶denbeck, and Christoph Gerbig\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1735,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1735, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses CO2 data from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory and airborne profiles to estimate net carbon exchange. We found that the biogeographic Amazon is a net carbon sink, while the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes are net carbon sources, resulting in an overall neutral balance. To further reduce the uncertainty in our estimates we call for an expansion of the monitoring capacity, especially in the Amazon-Andes foothills.\n\nUrban ozone formation and sensitivities to volatile chemical products, cooking emissions, and NOx across the Los Angeles Basin\n\nChelsea E. Stockwell, Matthew M. Coggon, Rebecca H. Schwantes, Colin Harkins, Bert Verreyken, Congmeng Lyu, Qindan Zhu, Lu Xu, Jessica B. Gilman, Aaron Lamplugh, Jeff Peischl, Michael A. Robinson, Patrick R. Veres, Meng Li, Andrew W. Rollins, Kristen Zuraski, Sunil Baidar, Shang Liu, Toshihiro Kuwayama, Steven S. Brown, Brian C. McDonald, and Carsten Warneke\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1899,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1899, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn urban areas, emissions from everyday products like paints, cleaners, and personal care products, along with non-traditional sources such as cooking are important sources that impact air quality. This study used a model to evaluate how these emissions impact ozone in the Los Angeles Basin, and quantifies the impact of gaseous cooking emissions for the first time. Accurate representation of these and other man-made sources in inventories is crucial to inform effective air quality policies.\n\nMachine learning for improvement of upper tropospheric relative humidity in ERA5 weather model data\n\nZiming Wang, Luca Bugliaro, Klaus Gierens, Michaela I. Hegglin, Susanne Rohs, Andreas Petzold, Stefan Kaufmann, and Christiane Voigt\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2012,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2012, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUpper tropospheric relative humidity bias in the ERA5 weather model is corrected by 9 % by an artificial neural network using aircraft in-service humidity data and thermodynamic and dynamical variables. The improved skills of the weather model will advance cirrus research, weather forecast and measures for contrail reduction.\n\nCloud processing of DMS oxidation products limits SO2 and OCS production in the Eastern North Atlantic marine boundary layer\n\nDelaney B. Kilgour, Christopher M. Jernigan, Olga Garmash, Sneha Aggarwal, Claudia Mohr, Matt E. Salter, Joel A. Thornton, Jian Wang, Paul Zieger, and Timothy H. Bertram\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1975,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1975, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report simultaneous measurements of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and hydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF) in the Eastern North Atlantic. We use an observationally constrained box model to show cloud loss is the dominant sink of HPMTF in this region over six weeks, resulting in large reductions in DMS-derived products that contribute to aerosol formation and growth. Our findings indicate that fast cloud processing of HPMTF must be included in global models to accurately capture the sulfur cycle.\n\nLand use change influence on atmospheric organic gases, aerosols, and radiative effects\n\nRyan Vella, Matthew Forrest, Andrea Pozzer, Alexandra P. Tsimpidi, Thomas Hickler, Jos Lelieveld, and Holger Tost\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2014, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examines how land cover changes influence biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions and atmospheric states. Using a coupled chemistry-climate/vegetation model, we compare present-day land cover (deforested for crops and grazing) with natural vegetation, and an extreme reforestation scenario. We find that vegetation changes significantly impact global BVOC emissions and organic aerosols but have a relatively small effect on total aerosols, clouds, and radiative effects.\n\nMeasurement report: Sources and meteorology influencing highly-time resolved PM2.5 trace elements at 3 urban sites in extremely polluted Indo Gangetic Plain in India\n\nAshutosh Kumar Shukla, Sachchida Nand Tripathi, Shamitaksha Talukdar, Vishnu Murari, Sreenivas Gaddamidi, Manousos-Ioannis Manousakas, Vipul Lalchandani, Kuldeep Dixit, Vinayak M Ruge, Peeyush Khare, Mayank Kumar, Vikram Singh, Neeraj Rastogi, Suresh Tiwari, Atul K.

We found significant increases in Cl-rich and SFC1 sources, indicating dynamic emissions and agricultural burning impacts. Surges in Cl-rich particles during cold periods highlight their role in particle growth under specific conditions.\n\nTechnical note: Quantified organic aerosol subsaturated hygroscopicity by a simple optical scatter monitor system through field measurements\n\nJie Zhang, Tianyu Zhu, Alexandra Catena, Yaowei Li, Margaret Schwab, Pengfei Liu, Akua Asa-Awuku, and James Schwab\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1390,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1390, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study shows the derived organic aerosol hygroscopicity under high humidity conditions based on a simple optical scatter monitor system, including two nephelometric monitors (pDR-1500), after knowing the aerosol chemical composition.\n\nModel analysis of biases in satellite diagnosed aerosol effect on cloud liquid water path\n\nHarri Kokkola, Juha Tonttila, Silvia CalderÃ³n, Sami Romakkaniemi, Antti Lipponen, Aapo PerÃ¤korpi, Tero Mielonen, Edward Gryspeerdt, Timo H. Virtanen, Pekka Kolmonen, and Antti Arola\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1964,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1964, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding how atmospheric aerosols affect clouds is a scientific challenge. One question is how aerosols affects the amount cloud water. We used a cloud-scale model to study these effects on marine clouds. The study showed that variations in cloud properties and instrument noise can cause bias in satellite derived cloud water content. However, our results suggest that for similar weather conditions with well-defined aerosol concentrations, satellite data can reliably track these effects.\n\nMeasurement Report: The effects of SECA regulations on the atmospheric SO2 concentrations in the Baltic Sea, based on long-term observations at the Finnish Utö Island\n\nAndroniki Maragkidou, Tiia GrÃ¶nholm, Laura Rautiainen, Juha Nikmo, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Timo MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Timo Anttila, Lauri Laakso, and Jaakko Kukkonen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1703,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1703, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Baltic Sea's designation as a Sulphur Emission Control Area in 2006, with subsequent regulations, significantly reduced sulphur emissions from shipping. Our study analyzed air quality data from 2003 to 2020 at Utö island and employed modelling, showing a continuous decrease in SO2 concentrations since 2003 and evidencing, thus, the effectiveness of such regulations in improving air quality. It also underscored the importance of long-term, high-resolution monitoring at remote marine sites.\n\nWeak surface temperature effects of recent reductions in shipping SO2 emissions, with quantification confounded by internal variability\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Laura J.

Lund, Daniel McCoy, Daniel Westervelt, Andrew Williams, and BjÃ¸rn H. Samset\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1946,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1946, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2020, regulations by the International Maritime Organization aimed to reduce aerosol emissions from ships. These aerosols previously had a cooling effect, which the regulations might reduce, revealing more greenhouse gas warming. Here we find that while there is regional warming, the global 2020–2040 temperature rise is only +0.03°C. This small change is difficult to distinguish from natural climate variability, indicating the regulations have had a limited effect on observed warming to date.\n\nMomentum flux characteristics of vertical propagating Gravity Waves\n\nProsper K. Nyassor, Cristiano M. Wrasse, Igo Paulino, Cosme A. O. B. Figueiredo, Ricardo A. Buriti, Hisao Takahashi, Delano Gobbi, and Gabriel A. Giongo\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1982,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1982, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work studies the dynamics of momentum and energy of upward and downward GW. From photometer, the vertical component of GWs were observed and horizontal component from an all-sky imager. Using these parameters from these two instruments and wind from meteor radar, the momentum flux and energy of the waves were determined and studied. It was observed that the dynamics of the downward GWs is opposite to that of the upward GWs.\n\nUsing a region-specific ice-nucleating particle parameterization improves the representation of Arctic clouds in a global climate model\n\nAstrid Bragstad Gjelsvik, Robert Oscar David, Tim Carlsen, Franziska Hellmuth, Stefan Hofer, Zachary McGraw, Harald Sodemann, and Trude Storelvmo\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1879,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1879, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce formation in clouds has a substantial impact on radiation and precipitation, and must be realistically simulated in order to understand present and future Arctic climate. Rare aerosols known as ice-nucleating particles can play an important role for cloud ice formation, but their representation in global climate models is not well suited for the Arctic. In this study, the simulation of cloud phase is improved when the representation of these particles are constrained by Arctic observations.\n\nThe 2023 global warming spike was driven by El Niño/Southern Oscillation\n\nShiv Priyam Raghuraman, Brian Soden, Amy Clement, Gabriel Vecchi, Sofia Menemenlis, and Wenchang Yang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1937,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1937, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe rapid global warming of 2023 has led to concerns that it could be externally driven. Models subject only to internal variability rarely predict such warming spikes (p~3 %). However, when a prolonged La Niña immediately precedes an El Niño, as occurred leading up to 2023, such spikes are not uncommon (p~17 %).

The natural ozone variability complicates detection of small trends. This study optimizes statistical model fit in the observational records by adding parameters that interpret seasonal and long-term changes in atmospheric circulation and airmass mixing which reduces uncertainties in detection of the stratospheric ozone recovery.\n\nAustralian Bushfire Emissions Result in Enhanced Polar Stratospheric Ice Clouds\n\nSrinivasan Prasanth, Narayana Sarma Anand, Kudilil Sunilkumar, Subin Jose, Kenath Arun, Sreedharan K.

During Austral winter 2020, 82% of liquid nitric acid trihydrate (LNAT) PSC nucleated on bushfire aerosols, and 77% of ice PSC formed on these LNAT. This rapid conversion mechanism of LNAT to ice resulted in high anomalous ice PSC. This study sheds light on interactions between bushfire aerosols, and PSC microphysics which has significant global climate implications.\n\nDynamical imprints on precipitation cluster statistics across a hierarchy of high-resolution simulations\n\nClaudia Christine Stephan and Bjorn Stevens\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2020, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTropical precipitation cluster area and intensity distributions follow power laws, but the physical processes responsible for this behavior remain unknown. We analyze global simulations that realistically represent precipitation processes. We consider Earth-like planets as well as virtual planets to realize different types of large-scale dynamics. Our finding is that power laws in Earth’s precipitation cluster statistics stem from the robust power laws in Earth’s atmospheric wind field.\n\nThe role of interfacial tension in the size-dependent phase separation of atmospheric aerosol particles\n\nRyan Schmedding and Andreas Zuend\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1690,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1690, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFour different approaches for computing the interfacial tension between liquid phases in aerosol particles were tested for particles with diameters from 10 nm to more than 5 μm. Antonov's rule led to the strongest reductions in the onset relative humidity of liquid–liquid phase separation and reproduced measured interfacial tensions for highly immiscible systems. A modified form of the Butler equation was able to best reproduce measured interfacial tensions in more miscible systems.\n\nImpact of wildfire smoke on Arctic cirrus formation, part 2: simulation of MOSAiC 2019−2020 cases\n\nAlbert Ansmann, Cristofer Jimenez, Daniel A.

Elbrus in the Caucasus, Russia. Changes in ammonia emissions in southeastern Europe during the pre-industrial and industrial periods were investigated. The level of ammonium in 1750 indicates a significant contribution of natural sources to the ammonia budget, contrasting with present-day conditions, where agricultural emissions outweigh those from biogenic sources in Europe.\n\nHow atmospheric CO2 can inform us on annual and decadal shifts in the biospheric carbon uptake period\n\nTheertha Kariyathan, Ana Bastos, Markus Reichstein, Wouter Peters, and Julia Marshall\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1382,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1382, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe carbon uptake period (CUP) refers to the time of the year when there is net absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere to the land. Several studies have assessed changes in CUP based on seasonal metrics from CO2 mole fraction measurements to understand the response of terrestrial biosphere to climate variations. However, we find that the CUP derived from CO2 mole fraction measurements are not likely to provide an accurate magnitude of the actual changes occurring over the surface.\n\nTerrestrial runoff is an important source of biological INPs in Arctic marine systems\n\nCorina Wieber, Lasse Z.

Ice nucleating particles (INPs) in the seawater can get transported to the atmosphere and impact cloud formation. However, the sources of characteristics of INPs in the marine areas are poorly understood. We investigated the INPs in seawater from Greenlandic fjords and identified a seasonal variability and highly active INPs originating from terrestrial sources.\n\nQuantifying the Impacts of Marine Aerosols over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean using a chemical transport model: Implications for aerosol-cloud interactions\n\nMashiat Hossain, Rebecca M.

Using the GEOS-Chem model, we find that at cloud altitudes, organic aerosols dominate during the biomass burning season, while sulfate aerosols, driven by marine emissions, prevail during peak primary production. These findings highlight the need for accurate representation of marine aerosols in models to improve climate predictions and reduce uncertainties.\n\nMeasurement report: TURBAN observation campaign combining street-level low-cost air quality sensors and meteorological profile measurements in Prague\n\nPetra BauerovÃ¡, Josef Keder, Adriana Å indelÃ¡ÅovÃ¡, OndÅej VlÄek, William PatiÃ±o, Jaroslav Resler, Pavel KrÄ, Jan GeletiÄ, Hynek ÅeznÃ­Äek, Martin BureÅ¡, KryÅ¡tof Eben, Michal Belda, Jelena RadoviÄ, VladimÃ­r Fuka, Radek JareÅ¡, and Igor Ezau\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1222,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1222, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe implemented an observation campaign focused on street-level air quality and vertical meteorological profile measurement in Prague using low-cost sensors and remote sensing devices.

A high level of NO2 pollution was confirmed due to the traffic load in streets, peaks of aerosol pollution appeared more under inversion conditions. The data will be further used for PALM model validation.\n\nDisentangling the chemistry and transport impacts of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation on stratospheric ozone\n\nJinbo Xie, Qi Tang, Michael Prather, Jadwiga Richter, and Shixuan Zhang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1927,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1927, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnalysis of the interaction between the climate and ozone in the stratosphere is complicated by the in-ability climate model in simulating the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) – an important climate mode in the stratosphere. We use a set of model simulation that realistically simulate QBO and a novel ozone diagnostic tool to separate the temperature and circulation-driven QBO impact. These are important for diagnosing model-model differences in the QBO-ozone responses for climate projections.\n\nThe optical properties of stratospheric aerosol layer perturbation of the Hunga volcano eruption of January 15th, 2022\n\nPasquale Sellitto, Redha Belhadji, Bernard Legras, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, and Clair Duchamp\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1433,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1433, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Hunga volcano erupted on 15/01/22, producing the largest stratospheric aerosol perturbation of the last 30 years. Stratospheric volcanic aerosols usually produce a transient climate cooling; these impacts depend on volcanic aerosol composition/size, due to size-dependent interactions with solar/terrestrial radiation. We demonstrate that the Hunga stratospheric aerosol have a larger cooling potential per unit mass than the past climate-relevant El Chichon (1984) and Pinatubo (1991) eruptions.\n\nImpact of mineral dust on the global nitrate aerosol direct and indirect radiative effect\n\nAlexandros Milousis, Klaus KlingmÃ¼ller, Alexandra P.

Here, a random forest approach was used to eliminate the effects of meteorological factors (dispersion or transport) on O3 and its precursors. Variations in the sensitivity of O3 formation and the apportionment of emission sources were revealed after meteorological normalization. Our results suggest that meteorological variations should be considered when diagnosing O3 formation.\n\nObservations of high time-resolution and size-resolved aerosol chemical composition and microphyscis in the central Arctic: implications for climate-relevant particle properties\n\nBenjamin Heutte, Nora Bergner, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Angot, Jakob B.

This study compares and harmonizes two newly developed global datasets of aerosol concentrations, offering valuable insights for their future use and refinement.\n\nGravity waves as a mechanism of troposphere–stratosphere–mesosphere coupling during sudden stratospheric warming\n\nGordana Jovanovic\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1856,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1856, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is a phenomenon when the temperature in the stratosphere rises by about 50 K in just a few days. SSWs are caused by the breaking of atmospheric waves that propagate from the troposphere via the stratosphere to the mesosphere. SSWs impact the tropospheric circulation and the climate and and can lead to a dramatic decrease in temperature. During SSW events, the filtration of gravity waves has a major impact on mesospheric cooling.\n\nCharacterization of biogenic volatile organic compounds and their oxidation products at a stressed pine forest close to a biogas power plant\n\nJunwei Song, Georgios I.

Higher temperatures can enhance the forest emissions of biogenic VOCs exceeding their photochemical consumption during daytime. Weakly oxidized monoterpene products dominated the VOCs during nighttime. Moreover, increasing relative humidity can promote the gas-to-particle partitioning of these weakly oxidized monoterpene products, leading to increased OA mass.\n\nImpact of host climate model on contrail cirrus effective radiative forcing estimates\n\nWeiyu Zhang, Kwinten Van Weverberg, Cyril J.

We evaluate for the first time the impact of the host climate model on contrail cirrus properties. Substantial differences exist between contrail cirrus formation, persistence, and radiative effects in the host climate models. Reliable contrail cirrus simulations require advanced representation of cloud optical properties and microphysics, which should be better constrained by observations.\n\nMeasurement report: Aerosol vertical profiling over the Southern Great Barrier Reef using lidar and MAX-DOAS measurements\n\nRobert G.

Using molecular spectroscopic methods, we demonstrated that the aqueous replacement reaction, unique to these mixed aerosols and promoted by the presence of ammonium, significantly alters their phase behavior. This effect complicates the prediction of aerosol phase states and the corresponding atmospheric processes.\n\nSatellite quantification of methane emissions from South American countries: A high-resolution inversion of TROPOMI and GOSAT observations\n\nSarah E.

We find a 55 % upward correction to the national anthropogenic inventories reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under the Paris Agreement. Our estimates match inventories for Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay but are much higher for other countries. Livestock emissions (65 % of anthropogenic emissions) show the largest discrepancies.\n\nSurface Observation Constrained High Frequency Coal Mine Methane Emissions in Shanxi China Reveal More Emissions than Inventories, Consistency with Satellite Inversion\n\nFan Lu, Kai Qin, Jason Blake Cohen, Qin He, Pravash Tiwari, Wei Hu, Chang Ye, Yanan Shan, Qing Xu, Shuo Wang, and Qiansi Tu\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1784,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1784, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work describes a field campaign and new fast emissions estimation approach to attribute methane from a large known and previously unknown coal mine in Shanxi China. The emissions computed are shown to be larger than known oil and gas sources, indicating that methane from coal mines may play a larger role in the global methane budget. The results are found to be slightly larger than or similar to satellite observational campaigns over the same region.\n\nModeling study of the snow darkening effect by black carbon deposition over the Arctic during the melting period\n\nZilu Zhang, Libo Zhou, and Meigen Zhang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1717,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1717, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy integrating the SNICAR model with Polar-WRF we find that 50 ng g-1 black carbon (BC) deposition decreases snow albedo, increasing radiative forcing (RF) by 1–4 W m-2, especially in Greenland, Baffin Island, and East Siberia. The impact is strongly linked to BC mass, with deep snowpacks showing greater sensitivity. Snow melt and landâatmosphere interactions are crucial. High-resolution modeling is necessary to better understand these effects on Arctic climate change.\n\nMeasurement Report: Long-term Assessment of Primary and Secondary Organic Aerosols in Shanghai Megacity throughout China’s Clean Air Actions since 2010\n\nHaifeng Yu, Yunhua Chang, Lin Cheng, Yusen Duan, and Jianlin Hu\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1488,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1488, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents long-term measurements and comprehensive analysis of carbonaceous aerosols in PM2.5 in Shanghai.

This ability is controlled by the number of cloud droplets, which is governed by the number of aerosol particles in the atmosphere, laying out the foundation for so-called aerosol-cloud-climate interactions. In this study, a simple model to understand the effect of aerosol on cloud water is developed and applied.\n\nAERO-MAP: A data compilation and modelling approach to understand spatial variability in fine and coarse mode aerosol composition\n\nNatalie M.

We evaluate these estimates using carbon monoxide concentrations measured using a satellite. We find generally good agreement between our values and those reported but also identify some uncertainties, showing that satellites can provide insights on these emissions.\n\nRepresentation of iron aerosol size distributions is critical in evaluating atmospheric soluble iron input to the ocean\n\nMingxu Liu, Hitoshi Matsui, Douglas Hamilton, Sagar Rathod, Kara Lamb, and Natalie Mahowald\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1454,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1454, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric aerosol deposition provides iron to promote marine primary production, yet its amount remains highly uncertain.

This study seeks to understand the factors driving these models by comparing long-term datasets of biogenic compounds to modeled emissions. We note that the light-dependent fractions currently used in models do not accurately represent regional observations. We provide evidence for the time-dependent variation of this parameter for future modifications to models.\n\nRadiative impact of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai stratospheric volcanic plume: role of aerosols and water vapor in the southern tropical Indian Ocean\n\nMichael Sicard, Alexandre Baron, Marion Ranaivombola, Dominique Gantois, Tristan Millet, Pasquale Sellitto, Nelson BÃ¨gue, Hassan Bencherif, Guillaume Payen, Nicolas Marquestaut, and Valentin Duflot\n\nExternal preprint server, https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170231679.99186200/v1,https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170231679.99186200/v1, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study quantifies the radiative impact over Reunion Island (21° S, 55° E) of the aerosols and water vapor injected in the stratosphere by the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano in the South Pacific.

We conclude that in addition to ice nucleation by sea spray and mineral components of soil dust we also need to represent ice nucleation by the organic components of soils.\n\nImpact of Arctic Amplification variability on the chemical composition of the snowpack in Svalbard\n\nAzzurra Spagnesi, Elena Barbaro, Matteo Feltracco, Federico Scoto, Marco Vecchiato, Massimiliano VardÃ¨, Mauro Mazzola, FranÃ§ois Yves Burgay, Federica Bruschi, Clara Jule Marie Hoppe, Allison Bailey, Andrea Gambaro, Carlo Barbante, and Andrea Spolaor\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1393,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1393, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSvalbard is a relevant area to evaluate changes in local environmental processes induced by Arctic Amplification (AA).

Our research indicates that burning conditions, aerosol transport pathways, and prolonged oxidation processes, both heterogeneous and aqueous-phase determine the chemical, microphysical, and optical properties of the boundary layer aerosol. Notably, we find that the aerosol optical properties can be estimated from the chemical properties alone.\n\nProtection without poison: Why tropical ozone maximizes in the interior of the atmosphere\n\nAaron Match, Edwin P.

Paradoxically, neither paradigm explains the observed ozone peak, motivating a new theory: peak ozone occurs precisely at the transition between these regimes. An idealized analytical ozone profile is derived, helping to interpret sensitivities to UV perturbations.\n\nThe impact of QBO disruptions on diurnal tides over the low- and mid-latitude MLT region observed by a meteor radar chain\n\nJianyuan Wang, Na Li, Wen Yi, Xianghui Xue, Iain Reid, Jianfei Wu, Hailun Ye, Jian Li, Zonghua Ding, Jinsong Chen, Guozhu Li, Yaoyu Tian, Boyuan Chang, Jiajing Wu, and Lei Zhao\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1662,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1662, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe mesospheric diurnal tides over low- and mid-latitude region are suppressed during the QBO disruptions and QBO westward wind phase, and are enhanced during QBO eastward wind phase, observed by a meteor radar chain. By using SD-WACCM-X simulations and ERA5 reanalysis, it is found that the stratospheric QBO winds affect the mesospheric diurnal tides by modulating the subtropical ozone variability in the upper stratosphere and the interaction between tides and gravity waves in the mesosphere.\n\nTropospheric Links to Uncertainty in Stratospheric Subseasonal Predictions\n\nRachel W.-Y. Wu, Gabriel Chiodo, Inna Polichtchouk, and Daniela I. V. Domeisen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1652,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1652, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: final response, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStrong variations in the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex can profoundly affect surface weather extremes, therefore, accurately predicting the stratosphere can improve surface weather forecasts. The research reveals how uncertainty in the stratosphere is linked to the troposphere. The findings suggest that refining models to better represent the identified sources and impact regions in the troposphere is likely to improve the prediction of the stratosphere and its surface impacts.\n\nExploring the Crucial Role of Atmospheric Carbonyl Compounds in Regional Ozone heavy Pollution: Insights from Intensive Field Observations and Observation-based modelling in the Chengdu Plain Urban Agglomeration, China\n\nJiemeng Bao, Xin Zhang, Zhenhai Wu, Li Zhou, Jun Qian, Qinwen Tan, Fumo Yang, Junhui Chen, Yunfeng Li, Hefan Liu, Liqun Deng, and Hong Li\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1204,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1204, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur research in the Chengdu Plain Urban Agglomeration (CPUA), China, reveals significant correlations between carbonyl compounds and ozone pollution, particularly in Chengdu. Formaldehyde, acetone, and acetaldehyde are key contributors to ozone formation. Urgent collaborative actions among cities are needed to mitigate carbonyl-related ozone pollution, stressing the control of NOx and VOCs emissions. Our study offers crucial insights for crafting effective regional pollution control strategies.\n\nOpinion: Why all emergent constraints are wrong but some are useful – a machine learning perspective\n\nPeer Nowack and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1636,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1636, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our Opinion article, we review uncertainties in global climate change projections and current methods using Earth observations to constrain them, which is crucial for climate risk assessments and for informing society. We then discuss how machine learning can advance the field, discussing recent work that provides potentially stronger and more robust links between observed data and future climate projections. We further discuss challenges of applying machine learning to climate science.\n\nNon-sea-salt aerosols that contain trace bromine and iodine are widespread in the remote troposphere\n\nGregory P.

Diskin\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1399,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1399, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing single-particle mass spectrometry, we show that trace concentrations of bromine and iodine are ubiquitous in remote tropospheric aerosol, and suggest that aerosols are an important part of the global reactive iodine budget. Comparisons to a global climate model with detailed iodine chemistry are favorable in the background atmosphere; however, the model cannot replicate our measurements near the ocean surface, in biomass burning plumes, and in the stratosphere.\n\nA Multi-site Passive Approach for Studying the Emissions and Evolution of Smoke from Prescribed Fires\n\nRime El Asmar, Zongrun Li, David J. Tanner, Yongtao Hu, Susan OâNeill, L. Gregory Huey, M. Talat Odman, and Rodney J. Weber\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1485,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1485, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrescribed burning is an important method for managing ecosystems and preventing wildfires, however, smoke from prescribed fires can have a significant impact on air quality. Here, using a network of fixed sites and sampling throughout an extended prescribed burning period in two different years, we characterize the emissions and evolution up to 8 hours of PM2.5 mass, BC, and BrC in smoke from burning of forested lands in the southeastern US.\n\nImpacts of tropical cyclone-heatwave compound events on surface ozone in eastern China: Comparison between the Yangtze River and Pearl River Deltas\n\nCuini Qi, Pinya Wang, Yang Yang, Huimin Li, Hui Zhang, Lili Ren, Xipeng Jin, Chenchao Zhan, Jianping Tang, and Hong Liao\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-846,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-846, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate extreme hot weathers impacts on surface ozone over Southeastern Coast of China with (TC-HDs) and without (AHDs) tropical cyclones. Compared to AHDs, ozone concentration decreased notably in Yangtze River Delta (YRD) but increased in Pearl River Delta (PRD) during TC-HDs. YRD benefitted from strong, clean sea winds aiding ozone elimination. In contrast, PRD experienced strong northeasterly winds, potentially transporting ozone pollution.\n\nInvestigating processes influencing simulation of local Arctic wintertime anthropogenic pollution in Fairbanks, Alaska during ALPACA-2022\n\nNatalie Brett, Kathy S.

Modelled power plant plume rise that considers surface and elevated temperature inversions improves results compared to observations. Modelled near-surface concentrations are improved by representation of vertical mixing and emission estimates. Large increases in diesel vehicle emissions at temperatures reaching -35 °C are required to reproduce observed NOx.\n\nEstimation of seasonal methane fluxes over a Mediterranean rice paddy area using the Radon Tracer Method (RTM)\n\nRoger Curcoll, Josep-Anton MorguÃ­, Alba Ãgueda, LÃ­dia CaÃ±as, SÃ­lvia BorrÃ s, Arturo Vargas, and Claudia Grossi\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1370,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1370, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, the methane emissions from the rice crops of the Ebro Delta were estimated with the Radon Tracer Method, using backtrajectories and radon and methane observations. Estimated fluxes show a strong seasonality with maximums in October, corresponding with the period of harvest and straw incorporation. The estimated annual methane emission was about 262.8 kg CH4 haâ1. Results were compared with fluxes obtained with static chambers showing a stunning agreement between both methodologies.\n\nImpact of methane and other precursor emission reductions on surface ozone in Europe: Scenario analysis using the EMEP MSC-W model\n\nWillem Elias van Caspel, Zbigniew Klimont, Chris Heyes, and Hilde Fagerli\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1422,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1422, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMethane in the atmosphere contributes to the production of ozone gas, which is an air pollutant as well as a greenhouse gas. In this study, the impact of reducing methane emissions on surface ozone is investigated for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) region excluding North America and Israel (the \"EMEP region\"), in particular in terms of its importance in reaching the ozone exposure guideline limits set by the World Health Organization.\n\nMulti-year gradient measurements of sea spray fluxes over the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean\n\nPiotr Markuszewski, E.

Our research provides new insights into the study of sea spray emission in the Baltic Sea and North Atlantic. We investigated the impact of environmental factors on sea spray fluxes. We observed that in case of increased marine biological activity in the Baltic Sea, sea spray flux is suppressed. We also observed evidence of sea surface temperature influence on sea spray emission.\n\nBiomass Burning Emissions Analysis Based on MODIS AOD and AeroCom Multi-Model Simulations\n\nMariya Petrenko, Ralph Kahn, Mian Chin, Susanne E.

In regions where plumes are thick and background aerosol is low, models and satellites compare well. However, the input emission inventory tends to underestimate in many places, and particle property and loss-rate assumptions vary enormously among models, causing uncertainties that require systematic in-situ measurements to resolve.\n\nRemote Sensing detectability of airborne Arctic dust\n\nNorman T. OâNeill, Keyvan Ranjbar, Liviu IvÄnescu, Yann Blanchard, Seyed Ali Sayedain, and Yasmin AboEl-Fetouh\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1057,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1057, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDust from mid-latitude deserts or from local drainage basins is a weak component of atmospheric aerosols in the Arctic. Satellite-based dust estimates are often overestimated because dust and cloud measurements can be confused. Illustrations are given with an emphasis on the flawed claim that a classic indicator of dust (negative brightness temperature differences) is proof of the presence of airborne Arctic dust. Low altitude “warm” water plumes are the likely source of such negative values.\n\nTechnical note: Theoretical and experimental investigation of isotopic exchange between water vapour and droplets under isothermal saturation conditions\n\nWenwen Bai, Jiahua Wei, Sanchuan Ni, Zhanyu Yao, Yifeng Liu, Jingjing Ding, Kaiyu Wang, Nan Liu, Liner Wang, and Miao Wu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2024-4,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2024-4, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo explore influence of exchange process on vapour isotopes, IECEWV was derived based on mass conservation, indoor experiments were designed and conducted. The calculated isotopes in water vapour was consistent with experimental value, isotopes exchange can lead to the hydrogen and oxygen isotope line of vapour deviate from the origin, water vapour d-excess remains essentially constant. Combined IECEWV with the Rayleigh fractionation, vapour and precipitation isotope variation can be explored.\n\nLong-term (2010–2021) lidar observations of stratospheric aerosols at Wuhan, China\n\nYun He, Dongzhe Jing, Zhenping Yin, Kevin Ohneiser, and Fan Yi\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1611,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1611, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a long-term ground-based lidar observation of stratospheric aerosols at a mid-latitude site, Wuhan in central China, from 2010 to 2021. We observed a stratospheric background period from 2013 to mid-2017 along with several perturbations from volcanic aerosols and wildfire-induced smoke. In summer, injected stratospheric aerosols are found to be captured by the Asian monsoon anticyclone, resulting in prolonged residence and regional transport in the mid-latitude of East Asia.\n\nVertical profiles of global tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) obtained by cloud-slicing TROPOMI\n\nRebekah P. Horner, Eloise A. Marais, Nana Wei, Robert G. Ryan, and Viral Shah\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1541,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1541, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO2) affect tropospheric ozone and the hydroxyl radical, influencing climate and atmospheric oxidation. To address the lack of routine observations of NOx, we cloud-slice satellite observations of NO2 to derive a new dataset of global vertical profiles of NO2. We evaluate our data against in-situ aircraft observations and use our data to critique contemporary knowledge of tropospheric NOx as simulated with the GEOS-Chem model.\n\nViscosity of aqueous ammonium nitrate–organic particles: Equilibrium partitioning may be a reasonable assumption for most tropospheric conditions\n\nLiviana K.

Moreover, the corresponding estimated internal aerosol mixing times remain below an hour for most tropospheric conditions, making equilibrium partitioning a reasonable assumption.\n\nAssessment of the 11-year solar cycle signals in the middle atmosphere in multiple-model ensemble simulations\n\nWenjuan Huo, Tobias Spiegl, Sebastian Wahl, Katja Matthes, Ulrike Langematz, Holger Pohlmann, and JÃ¼rgen KrÃ¶ger\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1288,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1288, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ACP (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUncertainties of the solar signals in the middle atmosphere are assessed based on large ensemble simulations with multiple climate models. Our results demonstrate the 11-year solar signals in the short wave heating rate, temperature, and ozone anomalies are significant and robust. the simulated dynamical responses are model-dependent, and solar imprints in the polar night jet are influenced by biases in the model used.\n\nConstraining"
