        "text": "Man, Cruise's career and filmography is so.....interesting.\n\nBasically from 1980 til around 2005 he appears to try to work with all the giants of the industry (Francis Ford Coppola, Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, Martin Scorsese, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Rob Reiner, Sydney Pollack, Brian De Palma, Cameron Crowe, Stanley Kubrick, Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Spielberg, Michael Mann) in all manner of roles and genres.\n\nThen comes Oprah's couch, Katie Holmes and the fallout from that. Fair to say his star loses a fair bit of its shine. Then he has about a 5 year down period where he puts out lesser works like Lions for Lambs, Valkyrie, Day and Knight, Rock of Ages, etc. and is basically no longer an A lister.\n\nWhatever happens after this is what I'm super interested in, and we will likely never know. He turns away from working with the creme de la creme auteurs and instead forms tight ranks with a smaller group of filmmakers who, while talented, aren't the kind of calibre of people he used to work with. He teams with Christopher McQuarrie on 10 films. He completely stops doing any sort of character actor work or drama work and throws himself fully into the role of action movie star, making a new name for himself as the king of practical effects and stunts. Then basically from 2011 to 2018 he makes a bunch of mostly pretty darn good action and/or sci-fi action movies.\n\nThen 2022 and Maverick hit and its the biggest hit of his entire career and he once again appears to be one of the most powerful figures in all of show business (after refusing to let the movie go to streaming and becoming the bastion of the theatrical experience), and he is primed to flex hard with 2 gigantic MI movies coming the next 2 years.\n\nWhat a ride. What I'm really curious about is where does he go from MI 7 and 8. By the time 8 drops he will be 62, and although he's in phenomenal shape, he can't do this forever. I wonder if he makes a return to character acting and again starts teaming up with the creme de la creme?

Remember, he was in talks for Brad Pitt's Oscar winning role in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - I'd love to see him team up with someone like Tarantino in the twilight phase of his career.\n\nProbably went with his stable of writers and directors to maintain more control of his movies. Makes sense and certainly paid off.\n\nYeah I feel like maybe he hired a new publicist or talked to a marketing firm about rebuilding the whole Tom Cruise brand post-couch-jump. He never talks about Scientology any more, never mentions his personal life, never does personal interviews at all for that matter. You only see him in public when he's promoting a movie, and he just keeps it light and genial and focused on the movie. He reinvented himself as Mr Movies, Mr Does-His-Own-Stunts, the Western answer to Jackie Chan, and frankly it worked.\n\nHe's also obviously played the game to perfection behind the scenes, too. He's producing all these movies, too, and it isn't just an honorary title, it seems like he's actually calling the shots. That story about him hearing Kosinski's pitch for Top Gun Maverick and immediately picking up his phone, dialing the president of Paramount and saying \"We're doing it\" is incredible; what other actor has that kind of clout in today's Hollywood?\n\nI'm really excited to see where he goes once he ages out of the action hero roles, too. When he stops dyeing his hair, hops off the TRT, lets himself look like a regular handsome older guy rather than the impossible silver screen god who still has abs in his 60s and goes back to purely dramatic roles. He's always been a genuinely great actor, and I brought this up earlier in the thread but he's just the right age to assume the Paul Newman role in a third Hustler/Color of Money film.

The only question is who could play the young Tom Cruise role opposite him?\n\nHe has definitely surrounded himself with a shrewd team because as you note, he has essentially completely rebuilt his public image.\n\nOh yes he's definitely not a bullshit money train executive producer type, he is definitely involved in every single facet of his movies. I think that's probably why he likes working with Macquarrie and Kosinski so much- they are both professionals, both super dedicated, but aren't so high up the Hollywood ladder that they won't defer to Cruise on any matter he wishes. Kinda like have super talented yes man in your stable.\n\nAnd yeah, I wonder if he ever does give up the ghost and just age like the rest of us? Obviously he has access to the best trainers/dietitians/chefs/drugs. He was 55/56 in TGM and my god, he's almost never looked better. An absolute golden god.\n\nMan, Cruise's career and filmography is so.....interesting.\n\nBasically from 1980 til around 2005 he appears to try to work with all the giants of the industry (Francis Ford Coppola, Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, Martin Scorsese, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Rob Reiner, Sydney Pollack, Brian De Palma, Cameron Crowe, Stanley Kubrick, Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Spielberg, Michael Mann) in all manner of roles and genres.\n\nThen comes Oprah's couch, Katie Holmes and the fallout from that.

Remember, he was in talks for Brad Pitt's Oscar winning role in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - I'd love to see him team up with someone like Tarantino in the twilight phase of his career.\n\nYeah I mentioned recently that Cruise director collaboration resune was insane. He also worked with John Woo on MI2. Dont think any actor can top Cruise in this department.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick Star Miles Teller Has One Of The Greatest Tom Cruise Stories Ever - SlashFilm\n\nMiles Teller endured a lot getting ready to film his flight scenes in Top Gun: Maverick, but at least he has a great story to tell his kids.\n\n\"We landed and I'm just like, 'Man, I'm not feeling too good.' I was really hot and I just started itching like crazy. So I get out of the jet and I'm just covered in hives, like head to toe. Instantly, I go to a doctor, I do a blood analysis, this, that whatever\"\n\nTeller revealed that when his blood work finally came back, it revealed \"flame-retardant, pesticides, and jet fuel\" in his blood. Obviously, he had the sane response of \"oh my god\"\n\n\"So I go to set the next day and Tom [Cruise] is like, 'So how did it go, Miles? What did they find?' I was like, 'Well, Tom, it turns out I have jet fuel in my blood.' And without even skipping a beat, Tom just goes, 'Yeah, I was born with it kid.'\"\n\nWhat a legend.\n\nBack on the ground after round #4 with Mav. I took my Mum to see it this time and even she was white-knuckling it by the end. FOUR QUADRANT APPEAL. I simply can't believe how good this movie is. It's simply the GOAT. Name a better movie, I dare you. Can't be done. Citizen Kane? Paris, Texas? Vertigo? Step aside, losers, we're turning and burning. Dagger 2, up and ready. TALLY TWO, FIVE O'CLOCK LOW!\n\nSomething I noticed this time around was just how focused and purposeful the editing is. It feels like every shot and every cut is done for a specific reason. The initial speech that Warlock gives the team before introducing Maverick is a really simple scene, but a perfect example of telling a story and establishing characters through editing. IIRC it goes something like:\n\nWarlock: \"Success or failure will come down to the man or woman in the box...\"\n\n*cut to shot of Hangman looking smugly at Phoenix on 'woman', Phoenix flipping him the bird*\n\nWarlock: \"Half of you will be chosen for the mission. One of you will be designated team leader...\"\n\n*shot of Hangman flashing his shit-eating grin*\n\nWarlock: \"...the other half will be kept in reserve for any backup activities necessary\"\n\n*Hangman looks over his shoulder at Rooster on 'kept in reserve', Rooster looks away dejectedly*\n\nThat's the movies, baby! Even stuff like Hangman sitting at the front of the class because he's the golden boy, with Rooster sitting a few rows back because he's literally behind Hangman in terms of confidence, that's classic filmmaking bread and butter that is becoming less and less common because so many movies today are made by these directors who make one indie movie and then get headhunted by Kevin Feige to take on a billion-dollar IP without really learning the ropes.\n\n(btw I looked it up and Eddie Hamilton, the editor, also edited Mission Impossible Rogue Nation and Fallout, and he's doing both parts of Dead Reckoning, too, so we're gonna be eating well.)\n\nIt might feel too derivative of Maverick but it's easy to imagine Miles Teller in that role\n\nThe Teller/Cruise chemistry is wonderful and I'd love to see them together again. I also feel like Glen Powell could do it; some of those \"Much appreciated, pops\" moments in the bar in the beginning are just pitch-perfect :P\n\nSome things I noticed after the fourth watch:\n\n- Jon Hamm plays a great hardass who never gives an inch, not even so much as a smile at the very end, but he does have ONE little moment where the facade cracks. Last act spoilers: When Maverick gets shot down and he's ordering the pilots to come home, he has one line where he gets choked up and his voice breaks just a little. He's not made of stone after all ðŸ˜¢\n\n- It's been noted that this is a much less sweaty film than the original Top Gun, and for the most part it is, but MAN Miles Teller gets DRENCHED right before they launch off the carrier. I'm talking SOAKING. They hosed our boy down before the camera rolled.\n\n- I really like the colour-coding of the different locations in the final battle. The pilots are flying against white snow, the command room on the aircraft carrier is lit all blue, and the E-2 Hawkeye surveillance plane is lit up in red. It lets them rapid-fire cut between all three without confusion because you know instantly from the colour of the lighting where you are. It also feels like one of the biggest Tony Scott homages in the whole picture. I kept thinking of the beautiful neon-green lit MRI scene in Days of Thunder.\n\n- How did they coordinate Tom nailing a perfect barrel roll around the setting sun in his P-51 in that final shot? He hits it so clean! He is Maverick, you can't tell me otherwise.\n\n- They cut from Phoenix and Bob's plane crashing straight to Rooster with his head in his hands, and then they hoooooold that shot for ages while you're desperate to know if they're OK. Brutal. You're killing me, Kosinski. One of the best scenes in the whole movie.\n\nAmerican Made was great, though\n\nYeah, American Made is quality and it being a Liman project keeps it squarely in the zone of Tom working with his new go-to stable of filmmakers. Biggest hit against American Made for me is that I had just watched Narcos so the story was very fresh in my mind.\n\nNever Go Back is actually the dud that should be referenced in concert with the Mummy as his missteps over the past decade. But even there it's Cruise returning to a filmmaker who he had previously had great success with. And, to be fair, it was also reasonably budgeted and did over twice the budget worldwide so no one took a bath.\n\nAs far as the Mummy goes, I expect that Cruise was hoping that he could form a similar relationship with Kurtzman that he was with McQ, Liman, and Kosinski. But it clearly didn't work out that way.\n\nYeah, American Made is quality and it being a Liman project keeps it squarely in the zone of Tom working with his new go-to stable of filmmakers.

But it clearly didn't work out that way.\n\nNever Go Back was pretty painful, and I loved the first Jack Reacher.. I'd actually completely forgotten about Never Go Back, that's how bad it was!!\n\nOne of my favourite moments:\n\nDuring the final mission when Rooster is freezing up and getting overwhelmed while going through the valley, he closes his eyes and says \"Talk to me dad.\" In that moment, Maverick softly responds \"You got this, kid.\" Rooster then hits the afterburners and gets up to speed. Maverick then lets out a \"That's it kid\".\n\nA nice little scene, especially considering that earlier scene with Penny where Pete let's on that he tried to be the father figure to Rooster when he was younger. In that moment, he was.\n\nDefinitely awesome. I loved the whole father-son dynamic throughout the whole movie and how Mav comes to terms with it. Even the relationship of Mav being the instructor(father) to his Top gun pilot team(his children). You can see some of it when\n\nthe class erupts into a fight and Mav tries to calm them down the way a Father would.\n\nThere's so much of it peppered all over the movie, really a perfect theme for the movie and an aging Maverick.\n\nWife and I watched it a second time last night.\n\nI've literally NEVER gotten her to see a movie a second time in theaters in the ten years we've been together. I only see a movie during the same theatrical run maybe once every four or five years - it's VERY rare.\n\nMovie was just as good the second time. Biggest thing it's got going for it behind the exceptional in-camera shots is excellent pacing. Really isn't a dull moment in the entire thing except MAYBE the Penny boat scene. Movie is firing on all cylinders and has a great run time.\n\nNo joke, the 4K Blu Ray has me debating buying a brand new TV and sound system for our basement...\n\nWhile it definetely is not a great movie, The Mummy gets shit upon a bit too much. It's a solid enough action flick with some wonderfully strange sequences and near-horror from time to time.\n\nAnd in true Cruise fashion, it has a showcase action sequence that bests any other of its kind. The airplane crash scene is by far the most realistic one I have ever seen and he makes what he experiences in it look very convincing. Would not surprise me at all if that scene alone was his reason to do the movie.\n\nThe opening of the Mummy reminded me so much of Uncharted and now I'm mad that we cant get a Cruise Uncharted.\n\nWe still use the B-52 which is a platform from the 50s :P\n\nBut yeah Iran is the only others with F-14s, but I dont think its supposed to be any one country. The first movie was just \"black planes with black uniformed pilot bad guys\" and I think its the same thing here. Not really all that important. :P\n\n\"Soviet-aligned\" would be the closest you could infer from the iconography of the time.. since the 'enemy' \"Mig 28\" jets in the original Top Gun were really US F-5's.\n\nSince in Top Gun Maverick they seem to be using Su-57 felons, we can infer the enemy is \"Russian-aligned\" as a best guess.\n\nThe F-14 does lend itself to the Iran theory, but the US Pacific Fleet isn't sailing all the way around the world to launch Maverick on a mission.\n\nIt's just \"the enemy\" and it's probably better that way."
