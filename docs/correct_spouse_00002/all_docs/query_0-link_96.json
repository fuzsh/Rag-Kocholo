        "text": "The official Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes wedding photograph has been released. First thoughts:\n\n- Tom Cruise is either standing on an apple box or Katie Holmes is crouching. Or she's standing in a well. Or he has some crazy lifts in his shoes. Or did the shoes Giogio Armani make for Katie magically erase some of her height? Is she just slouching uncontrollably (she's never had good posture)? It's such a mystery.\n\n- The background has the unfortunate appearance of looking almost like a Sears Portrait studio background, with the orange-y glow in the background. Obviously it's mood lighting at the castle, but it looks cheesy.\n\n- Katie looks very pretty. Well-cast, Tom Cruise!\n\nThe wedding was reportedly beautiful, as only weddings that cost wild amounts of money can be. And People has all the insane details, like what kind of Armani everyone in the family was wearing, what Katie gave Tom (a $23,000 watch) and how the best man was the holder of the Scientology trademark (which translates into being the head of the Church of Scientology) David Miscavige! Victoria \"Posh Spice\" Beckham satisfied the paparazzi's thirst for someone to pose for picture by basically having a fashion show pre-wedding. And the Post reports that the mayor of Bracciano, the town where the wedding was held, was upset that she wasn't invited to the wedding."
