        "text": "The actress first found love on the set of her hit TV series, Dawson's Creek, with costar Joshua Jackson. Back in 1998, Holmes told Rolling Stone, \"I met somebody last year. I fell in love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable that I will treasure it always … and that I feel so fortunate because he's now one of my best friends.\"\n\nThe two called it quits in 1999, after the first season of their show aired, but stayed close friends.\n\nThe Batman Begins star met American Pie actor Chris Klein in the early 2000s. Both running in the same red-carpet circle, the two hit it off and began dating in 2003. About a year later, the couple announced their engagement.\n\nWhile the two were engaged, Holmes said in an interview with Seventeen, \"I used to think that I was going to marry Tom Cruise.\" Holmes and Klein called things off in early 2005—and the Top Gun heartthrob noticed.\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise became hot and heavy quickly, and were extremely public at the beginning of their relationship in the spring of 2005. After just eight weeks together, the couple got engaged, and later that year, they announced that they were expecting a child together. The two tied the knot seven months after the birth of their daughter, Suri Cruise—now 16—in November of 2006.\n\nCruise gushed over Holmes in an interview with Playboy in May of 2012, saying, \"She is an extraordinary person … when she walks into the room, I just feel better.\" That same summer, after six years of marriage, Holmes filed for divorce.\n\nFollowing her divorce in 2012, Holmes became very reserved about her love life and had a private six-year relationship with actor Jamie Foxx. In October of 2013, Foxx told Entertainment Tonight that the rumors were \"one hundred percent not true,\" but two years later, in 2015, they were spotted holding hands.\n\nTheir next public appearance was in 2017, and they made more outings together after that, as seen photographed here at the 2019 Met Gala. However, the two split just weeks after the event, in May of 2019.\n\nIn September of 2020, the actress was seen in Manhattan with chef Emilio Vitolo Jr. Their relationship was much more public than her previous romance, with multiple instances of the couple's PDA on display while out and about. On one occasion, Holmes was spotted sitting on the chef's lap while they kissed at a restaurant in New York.\n\nThe romance, however, didn't last. The two had a drama-free breakup just eight months later, in May of 2021.\n\nFinally, we have made it to Katie Holmes's current beau, musician Bobby Wooten III. The two were first seen together this past April and have made several public appearances together since then, including at the Tribeca Film Festival in June and The Moth's Anniversary Gala in May. Wooten was also seen meeting Holmes's mother, Kathy Holmes, this spring in New York City."
