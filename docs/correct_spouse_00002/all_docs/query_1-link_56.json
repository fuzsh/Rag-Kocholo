        "text": "Brooke Shields “of course” was always going to attend Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ 2006 wedding — but initially joked why she would have skipped.\n\n“I was gonna say yes to that,” Shields, 58, told Entertainment Weekly. “I was like, ‘Yes. I will — as long as I’m not the something old!'”\n\nThe “Dawson’s Creek” alum, 45, then made a special request before walking down the aisle.\n\n“She goes, ‘Oh, will you?’ And I said, ‘What? Bring myself as the something old?'”\n\n“I had to, like, hunt antique places,” Shields went on, “to find the perfect, you know, gift to give her.”\n\nLuckily, the “Mother of the Bride” actress found a Victorian present for Holmes.\n\n“It was a little compact that you put a ring … So you’re supposed to be able to look at their reflection in it and have it around their finger,” she explained to EW. “It was really beautiful.”\n\nIn 2006, Shields and Cruise got into a public spat when Cruise shamed her for taking medication to address her postpartum depression. “It was so ridiculous to me,” Shields said in her 2023 Hulu documentary, “Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields.”\n\n“It’s not about the moral thing, or the right thing, or the good thing. It’s about who has more power.”\n\nCruise gave his take on Today with now-former co-host Matt Lauer. “There is no such thing as a chemical imbalance. The thing that I’m saying about Brooke is that there’s misinformation. She doesn’t understand the history of psychiatry,” he said at the time. Despite the feud, Shields ultimately got a wedding invite.\n\nHolmes and Cruise, 61, meanwhile, welcomed daughter Suri that same year.\n\nLast month, Suri — who is still estranged from Cruise — turned 18. Suri has mainly grown up in Manhattan and has been shielded from Cruise’s Church of Scientology since the exes split in 2012.\n\nLast year, Holmes told Glamour magazine that she likes to “protect” Suri from the public eye “because she was so visible at a young age.”\n\nShe added: “I’m very grateful to be a parent, to be her parent. She’s an incredible person. She’s my heart.”\n\nCruise, for his part, is also dad to two adopted children, Bella, now 31, and Connor, now 29, with ex-wife Nicole Kidman. Earlier this month, a photograph he took with Bella and Connor in December 2023 went viral. It was the first image of the three together shown in public since 2009.\n\n“My whole life I always wanted to be a father,” the “Top Gun: Maverick” actor told Vanity Fair in 2006.\n\n“I always said to myself that my children would be able to depend on me and I would always be there for them and love them — that I’d never make a promise to my kids that I couldn’t keep.”\n\nHe went on: “I’m not one of those people who believe you can spoil a child with too much love. You can never give a child too much love. There’s just no way.”"
