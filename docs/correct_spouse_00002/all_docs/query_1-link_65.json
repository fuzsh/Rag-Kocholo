        "text": "Suri Cruise is about to become the newest Tartan.\n\nThe 18-year-old daughter of exes Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes will be attending Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., come the fall.\n\nSuri revealed the news via a TikTok posted by a fellow student at New York City‚Äôs LaGuardia High School, which was captioned, ‚ÄúLaG commitment day üëã.‚Äù\n\nThe video, which was set to the tune of Abbi Sutphen‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlways Remember You,‚Äù showed about a dozen students sporting sweatshirts emblazoned with their soon-to-be college names.\n\nWhen the camera panned to Suri, she was wearing a red hoodie that had the words ‚ÄúCarnegie Mellon‚Äù written in white across the chest.\n\nThe teen used her hands to show off the school‚Äôs name as she smiled and made silly faces for the camera.\n\nShe also did a cute dance alongside her friend.\n\nSuri ‚Äî who celebrated her milestone birthday in April ‚Äî paired the telling top with denim jeans, and she carried a navy blue backpack.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, she is ‚Äúleaning towards‚Äù studying fashion.\n\nHolmes, 45, reportedly helped her daughter with her ‚Äúhost‚Äù of applications; however, Suri ‚Äúhas always been determined to forge her own way.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe is a smart girl, and she is turning into a very intelligent mature young woman. She has a very close group of loyal friends, and she knows exactly where she comes from,‚Äù a source told the outlet.\n\nThe source added that although Holmes is proud of her only child, the actress is ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù by the thought of sending her little girl off.\n\n‚ÄúKatie takes great pride in her but is also extremely overprotective,‚Äù the source said.\n\nThe ‚ÄúDawson‚Äôs Creek‚Äù star told Glamour last year that she has worked hard to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù Suri from the spotlight ‚Äúbecause she was so visible at a young age.‚Äù\n\nHolmes went on to call the teen ‚Äúan incredible person.‚Äù\n\nWhile the mother-daughter duo are extremely close, Suri has no relationship with Tom, 61.\n\nAs Page Six exclusively reported, the actor has not seen his youngest child since 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Tom ‚Äî the most famous member of the Church of Scientology ‚Äî admitted that Holmes had filed for divorce after almost six years of marriage ‚Äúto protect Suri from Scientology.‚Äù\n\nRegular members who leave the organization are declared ‚Äúsuppressive persons,‚Äù and those who stay are told to completely cut them off."
