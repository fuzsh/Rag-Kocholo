        "text": "The Kalamazoo\n\nAdrift from his family and estranged from Ezra, Ray is enlisted by a wealthy family to free their kidnapped son and finds himself enmeshed with an entirely new class of people. Meanwhile, a retired Mickey stumbles upon a new enterprise, Abby finds a friend on the streets of LA, and Bunchy's newfound confidence falters when faced with a troupe of Luchadores.\n\nDing\n\nPaige Finney calls on Ray to protect a quarterback from an enraged Navy SEAL. Terry tries to fly under the radar in prison but winds up in a fight with dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, Mickey attempts to take over Gary's prostitute business, Bunchy is tormented by an attractive Luchadora, Abby tries to motivate Conor - and a frustrated Lena considers quitting.\n\nBreakfast of Champions\n\nExclusively employed now by the Finney Organization, Ray puts out fires as Paige tries to broker a deal to buy an NFL team. Terry adjusts badly to life outside of prison, and finds himself in the middle of an unwanted welcome-home party thrown by Mickey. Abby goes to Boston to reconnect with her Southie family whom she hasn't seen in years. And with both parents out of the house, Conor throws a party - only to wind up in over his head.\n\nHandshake Deal\n\nFinney tasks Ray with securing information that could bring down the governor and sink the NFL deal, but the mission turns Ray into a wedge between Finney and Paige. Meanwhile, Conor is thrust into a life-changing experience, Mickey and Daryll sell a coke-and-hooker party to a Silicon Valley start-up and Bunchy and Teresa's relationship finds an unusual release. Plus, with Abby in Boston, it falls on Ray to help Bridget with her scholastic and emotional turmoil."
