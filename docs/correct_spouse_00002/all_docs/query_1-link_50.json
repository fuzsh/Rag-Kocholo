        "text": "Cruise's on-screen chemistry with his \"Risky Business\" costar was not just for the cameras. Though De Mornay was in a relationship with actor Harry Dean Stanton, she and Cruise started an intense affair during the production of the 1983 film. The pair's \"Risky Business\" costar, Curtis Armstrong, revealed in his memoir, \"Revenge of the Nerd,\" that the dynamic on set was awkward at points.\n\n\"I suspect that most of Harry Dean's great qualities were lost on Tom, who, I think, was beginning to regard him as a guest overstaying his welcome. It must have been a little galling to have your heart set on f*cking your costar, and just when you think you're starting to make headway, her significant other comes popping up out of a trap like a lanky, amiable Banquo's ghost,\" Armstrong said (via The Hollywood Reporter).\n\nDe Mornay and Cruise continued to have a relationship until around 1985. In a 2018 interview with Celebrity Page, De Mornay opened up about her romance with the \"Top Gun\" star, telling the outlet, \"I will say that I thought he was very annoying when we first started [filming] . . . He came to grow on me because we wound up together for two and a half years after that film.\"\n\nThough short-lived, one of Cruise's most notable romances was with none other than music icon Cher. The two connected for the first time at the 1985 wedding of Madonna and Sean Penn, though they got to know one another better at a White House event, per People. \"Then a bunch of people who were dyslexic were invited to the White House, and Tom and I are both dyslexic . . . there was definitely a connection,\" she explained to the outlet.\n\nThough it is unknown exactly how long Cruise and Cher's rendezvous lasted, the \"Believe\" singer did tell Andy Cohen on \"Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\" in 2013 that their romance \"was pretty hot and heavy for a little minute,\" and that Cruise was easily in her top five list of lovers.\n\nCruise met his first wife in 1986. The two have differing accounts of how they initially connected, with Rogers claiming that a mutual friend set them up, and Cruise alleging that Rogers was dating someone else when they met, per Parade. Regardless of how the pair crossed paths, their relationship took off pretty fast, and a year after they met, they tied the knot in a private ceremony in May 1987, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nRogers, a second-generation Scientologist, is likely one of the greatest influences that introduced Cruise to the controversial belief system that he has since adopted so passionately. Throughout their marriage, details of the relationship between Cruise and Rogers were constantly speculated, coinciding with the actor's growing fame following films like \"Cocktail\" and \"Rain Man.\" The couple quietly split in 1989 and announced their split in January 1990, as reported by Entertainment Weekly.\n\nThough Rogers and Cruise have an amicable relationship today, the two didn't always see eye to eye after their divorce. In a 1995 interview with People, Rogers spoke harshly about her marriage to Cruise, telling the outlet, \"You cease to be an individual. . . . No matter what the article is, it's 'Tom Cruise's wife. . . .' Waiting for the moment when I don't have to talk about that [blankety-blank] name anymore.\"\n\nAround the time Cruise separated from Rogers, he met Kidman in 1989 while filming the movie \"Days of Thunder.\" The two hit it off right away, with Cruise later revealing (via Newsweek), \"My first reaction to meeting Nic was pure lust . . . It was totally physical.\" The pair wed just months after meeting in December 1990 in a private ceremony held in Colorado, according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\nAfter starring in the 1992 film \"Far and Away,\" the couple adopted a baby girl, Bella Kidman Cruise, shortly after she was born on Dec. 22, 1992, per People. Bella's adoption came after Kidman had a pregnancy loss, which Kidman opened up about in a 2007 interview with Vanity Fair. \"From the minute Tom and I were married, I wanted to have babies . . . And we lost a baby early on, so that was really very traumatic. And that's when we would adopt [our daughter] Bella,\" she said (via People). Three years later, Kidman and Cruise adopted their second child, a boy named Connor Kidman Cruise, after his birth on Jan. 17, 1995.\n\nFor the majority of the '90s, the two were one of Hollywood's greatest power couples. They would collaborate on screen again in 1999 and star as lovers in Stanley Kubrick's \"Eyes Wide Shut\" together, but their marriage deteriorated not long after. In February 2001, the couple announced their separation. The divorce filing cited \"difficulties inherent in divergent careers\" as the cause for the relationship's end, per Entertainment Weekly, though many speculated the split to be partially attributed to the pair's differences in religious beliefs. \"Scientology had NOTHING to do with this,\" Pat Kingsley, the couple's former representative, assured at the time.\n\nCruise met Cruz on the set of \"Vanilla Sky\" in 2000, and the pair started dating in 2001, per People. While there was media speculation that the couple were expecting a child and had plans on tying the knot, nothing of the sort happened, and their relationship was mainly private.\n\nBy March 2004, Cruise and Cruz called it quits, with a source revealing to People, \"The relationship just ran its course and they decided not to be girlfriend and boyfriend anymore. Through most of the relationship they were both shooting movies in separate parts of the world.\"\n\nThough Cruise's relationship with Boniadi was short-lived, it was later revealed to be under unusual circumstances. According to a 2012 Vanity Fair story, Boniadi was one of several actors that were misled by Scientologist leaders to audition for a \"special project\" which required a makeover, training, and confidentiality agreements. Allegedly, the project was actually a quest from leaders in the organization to find Cruise another girlfriend after his split from Kidman.\n\nIn 2004, Boniadi was chosen to be Cruise's girlfriend, and within a month, the couple were living together. The relationship came to an end, however, after a meeting with Cruise and the Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige. Per Business Insider, the event that ended their brief fling involved a misunderstanding between Boniadi and Miscavige. \"Overcome by a severe headache, Nazanin had a hard time understanding Miscavige, which infuriated him. The next day, Cruise — inches from her face — pounded on the table and screamed at her for insulting the head of the church,\" said Alex Gibney in the HBO documentary \"Going Clear.\"\n\n\"Two weeks later, church henchman Tommy Davis delivered the news to Boniadi that her relationship with Cruise was over,\" the documentary revealed.\n\nFollowing his breakup from Boniadi, Cruise met Holmes in April 2005 and started dating the \"Dawson's Creek\" star that same month, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Just one month after their romance started, Cruise notoriously professed his love for Holmes in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in May 2005, which many still associate with the actor even years after it took place. In June 2005, Holmes converted from Catholicism to the Church of Scientology, and the pair got engaged that same month.\n\nBy October 2005, Holmes and Cruise announced that they were expecting their first child together, and on April 18, 2006, they welcomed their daughter, Suri, into the world, per Today. The pair, dubbed \"TomKat,\" eventually tied the knot in November 2006 and went on to garner intense media attention throughout the duration of the marriage.\n\nDespite appearing strong on the outside, the couple's relationship was dwindling behind the scenes. In June 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise, with her rep telling outlets at the time (via Us Weekly), \"This is a personal and private matter for Katie and her family. Katie's primary concern remains, as it always has been, her daughter's best interest.\" A rep for Cruise on the other hand issued a separate statement, which read, \"Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children. Please allow them their privacy.\"\n\nCruise met Atwell on the set of \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One\" in 2020. Though the pair have neither confirmed nor denied being in a relationship, there have been fierce rumors about a romance between the costars. According to The Sun, the two began dating shortly after meeting on set, but kept their relationship under wraps. From that point on, they had an on-again, off-again relationship, and ultimately called it quits in June 2022, with a source close to the two telling The Sun, \"They get on really well, and have fantastic chemistry, which is why they decided to quietly give the relationship another try earlier this year. But what was working behind closed doors didn't work out so well when it was made public, and the fanfare around them as a couple exploded again . . . They have now decided they are better as friends.\""
