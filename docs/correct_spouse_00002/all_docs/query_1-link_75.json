        "text": "Despite being estranged from his daughter, Tom Cruise has not abandoned trying to bring her to Scientology and reportedly has a plan in place to do so.\n\nCruise lost his relationship with Suri once he was divorced by Katie Holmes in 2012 as she feared the influence of the religion over her child and the wider impact it had on their relationship.\n\nIt was something that the \"Mission Impossible\" star didn't even deny, accepting it as a valid assertion of the end of the marriage which began in 2006, reportedly observed by the Church of Scientology.\n\n\"I'm sure his master plan is to wait until Suri gets older,\" Leah Remini said to the public. \"So that he can lure her into Scientology and away from her mother.\"\n\nSuri Cruise will be an adult by then, turning 18 in 2022, but after a decade of no contact with her father Cruise will surely have a hard time convincing her to accept his faith, something he already chose over her.\n\nWhat exactly is Scientology?\n\nTom Cruise joined Scientology in the early 1990s. As a devoted member, his celebrity status and involvement have drawn attention to Scientology, often associating his name with the religion and its controversial aspects but what exactly is it?\n\nScientology is a belief system founded by L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s, combining spiritual principles and self-improvement techniques. It claims that humans are immortal spiritual beings called thetans, evolving through a process called auditing to reach a state of higher consciousness and personal fulfillment.\n\nCore beliefs involve past-life experiences influencing present behavior, with practices like auditing using a device called an E-meter to identify and address mental blocks.\n\nDespite controversy around its practices, Scientology promotes personal growth through courses, counseling, and adherence to its teachings, aiming to achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-realization for its followers, some of which are paid services."
