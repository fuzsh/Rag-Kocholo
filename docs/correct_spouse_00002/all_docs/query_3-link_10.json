        "text": "We got to speak with the next upcoming thriller team Jana (AJ) Mattioli and Serge Levin during their audition process. Lets just say that the quote by Albert \"RealityIsMerelyAnIllusion,AlbeitAVeryPersistent One” describes it best.\n\n“Paragon Algorithm” is a surreal and chilling ride into the untapped dimensions of reality. Written & Produced by Serge Levin (An Affirmative Act) with the support of an award winning Producer & Director Jana (AJ) Mattioli (An Affirmative Act, The Coffee Shop).\n\nThe film tells a story of a genius undergrad physics student, Andrew, who discovers the ultimate equation that quantifies and unlocks the true mechanics of time. His findings will break your preconceived notions about time, and startle you with the immense power that this key commands.\n\nHow many doors does the key unlock, how dangerous are the repercussions, and how permanent are the rips in existence? Through the eyes of Andrew you will embark on a journey of scientific discovery and traverse across several dimensions of our existence\n\nAndrew’s perception of reality will become skewed and the interlacing of various events will become all too reminiscent of a dream. But is it really a dream or the side effects from Andrew’s experiments? You will be the judge.\n\n“Paragon Algorithm” is a visual portrayal of concepts which may seem abstract but actually have solid scientific foundation. Aside from its entertainment merits, the film will also educate the viewer on some basics of quantum physics and mainly time.\n\nMake-up and wardrobe will be done by Stacey Peterson from ”Jerseylicious”, “Bridezillas” and the “Rachael Ray” show. Director of Photography: Gabriel Rodriguez; Sound: Aaron Miller. Production Manager Patrick Henry Phelan. This film is brought to you by Mattioli Productions, Isle Empire Picture, Phobos Film Works, and Pantera Productions."
