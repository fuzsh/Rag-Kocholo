        "text": "1978-present\n\nWho Is Katie Holmes?\n\nActor Katie Holmes is best known for her roles in the hit TV show Dawson’s Creek and Batman Begins. On Dawson’s Creek, which ran from 1998 to 2003, Holmes starred as fan favorite girl-next-door Joey Potter. Next, the Ohio native turned to movies, appearing in Batman Begins—the first of Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy—among others. Off-screen, Holmes made headlines for her marriage and subsequent divorce from fellow actor Tom Cruise. Most recently, she has added executive producer and director to her resume with projects like her 2022 movie, Alone Together.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Kate Noelle Holmes\n\nBORN: December 18, 1978\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Toledo, Ohio\n\nSPOUSE: Tom Cruise (2006-2012)\n\nCHILD: Suri\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius\n\nEarly Life\n\nKate Noelle Holmes was born December 18, 1978, in Toledo, Ohio. She is the youngest of five siblings born to Kathleen Stothers-Holmes, a homemaker and philanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes Sr., an attorney. Katie has three sisters and a brother.\n\nHolmes attended Toledo’s Notre Dame Academy, a private, all-girls Catholic school, where she was a straight-A student. She was accepted at Columbia University in New York but opted to kick-start her acting career, instead. She began acting in 1997, when she was 19, and has since appeared in several movies, TV shows, and plays.\n\nDawson’s Creek and Other TV Roles\n\nMichelle Williams, James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, and Joshua Jackson starred in Dawson’s Creek, beginning in 1998.\n\nAlthough Holmes had earlier film roles, her breakout role was as Joey Potter on Dawson’s Creek. Across six seasons, the teenager grows up in the fictional town of Capeside, Massachusetts, and dates different love interests. Fans were ultimately torn between which one Joey should have ended up with: Dawson, played by James Van Der Beek, or Pacey, played by Joshua Jackson. Holmes’ performance as Joey earned her several Teen Choice Award nominations across the span of the show, which ran from 1998 to 2003.\n\nDawson’s Creek was mostly filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Holmes previously noted that she found it difficult to leave the town and her role once the show wrapped saying, “so much of me is in Joey, and it really felt like I grew up on television.” Holmes has also credited her age at the time of filming Dawson’s Creek for helping her easily connect with her on-screen persona. “I was still a teenager, and it was nice to read a script that felt like it expressed things that I was still trying to understand for myself,” Holmes later shared with Entertainment Weekly.\n\nBut Holmes’ breakout role almost didn’t happen. Originally, showrunner Kevin Williamson wanted Selma Blair to play Joey Potter. Luckily for Holmes, her audition tape performance was so good that it convinced Williamson she was the perfect fit for the lead role. Dawson’s Creek was one of The WB’s most popular shows, premiering to 6.8 million viewers, which Vox reports was the highest rating for the network. In fact, the show was so popular that Holmes even had a cameo in the 1999 comedy Muppets From Space as her Dawson’s Creek character.\n\nKatie Holmes and Matthew Perry attend the premiere of the miniseries The Kennedys After Camelot in March 2017.\n\nMore recently, Holmes had brief appearances on several shows including Eli Stone, How I Met Your Mother, Robot Chicken, and Ray Donovan, on which she played sports agent Paige Finney. In 2011, Holmes landed another lead role in the History miniseries The Kennedys, portraying Jacqueline Kennedy across all eight episodes. She returned as the former first lady in The Kennedys After Camelot in 2017, alongside Matthew Perry’s Ted Kennedy. Holmes served as an executive producer on the miniseries and also directed an episode.\n\nMovies: Batman Begins and More\n\nNot one to be pigeon-holed into any specific role, Holmes’ movie credits includes dramas, comedies, thrillers, and horror movies. And although Holmes loves acting and has been working at it for most of her life, she still finds new projects “terrifying.” Holmes told Variety this is due to embarking on “a whole new beginning of the creative process.”\n\nGary Oldman, Michael Caine, Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson co-starred in Batman Begins together.\n\nSome of her most well known roles are in the movies Batman Begins (2005), Jack and Jill (2011), and The Giver (2014). Her most recent roles include starring in movies she has also directed. When it comes to directing, Holmes doesn’t have any regrets about not starting earlier in her career. “I feel like I came to it when it was right for me, and I’m excited to continue on the path,” she told IndieWire in April 2023.\n\nHolmes’ movies include:\n\nHolmes made her movie debut in The Ice Storm (1997), a drama about two wealthy families bored with their lives who seek an escape from their ennui in the form of substance abuse and secret affairs. Holmes played Libbets Casey, a boarding school student, alongside an ensemble cast that includes Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, and Sigourney Weaver.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Holmes appeared in Disturbing Behavior, Go, Teaching Mrs. Tingle, Wonder Boys, and The Gift.\n\nIn 2004, Holmes starred in First Daughter as Samantha Mackenzie. The romcom featured Holmes as a college freshman who wants nothing more than to blend in with her fellow students, a task made difficult by the swarm of Secret Service agents guarding her every move.\n\nOne of Holmes’ most famous movies is 2005’s Batman Begins, in which she played Rachel Dawes, the childhood sweetheart of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale). Holmes also has some voice acting under her belt as she lent her voice to Rachel’s character in the Batman Begins video game that came out the same year as the film.\n\nIn the 2008 sequel The Dark Knight, Holmes was set to reprise her role as Rachel but opted out in order to work on crime comedy Mad Money, which was also released that year. Instead, Maggie Gyllenhaal took over as Rachel alongside a star-studded cast that saw Christian Bale return as Batman and that also included the late Heath Ledger (in one of his final roles), Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine.\n\nHolmes starred in the 2010 remake of the horror-fantasy flick Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark as Kim Raphael, who is restoring an old estate with her boyfriend and his daughter. Unbeknownst to Kim and company, the property is haunted by malevolent creatures who are out for blood—and teeth.\n\nNext, Holmes appeared in Adam Sandler’s 2011 movie Jack and Jill as Erin, Jack’s wife. The film was panned by critics and reviewers alike, though globally it grossed nearly $150 million against its $79 million budget.\n\nIn 2014, Holmes starred in The Giver, a dystopian movie based on Lois Lowry’s 1993 novel of the same name. In the movie, Holmes plays a judge and the mother of main character, Jonas. Where Jonas seeks to bring change to the staunch society he has grown up in, Holmes’ character is the opposite, favoring suppressive law and order. The movie also features Hollywood heavyweights Meryl Streep, Jeff Bridges, and Alexander Skarsgård.\n\nSet against the backdrop of the 2008 financial crisis, All We Had (2016) marked Holmes’ directorial debut. The movie, which also stars Holmes as protagonist Rita Carmichael, depicts the struggles Rita and her teenage daughter face as they try maneuvering their way out of poverty, homelessness, and Rita’s alcoholism. The film is based off of a 2014 novel of the same name by Annie Weatherwax. Holmes dedicated the film to her daughter, Suri.\n\nWritten, directed by, and starring Holmes, Alone Together is a pandemic-era romantic drama. The 2022 movie features Holmes as June, one of two people who get double-booked in an Airbnb at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hijinks ensue and soon, June and Charlie, played by Jim Sturgess, develop feelings for each other. Complicating their budding relationship is the fact that June is already in a relationship with someone else.\n\nTheater Performances\n\nIn addition to her TV and movie roles, Holmes has also shown off her acting chops on and off Broadway. In 2008, she appeared in the stage adaptation of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons, followed by another Broadway play called Dead Accounts in 2012. From January through April 2023, Holmes appeared in an off-Broadway play called The Wanderers.\n\nRelationships: Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise wed on November 18, 2006, and were married for nearly six years.\n\nOn November 18, 2006, Holmes married actor Tom Cruise in a Scientologist ceremony in Bracciano, Italy. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the whirlwind romance between the two actors began shortly after Holmes met Cruise in April 2005 under the guise of discussing a role in Mission: Impossible 3. By the end of the month, the two had made their public debut as a couple, and in mid-May 2005, Cruise unforgettably jumped up and down on a couch during an interview with Oprah as he discussed his relationship with Holmes. The next month, Holmes and Cruise were engaged.\n\nAfter nearly six years of marriage, Holmes filed for divorce in June 2012. The highly publicized split made national headlines, with some outlets reporting that Holmes had blindsided Cruise. There was also a lot of speculation surrounding the reason for the divorce, with many believing that Cruise’s extreme devotion to Scientology—and his desire for their daughter to grow up in the Scientology church—drove a wedge between the couple. Still, both parties have remained tight-lipped about the reason for their separation.\n\nJamie Foxx and Katie Holmes attend the 2019 Met Gala together.\n\nFor several years after her divorce, Holmes dated actor Jamie Foxx. Speculation about their romantic involvement arose in August 2013 when the two were spotted dancing at a party in the Hamptons. They ended their very private relationship in May 2019.\n\nDaughter\n\nKatie Holmes and her daughter, Suri, in July 2019\n\nIn April 2006, Holmes gave birth to her and Cruise’s first and only child, a daughter named Suri. While together, the couple was notoriously private about her. When the couple separated in 2012, Holmes was granted sole custody of Suri with Cruise being allowed visitation rights. As of a July 2023 report, Cruise remains estranged from 17-year-old Suri, who continues to live with Holmes full-time.\n\nSuri has also dabbled in the film industry, specifically in her mom’s movies, as a singer. She sang a cover of “Blue Moon” during the intro credits of Holmes’ film, Alone Together.\n\nNet Worth\n\nHolmes’ acting, writing, and producing roles have earned her an estimated $25 million. Holmes reportedly earned $1 million for her 2005 role in Batman Begins and previously earned more than $13 million for her starring role in Dawson’s Creek for the duration of the show.\n\nQuotes"
