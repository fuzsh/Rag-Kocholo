        "text": "Days of Thunder\n\nWhen: 1989\n\nWho: Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman\n\nRelationship Ruined: Tom Cruise & Mimi Rogers\n\nDays of Thunder, featuring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, is rife with mixed reviews. Sporting a 38% on Rotten Tomatoes, fans can't make up their minds on if this is one of the best racing films of all time or a \"disappointment on the basic narrative level,\" according to Rotten Tomatoes user. Not to mention it split up a couple for another doomed Tom Cruise relationship!\n\nMany people forget, but Tom Cruise was married BEFORE he married Nicole Kidman. That’s right, folks. Katie Holmes was Cruise’s third marriage. His first marriage was to actress Mimi Rogers, but the moment Cruise and Nicole Kidman met on the set of Days of Thunder, they knew they had a connection. Not surprisingly, Cruise was divorced from Rogers by the end of the year, and Kidman had a nice, new, shiny engagement ring by Christmas.\n\n(Image via Paramount Pictures & Jerry Bruckheimer)\n\nCleopatra\n\nWhen: 1962\n\nWho: Elizabeth Taylor & Richard Burton\n\nRelationship Ruined: Elizabeth Taylor & Eddie Fisher / Richard Burton & Sybil Christopher\n\nThe 1963 film Cleopatra was fraught with drama, and the two leads only fueled the fire. The film went through two directors, took two and a half years to film, and its budget skyrocketed from $2 million to $44 million. And yet, the only thing the public could talk about was the real-life love affair happening between Elizabeth Taylor (Cleopatra) and Richard Burton (Anthony\n\nAt 29 years old, Taylor was already on her fourth husband, Eddie Fisher. Burton, 36 years old, was married to Sybil Christopher. Nothing, not even their spouses, could keep Taylor and Burton from being all over each other both on and off screen. After their respective divorces, the two married in 1964. However, the twists and turns of their dramatic love affair were just beginning. Taylor and Burton would divorce in 1974, remarry in 1975, and divorce one more (this time for good) in 1976.\n\nImage via Twentieth Century Fox\n\nGigli\n\nWhen: 2002\n\nWho: Jennifer Lopez & Ben Affleck\n\nRelationship Ruined: Jennifer Lopez & Chris Judd\n\nGigli was a mess from beginning to end, including everything that went on off-screen. Ironically, one of the worst parts of the film was the lack of chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, yet they ruined Lopez's relationship with Chris Judd for each other.\n\nJennifer Lopez was still considered a newlywed when filming began on the set of Gigli, having married her backup dancer Chris Judd in October of 2001. Just eight months later—and several months after meeting Affleck—Lopez filed for divorce. The most scandalous part was that the ink wasn’t even dry on the divorce decree before J-Lo and Ben were shouting their romance from the rooftops. Indeed, they were in the media so much, that by the time Gigli actually made its theater debut in 2003, it bombed at the office. Overkill, much?\n\n(Image via Columbia Pictures)\n\nTitanic\n\nWhen: 1997\n\nWho: James Cameron & Suzy Amis\n\nRelationship Ruined: James Cameron & Linda Hamilton\n\nWho knew Titanic could get any more tragic?! The film is an utter masterpiece and will go down in film history. Everybody loves the romance and cries at the tragedy... But there's an unknown tragic romance that happened behind the scenes as well.\n\nWhen James Cameron and Linda Hamilton worked together on Terminator 2: Judgement Day in 1991, Cameron swore he had found his muse in Hamilton. The pair dated for several years and married in 1997, during the filming ofTitanic. Nevertheless, around the same time, he would meet and fall in love with actress Suzy Amis. However, Amis herself swears that nothing happened between her and Cameron until they were completely finished filming. Still, Hamilton filed for divorce in 1998 and it was finalized in 1999.\n\nJason Merritt/Getty Images/Getty Images\n\nMade in America\n\nWhen: 1993\n\nWho: Ted Danson & Whoopi Goldberg\n\nRelationship Ruined: Ted Danson & Casey Coates\n\nTed Danson's marriage to Casey Coates faced turbulence during the filming of Made in America in 1993 due to his connection with co-star Whoopi Goldberg. Despite being married, Danson found himself captivated by Goldberg's charm, openly expressing admiration for her on The Arsenio Hall Show. The chemistry between the leads led to an emotionally impactful movie, but the intense attraction also led to the end of Danson's marriage, with Casey granting him permission to leave. The fallout was emotionally challenging for both parties.\n\nHowever, Danson's relationship with Goldberg was short-lived. In the years that followed, Danson found lasting love with Mary Steenburgen, whom he met on the set of Pontiac Moon in 1994. They married and have since built an enduring relationship, highlighting the complexities and evolution of Danson's romantic journey in the realm of Hollywood.\n\nImage via Le Studio Canal+/Regency Enterprises/Alcor Films/Stonebridge Entertainment/Kalola Productions, Inc./Warner Bros.\n\nThe Outlaw Josey Wales\n\nWhen: 1976\n\nWho: Clint Eastwood & Sondra Locke\n\nRelationship Ruined: Clint Eastwood & Maggie Johnson\n\nFans typically rank this western war film from the '70s a 10/10, but we bet the starring actors Clint and Maggie might disagree. While the film is enjoyable, and even the best of it's kind, we understand that it'd be difficult to look back on memories of working on it fondly. Well, Eastwood might not care that much, but who's to say?\n\nClint Eastwood has never really been known for being faithful in his relationships, even before his affair with Sondra Locke on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales. However, it's the one affair that the public remembers most because of the scandal it caused in the ‘70s. Eastwood was already married to Maggie Johnson, but while shooting Outlaw, he began living with Locke. Eastwood and Locke remained in a domestic partnership until a very public and ugly breakup took place in 1989.\n\n(Image via Warmer Bros. & Malpaso Productions)\n\nThe Misfits\n\nWhen: 1960\n\nWho: Marilyn Monroe & Arthur Miller\n\nRelationship Ruined: Marilyn Monroe & Arthur Miller\n\nThe Misfits, described by Variety as a \"robust, high-voltage adventure drama,\" is sported by rave reviews from critics and general audiences alike, with a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. This film only gets better with age — until they remade it in 2021 with Pierce Brosnan, which was notoriously awful. And when Marilyn Monroe is involved, we know there was some hot relationship drama happening behind the scenes.\n\nMarilyn Monroe’s final finished film, The Misfits, was written by her legendary screenwriting husband Arthur Miller. Although the role could have been a pivotal one for Monroe, her continued substance abuse throughout filming made her erratic, and Miller had to constantly rewrite the script. The two were openly cheating on each other and were divorced by the beginning of 1961. Monroe died of an overdose in 1962, and Miller was conspicuously absent from her funeral.\n\n(Image via Seven Arts Productinons)\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day\n\nWhen: 1991\n\nWho: James Cameron & Kathryn Bigelow\n\nRelationship Ruined: James Cameron & Linda Hamilton\n\nIn the early 1990s, James Cameron's relationships became entangled with the making of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. While directing the groundbreaking sci-fi action masterpiece, Cameron fell for his leading lady, Linda Hamilton, leading to the end of his marriage with Kathryn Bigelow. After the shoot, Cameron and Hamilton moved in together. Subsequently, Cameron separated from Hamilton during the filming of Titanic and began a relationship with Suzy Amis.\n\nMeanwhile, Bigelow and Cameron, despite their divorce, maintained a professional rapport, collaborating on the film Strange Days. The complex web of relationships reached a poignant moment at the Academy Awards, where Bigelow, now Cameron's ex-wife, made history by becoming the first woman to win the Best Director award, triumphing over Cameron himself. The intricate dynamics of these Hollywood relationships created a lasting impact both professionally and personally.\n\nImage via Carolco Pictures/Pacific Western Productions/Lightstorm Entertainment/Le Studio Canal+/Tri-Star Pictures\n\nDangerous Liaisons\n\nWhen: 1988\n\nWho: John Malkovich & Michelle Pfeiffer\n\nRelationship Ruined: John Malkovich & Glenne Headly\n\nThe set of Dangerous Liaisons proved to be dangerous territory for John Malkovich as he fell into infidelity with a costar. The movie delivered a captivating exploration of deceit, betrayal, and manipulation, which bled into the personal lives of its stars. Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer had chemistry that was off the charts on screen, and that translated into real life. Or maybe it was the other way around. The two reportedly had an affair on set that would lead to the end of Malkovich’s marriage to Glenne Headly.\n\nIn an interview with Esquire, Malkovich would later allude to his relationship with Pfieffer, although vaguely. \"It's hard to believe Michelle Pfeiffer — not that she's not memorable, God knows,\" he said. \"But I sort of blacked it out. What I'm trying to say is, when I think of the other person, I don't think of me as involved with them. They're uncorrupted by me. As if they were never troubled by my existence.\"\n\nImage via Lorimar Film Entertainment/NFH Limited/Warner Bros.\n\nThe Rum Diary\n\nWhen: 2009\n\nWho: Johnny Depp & Amber Heard\n\nRelationship Ruined: Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis\n\nSince The Rum Diary was merely a \"meh\" film overall, we think it should never have existed. If it were never made, not only would it have escaped the terrible reviews, but it also would have prevented one of the most firey domestic violence disputes of the decade.\n\nJohnny Depp has had his share of high-profile relationships, but none as highly publicized as his relationship with Amber Heard, which—if the rumors are true—allegedly started scandalously on the set of The Rum Diary when it began filming in Puerto Rico in 2009. The problem here was that Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis had been domestic partners since around 1998 and had two children together by then. The Rum Diary was released in theaters in 2011, and Paradis and Depp announced their split in 2012, just days later Heard was spotted boarding a private jet to Vegas with Depp.\n\n(Image via GK Films)\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nWhen: 2000\n\nWho: Ben Affleck & Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nRelationship Ruined: Ben Affleck & Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck's romance blossomed during the filming of Shakespeare in Love in 1998. The movie was a whimsical and enchanting romantic comedy that cleverly weaves historical elements with imaginative storytelling. Portraying lovers on screen, Paltrow and Affleck's chemistry spilled over into reality, capturing the attention of the media and fans alike. Their relationship, marked by public appearances and red-carpet moments, became a prominent feature of Hollywood gossip.\n\nHowever, the pressures of fame and their respective burgeoning careers led to their eventual breakup in 2000. Paltrow has stated that Affleck simply wasn’t in a place in life to have a girlfriend. Their breakup wasn’t the end of their professional relationship, however. The two starred in Bounce together in 2000, yet again portraying lovers. Paltrow encouraged Affleck to go for the role. He believes she did this to help him heal and examine their relationship from a new angle.\n\nImage via The Bedford Falls Company/Miramax Films/Universal Pictures\n\nDaredevil\n\nWhen: 2002\n\nWho: Jennifer Garner & Ben Affleck\n\nRelationships Ruined: Jennifer Garner & Scott Foley, Ben Affleck & Jennifer Lopez\n\nThe 2002 film Daredevil is enjoyable, especially for action lovers, because it's so bad it's actually good. It's better to go into the film with low expectations and just roll with the punches. On the surface, it's simple and silly, but Daredevil was the beginning of the end for two separate relationships! Ruh-roh.\n\nWhen Daredevil began filming in 2002, Jennifer Garner was married to actor Scott Foley, and the world thought \"Bennifer\" was still going strong. However, allegedly the chemistry between Affleck and Garner we all saw on-screen must've translated itself to real life—because shortly after the film debuted in February of 2003, Garner announced her impending divorce from Foley. Affleck and Lopez broke up in early 2004. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were spotted as a couple for the first time in October of 2004, and by 2005, had married.\n\n(Image via Marvel Entertainment Group & New Regency)\n\nGreen Lantern\n\nWhen: 2011\n\nWho: Ryan Reynolds & Blake Lively\n\nRelationship Ruined: Ryan Reynolds & Scarlett Johansson\n\nGreen Lantern was a notoriously bad superhero adaptation. Even Ryan Reynolds knows it was a cheesy film; at least he got to redeem himself with the Deadpool films. Despite Green Lantern's shortcomings, that doesn't stop people from watching it. In fact, it's fascinating to watch Reynolds and Black Lively's relationship unfold in real time... Unfortunately, that meant the end for Scarlett Johansson.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds were one of Hollywood’s \"It\" couples even though they tended to keep their relationship as private as possible. In 2011, both of their careers started to heat up, with Scar-Jo playing The Black Widow in the Avengers and Reynolds scoring the lead role in the Green Lantern. However, Ryan’s co-star Blake Lively may have allegedly had something to do with the reason Reynolds and Johansson suddenly divorced in July of 2011—because Reynolds was remarried to Lively by September of 2012.\n\n(Image via Warner Bros. & DC Entertainment)\n\nSnow White and the Huntsman\n\nWhen: 2012\n\nWho: Rupert Sanders & Kristen Stewart\n\nRelationships Ruined: Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart, Rupert Sanders & Liberty Ross\n\nNot only was Snow White and the Huntsman a box office bomb, but it also dropped a nuclear bomb on two relationships. Everyone probably remembers where they were when pictures of Kristen Stewart dropped making out with director Rupert Sanders...\n\nFor Twilight fans everywhere, the day they found out that Robert Pattinson (aka Edward) and Kristen Stewart (aka Bella) were in a real-life relationship was the best day of their lives. K-Pat was everything—until a leaked photo ruined it all. Apparently, Stewart couldn’t resist the charms of married director Rupert Sanders and was photographed smooching her boss by the paparazzi. Stewart and Pattinson broke up amid the scandal, a marriage was ruined, and unfortunately the director's now-ex-wife and two children got caught in the crosshairs.\n\n(Image via Universal Pictures)\n\nDream House\n\nWhen: 2011\n\nWho: Rachel Weisz & Daniel Craig\n\nRelationships Ruined: Rachel Weisz & Darren Aronofsky, Daniel Craig & Satsuki Mitchell\n\nPsychological thriller Dream House was crushed by critics and general audiences alike, mostly because it's terribly slow, boring, and pretentious. Was it worth the end of two relationships and the drama that followed? No, definitely not...\n\nRachel Weisz had been in a relationship with director Darren Aronofsky for more than nine years, and Daniel Craig was engaged to Satsuki Mitchell, when they began the filming for Dream House. Weisz and Craig had actually been friends since they did a small play together in 1994. However, sparks must have flown on that screen stage because when Weisz left Aronofsky, Craig broke it off with Mitchell. And by June of 2011, Craig and Weisz were married to each other instead, and have been happy together ever since.\n\n(Image via Morgan Creek Productions)\n\nHouse of Wax\n\nWhen: 2005\n\nWho: Chad Michael Murray & Paris Hilton\n\nRelationships Ruined: Chad Michael Murray & Sophia Bush, Paris Hilton & Nick Carter\n\nChad Michael Murray and Paris Hilton? We thought this film was a fever dream... With a whopping Rotten Tomatoes score of 27%, we can't help but agree that this House of Wax remake is nothing to write home about. Some praise it as a guilty pleasure, and we totally agree... you should feel guilty about it!\n\nChad Michael Murray was relatively new to show business when he landed a role on the teen horror flick, House of Wax, costarring Paris Hilton. He had just found popularity and love while starring in the CW network’s hit One Tree Hill. Murray, married to his One Tree Hill costar Sophia Bush, apparently forgot his vows while on the set of House of Wax, because he reportedly hooked up with Paris Hilton—who was then dating Backstreet Boy band member Nick Carter. Bush found out about the alleged affair four months later and tried to have the marriage annulled as a fraud.\n\n(J. Vespa/WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nDon't Worry Darling\n\nWhen: 2020\n\nWho: Olivia Wilde & Harry Styles\n\nRelationship Ruined: Olivia Wilde & Jason Sudeikis\n\nDirector Olivia Wilde cast Harry Styles in her film Don’t Worry Darling after losing her first pick of Shia LaBeouf, but this casting choice would set her life for a crash-course. During production, Wilde fell for her lead man. At the time, she was married to Jason Sudeikis, but the two would announce their separation not long after filming wrapped.\n\nAlthough nothing is confirmed, many speculate that Wilde and Styles had an affair during filming. Wilde states that this is not the case, and she and Styles began their relationship after her marriage was over. However, Sudeikis’ choice to serve her custody papers publicly at a CinemaCon in April 2022 seems to carry a vengeful spirit of someone scorned. The drama surrounding the cast didn’t stop them from delivering performances that kept the audience on the edge of their seats.\n\nImage via New Line Cinema/Vertigo Entertainment/Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nUnderworld\n\nWhen: 2003\n\nWho: Kate Beckinsale & Len Wiseman\n\nRelationship Ruined: Kate Beckinsale & Michael Sheen\n\nKate Beckinsale and her long-time partner Michael Sheen—whom she shares a child with—were both cast in the film Underworld in 2002 under the director Len Wiseman. It was there that Beckinsale met Wiseman, whom she would later marry. Together, however, the two made movie magic with visuals and special effects that help the movie stand the test of time.\n\nIt’s been long-rumored that Beckinsale left Sheen for Wiseman. Wiseman’s ex-wife stated that her husband at the time was unfaithful during the filming of Underworld. Beckinsale denies the allegations and claims that the decision to leave Sheen was difficult and well-thought out. The two continue to co-parent successfully, however Beckinsale and Wiseman have since divorced.\n\nImage via Screen Gems/Lakeshore entertainment/Sony pictures\n\nThe Break-Up\n\nWhen: 2006\n\nWho: Jennifer Aniston & Vince Vaughn\n\nRelationship Ruined: Jennifer Aniston & Vince Vaughn\n\nThis lackluster film The Break-Up was a bit of a prophecy for the demise of Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughns's IRL relationship. Unfortunately, the film was lacking in anything to root for and was ultimately unsatisfying.\n\nShortly after her divorce with Brad Pitt was finalized, Jennifer Aniston starred in a romantic comedy titled The Break-Up. The movie costarred Vince Vaughn, who ironically enough costarred with Brad Pitt on Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Aniston and Vaughn began dating while filming, but the relationship soon fizzled out, mainly due to the attention that was still focused on the Aniston/Pitt/Jolie scandal.\n\n(Image via Wild West Picture Show Productions)\n\nNorthern Lights\n\nWhen: 2009\n\nWho: Leann Rimes & Eddie Cibrian\n\nRelationships Ruined: Leann Rimes & Dean Sheremet, Eddie Cibrian & Brandi Glanville\n\nApparently, 84% of watchers enjoy the 2009 film Northern Lights... Really? What is there to like? How good can a TV movie really be? We think it's so liked by the masses because it's a remake of the popular Nora Roberts romance novel... but it led to plenty of pain for the real spouses not involved with the production.\n\nWhen country music’s sweetheart Leann Rimes decided to start acting, fans everywhere got excited. In 2009, she landed a role on Lifetime’s Northern Lights, based off the book by Nora Roberts, costarring Eddie Cibrian. The two had great on-screen chemistry, but the off-screen chemistry must have been even hotter because the two were caught in a full-blown affair, effectively ending both marriages. Ciprian and Rimes have since been happily married ever since.\n\n(Image via Mandalay TV)\n\nMr. & Mrs. Smith\n\nWhen: 2005\n\nWho: Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie\n\nRelationship Ruined: Brad Pitt & Jennifer Aniston\n\nAnybody who was alive in 2005 knows about the scandal that was Mr. & Mrs. Smith. There we all were, basking in the beauty and love that was Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s marriage, until Friends ended and Brad went off to meet and star in the film with Angelina Jolie. And we all know how the story ends... The film was and is iconic, but was it worth the end of a marriage? Despite the tragedy, fans loved it, and the drama, too.\n\nJen and Brad divorced quickly—the same year the film was released—and Brad got with Angelina, they had a bunch of kids, etc. etc.—then in 2008, Angie blabbed to The New York Times that their children would get to see where \"their parents fell in love\" when they watched Mr. & Mrs. Smith one day. Jen didn't take kindly to her words (and who would???); she later told Vogue, \"I felt those details were a little inappropriate to discuss. That stuff about how she couldn't wait to get to work every day? That was really uncool.\"\n\n(Image via Regency Enterprises, 20th Century Studios, & Summit Entertainment)\n\nProof of Life\n\nWhen: 2000\n\nWho: Meg Ryan & Russell Crowe\n\nRelationship Ruined: Meg Ryan & Dennis Quaid\n\nDespite getting nominated for numerous awards (and losing out on them), Proof of Life is littered with mixed reviews, and we can't help but agree. The performances aren't terrible but ultimately fall flat. In fact, it's surprising that the lead actors got together with the glaring lack of chemistry on screen.\n\nIn 2000, when the thriller Proof of Life appeared on screens across the country, fans were in awe of the on-screen chemistry of the lead actors, Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe. Rumors abounded about Ryan and Russell’s alleged off-screen romance—so much so that the news reached Ryan’s then-husband, Dennis Quaid. And regardless of the fact that Quaid had been caught cheating publicly several times, he divorced Ryan almost immediately upon learning of the affair.\n\n(Image via Castle Rock Entertainment)\n\nWicked\n\nWhen: 2023\n\nWho: Ariana Grande & Ethan Slater\n\nRelationship Ruined: Ariana Grande & Daton Gomez / Ethan Slater & Lilly Jay\n\nAlthough the 2024 film Wicked is yet to be released, rumors of an affair have already tainted the movie’s reputation. Reports have come forward that place Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater, stars of the movie, in a romantic relationship during filming. The problem is that both were married at the time—to other people.\n\nAriana Grande was married to now ex-husband Dalton Gomez. Ethan Slater was married to Lilly Jay, the mother of his child, and the two are still in the mediation phase of their divorce proceedings. In 2023, Grande and Slater made their relationship public, with the timeline of when they separated from their respective partners and when they got together unclear. Regardless of timeline, this Wicked adaptation has already ruined two marriages.\n\nImage via Marc Platt Productions/Universal Pictures\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\nWhen: 1993\n\nWho: Johnny Depp & Winona Ryder\n\nRelationship Ruined: Johnny Depp & Winona Ryder\n\nJohnny Depp and Winona Ryder's love story unfolded during the filming of Edward Scissorhands in 1990. The Tim Burton-directed fantasy film not only marked a pivotal moment in Depp's career but also ignited a passionate off-screen romance between the co-stars. Their relationship, characterized by its intensity and mutual admiration, quickly became a media sensation.\n\nThe enchanting and Gothic atmosphere of Edward Scissorhands seemed to parallel their real-life connection. Despite their engagement, the couple faced challenges, and their high-profile relationship ultimately ended in 1993. The impact of Edward Scissorhands extends beyond its well-deserved cinematic acclaim, cementing once-held Depp and Ryder’s love for audiences everywhere.\n\nImage via 20th Century Fox\n\nMary Shelley’s Frankenstein\n\nWhen: 1994\n\nWho: Kenneth Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter\n\nRelationship Ruined: Kenneth Branagh & Emma Thompson\n\nMary Shelley's Frankenstein was both directed by and starred Kenneth Branagh... Ego, much? The film was received with mixed reviews and was frankly a big miss in our eyes. Mary Shelley's horror novel deserved much better, as did Emma Thompson!\n\nEmma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh were a popular British couple who made films together such as Much Ado About Nothing and Dead Again. However, when Branagh started directing Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Frankenstein’s wife while playing Dr. Frankenstein in 2004, apparently a whole different game of doctor was being played behind the scenes—because Emma Thompson filed for divorce in 1995. The reason given for the divorce was conflicting schedules, but that seems fishy because Branagh and Carter carried on for another five years together.\n\n(Image via TriStar Pictures)\n\nEyes Wide Shut\n\nWhen: 1999\n\nWho: Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman\n\nRelationship Ruined: Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman\n\nReal-life husband and wife, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, starred in the 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The intense and provocative nature of the film reportedly put a strain on their marriage. The movie's explicit content, coupled with the demanding shooting schedule, fueled rumors of marital problems.\n\nThe film explored jealousy and infidelity. Cruise and Kidman’s marriage adding a level that blurred fact from fiction, a purposeful choice on Kubrick’s part that was successful at drawing viewers in. Although Cruise and Kidman denied any negative impact on their relationship, their marriage ultimately ended in divorce in 2001. The exact reasons for their split remain private, but the challenges faced during the filming of Eyes Wide Shut likely played a role in the growing tensions between the high-profile couple.\n\nImage via Stanley Kubrick Productions/Pole Star/Hobby Films/Warner Bros.\n\nPushing Tin\n\nWhen: 1999\n\nWho: Billy Bob Thornton & Angelina Jolie\n\nRelationship Ruined: Billy Bob Thornton & Laura Dern\n\nAngelina Jolie just couldn't stop herself back in the day! Pushing Tin didn't suffer from bad acting; rather, a predictable storyline and meager ending sank reviews. Plus, all of the criticism surrounding Billy Bob Thornton ditching Laura Dern for Angelina Jolie was already enough drama in itself!\n\nPushing Tin was a comedy starring John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton, with a then-unknown Angelina Jolie playing Thornton’s wife. According to the rumor mill, Thornton and Jolie had a steamy off-screen relationship during filming. Normally, that wouldn’t be such a big deal. However, at the time, Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern. As a matter of fact, the biggest part of the scandal was that Thornton and Pitt eloped without alerting Dern, first. She found out like the rest of us—in the tabloids.\n\n(Image via Fox 200 Pictures & Regency Enterprises)\n\nThe Last Face\n\nWhen: 2015\n\nWho: Sean Penn & Charlize Theron\n\nRelationship Ruined: Sean Penn & Charlize Theron\n\nThe Last Face suffered a terribly negative reception among audiences and critics alike, and it was even worse for Sean Penn and Charlize Theron's relationship. With a whopping 8% on Rotten Tomatoes, we can't help but focus on the film's flaws, including a confusing plot and demeaning story.\n\nSean Penn and Charlize Theron had been friends for at least 18 years before they began dating in December of 2013. By December of the following year, Penn had proposed to Theron on a trip to Paris. Everything seemed like it was going swimmingly until filming on The Last Fence began. Rumors of rough production and the couple’s arguments regularly interrupting filming arose, and they broke up a year later right after shooting had wrapped.\n\n(Image via FilmHaven Entertainment)\n\nGone Girl\n\nWhen: 2014\n\nWho: Ben Affleck & Emily Ratajkowski\n\nRelationship Ruined: Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner\n\nOkay, Angelina Jolie was in the center of a lot of relationship drama... but Ben Affleck is even worse! Why aren't more people talking about him?! The 2014 adaptation of Gone Girl was a hit for fans and received rave reviews. While it never will live up to the book, it's a \"good enough\" adaptation to satisfy audiences.\n\nBen Affleck, who was married to Jennifer Garner at the time, showed such interest in actress Emily Ratajkowski during the making of Gone Girl, he even went as far as arranging a bigger role for her in the film. Also, rumors on the set suggested that Ratajkowski and Affleck shared some private time together during production. Was this the catalyst that drove the separation between Affleck and Garner, or the cherry on top that led Garner to finally file for divorce in 2017? His struggles with alcoholism and rumors of an affair with their nanny surely didn't help their marriage either.\n\n(Image via Regency Enterprises)\n\nRosemary’s Baby\n\nWhen: 1968\n\nWho: Mia Farrow & Frank Sinatra\n\nRelationship Ruined: Mia Farrow & Frank Sinatra\n\nThe cult classic horror film Rosemary's Baby is a crowd favorite for a reason. This is one of the best horror drama films of the century. It's so scary that bad things happened behind the scenes, too, including an off-screen affair!\n\nFrank Sinatra and Mia Farrow were an unlikely pair from the beginning because the couple had a 29-year age difference between the two of them. Farrow was just getting her career started, while he had been Hollywood royalty for years. What Sinatra wanted was a housewife, and apparently Mia was not down for that - especially after she landed the lead role in Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby. When filming was extended an extra four weeks, and Farrow refused to leave the project to come home, Sinatra had her served with divorce papers on set.\n\n(Image via William Castle Enterprises; Bettmann/Bettmann/Getty Images)\n\nSilence\n\nWhen: 2016\n\nWho: Andrew Garfield & Emma Stone\n\nRelationship Ruined: Andrew Garfield & Emma Stone\n\nThe 2016 adaptation of the Japanese noble Silence is well regarded for good reason. While it's not a perfect film, it's thought-provoking and provides an emotional look at human nature. What more can you really ask for? While it did many things well, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's relationship didn't manage to survive.\n\nNow this is one for the books! These actors didn’t even appear in this film together! Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield actually met and fell in love on the set of The Amazing Spiderman in 2012. However, after Garfield starred in Martin Scorcese’s film Silence, the relationship seemed to go south. He became so dedicated to the role that he did everything to get into character, such as losing a scary amount of weight. Even Academy Award-winning actress Emma Stone found this to be too much and broke up with him.\n\n(Image via AI-Film, SharpSword Films, & CatchPlay; Ian West - PA Images/PA Images/Getty Images)\n\nmother!\n\nWhen: 2017\n\nWho: Jennifer Lawrence & Darren Aronofsky\n\nRelationship Ruined: Jennifer Lawrence & Darren Aronofsky\n\nmother! is a largely misunderstood film and doesn't deserve the hate it receives. It's an equally horrific and artistic look on human nature and climate change, which is a hugely important topic to address in film these days.\n\nPeople always say it’s a bad idea to date your coworkers, and if that’s true, then it certainly doesn’t bode well when you date your boss. Soon after filming began for mother!, so did Jennifer Lawrence’s relationship with director Darren Aronofsky. The relationship lasted through filming but was cut short after the film was released. The word on the street is that Aronofsky became so obsessed with the reviews for the film, that it proved to be too much for J-Law and she broke things off.\n\n(Image via Protozoa Pictures)\n\nLayer Cake\n\nWhen: 2004\n\nWho: Sienna Miller & Daniel Craig\n\nRelationship Ruined: Sienna Miller & Jude Law\n\nL4YER CAK? aka Layer Cake is a crime film adapted from a novel... and we think it should have stayed that way. While most audiences gave the film positive reviews, we can't help but compare it to Daniel Craig's other action credits and feel disappointed.\n\nNow, before we start slinging mud, let’s all take a moment to remember that long before Sienna was caught cheating on Jude Law, Jude Law was caught cheating on her with the family nanny in 2003. However, having said that, the couple had tried to repair their relationship and move on—that is until Miller started an off-screen romance with her Layer Cake costar Daniel Craig. Miller and Law eventually tried to rekindle their relationship in 2009, but were done again by 2011.\n\n(Image via Marv Films & SKA Films)\n\nBy the Sea\n\nWhen: 2015\n\nWho: Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie\n\nRelationship Ruined: Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie\n\nSurprise, surprise, another relationship that was ruined featuring Angelina Jolie! She just can't catch a break! And with a 35% on Rotten Tomatoes, the films that ruin relationships just aren't worth the drama! At least make a good film if you want to cause a ruckus!\n\nAlthough Mr. & Mrs. Smith wrapped in 2005, the power-celebrity couple continued to live together but didn’t get married until August of 2014—right before they began filming By the Sea, a romantic drama that centers around a troubled marriage. And although we assume the couple in the film can make it through the worst of their troubles, Brangelina went downhill and the couple separated soon after with the divorce finalized in 2019.\n\n(Image via Jolie Pas & Plan B Entertainment)\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nWhen: 2001\n\nWho: Tim Burton & Helena Bonham Carter\n\nRelationship Ruined: Tim Burton & Lisa Marie\n\nThe Planet of the Apes franchise is successful despite the remakes of the original two films leaving a lackluster taste in our mouths. Just watch the originals... Right?\n\nWhen they began filming Planet of the Apes in 2001, Tim Burton was involved in a relationship with actress Lisa Marie (Smith), who was given the role of Nova in this film—and several other Tim Burton films while they were together. However, it was on this same movie set that he would meet and fall in love with actress Helena Bonham Carter and break things off with Lisa Marie to pursue and eventually capture Bonham Carter’s heart. Burton and Helena Bonham Carter would have two children and remain together until 2020.\n\n(Image via 20th Century Fox & Tim Burton Productions)\n\nTo Have and Have Not\n\nWhen: 1944\n\nWho: Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall\n\nRelationship Ruined: Humphrey Bogart & Mayo Methot\n\nIf you're a fan of Casablanca but have watched that film to death, To Have and Have Not is a comparable replacement for the genre. Made only two years later than the former, To Have and Have Not is a brilliant movie that fans were obsessed with. Too bad it caused havoc for the actors involved...\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall were the original Hollywood royalty couple, but many don’t realize the scandal their relationship caused in the ‘40s that allowed them to come together. Not only was Bogart 45 and his young costar only 18 at the time, but he was also already married to actress May Methot. Divorce was not a very socially acceptable norm in those days, and so Bogart’s divorce and eventual remarriage to Bacall made all the entertainment headlines.\n\n(Image via Warner Bros.)\n\nHoney Boy\n\nWhen: 2018\n\nWho: Shia LaBeouf & FKA Twigs\n\nRelationship Ruined: Shia LaBeouf & Mia Goth\n\nWe all know Shia LaBeouf ended things with his ex Karolyn Pho in order to pursue a relationship with Mia Goth after meeting on the set of Nymphomaniac. However, this wasn’t the last time LaBeouf would do this. LaBeouf met pop star FKA Twigs when she played his character’s love interest in Honey Boy, a movie written by LaBeouf about his childhood and relationship with his father. In the movie, LaBeouf essentially played the role of his father, which was pulled off impressively.\n\nTwo years after marrying Goth, LaBeouf would leave her for FKA Twigs. However, the addiction issues and PTSD that he touched on in the movie would translate to real life. The two were together nearly a year before breaking up. In 2020, FKA Twigs sued LaBeouf for “relentless” abuse. He has denied the allegations but recognized and apologized for the hurt his mental health and addiction issues have caused the people in his life.\n\nImage via Automatik/Stay Gold Features/Delirio Films/Amazon Studios\n\nThe Getaway\n\nWhen: 1972\n\nWho: Ali MacGraw & Steve McQueen\n\nRelationship Ruined: Ali MacGraw & Robert Evans\n\nDuring the filming of The Getaway in 1972, the relationship between producer Robert Evans and actress Ali MacGraw faced significant challenges, ultimately leading to the end of their marriage. The intense and stressful production reportedly strained their already tumultuous relationship. Evans was preoccupied with his professional and personal life, leaving his wife wanting more. MacGraw felt herself drawn to her co-star, Steve McQueen, which led to a romantic relationship.\n\nThe affair between MacGraw and McQueen played a pivotal role in the dissolution of her marriage to Evans, leading to their divorce. The scandalous affair and subsequent divorce garnered widespread media attention, marking a turning point in the personal lives of the individuals involved. Ali MacGraw and Steve McQueen went on to marry each other. The Getaway was an engaging cinematic experience, but the events surrounding it forever altered the dynamics of their relationships and left a lasting impact on Hollywood gossip.\n\nImage via Solar Productions/David Foster Productions/Tatiana Films/National General Pictures\n\nMind Over Murder\n\nWhen: 2005\n\nWho: Tori Spelling & Dean McDermott\n\nRelationships Ruined: Tori Spelling & Charlie Shanian, Dean McDermott & Mary Jo Eustace\n\nTV movie Mind Over Murder is the perfect storm of bad qualities. From poor acting to a predictable plot, the only thing that makes it interesting it was happened off-screen and behind the scenes between the lead actors...\n\nTori Spelling is a familiar face on television. After all, she’s been gracing our screens for more than 30 years since she first appeared on Beverly Hills, 90210. So, it didn’t come as any surprise that she had landed the lead role in Lifetime’s thriller Mind Over Murder, starring opposite Dean McDermott. What was surprising was the alleged three-week affair that followed, considering both actors were married to other people. However, the two were married less than a year after the ink had dried on their divorce decrees and they’ve been together ever since—they even stayed together after Dean publicly cheated with multiple women in 2014.\n\n(Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images)\n\nStage Beauty\n\nWhen: 2004\n\nWho: Billy Crudup & Claire Danes\n\nRelationship Ruined: Mary-Louise Parker & Billy Crudup\n\nIn the spirit of Shakespeare, Stage Beauty is a good enough romance film to watch on a random Friday night when you have nothing else to do. But would we say it's terribly impressive? No. While some may argue that it's a skillful adaptation, we say it falls short in many regards... including behind-the-scenes romps between cast members!\n\nIn 2004, Billy Crudup and Mary-Louise Parker had been together for seven years and were pregnant with their first child together when Crudup began filming Stage Beauty with young costar Claire Danes. Parker was seven months pregnant when she got the news that Crudup was leaving her for a woman 11 years younger than him. Danes and Crudup were together for just two years, and Parker still named their son William, after his father.\n\n(Image via Lions Gate Films, BBC Films, & TriBeCa Productions)\n\nStop-Loss\n\nWhen: 2006\n\nWho: Ryan Phillippe & Abbie Cornish\n\nRelationship Ruined: Ryan Phillippe & Reese Witherspoon\n\nStop-Loss might not have been an utter failure, but it was not worth breaking Reese Witherspoon's heart for. It has sincere moments, but overall tried to bite off more than it could chew.\n\nEven though Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon got married at an early age, most of their fans were pulling for them to succeed, and for seven years, it seemed they would. However, in 2006, Phillippe began filming Stop-Loss with costar Abbie Cornish and soon rumors were flying around Austin, Texas, where they were filming, about an on-set and off-set attraction between the two. It is rumored that Witherspoon found out about the affair by reading texts from Phillippe’s phone and filed for divorce by November of 2006.\n\n(Image via MTV Films)\n\nDescendants 2\n\nWhen:\n\nWho: Dove Cameron & Thomas Doherty\n\nRelationship Ruined: Dove Cameron & Ryan McCartan\n\nDisney Channel always has been and always will be fraught with relationship drama, whether one or off screen. Dove Cameron's romantic life underwent a significant shift after the completion of Descendants 2, a colorful and entertaining follow-up to its predecessor. The Disney Channel star, engaged to Ryan McCartan, unexpectedly ended their relationship a few weeks following the film's conclusion in October. The split took a turn when Cameron confirmed her relationship with Descendants 2'co-star Thomas Doherty following the split.\n\nThe revelation added a layer of complexity to her separation from McCartan, who publicly acknowledged the breakup on Twitter, expressing the pain of Dove's decision. Cameron, now embracing a newfound romance with Doherty, emphasized their desire for privacy, stating that keeping the details to themselves makes the relationship feel more intimate and genuine. The impact of 'Descendants 2' extended beyond the screen, reshaping the dynamics of Cameron's personal life.\n\nImage via Bad Angels Productions/5678 Productions/Disney Channel Original Productions\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past\n\nWhen: 2014\n\nWho: Jennifer Lawrence & Nicholas Hoult\n\nRelationship Ruined: Jennifer Lawrence & Nicholas Hoult\n\nJennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult's relationship faced both highs and lows during their time filming the X-Men movies together. The two met during a screen test for X-Men: First Class, and they would quickly begin dating. They shared the screen in multiple installments of the franchise. The intense and demanding shooting schedules may have contributed to strains on their relationship, with periods of separation due to work commitments.\n\nDespite their efforts to keep their personal lives private, the couple faced increased media scrutiny. The two split in 2013 before reuniting on the set of X-Men: Days of Future Past, an intricate time-travelling narrative that that proved to revitalize the franchise, and rekindling their relationship. It was shortly after this that they ended their relationship for good in 2014. While the X-Men films provided a backdrop for their romance, the pressures of Hollywood and the demanding nature of their careers played a role in shaping the trajectory of Lawrence and Hoult's relationship. However, they still went on to make X-Men: Apocalypse together despite their history.\n\nImage via 20th Century Fox/Marvel Entertainment/Bad Hat Harry/The Donners' Company/Genre Films/TSG Entertainment/20th Century Fox\n\nJab We Met\n\nWhen:\n\nWho: Shahid Kapoor & Kareena Kapoor Khan\n\nRelationship Ruined: Shahid Kapoor & Kareena Kapoor Khan\n\nShahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan were a couple long before they began filming Jab We Met, but their romantic relationship would face battles they were unable to win during production. The couple, once Bollywood's celebrated pair, experienced growing differences and tensions. While shooting the film, rumors of their breakup surfaced, and the on-screen chemistry that captivated audiences concealed the off-screen challenges. The strain in their personal relationship became evident, and as the film neared completion, so did their romantic connection.\n\nDespite the professional success of Jab We Met, Shahid and Kareena ended their real-life romance. The reasons for their breakup remain largely private, but the film that showcased their undeniable chemistry also marked the end of a significant chapter in their personal lives, leaving an indelible mark on Bollywood gossip and the memories of fans.\n\nImage via Shree Ashtavinayak Cine Vision/Indian Films\n\nStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\n\nWhen: 1977\n\nWho: Harrison Ford & Carrie Fisher\n\nRelationship Ruined: Harrison Ford & Mary Marquardt\n\nDuring the filming of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope in 1976, an affair unfolded between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. While the movie was a cinematic masterpiece that forever changed the landscape of science fiction and fantasy films, the effect it would have on the personal lives of its leads was everlasting as well. At the time, Fisher, just 19, portrayed Princess Leia, and Ford, 33, played Han Solo, their on-screen chemistry translating into a real-life romance. The problem was that Harrison Ford was married to Mary Marquardt at this time.\n\nThe affair remained a well-kept secret for years, but in her 2016 memoir, The Princess Diarist, Fisher disclosed the details. The revelation shed light on the complexities surrounding Ford's personal life, as he was still married at the time. Eventually, Ford and Marquardt divorced in 1979, marking the end of their marriage and further adding to the intricacies of the behind-the-scenes dynamics of the Star Wars saga.\n\nImage via Lucasfilm Ltd./20th Century-Fox\n\nThe Godfather Part III\n\nWhen: 1990\n\nWho: Diane Keaton & Al Pacino\n\nRelationship Ruined: Diane Keaton & Al Pacino\n\nDiane Keaton and Al Pacino met on the set of The Godfather in 1972. The film not only catapulted their stardom but also their relationship, with the two falling in love through their time together. While their romance gradually blossomed following the 1972 release, it fully developed during the sequel, The Godfather Part II. The third installment represented the end of their relationship, however. The Godfather Part III is a compelling yet somewhat uneven conclusion to the iconic trilogy, with moments of brilliance overshadowed by a sense of narrative fatigue and a less captivating storyline.\n\nDespite the undeniable connection, Pacino's commitment issues strained their relationship, leading to their eventual separation after the release of The Godfather Part III. The cinematic masterpiece not only solidified their place in film history but also etched a chapter of love and complexity in the personal lives of Keaton and Pacino, forever linked to the enduring legacy of The Godfather series.\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures/Zoetrope Studios/Paramount Pictures\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year\n\nWhen: 2010\n\nWho: Zac Efron & Vanessa Hudgens\n\nRelationship Ruined: Zac Efron & Vanessa Hudgens\n\nZac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens' romance blossomed during the filming of the High School Musical movies, marking the iconic couple's journey from on-screen chemistry to a real-life relationship. The Disney Channel franchise, which debuted in 2006, propelled both actors to stardom, and their on-screen characters, Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez, became synonymous with teenage love.\n\nThe chemistry that captivated audiences extended beyond the screen, and Efron and Hudgens soon became one of Hollywood's beloved young couples. In 2008, High School Musical 3: Senior Year was released, yet again pushing the two into the spotlight. The pressures of fame and the challenges of maintaining a relationship in the public eye eventually led to their breakup in 2010. Although their last movie together may not have been a direct cause of their break-up, we’re sure the extra fame that came with it proved difficult. Despite their split, the High School Musical movies remain a significant chapter in the romantic history of Efron and Hudgens.\n\nImage via Walt Disney Pictures/Borden & Rosenbush Entertainment/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\n\nThe Kissing Booth\n\nWhen: 2018\n\nWho: Joey King & Jacob Elordi\n\nRelationship Ruined: Joey King & Jacob Elordi\n\nAlthough The Kissing Booth brought together actors Joey King and Jacob Elordi, the movie also arguably set the two up for failure because they would break up before the second and third installments.
