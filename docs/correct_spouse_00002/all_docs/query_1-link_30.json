        "text": "Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes reached a divorce settlement in record breaking time. However, Katie, who really only wanted her freedom, is walking away with nothing more than child support for the pairâs six year old daughter, Suri. Per their agreement, Tom has to pay Katie $400,000 per year as child support, which is approximately $33,000 per month. Under the law, Katie was entitled to more in child support from Tom, who is reportedly worth $250 million but they wanted to settle quickly.\n\nIn California, there is a statewide guideline at provides a formula for calculating child support. Guideline support depends on several factors including each partyâs respective monthly incomes, the number of children and the percentage of time the children spend in the respective parentâs physical custody. In the case of the Cruise family, Katie accepted a below guideline amount. Parties can sometimes agree to a child support award below the guideline amount, subject to approval by the court.\n\nThe court cannot approve of a below guideline amount unless the parties declare that they are fully informed of their rights with respect to child support, they are agreeing to the order without coercion or duress, the agreement is the childrenâs best interest, the childrenâs needs will be adequately met by the stipulated amount, and the right to support has not been assigned to any county and no public assistance application is pending. (See Cal. Fam. Code Section 4065(a)). The court may still reject any agreement between parents that does not provide adequate support for the children involved. However, in this particular case it is clear that Suriâs needs will be adequately met, given that her father is worth millions."
