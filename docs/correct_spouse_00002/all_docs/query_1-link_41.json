        "text": "Katie Holmes has told her ex-husband Tom Cruise to stay away from their daughter Suri as he is not needed in her life anymore even financially.\n\nThe Batman Begins star, who tied the knot with the Mission: Impossible actor in 2006 and got divorced in 2012, does not want Tom near their 18-year-old girl, reported an insider.\n\nAfter Suri’s 18th birthday, the Hollywood hunk is not liable to pay Katie any child support. Hence, she believes his part in their lives has come to an end.\n\n“Katie’s very clear that Suri doesn’t need Tom’s money to be happy or afford the life they’re accustomed to,” the tipster said. “Katie’s made plenty of her own money and she can take care of her daughter and send her to whatever college she wants.”\n\n“Suri is going to be quite the superstar, whether she goes into business or Hollywood. But one thing that’s very clear as far as Katie’s concerned is that she doesn’t need Tom’s help to get ahead,” they added to Heat Magazine.\n\nThe teenager has “got the brains, talent, and beauty to make it to the top all on her own,” the source noted.\n\nFor the unversed, Katie filed for divorce from Tom in 2012 due to his link to Scientology, as reported. While she was awarded sole custody, Tom was to pay child support of £318,000 a year, plus expenses, including medical and educational costs.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Tom has not been a major part of Suri’s life growing up. It is pertinent to note here that the actor sued a US magazine back in 2013 after they claimed that he has abandoned his daughter."
