        "text": "Adrift: the Curious Tale of the Lego Lost at Sea by Tracey Williams\n\nFor some, summer days spent along Washington’s rocky shores conjure up memories of kite flying, flipping rocks to startle baby crabs, and beachcombing. The joy of finding the occasional shell or sand dollar, a piece of interesting driftwood or the ultimate prize – sea glass – is as linked in our minds as the briny smell of the ocean, the crunch of barnacles beneath our feet, and the shrieks of seagulls.\n\nSome collect agates, or friendship rocks, or stones with question marks on them. Author Tracey Williams has another target: Lego. In Adrift: the Curious Tale of the Lego Lost at Sea, Williams takes us on “a voyage into the changing nature of beachcombing, dragon hunting, plastic in the sea and sand, and the lasting legacy of a cargo spill.”\n\nSo, why Lego? As a child, Williams loved family beach holidays in Cornwall, England. Then, in 1997, the cargo vessel Tokio Express lost sixty-two containers during a violent storm off the south coast of Cornwall. One of those containers held nearly 5 million Lego pieces, which began washing up on the shores of Devon beaches. That they happened to be sea-themed made it more delightful – 97,500 tiny scuba tanks, 79,600 mini spear guns, and thousands of others.\n\nSome of the most prized were dragons – 33,427 black ones and 514 green ones, scooped up by eager children and coveted by others. Dragon hunting captured the imagination and became an obsession for many including Williams, with black octopuses being another favorite.\n\nSoon after the spill, news reached renowned oceanographer Dr. Curtis Ebbesmyer, a researcher known for tracking the movement of flotsam such as ice hockey gloves and rubber duckies. He was able to obtain a shipping manifest from Lego and a box of samples of the various pieces that went down with the Tokio Express. He conducted tests on which pieces floated, and started making predictions about where the pieces would wind up based on global currents and weather patterns.\n\nWilliams uses the Tokio Express event as a starting place to explore the increasing problem of plastic pollution in our world’s oceans. In 2018, she notes, a plastic bag was identified at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Flotsam and jetsam from shipping containers is only one source – but a significant one.\n\nWilliams details several famous cargo spills, like a container of bright orange Garfield the Cat telephones, another of pink detergent bottles, and thousands of running shoes and My Little Pony dolls. Williams is both amazed and horrified by the variety and sheer volume of things that wash up on beaches. She provides a lengthy list of organizations that work to address marine pollution and conservation.\n\nThis petite tome measures 6 inches by 8 inches, perfect to slip into a beach bag so you can dip into it while leaned against a driftwood log on Clayton Beach or in a sand chair perched along Birch Bay. It’s loaded with watercolor illustrations, colorful photographs, maps, poems, and even a scavenger hunt list of items to find within the book.\n\nOverall, Adrift seems like a miraculous little gem that just appeared out of nowhere to surprise and delight readers, just like a treasure washed up on the beach.\n\nChristine Perkins is executive director of the Whatcom County Library System, wcls.org.\n\n(Originally published in Cascadia Daily News, Thursday, July 4, 2024.)\n\nMedicinal Plants of the Pacific Northwest: A Visual Guide to Harvesting and Healing with 35 Common Species by Natalie Hammerquist\n\nHikers beware! It’s the season for stinging nettles, and they’re all over the place on local trails. But one person’s hazard is another person’s healthy elixir — so if you’re like my friend, the minute you see new nettle leaves unfurling each spring, it’s cause for celebration. All it takes is some sturdy gloves, clippers and a gathering pouch.\n\nThis time of year, you can harvest the seeds, which are a fine addition to an herbed salt mix, and can be used to improve kidney health or even hair growth. But before you start foraging, be sure to read through Mountaineers Books’ 2024 offering, “Medicinal Plants of the Pacific Northwest: A Visual Guide to Harvesting and Healing with 35 Common Species.”\n\nAuthor Natalie Hammerquist is an herbalist who studied plant taxonomy and food science at Evergreen State College and then studied under Cascade Anderson Geller, a highly regarded educator who led the botanical medicine programs at Bastyr University and Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine.\n\nHammerquist grew up exploring the Cascades with family. She enjoys both foraging and preparing herbal medicines; her approach blends traditional Western herbalism with Chinese and British folk herbalism. Her book is practical and easy to navigate.\n\nThe first section discusses methods of harvesting medicinal plants. She includes basics like how to decipher Latin botanical names, a list of harvesting tools, a seasonal harvest calendar, and instructions on drying, processing and storing plant material.\n\nNext, Hammerquist gives concise, clear instructions on how to prepare herbal medicine, including tinctures (alcohol extracts of medicinal plants), herbal teas, elixirs, cordials and syrups, infused oils and salves. Plentiful photographs are colorful and compelling.\n\nIn Part Two, Hammerquist runs through 35 medicinal plant species that are commonly found in the Pacific Northwest, from clack cottonwood to clackberry (blackberries are not only delicious eating, but members of the rose family, and used for diabetes, GI conditions, dental hygiene) to St. John’s Wort and Yarrow. Each species includes instructions on harvesting and lists medicinal uses.\n\nPart Three is an illustrated list of the most common toxic and poisonous plants in our bioregion, many of which produce beautiful and tempting flowers but can be fatal to humans. Some have names to warn people (death camas, poison hemlock, chokecherry) but others are less obvious (larkspur, lupine).\n\nIf the poisonous plants haven’t scared you off, return to Part Two and ponder various recipes, like Nettle Sauerkraut, Mugwort Incense, Fir Tip Elixir or Hawthorn Chutney. Gathering the natural ingredients could enhance your next outdoor adventure with a botanical “I Spy” activity.\n\nYou can place a hold on this title at wcls.org. There are several others available on this topic: “Pacific Northwest Medicinal Plants” by Scott Kloos, and “Edible and Medicinal Flora of the West Coast” by Collin Varner are two worthy reads.\n\nDon’t have a Discover Pass but would like to visit a Washington State Park for your foraging adventure? Borrow a Check Out Washington backpack from WCLS. You can find it in the library catalog by searching for Check Out Washington Discover Pass. Each backpack comes complete with binoculars and plant and wildlife identification guides in addition to a Discover Pass.\n\nChristine Perkins is executive director of the Whatcom County Library System, wcls.org.\n\n(Originally published in Cascadia Daily News, Friday, June 28, 2024.)\n\nI Cheerfully Refuse by Leif Enger\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a dystopian landscape in a climate-changed near future, “I Cheerfully Refuse” by Leif Enger tells the story of Rainy, a gentle bear of a man, house painter and aspiring bass player, as he seeks redemption after the loss of his beloved wife, Lark.\n\nSetting sail on Lake Superior in a hand-me-down sailboat named Flower, Rainy points the bow for the Slate Islands where he and Lark once shared happy times. On the journey, he encounters raging storms, shipwrecked corpses rising from the depths due to warming temperatures, and towns of desperate, fearful people Rainy must decide whether to trust. He also gains an unexpected companion in the form of a plucky young girl who stows away on Flower to escape an abusive home situation.\n\nIn this near-future world, the economy, mineral rights, satellites, news “factories,” clean water, prisons and shipping are controlled by a billionaire class of a handful of families. Goods are in short supply; communities fare better where people share resources and treat each other with kindness and respect.\n\nRainy said of the small, rural Minnesota community he and Lark call home, “We understood the margins where we lived. Some still enjoyed resenting the far-flung coasts for their gleam and influence, but I think we all accepted the grace of the overlooked.”\n\nLark is a lively, vivacious librarian turned bookstore owner, and Rainy, never a big reader, becomes smitten with her. He is inspired to read “Beowulf” and “Moby Dick” and “Don Quixote” to impress her. In fact, Lark finds Rainy to be somewhat quixotic himself — to which Rainy responds, “I felt flattered at the comparison to the resolute madman whose eyes saw noble steeds, not nags, and glory, not manure.”\n\nThis comparison gets to the true heart of the novel, the question Leif Enger said inspired him to write it: How do basically good and decent people get through bleak, dark times without stooping to our darker natures? Rainy ruminated, “What scares me is the notion we’re all one rotten moment, one crushed hope or hollow stomach, from stuffing someone blameless in a cage.”\n\nRainy often turns to music as a defense against despair, much as Orpheus played his way into the underworld to attempt Eurydice’s rescue. His five-string Fender jazz bass entertains and comforts fellow travelers, and is even used as currency (both the music and the bass itself) to buy freedom.\n\nWhile “I Cheerfully Refuse” is described as a dystopian novel, Enger points out that it differs in one important aspect. Most dystopian novels are set into motion by something people have no control over, like asteroids crashing into Earth or a pandemic. In this book, Enger says he wanted to explore the “skewed world that we could vote ourselves into” — waking up one day years later to realize that a handful of billionaires control all the wealth, the infrastructure in most of the country is crumbling and detractors to the ruling class may end up in work camps with no rule of law ensuring them fair trial.\n\nEnger is a master storyteller, his voice rich with a Midwestern wit and sensibility, and his stories have a mythic “everyman” quality replete with daring adventure and an element of romance (boats also often feature prominently). His debut novel, “Peace Like a River,” is a classic book club title. I confess that I finished reading “I Cheerfully Refuse” and missed the characters so much, that I immediately started over by listening to the audiobook, excellently brought to life by narrator David Aaron Baker.\n\n“I Cheerfully Refuse” is not-to-miss summer reading at its best. As a bonus, you can kick off your summer reading list by getting a signed copy and hearing Leif Enger speak about writing “I Cheerfully Refuse” at the Village Books in Fairhaven event on Friday, June 14 at 6 p.m. Info: villagebooks.com\n\nLisa Gresham is the collection services manager for the Whatcom County Library System, wcls.org.\n\n(Originally published in Cascadia Daily News, Saturday, June 8, 2024.)\n\nTen Tomatoes That Changed the World: A History by William Alexander\n\nAccording to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, tomatoes are “the world’s most popular vegetable.” Never mind that tomatoes, which come from the flowering part of the plant and have seeds, are more accurately a fruit — they represent 17% of all vegetables produced annually.\n\nAmericans, on average, eat the equivalent of 12 medium-sized tomatoes in a week. Even if you can’t imagine personally munching on that many whole tomatoes, consider that Americans consume roughly 71 pounds of ketchup and 46 pizza slices a year. And then there’s tomato soup, marinara sauce, salsa, tikka masala … in other words, tomatoes are everywhere.\n\nBainbridge Island author William Alexander is obsessed with tomatoes. His first book, “The $64 Tomato: How One Man Nearly Lost His Sanity, Spent a Fortune, and Endured an Existential Crisis in the Quest for the Perfect Garden,” chronicled his (mis)adventures trying to grow his favorite Brandywine tomatoes. His latest, “Ten Tomatoes That Changed the World: A History,” tells the story of tomatoes’ origins in the New World, and their slow but eventual rise to ubiquity in our culinary and cultural landscape.\n\nFans of microhistories (think “Cod,” or “Salt,” or “Stiff: the Curious Lives of Human Cadavers”) know what to expect — a pithy, in-depth analysis of every aspect of tomatoes, with cocktail-party-worthy tidbits and fascinating details aplenty.\n\nAlexander starts with the pomodoro, introduced to Italian high society in 1548 by Cosimo de’ Medici. Although this was the first recorded instance of tomatoes in Italy, it took several hundred more years before Italians fully adopted tomatoes as a culinary staple.\n\nPizza — a dish so common that you can google “pizza + (almost any city in the world)” and find a takeout place — only transitioned into its current form with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese around the 1850s. Italian immigrants brought pizza to New York by the 1890s, but it didn’t take off until World War II. A 1948 article in the New York Times described pizza to the uninitiated: “a round of dough is baked with tomatoes and anchovies and cheese atop, cut into wedges, then eaten with the fingers.”\n\nFoodies — and anyone who’s watched an episode of “Searching for Italy” with Stanley Tucci — have heard about the renowned San Marzano tomato. It’s prized for its firm flesh, easily removed skin, narrow profile (excellent for canning) and sweet taste. Alexander lets readers in on a little-known fact: 95% of the canned tomatoes marketed in the U.S. as San Marzanos are fakes.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the special labels and cans marked “DOP” for “Denominazione di Origine Protetta,” a protected status that is supposed to convey authenticity. In 2010, more than 1,000 tons of counterfeit canned tomatoes were intercepted by Italian police — and this is a drop in the bucket (of tomatoes). As Alexander cheerfully notes, “A thousand tons of fake Marzanos is small tomatoes.”\n\nKetchup, spaghetti sauce, home gardens, heirloom tomatoes and mass-produced greenhouse tomatoes all get their due, as Alexander joyfully examines all things tomato-adjacent. “Ten Tomatoes” was a finalist for the Washington State Book Award for General Nonfiction for 2023 and is a worthy, juicy read. But beware: You may find yourself ordering some takeout pizza while you devour the rest of the book.\n\nChristine Perkins is executive director of the Whatcom County Library System, wcls.org.\n\n(Originally published in Cascadia Daily News, May 28, 2024.)\n\nHere With You: A Memoir of Love, Family, and Addiction by Kathy Wagner\n\nThe opioid crisis has reached epidemic proportions with virtually no place escaping its devastation. Here in Whatcom County, according to data provided by the Whatcom County Medical Examiner’s Office, there were 136 overdose-related deaths in 2023, up from 91 in 2022.\n\nLibraries and other agencies now offer free naloxone, a medicine that can reverse an opioid overdose, and groups like All Hands Whatcom, Whatcom Has Hope and the Native Transformations Project bring community members together to seek community responses.\n\nA story of how one family has been impacted by this epidemic, “Here With You” by Kathy Wagner, is a searingly intimate account of Kathy’s son Tristan’s struggle with addiction that ended when he lost his life to fentanyl poisoning. Kathy lives just over the border in the metro Vancouver area and will be visiting Village Books in Fairhaven at 6 p.m. Thursday, May 9 to talk about her book and her son’s life.\n\nTristan was the youngest of Kathy’s three children and she describes him as being a sensitive, very loving child. Kathy’s two older children had troubles of their own, keeping her full of worry as a single mom; the middle daughter, Tanis, is a Type 1 diabetic who was not always attentive to managing her disease, and Jenn, the eldest, was reckless, strong-headed and dealing with her own demons in the form of alcoholism.\n\nKathy thought the first few drug and alcohol episodes when Tristan was 14 might just be teenage experimentation, but when Tristan started regularly not coming home at night and went to four schools in less than two years due to being expelled, she had to face the reality that Tristan’s brain was different. Drugs would never be “just a phase” for him but were “his North Star” that led to “a dark and tangled trail that ended nowhere — at least, nowhere good.”\n\nAfter failing to get Tristan to go to a residential rehab program, Kathy leaned into his love of martial arts, finding a yearlong intensive program in China where he could study with a Shaolin master. Borrowing from his college education fund to pay for the program, Tristan and Kathy traveled to China together and Kathy studied at the same school for five weeks, beginning her own healing journey with Tai Chi and meditation classes. Tristan excelled under the disciplined regime and direction of the teacher Shifu Wang … until he didn’t.\n\nLeaving China before the end of the program and returning home, the following years were a roller coaster of hope and despair for Kathy as Tristan alternately excelled in a rehab environment, only to break the rules and be asked to leave. During this up and down time, he enrolled in culinary school, nurturing his love of cooking, and worked at several upscale restaurants in the Vancouver area, although the jobs always seemed to end with him being let go after failing to show up one too many times.\n\nKathy worked hard on her own recovery journey during this time, attending Nar-Anon meetings, setting and keeping difficult boundaries, and learning to say “no” to providing money, a place to stay and other support. Anyone who has loved someone struggling with addiction will find Kathy’s story painfully familiar.\n\nWhether you have firsthand experiences with addiction and recovery or just want to better understand the impact of this crisis on individual lives and families, “Here With You” is a brave and timely account from one mother’s perspective.\n\nTo learn more about how opioids infiltrate communities and how different communities have been impacted by the epidemic, check out Sam Quinones’s excellent books “Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic” and “The Least of Us: True Tales of America and Hope in the Time of Fentanyl and Meth.”\n\nKathy Wagner will be at Village Books in Fairhaven at 6 p.m. Thursday, May 9 in conversation with local author and writing coach Anneliese Kamola.\n\nLisa Gresham is the collection services manager for the Whatcom County Library System, wcls.org.\n\n(Originally published in Cascadia Daily News, May 5, 2024.)\n\nDaughters of Riga by Marian Exall\n\nBellingham author Marian Exall trades mysteries for historical fiction with her newest title, “Daughters of Riga,” which follows the lives of several women whose lives crossed paths in Latvia during World War II. While so much has been written about the Blitz in Britain and the occupation of France and the Netherlands, readers may be less familiar with the history of Latvia during that time.\n\n“Daughters of Riga” conveys the complicated socio-political dynamics at play while adding a human dimension with the stories of two girls, Berta and Dani, who meet at the Dutch consulate in Riga. Berta is the shy, young daughter of Richard Vandercam, a Dutch civil servant posted to Latvia at the end of the 1930s.\n\nBerta’s beautiful mother Margriet is a socialite who is miserable to find herself in what she perceives to be a provincial backwater, saddled with a 4-year-old. Berta’s world brightens with the arrival of Dani Loesseps, the 9-year-old daughter of her father’s new assistant, Nellie. The girls enjoy blissful hours in the consulate courtyard, engrossed in make-believe, unaware of the personal and international tragedies unfolding around them.\n\nDani’s mother Nellie knew she was taking a risk returning to Latvia, but after her Dutch husband died she yearned to be closer to family in Riga. Though Jewish, like most Latvian Jews at the time, Nellie’s family had never been particularly observant, and the looming specter of Nazi Germany did not seem as troublesome as the increasing encroachments of Russia from the east.\n\nBut as German hostilities across Europe mount, Nellie introduces a local rabbi to Richard, who hatches a plan to provide travel visas to Dutch colonies, allowing young Jewish men to escape. Soon there are lines of Jewish refugees awaiting papers. Nellie and Richard throw themselves into this work, aware of the risk but compelled by urgency to continue.\n\nExall’s tale takes a while to build. She jumps back and forth in time, from Dani to Berta, at different points in their lives, and back again. It isn’t until the narrative returns to the final days at the Dutch consulate in 1940 that the pace quickens and readers are fully hooked.\n\nAccording to the author’s blog, “Daughters of Riga” was inspired by Exall’s visits with her niece’s neighbor in Southwest France. The neighbor’s father was the Dutch Consul in Kaunas, Lithuania. He issued more than 2,300 visas to Jews fleeing the Holocaust and was credited posthumously with saving hundreds of lives. Exall sets her novel in Latvia, but her consul shares the same strategy (granting visas to Curaçao and other Dutch colonies in the Caribbean) as a means of shepherding Jewish immigrants to safety. Though fictionalized, Exall’s story is equally compelling and inspiring.\n\nFor other wartime stories set in Eastern Europe and the Baltic, try “Salt to the Sea” by Ruta Sepetys, “Anna and the Swallow Man” by Gavriel Savit and “The Zookeeper’s Wife” by Diane Ackerman.

It belongs on any poetry lover’s bookshelf.\n\nFour years later, Kwame Alexander, a poet, educator and author of children’s books, has come out with “This is the Honey: An Anthology of Contemporary Black Poets.” Alexander’s anthology is less a catalog of poets and more a moment in time. Alexander gathered the 154 or so poems in this book with thoughtfulness and deliberation, hoping to acknowledge and shine a light on the joy and sorrow of the Black experience today through the provocative beauty of this poetry. “It’s an unbridled selfie,” he writes in the introduction. “To marvel at. And reflect.”\n\nThe book is divided into six sections, each titled with a clue to the contents: The Language Of Joy, That’s My Heart Right There, Where I’m From, Devotions, Race Raise Rage: The Blackened Alphabet and When I See The Stars: Praise Poems.\n\nAs the title indicates, the poets are all contemporary living Black poets, including well-known names like Elizabeth Acevedo, Rita Dove, Ross Gay, Nikki Giovanni, Amanda Gorman, Sonia Sanchez, Tracy K. Smith, Alice Walker, Frank X. Walker and the same Kevin Young who edited the 2020 anthology mentioned above. Some of the poets have fewer awards and accomplishments than these standout writers, but all the poems were selected for their power.\n\nAnd while Alexander says the poems are “unapologetically matter-of-fact Black,” he invites everyone to find inspiration and to rejoice in the hope this book contains. I would add a caveat that the hope you find in these poems has always come at a cost, and that is not forgotten in these pages.\n\nJacqueline Allen Trimble describes her mother, dressed to the nines, walking down Dexter Avenue in Montgomery, Alabama, in “The Language of Joy.” With “folks on the street joining in the celebration,” the poem creates a rich and colorful visual worthy of a Broadway musical:\n\n“singing and dancing like a free people up Dexter Avenue, / and don’t think they didn’t know they were walking in the footsteps / of slaves and over auction sites and past where old Wallace / had held onto segregation like a life raft, but this / was not that day.”\n\nTrimble acknowledges the dark history of the South calling out the slave trade and segregationist Gov. George Wallace, but the poem is indeed a tangible celebration of Black Americans who have got their own. The poet delights in centering her mother in the story but the end of the poem shows, once again, how the best of times still can cast a shadow and all you can do is keep on heading home.\n\nTragic events of the recent past are called out too. Kevin Powell’s poem “Happy,” ends with the date, Thursday, June 4, 2020, and you can infer that Powell wrote the poem two weeks after the death of George Floyd and the day of his memorial service. Frank X. Walker uses the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic to deliver a heartbreaking poem about his mother.\n\nMany of the poems have a musical theme. A roll call of popular Black musicians name-dropped in these poems includes Mahalia Jackson, John Coltrane, Louis “Satchmo” Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, Bill Withers, Nina Simone, Otis Redding, James Brown and Beyonce, all gathered in service of the celebration.\n\nAlexander rose to the task of bringing these voices together to tell the important story of the Black experience. All the poets are at the top of their game and the book is immersible, by which I mean you can immerse yourself in the poems, moving from one to the other as in a flowing stream, letting the joy and sadness wash over you in waves.\n\nThis is Alexander’s second anthology of Black poetry. His first, “360° A Revolution of Black Poets,” co-edited with New Orleans author and activist Kalamu ya Salaam came out in 1998. That book, according to Alexander, was a “call to action,” and while action is still needed, “This is the Honey” might be described as a call to celebration. Either way, it’s a call to stand up. Ruth Forman’s poem, “Stand” drives home the importance of standing up.\n\n“…but here is the truth / someone will always tell you / sit down / the ones we remember / kept standing”\n\n“This is the Honey: An Anthology of Contemporary Black Poets” is available at Bellingham and Whatcom County libraries and independent bookstores. Alexander will be appearing at Sehome High School at 7 p.m. Wednesday, April 10. Tickets are available through Village Books.

This is the question posed by Emily Grosvenor, feng shui consultant and Oregon Home magazine editor, in her latest book, “Find Yourself at Home: A Conscious Approach to Shaping Your Space and Your Life.”\n\nIn five unique sections each ending with a “Find Yourself” prompt for further reflection, Grosvenor invites readers to explore how the places they’ve lived have shaped them in the past — as well as the ways their current home subtly influences who they are in the world right now.\n\nWhen studying the physical aspects of what makes a great home, Grosvenor turned to the work of environmental psychologists who point out the importance of strong structural foundations to give a feeling of stability, views of the natural world, use of natural materials and adequate daylight to regulate sleep/wake cycles.\n\nA home can have all these structural elements in spades, but the items and your relationship to them may be holding you back, Grosvenor warns. If your home or life feels stagnant but you aren’t sure where to begin making changes, Grosvenor offers simple suggestions for how to get unstuck. Because the Chinese art of feng shui considers 27 to be a powerful number for changing stagnant energy patterns, one exercise suggests moving 27 things in your home, working with what is already there to change your perspective.\n\nOther exercises prompt you to methodically consider your relationship to the objects in your home. Do they keep you stuck in the past or current status quo, or do the objects in your home create a sense of vibrant energy and possibility?\n\nInherited objects can be especially tricky. The presence of some inherited objects contributes to the longer story of who we are and where we came from. But if the inherited objects are kept only because they were meaningful to the relative or family member who passed them along and have no meaning personally, your home may begin to feel more like a museum.\n\nGrosvenor identifies another type of object we collect which she labels “hopeful objects,” things that represent something we aspire to or want to change. Think clothes that don’t fit anymore, half-finished projects, never-read books. While cultivating hope is a good thing, if we are not willing to take the action that would bring the hope to fruition, Grosvenor suggests that it might be freeing to let these items go and move on from them.\n\nFor those who work at home, or simply use spaces in the home to work on projects, Grosvenor encourages evaluating your workspace to see if it supports doing deep work, lengthy periods of uninterrupted creative work (idea borrowed from the popular book “Deep Work” by Cal Newport). Is there adequate lighting to create the necessary sort of energy required for the work being done? If your workspace includes a desk, is it in the feng shui “command position” (facing the room, view of the door, wall behind you)? A desk that faces the wall might create a feeling of being proverbially “up against a wall” or “hitting your head on a wall” at work.\n\nCurious for more ideas on creating meaning and purpose in your life by making spatial shifts and interior design choices in your home? Visit your local library to get “Find Yourself at Home” in print, eBook or eAudiobook.\n\nLisa Gresham is the collection services manager for the Whatcom County Library System.\n\n(Originally published in Cascadia Daily News, Monday, March 25, 2024.)\n\nThunder Song: Essays by Sasha taqʷšǝblu LaPointe\n\nSasha taqʷšǝblu LaPointe has been on many local reading lists as her debut book, “Red Paint: the Ancestral Autobiography of a Coast Salish Punk,” is the 2024 Whatcom READS selection. LaPointe is visiting Whatcom County March 14–16 and participating in a variety of events that are free to the public – check whatcomreads.org for tickets.\n\nHer visit coincides perfectly with the launch of her newest book, “Thunder Song,” a collection of essays that give a counterpoint to, play off of, and dive deeper into themes she explored previously in “Red Paint:” her identity as an Indigenous queer woman, the impacts of multigenerational trauma, and the role of art and music as an outlet for rage and creative expression.\n\nLaPointe kicks off the collection by channeling her namesake, her great-grandmother, the indomitable Vi Hilbert. After dedicating her life to the study and teaching of the Lushootseed language, Hilbert had the idea to commission a symphony based on two spirit songs. One of the songs was a family song. The other was Chief Seattle’s thundersong.\n\nStanding on the stage at Benaroya Hall for the premiere of “The Healing Heart of Lushootseed,” 83-year-old Hilbert intoned, “People have lost their way.” Her hope was for the healing medicine of the music to help guide people forward.\n\nLaPointe juxtaposes Hilbert’s powerful vision with the grief and anger she felt after the murders of George Floyd and so many others at the hands of police, and the protests that followed. She recalls the fear and uncertainty of the first year of the pandemic, particularly acute for her due to her asthma. She describes her anxiety on Election Night 2020, wondering if she would ever feel safe again. She notes that it was a song — a Ramones tune strummed by her partner as a distraction while the election results came in — that transported her, lifted her spirits and gave her hope.\n\nIn “Reservation Riot Grrrl,” LaPointe shares her mixed feelings about the riot grrl movement: so important to her personal development, yet also so exclusionary to people of color. In “The Jacket,” she remembers being obsessed with mermaids as a child — and the cruelty of a white classmate who mocked the off-brand jean jacket her mother lovingly embellished with a picture of Ariel in fabric paint.\n\nIn “River Silt,” LaPointe recalls her uninhibited joy playing in the mud along the Nooksack and resolves to allow herself to feel this joy again. Another heart-rending essay is “Licorice Fern,” where LaPointe fearlessly explores her complicated relationship with her mother, and ultimately lands in a space of forgiveness and healing.\n\nAfter the string of abusive relationships recounted in “Red Paint,” LaPointe appears to have found a partner who accepts her contradictions, honors her deep ties to the Pacific Northwest and celebrates her talents as an artist. That she feels loved and supported is evident. Whether one reads “Thunder Song” cover-to-cover or one-by-one as discrete essays, the overall impression is one of honesty, precise observations and love. “Thunder Song” is further evidence of a star on the rise, well worth following.\n\nChristine Perkins is the executive director of the Whatcom County Library System.

She is commonly referred to as the expedition’s interpreter. One has the impression of a beautiful, competent, wise young woman who matter-of-factly guided a team of white men across the Rocky Mountains all the way to the Pacific. The golden dollar coin introduced in 2000 in her honor further solidifies the mythology; it bears the image of a calm, smiling mother with a baby sleeping snugly on her back, glowing with good health.\n\nNot much is known about Sacajawea. She was born around 1788 into the Lemhi Shoshone tribe near what is now Salmon, Idaho. In 1800, when she was approximately 12 years old, she was kidnapped by a Hidatsa raiding party and a year later sold to Toussaint Charbonneau, a French fur trapper, as his second wife. By the time Meriwether Lewis and William Clark agreed to hire Charbonneau and his child bride to accompany them, Sacajawea was pregnant with her first baby, who she gave birth to en route and subsequently carried thousands of miles. Lest this sound romantic or mild, let’s restate: she was stolen from her family as a girl, raped repeatedly, sold into slavery, forced into marriage with an older man who had multiple wives, and compelled to deliver and care for her first child while suffering extreme physical hardship and hunger.\n\nSacajawea (or Sacagawea, depending on what you were taught and whether you believe her name comes from the Shoshone word for “Boat Launcher” or the Hidatsa word for “Bird Woman”) was only mentioned in Lewis and Clark’s journals a handful of times. Despite their relative silence, she made a major impression on the two, as they named the Sacagawea River after her in 1805. Clark later took her son Jean-Baptiste and her daughter Lizette to raise as his own. Was this a mercy for Sacajawea, or something else?\n\nAuthor Debra Magpie Earling, who is Bitterroot Salish and a retired professor from the University of Montana, takes the bare bones of Sacajawea’s story and invents a rich interior monologue for her, something wholly unique and stylistically challenging. Some will find the broken English, sentence fragments, and unfamiliar Shoshone words to be off-putting, or perhaps pretentious. Readers who are willing to puzzle through strange capitalizations and enigmatic descriptions will find keen insights and transcendent beauty. Earling’s Sacajawea is observant and pragmatic, a survivor. She is taught by her Bia to work hard and not complain. Through her journals, we get her perspective when white men condescended to teach her English, thinking her ignorant and unsophisticated. Her contempt for Charbonneau is thick and bitter. Her life, so marred by fear and violence, has moments of serenity and triumph. Earling gives non-native readers a fascinating glimpse of indigenous ways of knowing and presents a portrait of Sacajawea that is so much more powerful than the whitewashed lore we were fed as children.\n\nThe Lost Journals of Sacajawea is an excellent companion piece to this year’s Whatcom READS selection, Red Paint by Sasha taqʷšəblu LaPointe.

Through beautifully crafted letter exchanges, Kim Fay develops a story of historical fiction in compelling and delightful ways, spanning an evolving 1960s America. The story begins when aspiring writer Joan sends a letter of appreciation to one of her favorite food columnists, Imogen. Along with her kind words, Joan includes a gift of saffron and a recipe for steamed mussels. This loving gift blossoms into years of correspondence as these two women develop a lifelong friendship of love and support which sees them through both times of joy and times of sorrow.\n\nFood remains a throughline for the novel, as both women share their culinary adventures and discoveries, continually inspiring each other to explore new cooking avenues, and finding enduring connections through a shared love of food. Yet food is merely a touchstone for the plot’s journey, as the heart of the story is about friendship and its strength when facing adversity. Love & Saffron explores many social issues that span the 1960s to today, including the role of women in the workforce, women’s health, interracial relationships, racial and cultural discrimination, and the traumas of war, to name but a few.\n\nIn addition to the era, Love & Saffron is a novel of place: a firmly West Coast tale. Joan writes of life in southern California and travels to Mexico, while Imogen is a Camano Island resident who becomes active in Seattle’s civic preservation. Imogen’s letters should resonate particularly well with longtime PNW residents, and those curious about life in Seattle some sixty years past. Fay writes with such craft that the setting almost becomes a third character at times, drawing the reader intimately into the times and places of Love & Saffron.\n\nLove & Saffron should appeal to readers of historical fiction, as well as foodies, and those interested in a story of loving friendship and support.

The story, however, is more about the local inhabitants of the Big Island, their heritage, their complicated history and their legacy.\n\nWith fair skin and red hair, Hi’i does not resemble her mother, nor any of her young brown Naupaka cousins who run half-naked along Puhi Bay, dashing among the waves and gobbling their grilled fish and rice. Years of being called “Haole girl” and “mosquito food” leave her feeling vulnerable, an outsider in her own family.\n\nHi’I doesn’t know her father — and her mother, Laka, has no explanation for why she fled Hilo that summer of 1966 or what happened during the two years she was on Maui. All Hi’I knows is that her mom was crowned Miss Aloha Hula at the Merrie Monarch Festival right before she left and that surely, Hi’I too could claim her birthright and dance hula. Hi’i’s journey of self-discovery and acceptance ultimately has her following in her mother’s footsteps, in a story that is both personal and relatable to a broader Hawaiian experience.\n\nThe author, Jasmin ‘Iolani Hakes, is careful to note on her website (jasminiolani.com) that, like Hi’I, she was born in Hawai’I to a dark-skinned mother, but is light skinned herself. Neither Hakes nor her mother have Native Hawaiian on their birth certificates, but may share this heritage even if it is not documented. She recognizes that her novel is controversial to some, who believe that she does not have a right to tell this story, which touches on sensitive issues related to race and cultural appropriation.\n\nHakes writes eloquently and critically of the blood quantum system, initially imposed by colonizers to limit citizenship, that continues to divide and exclude people. She addresses her own struggles feeling deeply connected to a place and culture without feeling able to legitimately claim the culture as her own.\n\n“Hula” alternates between the stories of Hi’I, her mother Laka, and Laka’s mother Hulali, intermixed with commentary from an omniscient first-person plural narrator representing the community at-large. Dialogue is sprinkled with a fair amount of Hawaiian pidgin, left for the reader to decipher in context. Readers will gain a deeper understanding of the beauty and significance of hula and the history of the Hawaiian Sovereignty movement, while following the difficult and bittersweet relationships of three generations of women.\n\nBy all means, if you want to linger in the islands, revisit James Michener’s epic novel “Hawaii,” which came out in 1959, the year that Hawaii was granted statehood. Note the differences with Lakes’ more modern (and Native Hawaiian-centered) interpretation of history. You may also enjoy Kawai Strong Washburn’s “Sharks in the Time of Saviors” or Kaui Hart Hemmings’ “The Descendants.”\n\nChristine Perkins is the executive director of the Whatcom County Library System.

Janssen\n\n“Life, like a river, can take some sharp twists and turns. People can shift as much as a water’s course. There are reasons I broke my promises. I want them to be known.”\n\nThus begins the coming-of-age story of Josie Belle Gore, daughter of a Louisiana train engineer and a Texas seamstress, as she struggles to make a life for herself during one of the most turbulent periods of American history. “The Ways of Water” by Teresa H. Janssen is historical fiction inspired by Janssen’s grandmother’s life.\n\nSet in the Southwest desert and California between 1907–21, Josie and her family are buffeted by world events — economic boom-and-bust, war and pandemic — that take Josie from New Mexico’s Jornada del Muerto to Bisbee, Tucson, Los Angeles and finally post-World War I San Francisco.\n\nJanssen intended to write a biography of her grandmother’s life based on interviews conducted at the nursing home in Seattle where she lived, but as she began writing, she realized there were too many gaps in the story and that it was better suited as historical fiction. Told in first person from Josie’s perspective, the novel does retain the intimate feeling of a diary.\n\nJosie’s childhood feels like it is nothing more than a journey from one calamity to the next, some created by world events like Pancho Villa and civil unrest threatening their desert homestead in Chihuahua, and some by family dysfunction, like Papa losing his job with the railroad due to his drinking.\n\nJosie’s journey is heart-wrenching, but not unusual for young girls and women in that day. When her mother needs to go to work to make ends meet, Josie foregoes schooling to take care of her brothers and sisters. When she leaves home at 16 rather than be married off to an older suitor in whom she has no interest, she finds work at Western Union and a boardinghouse to live in, run by a strict but caring matron who watches out for “her girls.” From there, Josie is aided at many crucial transitions by the kindness of strangers who take her in and treat her like family.\n\nJanssen is a historian herself, and “The Ways of Water” is firmly grounded in the history of the times: railroad strikes, the Spanish flu epidemic, revolution and civil war in Mexico, the trauma of losing so many young men in the first World War and the impact of the war on society. If you enjoy well-researched historical fiction, put this engaging debut on your reading list.\n\nYou can also meet the author and hear about her process for turning fact into fiction when Janssen visits Village Books and Paper Dreams in Fairhaven to talk about “The Ways of Water” from 4–5 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 28 in the Readings Gallery.\n\nLisa Gresham is the collection services manager for Whatcom County Library System.

Through extensive field research conducted at dinner tables across America, interviewing families spanning the range of socio-economic backgrounds, Priya Fielding-Singh paints a portrait of both inequity and commonality.\n\nAll parents want what’s best for their children. Yet Fielding-Singh finds that what is “best” is highly subjective and greatly impacted by one’s economic status. Splurging on a coffee shop treat or giving in to a child’s request for junk food can be seen as a waste of money or an unhealthy habit by some, but for families working multiple jobs and drowning in debt, these things can be something totally different: An all too infrequent opportunity to say “yes” to a child’s request.\n\nWhen so much is economically out of reach, parents view things completely differently. Conversely, households with strong economic stability have the capacity to worry about a child’s supposed excessive weight gain; an issue a family living paycheck to paycheck may not have the bandwidth to see as a concern.\n\nMoving beyond the topic of food inequality in America, Fielding-Singh also highlights the enduring role mothers typically assume as the parental figure who bears the psychological weight of family meals and their children’s health and eating habits. Despite many advances in gender equality, this entrenched legacy endures. The burden spans the socio-economic divide impacting most mothers. While not brought forward at the outset of Fielding-Singh’s work, this runs as a larger theme undergirding the whole book.\n\n“How the Other Half Eats” opens a window on the scope of food inequality in America and can serve as a nice starting point for engaging in conversations about our varied and unique experiences with food security and insecurity, family meals and lingering gender roles.\n\n“How the Other Half Eats” is the January selection for the Books & Bites book group. Read the book and then join Books & Bites at the Blaine Library 1 p.m. Friday, January 19 for a time of community and lively conversation.

We watch sturdy tugs push heavy barges. And we may eat the catch the mariners bring to shore. But exactly what is going on aboard — and under the waterline — is mostly unknown.\n\nThe organizers of Bellingham’s SeaFeast and Dockside Market do their part to pull back the curtain, inviting locals to learn more about maritime culture and our working waterfront at the annual October festival and twice-monthly seafood market at Squalicum Harbor.\n\nOn a recent Saturday, that is where I met author and maritime artist Tom Crestodina. Among Dockside Market booths selling cod, halibut, wild Alaska sidestripe shrimp and chowder, he was setting up a table loaded with his books, “Working Boats: An Inside Look at Ten Amazing Watercraft” — a 2023 Washington State Book Award finalist — and the recently released companion coloring book.\n\nPublished by Sasquatch Book’s Little Bigfoot imprint, the 56-page, 9-by-12-inch full-color “Working Boats” is marketed to young readers, but it will appeal to people of all ages. In highly detailed cutaway illustrations, Crestodina peels back the exterior of the vessels to reveal the mechanics of each featured boat. The result is like having a chance to peek through the windows of a house passed each day.\n\nIn addition to being an artist, Crestodina is also a working commercial fisherman and maritime engineer, which is evident in the vibrantly colored three-dimensional perspective drawings, cutaways and exploded view illustrations. His firsthand experience lends an accuracy and charming intimacy to each illustration.\n\nThis is a book to slowly page through, spending time to study the intricately drawn illustrations of interior and exterior working elements and to consider what it must be like to work and to live aboard. Readers will become absorbed in the details, looking for slices of life — like a guitar on a bunk or laundry hanging on a line in the engine room of a salmon seiner. We see where the catch is stored, and find out where the crew eats and sleeps.\n\nThrough sketches and brief text that is both practical and whimsical, we learn the mechanics of engines and propulsion and how to make a set when fishing for salmon. A cutaway of a double-ended ferry shows the activity of the upper decks most Washingtonians know — cars loading, passengers choosing snacks from the galley and families standing on the deck — but Crestodina’s illustration and text also reveal the engine room and hardworking propellers below.\n\nIn addition to details of the 10 featured vessels, “Working Boats” also describes topics such as safety gear, navigation aids, commercial fishing and lighthouse lenses.\n\nThe author and illustrator began making cutaway drawings in 2011 to connect with his young son while Crestodina was at sea. Soon, fellow mariners began asking for illustrations of their boats and a side business was born. Sasquatch editors found his work hanging on the walls of a Seattle coffee shop.\n\n“In part, (the illustrations) are made so that seafarers can hang them on their wall and use them to explain their work to aunts and uncles from Oklahoma,” Crestodina writes on his website, thescow.bigcartel.com. “Some are diagrams that explain fishing methods and other aspects of the maritime trades. Many of them contain inside jokes just for fishermen and sailors. Some contain silly jokes just for kids.”\n\nFollowing the success of “Working Boats,” last month Sasquatch published the companion coloring book with 31 full-page illustrations of vessels, marine life and seafaring scenes to color. Bow-based poet and fisherman Tele Aadsen wrote the tightly crafted, compelling descriptions for each drawing.\n\nAccording to his website, Crestodina is working on a third title in his Working Boats Library to be titled “Safety, Salvage, and Survival at Sea.”\n\nWhen he’s not at sea, Crestodina lives in Bellingham with his wife and two children. His books are available at the library and local bookstores and will also be sold during the Holiday Dockside Market taking place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 16 at the Fishermen’s Pavilion at Squalicum Harbor. They are a delightful way to learn more about seagoing vessels and our neighbors who work aboard.\n\nReviewed by WCLS Community Relations Manager Mary Vermillion\n\nOriginally published in Cascadia Daily News, Dec. 11, 2023\n\nIt may seem strange for a public library system to publish an annual gift guide, but hear us out: All of the books mentioned in the 2023 roundup are gifts, whether you check them out from Whatcom County Library System (WCLS) as a treat for yourself, or purchase them for friends and family.\n\nOur fabulous librarians have a firsthand view of all the new materials added to our library shelves over the past year, and have selected some of the best to share with you.\n\nYou can pick up a paper copy of WCLS’s 2023 Gift Guide at any WCLS branch library — we serve all of the communities in Whatcom County outside the city limits of Bellingham — or view it online at wcls.org.\n\nThe following are a few highlights to get you started.\n\nFor a young child who marches to their own beat: Bellingham’s talented picture book author and illustrator Keith Negley’s book “A Lot Like Batman” speaks to all the kids who may not feel like they fit in. Negley’s exuberant illustrations celebrate kids who may be quiet, shy or introverted — and points out they share these characteristics with a famous superhero, and it’s great to be amazing on your own terms.\n\nFor the school-aged reader who appreciates little details: “101 Ways to Read a Book” by Timothee de Fombelle and Benjamin Chaud presents a creative rundown of cleverly named types of readers — from the diva who gestures widely while reading aloud to a flock of birds, to the innovator who “upends the norm” by sitting in a chair turned on its side. Readers of all stripes will recognize themselves and realize they are not alone.\n\nFor the tween reader who adores animals and beautiful words: Dave Eggers (yes, that Dave Eggers) has written a wholly original children’s adventure story about a stray dog named Johannes. “The Eyes & the Impossible” follows Johannes as he notes the changes happening in his urban park and reports them to three wise bison who are the Keepers of the Equilibrium. The book is interspersed with lush oil-painting-like illustrations.\n\nFor the teen who’s glued to their phone: “Tell Me What Really Happened” by Chelsea Sedoti is a thriller where the mystery is reported entirely through police interviews. Five teens head out into the forest one night to have some fun — and then one vanishes. The four who remain all tell different stories to the cops. Who’s lying? What are they trying to cover up?\n\nFor the adult mystery fan who loved “Knives Out”: Meet Ernie Cunningham, a wise-talking member of a notorious crime family, heading to a family reunion at a remote mountain resort. As the title states, “Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone,” and when a dead body turns up, Ernie knows he won’t have to look far for the culprit — but which family member did it? Author Benjamin Stevenson has invented a modern-day sleuth with attitude.\n\nFor the newcomer to Whatcom County, or for someone who loves the Northwest in all its glory: “On Island Time: A Traveler’s Atlas” by Chandler O’Leary is a collection of “illustrated adventures on and around the islands of Washington and British Columbia.” Loaded with charming hand-drawn illustrations and maps, readers will want to savor all the details, recognize familiar places, and learn about the wondrous animals, vegetables and minerals of our corner of the Salish Sea. This one’s going on the top of my own wish list (hint, hint).\n\nReviewed by WCLS Executive Director Christine Perkins\n\nOriginally published in Cascadia Daily News, Dec. 9, 2023\n\nThe Wok: Recipes and Techniques by J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nThe 2023 winner of the Washington State Book Award for General Nonfiction, J. Kenji López-Alt, is not a flash-in-the-pan.\n\nHis first book, “The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science,” was a New York Times bestseller and won a 2016 James Beard Foundation Award. In 2020, he wrote a children’s picture book, “Every Night is Pizza Night.”\n\nHis latest is a tribute to the wok, “the most versatile pan in your kitchen,” and it takes the science-meets-art approach he honed as a cook in “America’s Test Kitchen” and as an editor for Cook’s Illustrated.\n\nLike the venerable magazine, “The Wok: Recipes and Techniques” includes copious how-tos with step-by-step instructions and full-color photographs. It also offers lengthy sidebars that get into the nitty-gritty of related topics such as “The Truth About MSG” and “Buying and Salting Eggplants for Stir-Fries.”\n\nFinally, because finely sliced meats and veggies feature prominently in wok cuisine, there are multiple pages devoted to knife skills. For those who just want clear, easy-to-follow recipes, this book has many, with chapters on rice, noodles, frying and simmering, and “simple, no-cook sides.”\n\nLópez-Alt grew up in Manhattan, the grandson of Japanese immigrants. After working as a cook and editor, he became the managing culinary director of the food blog, Serious Eats. He started a YouTube channel in 2006 (now boasting 1.43 million subscribers and 195 million views), opened a restaurant in San Mateo in 2007, became a New York Times columnist in 2019 and moved to Seattle in 2020.\n\nHe now has an Instagram account (618,000 followers) and posts regularly on TikTok, all of which led The Seattle Times to call him “maybe the most powerful food influencer this city has seen in the social media age.” His GoPro videos of late-night forays into the kitchen to cook Asian comfort food showcase his laid-back style.\n\nLópez-Alt is not afraid to show a little personality in his books, with plenty of puns (wok on!) and not-so-serious asides. Take his investigation into what makes inexpensive Chinese-American takeout so beloved: “A little gloppiness is OK. It’s an essential part of the totally authentic inauthentic experience.”\n\nHe’s all business when it comes to technique, however. He has thoroughly researched the best knives and woks to buy, the key pantry ingredients and tips on how to use electric burners when a gas range is not available. His recipes are no-nonsense with clear directions.\n\nTwo things to look out for: specialty ingredients and ambitious cooking times, which may be accurate for a practiced chef but not for a neophyte. The crispy chow mein noodle cake with shiitake and bok choy topping I made was savory and crunchy as advertised, although it could have been more piquant.\n\nSichuan smashed cucumber salad was a winner, fresh with a touch of heat. López-Alt’s pad thai came as close to “restaurant flavor” as any pad thai recipe I’ve tried so far. Palm sugar and tamarind pulp seem to be the secret, with dried small shrimp and shrimp paste for additional authenticity.\n\nThe recipes are primarily from Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisines, although there are some Filipino, Korean, Malaysian, Taiwanese and Vietnamese dishes as well. If you’re craving quick and flavorful Asian food, grab a wok and a copy of “The Wok: Recipes and Techniques.”\n\nReviewed by WCLS Executive Director Christine Perkins\n\nOriginally published in Cascadia Daily News, Dec. 2, 2023\n\nWhere the Language Lives by Janet Yoder\n\nVi taqʷšɘblu Hilbert was 49 years old when she got a phone call that changed the course of her life.\n\nThom Hess, a linguist at the University of Washington, called Hilbert and asked her to review an audio recording of one of her mother’s traditional Coast Salish stories he was transcribing.\n\nIn 1972, Hilbert began her formal study of Lushootseed, the language she had heard at home as a member of the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe. Before long, she was teaching the class herself.\n\nShe wrote a textbook with Hess, and then the first Lushootseed dictionary. Hilbert gathered traditional stories into book form, transcribed tape recordings of elders speaking Lushootseed and made it her mission to revive a language that was nearly dormant.\n\nHess once said, “Thanks to [Hilbert’s] herculean efforts, much more [Lushootseed] history, grammar, lexicon and myth have been saved from oblivion than posterity has any right to expect.”\n\nJanet Yoder experienced her own transformative moment at the age of 27, when she joined Hilbert’s class at UW to fulfill an academic requirement for her master’s degree. After volunteering on several projects, Yoder was welcomed into Hilbert’s circle.\n\nOver the course of 30 years, Hilbert became Yoder’s mentor and dear friend. Hilbert brought Yoder along to hundreds of cultural gatherings, rituals, canoe races, lectures and celebrations. In turn, Yoder faithfully recorded and transcribed conversations with Hilbert and published essays about her work.\n\n“Where the Language Lives: Vi Hilbert and the Gift of the Lushootseed” gathers these essays into one volume, presenting a sympathetic portrait of a formidable woman whose impact on Indigenous culture and our understanding of it earned her the distinction of being named a Washington State Living Treasure in 1989.\n\nAlthough Hilbert died in 2008, Yoder’s sensitive depiction of her will live on, as will Hilbert’s work and the Lushootseed language she shared with the world.\n\nYoder begins with “Ten Things I Learned From Vi Hilbert” (No. 1 is “Make Strong Coffee”) and this list vividly illustrates Hilbert’s personality and verve.\n\nAccording to Yoder, “Vi was happiest when her calendar had a lot of entries on it,” she loved shopping and gift-giving, honored her ancestors, and worked with increased urgency after a stroke and an aneurysm reminded her that time was short.\n\nIn the book, Yoder points out that Hilbert could be generous and loving, but could also become angry and hold a grudge. Mostly, she writes, Hilbert expected people to do what she wanted and did not accept “no” for an answer.\n\nYoder’s essays are straightforward, her diction plain and terse at times. One gets the sense that Yoder has internalized Hilbert’s speaking pace and delivery in her writing. This allows moments of wisdom to shine through, and touches of humor, too, like when Hilbert, who consulted daily with the spirit world, was asked where the “other side” was.\n\n“Beats me,” she said.\n\nYoder muses, “Perhaps we don’t need to know where the other side is, only that we may reach it via fire or prayer. Or through love.”\n\nThis book was nominated for a 2023 Washington State Book Award for Creative Nonfiction/Memoir, an award won by Vi Hilbert’s great-granddaughter Sasha taqʷšɘblu LaPointe, her namesake.

Priest grew up in the Lummi Nation, while Yerington was raised in Bolinas, California. Gusta hails from New Jersey, while Black was raised in the Sonoran Desert. And Mookherjee grew up in Bellingham but spent the summers of her school years in Kolkata, India.\n\nBlack’s poem, “Under the Only Tree for Miles,” has a line that may shed some light on how all these poets from everywhere, or at least this poet, ended up in the northwest corner with us: “I was running away 180 knots and headed west and north and out to sea to get away from the desert / but I wasn’t always /and I didn’t forever.”\n\nThe poets write in free verse and in form, they speak of grief and ritual, magic and the mundane, sometimes forcefully, sometimes cushioned in humor or metaphor. They explore their pasts and in doing so, call us to explore our own.\n\nPriest, talking about Gusta’s book, says, “… you may recognize your friends, your lovers, and yourself in the attitudes and anecdotes that inhabit these pages.” In interviews, Mookherjee speaks of the value of holding space for “not knowing.”\n\nIn the midst of their diversity, what these poems have in common is authenticity and introspection.\n\nYerington’s poem, “Honey Incantation,” points out where poetry fits in the taxonomy of magic: “I learn magic that turns my fingertips yellow/ How to use a drill: practical magic. /How to call raccoon mystics to my front yard: impractical magic. /How to pin poems to a prayer box: necessary magic.”\n\nPoetry is necessary magic indeed.

Patterson has done the work to fully develop these women and allow their voices to rise above the male-dominated plays.\n\nIn the poem, “Hermione, Shapeshifter,” Hermione, whose child, Perdita, was taken from her, details her supernatural visitations, “Ghost or bear, Storm or stone. Child I’m whatever / you need.”\n\nI’ll leave it to you to dive into the play “The Winter’s Tale” and find those references to ghost, bear, storm and stone. Patterson, in those lines, imbues these critical scenes with Hermione’s maternal intervention. Shakespeare did not claim the bear and ghost to be manifestations of Hermione, but Patterson’s explanation makes sense and makes for a more interesting story. The bard has been one-upped by the poet.\n\nIn another poem, Hermoine’s daughter, Perdita, now 16 years old, voices the confused pain of her abandonment with a stinging rebuke, “To out-mother my mother is easy … All I have to do is / Don’t disappear.”\n\nSuch a wicked burn, undeserved if we know the whole story, but Perdita only knew she had no mother. Again, this is not Shakespeare, it’s from Patterson’s imagination, but it rings true to anyone who has had interactions with a teenager.\n\nThis is a collection that will stimulate both brain and heart. Sit with it on a quiet Sunday morning with nothing to interrupt your deep dive. Take one poem at a time. Soak in the poem, then turn to Wikipedia to discover the backstory. Then read the poem again.\n\nThis is not a “one and done” type of poetry book. Each poem is a doorway into a deeper investigation of the literature and culture behind it. Each character is drawn with a depth that goes beyond their original depiction. Patterson invests them with characteristics and mindsets that feel authentic whether they are women of the 16th century or the 21st.\n\nThis collection has sparked my interest in the 400-year-old plays that inspired it, and I know as I delve into the works of Shakespeare, whether on the page, stage or screen, this book will be close at hand to bring out the feminist voice of these characters.\n\nReviewed by Neil McKay, online experience coordinator, Whatcom County Library System\n\nOriginally published in Cascadia Daily News, Oct. 9, 2023\n\nTeaching in the Rain: The Story of North Cascades Institute by John C. Miles\n\nThe North Cascades inspire dreamers. Count among them a group of five friends who, beginning in the early 1980s, turned a shared vision into the North Cascades Institute.\n\nThe nationally respected environmental education nonprofit organization marked its 35th anniversary in 2021. The milestone spurred author and institute insider John C. Miles to chronicle the organization’s remarkable history in “Teaching in the Rain: The Story of North Cascades Institute.”\n\nTo write the story, Miles combed through historical records and interviewed staff — chiefly Saul Weisberg, who was among the five determined dreamers who conjured the idea of a field school in the North Cascades.\n\nWeisberg went on to serve as the organization’s first executive director until his retirement in 2021. Bec Detrich now leads the institute based in Sedro-Woolley.\n\nThe 254-page book honors Weisberg’s leadership, but it also records the contributions of National Park Service staff and others who built the dream of transformative learning experiences at the “convergence of natural and cultural history, science, humanities and the arts.”\n\nMiles, who is professor emeritus of environmental studies at Western Washington University’s College of the Environment, was among the early supporters. He was the first chair of the institute’s board of directors, and for three decades helped to steer and cheer its growth.\n\nBecause of his own long connection to the organization, Miles’ careful recounting of North Cascades Institute’s development is enlivened by a behind-the-scenes perspective. His book reads as local history, a business lesson and a love letter.\n\nThe honest retelling of the organization’s history includes tense moments between North Cascades Institute leaders and skeptics among National Park Service and Seattle City Light staff. The book also addresses issues of equity and diversity in the institute’s programming and staffing.\n\nChapters trace the lifecycles of North Cascades Institute’s environmental education programs for adults and young people, including the popular Mountain School, and the construction of the Environmental Learning Center on the shores of Diablo Lake.\n\nReaders may recognize people who contributed to the nonprofit’s success, including board members such as Village Books co-founder Chuck Robinson, instructors such as Robert Michael Pyle and staff such as Wendy Scherrer, among many more. Black-and-white photos of staff, students, supporters and institute sites, as well as small sketches by Susan Morgan, illustrate the book.\n\n“Teaching in the Rain” will stir happy memories for alumni of North Cascades Institute programs, while also providing a peek behind the curtain, revealing the sometimes-uncertain trajectory of the scrappy nonprofit that — at least to this participant — always presented itself as an assured professional. Readers unfamiliar with the institute can enjoy the book as a history of environmental education, as a nonprofit handbook or simply as encouragement to go outside.\n\nSitting quietly in the background as the institute’s story unfolds are the North Cascades themselves. “A wild, gloriously scenic concentration of mountains, glaciers, deep forested valleys, and falling waters,” Miles writes. His history of North Cascades Institute invites us to explore, to honor and to protect this spectacular ecosystem.\n\nThis summer’s Sourdough Fire is a reminder of just how fragile this dream remains. The fire burned close to the institute’s Environmental Learning Center, causing staff to cancel classes and to temporarily close the center.\n\nJust as they did during COVID when they shifted to online classes, institute leaders are determining how to navigate this uncertain time.

He created mega-hits with Johnny Cash, Adele, Neil Diamond and others. Dr. Dre calls him “Hands down, the dopest producer ever that anyone would ever want to be, ever.”\n\nRubin’s evolution from college innovator to media mogul would make a fascinating memoir. Instead, his first book is not that — at all. “The Creative Act: A Way of Being” is a poetic primer for unlocking your creative potential.\n\nFilled with zen kōans, pithy quotes, poetry fragments and bulleted lists, it’s a quick read that may set off your “woo-woo” detectors … until you stop and ponder, re-read and come around to the idea that Rubin may be on to something.\n\nKnown for sporting a trademark flowing white beard and dark shades, Rubin projects a laid-back, zen vibe. To many, he’s achieved guru status, so his enigmatic words of wisdom throughout this book are on-brand.\n\n“When the work has five mistakes / it’s not yet completed. / When it has eight mistakes / it might be,” he writes. “Look for what you notice / but no one else sees.”\n\nThe cynical among us might balk at the obviousness of some of Rubin’s observations or the meandering nature of the narrative. Others may wish for a few more anecdotes from his colorful past, some name-dropping perhaps, but Rubin sticks to concepts instead of spilling the tea.\n\nHe’s divided his treatise into “78 Areas of Thought” beginning with “Everyone is A Creator” and ending with “What We Tell Ourselves,” with stops for “(Possibility),” “A Whisper Out of Time” and “(Regeneration).”\n\nThis may be one of the most cryptic Tables of Contents ever written. Yet allow yourself to sink into its pages, suspend your disbelief momentarily, and go with the flow. Open yourself to Rubin’s analogy of the source of creativity being a cloud — constantly changing in shape and form, disappearing and re-appearing, always emerging as something new yet deeply familiar.\n\nFollow his advice to consider your responses when experiencing new art for the first time, especially radical, groundbreaking work. And, for Pete’s sake, if you’ve checked out a library copy of this book, use sticky notes to keep tabs on interesting musings and leave the highlighter for your personal edition.\n\nJudging from the number of rave reviews on Goodreads (4 stars, nearly 13,000 ratings and counting) plenty of people find Rubin’s book to be inspirational and practical. Young writers, musicians and other artists just starting their creative journeys may be especially jazzed.\n\nRubin’s ability to coax artistic genius from the musicians he works with speaks for itself. Let “The Creative Act” guide you on your own artistic path.\n\nReviewed by Christine Perkins, executive director, Whatcom County Library System\n\nOriginally published in Cascadia Daily News, Sept. 23, 2023\n\nTrailer Park Psalms: Poems by Ryler Dustin\n\nRyler Dustin’s latest book of poetry, “Trailer Park Psalms,” is a slender volume of poems that speaks to readers with a quiet voice.\n\nDustin developed his skill as a poet and spoken word performer at the long-running Poetry Night open mic at Stuart’s Coffeehouse on the corner of Bellingham’s Bay and Holly streets, and went on to represent Seattle in the Individual World Poetry Slam. His voice is uniquely his own but calls to mind some of the great American and Pacific Northwest poets of previous generations.\n\nThese poems are restless and searching. Searching for the holy. Searching for meaning.\n\n“Bless our uncooked Northwest skins / ghost white, except for Ian’s,” he writes.\n\nThe book begins with a benediction, a blessing for the storyteller’s humble beginnings in Whatcom County — the corrugated tin and duct tape of the trailer park, the neighborhood kids with their quirks and secrets, the blackberries, nettles and Douglas fir that many PNW folks recognize as touchstones of their own childhood.\n\nFrom there, the tome traces a spiritual and geographical search for respite or maybe release.\n\nLocals will recognize the Bellingham landmarks mentioned in the poems: Northshore Road, Agate Bay, Whatcom Creek. That last one was the scene of a tragic accident that is recounted in the second poem. Certainly, it’s the most powerful moment in the book. It evokes a sadness that shapes our interpretation of the rest of the poems.\n\nDustin writes: “If a boy’s palm cups to catch the whisper\n\nOf flame, if he stands passing a butane lighter\n\nBack and forth with his friend\n\nIt is to learn how beauty burns the fingers\n\nHow the forbidden holds inside it the holy.”\n\nThese poems are restless and searching. Searching for the holy. Searching for meaning. The speaker travels far from home, recounting to us his thoughts and experiences with a wistful voice.\n\nSome poems take place in London, England and Bergen, Norway; others closer to home in Washington and Oregon towns, outside Henderson Books and “in the empty lot across from K-Mart.” The distant poems provide contrast to the local ones.\n\nWhen I read “The night we met was pink gin, your grin / limbs lifting in fake fog,” I felt like I knew which bar in Bellingham that was. But the scene might well have taken place in a drinking establishment in London or Bergen instead.\n\nThere is a lexicon that is familiar to those of us who attended church as children. It’s a language of faith that is second nature, and feels comfortable on the tongue or in the pen. In Dustin’s poems, you can sense his awareness of the presence — and sometimes of the absence — of God.\n\n“It is dangerous, on nights like this / to look for the Lord in his works,” he writes.\n\nDustin is a poet on a dangerous journey, searching for “the Lord,” or the truth, or a sign or a connection as he makes his way home. He currently resides in Bellingham and for that, we are grateful.\n\n“Trailer Park Psalms” is available at Bellingham and Whatcom County libraries and independent bookstores. Ryler Dustin will be reading his poetry at 4 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 17 at Village Books.

He has published three books of poetry and has presented his work in venues across the country.\n\nIn 2021, at the peak of the pandemic, Lashley gave a live 10-poem performance via Zoom. Filmed at Mount Baker Theatre’s Walton Theatre with just four audience members allowed in the theater, he delivered a performance both forceful and melancholy. It’s required listening for anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with the not-so-quiet storm that is Robert Lashley.\n\nLashley’s first novel, “I Never Dreamed You’d Leave in Summer,” is a human story, a tale told through letters written by a young Black man, Albert, to his mentor, Professor Thompson. The location is modern-day Tacoma, and the theme is regret and second chances. This same theme and location figure heavily in his three books of poetry.\n\nA cursory glance at the titles of some of his poems bear witness to the world inhabited by the novel’s characters: “Elegy for a Stick-Up Kid,” “Ode to a Basement Hair Salon,” “Said the Ghetto Nerd to Narcissus at the Bar” and “From the City Bus that Took My Black Ass to School, 4:51 AM.”\n\nLashley’s protagonist, Albert, spends much of the novel regretting his past. “I’m not Grendel,” his first letter begins, with melodramatic and literary aplomb. Albert believes he is worse than this evil monster killed by Beowulf, the hero of the thousand-year-old epic poem of the same name. (Note: if you never actually read “Beowulf” in high school, you are in good company. The literary references had me confronting the gaps in my knowledge and flipping through Wikipedia across the entire novel.)\n\nAlbert knows Grendel because he has been given a literary education by respected elders in the Black community in Tacoma, including his mama. They have made it their business to provide him every opportunity to succeed. But these opportunities do not protect him from the drug culture on the streets of Tacoma. Born in the Hillside Terrace Housing Projects, Albert is timid and vulnerable and an easy target for a drug dealer named Big Thomas.\n\nBig Thomas offers him protection, food and candy in exchange for running small amounts of drugs and then raises the stakes on Albert. While the novel does not describe sexual assault or violence in detail, these are difficult passages to read through and Albert returns to his thoughts of Big Thomas throughout the novel.\n\nAlbert and the other characters in the novel ring as true as those in his poems. (Image courtesy of Robert Lashley)\n\nIn a much later scene, Albert is confronted by a young boy nervously pointing a gun at him during a gang initiation and he expresses empathy and sadness. “They prodded him like they prodded me, just like now-faded men in gutters had once prodded them as boys. The specter of all our Big Thomases hung in the air.”\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, however, Albert is not so wise nor confident. He is writing from a homeless shelter. His life, he feels, is a series of bad choices and consequences that have left him feeling like a monster, undeserving and repentant.\n\nDeserving or not, Albert is given a second chance working in Mrs. Eulalah’s beauty shop, which becomes the safe refuge in which Albert finds some humanity and acceptance and humor. The women who work there accept him but push him to do better through no-nonsense dialogue and concrete service. Self-pity has no place among the combs and the creams and the Crown Royal.\n\nAlbert and the other characters in Lashley’s novel ring as true as those in his poems. The conceit of letter-writing is delivered with an earnestness that elicits empathy. Albert’s voice blends street talk and literary references with a bit of endearing nerd-speak. (“Kick rocks in flip-flops,” he says in an angry rant to his mentor.)\n\nThroughout, there is extensive use of a racial epithet used to refer to Black people, which reads as authentic and integral to the voice of the letter-writer. This slim volume is a fairly quick read, but it will move you and challenge you.\n\n“I Never Dreamed You’d Leave in Summer” is available at independent bookstores and Bellingham and Whatcom County libraries.\n\nLashley will discuss his novel with fellow author and Western Washington University English Professor Carol Guess at 6 p.m. Monday, Sept. 11 at Village Books, 1200 11th St. Register for the event at villagebooks.com.\n\nReviewed by Neil McKay, online experience coordinator, Whatcom County Library System\n\nOriginally published in Cascadia Daily News, Sept. 8, 2023\n\nPhoebe’s Diary by Phoebe Wahl\n\nWelcome to Bellingham. The year is 2006. Teenagers smoke weed, play pool at Kendrick’s and rent movies from Trek Video. Flirting happens via flip phone and Myspace. Irony and ballet flats are in.\n\nPhoebe is a sophomore who wears DIY skinny jeans, listens to the best indie bands and attends play rehearsals with her drama club friends. In the sanctuary of her room, she draws and writes about the complex social dynamics she encounters in high school. When we first peek inside her diary, we discover that 15-year-old Phoebe is full of desires — some material, like an iPod that won’t randomly skip around, and some intangible. She wants a BOYFRIEND, to be a Real Artist and to not feel so alone.\n\nSpoiler: She becomes a Real Artist.\n\n“Phoebe’s Diary” is the fictionalized and illustrated version of Phoebe Wahl’s own teenage journals. This is Wahl’s fifth book and her young adult (YA) debut. Her previous books, including “Little Witch Hazel” and the Ezra Jack Keats Award-winning “Sonya’s Chickens,” are picture books illustrated in Wahl’s lush, distinctive style of collage, colored pencil and bright watercolors.\n\nMost pages of “Phoebe’s Diary” are illustrated with inky watercolor scenes from Phoebe’s life. In intricate, full-page illustrations, Phoebe and her friends traipse through Bellingham’s wooded trails, crowd together to watch “Rocky Horror” at a Halloween party and celebrate Passover (with real wine!) at a raucous seder. Drawings of Bellingham scenery add texture and context to Phoebe’s diary entries. Miniature still lifes and expressive portraits with speech bubbles illuminate moments that are too big to be expressed with words alone.\n\nThe illustrations in “Phoebe’s Diary” are a tribute to young people’s superpower: self-expression through style. Whenever Phoebe writes about a new character, she introduces them with a drawing that highlights their unique sartorial choices. Annie: “Definitely not on the skinny jeans train.” Nora: “Long, glorious hair like Eowyn from ‘Lord of the Rings,’ but red.”\n\nWahl honors the seriousness of special occasions and the clothes that accompany them with full-body illustrations of the outfits Phoebe wears to Bumbershoot, prom and her 16th birthday party.\n\nWhen Phoebe starts keeping this journal in the weeks before her sophomore year, she is crushing on three different boys in her theater club. Her yearning for romantic love is a regular topic of diary entries — a chance encounter is enough to fuel days of daydreaming. By October, she has winnowed her crushes down to two, and by November, she is holding hands with someone who takes her by surprise.\n\nAs her first real relationship blossoms, Phoebe brushes up against new tensions. How can she follow her heart without leaving her best friend behind? Can she convince her big sister that she is mature enough to have sex — or at least will be by next summer?\n\nIn between significant, sometimes sporadic life updates, Phoebe confesses her obsessions, fears and insecurities. The life she leads in her head is passionate and exciting, and the real world often feels bland by comparison. Halfway through the school year, Phoebe is faced with a tough decision: Will she focus on her paintings for the Community Arts Showcase, or keep performing with her theater friends?\n\nSpeaking personally, reading “Phoebe’s Diary” as an adult was a nostalgic, bittersweet experience. I attended high school during the same years as Wahl, and this book brought me back to a simpler, less frightening time — or at least that’s how it exists in my memory. The YA readers who make up this book’s target demographic aren’t old enough to remember mix CDs, but teen angst is relatable no matter what decade you grow up in.\n\nPhoebe’s earnestness made my heart ache for teenagers everywhere who are struggling to become their true selves. I wish I could gift this book to a younger, less secure version of myself and say, “See, it’s not just you. You’re not alone.” Wahl and her fictional counterpart give voice to the universal truths we hold inside ourselves: the desire to be loved and the vulnerability of loving others.\n\nReviewed by Emma Radosevich, collection development librarian, Whatcom County Library System\n\nOriginally published in Cascadia Daily News, Sept. 2, 2023\n\nNo Two Persons by Erica Bauermeister\n\nSome people mark summer by road trips and barbecues. Book lovers track the season by the pages we’ve read. Like Jenga pieces, we pull hardbacks from our teetering “to be read” piles, scan media for trending titles, and turn to library and bookstore staff for the next great book we’ve yet to discover.\n\nWhat makes a great book? I think author Erica Bauermeister has it right. Quoting her friend Holly Smith, Bauermeister says: “A great book is one that you love.” This truth drives Bauermeister’s latest title, “No Two Persons,” a novel that celebrates the life of a particular book.\n\nThis quiet celebration of the power of story and the world of books may be the perfect coda for your late-summer reading.\n\nPublished in May, “No Two Persons” is Bauermeister’s fifth novel. Her popular backlist includes “The Scent Keeper,” which was a Reese’s Book Club pick. She also wrote a memoir, “House Lessons: Renovating a Life,” which chronicles her family’s decades-long journey renovating a historic home in Port Townsend where she now lives with her husband.\n\nIn her years of writing and reading, Bauermeister noted how readers can perceive and respond differently to the same story. She says “No Two Persons” is “inspired by all the readers and book clubs I’ve talked with, all the students I have taught. Each with their own opinions. Each with their own love of words.”\n\nIn “No Two Persons,” she honors opinions and books by following a fictitious debut novel, “Theo,” from its creation through publication and criticism and, finally, down its varied pathways to readers.\n\nThe book opens with the story of the writer, Alice Wein, and how “Theo” came to the page. In separate chapters, Bauermeister summons nine readers; the distinct personalities and range of occupations are a testament to Bauermeister’s instinct for story.\n\nFirst up, we meet Lara the publishing assistant, who finds Alice’s book among a slush pile of manuscripts. Next, there’s Rowan, a former actor who has retreated to a remote island in British Columbia where he records audiobooks in his home studio. In subsequent chapters, “Theo” inspires an artist named Miranda and a free diver named Tyler, and it saves the lives of Nola, a homeless teenager; Kit, a bookseller seeking love; and William, a widower. The eighth reader, Juliet, is an intimacy coordinator for movies. The final character is Madeline, the agent who published the book.\n\nEach of these nine readers reacts to Alice’s book in diverse ways, but all find the story they need because of who they are when they read it. Bauermeister quietly links the lives in each chapter. Beyond the obvious ties, careful readers may find additional references and associations the author has described as “love notes slipped between pages.”\n\nAs Bauermeister foretells, readers will have their opinions and connect in different ways — or not at all — with “No Two Persons.” I have a soft spot for the character of Madeline, who suggests it’s not the number of books we read that matter, but the beauty of the search and the power of the ideas we discover.\n\nAt least that’s the message I heard.\n\nBauermeister’s trademark empathy and hope are the heart of “No Two Persons.” On her website, she attests that she writes “about the things we don’t pay attention to — our sense of smell, the food we cook, the houses we live in, the way our filters affect our perceptions of the world. I write about those quiet spaces between words, and all that goes on in them. But most of all, I write about compassion — because that is what teaches us to see everything else.”\n\nReaders have a special opportunity to think about those quiet spaces and books — and the end of summer — with Bauermeister and fellow author David B. Williams on Village Books’ Sept. 12–14 “Books A’Sail” book group at sea aboard the Schooner Zodiac. She’ll also join Williams at the Sept. 14 Chuckanut Radio Hour.

Both have become prevalent in Whatcom County.\n\nQuinones is a former reporter for the Los Angeles Times whose investigative journalism skills shone in his groundbreaking book “Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic,” which won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 2015. In “Dreamland,” he followed the path of black tar heroin from Mexico up the West Coast of the U.S. to the East; and then OxyContin, from Purdue labs on the East Coast and back across the country, overlapping to create a terrible cross-hatch of addiction and death.\n\nIn the years since that book came out, Quinones noticed changes in the way the opioid epidemic was playing out. As word slowly spread around the medical community about the dangers of over-prescribing pain medications and governmental regulations limited supply, people addicted to pain pills transitioned to illegal substances like heroin. Then new drugs emerged, like fentanyl. Synthetic drugs could be made on a massive scale, flooding the market, lowering prices and wreaking havoc on entire communities, the book details.\n\nThe book takes readers into the lives of people involved with and impacted by fentanyl and super-meth. Quinones has extensive contacts in Mexico and across the rural United States and is gifted at getting to the heart of their stories. (Image courtesy of Bloomsbury Publishing)\n\nAccording to Quinones, hyper-potent fentanyl “upended the dope world the way tech disrupted business. No farmland needed — no pesticides, no harvesting, no seasons, no irrigation. It shrank the heroin supply chain.”\n\nQuinones interviewed Drug Enforcement Agency agents, addiction treatment providers, recovering addicts, incarcerated dealers, neuroscientists, family members affected by addicts, pharmacologists, local jail administrators and citizens trying to rebuild their drug-torn communities.\n\nWhile each person’s story is crushing and terrible, not all are bleak. Quinones finds hope in the growing awareness of the way these drugs work and the development of best practices for how to treat addicts and rebuild their lives.\n\nMost inspiring is the coalition of people who recognize that this epidemic affects us all, and to solve it, we all must play a role. All hands are needed in Whatcom County — will you join us?\n\nIf you missed his presentation, you can participate in one of two free community discussions: noon to 1:30 p.m. Monday, Aug. 14, or 5:30–7 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 17 at the Bellingham Public Library Lecture Room.

In the book, 14 artists and more than 100 poets and writers express their devotion to the bioregion through black-and-white illustrations, place-inspired poetry and evocative prose.\n\nWhether you have a longstanding love affair with Cascadia or are new to its charms, this field guide is a fresh and intimate illumination of the extraordinary place we call home.\n\nEditors Elizabeth Bradfield, CMarie Fuhrman and Derek Sheffield describe Cascadia — a unifier defining the Pacific Northwest by watersheds rather than political borders — as stretching from “Alaska’s Prince William Sound through British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon to northern California’s Eel River, and from the Pacific Coast to the Continental Divide in Idaho and Montana.”\n\nIn their introduction, the editors acknowledge that unlike traditional field guides identifying plants and animals by appearance, habitat and behavior, Cascadia Field Guide employs stories, art and poetry to introduce readers to 128 beings (their preferred alternative to species) that live in the 13 bioregions of Cascadia. They capitalize the names of the named beings to highlight their individuality and agency. The result is not a complete taxonomy but a reverent story of connections that create place.\n\nThis is a literary rather than a scientific guide. You might not learn the average life span of a Steller’s Jay, they write, but you might learn how it feels “to have Jay on a branch by your shoulder.”\n\nOne other distinction: Measuring 6 inches wide, 8 1/2 inches tall and 1 inch thick, the 396-page field guide won’t fit in a pocket and it’s most likely too heavy to lug along on a backpacking or kayaking trip. Read it when you’re back from the trail to recall the wonder and to reestablish a connection with place.\n\nThe guide’s stories are inextricably linked — like the natural world they celebrate. For example, in the Tidewater Glacier section, former Washington State Poet Laureate and Bellingham resident Rena Priest celebrates Salmonberry in her poem, “Tour of a Salmonberry.” The closing notes of Priest’s poem (“float above the earth, feel/the sun, and return”) flow seamlessly to a description of the early spring runs of Eulachon (also known as Candlefish, Ooligan, Hooligan and Saak), which is fished for food, for use as a natural preservative, and for its oil, which is fatty enough to serve as a light source.\n\nThe Bull Kelp entry that follows deepens the connection, revealing that the long, hol"
