        "text": "12 Mighty Orphans\n\nMartin Sheen, Luke Wilson, and Robert Duvall star in the true story of a Depression team of orphans overcoming all odds to beat the best Texas high school football teams. If this movie doesn’t make you feel good, that will make me feel very bad.\n\n1917\n\nThe previews promote director Sam Mendes’ James Bond films but this latest seems closer to his American Beauty Oscar winner and his Road to Perdition. Based on a World War One story told to him by his grandfather, the previews say “don’t miss this movie if you care a whit about cinema.\n\n21 Bridges\n\nChadwick Boseman in a cop thriller that looks like his character is interchangeable with hundreds of the same in previous movies. Will Boseman’s abilities transcend what looks like a generic cop role? Probably. Will those of us who look forward to these types of simple good guy bad guy B action movies like it? Definitely.\n\n47 Meters Down: Uncaged\n\nBefore my tweener children’s minds were raped by online gaming, they went to the movies and loved the original. I was happy for them, though I never spent a moment in the theater myself. In the first the young women were stuck in a cage. In this, they are uncaged. I am certain sharks will be trying to eat them. I watched the beginning and end of Crawl. The alligators in that movie chewed a couple of legs and arms, but I missed the middle where they must have eaten someone. I expect if there are three or more swimmers in this, at least one will have to be eaten all the way.\n\n65\n\nExcellent actor Adam Driver in what can only be called a Jurassic Park knock off. Nothing wrong with that. You can never have too many dinosaurs. And the running time. 93 Minutes. Hallelujah! Or would you rather sit through the brutal three hours of Babylon or Tar?\n\n80 for Brady\n\nI am willing to accept Tom Brady as the GOAT. I am glad that Rita Moreno, Sally Field, Lily Tomlin, and Jane Fonda can still find work. I cannot stand face lifts unless required after disfiguring accidents. I will give this movie a try, but hope I do not cringe.\n\nA Haunting in Venice\n\nKenneth Branagh’s latest incarnation of Hercule Poirot murder mystery with Gothic intentions. If it works, it will be a good time for all, with plenty of chills and thrills, and as always a surprise killer.\n\nA Man Called Otto\n\nTom Hanks. Need I say more. This should be a wonderful movie about a cantankerous widower who is overwhelmed by the needy and oh so friendly new neighbors. Hopefully the jokes are funny (I don’t expect original) and adults show up and the movie is a big hit.\n\nA Thousand and One\n\nI don’t know if this is based on a true story about a woman kidnapping her young child in order to save him from the foster care system, but the fact that movies like this are still being made is reason enough to go see the film. Without adult patronage, these challenging and thoughtful movies may become the purview of streaming channels only which would be our loss.\n\nAbout My Father\n\nA famous comedian, who I never heard of because I am of the wrong generation (well excuuuse me) costars with a ubiquitous and in it for the buck Robert DeNiro. I am indifferent.\n\nAcrimony\n\nActually I see this movie advertised as Tyler Perry’s Acrimony. Tyler Perry, like Steven Spielberg, is another machine filmmaker. His Tyler Perry Madea comedies alternating with his genre films show a filmmaker with all the confidence in the world whose audience follows him everywhere. I will give this movie a try though another Fatal Attraction clone is not what I was looking forward to seeing.\n\nAd Astra\n\nBrad Pitt as a conflicted son in outer space. At least that is what it looks like to me from the previews. Does anyone remember George Clooney in outer space in Steven Soderbergh’s Solaris? And wasn’t he Sandra Bullock’s outer space ghost in Gravity? Brad Pitt gets lots of scripts. He picked this film because he looks up to George Clooney and wanted to make his own space movie. I look forward to seeing Ad Astra (dumb title) because Brad Pitt has morphed from pretty boy to powerful actor and producer who involves himself in movies which carry weight (e.g. this summers Tarentino flick Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) and which are entertaining as well.\n\nAddams Family\n\nDoes anybody remember anything anymore? The Addams Family TV show on ABC, which was then the number three network, was revolutionary in its portrayal of a group of oddballs as a normal nuclear family comedy. The Munsters on number one network CBS followed with a boring copycat version with smiley happy caricatures of monsters living at home. Now we have a cartoon rendition of the Addams Family. I am sure my grandkids will love it. But I am positive it will be as plain vanilla in the revolutionary department as The Munsters was back then. Oops – my grandkids were bored.\n\nAddams Family 2\n\nI am confused. Is this a cartoon or live action? And haven’t I seen more than one Addams family movie in my life. But if this is the second I just don’t care. Even the kids all chose Venom 2 over this new Addams Family contrivance. Well tough on them. We are going this weekend and hoping for the best. We went. It is a fun, family film.\n\nAir\n\nBen Affleck does it again. He produces and stars in and directs this perfect human story about Sonny Vaccaro’s and Nike’s impossible struggle to complete a deal with rookie Michael Jordan’s family culminating in Air Jordan becoming the worldwide phenomenon it is today. If interested you should research the careers of Affleck and Warren Beatty. The parallels are striking. Two romantic leads with tabloid headline personal lives whose careers evolve into filmmaking nirvana. Who would have thought in either case? Like The Green Book, Air is special if you can live without or need a respite from Marvel and DC and sequelitis.\n\nAladdin\n\nThis live action remake of the Robin Williams Disney animation treasure is the hit of the early summer. Will Smith takes over the role of the genie and somehow pulls it off. The middle of the movie is pretty boring but the early scenes draw you in to the story, and the last third of the movie is rip roaring fun. Disney deserves alot of credit for remaking, rebooting, and sequeling every classic in their library without cheapening the product (see this summer’s Men in Black: International, Xmen’s Dark Phoenix, Godzilla: King of the Monsters).\n\nAmbulance\n\nA Michael Bay chase movie through the streets of Los Angeles with time outs to make certain the lead police detective’s dog is safe in one of the chase cars. After one hour and eight minutes in our amazing XD Now With AUROMAX Sound theaters, I needed a hearing repair and left for Evander Holyfield’s ear doctor. I am guessing the innocent survivor of the disastrous bank robbery (he didn’t kill anyone) eventually gets to save his sick wife and his “brother,” Jake Gyllenhaal, on his deathbed gets to say “I love you man,” and his “brother,” who has to hate him by now, gets to say “I love you too.” Or something like that.\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nWhen I viewed the trailer, I thought “hysterical comedy.” After the Golden Globes, I realized this is much more than a satire of a serious writer whose fame comes from a made up story about his family. This movie is number one on my list of must see now films about to break out after Academy Award nominations.\n\nAmerican Society of Magical Negroes\n\nI am worried about this one. I have not seen a preview for the film, there is neither a poster on the walls or any buzz flying around the movie hallways. I will check it out and hope for the best.\n\nAmerican Underdog\n\nKurt Warner becomes Super Bowl Champion quaterback for the St. Louis Rams despite a back story that should never have led to greatness. If you have seen Dennis Quaid in The Rookie as a high school baseball coach who ends up pitching against the Yankees in Yankee Stadium, then you know that The Rookie was a heck of a movie. I expect American Underdog to be a heck of a movie also.\n\nAmsterdam\n\nFor the faithful readers of these short missives, I will give you an incomplete and insufficient appraisal of David O Russell’s latest, Amsterdam. Populated with tons of recognizable stars doing their best to transform into something unrecognizable, you come to appreciate all their efforts. The movie itself is only for those of you who can appreciate something very different from drama played straight. This is not that. For me, I am glad I took the time to see it.\n\nAngel Has Fallen\n\nIt would be so easy to just accept this as Gerard Butler B-movie junk. Not me. I have to quibble over everything. Olympus Has Fallen was a solid B action movie. Then there was the despicable London Has Fallen with the scene where Butler wearing wingtips and starting with what looks like a water pistol walks down a street killing fifteen or twenty highly trained assassins with AK 47’s. But that’s not the worst. The evil terrorist and his evil henchman, both out to destroy London, each get to explain in lengthy serious diatribes why their cause is justified. I think I will go to The Peanut Butter Falcon instead of this one.\n\nAngry Birds 2\n\nThis game was all the rage at some point in the past, though I could not tell you why. The first movie went over big with various children in my orbit. This looks like more of the same. Count me in. Naptime for me. Funtime for the kids.\n\nAnna\n\nA real life hot Russian model goes John Wick on a series of professional killers who seem to want to eliminate her. Directed by French director/producer Luc Besson of Fifth Element fame among other cult favorites, this is a B-movie high want to see for me. Besson often attempts to outdo American filmmakers with over the top renditions of gangster and sci-fi movies, and I love him for it.\n\nAnnabelle Comes Home/Child’s Play\n\nI can live without either but don’t begrudge others from being perverted by despicable modern horror. The bloody reboot of Child’s Play is especially awful when considering how the original was as scary as they come without pushing the envelope of inhuman death. And Annabelle Comes Home is simply a money grub continuation of what began seven movies ago as an excellent horror story, The Conjuring.\n\nAnyone But You\n\nAn R-rated romcom whose previews harken back to the days of grown-up fun, the laughs based on traditional we hate each other now we love each other as the plot thickens.\n\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\n\nWhy is everybody down on this movie before it is even playing in movie theaters. The first Aquaman was a big hit. This sequel should be even more popular. Jason Momoa is now a beloved recognizable star. However, I have no idea what I am talking about since I never watched the first one.\n\nArcadian\n\nJust the way I like it. Another I know nothing about it movie. I looked up the stars. Lo and behold, it’s the latest in a long line of Nicolas Cage films made probably on a shoestring budget. I watch them all, mostly in the theaters, but sometimes on streaming if South Point doesn’t play them.\n\nAre You There It’s Me Margaret\n\nA Judy Blume adaptation, my kids passed her books down through years of youthful reading. I do not know this book, but more than likely the plot will relate to the struggles of youth today.\n\nArgylle\n\nAnyone seeing the fantastic in theater preview for this film that doesn’t understand that previews of movies are created by departments that specialize in making mountains out of molehills may be in for a negative surprise. Director Matthew Vaughan has been trying very hard to create another original Kingsman success but his Kingsman sequel and Kingsman prequel each failed. Now with Argylle I fear he may have failed again. Otherwise why allow the previews to be released revealing so many in film surprises. We shall see. I am hoping for the best.\n\nArmy Of The Dead\n\nOut of nowhere comes the pandemic delayed Zach Snyder zombie opus – Las Vegas is the epicenter of the zombie apocalypse and David Bautista has to get inside to pull off a $200 million heist before the government blows our great city to smithereens. Now Playing in XD\n\nArt of Racing in the Rain\n\nNot everybody goes to baseball games. Not everybody goes to concerts. And not everybody goes to the movies. But if you invite your Mom to the World Series in your hometown, she might go. Or if you invite your Dad to Barbara Streisand’s final tour, he might go. I realize this has nothing to do with The Art of Racing in the Rain. Though if your parents are not moviegoers, there is no chance they will go with you to see The Art of Racing in the Rain. This is a minor Disney movie possibly starring Patrick Dempsey as a race car driver who crashes in the rain. Maybe not. Oops. I stopped in and the human lead is not played by Patrick Dempsey but by a younger handsome guy. And the movie is a talking dog movie voiced by Kevin Costner. People coming out seemed to have enjoyed it.\n\nArthur the King\n\nMark Wahlberg maybe does it again. He finds real life stories from around the world and patches together movies that offend no one. This is not an easy thing to do nowadays. Including a dog, the actual star of the movie, makes the movie all the more endearing.\n\nAsteroid City\n\nAuteur filmmaker Wes Anderson seems to have created a unique and possibly self indulgent hit for summer moviegoers thirsting for something other than family flicks and special effects blockbusters. As usual everyone wants to work with Wes and you will see them all throughout the film.\n\nAvatar Re-release\n\nWhen viewed as an exciting and original B action movie, you have to love Avatar. This re-release is all about getting fans revved up for the December 13 opening of James Cameron’s sequel The Way of Water.\n\nAvatar: The Way Of Water\n\nJames Cameron foisting his imagination and technological brilliance on an unsuspecting audience even though the movie is an avatar. For example, in avatar the way of water Cameron is using both high definition 48 frames per second but also includes standard 24 frames per second for scenes in which he believes technology will take away from intimacy, or so I assume. Somehow he is saying that he has made the look compatible by running the standard 24FPS doubled up. Don’t ask me, and we shall see. Anyway of course all moviegoers must see this movie or theaters will go out of business. In fact I personally cannot wait.\n\nAvenger: Endgame\n\nThis is it. After Endgame the Avengers as a team are no more. (Though I doubt that future generations of fans will be deprived of reteamings.) This movie is an example of Made in America know how. Other countries try, but none have ever figured out how to duplicate the international appeal of our blockbusters. It is not spoiling the movie to say there is lots of talk that is only important to fervent fans; they want every last morsel of Avengers lore to be rehashed. But as in all great Hollywood three hour epics, the concluding battle and bittersweet endgames leave you more than satisfied. Like I remember Ben Hur and Godfather and Dances With Wolves, this generation will remember Titanic and Endgame and who knows what is next. I believe that December’s Star Wars 9 finale needs to be a three hour epic or it will be less than it should be.\n\nBabylon\n\nAn artiste directs a superstar actor and an up-and-coming superstar actress, both acting their back sides off. This is a very special roaring 20s Hollywood expose that turns away audiences on purpose. The less said the better or I might accidentally create an interest in this mistake. I was looking forward to this film and now I’m struggling to get through the entire film wary of what may come next.\n\nBack to Black\n\nAmy Winehouse film biography. Seems to concern itself with her love life as much as her music. She reminds me of Janis Joplin. Music biographies have been a staple of Hollywood since sound was added to silent film (The Jazz Singer). My favorites – Sid and Nancy, Walk the Line, The Doors, Immortal Beloved, Straight Out of Compton. Too many to name. Hopefully Back to Black will join my list.\n\nBad Boys For Life\n\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence are back in this third and final (?) action cop buddy flick. This is entertainment which will live or die based on word of mouth. The opening weekend audience, much like that for Marvel movies, etc, will make this a hit or a miss. I am going to say big hit.\n\nBarbie\n\nThis is not the Barbie and Ken that you will recognize in the performances of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and the script and direction by avant garde artist Greta Gerwig. Along with Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 and Oppenheimer, this will be a heck of a weekend at the movies.\n\nBatman\n\nThe Batman – Why not call it A Batman? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. The previews are dark. Pattinson/Batman is brooding. The film looks like it fits in right after Joaquin Phoenix’s The Joker. (Or was it A Joker?). I go out of my way to limit review reading until after seeing a movie. But quick glances at early reviews seem to mention length and rating (3 hours, PG 13) as if the job of the modern critic is to warn you away from long movies and infer that a film’s rating is significant. Does anyone believe there won’t be a Director’s Cut R-Rated version coming to HBO Max in time for this year’s Holiday shopping?\n\nBeau is Afraid\n\nJoaquin Phoenix does it again – driving us crazy with an insane and totally off the rails unique film. Watch it at your peril.\n\nBeautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nTom Hanks as Mister Rodgers. Need I say more. I don’t think so.\n\nBig George Foreman Miraculous Story\n\nSports films have a muddled success rate and this latest is another question mark. Foreman’s fall from the heights and comeback through prayer is a story deserving of your attention. But are you interested? We will find out this weekend.\n\nBlack Adam\n\nThe Rock as comic book antihero Black Adam. I watched only the first 35 minutes before I had to leave and didn’t really know what was going on. Afterwards I did learn by looking it up that 2800 BCE means Before Common Era. A very interesting tidbit. The movie seems like a perfectly pleasant kids movie with the types of ultraviolence that put Clockwork Orange to shame, but The Rock is terrific as always.\n\nBlack and Blue\n\nI love the previews. Black female police officer sees corrupt cops joining inner city gangsters in murdering someone. She videos it and has to get it out to the public before every criminal and corrupt cop in the city gets to her first (there is a bounty on her head). If this doesn’t turn out to be the best B action movie in a long time, I will eat bacon. Aha. I was right. Great B action movie. No bacon for me.\n\nBlack Christmas\n\nDo I care? No. Horror movies built around holidays are and have always been tried and true templates for scaring their yearning for thrills audiences. I am not opposed to these movies, but I have lost my interest in celluloid horror. Try this one if you like and join the young who will be flocking like hungry birds to theaters Friday nights.\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nI went into the XD theater for the first Thursday preview showing. The theater was packed. I sat in the second row way up front. The first two rows recline all the way back. The previews all knocked me out, especially a new John Wick opening in March. At some point during the previews I fell asleep. I woke up during a ferocious battle scene. I quietly left the theater. I will be back.\n\nBlack Widow\n\nI like Scarlett Johansson’s action movies, especially Lucy, but trapped in the Marvel universe she is more a comic book star than a movie star. Now with her standalone Black Widow coming out, she has the chance to prove she is the best of the bunch. The previews look very good with both large and small scenes, action and humor, life and death. Definitely this is a movie you want to see in theaters, especially on premium screens like in our two Cinemark South Point XD theaters.\n\nBlacklight\n\nLiam Neeson is at it again, this time it seems to be his granddaughter that has been taken. I would like to see Neeson and Mel Gibson team up for one of these sparse action films. That would be fun.\n\nBlinded by the Light\n\nThe recent British low key hit Yesterday about a singer’s love of the Beatles is followed now by this English ode to Bruce Springsteen, “Based on a True Story.” I liked Yesterday very much and hope these filmmakers do as well with Blinded by the Light.\n\nBlonde\n\nWord has it that this latest Marilyn Monroe biopic is not for the unadventurous. I mean to adventure into the movie this weekend, and who knows? I haven’t even watched the trailer.\n\nBlue Beetle\n\nWho wants to write negative things about a film, which looks like it is making an honest effort to fuse family with superhero? Shazam’s best parts are with family, and I get a similar vibe from Blue Beetle previews. Hoping for the best.\n\nBombshell\n\nCharlize Theron, Nikole Kidman, and Margot Robbie portray the real life Megan Kelly and Getchen Carlson, while Margot Robbie’s character is made up, which I consider cheating especially since this fictitious victim seems the least able to fight back, therefore becoming the most compelling story of the three. Though there is nothing big screen about three terrific actresses playing beautiful intelligent blondes chased by a sweaty powerful old man who controls their livelihoods and our political destinies, I am glad to see it in a movie theater which is always preferable to watching at home in the family room with non-stop distractions.\n\nBoogeyman\n\nI am already scared dealing with the nut cases running around my house. Bogeyman is using Stephen King’s name all over the advertising, so I guess the story will be worthy.\n\nBoogie\n\nAn Asian-American basketball player deals with racist opponents and handles it successfully, I think. No way it can compare with White Men Can’t Jump. And please explain why sports movies always open around the same time as major sports events. Do I really want to watch a basketball movie just when March Madness is heating up?\n\nBook Club\n\nCounterprogramming at it’s finest. Welcome faces for the older crowd, Keaton, Bergen, Fonda, and Steenburgen up against the violent scatological hero Deadpool. Personally I am waiting most of all for Action Point, Johnny Knoxville rebooting his Jackass films but surrounding the stunts with a real movie plot about competing amusement parks.\n\nBook club The Next Chapter\n\nJane Fonda is back again. Like a bad penny, she keeps coming back again and again and again. And she always gets her man. She would be better off playing Dianne Feinstein.\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nBetter known as Borat 2, if you walked out of the first Borat, then be aware this mockumentary is more of the same. Sacha Baron Cohen’s films often display flashes of brilliance. There are plenty of moments in this, but you need to accept the horrors of the bad ones. The Rudy Giuliani scene is the calling card of Borat 2, but there is more than that single addition to the film than this sad, sad yet illuminating reveal.\n\nBoss Baby: Family Business\n\nYou can never have too many Boss Bay movies. Or can you? We shall see.\n\nBottoms\n\nGay high school girls start a fight club to attract hot cheerleaders, in a raunchy, anything goes comedy. Obviously not for everyone, but I will need to see it before I tip the scales one way or another. From the preview I can say give it a try, but it’s your call.\n\nBrian Banks\n\nFootball season is upon us and here we have the true story of a high school football player destined for the NFL who is falsely accused of rape and imprisoned for many years. Upon his release after the victim recants and the evidence proves his innocence, Brian Banks is given a tryout with the Atlanta Falcons. This is Brian’s story.\n\nBrightburn\n\nThe reviews I glanced at gave me the impression that this was a special low budget entry in the young director sweepstakes. Creating a cheap horror film that garners critical praise is one of the fastest ways for directors to get their wings and fly into the stratosphere of big budget, star driven moviemaking. Brightburn is David Yarovesky’s best chance at climbing the ladder. The movie is better than its ilk but not good enough in my opinion to send David to the moon. I will watch his 2014 directorial debut The Hive. If it is interesting, I will keep an eye out for his third chance if he gets one.\n\nBroken Hearts Gallery\n\nI wish it was Sleepless in Seattle or You’ve Got Mail. But alas. In the old days after two hours you still don’t see the romantic comedy lovers in bed. In these modern romantic comedies, everyone is in bed all the time.\n\nBullet Train\n\nI have to say the last thirty minutes of mayhem make up for the first 90 minutes of death and disaster. If you can’t find something else you want to attend and wanton destruction is your cup of tea, you will not be disappointed. Let’s put it this way. We have had two buy out screenings by Division 1 college football teams and they each won their next games.\n\nCabrini\n\nThe most recent faith based story of a wonderful person doing good for the multitudes who ends up a Saint. (I still believe that Zefferelli’s Brother Sun, Sister Moon is the best of that genre).The running time of over two hours worries me, and my first choice of current faith based movies would be Ordinary Angels which fascinates me because of the lead character played by Amazon streaming’s Jack Reacher.\n\nCall Jane\n\nAnother preview of an independent, non-formulaic movie where Elizabeth Banks needs an abortion to survive and Sigourney Weaver helps her decide what to do. Small movies with challenging themes can make a difference in viewers thought processes. Pros and cons aside, this movie seems valuable.\n\nCall of the Wild\n\nJack London’s wonderful novel following the life of Buck (the dog) from privileged lounging to sickening abuse to Alaska and freedom. What an incredible story. Harrison Ford is the grizzled Alaska explorer who brings out the best in Buck. This should be a fabulous family film for all ages.\n\nCamp Hideout\n\nIf you have had enough of taking the kids and sitting through big budget, animation movies all summer, then this looks like a welcome change of pace – A PG story film about a boy in trouble hiding out in a summer camp. I can only hope that kids get to see a real, old fashion, family film. They are almost extinct.\n\nCaptain Phillips\n\nCaptain Phillips is another recent intelligent entertainment. Especially because the movie is based on a true story which you probably watched on the news, the accuracy of various incidents can interfere with the intensity of the viewing experience. But if you just go with the flow, questions of plot and character delay until afterwards at which time you can visit the internet and find out that even the participants in the ordeal do not agree on what happened.\n\nCard Counter\n\nPaul Schrader’s newest exploration of a solitary lone figure looks to be a perfect movie for adult audiences willing to be challenged, not coddled. Schrader’s last film, First Reformed, with a stunning Ethan Hawke performance, gave new life to Schrader’s moribund career. This latest introspection will make it two in a row worth your time and money.\n\nCarlos\n\nA 90 minute documentary on Carlos Santana. You can never go wrong watching a documentary with clips of anyone in the arts or the public eye that shows early footage because it’s fun to watch. I do believe that Carlos has said some very ugly things about various groups. However by now we all know we have to accept that our favorites have feet of clay.\n\nCats\n\n“Memory” or is it “Memories?” That is the question. Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageously bad reviews and still go to see Cats, or to take arms against that which draws one near to this troubled creation. Though I say yea, thy wretched masses may say nay.\n\nChampions\n\nWoody Harrelson in a Bad News Bears lookalike with special kids trying to play basketball instead of baseball. Written and directed by one of the Farrelly Brothers, this may not be the young kids movie you might expect. The movie probably pushes the envelope of its PG 13 rating. But personally I cannot wait to see it with the grandkids.\n\nChaos Walking\n\nIt seems to be an A-List movie with recognizable faces (Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland), big budget pretensions, and based on a popular series of young adult books (that description always freaks me out because I know the books would never interest me). Anyway we get to see a world without women (Daisy Ridley?) where everyone can hear everyone else’s thoughts. OK. I am somewhat intrigued and will give it a try since it is in our premium reclining seat XD theater.\n\nCharlie’s Angels\n\nEven though I didn’t watch the TV show, I always thought the concept was a great one. And I still do. Kristen Stewart leads the trio through their paces, while comedic actress Elizabeth Banks directs this latest version. I believe Banks will turn out to have created a super fun movie for the masses. I hope so.\n\nChevalier\n\nAn exhilarating tour de force concerning a based on a true story maestro on his way to becoming another Beethoven who’s meteoric rise results in destruction at the hands of a racist aristocrat and a rebirth in revolution against Marie Antoinette and her court.\n\nChosen Season 3: Episodes 1&2\n\nPlease don’t ask me. I have no idea. This is so weird. If Chosen Season 3 means something to you, then see it in a movie theater. You will be pleasantly surprised and want more of your favorite streaming series to stop in theaters first.\n\nChristmas Chronicles 2\n\nThe first was a Netflix holiday treat starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. This Netflix sequel brings them back, this time to theaters before moving to Netflix very soon.\n\nCity of Lies\n\nJohnny Depp and Forest Whitaker together in this search for truth. The Notorious B.I.G. is dead. What happened? Please forget all the off-screen drama trailing Johnny Depp. This beat and battered older version of the former superstar, just like Kevin Costner, can still act.\n\nCivil War\n\nThis is a major film by the Director of Ex Machina and other films that are both exciting and stimulating. I am guessing a Democrat is president, and Republicans start a Civil War, and all hell and worse breaks loose. Maybe the opposite. Even if both of these plots that I’ve made up are wrong, you can count on action in the movie and arguments after you’ve seen the movie.\n\nClifford The Big Red Dog\n\nI took the grandkids. I did not fall asleep. A good time was had by all.\n\nCome Play\n\nAnother “horror” movie. Seems these low budget attempts are the only films getting released to theaters nowadays. Which is ironic since low budget horror went straight to video pre-pandemic. And the Mulans and Scooby Doos and Sponge Bob movies opened in movie theaters. That seems so long ago. Anyway this is about an autistic boy whose monster in the phone wants to be with him. Sounds like a straight to video movie to me. But who knows. You have to see the picture before you have the right to speak up.\n\nCountdown\n\nI haven’t seen a preview and remember a Robert Altman directed Countdown starring James Caan and Robert Duvall in outer space. I would like to see that one again. But give me a moment while I watch the preview for this Countdown on my computer. OK. Nothing to see here. A generic plot about a woman who finds out she has only three days to get out of dying in a low budget horror film. I will give it a peek but only because I can walk in free.\n\nCourier\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch, an English actor who always outperforms, does it again in this based on a true story spy drama. A meek salesman who is chosen by MI6 for his innocence transforms before our eyes with the help of his handler. We learn that the Cold War may have become hotter without their work.\n\nCrawl\n\nI was momentarily excited until Crawl landed without buzz. Sometimes, especially with horror films, you have to trust the buzz. Horror fans are not easily fooled. Meanwhile Rex Reed, the once famous film critic who slept in the nude (you can look it up), came out of his crypt to call Crawl the best horror movie of the year. Hahahahaha.\n\nCreed 3\n\nOh my gosh! Kang aka Jonathan Majors takes on boyhood friend Adonis Creed in a Rocky Battle of the Century. I cannot believe how brilliant a move opening this movie right after Jonathan Majors introduction as Marvel Universe arch villain Kang in the latest recently opened Ant Man 3. And now Kang will destroy the boxing world and pulverize Creed. Only kidding. No chance of that happening. I predict this will be the best mainstream movie of the year so far unless Man Called Otto or 80 for Brady are more up your alley.\n\nCrisis\n\nWhere do these movies come from? Have you ever heard of this one before? Not I. But this is a crime thriller that I want to see. Set during the opioid epidemic that no longer takes center stage, Crisis tells three stories and hopefully tells them well.\n\nCroods: A New Age\n\nI remember taking the grandkids to the first one and having a very enjoyable time. Covid 19 keeps me from taking them to this sequel. That is very sad. They miss going to these family flicks. And I miss the naps.\n\nCrowds Have Not Returned\n\nFootball stadiums are packed. Soccer stadiums are packed. Guns and Roses concerts are packed. So where are the movie crowds? Even the Marvel crowds for Black Widow and Shang Chi were less than sold out. The independent films like Card Counter and The Eyes of Tammy Faye which pre-pandemic would have drawn core movie-goers are without buzz. Word of mouth has disappeared as if customers are embarrassed to admit they went to the movies. Musicals like In the Heights and Dear Evan Hansen fail to meet projections. Each of these six movies I have mentioned have cinematic value. But the future of movies in theaters is hard to predict, though I believe the crowds will come back eventually.\n\nCruella\n\nWhat the heck is this? It definitely does not remind me of either the animated or live action Disney renditions of 101 Dalmations. I do like Emma Stone, and she always spreads her wings, but no way this is for kids. Right off the bat two hours and fourteen minutes is overlong in anything but epics, which I prefer at three hours. I will be holding the grandkids out of this and streaming for them instead the 1933 double feature King Kong and Son of Kong with all you can eat popcorn, ice cream and Takis. Total bill $2.99 for Kong, $1.99 for Son of Kong, $6.98 two bags of Taki’s, $4 two four packs of unpopped popcorn (one butter and one kettle), $3.99 box of 12 chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches, and the bathroom is 20 feet from the TV.\n\nCurrent Wars: Director’s Cut\n\nI have been waiting for this for years. The movie about Tesla vs Edison and direct current vs alternate current as the standard for street lights is a story worth learning. After I see this, I will delve more deeply into the back story of this film which has been in Harvey Weinstein purgatory since he was arrested and outed as a pig.\n\nCyrano\n\nThe classic story of the less than handsome man writing beautiful letters for his friend to the woman of both their dreams, and the letters win her over for the less than adequate, all brawn but no brains, nice guy but the wrong guy. Will she find out and love the less than adequate in the looks and body department actual writer of the letters. Who knows except everyone who has ever read the book or seen the plays or the movies (Roxanne/Steve Martin among others). I think you should give this a try. By the way it’s an adaptation of a Broadway musical starring Peter Dinklage.\n\nDaddy’s Home 2\n\nI hope this is as funny as the first, or at least as funny as Thor: Ragnarok. Just like A Bad Mom’s Christmas introduces the Grandmothers, Daddy’s Home 2 introduces the Grandfathers (Mel Gibson and John Lithgow). Bad Mom’s Christmas is not as funny as the first, and I don’t expect Daddy’s Home 2 to be as funny as the first. I am especially concerned because the previews show just too may funny moments. Many times that means that is all the funny stuff that is in the entire movie.\n\nDark Phoenix\n\nThis is another X-Men prequel. Any X-Men movie without Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is a lower case x-men. I want this movie to be good, but I have the Godzilla blues and worry I am in for another less than happy two hours.\n\nDark Waters\n\nMark Ruffalo as a conflicted corporate lawyer caught up in a DuPont toxic chemicals killing local animals and people cover up. The story looks real and probably is since the previews name DuPont specifically as the villain. Considering that Dupont has since merged with Dow of Agent Orange fame, it is pretty obvious who I will be rooting for in this film.\n\nDC League of super pets\n\nLast chance to party with the grandchildren Unwelcome school begins any day now Super heroes have super hero pets and here we go Minions was still the best family film of this summer but I would probably put this second ahead of light year.\n\nDeadpool 2\n\nI didn’t understand why Deadpool, the original, became such a huge hit except that super-heroes were getting boring, and Deadpool is the ultimate super anti-hero. Deadpool 2 will probably be bigger but maybe not better. Let’s wait and see. The Deadpool break from the all too common super hero template is warranted and welcome.\n\nDeath on the Nile\n\nThe latest Agatha Christie adaptation with gobs of medium to big names led by Kenneth Branagh and Gal Gadot. I am still looking most forward to Robert Pattison Batman performance which should give a run for the money up against Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker performance. Dark and darker.\n\nDemon Slayer\n\nThe world famous Japanese anime continuing the popular TV series watched by more people than you could ever imagine. If you every wanted to know how anime and manga attracts so many of our children, you might want to check this out. Stick with the subtitled version as that is what the fans always recommend.\n\nDJANGO UNCHAINED VS. LINCOLN\n\nA surface view would lead you to honor Spielberg’s “Lincoln” over Tarentino’s “Django Unchained.” Spielberg’s civilized view of our government righting the wrong of slavery through mostly civil discourse is a history lesson worth learning. But the single moment of Civil War carnage is not enough to propel the movie forward. A battle scene of Saving Private Ryan intensity would have made Lincoln epic.\n\nMeanwhile Tarentino’s Spaghetti Western take on slavery follows in the footsteps of his “Ingenious Bastards.” But instead of Jews wiping out the Nazi hierarchy and ending World War 2 in one select blow, slavery in the person of Jamie Foxx destroys the archetypal plantation owner played ever so evilly by Leonardo DiCaprio, along with killing every other white man within gun range.\n\nBoth Lincoln and Django Unchained are excellent. Each present the abomination of slavery in their own way. But Django Unchained is the more important film. While Lincoln tells the important story of the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by the House of Representatives, Django Unchained’s apocalyptic vision of Hell on Earth provides an osmotic understanding that slavery was a horror that needed to end.\n\nDoctor Sleep\n\nThirty nine years later we have the sequel to Stephen King’s least favorite adaptation The Shining. I would rather watch The Shining in the movie theater, than Doctor Sleep. I hope I am wrong and The Sleep Doctor keeps me awake.\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\n\nDirector Sam Raimi of the successful cult series Evil Dead and the original Spider-Man trilogy is back with this second Dr. Strange Marvel madness. Benedict Cumberbatch, like the serious actors Robert Downey, Christian Bale, Joaquin Phoenix, and Robert Pattinson, brings to his super hero performance a depth of character not seen in the spoof performances like those of Ben Affleck, George Clooney, Val Kilmer, and Seth Rogen (Green Hornet – Please don’t remind me). Bottom line – this is a well directed and well acted super hero movie that requires your viewing in premium large screen presentation theaters.\n\nDon’t Let Go\n\nA low budget B science fiction movie: I want to see it. In fact I want to see lots of movies. But I am overwhelmed by waiting in line for Popeye’s chicken sandwiches (thank goodness they have run out of them); reading old Joseph Heller books that I find at thrift stores (Good as Gold is Catch 22 like but oh so Jewish); binge-watching the latest breathlessly recommended Netflix/HBO/Amazon Prime series (it seems like there is a new one everyday – I am still trying to catch up on The Sopranos): in other words where once upon a time an afternoon spent with a cheap cop/sci-fi flick would be an afternoon well spent, now it is an imposition while the walls of the world are closing in tighter and tighter.\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nThis is a Netflix movie theater exclusive release after which it will show up on your TV screen. Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep. That’s pushing 100 million in talent costs alone. However I just watched on Netflix Jane Campion’s Power of the Dog with Benedict Cumberbatch as a 1920’s Montana rancher. Now that is one heck of a movie. Easy to recommend.\n\nDon’t Worry Darling\n\nOlivia Wilde’s controversial new film which seems to be all about Harry Styles spitting on Chris Pine and Shia LeBeouf getting fired in order to keep Florence Pugh from quitting the movie. The preview makes the film seem like a Stepford Wives offshoot but I assume it is much deeper than that enjoyable contrivance.\n\nDoolittle\n\nWhat were they thinking? Robert Downey reprising the Doctor Doolittle role as played by Rex Harrison, thus his strange United Kingdom accent. $170 million spent on making the movie. Why? The well regarded writer-director of drug dealing films Syriana and Traffic hired to create this film. Weird. The movie playing on premium higher admission screens. It’s a kid’s movie, not a super hero movie. I didn’t sit through Cats either the play or the movie. I didn’t sit through the first Doctor Doolittle because my girlfriend at the time wanted out halfway through it. I will have to sit through this one since I like the reclining seats in our XD theater, and so do my grandkids.\n\nDora and the Lost City of Gold\n\nI wish it was a cartoon and not live action with real actors. My grandkids currently from three through nine prefer animation. Animation tells children that this movie has been made for them. Though there are many many exceptions, live action often lets them down. Next week is Angry Birds 2. Now that’s a sure thing no matter how bad it actually turns out to be. Anyway, if you don’t take your family to the movies, you are making a mistake. Start them out young. Make it fun. They will grow up with one more outlet than they would have had otherwise.\n\nDownhill\n\nWill Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in an American remake of a popular Swedish black comedy about a husband who runs from an avalanche leaving his family behind. I want to see it though these remakes of foreign film successes don’t often capture the essence of the originals.\n\nDownton Abbey\n\nThis beloved English series shown in the United States on Public Television is now a movie. About the inner workings of a British castle and its occupants, those who loved the television show will be out in force. Think about it this way. When The Sopranos movie is released, millions of fans of the TV series will line up. Same for Downton Abbey. Even if you didn’t watch the show because you thought it was too stuffy or are one of the many who never watch public television, a visit to this film might awaken your interest in more of the same.\n\nDragon Ball Z Super: Super Hero\n\nI am not in love with Dragon Ball Z or with the title of this movie, but I will admit that the grandkids enjoyed the movie very much. For some reason the Cinemark South Point during its second week is playing it six times dubbed and one show sun-titled. That is strange.\n\nDream Scenario\n\nYou cannot keep a good Man down. The ubiquitous Nicolas Cage playing a mild matter professor is turning up in everybody’s dreams. That is weird. Just like Nicolas Cage. And check out the recent Retirement Plan, Nicolas Cage having fun in an action comedy that works very well for movie audiences.\n\nDrive Away Dolls\n\nBrother Ethan Coen of the well respected Coen brothers team, writers and directors both, from the preview seems to have gone back in time trying to re-create the films that he and his brother made at the beginning. Whether this succeeds or not, there is the Thomas Wolfe book that says quite succinctly. “You can’t go home again.”\n\nDrive My Car\n\nPlaying as part of our Oscar Best Picture nominees series, this Japanese film concerning the will to live after tragedy is an adaptation of a Haruki Murakami short story. If seeing this movie sends readers to Murikami’s short story collection Men Without Women, it will have been a success.\n\nDumb Money\n\nThis should be a good one cataloging the months and memes that lead to young amateur investors winning and losing tens of millions of dollars while the wise guys on Wall Street lost billions. The focus is on the Game Stop hysteria.\n\nDune\n\nYes, I like the original David Lynch adaptation which Lynch disavowed and had his name removed from most but not all versions. And I like this much better Part One adaptation, though I like the inferior wild and crazy Lynch version more. I always watch epic releases in all the formats and theater sizes. For the first time since Avatar, I prefer XD 3D for a movie. But alas, Eternals has taken over both XD screens and moved Dune into the excellent but not XD presentation theaters. However, if you want to see this movie, see it in the best theater you can find, but don’t expect your HBO Max presentation to even come close to the epic proportions seen in a movie theater.\n\nDune: Part Two\n\nThis is a tough one. The great David Lynch filmed the original Dune in 1984. For many that first version is an embarrassment. I would not go that far though I do not object to viewers who feel that way. Personally I think Ethan Cohn’s solo effort Drive Away Dolls is the real embarrassment. Anyway Dune: Part One was good enough to deserve a Part Two (although the 1984 Dune, less than two hours long and covering the entire classic novel explained the backstory in a much simpler fashion.) But I am not complaining. Just wanted to mention that I am personally caught up in movie lengths as the two and a half hour plus movie run times are not yet part of my DNA.\n\nElvis\n\nAuteur director Baz Luhrmann of Romeo and Juliet and the Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge fame turns his unique talents to the story of Elvis, played by an unknown. The unnecessary hook seems to be the immediately unrecognizable Tom Hanks portraying Elvis discoverer and less than scrupulous manager Colonel Tom Parker as an enlightened human being. Now don’t forget I have only seen the trailers and could be totally wrong. But my own understanding of the Colonel was he cared only for himself and the money. And the money went down the drain at the roulette tables of the once upon a time Las Vegas Hilton.\n\nEmma\n\nA new version of the classic Jane Austen Emma. It looks like this will be a lot of fun with the filmmaker loosening up the British strait laced performances of the past. We are lucky that the money men still find it in them to bankroll these movies that thrill women first and foremost.\n\nEmpire Of Light\n\nA new film from Sam Mendes, auteur Director of American beauty, Road to perdition, Jarhead, and various James Bond films. This latest seems to be in the tradition of films about movie theaters (Cinema Paradiso). Definitely worth a look and see in my opinion.\n\nEmpty Man\n\nA title that lends itself to way too many jokes. I saw the headline of a review that said “Fills Emptiness With Boredom.” Another headline – Empty Man Won’t Fill Empty Theaters.” Headline writers can be mean. Anyway, I am not going even though this horror (film) is opening in our XD theater. What a sad state of affairs.\n\nEncanto\n\nThis Hispanic storyline Disney feature animation reminds me of the one with the kid and grandma and supernatural occurences that the grandkids watch all the time. And they want to see this one as well. See you at the movies.\n\nEqualizer 3\n\nThe TV show was excellent and a cult hit. The movies with Denzel Washington are more traditional shoot em ups. Everyone is dead except Denzel. With the TV show there was plot and psychology and powerless victims and anonymity. The first movie version tried to get it. The second was pretty much generic stupidity. I am going opening day and, as always, hoping for the best.\n\nEscape Plan\n\nStallone and Schwarzenegger’s Escape Plan is the ultimate test of going with the flow. Trapped in a ferocious prison without any possibility of escape, Arnold and Sly are tasked with escaping. Though you will have to see the movie to find out the result of their escape attempt, I can tell you that the movie is just good enough to allow you to suspend your disbelief and accept the impossibility of the entire situation.\n\nEscape Room: Tournament of Champions\n\nOnce upon a time there was a movie about employees trapped in a basement having to kill each other and get to the top to be the sole survivor. Was that the first Escape Room? Maybe. Obviously there have been previous iterations since these are the champions. I have no interest.\n\nEternals\n\nWhat is an Eternal besides a Marvel entity ready to expand the Marvel Universe? Eternal means forever. Does this mean the Eternals live forever? If that is the case, they should all watch the Sean Connery movie Zardoz. The Eternals in that movie do not fare so well. Having enjoyed the recent Dune epic, I root for this Marvel epic to reach the same heights.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\n\nBest Picture Oscar Winner 2023. Congratulations. Personal taste will determine your satisfaction quotient. And your mood also. This movie is not for everyone, but I am glad it succeeded.\n\nExpendables 4\n\nAnyway you look at it, Sylvester Stallone is a movie beast. Starting with the Rocky franchise and moving into the Rambo franchise, and now the Expendables franchise, action fans have gotten their moneys worth for his entire career. If you haven’t seen any of the Expendables one two or three, I assume you’re not interested. But if you are an action fan, you should give it a try. It is first on my list for this weeks movie going.\n\nEzra\n\nIn what is called a dramedy (drama and comedy), Bobby Carnavale (Joe DiMaggio in my favorite film “Blonde”), kidnaps his autistic son and I guess that it is Katie bar the door time. Sight is a warm and hopeful film. This should be more of the same. And don’t forget.Summer Camp. All three movies will play just as well on home screens. Hopefully theaters win out.\n\nF9\n\nFast and Furious fans – have you had enough yet? Isn’t a Ludacris driven hot rod propelled into space and coupling with the Space Station more than enough? Do not take the kids. You may be picked up for child abuse. Only kidding.\n\nFall Guy\n\nRyan Gosling recently of Barbie, and Emily Blunt recently of Oppenheimer A very nice pairing with explosive chemistry. The previews are precious; a stuntman and a film Director making a super action movie while being chased by gangsters. Very nice.\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\n\nJohnny Depp is Grindelwald. That probably works since Johnny Depp creeps people out since we have found him to be another victim of Hollywood profligacy. My Master’s thesis was on separating the public promotion from critical views of art. However that was in 1972 when such a thing was possible. Now promotion and art are so intertwined, I give up. This is the second in a new series pre-dating what takes place in the Harry Potter series. At least the author is living and writing these new stories.\n\nFantasy Island\n\nThis is not your parent’s Fantasy Island. This movie is a modern sadistic horror film reboot.\n\nFarewell\n\nI have been looking forward to this movie for awhile now. A Chinese American woman with her family returns to China to say goodbye to the dying family matriarch. Under the guise of a wedding they visit, keeping the matriarch’s coming death from her. This is the Chinese way. There is a classic Chinese novel about ancient China, Dream of the Red Chamber. This is my opportunity to ask book readers to check it out after you see The Farewell which will whet your appetite for more things Chinese than going out to eat.\n\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw\n\nThe Rock and Jason Statham. I am always a sucker for movies with co-stars of equal stature. Dicaprio and Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Redford and Newman in The Sting. Wayne and Clift in Red River. Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca. Poitier and Curtis in The Defiant Ones. Steiger and Poitier in In the Heat of the Night. Grant and Bergman in Notorious. Streep and Eastwood in Bridges of Madison County. Hoffman and McQueen in Papillon. I expect I will enjoy Statham and The Rock going at it, each trying to top the other despite their limited acting skills. Star power times two is often twice as good.\n\nFast X\n\nFor those who keep asking, X stands for the number 10, we are just not used to movies continuing through nine sequels and using the X Roman numeral. Do you have to see more than the trailers? Maybe not, but those action scenes are American made, no one does it better.\n\nFatale\n\nThis B movie version of Fatal Attraction looks like it is right on the money. Hilary Swank is always at the top of her game. If not for Covid pretty much killing all movies at theaters but especially these hidden low budget gems, this would be worth a trip to see it in theaters. But not many will venture out with everything streaming over you worse than standing under Niagra Falls.\n\nFather\n\nAnthony Hopkins plays the father. Do I need to know anything more? No previews playing here. I haven’t seen anything on TV. No posters arrived. But when I saw that this movie was coming out, it went right to the top of the list of my want-to-sees. Anthony Hopkins performances are always worth the price of admission.\n\nFerrari\n\nDirector Michael Mann chooses American actor Adam Driver to portray Enzo Ferrari whose Italian autos of the same name, are still considered the best of the best. Recently seen briefly in Ford versus Ferrari, the story of Enzo has all the makings of a good film. However the choice of Adam Driver to play Ferrari sends up red flags.\n\nFord V Ferrari\n\nMatt Damon as master car designer Carroll Shelby. Christian Bale as master test car race driver Ken Miles. Just watch the online preview of this true story of the 1966 LeMans battle between Ford and Ferrari designed, built, and driven machines. After watching you will know definitively how much you want to see this film. I believe you will want to see it very much.\n\nForever Purge\n\nNooooooo. Anyway this is what happens when you defund the police. The world goes wild and only the strong survive. A perfect Independence Day weekend movie if you consider a film of murder, mayhem, and anarchy the way to spend celebrating America.\n\nFrank and Penelope\n\nI love when we open a low budget action thriller while every other local theater takes a pass. So what looks like a throwback to old time drive-in flicks, this written, directed and starring the Boondocks Saints Sean Patrick Flanery, also co-stars the always interesting Kevin Dillion and a strip show cutie with a heart of gold. This movie is right up my alley.\n\nFreaky\n\nA “satirical” slasher horror comedy with The Butcher played by Vince Vaughan trading places with a bullied high school female. An over the top Vaughan in female dress will probably attract a decent crowd then really gain followers when it moves to streaming TV.\n\nFree Guy\n\nRyan Reynolds repeating his Deadpool schtick and probably wooing his fans in spite of his current Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard displaying even more of the same. I probably will enjoy this in our XD theater. I sit in one of the first two rows right in front of the screen because the seats only in those two rows recline further back than anywhere else in the theater. If I get a good nap, I know that the movie is weak.\n\nFreelance\n\nNo doubt in my mind that John Cena will unanimously win the raspberry award of 2023 for worst actor in a motion picture. Playing a disillusioned, former special ops soldier, he is enlisted to protect a female journalist getting an exclusive interview with a South American dictator. Everything spirals out of control and this comedy pseudo-drama, including Cena’s awful and pseudo comedic facial expressions (which if he’d used those on his army ventures he would have been left out of the service. I highly recommend this movie.\n\nFrozen 2\n\nOK. Disney is the unquestioned worldwide master of family classics. Every one of their efforts are miles apart from everyone else, even when their efforts are less than great. Without Disney movies America would be a different place. Just imagine if Max Fleischer with his Betty Boop starring cartoons had pushed Walt Disney’s Mickey Mouse aside. But of course that did not happen because America is Mickey Mouse, and the fringe is Betty Boop.\n\nFrozen/Elf/Grinch\n\nThese three are this week’s Comeback Classics. Three dollars for kids and seniors. $5 for everybody else. Comeback Classics are a great way to dip your toes in returning to the movies. The theaters aren’t very crowded, and the investment is very slim. If you are ready, these familiar but enjoyable movies might make for a welcome return to theaters experience.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\n\nDirector, George Miller has made a series of five sensational action films. The original, Mad Max with Mel Gibson at his best, small, but intriguing, set you up for Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, Miller’s first shock to the system. Beyond Thunderdome is less than the best but includes Gibson’s final Max performance. Then comes the Charlize Theron Fury Road sensation followed now by Furiosa about a young woman with big blue eyes out for revenge. And there is more to come. A future film is already on the drawing board.\n\nGemini Man\n\nIn this movie super spy Will Smith battles a super spy de-aged Will Smith. How do I feel about de-aging? In real life it would be nice. In movies it is ridiculous. Director Ang Lee uses de-aging in this movie, and Martin Scorcese uses de-aging in his upcoming Irishman opus. When great directors go all out with these new technological innovations, you can be sure everyone will be sure to follow. FIRE THE MAKEUP ARTISTS! No more Oscars for Edith Head. By the way de-aging is a new word meaning Will Smith and Robert DeNiro can play themselves as young men even though we have seen in recent movies that they are very old.\n\nGentlemen\n\nMadonna ex-husband Guy Ritchie (I just had to say that) returns to the gangster genre where he began his career with Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Matthew McConaughey stars in this drug trade extravaganza which should be fun to watch.\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife\n\nAn old-fashioned story film with modern special effects. These new small town child Ghostbusters rise to the challenge and win the day with the help of the ever-pleasing Paul Rudd. This is a very nice family film with a well written storyline and well developed characters, but without the party pop of the first Ghostbusters. No loss as this film stands on its own.\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire\n\nI am worried about this latest Ghostbusters melange. I have seen the previews many times and I am fearful that there will be the sight of innocent victims impaled by frozen spikes coming out of the ground. Maybe not. Bringing back all the Ghostbusters of the past makes me feel like a spectator at a baseball old timer’s game; these guys used to be great. This is a must for those of us who have lived with the Ghostbusters for so many years, but I doubt that the younger generation will see the humor.\n\nGirl in the Spider’s Web\n\nI very much enjoyed The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. In fact I read all three books and watched the foreign film versions and the American version. Then suddenly the author died. His estranged family took the notes for the fourth book in the series and hired a writer to write a fourth book and sold the rights to the movies. I am boycotting this movie as this modern trick of eeking out every penny of a dead man’s living works offends me.\n\nGlisten and the Merry Mission\n\nWith a title like this, it must be a Christmas story ( I saw the trailer) about a magic mission in the North Pole. Christmas must be under attack by Jack Skellington.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nThis is a brand new English dubbed Japanese rethinking and tribute to the English dubbed (except for Raymond Burr) 1950s original. Bring the kids.\n\nWrong! This is a terrific, subtitled flick; a great movie with incredible sound design and award worthy effects, with excellent screenwriting, and an unbelievable final battle that dissolves into an unexpected denouement. The premium XD theater presentation for this one is worth every extra penny.\n\nGodzilla vs Kong\n\nForget all the headlines about this movie saving movie going. Focus on the film itself. Did you grow up on Godzilla and Kong? Then you definitely want to go and have a good time, preferably in a premium theater like our two XD auditoriums. Do you have little or no interest in modern versions of the great monsters of the past? Then look for something else.\n\nGodzilla X Kong: The New Empire\n\nAmazingly the young grandkids go for these Legendary Pictures Monsterverse battles of the titans. There is even an Apple TV series first season called Monarch that intelligently brings these same monsters to streaming TV. But I continue to recommend the recent Japanese Academy Award winner for Best Visual Effects with a genuine backstory that equals the battles between post war Japan and the great Godzilla.\n\nGodzilla: King of the Monsters\n\nI did like the previous reboot and looked forward to this one before seeing the latest previews which reminded me of all the unending Transformers battles that ended up wearing me to a frazzle. I like smart talk in combination with bits and pieces of monsters culminating in an imaginative battle that whisks you away – think the original Avengers movie. Maybe I am wrong on this one and it won’t be just a slugfest among the monsters of our youth. We can always hope.\n\nGolda\n\nThe big deal about this film is that Helen Mirren who plays Golda is not Jewish. But I am not worried because she is an excellent actress. This is the story of Golda Meir, first, and only woman, Prime Minister of Israel. The film takes place during the 1973 Yom Kippur war.\n\nGood Boys\n\nI should have paid more attention to the previews. Is this another Superbad? And if you don’t know Superbad, would you have any interest in this? Please hold on while I google and watch the preview. OK. It looks good to me. Another Superbad. Too raunchy for the grandkids, and the older children are stuck in front of their computers, consoles, phones. It seems I will be going alone.\n\nGood Liar\n\nBritish acting icons Helen Mirren and Ian McKellan buddy up in this British suspense thriller about a con man getting overly involved with his mark. This is a movie for adults looking forward to a change of pace from the marketing of super heroes and incessant sequels and remakes. Most interestingly to me will be the music scored by Carter Burwell, the number one music choice of the Coen Brothers.\n\nGran Turismo: Based on a True Story\n\nI believe this is the first time “based on a true story“ has ever been used in a title. Since I believe this is about the video game player who beats out all comers and is now a professional race car driver, I look forward to a documentary on this true story somewhere down the line. But I don’t mind watching the Hollywood version especially in our reclining seat XD premium picture and sound theater.\n\nGravity\n\nGRAVITY in 3D is excellent and enjoyable. Director Alfonso Cuaron creates a three dimensional world in the vacuum of outer space which while watching seems totally believable. Only afterward do you wonder how you could have been hoodwinked into accepting Sandra Bullock as an astronaut hero on a par with the Apollo 13 astronauts.\n\nGreen Knight\n\nI do not remember the Knights of the Round Table having colors, but I forget a lot. Weirdly enough,I want to see this movie more than Jungle Cruise and Stillwater. I know nothing about it. I have no expectations. I am not even certain he is a King Arthur knight. I hope so because I like King Arthur movies.\n\nGretel & Hansel\n\nDefinitely not my cup of tea, but there are two clues that this might be something to check out if you can still get off on horror. First, we have the girl’s name coming first before Hansel. Could this be another kick ass female? I say yes. And there is something attractive watching females taking over the masculine roles. Second, this is another Japanese original remade by Americans. This has been a successful formula in the past, and may succeed here again.\n\nGrinch\n\nThis is not a Jim Carrey live action sequel which would have been fun considering Carrey’s super Grinch-like current public behavior, but instead is a toon made by the best and brightest in the animation field. Of course I fell asleep throughout but did end up spending $52 on stuffed Grinch dolls in the lobby.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy, volume three\n\nI really really enjoyed the first one, sort of like the big budget exhilaration watching the original Iron Man. But here we go again, each characters schtick has become too familiar. The storyline has become too deep. The fun is too little. A disappointment, sort of like woody Allen moving on from the heights of comedy to the depths of movies for critics.\n\nHalloween Ends\n\nThank goodness.\n\nHalloween Kills\n\nJamie Lee Curtis is still chasing the indestructible Halloween boogeyman. I am old enough to have seen the first Halloween in the movie theaters, and it did ruin Halloween for me. (The first Nightmare on Elm Street was even worse because it ruined sleep for me.) I left the Halloween franchise after the first, but returned for Jamie Lee Curtis’ bravura performance in the last one. I am hoping for more of the same in this one. But that may turn out to be the problem, and this may turn out just to be a money grab.\n\nHarley Quinn: Birds of Prey\n\nAfter a disastrous box office opening weekend, the studio changed the title which does not fix the problem. The filmmakers never decided if they were making an R-rated female Deadpool or a more family acceptable PG 13 female Avengers. Too bad because there is a fun movie behind the changing titles.\n\nHarriet\n\nMaybe Harriet Tubman will never get her picture on the $20 bill, but her legend gets the full Hollywood treatment in what looks like a stirring recreation of her battles against slavery and the Underground Railroad. I look forward to this movie as a companion piece to Glory which I still consider the best Civil War movie ever filmed.\n\nHaunted Mansion\n\nI am haunted by another movie based on a theme park ride. A good theme park ride lasts a couple of minutes and you fight the lines for more rides the rest of your life. A theme park ride movie often is too long no matter how short the running time. I do have fond memories of Rollercoaster and Earthquake, and Jungle Cruise reminds me of Bogart and Hepburn in African Queen, but the grandkids will do fine waiting for next week’s Teenage Ninja Turtles ( though the turtles must be middle aged by now).\n\nHere Today\n\nBilly Crystal and Tiffany Haddish together for the first and last time. What can I say? That I am old and cannot sit through these Alzheimer tour de forces by very old actors only means I don’t want to look at myself in the mirror. I walked out during the Bob Costas, Barry Levinson, Sharon Stone, Kevin Kline scene. But I also walked out during Anthony Hopkin’s Best Actor win movie and the wonderful French film Amour. If you want to see what old age is really like, watch these three movies. In fact I did steel myself and finish watching all three and am haunted by them way too often.\n\nHereditary\n\nDebuting at midnight during the Sundance Film Festival, this horror film about a family’s dissolution amid ancestral secrets seems to be 2018’s scariest movie as described by everyone who has already seen it. Toni Collette from Sixth Sense is the tortured Mother.\n\nHis Only Son\n\nThe biblical story of Abraham and his only son Isaac. I hope it is honest and not a melodramatic exaggeration. I feel that I should give it a try.\n\nHitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard\n\nRyan Reynolds and Samuel Washington and Salma Hayek may think we are having fun watching this sequel to The Hitman’s Bodyguard, but we are not. A new record for F-bombs in a single movie along with a lame story line and lots of dead people, this is the type of movie that will live forever on the Netflixes of the world.\n\nHonest Thief\n\nA Liam Neeson action flick, and who really does them better (well obviously Densel Washington). But Denzel appears in A movies, and Liam is a B movie king in short and sweet, keep the action moving, get out of the rain enjoyable experiences. If you need a plot synopsis, you are not the target audience for this movie.\n\nHoney Boy\n\nShia LeBeouf. I think I spelled that correctly. This movie is a well received autobiographical reprise of Shia’s difficult childhood. Shia has had a very difficult time as a star, but seems to be turning things around with his recent modest success and enjoyable film The Peanut Butter Falcon and now hopefully Honey Boy. Joaquin Phoenix and Robert Downey Jr. seemed to have survived similar trials. I wish Mr. LeBeouf the best.\n\nHotel Artemis\n\nJodie Foster as The Nurse in this slightly futuristic actioneer about a hospital for really bad guys. Already chosen as the worst movie of the year by aging New York film critic Rex Reed, that may be all the push I need to put this at the top of my list of must sees.\n\nHouse of Gucci\n\nWhat I can only describe as an operatic treat with over the top performances by Lady Gaga, Al Pacino, Adam Driver, Jared Leto, and everyone else. If you can sit for hours (I recommend our reclining seat XD theaters for this one), these gasbag portrayals of the fashion world create a sort of fun experience for those interested in everything Gucci.\n\nHunger Games: Songbirds and Snakes\n\nI am totally not interested. I miss Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of America’s greatest actors who died from an overdose, cutting short his fabulous career. What a loss.\n\nHustlers\n\nThis movie is hanging on forever and people are still going so if you think the original brief can be of any value, check it out in the archives. The movie is worth seeing if it’s raining and you have nothing else to do.\n\nHypnotic\n\nDirector Robert Rodriguez is my kind of filmmaker, action galore without the big budget. Look him up. If you don’t recognize his movies, skip Hypnotic. This is for his fans only.\n\nI S.S\n\nLooking down at earth from the international space station, the astronauts see a planet, exploding. Simultaneously separate communications arrive from the Russians and the USA to their respective members. “Kill the enemy! World War III has just begun.“ Nice premise. I hope it works.\n\nIf\n\nWhat if “If” is not equal to the weight of its premise, a troubled young girl can see abandoned imaginary friends (IF’s). Watching the various previews, I wondered if the movie might be too precious and not equal the fun factor that Wonka brought at Christmas time. I will take the grandkids and let you know.\n\nIf\n\nThis brief was written by Summer Intern Michael Harris. This seems like a very creative and great children’s movie featuring Ryan Reynolds and Cailey Fleming. I was very excited for its release. I went to the theater and there were only two movies based on nothing but original material. It turned out If wasn’t one of them. Oh well. Maybe this week originality will win out.\n\nImaginary\n\nThis movie is not IF (Imaginary Friends) but Imaginary with a picture of a sullen Teddy Bear on the poster. Please don’t take the kids because this is not a family film. It seems, from the previews, to be a lame, low budget, derivative horror film.\n\nImpractical Jokers: The Movie\n\nObviously this is a bigger budget, big screen exploitation of a cult TV show. I know nothing.\n\nIndiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny\n\nHarrison Ford is an American icon. Still kicking in his 80s, his performance in the western streaming series 1883 pulls you into the screen. I don’t know that this last Indiana Jones will honor him with excellence, but I am hoping for the best.\n\nInfidel\n\nI have seen the trailer online, but not the movie which opens today. I was struck by how much I do not want to see this. Somehow the protagonist ends up on an Iranian prison death row. Based on a true story. Please not another one.\n\nInfinite Storm\n\nAnother in a long line of based on a true story films, Naomi Watts plays the mountain climbing heroine who saves the day when she comes across a doomed young man about to be victimized by an oncoming blizzard. A very uplisting film for adults.\n\nInfinity Pool\n\nIf the name Cronenberg is attached to a movie I no longer look forward to it and sometimes skip it completely. Both father and son take you places you don’t want to go. The son’s Infinity Pool is one of those places. However, like Babylon, as unlikable as the entirety is, I was drawn in by its originality.\n\nInstant Family\n\nMark Wahlberg hits the comedy trifecta with Daddy’s Home (excellent), Daddy’s Home (not as excellent), and now Instant Family. I hope it is funny. Even if it is not, giving out hope is value enough these days.\n\nInvisible Man\n\nI am copying the following from Common Sense Media. “Clever, tense, sci-fi horror remake has blood, gore (sounds like Parasite). For moviegoers who enjoy this genre, go for it, especially see it in our Xtreme Digital luxury reclining seat theater.\n\nIt Lives Inside\n\nI believe I skipped it lives. In fact, I know I skipped it lives, though I am not sure there is such a thing as it lives. Anyway, I am less than interested in this movie. I am overwhelmed by “horror, movies.”\n\nIt: Chapter One/Spider-Man: Far From Home\n\nEach of these two enjoyable movies have returned to theaters for one more bite out of the apple. It: Chapter One is reaching out to grab those who can’t wait seven more days for the release of It: Chapter Two. Spider-Man: Far From Home is being re-released with four minutes of “NEVER BEFORE SEEN” footage. I will not be first in line.\n\nIt: Chapter Two\n\nYes. I remember all the Its starting with the very thick and heavy Stephen King novel. Reading is leisurely. If it takes the whole summer to read a good book, that is so much more time to savor it. Horror movies are different. Short and sweet is best. With exceptions. The Shining (Stephen King novel directed by Stanley Kubrick) is a long movie, and so is the most recent It: Chapter One. So I will not hold the 169 minute running time against It: Chapter Two, though the two hours and forty nine minutes worries me. It makes me think that what we have here is an indulgent filmmaker who loves his images way too much. Even Tarantino’s most recent Charles Manson opus Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is only 160 minutes. (How the heck did I get so hung up on the running time?) I hope It: Chapter Two is good. It is a must see for the many It: Chapter One fans, except when the first of these two It movies came out it was simply titled It. Therefore for the sake of future generations I now pronounce the 2017 It, It: Chapter One.\n\nIt: Chapter Two\n\nThe original brief is in the archives but the movie is playing here once a day at 11AM if you want to check it out.\n\nJackass Forever\n\nNeed I say more. Not about the Jackass continuum of sadistic yet financially rewarding perversity.\n\nJexi\n\nWhat in heck is a Jexi? And who allows these titles which turn off moviegoers who might take a chance otherwise. Would you want to ask your date to go see a movie called Jexi? Going to a movie titled Jexi screams Geek Squad. The Joaquin Phoenix falling in love with Siri Spike Jones movie Her had a title that was intriguing. This Her knockoff called Jexi reminds you why video is so popular today. Cheaper. Original and better versions of current release copycats. And you already have your date getting tipsy at your home.\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4\n\nAbout 10 years ago a 96 minute long, B-action movie, starring Keanu Reeves, John Wick, revitalized Reeves career and lead to today – the release of a two hour and 49 minute extravaganza of death, John Wick Chapter 4. If ever a film was made for the big screen, and I mean XD. IMAX, DFX, Atmos, and the like, this is it. Pay the upcharge and let American Hollywood know-how assault your senses into oblivion. Survival is definitely not guaranteed.\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nI have been attacked for favoring movies like Jojo Rabbit over movies like Doctor Sleep. It’s true. I want to see something new, and the smaller the better. Often these little movies are insanely special though many times they are as bad as the big movies. This week this movie is my number one want to see. The less you know the better.\n\nJoker\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is the latest incarnation of The Joker. His Joker will be closest to that of Heath Ledger if only because Ledger was and Phoenix is actors who push the envelope. I prefer Jack Nicholson’s Joker and Cesar Romero’s TV Joker as they were both great renditions of comic book villains. Ledger was too real for me. And I am positive this new Joker will not be funny. In other words prepare yourself for a performance bathed in sweat.\n\nJournal for Jordan\n\nA second Denzel Washington directed black experience story with Michael B. Jordan. I know nothing about it, but Denzel Washington in front of the camera or behind the camera is a movie I want to see.\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nFor all those of yo who appreciated Spike Lee’s based on a true story Blackklansman, you will be moved by this based on a true story eye opener. Our country has been through decades of trauma beginning with the 1963 JFK assassination and continuing through this year’s Capitol attack. Judas and the Black Messiah recounts another of these traumas.\n\nJudy\n\nRenee Zellweger in a tour de force portrayal of the great Judy Garland. I never loved Zellweger, but she was in some nice movies. She supposedly has a famous new face after surgery. Does that need to be mentioned? I am not certain, but I mention it in case you don’t recognize her and wonder what is going on. A long time ago I was with my Dad keeping score at a Knicks game, then in the second half a player came out in a number that was not in my program. It totally screwed me up. It turns out Walter Dukes sweated through his uniform jersey in the first half and was given a new jersey that didn’t belong to him or anyone else on the team for the second half. We were in the upper deck. Which reminds me. A long time ago I was at an Army Navy game with my Dad. Roger Staubach of Navy vs Rollie Stichweh of Army. There was something written on the back of the Navy jerseys. We were in the upper deck and couldn’t see. The next day reading the newspaper it turns out Navy had written Drive For Five on the backs of their jerseys. Navy had beaten Army four straight. They easily won the fifth in a row. We were rooting for Army.\n\nJules\n\nIt looks like an E.T. for old people like me. If you can remember Cocoon, we can hope for something along those lines. I hope so. Ben Kingsley is a good start.\n\nJumanji: The Next Level\n\nSequels are often bigger and “worser” than their often more modest originals. Hopefully this is not the case with Jumanji. That would be a loss. The comedic chemistry created by both the physical and psychological differences between hulking The Rock and diminutive Kevin Hart is pleasing to watch. You can tell they are having fun and inviting the audience to become part of it.\n\nJungle Cruise\n\nSuperstar The Rock combined with the always wonderful Emily Blunt in a Disney fun ride which seems to be something along the lines of the first of the Brendan Fraser Mummy series. That was good entertainment. I expect the same from this one.\n\nJurassic Park Dominion\n\nWe use to call these kinds of movies “popcorn flicks.” Not anymore. With nachos and Angus hot dogs and Pizza Hut pizzas and bottled water and $15 T-shirts, what the heck. I call them movie money pits that better pan out or else. Thank goodness Jurassic Park Dominion is a crowd pleaser. More than enough living dinosaurs of all varieties populating the Earth to excite the children, and the return of the original cast members to satisfy the adults. This is big budget Hollywood that deserves to be seen in our premium XD theaters if you are looking for the fullest experience.\n\nJust Mercy\n\nMichael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx fight a death penalty case against injustice in a Southern courtroom. I have seen the powerful preview so many times and still have no idea if this ends well or not. And I will not let you know after I see the movie. You can go find out for yourself.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nA Martin Scorcese instant classic. However I read the book. It is a devastating work of non-fiction chronicling a genocide of oil rich American Indians by greedy Oklahoman evil murderers. So there was no mystery to me, and unwilling to endure a second dose of the history, I walked out when I could not take it anymore.\n\nKing Richard\n\nWill Smith as the father of Venus and Serena Williams, two of the greatest tennis players of all time. A wonderfully upbeat film about family and beating impossible odds.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\n\nDuring the Covid quarantines, streaming became a way of passing the time. One of my time consuming choices was watching all the Planet of the Apes movies. The original Planet of the Apes film starring Charlton Heston is classic. I saw it when it came out in the Sixties. We all walked out of the theater in a state of awe. Movies were wonderful back then. They did not require two hours and twenty five minutes to tell their stories. But I will endure the extended time watching this one because I have been looking forward to this latest installment for years. I guarantee it will be good, though likely too long.\n\nKinky Boots\n\nI think I am ezxcited. Not by the kinky boots but because this Cindy Lauper/Harvey Fierstein Broadway success based on the English film of the same name should be lots of fun.\n\nKitchen\n\nMelissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish and Elizabeth Moss as mob wives who move in on the mob. Melissa McCarthy use to be very funny. Recently comedy has not been enough for her. Reminds me of Steve Martin, Jerry Lewis, Bill Murray, Jim Carrey et al. They all felt the need to stretch. Robin Williams pulled it off though his comedy works are still the high points of his career. After Marlon Brando’s Oscar winning performance as the Godfather, someone wrote that Lee J. Cobb could have played the role just as well and without makeup. Maybe yes. Maybe no. Anyway it’s my belief that very funny people should not try to create serious personas for themselves. It’s too late. Stick with comedy or retire from acting and find something else more fulfilling.\n\nKnives Out\n\nDirector Rian Johnson lately of Star Wars The Last Jedi fame but before that the director of very interesting minor movies Brick, Brothers Bloom, and Looper, here he goes after the traditional whodunit with a sterling cast of name actors and what I assume will be the Johnson genre twist. This movie will be a very satisfying experience for those who don’t require computer generated imagery and super hero plots.\n\nKnock at the Cabin\n\nM Night Shyamalan does it again. He creates buzz over his latest low budget creation that brings young people to the movies even though the end result is not what they expected. I prefer the movie experience to the comfort of home, but I will not object if you watch this on the small screen because it’s more about words than images.\n\nKnox Goes Away\n\nDirected and starring Michael Keaton in a small time action picture, this movie is right up my alley. Al Pacino, Marsha Gay Harden, and their ilk capture their small roled quite efficiently, and this little film is definitely a must see for those who like old-fashioned hired killer movies.\n\nKung Fu Panda 4\n\nYes. I am taking the grandkids. The previews remind me of Kung Fu Pandas 1, 2, and 3. I guess that will be good enough for them as long as I break out the big bucks for concessions. If you happen to catch Jack Black promoting his voice role, I warn you his scrubby bearded face and growing belly are a surprise.\n\nLand\n\nRobin Wright directs herself in this self-absorbed reveal of a woman in crisis who moves far far away from the city and family. The mountain vistas are stunning, but the plot meanders like the river below, and the destination is less than you might be hoping for.\n\nLast Christmas\n\nI assume it’s a women’s weepy, though I am often wrong. September Affair starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr is the best of that genre though more up to date moviegoers would probably say Sleepless in Seattle or You’ve Got Mail.\n\nLast Duel\n\n“Based on a true story.” Movies are always promoted that way in the advertising, the previews, the reviews, and all the other pre-release cannon fodder. What is the point? Do moviegoers get excited because a movie is based on a true story? Aren’t the biggest moneymakers every year Marvel movies? Will you want to see this movie more because there was a last duel sometime in French history, and this is the make-believe story of that history? Aren’t almost all of the based on a true story movies filled with all kinds of changes in order to entertain, not enlighten? The Last Duel’s Matt Damon has already admitted that the duel itself was less than exciting, but director Ridley Scott really spiced it up for this based on a true story movie.\n\nLast Full Measure\n\nThe based on the true story of the thirty year battle to posthumously honor with the Congressional Medal of Honor William Pitsenbarger whose Vietnam battle heroism saved many American lives at the cost of his own.\n\nLast Vermeer\n\nThe previews grabbed me with their scrumptious, art film, beauty. This latest based on a true story film seems to be something about a post World War 2 trial having to do with Vermeer paintings stolen by the Nazis. Guy Pearce stars. It might be worth a try.\n\nLate Night\n\nEmma Thompson is terrific as the cold-blooded ice queen losing her grip on her late night hosting gig. Mindy Kaling as the recent diversity hire comedy writer changes everything with her current events wit and sincerity. The plot is so obvious, but the laughs are real, and the backstage views of late night shows seems very real as well. A welcome antidote to summer sequels out now.\n\nLate Night With the Devil\n\nI know enough that I look forward to this low budget late night talk show possession movie, but not enough to recommend it. Since the less I know going into a movie, the better I can enjoy it’s upside, I am avoiding all previews and reviews and keeping my fingers crossed.\n\nLet Him Go\n\nFinally a movie that checks off all the right boxes. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane together – chemistry to the max. A preview that shows off the care given to the making of the movie in writing, acting, directing, and cinematography. A story for everyone about family loss and family love and family war, death and marriage and the theft of a child. And it is playing in our spacious XD theater with over 200 reclining seats and a maximum of 50 people per showtime allowed in the theater with two empty seats between each attending group.\n\nLicorice Pizza\n\nAuteur Paul Michael Anderson does it again, taking an offbeat teenage hormone story and making it even more offbeat with a two scene virtuoso cameo by Bradley Cooper.\n\nLife of the Party\n\nMelissa McCarthy at her vulgar best is always a sight for sore eyes (whatever that phrase is supposed to mean). However Life of the Party is cleaned up losing weight McCarthy in a PG 13 sort of boring comedy that needs another fifty pounds and ten or twenty more swear words.\n\nLighthouse\n\nWhat looks like a two man acting feast, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe go at it in a spooky black and white art film about two historical lighthouse keepers cracking up. Great reviews that I have not read lead me to believe this is a must see for the independent film fan.\n\nLightyear\n\nBeware. This action animation is not about a Buzz Lightyear toy saving the universe while thinking he is not a toy. This is about an animated human being who is not an animated toy, though the film does adequately explains what is going on. So what should I tell the grandkids? They are looking forward to another Toy Story. Grownups really know how to botch things up.\n\nLike A Boss\n\nTiffany Haddish needs a new agent. Or a new financial adviser. Because either her agent is desperate for commissions and books her in any available comedy, or Ms. Haddish is being ripped off by her financial adviser and needs the money to pay bills. I like her and want her to bring joy to her fans, but by the looks of the previews I am not too certain that she should have participated in this project. As almost always I hope I am wrong despite the preview vibes.\n\nLion King\n\nI have previously discussed Disney’s ability to create derivative movies that while not always besting the previous accomplishments, do them justice. In the process moviegoers come in droves and leave satisified. How often can you say that about sequels and reboots and live action remakes of classic animated films (though to call Lion King live action when the entire film is CGI is confusing to me). Without a doubt the CGI is spectacular, and the 3D is not converted but real and almost on a par with Avatar. Some critics are taking potshots at this Lion King because they are egotistical fools. Successful mass entertainment is incredibly difficult. Disney is better at it than all the others combined.\n\nLittle Things\n\nA retro serial killer with a cop on his tail movie starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto competing to see who can chew the most scenery. Even if this movie is bad, it has to be good.\n\nLittle Women\n\nGreta Gerwig, director of Ladybird, is back with her take on Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women. Greta Gerwig and director Noah Baumbach, most recently of Marriage Story fame, (coming to Las Vegas in January) are married and between them make great movies for the independent minded moviegoer. This is just something I have to mention because it is a fact that fascinates me.\n\nLost City\n\nNetflix’s very popular leading lady Sandra Bullock, reminds that she is even more enjoyable on the large screen. Like Uncharted, this is a search for lost treasure movie but with less set piece action scenes and more outrageous comic moments. The stripper, what’s his name, Channing Tatum strips down a tad now and then, with a cameo by a slightly aging, very sexy, previous generation hunk.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding\n\nEvery movie that Kristen Stewart appears in makes me reevaluate her boring performances in the twilight series. Now I believe she did a great job in those films playing a boring young woman and making it seem so natural. In this film, she captures her character so well it will take your breath away. The less said the better. This movie is not for the fainthearted.\n\nLyle, Lyle, Crocodile\n\nAnimated Family Fare. It never hurts to have a family outing to the movies. However I notice my grandkids outings consist of soccer baseball football and basketball practices and games. And their movie viewing is now all about streaming. I don’t like it but understand it is what it is.\n\nM3gan\n\nIt seems that a robot friend (doll) loses control and thereby gains control. It might be an OK flick if well written, and the horror can’t be too bad since it has a PG-13 rating. At least the movie is only 100 minutes which is a relief to those of us who prefer our movies in under two hour doses.\n\nMa\n\nOctavia Spencer’s roles in the likes of The Help and Hidden Figures have brought her acting bonafides to the public’s attention, but if you look at her filmography she works as much as anyone in Hollywood. Therefore her choice of the horror genre for this starring role is not as odd as it seems on first sight. I don’t think I am going to watch it (I just sat through the over-reviewed Brightburn), but I am certain that Ms. Spencer gives 110% which makes the movie worth watching for some.\n\nMachine\n\nAnother popular comedian I don’t know in an action riff on his most popular live comedy riff. I will give it a try and hope for the best.\n\nMagic Mike’s Last Dance\n\nChanning Tatum is a funny guy. I like him in comedies. I liked him in the first Magic Mike, and liked the movie as well. One was enough for me.\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\n\nThough I really don’t remember, I did like the first Maleficent but think Maleficent showed herself to be a decent person willing to sacrifice for the young girl. Did she turn mean again at the end? Is that why she is back to being Mistress of Evil? I guess if you are interested in the answers to these questions, you will line up to see this movie. I hope it is solid. Something about the previews made me think of a World War 2 movie but maybe I am confusing it with the Midway previews.\n\nMany Saints of Newark\n\nIf you watched the Sopranos as I did, then you need to see this film, well done though lacking in Sopranoesque moments. I am troubled by Ray Liotta’s caricature of the big time mobster with the greatest wife who destroys the relationship for no viable reason. It’s just what big-time gangsters do. And young Anthony Soprano is not the star of the movie which is a surprise. The star is an exciting actor I do not know but plays Liotta’s son and slick gangster with real Italian bravado. This is a worthy movie, though not great.\n\nMario Puzo’s The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone\n\nThis is Godfather 3 re-edited by director Francis Ford Coppola. Aficionados of the Godfather Trilogy will be very happy to revisit what has long been properly regarded as the worst of the three. And no amount of reimagining will change that. But since Godfather 1 and 2 are seen by multitudes every year, and no one watches Godfather 3, this might be the time to check it out and see how it has aged.\n\nMarksman\n\nThis is Liam Neeson’s second B movie action pandemic release. Thank goodness for that. This most recent should be of special interest to those of us who watched Tom Hank’s News of the World, Hanks trekking across the Old West with an orphaned little girl in tow. In Marksman Liam Neeson is also traveling across country, he with an orphaned boy. Hanks is terrific in a well considered movie. Meanwhile Neeson is often better than his material. I look forward to enjoying Neeson’s abilities even if his movie is not as interesing as Hank’s.\n\nMarlowe\n\nYeah baby. Liam Neeson takes on the big boys with his 1930’s appearance as iconic private eye Marlowe, made famous by Humphrey Bogart. Directed by English director Neil Jordan, what I expect to see here is a love letter to 1940’s Hollywood film noir.\n\nMarry Me\n\nWhat looks like a really enjoyable romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez and a fish out of water Owen Wilson, this movie is about a spontaneous marriage brought on by social media between a star and a nobody. A perfect choice for Valentines’ Day.\n\nMatrix: Resurrections\n\nA hearty welcome back to the Matrix 18 years later with Keanu Reeves, now of John Wick fame, ready to bring it on. As bad as the movie could possibly be, it has to be a great moment in your Christmas moviegoing history when you sit down in one of .our two reclining seat spectacular presentation XD theaters watching Matrix first, then if you haven’t enjoyed Spider-Man: No Way Home yet, moving to the other XD theater for this second super Holiday movie treat. Enough said.\n\nMean Girls\n\nI Believe that this is based on Tina Fey’s Broadway musical, however, I am confused because in the mini trailers I’ve seen they were no song or dance numbers presented. So it’s not the musical that I thought it was or the musical but they don’t want you to know until you get there. Beats me.\n\nMeg 2: The Trench\n\nHow many times have I watched Meg One? Too many. Even my wife enjoys Jason Stratham and the big mouth fish. But it’s mostly the teenage grandkids who can’t wait. And I don’t want to be a killjoy but sequels are always bigger but not always better.\n\nMemory\n\nLiam Neeson as an assassin with memory loss. Several things come to mind. 1. Christopher Nolan’s early success Memento about a husband with memory loss chasing the killer of his wife. 2. Liam Neeson’s most recent Blacklight less than meets the eye. 3. Pre-pandemic Liam Neeson’s Cold Pursuit – vintage Liam Neeson, therefore lots of fun for action aficianados. 4. Sometime down the road are we going to find out that Neeson has Bruce Willis disease causing writers to stick him with lines he has been repeating for too many years? 5. Liam Neeson has had a fabulous career as an actor (much like Bruce Willis), and I hope he gets better material starting with Memory.\n\nMen in Black: International\n\nLike with most coming soon big time sequels, we have been inundated with Men in Black 4 previews. In these previews Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson and Thor (slim again after his weight gain in Avengers: Endgame) and an unknown to me young fresh female actress all seem to be having a great time together which makes me want to see this movie. However my failing memory reminds me that the previous Men in Black 3 was terrible. I will go but be on my guard against false expectations.\n\nMidnight Sky\n\nA bedraggled George Clooney in one of the freezing poles with a little girl who does not speak interacting with a space ship somewhere far, far away. Clooney seems to be trying to top Brad Pitts inscrutable outer space Ad Astra which was Brad Pitt’s attempt to outdo George Clooney’s Solaris. There was a time pre-pandemic that this would be the movie I would want to see this week. Now I am not so sure\n\nMidsommar\n\nWriter/director Ari Aster is well known for intellectual horror that scares your brain. This latest of his looks like if he pulls it off, it will be his Citizen Kane. Do you want to see it? Depends upon your interest in broad daylight evil. I do not like modern slasher films. However based on Midsommar’s provenance, I look forward to this one and hope the horror is kept to a minimum.\n\nMidway\n\nDirected by Roland Emmerich who was once a highly desired filmmaker (Independence Day, etc), this latest Midway battle recreation is perfectly placed for the upcoming Veteran’s Day and should be considered by all.\n\nMigration\n\nFrom The creators of the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets series, Migration should be this year’s animated holiday treat. Unbranded original family fare have not succeeded at the box office since the pandemic as stay at home, family viewing of movies targeting children that do not originate in previous iterations or known product progenitors are left behind at theaters. Hopefully everyone takes their kids to this one.\n\nMinari\n\nAn Oscar nominee for best picture about a Korean American family living in the Ozarks. I have never seen a preview, but every review of the movie has a headline that screams “Wonderful.”\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru\n\nMinions or Lightyear is the choice. Minions is fun with young kids. Lightyear is fun if you care about Buzz Lightyear as a human being and not a toy. Neither is spectacular, but Minions is full of funny minions and a young Dru. Lightyear gets heavy at times. Take your pick or go to both, but don’t leave the kids at home.\n\nMission Impossible: Dead Recko"
