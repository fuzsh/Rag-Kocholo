        "text": "Tom Cruise is a big deal in Hollywood, having starred in many blockbuster movies. But when it comes to his personal life it has been pretty rocky because the superstar has been married and divorced three times—first to Mimi Rogers (1987-1990), then to Nicole Kidman (1990-2001) and later to Katie Holmes (2006-2012).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter his marriage with Holmes, Cruise seemed to slow down on public romances between 2012 and 2020. But a new report in December 2020 sparked interest in his love life, suggesting he was dating his Mission: Impossible 7 co-star, Hayley Atwell.\n\nBy June 2022, another report claimed they had broken up. In 2023, the 61-year-old was reportedly dating model Elsina Khayrova, and he’s said to be happy with her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Cruise Finds Soulmate After Splitting with Katie Holmes\n\nTom Cruise is currently dating Elsina Khayrova, who’s 25 years younger than him. Although, according to Us Weekly, the Mission: Impossible actor hasn’t dismissed the idea of a fourth marriage.\n\nBut for now, they’re not concerned about the future. They’re happy in London, settled with a wealthy social circle who all think it’s a great match.\n\nThe Hollywood star is “very relaxed and content with his life right now,” the source said, adding that the two can “sit and talk for hours about world affairs, arts and culture, history [and] sports.” The insider further continued:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Tom [has] never ruled out getting married again; it’s just that the circumstances haven’t been right.”\n\nReports: Tom Cruise Reportedly Ends Romance with Elsina Khayrova, Is it True?\n\nA report from The Sun said Tom Cruise has “cooled off” his romance with Elsina Khayrova just two months after they publicly announced their relationship at a party in London’s Grosvenor Square.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs per the same report, despite the breakup, the Syracuse native wants to stay friends with Russian socialite since they live in the same London apartment block. It said:\n\n“To end things on a bad note would have been awkward if they’d bumped into each other in the lift. There are no hard feelings between them and for Tom, their relationship simply ran its course.”\n\nTheir breakup isn’t confirmed, as they both attended a gala for London’s Air Ambulance Charity at Raffles Hotel last week. Although they weren’t photographed together.\n\nCruise is currently busy shooting Mission: Impossible 8 and Top Gun 3 for Paramount."
