        "text": "As one of Hollywood’s hottest leading men, Tom Cruise knows that finding love can be a risky business.\n\nCruise has been married three times: to Mimi Rogers from 1987 to 1990, to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001 and to Katie Holmes from 2006 to 2012. He has also romanced Cher, Heather Locklear and more A-listers.\n\nAs his career continued to skyrocket, Cruise’s splits gained more attention.
