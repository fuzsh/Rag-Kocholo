        "text": "As my review challenge this month, my movie writing cohort Brian G. Felts demanded I watch First Daughter, keeping with our theme of the U.S. Presidency. And that would have been appropriate had the movie used that vehicle to make itself unique, but of course, it did not and simply propelled itself into the outer sanctum of forgettable films.\n\nFirst Daughter follows Samantha Mackenzie, played by Katie Holmes (Batman Begins), having grown up in national politics and four years living in The White House, who is now headed to college in hopes of living a more independent life and feeling more like a normal teenage girl. Of course, with the Secret Service breathing down her neck at every corner, at the order of the President, played by Michael Keaton (Spotlight). She makes friends whom she eventually argues with, she falls for a guy at college who turns out to be an undercover Secret Service agent, but of course he falls for Samantha which is supposed to feel taboo but doesn’t because that’s how fruity this kind of movie is in the first place.\n\nOh man, it’s painful writing about this film already.\n\nHere’s my biggest problem, one of many for this work but this is my biggest, is if you are going to set a film which uses the U.S. Presidency as an impending force on a character like the President’s daughter, there are a TON of issues the filmmakers could address and truly make the thing unique. None of those possibilities happened. Instead, the writers could have lifted the President as her father out of the story and replaced him with a famous rock star, or a famous author, or anyone famous for that matter. This story used its chosen vehicle in no unique or memorable way. Her struggles where not unique to that of someone in the shadow of the U.S. Presidency.\n\nAnother large issue I had with the movie was its total lack of empathy for the viewer. We had absolutely no way to empathize with Samantha or her situation. Unless one has BEEN the first daughter, I don’t think anyone could understand what it is like. What’s more, we hardly get to even know Samantha as her own person. If fact, thinking back, I don’t even think the movie told us what her major was, what she wanted to do with her life. What the fuck did she even want to do? Get liquored up and fuck a bunch of frat guys? Was that her dream? Go to college and get sick, wrong and sideways? Because that’s really all the screenplay inferred.\n\nThis lack of empathy set the entire film up for failure. We don’t care about Samantha wanting her “normal” life. We don’t care about the President pressured by an election year, and in fact, the only information the material gave us indicates President Mackenzie was doing a terrible job in his first term. Why do we even care about him and his inner motivations? We don’t. We don’t care about Samantha. We don’t care about the President. We don’t care about the terrible cookie cutter Secret Service love interest, played by Marc Blucas (We Were Soldiers). Why even keeping watching? Because Brian made me. Fucker.\n\nMy biggest disappointment behind the camera was in Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) as this film’s director. I’m guessing the Academy Award winning actor’s name attached to this project was simply that, to gain the film notoriety rather than use his talents behind the camera. This was the last film he is credited as the director on his resume. Prior to that, he directed Hope Floats and Waiting to Exhale, both of which the strength of those films were in its cast, not directing. So as far as I’m concerned, Whitaker has yet to prove himself in this capacity.\n\nOverall, the film is boring and thoroughly forgettable. There’s no one to care about and therefore I doubt anyone will care about the film itself. I only care about meeting my month’s challenges and thank gawd this one is done and over."
