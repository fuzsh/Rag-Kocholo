        "text": "Channing Tatum's hilarious heist movie 'Logan Lucky' is one of this summer's best — here's what critics are saying\n\nThe INSIDER Summary:\n\n\"Logan Lucky\" is a comedic heist film from the director of the \"Ocean's Trilogy.\"\n\nAdam Driver and Channing Tatum play brothers.\n\nCritics are loving how fun the movie is.\n\n\"Logan Lucky\" hits theaters Friday.\n\nNASCAR heist film \"Logan Lucky\" is one of the best movies of the summer.\n\nDirector Steven Soderbergh, the man behind the glorious \"Ocean's Trilogy\" and \"Magic Mike,\" came out of his feature film retirement to direct a new heist comedy using the Charlotte Motor Speedway as a backdrop.\n\nChanning Tatum, Adam Driver, and Riley Keough play siblings trying to reverse an unlucky \"family curse\" and team up with incarcerated villain Joe Bang, played by Daniel Craig using a hilariously unrecognizable Southern drawl.\n\nThe cast rounds out with Katie Holmes, Sebastian Stan, Hilary Swank, Seth MacFarlane, and Katherine Waterston.\n\nSix NASCAR drivers also make cameos in the film.\n\nWith a run time of about two hours, the movie holds a pretty impressive 93% on Rotten Tomatoes with 41 reviews in. The consensus is that the heist movie is fun and smart, but doesn't overdo the ridiculous aspect of it. Here's what critics love about it.\n\nIt is a combination of a hit story with masterful delivery.\n\n\"Soderbergh — who hasn't been sitting around doing nothing for the past four years, as he directed two seasons of the acclaimed series 'The Knick' — shows here that the melding of mainstream storytelling and artful execution is possible.\"\n\n— Business Insider, Jason Guerrasio\n\nThere is heart behind the characters.\n\n\"Robbing an oval of paved cement in Charlotte isn’t quite as complicated as robbing the Bellagio, and while it’s true that the Logans aren’t running the most sophisticated crew in the world, there’s still not all that much for them to do. As a result, the film becomes as much of a hangout as it is a heist, as Soderbergh’s sedate pacing lets his cast sink their teeth into their characters. He gives each of these actors just enough rope to lasso us in, and every single one of them knows how to wrangle it.\"\n\n— IndieWire, David Ehrlich\n\nIt's just plain fun.\n\n\"Working with a script by first-time writer Rebecca Blunt, Soderbergh has made the sort of breezy, unpretentious, just-for-fun film that scarcely exists anymore, one almost anyone could enjoy. In terms of milieu, it overlaps with the two 'Magic Mike' outings, that being the working-class South (Soderbergh hails from Georgia and Louisiana, it should be remembered), and it gives off the same sort of gently rollicking good-time vibe.\"\n\n— The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy\n\nIt's a familiar movie, but that doesn't ruin the experience.\n\n\"Maybe 'Logan Lucky' is as easy and familiar as it is because, well, even the most curious minds crave a little comforting sameness now and then. Which is exactly what 'Logan Lucky' delivers, an engaging and self-aware retread of past high jinks. Nothing will surprise you, really, or challenge in any way.\"\n\n— Vanity Fair, Richard Lawson\n\nThe story doesn't focus on too much more than it has to.\n\n\"There’s a lot to explain here, with regard to the setting and the mechanics of the caper, but Soderbergh rarely gets bogged down in details and only spells out what he has to. It’s a relief to watch a commercial movie from a director who trusts you to figure out plot points along the way.\n\nFirst-time screenwriter Rebecca Blunt (rumored to be Jules Asner, Soderbergh’s wife) never complicates things past a Robin Hood framing — these folks are stealing from the rich to give to the poor, nothing more...If Soderbergh’s first Ocean’s had a pitch-perfect ensemble cast, this down-home version matches up in every way.\"\n\n— LA Weekly, April Wolfe\n\nCatch the film in theaters on Friday.

But without him, there would be no \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\nDuring his time on the show, James Van Der Beek, who was 20 years old when the show began, shot to stardom. He used his exposure to score starring roles in \"Varsity Blues\" and \"Rules of Attraction.\"\n\nHis crying face will also live forever on the internet.\n\nNOW: He has had a steady career in Hollywood since \"Creek\" ended, with roles on \"Don't Trust the B-- in Apt. 23,\" and \"What Would Diplo Do?\"\n\nThe 44-year-old is is focusing more on comedy now. His role on \"Don't Trust The B-- in Apt. 23\" as a fictionalized version of himself solidified his comedic talent.\n\nNow, Van Der Beek is starring on Viceland's mockumentary series \"What Would Diplo Do?\" as a fictionalized version of EDM DJ/producer Diplo. He even created an entire Twitter dedicated to his version of \"Diplo.\"\n\nHe also recently added his voice to the movement against sexual assault in Hollywood, showing his support for all of the actresses speaking up and admitting that he has \"had my a-- grabbed by older, powerful men\" on Twitter.\n\nTHEN: Katie Holmes stole both the audience and characters' hearts in her role as Joey Potter.\n\nWho Joey should have ended up with is still a sensitive subject for a lot of \"Dawson's Creek\" fans.\n\nHolmes, only 19 when the show premiered, became very famous very quickly — her marriage and divorce to Tom Cruise was the subject of every tabloid cover for years.\n\nEven though most people know Holmes' relationship with Cruise, before that she was engaged to\"American Pie\" actor Chris Klein.\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider\n\n↧\n\nTom Cruise reportedly didn't care about his relationship with Katie Holmes: 'I never saw any level of intimacy'\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise were married from 2006 to 2012.\n\nThey weren't intimate with each other, according to a former member of Cruise's security team within the Church of Scientology.\n\nAfter Nicole Kidman divorced Cruise in 2001, the Church reportedly tried to find him another wife.\n\nDuring his relationship with Holmes, Cruise spent little time with her or his three children, according to the former security official.\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise had a famous and much talked about romance. From the unforgettable moment when Cruise jumped on Oprah's couch to profess his love to all the shocking claims that have been reported about their marriage since, the former couple continue to fascinate.\n\nBut according to Brendan Tighe, a former member of Tom Cruise's security unit within the Church of Scientology, the pair did not seem close to one another throughout their marriage from 2006 to 2012.\n\n\"I never saw any level of intimacy,\" Tighe told the Australian magazine New Idea. \"Only when they were going to the gym and the Fourth of July fireworks display in 2007 — which was also his birthday — and she presented him with a motorbike.\"\n\nDuring his relationship with Holmes, Tighe says Cruise hardly paid attention to her or their children — Suri, his biological child with Holmes, and Isabella and Connor, who he adopted with Kidman.\n\n\"Most of the time, Katie looked like a deer in the headlights, like she was being dragged around and having a hard time keeping up with him. Cruise is on the go all the time,\" Tighe told The Daily Mail. \"I never saw him with his kids, apart from one time in 2007 when it was his birthday.\"\n\nTighe was a Scientologist for 30 years, but left the church in 2011 after conflicts with higher command, he told The Daily Mail.\n\nIn response to questions from INSIDER, Karin Pouw, the head of public relations at the Church of Scientology, dismissed Tighe as a disgruntled ex-Scientologist but didn't deny any of his specific claims.\n\n\"False tabloid stories like the ones you are asking about can always be sourced to the same discredited ex-Scientologists — a small group of expelled members with sordid pasts looking to make money by spreading lies,\" she said. \"And that of course includes Brendan Tinghe.\"\n\nAccording to Tighe, the relationship between Cruise and Holmes was strange from the start. The Church of Scientology, where Cruise is one of the most powerful figures, reportedly struggled to find a partner with the right image for him after he divorced Nicole Kidman in 2001. The search was a priority for David Miscavige, the longtime head of the church, according to Tighe.\n\n\"They were looking at Hollywood stars, Tommy was getting grilled on them: Who didn't have a porn past? Who hadn't done nude scene in movies? Who hadn't a major drug history?\" Tighe told The Daily Mail. \"So many prospects had done something wrong, like sex movies that had been leaked; it was impossible to find someone qualified.\"\n\nTighe said the church considered Scarlett Johansson, as the friend of Scientology member Erika Christensen. According to Tighe, the church judged her on Scientology's \"tone scale,\" which supposedly measures emotion.\n\n\"Scarlett was 1.1 on the tone scale, which meant covert hostility, it's considered the worst on the backstabbing scale,\" Tighe said.\n\nThe reported meetings between Johansson and Cruise were also around the time they considered working together.

But sometimes, this ease is due to genuine, real-life emotion shining through.\n\nPlenty of actors fall in love off screen as their characters fall in love on screen, which often adds an extra layer of pain when they break up (for fans, anyway). These 13 couples boast iconic, timeless, fictional love stories — but weren't able to make it work in real life.\n\nGabriella Montez and Troy Bolton were the power couple in all three \"High School Musical\" movies.\n\nTroy and Gabriella are your average high school sweethearts: they bonded through spontaneous karaoke, weathered a brief summer breakup, and ended up attending college exactly 32.7 miles apart.

The show went on to last for nine seasons before ending in 2014. Not all fans were pleased with the way the series concluded — but one thing that can be agreed on is that there were plenty of notable guest stars.\n\nPop singers like Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, and Katy Perry all made appearances on the show, while well-known TV actors such as Bryan Cranston to Laura Prepon also paid Ted and his friends a visit in New York City.\n\nHere are 50 celebrities you may have forgotten once guest-starred on \"HIMYM.\"\n\nJoe Manganiello had a recurring role as Brad, one of Marshall's friends from law school.\n\nBrad and Marshall became closer after their girlfriends broke up with them.

Ex-Scientology member and King of Queens actress Leah Remini, 48, says this is the reason why Katie has kept quiet about the religion for so long. Leah, who has been very outspoken about her time with the church since she defected in 2013, opened up about this in her LaPalme magazine cover story. She claimed any statements from Katie could result in losing custody of her daughter, according to Us Weekly. While she didn’t go into detail on how, the accusation is definitely troubling.\n\n“I keep wondering — why haven’t Katie Holmes or Nicole Kidman spoken out?” Leah said. “I assume they were forced to sign prohibitive documents. Trust me, Katie’s not allowed to have a meal with me and we used to be close friends. She could lose custody of Suri. It’s quite sick, really.” Leah has previously called herself an SP, or Suppressive Person, which meant members of the church were not supposed to speak with her. She has also given Nicole the same title, claiming that this is the reason why her two adopted children with Tom Cruise, Connor and Isabella, are no longer in contact with the actress.\n\nKatie was granted primary custody of Suri when she divorced Tom in 2012, and their daughter reportedly hasn’t seen her father in over four years. But with these statements from Leah, it sounds like their split may have come with some caveats.\n\nIn response to Leah’s interview, the Church of Scientology’s spokesperson Karin Pouw told the outlet, “While we would prefer to ignore yet another of Leah Remini’s over-the-top rants aimed at getting attention, she unfortunately continues to incite waves of anti-religious hate crimes. Ms. Remini’s incessant hate speech has required increased security and law enforcement resources spent to protect lives she puts at risk. Ms. Remini’s ridiculous rants are unending and the myths and tales she and her coproducer spread are grown more bizarre by the day. They hire producers to rehash tired, preposterous myths invented and spread by the same handful of former Scientologists motivated by greed and anger.”\n\nLeah’s show, Scientology and the Aftermath, started its third season in August. In addition to exposing Scientology’s practices on this show, the former member has also opened up in a memoir — Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology — which was published in 2015.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nNOW WATCH: What activated charcoal actually does to your body\n\n↧\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise were together for almost a decade — here's a timeline of their relationship\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise were once one of Hollywood's most iconic couples.
