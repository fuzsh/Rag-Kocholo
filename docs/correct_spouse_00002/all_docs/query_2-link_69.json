        "meta_description": "Abstract. We use satellite methane observations from the\nTropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), for May 2018 to February 2020,\nto quantify methane emissions from individual oil and natural gas (O/G)\nbasins in the US and Canada using a high-resolution (â¼25âkm)\natmospheric inverse analysis. Our satellite-derived emission estimates show\ngood consistency with in situ field measurements (R=0.96) in 14Â O/G basins distributed across the US and Canada. Aggregating our results to the\nnational scale, we obtain O/G-related methane emission estimates of\n12.6Â±2.1âTgâaâ1 for the US and 2.2Â±0.6âTgâaâ1 for\nCanada, 80â% and 40â%, respectively, higher than the national inventories reported to the United Nations. About 70â% of the discrepancy in the US Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) inventory can be attributed to five O/G basins, the Permian, Haynesville, Anadarko, Eagle Ford, and Barnett basins, which in total account for 40â% of US emissions. We show more generally that our TROPOMI inversion framework can\nquantify methane emissions exceeding 0.2â0.5âTgâaâ1 from individual O/G\nbasins, thus providing an effective tool for monitoring methane emissions\nfrom large O/G basins globally.",

Jacob, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Alba Lorente, Zichong Chen, Xiao Lu, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Margaux Winter, Shuang Ma, A. Anthony Bloom, John R. Worden, Robert N. Stavins, and Cynthia A. Randles\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5069–5091, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5069-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5069-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify 2019 methane emissions in the contiguous US (CONUS) at a ≈ 25 km × 25 km resolution using satellite methane observations. We find a 13 % upward correction to the 2023 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (GHGI) for 2019, with large corrections to individual states, urban areas, and landfills. This may present a challenge for US climate policies and goals, many of which target significant reductions in methane emissions.\n\nContinuous weekly monitoring of methane emissions from the Permian Basin by inversion of TROPOMI satellite observations\n\nDaniel J. Varon, Daniel J. Jacob, Benjamin Hmiel, Ritesh Gautam, David R. Lyon, Mark Omara, Melissa Sulprizio, Lu Shen, Drew Pendergrass, Hannah Nesser, Zhen Qu, Zachary R. Barkley, Natasha L. Miles, Scott J. Richardson, Kenneth J. Davis, Sudhanshu Pandey, Xiao Lu, Alba Lorente, Tobias Borsdorff, Joannes D. Maasakkers, and Ilse Aben\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7503–7520, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7503-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7503-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use TROPOMI satellite observations to quantify weekly methane emissions from the US Permian oil and gas basin from May 2018 to October 2020. We find that Permian emissions are highly variable, with diverse economic and activity drivers. The most important drivers during our study period were new well development and natural gas price. Permian methane intensity averaged 4.6 % and decreased by 1 % per year.\n\nSatellite quantification of methane emissions and oilâgas methane intensities from individual countries in the Middle East and North Africa: implications for climate action\n\nZichong Chen, Daniel J. Jacob, Ritesh Gautam, Mark Omara, Robert N. Stavins, Robert C. Stowe, Hannah Nesser, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Alba Lorente, Daniel J. Varon, Xiao Lu, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Drew C. Pendergrass, and Sarah Hancock\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5945–5967, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5945-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5945-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify methane emissions from individual countries in the Middle East and North Africa by inverse analysis of 2019 TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane. We show that the ability to simply relate oil/gas emissions to activity metrics is compromised by stochastic nature of local infrastructure and management practices. We find that the industry target for oil/gas methane intensity is achievable through associated gas capture, modern infrastructure, and centralized operations.\n\nMethane emissions from China: a high-resolution inversion of TROPOMI satellite observations\n\nZichong Chen, Daniel J. Jacob, Hannah Nesser, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Alba Lorente, Daniel J. Varon, Xiao Lu, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Elise Penn, and Xueying Yu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 10809–10826, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10809-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10809-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify methane emissions in China and contributions from different sectors by inverse analysis of 2019 TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane. We find that anthropogenic methane emissions for China are underestimated in the national inventory. Our estimate of emissions indicates a small life-cycle loss rate, implying net climate benefits from the current coal-to-gas energy transition in China. However, this small loss rate can be misleading given China's high gas imports.\n\nIntegrated Methane Inversion (IMI 1.0): a user-friendly, cloud-based facility for inferring high-resolution methane emissions from TROPOMI satellite observations\n\nDaniel J. Varon, Daniel J. Jacob, Melissa Sulprizio, Lucas A. Estrada, William B. Downs, Lu Shen, Sarah E. Hancock, Hannah Nesser, Zhen Qu, Elise Penn, Zichong Chen, Xiao Lu, Alba Lorente, Ashutosh Tewari, and Cynthia A. Randles\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 5787–5805, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5787-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5787-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReducing atmospheric methane emissions is critical to slow near-term climate change. Globally surveying satellite instruments like the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) have unique capabilities for monitoring atmospheric methane around the world. Here we present a user-friendly cloud-computing tool that enables researchers and stakeholders to quantify methane emissions across user-selected regions of interest using TROPOMI satellite observations.\n\nA machine-learning-guided adaptive algorithm to reduce the computational cost of integrating kinetics in global atmospheric chemistry models: application to GEOS-Chem versions 12.0.0 and 12.9.1\n\nLu Shen, Daniel J. Jacob, Mauricio Santillana, Kelvin Bates, Jiawei Zhuang, and Wei Chen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 1677–1687, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1677-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1677-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe high computational cost of chemical integration is a long-standing limitation in global atmospheric chemistry models. Here we present an adaptive and efficient algorithm that can reduce the computational time of atmospheric chemistry by 50 % and maintain the error below 2 % for important species, inspired by machine learning clustering techniques and traditional asymptotic analysis ideas.\n\nMethane emissions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico: evaluation of national methane emission inventories and 2010â2017 sectoral trends by inverse analysis of in situ (GLOBALVIEWplus CH4 ObsPack) and satellite (GOSAT) atmospheric observations\n\nXiao Lu, Daniel J. Jacob, Haolin Wang, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Yuzhong Zhang, Tia R. Scarpelli, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Hannah Nesser, A. Anthony Bloom, Shuang Ma, John R. Worden, Shaojia Fan, Robert J. Parker, Hartmut Boesch, Ritesh Gautam, Deborah Gordon, Michael D. Moran, Frances Reuland, Claudia A. Octaviano Villasana, and Arlyn Andrews\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 395–418, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-395-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-395-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate methane emissions and trends for 2010–2017 in the gridded national emission inventories for the United States, Canada, and Mexico by inversion of in situ and satellite methane observations. We find that anthropogenic methane emissions for all three countries are underestimated in the national inventories, largely driven by oil emissions. Anthropogenic methane emissions in the US peak in 2014, in contrast to the report of a steadily decreasing trend over 2010–2017 from the US EPA.\n\nImpacts of emission changes in China from 2010 to 2017 on domestic and intercontinental air quality and health effect\n\nYuqiang Zhang, Drew Shindell, Karl Seltzer, Lu Shen, Jean-Francois Lamarque, Qiang Zhang, Bo Zheng, Jia Xing, Zhe Jiang, and Lei Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16051–16065, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16051-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16051-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we use a global chemical transport model to simulate the effects on global air quality and human health due to emission changes in China from 2010 to 2017. By performing sensitivity analysis, we found that the air pollution control policies not only decrease the air pollutant concentration but also bring significant co-benefits in air quality to downwind regions. The benefits for the improved air pollution are dominated by PM2.5.\n\nGlobal distribution of methane emissions: a comparative inverse analysis of observations from the TROPOMI and GOSAT satellite instruments\n\nZhen Qu, Daniel J. Jacob, Lu Shen, Xiao Lu, Yuzhong Zhang, Tia R. Scarpelli, Hannah Nesser, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Joannes D. Maasakkers, A. Anthony Bloom, John R. Worden, Robert J. Parker, and Alba L. Delgado\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 14159–14175, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14159-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14159-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe recent launch of TROPOMI offers an unprecedented opportunity to quantify the methane budget from a top-down perspective. We use TROPOMI and the more mature GOSAT methane observations to estimate methane emissions and get consistent global budgets. However, TROPOMI shows biases over regions where surface albedo is small and provides less information for the coarse-resolution inversion due to the larger error correlations and spatial variations in the number of observations.\n\nAssessment of strict autumn-winter emission controls on air quality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region\n\nGongda Lu, Eloise A. Marais, Tuan V. Vu, Jingsha Xu, Zongbo Shi, James D. Lee, Qiang Zhang, Lu Shen, Gan Luo, and Fangqun Yu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-428,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-428, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmission controls were imposed in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei in northern China in autumn-winter 2017. We find that regional PM2.5 targets (15 % decrease relative to previous year) were exceeded. Our analysis shows that decline in precursor emissions only leads to less than half (43 %) the improved air quality. Most of the change (57 %) is due to interannual variability in meteorology. Stricter emission controls may be necessary in years with unfavourable meteorology.\n\nConcurrent variation in oil and gas methane emissions and oil price during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDavid R. Lyon, Benjamin Hmiel, Ritesh Gautam, Mark Omara, Katherine A. Roberts, Zachary R. Barkley, Kenneth J. Davis, Natasha L. Miles, Vanessa C. Monteiro, Scott J. Richardson, Stephen Conley, Mackenzie L. Smith, Daniel J. Jacob, Lu Shen, Daniel J. Varon, Aijun Deng, Xander Rudelis, Nikhil Sharma, Kyle T. Story, Adam R. Brandt, Mary Kang, Eric A. Kort, Anthony J. Marchese, and Steven P. Hamburg\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 6605–6626, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-6605-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-6605-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Permian Basin (USA) is the worldâs largest oil field. We use tower- and aircraft-based approaches to measure how methane emissions in the Permian Basin changed throughout 2020. In early 2020, 3.3 % of the regionâs gas was emitted; then in spring 2020, the loss rate temporarily dropped to 1.9 % as oil price crashed. We find this short-term reduction to be a result of reduced well development, less gas flaring, and fewer abnormal events despite minimal reductions in oil and gas production.\n\nGlobal methane budget and trend, 2010â2017: complementarity of inverse analyses using in situ (GLOBALVIEWplus CH4 ObsPack) and satellite (GOSAT) observations\n\nXiao Lu, Daniel J. Jacob, Yuzhong Zhang, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Tia R. Scarpelli, Hannah Nesser, Robert M. Yantosca, Jianxiong Sheng, Arlyn Andrews, Robert J. Parker, Hartmut Boesch, A. Anthony Bloom, and Shuang Ma\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 4637–4657, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4637-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4637-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use an analytical solution to the Bayesian inverse problem to quantitatively compare and combine the information from satellite and in situ observations, and to estimate global methane budget and their trends over the 2010–2017 period. We find that satellite and in situ observations are to a large extent complementary in the inversion for estimating global methane budget, and reveal consistent corrections of regional anthropogenic and wetland methane emissions relative to the prior inventory.\n\nAttribution of the accelerating increase in atmospheric methane during 2010â2018 by inverse analysis of GOSAT observations\n\nYuzhong Zhang, Daniel J. Jacob, Xiao Lu, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Tia R. Scarpelli, Jian-Xiong Sheng, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Jinfeng Chang, A. Anthony Bloom, Shuang Ma, John Worden, Robert J. Parker, and Hartmut Boesch\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 3643–3666, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3643-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3643-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use 2010–2018 satellite observations of atmospheric methane to interpret the factors controlling atmospheric methane and its accelerating increase during the period. The 2010–2018 increase in global methane emissions is driven by tropical and boreal wetlands and tropical livestock (South Asia, Africa, Brazil), with an insignificant positive trend in emissions from the fossil fuel sector. The peak methane growth rates in 2014–2015 are also contributed by low OH and high fire emissions.\n\nGlobal modeling of heterogeneous hydroxymethanesulfonate chemistry\n\nShaojie Song, Tao Ma, Yuzhong Zhang, Lu Shen, Pengfei Liu, Ke Li, Shixian Zhai, Haotian Zheng, Meng Gao, Jonathan M. Moch, Fengkui Duan, Kebin He, and Michael B. McElroy\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 457–481, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-457-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-457-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulate the atmospheric chemical processes of an important sulfur-containing organic aerosol species, which is produced by the reaction between sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde. We can predict its distribution on a global scale. We find it is particularly rich in East Asia. This aerosol species is more abundant in the colder season partly because of weaker sunlight.\n\nIncreases in surface ozone pollution in China from 2013 to 2019: anthropogenic and meteorological influences\n\nKe Li, Daniel J. Jacob, Lu Shen, Xiao Lu, Isabelle De Smedt, and Hong Liao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 11423–11433, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11423-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11423-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface summer ozone increased in China from 2013 to 2019 despite new governmental efforts targeting ozone pollution. We find that the ozone increase is mostly due to anthropogenic drivers, although meteorology also plays a role. Further analysis for the North China Plain shows that PM2.5 continued to decrease through 2019, while emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) stayed flat. This could explain the anthropogenic increase in ozone, as PM2.5 scavenges the radical precursors of ozone.\n\nWRF-GC (v1.0): online coupling of WRF (v3.9.1.1) and GEOS-Chem (v12.2.1) for regional atmospheric chemistry modeling â Part 1: Description of the one-way model\n\nHaipeng Lin, Xu Feng, Tzung-May Fu, Heng Tian, Yaping Ma, Lijuan Zhang, Daniel J. Jacob, Robert M. Yantosca, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Elizabeth W. Lundgren, Jiawei Zhuang, Qiang Zhang, Xiao Lu, Lin Zhang, Lu Shen, Jianping Guo, Sebastian D. Eastham, and Christoph A. Keller\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 3241–3265, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-3241-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-3241-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOnline coupling of meteorology and chemistry models often presents maintenance issues with hard-wired coding. We present WRF-GC, an one-way online coupling of the WRF meteorological model and GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry model for regional atmospheric chemistry and air quality modeling. Our coupling structure allows future versions of either parent model to be immediately integrated into WRF-GC. The WRF-GC model was able to well reproduce regional PM2.5 with greater computational efficiency.\n\nAn adaptive method for speeding up the numerical integration of chemical mechanisms in atmospheric chemistry models: application to GEOS-Chem version 12.0.0\n\nLu Shen, Daniel J. Jacob, Mauricio Santillana, Xuan Wang, and Wei Chen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 2475–2486, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2475-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2475-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChemical mechanisms in air quality models tend to get more complicated with time, reflecting both increasing knowledge and the need for greater scope. This objectively improves the models but increases the computational burden. In this work, we present an approach that can reduce the computational cost of chemical integration by 30–40 % while maintaining an accuracy better than 1 %. It retains the complexity of the full mechanism where it is needed and preserves full diagnostic information.\n\nFine particulate matter (PM2.5) trends in China, 2013â2018: separating contributions from anthropogenic emissions and meteorology\n\nShixian Zhai, Daniel J. Jacob, Xuan Wang, Lu Shen, Ke Li, Yuzhong Zhang, Ke Gui, Tianliang Zhao, and Hong Liao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 11031–11041, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11031-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11031-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nObserved annual mean PM2.5 decreased by 30–50 % in China from 2013–2018. However, meteorologically PM2.5 variability complicates trend attribution. We used a stepwise multiple linear regression model to quantitatively separate contributions from anthropogenic emissions and meteorology. Results show that 88 % of the PM2.5 decrease across China is attributable to anthropogenic emission changes, and 12 % is attributable to meteorology.\n\nAn evaluation of the ability of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to observe boundary layer ozone pollution across China: application to 2005â2017 ozone trends\n\nLu Shen, Daniel J. Jacob, Xiong Liu, Guanyu Huang, Ke Li, Hong Liao, and Tao Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 6551–6560, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6551-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6551-2019, 2019\n\nInsignificant effect of climate change on winter haze pollution in Beijing\n\nLu Shen, Daniel J. Jacob, Loretta J. Mickley, Yuxuan Wang, and Qiang Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17489–17496, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17489-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17489-2018, 2018\n\nSynoptic meteorological modes of variability for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality in major metropolitan regions of China\n\nDanny M. Leung, Amos P. K. Tai, Loretta J. Mickley, Jonathan M. Moch, Aaron van Donkelaar, Lu Shen, and Randall V. Martin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 6733–6748, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6733-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6733-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper investigates how large-scale weather systems control fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality in China. We show that winter monsoons, onshore winds and frontal rains can drive daily PM2.5 variability in different regions of China. We further project future PM2.5 concentration change by 2050s due to climate change, and verify that climate change has little benefit on future PM2.5 in Beijing, implying cutting down emissions is necessary to mitigate pollutions in megacities of China.\n\nAdverse effects of increasing drought on air quality via natural processes\n\nYuxuan Wang, Yuanyu Xie, Wenhao Dong, Yi Ming, Jun Wang, and Lu Shen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 12827–12843, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-12827-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-12827-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBesides the well-known large impact on agriculture and water resources, drought is associated with significant adverse effects on air quality. Drought-induced degradation of air quality is largely due to natural processes, offsetting the effort of anthropogenic emission reduction during the past decades. Such adverse impacts should be included in modeling processes under current and future climate for mitigation policy.\n\nInfluence of 2000â2050 climate change on particulate matter in the United States: results from a new statistical model\n\nLu Shen, Loretta J. Mickley, and Lee T. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 4355–4367, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-4355-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-4355-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a new method to characterize the influence of atmospheric circulation on surface PM2.5 concentrations. Applying our statistical model to climate projections, we find a strong influence of 2000–2050 climate change on PM2.5 air quality in the United States. We find that current atmospheric chemistry models may underestimate the strong positive sensitivity of PM2.5 to temperature in the eastern United States in summer, and so may underestimate PM2.5 changes in a warmer climate.\n\nInfluence of the Bermuda High on interannual variability of summertime ozone in the HoustonâGalvestonâBrazoria region\n\nYuxuan Wang, Beixi Jia, Sing-Chun Wang, Mark Estes, Lu Shen, and Yuanyu Xie\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 15265–15276, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-15265-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-15265-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper provides empirical evidence that the year-to-year variability of summertime ozone over Houston is linked to the Bermuda High (BH) large-scale circulation patterns. It identifies two BH indices that can explain up to 70 % of the interannual variability of summertime ozone in Houston and illustrates the mechanism underlying the BH and ozone linkage. Such a mechanism is tested for applicability to other coastal urban regions along the US Gulf Coast.\n\nInfluence of synoptic patterns on surface ozone variability over the eastern United States from 1980 to 2012\n\nL. Shen, L. J. Mickley, and A. P. K. Tai\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 10925–10938, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-10925-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-10925-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we have examined the effect of polar jet and Bermuda High on ozone air quality in the eastern United States. In the Midwest and northeast, the poleward shift of jet wind leads to reduced polar jet frequency, resulting in increased ozone there. In the southeast, the influence of Bermuda High on ozone variability depends on the location of its west edge. Westward movement increases the ozone only when the JJA Bermuda High west edge is located west of 85.4Â°W.\n\nUnheralded contributions of biogenic volatile organic compounds from urban greening to ozone pollution: a high-resolution modeling study\n\nHaofan Wang, Yuejin Li, Yiming Liu, Xiao Lu, Yang Zhang, Qi Fan, Tianhang Zhang, and Chong Shen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1163,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1163, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study explores how urban green spaces in Guangzhou influence ozone levels. By using advanced models, we found that natural emissions from these areas can significantly affect air quality. Our results suggest the design and planning of urban green spaces should not only consider aesthetics and social factors but also their environmental impacts on air quality.\n\nSatellite quantification of methane emissions from South American countries: A high-resolution inversion of TROPOMI and GOSAT observations\n\nSarah E. Hancock, Daniel Jacob, Zichong Chen, Hannah Nesser, Aaron Davitt, Daniel J. Varon, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Nicholas Balasus, Lucas A. Estrada, James D. East, Elise Penn, Cynthia A. Randles, John Worden, Ilse Aben, Robert J. Parker, and Joannes D. Maasakkers\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1763,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1763, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify 2021 methane emissions in South America at up to 25 km × 25 km resolution using satellite methane observations. We find a 55 % upward correction to the national anthropogenic inventories reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under the Paris Agreement. Our estimates match inventories for Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay but are much higher for other countries. Livestock emissions (65 % of anthropogenic emissions) show the largest discrepancies.\n\nComparing space-based to reported carbon monoxide emission estimates for Europe’s iron & steel plants\n\nGijs Leguijt, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Hugo A. C. Denier van der Gon, Arjo J. Segers, Tobias Borsdorff, Ivar R. van der Velde, and Ilse Aben\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1561,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1561, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe production of steel coincides with large emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants including carbon monoxide. European facilities are required to report their emissions, which are estimated using a variety of methods. We evaluate these estimates using carbon monoxide concentrations measured using a satellite. We find generally good agreement between our values and those reported but also identify some uncertainties, showing that satellites can provide insights on these emissions.\n\nInterpreting Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) geostationary satellite observations of the diurnal variation in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over East Asia\n\nLaura Hyesung Yang, Daniel J.

We use the chemical transport model to find how emissions, chemistry, and transport drive the changes in NO2 observed by GEMS at different times of the day. In winter, the chemistry plays a minor role, and high daytime emissions dominate the diurnal variation in NO2, balanced by transport. In summer, emissions, chemistry, and transport play an important role in shaping the diurnal variation in NO2.\n\nAssessing methane emissions from collapsing Venezuelan oil production using TROPOMI\n\nBrian Nathan, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Stijn Naus, Ritesh Gautam, Mark Omara, Daniel J. Varon, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Lucas A. Estrada, Alba Lorente, Tobias Borsdorff, Robert J. Parker, and Ilse Aben\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 6845–6863, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6845-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6845-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVenezuela's Lake Maracaibo region is notoriously hard to observe from space and features intensive oil exploitation, although production has strongly decreased in recent years. We estimate methane emissions using 2018–2020 TROPOMI satellite observations with national and regional transport models. Despite the production decrease, we find relatively constant emissions from Lake Maracaibo between 2018 and 2020, indicating that there could be large emissions from abandoned infrastructure.\n\nSmall emission sources disproportionately account for a large majority of total methane emissions from the US oil and gas sector\n\nJames P. Williams, Mark Omara, Anthony Himmelberger, Daniel Zavala-Araiza, Katlyn MacKay, Joshua Benmergui, Maryann Sargent, Steven C. Wofsy, Steven P. Hamburg, and Ritesh Gautam\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1402,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1402, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe utilize peer-reviewed facility-level oil and gas methane emission rate data gathered in prior work to estimate the relative contributions of methane sources emitting at different emission rates in the United States. We find that the majority of total methane emissions in the US oil and gas sector stem from a large number of small sources emitting in aggregate, corroborating findings from several other studies.\n\nA continuous 2011–2022 record of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in East Asia at daily 2-km resolution from geostationary satellite observations: population exposure and long-term trends\n\nDrew C. Pendergrass, Daniel J. Jacob, Yujin J. Oak, Jeewoo Lee, Minseok Kim, Jhoon Kim, Seoyoung Lee, Shixian Zhai, Hitoshi Irie, and Hong Liao\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-172,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-172, 2024\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFine particles suspended in the atmosphere are a major form of air pollution and an important public health burden. However, measurements of particulate matter are sparse in space and in places like East Asia monitors are established after regulatory policies to improve pollution have changed. In this paper, we use machine learning to fill in the gaps. We train an algorithm to predict pollution at the surface from the atmosphere’s opacity, then produce high resolution maps of data without gaps.\n\nReport on Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2B observations of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline methane leak\n\nMatthieu Dogniaux, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Daniel J. Varon, and Ilse Aben\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 2777–2787, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-2777-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-2777-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyze Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2B (S-2B) observations of the 2022 Nord Stream 2 methane leak and show how challenging this case is for usual data analysis methods. We provide customized calibrations for this Nord Stream 2 case and assess that no firm conclusion can be drawn from L8 or S-2B single overpasses. However, if we opportunistically assume that L8 and S-2B results are independent, we find an averaged L8 and S-2B combined methane leak rate of 502 ± 464 t h−1.\n\nU-Plume: automated algorithm for plume detection and source quantification by satellite point-source imagers\n\nJack H. Bruno, Dylan Jervis, Daniel J. Varon, and Daniel J. Jacob\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 2625–2636, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-2625-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-2625-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas and a current high-priority target for short- to mid-term climate change mitigation. Detection of individual methane emitters from space has become possible in recent years, and the volume of data for this task has been rapidly growing, outpacing processing capabilities. We introduce an automated approach, U-Plume, which can detect and quantify emissions from individual methane sources in high-spatial-resolution satellite data.\n\nHigh-resolution US methane emissions inferred from an inversion of 2019 TROPOMI satellite data: contributions from individual states, urban areas, and landfills\n\nHannah Nesser, Daniel J.

We find a 13 % upward correction to the 2023 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (GHGI) for 2019, with large corrections to individual states, urban areas, and landfills. This may present a challenge for US climate policies and goals, many of which target significant reductions in methane emissions.\n\nFormation of Reactive Nitrogen Species Promoted by Iron Ions Through the Photochemistry of Neonicotinoid Insecticide\n\nZhu Ran, Yanan Hu, Yuanzhe Li, Xiaoya Gao, Can Ye, Shuai Li, Xiao Lu, Yongming Luo, Sasho Gligorovski, and Jiangping Liu\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1116,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1116, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report eruptive production of nitrous acid (HONO) and NOx (NO + NO2) triggered by iron ions during the photolysis of neonicotinoid insecticide in the air-water interface. This novel previously overlooked source of atmospheric HONO and NOx, may be an important contribution to the global nitrogen cycle and affects the atmospheric oxidizing capacity as well as the climate change.\n\nA bias-corrected GEMS geostationary satellite product for nitrogen dioxide using machine learning to enforce consistency with the TROPOMI satellite instrument\n\nYujin J. Oak, Daniel J. Jacob, Nicholas Balasus, Laura H. Yang, Heesung Chong, Junsung Park, Hanlim Lee, Gitaek T. Lee, Eunjo S. Ha, Rokjin J. Park, Hyeong-Ahn Kwon, and Jhoon Kim\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-393,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-393, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present an improved NO2 product from GEMS by calibrating it to TROPOMI using machine learning and by reprocessing both satellite products to adopt common NO2 profiles. Our corrected GEMS product combines the high data density of GEMS with the accuracy of TROPOMI, supporting the combined use for analyses of East Asia air quality including emissions and chemistry. This method can be extended to other species and geostationary satellites including TEMPO and Sentinel-4.\n\nConstructing a measurement-based spatially explicit inventory of US oil and gas methane emissions\n\nMark Omara, Anthony Himmelberger, Katlyn MacKay, James P. Williams, Joshua Benmergui, Maryann Sargent, Steven C. Wofsy, and Ritesh Gautam\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-72,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-72, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for ESSD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe review, analyze, and synthesize previous peer-reviewed measurement-based data on facility-level oil and gas methane emissions and use these data to develop a high-resolution spatially explicit inventory of national methane emissions. This work provides improved assessment of national methane emissions relative to government inventories in support of accurate and comprehensive methane emissions assessment, attribution, and mitigation.\n\nVerifying national inventory-based combustion emissions of CO2 across the UK and mainland Europe using satellite observations of atmospheric CO and CO2\n\nTia Scarpelli, Paul Palmer, Mark Lunt, Ingrid Super, and Arjan Droste\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-416,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-416, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries must track their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This study describes a method to determine self-consistent estimates for combustion emissions and natural fluxes of CO2 from atmospheric data We report consistent estimates inferred using this approach from satellite data and ground-based data over Europe, suggesting that satellite data can be used to determine national anthropogenic CO2 emissions for countries where ground-based CO2 data are absent.\n\nA remote sensing algorithm for vertically resolved cloud condensation nuclei number concentrations from airborne and spaceborne lidar observations\n\nPiyushkumar N. Patel, Jonathan H. Jiang, Ritesh Gautam, Harish Gadhavi, Olga Kalashnikova, Michael J. Garay, Lan Gao, Feng Xu, and Ali Omar\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2861–2883, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2861-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2861-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are essential for understanding aerosol–cloud interactions and predicting climate change. To address this gap, we introduced a remote sensing algorithm that retrieves vertically resolved CCN number concentrations from airborne and spaceborne lidar systems. This innovation offers a global distribution of CCN concentrations from space, facilitating model evaluation and precise quantification of aerosol climate forcing.\n\nGlobal impacts of aviation on air quality evaluated at high resolution\n\nSebastian D. Eastham, Guillaume P. ChossiÃ¨re, Raymond L. Speth, Daniel J. Jacob, and Steven R. H. Barrett\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2687–2703, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2687-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2687-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmissions from aircraft are known to cause air quality impacts worldwide, but the scale and mechanisms of this impact are not well understood. This work uses high-resolution computational modeling of the atmosphere to show that air pollution changes from aviation are mostly the result of emissions during cruise (high-altitude) operations, that these impacts are related to how much non-aviation pollution is present, and that prior regional assessments have underestimated these impacts.\n\nMeasurement report: Nocturnal subsidence behind the cold front enhances surface particulate matter in plains regions: observations from the mobile multi-lidar system\n\nYiming Wang, Haolin Wang, Yujie Qin, Xinqi Xu, Guowen He, Nanxi Liu, Shengjie Miao, Xiao Lu, Haichao Wang, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Combined with the surface PM2.5 data, the ERA5 reanalysis data, and GEOS-Chem simulations during Dec 2018–Feb 2019, we found that transport nocturnal PM2.5 enhancement by subsidence (T-NPES) events widely occurred with high frequencies in plains regions in eastern China but happened less often in basin regions like Xi’an and Chengdu. We propose a conceptual model of the T-NPES events.\n\nIntercomparison of GEOS-Chem and CAM-chem tropospheric oxidant chemistry within the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2)\n\nHaipeng Lin, Louisa K.

Global atmospheric chemistry models show large differences in simulations of tropospheric ozone but isolating sources of differences is complicated by different model environments. By implementing the GEOS-Chem model side-by-side to CAM-chem within a common Earth system model, we identify and evaluate specific differences between the two models and their impacts on key chemical species.\n\nImpacts of updated reaction kinetics on the global GEOS-Chem simulation of atmospheric chemistry\n\nKelvin H. Bates, Mathew J. Evans, Barron H. Henderson, and Daniel J. Jacob\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1511–1524, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1511-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1511-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurate representation of rates and products of chemical reactions in atmospheric models is crucial for simulating concentrations of pollutants and climate forcers. We update the widely used GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry model with reaction parameters from recent compilations of experimental data and demonstrate the implications for key atmospheric chemical species. The updates decrease tropospheric CO mixing ratios and increase stratospheric nitrogen oxide mixing ratios, among other changes.\n\nImproved definition of prior uncertainties in CO2 and CO fossil fuel fluxes and the impact on a multi-species inversion with GEOS-Chem (v12.5)\n\nIngrid Super, Tia Scarpelli, Arjan Droste, and Paul I. Palmer\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2025,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2025, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMonitoring greenhouse gas emission reductions requires a combination of models, observations and a first estimate of the emissions. Each of these components provides information with a certain level of certainty and is weighted to get the most reliable estimate of actual emissions. We describe efforts to estimate the uncertainty in the first emission estimate, which has a significant impact on the outcome. Hence, a good uncertainty estimate is important to get reliable information on emissions.\n\nMeasurement report: Assessing the impacts of emission uncertainty on aerosol optical properties and radiative forcing from biomass burning in peninsular Southeast Asia\n\nYinbao Jin, Yiming Liu, Xiao Lu, Xiaoyang Chen, Ao Shen, Haofan Wang, Yinping Cui, Yifei Xu, Siting Li, Jian Liu, Ming Zhang, Yingying Ma, and Qi Fan\n\nAtmos.

Here we present observations from the first flight campaign of MethaneAIR, a MethaneSAT-like instrument mounted to an aircraft. MethaneAIR can map methane with high precision and accuracy over a typical sized oil and gas basin (~200 km2) in a single flight.

We show that the total CH4 emissions in our studied areas are much higher than the emissions reported to UNFCCC, and up to three-quarters of the detected emissions are related to operational venting. Our results suggest that oil and gas production infrastructure in Romania holds a massive mitigation potential.\n\nAutomated detection and monitoring of methane super-emitters using satellite data\n\nBerend J.

CHEEREIO uses the difference between the model simulations of the atmosphere and real-world observations to come up with a good guess for the actual composition of our atmosphere, the true emissions of various pollutants, and whatever else they may want to study.\n\nA blended TROPOMI+GOSAT satellite data product for atmospheric methane using machine learning to correct retrieval biases\n\nNicholas Balasus, Daniel J. Jacob, Alba Lorente, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Robert J. Parker, Hartmut Boesch, Zichong Chen, Makoto M. Kelp, Hannah Nesser, and Daniel J. Varon\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 3787–3807, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-3787-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-3787-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use machine learning to remove biases in TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane, with GOSAT observations serving as a reference. We find that the TROPOMI biases relative to GOSAT are related to the presence of aerosols and clouds, the surface brightness, and the specific detector that makes the observation aboard TROPOMI. The resulting blended TROPOMI+GOSAT product is more reliable for quantifying methane emissions.\n\nQuantification of carbon monoxide emissions from African cities using TROPOMI\n\nGijs Leguijt, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Hugo A. C. Denier van der Gon, Arjo J. Segers, Tobias Borsdorff, and Ilse Aben\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8899–8919, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8899-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8899-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a fast method to evaluate carbon monoxide emissions from cities in Africa. Carbon monoxide is important for climate change in an indirect way, as it is linked to ozone, methane, and carbon dioxide. Our measurements are made with a satellite that sees the entire globe every single day. This means that we can check from space whether the current knowledge of emission rates is up to date. We make the comparison and show that the emission rates in northern Africa are underestimated.\n\nMEIAT-CMAQ v1.0: A Modular Emission Inventory Allocation Tool for Community Multiscale Air Quality Model Version 1.0\n\nHaofan Wang, Jiaxin Qiu, Yiming Liu, Qi Fan, Xiao Lu, Yang Zhang, Kai Wu, Ao Shen, Yifei Xu, Yinbao Jin, Yuqi Zhu, Jiayin Sun, and Haolin Wang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1309,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1309, 2023\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis tool improves existing methods by providing temporal and species allocation modules and enabling emission file generation in advance for any time period. The tool is also capable of vertical plane distribution for high altitude emissions and accurately tracks road-related emissions, an area overlooked by other tools. It utilizes 50 % of the CPU capacity for efficient parallel processing during allocation.\n\nVariation and trend of nitrate radical reactivity towards volatile organic compounds in Beijing, China\n\nHejun Hu, Haichao Wang, Keding Lu, Jie Wang, Zelong Zheng, Xuezhen Xu, Tianyu Zhai, Xiaorui Chen, Xiao Lu, Wenxing Fu, Xin Li, Limin Zeng, Min Hu, Yuanhang Zhang, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8211–8223, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8211-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8211-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrate radical chemistry is critical to the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and secondary organic aerosol formation. This work investigated the level, seasonal variation, and trend of nitrate radical reactivity towards volatile organic compounds (kNO3) in Beijing. We show the key role of isoprene and styrene in regulating seasonal variation in kNO3 and rebuild a long-term record of kNO3 based on the reported VOC measurements.\n\nACEIC: a comprehensive anthropogenic chlorine emission inventory for China\n\nSiting Li, Yiming Liu, Yuqi Zhu, Yinbao Jin, Yingying Hong, Ao Shen, Yifei Xu, Haofan Wang, Haichao Wang, Xiao Lu, Shaojia Fan, and Qi Fan\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1448,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1448, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study establishes an inventory of anthropogenic chlorine emissions in China in 2018 with expanded categories (HCl, Cl-, Cl2, HOCl) and sources (41 specific sources) with detailed spatial and temporal assignments, and emission factors based on localized survey data. This study enhances the understanding of anthropogenic chlorine emissions in the atmosphere, identifies key sources, and provides scientific support for pollution control and climate change.\n\nEast Asian methane emissions inferred from high-resolution inversions of GOSAT and TROPOMI observations: a comparative and evaluative analysis\n\nRuosi Liang, Yuzhong Zhang, Wei Chen, Peixuan Zhang, Jingran Liu, Cuihong Chen, Huiqin Mao, Guofeng Shen, Zhen Qu, Zichong Chen, Minqiang Zhou, Pucai Wang, Robert J. Parker, Hartmut Boesch, Alba Lorente, Joannes D. Maasakkers, and Ilse Aben\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8039–8057, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8039-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8039-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare and evaluate East Asian methane emissions inferred from different satellite observations (GOSAT and TROPOMI). The results show discrepancies over northern India and eastern China. Independent ground-based observations are more consistent with TROPOMI-derived emissions in northern India and GOSAT-derived emissions in eastern China.\n\nContinuous weekly monitoring of methane emissions from the Permian Basin by inversion of TROPOMI satellite observations\n\nDaniel J. Varon, Daniel J. Jacob, Benjamin Hmiel, Ritesh Gautam, David R. Lyon, Mark Omara, Melissa Sulprizio, Lu Shen, Drew Pendergrass, Hannah Nesser, Zhen Qu, Zachary R. Barkley, Natasha L. Miles, Scott J. Richardson, Kenneth J. Davis, Sudhanshu Pandey, Xiao Lu, Alba Lorente, Tobias Borsdorff, Joannes D. Maasakkers, and Ilse Aben\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7503–7520, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7503-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7503-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use TROPOMI satellite observations to quantify weekly methane emissions from the US Permian oil and gas basin from May 2018 to October 2020. We find that Permian emissions are highly variable, with diverse economic and activity drivers. The most important drivers during our study period were new well development and natural gas price. Permian methane intensity averaged 4.6 % and decreased by 1 % per year.\n\nBackground nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over the United States and its implications for satellite observations and trends: effects of nitrate photolysis, aircraft, and open fires\n\nRuijun Dang, Daniel J. Jacob, Viral Shah, Sebastian D. Eastham, Thibaud M. Fritz, Loretta J. Mickley, Tianjia Liu, Yi Wang, and Jun Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6271–6284, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6271-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6271-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use the GEOS-Chem model to better understand the magnitude and trend in free tropospheric NO2 over the contiguous US. Model underestimate of background NO2 is largely corrected by considering aerosol nitrate photolysis. Increase in aircraft emissions affects satellite retrievals by altering the NO2 shape factor, and this effect is expected to increase in future. We show the importance of properly accounting for the free tropospheric background in interpreting NO2 observations from space.\n\nQuantification of oil and gas methane emissions in the Delaware and Marcellus basins using a network of continuous tower-based measurements\n\nZachary Barkley, Kenneth Davis, Natasha Miles, Scott Richardson, Aijun Deng, Benjamin Hmiel, David Lyon, and Thomas Lauvaux\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6127–6144, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6127-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6127-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing methane monitoring instruments attached to towers, we measure methane concentrations and quantify methane emissions coming from the Marcellus and Permian oil and gas basins. In the Marcellus, emissions were 3 times higher than the state inventory across the entire monitoring period. In the Permian, we see a sharp decline in emissions aligning with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tower observational networks can be utilized in other basins for long-term monitoring of emissions.\n\nSatellite quantification of methane emissions and oilâgas methane intensities from individual countries in the Middle East and North Africa: implications for climate action\n\nZichong Chen, Daniel J. Jacob, Ritesh Gautam, Mark Omara, Robert N. Stavins, Robert C. Stowe, Hannah Nesser, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Alba Lorente, Daniel J. Varon, Xiao Lu, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Drew C. Pendergrass, and Sarah Hancock\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5945–5967, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5945-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5945-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify methane emissions from individual countries in the Middle East and North Africa by inverse analysis of 2019 TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane. We show that the ability to simply relate oil/gas emissions to activity metrics is compromised by stochastic nature of local infrastructure and management practices. We find that the industry target for oil/gas methane intensity is achievable through associated gas capture, modern infrastructure, and centralized operations.\n\nCoarse particulate matter air quality in East Asia: implications for fine particulate nitrate\n\nShixian Zhai, Daniel J. Jacob, Drew C. Pendergrass, Nadia K. Colombi, Viral Shah, Laura Hyesung Yang, Qiang Zhang, Shuxiao Wang, Hwajin Kim, Yele Sun, Jin-Soo Choi, Jin-Soo Park, Gan Luo, Fangqun Yu, Jung-Hun Woo, Younha Kim, Jack E. Dibb, Taehyoung Lee, Jin-Seok Han, Bruce E. Anderson, Ke Li, and Hong Liao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4271–4281, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4271-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4271-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnthropogenic fugitive dust in East Asia not only causes severe coarse particulate matter air pollution problems, but also affects fine particulate nitrate. Due to emission control efforts, coarse PM decreased steadily. We find that the decrease of coarse PM is a major driver for a lack of decrease of fine particulate nitrate, as it allows more nitric acid to form fine particulate nitrate. The continuing decrease of coarse PM requires more stringent ammonia and nitrogen oxides emission controls.\n\nWhy is ozone in South Korea and the Seoul metropolitan area so high and increasing?\n\nNadia K. Colombi, Daniel J. Jacob, Laura Hyesung Yang, Shixian Zhai, Viral Shah, Stuart K. Grange, Robert M. Yantosca, Soontae Kim, and Hong Liao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4031–4044, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4031-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4031-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface ozone, detrimental to human and ecosystem health, is very high and increasing in South Korea. Using a global model of the atmosphere, we found that emissions from South Korea and China contribute equally to the high ozone observed. We found that in the absence of all anthropogenic emissions over East Asia, ozone is still very high, implying that the air quality standard in South Korea is not practically achievable unless this background external to East Asia can be decreased.\n\nA high-resolution satellite-based map of global methane emissions reveals missing wetland, fossil fuel, and monsoon sources\n\nXueying Yu, Dylan B. Millet, Daven K. Henze, Alexander J. Turner, Alba Lorente Delgado, A. Anthony Bloom, and Jianxiong Sheng\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 3325–3346, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3325-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3325-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combine satellite measurements with a novel downscaling method to map global methane emissions at 0.1°×0.1° resolution. These fine-scale emission estimates reveal unreported emission hotspots and shed light on the roles of agriculture, wetlands, and fossil fuels for regional methane budgets. The satellite-derived emissions point in particular to missing fossil fuel emissions in the Middle East and to a large emission underestimate in South Asia that appears to be tied to monsoon rainfall.\n\nTropospheric NO2 vertical profiles over South Korea and their relation to oxidant chemistry: implications for geostationary satellite retrievals and the observation of NO2 diurnal variation from space\n\nLaura Hyesung Yang, Daniel J. Jacob, Nadia K. Colombi, Shixian Zhai, Kelvin H. Bates, Viral Shah, Ellie Beaudry, Robert M. Yantosca, Haipeng Lin, Jared F. Brewer, Heesung Chong, Katherine R. Travis, James H. Crawford, Lok N. Lamsal, Ja-Ho Koo, and Jhoon Kim\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2465–2481, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2465-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2465-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA geostationary satellite can now provide hourly NO2 vertical columns, and obtaining the NO2 vertical columns from space relies on NO2 vertical distribution from the chemical transport model (CTM). In this work, we update the CTM to better represent the chemistry environment so that the CTM can accurately provide NO2 vertical distribution. We also find that the changes in NO2 vertical distribution driven by a change in mixing depth play an important role in the NO2 column's diurnal variation.\n\nNitrogen oxides in the free troposphere: implications for tropospheric oxidants and the interpretation of satellite NO2 measurements\n\nViral Shah, Daniel J. Jacob, Ruijun Dang, Lok N. Lamsal, Sarah A. Strode, Stephen D. Steenrod, K. Folkert Boersma, Sebastian D. Eastham, Thibaud M. Fritz, Chelsea Thompson, Jeff Peischl, Ilann Bourgeois, Ilana B. Pollack, Benjamin A. Nault, Ronald C. Cohen, Pedro Campuzano-Jost, Jose L. Jimenez, Simone T. Andersen, Lucy J. Carpenter, TomÃ¡s Sherwen, and Mat J. Evans\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 1227–1257, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1227-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1227-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNOx in the free troposphere (above 2 km) affects global tropospheric chemistry and the retrieval and interpretation of satellite NO2 measurements. We evaluate free tropospheric NOx in global atmospheric chemistry models and find that recycling NOx from its reservoirs over the oceans is faster than that simulated in the models, resulting in increases in simulated tropospheric ozone and OH. Over the U.S., free tropospheric NO2 contributes the majority of the tropospheric NO2 column in summer.\n\nUnderstanding the potential of Sentinel-2 for monitoring methane point emissions\n\nJavier GorroÃ±o, Daniel J. Varon, Itziar Irakulis-Loitxate, and Luis Guanter\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 89–107, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-89-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-89-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a methane flux rate retrieval methodology using the Sentinel-2 mission, validating the algorithm for different scenes and plumes. The detection limit is 1000–2000 kg h−1 for homogeneous scenes and temporally invariant surfaces and above 5000 kg h−1 for heterogeneous ones. Dominant quantification errors are wind-related or plume mask-related. For heterogeneous scenes, the surface structure underlying the methane plume can become a dominant source of uncertainty.\n\nDetecting and quantifying methane emissions from oil and gas production: algorithm development with ground-truth calibration based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery\n\nZhan Zhang, Evan D. Sherwin, Daniel J. Varon, and Adam R. Brandt\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 7155–7169, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7155-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7155-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work developed a multi-band–multi-pass–multi-comparison-date Sentinel-2 methane retrieval algorithm, and the method was calibrated by data from a controlled release test. To our knowledge, this is the first study that validates the performance of a Sentinel-2 methane detection algorithm by calibration with a ground-truth testing. It illustrates the potential for additional validation with systematic future experiments wherein algorithms can be tuned to meet different detection expectations.\n\nImproved advection, resolution, performance, and community access in the new generation (version 13) of the high-performance GEOS-Chem global atmospheric chemistry model (GCHP)\n\nRandall V. Martin, Sebastian D. Eastham, Liam Bindle, Elizabeth W. Lundgren, Thomas L. Clune, Christoph A. Keller, William Downs, Dandan Zhang, Robert A. Lucchesi, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Robert M. Yantosca, Yanshun Li, Lucas Estrada, William M. Putman, Benjamin M. Auer, Atanas L. Trayanov, Steven Pawson, and Daniel J. Jacob\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8731–8748, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8731-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8731-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric chemistry models must be able to operate both online as components of Earth system models and offline as standalone models. The widely used GEOS-Chem model operates both online and offline, but the classic offline version is not suitable for massively parallel simulations. We describe a new generation of the offline high-performance GEOS-Chem (GCHP) that enables high-resolution simulations on thousands of cores, including on the cloud, with improved access, performance, and accuracy.\n\nImplementation and evaluation of the GEOS-Chem chemistry module version 13.1.2 within the Community Earth System Model v2.1\n\nThibaud M. Fritz, Sebastian D. Eastham, Louisa K. Emmons, Haipeng Lin, Elizabeth W. Lundgren, Steve Goldhaber, Steven R. H. Barrett, and Daniel J. Jacob\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8669–8704, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8669-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8669-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe bring the state-of-the-science chemistry module GEOS-Chem into the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We show that some known differences between results from GEOS-Chem and CESM's CAM-chem chemistry module may be due to the configuration of model meteorology rather than inherent differences in the model chemistry. This is a significant step towards a truly modular Earth system model and allows two strong but currently separate research communities to benefit from each other's advances.\n\nThe unexpected high frequency of nocturnal surface ozone enhancement events over China: characteristics and mechanisms\n\nCheng He, Xiao Lu, Haolin Wang, Haichao Wang, Yan Li, Guowen He, Yuanping He, Yurun Wang, Youlang Zhang, Yiming Liu, Qi Fan, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 15243–15261, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15243-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15243-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report that nocturnal ozone enhancement (NOE) events are observed at a high annual frequency of 41 % over 800 sites in China in 2014–2019 (about 50 % higher than that over Europe or the US). High daytime ozone provides a rich ozone source in the nighttime residual layer, determining the overall high frequency of NOE events in China, and enhanced atmospheric mixing then triggers NOE events by allowing the ozone-rich air in the residual layer to be mixed into the nighttime boundary layer.\n\nGlobal tropospheric ozone trends, attributions, and radiative impacts in 1995â2017: an integrated analysis using aircraft (IAGOS) observations, ozonesonde, and multi-decadal chemical model simulations\n\nHaolin Wang, Xiao Lu, Daniel J. Jacob, Owen R. Cooper, Kai-Lan Chang, Ke Li, Meng Gao, Yiming Liu, Bosi Sheng, Kai Wu, Tongwen Wu, Jie Zhang, Bastien Sauvage, Philippe NÃ©dÃ©lec, Romain Blot, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13753–13782, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13753-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13753-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report significant global tropospheric ozone increases in 1995–2017 based on extensive aircraft and ozonesonde observations. Using GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System chemistry model) multi-decadal global simulations, we find that changes in global anthropogenic emissions, in particular the rapid increases in aircraft emissions, contribute significantly to the increases in tropospheric ozone and resulting radiative impact.\n\nMethane emissions from China: a high-resolution inversion of TROPOMI satellite observations\n\nZichong Chen, Daniel J. Jacob, Hannah Nesser, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Alba Lorente, Daniel J. Varon, Xiao Lu, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Elise Penn, and Xueying Yu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 10809–10826, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10809-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10809-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify methane emissions in China and contributions from different sectors by inverse analysis of 2019 TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane. We find that anthropogenic methane emissions for China are underestimated in the national inventory. Our estimate of emissions indicates a small life-cycle loss rate, implying net climate benefits from the current coal-to-gas energy transition in China. However, this small loss rate can be misleading given China's high gas imports.\n\nQuantifying methane emissions from the global scale down to point sources using satellite observations of atmospheric methane\n\nDaniel J. Jacob, Daniel J. Varon, Daniel H. Cusworth, Philip E. Dennison, Christian Frankenberg, Ritesh Gautam, Luis Guanter, John Kelley, Jason McKeever, Lesley E. Ott, Benjamin Poulter, Zhen Qu, Andrew K. Thorpe, John R. Worden, and Riley M. Duren\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 9617–9646, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9617-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9617-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe review the capability of satellite observations of atmospheric methane to quantify methane emissions on all scales. We cover retrieval methods, precision requirements, inverse methods for inferring emissions, source detection thresholds, and observations of system completeness. We show that current instruments already enable quantification of regional and national emissions including contributions from large point sources. Coverage and resolution will increase significantly in coming years.\n\nIntegrated Methane Inversion (IMI 1.0): a user-friendly, cloud-based facility for inferring high-resolution methane emissions from TROPOMI satellite observations\n\nDaniel J. Varon, Daniel J. Jacob, Melissa Sulprizio, Lucas A. Estrada, William B. Downs, Lu Shen, Sarah E. Hancock, Hannah Nesser, Zhen Qu, Elise Penn, Zichong Chen, Xiao Lu, Alba Lorente, Ashutosh Tewari, and Cynthia A. Randles\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 5787–5805, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5787-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5787-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReducing atmospheric methane emissions is critical to slow near-term climate change. Globally surveying satellite instruments like the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) have unique capabilities for monitoring atmospheric methane around the world. Here we present a user-friendly cloud-computing tool that enables researchers and stakeholders to quantify methane emissions across user-selected regions of interest using TROPOMI satellite observations.\n\nClimate consequences of hydrogen emissions\n\nIlissa B. Ocko and Steven P. Hamburg\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 9349–9368, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9349-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-9349-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrogen is considered a key strategy to decarbonize the global economy. However, hydrogen is also a short-lived indirect greenhouse gas that can easily leak into the atmosphere. Given that the climate impacts from hydrogen emissions are not well understood, especially in the near term, we assess impacts over all timescales for plausible emissions rates. We find that hydrogen leakage can cause more warming than widely perceived; thus, attention is needed to minimize emissions.\n\nReconstructed daily ground-level O3 in China over 2005–2021 for climatological, ecological, and health research\n\nChenhong Zhou, Fan Wang, Yike Guo, Cheng Liu, Dongsheng Ji, Yuesi Wang, Xiaobin Xu, Xiao Lu, Yan Wang, Gregory Carmichael, and Meng Gao\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-187,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-187, 2022\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model integrating high-resolution meteorological data, satellite retrievals of trace gases, etc. to provide reconstructed daily ground-level O3 over 2005–2021 in China. It can facilitate climatological, ecological, and health research. The dataset is freely available at Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/6507706#.Yo8hKujP13g; Zhou, 2022).\n\nSecondary PM2.5 decreases significantly less than NO2 emission reductions during COVID lockdown in Germany\n\nVigneshkumar Balamurugan, Jia Chen, Zhen Qu, Xiao Bi, and Frank N. Keutsch\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 7105–7129, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7105-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7105-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we investigated the response of secondary pollutants to changes in precursor emissions, focusing on the formation of secondary PM, during the COVID-19 lockdown period. We show that, due to the decrease in primary NOx emissions, atmospheric oxidizing capacity is increased. The nighttime increase in ozone, caused by less NO titration, results in higher NO3 radicals, which contribute significantly to the formation of PM nitrates. O3 should be limited in order to control PM pollution.\n\nThe 2019 methane budget and uncertainties at 1Â° resolution and each country through Bayesian integration Of GOSAT total column methane data and a priori inventory estimates\n\nJohn R.

Phys., 22, 6811–6841, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-6811-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-6811-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper is intended to accomplish two goals: 1) describe a new algorithm by which remotely sensed measurements of methane or other tracers can be used to not just quantify methane fluxes, but also attribute these fluxes to specific sources and regions and characterize their uncertainties, and 2) use this new algorithm to provide methane emissions by sector and country in support of the global stock take.\n\nMethane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and isotopic ratios of methane observations from the Permian Basin tower network\n\nVanessa C. Monteiro, Natasha L. Miles, Scott J. Richardson, Zachary Barkley, Bernd J. Haupt, David Lyon, Benjamin Hmiel, and Kenneth J. Davis\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 2401–2417, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2401-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2401-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe a network of five ground-based in situ towers, equipped to measure concentrations of methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and the isotopic ratio of methane, in the Permian Basin, United States. The main goal is to use methane concentrations with atmospheric models to determine methane emissions from one of the Permian sub-basins. These datasets can improve emissions estimations, leading to best practices in the oil and natural gas industry, and policies for emissions reduction.\n\nMapping methane plumes at very high spatial resolution with the WorldView-3 satellite\n\nElena SÃ¡nchez-GarcÃ­a, Javier GorroÃ±o, Itziar Irakulis-Loitxate, Daniel J. Varon, and Luis Guanter\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1657–1674, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1657-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1657-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study seeks to present the as-yet-unknown potential use of WorldView-3 for the mapping of methane point source emissions. The proposed retrieval methodology is based on the idea that the spectral channels not affected by methane can be used to predict the methane-affected band through regression analysis. The results show the precise location of 26 independent point emissions over different methane hotspot regions worldwide, which prove the game-changing potential that this mission entails.\n\nUpdated Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI) for methane emissions from the oil, gas, and coal sectors: evaluation with inversions of atmospheric methane observations\n\nTia R. Scarpelli, Daniel J. Jacob, Shayna Grossman, Xiao Lu, Zhen Qu, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Yuzhong Zhang, Frances Reuland, Deborah Gordon, and John R. Worden\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 3235–3249, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3235-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3235-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a spatially explicit version of the national inventories of oil, gas, and coal methane emissions as submitted by individual countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2021. We then use atmospheric modeling to compare our inventory emissions to atmospheric methane observations with the goal of identifying potential under- and overestimates of oil–gas methane emissions in the national inventories.\n\nContinuous mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality in East Asia at daily 6 âÃâ 6 km2 resolution by application of a random forest algorithm to 2011â2019 GOCI geostationary satellite data\n\nDrew C. Pendergrass, Shixian Zhai, Jhoon Kim, Ja-Ho Koo, Seoyoung Lee, Minah Bae, Soontae Kim, Hong Liao, and Daniel J. Jacob\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1075–1091, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1075-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1075-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper uses a machine learning algorithm to infer high-resolution maps of particulate air quality in eastern China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula, using data from a geostationary satellite along with meteorology. We then perform an extensive evaluation of this inferred air quality and use it to diagnose trends in the region. We hope this paper and the associated data will be valuable to other scientists interested in epidemiology, air quality, remote sensing, and machine learning.\n\nA machine-learning-guided adaptive algorithm to reduce the computational cost of integrating kinetics in global atmospheric chemistry models: application to GEOS-Chem versions 12.0.0 and 12.9.1\n\nLu Shen, Daniel J. Jacob, Mauricio Santillana, Kelvin Bates, Jiawei Zhuang, and Wei Chen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 1677–1687, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1677-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1677-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe high computational cost of chemical integration is a long-standing limitation in global atmospheric chemistry models. Here we present an adaptive and efficient algorithm that can reduce the computational time of atmospheric chemistry by 50 % and maintain the error below 2 % for important species, inspired by machine learning clustering techniques and traditional asymptotic analysis ideas.\n\nSurface ozone impacts on major crop production in China from 2010 to 2017\n\nDianyi Li, Drew Shindell, Dian Ding, Xiao Lu, Lin Zhang, and Yuqiang Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2625–2638, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2625-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2625-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we applied chemical transport model simulation with the latest annual anthropogenic emission inventory to study the long-term trend of ozone-induced crop production losses from 2010 to 2017 in China. We find that overall the ozone-induced crop production loss in China is significant and the annual average economic losses for wheat, rice, maize, and soybean in China are USD 9.55 billion, USD 8.53 billion, USD 2.23 billion, and USD 1.16 billion respectively, over the 8 years.\n\nAn integrated analysis of contemporary methane emissions and concentration trends over China using in situ and satellite observations and model simulations\n\nHaiyue Tan, Lin Zhang, Xiao Lu, Yuanhong Zhao, Bo Yao, Robert J. Parker, and Hartmut Boesch\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1229–1249, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1229-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1229-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMethane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Understanding methane emissions and concentration growth over China in the past decade is important to support its mitigation. This study analyzes the contributions of methane emissions from different regions and sources over the globe to methane changes over China in 2007–2018. Our results show strong international transport influences and emphasize the need of intensive methane measurements covering eastern China.\n\nMethane emissions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico: evaluation of national methane emission inventories and 2010â2017 sectoral trends by inverse analysis of in situ (GLOBALVIEWplus CH4 ObsPack) and satellite (GOSAT) atmospheric observations\n\nXiao Lu, Daniel J. Jacob, Haolin Wang, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Yuzhong Zhang, Tia R. Scarpelli, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Hannah Nesser, A. Anthony Bloom, Shuang Ma, John R. Worden, Shaojia Fan, Robert J. Parker, Hartmut Boesch, Ritesh Gautam, Deborah Gordon, Michael D. Moran, Frances Reuland, Claudia A. Octaviano Villasana, and Arlyn Andrews\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 395–418, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-395-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-395-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate methane emissions and trends for 2010–2017 in the gridded national emission inventories for the United States, Canada, and Mexico by inversion of in situ and satellite methane observations. We find that anthropogenic methane emissions for all three countries are underestimated in the national inventories, largely driven by oil emissions. Anthropogenic methane emissions in the US peak in 2014, in contrast to the report of a steadily decreasing trend over 2010–2017 from the US EPA.\n\nThe drivers and health risks of unexpected surface ozone enhancements over the Sichuan Basin, China, in 2020\n\nYouwen Sun, Hao Yin, Xiao Lu, Justus Notholt, Mathias Palm, Cheng Liu, Yuan Tian, and Bo Zheng\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18589–18608, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18589-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18589-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses high-resolution nested-grid GEOS-Chem simulation, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning method, and the exposure–response relationship to determine the drivers and evaluate the health risks of the unexpected surface O3 enhancements over the Sichuan Basin in 2020. These unexpected O3 enhancements were induced by meteorological anomalies and caused dramatically high health risks.\n\nDevelopment and evaluation of a new compact mechanism for aromatic oxidation in atmospheric models\n\nKelvin H. Bates, Daniel J. Jacob, Ke Li, Peter D. Ivatt, Mat J. Evans, Yingying Yan, and Jintai Lin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18351–18374, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18351-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18351-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSimple aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene, xylene) have complex gas-phase chemistry that is inconsistently represented in atmospheric models. We compile recent experimental and theoretical insights to develop a new mechanism for gas-phase aromatic oxidation that is sufficiently compact for use in multiscale models. We compare our new mechanism to chamber experiments and other mechanisms, and implement it in a global model to quantify the impacts of aromatic oxidation on tropospheric chemistry.\n\nEstimating 2010â2015 anthropogenic and natural methane emissions in Canada using ECCC surface and GOSAT satellite observations\n\nSabour Baray, Daniel J. Jacob, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Jian-Xiong Sheng, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Dylan B. A. Jones, A. Anthony Bloom, and Robert McLaren\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18101–18121, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18101-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18101-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use 2010–2015 surface and satellite observations to disentangle methane from anthropogenic and natural sources in Canada. Using a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), the mismatch between modelled and observed methane concentrations can be used to infer emissions according to Bayesian statistics. Compared to prior knowledge, we show higher anthropogenic emissions attributed to energy and/or agriculture in Western Canada and lower natural emissions from Boreal wetlands.\n\nRelating geostationary satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over East Asia to fine particulate matter (PM2.5): insights from the KORUS-AQ aircraft campaign and GEOS-Chem model simulations\n\nShixian Zhai, Daniel J. Jacob, Jared F. Brewer, Ke Li, Jonathan M. Moch, Jhoon Kim, Seoyoung Lee, Hyunkwang Lim, Hyun Chul Lee, Su Keun Kuk, Rokjin J. Park, Jaein I. Jeong, Xuan Wang, Pengfei Liu, Gan Luo, Fangqun Yu, Jun Meng, Randall V. Martin, Katherine R. Travis, Johnathan W. Hair, Bruce E. Anderson, Jack E. Dibb, Jose L. Jimenez, Pedro Campuzano-Jost, Benjamin A. Nault, Jung-Hun Woo, Younha Kim, Qiang Zhang, and Hong Liao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16775–16791, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16775-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16775-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGeostationary satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) has tremendous potential for monitoring surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Our study explored the physical relationship between AOD and PM2.5 by integrating data from surface networks, aircraft, and satellites with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. We quantitatively showed that accurate simulation of aerosol size distributions, boundary layer depths, relative humidity, coarse particles, and diurnal variations in PM2.5 are essential.\n\nImpacts of emission changes in China from 2010 to 2017 on domestic and intercontinental air quality and health effect\n\nYuqiang Zhang, Drew Shindell, Karl Seltzer, Lu Shen, Jean-Francois Lamarque, Qiang Zhang, Bo Zheng, Jia Xing, Zhe Jiang, and Lei Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16051–16065, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16051-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16051-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we use a global chemical transport model to simulate the effects on global air quality and human health due to emission changes in China from 2010 to 2017. By performing sensitivity analysis, we found that the air pollution control policies not only decrease the air pollutant concentration but also bring significant co-benefits in air quality to downwind regions. The benefits for the improved air pollution are dominated by PM2.5.\n\nGrid-stretching capability for the GEOS-Chem 13.0.0 atmospheric chemistry model\n\nLiam Bindle, Randall V. Martin, Matthew J. Cooper, Elizabeth W. Lundgren, Sebastian D. Eastham, Benjamin M. Auer, Thomas L. Clune, Hongjian Weng, Jintai Lin, Lee T. Murray, Jun Meng, Christoph A. Keller, William M. Putman, Steven Pawson, and Daniel J. Jacob\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5977–5997, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5977-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5977-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric chemistry models like GEOS-Chem are versatile tools widely used in air pollution and climate studies. The simulations used in such studies can be very computationally demanding, and thus it is useful if the model can simulate a specific geographic region at a higher resolution than the rest of the globe. Here, we implement, test, and demonstrate a new variable-resolution capability in GEOS-Chem that is suitable for simulations conducted on supercomputers.\n\nGlobal distribution of methane emissions: a comparative inverse analysis of observations from the TROPOMI and GOSAT satellite instruments\n\nZhen Qu, Daniel J. Jacob, Lu Shen, Xiao Lu, Yuzhong Zhang, Tia R. Scarpelli, Hannah Nesser, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Joannes D. Maasakkers, A. Anthony Bloom, John R. Worden, Robert J. Parker, and Alba L. Delgado\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 14159–14175, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14159-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14159-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe recent launch of TROPOMI offers an unprecedented opportunity to quantify the methane budget from a top-down perspective. We use TROPOMI and the more mature GOSAT methane observations to estimate methane emissions and get consistent global budgets. However, TROPOMI shows biases over regions where surface albedo is small and provides less information for the coarse-resolution inversion due to the larger error correlations and spatial variations in the number of observations.\n\nGCAP 2.0: a global 3-D chemical-transport model framework for past, present, and future climate scenarios\n\nLee T. Murray, Eric M. Leibensperger, Clara Orbe, Loretta J. Mickley, and Melissa Sulprizio\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5789–5823, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5789-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5789-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChemical-transport models are tools used to study air pollution and inform public policy. However, they are limited by the availability of archived meteorology. Here, we describe how the GEOS-Chem chemical-transport model may now be driven by meteorology archived from a state-of-the-art general circulation model for past and future climates, allowing it to be used to explore the impact of climate change on air pollution and atmospheric composition.\n\nGlobal tropospheric halogen (Cl, Br, I) chemistry and its impact on oxidants\n\nXuan Wang, Daniel J. Jacob, William Downs, Shuting Zhai, Lei Zhu, Viral Shah, Christopher D. Holmes, TomÃ¡s Sherwen, Becky Alexander, Mathew J. Evans, Sebastian D. Eastham, J. Andrew Neuman, Patrick R. Veres, Theodore K. Koenig, Rainer Volkamer, L. Gregory Huey, Thomas J. Bannan, Carl J. Percival, Ben H. Lee, and Joel A. Thornton\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 13973–13996, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13973-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13973-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHalogen radicals have a broad range of implications for tropospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate. We present a new mechanistic description and comprehensive simulation of tropospheric halogens in a global 3-D model and compare the model results with surface and aircraft measurements. We find that halogen chemistry decreases the global tropospheric burden of ozone by 11 %, NOx by 6 %, and OH by 4 %.\n\nHarmonized Emissions Component (HEMCO) 3.0 as a versatile emissions component for atmospheric models: application in the GEOS-Chem, NASA GEOS, WRF-GC, CESM2, NOAA GEFS-Aerosol, and NOAA UFS models\n\nHaipeng Lin, Daniel J. Jacob, Elizabeth W. Lundgren, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Christoph A. Keller, Thibaud M. Fritz, Sebastian D. Eastham, Louisa K. Emmons, Patrick C. Campbell, Barry Baker, Rick D. Saylor, and Raffaele Montuoro\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5487–5506, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5487-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5487-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmissions are a central component of atmospheric chemistry models. The Harmonized Emissions Component (HEMCO) is a software component for computing emissions from a user-selected ensemble of emission inventories and algorithms. It allows users to select, add, and scale emissions from different sources through a configuration file with no change to the model source code. We demonstrate the implementation of HEMCO in several models, all sharing the same HEMCO core code and database library.\n\nAccelerating methane growth rate from 2010 to 2017: leading contributions from the tropics and East Asia\n\nYi Yin, Frederic Chevallier, Philippe Ciais, Philippe Bousquet, Marielle Saunois, Bo Zheng, John Worden, A. Anthony Bloom, Robert J. Parker, Daniel J. Jacob, Edward J. Dlugokencky, and Christian Frankenberg\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 12631–12647, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-12631-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-12631-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe growth of methane, the second-most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, has been accelerating in recent years. Using an ensemble of multi-tracer atmospheric inversions constrained by surface or satellite observations, we show that global methane emissions increased by nearly 1 % per year from 2010â2017, with leading contributions from the tropics and East Asia.\n\nReduced-cost construction of Jacobian matrices for high-resolution inversions of satellite observations of atmospheric composition\n\nHannah Nesser, Daniel J. Jacob, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Tia R. Scarpelli, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Yuzhong Zhang, and Chris H. Rycroft\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5521–5534, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5521-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5521-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnalytical inversions of satellite observations of atmospheric composition can improve emissions estimates and quantify errors but are computationally expensive at high resolutions. We propose two methods to decrease this cost. The methods reproduce a high-resolution inversion at a quarter of the cost. The reduced-dimension method creates a multiscale grid. The reduced-rank method solves the inversion where information content is highest.\n\nThe reduction in C2H6 from 2015 to 2020 over Hefei, eastern China, points to air quality improvement in China\n\nYouwen Sun, Hao Yin, Cheng Liu, Emmanuel Mahieu, Justus Notholt, Yao TÃ©, Xiao Lu, Mathias Palm, Wei Wang, Changgong Shan, Qihou Hu, Min Qin, Yuan Tian, and Bo Zheng\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 11759–11779, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-11759-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-11759-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe variability, sources, and transport of ethane (C2H6) over eastern China from 2015 to 2020 were studied using ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and GEOS-Chem simulations. C2H6 variability is driven by both meteorological and emission factors. The reduction in C2H6 in recent years over eastern China points to air quality improvement in China.\n\nAssessment of strict autumn-winter emission controls on air quality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region\n\nGongda Lu, Eloise A. Marais, Tuan V. Vu, Jingsha Xu, Zongbo Shi, James D. Lee, Qiang Zhang, Lu Shen, Gan Luo, and Fangqun Yu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-428,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-428, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmission controls were imposed in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei in northern China in autumn-winter 2017. We find that regional PM2.5 targets (15 % decrease relative to previous year) were exceeded. Our analysis shows that decline in precursor emissions only leads to less than half (43 %) the improved air quality. Most of the change (57 %) is due to interannual variability in meteorology. Stricter emission controls may be necessary in years with unfavourable meteorology.\n\nReduced light absorption of black carbon (BC) and its influence on BC-boundary-layer interactions during âAPEC Blueâ\n\nMeng Gao, Yang Yang, Hong Liao, Bin Zhu, Yuxuan Zhang, Zirui Liu, Xiao Lu, Chen Wang, Qiming Zhou, Yuesi Wang, Qiang Zhang, Gregory R.

In this study, we used the online coupled WRF-Chem model to examine how emission control measures during the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference affect the mixing state and light absorption of BC and the associated implications for BC-PBL interactions.\n\nGrid-independent high-resolution dust emissions (v1.0) for chemical transport models: application to GEOS-Chem (12.5.0)\n\nJun Meng, Randall V.
