        "text": "'Rarely do authors make substantial contributions to two major fields of academic discourse in a single book, but that is exactly what Peberdy does. This fresh new work will inspire a generation of students.'\n\nChoice Outstanding Academic Title 2013.\n\n'This is a hugely enjoyable and scholarly consideration of an under-written area of film studies, which simultaneously draws intelligently from and moves beyond existing theorisations of film performance.'\n\n- Lisa Purse, University of Reading, UK\n\n'Peberdy's insightful and original examination of male 'angst' in the cinema makes a compelling case for the importance of historical context in understanding performances that take place both on and off the screen.'\n\n- Jacob Smith, Northwestern University, USA\n\n'This genuinely interdisciplinary work includes some of the most penetrating analysis of identity in contemporary American film that I have read in the last few years. Peberdy's focus on performances of 'male angst' breathes new life into debates over the intersection of Hollywood cinema and the politics of identity. Film is expertly put into the context of political debates over masculinity and fatherhood, while never losing sight of real audiences and our fascination with viewing male angst.'\n\n- Jude Davies, University of Winchester, UK"
