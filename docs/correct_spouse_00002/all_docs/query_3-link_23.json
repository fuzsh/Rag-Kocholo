        "text": "If you’re a celebrity news follower, chances are you’ve seen many headlines detailing celebrity prenups. While prenups have a wide array of uses amongst people of every income level, they’re especially popular for celebrities who have many assets. Of course, it’s no surprise that famous and rich celebrities want to protect their assets before they get married.\n\nHave you heard about one of these popular celebrity prenups? Chances are you may not have heard about their interesting components. While not every celebrity has a prenup, most do. Even those who do not want one are generally advised to by their staff, in the best interests of protecting their wealth.\n\nGet your gossip on while you learn about the unusual conditions of some of these celebrity prenups. From clauses about cheating and weight limits to limits on illegal drug consumption, celebrity prenups always include the most complex and detailed statements. Some of these are so complex, you’ll wonder how they even thought of them!\n\nNot only are these interesting to read about, but they can help debunk common prenup myths. Keep reading as we dive into some of the weirdest celebrity prenups in the media.\n\nWhy do Celebrity Prenups Matter?\n\nOf course, fame comes with money. Therefore, prenups are so popular amongst celebrities. However, there is another reason why you’re likely to hear about celebrity prenups.\n\nIt comes down to statistics. According to a UK study done by Marriage Foundation, celebrities often have a 40% divorce rate within ten years. Compared to the general population, this is double! Only one in five (or 20%) of couples are divorced after ten years. Other studies have suggested that the celebrity divorce right may be higher, with some even exceeding 50%.\n\nMany people wonder why they’re always hearing about quick marriages and fast divorces in the headlines. The higher divorce rate amongst celebrities explains it!\n\nAre Celebrity Prenups the same as Standard Prenups?\n\nA prenup has the same basic purpose, regardless of who it is for. However, celebrity prenups are often far more complex and have many more pages of details than regular prenups. This comes down to the fact that those celebrities have so many more assets to protect than most non-celebrities.\n\nDue to their rich and famous lifestyle, celebrity marriages have more at stake than most common people. As they continue to grow, they’re often concerned with what will happen to the additional wealth they acquire during the marriage.\n\n1. Britney Spears\n\nBritney Spears has recently announced she is pregnant! Britney and her fiancé, Sam Asghari, have recently been discussed in the news as they prepare a prenuptial agreement before their marriage. Due to the status of both two celebrities, a prenup is a great idea in their specific case.\n\nHowever, their prenup is taking so long to create! Sam is outlining extremely specific details, saying that he wants increases in 5-year increments of what he would get in the event of a divorce. Sources say that Britney is allowing her professional team to tackle this and is busy with wedding planning.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of Britney Spears, her previous husband should be mentioned too. In 2004, Britney and Kevin Federline were married for just five months. Good thing they had a prenup, which was long and detailed. However, it was later revealed there was no legal validity to this prenup.\n\n2. Brooklyn Beckham\n\nDavid Beckham’s son, has recently signed a prenup with his soon-to-be wife Nicola Peltz. Brooklyn is David Beckham’s oldest son with fashion designer Victoria Beckham. Brooklyn has done quite a bit of diversified activities as a celebrity, including modeling, photography, and professional cooking.\n\nBrooklyn and Nicola’s prenuptial agreement is designed to protect Brooklyn’s parents’ fortune. The couple completed their prenup before getting married in April 2022. While Brooklyn’s wife, Nicola, has a significant family fortune herself (Over $1.7 Billion), compared to the Beckham’s estimated net worth of around $450 million.\n\n3. Jay Z and Beyonce\n\nBefore their marriage, Jay Z and Beyonce mutually signed a prenup to secure both of their assets. The terms of this agreement are complicated, which states that Jay Z must pay Beyonce an extra $5 million for each child they have, with an additional $1 million for every year of marriage.\n\nSince then, the couple has had three children! That interesting clause will help protect Beyonce in the event of a divorce. The terms of this agreement are only valid for 15 years, which is coming up in 2023. Fans would certainly be disappointed to hear this power couple discuss splitting up.\n\n4. Halle Berry and Oliver Martinez\n\nHalle Berry, an actress, and Oliver Martinez, a French film actor, took an interesting approach when creating their prenup. The couple split into good terms, indicating they want to move forward with love and respect for their son.\n\nThe terms of their prenup indicate that no support would be given to either party. This means they’ve opted to keep everything separate. However, it was said that they would re-addressed child support later.\n\n5. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\n\nWhen Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split, they were certainly glad to have a prenup in place. It is rumored that the cause of divorce was alleged adultery. The couple has six children, all of which were protected under the terms of the prenup.\n\nBrad and Angelina are both entitled to their pre-union earnings, but anything after the union is to go into a trust for their six children.\n\n6. Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel\n\nThis interesting prenup involves a cheating clause! If Justin Timberlake cheats, Jessica receives $500,000. The cheating clause caused some havoc at the time, however, there is also a provision in their prenup that says Jessica will only consider having children with Justin if remains faithful.\n\nThis unique prenup is probably why prenups are given a bad rap! Most prenups have nothing to do with cheating or infidelity. In addition, it’s nearly impossible to legally enforce the terms of a cheating prenup clause.\n\n7. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban\n\nSince 2006, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban have been happily married. After 15 years, this couple is unlikely to get divorced. However, they do have a prenup in place in case the situation changes. When interviewed, the couple said they didn’t plan on pursuing a prenup before they got married.\n\nHowever, most celebrities have smart advisors to give their two cents. Nicole Kidman’s advisor urged her to consider a prenup before her marriage to Keith. One interesting clause in this agreement is unique! Based on Keith’s past drug addiction, Nicole will get $640,000 for every year they’re married if were to use illegal drugs again. That is certainly another incentive to stay away from drugs!\n\n8. Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise’s prenup is a good example of when celebrity prenups can be whacky. If the couple were to be married for 11 years, Katie would receive half of Tom’s money. However, these two were only married for about six years before they split.\n\nThe terms of this prenup also included child support for their daughter, which is an annual sum of $400,000.\n\n9. J Lo and Ben Affleck\n\nJ Lo and Ben Affleck were supposed to get married 20 years ago, but the wedding was called off. Now, the couple has given marriage another shot with a shocking prenup agreement. Jennifer Lopez has some interesting demands included in the prenup, which even outlines how often the couple should have intimacy.\n\nSome fans find this prenup clause to be quite ridiculous, while others are incomplete support. Chances are you and your partner won’t need these crazy prenup clauses!\n\n10. Jessica Simpson and Tony Romo\n\nDallas Cowboys star Tony Romo and Jessica Simpson never actually ended up getting married. As they prepared for marriage, they drew up a prenuptial agreement that was interesting. The clause outlined that Jessica was not allowed to weigh over 135 pounds during the relationship. This insane clause is another reason people think negatively of prenups! The prenup stated that if Jessica went over 135 pounds, she would owe Tony $500,000 for every pound above 135.\n\nIf there is one thing to take away from this insane prenup clause, is to think clearly about a prenup before signing. Never agree to something as controlling and cruel as this prenup clause.\n\nWhat It All Means\n\nWhat does a prenup mean in a marriage? While it is certainly interesting to read about celebrity prenups, it is important to remember to keep it in perspective. The world of celebrity news is a fascinating one, however, it is most unrealistic for the lives of common people. With celebrities, prenups can seem complicated and overwhelming. This is because their many assets and wealth make it complicated. In addition, some celebrities include things that simply shouldn’t be in prenups, such as weight or intimacy rules.\n\nRemember that creating a prenup is simple and easy for most non-celebrities. Unless you have billions worth of complicated wealth, creating a prenup for yourself will be nothing like what you read in the media. Celebrities give their prenup far more time, though, money, and dedication than you’ll need to."
