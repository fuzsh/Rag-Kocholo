        "text": "Saturday\n\nJuly 20, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3620\n\ntoday should be......fun?\n\nIf the weather that's predicted to reach Scotland on Saturday does, in fact, find its way there, the British Open is going to look like...well...the British Open.\n\nRain, gusts of wind near 30 MPH, and a day of golfing-survival are in the offing for those fortunate to make the 36-hole cut and play on Royal Troon this weekend.\n\nSunday is calling for no rain, but winds in the 20's and 30's, still. In other words, a \"proper Scottish day\" as they say over there.\n\nToday, though, might be an afternoon for the ages. There's no telling what a good score might be today: 72? 74? Who knows what havoc the weather will create in the third round.\n\nThen again, the weather could make an abrupt shift over there as it often does and scoring could be easier, which would open up a number of possibilities.\n\nShane Lowry, an Irishman who won the Open Championship at Royal Portrush five years ago, is atop the leaderboard at 7 under par through 36 holes. Two other guys who know a thing or two about wind and rain are at 5-under par and two shots back; Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, both of England.\n\nScottie Scheffler is right there in the mix at 2-under with identical rounds of 70-70 to start the year's final major.\n\nTV analyst Paul McGinley summed up Scheffler perfectly on Friday evening as the winds started to perk up at Troon: \"He's just like a thoroughbred racehorse. He paces himself. He knows the only thing that matters is who crosses the finish line first. He'll pick away at the course here and there, make birdies when he can, and do his best to not make any big numbers. He's still the guy to beat in this championship.\"\n\nScheffler has another American with him at 2-under, Billy Horschel. Those two share joint 4th place with South African Dean Burmester.\n\nOther Americans hanging around include Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay (both at -1), along with Dustin Johnson and Colin Morikawa (+1).\n\nGiven the expected weather over the weekend, it's realistic to give anyone who made the cut (6 over par) a chance to win the Claret Jug. Sure, Max Homa (who made a 40-foot putt on #18 on Friday to make the cut on the number) probably has less of a chance than, say, than the guys at +2 like Tom Hoge, Gary Woodland and a #DMD pick, Matthieu Pavon.\n\nBut anyone who made the cut is still alive, particularly if those near the back of the leaderboard can somehow piece together an (unexpected) round in the 60's on Saturday.\n\nThe list of those who missed the cut at Troon is far more impressive than the list of guys who are actually playing all four rounds.\n\nWill Zalatoris, Bryson DeChambeau, Tommy Fleetwood, Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland, Tony Finau, Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods are all heading home after 36 holes.\n\nMcIlroy was listless on Thursday and Friday, shooting 78 and 75 to earn his early trip home.\n\nFinau was in great shape after an opening round 71, then blew up with an 81 on Friday. For all the hype surrounding Finau, he's starting to cement his reputation as a guy who can't get it done under the pressure of major championship golf.\n\nTiger's play on Friday (77) was a smidgen better than Thursday, but only because he was able to hole a few more putts. Off the tee he was wildly ineffective. Woods played in all four majors this year and missed the cut in the last three of them. He did make the cut and play all four days at Augusta back in April, but that didn't do anything for the rest of his golf in 2024.\n\nThere were two surprising departures on Friday, but not because of their golf, per se.\n\nJohn Daly and Ernie Els -- both of whom won the Claret Jug in their careers -- shot 82 on Thursday and promptly withdrew from this year's event prior to starting round two on Friday.\n\nThat Daly quit isn't a surprise. That Els would quit is a bit of shock to the system, though. Not cool.\n\nLet's get back to the good players who didn't quit.\n\nLowry is known as a solid front runner. Whether he can hold on for two more days remains to be seen, but this year's Open is looking a little like last year's, when Brian Harman led by 5 shots after both day and day three and waltzed to a remarkably easy 5-shot victory for his first major title.\n\nIf Lowry can shoot something around par again today, you'd think he'd a 54 hole lead heading into Sunday's final round.\n\nBut there's a lot of golf to play and some nasty weather on the horizon. Anything is still possible.\n\nA trio of LIV golfers (Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka) are situated nicely at 1-over par. All three of those guys have major championships. None, though, have won the British Open. A win for any of those three would give them the \"3 quarters grand slam\".\n\nJohnson would only have to win the PGA to capture all four majors.\n\nRahm, too, would only have to capture the PGA.\n\nAnd Koepka would need to win at the Masters to win all four of golf's majors.\n\nAny of those three could win this weekend and it wouldn't be a shock at all.\n\nLet the weather roll in and let's see who survives.\n\nThe Orioles got off to a nice second half start last night with a 9-1 thrashing of the Rangers in Arlington, Texas.\n\nAnthony Santander hit two homers for O's and Adley Rutschman and Colton Cowser both homered as well. Gunnar Henderson didn't homer but he did have four hits, much to the chagrin of any of us (err, I mean, \"you\") who had a 3-way homer wager of Henderson, Rutschman and Santander.\n\nThanks for nuthin', Gunnar.\n\nCorbin Burnes picked up the win and, other than walking four batters, was his usual sharp self. That dude is a terrific pitcher. Let's just hope it's a National League team that lands him this off-season and not the Yankees or Red Sox.\n\nOh, and speaking of \"landing somewhere\", it's going to be interesting to see what kind of free agent deal Anthony Santander can cook up this winter. The All Star right fielder now has 26 homers and 63 RBI on the season, heading briskly in the direction of a 40 homer campaign that should make him very, very wealthy in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThe most-discussed O's deal this past week was the pursuit of Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal, who will fetch Detroit a mighty sum if industry experts who predict these things are accurate about what Skubal might be worth to a contending team.\n\nThat the O's are likely going to lose Corbin Burnes could make the Skubal deal even that much more attractive to Mike Elias. Skubal would join Grayson Rodriguez at the top of the O's rotation next season and give them one of the best best 1-2 combos in all of baseball.\n\nBut what would it take to get him? Jackson Holliday? Would he have to be in the deal?\n\nWhat about some combination of Cowser, Westburg, Mayo, Norby, Stowers, Povich, McDermott?\n\nWait, here's one: Detroit gets Urias, Mullins, Mateo and Dillon Tate. The O's get Tarik Skubal.\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nWell, not about getting Skubal. I think that's something the Birds should pursue. Urias, Mullins, Mateo and Tate might not even get you Nathan Eovaldi from Texas, the starter the O's clobbered last night in Arlington.\n\nThe oddest dilemma about a deal that would involve Jackson Holliday is that you'd potentially be shipping off a player who is totally unproven at the Major League level (Holliday) for a proven, sturdy, and very promising starting pitcher (Skubal).\n\nBut, Jackson Holliday might be Gunnar Henderson in 18 months. Who knows?\n\nThis is why Mike Elias makes the big bucks. He has to play the game with the Tigers (and all other teams) and figure out what his best course of action is with Skubal, who most certainly would enhance the chances that Baltimore sometime very soon finally gets to watch a World Series in person for the first time since 1983.\n\nFriday\n\nJuly 19, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3619\n\nfriday stuff\n\nOK, so Michael Phelps is the #1 athlete of the last 25 years and Tiger Woods shot 79 in round one of the British Open yesterday and isn't going to make the cut at Troon.\n\nNeither of those can be surprising.\n\nPhelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of our lifetime with 28 total medals and 23 gold medals in his incredible career. When ESPN.com started circulating the Top 100 list earlier this week, everyone assumed Phelps would be a contender for the top spot and a slam dunk Top 5 finisher at the very least.\n\nHe wound up #1 when the list was finalized and published on Thursday.\n\nGiving in to pressure they've somehow managed to help create, ESPN.com went with Serena Williams at #2 rather than at #6 or #7 where she rightfully belongs.\n\nLionel Messi came in at #3, another attempt by ESPN.com to show how \"worldly\" they are, even though LeBron (#4) and Tom Brady (#5) are far more accomplished.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 were Federer (#6), Simone Biles (#7), Tiger Woods (#8), Usain Bolt (#9) and Kobe Bryant (#10).\n\nThe Top 5 were fine, even though Serena was misplaced.\n\nThe \"next 5\" were incredibly out of whack. But that's probably what ESPN.com wanted in the first place. All by design, in other words.\n\n\"What should we do with Simone Biles?\" Bill asked.\n\n\"I don't know, we have enough basketball players in the Top 25, don't we?\" replied Dave.\n\n\"Uh, she's a gymnast,\" said Bill.\n\n\"My bad,\" Dave countered. \"I remember her now. She's the one that quit gymnastics a few years ago.\"\n\n\"Let's put her at #7, ahead of people like Tiger, Kobe and Novak Djokovic. That will really get the readers going,\" Bill reasoned.\n\n\"That's why we're doing this in the first place, right? I love it. Put Biles at #7 then,\" Dave stated.\n\nYou can debate Phelps, Brady and LeBron and put them in any order and I'd probably not argue with you. I see the merits of all three.\n\nComing up next week at ESPN.com: The Top 100 who didn't make The Top 100 list.\n\nDon't worry, we already know Lamar Jackson is #1 on that list.\n\nAs for Tiger and his play at Troon yesterday (and today, he's halfway through his 2nd round as #DMD publishes), I can't imagine there's anyone at all who was (is) surprised by it, Woods included.\n\n\"I just need to play tournaments,\" Tiger said yesterday after his 8-over-par 79.\n\n\"In some ways I've made a lot of progress this year, even though my results don't show it. But I need to play more events next year so I'm sharper in the majors.\"\n\nThat issue -- as I've written here time and time again over the last four years -- is the primary reason why Woods is no longer competitive in professional golf.\n\nHe's no longer a great putter, either. That's the other reason. But more on that in a minute.\n\nTiger has been trying to catch lightning in a bottle ever since the car accident in 2021 that nearly took his life. He's no longer physically able to play a busy schedule, instead opting to \"ramp up\" his game in advance of the Masters, PGA, U.S. Open and British Open tournaments.\n\nThat formula simply doesn't work. It wouldn't work for Scheffler, Rory, Schauffele, Cantlay or anyone else in their 20's or 30's. It's certainly not going to work for a 48-year old guy with one leg who has had 10 surgeries in the last 10 years.\n\nTiger isn't completely wrong with his assessment of his 2024 play. His \"data\" from tee-to-green isn't terrible. He's not Tiger of 2000, 2005 or 2010, but Father Time is undefeated. You're also getting older, too. We all are. A downturn in performance was always going to happen.\n\nThe prevailing thought with Tiger always was his \"B game\" -- at age 45, let's say -- would still be good enough to beat the \"kids\" coming out on the PGA Tour. And that might have been true, too. But we haven't seen his \"B game\" since the car accident. He's barely played to a Korn Ferry Tour level.\n\nAll that said, Tiger's biggest problem on the course is the other thing I've been talking about and writing about for well over five years now. Even before the 2021 car accident.\n\nHe's no longer a great putter.\n\nAnd if you're a believer in the data, it would tell you he's barely a \"good\" putter any longer. He's become, much to his horror, I'm sure, an \"average TOUR putter\".\n\nThere were two undeniable things about Tiger during his career zenith and they were the reasons why he joined Sam Snead as the sport's all-time winningest player with 82 wins.\n\nHe chewed up the par 5 holes in every tournament he played.\n\nHe made more putts inside of 10 feet than anyone else. Ever.\n\nBoth of those attributes no longer exist.\n\nIn the first two rounds alone, he missed numerous six foot putts. He was never going to win, of course, but a 79 is really a 75 if you make four of those shorties. And even though he's playing a hair better in his second round on Friday, he's still missing too many putts to have any kind of chance to post a reasonable score.\n\nJust now, I watched him stripe it down the fairway on a hole on the back nine and leave himself 120 yards to the hole.\n\n\"Old\" Tiger hits the approach shot from 120 yards to 12 feet and rolls that in for birdie, waving to the crowd and forcing the TV commentators to say, \"My, my, that man sure does know how to attack a golf course, doesn't he?\"\n\nToday's Tiger hit a shot that found the left corner of the green. He then putted from 35 feet and rolled the birdie effort past the hole by five or six feet. And then he missed the par putt and walked away with a bogey.\n\nI would never say Tiger is done. I watched Phil Mickelson win the PGA Championship at age 50. Now, sure, Phil's in much better shape than Woods will be when he turns 50 in December of 2025. But these guys aren't running marathons. They're playing golf.\n\nSo, while I won't go as far as saying Tiger is \"done\", I'll just keep saying what I've been saying for the last few years.\n\nHe can't compete and he can't win if he doesn't play tournament golf.\n\nThis four-times-a-year thing where he tries to magically pull a rabbit out of his hat at the major championships is a failure-waiting-to-happen.\n\nAnd if I know that, Tiger certainly knows it as well.\n\nHe even said as much yesterday.\n\nAs for the tournament itself, Royal Troon is the early winner two days into the season's final major championship.\n\nThe golf course is phenomenal.\n\nThere are hard holes, easy holes, long holes and short holes. And funny enough, the shortest hole (#8, par 3, 110 yards or so) is one of the hardest holes.\n\nThere's a lot of golf left to be played on Friday but the guess here is that someone will lead at day's end with a score of 7 under. Bad weather is rolling in for Saturday and it promises to be, as they like to say over there, a \"proper Open Championship day\". The weather will be better on Sunday for the final round.\n\nSomeone named Daniel Brown finished the first round as the leader at 6-under par. Never heard of him? Don't worry, neither has anyone else. And, no, he's not going to be Ben Curtis or Todd Hamilton, two other guys you never heard of until they won the British Open out of nowhere a long time ago.\n\nThere aren't any other storylines percolating just yet. Billy Horschel (a #DMD pick) is the very early clubhouse leader through 36 holes at 2-under par. He finished playing at 7:30 am EST on Friday.\n\nShane Lowry sits around 7 under par and on top of the leaderboard midway through the second round but he just hit his 2nd shot at #11 into an area of the course where you could play until Christmas and never be able to hit your ball from there.\n\nSomething tells me Lowry will hang around until Sunday when he'll fire and fall back.\n\nScottie Scheffler is hanging around, as is Patrick Cantlay. Justin Thomas was very solid on Thursday but plays late on Friday, when the weather is apparently going to start moving in.\n\nThere's a lot of golf left. The leaderboard after round two will tell us more, since the cut falls after 36 holes. Anyone not making the cut heads home, anyone who gets to play the weekend still has a chance.\n\nfaith in sports\n\nThis week's MLB All-Star Game featured a number of players who openly share their faith when given the opportunity.\n\nOne of those players was Yankees star Aaron Judge.\n\nWe love to spotlight athletes who are willing to take the microphone and glorify God and his son, Jesus Christ. We're not overly thrilled about spotlighting a Yankee in these parts. But we're OK with making an exception this time around.\n\nWatch what Judge and other MLB stars had to say in the video below.\n\nThanks, as always, to our friends at Freestate Electrical for their continued support of #DMD and \"Faith in Sports\" here every Friday.\n\nThursday\n\nJuly 18, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3618\n\nand #1 is......\n\nUnlike yesterday morning, when I had the opportunity to wait until just after 8 AM to see ESPN.com's list of the top 26-50 athletes of the last 25 years, I don't have time to hang around this morning and wait for them to unveil their final 25.\n\nIt's probably better that way, honestly.\n\nIt's 5:50 AM as I write this. I've been up since 2:00 AM watching the British Open. Below you're going to see my top 5. If this Thursday morning was of the \"normal\" variety, I'd wait to see who they release as their top 5 and then I'd spend 45 minutes tearing into ESPN.com.\n\nThis way, I can tear into them tomorrow.\n\nMy top 5 are below.\n\nYou won't agree with them, which is part of the fun, actually.\n\nI don't agree with about 80% of the list I've seen from ESPN.com thus far. Far, far too many women's basketball players, for starters. And simply way too many soccer players in general.\n\nAs I've alluded to this week, several of the misplaced athletes led me to know, right away, the ESPN.com list was a comical attempt at appeasing everyone.\n\nThere's beyond zero chance that a list of the top 100 athletes of the last 25 years can have the best hockey player (Ovechkin), best baseball hitter (Ichiro) and best baseball athlete (Ohtani) outside of the top 25. Alas, they did. But, hey, Tamika Catchings came in at #37, so ESPN.com has that going for them......which is nice.\n\nAnyway, here's the way I see it.\n\nThere are pretty much five non-negotiable athletes that have to be in ESPN.com's top 10 somewhere; LeBron James, Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes, Michael Phelps and Novak Djokovic.\n\nSwimmer Katie Ledecky will be in the top 25. Maybe as high as #15 or so.\n\nSeeing those listed so far and realizing that Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer aren't yet listed in the 100-26 range (Andy Murray is the highest ranked tennis player so far at #80) tells me that FOUR tennis players (adding in Djokovic) will be in the top 25. That's a lot of tennis players.\n\nTiger Woods is going to be in the top 25 as well. He'll be the only golfer, I'm guessing, since Phil Mickelson has already been listed.\n\nLamar Jackson has to be in the Top 25, right? I realize he hasn't even played one decade, let alone two, but he's one of the best athletes in all of sports right now. Right?\n\nSteph Curry is in there somewhere as well, probably around #20.\n\nLionel Messi will most certainly be in the top 10. I assume another soccer player, Cristiano Ronaldo, will also be in the top 25.\n\nThat's 14 people right there.\n\nI'm missing 11.\n\nIs it a boxer? MMA/UFC fighter? Would they put someone like professional wrestler John Cena in there? I doubt it. But they have a female soccer player named Marta ahead of Ray Lewis, Derek Jeter and Shohei Ohtani, so if that's possible, it's very possible to have John Cena at, say, #24.\n\nAlso, don't discount ESPN.com doing something goofy like listing hot dog eating champion Joey Chestnut at #23. 75 hot dogs, man. No one else in the world can do that in 10 minutes execpt for Joey.\n\nI'm sure there's a no-brainer I'm simply forgetting. It's 4:04 am and I'm watching golf and working on my 3rd cup of coffee. Take it easy on me.\n\nAnyway...\n\nThe moment you've been waiting for has arrived.\n\nMy personal top 5:\n\n5. Messi\n\n4. Tiger\n\n3. Brady\n\n2. Phelps\n\n1. LeBron\n\nYou can mix those five up any way you want and roll them out and whatever order they end up would be fine. Messi is the best soccer player ever. Yes, better than Pele.\n\nTiger's the best golfer ever. Yes, better than Jack.\n\nBrady's the best QB ever. Yes, better than Montana, Unitas and anyone else.\n\nPhelps is the best swimmer, period.\n\nAnd while I'm not sure LeBron is the best basketball player ever (he has a lot of competition for that honor), there's no doubt he's the best of the last 25 years.\n\nAnd my personal methodology when putting something like this together is I always ask myself, \"Could that guy play some other sport?\"\n\nI think LeBron could have been a NFL player. Or a baseball player. He's Deion Sanders x 3.\n\nMy point, though, is I think those are the best 5 and you can put them in order you want and I'd be OK with it.\n\nI think Djokovic deserves Top 5 consideration as well.\n\nSo, too, does Serena Williams.\n\nPatrick Mahomes doesn't deserve top 5 right now, but he's as athletic as anyone who has played that position...and...he's a winner.\n\nI'll wait anxiously to see the 1-25 list that ESPN.com publishes on Thursday. And I'll be here on Friday to tell you how nuts they were for putting LeBron at #7 or Tiger at #15 or Katie Ledecky at #6.\n\n\"Randy On The O's\"\n\nRandy Morgan takes #DMD readers through the recent week in Orioles baseball as the Birds try to win a second straight A.L. East title.\n\no's midseason review\n\nSince we’ve reached the All-Star break, today we’ll review the Orioles first “half” of the season in lieu of our usual question of the week.\n\nDespite the disappointing week leading into the All-Star break, the Orioles first “half” was still massively successful.\n\nWith the wild win over New York last Sunday, the team finished atop the AL East, one game ahead of the Yankees. They also finished tied for the most wins in the American League, only trailing the Phillies in the entire league, with the third best win percentage in all of MLB.\n\nThe Orioles were also one of the best teams against tough competition, with the second most wins against teams over .500.\n\nEven after the poor final week, the team is on pace for about 97 to 98 wins. Fangraphs has them as a near lock for the playoffs, with a 96% chance of at least getting a Wild Card. The site gives them just a 43.4% chance of winning the division, slightly favoring the Yankees despite their recent tailspin.\n\nAlthough you couldn’t tell from watching last week, the Orioles offense was among the very best in the league in the first half of the ‘24 campaign.\n\nThe O’s finished first in MLB in Baseball Reference’s OPS+, which adjusts for park effects. They were second in Fangraphs’ similar wRC+ statistic. They had the top hard hit percentage in the league and were second in average exit velocity, with a near league average batting average on balls in play, suggesting the success is no mirage or matter of luck.\n\nIf you wanted to nitpick the offense, they have struggled a bit in clutch situations, where they were top of the league last season.\n\nThe O’s are 18th in Fangraphs’ “Clutch” hitting stat and just 19th in the league in batting average with runners in scoring position. They have been one of the worst teams in the league at scoring runners from third base with less than two outs as well.\n\nThe Birds have also been less patient at the plate than in past seasons, placing a league average 14th in on-base percentage and 22nd in BB/K ratio. Though this has been more than made up for by a league leading slugging percentage and home run total.\n\nOn the other hand, the Orioles pitching has not been nearly as elite. While they rank a solid 6th in ERA, they are around league average (15th) in ERA+, which adjusts for park effects. The O’s are 10th in runs allowed per game and 10th in K/BB ratio.\n\nThey are 7th in Fielding Independent Pitching, which suggests they aren’t over-reliant on defense or luck. The pitchers have been roughly league average in both exit velocity and hard hit percentage allowed.\n\nThe starters have been better than the bullpen thus far, with starter ERA ranking 5th in the league, led by Corbin Burnes who is in line to start the All-Star game. Meanwhile, the bullpen ERA is 14th in the league, leaving ample room for improvement.\n\nAs we look ahead to the second “half” of the season and the upcoming trade deadline, the Orioles' needs are clear; they have to improve their pitching.\n\nWhile it initially looked like Albert Suarez, Cade Povich and Cole Irvin may be able to exceed expectations and secure the back half of the rotation, it has now been made clear that none are a suitable replacement for the missing Kyle Bradish and John Means.\n\nThe front office will not sit on their hands. There are surely moves to be made in the coming weeks. The team will likely add at least one starter and one reliever before the deadline.\n\nHopefully they can be much more impactful than Jack Flaherty and Shintaro Fujinami were last season. With a deep and talented farm system, the O’s should be able to secure a few valuable pieces to boost their chances down the stretch this season.\n\nOrioles Midseason MVP: Gunnar Henderson\n\nWhile the Player of the Week award has often been difficult to hand out with so many strong contributors among the mostly winning weeks, the midseason MVP is a no-brainer in Birdland.\n\nGunnar Henderson has not only been the Orioles MVP, but the second-year star is in a head to head battle with Aaron Judge as frontrunners for the AL MVP.\n\nHenderson entered the All-Star break 2nd in WAR at both Fangraphs and Baseball Reference, slightly behind Judge in both cases.\n\nWhile Judge has been better at the plate, Gunnar has also provided top notch defense at the most important position on the field. Gunnar hasn’t been shabby with the bat either, finishing the weekend with a .286/.373/.584 slash line, good for a 174 OPS+ (74% better than average). He has smashed 28 home runs and leads MLB in runs scored with 78.\n\nIt has been a long time since we’ve had a baseball player like Gunnar in Baltimore. He has been a joy to watch day in and day out and we are certainly lucky to have perennial MVP candidates leading both teams in town.\n\nIn addition to Gunnar, Corbin Burnes certainly deserves an honorable mention for this award. The ace acquired from Milwaukee in the offseason has been everything the Orioles could have expected.\n\nBurnes finished the half with a 2.43 ERA, good for second best in the American League and he sits at 5th in MLB with a 154 ERA+, which is adjusted for ballparks.\n\nBurnes has been the picture of consistency, cranking out quality start after quality start and putting the O’s in position to win nearly every game he starts. The O’s will have no worries about sending Burnes out to start game one of any playoff series. The only drama with Burnes will be whether the new owner opens up the pocket book to keep him around beyond this season.\n\nWednesday\n\nJuly 17, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3617\n\nand the winner is...\n\nIf today's edition of #DMD is focusing on a \"winner\", I can tell you for sure who it isn't a winner: The person that designed those All-Star Game uniforms.\n\nAnd the person within Major League Baseball who looked at those and gave his/her approval? Not a winner as well.\n\nThose uniforms were awful.\n\nThat's pretty much all the commentary I have on the game. I watched a total of about 20 pitches. It's just not my thing.\n\nI've written here on numerous occasions about how treasured the All-Star Game was in my younger days. It was one of the best sports nights of the year.\n\nAlas, there's a saying: All good things must come to an end. And that's what happened to the All-Star Game. It used to be good. It no longer is.\n\nThe American League won, 5-3, by the way. Good for them.\n\nWe started our review and discussion of ESPN.com's Top 100 Athletes here yesterday, and the first two curveballs were in the 51-75 category that was released on Tuesday morning.\n\nAlex Ovechkin at #54 and Shohei Ohtani at #62.\n\nWe'll get to Ray Lewis and J.J. Watt in a minute, don't worry.\n\nI'm not confused about Ovechkin at #54 because he's a Capital and they're my favorite team, ever.\n\nAnd it will really stand out as an awful spot for Ovi once we see today's list of those from 50-26. There will be at least a dozen head-scratchers on that list above him, I'm guessing.\n\nI'm confused because he is, without argument, either the first or second best hockey player in the world over the last 25 years. He has been the NHL's version of Lionel Messi, who is likely going to fall somewhere in the Top 35, I'm figuring.\n\nUnless something dramatically wacky happens, he will become the NHL's all-time leading scorer sometime in October or November of 2025.\n\nNow, perhaps that blunder is just ESPN.com's way of gently telling us they don't follow and/or value hockey all that much. If so, no worries there. I don't follow the WNBA all that much, so I'm out of touch on that league just like ESPN is apparently out of touch with what Ovechkin has done over the last two decades.\n\nI will have to see the rest of the list to figure out where I think Ovechkin should be, but he's a clearly a Top 20 athlete at the very least.\n\nAs for Ohtani...\n\nI have no idea what to make of his insertion at #62 on the list but I can only assume it's a \"service\" issue with him and nothing else. He hasn't even been around for 10 years, which probably made it hard for them to put him in the Top 10 where he clearly belongs.\n\nIf, in fact, we're talking about athleticism ONLY and we're putting more stock in what they can do over what their statistical accomplishments are (were), Ohtani is perhaps the best athlete we've seen over the last 25 years.\n\nHe could be #1.\n\nHe can throw a baseball 100 MPH and hit a 450 foot home run, on the same night, like he did in Baltimore back in May of 2023.\n\nI'm not sure when he'll have the opportunity to pitch again, but there could very well come a day when Ohtani throws a no hitter on the same night he also hits the game-winning home run in the bottom of the 8th inning. He's Babe Ruth in modern times. Having Ohtani at #62 was beyond bizarre.\n\nAs for the J.J. Watt (#58) and Ray Lewis (#61) debate, it's not about where they both fall on the list. Football experts might say -- and be right -- that Watt was more stellar at his position than was Lewis at his. Maybe. I don't really care. We're talking three spots, anyway.\n\nBut for those two football stalwarts to fall behind Alexia Putellas at #56 is, right now, ESPN.com's #clownshoes moment of the list thus far.\n\nIf you think Steve Nash was better at basketball than Ray Lewis was at football, have at it.\n\nBut to suggest, in any way, that Alexia Putellas should rank ahead of Watt, Lewis and the greatest relief pitcher in baseball history, Mariano Rivera, is the ultimate attempt at pandering to the masses.\n\n\"Don't forget, we have Luka Modric, a male soccer player at #55. Get Putellas, the Spanish female soccer player, in there somewhere close to him.\"\n\nWorst of all, they put former U.S. soccer star Mia Hamm at #64.\n\nAnyway, the 75-51 list was a disaster. It leads me to worry that 50-26 (today) will be one as well.\n\nTo borrow a great line from a great movie: I expected more from a varsity letterman.\n\nEditor's note: The 26-50 portion of the list was just released at 8:00 am as this was being published. Ichiro Suzuki is at #37. The list is officially in the toilet now.\n\nThree quick programming notes for your personal calendar. My weekly golf radio show on 105.7 will air this Sunday from 2-4 pm instead of its usual 4-6 pm time slot. This gives us the opportunity for immediate live reaction to the final round of the British Open, which should conclude at 1:30 pm or so.\n\nTomorrow here at #DMD we'll be featuring Randy Morgan's first half review of the O's and a look back at how they're doing and what to expect over the season's final two and a half months.\n\nAnd don't forget, tomorrow night (Thursday) at 5:30 pm, we're holding our monthly free FCA junior golf clinic at Pine Ridge. Juniors ages 6-18 are welcome to attend. Parents can certainly hang around and observe as well. Bring a water bottle for hydration fill-ups and a set of golf clubs. We'll do the rest.\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain. Or the United Kingdom. I realize they are not one and the same but you get the point. I call it the \"British\" Open because it's held over there, if you will.\n\nAnyway, they're playing this year's edition of the British Open at Royal Troon, where 9 other \"Open Championships\" have been held since 1923. The last four of them have all featured something similarily unique. The winners all won their first (and as it turned out, only) major championship at Troon.\n\nMark Calcavecchia (1989), Justin Leonard (1997), Todd Hamilton (2004) and Henrik Stenson (2016) were the four most recent winners, with only Hamilton being a complete surprise. Calcavecchia, Leonard and Stenson were all top ranked players who were favored to win a major at some point and Troon just happened to be the site of their eventual victory.\n\nYou're going to see a theme with our Top 10. The names will not necessarily be of the household variety.\n\nWe'll issue our usual caveat when it comes to wagering on majors in 2024. Scottie Scheffler is currently at +400, which is kind of a crazy-low number, of course. You won't make much money on him if he wins. I assume he'll be right there at the end on Sunday. He is Scottie Scheffler, after all.\n\nBut for purposes of this 10-day exercise, we won't be listing Scheffler. We're urging you to wager on him to win just so you can wave the winning ticket at your friends, but there are several other players we're very high on and would urge you to consider as well.\n\nThe theme we're going with isn't that much different than last year's winner, Brian Harman. Or the 1989 winner in Mark Calcavechhia. We're keen on players who are nudging up against winning a major but just haven't managed to do it quite yet.\n\nRecent history at Troon suggests one of those kind of players is going to be holding the Claret Jug on July 21.\n\n#10 was Corey Conners. Robert MacIntyre was #9. Aaron Rai was #8. Xander Schauffele was #7. Billy Horschel was #6. Min Woo Lee was #5. #4 was Adam Scott. #3 was Collin Morikawa. #2 was Matthieu Pavon.\n\n#1 Viktor Hovland and Tony Finau -- Let me explain. I know it looks weird to have two guys at #1.\n\nI think it's going to be very difficult for Bob MacIntyre (listed above at #9) to win this week given that he just won last week at the Scottish Open. If you've already thrown some coin on him, maybe you'll be blessed. But I'd shy away from him given his success of last Sunday.\n\nSo......\n\nI've sorta-kinda replaced him on my list by giving you two players at #1, both of whom I'm very high on this week.\n\nViktor Hovland and Tony Finau.\n\nWhen I think of someone like Justin Leonard winning at Troon and think of an American comparison, it's Finau.\n\nWhen I think of someone like Henrik Stenson winning at Troon and think of a European comparison, it's Hovland.\n\nLeonard was \"due\" to win a major when he captured the '97 British Open. Finau's record in majors is quite impressive. He just hasn't finished on off yet. He very well might this week. He's also at a really nice number of 40-1.\n\nStenson was also one of those \"best players without a major\" when he finally claimed his Claret Jug in 2016. Hovland has been knocking on the door of majors for two or three years now and doesn't yet have one. That might change this week. He's due. And ready.\n\nHovland's number is 35-1, which is also quite appealing.\n\nNone of the last four winners at Troon were ever known as exceptionally good putters. Hovland and Finau both fit that bill. They get hot and streaky with the flat stick, though, which is all they're hoping for this week.\n\nTuesday\n\nJuly 16, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3616\n\nforget 2 to 100, who is #1?\n\nLike just about, well, everyone in the sports media world, ESPN.com is looking for content this summer.\n\nThe political field has content out the wazzoo, obviously. While some of those folks still do make stuff up to write or talk about, they certainly don't need to generate their own stories. Not until mid-November at the very least.\n\nSports has hit that patch in the summer where things have simmered down. Hockey and basketball (just) ended in June, there's only one golf major left on the calendar (this week) and even though football training camps are beginning here shortly, the teams now do most of their own content and the media need is just no longer what it once was for NFL clubs.\n\nSo, people like ESPN.com are starving for content.\n\nIf not for the two major soccer competitions over the last month and Wimbledon over the last two weeks, they -- and others of their ilk -- would have been really hurting for material.\n\nAs it stands now, ESPN and ESPN.com treat the WNBA like it's Major League Baseball. If they didn't have the WNBA in their back pocket they might have to write about soccer or lacrosse during the summer downtime.\n\nLooking for clicks and in a genuine effort to drum up conversation, too, ESPN.com is putting together their Top 100 Athletes Of This Century.\n\nBefore I present anything else of interest about their Top 100, here's the \"Methodology\" ESPN.com used to create their list:\n\nExperts in individual sports were asked to vote to rank the top athletes in their sport since Jan. 1, 2000 (no accomplishments before this date were to be considered). Those votes pared down pools in each sport to lists of 10 to 25 athletes each, which constituted the overall candidate pool for the top athletes of the 21st century so far. Each voter was presented two randomly selected names and asked to pick which one has had the better career in the 21st century. Across repeated, randomized head-to-head matchups, more than 70,000 votes were cast at this stage, and using an Elo rating system, the list was pared down from 262 to 100. That list was then evaluated by a panel of experts for any inconsistencies or oversights, resulting in the top 100 ranking seen here.\n\nSo they didn't sit around a coffee table, apparently, and yell out the obvious names: Brady! LeBron! Tiger! Serena! Djokovic! Jeter!\n\nThere was a formula in place that helped the ESPN and their list-makers come to some sort of agreement. I know it's not easy to come up with the #1 athlete when there were so many remarkable accomplishments and careers in the almost 25-year span. It actually does require a variety of opinions and research nuggets to be uncovered that either confirm or alter those opinions.\n\nThey released 100-76 yesterday and will release the rest of the list in groups of 25 this week.\n\nEd Reed was #99, by the way. That should tell you something about the list. He got beat out by the likes of Annika Sorenstam (golf), A'ja Wilson (basketball) and a cricket player 99.5% of the people reading this have never heard of, Virat Kohli.\n\nI have no idea why ESPN.com throws an obscure cricket player in as a \"better athlete\" than Ed Reed, but I'm also the guy who thinks Jimmie Johnson (auto racing) and John Velazquez (horse racing) should be on the list because they, too, are athletes of the highest caliber.\n\nSo, that's why there's a list in the first place. \"Throw a cricket player in there somewhere and see if you can stir up some controversy.\"\n\nAnyway, speaking of the Ravens, I assume there are two others on the list. I suspect Ray Lewis is in the 75-51 category or maybe even as low as the 50-26 group. If you made me bet it, though, I'd say it's Lamar in the 50-26 group with Ray somewhere around number 55 or so.\n\nWho, though, is #1?\n\nAnd even better, who actually should be #1?\n\nWhy the two questions? Because ESPN.com is prone to posturing in an effort to placate everyone they possibly can. Or at the very least, they're eager to satisfy a large portion of their \"target audience\" because, as we referenced here yesterday with regard to TV networks and their quest for ad dollars, that's the way they stay in business over the long haul.\n\nWe also get to that pesky word of \"athlete\", which is something that bogs us down and fans the flames. If you don't think a 100-and-some-pound jockey commandeering a 1,000 pound horse around a track that it might or might not want to run around on that particular occasion isn't an athletic endeavor, then you have no idea what athleticism really is.\n\nThe same goes for auto racers. You drive from here to Ocean City and you have to stop at least once to pee, once for food and maybe one more time to stretch when the traffic hits a standstill just outside of Rehoboth Beach or Salisbury. Those folks strap themselves in a car and drive it 200 miles an hour around a track for four or six hours at a time.\n\nOne of the reasons why \"athlete lists\" are so hard to compile is because we stuck in the starting gate with the debate about \"athlete\" and how we, as a society, see them.\n\nIf you don't have 2% body fat and aren't 6'3\", 185, are you immediately discounted?\n\nHe's long gone, now, but you don't think someone like professional wrestler King Kong Bundy was an \"athlete\"? I'm not trying to argue about the validity of professional wrestling as a \"sport\" (even though ESPN.com covers it like it is a sport), but I would definitely love to hear you tell me that Dwayne Johnson -- as \"The Rock\" -- wasn't an athlete during his wrestling heyday.\n\nSo, yes, I love these kinds of lists and the water cooler discussion(s) they generate. But I always wind up disagreeing with where someone goes or doesn't go and it's almost always a byproduct of that word - athlete.\n\nGolf is a sport, now, where kids who aren't athletic just have very little chance of ever being really good.\n\nIf any sport on the planet has gone from \"non-athletic\" to \"athletic\" in the last 25 years, it's golf. The entire swing and body movement that's being taught these days is an athletic effort from the ground up.\n\nOne of the very first questions I ask a junior golfer that I come across during camps or my teachings is this: \"What other sports do you play or have you played?\"\n\nIf I hear \"I haven't played any\", I know I'm starting from a different spot than if I hear, \"soccer\", \"tennis\" (my favorite to hear), \"lacrosse\", etc.\n\nSo, back to the topic at hand: \"Athleticism\", what is it, and how do we measure it when we're considering the greatest 100 athletes of the last 25 years?\n\nBut let's not allow that argument -- what about bowlers? there's another one -- to get in the way of the quest to figure out who is #1 on the list. And who should be #1 on the list, too.\n\nMy guess? LeBron is the #1 athlete on ESPN.com's list.\n\nI assume Brady is perhaps #2, but they might throw a curveball at us and put Brady at #3 or #4.\n\nIt's easier to do this when you take the four major sports, first, and throw out the obvious non-factors. The best hockey players over the last 25 years have been Ovechkin and Crosby or Crosby and Ovechkin. They're not in the Top 10. I could see Ovechkin perhaps being at #20 or thereabouts because of the goal-scoring-record chase, but that's his ceiling.\n\nThe best tennis players are (were) great, don't get me wrong. Federer, Djokovic, Serena, Nadal, etc. But I doubt any of those four make the Top 10, with the outside chance that Serena slides in at #9 or so and winds up being the \"top female\" on the list.\n\nIt's almost a disservice to Serena, Simone Biles, and any other female of note who should be considered for the list. They should simply have their own list, where we can argue back and forth about their careers and accomplishments. I have a hard time putting Novak Djokovic, for example, at #30 on the list and putting Serena at, say, #15, when I know Djokovic would beat her, every time, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nAnd, not that it matters, really, but I think giving Serena two games in each set is me just being generous.\n\nAnyway...\n\nSo if we eliminate tennis players, we're also eliminating golfers. And, obviously, the only golfer that even comes into the discussion is Tiger and I'm going to guess he winds up somewhere around #7 or #8. Your mileage may vary on that one, but I think that's a fair spot for him. If he winds up at #4 or #5 I'd consider that an overplay and if Woods is at #18 I would consider that out of whack as well.\n\nBut the Top 5 is really what we're trying to zero in on here, because from there you can chip away until you figure out the right order.\n\nI'm holding out on my own, personal, Top 5 until Thursday morning.\n\nThat said, I know who number one should be. Whether I wind up aligning with ESPN.com is another story.\n\nAnd you?\n\nIn the Comments section below, tell us who you think #1 should be and who you think ESPN.com's #1 will be.\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain. Or the United Kingdom. I realize they are not one and the same but you get the point. I call it the \"British\" Open because it's held over there, if you will.\n\nAnyway, they're playing this year's edition of the British Open at Royal Troon, where 9 other \"Open Championships\" have been held since 1923.

Scottie Scheffler is currently at +400, which is kind of a crazy-low number, of course. You won't make much money on him if he wins. I assume he'll be right there at the end on Sunday.

Robert MacIntyre was #9. Aaron Rai was #8. Xander Schauffele was #7. Billy Horschel was #6. Min Woo Lee was #5. #4 was Adam Scott. #3 was Collin Morikawa.\n\n#2 Matthieu Pavon -- I was pleased as punch a month ago to see Matthieu Pavon fire and fall back in the final round of the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.\n\nI've had Pavon circled as a British Open favorite of mine all season long. And a win at the U.S. Open would have led me to dismiss his chances at Troon later this week.\n\nAlas, he didn't win at Pinehurst in June and he didn't factor in last week's Scottish Open, either, where he missed the cut. But those two nuggets lead me to lean even more heavily in his direction this week, where he's available at anywhere from 100-1 to 150-1 depending on what service you use and how fortunate you are that they don't pay attention to golf.\n\nPavon (Puh-vone) is the perfect off-the-radar-screen guy who could win this week. He has two international wins in the last 12 months, winning in Spain last October on the European Tour and then capturing the event at Torrey Pines on the PGA Tour back in late January.\n\nAs we saw at Pinehurst, he's a ball striking machine. The 31 year old Frenchman will feel right at home at Troon this week and will be able to play in whatever kind of weather is thrown his way.\n\nHis record at the British Open, you ask? He doesn't have one. He played in 2017 and missed the cut.\n\nBut this year, he has a T12 finish at the Masters and a 5th place finish at the U.S. Open. Sandwiched in between was a missed cut at the PGA.\n\nI know he's not a popular U.S. household name, but he's precisely the guy who leads after 54 holes at Troon and gets you some Top 10 money if he falters or a buyout offer through 5 holes on Sunday if you have $20 on him at 100-1. There are a lot of ways to win with Matthieu Pavon this week and I'm here for them.\n\nMonday\n\nJuly 15, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3615\n\nwhere's the manual?\n\nLike most of you, I assume, I've been involved in numerous discussions over the last couple of days with friends and family members about the horrific incident in Butler, PA on Saturday.\n\nSports, at least in my life, has taken a back seat over the last 36 hours or so. This is real-time tension and concern we're seeing unfold in front of us and it's incredibly nerve-wracking given what we all know are the possibilities and capabilities of folks in this country.\n\nThat said, anyone hear any good Alex Verdugo fielding jokes recently? We'll get to him and his 9th inning error shortly, don't you worry about that.\n\n\"How are we going to fix it?\" a friend's 14 year old son said to me yesterday at Eagle's Nest.\n\nThat, I think, is the most pressing question. \"Why do we this to ourselves?\" is certainly important to navigate, but \"How are we going to fix it?\" is the bigger issue.\n\nThe problem is there's no manual for it or, in this day and age, no website to click on to fix it.\n\nAt least that's what most people think. We'll get back to that one shortly as well.\n\nThe idea that we solve our problems by shooting guns at people is not new, no matter what side of the political fence you're on and how much you disdain or approve of guns.\n\nShooting guns at people to resolve our differences has been going on since the Civil War. We didn't play chess to decide if the North should rule the South or the South should rule the North, remember.\n\nSo this notion that we've suddenly slipped into a country where it's guns, guns, guns is wildly off base. We've been shooting at one another for a long time.\n\nAnd it's not just recently that political figures became the target of violence, either. People act like the 1963 Kennedy assassination was the first time a President was gunned down. Abraham Lincoln, anyone?\n\nBut what's happened in our country over the last two decades is somewhat new. And this is where we need a manual. Because we simply can't fix it or haven't figured out how to fix it.\n\nWe are a country that doesn't know how to disagree on something and move on from there.\n\nThat's the root of our problems. Period.\n\nThe experts on CNN spend hours every day driving home the point that our country is divided. And that is true, for sure. What they gloss over is the fact that they, of course, are one of the reasons why the country is divided in the first place, just as other media entities in the country are as well.\n\nCNN divides us by telling anyone watching how \"their side\" is right and the other side is wrong. That's how they sell their ads. That's how Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper make $15 million a year.\n\nFOX does the same thing.\n\nThey all do it. It's how they make a living. It's an incredibly well produced trap that must have them giggling at the water cooler. Right up until some 20-year old kid tries to kill a Presidential candidate.\n\nIt's not so funny then.\n\nI've written here on numerous occasions over the last few years about the most obvious -- and maddening -- method we use to resolve our differences in this country: It's called \"what about'ism\".\n\n\"The former President was shot today. That's awful isn't it?\"\n\n\"What about the time he laughed at Nancy Pelosi's husband for being attacked?\"\n\n\"We have to do something about this gun violence. Someone just tried to assassinate a former President.\"\n\n\"What about Sandy Hook? The Republicans weren't crying about gun violence when that happened.\"\n\nAnd this isn't a testimonial centered only on horrific attempted murders, either.\n\nWe use \"what about?\" to resolve our own personal, petty differences, too.\n\nThis, of course, is a very, very small thing. I only bring it up because it's here, at #DMD, and readily available for me to make comment on.\n\nI wrote something here yesterday about a conversation I had with my son about baseball and the Saturday incident in Butler, PA and someone in the Comments section wrote something about \"hate and vitriol for the Flyers.\"\n\nClassic \"what about?\" if ever there was one.\n\nBut far more important than some goof on a website in Maryland are the problems we've developed here in this country, all on our own.\n\nI have no idea what caused this sea change in the way we deal with disagreements. Food coloring? Too much sun? Not enough vitamin B12?\n\nSomething has happened in this century.\n\nWe do not know how to successfully and productively resolve our differences.\n\nEveryone points out how we need unity in this country. We have two very distinct political parties. At the root of those two parties is a common theme shared by both: \"We're right and you're wrong.\"\n\nThat's why they fought the Civil War.\n\nAnd that's why we're still fighting today.\n\nEach party believes they're right. And this November, at the battle box (President Biden has no idea how right he was last night when he slipped up and said that), one of the parties will be \"right\" and one will be \"wrong\". One will win, one will lose.\n\nAnd the winner will rejoice and laugh and the loser will cry and rebel.\n\nThe differences will not be \"solved\" in November. They will actually heighten.\n\nWe simply do not know how to disagree on something and move on from there.\n\nUnity?\n\nI don't know how you're possibly going to be unified when the system in place is designed to create and enhance division.\n\nAnd then every time you open your web browser, read a newspaper or turn on the TV, you're met with people telling you to pick a side, stand your ground and not give an inch to the other side.\n\nI never hear CNN or FOX telling their viewers to consider \"the other side\".\n\nDoing that would cost them viewers. Which in turn would cost them advertisers. Which then leads to decreased revenue. And when that happens, Anderson Cooper or Bret Baier might only make $2.5 million annually.\n\nSo our political climate is designed to divide us.\n\nThe media is effectively in business to divide us.\n\nAnd we're shocked and mortified that we are, in fact, divided?\n\nWorst of all, though? We can't fix it.\n\nAnd the reason it can't be fixed is the same reason why you and your little sister or brother used to argue all the time: No one is willing to say, \"I don't want to win. I just want this to be better.\"\n\nWe just don't know how to disagree and move on from there.\n\nI wrote earlier there's no manual for this stuff, which isn't exactly true, of course. There is a book we can all read that serves as the best self-help book ever written: the Bible.\n\nAnd in that book you'll find everything we're dealing with today, 2,000 years later. Anger, hostility, violence, greed, betrayal and, yes, even murder.\n\nBut in that book you'll also find someone, Jesus Christ, who gave us the example of how one could and should live their life.\n\nSadly, we all fall short of Him. Some people try harder than others to follow his living example, but in the end none of us do it.\n\nThe manual, though, does exist. The problem is our country has distanced itself from that manuscript and believes there's a better way.\n\nI disagree with shunning the Bible, but I don't harbor any ill feelings if you agree with it. We'll all be judged accordingly some day. I hope your day of judgement goes well just as I pray that mine does.\n\nBut we're still back to the issue at hand, which is our country's sanity and safety, both of which are compromised at this point, mostly of our doing.\n\nNovember won't solve it.\n\nOnly we can solve it.\n\nI hope it gets fixed in my children's lifetime and they become part of the solution. As a parent, that's all I ask of them.\n\nBe part of the solution, not part of the problem.\n\nNow, let's focus on something fun for a second, which was the Orioles much-needed 6-5 win over the Yankees yesterday at Camden Yards.\n\nIt wasn't fun in the top of the 9th when Craig Kimbrel served up a 3-run gopher ball to Ben Rice -- after walking the #8 and #9 hitters, no less -- to move the O's from a 3-2 lead to a 5-3 deficit.\n\nBut it was wildly fun in the bottom of the 9th when two New York errors on plays that would have ended the game worked out in the O's favor and they wound up on the positive end of a 6-5 victory.\n\nFirst, it was Anthony Volpe failing to handle a routine grounder at shortstop.\n\nThen it was Alex Verdugo bungling a standard fly ball to left field that led to a pair of runs scoring to end the game.\n\nIn typical baseball fashion, the official scorekeeper credited Cedric Mullins with a \"hit\" on that final swing of the bat, but if that was a hit then I'm walking on the moon this Thursday.\n\nIt was an error. A mistake. A play that should have been made but wasn't. But Mullins was given a hit and the O's won, which is really all that matters anyway.\n\nAnd for one day, at least, or perhaps one inning, as it were, all was well in Birdland.\n\nThe next two weeks will be big for Mike Elias and his staff.\n\nTrades?\n\nWho do the Birds get?\n\nWho do they give up?\n\nThere's a juicy story floating around about J.D. Martinez and Luis Severino coming to Baltimore, but the Mets have suddenly started to perk up and are now 49-46 and in the middle of the wild card race in the National League. So we'll have to see about that one.\n\nEither way, the next two weeks will be fun, fun, fun.\n\nThe O's start the 2nd half of the campaign in Texas and then down in Miami against the Marlins before returning home to face Manny Machado and the Padres. By the time San Diego gets to town, you can expect to see some new Birds at Camden Yards.\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain. Or the United Kingdom. I realize they are not one and the same but you get the point. I call it the \"British\" Open because it's held over there, if you will.\n\nAnyway, they're playing this year's edition of the British Open at Royal Troon, where 9 other \"Open Championships\" have been held since 1923. The last four of them have all featured something similarily unique. The winners all won their first (and as it turned out, only) major championship at Troon.\n\nMark Calcavecchia (1989), Justin Leonard (1997), Todd Hamilton (2004) and Henrik Stenson (2016) were the four most recent winners, with only Hamilton being a complete surprise. Calcavecchia, Leonard and Stenson were all top ranked players who were favored to win a major at some point and Troon just happened to be the site of their eventual victory.\n\nYou're going to see a theme with our Top 10. The names will not necessarily be of the household variety.\n\nWe'll issue our usual caveat when it comes to wagering on majors in 2024. Scottie Scheffler is currently at +400, which is kind of a crazy-low number, of course. You won't make much money on him if he wins. I assume he'll be right there at the end on Sunday. He is Scottie Scheffler, after all.\n\nBut for purposes of this 10-day exercise, we won't be listing Scheffler. We're urging you to wager on him to win just so you can wave the winning ticket at your friends, but there are several other players we're very high on and would urge you to consider as well.\n\nThe theme we're going with isn't that much different than last year's winner, Brian Harman. Or the 1989 winner in Mark Calcavechhia. We're keen on players who are nudging up against winning a major but just haven't managed to do it quite yet.\n\nRecent history at Troon suggests one of those kind of players is going to be holding the Claret Jug on July 21.\n\n#10 was Corey Conners. Robert MacIntyre was #9. Aaron Rai was #8. Xander Schauffele was #7. Billy Horschel was #6. Min Woo Lee was #5. #4 was Adam Scott.\n\n#3 Collin Morikawa -- I was happy to see Morikawa slip up on the back nine yesterday at the Scottish Open and fail to win. I don't know that anyone can win twice in seven days, which makes my #9 pick (above) a bit concerning.\n\nAnyway, the British Open is perfect for Collin Morikawa. He's already won it once, of course, and I have to assume he's winning at least one more Claret Jug in his career if not more than one.\n\nThe greens over there simply aren't as difficult as the ones he regularly faces in the U.S., and that's a good thing for Morikawa, who only has one real weakness: putting.\n\nAnd, as I say all the time, Morikawa is not a \"bad\" putter. If he were a bad putter, he wouldn't have two majors and be one of the best 10 players in the world. He's just not a GREAT putter, that's all.\n\nBut I sure do love his chances this week at Troon, where he's 20-1 to win his 3rd career major title.\n\nSunday\n\nJuly 14, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3614\n\n\"things are really bad, huh?\"\n\nMy son wandered in early Saturday evening and sat next to me on the couch.\n\n\"Man, Dad, things are really bad, huh?\"\n\nI didn't even feel like talking about it, honestly.\n\nI mean, what do you say?\n\nBut when your son is looking at you for answers, it's your fatherly duty to try to give him peace.\n\n\"Well,\" I said. \"The good news is the All Star Break is coming up.\"\n\n\"Sometimes even good teams need a little time to get reset. They need to take a deep breath and realize they're still in good shape,\" I continued.\n\n\"And you have to assume Mike Elias is going to do something at the trade deadline,\" I stated.\n\nI was starting to get on a roll, so I continued. \"We have plenty of guys in the farm system to move. It's just a question of whether he wants to part with them or not and who we can get in exchange and whether they are rentals or players under club control for a couple of years.\"\n\n\"And let's not forget the Yankees aren't chopped liver,\" I reminded my son. \"Their pitching rotation lined up perfectly for these three games in Baltimore and our rotation wasn't all that great. I know the Cubs aren't anything special. But this New York team is pretty decent, so I wouldn't be all that worked up about losing to them.\"\n\n\"Dad, I'm not worried about the losing,\" my son said, his voice lowering.\n\n\"Oh, you're concerned we might not be able to add anyone of quality at the deadline?\" I asked.\n\nBefore he could answer, I gave more support to Mike Elias.\n\n\"Elias has built this organization from the ashes,\" I explained. \"When he took over six years ago, we were a laughingstock. And he vowed to do it the right way and he has. We have a great major league product, the minors are stocked with growing talent, and the O's scouting department will make some other good picks at the upcoming draft.\"\n\nIt was time for me to remind my son about the past, even if he wasn't around for all of it.\n\n\"If you would have been able to watch the games in 2004, 2006 and 2008, you might have a different feeling,\" I said. \"Those were days worth getting upset about. The team was horrendous. The farm system was awful. We were only in 5th place in the A.L. East because the division didn't have six teams. We were bottom of the barrel.\"\n\n\"But, Dad,\" my son said before I cut him off.\n\n\"Stop reading the internet,\" I cautioned him. \"A lot of people are Debbie Downers out there. If you let them bring you down, they will. The team is 57-38. They have more wins than the Dodgers, Braves and the Rangers, you know, the team that won the World Series last year.\"\n\n\"Dad, it's not the losing,\" my son said.\n\n\"Oh, you're still upset about the beanball stuff from Friday night?\" I asked.\n\nBefore he could answer, I dove in.\n\n\"Look, baseball players are weird,\" I said, resting a hand on his shoulder for comfort. \"They're all very talented. But they're also weird. They get upset when they're losing 9-1 and someone on the other team tries to steal a base. Or if you're winning 9-1 and you hit a home run you're not supposed to stand there and stare it as it leaves the stadium.\"\n\n\"And then if someone gets hit by a pitch accidentally, the other team automatically assumes it was done intentionally. And then they have to throw a pitch at the other team and act like it was accidental even though we all kind of know it wasn't,\" I said.\n\n\"So, Friday night probably wasn't intentional, but that doesn't really matter. Now, someone from the Orioles will have to throw at a Yankees player again, maybe even on Sunday, and then we're right back to square one.\"\n\n\"But, Dad, you're not letting me explain,\" my son said.\n\n\"You don't have to explain,\" I countered. \"I know what you're feeling, pal. I've been there, done that. I've seen the team be great back in the 1980's and I've seen them be beyond horrible 20 years ago. I'm just here to tell you it will all get better at some point. It always does.\"\n\n\"Dad, when I said things are really bad, I wasn't talking about the Orioles,\" my son said. \"I'm talking about our country.\"\n\nWe sat there together and watched coverage of the failed assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Why does this happen?\" he asked.\n\nI unintentionally used a line from the great movie A Few Good Men.\n\n\"Because sometimes people take matters into their own hands,\" I said.\n\n\"And we don't have enough love in our hearts for one another,\" I continued.\n\n\"I wish we had more people following Jesus,\" I stated.\n\nThe two of us watched the coverage for another minute or two.\n\n\"Things are really bad, aren't they Dad?\" he asked again.\n\nThis time, I just nodded my head in agreement and put the baseball talk on the backburner, where it should be when our country is a mess.\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain.

Robert Macintyre was #9. Aaron Rai was #8. Xander Schauffele was #7. Billy Horschel was #6. Min Woo Lee was #5.\n\n#4 Adam Scott -- So you can count me among those who are really disappointed that Adam Scott is playing great this week at the Scottish Open and could even win today if Aberg and Macintyre fall back in the final round.\n\nI was able to get Scott at 85-1 (he's now 80-1) earlier this week, but if he wins today he'll probably dip down to 50-1 or 60-1.\n\nThat said, I thought I might be one of the only people in the country who was \"on\" the former Masters champion.\n\nHis record at the British Open is awesome, even if most of that great play happened a decade ago. At 43 years old, and playing on a course that doesn't necessarily reward long hitters, the Australian is a great fit for Troon this coming week.\n\nHe's made the cut in 18 of the 23 Opens in which he's played and has 5 top 10 finishes, including a 2nd and T3 in back-to-back years ('12 and '13).\n\nNow, if he wins today at the Scottish Open? Well, that likely means he's not winning at Troon. But I didn't know that when I snagged him earlier this week and I'm not willing to shove him to the side until I see what he does today.\n\nI think Adam Scott has a great chance to play well next week.\n\nAnd there's something about him that I can't shake. He's just too good of a ball striker to only win one major championship. And I think there are only two majors he can win; the Masters and the British Open.\n\nSaturday\n\nJuly 13, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3613\n\nit's gonna get fun now\n\nNever before has a 4-l loss and another listless offensive performance been shoved to the backburner like the one the O's experienced last night at Camden Yards.\n\n4-1 loss? What 4-1 loss?\n\n5-game home losing streak? Where? I don't see one.\n\nThe 9th inning shenanigans that led to a benches clearing \"situation\" was all the talk of the post-game wrap up last night, as the Birds seethed while the Yankees shrugged their shoulders and said, \"You guys are just made 'cuz you lost.\"\n\nToday's 4:05 pm tilt will be a fun one, that's for sure.\n\nThe Birds are mired in an ill-timed 4-game losing streak that has seen them score a grand total of 3 runs this week. Last night's woeful work at the plate included a 1-for-9 effort with runners in scoring position, a scenario that has bedeviled them to no end this month.\n\nBut that losing streak moves into 2nd place today. Getting back at the Yankees takes center stage. The first ball that comes even close to a New York hitter will be met with tension, an umpire warning, and who knows what else. It's going to be interesting. And that's an understatement.\n\nTruthfully, the \"official\" guess here is nothing much happens today, because the home plate umpire will issue the ceremonial pre-game warnings to both managers and starting pitchers. And with the Birds slumping and the Yankees (and Red Sox) hovering close behind, Brandon Hyde will remind starter Grayson Rodriguez that the Orioles have a ballgame to win, first and foremost.\n\nSunday is the likely blow-up day, what with that silly 11:35 am start and the prospect of a few days off for the All Star break. Unless there's a wide scoring margin today where the O's are up 7-1 in the 8th inning and the Yankees appear to have waved the white flag, I don't think the Birds go after a New York hitter in Saturday's game.\n\nBut tomorrow........\n\nAs for the Clay Holmes throw from last night that everyone in Baltimore is angered over, I am certainly in the minority on this one but I didn't see that pitch as \"intentional\".\n\nIt was raining.\n\nThe game -- despite the fact the O's can't hit and/or score runs -- was still in the balance.\n\nThe Yankees have been gasping for air over the last month and have lost 8 straight series'.\n\nThe season series (now 5-3 in favor of the O's) is critical and the Yankees couldn't afford to throw away a 4-1 lead.\n\nThe count was 0-2 and it was Heston Kjerstad at the plate. I can't imagine Holmes was overly concerned with Kjerstad at that point.\n\nNow, don't get this twisted.\n\nI think the Orioles have every right to be concerned/frustrated/outraged at a 97 mph fastball dinging one of their players in his batting helmet.\n\nBrandon Hyde was well within in his rights to lose his cool if, in fact, the Yankees were chirping and barking at him while Kjerstad was being attended to near home plate.\n\nAll three of those things can be true at the same time.\n\nThe O's should have been pissed about the Holmes pitch.\n\nHyde had the green light to get lathered up if the Yankees were laughing about it.\n\nThere was nothing about the situation at hand that suggested Holmes was intentionally trying to hit Kjerstad with a pitch.\n\nIn case it matters, Holmes said afterwards it was simply a case of the wet ball not giving him the grip he needed to throw the intended \"front door sinker\" to Kjerstad. Your mileage may vary on that one.\n\nBut just like I can't imagine Cionel Perez was trying to break Cody Bellinger's finger earlier this week when he nicked him with an inside pitch that \"got away\", I just don't see how it made any sense at all -- with all that's going on with the Yankees and their season -- for Holmes to intentionally hit Heston Kjerstad.\n\nWith all due respect to Kjerstad, who's he? If you're the Yankees and you're looking to disrupt the Orioles in the second half, wouldn't you want Henderson, Rutschman or Westburg out for 6-8 weeks?\n\nAnd, yes, I know Kjerstad is hitting .314. But no one is confusing Kjerstad with Henderson when it comes to value.\n\nAlas, all of the beanball stuff glossed over another listless offensive performance for the Birds, who got what the pro folks call a \"gritty\" effort from starting pitcher Cade Povich in the 4-1 loss.\n\nIt wasn't poor pitching that did in the Birds last night. It was a six-hit effort at the plate that included several wasted opportunities, including two-on-with-no-outs in the bottom of the first that then featured Santander, O'Hearn and Westburg all failing to cash in and give the hosts a much needed early lead.\n\nRight on cue, the Yankees made the Orioles pay for those three unproductive outs in the very next inning with back-to-back run scoring doubles. The uprising included a clumsy error by Anthony Santander in right field that started the whole mess.\n\nAaron Judge would later hit his 33rd home run after Baltimore had cut the lead to 2-1 and that was pretty much all she wrote. The Yankees tacked on a 9th inning insurance run and then the Holmes-Kjerstad incident helped everyone in Baltimore forget about the loss.\n\nSocial media ignited afterwards with claims that the O's will come out on fire starting today at 4:05 pm. Even former O's catcher and broadcaster Rick Dempsey joined in, saying the flare-up and benches clearing situation was \"just what the doctor ordered!\"\n\nA Major League Baseball player I am not. But I can't imagine the episode from last night will cause Gunnar Henderson to stop looking at strike three right across the middle of the plate or will help Adley Rutschman be more \"locked in\" at the plate with runners on 2nd and 3rd.\n\nI mean, maybe?\n\nBut if it takes one of your players getting thrown at for you to buckle up and get locked in out there, I think I'd be concerned about that moving forward if I'm Brandon Hyde.\n\nYou should be locked in because you're one of 26 players on the roster and you're getting millions to \"work\" on a baseball field. I know everyone occasionally needs a reason to try harder, but when you've just lost three in a row to the Cubs of all people and the Yankees are in town for a huge series, I would hope you don't need extra incentive to try your best.\n\nThat said, if the O's reel off a 6-1 win today and 5-3 win on Sunday to end the first half of the campaign on a high note, everyone is going to point to the Friday night beanball event and claim that was the turnaround moment the Birds desperately needed.\n\nEither way, I'm here for it.\n\nToday and tomorrow should be a lot of fun.\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain.

Other than Scheffler, these are the five guys we're really zeroing in on for next week at Troon. And Min Woo Lee (55-1) continues to be one of our favorites next week at the final major of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe Australian is an accomplished international player and even has a win \"over there\", as he claimed the 2021 Scottish Open early on in his PGA Tour career.\n\nLee has played three previous Opens with a missed cut in '21, a T21 in '22 and a T41 in '23.\n\nThis year he's made the cut in all three majors to date, with top 30 finishes at the Masters, PGA and U.S. Open.\n\nHe struggled at the start of the '24 campaign but has turned things around nicely of late. If you're looking for a player with the talent and capability to win a major who just hasn't done it yet (think Brian Harman, 2023), Min Woo Lee is a perfect candidate.\n\nFriday\n\nJuly 12, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3612\n\no's losing leverage?\n\nOK, so here's a trade offer I created yesterday while watching some massive waves crash onto the beach in Ocean City.\n\nAnd this was before last night's 8-0 humbling at the hands of the Cubs in Baltimore.\n\nHow about...\n\nThe Pirates get Jackson Holliday.\n\nAnd the Orioles get Paul Skenes.\n\nLike it?\n\nI love it.\n\nI'm kidding, of course.\n\nThe Pirates would never do that deal.\n\nAnd those trade concepts that rattle around in our heads are almost always tilted in favor of our team(s). We try to fleece everybody, even the smart teams.\n\nBut while a Holliday-for-Skenes deal is silly talk, #DMD reader Bill P. has something on his mind that's not silly. His e-mail from yesterday afternoon might even be worth more consideration after Thursday's shutout loss completed a 3-game sweep by the visiting Cubs.\n\nBill P. wrote: If we lose tonight and the Yankees come in here and take 2 of 3 or sweep us has Elias lost a lot of trade leverage over the last two or three weeks? Teams now know we are flawed to the point where we might be desperate for a quick fix or two. Thoughts, Drew?\n\nWell, the O's did lose \"tonight\", as in Thursday night. Their pitching wasn't great. Their offense was virtually non-existent. And when they were presented with opportunities to drive in runs, they couldn't do it.\n\nBut have they lost leverage?\n\nIt is a fair question.\n\nI think, though, that the answer is \"No, they haven't.\"\n\nNow, there's no telling what the White Sox really want for Crochet or the Tigers really want for Skubal. Those two pitchers in particular might be out of the O's trading wheelhouse no matter if they sweep the Cubs or lose three straight to the Cubs like they did this week.\n\nBut the reason Mike Elias isn't losing leverage is because I'm guessing he has a list of players he's willing to part with and a list of players that are on his own, private, no trade list.\n\nHe's not giving up Coby Mayo in a package for Crochet or Skubal.\n\nHe's not giving up Jordan Westburg in a package for Crochet or Skubal.\n\nHe's not giving up Heston Kjerstad in a package for Crochet or Skubal.\n\nI don't know that, obviously. I'm just saying, there's a list of certain players that aren't available no matter if it's Crochet, Skubal or anyone else that might be available to the right bidder this month.\n\nNow, where Elias might potentially be losing leverage is if some other team comes along and pays the asking price for those two pitchers and suddenly the O's are left to consider guys like Quantrill, Kikuchi or Severino.\n\nThe Rockies, Blue Jays and Mets might all say, \"Well, before you lost out on Skubal and Crochet we would have taken \"xxx\" for our guy but now we're gonna need \"xxx\" and \"xx\".\n\nBut I'm guessing Elias wouldn't play that game, either.\n\nHe knows the O's need help. And he knows he'll part with guys like Stowers, Povich, Norby and maybe even Cowser to snag what he wants.\n\nBut he also knows now is not the time to get fleeced just because you've hit a little mid-season rut.\n\nThe Rangers, remember, had one of the best records in all of baseball for the first 110 games of the season in 2023, then bottomed out in August, barely made the playoffs in September, then went on a record-setting post-season run that saw win every post-season road game they played en-route to the title.\n\nYou can't rely on history to get you through, but it's also worth looking at history and remembering that it does tend to repeat itself.\n\nI don't think Elias is losing leverage. He's going to ship off the same guys today that he would have been willing to ship off on Monday of this week.\n\nBut I understand the question and I think it's a fair one.\n\nThe White Sox are looking to fleece someone for Garrett Crochet and it's probably unimportant to them who the trade partner is at the end of the day.\n\nThey just want the best possible package of players. If the Orioles weren't willing to meet those demands last month and last week, I just don't see Elias caving in now and saying, \"OK, OK, I'll give you Cowser and Mayo for Crochet now.\"\n\nMaybe I'm wrong.\n\nBut I don't think I am.\n\nAnd if the O's win 3 of 3 or 2 of 3 to the Yankees, we won't be nearly as worried about it all as we are this morning after getting punked three straight by the Cubs in Baltimore.\n\nBruce in Pasadena writes in with a question: \"Do you think Tiger opting out of the Ryder Cup captain was truly about him not having the time to devote to it or do you think maybe Tiger wanted a lot of money and the PGA wouldn't pay him? And how do you think Tiger would have been as a captain of the team?\"\n\nDF says: \"I have no way of knowing why he didn't take the job, really, but I'm guessing in the end it probably was more about the time associated with running the team and not at all about money. I think Tiger, like everyone else, enjoys earning money. But I don't think he runs around looking for big projects to pay him a lot of money.\n\nI can't imagine he said to the PGA of America, \"Give me $10 million to captain the team.\" They would probably say to him, \"Tiger, be serious. It's a home game. In New York, no less. There's about a 3% chance we're losing there in 2025. We could put anyone in there to captain the team and we'll win.\"\n\nI personally think Tiger is more interested in watching his kids play high school sports than he is being the Ryder Cup captain. And, sure, maybe his new role helping piece together the PGA Tour/LIV alliance is also part of the reason he turned down the opportunity.\n\nBut there's very little doubt that Woods will be a captain someday and will, most likely, be a multi-term captain as well.\n\nAs for the quality of his captaincy, I've never seen Woods tackle anything that he was solely responsible for and be anything but great. Sure, his Ryder Cup playing record isn't all that impressive, but a majority of that competition is a 2-man team event, remember.\n\nI think he'd be an excellent captain. I have no idea if that means the team will go to Ireland and win with him in 2027, but whenever that opportunity arises, I suspect the U.S. will perform well for Tiger.\n\nBy the way, I think Keegan Bradley was picked, in part, because he gives the U.S. a nice chance for a multi-term guy. If they win at Bethpage in 2025, they'll run Bradley back again in 2027, assuming he wants the job for another two years.\"\n\nC.J. asks -- \"Hi Drew, can you check out these six names and tell me in what order you'd be willing trade them at the deadline? Mullins, Santander, Cowser, Hays, Mateo.\"\n\nDF says -- \"Well, Mateo doesn't have any trade value at all. I won't even list him. I mean, he might be DFA'd here in the next 15 days for all we know. I can't imagine any team would take him unless he was an \"add on\" in a deal for a veteran pitcher.\n\nOf that list above, I'd say the guy I'm least interested in parting with right now is Cowser simply because he's just breaking into the big leagues. He's been hot, cold and somewhere in between all season. I don't know if he's ever going to be a great, every day player in the Majors, but of those guys you listed, he's at the top of the \"don't want to trade\" list.\n\nSantander is next, I guess, but I also think there's a good chance he's going to get a nice free agent deal with someone this off-season. So with that in mind, I wouldn't be totally oppoosed to moving him if the deal was right.\n\nYou can flip a coin when it comes to Hays and Mullins. They're the same age and pretty much the same player, although Hays is a better hitter (barely) at this point in his career.\"\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain. Or the United Kingdom. I realize they are not one and the same but you get the point. I call it the \"British\" Open because it's held over there, if you will.\n\nAnyway, they're playing this year's edition of the British Open at Royal Troon, where 9 other \"Open Championships\" have been held since 1923. The last four of them have all featured something similarily unique. The winners all won their first (and as it turned out, only) major championship at Troon.\n\nMark Calcavecchia (1989), Justin Leonard (1997), Todd Hamilton (2004) and Henrik Stenson (2016) were the four most recent winners, with only Hamilton being a complete surprise. Calcavecchia, Leonard and Stenson were all top ranked players who were favored to win a major at some point and Troon just happened to be the site of their eventual victory.\n\nYou're going to see a theme with our Top 10. The names will not necessarily be of the household variety.\n\nWe'll issue our usual caveat when it comes to wagering on majors in 2024. Scottie Scheffler is currently at +400, which is kind of a crazy-low number, of course. You won't make much money on him if he wins. I assume he'll be right there at the end on Sunday. He is Scottie Scheffler, after all.\n\nBut for purposes of this 10-day exercise, we won't be listing Scheffler. We're urging you to wager on him to win just so you can wave the winning ticket at your friends, but there are several other players we're very high on and would urge you to consider as well.\n\nThe theme we're going with isn't that much different than last year's winner, Brian Harman. Or the 1989 winner in Mark Calcavechhia. We're keen on players who are nudging up against winning a major but just haven't managed to do it quite yet.\n\nRecent history at Troon suggests one of those kind of players is going to be holding the Claret Jug on July 21.\n\n#10 was Corey Conners. Robert Macintyre was #9. Aaron Rai was #8. Xander Schauffele was #7.\n\n#6, Billy Horschel -- If you're looking for the right handed version of last year's winner, southpaw Brian Harman, you just might have him. And he's 175-1, too.\n\nThere isn't much about Horschel's game that stands out, in the same way there wasn't much about Harman's that stood out, either.\n\nBut if Justin Leonard can win a British Open, so, too, can Billy Horschel.\n\nHe's played 9 \"Open Championship\" events in his career and made the cut in just 3 of them. But don't let that take you away from the fact that he's enjoying a nice 2024 campaign.\n\nHorschel has made 12 of 17 cuts, with a win this season (Puntacana) and four other Top 10 finishes.\n\nHis shots gained numbers are fine, except for \"approach to green\", which are bottom half of the pack. But he's 5th in putting, which, as we saw with Harman last year when he made 58 of 59 putts within 10 feet, is where the majors are won.\n\nHorschel has 7 career individual wins on TOUR, including the FedEx Cup title in 2014. He knows how to win. His golf wasn't great in 2023, but he's turned it around this year.\n\nAnd if you're looking for this season's edition of Brian Harman, 2023, it just might be Billy Horschel. And at 175-1? Yes, please.\n\nfaith in sports\n\nMany of you will remember I helped run the national FCA golf camp at Kutztown University late last month.\n\nWe had a great time!\n\nAnd so did roughly 600 other athletes who converged on the central Pennyslvania school for a week of faith, fellowship and athletic fun.\n\nThe 3 minute video below highlights the entire week of camp and showcases the various sports and activities that were part of the camp. You might even recognize a certain golf instructor in the video if you look closely enough.\n\nTo those of you who donated to our golf camp efforts this year, I hope you'll check out the video below to see where your support goes and how much it helps us produce one of the best camps you'll find anywhere.\n\nThanks, as always, to our friends at Freestate Electrical for their continued support of #DMD and our \"Faith in Sports\" segment every Friday.\n\nThursday\n\nJuly 11, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3611\n\nfractured and fired\n\nDid you guys ever see that 2007 movie, \"Fracture\", starring Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling?\n\nYou see, there's this scene in that flick that reminds me of the Orioles.\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nNot about the movie. It's a great movie, as I pointed out here yesterday.\n\nI'm kidding about going back to the well with that one again today. Just seeing if you're paying attention, that's all.\n\nBut last night's loss to the Cubs and the club's failure to cash in with runners in scoring position continues to highlight a problem that seems to be more than just an occasional thing with the 2024 edition of the O's.\n\nLast night they went 0-for-11.\n\nIn Tuesday's series opener vs. Chicago, they were a mere 0-for-1.\n\nJuly 7, 2-for-9\n\nJuly 6, 4-for-14\n\nJuly 5, 2-for-10\n\nJuly 4, 0-for-7\n\nJuly 3, 2-for-6\n\nJuly 2, 2-for-10\n\nThat's 12 for 68 with runners in scoring position over their last 8 games and the only game they actually were halfway decent in that category was a 19-8 loss.\n\nThat's a .176 batting average for those Flyers fans who have a calculator handy but don't know how to compute it.\n\nTwo guys who were starting to perk up are once again scuffling at the plate.\n\nIt's certainly not the fault of both Jorge Mateo and Cedric Mullins that the O's are in the midst of a concerning offensive drought, but their lack of production at the plate has reduced the Birds to a 7-man lineup for the most part.\n\nMateo's last 20 games look like this: .197/.222/.344\n\nI get it. He's fast. And he's a capable defensive player. But his offensive numbers speak for themselves.\n\nMullins had a nice little two week run back in mid-late June, but we're seeing more of the old Ced over the last week or so. He's 4-for-his-last-29.\n\nBut here's what's making the Mateo-Mullins situation worse: They are Ichiro compared to what's going on with Colton Cowser of late. If Mullins was struggling but Cowser was hitting. 280 or something like that, it might be OK. Alas, Cowser is also stinking it up.\n\nCowser has four, yes, four multi-hit games since June 1st. It's now July 11.\n\nHe's 8 for his last 51 at the plate, which is .156.\n\nThere was a time back in May when Cowser had the look of the team's Fair Haired Boy. There was some kind of section dedicated to him in the outfield seats, people were \"moo'ing\" when he arrived at the plate and it looked like the O's had potentially found their new, full time centerfielder.\n\nSome of those moo's have been replaced with boo's, unfortunately. He is going through a rough patch of late.\n\nYou might not realize it, but James McCann has started 40% of the team's games at catcher this season. We'll touch more on that here tomorrow or over the weekend. There's a story there, too.\n\nWe've been rehashing some of these offensive issues for a while now, but winning always seemed to take care of them. And it still might, of course.\n\nBut summer baseball is different than fall baseball. The weather and temperatures change, the ball doesn't carry like it did in the sweltering months of June, July and August and you're suddenly 2-0 down in the series to Texas or Boston or Minnesota and you're saying to yourself the same thing Mike Damone said when Mark Ratner assaulted him in the locker room at the end of Fast Times At Ridgemont High: \"I don't know what the hell happened.\"\n\nAs I wrote here yesterday, it's not panic time. The O's are still in first place, still on cruise control for an A.L. playoff spot and still have a plethora of minor league stash that will be attractive to other teams at the trade deadline.\n\nBut to ignore some of these warning signs -- both on the mound and at the plate -- would be a gross dereliction of duty.\n\nThe reality is Mullins has been lousy all season but did manage to put together a nice 2-week run that spiked his numbers up from miserable to discouraging.\n\nMateo is what he is, which is a guy who can hit lefties \"just OK\", can't hit righties \"hardly at all\" and is prone to the occasional show of power when all of his chakras are in line.\n\nBut the reality with Mateo is if he wasn't useful with the glove and wasn't fast on the basepaths, he wouldn't have a job in Major League Baseball. He's not a quality hitter.\n\nCorbin Burnes wasn't his usual exceptional self last night but he was still more than good enough to win. He threw 6 innings, allowed just 3 earned runs, struck out 5, and even though he gave up 9 hits, several of those were dinky, off-the-end-of-the-bat types that were nothing to worry about.\n\nBurnes and Grayson Rodriguez are unquestionably effective nearly every time they take the mound. GrayRod will throw in a stinker once every 6 or 7 starts, but he's clearly a #2 starter who will be the team's defacto #1 guy next season after Burnes leaves for the Dodgers, Rangers or Yankees this winter.\n\nPitching help and someone to drive in runs when there are guys on base. That's what the O's need. And that \"someone to drive in runs\" might even need to be two people if the bottom of the order keeps flatlining like it has been over the last two weeks.\n\nLosing two in a row at home to the Cubs? Yikes.\n\nThen again, let's remember the Reds just went into New York last week and took 3 of 3 from the Yankees.\n\nThere's always a silver lining somewhere. You just have to look carefully for it.\n\nKind of like looking for hairline fractures in eggs...\n\nThe U.S. men's soccer team did what they pretty much had to do yesterday, firing embattled head coach Gregg Berthalter after a relatively successful 5-year spell that ended with an embarrassing early exit from this summer's Copa America tournament.\n\nBerhalter's time with the national team was met with mixed results, although it's fair to point out he's the one coach who finally figured out how to get the U.S. side to beat Mexico on a regular basis. In the end, though, a discouraging 5-1 loss to Colombia in a Copa warm-up tilt and a 2-1 home defeat to Panama in the tournament proper were the final pieces of evidence used against him.\n\nAs I've chronicled here on numerous occasions, I'm not a huge Berhalter fan but I was also not a Berhalter hater, either. I thought he did a capable job with the program given the lack of overall quality within the pool of U.S. players he was allowed to consider.\n\nThe hope here is that this is the beginning of a process that the United States Soccer Federation takes very seriously in advance of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nStep one was to give in to public (and perhaps, corporate) pressure and fire the head coach.\n\nStep two will be to bring in someone new and throw out the template promotional commentary that goes with it: \"So-and-so will bring a new energy to the program\" and \"We're excited to see what so-and-so will do over the next two years with this incredibly talented group of players we have\".\n\nStep three will be some startling, impressive early success, even though the U.S. isn't slated to play any kind of formal, tournament-level competition until World Cup 2026 rolls around. But there will be some \"friendlies\" against top level countries and the Americans will perform well in those, leading everyone to assume there's hope for 2026 and that Berhalter, in fact, was the problem.\n\nStep four will be the inevitable slice of \"market correction\" that always comes with coaching changes and such. The players, not the coach, will then be on the hot seat after a series of disappointing performances.\n\nAnd then...step five. The USSF will realize they simply don't have enough quality soccer players to compete at the World Cup level.\n\nAs I noted yesterday on Twitter after Berhalter's firing, now all the Americans need to do is find 8 or 9 new starting players to replace the ones they currently have and they'll be rolling.\n\nCoaching matters, yes. But there's only one of those.\n\nThere are 11 players on the field. You can't win if you have 1 or 2 really good ones and 9 or 10 \"just OK\" types.\n\nAs for new coaching candidates, the rumor is the U.S. is zeroing in on former National team member Steve Cherundolo, who spent his entire playing career in the German Bundesliga and is currently a head coach in L.A. with Major League Soccer.\n\nLAFC has enjoyed a very respectable 2-year run under Cherundolo's leadership, which is why he's the hot choice to replace Berhalter.\n\nBut the only reason Cherundolo is being considered is because other more well accomplished international coaches are likely not interested in taking "
