The defense attorneys and the prosecutors spent an immense amount of time analyzing Hinckley, and attempting to determine the type of mental disorder he had. Hinckley was ultimately diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, and in every attempt to be released from his hospital confinement, the judge would argue that his NPD caused him to lack judgment about his illness, and was therefore a threat to society (Capps\n\nSummary Of The Movie 'What About Bob?'\n\n425 Words | 2 Pages\n\nPersonality features and psychological disorders are linked to each other in various ways.

It tends to decline as individuals get older (Foster, Twenge & Campbell, 2003). With regards to who is more narcissistic between male and female, studies have found that there are more narcissistic men than women (Philipson, 1985; Foster, Twenge & Campbell, 2003).

While the DSM-5 does not specify any subtypes, many psychologists and psychiatrists have found it useful to differentiate between types of narcissists. In a recent paper Russ, Shedler, Bradley, and Western (2008) detailed three subtypes of narcissists: the grandiose or malignant, the fragile, and the high functioning or exhibitionistic narcissist.
