        "text": "Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes sent shockwaves through the entertainment world when they announced their separation, with Katie filing for divorce due to her concerns over Tom's affiliation with Scientology. The couple had tied the knot in a Scientologist ceremony in 2006, just months after welcoming their daughter Suri Cruise, but their relationship took a turn for the worse over the years.\n\nAccording to reports, the presence of Church of Scientology members in their Los Angeles home was a significant source of tension in the marriage. As Ron Miscavige, the father of church leader David Miscavige, revealed: \"That didn't sit so well with Katie, of course, and it hurt the marriage.\"\n\nMiscavige explained that the church's staff had moved in with Tom and Katie to ensure the Mission Impossible star was \"properly taken care of,\" but this move deeply unsettled Katie.\n\nMiscavige also disclosed that Katie feared her daughter might end up cutting all contact with her under Scientology's \"disconnection\" policy, where members are required to sever ties with any family member who leaves the church. As Miscavige stated, \"Katie feared her daughter might end up cutting all contact with her under Scientology's 'disconnection' policy.\"\n\nScientology \"disconnection policy\" fueled Katie Holmes' fears\n\nOn June 29, 2012, Tom and Katie announced their divorce, with Tom expressing his sadness over the situation. \"Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children,\" a spokesperson for the actor said at the time. Tom himself echoed these sentiments, stating, \"Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of their split, Katie was granted sole custody of Suri as part of their divorce settlement, leading to Tom becoming estranged from his daughter over the years. As one source revealed, \"Tom is believed to have 'not seen' the d[aughter].\"\n\nThe unraveling of Tom and Katie's marriage serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities that can arise when personal beliefs and family dynamics intersect. The enduring repercussions of their split continue to be felt, particularly in the strained relationship between Tom and Suri, a testament to the challenges that can emerge when external pressures encroach upon intimate relationships."
