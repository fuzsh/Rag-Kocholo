        "text": "Tom Cruise seems to have limited visits with his daughter, Suri, since his divorce from Holmes. Nowadays, Suri lives with Holmes in New York City, where she has full custody. The last public sighting of Suri with her father dates back almost a decade to 2012, when they enjoyed a trip to Disneyland together.\n\nKatie Holmes shocked Cruise with the divorce.\n\nEvan Agostini/Invision/East News, Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection/East News\n\nTom Cruise has three kids. He shares his only son, Connor Cruise, and his eldest daughter, Isabella ’Bella’ Cruise, with his ex-wife, Nicole Kidman. They adopted Bella and Connor when they were married. The actor has one biological child: his daughter Suri, whom he shares with his other ex-wife, Katie Holmes.\n\nHolmes went through a lot to end her marriage to Cruise, even using secret phones and having private meetings with her lawyers. She surprised him with the divorce. He later admitted that Holmes left «to protect Suri» from certain beliefs.\n\nNews came out that 17-year-old Suri is starting to apply for college, but Cruise won’t have a say in where she goes.\n\nTom Cruise wasn’t prohibited from seeing Suri, but he and Katie have a complicated relationship.\n\nDylan Travis/ABACA/Abaca/East News\n\nIn 2013, Cruise openly discussed the situation with his legal team. He mentioned when circumstances change due to divorce, things aren’t always ideal.\n\nBy March 2023, an anonymous source disclosed that Cruise has minimal involvement in his daughter Suri’s life. The source hinted that the actor’s beliefs might be a factor contributing to their distant relationship but still, if he desired, he could maintain contact with her.\n\n«Even people in prison have a right to see their children. This is his loss, his issue, his problem.»\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/East News\n\nTom Cruise and Katie Holmes finalized their divorce agreement in just 11 days. Contrary to expectations, Cruise did not gain custody of their daughter, Suri Cruise, during the negotiations. Instead, he was granted visitation rights only. Cruise has the option to visit Suri for up to 10 days each month.\n\nTom Cruise loves Suri.\n\nEAST NEWS\n\nAccording to information shared with Hollywood Life in April 2019, despite their distant relationship, Tom continues to hold affection for Suri. The insider explained that despite the difficulties they’ve faced, Tom’s love for his daughter remains unchanged. They added that Tom never planned for this estrangement when he started a family with Katie. He hopes to mend their relationship in the future.\n\nStill, the non-maintained relationship between Katie and Cruise remains the main problem of why Suri is disconnected from her father.\n\nTom Cruise covers expenses for Suri.\n\nDylan Travis/ABACA/Abaca/East News\n\nBy 2023, Suri had submitted applications to various schools. Katie strongly preferred that she remain in New York to maintain their proximity. While Katie deeply cherishes her daughter, she tends to be overly cautious.\n\nThe source also noted that although Tom wasn’t involved in Suri’s college decision, he would cover her tuition fees as agreed upon in his confidential divorce agreement with Holmes.\n\nAfter divorce, relationships can become incredibly complex. The dissolution of a marriage often brings about a myriad of emotions, ranging from hurt and resentment to longing and regret. Factors such as co-parenting arrangements, financial matters, and lingering feelings can all contribute to the intricacy of post-divorce relationships."
