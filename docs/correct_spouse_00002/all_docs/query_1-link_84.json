        "text": "Ten years after Katie Holmes sudden and dramatic divorce from Tom Cruise, she has new man in her life, and judging by media reports and photos published by People, it looks like things are getting serious.\n\nHolmes made no effort this week to hide her romance with musician Bobby Wooten III, as paparazzi snapped them wearing big smiles and walking arm-in-arm in New York City, as People reported.\n\nMeanwhile, things have been strangely silent on the Cruise dating front since 2012, when he says Holmes “blindsided” him and asked for divorce.\n\nThe photos of Holmes and Wooten captured the couple kissing, and at one point showed them meeting up with Holmes’ mother, Kathy Holmes, during their outing, which included a subway ride, a visit to the Guggenheim Museum and a stroll through Central Park, People said.\n\nWooten, a bass guitarist who played for Broadway shows and Jennifer Lopez, is the third man linked to the former “Dawson’s Creek” star, since she stunned the world in 2012 by filing for divorce from the charismatic but famously intense Cruise, the father of her daughter Suri, now 16.\n\nFollowing their divorce, Holmes, 43, was next involved in a reportedly tumultuous on-off relationship for with actor Jamie Foxx, which ended in 2019, and she enjoyed a pandemic romance with New York City chef Emilio Vitolo.\n\nAs for Cruise, there were reports last year that the 59-year-old star was dating his “Mission: Impossible 7” co-star Hayley Atwell, 39, but that they split in September.\n\nThe reports, which remained in the realm of the tabloids and relied on “insider” sources, also seemed a bit thin. It was as if Cruise’s PR team was pushing the gossip as way to keep his name in the entertainment press as the seventh and eighth installments of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and his highly anticipated “Top Gun 2,” kept facing delays being released due to COVID-19. “Top Gun 2” is finally due to be released in theaters May 27.\n\nThe decade-long absence of more mainstream news about Cruise’s love life is remarkable considering that his dating exploits were closely followed for decades, beginning with his rise to mega-stardom in the early 1980s.\n\nCruise played out many of his romances in the public spotlight, as he appeared to be happily linked to a number of famous and glamorous actresses: Melissa Gilbert, Heather Locklear, Rebecca DeMornay, Cher and Penelope Cruz. He married Mimi Rodgers and later, Nicole Kidman. Twenty years after their divorce, Kidman still makes headlines anytime she delicately talks about their 11-year marriage.\n\nCruise was very public as he began to romance the much-younger, then-26-year-old Holmes in 2005. Excessively public, his producing partners and publicists might say. Cruise, then 42, famously jumped on Oprah Winfrey‘s couch and proclaimed he was “in love,” to which Oprah said, “The boy is gone.” Holmes and Cruise became parents to Suri in April 2006, and they married in a lavish, star-studded wedding in an Italian castle in November 2006.\n\nAfter Holmes filed for divorce, Cruise became the target of years of negative reports about his controlling behavior and allegations that his romantic choices were guided by his allegiance to the Church of Scientology.\n\nA detailed 2012 Vanity Fair report described how Cruise divorced Kidman and broke up with Cruz in 2004 because they didn’t sufficiently embrace the Scientology’s teachings. Vanity Fair also reported that the church staged “an elaborate auditioning process” to find Cruise’s next girlfriend and potential wife. He had a brief romance with actress and fellow Scientologist, Nazanin Boniadi, during which he “overwhelmed her with the intensity of his affection,” Vanity Fair said.\n\nScientology and its leader David Miscavige were said to be like “a third person” in Cruise’s marriage to Holmes, Vanity Fair said. Holmes, who also didn’t join Scientology, reportedly became concerned about the influence the organization might have over how Suri. Because of a prenuptial agreement negotiated by Holmes’ attorney father, she was able to quickly resolve her divorce from Cruise and secure custody of Suri, Vanity Fair added.\n\nWith regard to Suri, Cruise also has been the subject of reports that he has largely absented himself from her life because she’s not a Scientologist.\n\nGiven such scrutiny, it’s probably not surprising that Cruise has become shy of getting seriously involved with someone else, or at least being so public when he’s dating someone."
