        "text": "Tom Cruise has had his fair share of failed relationships, but he's still determined to find the right woman.\n\nThe 60-year-old actor is \"totally on the market to date again\", having recently tried (and sadly failed) to spark a romance with Shakira last month.\n\nThe unlikely pair met at the Formula 1 Grand Prix and while Tom was \"very interested in pursuing\" the singer, she wasn't so keen following her split from Gerard Piqué. Shakira reportedly asked Tom to \"leave her alone\" and she is now said to be dating Lewis Hamilton.\n\nBut Shakira isn't the only A-list star Tom has been romantically linked to over the years.\n\nThe actor enjoyed a \"hot and heavy\" romance with Cher, as well as a much-publicised rocky romance with Katie Holmes. Here, we take a look back at Tom's turbulent love life.\n\nCher\n\nTom Cruise once enjoyed a fling with the iconic singer Cher after they first met in 1985 when he was 23 and she was 38.\n\nThe Strong Enough hitmaker had already been married and divorced twice by the time she met Tom at Madonna and Sean Penn's wedding in Malibu.\n\nThe dynamic duo were then reunited at the White House before embarking on a passionate relationship.\n\nCher later gushed about their \"deep connection\" and hailed Tom as one of her \"greatest lovers ever\".\n\nAppearing on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, she revealed: \"I had just the greatest lovers ever. Not a long list. It's just a good list.\"\n\nWhen the TV host grilled Cher about her relationship with Tom, she admitted: \"He wasn't a Scientologist then. It was pretty hot and heavy for a little minute. He's a great guy. The person that I knew was a great and lovable guy.\"\n\nShe added: \"He was in the top five.\"\n\nMimi Rogers\n\nTom married his first wife Mimi Rogers in May 1987, just one year after they first met.\n\nHowever, things weren't meant to be for the couple and they divorced after three years.\n\nTom admitted he had never experienced love before his relationship with Mimi, telling Rolling Stone magazine in 1987: \"I'd never been in love before. Since I've been with her, it's opened me up a lot.\n\n\"I think it's helped me be a better actor. We live a lot of life together. We share everything… She's my best friend.\"\n\nIt's thought Mimi was one of Tom's first links to the controversial Church of Scientology.\n\nThe actress was raised in the organisation and was one of its \"auditors\" when she first met her ex-husband. She has since left Scientology, although Tom has continued to be a member.\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nTom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were once a Hollywood power couple, having met on the set of Days of Thunder in 1989 while Tom was still married to Mimi Rogers.\n\nThey were instantly drawn to one another and enjoyed a whirlwind romance.\n\nIn fact, the pair were not shy to talk about their sexual connection. In a 1995 Vanity Fair article, Nicole said: \"I thought he was the sexiest man I'd ever seen in my life, so it started on lust.\"\n\nTom added: \"Instant lust, that's what I felt. I thought she was amazingly sexy and stunning.\"\n\nAccording to biographer Andrew Morton, it was this connection which was the catalyst for Tom leaving Mimi.\n\nOnce their divorce was finalised in February 1990, Tom and Nicole got married in Colorado on Christmas Eve of that year.\n\nTogether, the couple adopted two children – Isabella, 30, and Connor, 28.\n\nThe world was stunned when Tom announced they were separating in 2001, cryptically explaining: \"Nicole knows why\".\n\nThe actor filed for divorce while Nicole was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy had appeared to end in miscarriage before Nicole clarified in 2007 it had been an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nPenelope Cruz\n\nPenelope Cruz first met Tom on the set of their 2000 film Vanilla Sky, but he insisted they didn't start dating until his divorce from Nicole was finalised.\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, he said: \"I've never fallen in love with someone I'm working with. It's always been afterwards.\"\n\nAfter three years together, the couple decided to go their separate ways in 2004.\n\nAccording to reports, Penelope had struggled to fit in with Tom's family or get his children to accept her. She was also said to be frustrated with the fact Tom kept in touch with his ex-wife Nicole.\n\nHowever, the couple said their busy work schedules were to blame for the split.\n\nNazanin Boniadi\n\nShortly after his split from Penelope, Tom was linked to British actress Nazanin Boniadi and they dated from November 2004 until January 2005.\n\nYears after their split, a Vanity Fair article claimed Scientology leaders had decided to make it their mission to find Tom a new partner.\n\nThe publication claimed a number of women had \"auditioned\" to be Tom's girlfriend, with Nazanin being the lucky lady who was selected.\n\nBoth Tom and the Church of Scientology have strongly denied these claims and Nazanin has since left the religious organisation.\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nIn April 2005, Tom embarked on a very high profile relationship with Katie Holmes.\n\nThe couple made their first public appearance together in Rome before welcoming their daughter Suri together in April 2006.\n\nTom and Katie married at Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy that November in a Scientologist ceremony.\n\nTom, who is 11 years Katie's senior, famously declared his love for Katie during an interview with Oprah Winfrey where he jumped up and down on the couch as he gushed about his wife.\n\nHowever, their relationship was surrounded by controversy before Katie eventually filed for divorce in June 2012.\n\nWhen the pair announced they were expecting their first child together, doctors criticised Cruise for buying his own at-home ultrasound machine so he could keep an eye on Katie's womb.\n\nTom also insisted that Katie stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri.\n\nAccording to Scientologists, labouring women should avoid screaming, groaning or even talking lest their words cause trauma to their newborn.\n\nEven doctors and other staff attending the birth should refrain from speaking, according to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's rules.\n\nAccording to the terms of their divorce, Katie was reportedly not allowed to mention their marriage or date anyone publicly for five years after her split from Tom.\n\nA source told Radar: \"She's allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she's not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri.\"\n\nHayley Atwell\n\nTom was rumoured to be dating his Mission Impossible co-star Haley Atwell from 2021 until 2022.\n\nWhile the pair never addressed romance rumours, they did attend Wimbledon together in 2021.\n\nSpeaking about their alleged split, a source told The Sun: \"Unfortunately it hasn't worked out for them. They have now decided they are better as friends.\"\n\nThey also said the public attention was too much for them to handle.\n\nIn May 2023, Hayley broke her silence on claims she and Tom had dated and said the pair share \"platonic love\".\n\nShe explained to Country Town & House Magazine: \"What I feel is the truly extraordinary power of platonic love, which seems to be sometimes under-represented.\n\n\"And my love for Tom, my love for the process of this [Mission], and also the people who they keep very close to them and who are very present on set, has a wholesomeness to it. That for me, I just found so beautiful, so, yeah, I can freely say 'I love this group of people'.\"\n\nShakira\n\nTom was thought to be \"extremely interested in pursuing\" Shakira after they met at the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Miami.\n\nA source has said there was \"chemistry\" between the two stars who were seen chatting in a private hospitality suite at the Miami International Autodrome.\n\nTom is even thought to have brought Shakira flowers during their meeting.\n\nSpeaking about Tom's feelings for Shakira, a source said: \"He is extremely interested in pursuing her. There is chemistry.\"\n\n\"Shakira needs a soft pillow to fall on, and that could be Tom,\" the source told Page Six, before adding that he is \"a nice-looking guy, and he is talented.\"\n\nHowever, Shakira didn't seem quite so keen, with reports she has been \"begging him to stop flirting with her\".\n\nA source told Heat magazine Shakira was simply being \"friendly\" and posing for photos with Tom.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
