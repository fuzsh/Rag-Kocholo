        "text": "SINCE his divorce from Katie Holmes, Tom Cruise has been romantically linked to several women.\n\nPreviously, the Mission Impossible actor also dated Penélope Cruz and Hayley Atwell.\n\nWho has Tom Cruise dated?\n\nMelissa Gilbert\n\nBefore Tom Cruise achieved his mainstream breakthrough, he dated Melissa Gilbert.\n\nThe Little House on the Prairie actress revealed she and Tom romanced each other during their teenage years.\n\nWhile stopping by Watch What Happens Live, Melissa told Andy Cohen: \"Actually, when I dated him, he was Tom Mapother still.\n\n\"It was when he first moved to Los Angeles and I think I was 16, maybe, or 17?\n\n\"I did not have sex with him. We made out, but honestly, there was no sex.\n\n\"He was a good kisser. But, you know, he was, like, a struggling, starving actor. I actually bought him his first set of dishes.\"\n\nRebecca De Mornay\n\nAccording to Tom's Risky Business co-stars, he and Rebecca De Mornay had a brief romance during the hit comedy film's production.\n\nAt the time of reports, Tom and Rebecca's fling coincided with the latter's relationship with Harry Dean Stanton.\n\nThe former co-stars are believed to have split in 1985.\n\nAfter Tom and Rebecca called it quits, the former moved on with Cher and the latter went on to marry Bruce Wagner.\n\nCher\n\nOn August 16, 1985, Tom met Cher at Madonna and Sean Penn's wedding in Malibu, California.\n\nSoon after, the Top Gun star and the Grammy Award winner crossed paths again at a White House event.\n\nRegarding her courtship with Tom, Cher recalled to ET: \"It was a long, long time ago, and neither one of us ever talked about it, and I don’t know why.\n\n\"When we were together, he was such a private person. He always has been until lately.\n\n\"He didn’t mention it and I didn’t mention it. I loved him though, he was amazing.\n\n\"I loved him though, he was amazing. Now, it's hard for me to look at this person and this press.\n\n\"How many times can I watch him jumping up and down on Oprah's couch?\"\n\nShe said of their split: \"It was after Risky Business and right before The Color of Money.\n\n\"I couldn't go to Chicago and that was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back.\"\n\nPenélope Cruz\n\nFollowing Tom's second divorce from Nicole Kidman, he began dating Penélope Cruz.\n\nThe Vanilla Sky co-stars were first spotted together in July 2001; they met while filming the aforementioned movie in late 2000.\n\nAfter three years of dating, Tom and Penélope split at the end of January 2004.\n\nAt the time, an insider told People: \"The relationship just ran its course and they decided not to be girlfriend and boyfriend anymore.\n\n\"Through most of the relationship, they were both shooting movies in separate parts of the world.\n\n\"They remain good friends and still talk often. There is no other person involved.\"\n\nWhile Penélope moved on with Matthew McConaughey, Tom started dating Sofia Vergara.\n\nSofia Vergara\n\nIn February 2005, Tom was spotted on a date with Sofia Vergara in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, the relationship rumors quickly fizzled out.\n\nYears later in August 2023, it was reported that the Tropic Thunder star was looking to reconnect with Sofia; the speculation eventually faded.\n\nA source shared with Heat: \"It’s always eaten away at Tom that he dumped Sofia and chose Katie [Holmes] instead, which turned out to be a disaster in the end.\n\n\"In hindsight, he does admit that Sofia would have been a far better match, even if he does think she’s feisty.\n\n\"She checks almost every box for Tom. She’s stunningly beautiful, enormously successful, and isn't prepared to settle for second best.\n\n\"The physical attraction's there, and Tom's convinced that, together, they could be a Hollywood power couple.\n\n\"He’s been putting out the feelers through mutual friends, and if she bites, he’s all set to pounce.\"\n\nHayley Atwell\n\nOn December 17, 2020, it was revealed Tom had begun dating his Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One co-star Hayley Atwell.\n\nAn insider confirmed to The Sun: \"Tom and Hayley hit it off from day one.\n\n\"Lockdown, and all the difficulties that came with it, brought them even closer and they’ve become fairly inseparable.\n\n\"They’ve been meeting up after hours, and she’s been to his London pad. They get on brilliantly, and both seem very happy.\"\n\nOn June 11, 2022, it was announced Tom and Hayley broke up for a third and final time.\n\n\"Tom and Hayley’s relationship was genuine,\" a source explained to the abovementioned outlet.\n\n\"In spite of some rumors to the contrary, it was never just for the cameras.\n\n\"Unfortunately it hasn’t worked out for them. They have now decided they are better as friends.\n\n\"They get on really well and have fantastic chemistry, which is why they decided to quietly give the relationship another try earlier this year.\n\n\"But what was working behind closed doors didn’t work out so well when it was made public, and the fanfare around them as a couple exploded again.\"\n\nShakira\n\nOn May 8, 2023, Tom Cruise was rumored to be dating Shakira after the two were photographed together at that month's Formula 1 Grand Prix.\n\nEventually, the speculation was debunked as talks of the two as a couple died down.\n\nAccording to Us Weekly: \"Shakira has seen the online rumors that Tom has been courting her and how fans are chiming in with their opinions.\n\n\"She thinks it’s hilarious because it’s just not true. She had a fun time when they chatted, but that’s as far as things have gone.\n\n\"She has a lot on her plate and is focused on her kids and career for now.\"\n\nElsina Khayrova\n\nIn December 2023, Tom started dating Elsina Khayrova; the daughter of Russian politician Rinat Khayrova.\n\nAn insider stated to The Sun: \"With all their millions, Tom and Elsina can live the high life and never have to be near the public.\n\n\"But since they’ve been in London, they have been going out and about without anyone noticing them.\"\n\nIn February 2024, Tom and Elsina split up after being together since the end of 2023.\n\nA friend also revealed that while the two have broken up, both Tom and Elsina wanted to remain friends as they both live in the same apartment block in London.\n\nWho are Tom's ex-wives?\n\nMimi Rogers\n\nTom's first marriage was to Mimi Rogers; on May 9, 1987, they wedded in Bedford, New York.\n\nBy February 4, 1990, the former couple's divorce was finalized.\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nOn December 24, 1990, Tom tied the knot with Nicole Kidman.\n\nThey share two children together; a son named Connor and a daughter Isabella.\n\nAfter 11 years of marriage, Tom and Nicole's divorce was finalized on August 8, 2001.\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nOn November 18, 2006, Tom walked down the aisle with his third wife Katie Holmes.\n\nThe former couple share one child together, a daughter named Suri.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Tom and Katie's divorce was final; the latter was granted primary custody of Suri.\n\nIn a statement, a rep for the Batman Begins actress shared: \"This is a personal and private matter for Katie and her family.\n\n\"Katie's primary concern remains, as it always has been, her daughter's best interest.\""
