        "text": "June 29 this year officially marks five years since Katie Holmes shocked the world and filed for divorce from Tom Cruise.\n\nFrom the outside, these couch-jumping cuties looked to be the picture of happiness.\n\nWith their adorable daughter Suri Cruise, matching haircuts, grandiose public declarations of love and of course their strong Scientology beliefs in tow, everyone though TomKat were in it for the long haul.\n\nBut five years on, we now know that was so far from the truth.\n\nOn the anniversary of their split, here are the most weirdest, wildest and downright bizarre moments from their relationship…\n\n1. The time they did a cabaret dance together\n\nAccording to reports at the time, Tom wasn’t too happy about Katie pursuing her acting career and she was told to let go of several jobs – most notably her role on The Dark Knight.\n\nBut when you’re two talented stars, there’s no reason you can’t put on your own damn show. And that’s exactly what they did for a charity gala in LA in 2010.\n\nTaking to the stage to perform a very sexy rendition of Whatever Lola Wants from the musical Damn Yankees, Katie’s hips and vocal cords were given the work out of their life while a muted Tom sauntered across the stage, cast under his wife’s spell.\n\nThe footage is perhaps the most underrated gem of their entire romance.\n\nWatch it below and bask in how unsettling it feels…\n\n2. Those silent birth claims and the mystery surrounding Suri Cruise\n\nThese days, 11-year-old Suri Cruise is all grown up and the perfect mix of her mum and dad.\n\nBut in the lead up to her birth, the rumourmill went into overdrive with wild conspiracy theories with the most rogue of which suggesting Tom wasn’t her father and they’d used frozen sperm from Scientology’s creator L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nOther reports alleged that under the rules of Scientology, Katie was instructed to have a silent birth and the church had even made her a dummy to help her stay quiet.\n\nAt the time, Tom was quick to clear up how a silent birth works telling Diane Sawyer on Primetime: “It’s basically just respecting the mother, you know, and helping to be quiet — not the mother. The mother makes as much noise… you know, she’s going through it.”\n\n“But why have other people make noise? You know, you want that area very calm and to make it very special.”\n\nHands up if you still don’t really understand?\n\nTom also slammed rumours the actress was having a drug-free birth.\n\n“She does what she’s gotta do, OK? …We’re there you know, with doctors.”Whatever the woman wants. I’m not gonna tell Kate …you know, if she needs an epidural, she’s gonna get her epidural.”\n\nPreach Tom, preach!\n\nSuri fast became Hollywood’s most elusive baby with the couple waiting five months to introduce her to the world via a stunning Vanity Fair cover, shot by Annie Leibovitz in 2006.\n\nDismissing speculation there was a sinister reason behind delaying Suri’s unveiling, Tom told the publication: “We were just living our lives, being a family. Actually, we were taking our own photos and always planned to release those at the right time.”\n\n3. Remember when they rocked up to a red carpet event on a motorbike for no apparent reason?\n\nAside from the couch jumping, this has to be one of the most cringe moments in their entire relationship.\n\nClad in his and her leather jackets, Tom and Katie arrived at the 2005 War of the Worlds premiere in LA together on a motorbike because… well, no one really knows why.\n\nAnd this well orchestrated and most definitely rehearsed dip kiss at the New York premiere of the film comes a close second in their PDA hall of shame:\n\n4. Everyone had matching bowl cuts\n\nYou’re not a power couple until you coordinate your aesthetics, right? And Tom and Katie fell victim to some very acute bowl cuts circa 2007.\n\nEven little Suri got in on the action with a matching cropped cut.\n\n5. Call me Kate\n\nApparently when they first got together, Tom’s vision was for his new partner to be re-branded as “Kate Cruise.”\n\nDuring an interview with All Headline News, Tom reportedly explained his reasoning behind the name change: “Katie is a young girl’s name. Her name is Kate now – she’s a child-bearing woman.”\n\nThe Hollywood heavyweight often referred to her as Kate, most famously in their divorce statement in 2012, which read: “Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children. Please allow them their privacy.”"
