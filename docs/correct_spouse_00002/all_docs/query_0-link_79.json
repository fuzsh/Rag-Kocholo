        "text": "When she was only 8 years old, he was already cementing his status as a superstar thanks to the 1986 Tony Scott's movie “Top Gun”, that really took many breaths away. In 1997, she won the part of Joey Potter on world-famous American TV series Dawson's Creek and he was awarded a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Jerry Maguire. At the time, Tom Cruise was still married to fabulous Nicole Kidman and nobody thought they would ever break up; however, the Days of Thunder couple filed for divorce in 2001 and four years later, Cruise declared his love for Dawson's former best friend on the Oprah Winfrey Show (famously jumping up and down on Oprah's couch!).\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise got engaged in Paris in the spring of 2005 and pronounced the fateful “yes” on November, 18th 2006 at Castello Orsini-Odescalchi, on the southern shore of Lake Bracciano, about 40 km from the Eternal City; you have to know that this 15th-century fortress is considered by many as one of the best-preserved in Italy and its long history is closely tied to the one of the Borgias and the Orsini family.\n\nCelebrations began on Thursday, November 16th, Tom and Kat kicked off the long week-end with a wine toast at one of Tom's favorite local restaurants; Rome was literally filled with celebrities scaling the Spanish steps (from Jim Carrey to David Beckham and family), doing luxury shopping and smiling at jubilant passers-by on the beautiful streets. On the following evening, the bride's parents hosted a rehearsal dinner at Villa Aurelia (a mansion from the 17th century) and everybody celebrated past midnight.\n\nOn the big day, shortly after sunset, all the guests were greeted at Odescalchi Castle by flag bearers in colorful Renaissance costumes and seated inside an ancient armory entirely filled with candles; Katie walked down the aisle in an ivory silk wedding dress created by Giorgio Armani and Tom looked at her for a moment that seemed to last an eternity before placing a platinum-and-diamond Cartier Dia Eternity band on her finger. The sweetest kiss followed, of course.\n\nAfter the ceremony, everybody made their way to a reception in the castle's Grand Hall and the bride danced with her dad to the tune of Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World; a huge white chocolate mousse cake was cut and later the whole group moved to a courtyard, where an impressive fireworks display exploded.\n\nIs that it? Absolutely not! After the fireworks, everybody partied until the wee hours with DJ Mark Ronson; the groom started singing along with The Righteous Brothers \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\" (not to Kelly McGillis but to Katie of course :-) ) and when a Jennifer Lopez song came on, J. Lo started performing live in the middle of the hall.\n\nTom and Katie wanted a real fairy tale and paid a fortune to make it come true... Unfortunately, it didn't last long enough, but still a beautiful baby girl remains and a lot of good memories too.\n\nYou want to get married in Italy and you don't know where to start?
