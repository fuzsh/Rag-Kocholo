The launch of the label will be connected to the premiere of Side by Side on Friday evening March 6. The Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century then plays side by side with students of Early Music from the Royal Conservatoire performing Haydn and Mozart. During this premiere, the recording of Side by Side (2019 edition) will be symbolically offered to Teunis van der Zwart, the new head of the Early Music Department, gifted horn player and member of the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century. From that moment on different recordings will be made available in the months that follow, including:

Viola concerto (Henk Badings) performed by the Orchestra of the Royal Conservatoire conducted by Jac van Steen, with soloist Elisa Karen Tavenier;

Stravinsky String Quartet by the Babylon Quartet;

Opposite Pieces by Martijn Padding, performed by Coraline Groen and Robbrecht van Cauwenberghe;

Video recordings of the master class that John Adams (winner of the Erasmus Prize) gave to composition students of the Royal Conservatoire in the fall of 2019.
