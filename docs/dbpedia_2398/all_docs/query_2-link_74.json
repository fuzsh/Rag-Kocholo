        "text": "The 38th edition of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, which will run Feb. 8-18, will open with Miranda’s Victim, one of 52 world premieres in this year’s lineup, and will close with the U.S. premiere of I Like Movies, one of 78 U.S. premieres, the fest announced Wednesday.\n\nThese are, of course, in addition to a slew of the career-retrospective tributes for which the fest is famous, which this year will celebrate the likes of Cate Blanchett, Brendan Fraser, Angela Bassett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, as well as panels with breakthrough artists, artisans, directors, writers, producers, female creatives and international filmmakers.\n\nThe fest will also offer a variety of free educational programs, including Mike’s Field Trip to the Movies (for 4,000-plus fourth through sixth grade students from low-income schools throughout Santa Barbara County), which this year will feature a screening of Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio followed by a Q&A with filmmaker Guillermo del Toro; and Film Studies Program (for 30 undergraduate film students invited from across the country), which provides priority access to films, panels, filmmaker seminars and tributes, as well as intimate Q&As with filmmakers.\n\n“At a time where there’s a dwindling of movie theater attendance, the role of film festivals has never been more important,” SBIFF executive director Roger Durling said in a statement. “At SBIFF, with the 38th edition, our marching orders are clear: to celebrate movies and to nurture and exalt the film community, the artists as well as the cinephiles. It’s a great slate with 43 countries represented.”\n\nOpener Miranda’s Victim recounts the story of an 18-year-old woman who was kidnapped and brutally raped in 1963, and whose fight to bring her attacker to justice triggers a law that transforms the nation. Directed by Michelle Danner, it stars Abigail Breslin, Ryan Phillippe, Luke Wilson, Donald Sutherland, Mireille Enos and Andy Garcia.\n\nI Like Movies, the closer, tells the story of a 17-year-old cinephile who lands a job at a video store, where he forms a complicated friendship with his older female manager. Directed by Chandler Levack, it stars Isaiah Lehtinen, Romina D’Ugo, Krista Bridges and Percy Hynes White.\n\nBelow is the full festival screening lineup …\n\n30 WORLD PREMIERE FEATURE FILMS (listed alphabetically)\n\n21 Miles in Malibu\n\nDirected by Nic Davis\n\nUnited States\n\nAmerican Outlaws\n\nDirected by Sean McEwen\n\nUnited States\n\nBringing Back Our Wetland\n\nDirected by Michael Love\n\nUnited States\n\nBullets\n\nDirected by Peter Pontikis\n\nSweden\n\nCall Me Dancer\n\nDirected by Leslie Shampaine, Pip Gilmour\n\nUnited States\n\nCommitment to Life\n\nDirected by Jeffrey Schwarz\n\nUnited States\n\nDancing With Mom\n\nDirected by Trish Neufeld\n\nCanada\n\nThe Dirty Divide\n\nDirected by Paul Freedman\n\nUnited States\n\nDr. Tony Fauci\n\nDirected by Mark Mannucci\n\nUnited States\n\nFull Circle\n\nDirected by Josh Berman\n\nUnited States\n\nGo On, Be Brave\n\nDirected by Miriam McSpadden, Brian Beckman\n\nUnited States\n\nGrace Point\n\nDirected by Rory Karpf\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Harvest\n\nDirected by Caylee So\n\nUnited States\n\nHELEN|BELIEVE\n\nDirected by Dylan Mulick\n\nUnited States\n\nThe House Band\n\nDirected by Laura Brownson\n\nUnited States\n\nIbiza Blue (La corriente)\n\nDirected by Jesús Lloveras\n\nSpain\n\nKaren Carpenter: Starving for Perfection\n\nDirected by Randy Martin\n\nUnited States\n\nKilling Me Softly With His Songs\n\nDirected by Danny Gold\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Legend of MexMan\n\nDirected by Josh Polon\n\nUnited States\n\nMiranda’s Victim\n\nDirected by Michelle Danner\n\nUnited States\n\nRachel Hendrix\n\nDirected by Victor Nuñez\n\nUnited States\n\nRachel’s Farm\n\nDirected by Rachel Ward\n\nAustralia\n\nThe Right to Read\n\nDirected by Jenny Mackenzie\n\nUnited States\n\nSamichay, in Search of Happiness (Samichay, en busca de la felicidad)\n\nDirected by Mauricio Franco Tosso\n\nPeru\n\nThe Team (El equipo)\n\nDirected by Bernardo Ruiz\n\nUnited States\n\nTove’s Room (Toves værelse)\n\nDirected by Martin Zandvliet\n\nDenmark\n\nVishniac\n\nDirected by Laura Bialis\n\nUnited States\n\nVoices Rising: The Music of Wakanda Forever\n\nDirected by Bernardo Ruiz\n\nWade in the Water: A Journey Into Black Surfing and Aquatic Culture\n\nDirected by David Mesfin\n\nUnited States\n\n53 U.S. PREMIERE FEATURE FILMS (listed alphabetically)\n\nAlam\n\nDirected by Firas Khoury\n\nPalestine\n\nAutobiography\n\nDirected by Makbul Mubarak\n\nIndonesia\n\nBaby Ruby\n\nDirected by Bess Wohl\n\nUnited States\n\nA Bit of Light\n\nDirected by Stephen Moyer\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nBlack Mambas\n\nDirected by Lena Karbe\n\nGermany\n\nBones of Crows\n\nDirected by Marie Clements\n\nCanada\n\nBread and Salt (Chleb i sól)\n\nDirected by Damian Kocur\n\nPoland\n\nA Bunch of Amateurs\n\nDirected by Kim Hopkins\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Chambermaid (Sluzka)\n\nDirected by Mariana Čengel Solčanská\n\nSlovakia\n\nCoyote (Le coyote)\n\nDirected by Katherine Jerkovic\n\nCanada\n\nDaughter of Rage (La hija de todas las rabias)\n\nDirected by Laura Baumeister\n\nNicaragua\n\nDear Memories\n\nDirected by Nahuel Lopez\n\nGermany\n\nEverybody Wants to Be Loved (Alle wollen geliebt werden)\n\nDirected by Katharina Woll\n\nGermany\n\nExodus\n\nDirected by Abbe Hassan\n\nSweden\n\nFathers & Mothers (Fædre og mødre)\n\nDirected by Paprika Steen\n\nDenmark\n\nFilip\n\nDirected by Michał Kwiecinski\n\nPoland\n\nThe Hotel (Lu guan)\n\nDirected by Wáng Xiăoshuài\n\nChinese Hong Kong\n\nHow is Katia?
