        "text": "2021 CARE Conference - Accounting for Sustainability and Responsible Investing\n\nThank you for your interest in Accounting for Sustainability and Responsible Investing. We look forward to continuing our discussion at the 2022 CARE Conference.\n\nTo view the 2021 Conference Panels on demand, please visit YouTube here.\n\nThe 2021 CARE Accounting for Sustainability and Responsible Investing Conference was held in cooperation with Sustainable Investment Forum North America 2021. The Forum is the largest finance forum during Climate Week NYC, in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI). The Sustainable Investment Forum North America has run for 3 years in official partnership with UNEP-FI, with the mission to mobilise sustainable investment towards a 1.5°C world.\n\nThe Sustainable Investment Forum North America convened a global online audience representing asset owners and investment managers, institutional investors, pension funds, banks, development banks, policymakers, think tanks, and NGOs to continue to build the momentum for sustainable finance and responsible investment. For more details on the Sustainable Investment Forum North America conference, please visit https://www.climateaction.org/events/digital/sustainable-investment-forum-north-america-2021.\n\nThe 2021 CARE conference is the first of two conferences on the topic Accounting for Sustainability and Responsible Investing. The second will have a similar focus, highlighting select academic research papers that are based on discussions held at this year's conference and will be held in November, 2022. Watch the CARE website for additional details.\n\nThese conferences will bring together accountants, finance-professionals, law-professionals, law-makers, standard-setters, economists, investors and scientists as well as academics from the sciences, accounting, finance, law and economics. As with all CARE conferences, the main goal will be to set a research agenda for many emerging scholars, which will address key issues related to accounting for sustainability and responsible investing. We look forward to your participation in the discussion of the critical issues of accounting for sustainability and responsible investing.\n\nBroadcast Time Zone\n\nEST / BST\n\nDay 1 - September 22, 2021\n\n11:00 / 16:00\n\nWelcome Remarks - click here for video\n\nPeter Easton, Notre Dame Alumni Professor of Accountancy and Academic Director, CARE;
