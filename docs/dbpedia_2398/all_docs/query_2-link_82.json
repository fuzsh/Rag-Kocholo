        "text": "Dutch immigrant integration policies have often been labelled ‘multiculturalist’. This article empirically and conceptually challenges the idea of a Dutch multicultural model. First, it deconstructs the image that Dutch policies would have been driven by a single, coherent and consistent model, by drawing attention to the much more dynamic processes of problem framing, frame-shifts and frame conflicts that characterize Dutch policymaking. Second – and as a result of this dynamic perspective – it will become clear that Dutch policies were not that multicultural at all. Adopting a neo-institutionalist perspective, it reconceptualizes ‘models of integration’ as specific discourses or ‘frames’. On the basis of a rigorous analysis of policy documents and public debate (media records and parliamentary records), as well as an extensive review of the Dutch and international literature, the article analyzes how immigrant integration policies in the Netherlands have been framed over the past ...\n\nIn the 1980 and 1990s, Dutch society was in a state of metastability. It was in distress and needed little to get ignited. The combination of dramatic events on the world stage with bad-temperedness, adventurism and irresponsibility within the national arena provided the spark. The ensuing turn against immigrants and refugees can be seen as a ritual – a negative ritual – reaffirming the solidarity among those who participate at the expense of those who are being excluded and vilified. The latter may return the compliment, as small numbers of young male Muslims did in a radical fashion. The spiral of fanaticization eventually produces a self-fulfilling prophecy."
