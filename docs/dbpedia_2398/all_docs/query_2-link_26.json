        "text": "Spinnin' Records hit 30 million subscribers on YouTube, so naturally we went all out with a multi layered digital and OOH! We partnered with YouTube on a 6 episode animated series Spinnin' Infinity that you can watch now on YouTube Shorts, a companion digital scavenger hunt (spinninfinity.com) and culminating on the big screens at the one and only New York's Times Square. Dan Chalmers, Vice President of YouTube Music EMEA spoke with Susanne Hazendonk, Spinnin's Vice President Marketing at International Music Summit Ibiza, read the conversation over on YouTube's blog:\n\nLast Thursday was pretty special. The music industry is famously hard to break into. The barrier of entry can seem unreachably high, and requires more than talent alone. That's why it is such a privilege to share invaluable information with aspiring producers and up and coming talent. Spinnin' Records and CUPRA Nederland, as part of our Impulse of a New Generation partnership were delighted to host a powerful music industry masterclass, with speakers from Pioneer PRO AUDIO, Spinnin's own Mr Belt & Wezol, Millean, and VP of marketing Susanne Hazendonk. And there's more to come. Producers still have until the middle of next week to share their demos with us. 8 finalists will enjoy a Demo Ride with Mr Belt & Wezol, 4 will perform in the Cupra City Garage and the 2 will be invited to a 1-1 studio session. One winner will be released on Spinnin’ Talent pool. Find out more at: https://lnkd.in/ezXr-JWj"
