This study addresses what steps should be taken to determine the content of a job-specific WHS for hospital physicians and outlines that content.\n\nMethods\n\nBased on four questions, decision trees were developed for physical and psychological job demands and for biological, chemical, and physical exposures to decide whether or not to include work-related health effects related to occupational exposures or aspects of health reflecting insufficient job requirements. Information was gathered locally through self-reporting and systematic observations at the workplace and from evidence in international publications.\n\nResults\n\nInformation from the decision trees on the prevalence and impact of the health- or work-functioning effect led to inclusion of occupational exposures (e.g., biological agents, emotionally demanding situations), job requirements (e.g., sufficient vision, judging ability), or health effects (e.g., depressive symptoms, neck complaints). Additionally, following the Dutch guideline for occupational physicians and based on specific job demands, screening for cardiovascular diseases, work ability, drug use, and alcohol consumption was included. Targeted interventions were selected when a health or work functioning problem existed and were chosen based on evidence for effectiveness.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe process of developing a job-specific WHS for hospital physicians was described and the content presented, which might serve as an example for other jobs. Before implementation, it must first be tested for feasibility and acceptability.\n\nKeywords: hospital physicians, occupational health strategy, patient safety, prevention, worker's health surveillance\n\n1. Introduction\n\nHospital physicians are exposed to several occupational risk factors that can lead to work-related health complaints. Occupational exposure to biological or chemical substances [1], [2], to physical job demands like adopting uncomfortable and exhausting working postures [3], or to psychological job demands such as experiencing violence [4], or the death of a patient [5] are common in the work of hospital physicians. Work-related health complaints that have previously been associated with occupational exposures in the work of hospital physicians are, among others, complaints in the neck [6], [7] and lower back [3], [7] region and symptoms of stress [8] and burnout [8], [9]. A reduced health status of hospital physicians in relation to work is associated with reduced work ability [8], threatening quality of care, and potentially putting patients' safety at risk [10]. Focusing on prevention or early detection of diminished health might not only increase the well-being of hospital physicians, but could also maintain or improve quality of care and secure patients' safety better.\n\nOne of several preventive occupational health strategies that can be offered to employees to maintain or improve work-related health is a periodic Workers' Health Surveillance (WHS) [11]. In the Netherlands, an employer is required by legislation to periodically offer a WHS to its employees. In a collective agreement the employer and a labor-union can make additional agreements on the frequency and timing of offering a WHS. While the employer is responsible for financing the WHS, an independent occupational health service is primarily responsible for the content and organization of the WHS, which also includes keeping records of the data. Participation of the employee is voluntary.\n\nThe central purpose of the WHS targets prevention of occupational and work-related diseases and injuries [12]. Internationally, WHS aims at detecting unhealthy occupational exposures and/or the prevention or early detection of health complaints that can be related to occupational risk factors [12]. In the Netherlands, WHS encompasses inviting employees to perform medical examinations, followed by an individual consultation with the occupational physician where individual feedback is followed by advice on targeted interventions when applicable [13]. Follow-up consultations are planned with the occupational physician to register to what extent the advice or intervention is followed and/or the work-related health or work-functioning of the employee has improved. On a group level, results of the medical examinations can be reported to the employer together with advice or recommendations on an organizational level.\n\nIn the case of work consisting of specific job demands, interventions to prevent work-related health problems might be directed towards increasing personal abilities to deal with these job demands. Specific job demands are defined as job demands with a risk of work-related health problems or diminished safety that cannot be reduced by adjusting working procedures and that exceed exposure safety levels or average human capacity to meet such demands on a daily basis [14]. To that end, by taking a more health-centered approach, the WHS monitors and promotes an individual's health in relation to work. It focuses particularly on the question of whether worker's health is sufficient to meet the demands of the job [13].\n\nThese purposes of the WHS imply a job-specific approach rather than a general one. Following the International Labor Organization (ILO) guidelines, WHS should take into account the occupational hazards in the workplace and the health requirements of the work, to make sure the surveillance of worker's health is appropriate to the occupational risks of the job [12]. The ILO considers investigating occupational risk factors as part of the WHS; in the Netherlands this is regulated differently and is done prior to the WHS in a so-called structured risk assessment and evaluation. This job-specific approach of a WHS is necessary because in the case of work-related health complaints, attention should be directed at finding the exact mismatch between job demands and the individual's abilities to meet these demands [15]. Furthermore, not only does a job-specific approach of a WHS allow for interventions that best fit with the occupation of interest—therefore increasing the likelihood of effective interventions to increase work functioning—but workers should also be protected from an abundance of screening tests and assessments that do not forecast how well they perform their job [16].\n\nIn conclusion, to maintain and improve the work-related health of hospital physicians, which will positively affect the quality of care and help secure patient safety, a job-specific WHS for hospital physicians should be developed. Because we have observed that a culture is lacking in Dutch hospitals of focusing on preventing work-related health problems, we developed a job-specific WHS for hospital physicians. In this study, the questions of what steps should be taken to arrive at a job-specific WHS and what the content of a job-specific WHS for hospital physicians should be are addressed.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\nTo determine the content of the job-specific WHS for hospital physicians, a decision tree was developed based on answers to four questions ( ). Subdecision trees were developed for the different type of job demands and occupational exposures. Irrespective of the type of demands or occupational exposures, all decision trees were designed to establish whether or not to include work-related health effects known to be related to job demands, or whether or not to include aspects of health that reflect insufficient job requirements of the individual hospital physician to meet the demands of the job.\n\nBefore question 1 of the decision tree could be answered ( ), occupational exposures and job demands in the work of hospital physicians needed to be identified. Information regarding physical job demands was gathered in two ways: through self-reporting or direct observations of hospital physicians of one Academic Medical Center in the Netherlands [8], [17]. Direct observations, to gather data in terms of duration, frequency, and intensity, and data regarding mean and peak energetic load, were performed during the work of 126 hospital physicians [17], [3]. To account for the differences in tasks and activities between several medical specialties, the physical job demands were reported, when possible, for three clusters of medical specialties. The clusters of medical specialties were: (1) observational medical specialties (e.g., Internal Medicine); (2) supportive (e.g., Radiology), and (3) surgical (e.g., General Surgery). Psychological job demands and biological exposures were obtained from evidence-based information from international studies, and locally through self-reporting [8]. Insight into chemical and physical exposure was obtained through international evidence [17]. Once the occupational physical exposures and job demands were identified, they were compared with the guidelines of occupational exposures and job demands, e.g., with Dutch guidelines of occupational exposures and job demands ( , question 1) [18]. When the occupational physical exposures and job demands did not exceed these guidelines, but a considerable proportion of hospital physicians felt bothered by the physical job demand ( , question 1B), it was still considered a potential threat to good health and work-functioning. Question 1PsEx served to gather information regarding the prevalence of emotionally demanding situations, thereby contributing to the evidence base of the WHS. A cut-off of 10% was established beforehand, because this cut-off was used in the final process of deciding on inclusion or exclusion in the WHS. Data that were needed to answer questions 1B and 1PsEx ( ) of the decision tree were obtained locally through self-reporting by 900 hospital physicians and medical residents and through evidence-based information from international literature [8], [17].\n\nRegarding the second and third questions of the decision tree ( ), identifying health- and work-functioning problems that could either be related to the occupational exposures or reflect a lack of resources on the part of the hospital physicians to cope with the job demands, and the prevalence of these health effects among hospital physicians was evaluated by looking for international evidence, and locally through self-reporting by 900 hospital physicians and medical residents [8], [17]. With respect to question three, our expert group of researchers decided to label the prevalence of health effects as ‘high’ when exceeding a prevalence rate of 10% or when this was higher among hospital physicians compared with the general population.\n\nTo answer the fourth research question ( ), our expert group of researchers identified three aspects to decide upon the impact of the specific health- or work functioning problem: (1) whether it bothered the individual worker; (2) whether it led to restrictions in daily work functioning; and (3) whether it posed a potential risk for others. When hardly bothering the individual, hardly restricting daily work function and posing no risk for others, the impact was considered small. The impact was labeled as medium when the health effect was bothering the individual in some way, but was not restrictive in daily work functioning or posing a risk for others. When a health problem was significantly restrictive in daily work functioning and/or formed a potential risk for others, the impact was considered high.\n\nIn the result section, the main focus is on clarifying the content of the WHS, which starts with describing which aspects of the job demands or job requirements should be included in the job-specific WHS based on the results of our decision trees. Subsequently, the results focus on how these aspects were measured in the WHS, how a signal of occupational exposures exceeding health- or safety guidelines or of a reduced health status was detected, and what interventions the occupational physicians could perform in the case of such a signal.\n\n3. Results\n\nFirst of all, the questions of the decision trees were answered for the different types of occupational exposures, job demands, and job requirements. To finally decide whether or not to include the occupational exposure, job requirement or health effect in the job-specific WHS, a priori decision rules were followed that used the information resulting from the questions of the decision trees. For both the physical job demands and the biological, chemical, and physical exposures, screening of the health- or work-functioning problems was included when: (1) the prevalence of the health- or work functioning-effect was high and the impact medium or big; or (2) the prevalence of the health- or work functioning-effect was low or unknown, but the impact big. Regarding the psychological job demands, other rationales were formed. Screening of the health effects was included in the WHS in one of the following cases: (1) prevalence of the emotionally demanding situation was high and the impact medium or big; (2) accidental exposure to the emotionally demanding situation is sufficient to lead to health- or work-functioning problems and the impact of these problems is medium or big; or (3) prevalence of the emotionally demanding situation is low, but the impact is considered big. lists some examples of how these decision trees and decision rules were followed for different occupational exposures, job demands, or job requirements.\n\nTable 1\n\nQuestion 1Question 1BQuestion 2Question 3\n\n(%)Question 4Inclusion WHS?Physical job demandsVDU workYesComplaints in:NeckHigh (31)Medium/highYesShoulderHigh (17)Wrist/HandHigh (13)Fine motor movements\n\n(surgical specialisms)YesComplaints in:NeckHigh (31)Medium/highYesShoulderHigh (17)Wrist/HandHigh (13)Physical job requirementsSufficient visionYesWork-functioning problems due to reduced sightHighYesBiological/chemical exposureBiological agentsYesHepatitis B\n\nHIV\n\nDiarrhea, etc.UnknownHighYesHalothane in ORYesIrritation of skin, eyes and/or respiratory tractUnknownHighYesBenzeneNoUnknownNoPsychological job demandsVerbal aggression by patientsHigh prevalence\n\n(20%)Depressive symptomsHigh (29)HighYesAnxiety symptomsHigh (24)Death of a patient\n\n(once or more during the last 4 wk)High prevalence\n\n(26%)StressHigh (15)HighYesBurnoutLow (6)\n\nIn addition to the inclusion of job demands, occupational exposures, and job requirements resulting from the decision tree, specific or safety job requirements were included in the WHS, given the existing Dutch guidelines for occupational physicians and the guide on specific job demands [18]. For example, the work of hospital physicians requires them to maintain a heightened state of alertness 24/7. In acute complex situations they need to be able to act quickly and adequately. Screening in the WHS on aspects that could negatively affect the ability to maintain this heightened state of alertness was, therefore, found to be feasible and relevant. These aspects include the chosen content of screening for psychological health complaints (e.g., depressive symptoms), drug use, and alcohol consumption. Furthermore, with the aim of maintaining and promoting the health status of hospital physicians in relation to their work, monitoring risk factors for developing cardiovascular diseases was found relevant to be included in the WHS as well. Finally, to detect general problems that might affect the work ability of the hospital physicians, the self-reported Work Ability Index [19] was included, as well as enquiring after all other unaddressed health problems that might affect their work ability.

These interventions were chosen on their evidence for effectiveness and could be targeted at increasing the personal abilities or capacities of the individual hospital physician to cope with the job demands, or they could consist of (ergonomic) measures or medication or act on the individual organization of work interaction to reduce the occupational exposures and/or the resulting health- or work-functioning problems. The interventions were mainly based on existing national and international guidelines, e.g., guidelines of the Netherlands Society of Occupational Medicine (NVAB).

Discussion\n\nIn this study, we described the development and content of a job-specific WHS for hospital physicians and medical residents. Information regarding occupational exposures, job demands, work-related health effects, and job requirements was used to follow a step-wise decision process aimed at deciding which job-specific aspects should be included in the WHS. By taking this approach, the ILO guidelines were followed to ensure that the WHS was based on occupational exposures, job demands, and job requirements of the job at hand [12]. Such a job-specific approach of a WHS is widely advocated above a general approach because it enables interventions that best fit the occupation of interest and is, therefore, most likely to increase the effectiveness of the interventions. However, the process of arriving at a job-specific WHS in this way is not widely spread or known and has not been described in international literature. Therefore, the step-wise procedure described in this study sheds an important light on how to decide on the content of a job-specific WHS and might, therefore, serve as a good example for developing a WHS in other (high-demand) jobs.\n\nAs a consequence of the lack of clear descriptions of how to arrive at the content of a job-specific WHS, some of the decisions made in the step-wise procedure are expert-based and lack an evidence-based foundation. Our decisions were guided by taking into account the main purposes of the WHS as described in the Dutch guideline [13]: to prevent work-related health complaints and to maintain or improve the health and work ability of hospital physicians. To arrive at these goals, the guideline describes what to consider in each of the different steps in developing a job-specific WHS and, therefore, served as an aid, although it required us to give the exact interpretation of each of these steps for the specific job of hospital physicians. As an example, it guided our decision to include health effects that might be low in prevalence but high in negative effects on health or work ability in order to prevent diminished work-related health and ensure good work functioning and quality of care.\n\nWhile most of the previously reported intervention strategies among hospital physicians have focused on treatment or counseling of hospital physicians or other healthcare workers when they have been reported sick [53], [52], the job-specific WHS developed in this study can serve as a periodic preventive measure for early detection of work-related health effects. In the present hospital settings, the professionals do not adopt a preventive attitude and show a lack of confidentiality, leading to avoidant help-seeking behavior, self-diagnosis, and self-treatment [55], [54], which means that taking a preventive approach is rather new and might be an effective measure to decrease the number of hospital physicians that continue to work while sick [56].\n\nThe quality of work of a hospital physician can be negatively impacted by a reduced health status and can thereby threaten patient safety [10]. For example, the quality of patient interactions is reduced and the risk of making errors is increased when a psychological health complaint is present [58], [59], [57]. Although the main focus of the WHS is usually on the prevention of the negative health effects that can occur due to job demands and occupational exposures of a specific job [12], the negative effects of diminished health on quality of work seem equally important because it might impose risk on others, i.e., patients. Therefore, the job-specific WHS also offers a strategy to maintain or improve quality of care and help secure patient safety.\n\nAlthough the developed job-specific WHS might contribute to maintaining or improving the health of hospital physicians and subsequently act as an aid in maintaining high quality of care, its efficacy and effectiveness needs to be investigated. However, before doing that, it is recommended to focus on potential program failure first and to investigate whether this job-specific WHS for hospital physicians can actually be implemented in practice [60]. One important aspect of effective implementation is that the target population, i.e., hospital physicians, acknowledges the needs and potential benefits of the program for their own health and work functioning [60], [61]. The job-specific approach in developing this WHS by investigating specific job demands, job requirements, and negative health effects helps address this important aspect. In addition to addressing the needs of the target population, it is important to understand the perspectives of all the different stakeholders involved [62], [60]: the board of the hospital, the physician's board, the medical managers of each medical specialty, the occupational health services, and the occupational physician. This is necessary to arrive at the optimal means of communication and organization that will influence the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention [62].\n\nIn conclusion, describing the process of developing a job-specific WHS for hospital physicians, as well as the final content, can serve as an example in taking a more job-specific approach in preventing work-related health and work-functioning problems in other (high-demand) jobs. Due to the job-specific nature, the WHS for hospital physicians can contribute to maintaining good quality of care and securing patient safety by taking care of the care giver.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare."
