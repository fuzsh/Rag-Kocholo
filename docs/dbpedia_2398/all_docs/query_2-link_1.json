        "text": "üìö #BrockReads: This Month's Top Picks for the Curious Minds! Hey LinkedIn Community, I'm launching a book club that's all about diving deep into the realms of challenge, wellness, adventure, and finding enjoyment through reading. Think of it as your monthly mental gym. I'm currently on my 19th book of 2024 for those wondering. üí™üìñ 1. \"The Comfort Crisis\" by Michael Easter: This isn't just a book; it's a wake-up call to embrace discomfort. Easter masterfully nudges us out of our cozy corners and into the wild unknown. 2. \"Wellness\" by Nathan Hill: Ready for a rollercoaster of emotions? Hill's narrative takes us on a journey through the intricacies of well-being in a world that's often anything but well. 3. \"Nomadland\" by Jessica Bruder: A gripping tale that's more than just a story ‚Äì it's a window into the lives of modern-day nomads. Bruder's exploration of this unorthodox lifestyle is both heart-wrenching and eye-opening. 4. \"Sam As Ever\" by Morgan Housel: Housel's take on economics is like a breath of fresh air ‚Äì relatable, real, and ridiculously insightful. Why join? Because, as Fred Smith (Author of Overnight Success) said, ‚ÄúThe common trait of people who supposedly have vision is that they spend a lot of time reading and gathering information, and then they synthesize it until they come up with an idea.‚Äù So, are you in for the ride? üöÄ Let's challenge our perspectives, expand our horizons, and maybe, just maybe, come up with the next big idea. üëá Drop a comment if you're on board and share your thoughts as we journey through these pages together! #BookClub #MindExpansion #ChallengeAccepted\n\nStay Goal-Oriented Facing setbacks? Discover how to stay motivated and achieve your goals, even on rainy days! Today is a rainy day. Do they look like ducks coming out of the pond? Yeah, and they had to shorten the path, too. Couldn't walk enough. The good thing is, yesterday, Dr. Bill got 125% of his goal for work. Today, so far, they had to cut it short in the rain, so, 70% done. Always strive for your goal. If you don't make it, do a little more the next day. It's okay if you don't touch the whole goal every day, don't beat yourself up. Have a goal, set it, keep an eye on it, and keep making progress. Sometimes you go two steps back, like today, they couldn't finish it. Accountability partners make a difference. Siddique made Dr. Bill get out in the rain today, his fault. Yes, all Siddique's fault, always is. If you'd like to receive the upcoming New York Times bestseller 52 Business Hacks, put the hashtag #52BusinessHacks in the comments below.

But instead, I want to talk about a personal favorite book I first read back in 2015: ‚ÄúThe Miracle Morning‚Äù by Hal Elrod. (Let me know if you've read this one!) Books often find us at just the right moment in our lives, and this one showed up at the perfect time for me. After a brief health kick, I'd stopped eating healthy food and exercising. I was anxious and unhappy in both my work and my relationship for reasons I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on. I wasn't sleeping well. While I wasn't at an epic low point, I certainly didn't look around and feel gratitude for the way my life was going. I wish I could remember who recommended this book to me. I'm pretty sure I guffawed at the title, channeled my inner Garfield and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do mornings.‚Äù But I was interested enough in changing things up that I figured I‚Äôd give the book and its approach to morning routines a try. It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say that reading this book transformed my life. Day by day, early morning by early morning, I put the pieces into place that would become a life I truly love. It took years, but I changed jobs, left that relationship, became a full-time traveler, and eventually built my own business from the ground up‚Äîsomething I never thought I‚Äôd do. The story you tell yourself about who you are and what you‚Äôre capable of is everything, and establishing a solid morning routine inspired by the Miracle Morning dramatically changed my story. I created a life I love because I spent the first hour of every day becoming a person who believed I could. I am forever grateful to this book for giving me those tools. While my commitment to my morning practice has ebbed and flowed over the years, The Miracle Morning is on my mind now as I read an early copy of the updated and expanded edition, which is releasing soon. It‚Äôs such a beautiful book‚Äîbetter and more thorough than the original‚Äîand I strongly recommend that even my fellow night owls give it a try. I‚Äôve already pre-ordered another copy as a holiday gift at TheNEWMiracleMorning.com. Anyone want to join me in giving a morning routine a shot BEFORE the new year? #newmiraclemorning\n\nGoal Setting in Rain Rainy days got you down? Find out how to stay on track and meet your goals!

I read the book in a couple of days, I couldn‚Äôt put it down, and started TMM 30-day Challenge on March 11, 2023. I just finished day 247. This book got me through a lay-off, a bad break-up, and some mentally challenging days. There were days when all I wanted to do was sit on my couch and binge watch anything on tv. I was in a bad place, but working TMM SAVERS got me through. It helped me to focus on what I needed to do in my life, to be a productive human being. It helped me see that I was the most important person in my life. That taking care of myself, will allow me to show-up in a more positive way for others. TMM has allowed me to focus on what was not only important in my life, but in my newly formed business. Initially I thought, ok, what is waking up earlier (I am a morning person, by the way) going to do for me and what I need to do on a daily basis? Well, to my surprise, it helped me start my day by taking care of my mental first, e.g., Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, and Scribing. Then the physical, e.g. Exercise, and finally my personal development, e.g. Reading. All these together are your SAVERS, a simple process that everyone can do. A process that will help bring clarity to what you want to achieve in your life. I recommend this book for those who are going through difficult times in their life, those wanting a more positive outlook, those who are stuck in their head, those who want to be Entrepreneurs, those who just need to do things differently, and those who are tired of being tired. You won‚Äôt regret reading this book! Hell, after reading it, you might say, that was interesting but not for me, and that‚Äôs OK too. It might not be for you ‚Äúright now,‚Äù but I tell you, if you do the SAVERS, your life will change for the better. And if you miss a day, just get back to it the next day. Give yourself grace, don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself, no one is perfect. This is about you and no one else. The process is like marathon, not a sprint! I read the original, and am currently waiting for ‚ÄúThe NEW Miracle Morning book, Updated and Expanded Edition.‚Äù You can pre-order it here at TheNEWMiracleMorning.com. Let me know what you think.\n\nTime for my #realnessroundup as I continue to follow the example of the brilliant Kirst Harris and give a genuine look at the good and bad in the week of a #femalefounder. So here we go! This week: - I can't even remember what I did Monday which is a reflection of the length of the week and how busy I've been/ tired I now am. - Tuesday I attended Small Business Britain's round table on leading the way for small businesses in sustainability. I'm not going to lie - when I walked in and saw the breadth of experienced people in the room I had MAJOR imposter syndrome and was worried I wouldn't have anything to add. Despite that fear, I talked a LOT (probably too much). But, I realised I did have a lot to add from the last 2 years of talking to small businesses who are either leading the way when it comes to sustainability, or want to be. It was a great event. - Wednesday I had the great pleasure of going to film at Jami UK's Head Room Cafe, interview the fantastic Karen Wilson (Salamon) and meet Karen Wilson (Salamon) and Nicola Noah and other fantastic people who work and deliver mental health support at the cafe. It's an amazing, welcoming space with delicious food in Golders Green and I recommend everyone check it out. - Getting out of bed Thursday morning I pulled something in my back and have been in pain since. My ADHD paralysis (coupled with being out lots/ expending energy) slowed me down a bit with some of the big tasks I needed to get through this week which is beyond frustrating. - Putting off some of the bigger work I needed to do has positively meant that I've smashed through many outstanding smaller tasks and responses. I've had great calls, emails and interactions with our businesses this week - which is just as, if not more, important. ----- So that's me! The good, bad and the overly talkative. I'd love to hear how other founders' weeks have really been. üëá In 3-6 bullets, share your week's highs and lows - and then post your own realness round-up with the hashtags #founderfriday #realnessroundup\n\nFairies and Boulders I want you to visualize with me on this one. In every top organization, you should see a fairly even mix of Fairies and Boulders. I'm flat-out a Fairy. For Fairies, ideas come like dandelion seeds in a strong breeze. I just pluck them out of the air and throw them at my boss on the regular. I'm married to a Boulder. Boulders take a lot of energy and conviction to move. One day I will have the whimsical thought we should toss our kids in the car and drive to the Grand Canyon! How fun!!! My boulder is the reality check. It isn't so much that he says no but more....have you considered how uncomfortable that drive might be compared to flying? Is the benefit really worth the trade-off? We have these types of discussions all the time. Sometimes I win. Sometimes he wins. The result is a cautiously forward trajectory that keeps our marriage and family on the right path. Fairies tend to make the biggest splash. Everyone gets excited when they read about the newest innovations. Look at that enormous change/risk that bold company is taking! You don't read about the Boulders who quietly reviewed the 100 ideas the Fairies submitted to them before agreeing to one. Boulders are crucial. Not all change is good or necessary. Look at ketchup! It's the perfect Boulder product. It makes a ton of money and requires literally zero innovation over the decades. Don't get me wrong. I bet the Fairies have tried! What if we added pickle relish to ketchup? Dare to dream, am I right?! If I was to run a big fancy company, I would be assessing what mix I have. If your organization is 80% Fairies, I would be extra cautious in embracing big changes. At the very least, I would make sure the Boulders had extra input time for balance. If my organization was 80% Boulders, I would be doing more outreach with my Fairies to get their ideas flowing. Food helps. Cater a lunch. Put the Fairies in a room together and watch the magic happen! It is important to know which you are. I know I am a Fairy and so I seek out the Boulders to test my ideas for their validity. Is it possible to be both? I don't really think so. Everyone I know is strong to one side or the other. Or maybe someone could test that by splitting their organization up into groups. Tell one side they are the Fairies. Tell the other they are the Boulders. Fairies put all your ideas together. Boulders critically evaluate them. It would be an interesting exercise.\n\nReflecting on the twists and turns of 2023, I bid you adieu. What a bumpy road it‚Äôs been. Life, in its unpredictable rhythm, Euphoric highs and disheartening lows. Excitement and disappointment met. Learned and grew. My values guiding me through. Saying goodbye to a loved one, way too soon. Trust bestowed upon the undeserving. A hire that should have been a fire. I stumbled, both figuratively and literally, finding myself with my foot in plaster. At least it was üå∏bright sparkling pink.üå∏ Amidst challenges, lessons learned. Because those stumbles is what life is about. Moments that test resilience and reveal strength, Together stitching the fabric of experience. ùêáùêûùê´ùêû ùêöùê´ùêû ùê¨ùê®ùê¶ùêû ùêöùê¶ùêöùê≥ùê¢ùêßùê† ùê°ùê¢ùê†ùê°ùê•ùê¢ùê†ùê°ùê≠ùê¨ ùê®ùêü 2023:üöÄ ‚úÖAbove all and everything else: seeing my boys grow remains the most precious gift of all. ‚úÖAll the daily 'ordinary' things in life.
