        "text": "EJ Hurkmans\n\nCoordinator and writer of this review and independent review author for: selection based on title and abstract; check for inclusion criteria; assessment of methodological quality; data extraction.\n\nF van der Giesen\n\nIndependent review author for: selection based on title and abstract; check for inclusion criteria; assessment of methodological quality; data extraction.\n\nTPM Vliet Vlieland\n\nIn cases of disagreement between the two independent review authors, Vliet Vlieland made the final decision.\n\nCHM van den Ende\n\nOverview of the whole review process, helped with writing the protocol and review.\n\nAnalysis: in the protocol the analysis consisted of a quantitative analysis and, if a meta‐analysis was not appropriate, a qualitative analysis. Furthermore, an overall grading of the evidence according to Tugwell 2004 was to be applied. During the process of developing this review it was found that there were too many analyses, the readability of the results was not very clear. For this reason we decided to apply a best‐evidence synthesis for all data and, if possible, a meta‐analysis was applied to establish the effect size.\n\nSubgroup analysis: in the protocol we indicated our intention to perform various subgroup analyses. However, in the included studies no specific data were reported for these subgroups, for example separate data for men and women or patients with a high or low disease activity. As a number of studies were quite old, it was considered not feasible to ask for the original data sets.\n\nThis is an update of the withdrawn review \"Dynamic exercise for treating rheumatoid arthritis\" (van den Ende 1998). We changed the title from \"Dynamic exercise therapy for treating rheumatoid arthritis\" into \"Dynamic exercise programs (aerobic capacity and/or muscle strength training) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis\" because we think this is more correct.\n\nIn the protocol we intended to grade the evidence according to the grading system of Tugwell 2004. During the process of analysing the data we used three different methods (meta‐analysis, best‐evidence synthesis, and Tugwell), which did not make the results clear. So for the readibility of this review we decided to perform best‐evidence synthesis and meta‐analysis."
