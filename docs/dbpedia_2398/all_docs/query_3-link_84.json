She came into contact with drugs, had bad boyfriends and became a mother when she was sixteen.&#39; Van de Griendt photographs Maria on Polaroid because of this unique and vulnerable material. It fits the story of Mary. He also did not want to focus on the misery, but especially on the person Maria.",
