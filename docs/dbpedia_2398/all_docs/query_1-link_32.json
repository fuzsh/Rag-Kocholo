        "text": "FAMILY BUSINESS\n\nCastelijn & Beerens in Waalwijk is a renowned family business that has been designing and manufacturing luxury leather goods since 1945. The company was founded when master leather stitcher, Walter Castelijn, and leather cutter, Marinus Beerens, decided to join forces and make leather goods. Now the third generation – Babette and Martijn Beerens – is at the helm and Castelijn & Beerens enjoys an international reputation. The family tradition of quality and craftsmanship is still paramount. Something that is also reflected in the contemporary collection under the RENEE label, launched in 2012.\n\nGUARANTEE\n\nCastelijn & Beerens has stood for pure craftsmanship since its establishment in 1945. We check all our leather goods carefully to make absolutely sure they meet the highest quality standards. Should you discover a defect or imperfection in your purchased product within two years, please contact us. If your complaint is justified, we will, in consultation with you, either repair, reimburse or replace the item. Customer satisfaction has been paramount to us for three generations, and not without reason"
