We are deeply saddened that Professor Zwart passed away in 2004. His lifelong contributions and support of the Dutch community live on through this very special endowment. This scholarship provides funds for students who seek to work and/or study in The Netherlands in any capacity, but with the clear goal to immerse themselves in the language and the culture of The Netherlands.
