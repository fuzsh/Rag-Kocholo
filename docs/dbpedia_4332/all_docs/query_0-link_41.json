        "text": "For my son’s 8th birthday I decided to introduce him to the Star Wars franchise. I saw the original when it was released and it was the first movie i ever saw. I was also a little younger than him at the time, so I figured he’d be ok to watch at least some of the series. He loved it.\n\nThe biggest problem, however, is easily finding the age ratings/classifications for movies all in one place. Of course, IMDB has ratings but doesn’t make it easy, with issues such as not showing in compact view and not having lists in one place (if you search for star wars movies, using advanced search, you still get 60 movies listed!)\n\nSo, I’ve pulled this basic list together for the benefit of other parents. You’ll see that the ratings start off suitable for younger viewers, but as the movies get more modern, the rating goes up. This is very typical, if not a little disappointing too. However, you can certainly get up to 5 out of 9 of the movies with younger viewers, even if they may not understand the subtlety and interplay of them all.\n\nDetails of these movies, such as director, writer etc. are given on the relevant wikipedia page. However, what you won’t get there is the film classification / age rating. That’s why I’ve produced this list so you can easily see how suitable each film is for your kids.\n\nWhat order should I watch Star Wars in?\n\nYou may not know the context to these movies, but they were written as a group of trilogies, and the second group of three was filmed first. So this basically means episode 4/5/6 were the first movies to be released. Then they went “back in time” to make episodes 1/2/3 next.\n\nThis begs the question as to what order to view them in. I was advised by an avid fan to watch them in the order they were made, and I have to say, that has been very satisfactory. After all, that’s the order that the general viewing audience has seen them, and it also means things like special effects develop according to the technology of the time. It’s also the case that the younger ratings apply to the earlier movies.\n\nEpisode IV - A New Hope\n\nEpisode V – The Empire Strikes Back\n\nEpisode VI – Return of the Jedi\n\nEpisode I – The Phantom Menace\n\nEpisode II – Attack of the Clones\n\nEpisode III – Revenge of the Sith\n\nEpisode VII – The Force Awakens\n\nEpisode VIII – The Last Jedi\n\nEpisode IX – The Rise of Skywalker\n\nStar Wars movies in order of production, with year and age classification (UK & US)\n\n1. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) : U | 121 min | Action, Adventure, Fantasy | WATCH\n\n2. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) : U | 124 min | Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\n3. Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1983) : U | 131 min | Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\n4. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) : U | 136 min | Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\n5. Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) : PG | 142 min | Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\n6. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) : 12A | 140 min | Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\n7. Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) : 12A | 138 min | Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi\n\n8. Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) : 12A | 152 min | Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\n9. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) ; 12A | 141 min | Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\nShould I let my child watch these? An explanation of the ratings.\n\nYou’ll see there is a broad correlation between the UK and US ratings for the movies. U and PG map to PG, and 12A maps to PG-13. IN short, the US has a slightly more cautious certification.\n\n“U” is universal in the UK, i.e. no rating, so we started watching Star Wars (A New Hope) at age 8, as I had done when it was released all those decades ago! Most of the older rating comes from the violence (i.e. light saber fights and deaths, explosions etc) not from profanity, nudity etc. In essence the movies are almost entirely about intergalactic politics and fighting!\n\nAfter we had watched up to Attack of the Clones (the last PG) we held off on the others (12A), and have finally watched them at age 11. The 12 and 12A rating in the UK is a little confusing. A 12 means age 12, and a 12-year-old could wander into a cinema alone to see the movie. However, a UK 12A means you can watch younger than 12 if accompanied by an adult - so it’s a bit stronger than PG but still leaves room for parental discretion. It also means a 10 or 11 year-old could be accompanied by an adult to see it.\n\nFrankly, the rating is really all about the fighting/violence. As it is not dark/sadistic, but has a fantastical element (e.g. the weapons are fantasy, there is no blood), it gets the 12A rating. Also, there is no real lingering - so while there may be a death, it’s over in a split second and the movie moves on, and I have tended to find that reading descriptions in advance has made the stronger content seem more significant than it really is in the moment.\n\nThe way I looked at it, my child had basically seen equivalent violence in PG Bond movies (I always recall the bloke who ends up going through the snow-blower) and other parts of Star Wars (including the myriad of memes). In the end I don’t think it was an issue (other than any violence is an issue) and I do not feel it was an error of judgement. So, at age 11, all the movies have been watched.\n\nIf you want a more detailed analysis, why not try asking my customGPT built for the purpose. It was the challenge with unpicking all this information that made me build it, and it was it’s answers for the last 4 movies that convinced me to go ahead and watch them as a family. https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5Fqi5FLVK-movie-maestro-family-flick-finder\n\nAdditional Commentary from my 11 Year old\n\nMy son wanted to add his own perspective and review; this is what he wrote. Note that he has written it as if he is an adult certifier, not just a child viewer, so has tried to adopt a “grown up” persona. When I asked him to clarify “disturbing” he meant scary for the youngest children.\n\nIV - PG because of mildy gruesome scenes (hand gets chopped, skeletons visible)\n\nEmpire Strikes Back - PG because hands getting chopped off and mild violence\n\nROJ - PG - because of fighting and characters that might be considered disturbing.\n\nTPM - PG - because of action fighting in many scenes, gruesome moments such as a creatures head being eaten and disturbing alien characters\n\nAOC - PG/12A on point of view - large battles with disturbing monsters, many examples of action violence and lots of romance\n\nROS [REVENGE OF SITH] - 12 - lot of fighting and violence such as duels, head being chopped of, gruesome murder and also romance covering mild adult topics. gruesome scenes such as grapically burnt man and people with disturbing skin\n\nTFA - 12A - lots of fighting and deaths seen, creepy monster which is quite disturbing and graphic battles\n\nTLA - 12A - fighting and battles, sad and chilling stories, gruesome deaths and people and nudity [low]\n\nROS [RISE OF SKYWALKER] - 12A/12 on point of view - a lot of battles and fighting with high violence such as graphic duels, graphic injuries shown and a character could be considered disturbing\n\n[IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS - VIST IMDB, OVER MOVIE SITES OR WOOKIPEDIA, A STAR WARS FAN BASED VERSION OF WIKIPEDIA FOUND ON FANDOM]\n\nEver since my child grew out of “U” movies and started to move into “PG” territory it’s been a constant search to find the best, family-friendly, kid-friendly movies for us to watch, especially with the extra time that COVID19 lockdown has thrown at us.\n\nAlthough IMDB has millions of titles and meta data in its database, and even offers some data file downloads, it’s not actually straightforward to find a list of just PG movies, certainly not without pulling a whole load of data and organising it properly.\n\nThat’s what I’ve done here, although this is only my “version 1” attempt. I’d like to be able to include the year, user-rating, and classification with this list also, but that remains work-in-progress at the time of writing.\n\nNonetheless, this is a reasonable start. This is a list of the best family movies as rated by IMDB users, with scores between 4.5 and 10, highest rating first. These are all full-length feature-film movies (not TV shows, shorts etc.) and all have a rating of US-G (= UK U) or US-PG (=UK PG). (Again, one of the constraints of IMDB, is you can’t search titles by classification of another country - e.g. UK PG - so this is the best I can do right now). The titles are taken without any restriction on year of production, so some of these are old classics (e.g. see It’s a Wonderful Life at number 3).\n\nAlso, these films are classed as “family” movies, rather than any other - I guess it would be possible to also augment this list with films classed as “action” or “comedy” that are also rated PG, in which case we’d started to see things like Star Wars and Indiana Jones in the list. But I figured that over 1750 movies was not a bad list to start looking through. Happy watching!\n\nThis is probably not the answer you expect, but here is my advice after years of dealing with lego-explosions in a playroom and the almost infinite capacity of my child to fascinate himself with lego creations. He started at age 4.\n\nTotally depends on what type of builder your child is.\n\nSome will thrive on freefrom building and eschew sets.\n\nOthers will love sets and making them, then never touch them (expensive hobby for a few hours' pleasure).\n\nOthers will enjoy sets and then destroy them and make all sorts of stuff and you'll wonder why you spent all that money (my son is the latter).\n\nJust start small and see what type of joy they get from which modus operandi when introducing a child to lego.\n\nHowever, I really would say, I have been burnt by trying to get cheap copies - quality is so variable that I regret it ever getting mixed with the real Lego. So, better to buy second hand lego, than new \"lego compatible\" IMHO.\n\nAlso, don't over taxonomise. Lego make 13,000 different pieces and thus there are nearly any infinite number of ways to organise. Again, see how your child builds and searches and take it from there. Lego builders recognise there is no perfect taxonomy. A lot of people instinctively start to sort/organise by colour, but actually that doesn't necessarily make great sense. Colour is generally easy to pick out in a mixed collection of pieces, so sorting by shape/size is much more helpful.\n\nI over-sorted for my child and basically I did a ton of work sorting and he just ruined it all the time and was never bothered about looking for shapes at that age.\n\nOur taxonomy now (and he appreciates it being organised like this, but it's still me that has to do it!)\n\n- people and accessories\n\n- any piece of size 1x2 or less (plates or blocks)\n\n- decorative items (including smooth tiles)\n\n- wheels\n\n- pre-moulded shapes (e.g. fences, doors, walls, vehicle cabs)\n\n- glass\n\n- blocks\n\n- plates\n\n- special train parts (e.g. wheels, bogeys, magnetic couplings)\n\n- engineering parts (anything with movement, clips, right angles, rotation etc)\n\nAlso, i recommend organising in phases. I used to do it as I picked stuff up, but it took ages. Now it all goes in a massive mixed drawer, then later it is sorted if there is time and inclination. Otherwise he just picks through the big drawer to find things.\n\nEventually I expect he'll start to organise in a way that suits him.\n\nFinally - for storage, IKEA Trofast or other similar generic draw sets (we have some on wheels from Argos) are perfect.\n\nI shed a little tear for my boy yesterday…\n\nWe spent the weekend alone together. After a tiring first week of school, On Saturday I took him to our capital city, Edinburgh as a treat.\n\nWe spent 12.5 hours in, on or admiring transport. Riding on the city tram, trains (a particular type he had been longing for), buses, and watching aeroplanes. I planned our route and sequence of stops, and then he devised a better one.\n\nI tested him at the main station. It’s big, it's busy. 20 platforms handling 21 million passengers per year. I bought the ticket and worked out what time we would be catching a train. Armed with the information about the next stop and the time, I challenged him to go and read the departure boards, work out which train it was, get the platform number, then find the platform and take us there. He succeeded perfectly.\n\nThen we went to a Chinese restaurant he specially requested - where he ate fries 🍟 and onion rings! It was a buffet, so I had not much choice but to leave him alone at our table while I got my food.\n\nTowards the end of the meal the lady on the next table leaned over and told me what a delight to see a child so beautifully behaved. We're often told that.\n\nAnd here's what I've realised: the more I allow him to spread his wings and grow, the more beautiful he becomes. He is my sunflower, reaching for the sky. 🌻\n\nDespite an epic Saturday, on Sunday he wanted to see trains 🚂 again at the local station; we ended up staying several hours. He read all the information boards, decided which trains to see, found the platforms. We went over the bridge and under the underpass. We went up the stairs and down in the lift (elevator). He predicted the engine types, and as the trains came passing through the station he read the name plates to me and decided if he'd seen them before. \"Sir John Franklin\", \"City of Manchester\", \"Treaty of Union\" and so on and so on.\n\nHe told passers-by all about them, whether they wanted to know or not! He observed all the safety rules, even though his boundless enthusiasm was constantly threatening to break into uncontrollable excitement.\n\nAnd that's when it hit me. My little boy is only four; he is locked into his passion for trains, but he just keeps amazing me. A tear rolled down my cheek.\n\nI was confused, I didn't really know what emotion I was feeling.\n\nHe is my startling, fragile little whirlwind. 💜\n\nMy wife pinpointed it later for me: just an overwhelming sense of protection, not just for now, but probably for all that is to come.\n\nA study of word confusability and similarity for whole-word readers\n\nThis article doesn't claim to be a valid scientific study, none-the-less it was interesting to do, and, essentially, perform as a thought experiment.\n\nOne of the things I have noticed with my own son and lots of comments from other parents of early readers, gifted and potentially hyperlexic children, is that such children astonishingly read (recognise) long complex words (such as \"galaxy\" and \"knowledge\") with ease, yet sometimes (perhaps even often) get tripped up on short \"simple\" words, such as \"one\" and \"many\". The question is, what is the explanation for this, as it seems to defy logic?\n\nI happen to have a background in the field of speech recognition (in computers) and there are factors of that field which boil down to the problem of recognising and distinguishing words from each other. So, I was eventually moved to perform some kind of analysis investigating this. I don't know if this is original or even valid research, but it was fun to do.\n\nHow do early readers, read?\n\nThe first thing to be aware of is two broad types of reading (and reading-teaching) methods: phonics and \"whole word\" (or whole language). Phonics concerns the systematic pronunciation of the component sounds of a word to reach the whole. Whole-word does what is says on the tin: the reader either memorises or deduces the whole word in one step. (As adults we tend to read like this).\n\nMy anecdotal conversations suggest that early readers are one or the other: some early readers display/develop/self-teach a phonic approach, and the remainder, it's the whole world. (In the case of my own son, it's \"whole word\"). In my anecdotal evidence, the most startling early readers are \"whole word\" because even at age 3 or 4, obscure words of 8, 10, 12 or more letters can be decoded instantly.\n\nSince whole-word readers essentially memorise and recognise entire words, it begs the question: given that they handle complex words with ease, why do they sometimes get tripped up on short words?\n\nIt's possible to come up with lots of theories involving visual processing disorders, dyslexic conditions, motivation (laziness) and so on. However, I theorised about a more empirical factor: if children appear to recognise short words less-well, is it simply because short words are less memorable/more confusable?\n\n(Confusability, in various forms, is a factor we have to deal with on a regular basis in speech recognition, which prompted my thinking.)\n\nMr. Levenshtein, meet Dr. Fry.\n\nBefore we get to the analysis, I need to introduce two things. The first is the Fry Sight Word list. I don't seem to be able to find out much about Dr. Fry directly on the internet, but many educational websites cite the fact he created a list of the most popular and common English words in literature, originally in the 50's but since updated.\n\nIf these are the most common words that a child is going to see, then it seemed to make sense to evaluate what levels of \"confusability\" exists among them.\n\nTo perform the analysis, I took a set of \"sample words\" and calculated the Levenshtein distance against between each of those words and every word in the \"Fry Sight List\".\n\nI compared the sample words against the full Fry list (1000 words) and also against the top 150, and plotted the distribution of Levenshtein distances obtained.\n\nWhat this effectively tells us is \"how similar is the target word to the most common words in the language\". We might postulate that the more similar a word is to others, the more likely it could be confused - i.e. the less likely to stand out as unique. Or conversely, a greater cognitive load required to uniquely recognise it.\n\nI plotted the results for \"one\" \"many\" \"who\" (all identified as \"trip up\" words), plus \"galaxy\" and \"knowledge\" (indentfied as easily-recalled words).\n\nTo interpret the chart, the height of each bar tells you by what amount the target word differed from how much of the Fry's list. So, for example, a 50% at marker 3 means the word differed by 3 single-character transformations against 50% of the Fry list.\n\nCompared against 1000 top words, we see that \"one\" \"many\" and \"who\" are clustered around the 3,4 and 5 mark for Levenshtein distance. Indeed, this level of \"similarity\" captures up to 80% of the top 1000 words. In contrast, \"galaxy\" is typically different by around 6 - 7 letters, and \"knowledge\" even more different around 8 - 9 mark.\n\nIn this case the profile of the sample words is more pronounced - the short words compare against the top 150 mainly in the 2,3,4 range (anything in 1 and 2 is certainly highly confusable). And the long, complex words now stand out as being significantly different - and thus, we presume easier to recognise uniquely within the given vocabulary.\n\nSummary\n\nThere are of course weaknesses to this analysis:\n\n1) it doesn't consider word geometry or font, which may make some words look more similar than others irrespective of Levenshtein distance, which considers the text only\n\n2) The Fry Sight list is really only a arbitrary representation of the vocabulary an early reader might know. To some extent, by definition, this list is insufficient, because the words that early readers surprise their parents, carers and observers by knowing, are the long irregular words.\n\n3) It would be useful to perform the analysis against a bigger vocabulary but of words the same length as the sample word - this might better match the process a child follows when recognising the word (pruning out the obviously non-similar words)\n\nNotwithstanding, the comparison of sample words against the Fry Sight Word list shows statistically significant disparity in similarity between the shorter words than the longer words. At 1000 words long, the Fry Sight list offers statistical significance to the comparison.\n\nThe result is not really surprising. As we might expect, there are more short words in the vocabulary, therefore more possibility of similarity and confusion."
