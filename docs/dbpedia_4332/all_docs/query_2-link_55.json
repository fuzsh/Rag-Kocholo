        "text": "Glenmorgan watching Dubai with interest\n\nWhilst much of the interest for NZ breeders will be across the Tasman and at Tauranga Glenmorgan Farm will also be keeping a weather eye on Dubai as they stage the running of the seven race (Five Group One and Two Group Two) World Cup meeting for total prize-money of US$15 Million.\n\nInterest starts in the Group Two UAE Derby which includes the Godolphin trained and Frankie Dettori ridden filly Inamorato who is part of the first crop of sire success Tale Of The Cat. Tale Of The Cat stood only the single season in New Zealand but Glenmorgan stands his ½ brother in the Champion 2YO of Europe in 2000 in Minardi. Minardi is to return to Glenmorgan in 2003.\n\nThe days feature is the Gr1 Dubai World Cup over 2000m and included in the field is the much traveled Godolphin owned Grandera. Grandera is by the successful son of Chief’s Crown in Grand Lodge and Glenmorgan stand a son of Chief’s Crown in the six times Gr1 Breeders’ Cup Turf winner Chief Bearhart who has made an impressive start at stud in Japan. Chief Bearhart will return to Glenmorgan for his third season in 2003.\n\nThe Gr1 Dubai Duty Free over 1777m includes the Michale Stout trained Spinning World colt King of Happiness. Grand-dam of King Of Happiness is the amazing mare Rare Mint who has produced six Group or listed performers and is a ½ sister to the Dahar mare American Express who has visited Glenmorgan’s champion Generous for each of the last four season. The first of the coverings produced a filly, now two named Nautilus Bay and in the stable of Victorian trainer Peter Moody. The second, a colt was sold through Karaka, to Aquanita Racing for $72,500 whilst the mare is safely in foal again to Generous and produced another colt this season.\n\nAustralian mare Belle Du Jour lines up in the Gr1 Dubai Golden Shaheen over 1200m for US$2 Million and will be ridden by Danny Beasley. Glenmorgan own a Sir Tristram ½ sister to Belle Du Jour in Tintinnabulation and have entered the very first colt by their Breeders’ Cup Turf winner Chief Bearhart out of Tintinnabulation in this years Sydney weanling sale. The colt is sure to attract plenty of attention and anything Belle du Jour may do to raise the family's profile will be a bonus.\n\nThe Gr2 Godolphin mile for US$1Million includes the Godolphin owned Essence of Dubai who is by the very successful young sire in Pulpit. Pulpit is out of the Gr1 winner Preach who is a full sister to Yarn the amazing broodmare who has produced three Group winners including Tale of The Cat, Spunoutacontrol, Glenmorgan’s Champion in Minardi and Myth, dam of no less than the Champion 2YO of the world in 2001 in Johannesburg. With four grandsons now successfully at stud grand-dam Narrate is undoubtedly creating something of a dynasty and Glenmorgan are eagerly awaiting the first crop of Minardi’s foals this coming Spring."
