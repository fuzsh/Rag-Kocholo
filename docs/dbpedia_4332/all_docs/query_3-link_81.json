in Belgium. He was trained as a linguist at the Catholic University of Milan, Italy, where he graduated in foreign languages and literature (French), with a dissertation on the linguistics of humor, in 1986. In 1988, he moved to the United States to attend Purdue University. In 1991, together with Victor Raskin, Attardo published a long article that developed Raskin’s own semantic theory of humor into the general theory of verbal humor (GTVH). Later that year he received a PhD in English from Purdue University, with a specialization in linguistics and a dissertation on the linguistics of humor, which was published in 1994 as his first book, Linguistic Theories of Humor. Attardo was professor of linguistics at Youngstown State University from 1992 to 2007. He coauthored, with Steven Brown, a sociolinguistics textbook, Understanding Language Structure, Interaction, and Variation (2000) and authored Humorous Texts (2001). He served as editor-inchief of HUMOR: International Journal of Humor\n\nResearch from 2001 to 2011. With Diana Elena Popa, he coedited the book New Approaches to the Linguistics of Humor (2007), and with Manuela Maria Wagner and Eduardo Urios-Aparisi, he coedited Prosody and Humor (2013). In 2007, he became chair of the Department of Literature and Languages at Texas A&M University–Commerce. In 2010, he became dean of the College of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts at Texas A&M University–Commerce, where he is also professor of linguistics. Attardo’s research is focused primarily on humor studies and pragmatics. He has published more than 100 articles and book reviews in scholarly journals. He serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Pragmatics and other journals. In the past decade, his interests have broadened to include the prosody and gestures accompanying humor, mainly working in collaboration with his wife, Lucy Pickering. In non-humor-related topics, Attardo has published in the fields of semantics, pragmatics, Italian studies, grammar, the pedagogy of linguistics, stylistics, cognitive linguistics, and computational linguistics.\n\nxix\n\nContributors Goh Abe Kagawa University\n\nDoris Bergen Miami University (Ohio)\n\nAudrey C.

For this unique and unprecedented reference work, humor scholars from around the world have contributed more than 300 entries, with a wide range both historically (from the Egyptians and the Sumerians to modern times) and geographically (with entries on Chinese, Japanese, African, Amerindian, Arabic, and Sanskrit humor). Moreover, the encyclopedia does not limit itself to traditional academic subjects. Readers will find entries on comics, cartoons, burlesque, graffiti, improv comedy, clowns, music halls, and much more. These entries, totaling more than half a million words, represent the thinking of 200 contributors, and the results of all this creative endeavor have been ably assembled under the leadership of the editor and the editorial board members, who have guided this mega-vessel from conception through to publication. Humor—the subject that commands such an effort as the undertaking of the Encyclopedia of Humor Studies—is not a frivolous, trivial sector of the human experience. It summons our attention. It absorbs large proportions of our lifetime energies. The various aspects of humor, including our own senses of humor, are important parts of the lives of all human beings. The entire universe—everything we think we know, everywhere within the human experience—has some relevant connection to humor. Attention to humor is evident in all languages and cultures, even the most remote. Some languages are familiar; others may be obscure, but the conceptual and verbal webs underlying humor are consistent, no matter the native tongue. Whether one uses the term Witz, schwank, joke, or blason populaire—and\n\nthere are differences among these terms—ultimately, the connections to the roots of humor are the same. Indeed, the ability to create and recognize humor has a biological basis, and its many positive effects on physical and mental well-being suggest that from an evolutionary standpoint, laughter can be understood as an adaptive behavior. Humor customarily supplies benefits beyond what is usually anticipated from communication. When significant rapport is discovered through humor, the pleasures of conviviality—shared laughter, unified insights, joint sympathies—are the result. Humor does not customarily shrink from challenge (thus political cartoons take on all manner of controversial topics), and it is not limited to simple “yes” or “no” responses. In addition, it reveals and encompasses a multiplicity of viewpoints. Traditionally, amusement is evoked in tense circumstances (e.g., where resolution or compromise may seem to be unattainable) to alleviate the tension. Humor even has the potential for disarming militant hostilities and modifying feelings of resentment or anger that may linger as disruptive reminders of controversy. Humor, thus, is an apt subject for extended, searching discussion and study—in concordance, in tense dispute or debate, or in scholarly examination. As one can see, humor has much to recommend it as a worthy companion, for our studies, for our entertainment, for our explorations, and for our discoveries. Humor is richly endowed with the capacity for learning, for disputation, and for resolution. It is a unique factor of human nature with so much to contribute in the positive zones of human life—for oneself and for interpersonal experience.\n\nxxvii\n\nWilliam F. Fry Stanford University\n\nIntroduction As any encyclopedist most assuredly does, I used to lie awake at night fearing having unwittingly become the epigone of the Chinese encyclopedia conjured by Jorge Luis Borges in “El idioma analítico de John Wilkins” (The Analytical Language of John Wilkins; in Otras inquisiciones [Other Inquisitions]), which classifies animals as follows: (a) those that belong to the Emperor, (b) embalmed ones, (c) those that are trained, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f) fabulous ones, (g) stray dogs, (h) those that are included in this classification, (i) those that tremble as if they were mad, (j) innumerable ones, (k) those drawn with a very fine camel brush, (l) others, (m) those that have just broken a flower vase, (n) those that resemble flies from a distance.\n\nBorges’s humor is as usual multifaceted, but let us linger on the sublime touches of a list that continues after “others;” on the weary but wise worldliness of a list that begins with “those that belong to the Emperor;” on the metalinguistic paradox of “those included in this classification” (and if you don’t see it, read the entry on Paradox); and the surreal poetry of “those that resemble flies from a distance” (Don’t we all? Or is it ants?). For all its amusing qualities, captured in Michel Foucault’s preface to Les mots et les choses (Words and Things), Borges’s list makes a serious point: There is no end to the ways in which we can classify what exists in the world or what the world is, for that matter. As I implied, the experience of editing an encyclopedia quickly led me to accept that many taxonomies and classifications, all incompatible and orthogonal to each other, necessarily proliferate in\n\nany encyclopedia that takes seriously its mission, or at least aspirations, to achieve universality. One could come up with exceptionless universal schemes of classification, but they would naturally not reflect usage. So, caught between the rock of common usage and the hard place of systematicity, an encyclopedia must abandon the dream of becoming an exhaustive systematic classification of the matter and resign itself to being a jumble of partial classifications that reflect the interests and disciplinary priorities of the scholars and students who will use it. To be sure, by using blind entries and crossreferences, we have designed a web of interconnections that will facilitate finding one’s interests, regardless of the classification adopted. While striving to be comprehensive, an encyclopedia can never be exhaustive. Not every conceivable topic related to humor could be included. The most painful exclusion was the decision, made early on, to leave out literary humorists, unless their influence had been so great that one could speak of Aristophanic, Plautine, or Shakespearean comedy, for example. Conversely, readers should be aware that some humor is obscene, aggressive, and sexual in nature. Humor researchers know and expect this, but some readers may be offended or shocked by some of the materials examined or even by the language used to describe it. The encyclopedia is unabashedly an American (in the narrow sense of United States) work; see, for example, the entry Presidential Humor, which deals with humor about and in the presidency of the United States. However, it also makes a deliberate effort to expand its coverage to Western civilization and beyond to include Asia and Africa. The reader will find for the first time, a multidisciplinary reference work that covers not only European genres of humor, but also Chinese, Japanese, and a few African genres. For Japanese names and titles, a modified version of the Hepburn system of romanization is used, whereby macrons mark long vowels (e.g.\n\nxxix\n\nxxx\n\nIntroduction\n\n“ō” for “oo”). Chinese names and titles are rendered in pinyin. Much work went into broadening the coverage of the encyclopedia beyond the traditional Western culture. It is largely due to the hard work of the editorial board that the encyclopedia could range so widely. In fact, in some cases we had to literally codify a field for the first time. This is a difficult and delicate matter. Witness, for example, the following e-mail that Dr. Lawrence Gross, a professor at the University of Redlands, in California, sent me during the process of preparing and editing his entry on American Indian humor: You asked for a very difficult assignment in that there are many American Indian nations—523 in the United States alone—covering thousands of years. Also, there are many American Indian comedians and writers active today. In order to demonstrate the ongoing vitality of American Indian cultures, I needed to cover as many of those individuals as possible. Also, I sent out a request to a Native professors listserv asking for their input. The overwhelming consensus was that I should include as many modern-day American Indian comedians and writers as possible. So, I feel I have the support of the community of Native American professors behind me.\n\nThe e-mail is emblematic of the problems that all the authors encountered when having to synthesize an entire field, with literally hundreds of authors, ideas, theories, and points of view, in a few thousand words. However, the e-mail also shows the meticulous process whereby the authors built a consensus of what other scholars and practitioners in the field recognize as their field. In this case, there was no standard comprehensive treatment of the subject. In some cases, there just was no way to provide an overall encompassing view. Simply put, the field is just not there (yet). A good example is African humor. In this case, we had to resort to commissioning partial articles from experts in some areas and using blind entries to stitch together a somewhat coherent and comprehensive view. These areas are obviously in need of further research, and I hope that the encyclopedia will generate enough interest that a new generation of scholars will take up this work, if for no other reason than to prove me wrong. It should also be made abundantly clear that the length limits imposed by the print medium are a positive feature and not a limitation. When\n\nWikipedia dedicates more than 30 entries to Buffy the Vampire Slayer with the main entry on the TV series an astonishing 12,000 words, synthesis becomes a virtue. For someone interested in finding out what is important about, say, humor in Judaism, a 12,000-word entry is merely confusing. A 3,000-word entry will, out of necessity, focus on what is crucial. Or, consider the show The Big Bang Theory, which gets a whopping 14,000 words in the main Wikipedia entry, and is mentioned, as an example, in the Cross-Cultural Humor entry, where it gets a 60-word treatment. But what, you may ask, if I am a fan of The Big Bang Theory and I want to know in what episode Sheldon’s work is refuted by Stephen Hawking? Then you are reading the wrong book. (Episode 21, Season 5, if you must know.) To be sure, concision is difficult; witness the many requests I received, and mostly resisted, for increased word counts, from semidesperate authors.\n\nThe Field of Humor Studies Most people, when first encountering humor studies, react with incredulity. Humor appears to be so simple, so easy. Surely it can be defined and explained in a few well-chosen sentences. This attitude is common in the media: Generally speaking, journalists first encounter humor studies when they cover a humor studies conference or in the rarer occasions in which humor-related news hits the media news cycle. Inevitably the old saying by Elwyn B. White, among whose works include Charlotte’s Web and, with William Strunk Jr., The Elements of Style, about dissecting humor and a frog, and the frog dying under dissection much like the humor, gets trotted out to ridicule the endeavor. The problem with that view, however, is that if one asks those skeptical about humor studies to provide their definition and explanation of humor, the results are hopelessly naive, open to refutation from several sides, and, at best, partial and incomplete. Truth is, things that appear to be simple, are often vexingly complex: What could be easier than walking upright? Plenty of things, as robotics professors will be happy to explain to you. To this day, we do not have a robot capable of walking unassisted with anywhere near the skill of a 10-year-old kid. In fact, there are so many terms, synonyms, partial synonyms, and overlapping definitions of humor and humor-related subjects (e.g., comic, ridicule, irony, mirth, laughable, jolly, funny, ludicrous,\n\nIntroduction\n\nmerry, etc.) that a common understanding has been reached in the field of using the word humor as an umbrella term to cover all the synonyms. The word itself comes from the medieval theory of humors, which explained disease as a mixture of four principles (see the Humor, Etymology of, entry for more details), but that is irrelevant in the technical sense just discussed. I should add that even this definition is far from being accepted by all. For example, literary theorists insist that humor and the comic be kept distinct, the latter being properly applied to theatrical comedy. I should also add that some of my best friends are literary theorists. Needless to say, different disciplines address different aspects of humor. As would be expected, cognitive psychology deals with the cognitive mechanisms that trigger humor, social psychology with the social effects and mechanisms of humor, linguistics with the semantic and pragmatic aspects of language that produce humor, sociology with the social aspects, folklore with the ways that people of different groups produce humor or different kinds of humor, and so on. Literary theorists deal with humor in literature, musicologists with humor in music, film critics with humor in film, art critics with humor in art, design, and so forth. However, the defining feature of humor studies is the interdisciplinarity of the field. What that means is that it is not uncommon to see psychologists borrowing ideas from linguists, sociologists debating philosophers, literary theorists using psychological theories, computer scientists working on folk genres such as riddles, and medical doctors being inspired by folklore (clowning being a prime example). It may be objected that interdisciplinarity is also to be found in other areas, computer science being an excellent example. This is true but misleading. Whereas computer science is applied to many areas (e.g., social media), there is virtually no feedback (there are no computer languages based on Twitter). This is not the case in humor studies: Linguists borrow back ideas from psychologists, philosophers discuss sociologists’ ideas, folklorists analyze computer humor, and so on. It is tempting to date the start of the field of humor studies from Plato and Aristotle, who provided the first systematic thinking about comedy; or with the Renaissance treatises (the 16th-century Italian and French literary theorists who defined neoclassical comedy, but also Laurent Joubert’s Traité du ris [Treatise on Laughter] 1579); or with the humorstudies trifecta of Henri Bergson (1900), Sigmund\n\nxxxi\n\nFreud (1905), and Luigi Pirandello (1908); or with William Fry’s epochal Sweet Madness (1963); or perhaps with the blossoming of the psychology of humor in the 1970s. However illustrious the precedents one might invoke, the idea of a field of humor research coalesces around the humor conferences started in Cardiff, Wales, in 1976, by Anthony Chapman and Hugh Foot. The most salient aspect of the conference was its interdisciplinary nature, which would define humor research. Psychology, to be sure the leading discipline, appears alongside with literary theory, anthropology, folklore, and other related disciplines. The first conference was followed by others, in 1979 (Los Angeles), 1982 (Washington, DC), 1984 (Tel Aviv), and 1985 (Cork, Ireland). Also, in 1982 Don and Alleen Nilsen started the World Humor and Irony Membership (WHIM), which held annual meetings at the University of Arizona, the Nilsens’ home base, until 1987. WHIM published extended abstracts, called the WHIM Serial Yearbook (WHIMSY). Besides the cute name, the WHIMSY books provided the first periodical humor research publication. In 1987, the International Society of Humor Studies (ISHS) was created. In 1988, WHIM was held at Purdue University, and at the same time HUMOR: International Journal of Humor Research started its publication, with Victor Raskin as its editor-in-chief. The last WHIMSY appeared in 1989. The ISHS has held annual conferences since 1988, during odd years in the United States and in the rest of the world in even years. A French publication, Humoresques, also was started in 1988 and is still active. Other humor journals have appeared recently, mostly as online publications. The 1980s saw the publication of the first disciplinary syntheses: John Morreall’s 1983 Taking Laughter Seriously; Avner Ziv’s 1984 Personality and Sense of Humor; Mahadev Apte’s 1985 Humor and Laughter and, in the same year, Victor Raskin’s Semantic Mechanisms of Humor; and bringing the decade to an end, Christie Davies’s 1990 Ethnic Humor Around the World. These were later followed by Salvatore Attardo’s 1994 Linguistic Theories of Humor; Rod Martin’s 2007 The Psychology of Humor; and, finally, the Primer of Humor Research, edited by Victor Raskin in 2008, with a much broader disciplinary range. The 1990s also saw the first book series dedicated to humor: Mouton de Gruyter, Transaction Publishers, Wayne State University Press, and Gordon and Breach all publish\n\nxxxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nhumor book series that started in that decade. Other series have appeared since then. From a disciplinary perspective, the dominance of psychology as the leading discipline is unassailable. Psychologists dominate the debate by defining the main theories (incongruity theory and relief, or liberation, theory) and by setting standards of empirical verification. The only major theory not completely psychological at the root is the superiority/hostility theory, which is more grounded in social status/interactions and hence more sociological than psychological. The research from sociology, folklore, anthropology, philosophy, linguistics, and communication taken together do not even come close to matching the output of psychological research. Literary studies is a special case to itself, as it freely borrows ideas and terminology from other disciplines but remains largely unaffected in its methodologies and outlooks on the field (historical, postmodern, Marxist, to name just a few). Other disciplines, such as mathematics and computer science, occasionally contribute but are definitely marginal to the field.\n\nRationale for the Encyclopedia The field of humor studies has grown and matured into a respected interdisciplinary area. Examples of the field’s respectability can be easily gleaned. To name just one, the HUMOR journal has had an impact factor (a measure of the average number of citations to articles in the journal) since the mid2000s. In the 1980s, one could, with some degree of reasonableness, aspire to read all that was being published in humor studies. Nowadays, this is no longer feasible at the level of a single discipline, such as psychology, within humor studies, let alone the entire field. Dissertations on humor studies are written and defended all the time. Yet, despite all this growth, there was no single resource available that would provide a comprehensive, broad-based introduction to the entire field of humor studies. Moreover, because of the increased specialization within the disciplines that contribute to humor studies, scholars and students from different areas increasingly find themselves unfamiliar with the methods and findings of other, perhaps adjacent areas. The Encyclopedia of Humor Studies fills these two gaps, affording a relatively easy path of approach to students and scholars who want to be informed about the research and findings in a given area. Given its subject matter, the encyclopedia may also fulfill another goal, by providing the general public with reliable\n\ninformation about humor-related subjects, which are the subject of much curiosity but unfortunately generally appallingly poor-quality online and media coverage, as mentioned before. Incidentally, I should mention that some of my best friends are in the media. I should also mention that there are some positive exceptions, such as Jim Holt, who has done some coverage of humor studies for The New Yorker, and Joel Warner, who has covered several humor conferences for Wired and other publications.\n\nContent and Organization The selection of the topics in the more than 300 entries reflects a deliberate attempt to cover current areas of research in humor studies. However, an attempt at systematic coverage was also made, with mixed results. In some cases, there are no works of synthesis because not enough specific cases have been studied. Nonetheless, we expanded the coverage of the encyclopedia to numerous areas that do not normally see themselves as part of humor studies. Examples are the entries on ancient humor (e.g., Ancient Egypt, Humor in; Assyrian and Babylonian Humor; Sanskrit Humor) and the entries on music and humor and the visual arts and humor. The encyclopedia is designed to be accessible to college students. As such, the entries are designed to be comprehensive but not exhaustive treatments of a topic. However, some of the more technical entries may require familiarizing oneself with some of the entries that provide broader introductions to the fields that contribute to humor studies. The reader will easily spot those, because they contain the name of the discipline as the title, such as Sociology, Literature, Pedagogy, Poetry, Psychology, Anthropology, Linguistics, Religion, Music, and so on. In some rare cases, it became clear that the encyclopedia entry would be the first systematic treatment of a given subject. Those entries have a broader set of bibliographic references. The encyclopedia also provides the readers with cross-references (“See alsos”) at the end of each entry that guide them to related entries. In addition, the front matter of the encyclopedia contains a Reader’s Guide that lists all entries related to a given topic or that belong to a subdiscipline. For example, the subcategory of Asia in the Reader’s Guide includes all the entries dealing with Asia, regardless of period, genre, or language. The Reader’s Guide can be found at the front of both volumes of the encyclopedia.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe chronology is another example of groundbreaking work included in the encyclopedia. This is the first ever synoptic chronology of humor spanning over 4 millennia (from 2000 BCE to present day) and identifying significant events in the history of humor from Europe, Asia, America, and Africa. This allows one to see, for example, that Laurence Sterne, the author of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, and Carlo Goldoni, the great Italian dramatist, were active roughly at the same time (and couldn’t be any more different, which is why this is interesting) but also that some of the earliest Chinese humor was written at the same time of some of the earliest Babylonian humor, or that the Forest of Laughter, the first Chinese collection of jokes, was written roughly at the same time that Menippus wrote his satires and the Romans enjoyed the Atellan farces. Needless to say, the chronology is not intended to be exhaustive either.\n\nHow the Encyclopedia Was Created The editorial board was chosen with the goal of including both some of the major figures in the field and some of the younger “up and coming” scholars, as well as representing as many as possible of the disciplines in the field. The editor then developed a list of potential entry topics. The major works of synthesis in the field were consulted, and lists of topics were extracted. The complete 25 years of the journal HUMOR were likewise mined for potential topics. The first list of topics thus prepared was then circulated to the editorial board for comments, additions, and general advice. Moreover, major scholars in the field were also consulted. The list underwent several revisions, and advice from the SAGE editorial team was also incorporated. On occasion, individual suggestions from potential contributors were also included if they met the approval of the board. This deliberate attempt at comprehensiveness went far beyond the disciplines and topics that typically appear in mainstream humor studies publications. This made it sometimes difficult as nonacademics were at times bewildered by academic practices (“Bibliography? You want a bibliography?”). The authors were given general guidelines of accessibility and readability as well as a few sample entries. All of the entries were reviewed at least by the section editor and by the lead editor, but often other readers were brought in, especially if the lead\n\nxxxiii\n\neditor had commissioned the entry directly. Each entry was then edited for style and language. Significant revisions were approved by the authors, and the entries were then finalized. Some of the significant iconographic materials were provided by the authors of the entries and are acknowledged in the entries themselves, but the majority was the fruit of archival research by SAGE developmental editor Diana Axelsen and the project’s second managing editor, Hilal Ergül.\n\nAcknowledgments I would like to thank all of the more than 200 authors who contributed one or more entries to the encyclopedia. Without them, there would be no encyclopedia, and without their knowledge and expertise, the quality of the entries would not be as high as it is. I would also like to thank all the scholars who selflessly took time to advise the editorial board and me on what topics to include, comment on the entries, and make suggestions to improve them. In particular, Rod Martin and Christie Davies provided extensive suggestions and help in the preparatory stages of the work. William (Bill) Fry graciously accepted to honor the project with his Foreword. I would also like to remember Avner Ziv, who passed away soon after having agreed to serve on the editorial board and after having given me the privilege of his advice on his field. I treasured his friendship, and I will never forget his exquisite hospitality. I was saddened of learning of the death of Lorene Birden, a long-time friend and collaborator, right before going to press. Lorene and I co-organized the ISHS conference in Youngstown, Ohio. I also cherish the time we worked together. Then, a few days later, I was again saddened by the passing away of Paul Seaver, founding president of the International Society for Luso-Hispanic Humor Studies, the author of the Cervantes entry in the encyclopedia, and a supporter of the project who had lent his knowledge and wisdom to it on many occasions. I would also like to thank the editorial board, most of them close friends, Thomas E. Ford, Sharon Lockyer, Owen Hanley Lynch, Moira Marsh, Jessica Milner Davis, John Morreall, and last but not least, Victor Raskin, for taking on with good humor and formidable patience the usually thankless task of reviewing, editing, and often cutting down to size of the entries. I also would like to thank Audrey C. Adams, who was the project’s managing\n\nxxxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\neditor for the first 2 years, and Hilal Ergül, who took her place for the last 7 months of the task. It was a pleasure to work with the SAGE editorial team: Jim Brace-Thompson, Diana Axelsen, Shirin Parsavand, and Anna Villaseñor. I also would like to thank Gaia Attardo, Aaron Westmoreland, and Hilal Ergül, who helped prepare the chronology, and Audrey C. Adams, who prepared the list of associations and journals. I also would like to\n\nthank Texas A&M University–Commerce for supporting me in this project by providing funding for research assistants. Most of all I would like to thank my wife, Lucy Pickering, who put a smile on my face throughout the 3 years it took to complete the project and never lost her patience when she heard me say over and over: “Next time I will not make this mistake again!” Salvatore Attardo\n\nA the theater of the absurd; and with modernist avantgardes, absurdist humor has in fact a long history running across a variety of genres.\n\nABSURDIST HUMOR Closely related to black humor, nonsense, and incongruity, absurdist humor can be understood in broad terms as humor concerned with the absence or refusal of meaning. Etymologically, the term absurd is linked to the musical discord generated absurdo (by a deaf person). In humor, as in nonsense and incongruity, it can be seen as opposed to conventional or serious discourse. While this negative status suggests that the absurd can manifest itself in many ways, it is useful to distinguish between two main strands. First, the rational absurd is concerned with the breakdown of logic and exemplified in the technique of reductio ad absurdum, in which a logical proposition is led to a nonsensical or contradictory conclusion. Second, the existential absurd is concerned with the apparent meaninglessness of human existence, often associated with French existentialist philosophy and the postwar theater of the absurd. Not all humor is absurd, and not all absurdity is funny; however, both strands function as rich sources of humor, with the rational absurd tending toward formal playfulness and nonsense, and the existential absurd toward darker humor. These two strands often occur in combination, and examples ranging from the zany comedy of a Marx Brothers or Monty Python sketch to the hollow laughter elicited by the plays of Eugène Ionesco or Samuel Beckett show that absurdist humor can take many forms. While it is most often thought of as a 20th-century phenomenon, associated particularly with vaudeville, film, and television comedy; with\n\nAbsurdity, Incongruity, and Nonsense The specific characteristics of absurdist humor are best understood with respect to neighboring concepts such as incongruity and nonsense, although there is a risk of overstating what are sometimes nebulous distinctions. The absurd appears as a key ingredient of humor in Immanuel Kant’s 1790 Critique of Judgment, a text that has strongly influenced the modern understanding of humor as being less a mode of aggressive ridicule than a species of incongruity: “In everything that is to excite a lively convulsive laugh there must be something absurd (in which the understanding, therefore, can find no satisfaction). Laughter is an affectation arising from the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing” (Kant, 1790/2007, p. 161). But while the incongruity implied in Kant’s “something absurd” is capable of being resolved or negated, Elliott Oring (2003, Ch. 2) makes a useful distinction between the “appropriate” incongruity characteristic of most humor, and the extra level of incongruity characteristic of absurdist humor, which typically cannot be resolved into any situation compatible with normal experience. As a case in point, Oring cites the example of elephant jokes (e.g., “Why do elephants paint their toenails red? To hide in cherry trees”), which violate the usual conventions of (non-absurdist) riddles since the answer offers a situation that is no less absurd than the initial question. 1\n\n2\n\nAbsurdist Humor\n\nThe example of elephant jokes is also helpful in distinguishing between absurdist humor and nonsense humor, since incongruity resides here not in the structure or linguistic expression of the joke but in its content. While absurdist humor implies a breakdown in meaning on a referential (logical or existential) level, the incongruity of nonsense humor resides within language itself. Noting a tendency to conflate the two categories, Wim Tigges argues that “in nonsense, language creates a reality, in the absurd language represents a senseless reality” (1988, p. 128). Thus the made-up language of a text like Lewis Carroll’s famous poem, “Jabberwocky,” constitutes (a highly suggestive form of) nonsense; but in chapter 5 of the novel from which it is taken (Through the Looking-Glass, 1871), the decision of the Queen of Hearts to punish the king’s messenger before trial, and even before he has committed a crime, exemplifies absurdist reasoning. While Carroll’s world is essentially humorous and lighthearted (it can also be read as an exploration of his interest in formal logic), the messenger’s punishment anticipates the more troubling absurdism of later writers such as Franz Kafka (1883–1924): It demonstrates how a breakdown in logic can lead to senseless and potentially threatening existential situations. Normal usage of the terms humor and absurd involves a considerable degree of conceptual overlap, but they can also be understood as subtly contrasting perceptual modes. Taking humor in its narrower sense (prevalent in languages like French and German, and formerly so in English) of a predilection for whimsical, self-conscious eccentricity, Jean-Jacques Mayoux (1973) argues that a humorous outlook implies the assumption that “I am ridiculous,” whereas an absurdist outlook implies the assumption that “the world is ridiculous.” Mayoux explores the distinction between (English) humor and (French) absurdism primarily as a function of cultural attitudes—reflected in the strong absurdist strain in 20th-century French philosophy and literature—but his argument is also helpful in framing absurdist humor as a response not to the self but to the external world.\n\nAbsurdist Humor Before 1900 Absurd humor in various forms can be found throughout the history of comedy, often serving as a frame or counterpoint to more serious or satirical elements. Early examples include the plays of Aristophanes, whose Frogs (404 BCE), for example,\n\npresents the effeminate god Dionysus incongruously dressed in the lion-skin of Heracles/Hercules in order to emulate the latter’s voyage to the underworld. There Dionysus presides over an absurd poetic contest in which the dead poets Aeschylus and Euripides have their lines evaluated by being weighed on a giant set of scales. Jokes built specifically around absurdist reasoning recur down the centuries. Dionysus’s advice to his slave at the beginning of the Frogs—to stop complaining about carrying heavy baggage while riding a mule, and instead, load the bags onto the mule and carry that on his shoulders instead—is echoed, for example, in Petruchio’s tricking Katharina into stating that “the moon . . . is the blessed sun” in Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew (ca. 1592, Act IV, Scene 5); and also in the Queen of Hearts’s refusal to allow Alice to eat a leg of mutton before (or after) being introduced to it (Through the Looking-Glass, chap. 9). A tradition of wordplay verging on nonsense humor can be traced from French medieval Fatrasies (poems in which sound associations generate absurd images or contradictory statements) through the coq-à-l’âne (the cock follows the ass) humor of François Rabelais and French poet Clément Marot (1496–1544) in which unrelated topics are made to follow each other with no apparent logic, to the works of Carroll and of Edward Lear (1812–1888). Absurd plots and situations are a staple of comic genres ranging from farce to the shaggy-dog narratives of Menippean satire, named for the 3rdcentury BCE Cynic Menippus. This comic genre is exemplified in Laurence Sterne’s Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759–1768), in which the narrator’s attempt at an unabridged autobiography becomes mired in digression as his lived experience elapses much faster than he can narrate. While Sterne’s highly erudite novel derives much of its humor from rational absurdism, it also displays a darker vein of existential humor, seen in a late passage (Book 7, chap. 1) in which the narrator is visited by the figure of Death while telling a digressive story, prompting him to abandon his autobiography and sidestep a growing sense of mortality by traveling to France. Absurdist humor sometimes serves a deeply satirical purpose. Desiderius Erasmus’s Praise of Folly (1509) and Panurge’s encomium of debt in Rabelais’s Tiers livre (Third Book, 1546, chap. 3–4) parody the absurdities of medieval scholastic reasoning; and Jonathan Swift’s pseudopolitical\n\nAbsurdist Humor\n\npamphlet A Modest Proposal (1729) deploys an outwardly rational argument to reach the darkly absurd conclusion that poverty and overpopulation in contemporary Ireland could be solved by farming babies for meat. Although absurdist humor is often associated with the late 19th-century-nonsense tradition of Carroll and Lear, it can also be an aggressive weapon against the pretensions of rationalist discourse or existential certainty.\n\nModernism, Dadaism, and Surrealism The turn of the 20th century was a significant turning point for the absurd both in terms of its expanding influence and in a shift in emphasis from a primarily comic mode to a tool for questioning conventional modes of understanding. Alfred Jarry’s 1896 play Ubu roi (Ubu the king) influenced both the postwar theater of the absurd and a range of modernist avant-gardes. It gleefully attacked the established assumptions of representational drama, presenting grotesque and foul-mouthed characters, disjointed plots (including travesties of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, among other sources) and senseless violence, all conspiring to undermine meaningful interpretation. Although Jarry died in 1907, his iconoclastic brand of absurdist humor is linked to art movements such as Dadaism and surrealism, reflected by iconic examples such as Marcel Duchamp’s readymade urinal Fountain (1917) and René Magritte’s 1928–1929 painting famously captioned “Ceci n’est pas une pipe.”\n\n3\n\nChauve, 1950) opens with a superficially ordinary but essentially meaningless conversation in the living room of a stereotypically “English” couple. The dialogue is inspired by the banal repetitions of a language-learning record, but this initially mundane absurdity is disturbed by a series of increasingly bizarre events (the arrival of a fire chief, a recognition scene between two people presented as husband and wife) that culminates in the characters repeating a series of meaningless syllables while failing to notice any incongruity. In a slightly different vein, Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot (1953) presents a pair of tramps, who may or may not remember each other and are unsure of why or how long they have been waiting, in two almost identical acts where the dialogue alternates between existential musing and self-conscious set-piece comic routines in the style of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. This characteristic “radical devaluation of language” (Esslin, 1974, p. 26) has particular resonance for Beckett, whose characters often appear unconvinced that their dialogue is meaningful. Such referential confusion frequently leads back to a comic and self-conscious expression of existential absurdism. To quote Beckett’s Endgame (1957)—a play that wryly anticipates debates over deconstruction and postmodernism, and whose postapocalyptic setting recalls a common feature of later absurdist texts—“We’re not beginning to . . . to . . . mean something?” (p. 26).\n\nExistentialism and the Theater of the Absurd\n\nCoda: Humor Beyond the Theater of the Absurd\n\nHumor is rarely associated with the philosophy of existentialism most famously represented by Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) and Albert Camus (1913–1960)—although Camus’s representation of existentialist absurdism in The Myth of Sisyphus (1942) can be construed as a form of defensive humor in the face of meaninglessness, with a titular figure who ultimately attains happiness by realizing and accepting the absurdity of his never-ending task. By contrast, humor is central to the theater of the absurd, a term coined by critic Martin Esslin to describe the work of postwar dramatists, including Beckett, Ionesco, Arthur Adamov, and Jean Genet, all of whom used absurdist humor in combination with other destabilizing techniques to explore the demise of existential certainties. Described by its author as an “anti-play,” Ionesco’s The Bald Prima Donna (La Cantatrice\n\nCharacterized by Neil Cornwell (2006) as lying “beyond the absurd,” much canonical literature of the later 20th century followed the pattern of somber humor established by Beckett and his contemporaries and reflecting the zeitgeist of their times. Inspired partly by Jaroslav Hašek’s The Good Soldier Švejk (1923), a rambling and unfinished comic narrative dramatizing the absurdity of the First World War, the title of Joseph Heller’s 1961 novel Catch22 has become a byword for a situation to which there is no satisfactory solution. Flann O’Brien’s The Dalkey Archive (1964) shows a delight in erudite incongruities reminiscent of Rabelais and Sterne, but its presentation of a mad scientist bent on world destruction equates to a darker joke on the realworld threat of nuclear war. Thomas Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 (1966) and Gravity’s Rainbow (1973) feature characters struggling to make sense\n\n4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nof worlds characterized by both logical and existential uncertainty; while Stanley Kubrick’s black comedy film Dr. Strangelove (1964) offers a statement whose irrational logic is only overshadowed by that of the existential threat it dramatizes: “Gentlemen, you can’t fight in here. This is the war room!” Notwithstanding these examples, the appeal of more lighthearted forms of absurdist humor is ongoing, evinced by many examples of contemporary stand-up, film, and television comedy, as well as by forms such as video games and Internet memes, where the logic of virtual worlds contrasts incongruously with that of external reality. Whether rational or existential in nature, absurdist humor can in fact help bring out the brighter side of the lack of meaning that it typically highlights—as affirmed by a chorus of the newly crucified in the closing scene of Monty Python’s film The Life of Brian (1979):\n\nKant, I.

Forget about your sin—give the audience a grin Enjoy it—it’s your last chance anyhow.\n\nBecause most consumers are exposed to a large number of advertisements on a daily basis, humorous advertisements may be the most frequent way that many come into contact with intentional humor. Traditional advertisements are typically defined as persuasive, nonpersonal communications delivered to consumers via the mass media on behalf of identifiable sponsors. Advertisers use humor as a message tactic, with the intent of enhancing an advertisement’s potential for achieving various strategic objectives. Humor was used rather infrequently during the early years of modern advertising; researchers, however, have confirmed that its use in contemporary advertising is prevalent, especially in the broadcast media. Although this is generally true for most industrialized, First World countries, humor is found somewhat more frequently in the advertising of Western countries and cultures than in Eastern ones. This entry first reviews the history of humor in advertising and explains how and why many advertisers became increasingly confident during the 20th century that it would enhance the effectiveness of their messages. Next, the entry describes the most important theoretical explanations for how humor is believed to help advertisers achieve important advertising objectives, which include the consumer’s comprehension and recall of the message, as well as persuasion that leads the consumer to form an intention to buy the product or service. The entry discusses the cognitive response theory of advertising as a framework for understanding the contribution of humor to comprehension and recall.

Lastly, the entry describes several typologies of humorous advertisements, including one widely researched typology that shows they can be validly and reliably described and explained using one or more of the cognitive and semantic one- and twostage incongruity theories, the social theory of disparagement, or the affective and physiological release and arousal-safety theories. The two-stage, incongruity-resolution theory explains how the presentation of two normally incompatible or incongruous message elements, which also share a common meaning, generates humor when a punch line or trigger enables people to recognize the shared meaning and resolve the incongruity. Incongruity and its resolution are at the heart of most humor that passes as “wit” (for example, jokes, puns, and parodies). Humor generated by the ridicule of another person, group, institution, or even idea—which is explained by disparagement theory—is also frequently found in advertisements that take the form of satire. The arousal-safety version of the release or relief theories proposes that people find something funny when they experience a physiological state of arousal regarding the safety of themselves or someone else. If people can make a safety judgment that enables them to conclude that the object of the anxiety is either safe or that the negative consequences are insignificant, the resulting physiological release is experienced as humor (often in the form of nervous laughter).\n\nA History of Humor in Advertising Some advertising scholars have pointed to the pub signs of 16th-century England or the street criers of the 19th century as the earliest examples of the use of intentional humor in sales messages. Historians confirm that humor made its way into the print advertisements of the late 19th century in both Europe and the United States, typically in the form of outrageous claims, limericks, jokes, and slogans combined with gag cartoons. Most historians also agree that the modern era of advertising emerged around 1900, along with the expansion of the print media, improved technologies of mass production for consumer goods, and the emergence of the modern advertising agency. Up to that time, advertisers mainly relied on either announcement advertising or the simple repetition of a product name and logo. Almost all the pioneers of modern advertising in the United States—such as John E. Powers,\n\n5\n\nAlbert Lasker, John E. Kennedy, Claude Hopkins, and Theodore F. MacManus—rejected humor. They were almost entirely convinced consumers were more likely to be persuaded by rational appeals to logic or an “atmospheric” emphasis on elegance and quality, rather than mere entertainment or novelty. However, humor did appear occasionally in early-20th-century advertising in the form of mild, sentimental humor that often relied on illustrations of children. Among a small handful of other intentionally humorous advertisements were jingles and limericks. The most famous of the limerick campaigns consisted of the hundreds written by early copywriters Minnie Maude Hanff and Earnest E. Calkins, featuring “Jim Dumps” and “Sunny Jim,” for Force cereal. During the late 1920s and Depression years of the 1930s, advertisers relied so extensively on humor in the form of cheap cartoon and comic-strip advertisements that the cost of advertising space in William Randolph Hearst’s Sunday Comic Weekly actually surpassed the more mainstream competitors Saturday Evening Post and Ladies’ Home Journal. During the same period, radio emerged as an important advertising medium in the United States. The influential advertising agency Lord & Thomas was among the first to employ comedians to endorse products. Bob Hope, Jack Benny, and other famous comedians of the day seamlessly integrated humorous programming and advertising—a formula that would similarly be applied to television in the late 1940s and early 1950s. At the end of the 1940s, humor in advertising reached a watershed moment with the debut of World War I flying ace, novelist, and South Carolina businessman Elliot White Springs. Springs’s risqué style—which combined racy, humorous illustrations with sexy puns and double entendre headlines—stretched the period’s envelope of propriety to the breaking point. One of his advertisements, the infamous “A Buck Well Spent on a Springmaid Sheet,” placed 69th on industry trade journal Advertising Age’s list of the Top 100 Advertising Campaigns of the 20th century. The use of humor in mainstream advertising was prevalent by the 1960s, as evidenced by the efforts of some at the forefront of the industry’s creative revolution. William Bernbach’s revolutionary Volkswagen Beetle advertisements of the 1960s— produced by Bernbach and written and designed by Julian Koenig and Helmut Krone—combined photos of the Beetle with such incongruous and self-deprecating headlines as “Ugly,” “Lemon,”\n\n6\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement for Springs Mills, Inc., Springmaid Sheets with the tagline “A buck well spent on a Springmaid Sheet.” The advertisement features an American Indian man wearing a headdress lying in a Springmaid Sheet slung between two birch trees.

Other notable advertising humorists of the period included San Francisco adman Howard Luck Gossage, who created\n\nhumorous ads for Rover cars and Eagle shirts; Mary Wells Lawrence, who was responsible for humorous campaigns on behalf of clients Alka-Seltzer, Benson & Hedges, and Braniff Airlines; and the self-styled “guerrilla-satirist” of U.S. advertising, Stan Freberg, who created humorous campaigns for Contadina\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFoods, Chun King, and Pacific Airlines. Freberg’s famous campaign for Sunsweet Prunes (“Today the Pits, Tomorrow the Wrinkles!”) placed 63rd on Advertising Age’s list of the Top 100 Advertising Campaigns of the 20th Century. Some advertisers and industry observers suggest that advertising in the 1970s returned to the hard-sell style of the 1950s, influenced in part by economic recession and the widely adopted “positioning” approach of Al Ries and Jack Trout. But by the 1980s, there were signs of another creative revolution, including the increasing use of humor, and in 1985, legendary adman David Ogilvy recanted his famous admonition that humor would not sell. The continuing influence of Howard Gossage’s witty, wry, and occasionally satirical conversations with consumers was seen in the work of agencies headed by Cliff Freeman; Hal Riney; Jeff Goodby, Andy Berlin, and Rich Silverstein; and Dan Wieden and David Kennedy. Humorous advertisements created by Cliff Freeman & Partners for client Outpost.com—in which a high school marching band was set upon by a pack of hungry wolves and gerbils were fired from a cannon—are examples of the kind of aggressive, arousal-safety humor that began appearing in the late 1980s, and which became quite prevalent throughout the remainder of the 20th century and into the 21st. The emergence and maturation of modern advertising during the 20th century are characterized by an obvious trend in regard to humor—the century began with the professional belief that humor should rarely, if ever, be used and ended with the widely held belief that humor can be an appropriate message tactic for almost any product, service, or selling situation. Among the most important explanations for this trend are advertisers’ recognition that humor effectively attracts attention; that consumers often purchase products and services for emotional reasons rather than rational ones; that advertising can contribute to marketing objectives without selling products directly; that advertisements should reflect the same content and tone as the entertainment media; and that humor need not necessarily be distracting if it is related somehow to products, services, and the reasons people purchase them.\n\n7\n\nresearch has almost overwhelmingly confirmed that humorous advertisements attract more attention than nonhumorous ones. Surveys have shown that the majority of advertising creative professionals also agree humor is effective at gaining attention, superior to nonhumor in gaining attention, and especially effective for achieving both attention and awareness when used in advertising for a new product. Comprehension and Recall\n\nOnce consumers pay attention to an advertisement, advertisers hope that they will process the information in the ad and be able to remember it later. These hoped-for outcomes are called comprehension and recall. There is, however, some disagreement as to whether humor in an advertisement enhances or detracts from comprehension. The influential cognitive response theory of advertising effects proposes that humor encourages consumers to process advertising messages by first getting their attention. The distraction hypothesis, however, raises the possibility that humor could successfully attract attention but inhibit comprehension and recall by distracting consumers’ attention away from an advertisement’s information, claims, or arguments. This explains why many advertisers over the years have expressed the concern that consumers will remember the humor in an advertisement but fail to recall what was advertised. The most recent studies show that humor can be positively related to recall and comprehension in TV, radio, and magazine advertising, especially for expressive products (those consumers usually buy because of the way they make them feel) and low-risk or low-involvement products (routine purchases that don’t cost much or for which there is minimal risk resulting from making a poor purchase decision). Advertising professionals’ views regarding comprehension are mostly consistent with the findings of empirical research. Most view humor as no more harmful to comprehension and recall than nonhumor; not particularly effective at registering (i.e., getting people to comprehend and recall) complex copy points; but at least as effective as nonhumor for gaining brand name registration and retention, and for registering simple copy points.\n\nAdvertising Objectives and Humor Getting people to pay attention to advertisements is very important, and it is one of the first and most obvious reasons why advertisers originally began employing humor as a message tactic. Empirical\n\nPersuasion/Purchase Attention\n\nConcerns about the effects of a humorous advertisement on persuasion pick up where concerns about attention, comprehension, and recall leave off.\n\n8\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersuasion generally means consumers have developed a positive attitude toward an advertised product, service, or brand, although it is often defined as purchase intention (i.e., the likelihood consumers will make a purchase in the future). Affect-Transfer Hypothesis (Classical Conditioning)\n\nWhen persuasion is defined as purchase intention, then humor seems to affect it by first causing consumers to like the advertisement itself (an outcome and variable called attitude toward the ad) and this liking, in turn, causing them to like the brand (an outcome and variable called attitude toward the brand). The effects of a humorous advertisement on purchase intention by way of attitude toward the ad and brand are predicted by the affect-transfer hypothesis. The transfer of affect (liking as well as other emotional responses) from an ad to a brand is based on classical conditioning. Humor is an unconditioned stimulus and liking is an unconditioned response. They are connected by an unconditioned, or naturally occurring, relationship. When a new or conditioned stimulus—such as the name of a product, service, or brand—is repeatedly delivered with the original stimulus (i.e., humor), this creates a conditioned relationship between the new stimulus and the old response. Consequently, consumers will transfer their old response (i.e., liking) to the new stimulus (i.e., the advertised product, service, or brand). Empirical research has confirmed that this positive affect toward products, services, and brands has a direct effect on purchase intention. Cognitive Response Theory\n\nA second theoretical explanation for how humor affects persuasion and purchase intention relies on the cognitive response theory of advertising effects, rather than the affect-transfer hypothesis. Theoretically, humor can distract consumers from processing the claims or arguments in an advertisement and, in some cases, make it more persuasive. This conclusion is also based on the distraction hypothesis, which predicts that an advertisement with a message that contradicts prior consumer perceptions or beliefs will be more persuasive if consumers are distracted from thinking about the advertisement’s arguments. In this scenario, the distraction hypothesis predicts a positive effect on favorable attitudes and persuasion, as consumers are distracted from rational arguments, encouraging them to accept an advertisement’s message and to be persuaded by it.\n\nResearch Conclusions\n\nEarly empirical research generally supports an overall conclusion that the effects of a humorous advertisement on persuasion probably aren’t any greater than the effects of a serious or nonhumorous one. However, more recent studies offer growing confirmation that humor often affects persuasion in the form of purchase intention and does so via its effects on attitude toward the ad and attitude toward the brand. Advertising professionals’ views are somewhat consistent with these research findings. The majority generally agree that humor can enhance positive mood and that a positive mood enhances persuasion, and they disagree that a humorous advertisement likely has a more positive effect on persuasion than a nonhumorous one. However, advertising professionals mostly disagree that humor is effective at increasing purchase intention. And although academic researchers have entirely ignored the question of whether a humorous advertisement is likely to directly cause a sale, advertising professionals are generally skeptical that humor is an effective tactic for gaining actual purchase, and very few of them agree a humorous advertisement creates a greater sales effect than a nonhumorous one. Relevance of Type of Product Being Advertised\n\nBoth researchers and advertising professionals have also directed their attention to the important, strategic possibility that the effects of humorous advertisements might vary based on the type of product for which they’re being used. Research has consistently shown that humor is used most often for expressive and low-risk or low-involvement products, and it also seems to be more effective for them. Advertising researcher Dana Alden and his colleagues found a similar pattern of use holds not just in U.S. advertising, but in Korea as well, and that humor is used more often in advertisements for pleasure-oriented products (similar to expressive products) versus functional products (those consumed for practical reasons) in all but one of the five countries they studied. Research has shown humor is rarely used for expressive/ high-risk products (e.g., jewelry) and functional/ high-risk products (e.g., household appliances) in U.S. radio, TV, and magazine advertising. Although advertising professionals agree consumer nondurables are the products best suited to humorous advertising, a survey conducted in 2006 found they\n\nAdvertisement\n\nbelieve a humorous advertisement could be effective for almost any product, service, or advertising situation.\n\nHumorous Advertisement Typologies Researchers have proposed several typologies to categorize and describe different types of humorous advertisements. Some categorize humorous advertisements along two dimensions—content (e.g., sexual humor) and technique (e.g., puns). As an example, one mixed typology used in a study of American, British, and German trade magazines by researchers Lynette McCullough and Ronald Taylor consisted of aggressive, sexual, nonsense, warm, and pun humor. Advertising theorist Barbara B. Stern proposed the most unique typology of humorous advertisement types; it was based on Henri Bergson’s 1900 theory of laughter, which categorizes comedy into four types along two dimensions—verbal versus physical and romantic versus satiric. Arguably, the typology created by Paul S. Speck as part of his doctoral dissertation at Texas Tech University, the Humorous Message Taxonomy (HMT), has had the most far-reaching influence on the study of humorous advertisements. The HMT proposes that humorous stimuli consistent with the incongruity, disparagement, and arousal-safety theories work sometimes alone and sometimes together to generate the humor in five types of humorous advertisements—satire, comic wit, full comedy, sentimental humor, and sentimental wit. Incongruity alone produces a comic wit advertisement. Disparagement appears in advertising only when it is combined with an incongruity—a combination that produces satire. When an incongruity is combined with an arousal-safety stimulus, warmly empathetic or aggressively shocking, it produces sentimental humor. An arousal-safety stimulus alone—which may arouse feelings of sentimentality, empathy, or anxiety—produces a type of advertisement that Speck calls sentimental comedy. When all three humor stimuli are present simultaneously, the result is a full comedy advertisement. Empirical research leaves little doubt that incongruity-resolution is the most frequent source of humor found in humorous advertisements throughout the world. Researchers Dana Alden, Wayne D. Hoyer, and Choi Lee confirmed that humorous advertisements in several countries—including the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and Germany—depend on an incongruity most of the\n\n9\n\ntime. Moreover, they also found that two of the types of contrasts found in humor scholar Victor Raskin’s influential semantic script theory of humor—expected versus unexpected and possible versus impossible contrasts—also explained the humor in the majority of the advertisements they analyzed.\n\nHumor Relatedness Advertisers have often worried that consumers will be amused by a humorous advertisement but fail to recall anything else about it. Historically, the belief that the humor in a humorous advertisement should be “relevant” quickly emerged along with the more frequent use of humor. In the academic research literature, humor relevance is referred to as thematic relatedness, one of three types of advertising humor relatedness. Intentional relatedness is based on the branch of semiotics called pragmatics and has to do with whether a humorous advertisement’s message or the humor itself is dominant (i.e., whether the humor is subordinate to the advertising message). Structural relatedness, on the other hand, is based on the branch of semiotics called syntactics and refers to the relationship between humor and message elements, that is, how closely connected they are or where they are located in the context of a specific advertisement. Thematic relatedness, which is based on the branch of semiotics called semantics, is the most important type of advertising relatedness and is synonymous with what advertising professionals have been referring to over the years, when they argued that the humor in an advertisement should be relevant. Thematic relatedness means the humor is directly related to the product or service, its uses, benefits, brand name, or users. It seems fairly obvious why thematic relatedness should encourage comprehension and recall; for example, it would be fairly unlikely that anyone in the United States who has ever seen or heard the Aflac duck doesn’t also know the name of the advertisement’s sponsor. The findings of empirical research, a little surprisingly, have been somewhat mixed on the topic of thematic relatedness and its direct effects on advertising outcomes, suggesting they may vary depending on the advertising medium. However, by far the majority of advertising professionals believe that thematically related, or relevant, humor is more effective than unrelated humor. Fred K.
