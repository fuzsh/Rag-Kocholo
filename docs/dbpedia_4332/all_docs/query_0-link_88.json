Each story, replete with humor and pathos, transports the reader to the world of rural East Texas in the mid-twentieth century. Mr. Moore's boyhood was filled with toy soldiers, hot tar on bare feet, fireflies, and shenanigans born of times less electronic, less structured, and certainly less affluent than today.\n\nImagine sitting around a campfire with a storyteller whose history blazes with events so exotic, so traumatic, and yet so rich that they captivate you with greater intensity than the biggest Hollywood blockbuster. Now, envision the author speaking in a comfortable voice, resonant with humility and humor. This is Lad Moore. This is a writer for all mankind, a universal genius.\n\nMr. Moore writes with a folksy elegance that is unparalleled in this age. Reminiscent of the great American masters, Tailwind should and will be included as a fundamental part of America's heritage. The ultimate revelation comes when readers discover that Mr. Moore's tales are true  stemming from a tumultuous and difficult childhood in which he was abandoned by his mother at six months, barely raised by a glamorous, oft-absent father, and shipped off to military school at the age of eight. Betrayed by his father's second wife, who stole the family fortune, Mr. Moore suffered poverty with his beloved grandmother, but thankfully was taught of deeper riches via her warm affection and exemplary morality.\n\nTailwind becomes an extension of one's being. This reader allowed himself a story every few days  stretching the experience as long as possible, relishing each chapter with nostalgic reverence. Take for example, the following vignettes:\n\nIn \"Bologna Sandwich Ceasefires,\" young Lad entertains himself with sweetgum armies, creating legions of soldiers from twigs, spent bullet casings, and acorn hulls. Using rubber band missiles, he demolishes entire battalions in an afternoon.\n\n\"Cannon fire  sweetgum burs collected in a Mrs. Tucker's lard can  rained down on the standing forces from the hill above them. Shots fell equally, alternating between the armies, with full sound effects coughed out from deep in my throat. After the barrage, casualty count determined the winner and loser. Soldiers that lost their upright stance from the bombardment must be broken in half  not to be recycled. A mass grave awaited them in the storm sewer.\"\n\nIn \"Nitelites,\" young Lad imagines he is a railway signalman, waving firefly \"lanterns\" in the air as trains rush past in the dark night. He confesses of \"smudge pot rolling,\" as well.\n\n\" rolling smudge pots was worth it. I could suffer a little tennis-shoe cleanup to see the trail of flaming oil spilling out as the pot rolled down the street. On a good hill, and a skillful roll, I could leave a fireline from Hendry's store all the way to the underpass. Sometimes a few magnolia leaves would catch fire and add to the excitement.\"\n\nIn \"Solomon of Hardesty Farm,\" Mr. Moore describes the enduring friendship of young Lad and an elderly black farmhand in times when racial bigotry was common.\n\n\"Old Solomon towered over me like a big tree with his little spectacles hanging from his nose like a pine cone, ready to break free and fall .Like a detour barricade, Solomon stood between the grape rows with his hoe, its handle worn slick and stained by the sweat from his hands. He moved in reverse like the fiddler crab zigging in the aisles of dirt.\"\n\nIn \"New Cars of Short Duration,\" Mr. Moore describes the pain of having a callous older brother who wrecked their deceased father's 1956 Buick almost as soon as he claimed it. Describing the incident, Mr. Moore writes, \"It had that strange smell of broken windshield glass  an almost sweet odor  like nutmeg and hot plastic.\" When young Lad harbored hopes of owning a car for himself, they were dashed. \"My dreams collapsed like a severed elevator.\"\n\nTailwind sings with poetic images of life in small-town America. When one turns the last page, a sense of sorrow descends, akin to bidding farewell to a dear friend. Consolation comes only in the knowledge that Mr. Moore's second book, Odie Dodie, The Life and Crimes of a Travelin' Preacher Man, is now available for purchase.\n\nJung\n\nDeirdre Bair\n\nLittle, Brown & Co.\n\nBoston, New York, London\n\nISBN: 0316076651, $35.00, 881 pp.\n\nAlma Bond\n\nReviewer\n\nJUNG: A BIOGRAPHY, by the eminent biographer Deirdre Bair, is a meticulously researched, arresting, and well-written book about the great analyst and theorist who is second only to Freud in the annals of psychoanalysis. The biography was authorized by the Jung family, who as his heirs and the recipients of his royalties, have refused access to his archives to those writers they consider unsympathetic to him. Does this make Bair less able to be objective in her assessment of Jung? Perhaps. But then, who among us can be completely impartial?\n\nCarl Gustav Jung was born in 1875 in the vicarage of Kesswil, Switzerland, as the fourth-born but first-surviving child of a poor country parson and his unhappy, troubled wife who believed that she had two personalities. The Jungs were only accidentally Swiss, as Jung's illustrious grandfather, Dr. Med. Carl Gustav I Jung, had been exiled from Germany for political reasons. Rumors abounded (and were boasted of by the subject) that the first Carl Jung was the illegitimate grandson of the great writer, Goethe. That his grandfather was of German heritage and bragged of such distinguished ancestry had a profound influence on young Carl's life. Apparently, the boy was raised to follow in his grandfather's footsteps, both as his namesake and as a physician. It is interesting that as a boy Jung was never referred to at \"Pastor's Carl,\" but always \"Dr. Med. Jung's grandson.\"\n\nCarl was an oddball from the very beginning. A hefty boy much taller than his classmates, he was always bedraggled looking and usually wet and odorous when the weather was bad, as he trudged along on his daily hour and a half walk to school. One morning when he was 13 and walking to school, he had an experience that he said was \"the end of his childhood.\" Feeling as if he were coming out of a fog, he heard himself saying, \"I am myself!\" Like his mother, he had a vision that he had two personalities within himself, an awkward, clumsy boy at the end of the 19th century and that of an old man living in the 18th century who wore high-buckled shoes, a powdered wig, and drove in a fine carriage. Around the same time he had a recurring daydream in which God was sitting on his throne in Heaven and shit an enormous turd on the cathedral below. Jung reflected upon this fantasy for the rest of his life. I wonder why such lengthy deliberation was necessary. It seems clear from the image what Jung thought of the church.\n\nThe first time the 24-year-old Doctor Jung saw Emma Rauschenbach, he entered the house of a friend and beheld a 14-year-old, brown-haired girl halfway up the broad staircase. He was smitten instantly, and knew she would become his wife. Captivated by her intelligence and, undoubtedly, her family fortune, Jung wooed and won the young woman. Despite the reluctance of her father that she wed a penniless doctor, they married. After their first child, Agathe Regina, was born, Emma settled into a routine in which her intellectual ambitions were stymied: \"he soared, while she.. took care of the mundane details so that he could\" (p. 83). The marriage lasted for the rest of her life, incorporating certain idiosyncrasies unthinkable to most of their world.\n\nNevertheless, there were three separate occasions when Emma tried to divorce Jung. In each case, he became ill or had a serious accident that necessitated her nursing him back to health\n\nThe most serious attempt occurred around Jung's romance with Tony Wolff, a brilliant young woman of 22 who was his patient. Jung was taken with her intellectual stimulation and camaraderie that he evidently was not able to find in his wife. Jung and Toni fell in love and began an affair so serious that for decades Jung referred to her as \"his other wife.\" For reasons of her own, Emma put up with the situation and lived in a triangular relationship for the rest of her life with Jung and Wolff. The arrangement was deeply distressing to Emma, Toni, and the Jung children, if not to the master himself.\n\nOriginally beloved by Freud and designated as his Christian \"crown prince,\" his \"scientific son and heir,\" and the man who would rescue psychoanalysis from being dubbed the \"Jewish science,\" the two analysts ended their relationship in a disagreement over Freud's assumption that the root cause of neurosis is sexual repression. My impression is that the rupture upset Freud much more than it did Jung.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the book deals with the question of Jung's antisemitism and his sympathy for the Nazi party, the opinion of Freud and many others which followed Jung the rest of his life and still does not go away. Ms. Bair carefully considers the evidence, and comes to the conclusion that Jung cooperated with the Nazis only to ensure the continued existence of psychoanalysis after the demise of the party. Some of us are not so sure. While it is true that he cooperated during World War 11 with Allen Dulles to shed light on the character of Hitler, and was recruited by the OSS to serve the cause of the Allies, I believe that Jung in his heart of hearts was ambivalent about Jews. According to Bair, \"He remained affiliated with German psychoanalysis from the Nazi solidification of power in the 1930s through the first years of the war, insisting that his primary reason was to aid disenfranchised Jewish practitioners, but debate still rages almost half a century after his death\" (p. 431). Even more condemning are derogatory and inappropriate statements he made about Jewish character and culture, such as that \"Freud and Adler had created specifically Jewish doctrines...thoroughly unsatisfying to the German mentality\" (p. 435). Jung did not help his case when he spoke of the \"antichristianism of the jews\"....who are not \"so damned innocent after all, (p. 444)\" and further suggested that the role of intellectual Jews in pre-war Germany would be interesting to investigate. His major detractors insist that Jung was sympathetic to the Nazis because of his ethnic identity as a German, but the issue has not been settled one way or the other. Perhaps it never will be.\n\nMs. Bair believes that Jung is now passé, and \"remembered chiefly for his psychological autobiography, MEMORIES, DREAMS, REFLECTIONS, and for terms he used such as 'New Age,' 'the age of Aquarius,' 'archtypes,' 'anima' and 'animus.' As a Freudian psychoanalyst, perhaps it is unfair of me to say that history is a better judge of Jung's contributions than his contemporaries. I personally have always considered much of his writing gobbledegook which I rarely was able to use in my practice, and I concur with Ms. Bair that his theories on alchemy, UFOs, and extrasensory perception sometimes verge on the psychotic.\n\nJUNG: A BIOGRAPHY, by Deirdre Bair, is a tour de force, and the definitive biography about the famous analyst. It is doubtful whether another biography will equal its thorough and systematic research, or be better written. If there is a criticism of Ms. Bair's research, however, it concerns \"the deficiency of her excellency.\" Granted, the book delves deeply into the heart and soul of Jung, his close associates and family, so that we feel we know them as living people. But are 881 pages really required to accomplish that feat? Wouldn't careful research and fine writing provide similar insight? Certainly the lengthy section which deals with Jung's difficulties in getting his books ready for publication could be cut drastically without lessening the value of the biography. In any event, this reader (who, incidentally, finds it difficult while reading to handle so hefty a book), is frequently told more than she really needs to know.\n\nNevertheless, because of its immaculate scholarship, excellent writing, and absorbing story, JUNG: A BIOGRAPHY is highly recommended to people who love biographies, to students of psychology and psychoanalysis, and all those who enjoy a good read.\n\nThe Saint Botolph's Review No.2\n\nDavid Andrews Ross and Daniel Weissbort, editors\n\nViper Press\n\n3 Powys Gardens, London, NW11 8HH, UK\n\nISBN: 0955292506, $18.00 US / 10 Brit. pounds, 34 pp.\n\n(Send Cheques Only with postal address to Viper Press.)\n\nAnn Skea, Reviewer\n\nhttp://ann.skea.com\n\n'Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes': these linked names, like 'Cathy and Heathcliff' now resonate with a whole romantic, tragic story, but this story began just fifty years ago when a new literary magazine, the Saint Botolph's Review, was launched.\n\nIn 1956, like all those involved with the Review, Sylvia and Ted were young, unknown Cambridge undergraduates. Sylvia, at 24, was an American Fulbright Scholar who had been up at Cambridge for just a few months. Ted, at 26, was (as he wrote in Birthday Letters) \"sitting youth away\" in a temporary office job in London and \"received / Into Alma Mater\" at weekends to be with his friends.\n\nTed and his friends shared a love of poetry and song. They met regularly at a local Cambridge pub to talk, drink and sing old folk-songs. They also sometimes met in the garden of the Saint Botolph's rectory, where one of them, Lucas Myers, had lodgings in a converted chicken shed. Their decision to create and publish a new magazine was a youthful, but serious, challenge to the accepted literary fashions of the time, and on February 25th, 1956, at a memorable party, Saint Botolph's Review was launched and Ted and Sylvia met for the first time.\n\nBoth Sylvia and Ted wrote (not entirely accurately) about this party and so it has become the stuff of legend. But the Review languished, those who wrote it, produced it and launched it went on with their lives, and only a few copies survived for scholars and collectors eventually to haggle over.\n\nNow, fifty years later, the Saint Botolph's Review No.2 has appeared. It was always intended that the Review would be \"published occasionally\", but this second occasion has been so long in coming that David Andrews Ross, who remains the editor, writes that \"many of the people who attended the enormous party to launch the first issue ... must now be dead\". He mentions Joe Lyde, whose band (with Joe on trumpet) provided the music; Ted whose poetry was included in the first Review; and Sylvia, who danced with Lucas Myers (another early contributor, but still very much alive) and who, in a romantic encounter with Ted that night, lost her hairband and bit Ted so hard on the cheek that he wore the \"ring-moat of tooth-marks\" for the next month.\n\nDaniel Weissbort, who was dragged, groggy with a bad cold, to play the piano in Joe's band at that memorable party, has worked with David Ross to edit and produce this second issue. Lucas Myers, Daniel Huws, Than Minton, George Weissbort, all of whom contributed to the first issue, have provided new material. And others, who at various times over the years have shared their interests are included.\n\nInevitably Sylvia and Ted are remembered: especially in an essay by Lucas Myers, who was a lifelong friend of Ted's - \"one / Among those three of four who stay unchanged / Like a separate self\" (as Ted wrote in 'Visit' in Birthday Letters). Myers records his own memories of the couple and he writes of Sylvia's \"varied voices\" in her letters and journals and of the distorted view these sometimes gave people of Ted's character.\n\nTed's own previously unpublished introduction to poems by Susan Alliston attests his essential generosity of spirit. Sue was a neighbour of his at 18 Rugby Street in London and she is memorialized in the Birthday Letters poem of that title. She is the woman in the poem who, three years after Sylvia's death, was pacing the floor, \"dying of leukemia\" (actually, of Hodgkin's disease). Daniel Weissbort and Olwyn Hughes found Sue's poems in her flat after her death and when Daniel suggested publishing them Ted wrote this introduction. Shortly after this, Daniel and David Ross set up the Viper Press \"planning to publish a few books\" but the project never went ahead. Only now, \"a few decades later\", have they revived the Viper Press because, as David Ross says, they want to celebrate \"pieces of good writing, poetry and prose, which we think worth reading\".\n\nIn 1956, the contents list of the first issue of Saint Botolph's Review read as follows:\n\nPoems by:\n\nDavid Ross\n\nE. Lucas Myers\n\nDaniel Huws\n\nDaniel Weissbort\n\nTed Hughes\n\nAn Impression in Hospital, Than Minton\n\nAunt Palestine's Girl, E. Lucas Myers\n\nLetter from a Painter, George Weissbort\n\nNow, in 2006, the contents of Saint Botolph's Review No.2 are:\n\nEditorial:\n\nLucas Myers: The Voices of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes\n\nTed Hughes: Susan Alliston: An Introduction\n\nSusan Alliston: Poems\n\nDavid Ross: The People Plague\n\nDaniel Huws: Poems\n\nNathaniel Minton: Possibilities for the resolution of Tribal Warfare\n\nLes Murray: Poem\n\nDaniel Weissbort: From Life and Songs\n\nKathy Duggan: Poem\n\nGeorge Weissbort: The Neglected Art of Looking at Art\n\nTom Hoogewerf: Poems\n\nLenrie Peters: A United Africa?\n\nAnn Skea: Poems\n\nPosy Simmonds: Drawing\n\nBiographical Notes\n\nOnly 200 copies of Saint Botolph's Review No.2 have been printed.

Lewis\n\nGeorge Sayer\n\nCrossway Books\n\nWheaton, Illinois\n\nISBN: 1581347391, $13.99, 457 pp.\n\nBrenda Daniels\n\nReviewer\n\nI chose this book to review because I enjoy biographies. As a Christian, and English language graduate, I began reading the works of author and religious writer, C. S. Lewis, and thought that a record of the author's life would be interesting and illuminating.\n\nMany books have been written about C. S. Lewis and his prolific work. Whilst this book claims only to be a life of Lewis, and not the sole work on him, it is a fairly comprehensive and chronological record. Sayer, a personal friend of Lewis, writes objectively, painting a balanced portrait of Jack (as he was known to his friends). He is open about Jack's early practice of masturbating. He also defends Jack's father, Albert Lewis, against Jack's \"(despising) his father for what he regarded as Albert's lack of culture\" p74, evenly describing Albert as a \"remarkably well-read\" man who tried hard to be a companion as well as a father to his sons. Of Jack's Oxford days, Sayer records that many students had the impression that Jack hated teaching. In his defense, though, Sayer describes Jack's demeanour towards his students as unfailingly courteous, genial and cheerful. Of Jack's wife, Joy, Sayer openly admits that most of his friends \"did not like her\" p357. He describes Jack's strange relationship with Mrs Moore and the initial 'legal-only' marriage to Joy, followed later by Christian vows.\n\nIn a balanced portrait of the author Sayer also describes Jack's lifelong commitment to friendship (p390), his sensitivity as a young boy, his brilliance as an academic, his journey towards faith and his love for Joy, the woman he married late in his life before her death only three years later. On page 369 Sayer says that: \"Although (Joy and Jack) were often both in great physical pain, it was the happiest period of their lives.\" Jack also had a deep appreciation for nature, right up to the time of his death. Sayer describes a visit he and Jack made to Woburn estate: \"We sat on a fallen tree trunk, and Jack gazed radiantly at the elegant little animals and adored the God who had created them\" (p402).\n\nTrue to the chronological form, Sayer describes Jack's works as he wrote them. Jack's work was prolific and included in excess of 50 books as well as letters and radio broadcasts.\n\nSayer not only mentions Jack's works but he comments on and critiques them as well. Works such as The Allegory of Love, Out of the Silent Planet, The Great Divorce, Surprised by Joy, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and popular works like The Chronicles of Narnia are all mentioned. This makes the book substantial reading and will appeal to Lewis devotees as well as those with an interest in literature. However, the author's language is accessible and he balances commentary with personal details of Jack's life. This ensures a more general audience appeal.\n\nSayer's book balances interesting academic critique with personal details. In keeping with the academic nature of Jack's and Sayer's work and lives, this book maintains as objective a standpoint as possible. However, it is on the whole a biography of a personal life and all that encompasses, including Jack's early life, the loss of his mother, the war years, his relationship with his alcoholic brother, illness, grief and death. In the afterword, Sayer defends Jack's Christianity and his morality. The book ends with Jack's death from renal failure. Warren, his brother, could not bear to attend the funeral or face life without his beloved SPB (Smallpigiebotham  Warren's lifelong nickname for Jack). Such personal references I found exceedingly touching and was left with a feeling of great sadness for a brilliant and private man who found intimacy only late in life and lost it so soon after finding it. His work was his passion and his extensive personal library his treasure. I view Jack in much the same way.\n\nJack includes an extensive bibliography of books by and about C. S. Lewis, notes and an index.\n\nBeyond the Breakwater (third printing)\n\nRadclyffe\n\nBold Strokes Books, Inc.\n\n430 Herrington Road, Johnsonville, NY 12094\n\navailable from Bella Books, StarCrossed Productions or libertas.co.uk\n\nISBN: 1933110066, $15.95, 320 pp.\n\nCheri Rosenberg\n\nReviewer\n\nBeyond the Breakwater by Radclyffe is a memorable lesbian romance. It is evident that in each of her novels, Radclyffe displays excellent character development, strong plot lines, and satisfying conflict resolutions. Picking up where Safe Harbor, the beginning of the Provincetown Tales left off, the sequel is equally enthralling. Sheriff Reese Conlon and Dr. Tory King are more in love than ever and they are planning to take their relationship to the next level. About to become parents, it is refreshing to watch how Reese worries and protects Tory during her pregnancy. The love and intimacy they share is the highlight of the book. Reese is one of those characters you can't help but love completely and wish for ultimate happiness. She's one of a kind and a genuinely good person through and through. Tory is equally wonderful and you just know they will make wonderful parents.\n\nAs much as it is great to revisit Reese and Tory, Beyond the Breakwater is Bri Parker's story too. Bri and her girlfriend Carre, both twenty, deal with being young lesbians growing up in a less than tolerant world along with outside distractions and temptations. They are trying to find their way into adulthood, responsibility, and their respective careers. Bri makes choices out of love without consulting Carre and unexpectedly leaves her in Manhattan to go home to Provincetown. Can a long distance relationship survive? Are Bri and Carre committed enough to one another to weather any storm? Radclyffe gets into the minds of her characters and accurately portrays her character's hopes, dreams, growth, angst, and joys. The strengths and weaknesses of all her characters make them as real as they can be.\n\nI highly recommend Beyond the Breakwater because Radclyffe gives readers exactly what they expect in a romance novel. To her credit, the author never bogs the story down with superfluous details. Even when the scene changes from Reese and Tory to Bri and Carre, it enriches the story since it's easy to care about more than one couple. I enjoy the way Radclyffe employs different techniques to convey the plot. Whether using the action as it unfolds or relaying past events through the eyes of her characters, Radclyffe knows how to make it interesting and how to hold the reader's attention. Don't miss Beyond the Breakwater. It has sizzling sex, terrific character growth, and a story you won't soon forget. The Lambda Literary Award winning sequel, Distant Shores, Silent Thunder, is also a finalist for a Golden Crown Literary Society award, and deservedly so. Radclyffe is one author you can count on to deliver a book you will enjoy because it is life affirming, romantic, and packs an emotional punch that will leave you invested in the characters, and wishing they were part of your life.\n\nTo the White Sea\n\nJames Dickey\n\nDell Publishing\n\nNew York City, NY\n\nISBN: 0385313098, $11.95, 275 pp.\n\nChristopher Baldwin\n\nReviewer\n\n\"A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of laughter more terrible than any sadness---a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the Sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility.\"\n\n----Jack London\n\nTo the White Sea is a brutal, lyrical odyssey of an American's trek across World War Two Japan from Honshu to the snowy wastes of Hokkaido, the northernmost island. Compared to Jack London, master of the primeval tale, James Dickey, the author of Deliverance, is even more primitive, if that is possible. For while London described the ferocity he found in the struggle of man and beast to survive in the northern wild, Dickey's narrator is striving to become an animal in the wasteland.\n\nEverything in this story told by Muldrow, a mythological Anthropos or Primordial Man as Dickey constructs him, is of his senses: the blue-gray hue of a winter sky; the stench of sewage; the rumble of bombed buildings collapsing in sections; the wail of panicked Tokyo crowds lumbering through charred streets like a cattle-herd.\n\nBut in order for the narrator to reach the ice of the North, the fire in Tokyo must first light the way. On the night of March 9, 1945, Muldrow, tail gunner on a B-29 Superfortress, takes off from Tinian Island along with three-hundred and fifty bombers. The day before, a Colonel has detailed what is in store for the people of Japan:\n\n\"We are going to bring it to him. Fire. Up yonder. Up yonder to the north. North and fire. We're going to put him in it. We're going to put fire all around him. We're going to put it over him and underneath him. We're going to bring it down on him and on to him. We're going to put it in his eyes and up his asshole, in his wife's twat and in his baby's diaper. We're going to put it in his pockets, where he can't get rid of it. White phosphorous, that'll hold on. We're going to put it in his dreams. Tokyo is going to remember us.\"\n\nThis raid is the climax of a three-month firebombing campaign designed by Air Force General Curtis LeMay to end the war by burning the Japanese nation to a cinder. Loaded to the gills with incendiaries, the Superforts conduct the most devastating raid of all, worse even than what will come to Hiroshima in August, obliterating 16 square residential miles in Tokyo and killing 85,000 civilians. Built essentially of teakwood and bamboo, floods of fire roll, roil, and gush through the buildings, streets, and infrastructure of Japan in an all-consuming torrent. At ground zero the temperature rockets to 1800 degrees. Canals boil over, metals melt, and human beings burst spontaneously into flames.\n\nMuldrow parachutes onto the edge of this inferno when his ship is blasted by flak, and lands near the Tokyo docks where he holes up in the cockpit of a crane and then in a sewer pipe. He plans to weave his way out of the city in the pandemonium and make for the countryside where avoiding people is easier, and then move north like a migrating caribou.\n\nEquipped only with his G.I. emergency kit containing a tiny map, knife, fish hooks, twine, flints, a compass and flashlight, he is nonetheless uniquely suited to survive. Raised by his father on Alaska's Brooks Range, he has learned to stalk game, traverse glaciers, navigate through ice lakes in kayak and snowshoes, stay warm, make shelter, and keep camouflaged like the snowshoe hare. Of his prowess he says, \"I could outthink any animal or bird that lived in the cold, by thinking more like he did than he could do.\"\n\nThe Wild is not his problem; the problem is getting there safely, through a rabid populace that will tear an American soldier to pieces. To illustrate the danger, Muldrow, skulking in the hills, witnesses a downed flier decapitated by a mob and the severed head kicked about like a soccer ball.\n\nGuided by Polaris, he eventually manages to hop a train and lie hidden in the wood of a log-carrying freight car. Far from feeling fear or dread over his predicament, Muldrow is a happy man, reveling in his element. With the night train chugging forward under a full moon, he spins a fantasy of Alaska, imagining himself as a lynx standing atop a hill with others of his kind, then plunging into a herd of caribou and cutting out a calf while the frightened herd thunders off. Howling in his fantasy, he lets loose for real on the train--- there is no one to hear him--- throwing back his head and howling lustily at the star-studded sky, baying the moon. \"What had me,\" he says, \"was more than I was. I couldn't help myself and didn't want to.\"\n\nWith this scene we begin to glimpse the depth and power of the novel. For Muldrow is clearly in the grip of an archetype, an enduring primordial image of himself as a man-beast, simultaneously hunter and hunted, predator and prey. The motif of the man-beast, whether called a Werewolf, a Minotaur, a Yeti, or some other name, is common to all cultures in all times. And true time, as an American Buddhist monk whom he meets explains, is the time of the psyche which is eternal; the human psyche intrinsically possesses and passes on a race-memory that draws it back even to its own origins, to the world of pure instinct. \"You are two people,\" the monk says. \"One lives in the mechanical time of the clock. The other one watches what the first one does. He watches from the dream, when the spirit comes loose from the clock. The second self can go backward in time.\" The theme of de-evolution, of an atavistic descent into the unconscious, will reach full flower in the story's climax.\n\nDespite capture and a savage beating by Japanese soldiers, Muldrow engineers a daring escape and at last arrives at the strait, where he steals a boat and rows across what he conceives of as a white sea, the heart of ice, to Hokkaido and the North of his dreams. In a snow swept forest he tracks a herd of goat-like creatures and, after a vicious goring, Muldrow kills a bull. He then settles down in the snow and feasts with gusto on raw animal-flesh, hoping to ingest its mana, its spirit, man predatory and primitive as any brute that ever lived: \"I started to eat, first off the hip and then up around the spine, bringing the blood in too, as much as I could get. Don't let anybody ever tell you blood is not good to drink They say about the wolverine that it will never be driven off a kill, that it'll die before it will leave what it's eating. I could believe it; I out-ate any wolverine.\"\n\nIn the Wild he meets and shares food with an ancient hunter. Fascinated by his knowledge, Muldrow remains with him and learns the ways of his hawks, inheriting them after the old man dies. When, in a symbolic conclusion Muldrow at long last achieves his heart's desire---the death of his human body--- his soul begins to molt and he metamorphoses into a great-winged bird of prey. Though at first glance this may seem silly, the climax was actually being prepared on the book's second page and the entire narrative bent was toward this end. Obviously for\n\nDickey there is more honor among the animals of the world than among men. Much better, then, to be one of them. After all, it was not the caribou nor the hawks nor the bears that burned down Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki. Man-made and technological, a forbidden fruit plucked from the tree of consciousness, fire here represents the worst attributes: cruelty, corruption, lust for domination, naked aggression, murderousness. Though beasts may be, in Jack London's phrase, \"red in tooth and claw,\" they live and die by natural selection and are without evil purpose, without malice, without sin. Those distinctions are reserved for man. Dickey contrasts animals hunting food in the pristine north of immutable cold to the human butchers down below, hauling the hellfire of war along behind them with both hands.\n\nTo the White Sea is a very fine novel, beautifully crafted, with the incidents arranged in perfect order and building admirable tension before exploding in a worthy finale. It is full of haunting, numinous imagery and possesses a splendid simplicity and economy of language in harmony with its elemental theme. This is unsurprising, coming as it does from the pen of a major American poet. If the plot strains credulity---how predictable that Muldrow proves to be an Alaskan survivalist---(it would have been far more interesting had Dickey made him an accountant), that is a small price to pay for the creation of a modern myth.\n\nThe Tree Sitter\n\nSuzanne Matson\n\nW.

Observing him at a party she noticed \"the tilt of his head when he listened, the way he'd cock an eyebrow skeptically, the silent nodding he'd do through someone's point when you could tell he'd already anticipated what they were going to say. I could see he was smart.\" (p.18) Neil is a dedicated environmentalist. His graduate studies look as if they will lead to a life in higher echelons of the halls of environmental academia. She has finished her third year at Wellesley & agrees to go when he suggests they spend the summer in the endangered forests of Oregon with a group of activists. \"I began to want the forest the way I wanted Neil -- its dampness, sharp smell, furred outline, protective arms, and softly breathing dark. I agreed to go.\" (p.28)\n\nThey trek into the deep forest to meet the others. The trail was confusing but they went forward & came across a deer that stopped & stared at them, then moved on. \"We kept our part of the silence around us, and when we went forward into the space the deer had emptied, I imagined I was stepping into her neutral calm, her peace. And so began my bargain with the woods.\" (p.58)\n\nThey agreed to tree-sit, that is, to occupy a platform in suspension ten stories from the forest floor close to the trunk of the tree itself. This was in rebellion against those who would cut the very old growth tree down. \"I felt perfectly safe, as long as I lay stretched out between Neil and the tree trunk, and I was lulled by a swaying sensation, perhaps imagined.\" (p.87) She was scared at first but she found that she loved it. Sometime during their stay in the tree the tree cutters began to shout & swear at them. They were warned that it was unsafe to remain in the tree longer as the loggers would cut trees around them & they might get hurt. Julie became angry then at the intruders. \"I did know rage suddenly played a role in what I believed. I had met the enemy.\" (p.130)\n\nThe thought of returning to city life seems repugnant to Julie \"the pavements, the sidewalks and traffic.\" (p.137) She loved the \"ever-present undervoices of the woods, its hoots and whistles, rustling and high-pitched cries... How to describe how the air and light seemed to permeate my cells, the oxygen sparkling there, my neurons relaxing away from unnatural electric light at unnatural hours.\" (p.138)\n\nThe euphoria fades as she sees Neil becoming interested in the more extreme reactions to loggers & a society that seems uninterested in his agenda for reform. She finds it necessary to take a closer look at what she has become involved in.\n\nI enjoyed this foray into the lives of environmental activists & began to understand their dedication. Their camp in the woods has its charms & it's easy to see how one would become enchanted with the natural surroundings & the camaraderie of those who occupy that life style. Suzanne Matson's writing gifts take us right into the events. She's an exceptional novelist & the story moves along swiftly & with great energy. A pleasurable read.\n\n52 McGs\n\nedited by Chris Calhoun\n\nCitadel Press / Kensington Books\n\nNY, NY\n\nISBN: 0806524685, $12.95, 192 pp.\n\nDan Schneider, Reviewer\n\nwww.Cosmoetica.com\n\nCertainly more wasteful books (in terms of unrecycled paper and deforestation, as well as intellectual inertia) have been published than 52 McGs, edited by Chris Calhoun, which is a collection of fifty-two of the supposedly most interesting, and well-written, of seven hundred or so obituaries published by a New York Times writer named Robert McGill Thomas, Jr. But even the vapid prose of such hacks as Elizabeth Wurtzel, Dave Eggers, Maya Angelou, Joyce Carol Oates, T.C. Boyle, and David Foster Wallace, can at least be defended by stating that there may have actually been an attempt at something creative going on, despite their repeated failures. This book, a 192 page paperback, put out in 2001, a year after Thomas himself died of cancer, by the Citadel Press, however, could not be more pointless, despite its grandiose subtitle: The Best Obituaries From Legendary New York Times Writer Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.\n\nThe book tries to hagiographize Thomas, an anomic writer of little renown, beforehand, into death's equivalent of Ring Lardner, the famed sportswriter, or H.L. Mencken, the famous curmudgeonly social critic. To read the gushing foreword by novelist Thomas Mallon, one would believe that the only reason the New York Times stayed afloat in the 1990s was due to the scintillating prose of McG., whose reign as the obit writer of record lasted a mere decade, and the death-thirsty public's appetite for his ever so slight spinning of the traditional form. And I do say slight, since that's all that occurs within these pages. Yes, McG. did add in quirky details about his subjects, that others would not have done, but while that works for about twelve to fifteen of the most notable decedents - such as pool hustler Minnesota Fats; Edward Lowe, the inventor of Kitty Litter; celebrity aviator Douglas 'Wrong Way' Corrigan; and Three Stooges comic foil Emil Sitka, the majority of the profiles in this book are of incredibly average people, whose claims to fame were dubious, and the telling of those claims, by McG. a bit bloated and forced. And, while the introduction of the claims may be a notable innovation, the prose with which they are conveyed is rather ho-hum. If you've ever read the vapid dronings of a food critic at an arts alternative newsweekly, you will get the level of 'innovation' and depth' this book, and the writer, can justly claim for the obituary form.\n\nIn short, while there is little doubt his columns were a bit humorous, there is also little doubt that a book like this is an exemplary example of everything that's wrong in publishing today. The only way such a work could ever see print is through a network of cronyism. I wonder who at Citadel Press was Calhoun's contact, or ex-frat buddy? Or did the New York Times, itself, de facto subsidize this book? Because, there is simply no way that a book like this could ever sell outside of Manhattan- and I know it didn't, for I found my copy of it languishing at a markdown bargain book table at a Barnes & Noble, here in Texas, for a mere buck. Does the publishing industry have such contempt for the reading public that it feels it can forcefeed such pointless material and the masses will lap it up? I guess so. Does it really believe that listings of marginally interesting celebrity wannabes has more interest than real stories of real human characters?\n\nPerhaps so, but it does the intelligent reader little good, as this book is three quarters skimmable, and certainly not, as some of the book's blurbs claim, a work by a 'masterful writer who transformed the obituary into an art form.' Nor does McG. delve into any 'deeper truths.' In fact, the book is a veritable ode to the short attention spans, dumbing down of complex issues into sound bites, and general lack of depth that modern American readers have been wired into with the cyber-revolution. The obits go on for only a couple of pages, yet they give no real depth nor context to the dead, and only highlight their most freakish, inane, or pitiable deficiencies. That these obits were somehow nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1995 says all one needs to know about the contemptible intellectual rape of our culture. That said, these obituaries are not poorly written, in any way, shape, nor form, but given the strictures of the obituary, this book is like a love song to the 'art' of business letter writing, and hailing a writer who developed a closing to rival Sincerely, or Regards, as a master to rival Herman Melville.\n\nHere is a sample of the 'great stylings' from McG., in his obit titled Minnesota Fats, A Real Hustler With A Pool Cue, Is Dead:\n\nAlthough his frequent claim that he had never lost a game 'when the cheese was on the table,' was more fabrication than exaggeration, according to his first wife, Mr. Wanderone [Fats' real name] was in fact a master hustler who tended to be just as good as he needed to be when he needed to be.\n\nWell, sorry, but if this is the sort of prose that makes one a 'legend' to the New York Times, these days, I can state with certainty that the truly great journalist/writers of the past- Lardner, Mencken, Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, Oscar Wilde- have little to fear in regards to usurpation of their laurels with this work.\n\nThus, it is not without some irony that I can state that the actually best written and most moving McG. in the book is the only one not written by McG., himself, but about his own death, and written by a Michael T. Kaufman. In it, we get a real sense of a man, not a hit and miss semi-satire, which was the deceased's forte. Clearly, this book was a labor of love, by Calhoun, who is identified merely as a fan of McG.'s (ok, a fan of obits, sheesh!) but it is simply not a joy to read, even for its handful of genuinely funny moments. In a sense, this book could be considered a McG. on the relevance of the modern publishing industry, which is so creatively and ethically bankrupt that it must spoon pabulum like this to readers too lethargic and narcotized to care that they are being insulted.\n\nThe industry is survived by millions of disappointed readers still hoping for wit, enlightenment, and publishers who will choose to engage them as beings with a brain.\n\nMaking Him Want It\n\nRenee Luke\n\nAphrodisia\n\n850 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022\n\nwww.reneelukenovels.com\n\nISBN 0758214464, $13.95, 261 pp.\n\nEmanuel Carpenter, Reviewer\n\nwww.emanuelcarpenter.com\n\nIn \"Making Him Want It,\" erotica writer Kit finds that she's fresh out of material to submit to her literary agent. Instead of relying on the visual props she keeps at home to break her out of her slump (professionally and sexually), she decides to get some firsthand experience to break free. She later meets a tall, dark and handsome (not to mention well-endowed) stranger at a night spot and after sizing him up decides a one-night stand with him should awaken her inner-freak and get her a bit of satisfaction for herself. Little does she know, the stranger is her literary agent Jamal, whom she has never set eyes on before. That is, until now.\n\n\"Making Him Want It\" is a titillating twist on the boy meets girl routine with enough sensuality in it to make you wish you had a lover on the spot to experience it (or experiment) with. Renee Luke is a mighty fine writer who paints a masterful picture with exquisite detail. Something tells me that Luke is a pen name for a literary great who may be using the erotica market to pay the bills. Though this novel is a bit predictable, it still causes me to yearn for more of her work, especially with a little more substance. This book is muy caliente and perfect for the Zane crowd.

Murder on a Philosophical Note reunites the likeable cast of characters in a new murder mystery. Professor Robert McIntyre is brutally murdered as he goes out jogging one morning before work. He leaves behind a loving wife and two young daughters. Who could have performed such a dastardly deed--and why? Former cop Samantha Peters and her boyfriend, FBI agent Ian Temple have just set up shop as private detectives near the university where McIntyre's body has been discovered. Sam's cousin Anni works at the university and knows the widow. She convinces her cousin to find the murderer and bring him to justice.\n\nGlodowski is a colorful writer and she paints a vivid picture of the town of Madison Wisconsin, where the murder takes place. Her detailed descriptions of setting and historical sites lend a very realistic feel to the novel. There are plenty of twists and turns in this book to keep the reader guessing about who killed the professor. Sam and Ian have a large extended family who help them and lend emotional support. The characters created by Ms. Glodowski will stay with you and leave you wanting more.\n\nThe Original I Ching: The Pure and Complete Texts in Concordance\n\nTranslated by Rudolf Ritsema & Shantena Augusto Sabbadini\n\nWatkins Publishing\n\nSixth Floor, Castle House, 75-76 Wells Street, London W1T 3QH\n\nISBN: 1842931490, $36.33 US / $49.95 AU, 851 pp.\n\nRose Glavas, Reviewer\n\nwww.astrologyrealm.com\n\nThe notion of this being the 'original' I Ching, carefully translated by obvious experts in this field appeals to me immensely, since I like the concept of being able to go directly to the source of information rather than through many different layers of interpretation by a variety of people and in the end being distorted (a bit like 'Chinese Whispers'!).\n\n'The Original I Ching Oracle' was inspired by Carl Gustav Jung's insights into the psyche and has been researched for more than 60 years through the Eranos Foundation of Switzerland. This stunning new work presents the oracular core of the 'I Ching' as a psychological tool. The Eranos Foundation began in 1933 in Switzerland and is an East/West research centre.\n\nRudolf Ritsema had a long history with the Eranos Foundation as the director for 30 years until his retirement. This book is the fruit of his life long involvement with the original texts. Shantena Augusto Sabbadini has a background as a theoretical physicist and joined the Eranos circle in 1991. He has been actively involved ever since then.\n\nThe book itself is as comprehensive as I thought it would be and actually covered a lot more about the I Ching than I thought it would. For example, I found out how to use coins to use this oracle which is handy in that most cultures have access to coins. The book also covers the use of the traditional yarrow-stalk method of using the I Ching oracle.\n\nPart One includes an introduction to the oracle, consultation procedure and language used in the oracle, as well as myth and history and correlative thinking. An extensive note listing and index to Part One is included. It is important to read about the proper consultation procedure if you want to get full benefit from using this ancient oracle.\n\nPart Two gives a listing of each of the 64 hexagrams followed by extensive exploration of each of them. I like the way the original text is in red with additional interpretative material printed in black, leaving you to explore the symbolic meaning for yourself, if you choose to.\n\nPart Three, Concordance, lists all the occurrences of each term appearing in the texts of the Yi Jing (I Ching). What a mammoth task! I certainly don't envy the authors this mammoth task, particularly since they have done a spectacular job in putting it all together in a coherent way. When you stop to think about the complexity of the information found in these texts, you will know what I mean.\n\nIn summary, I would highly recommend 'The Original I Ching Oracle' for the reader who has an interest in the occult, synchronicity, eastern mysticism or the person looking for THE book on the I Ching. It is comprehensive, educational and practical, allowing the everyday person the opportunity to consult an oracle that was originally brought to the West through Jesuit missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the overall scheme of things, a few hundred years isn't a long time to wait for a book of this quality!\n\nThe Culture Code: An Ingenious Way To Understand Why People Around The World Live And Buy As They Do\n\nClotaire Rapaille\n\nBroadWay Books\n\nRandom House, Inc.\n\n1745 Broadway, MD 6-3, New York, NY 10019\n\nCultureCode.com\n\nISBN: 0767920562, $24.95, 208 pp.\n\nPeter Hupalo\n\nReviewer\n\nThe Culture Code: An Ingenious Way To Understand Why People Around The World Live And Buy As They Do by Clotaire Rapaille examines how different cultures view products, events, and concepts. Rapaille argues each product makes a unique imprint on members of any given culture. This imprint can be described in only a few words. For example, Rapaille says the American code for cars is \"Identity,\" while the German code for cars is \"Engineering.\"\n\nFor the last thirty years, Rapaille, a cultural anthropologist, has helped international companies learn and understand these cultural codes by examining how consumers really feel about products. Rapaille worked with Chrysler to discover the code for Jeep. The American code for Jeep is \"Horse,\" a go-anywhere vehicle. Based on this, Rapaille suggested replacing square headlights with round ones, because horses have round eyes. Luxury interiors weren't part of the code. The Jeep was then successfully marketed as a \"horse\" in America. In France and Germany, Jeeps were seen differently. People there associate them with the WWII liberation of Europe. Chrysler marketed Jeeps in Europe as symbols of freedom.\n\nAccording to Rapaille, most cultural imprints occur by a very early age. In America, many people love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, because they ate as children. People associated the sandwiches with care and attention from mom. In other cultures the sandwiches might not have been imprinted at all.\n\nCars also have a strong, positive imprint in America. Rapaille writes: \"[Children] imprint the thrills associated with cars in their youth. Americans love cars and they love going out in them. Throughout the discovery sessions, participants told stories of their excited parents bringing home a new car, about the enjoyment and bonding that comes from families going out for drives together on the weekend, about the breathtaking first ride in a sports car. American children learn at an early age that cars are an essential and vaunted part of family life, that they bring joy and even family unity. When it is time for them to buy a car, this emotional connection guides them subconsciously. They want a car that feels special to them. \"\n\nBased upon his understanding of the American code for cars, Rapaille helped Chrysler develop the concept for the PT Cruiser. Rapaille writes: \"It became obvious to me that because the emotion associated with driving and owning a car is so strong, the PT Cruiser needed to be a car people could feel strongly about. It needed to have a distinctive identity to justify such strong emotions. To create a strong identity and a new car at the same time, we decided to tap into something that already existed in the culture, a familiar unconscious structure. The one we chose was the gangster car, the kind of vehicle Al Capone famously drove. This became the PT Cruiser's signature. It lent the car an extremely strong identitythere is nothing like it on the road todayand the customer responded. Again, if the Cruiser had been just another sedan, the public probably wouldn't have even noticed it, but its distinctiveness tapped into something very emotional.\"\n\nIn addition to products, concepts like beauty, youth, health, home, dinner, money, shopping, luxury, work, and perfection are also imprinted with certain subconscious associations. Rapaille examines how each of these is imprinted in American culture. The George H.W. Bush campaign even hired Rapaille to discover the cultural code for the American Presidency.\n\nWhile many of Rapaille's insights seem spot on, a few seem to be a bit of a stretch. Rapaille suggests being overweight isn't a problem, but a solution. He says the American code for fat is \"checking out.\" This means people get fat, so they can withdraw from society. That seems a bit like asking for the cultural code for gravity. It doesn't necessarily have a cultural explanation. It really seems more an issue of food tasting good and calories in and calories out at the waist. For marketers who want to better understand some of the cultural reasons why Americans behave as we do, I recommend The Culture Code: An Ingenious Way To Understand Why People Around The World Live And Buy As They Do by Clotaire Rapaille.\n\nHow to Sell Clothing, Shoes, and Accessories on eBay\n\nCharlene Davis\n\nEntrepreneur Press\n\nIrvine, CA\n\nwww.entrepreneurpress.com\n\nISBN: 1599180057, $12.95, 189 pp.\n\nLeslie Halpern, Reviewer\n\nhttp://home.cfl.rr.com/lesliehalpern/leslie_halpern.htm\n\nThis Entrepreneur Pocket Guide offers sound business advice for anyone interested in establishing an online business selling clothing, shoes, and accessories, eBay's second-largest category.

If you are one of the thousands of people who appreciate the joyful companionship of pet cats, dogs, ferrets, guinea pigs, and rabbits as family members, then Deborah Straw's truly excellent book, The Healthy Pet Manual, is a must read for you. A glance at Straw's table of contents previews the comprehensive coverage that follows in her rich storehouse of beautifully written and well-documented information. She discusses environmental concerns such as indoor pollutants and how to avoid them by looking for \"toxin-free\" products, \"green-label\" carpets, \"clean air choice\" paints, and by not using any woods or other items that contain urea formaldehyde.\n\nDoubtless, you know already that household cleaning products -- detergents, bleaches, window and toilet bowl cleaners, as well as other specialty cleaners -- can be deadly to animals, but she reminds you and shares a list of especially dangerous chemicals found in commercial cleaning products that Amy Carlton enumerated in her article, \"Spring Cleaning: Using Pet-Safe Products to Clean Your Home,\" and recommends purchasing safer products from companies such as Earth Rite, Harmony, and Seventh Generation, or preparing your own safer cleaning products with baking soda or lemon juice (p. 63).\n\nAnd, in case you do not know already, Straw warns pet care givers, who share their homes and their lives with their pets and perhaps even a tidbit or two from their own plates occasionally, about the dangers of chocolate, which contains theobromine and caffeine, ingredients that are toxic to animals. She also reminds readers that xylitol, a sugar substitute believed not only to be safe but also quite beneficial for humans in numerous ways, is known to be toxic to our four-footed friends. So, remember if you sprinkle xylitol over your own breakfast quinoa, oatmeal, or rice, and your pet goes for these tasty grains, too, keep your pet's serving absolutely free of xylitol. And if you enjoy eating grapes or raisins, be careful not to drop any that your animal companion might pick up and eat, because these seemingly innocent fruits, so filled with goodness for humans, that even may intrigue your pet because of their smell, small size, and shapes that just may invite a swiping paw for a little game of kitchen or living room hockey, have, in some cases, been toxic to pets. Straw also emphasizes the extreme importance of always supplying ample, filtered drinking water served in non-toxic stoneware, glassware, or stainless steel. And she points out the necessity of frequently washing and rinsing the water bowl either in the high heat of your dishwasher or by hand to keep the water bowl clean for the fresh, healthful water for your pet.\n\nOutdoor dangers abound, too. Among the culprits, Straw enumerates not only ethylene glycol in antifreeze but also herbicides, pesticides, automobile emissions, smoke, and even some flea killing products that, when used improperly, even may be carcinogenic. Safer flea-ridding alternatives are available. In addition, she enlightens readers that, just as too much sun can endanger humans, too much sun can hurt animals.\n\nStraw not only discusses the supreme importance of high quality nutrition, but also she exposes the abominable, deplorable, and unethical practices of some pet food companies and documents the hideously damaging ingredients that some companies knowingly and blatantly include in their pet foods, then spend thousands of dollars on fancy marketing tricks to seduce would-be buyers. They sell their unfit food for high profits, and, at the same time, begin and foster the destruction of the health and the very lives of the pets you treasure. Straw also cautions you about the overuse of vaccinations and the repercussions from such a practice.\n\nAfter documenting many probable, provable, and preventable causes of dastardly disease in precious pets, Straw discusses conventional treatments, gives insights into pet insurance and PPOs, and introduces alternative therapies including Bach flower remedies such as wild rose, water violet, olive, and clematis, to name a few, and herbs such as artemisinin, Essiac, garlic, Hoxsey treatment, milk thistle, and golden seal. She shares information about the successful use of vitamins such as A, C, E, D, K, and, of course, the energy converters -- B vitamins. Other supplements favored for prevention and treatment include beta carotene, calcium, and selenium, and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), arginine, pycnogenol, and even melatonin (p. 171). Straw not only introduces these various health promoting practices and remedies, but also she offers careful warnings and cautions regarding their safest use singly or in combination with other measures showing her excellent efforts to give a panoramic view of the best available preventive methods and alternative health care treatments. Straw also invites those who treasure pets and appreciate how very much they enrich our homes, our health, and our lives, to find homeopathic and naturopathic care and modalities such as acupuncture, the Tellington Touch (TTouch), Reiki, and massage.\n\nStraw goes beyond the physical aspects of health and discusses the importance of giving thoughtful consideration to the emotional health of pets and to guarding them against unnecessary stresses that can lead to anxiety, depression, or other maladies. In addition, she helps pet care givers emotionally to prepare for and to move through the sad time of losing a pet, having experienced such tender losses herself. You will be amazed at some of the probable causes of disease that she exposes, but, thanks to her excellent research and crisp, clean writing, you will be armed with methods of prevention, safer approaches if problems arise, and help that can give hope to restore health. Straw generously includes a recommended reading list of more than 60 sources and makes every effort to help you help your pets have the best health possible and to live happily with you for many, many years. If you care for your pet as much as I believe you do, then you will share this review with as many pet care givers as you can so that they can find this source of enlightenment where pet care is concerned, purchase it without delay, read it, and share it with others who cherish their pets, too. I cannot praise Deborah Straw and her excellent book, The Healthy Pet Manual, enough. It's a keeper.\n\nLove's Alchemy: Poems from the Sufi Tradition\n\nTranslated from the Persian by David and Sabrineh Fideler\n\nNew World Library\n\n14 Pamaron Way, Novarro, CA 94949\n\nwww.newworldlibrary.com\n\nISBN: 1577315359, $18.00, 224 pp.\n\nPamela K. Taylor, Reviewer\n\nwww.pktaylor.com\n\nFor years, Rumi has been the best-selling poet in the United States. Love's Alchemy opens the door onto Rumi's colleagues in the Persian mystical tradition. Translated from the classical Persian by husband and wife team of David and Sabrineh Fideler, Love's Alchemy includes selections from all the major Persian Sufi poets, some of whom are famous in the West, such as Hafiz, but many of whom are not.\n\nThis is not the kind of poetry book one reads quickly, absorbing feelings and images. Rather, the poems in Love's Alchemy are like a fine merlot, meant to be imbibed slowly  you begin by sniffing their aroma; then hold them up to the light and savor their color; inhale their bouquet; hold the words in your mouth, let the taste of them sink into your pores; feel them warming your throat, let their wisdom spread through your veins and into the depths of your heart. This is how they were meant to be read  and re-read  with thought and reflection that allow the poems to challenge the reader's perception of the worldly and the divine, with a sudden gestalt of insight, with depth of feeling, and with appreciation for the many layers of meaning contained in each phrase.\n\nWhile the poems are completely accessible on their own, the Fidelers have included a very useful short guide to understanding Sufi poetry in their introduction, as well as a glossary of important terms, a discussion of issues in translation, a guide to the various forms of Persian poetry, and notes on individual poems in the appendices. Of most interest to the general reader is the introductory material about the themes and the meanings of particular images that were common in the Persian mystical tradition. Also interesting is the discussion of the structure of the poems in the book, all of which take the \" \"ruba'i\" form. Ruba'i are four line poems which condense a depth of meaning into a few words; good ones weave many layers of meaning into each line.\n\nThe poems presented in Love's Alchemy clearly are among the best. The translation, though, gives pause. Compare, for instance, the literal translation and the Fidelers' rendition as cited in Appendix 1, their discussion of issues in translating from classic Persian to modern English.\n\nLiteral translation:\n\nToday, like every day, we are ruined  ruined.\n\nDon't open the door of thinking; pick up a lute.\n\nThere are a hundred kinds of prayer, bowing and prostration.\n\nFor the one whose prayer niche is the beauty of the Friend\n\nFidelers:\n\nToday, like every day, we are ruined and lonely.\n\nDon't retreat, fleeing your emptiness through the doorway of thinking.\n\nTry making some music instead.\n\nThere are hundreds of ways to kneel in prayer\n\nHundreds of ways to open toward the heart of the Friend's beauty.\n\nIt seems to me that the Fidelers have lost something of the rhythm, the immediacy, the simple beauty, and depth of possible interpretations in their more abstract rendering. With the literal translation the reader has an immediate, intuitive grasp of the poem's meaning akin to the flash of insight one gets while reading a haiku. That first understanding is mellowed and deepened upon re-reading and reflection. But with the Fidelers' translation, the first intuitive understanding is lost, while the reader is led to the philosophical, religious conclusions that, we assume, spoke most loudly to the Fiderlers themselves. The poem remains insightful and thought-provoking, but certain aspects clearly have suffered.\n\nAs I read the poetry in Love's Alchemy, I couldn't help but wonder how many other poems might have been stronger, more direct in their impact, more reflective of the author's skill at layering meaning, if the Fidelers had chosen to be more literal in their translation rather than emphasizing the philosophical and religious insights that were, admittedly, the raison d'etre for the poems. I couldn't help but think that the Fidelers are better translators, and better Sufis, than they are poets.\n\nNonetheless, I found the poetry to be well worth reading. Indeed, Love's Alchemy is the sort of book that readers are likely to come back to over and over, reading only a poem or two at a sitting, taking the time to digest each one slowly and thoroughly. For those who are looking for an introduction to the world of Sufi poetry, it is an excellent doorway. For those who want to explore their own spirituality, it is a sure source of food for thought. For those who simply want to enjoy some classical Persian poetry, there may be better translations available, although they are not likely to contain a wider or more representative selection of poems.\n\nThe Psychology of Nuclear Proliferation Identity, Emotions and Foreign Policy\n\nJacques E.C. Hymans\n\nCambridge University Press\n\nISBN: 0521850762 hc, $75.00 / $150.00 AU, 273 pp.\n\nISBN: 0521616255 pbk, $29.99\n\nMary Raum\n\nReviewer\n\nThe total volume of investigative theories related to human factors of proliferation is noticeably dwarfed by operation structure theory and technology and supply side reasoning. In The Psychology of Nuclear Proliferation Identity Emotions and Foreign Policy Professor Jacques Hymans offers an important cognitive model that is a useful study to add to the short library list of psychology based literature in the field of nuclear proliferation. Hymans, an Assistant Professor of Government at Smith College in Massachusetts challenges a common interpretation that strategic calculations by nuclear players are the only or primary reasoning behind a choice to proliferate. He has recently presented his ideas before a group of French military officials.\n\nUsing a national identity conceptions model as a base, links are drawn regarding the personality characteristics and emotional perceptions of leaders who impacted proliferation decisions for the nations of Australia, Argentina, the French Fourth Republic and India. Two dimensions, solidarity and status are shown as interrelated in creating four significant types of national identity: sportsmanlike nationalist, oppositional nationalist, sportsmanlike subaltern and oppositional subaltern. The argument is made that a leader's national identity conception is instrumental in a leader's preference for or against nuclear war related themes. Hymans' argues that what a nation stands for and how high it stands in the nuclear race is not only a social factor but is grounded intersubjectively within the individual leader.\n\nA one time reference to the Rorschach test and interpolations of common myths about international non proliferation keep the reader's attention and make the work enjoyable. There is information on macro political systems as well as individual and organizational decision making theory. Nuclear proliferation is a vast subject and this book fills in some of the more individualized gaps in current literature. The work is unique in its broad scope and application of a variety of structural and behavioral concepts. Readers of political science, management, military science and public affairs would find the content of the book worth examining.\n\nIdentity categorizations are woven throughout several chapters on nuclear choice, struggles in the French Fourth Republic, Australia's search for security, Argentina's nuclear ambition and India's nuclear U-turn in the nuclear arms arena. Two of these nations have ended weapons research, one is a known nuclear power atomic state and the fourth is a thermonuclear weapons state. The big four constituents of nuclear proliferation, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China are not reviewed. These four nations would be of interest in a follow-up study using Hymans' theses and models.\n\nSupport for the ideas presented was derived from interviews with international nuclear scientists and technocrats and review of government documents and academic journals. Categorizations for leader cognitive styles, national identity conceptions are supported through the authors review of vocabulary from speeches and analyses of leader perspectives of Charles deGaulle, Pierre Mendes France, Robert Menzies, Johns Gorton, Gough Whitlam, Ambassador Julio Carasales, Antonia Careea and several significant players in the nuclear history of Argentina and India.\n\nThis part history, part academic study ends with some thoughts about traditional depictions as to why there is nuclear proliferation. Having weapons because it is a deterrent, a point of international status and a way to achieve personal power are shown to be simplified versions of what may be a more complex psychological base of inclusion into the arms community.\n\nThe Good Good Pig\n\nSy Montgomery\n\nBallantine Books\n\n1745 Broadway, New York, NY 10017\n\nwww.randomhouse.com 1-800-733-3000\n\nISBN: 0345481372, $21.95, 240 pp.\n\nJennifer Redmond\n\nReviewer\n\nA Good Good Read\n\nLike E.B. White before her, Sy Montgomery takes us out to study the barnyard in order to learn about the human heart. The tale is a simple one, told beautifully simply: a couple adopts a tiny runt piglet who grows up (and in every other direction) to be a local attraction and a good, good, friend. And while I'll admit that Montgomery's porcine pet Christopher Hogwood is a prince among pigs, her story really warms up (in both senses of the word) as we begin to know the whole family, animal and human.\n\nThe sweet Border collie is so typical of the breeddriven, loyal, and somewhat possessed. The image of her chasing Frisbees in the dark of night is one that will stay with me, though neither I not the author actually saw it. The chickens who rule their little roost, but not much else, are a welcome bit of gently comic relief, like some sort of feathered Greek chorus. The human chorus is also colorful, whimsical and much more weird than the occupants of the barn; neighbors and townspeople, and a motley crew of roommates, mostly female, mostly eccentric, all add spice to this home brew of more-urban-than-country rural life.\n\nLast, but far from least, is Montgomery's husband Howard Mansfield, also an author, who seems to meet each minor emergency and major crisis with the same calm demeanor, without seeming any less kind and caring for his competence. Shunned and maligned by the author's mother (in spite of her ignorant prejudice we grow to care about this strong-willed Southern lady, and mourn her inevitable passing) he refuses to get miffed at his mother-in-law or at the seemingly endless parade of animals, large and small, adopted, injured, and recuperating, that fill his homeor if he does, we never hear about it.\n\nWhen the author takes off on various work-related writing jaunts to places like Brazil, she gives us a tiny taste of those exotic locales, but the story is mostly, at home in her home. She gives us dawns and dusks, falls and springs, frosts and thaws. Against this backdrop are not just domesticated animals, but wild birds and hunting weaselsall roaming the same turf, all oddly, somehow, basically getting along.\n\nAnd of course, there's Chris himselflarger than life, and great of heart, with an appetite for hedonism unmatched in modern literature. How grand to hear of someone who manages to get rubbed the right way almost as much as he gets to fill his belly with the \"leftovers\" (from gourmet to godawful) of a whole town. Animal tales can never end completely happily, but this one deposits us gently, like Hogwood himself, rolling in good clean mud, at the end of a good run. The book, like this special pig's life, is destined to be remembered as both well-loved and loving.\n\nHer Perfect Life\n\nVicki Hinze\n\nHarlequin Enterprises Limited\n\n225 Duncan Mill Road, Don Mills, Ontario, Canada M3B 3K9\n\nISBN: 0373836929, $5.99 US / $6.99 CAN, 288 pp.\n\nBonnie Toews, Reviewer\n\nwww.bonnietoews.com\n\nRating: Five Stars\n\nA Significant Tribute to Women Prisoners of War in Modern Times\n\nOnly Vicki Hinze could write such an insightful, passionate, human drama and still call it romantic suspense. Yet, if Danielle Steel had written this moving story, there would be an immediate clamor to adapt it for television, especially since it is about a woman air force pilot shot down over Iraq in the Gulf War. This novel should be on screen. It delves into the depths of a woman, who, by virtue of being a combat pilot, makes her a different breed from other heroines.\n\nFew authors explore what drives a woman to fly in male-dominated skies. Is it competition? Is it arrogance? To fly today's fighter jets she has to be precise, smart and have calculating nerve under stress, the same as any top gun. Robert Gandt, a former top gun himself, writes military thrillers and depicts two kinds of women combat pilots in his stories: those who use their gender to make a political statementthey have ambition but they are actually unsuitable to flyand those who are born with flying in their blood. He recognizes there is no sexual difference between real \"flyers.\" There is only their desire to soar and to feel the spiritual freedom birds experience. A born flyer is a very independent being. To be in a military environment would seem to be an oxymoron for such independent souls, but for all of their apparent daring and brash nerve, genuine pilots are very grounded people. They have an innate discipline and spiritual awareness of \"being at one\" with their aircraft, its flight/ground crew and, at times, with the supreme maker of the Universe.\n\nUnderstanding this is what makes Vicki Hinze's heroine, Captain Katie Cole Slater, a fascinating study. Her will to survive through torture and rapeendless days, months, years of captivitystems as much from the natural courage of being a woman, who is a wife and mother, as it does from her innate drive to become a pilot. Her mantra\"That which is endured is conquered\"builds momentum through the novel as she gains remarkable wisdom and strength during her journey into hell as a prisoner of war and through smashed dreams when she returns. She rises above the expected bitterness that many in her shoes would feel, and she does it in a most credible waythrough the interior dialogue the character shares with the author's readers.\n\nThis story starts with Katie's rescue from imprisonment in Iraq six years after her plane was shot down, but flashbacks as her full memory returns of her terrible ordeal depict what she suffered and how she suffered. What sustains her is her dream of returning home to her husband and two children, but once she is returned to them, she has to face how their lives have changed. Believing she was dead, her husband remarried, and the children adore their stepmother. Katie's former co-pilot also survived the crash but can no longer fly. His friendship becomes her lifeline, for the hope that kept her alive is dead. Now she has to rebuild her life completely without her husband and reclaim her children without alienating them.\n\nI dare say the reason Katie triumphs over such devastating blows may be because she is a woman and not a man. She benefits from a woman's nurturing nature. Nevertheless, Katie's psychological resolution is in sharp contrast to the experience of nurses returning from Viet Nam as depicted in the TV series, \"China Beach,\" where the lead character became an alcoholic when she couldn't reconcile her life at war with her life in peacetime. Katie triumphs. She finds love; she reclaims her two children without disrupting or separating them from everyone they love; and she channels the sense of achievement she gained from flying into a different passion designing gardens. She has a whole life; she loses it, and she regains it fully, but at a price. Traumatic flashbacks still possess her ten years later, but she makes peace with themshe lets them go. And they gradually fade into the past where they belong.\n\nCaptain Katie Cole Slater's personal belief system sets up a remarkable role model for any victimized women regardless of the reason or circumstance. This is why this story must be made into a movie. It not only deals with the individual battle endured by those up close and personal with \"the actual enemy\" but also with what so many North American families are coping with today in the West's global war against terrorism: the waiting and the loss of those they love; for even when they are lucky enough to embrace their loved ones again, they are forever changedoften physically, but definitely emotionally, psychologically and philosophically. Both women and men need to see that bad things that happen to people, whether in war or in their daily lives, can result in good endings. Thank you, Vicki, for telling Katie's story. I loved it.\n\nIntersect: A Love Story\n\nHarold Torger Vedeler\n\niUniverse, Inc.\n\niuniverse.com\n\n2021 Pine Lake Road, Suite 100, Lincoln, NE 68512\n\nISBN: 0595304354, $12.95, 155 pp.\n\nPeter Weiss\n\nReviewer\n\nGhost in the Machine\n\nShannon extends her arms, reaches for Alicia. Alicia hesitates, trembles. Her mouth is just open and her eyes draw a picture of despair. And then Shannon embraces her, draws her close and holds her. Alicia is weeping now, her face visible and then buried in Shannon's bodice, weeping because she knows suddenly that it is all right, that it is just a game and that there is more in the world. Something that does not die.\n\n[from \"Intersect: A Love Story\"]\n\nIntersect is the creation of Torger Vedeler in his debut novel \"Intersect: A Love Story\" and is a thoroughly fascinating invention. Part game, part sport, part quasi-religious experience, it is an event fed directly into the global collective conscious via virtual reality chairs occupied by the enthralled billions of the world, young and old alike, who hang onto it as if for dear life.\n\nAnd indeed Intersect is life, pure and direct and immediate, as captured and conveyed in the psychic performances of prepubescent girls, thrusts and parries, pirouettes and constructs fed through a network of computers as a series of shapes and numbers, synapse firings, able to express nothing less than the primary human experiences such as Beauty and Joy in a pure form of geometric and emotional code. It is as pernicious as heroin to the populace, yielding immediacy to a world starved of authentic, transcendent reality. Mr. Vedeler has written a very right-brain book to tell a very left-brain story.\n\nThe tale centers on an elite group of reigning Intersect champions and their relationship to one another, to their fans, and to the game that has made them the envy of the world. We follow the young girls as they struggle to deliver what the world craves of them. And what it craves most is to live vicariously through their concrete expression of abstract Love.\n\nThe game itself has aspects of fencing and gymnastics, chess, modern dance, tennis, and is something on the order of the World Cup, the Super Bowl, and the Academy Awards combined in terms of popularity. The greatest practitioner of the art of Intersect is our heroine, thirteen-year-old Shannon O'hea. We observe as Shannon pursues the World Championship, her fourth, in a series of matches played from a Chicago museum, and so does our hero, fifteen-year-old Georgie Collins, who has more than a puppy-love-crush on beautiful Shannon.\n\nGeorgie, a mere face in the crowd, senses deeper truths about Shannon, senses that Intersect is something other than the symbiotic enterprise it seems, and eventually vows to intervene into a world in which he has no part. Intersect is a girl's game, and Mr. Vedeler's feminism informs him that the purest expression of human love emanates from the pre-sexual female and that her combination of emotional honesty and psychic dexterity allows the best to achieve and impart something on the order of universal truths culminating in the liquid sunshine of pure love.\n\nHeady stuff. Yet the crux of the novel is very much a coming-of-age story as we watch these adolescents come to grips with their situations. Shannon, like all Intersect girls, is insulated from the world, living within an entourage populated by women, and is ultimately alone in a cocoon of celebrity and privilege. Georgie is alone too in his awareness that Intersect is essentially a parasitic evil consuming its champions and that Shannon needs help.\n\nThe wheels are in motion as Shannon strives for friendship in a world that denies friendships and strives for perfection in a world that demands perfection. Georgie pursues his love beneath the cold, hard social and family structures that would deny him access to his love. As the tournament progresses, Shannon moves toward her dual goals as Georgie is torn between wanting Shannon both in the perfect hard-wired version and as the flesh-and-blood girl that she is.\n\nGradually Shannon learns what Georgie already senses as she witnesses what Intersect can do to its greatest players, the price extracted by the process of attaining emotional omniscience and omnipotence. She is compelled to look within herself for the ultimate measure of her mastery of Intersect. Yet she doesn't realize that Georgie holds the final key to the symbiosis she seeks.\n\nMr. Vedeler's canvas allows him to explore both the psychological motivations of his characters and the larger social implications of mass celebrity and mass gratification as well as the more ethereal meanings of friendship and love and the aesthetics of a game whose goal is to produce seismic emotive reactions. The scope is at once broad and narrow as we watch the world react to The Game and its participants and his characters contend with the clamoring world, with Intersect, and with one another.\n\nTo his credit, Mr. Vedeler doesn't write the characters up beyond their years, as he clearly could have, but allows them their own adolescent voices and naivete and in so doing distills their motivations to the most basic human components. It is a journey of self-discovery and maturation for them as they move toward a final and unexpected resolution. In the right hands, \"Intersect: A Love Story\" could make a fascinating movie with its futuristic approach to universal yet very current problems.\n\nThe psychic ghosts in Mr. Vedeler's machine may well be the young women dueling out their amorous pyrotechnics in the matrices of cyberspace all in pursuit of the perfect point, the perfect joining, but so too is the author as he shows us that real life is, and can only ever be, messy and imperfect.\n\nBlood Lands\n\nSignet Books\n\nPenguin Group USA\n\n375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014\n\nISBN: 0451218760, $5.99, 292 pp.\n\nLes Williams\n\nReviewer\n\nThe year is 1865. Around the town of Umberton, the Kansas Border Militia are part of the reason the area is called Bloody Kansas. At the farm of Harvey Shawler, Captain Ruddell Plantz and his so called militia soldiers take what they want from the dirt farmer. All the family are killed except young Jed who witnessed the whole bloody affair. Plantz can not allow the boy to escape to tell the regular army what took place on the farmstead.\n\nIn Umberton, Colonel Bertrim Wilder, his former sergeant Shepherd Watson and the colonel's daughter Julie bring in a string of horses to sell. The colonel does this in defiance of the captain's request that all pay a tribute. The three riders are spotted by two of Plantz's gunmen who are stationed in Umberton to keep an eye on the town. The two men ride out to the captain to report their finding. Plantz sends one of his men out to follow Jed's tracks. The boy is found by Wilder and his riders. The colonel refuses to turn Jed over to the militia man and instead, takes him to the Wilder Ranch. Leaving Julie to watch over the boy, the colonel and Shep ride out.\n\nAlong the trail, Wilder and Watson are surrounded by the captain and his men who gun the two down. The hard cases continue on to the Wilder Ranch to search for the missing boy. Julie makes the mistake of going out to meet the militia men. The gunmen, now wearing masks, beat and rape the colonel's daughter. Warning her to leave the area, she is left lying naked in the dust as they ride off. Bounty hunter Baines Meredith comes up to the ranch and sees Julie on the ground. He takes her in to Umberton to be cared for. When the gunman's business in town is finished, he rides off after other men with bounty's on their head.\n\nJulie, once she is recovered from her ordeal, goes out in search of Meredith. At the small spread of the bounty hunter, Julie learns from Baines there are many ways to deal with the men who killed her father and violated her. She also discovers a little about herself as well. In BLOOD LANDS, Ralph Cotton has given us a fresh approach to the west and the violence that often times prevailed. BLOOD LANDS grabs you from the beginning and does not turn you loose until the climatic ending.\n\nFirmin: Adventures of a Metropolitan Lowlife\n\nSam Savage\n\nCoffee House Press\n\nISBN: 1566891817, $14.95, 162 pp.\n\nZinta Aistars, Reviewer\n\nwww.authorsden.com/zintaaistars\n\nWho would have thought a rodent might be so entertaining? Yet we've grown up on such tales of humanized mice and rats. Why not a highly literate one? Even while the ever clever and articulate Firmin declares: \"The only literature I cannot abide is rat literature, including mouse literature. I despise good-natured old Ratty in 'The Wind in the Willows.' I piss down the throats of Mickey Mouse and Stuart Little. Affable, shuffling, cute, they stick in my craw like fish bones.\"\n\nPeppery vermin, isn't he? Such is Firmin's charm. Born the runt in a litter of 13 rats to poor, ignorant, inebriated mother rat Flo, he resorts to eating the tasty paper of book pages that Flo has used to make their nest, tucked away in the back shelves of a Boston bookstore. His siblings, who nurse first, have only disdain for him, and Firmin soon finds his own way in the world, maneuvering by story. From eating books, he evolves to insatiable consumer of books, reading through all the classics, all the sciences, current and historical events, children's stories, romances, plays. He reads it all.\n\nTo be a literate rat makes Firmin painfully aware of his odd place in the world. He calls it his \"vast canyon of loneliness.\" He suffers at his inability to fit into the world about which he reads, at his inability to express himself in spoken language. Author Sam Savage writes some of his most poignant lines in describing for us that vast canyon of loneliness in Firmin due to his inability to communicate:\n\n\"Despite my intelligence, my tact, the delicacy and refinement of my feelings, my growing erudition, I remained a creature of great disabilities. Reading is one thing, speaking is another... Loquacious to the point of chatter, I was condemned to silence. The fact is, I had no voice. All the beautiful sentences flying around in my head like butterflies were in fact flying in a cage they could never get out of. All the lovely words that I mulled and mouthed in the strangled silence of my thought were as useless as the thousands, perhaps millions, of words that I had torn from books and swallowed, the incohesive fragments of entire novels, plays, epic poems, intimate diaries, and scandalous confessions--all down the tube, mute, useless, and wasted... I laugh, in order not to weep--which, of course, I also cannot do. Or laugh either, for that matter, except in my head, where it is more painful than tears.\"\n\nSavage has created in such memorable passages for us a rodent that is so human that we relate as one life form to another, for all creatures, surely, have suffered such isolation at some point in our lives, unable to express what weighs most on our hearts.\n\nThe story of Firmin takes us by the paw through the bookstore and out into the streets of Boston, into the lives of various misfit humans, including the lonely science fiction writer Jerry Magoon who keeps the rat as adored pet without ever discovering Firmin's secret. If perhaps there is any part of this truly unique and engaging tale lacking, otherwise exquisitely written, then it is the episodes of Firmin's \"lowlife\" penchant to hang out at the old theatre, Rialto, into the wee hours of the night, sitting amongst drooling old lechers, even while openly acknowledging his own \"perversions,\" and watching what he refers to as his \"Lovelies.\" It is perhaps a bit too much for my sensibilities and suspended disbelief to imagine a rat so craving the human female species the way that he does... oh, shudder... but then, I suppose, that is what makes Firmin a rat, after all, and the men in the dark theatre gaping alongside him, eyes aglow, rather rat-like, too.\n\nRegardless, this is a tale not to be missed. It is a gem: unique, literary, smart, and surprisingly moving.\n\nAtwood's Bookshelf\n\nSinging Cowboys and Musical Mountaineers: Southern Culture and the Roots of Country Music\n\nBill C. Malone\n\nThe University of Georgia Press\n\nAthens, Georgia 30602\n\nISBN: 0820325511, $15.95, 155 pp.\n\nWhen it comes to tracing the roots of American music, there's just no place like the South: jazz, rhythm & blues, rock & roll, gospel - most music that comes with a \"made in America\" stamp originated south of the Mason-Dixon line. While the world obviously owes a huge musical debt to African-Americans for their contributions in the aforementioned genres, what we now call \"Country\" music primarily evolved from the souls and throats of white rural southerners. It is these singers - and their songs - that are the focus of Bill C. Malone's \"Singing Cowboys and Musical Mountaineers.\"\n\nMalone's first concern is to precisely define white rural southern music, especially that which was sung in the 19th century South (just before this music was discovered by the rest of the world). Was it - as early 20th century British musicologist Cecil Sharpe wanted to believe - merely a twangy re-definition of ancient British ballads? Sharpe collected hundreds of Appalachian songs that were clearly traceable to the British Isles, but as Malone points out in \"Singing Cowboys,\" Sharpe was in the South specifically looking for this connection. He found it in spades but because the other songs he surely heard echoing through the mountains didn't concern his thesis, he simply ignored them.\n\nThere was a lot to ignore. Country music has many primary sources, and although Malone claims that a detailed history of the genre is nigh impossible, he does a masterful job of describing most of its influences in fascinating detail. British ballads, black spirituals, minstrel show songs (most of their composers ironically Northern), German bands and hymns all had a major role in shaping the white folk music of 19th century America. Rural southerners were very catholic in their love for music: a good tune was a good tune, whether it originated in ancient Britain or at the desk of a contemporary New York composer.\n\nBy far the most fascinating aspect of Malone's book is hinted at in its title and answers this question: why did Country singers such as Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and Alan Jackson -- who all hailed from the southeast - dress as though they had been raised on a Texas ranch? Simple: a national hunger for symbols. Before the cowboy singer took over as Country music's mascot in the 1930's, it was the mountain man of the 1920's, romanticized by novels and the \"Great War\" hero, Alvin \"Tennessee Mountain Boy\" York, that exemplified an earlier, rural, unfettered Anglo-Saxon America for a urban North, heavy with European immigrants. It was primarily the Carter family and Bradley Kincaid whose performances first personified the free-spirited, pure mountain personality and their success paved the way for many other southern musicians of the era to cash in on the hunger for the quintessential American symbol.\n\nHowever, when reports of aberrant mountain behavior and oppression from coal companies began to trickle out of the Appalachians along with the proliferation of vaudeville acts that degenerated the mountain man's vigorous image into a caricature worthy of ridicule (think \"The Beverly Hillbillies\"), the cowboy - whose manly persona and limitless freedom was being popularized in countless films and dime novels -- took over as the pre-eminent and permanent symbol of Country music. The actual canon of authentic cowboy songs is much smaller than the amount of folk songs from the eastern south, but an image is an image and the singing cowboy is here to stay.\n\n\"Singing Cowboys and Musical Mountaineers\" is a very enlightening read regarding the roots of Country music and provides the definitive explanation and history of the connection between Country music [southern folk music] and cowboy hats.\n\nThe Pocket Idiot's Guide to Piano Chords\n\nKaren Berger\n\nPenguin Group (USA)\n\n375 Hudson Street, NY, NY\n\nISBN: 1592574599, $12.95, 185 pp.\n\nSometimes accomplished pianists don't have loads of extra patience for teaching, well, idiots. Not so Karen Berger, a pianist on the faculty of the Berkshire Music School. Berger's very enjoyable book, \"Pocket Idiot's Guide to Piano Chords,\" thoroughly presents the material necessary for a complete novice begin to playing from a \"fake\" book (a book that contains a melody line for the right hand and chord symbols for the left) with a large dose of patience and humor.\n\nThe book begins with chapters containing simple musical concepts such as note reading and rhythm before moving quickly (but not too quickly) into chord building, proceeding from simple triads to augmented, suspended, diminished chords as well as a whole chapter on sevenths. Since chordal knowledge is absolutely fundamental to fake book playing, Berger includes an illustration and explanation of \"the circle of fifths,\" an indispensable visual tool for navigating the relationships between the chords usually found together in one song.\n\nThe easy-to-understand text is dotted with very helpful explanatory boxes (in the tradition of \"Idiot's Guide\" books) with such titles as \"Practice Makes Perfect,\" \"Universal Language,\" \"Music to Your Ears.\" Each chapter ends with \"The Least You Need To Know\" - the summation points of that chapter's information. Appendices include a glossary, as well as scales and chord listings.\n\nA book that takes the reader from a simple five tone C-D-E-F-G scale to a 12-bar blues pattern in a mere 185 easy-to-understand pages is quite an accomplishment. \"The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Piano Chords\" really packs an educational punch and will be helpful, not only to those trying to learn chordal techniques themselves, but will also be of great assistance to those who teach these concepts to others.\n\nThe Year the Music Changed: The Letters of Achsa McEachern-Isaacs and Elvis Presley\n\nDiane Thomas\n\nThe Toby Press\n\nPOB 8531 New Milford, CT 06776\n\nISBN: 1592641229, $22.95, 246 pp.\n\nDiane Thomas' \"The Year the Music Changed\" is an emotionally moving novel that explores the issues of individuality, personal gift, loneliness and race all within the context of that favorite haunt of literary writers: the American South. But the South of this novel isn't the decayed Confederacy of Harper Lee and William Faulkner. Though Thomas has the southern atmosphere down pat when she includes it, the setting of the story is more one of time than of place. \"The year\" is 1955, and rock music - along with a young singer named Elvis Presley -- is roaring out from the land of cotton.\n\nThe novel, composed of a series of letters between the fictitious Achsa McEachern (a gifted, slightly disfigured and lonely 14 year-old) and Elvis Presley, begins when Achsa hears Presley's recording of \"That's All Right\" (Presley's first-ever record) on a \"hillbilly\" station and writes him a fan letter telling him: \"I don't know why you think you're a hillbilly singer. You're not. You're singing that new music they call 'rock and roll.'\"\n\nAt first it seemed to me quite a stretch, even for a fiction, that Elvis Presley would take the time for a platonic correspondence with a 14-year-old girl, but Thomas makes this quite plausible. The correspondence begins before Elvis actually becomes \"The King.\" He meets Colonel Parker in the midst of the novel and from that point on he isn't as faithful a correspondent as he was previously because, as he explains to Achsa, \"my life's like one big giant all night car sale nowadays.\"\n\nThomas obviously knows something about Elvis. The emotional truths his character expresses here - his talk about \"the Lord,\" his mama"
