        "text": "Twenty Years | One Shot\n\nAU!Bucky x Reader\n\nWarnings: angst\n\nYour heart was breaking.\n\nAbsolutely shattering. But he couldn’t know that. No, you wouldn’t ruin this for him. He was happy. Over the moon. In love. Constantly bragging about how amazing she was. How beautiful. How perfect. How sexy. It hurt like hell.\n\nAnd he was getting married tomorrow.\n\n“Earth to, Y/N,” he chuckled, pulling you from your thoughts. God, you needed to walk away. Cut the strings. Save yourself from any more pain. Any more torture. You needed to move on. “Where’s your mind, Dollface? You look like you checked out about twenty minutes ago.”\n\nInstead of a bachelor party, he’d insisted on hanging out with you. Movies, pizza. Beers. Bucky had chosen you over his other friends. Over an actual night out. He said he wanted to spend his last night as a free man with his best friend.\n\nFriend.\n\nFuck, that hurt.\n\nTwenty years. Middle school. High school. College. You’d been in love with him. And he was blind to it. Completely oblivious. He loved you, of course. He’d tell you that regularly. But he didn’t love you, love you. Not like you loved him. And you’d reached a breaking point.\n\nYou couldn’t do this anymore. It was too hard. Too much. So much pain seeing him fall completely in love with someone who wasn’t you. I should have been you. You’d been there through everything. Held his hand. His one constant, he always said. Yeah, old reliable. Always there.\n\nYou were done.\n\n“What’s on your mind, sugar? Really? Because you look all kinds of fucked up right now. Work draining you? You broke up with that asshole, right? Mark, Matt? Whatever his name is.”\n\n“Mike,” you replied. Yeah, you’d ended it. Because he wasn’t Bucky. He’d never come close. No one would ever come close. You hated it. Not like you hadn’t tried. Dating over and over. One night stands. Anything to drown the ache. The sheer pain of not having the one you wanted.\n\nYou’d made up your mind. You weren’t going to that damn wedding.\n\n****\n\nBucky paced. Anxious. Scared. What if something had happened to you? Had you gotten in an accident on your way to the church? You weren’t answering your phone. It was going straight to voicemail. Where were you? He didn’t want to do this without you beside him. He couldn’t.\n\nYou’d always been his rock. His closest friend. Family to him. Held him up when his mother died. Wiped his tears. You’d been there for him for every important moment for twenty years. And this was the most important one. You were nowhere to be found.\n\n“Ready?,” Steve asked from the door, noting Bucky’s nerves. He chalked it up to the fact that he was getting married. “She’s not here, Steve,” he said, a bit of panic in his voice. “She’s supposed to be here. I don’t wanna do this without her. I can’t.”\n\n“I think your bride would beg to differ.”\n\n****\n\n2:00\n\nIt would be starting now. He’d be standing at the alter. Steve would step up in your place. Bucky wouldn’t be alone today. He’d be fine. You on the other hand...not so much. You felt immense guilt. Sharp pain in your chest. But you couldn’t watch it. Him give himself completely to her.\n\nYou picked up your phone. You needed to do it. He needed to hear it. Needed to understand. He’d get it later tonight. Maybe tomorrow on his way to the airport. Paris. Fucking Paris. Of course she’d choose that. You’d mentioned it before. That you wanted to go. Bucky had jokingly promised to take you someday.\n\nIt seemed only fitting. Another knife in the chest. Another stab in the heart.\n\nHey, it’s Bucky. You know what to do\n\nYou let out a breath. Do or die.\n\n“Hey, it’s me. I just...I wanna say I’m sorry, Buck. I know you wanted me there. And I...I wanted to be there for you. But I can’t, I just can’t do it. I don’t expect you to forgive me. Hell, I wouldn’t. It’s a dick move on my part. Absolutely cowardly. But, fuck, I love you. I’ve loved you since the moment I laid eyes on you. History class. You had the blue backpack. Matched your eyes. You stole my heart when you asked for a pencil,” you let out a soft chuckle.\n\n“I never let go. I held on, hoping someday you’d see me differently. See me the same way I see you. But, life is shit. It never happened. And I’m happy for you. I am. Honestly. I’m glad she makes you happy. Rose is good for you, I guess. I don’t know. She hates me, but whatever. She makes you smile, so I suppose that’s a good thing. You’re smile makes me weak, Buck. Your laugh warms my heart.”\n\nTears flowed freely now. There was no going back.\n\n“I hate that I’m not there. You’re probably upset. Disappointed. I get it. I ruined it. You have every right to hate me. I don’t blame you. But you needed to know. I love you, James Buchanan Barnes. I always will. Forever. I’m sorry.”\n\n****\n\nBucky sat in shock as he listened. He needed to be inside now, waiting for his bride to be. He was stalling, he knew that. Rose was probably panicked. Scared. Maybe even angry. He didn’t blame her. He was having second thoughts now. Your words cut like a knife.\n\nHow long? How could he have been so blind to what was in front of him all along. Twenty years.\n\n“Buck…,” Steve tried to urge, but Bucky couldn’t move. He was frozen. “Buck. People are getting restless.”\n\nBecca came around the corner, eyes locked on her big brother. She knew that look. This wasn’t just nerves. Something had rocked him to his core. Something shook him up. She dropped to her knees in front of him. “James? Look at me. What’s wrong?”\n\nHe lifted his head. His sister’s worried expression pulling him back. He said nothing, just simply handed over his phone, playing the message back for her. Her eyes widened at your words, not surprised you loved him. Surprised you admitted it.\n\n“About time,” she muttered. Bucky looked shocked. How long had Becca known? “The whole time,” she responded as if she could read his mind. “It’s glaringly obvious, Bucky. Shoulda been her today. If you weren’t so dense.”\n\nCould he fix this? Repair it? Make up for twenty years of pain. Twenty years of pining for him?\n\n“What do I do?,” he asked her, worry laced in his tone.\n\nShe smiled up at him. “You do the right thing.”\n\nFire In His Veins\n\nMickey x Reader\n\nFire in his veins.\n\nThat’s what Mickey felt every time you were near him. But he didn’t know how to express himself though, so he kept it to himself. That ache, that yearning. That drive and need for you. He’d just keep it close to the chest because deep down he knew you didn’t feel the same.\n\nHe watched. You swayed to the music. The bass was loud, thrumming. He couldn’t make out any actual words, not that it mattered. All he could focus on was you. The way your hips moved. Lips parted just a bit. The man behind you had his hands on you and Mickey saw red. He wanted you, didn’t want to see you with someone else.\n\nHe had to have his way.\n\nHe sat his beer down and stalked toward you. Time to throw caution to the wind, time to stake his claim. Tonight would change everything, that he was sure of. A wave of courage - just a little one - was all he needed. “Hey,” he breathed in your ear before locking eyes with the man behind you. A get lost look in his eyes.\n\n“Mickey,” you shook your head. Fuck, what was he doing. You didn’t want him. Did you? “Just wanna make sure you’re dancing with someone you know, sweetheart. Not some stranger. Yeah? Dance with me?” You nodded and he grinned, gently gripping your hips. This was it. This was his chance, his moment.\n\nThe beat slowed, so did you. Your hips swaying slowly, made Mickey’s mind race, go to every dirty place imaginable. He wanted to feel you, so he moved behind, not letting go. “Keep moving,” he whispered, lips pressed against your ear, the hot breath making you shiver. “Mickey,” you breathed and he chuckled.\n\nThis was what he’d wanted.\n\n“Come on.”\n\nHe held out a hand and you took it, letting him lead you away from the dance floor, finding a somewhat quiet corner. He had you pinned against the wall, heavy breath on your neck. “Wanted this for so long,” he panted. He was on fire for you. You could feel him through the thin pants he wore. And he knew it. “You want it.”\n\nYou nodded.\n\nHe lifted the skirt of your dress and immediately pushed two fingers inside. “Need to know how you feel,” he panted. “So wet, so ready.” You nodded again, barely able to form a coherent word. “Gotta get you ready,” he whispered, his lips a breath away from yours. “Gotta get you ready for me.” You were panting, nearly in tears as he reached deeper, fingers brushing over that spot. He had you.\n\n“Baby, come.”\n\nThat was all you needed. Soaking his fingers with your release. “Good girl. So good for me.” He fumbled with his zipper, releasing himself and pushed into your waiting heat without a warning. “God, baby,” he panted, “you’re so wet. So hot. That all for me? Did I get you that hot and bothered?” You nodded, eyes screwed shut, biting down on your bottom lip.\n\n“Eyes open, sweetheart. I wanna see your face when I make you fall apart.”\n\nAbsolute fire in Mickey’s veins.\n\nOn fire for you.\n\nHe wanted to blow, but he needed to hold out just a bit longer. He wanted you to come again, he wanted to see the look on your face, the fire in your eyes. Wanted to hear every little moan and whimper. Every time you begged for just a little more. He wanted to give you everything. Wanted to give it all to you.\n\nYou came again, squeezing the life out of him, making him wince. It was too good, too perfect. The ultimate high. Mickey wanted to weep, he’d never felt anything as good as you. No one had ever made him feel like this before, the way you fit him perfectly. Like you were made for him. And he was sure that you were. How long had he wanted this? Wanted you?\n\n“Mickey. Come.”\n\nThat was it, that’s what he needed. The whine in your voice, the way your face was screwed up in absolute pleasure. He knew you’d come again, he could feel your walls clenching, he could feel you were so close to letting go again. “Baby, fuck!,” he cried out, fingers gripping your hips hard enough to leave bruises. Hard enough to mark you up.\n\n“Oh fuck, sweetheart,” he whined, feeling you let go a third time, pushing him into his own orgasm. Harder, stronger, more powerful than he’d had in so long. Like you were absolutely meant for him. “Baby, god,” he panted, his head resting on your shoulder, as you both came down from your highs. “How long?,” you asked and he looked up at you. “How long, Mickey?”\n\nHe grinned.\n\n“Too long, sweetheart. Too damn long.”\n\nLevels of bad, from light bad to worst ! Is there levels of good ? Oh Fin’s “my” partner, I’m sure he’s an amazing mentor ! He’s so experimented. Upper East Side, rich rapist so. All of them are bags of shit though ! Fin Tutola experimented and knowing practical places, one of the best !\n\nYou took a hard elbow to the ribs that left you momentarily stunned before you hauled the suspect to the ground….and he pulled you down with him. Into the pile of garbage bags. Then more scuffling, which broke open some of those garbage bags.\n\n“I” arrested him but now “I’m” full of dirt, but the most important is that “I” arrested a rapist ! Ya bet “I’m” want to throw up “my” food because of the smell.\n\nFin thought it was hilarious, and he alternated between laughing and gagging at the smell the entire ride back to the precinct.\n\nThis isn’t really nice Fin ! How “my” dad can go worse than diving in trash ? Oh stupid “me”, “I” let spare clothes at home… Oh I feel like there’s something wrong with the gym clothes too haha.\n\nYou had never felt such desire – probably because you had developed early, and could hardly remember what it was like to not navigate the world with larger breasts while drawing unwanted attention from men.\n\nNever understood the thing people have for big breasts like they’re always staring at it and make a big deal out of it. I mean I say it as someone with big breasts and I never understood that obsession of people, men especially, for big breasts, as if it was something unusual…\n\nThe day was nearly over, and you didn’t have court or anything public-facing. You just had to run out the clock at your desk.\n\nThank god, because with gym clothes, no one would have listen to “me” seriously. Oh god, that gym t-shirt, everything to accentuate “my” boobs, great…\n\nin a t-shirt with picture of a box on the front, and the legend “Schrödinger did it for the pussy” writ large across your chest.\n\nOH MY GOD ! 😂😂😂😂😂\n\nBut maybe no one would notice.\n\nNot sure that “I’ll” be that lucky unfortunately !\n\nAmanda gave a low whistle, which made Sonny’s head swivel around to follow her gaze. To land on you. More specifically, to land on your chest.\n\nJesus fucking Christ Amanda Rollins… For sure he’s not looking at “my” eyes… Sonny is embarrassed and Amanda in high spirits. Will be an amazing end of the day ! Awww “I” have a cat !!! I feel the thing of feeling like a teen even if you’re an adult, I have that feeling a lot.\n\nYou looked up but refused to quite meet his gaze – you had a small infatuation for the man, and the coolly professional vibe you had been trying to put out there was effectively dead now.\n\nSo dead, in “my” embarrassment… Awww he lends “me” his hoodie. That’s cute. He also thinks about people that could harass “me” while “I” go back home in the subway. He’s protective.\n\n“No rush.” He reached up and rubbed his neck again, and you wondered if he was aware of it. “It, uh, looks good on you.”\n\nIs he trying to make “me” understand something ?\n\nHe said it was clean, but it smelled like Sonny.\n\nWell it’s better that it smells Sonny than smelling garbage. Oh Sonny & Amanda whispering over “me”… So, Sonny’s got a thing for “me”. Is Amanda really laughing at “us” now ? Oh “we” do live in the same neighborhood ! And for once Amanda had a good idea. Better than imitating a teen in high school. Just Sonny & “me” in a car.\n\nSmall talk in the car. Poor Sonny, in a cold river during one of the coldest months of the year… Ooooh car-pool for going to work. This will get “us” closer and closer.\n\nAnd “I” win a sweatshirt smelling like Dominick Carisi, this day doesn’t end that bad !"
