This is a big deal, because he has never spent any time away from home.\"Camp Welcome\" is very diverse, a place where all are welcome. In reality, the campers are different animals -- and they all get along. In the process of being away from home, Stover will experience many new things, including a bout with homesickness. He will also get a chance to try challenging, fun activities, and as his time away from home progresses, he will begin to understand himself and others better. A delightfully original and fully entertaining picture book for children of any age, \"Stover Goes to Camp\" also includes Life-Skills questions that will lead to further discussion of what it's like to leave home for the first time. While very highly recommended, especially for family, daycare center, preschool, elementary school, and community library collections, it should be noted for personal reading lists that \"Stover Goes to Camp\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $4.99).\n\nSilly Lullaby\n\nSandra Boynton\n\nLittle Simon\n\nc/o Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing\n\n1230 Avenue of the Americas, 4th floor, New York, NY 10020\n\nwww.simonandschuster.com/kids\n\n9781534452824, $5.99, Board Book, 16pp, www.amazon.com\n\nIn Silly Lullaby (Sandra Boynton's board book for children ages 1-5), saying goodnight all starts with the big bear observing to the little bear in the red footie pajamas: \"Your pajamas are on.

But danger has never stopped these two before - not even when it comes in the form of a deadly Chinese Tong determined to extend its opium empire as far as the east coast. With the help of Captain Richard Hunt, a British agent from Jamaica, all they have to do is bring down the Tong - and its murderous criminal ally Milo Traeger. This time, in his latest novel \"Two Guns West\", author Neil Hunter has written what could arguably be described as a mystery set in the San Francisco of the Old West. A solid, page-turner of an entertainment from cover to cover, this large print edition of \"Two Guns West\" is a fully endorsed and highly recommended addition to both personal reading lists and community library Western Fiction collections.\n\nAndy Jordan\n\nReviewer\n\nAnn Evans' Bookshelf\n\nBody Broker\n\nDaniel M. Ford\n\nSanta Fe Writer's Project\n\nhttps://sfwp.com\n\n9781939650993, $14.95 PB, $8.99 Kindle, 255pp, www.amazon.com\n\nBody Broker is a fun read if you like stories narrated by eccentric private detectives. Popular literature is full of them, and lots of my friends have read dozens.\n\nThe story doesn't bear much analysis. I got hung up wondering how an obsessive body-builder healthnut would not go to the doctor when his ribs were broken, but Jack Dixon is a superhero, not to be judged by our standards. We long ago got used to wise-ass PIs living on the equivalent of Jack's peanut butter and apples with the occasional glass of milk and a carrot, and beating up people with his bare hands, then the next day doing it again, even with those broken ribs. (Probably broken, you'd have to visit a doctor to know for sure.) James Bond did that sort of thing all the time.\n\nBesides Jack Dixon, the story involves depraved rich people, drugs, a troubled teenager, a seductive but treacherous woman, white supremacy, a frantic mother, a good cop, a houseboat, and more - the standard set of disparate players in a noir detective genre that goes back to Mickey Spillane. The settings are in a world where ordinary peole don't live, either more luxurious or more depraved.\n\nOur fella gets himself into some scary scrapes - going alone into the heart of evil, breaking the law right and left, and doing stupid shit like leaving critical evidence in his car in the parking lot and coming to a gun fight with a knife, but that's all part of the formula to put the reader's adrenalin to work.\n\nHis metaphors are clunky, \"my voice sounded like a quarter ton of gravel had just been blown through my esophagus,\" for example. How do you like that one? Maybe I'm wrong; maybe it's great. Metaphors are a matter of personal taste.\n\nAround page 150, just as Jack's self abuse has begun to wear on the reader, the story gets interesting.\n\nIn the end, the reader is not sure what indignities Jack has suffered that made him such a self-described \"screw up,\" with so much \"self loathing,\" but for this type of formula literature, do we need to know? The unresolved questions will recede quickly.\n\nThere are detective stories with greater literary value, but who cares. Just enjoy it.\n\n50 Miles\n\nSheryl St. Germain\n\nEtruscan Press\n\nhttps://etruscanpress.org\n\n9780999753446, $17.00, PB, 198pp, www.amazon.com\n\nIf I had to choose one category of book to read, it would be prose written by poets. Poets are forced into brevity and mine deep meaning in every syllable to get a worthy point across. When they carry that skill into a longer work, it is thrilling. Patrick Lane's What the Stones Remember is one such long lush banquet, and Sheryl St. Germain's 50 Miles is another. Delight in a couple of excerpts:\n\nI can feel myself back to the falls, kneeling, cupping my hands and dipping them into the water that rushes like arterial blood from the wound in its ice-white skin.\n\nThat's the mystery of fog, as anyone who's attempted to drive in it knows, that it does not respond as darkness does to light, by opening up a way, but rather just reveals more of itself. The powers of light are not useful in fog.\n\nThe story told in 50 Miles is presented as a series of essays by a mother, St. Germain, whose son, Gray, dies of a drug overdose. The reader knows from the outset that Gray will die, but the essays are presented in the time frame during which she is trying to save him.\n\nThe book packs the drama of a spy or detective novel. It begins by acknowledging Gray's death, then creates the suspense by going back to the beginning and bringing the reader through the spine-tingling, unbearably dangerous twists and turns leading to the inevitable ending. 50 Miles is woven with a mystery writer's storytelling sense and the poet's eye for just the right heartstring, just the right nightmare image.\n\nGray is the scion of a family cursed with addiction and suicide. He is pulled into the downward spiral so familiar to St. Germain herself from the moment he enters public school, where the staff is ill-equipped to deal with him. St. Germain writes, Once a diagnosis of ADD is made of a child, that label tends to dominate, even though the child may be, like Gray, bright, quick, heartbreakingly insightful and imaginative.\n\nSt. Germain deals with the worry that comes from phases of maturation familiar to most parents: the kid acts up in class, the young adult avoids his mother, the teenager indulges in destructive behavior. Most parents, however, don't wake up one morning and realize the destruction is not a blip, a phase, it's now the way it is.\n\nThough readers may not be near death themselves or know anyone in immediate threat of it, it is a phantom that visits in our sleep, or a waking nightmare, a drag on our energies. How to live with that phantom is one of mankind's oldest challenges, and St. Germain makes a vibrant contribution by reminding us that one way to keep the past alive and the future touchable is through storytelling.\n\nHer essays connect things, the way poets do: sea stars with her son, spaghetti puttanesca with grief. When Gray dies, her essays are single short, numb, crammed paragraphs, conveying in their brevity the felt futility of words.\n\nPerhaps it is because I am old and carry a burden of regrets, losses, and unresolvable mysteries that this book so connected with me. Nobody becomes old without being forced into making compromised decisions, without letting others make decisions for you, without being battered by the occasional run of bad luck or the oppression of time. For that reason, young people should read this book, too. It is distressing that life will be cruel, but hopeful to know that people can get through it all somehow, and that the life that remains becomes precious, layered, funny, and rich.\n\nThen, suddenly, the poetry turns defensively prosaic with a long first-this-happened-and-then-that-happened chapter on gaming. St. Germain seems to have run out of the energy required to distill this subject into virtuosic prose-poetry.\n\nThe book concludes with a chapter on St. Germain's recent support of students struggling with addiction. Her well-informed devotion to the welfare of her students can serve as a guide to others witnessing the grief and seduction of addiction.\n\nThese final sections are so different in tone and content from the body of the book that they might be better presented as addenda. In them, St. Germain renounces her muse and becomes a mere mortal again. The sudden loss of poetic power comes as a shock and diminishes the overall effect of her tremendous accomplishment.\n\nAnn Anderson Evans\n\nReviewer\n\nAnn Skea's Bookshelf\n\nThe Far Field\n\nMadhuri Vijay\n\nGrove Press\n\nc/o Grove Atlantic\n\nhttps://groveatlantic.com\n\n9781611854824, A$29.99, paperback, 432 pages\n\n\"I am thirty years old and that is nothing.\n\nI know what this sounds like, and I hesitate to begin with something so obvious, but let me say it anyway, at the risk of sounding naive. And let it stand alongside this: six years ago, a man I knew vanished from his home in the mountains. He vanished in part because of me, because of certain things I said, but also things I did not have, until now, the courage to say.\"\n\nShalini begins her story on this serious note. But like her creator, Madhuri Vijay, she is a superb and fluent story-teller and the people, places and events she remembers as her story flows between past and present are vividly present and make it easy to forget her serious purpose.\n\nAt the heart of Shalini's story is Bashir Ahmed, an itinerant Kashmiri hawker of beautifully-embroidered Kashmiri clothes. Shalini remembers the first time he knocked at the door of her middle-class home in Bangalore and how, unexpectedly, her mother let him in to display his wares. Shalini, remembers her mother as being a stubborn, sharp-tongued woman who disdained the usual interests of young mothers:\n\n'Shopping? I could hear the slow, mocking smile in her voice.'\n\n\"Promise me, Shalini\", she demands of her young daughter after mixing with other mothers taking their children to swimming practice at the local pool, \"that if I ever become like one of those brainless, fat cows, you'll take a knife and stab me. Promise.\"\n\nUsually, itinerant door-knockers get short shrift: '\"Oh get lost\", my mother says. And slams the door.'\n\nBut with Bashir it is different. Shalini, who was six at the time, remembers how he laughed at her mother's caustic responses, cleverly turned them to his own advantage, and somehow managed to captivate her. On his occasional return visits he is welcomed, no clothes are displayed, but each time Shalini, too, is captivated by his wonderful story-telling. Eventually, because of troubles in Kashmir, Bashir seeks refuge with the family and is invited by Shalini's father to stay with them.\n\nLike any daughter, her parents' lives and feelings are largely hidden from her. She sees her father as a hard-working businessman, serious, loving, often unable to understand his wife's prickly personality and a little contemptuous of her lack of education. And she ponders the curious relationship which begins to grow between her mother and Bashir, thinking of it as a secret joy which she shared with her mother, and remembering her mother's puzzling behaviour and Bashir's strange anger immediately before he left the house for good.\n\nWhen her mother dies, Shalini discovers a crudely carved wooden animal amongst her clothes and recognises it as a gift Bashir had given to her (Shalini) on one of his visits:\n\nI carried the creature back to my room, and stood it on my bedside table, the very spot from which my mother had stolen it all those years ago.... I thought only of the wooden beast, sitting beside my pillow, and, out of nowhere, a huge, unbearable joy exploded in me. Just like that, the secret I'd shared with my mother was alive again. Looking back, I think that must have been when I decided to look for him.\n\nShalini's search for Bashir takes her to a remote Himalayan village in the turbulent northern region of Kashmir. She is politically naive, unaware of the long history of religious conflicts which still haunt the villagers. Growing up in a comfortable middle-class Indian family, she has accepted the class distinctions in her own life and the casual well-meaning attitudes towards Kashmir and its people:\n\n\"...we fell in love with Kashmir when we visited. It was for our honeymoon. We stayed on a houseboat, and every morning this old man would float up in a tiny boat full of these beautiful flowers. He would give us this handful, and he would never take any money for them either\".\n\nShalini's experiences in the remote mountain village in which she lives whilst searching for Bashir are very different. Like any stranger, Shalini accepts the way things look and only gradually is she made aware of underlying tensions and of he own misinterpretation of the ways strangers respond to her. Life with the family with whom she stays is hard, the village people are desperately poor, the climate is harsh and living conditions are primitive. She sees the magnificence and beauty of the mountains but they are bare, unforgiving and dangerous. And there are bandits, corrupt officials, random military searches, and political unrest.\n\nShalini believes she has made friends, especially with Amina, Bashir's daughter-in-law, and her small son, Riyaz. And she tries her best to help, but without knowing the reality of the situation she inevitably makes mistakes, and some of them are dangerous, for herself and for others.\n\nEventually, Shalini has to return to her former life in Bangalore, to with her memories, to live with the consequences of her misunderstandings, and to remember the people she left in the mountains and whose difficult lives she briefly shared. In the end, she considers the purpose of her own story-telling:\n\n\"I am aware that I am taking no risks by recounting any of this, that for people like me, safe and protected, even the greatest risk is, ultimately, an indulgence. I am aware of the likely futility of all that I have told here, and, I am aware, too, of the thousand ways I have tried to excuse myself in the telling of it. All the same, whatever the flaws of this story or confession or whatever it has turned out to be, let it stand.\"\n\nShalini is a complex and believable character and Madhuri Vijay tells her story simply and with great skill. This is a compelling and fascinating book, but hidden beneath the surface of Shalini's story is a warning. We are daily exposed to media reports of terrorism and of ongoing conflict in disputed territories, not just in India and Kashmir but around the world. It is easy to sit comfortably in our homes and distract ourselves with other things (like reading this story for example). Or we may try to help in some way. But without deep knowledge of the situation or first-hand experience of it we, like Shalini, may unknowingly do more harm than good.\n\nTim & Tigon (A Young Reader's edition of On the Trail of Genghis Khan)\n\nTim Cope\n\nPan Macmillan\n\nhttps://www.panmacmillan.com\n\n9781760554293, A$18.99, paperback, 335pages\n\n\"What are you going to do when the wolves attack? What about when the thieves steal your horses?\"\n\n\"You are going to ride to Hungary... and you are not carrying a gun?\"\n\nTim Cope's early meetings with the nomads of Mongolia convinced them that he was crazy. But his fear as he started his 10,000 kilometer horseback trek in the footsteps of the ancient warrior, Genghis Khan, was not wolves, thieves or the harsh climate and terrain he would face, but fear of his horses. His early experience with horses had been of being thrown from one at the age of seven and shipped to hospital with a broken arm. Since then he had been on a five-day pack-horse trip, had some advice from a horse expert, and had spent just a handful of days in the saddle. As he set off across the nomad lands of the European steppe with his three Mongolian horses, he was terrified: \"I imagined being thrown off, kicked, bitten and not being able to control a wild, bolting horse\".\n\nHis fears were not unfounded. Mongolian horses are known to be either calm or temperamental. Two of the first three horses Tim bought were of the latter kind - wild and temperamental. Later, in Kazakhstan, he had Ogonyok, who got spooked by the sound of his own farts; Zhamba, who kicked and bucked and annoyed the other horses; and Taskonir, who once took a bite out of Tim's back leaving broken skin and bruising which took a week to heal.\n\nHorses, wolves and thieves were not the only challenges which faced Tim as he set out to make a long-held dream come true. There were high mountains to cross, desserts and bogs, and temperatures which ranged from deathly cold (-50 degrees centigrade) to \"scorching summers where, it was rumoured, you could become dried out and mummified in a single day\".\n\nThen, just six days into his journey, two of Tim's horses were stolen while he slept. As so often happened on this journey, a local man rescued him, bringing back his horses, then inviting Tim to his ger (a traditional, felt-walled tent) for a drink of fermented mare's milk. It had \"a couple of blowflies floating belly-up on the surface\", but Tim didn't mind at all, because \"A man without friends\", as the man told him, quoting a traditional saying, \"is as small as a palm. A man with friends is as big as the steppe\". Time and again, Tim was to find that this was true. But the dog, Tigon, too, was often his rescuer.\n\nTim first met Tigon at a nomadic village camp on the borders of Kazakhstan. Invited to dinner at the home of Aset, Tim was surprised by two warm paws on his chest and moist doggy breath on his cheek, only to glance up and see \"two milky white paws vanish into the night\". \"He likes you\", said Aset, who had agreed to be Tim's guide for the next few days. But Tim was annoyed when Aset brought this skinny young dog who \"looked as if he might struggle to stay upright in a stiff breeze\" with them when they set off. He was even more annoyed when a few days later Aset declared: \"In our country dogs choose their owner. Tigon is yours\", then left to return to his village. Tim had no choice but to accept him.\n\nTigon, Aset had assured Tim, was a 'tazi', a fast, hunting dog, unafraid of wolves. But Tigon was young, and adept at sneaking into Tim's sleeping bag, happy that Tim would protect him from wolves. He was also in the habit of pretending to be asleep when it was time to get up. And, of course, he became Tim's faithful companion and won his heart.\n\nThroughout the book, Tim and Tigon share the dangers - and the food, some of which (\"freshly boiled camel's head\", for example) is a bit daunting. Tigon ranges far and wide hunting foxes and hares as Tim rides. He disappears and re-appears, bravely protects Tim and the horses by facing off a threatening stallion, and, at one point, herds inquisitive camels towards them instead of away from them. His ambitious chase of a wild boar, leads to an ignominious retreat from a whole family of vengeful pigs. He is all ears and tail on distant horizons, and he is a delight. Tigon, like Tim, has adventures. He gets sick, is kidnapped and beaten, is run-down by the first car he encounters, and gets trapped on a railway line. He is also Tim's comforter through a period of grief when Tim's father, back in Australia, unexpectedly dies.\n\nAs well as being a record of his friendship with Tigon, and of his own interactions with the local people, Tim writes of how he comes to understand the nomadic way of life and some of the bloody history of Genghis Khan's conquests. He writes, too, of the changes which Soviet control of many of the countries has brought to nomadic people, few of whom now live a traditional nomadic life, although they still observe many old traditions.\n\nLike all good adventure stories, Tim and Tigon share encounters with bickering guides, aggressive drunks, thieves, gun-wielding locals, poachers and police. They also survive dangerous terrains, a local war, and near-death experiences. Unlike the early explorers, Tim could use his mobile phone to keep in touch with his family, and GPS to help him navigate, except when both were frozen solid and would not work. He also speaks Russian. Nevertheless, the dangers, the personal learning experience, the chance to learn new things and the knowledge of nomadic life which he gained, made him determined to tell this story as a way of inspiring young readers to be brave, to be unafraid to take risks, and to have fun.\n\n\"This story is for you\", he writes, \"so that you can step into the saddle and ride towards your dreams\". But it is also a way of reminding himself \"to never stop making new friends or nurturing old ones and to never let go of dreams\".\n\nAnd How Are You, Dr Sacks: A biographical memoir of Oliver Sacks\n\nLawrence Weschler\n\nFarrar, Straus and Giroux\n\nc/o Macmillan\n\nhttps://us.macmillan.com/fsg\n\n9780374236410, A$39.99, hardback, 383 pages\n\nIn the early 1980s, twenty-nine-year-old Lawrence Weschler had just become a staff writer at the New Yorker. Having finished a book-length biography of Californian Light and Space artist, Robert Irwin, he was looking for a subject upon whom he could \"direct the sort of slow long-term attention\" he had lavished on his previous subject. Oliver Sacks came to mind, because Weschler had already established a rapport with him through correspondence about a proposed film of Sack's book, Awakenings, for which Weschler had written a preliminary screenplay.\n\nSo, for the next four years, Weschler shared a great deal of Oliver Sacks's life. He accompanied him to hospitals; listened to some of his patient consultations; interviewed his publishers, people who worked with him, and his closest childhood friends; debated with him and discussed literature, philosophy and Jewish mysticism; and he documented and commented on their meetings, phone-calls, e-mails and letters. After four years the two had become friends, and Sacks had become god-father to Weschler's daughter, Sara.\n\nSacks then asked Weschler to abandon the project.\n\nNot until shortly before his death did Sacks relent, and he then asked his friend to complete the work. And How Are You, Dr Sacks is the result, and its title is based on the very personal and caring question with which Oliver Sacks often approached his patients.\n\nWhat comes across most strongly in Weschler's profile is the conflicted brilliance of his subject. Sacks was a great bear of a man, an award-winning weight-lifter, a tireless long-distance swimmer, a man who could consume dangerous quantities of addictive drugs without dying from overdoses, and, eventually, a highly successful writer. He was also deeply empathetic towards his patients, worked tirelessly for their well-being, and was desperately determined to bring medicine from cold, symptom-medication based treatments to what, today, would be described as a holistic regard for the patient. He was also stubborn, insecure, prone to childish outbursts of rage and, as he described himself: \"a man of vehement dispositions, with violent enthusiasms, and extreme immoderation in all [his] passions\".\n\nLate in life Sacks recognised his own problem of prosopagnosia (or an in ability to recognise faces), and although he recognised people by their voices, posture, gestures and gait, this face-blindness added to his insecurities. And he was also in almost complete denial about his homosexuality and his thirty-five-year sexual celibacy, recognising it but refusing to publicly acknowledge it. It was this which initially resulted in his ban on the continuation of Weschler's profile.\n\nWeschler writes well. He provides a vivid and detailed picture of Sacks as a man and as a neurologist, a philosopher, a doctor and a friend. He does not skate over Sacks's failings and he does justice to his brilliance in the field of \"Romantic\" science (the science of the individual person) and the influence of his work on patients in particular and medicine in general.\n\nInevitably, given the time-period of Weschler's profile, there is a great deal of information about Awakenings, its patients, and the play and film made of the book. And \"The Leg Book\" with Sacks's writer's-block and paranoia over it, also features at some length. There is also much to enjoy in this book. Descriptions of Oliver's prodigious appetite, for example. He would absent-mindedly, and often, eat from his neighbour's plate. And Jonathan Miller, one of his oldest friends, remembers how food \"simply converged on Oliver....gradually you noticed that all the food was gravitating to his end of the table, where it quietly and systematically got eaten\". Sacks's twenty-one day residency at a writer's colony resulted in a twenty-eight pounds weight gain: \"He accomplished this in part due to the superb breakfasts and dinners but especially to the buffet lunches.\" Oliver gradually increased the number of his visits to these until he was \"coming down at eleven and staying until four. Each new group would proclaim \"Oh, Ollie, good! You're with our shift\", not realising that he was with all their shifts\".\n\nOliver's obsessive behaviour showed itself in his passion for ferns, for the Periodic Table, for cuttlefish, for drugs, for motor-bikes ridden at dangerous speeds, and, especially, for writing. Editors regularly despaired over the possibility of curtailing the flow of revisions and other additional material which flowed their way, even after a book was officially finished. Oliver's own report about one article he had sent to the editor of the New York Review of Books was: \"Oh I think he liked it, though I think I made his life more difficult by sending him seventeen more revised versions\". Other editors leaned to simply cut or ignore Oliver's excesses.\n\nMy only complaint about this book is that Weschler is so used to writing lengthy pieces for The New Yorker that towards the end of the book I felt I had heard almost too much about Oliver Sacks, and I wished the book had been shorter.\n\nDr Ann Skea, Reviewer\n\nhttp://ann.skea.com\n\nCarl Logan's Bookshelf\n\nRF Electronics for Electronic Warfare\n\nRichard A.

Anglin\n\nCRC Press\n\n6000 NW Broken Sound Parkway NW, Suite 300, Boca Raton, FL 33487\n\nwww.crcpress.com\n\n9781420088106, $90.95, HC, 302pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Growing local economies, empowering communities, revitalizing downtowns, developing entrepreneurship, building leadership, and enhancing nonprofits -- you can achieve all these benefits and more with a comprehensive and strategic revitalization plan. Chronicling the struggle of local revitalization as organizers move from trial and error to effective revitalization strategies, \"Promoting Sustainable Local and Community Economic Development\" by Roland V. Anglin documents the current transformation in community revitalization from market-based incentives to mixed strategies of public sector learning, partnerships, and community capacity.\n\nKnowledge about the field and what works is growing, but not always publicized and readily accessible. This reference surveys the breadth of innovative place and people development practices, presenting lessons and examples at a general and textured level, putting information about innovative ways to change, influence, and improve the economic development process within easy reach.\n\nDr. Anglin brings his unique vantage point to the topic; his experience as a practitioner and applied academic allowed him to see how community economic development practices grow over time in size, scale, and impact. He highlights the difference between what is now termed community economic development (CED) and traditional local economic development practice, specifically the priority placed on community involvement in economic development partnerships between the private sector and government. \"Promoting Sustainable Local and Community Economic Development\" includes case studies that demonstrate what has and has not worked in revitalization efforts, as well as how active public and private sector partnerships have been the most effective in revitalization efforts. A Resource Guide is included at the end of the book for readers who may want a more expansive understanding of community economic development.\n\nCritique: Exceptionally well organized and presented, \"Promoting Sustainable Local and Community Economic Development\" is an ideal curriculum textbook for college and university Government & Education courses. While very highly recommended as a core addition to corporate and academic library collections, it should be noted for the personal reading lists of students, academia, government policy makers, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"Promoting Sustainable Local and Community Economic Development\" is also available in a paperback edition (9781138379947, $56.00) and in a digital book format (eTextbook, $15.39).\n\nEditorial Note: Roland V. Anglin is the Director of the Initiative for Regional and Community Transformation (IRCT) at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. Dr. Anglin's career spans over twenty years of working in the public, educational, and philanthropic sectors. In all his professional positions, Dr. Anglin has focused on promoting economic and community development in and for marginalized communities.\n\nThe Lie of Global Prosperity\n\nSeth Donnelly\n\nMonthly Review Press\n\n134 W. 29th Street, Suite 706, New York, NY 10001\n\nwww.monthlyreview.org\n\n9781583677667, $89.00, HC, 160pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: \"We're making headway on global poverty,\" proclaimed multi-billionaire Bill Gates. \"Decline of Global Extreme Poverty Continues,\" reports the World Bank. \"How did the global poverty rate halve in 20 years?\" inquires The Economist.\n\nBut in \"The Lie of Global Prosperity: How Neoliberals Distort Data to Mask Poverty and Exploitation\", Seth Donnelly (a public high school teacher in the Bay Area of California, where he has taught social studies for nearly two decades) answers: \"It didn't!\"\n\nIn fact, according to Donnelly, virtually nothing about these glad tidings proclaiming plummeting global poverty rates is true. It's just that trend-setting neoliberal experts and institutions need us to believe that global capitalism, now unfettered in the wake of the Cold War and bolstered by Information Technology, has ushered in a new phase of international human prosperity.\n\n\"The Lie of Global Prosperity\" is short book that step-by-step deconstructs the assumption that global poverty has fallen dramatically, and lays bare the spurious methods of poverty measurement and data on which the dominant prosperity narrative depends. It is a carefully researched documentation that global poverty (and the inequalities and misery that flourish within it) remains massive, afflicting the majority of the world's population.\n\nDonnelly goes further to analyze just how global poverty, rather than being reduced, is actually reproduced by the imperatives of capital accumulation on a global scale. Just as the global, environmental catastrophe cannot be resolved within capitalism, rooted as it is in contemporary mechanisms of exploitation and plunder, neither can human poverty be effectively eliminated by neoliberal \"advances\".\n\nCritique: Exceptionally well written, \"The Lie of Global Prosperity: How Neoliberals Distort Data to Mask Poverty and Exploitation\" will prove to be of immense informative value for both professional economists and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in the subject. An iconoclastic and exceptionally informative study, while \"The Lie of Global Prosperity is unreservedly recommended for both community and academic library collections, it should be noted for personal reading lists that it is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $16.19).\n\nCarl Logan\n\nReviewer\n\nCarol Smallwood's Bookshelf\n\nCarol Smallwood Interviews Carolyn Howard-Johnson\n\nCarolyn Howard-Johnson, author of the multi award-winning HowToDoItFrugally Series for writers including USA Book News' winner for The Frugal Book Promoter in its third edition was an instructor for UCLA Extension's renowned Writers' Program for nearly a decade. She was named Woman of the Year in Arts and Entertainment by members of the California Legislature and Women Who Make Life Happen, by the Pasadena Weekly newspaper.\n\n\"[Carolyn Howard-Johnson] is an incessant promoter who develops and shares new approaches for book promotion.\" ~Marilyn Ross, founder Small Publishers of North America and coauthor of The Complete Guide to Self-Publishing.\n\nCarol Smallwood: I'll begin with your award winning The Frugal Book Promoter: How to Do What Your Publisher Won't. What led you to develop it?\n\nCHJ: Mistakes. I made so many promotion mistakes with my first book, the award-winning novel This Is the Place! Even with a background in publicity, marketing, and journalism. Not least of which were these two nearly universally false assumptions:\n\n1. Your publisher will assign you a publicist and all your book's promotion will be taken care of.\n\n2. Once an author realizes that she must take her book's promotion in hand, a publicist is essential and one book publicist is about as good as the other.\n\nNaturally, Carol, I had to share my experiences. I guess I've got that sharing streak that most teachers have in my blood. Oh, then there was that little thing: I wanted to share all my booboos and lessons with other authors so I applied to do a class at UCLA and they accepted. And, yep, there I was with tons of marketing books - none of them that addressed the special needs of authors!\n\nCarol Smallwood: What is your favorite way for poets to promote?\n\nCHJ: My favorite is, of course, that anyone, even the shyest can promote. There are lots of ways to do that and resources discussed in The Frugal Book Promoter.\n\nCarol Smallwood: What is unique about you is your belief that authors should work together to promote their work. Tell us a little about your experience in helping and sharing your knowledge:\n\nCHJ: Awwww. It isn't that unique. I studied publicity at USC (University of Southern California). It wasn't my major, but I had a fantastic professor, head of the publicity department there. He was a former president of a big airline. He taught us that one of the first rules of real publicity is that it shouldn't be proprietary. My way of rewording that principle is, \"the universe is so full of opportunity there is plenty to go around.\" My other favorite is, \"What one can do, two can do better.\" Thus cross-promotion is one of the best ways to make one's efforts do double duty. No. It's a way to make one's promotion efforts take quantum leaps. An example of how that works is a new blog I started. The New Book Review (www.thenewbookreview.blogspot.com) is something that takes me only minutes when I post a new review. Anyone can submit one. Reader. Author. Reviewer. After they've submitted and I post, they let their contacts know about it and that benefits them, me, and also all of the other authors who have ever participated on the blog. Submission guidelines are in a tab at the top of the home page and in the left column lest anyone should miss them. Following them exactly allows me to keep doing it free.\n\nCarol Smallwood: What would you say is the unique selling point of your book compared to similar ones that are on the market?\n\nCHJ: It's fun to read. And everything in it is based on my own personal, practical experience. Not pie-in-the-sky marketing principles. It also addresses the fears that many of us have about anything to do with marketing.\n\nCarol Smallwood: I know you have written other books, too. Can you tell me a bit about them?\n\nCHJ: Well, the next one after The Frugal Book Promoter: How to Do What Your Publisher Won't is The Frugal Editor: Put Your Best Book Forward to Avoid Humiliation and Ensure Success.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Frugal-Editor-Do-yourself-HowToDoItFrugally/dp/1505712114\n\nTogether they comprise the HowToDoItFrugally Series of books for writers. There will be more to come.\n\nThis Frugal book is also based on practical experience. One of the classes I taught at UCLA Extension Writers' Program was on independent editing. Between that and the query and cover letters and media releases that I get across my desk (I also consult) I kept seeing the same errors over and over again. It feels as if little gremlins were picking at the possibilities of these author's success. They often weren't big things, nothing a high school teacher would pick on. But they were instant tipoffs that these authors weren't yet professional or hadn't done their homework. That's a big disadvantage when these gatekeepers - people like editors, producers, contest judges, publishers, agents - have many hundreds such documents move across their desk every week. They may toss something that is very promising based on a bad mood coupled with an inane comment like, \"I always wanted to write.\" Think! One has one page (maybe even only the first paragraph of that one page!) to convince a gatekeeper to keep reading. I bet 90% of new authors use that writing line, and usually in the first sentence. And it doesn't really say much. So The Frugal Editor takes a writer through anything from first contact with a gatekeeper through final manuscript. Mind you, I don't encourage a writer to edit his or her manuscript on their own. I do know that the more a writer knows about editing, the better partner she or he will be for any editor, any publisher.\n\nCarol Smallwood: How long you've been writing and what made you get into the literary field?\n\nCHJ: I started my journalism career in high school. All the cutest, smartest, most talented boys were on the newspaper staff. I finally wrote the novel I'd always wanted to write when I got cancer and realized that if we keep putting off our heart's desire, we may never get a chance to do what we consider most important.. Writing is a healer. I've been cancer free since I started writing my novel - twenty-five years ago.\n\nCarol Smallwood: Who are the people most instrumental in your growth as a writer?\n\nCHJ: If I started naming names I might forget someone. Let's just say that creative writing is nothing like journalism, copywriting, or other kinds of writing I had done. Without UCLA's Writers' Program (http://www.uclaextension.edu), I may never have gotten that first novel published. Of course, I taught there after I took those classes and published. It felt as if I was passing along the love.\n\nCarol Smallwood: From your experience, what key ingredients do new writers need to succeed in the book industry?\n\nCHJ: Curiosity and a lack of pride. The false kind of pride. We'll never become great writers unless we have open minds and an awareness that we don't know everything.\n\nCarol Smallwood: Do you have a website where readers may learn more about your work?\n\nCHJ: At http://www.howtodoitfrugally.com there is a page for each of my books including my creative nonfiction, my poetry, my novel and more. But there are also lots of pages of information. Resources for writers and readers, a free article page, etc.\n\nCarol Smallwood: Are you working on new material?\n\nCHJ. I am always working on poetry. I am very proud of my most recent poetry book, Imperfect Echoes.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Imperfect-Echoes-Writing-Justice-oppression/dp/1515232492\n\nWriter's Digest gave it an honorable mention.\n\nCarol Smallwood: Do you have any appearances planned?\n\nAlways. My next is a Writers Conference headed by Kathleen Kaiser in Oxnard, CA. Learn more on my SharingwithWriters blog at:\n\nhttps://sharingwithwriters.blogspot.com/2019/09/805-writers-conference-announce.html\n\nCarol Smallwood: What are some resources for writers that you would recommend?\n\nCHJ: They aren't my own, but I do a \"Back to Literature\" column for MyShelf.com and love to recommend the entire site for both readers and writers. I also contribute to WritersontheMove.com blog.\n\nA book I always recommend to my consulting/editing clients is Tom Chiarella's Writing Dialogue.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Writing-Dialogue-Tom-Chiarella/dp/1884910327\n\nCarol Smallwood: Thanks, Carolyn. I'm looking forward to your future projects. I became familiar with your books when they were recommended by my publishers after their acceptance to help promote them.\n\nCarol Smallwood Interviews Hadley Moore\n\nHadley Moore's short story collection Not Dead Yet and Other Stories won Autumn House Press's 2018 fiction contest.\n\nNot Dead Yet and Other Stories\n\nHadley Moore\n\nwww.hadleymoore.net\n\nAutumn House Press\n\nhttps://www.autumnhouse.org\n\n1938769414, $17.64\n\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/Not-Dead-Yet-Other-Stories/dp/1938769414\n\nSmallwood: Not Dead Yet has contemporary characters dealing squarely with universal problems. Which of the characters did you find the easiest to write about? How long did it take to complete the collection?\n\nMoore: I say this all the time, but it is true: the process is so mysterious. For me, it isn't so much that certain characters are easier or harder to write as that whole stories are. I can look at the table of contents of this book and remember what it was like to draft and revise each story - which I wrote relatively quickly; which went through multiple revisions, sometimes in fits and starts over years; which I thought I might never finish - but I can't tell you why. The process is likely determined by a combination of how well-formed the idea was to begin with, whether I received useful feedback from a reader on an early draft, how much uninterrupted time I had to work on it, and many other factors related to all the as-yet unknown ways our brains operate. I just have to accept that when I start a new project there isn't any way to know how it will go.\n\nThis book took about ten years to complete, during which time I also focused on other work. Each story felt like a discreet project, and it didn't occur to me until I had most of them drafted that I might be heading toward a full collection.\n\nSmallwood: Do you write poetry or nonfiction? When did you begin to write character centered fiction?\n\nMoore: I admire poetry but I don't write it; everything that comes out of me is a sentence. And if I have an urge to write nonfiction, it's usually about fiction books or fiction writing, but I haven't published an essay in years. All of this is to say fiction is my literary home.\n\nIn my early twenties I started dabbling in essays, then I got an MS in journalism, and it was a few years after that that I finally decided to try fiction. I was twenty-nine when I started my master of fine arts (MFA) program.\n\nSmallwood: We connected through Michigan Writers https://www.michwriters.org. Please expand on what you shared in an interview with Midwestern Gothic: \"There's an austerity to the Midwest that doesn't lend itself to self-promotion.\"\n\nMoore: This was in response to a question about why there isn't so much acknowledgment of a regional school of writing of the Midwest as there is of, say, the West or the South. I don't have a comprehensive answer, but I do think it has something to do with the unassuming nature of (at least parts of) the Midwest. That's a stereotype and a sweeping generalization, but there are certainly aspects of truth to it.\n\nSmallwood: How do you manage to include humor, even absurdity, in difficult situations?\n\nMoore: It's just the way my brain works! Not everything I write is funny, but much of it has an element of gallows humor. It's something that presents itself early in drafting, as part of the tone and a character's situation or worldview. I like to say my life's motto is \"Laugh or slit your wrists,\" which I realize can come off as both overly dark and also flippant, but life is hard. You have to laugh at it.\n\nSmallwood: Do you find male characters more challenging to delineate?\n\nMoore: No. I don't think we're so different, really, in what motivates us and what we obsess over and what the stakes are in our lives.\n\nSmallwood: What magazines has your work appeared?\n\nMoore: Many literary journals: McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, the Alaska Quarterly Review, Witness, the Indiana Review, and others. Many of these are housed in and receive support from universities. I keep an updated list on my website: http://www.hadleymoore.net/disc.htm.\n\nSmallwood: What is your literary training, background:\n\nMoore: I earned my MFA from the wonderful Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College in North Carolina, where my teachers were Maud Casey, CJ Hribal, Erin McGraw, Michael Parker, and Steven Schwartz. They were all excellent. I was very lucky.\n\nI also participated in the Association of Writers & Writing Programs' Writer to Writer Mentorship Program with the writer Christine Sneed, who has been so generous and encouraging.\n\nSmallwood: What are you working on now and what advice can you share with those wanting to be published:\n\nI'd like to find a home for a novel manuscript I've revised several times, and my current project is shaping up to be thematically linked stories about the assassinations of the 1960s.\n\nPersistence is the key. Writing has to be work you would do no matter what. Publishing ambition is great, but artistic ambition must precede it.\n\nSmallwood: Where can readers learn more about your work:\n\nMy website is www.hadleymoore.net, and I very recently got on Twitter: https://twitter.com/HadleyMoore10.\n\nCarol Smallwood Interviews Mary Mackey\n\nThe Jaguars That Prowl Our Dreams\n\nMary Mackey\n\nhttps://marymackey.com\n\nMarsh Hawk Press\n\nhttp://marshhawkpress.org\n\nISBN-10: 0996991123 $14.39 pbk / $2.99 Kindle\n\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/Jaguars-That-Prowl-Our-Dreams/dp/0996991123\n\nMary Mackey, with a B.A. from Harvard College and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from The University of Michigan, is a New York Times bestselling author and award-winning poet. Maxine Hong Kingston noted: \"Mary Mackey's poems are powerful, beautiful, and have extraordinary range. This is the poetry of a woman who has lived richly, and felt deeply. May her concern for the planet help save it.\n\nSmallwood: Your eighth poetry collection, The Jaguars That Prowl Our Dreams won the 2019 Eric Hoffer Award for the Best Book Published by a Small Press. What are other previous important recognitions?\n\nIn 2018 The Jaguars That Prowl Our Dreams and my novel The Village of Bones both won a Women's Spirituality Book Award from The California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS). In 2012 another collection of my poetry Sugar Zone won a PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award for Literary Excellence, and was a finalist for the Northern California Book Awards. In 2004, I received a Foremother of Women's Spirituality Movement Award from CIIS, and in 1985 California State University, Sacramento, gave me their Outstanding Scholarly Achievement Award.\n\nSmallwood: The Jaguars That Prowl Our Dreams covers an amazingly rich, highly admired, varied and long poetry collection. How did you come up with the title?\n\nThe Jaguars That Prowl Our Dreams is not only the title of the collection; it's the title of one of the poems, which first appeared in my previous collection Sugar Zone. As soon as I decided to put the poem in my new collection, I knew its title was also the perfect title for the whole thing. Jaguars have a special meaning for me. I have lived off and on in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America for many years, including the times I have spent in the Brazilian Amazon. In the jungle, jaguars are the top predators.They are beautiful, huge, and powerful. The shamans of the upper Amazon have said that when they go on vision quests, they become jaguars who prowl through the dream worlds. In my poetry, jaguars symbolize a force that connects ordinary reality with other realities, which in many ways is what poetry itself does, particularly the kind of poetry I write, which has mystical elements. Also we all have \"jaguars' that prowl our dreams: powerful, mysterious things that hunt us down.\n\nSmallwood: Part One contains forty-eight new poems including twenty-one set in Western Kentucky from 1742 to 1975; and twenty-six explores the tropical jungle outside and within us with a quality of the surreal. Part Two offers seventy-eight poems drawn from earlier collections. Do you write other genres besides poetry?\n\nYes. I've written fourteen novels, one of which made The New York Times Bestseller List. I also write screenplays and have feature film credits. In addition, I write nonfiction essays and memoir, plus blog posts that give writing advice designed to be useful both for writers and educators.\n\nSmallwood: When did you begin writing and what advice would you give new writers?\n\nI began seriously writing poetry when I was eleven years old. I started writing novels after I finished my doctoral dissertation because I realized that if I could write 350 pages of literary criticism on The Darwinian Revolution and the Nineteenth Century Novel, I could probably write a full-length novel. Before that, writing a novel seemed like an impossibly long task.\n\nThe best advice I can give new writers is: 1) revise, revise, revise until you have made your work as good as possible 2) never give up. My first commercial novel McCarthy's List was rejected by 250 publishers. I revised it twelve times (on a typewriter!) and six major publishing houses bid on it. Doubleday published it, and it even got reviewed in The New York Times.\n\nSmallwood: Please tell readers about being in the 1970s Women's Movement and consciousness raising:\n\nThat's a long story - longer perhaps than any novels I've ever written. The short version is that women involved in the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-War movement became increasingly conscious that they were second-class citizens as far as the men in these movements were concerned. For example, if a women spoke up in a meeting, the men often did not listen to what she had to say or dismissed it out of hand. Feeling that equality should mean equality, groups of women banded together and began to try to level the playing field.\n\nI can't begin to describe all the things we did in this small space, but imagine living in a time when birth control was illegal in some states; when a woman couldn't get credit without her husband's signature; when you almost never saw a woman doctor, a woman lawyer, a woman member of Congress, a woman news anchor; a time when all the property (in most states) belonged to the husband and during a divorce a woman could lose her children; a time when LGBTQ people were persecuted and imprisoned, when African-American women were terrorized and subjected to Jim Crow Laws; a time when domestic abuse was not generally considered a crime; when there were no refuges for battered women, when rape victims were blamed for being raped because they had \"asked for it.\"\n\nThe women of the 1970's Women's Movement first met in groups to raise our own consciousness of these injustices and then went out into the world to try to change the consciousness of the American people. Right now, many of the rights we fought so hard for are under attack. I remember what the world was like for women in 1964, and I think it would be a tragedy if we went back there.\n\nSmallwood: When I contacted you through Cristina Deptula of Synchronized Chaos: http://synchchaos.com, you were in Brazil. What is your connection with the area which is so evident to your writing?\n\nMy connection with Brazil stems from my lifelong connection with and interest in tropical rainforests, which have inspired my poetry and prose for decades. I first visited the part of Brazil which lies in the upper Amazon in 1971, before the forests were logged and burned and before so many species vanished. I have returned to Brazil for repeated visits since, particularly in the last twenty-eight years since my marriage to Angus Wright, whose research focused on the environment there. I was in Brazil when you first tried to contact me, because my husband and I were attending the World Environmental History Conference where he presented a paper on environmental issues.\n\nSmallwood: What are you working on now?\n\nRight now I am working on two things:\n\n1. A series of prophetic poems about climate change\n\n2. A very funny piece that I haven't titled yet, but it keeps me smiling.\n\nSmallwood: Readers will enjoy Mary's website:\n\nhttps://marymackey.com\n\nCarol Smallwood\n\nInterviewer\n\nCarolyn Wilhelm's Bookshelf\n\nTaboo Tech\n\nJoy V.

Here is a \"rule\" the protagonist, Lacie, remembers when in a tight spot.\n\n\"...remember the course on Blending into Other Cultures, aka Undercover Coping. Among non-humanoids, acting lost and scared can work. On humanoid planets, find out what other humans are doing that you can do. Do it.\"\n\nLacie's parents have to leave her and she manages to cope with the help of what she learned in class and technology. Danger is close at hand many times which is often solved with brainy and complex solutions.\n\nI found the information from classes such as Blending into Other Cultures aka Undercover Coping to be believable. The names of the ships, security characters, robots, aliens, and planets were clever and fun to read. There is a character map in the back of the book (instead of a family tree) to help keep the many characters, humanoids, princesses, miners, families, and interactive plants straight. The ships and robots have personalities and can adapt to changes and grow in knowledge.\n\nCharacters are suspicious of each other at first as it is difficult to tell which are trustworthy. Being safe is of utmost importance and there is cloaking and traveling and secrecy involved. An energy net pulls a damaged ship to where it can be repaired. A school is a central focus, SAKAWE, and people with criminal intent take it over for some time. Students, however, are not injured.

Compounding those problems were economic inequality, a loss of common civility, and a failure to provide for the needs of returning warriors. By 2019, the fabric of American society was barely holding together.\n\nIn \"Selling Americans on America: Journey into a Troubled Nation\", Gerry and Janet Souter tells of another turbulent era that was Post World War II -- when a phenomenon called the \"Freedom Train\" reignited the faits of its citizens in a country that was riddled with dissent, anxiety and mistrust in its leaders.\n\nIn 1945-46 more than five million workers enlisted in labor strikes across the country. The constant fear of communist infiltration dominated the headlines. Returning GIs demanded jobs and housing. Government entities continued war-time meat and dairy rationing. Displaced Persons fleeing war-torn Europe poured into the country. Overseeing the chaos was a president nobody elected, coupled with a bitter, divisive Congress.\n\nTo renew citizens' unity and pride in their nation, a privately funded consortium of advertising, civic, and entertainment professionals created a product to literally \"Sell Americans on America.\" To help carry their message of hope, they assembled 130 priceless documents including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Emancipation Proclamation. Combined with a media blitz of songs, operettas, radio shows, and local festivities, the train reminded Americans that \"Freedom is Everybody's Job.\"\n\nCritique: \"Selling Americans on America: Journey into a Troubled Nation\" is a timely examination of a period of 20th Century American history that is directly relevant to our currently polarized politics and the animosity that condition is perpetuating in the form of a deadlocked federal government that, because of corruption produced by the Trump administration, is threatening the continuation of our democracy as we have known it these past several decades. While very highly recommended as a core addition to both community and academic library Contemporary American Political Science and 20th Century collections, it should be noted for the personal reading lists of students, academia, political activists, governmental policy makers, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"Selling Americans on America: Journey into a Troubled Nation\" is also available in a paperback edition (9781733969147, $21.95) and in a digital book format (Kindle, $9.95).\n\nDisposable Thought\n\nSteven T.

Or are they hallucinations at all?\n\n\"Disposable Thought\" is the final installment of author Steven Bramble's triptych of novels about technology & madness, sends characters both animate and inanimate on a sweeping adventure into neurosis, metaphysics, drinking, garbage, crazed artists and entrepreneurs, powerful furniture magnates, family politics, world revolution, hyperbolic intellectuals, and, eventually, into South Dakota.\n\n\"Disposable Thought\" is weird dark comedy that deftly examines one of the foundational pieces of U.S. modernity and crisis -- disposability, in all its concrete and abstract forms.\n\nCritique: Showcasing a distinctive narrative storytelling style that is as iconoclastic as it is inherently fascinating, \"Disposable Thought\" is an extraordinary and fully entertaining read from cover to cover -- making it an unreservedly endorsed and recommended addition to personal reading lists, as well as community and academic Contemporary American Literary Fiction collections.\n\nBurn Fortune\n\nBrandi Homan\n\nClash Books\n\nhttps://www.clashbooks.com\n\n9781944866426, $15.95, PB, 214pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: 16-year-old June is a corn-detasseling flag twirler who lives in a small conservative town in the early 90s Midwest. Her family is dysfunctional but her boyfriend (known to the reader only as \"My Boyfriend\") has a family who is emotionally and physically abusive.\n\nLooking for alternatives to the lives of the women who surround her, June becomes obsessed with the actress Jean Seberg (best known for her starring role in Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless) as well as Joan of Arc. After being raped by an acquaintance, June withdraws and begins to live mostly through Seberg's films.\n\nOffered these lives as alternatives to her own, June is left to wonder: Can anyone truly transcend their circumstances, or does having a dream mean death -- literally and metaphorically?\n\nCritique: A dramatically crafted and deftly thought-provoking novel by an author with an impressively genuine flair for originality and a distinctively reader engaging narrative storytelling style, Brandi Homan's \"Burn Fortune\" is highly recommended for community and academic library Contemporary American Literary Fiction collections. It should be noted for personal reading lists that \"Burn Fortune\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $4.99).\n\nClint Travis\n\nReviewer\n\nDave Smith's Bookshelf\n\nFamily Snapshot as a Poem in Time\n\nG.

The long poem \"Family Snapshot as a Poem in Time\" is demanding in the way of all puzzles but rewarding in the way the mind discovers answers. It is followed by a sequence of overt lyrics of dreamy walks in the moonlight. It makes a nifty counterpart to the long mystery title poem.

The authors describe the historical events in detail from inception to execution, laying out the intermingling of inputs from all the key players. They describe how the backdrop of cultural, social and political issues provided the grist for the promotion of the idea from its inception to execution.\n\nThe authors catalogue the input of heavy hitters from every field of endeavor who helped to shape the project, including government officials, business and industry entrepreneurs, advertising moguls and entertainment movers and shakers -- all of whom left their footprint on the final product.\n\nThe book strikes me as a sort of visual travelogue depicting the evolution of events encountered during some 37,000 miles of the Freedom Train's journey through the contiguous forty-eight states.\n\nFor me, the book was an interesting and eye-opening account chronicling the efforts of our national leaders to address the postwar issues troubling the nation's core.

At 13, he's saddled with a mother who prefers booze and abuse to actual parenting. He's periodically shuffled into new school systems whenever she bottoms out. The trailer park he now calls home is embarrassing. And the first three people he meets at his new school are bullying douchebags.\n\nSummer isn't looking much better for young Tim, given his mother's domineering new boyfriend. Thankfully, there are two bright spots this summer for Tim. One is the beautiful older woman across the way who knows her music and relies on Tim for babysitting duties. The other is the kid who just moved into the trailer park and reminds him of Elvis. Throughout the summer, Tim learns a lot from both, slowly figuring out who he wants to be. He makes mistakes along the way, of course, but he also learns valuable lessons that will serve him for a lifetime. All thanks to Elvis, an unattainable woman, and a trailer park.\n\nAnd Then I Met Elvis... starts off unassumingly. In fact, the opening thirty pages or so are downright unpleasant, really hammering home how miserable and terrible the protagonist's life is. But if you power through those thirty pages - - and you should - it transforms into a worthwhile journey toward adulthood.\n\nWhat separates this novel from many coming-of-age tales is that it is utterly effortless in how relatable it manages to be. Being bullied in school. Discovering those songs that speak to you. Taking that first step of self-discovery and rebellion by doing something you think is incredibly cool and other people find completely peculiar. Having that unrequited crush on someone older and more sophisticated that both gives you hope and dashes your spirits from time to time. Those moments speak to the reader on a deep emotional level, bypassing superficial cliches and connecting on a harmonic frequency you might've forgotten about (or repressed or simply put aside to process later). Bari makes those moments feel natural and easy. That is far harder, and far more rare, than you might think. Even the big story moments that you know have to come full circle - confronting the bully, for instance - don't play out like you'd expect. Instead, the scene is both funnier AND more satisfying because of its little quirks and unlikelihoods.\n\nWe all have those friendships and relationships that change us irrevocably when we're young, and yet they never seem to survive into adulthood. Instead, they are these islands in your past, brief maelstroms of insight and love and humor and struggle that become milestones. And Then I Met Elvis... captures that energy, that singular strangeness, beautifully.\n\nGlenn Dallas, Reviewer\n\nSeattle Book Review\n\nGrace Cavalieri's Bookshelf\n\nSeptember 2019 Exemplars\n\nAn American Sunrise by Joy Harjo.

Norton and Company\n\nwww.wwnorton.com\n\n9781324003861, $25.95, 109 pages\n\nOver the years, Harjo's built a body of poems that reveal Native Americans' spiritual history with lyrical insight and hypnotic magic. An American Sunrise adds richly to the canon. Inspired by lineage, we see power in the tragic. There's also joy and melodic moments that come only after delving into the dark.\n\n\"Memory Sack:\" \"That first cry opens the earth door. /We joined the ancestor road. /With our pack of memories/Slung slack on our backs/We venture into the circle/Of destruction, /Which is the circle/Of creation/And make more - \"\n\nIn the poem \"Cehotosakvtes,\" two women sing as their people move over the Trail of Tears. One in the front, one in the back, in their native tongue, this song: \"Do not get tired/ Don't be discouraged. Be determined, / Come. Together let's go toward the highest place.\"\n\nHarjo is the poet of authenticity, whose past combines with a poetic imagination to revisit scenes. The stunning \"Washing My Mother's Body\" is a five-page poem with thematic strands found throughout the book - a revisiting, remembering, rectifying.\n\nNever do we see a hardy people reduced to fragility. Harjo's poems are fables of what endures under the harshest circumstances. The family stays with honor. \"In A Time of War\" is unforgettable, highly charged, with an unwavering commitment to life from a place of rubble. \"Someone has to make it out alive, sang a grandfather to his grandson, //his granddaughter, as he blew his most powerful song into the/hearts of the children. //There it would be hidden from the soldiers...\"\n\nThese poems, read together, are prayers for justice, peace, and memory. Inspired by pain and - through rigor and the flint of poetic courage - they become testaments. Harjo's success is due in no small part to writing personal history from difficult circumstances. And her compassion.\n\nJoy Harjo is the 23rd Poet Laureate of the United States.\n\nFirst Morning\n\nFor Shan Goshorn, December 3, 2018\n\nThis is the first morning we are without you on earth.\n\nThe sun greeted us after a week of rain\n\nIn your eastern green and mountain homelands.\n\nPlants are fed, the river restored, and you have been woven\n\nInto a path of embracing stars of all colors\n\nNow free of the suffering that shapes us here.\n\nWe all learn to let go, like learning how to walk\n\nWhen we first arrive here.\n\nAll those you thought you lost now circle you\n\nAnd you are free of pain and heartbreak.\n\nDon't look back, keep going.\n\nWe will carry your memory here, until we join you\n\nIn just a little while, in one blink of star time.\n\n+++++++++++++++\n\nThe Grace of Distance\n\nMatthew Thorburn\n\nLSU Press\n\nhttp://lsupress.org\n\n9780807170762, $18.95, 84 pages\n\nA new book by Thorburn is a pleasure. His familiar voice is a smooth-speaking one which imagines the poem into being with some of the finest lyrics in print. Thorburn takes a moment, explores it, then turns it on its head with a new sensibility. Where he excels is in the patient unfolding of story where he lays a platform then slowly changes those thoughts to extraordinary ideas that shed new light. To read this book is to feel satisfied by language refreshed, sweetly composed with honesty and grace.\n\nBirds before Winter\n\nDabbing lather across my chin, I picture you: bent low\n\nover the tap, drinking from your cupped hands.\n\nYou probably aren't even up yet.

Flynn's poetic knowledge includes those two most necessary elements: originality and surprise. These poems are reconstructions from childhood traumas, and the hunger that moves us forward. But make no mistake, this gorgeous book is more than how to survive. Each poem is a compelling dynamic where language is shattered and rebuilt to convey truths that are haunting and beautiful. Nobody bends a lyric the way Flynn does to break the heart: \" Vulture, follow me up: here is the arm/ my mother held me aloft with (as//well as she could, until she couldn't), it/is cut free of her body now, pulled// away from her shoulder, away/ from her breath, as you point// your wing toward her offered heart, toward me - ...\" (Sky Burial.)\n\nConfessional\n\nI admit you haven't' heard from me\n\nin a while.

You were with me when I found that\n\nbox in the basement - opening it was like\n\nentering a room & having (at last!) someone else\n\nbreathe for me. No one, as you know,\n\nsets out to lose their mind. This poem began\n\nas a secret - not from you, I didn't know you\n\nthen. Now, it wears its shame like a halo.\n\nPlease, take it, rip it up, put it in your glass.\n\nWe can watch it dissolve.\n\n++++++++++++++\n\nThe River Twice\n\nKathleen Graber\n\nPrinceton University Press\n\nhttp://press.princeton.edu\n\n9780691193212, $17.95, 112 pages\n\nI don't know where this poet has been all my life, but I've certainly missed her - those long lines that float us through ache and love and quarrels. The only thing that parallels exquisite thought is the poem that carries it. Whether she's picking up dog excrement or tasting a bitter peach, or considering Mary Shelley, every word is placed exactly. From the stellar poem \"Self-Portrait\" these lines: \"... For a time I lived between two brothers - / one with a door of iron; the other with no door/at all ... Our mother was a black Singer/ sewing machine. Our father, a pair of red dice... \"She also can challenge language with its many disguises.\n\n==================\n\nA Rhetoric (part 1 from a six-part poem)\n\nOr how how we say what we say says everything\n\nwe don't actually say but somehow mean, even if\n\nwhat we mean is, frankly, very mean & not in the end\n\nwhat we thought we intended.

These sample poems from eight books are a portrait of the writer's life where we see a poet inspired by nature, history, mythology and societal challenges - passions centralized by authority and a learned background. You won't find confessional poems, sensationalism, exposes, or literary gossip because Wilner goes for big ideas and surfs them to poetic conclusions. Her poetry is introspective and therefore instructive, with images that shimmer, while the narrative voice makes its accounts vivid - every poem offers an atmosphere of care for the reader. Here's a life between covers, a life of thought, with the poem as benefactor.\n\nWingspan\n\nFor Tony\n\nHope said Emily (her life now\n\nversions in anyone's mouth -\n\nthe plaything of posterity,\n\nas we are shaken in the moment's\n\nlawless jaws, white and lethal as\n\nthe crocodile's teeth) is a thing\n\nwith feathers, but so few, so blue,\n\nand such short wings, vestigial,\n\nit was not meant to fly\n\nbut to abide, here, deep in leaves,\n\nthick in the scent of summer green,\n\nthe air dusted with pollen;\n\nnearby, the long drumroll of the surf,\n\nand there, under the sky's immensity of blue,\n\na scatter of feathers on the ocean waves\n\nwhere wide- winged Icarus flew.\n\n+++++++++++\n\nNot Only/ But Also\n\nAnne Higgins\n\nDuck Lake Books\n\nhttps://www.ducklakebooks.com\n\n9781943900183, $15.99, 67 pages\n\nAnne Higgins leads a life of poetry; and also, a God - centered life.

How do these topics make poems? What are we allowed to write about? Stellasue Lee is a renowned teacher of poetry because she shares her secrets. Every concrete fact of our lives is worthy: that memory - even painful - is a virtue for the writer; that each well-made poetic structure upgrades all poetry.\n\nThe book is in six parts and harks back to childhood events but leaves none without meaning that resonates. The prevailing thought of this book is how resourceful the poet is, wasting nothing, how each poem is like no other, how one must dig into the soul for the material, and how more human we are for each slice of experience. At times, Lee interrogates the world to find what she can restore. These poems have various social conditions in which to find a center. This poet has crossed continents of living and documents every step. Each poem is a unique guide.\n\nDusting\n\nI think I've begun to heal.\n\nDays pass,\n\nsometimes in whole hours\n\nwithout drawing a ragged\n\nbreath in grief.

These bright exuberant poems shake with a rhythmic center, energizing the page. Maybe it's because Miranda is also an artist and has many vocabularies. He explains his title in a two-page poem, here are sample stanzas: \"... We is the dance/that shakes and rolls/down city streets, /shimmies into markets/for fresh fruit, / salsas against traffic... We is home/carried into conversation, /about a crowing rooster, /a ritual, dancing and medicine/to cure what ails us.\"\n\nSo you can see Miranda's work is all about healing. Part of that points to our plights, turning them to lore just to activate the message. Miranda knows grief and loss. His poems know guns and knives - but seen altogether, the book feels like a force for good.\n\nSemilla\n\nI am the seed\n\ncarried by a bird,\n\nasking a sacrifice\n\nfor each mile I travel in its beak.\n\nI go without guarantee\n\nwhere I land will be a welcoming place.\n\nI prepare to root myself\n\nbury the most important\n\nbits of me, wait until I can grow\n\ninto melancholy\n\nforeign dirt's\n\nwhere I become\n\nthe distance I have travelled.\n\n+++++++++\n\nEyes Bottle Dark with a Mouthful of Flowers\n\nJake Skeets\n\nMilkweed Editions\n\nhttps://milkweed.org\n\n9781571315205, $16.00, 83 pages\n\nThis book is written from hard country, \"Men around here only touch when they fuck in a back seat...\"\n\nAnd other times 'touching,' can come from pain and isolation; and will galvanize the soul to life, and to poetry. Skeets' lines are sporadic, giving energy, momentum, suspense - sometimes utterances, sometimes imagistic, always impromptu. In this disparate style, we'll find the emotional range of longing, thirst moving into love-making, a rhetoric of danger broken into lines. We're always clear there's a master controlling this writing. Someone capable is in charge.\n\nWoven through the work is landscape, the geography surrounds a world of masculinity. The sex act becomes a wider experience beyond lust. It stands for humanity, another way to be, a channel where one can belong. This is the hard brush of despair. And Skeets captures it in terrifying, beautiful, pulsating language.\n\nA bar called Eddie's sits at the end of the world. By the tracks,\n\ndrunk men get some sleep.

She takes complicated stories and unfolds them with clarity and personal style. The outstanding Section Two centralizes on Peter R. Taft, the poet's great-grandfather, institutionalized in the Cincinnati Sanitarium for a mental disorder. It's believed that Taft (half-brother of President Taft) was wrongfully diagnosed by an unfair 19th century custom, without sound medical information. Letters written by Taft to his father were converted to poems by Stever and become all the more powerful for compression into poetic form. The letters, already lucid and concise, prove this was not a deranged mind. Corresponding letters from the hospital superintendent are chilling for their lack of psychiatric expertise and compassion. This book, with all its varied subjects, proves that every event is an opportunity for poetry.\n\nOne poem to note, section One is \"Worst Mother.\" It just goes to show that poet/mothers can't win. They give emotional energy and their kids would rather go to the mall. \"See, instead, this picture/of you as a child/with bare feet - /the one in which you have/cherubs wings, /gossamer everywhere.\"\n\nHand\n\nCell and bone\n\nmore servile than the elbow\n\nand more birdlike\n\nthan the nose.\n\nThin fingers fan out\n\nlike spokes on a half-moon\n\nwheel, or the toes of a balled\n\nChippendale claw.\n\nA hand can be a monastery,\n\nfingers bent in repose,\n\nor a slaughterhouse\n\nwhere nothing is safe.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\nALSO, ON THE BEST BOOKS LIST FOR FALL\n\nProdigal\n\nMichael.

The air quality here is great, and I'm fond of the landscaping of the facility along with all the variety of trees, plants beautiful pollen-filled flowers.\"\n\n+++++\n\nThe Poetry of Detroit Music\n\nedited by Jim Daniels and M.L.

What about the verse that follows? Do we ever think that far ahead? Doc Shear takes 12 of the most quoted scriptures and forges ahead to the \"verse after the verse\" in order to give us a more complete meaning.\n\nThe author's penchant for storytelling enables him to weave his personal experience into the meanings, of the verses, very much like Jesus did with His parables. This book captured me as a reader - I finished it in short order.\n\nOf course, this is a book that one will read more than once. Thanks John (Doc) Shear for a wonderful book.\n\nHelen C.\n\nReviewer\n\nIsrael Drazin's Bookshelf\n\nSteeldust\n\nKen Farmer\n\nTimber Creek Press\n\nhttp://timbercreekpress.net/index.html\n\n9780998470399, $14.95\n\nMany readers, me included, are convinced that Ken Farmer is at the top of the list of writers of western fiction, the top three, with Zane Grey (1872-1939) and Elmore Leonard (1925-2013). His books are very enjoyable. I read them all. He is a marine corps veteran, an actor with 21 credits such as deputy Kyle in Silverado, and the judge in The President's Man. He also produced, directed, and wrote movies. He won the Laramie Award for Historical Western Novel and also for Classic Western Novel.\n\nHis novels are easy and fun to read, the dialogue is western, the action in each book is pure western, there is western history in his books and lots of humor. His characters, both good and bad are depicted realistically. There is also frequent likable ribbing between characters. He is sometimes quoted by the fictional characters in his books. And, what is unusual for westerns, but fits right in, is science fiction, with strange things sometimes happening that a shaman can sometimes explain, and the visit to earth of a charming short traveler from another planet who is more than a couple of hundred years old, whose space ship crashed on earth, who is waiting for other travelers from out of space to come and rescue her. In addition to her unusual advanced age and her ability to pass as a child here on earth, she has some healing powers and can become invisible.\n\nIn this volume, \"Steeldust,\" two cops from 2018 are unaccountably transported back in time 120 years to 1898. They are six-foot eight inches Detective Darrell Ulysses Bone and his partner Inspector Loraine Rodriguez. They become involved in several adventures, including: A seventeen-year-old girl who is able to train horses by speaking to them who wants to capture a stallion named Steeldust. So, too, does a vicious man with vicious sons who are willing to kill to get what they want. The father hired several gunmen to help him. They murdered a family and burned the family's home. The two future cops meet Sheriff Mason and his wife US Marshal Fiona Flynn. She reads a lot and frequently quotes from classical literature. She is the "
