        "text": "Three-year-old colts Fusaichi Pegasus and Tiznow served as equine bookends in thoroughbred racing for 2000.\n\nFusaichi Pegasus was the star of the spring when he became the first betting favourite to win the Kentucky Derby since Spectacular Bid in 1979.\n\nTiznow, second in a maiden race May 11, five days after Fusaichi Pegasus won the Derby, won the $4.77 million Breeders' Cup Classic.\n\nFusaichi Pegasus finished sixth in the race Nov. 6, his last before being retired to breeding under a syndication worth between $60 million to $70 million.\n\nFrank Stronach of Newmarket, Ont., was a big winner in this year's Breeders' Cup, with two of his horses capturing victories.\n\nMacho Uno, trained by Joe Orseno and ridden by Jerry Bailey, became the early favourite for the 2001 Kentucky Derby by making the Breeders' Cup Juvenile his third victory in four starts.\n\nAnd Perfect Sting won the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare turf event.\n\nIn Canada, Scatter The Gold threatened to become Canadian thoroughbred racing's first Triple Crown winner since Peteski in 1993, capturing both the Queen's Plate and Prince of Wales Stakes.\n\nBut the three-year-old son of '91 Triple Crown champion Dance Smartly was third in the Breeders' Stakes.\n\nSam-Son Farms, whose patriarch Ernie Samuel died of cancer in May, was the big winner at the Sovereign awards honouring excellence in Canadian thoroughbred racing.\n\nThe powerful stable in Milton, Ont., was voted both outstanding owner and breeder.\n\nAdding to the sweep, Sam-Son's Quiet Resolve was named horse of the year and champion male turf horse.\n\nSam-Son Farms topped the Woodbine owner standings for the fourth straight year with purse earnings of $3,286,670.\n\nQuiet Resolve won the Pimlico Grade II Dixie Handicap, Woodbine's Grade II Hong Kong Jockey Club Stakes and -- as a 30-1 longshot -- finished a half-length behind Kalanisi in the Breeders' Cup Turf.\n\nQuiet Resolve was the seventh horse of the year for Sam-Son Farms.\n\nOther champions were Dauphin Fabuleux (1984), Imperial Choice (1985), Ruling Angel (1986), Dance Smartly (1991) and Chief Bearhart (1997, 1998).\n\nSam-Son Farms didn't make it a clean sweep, however.\n\nKiss A Native was named champion three-year-old male, beating out Sam-Son Farms' Scatter The Gold.\n\nKiss A Native won four Woodbine stakes and the Grade II Pegasus Handicap at the Meadowlands.\n\nPatrick Husbands and Mark Frostad repeated as outstanding jockey and trainer, respectively, while Cory Clark won apprentice jockey honours.\n\nThe big off-track story was the death of jockey Chris Antley from severe head trauma Dec. 2 at his home in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nAntley had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse and police were investigating the death as a homicide.\n\nAntley, who won the Kentucky Derby on Strike the Gold in 1991 and on Charismatic in 1999, helped save Charismatic's life after the horse broke two bones in his left front leg while finishing third in the Belmont Stakes in a bid to win the Triple Crown.\n\nThe injury occurred in the deep stretch, and Antley pulled the colt up shortly after the finish, dismounted and held up the injured leg until veterinarians arrived.\n\nCharismatic was saved and retired to stud.\n\nAlso in 2000, three Hall of Fame jockeys reached milestones.\n\nThe retired Julie Krone became the first woman inducted into National Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nOn July 4, Russell Baze got victory No. 7,000 aboard This Is the Moment at the Alameda Country Fair in Pleasanton, Calif.\n\nLaffit Pincay Jr., the winningest jockey in history, got win No. 9,000 on Chichim in the California Cup Distaff on Oct. 28 at Santa Anita.\n\nThe Japanese-owned Fusaichi Pegasus won his first five starts as a three-year-old, including the Kentucky Derby, and it appeared he would be the fourth straight colt to take a shot at winning the Triple Crown for the first time since Affirmed in 1978.\n\nFusaichi Pegasus, however, finished second to Red Bullet, owned by Stronach, in the Preakness.\n\nFusaichi Pegaus, trained Neil Drysdale and ridden by Kent Desormeaux, missed the Belmont Stakes because of a minor foot problem and didn't race again until he won the Jerome Handicap on Sept. 23 at Belmont Park.\n\nHe next raced in the Breeders' Cup Classic.\n\nRed Bullet also skipped the Belmont, won by Commendable.\n\nIt was the first time since 1970 that the Kentucky Derby winner (Dust Commander) and the Preakness winner (Personality) did not start in the final race of the Triple Crown.\n\nTiznow, owned by Michael Cooper and Ceci Straub-Rubens, who died shortly after the colt's victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs, did not race as a two-year-old.\n\nThe colt, trained by Jay Robbins and ridden by Chris McCarron, won a maiden race in his third start.\n\nHe then had four wins and three seconds in seven starts, all stakes.\n\nHe ran against older horses in winning the Pacific Classic at Del Mar and in the Breeders' Cup Classic."
