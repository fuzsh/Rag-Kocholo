        "text": "“ Don't remember, huh? That's alright - nobody else did either. ”\n\n–Horace, Epic Mickey\n\nHorace Horsecollar is a classic, black and white Horse character who resides on Mean Street. He used to appear alongside Mickey in cartoons before being forgotten and cast into Wasteland. Since his arrival, he has become good friends with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. In addition, he and Clarabelle Cow have kept alive the romance they had before being sent to Wasteland. He admits to Mickey that he \"gets clumsy around her.\"\n\nMickey can take multiple quests for Horace throughout the games. Horace was known in the old Disney shorts to be a very versatile aid to Mickey, referencing his appearances in The Fire Fighters, The Barnyard Broadcast, and The Band Concert during his introduction to Mickey. In Epic Mickey, he appears as a detective.\n\nHe is voiced by Bill Farmer.\n\nIn Epic Mickey[]\n\nHorace gives Mickey some cases that typically involve finding missing items or catching thieves. Below is the list of cases:\n\nRecover Horace's Book: Speak to Casey in the Emporium, who will tell you go to the Ice Cream Parlor, where the player must speak to Paulie who will give you Horace’s book.\n\nDetective Mickey: Paint all the footprints on the street; this will lead the player to the cinema where Mickey will need to scale the building, thinning out the walls and using them to get on top of the roof. If Mickey painted all the footsteps, Shifty, the thief, will give him the book. If Mickey didn't, he will have to buy it for 50 E-Tickets.\n\nFind Dog Tags: Horace is in search of a Robot Dog. In Space Voyage, walk around the tram track and find the dog tag behind a wall of glass. Go to its right and enter the ball-like elevator pod. Use thinner to open it and jump into the machine. It will transport Mickey to a higher platform, where he can go up and place a TV sketch to activate a crane-like machine (this will transport him to a platform near the rocket, with a caged Gremlin. If the player releases that Gremlin, he can shut down one Beetleworx generator or he can give you 3 TV sketches; they cannot both be chosen). Then, go down and pick up the dog tag.\n\nDetective Mickey II: Paint and follow all the footprints from Clarabelle Cow's house to find Ezra, who stole her flower. As with the first Detective Mickey quest, if Mickey paints in all the footprints, Ezra will give the flower back for free; but if Mickey doesn't, he will have to buy it for 50 E-Tickets.\n\nFind the Missing Pirate: Moody's cousin is in Pirate Voyage. After filling the Paint and Thinner Pumps in the burning town, the player should notice Rigger Greene before the whirlpool, trapped in a jail cell. Thin the jail next to his, and free the Gremlin caged inside. He will open Rigger Greene's cell. Talk to him to save progress of finding him.\n\nDetective Mickey III: Paint and follow all the footprints starting from the back of the Tiki Hut to find the thief of a tiki mask.\n\nFind the Hatchet: Constance Hatchaway's hatchet is in the rafters of the library in the Lonesome Manor (thin out the walls).\n\nDetective Mickey IV: Paint and follow all the footprints from Louis's Shack to find the stolen candle.\n\nNote: When Mickey has finishes a quest and talks to Horace, he will give Mickey another quest before giving him a reward. Mickey may have to speak to him twice or thrice to get what he came for.\n\nIn Horace's Bad Ending, he is seen in his office sighing that he wasn't successful at being a detective. In his Good Ending, he is seen outside the train station celebrating his success with the citizens. He is finally seen outside in Mean Street, cheering with all the other citizens with the now-restored Cartoon Wasteland.\n\nIn Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two[]\n\n\"HORACE - One of Mickey’s earliest and best pals. He is a versatile guy, smart and a little full of himself, he is also a bit dense and stubborn to a fault. But beware the trouble doer when he becomes focused on a case...\" -Disney Epic Mickey Video Game Facebook page description\n\nHorace Horsecollar reappears in the sequel, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two. In the game, Mickey doesn't help solve any cases, but Horace does give him one quest to help him replace his assistant. After finishing Episode 1 - A Family Reunion, if the player talks to Horace, he will tell Mickey and Oswald that Tedworth is a not such a good assistant (he is always borrowing Horace's tools and asking silly questions about Blot Alley). Due to this, Horace will ask Mickey to tell him to leave. To make Tedworth leave, Mickey and Oswald will have to find the teddy bear pieces scattered around Blot Alley. When giving them to Tedworth, now Mickey can help him get a new assistant: Clarabelle Cow (as nominated by Ortensia) or Barnacle Jones. Barnacle Jones would tell you that Scurvy Pat has his compass and wants it back. Once Scurvy Pat tells the truth, he will give Mickey and Oswald Barnacle Jones' compass. If the player(s) give Barnacle Jones' compass to Horace, he will decide to let Clarabelle be his assistant.\n\nDepending on whether Mickey helped Horace, in his Good Ending, Horace gives Clarabelle a case book if Mickey lets him make Clarabelle his assistant. However, in his Bad Ending, Horace sighs sadly as he sees Clarabelle celebrating by herself if either Mickey and Oswald didn't get the teddy bear pieces, if Mickey gave the compass to Barnacle Jones thus making him Horace's assistant, or if Mickey thins out Scurvy Pat, for Horace will insult Mickey for hurting him and will not let him finish his quest if he didn't give the compass to Barnacle Jones.\n\nEpic Mickey: Tales of Wasteland[]\n\n\"You can't beat a dead horse, but you have even less of a chance defeating an equine who's as alive and kicking as private detective Horace Horsecollar.\n\n\"He made his film debut in the Plow Boy back in 1929 as one of Mickey's best pals. And even though Mickey went on to fame and glory while the forgotten Horace was consigned to Wasteland, he's way too cheerful to hold a grudge.\n\n\"Being a private eye is the perfect job for someone who's as much of a know-it-all as Horace, but when it comes to getting down to the facts of the case, we promise he's not just horsing around!\" -Horace's Tales of Wasteland profile\n\nHorace appears in the Epic Mickey: Tales of Wasteland digicomics, prequels to Epic Mickey that take place before the Thinner Disaster. He makes a cameo in Clock Tower Cleaners, but has a main role in The Game's Afoot and The Rubbish Cup. He is somewhat of a friendly rival to Oswald.\n\nGallery[]\n\nRenders[]\n\nScreenshots[]\n\nTextures And Icons[]\n\nDigicomics[]\n\nOther[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLike Clarabelle, Horace has appeared in relatively recent media such as the House of Mouse and various modern-day European comics. This, however, is a colored version of him (who may still be in the Toon World) - the Horace in Epic Mickey is the black and white version who was a much bigger star before color and wouldn't appear in any Disney media after the black and white cartoons (until Get a Horse).\n\nWhile it is possible a color version of Horace lives in the Toon World, in the Graphic Novel, Mickey does not even remember Horace's name and mispronounces it several times, so even this may be unlikely.\n\nIn the novelization of Epic Mickey, another version of Horace Horsecollar is mentioned, only this one is a dancer instead of a detective.\n\nHorace is part mule, according to Clarabelle.\n\nHorace has buck teeth in some of the game's animations, although he regularly appears without them in most cartoons and comics.\n\n[]"
