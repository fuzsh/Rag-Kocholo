If Thomas Jackson named his children in age-order in his last will, then his son William was born around 1740 -- too young to be buying land in Tyrrel in 1754.\n\nI have to finish abstracting deeds in Edgecombe Co., and I need to track down deeds in Halifax Co. (the indexes there are a mess), but I am starting to suspect Thomas' son was living in Halifax Co. after the decease of the Martin Co. man. This is all complicated by the creation of Halifax Co. and later Martin Co. where the border of Edgecombe and Tyrrel had been in the earlier part of the 1750s."
