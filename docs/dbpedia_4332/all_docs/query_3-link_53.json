Sincere thanks always to Mahavatar Babaji, Yogananda, Jesus, the Native American Church and all of the friends who have shared the journey. You are all songs in my heart. I especially want to thank my special friend Karen Thiele for inspiration and Jan Treecraft for her time spent typing my original manuscript. Thank you Tony and Barb Harmon, for all the love and support you’ve shown me throughout my life. Special thanks goes out to Diana, Dave and Shannon and Archie and Carol for helping make my dream come true on the home front. Also, Christian, Josephine, Judith, Boyd, Dan and Omarice and Mike and Leslie must be sincerely acknowledged, as well as Bonnie and Lyn for their loving hearts. I sincerely bless Acharya Das too, for his help on the computer and bringing this book to fruition. And I definitely can’t forget my mom; for saying, “Rob, you should write a book.” Thanks Mom, Dad and Joyce for your unseen help. Despite it all, I am still singing, somehow.\n\n3\n\nPrologue This book was inspired in prison. I wanted my son, long estranged due to divorce, to know the entire story; the why and the how that brought me to this place. In the process of writing, I discovered that I was really writing it for myself-to purge and forgive myself for the life I created. Sadly, my own compulsions sabotaged much of my life, allowing me to wallow in self-absorption and self-pity. Through years of laboring in rewrites, I have reviewed my life many times- maybe too many. The result has been a tremendous healing. My story is one of fall and redemption, of heaven and hell. It’s about the pain of loss and the cop-out path I pursued for so long. If you’re looking for something better than what you’ve seen on TV or already read, you might or might not find it here. But remember, the truth is always stranger than fiction. I couldn’t have thought this story up in my wildest imagination. Hopefully, anybody suffering from alcoholism or an overactive ego may find a ray of hope here. However, this book is without a hook; an inspirational memoir whose title alone will have to suffice. My lifelong dream has always been to pursue a lifestyle of truth, simplicity and love. The road to that goal hasn’t been easy, and I realize that I paved it all myself. I had to lose everything to gain a freedom I never dreamed possible, but it was worth it, every step of the way. Many names in this journey have been changed to protect the innocent.\n\n4\n\nPrayer Heavenly Father, Divine Mother, Friend, Lord, Beloved God-Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Mahavatar Babaji, Paramahansa Yogananda and sacred Peyote; I humbly bow to you all. May Thy love and light shine forever, on this, the sanctuary of my devotion, and May I be able to awaken Thy love within my own and within all hearts and bring them to Thee. Amen\n\nLife Path You were born on the last day of the last sign of the zodiac wheel and as a result have tremendous potential for an all-or-nothing existence. It is not an easy ride, in many ways, as you will be forced to confront who you really are and what you really want. There will come a time when you will be called upon to make a drastic change, and at this point it is essential that you follow your heart. Born on March 20, you are kind,\n\nunusual and liberated. You are naturally good at changing your life. You will make a very wise sage in your latter years.\n\n5\n\nSTILL SINGING, SOMEHOW “Before signing your plea bargain, is there anything you would like to say?” asked the balding Superior Court judge. “Yes, Your Honor,” I replied. I was the only one being convicted who even responded to the judge’s rhetorical question. Since it was my life on the line, I decided that I may as well tell him what was running through my head. God, this is all so heavy! My palms were sweaty, I was shaking and I sensed that the judge knew I drank last night. I hoped that I would learn the length of my prison sentence after speaking with the judge. My court appointed public defender hadn’t been able to shed any light on this subject over the past two anxiety-ridden months. He dryly stated that I could serve anywhere from four months to four years for this aggravated DUI felony that had gotten me to the present karmic moment of my pitiful life. “Whatever sentence you impose, Your Honor, I see it as the will of God. I am a very sick man who only wants to get well. I accept my punishment wholeheartedly.” The judge replied, “Thank you, Mr. Rideout. I’ll soon be sentencing you to prison in the Arizona Department of Corrections. I have seen a few men really change for the better in prison. Good luck in county jail until your sentencing.” Good God, how had all of this happened to me? How had I let alcohol take me this low? I had five years of college under my belt, traveled to nineteen countries, been blessed by holy men in India, had two marriages plus a child and, quite literally, withstood the trials of Job. Ironically, I was not scared out of my wits. I was way past that and ready to accept my sentence with open arm- praying that I could really change inwardly. I wanted to process and correct the many mistakes and wrong choices that had resulted in this incarceration. I saw that I must use this appointed time creatively, to look within and reflect upon what had put me here: 6\n\nabandonment issues and alcoholism, dysfunctional upbringing and rebellion, heartbreaks and my misleading hasty ego. After decades of spiritual searching and study, maybe prison was just what I needed to awaken from the illusion I falsely created and called “my life.” Maybe I would somehow find the inner peace necessary to be able to forgive myself for all of the pain that I had inflicted upon my son, ex-wives, and loved ones. After signing my plea bargain (which was some variation of guilty as charged) I was immediately handcuffed and seated, still wearing the new Christmas shirt given to me by my dear friend Lyn. I sat uncomfortably in the jury box, alone and bewildered, and watched while others’ lives went to hell. After a few hours, my wrists aching, I was escorted out the back door of the courtroom and taken over to the county jail. “Am I being booked again?” I asked the guard. “Yeah… and here is your new orange outfit, complete with Yavapai County jail stenciled on the back. Plus, you’ll get a new identity bracelet for your left wrist, with your own number and picture on it.” “My face will change over time, but this number will never change,” I replied. “I am now a convicted felon, like it or not! How long do you think I’ll serve?” “I don’t know, Buddy, I just don’t know.” This mad house …. I’m now doing my time in Golf Pod. All of the pods here have such classy names, with approximately forty-five inmates per pod. This is where I’ll stay, until I’m finally shipped off to prison. This mad house is packed! We have about sixty inmates over crowded in here, with fifteen more on floor mats. I soon found my space under the stairs and scored a very beat up paperback to begin reading immediately. This would be the first of many more books to come. Now I can begin to 7\n\nmentally relax and “rest in God.” I know this sounds strange, but finally the long awaited process of incarceration has begun for me, up and running. This is it… well, the beginning anyway. All the fear and anxiety of the past few neurotic months is behind me now. It feels like it’s sunk or swim in this present jail environment. Talk about being pushed into the unknown! Just walking into this room, with all these new weird faces checking me out, makes one a bit nervous. I’m learning to adapt quickly, however, as when I traveled in foreign countries. I’m basically staying to myself, until I can figure out all the new rules and politics here. And there are heavy politics here, believe me! Every day is a learning experience in one way or another. I know I won’t be sentenced to prison, Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC), for another month and that alone keeps me guessing. How long will I do hard time? Why can’t they just tell me now? Legal wheels move soo slow! Everybody here has advice and opinions. Everybody! And some of it really scares me. Thankfully, there are always many jailhouse lawyers to help figure things out. And everybody here has many things to figure out. Oh yeah. After a few days, I finally moved out from under the stairs into a room with two other inmates upstairs. However, I’m still on the floor while they’re on bunks. “Oh, this is priceless,” I thought. Thank God I haven’t lost my sense of humor. It’s one step up this institutional ladder at a time. Every day, after breakfast is passed through a slot in our door, along with a disposable razor to be returned, we’re let out of our rooms to shower and congregate- only to find another ten or more new cons asleep on the dayroom floor. They booked in while we slept. Many will bond out quickly, paying any amount of money to do so today. Many will return later for longer stays. We recently had a DOC SWAT team dressed out in black combat gear conduct a practice on us for prison uprisings; complete with loaded paint guns, face shields and kneepads. They looked like they were out of the TV evening news or possibly the Mideast crisis. 8\n\n“Everybody get on the floor right now! Hey you, longhair, get down!” We were forced at gunpoint to lie on our faces against the cold dirty cement floor, and later marched outsideto be lined up against a wall, execution style, for an hour. Some inmates laughed or made rude comments. “I’m calling my lawyer,” threatened one inmate. He was quickly handcuffed and sent to the hole, not to be seen again. A book cart comes by bi-weekly, and I scramble for any reading material. “Have you read Lonesome Dove? Here it is. Grab it quickly!” shouted another inmate to me. “Thanks. I’ve always wanted to read it.” Luckily, I have found some great thick books so far, perfect for prison reading. Down time is basically a time warp. As I adjust, I see that time now seems to go faster inside, than on the outs. Cool. Most of my time is spent on my bunk, flat out, trying to relax on all levels. The lights are always on here and the green, cracked plastic mattress is very thin and hard. There is no pillow. Everybody who knows claims that prison is way better than any county jail. I’ll be finding out the validity of this claim in due time. But for now, it’s time to lie back down and remember how it all began for me, with that “damn beat” of the Beatles. That “damn beat” just…. Music has always been my first love, long before I ever had a girlfriend. My mom loved music intensely too, especially the Beatles. To quote Mom, “that damn beat just drives me crazy!” But that “damn beat” that my mother spoke of, would ultimately lead me into a lifestyle of bars and drunks, pot and parties, heartaches and heartbreaks; all laced with travel and relationships. Playing music professionally would put me in enabling environments for the creation of a very self-indulgent lifestyle. 9\n\nThis lifestyle and mindset would persist for many decades to come and take me further into to the illusion of the ego. For me, it all began on February 7, 1964 when the Beatles arrived, attacking our American TVs on Ed Sullivan’s Sunday night variety show. This had to be one of the spiritual high noon’s of the 20th century. No crime was committed in New York City during that one hour. When I saw a picture of Ringo’s drum set, taken from behind in Life magazine, I knew I’d finally found my destiny: to play music and follow that “damn beat” wherever it would take me. This was my parents’ worst fear. My mom would repeatedly say, “Oh God, Rob.” That would actually become her mantra. And like it or not, I would hear that mantra many times in my life. My drumming career began on an upside-down tin garbage can, using paint brushes for sticks. Soon, I had an old wooden snare drum and a cheap Japanese cymbal that got beat beyond recognition. When I scored my first real job in the Malibu’s, I’d progressed to a full set of oyster blue Ludwig drums. I seemed to know how to play instinctively. I knew where the beat was and how to get there. I must have been born with rhythm. Mom paid for drum lessons but only one sufficed, as I could play everything already. Cool! So now I was actually making money on weekends, playing for dances after football games. And the times, they were a changing, as cheerleaders were quickly starting to notice musicians over the jocks. Yes! In 1964, most bands mainly played instrumentals. With the advent of the British musical invasion, vocals were becoming very popular, as were costumes. Being raised in Bellingham, we were exposed to such bands as Paul Revere and the Raiders and Seattle’s The Fabulous Wailers, Don and the Good Times, The Viceroys and The Sonics, to name a few. We wanted to be like them! I studied each drummer intensely, learning to imitate something from their style, as these bands played weekly in our county. So, with love and fascination for the Civil War, The Rebels was created. Our five mothers hemmed us gray woolen uniforms right out of the Confederacy. With our knee-high vinyl boots and Rebel forage caps from a Seattle costume shop, we were equipped for musical warfare and armed with plenty of new cover tunes. 10\n\nHowever, these woolen band outfits proved to be incredibly hot! We were drenched in sweat by the end of our first set. At this time too, razor cuts were considered advanced hair styling. I’d actually drive to Seattle, ninety miles away, to have my hair cut. My stylist, gay of course, cut all the famous Seattle bands’ hair at that time. Mod haircuts were the thing for musicians. You have to look good on stage and you sure couldn’t trust ‘60s barbers for that! The jocks went to them. In a local battle of the bands, The Rebels won big time. Our band, of fourteen to sixteen year olds, sounded great. The other members had been taking music lessons and practicing on their instruments much longer than me. We sounded much older than we were and everybody got a kick out of our costumes. Our young raw energy was pretty much irresistible, with three part harmony and cover tunes that sounded dead-letter perfect. With a college student as our manager, we played weekly for 1500 students at Western Washington State College, for months. Our fame was pictured and printed in the Bellingham Herald. I was now making over $100 per weekend- way more money than most my age and having extreme fun at the same time. I love this music business! I literally lived and breathed drums in my head at school, especially on Fridays. I couldn’t wait to be on stage each weekend. The chemistry that I was experiencing between the band and audience would become addicting over time, as would a variety of other things. We even played a few fraternity keggers in Seattle. Our microphone cords would often short out from all the spilt beer on the floor. And once, while packing up equipment, we found fresh blood on the floor of our rented U-Haul trailer. “What’s that?” we all asked. It obviously wasn’t a murder but something was out of whack here. “Another college virgin has been deflowered,” said a frat boy, while we virgins played on. After playing these gigs, we often frequented the counter-culture coffee houses in the University district. Here I encountered my first “fringes”- beatniks playing bongos and reading poetry. These folk, historically the first symbols of those to dropout, were paving 11\n\nthe way for the upcoming hippies. I was all eyes, as I entered these coffee shops of mystery. I also hung out a lot around our own counter-culture college scene at WWSC in Bellingham. Many of the older college freaks, who were already experimenting with drugs, told me not to mess with them. “You don’t need them with your energy. You are already there!” The same truth A Course in Miracles would hammer home to me decades later. If only I had heeded their advice then! My summer of love…. As the psychedelic movement was blossoming during ’67, I had Red Dog, my mom’s red VW bug and high school graduation gift, painted much like John Lennon’s Rolls Royce. It was groovy flower power done artistically, by two art-student friends. I now owned the first freak vehicle in Bellingham’s history. I proudly made my maiden voyage through Bunk’s Drive-In, to show off and revel in my newfound hip glory. “You do your thing and I’ll do mine,” was the popular saying of these times. How I longed to be noticed as unique. Why? My ego had already chosen the social archetypical role of the “nonconformist” artist or performer, unbeknownst to me. I wore my wide, black leather belt, holding up my bell-bottom jeans. My Beatle boots and polka dot balloon sleeve semi-pirate shirt made me hip as shit! Most of my classmates probably thought I was totally crazy. Who cares? I sure didn’t. I was the only musician in my class and everybody seemed to know that. I was different, no doubt about it. Just prior to graduating from high school, the Jefferson Airplane came to town, complete with the Merry Pranksters, the San Francisco Mime Troupe and their psychedelic bus, Further. Beat poet Alan Ginsberg, freak author Ken Kesey and speed freak legend Neil Cassidy, along with a lot of very silent actors, assaulted Bellingham for a week- a week I would never forget. This whole troop was all living legends. The Beatles’ Sergeant Peppers album had just been released and I was one of the first to 12\n\nown it, of course. Well, the Airplane somehow got wind of this news and asked if they could borrow my newly acquired treasureto drop acid to after their concert. They couldn’t wait to experience this classic masterpiece and I was instrumental in making their dream come true. At the concert, I was seated on the floor with my legs under the sixteen inch high riser. Grace Slick was belting out White Rabbit right in front of me. I was almost in her personal space. The following morning I drove over to their crash pad to retrieve my new Beatle record. There was the Airplane passed out on the floor. I quietly put my record back in its jacket and backed out the door. Were they asleep or was the Airplane still flying somewhere out in the cosmos? Boy, they sure sounded good last night and I hadn’t even experienced drugs yet! What is acid? Now the time was coming for this young free spirit to go on pilgrimage to the happening Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, California. My “Summer of Love” was about to begin. Mike, the Rebel’s bass player and also called “Toad,” from Kenneth Graham’s The Wind in the Willows, joined me on the twenty-four hour Greyhound bus ride to the pilgrimage site. We ran into Kathi, our old girl singer, who took us up to Hippie Hill in Golden Gate Park. “Have you ever smoked marijuana?” she asked. “No, I haven’t yet. But I’d like to.” Well, Kathi stoned me for my very first time up on Hippie Hill. For the record, the word “hippie” comes from “hipster.” “Hip” is slang for “aware.” This was the beginning of the end, one could say, even though I didn’t really get off on that first toke. Toad and I also had another bizarre experience together during this Summer of Love. We attended a Baptist revival meeting at a circus tent in the Happy Valley district of Fairhaven, Bellingham. Toad had been drinking beer and, being an atheist, didn’t cotton to believers. I didn’t know what to think, not having been exposed to religion yet. The crazed preacher was expounding brimstone and hellfire inside those canvas walls.\n\n13\n\n“My God… is this what religion is all about?” I thought. After mocking them, we quietly slipped out under the tent canvas. “Who needs a God like that, Toad?” I just don’t understand this thing called religion- yet! This summer also introduced me to LSD and Timothy Leary’s mantra, “Turn on, tune in, drop out.” Faithfully and sadly, I took both to heart. Now, I knew what acid was. In total, I dropped good LSD about a dozen times, way less than most of my peers. My first trip took me from being an agnostic, who doesn’t know if there is a God, to the realm of a true believer. My mystic path had just begun; it was a real turning point. Acid let me see things clearly, I felt, just as they are, peeling away the onionskins of preconceived ideas and perceptions of judgment in my mind. It’s very difficult to write about acid trips, practically impossible actually, as most of it is so far beyond words. Trying to explain seeing things at a sub-atomic level, where everything is in a state of constant motion, isn’t real easy to describe, much less relate to for most people. I was fortunate enough to have experienced guides, harmonious settings and so, basically wonderful trips. Acid made me aware of other levels of reality, whatever that is, and let me feel a structured and loving, divine order to all of life. I’d only tripped twice in ’67, but it really opened my mind, as they say. It was the first crack in my ego shell, which allowed me to get a glimpse of pure Spirit. My own experiments were always special, sacred and spiritual. To me, acid was a sacrament, not a toy. It could show you heaven or take you to hell in the wink of an eye! Respect it and keep it holy. I realized early on that it was just a door to show me the Way. Not to be considered or mistaken as the Way. However, that’s the trap that many got caught up in. I’m lucky to have survived, I guess. As my parents weren’t churchgoers, I was raised agnostic. We didn’t talk about God in our house. When I was a youngster, my mom took me to Sunday school briefly, but then was appalled by all the hypocrisy. She promptly yanked me out. In the war, she had held a dying soldier in the ocean, with both arms and legs blownoff. After this, poor Mom couldn’t believe in God anymore. Mom 14\n\nwas Scots-Irish with flaming red hair, a temper to match, coal black eyes and nice long legs. She’d been a babe in WW2, as a scrub surgery nurse under General Douglas Mac Arthur in Australia and New Guinea. Mom was one of fourteen nurses surrounded by two thousand lonely soldiers. Here, she learned to smoke, drink, dance and cuss. Her bad habits would ultimately corrupt my poor dad. During her last year of life, at age sixty-four, her faith would finally turn around. Mom always told me that we create our own heaven or hell right here on earth. It has taken me over fifty some odd years to fully realize the complete truth of her statement. I did drop out, as they say. I guess I was destined to all along- always the Rebel on so many levels. But what was I really rebelling against? Myself sadly, and not just authority, but I wouldn’t realize this for a very long time. Also, I descended from Quakers, historically the first semi-hippies in anti-establishment Europe. I became the black sheep in my parents’ eyes, for dropping out in more ways than one, and would later in society’s eyes. But, all things considered, I’m still glad I got to experience all I did back in the ’60’s. It was a real trip! Jesus, Mayhem, and Red and…. For about two weeks now, I’ve been coughing heavily as nicotine toxins exit my system. I know my cough upsets the Mexicans, but I’ve just got to get this phlegm out. I really felt no come down from alcohol, except the occasional nervous body snap when fully relaxing before sleep. Sleep, everyone does a lot here. It kills time. I did a lot of deep breathing and quick walking of laps around the dayroom, joining an orange line of others in the exercise program. The high starch diet is a major change from my usual fare of fresh veggies and brown rice. I’ve gotten horribly constipated and had to queue up in the nightly med line for laxatives. I’m drinking water copiously now, to aid this common incarceration problem. It does feel great, finally, to escape the bondage of demon alcohol and its ensuing entrapment into my lower nature. I’ve sadly 15\n\nbeen under the spell of the false self, the ego, whose very nature is harmful, for far too many years! My awareness of my true nature, the Higher Self or Christ within me, grows daily, as I now confront my forced sobriety and shame over a wasted life. Finally surrendering more, I’m letting God have His perfect way here. I long for the awaited healing of my heart and soul. I just feel grateful to be alive right now, even here in county jail. “Look at that dude. Jesus Christ’s clone has appeared!” a fellow inmate shouted. This inmate from Seattle, as I learned, looked exactly like actor Robert Powell from Jesus of Nazareth. I wonder what the guards thought as they processed this carbon copy of the Lord. God definitely has a great sense of humor, even in jail. “Have you gotten any mail yet?” I was asked. “Yea, I have and surprisingly from my first ex-wife.” “How many ex-wives do you have?” “Only two that I know of,” I responded. Jolene put fifty dollars on my books but, and as the county takes one dollar per day for rent if you have money, that doesn’t leave much for commissary candy. She let her folks know of my new address, and soon her faithful mother wrote me too. Her letter was heavy- hard love. Many sentences were underlined, admonishing me to never drink again and reminding me of all I had lost, just to feel good temporarily and numb out life. After reading the letter, I said to another inmate, “In a strange way, I’m grateful that my parents aren’t alive any longer.” “Why would you say that?” “I’m sure my mom would have killed me verbally and most definitely disowned me.”\n\n16\n\nMy dad had already done that, years ago. I’m sure they are both rolling over in their graves, but then again, they don’t have any, as I put their cremated ashes to rest in the ocean. “Yeah, my mom is really having a hard time dealing with my incarceration. My dad hates me now,” answered back the fellow inmate. The White Supremacy Arian Brotherhood is powerful in this jail. Names like Chaos and Mayhem are popular, along with swastika and lightening bolt tattoos. And, of course, the shaved head. They keep the majority of Mexican nationals or Pisa’s in line through intimidation and fear. I learned that in the Convict Code, racial pod fathers negotiate problems between the races. Father knows best. You never eat with other races, only your own. Sean, the unspoken king of the Aryans, silently ruled our pod. He had the German Nazi eagle tattooed on his neck and even drew it out as an extensive letterhead on letters he wrote. And he wrote continuously. When Sean got shipped over to Prescott for court, a real asshole named Red took over. Red was a meth-head and had been up speeding non-stop for nearly two weeks. He was pronounced clinically dead in the E.R., after ingesting mass amounts of speed in a police chase. However, he miraculously survived, to torment us all here. Red had a very loud idiotic machine gun-type laugh, which cackled constantly throughout our waking hours. He combined this audio torture with saying, “You know what I’m talkin’ about?” and “You know what I mean?” every few seconds in his babbling dialogue of his egotistical drug orgies. This sick dude looked like an angry Vincent Van Gogh, combined with the Energizer bunny. He even shouted at me, “Hey old man”, a first that really hit my ego. Red was a classic bully who reigned through intimidation of weaker, less institutionalized inmates. He was a real super control-freak and doing his best to exert his power. Some people seem to come into their prime in here. The lowest can become the highest. In all of my life, I’ve never really felt such hate for an individual, until I encountered this Red. I really don’t like to use the word hate, but he was the 17\n\nliving embodiment of all I detested- a real human antichrist in my opinion. Yet, what was he reflecting in me, to make me so upset? Are my own imperfections so intolerable that I project them onto poor Red? Maybe someday I’ll be able to offer compassion, instead of judgment. Four of us inexperienced jailbirds even wrote a kite, the proper prison paperwork, to the guards to have Red removed from our pod. But this, as we later learned, was a form of snitching or ratting off in the Convict Code. Learned inmates would have just smashed Red. However, it takes time to learn all these unspoken rules. We all, unfortunately, had plenty of that still coming our way. In time too, I would have my confrontation with Red. Oh, those innocent days of youth…. On the first day of spring and the last day of Pisces-March 20, 1949 I was born in Seattle, WA to Dr. Eugene Melvin Rideout and mother Jane. On my first day back here on earth, I was treated for spastic bowel with opium. What a way to start my life and how symbolic of my karma to come. Dad was a general surgeon in Bellingham, Washington where I grew up. Mom became a frustrated mother who probably should have kept her day job as a nurse. Our last name, Rideout, comes from Normandy, France and supposedly relates to the first warriors to ride out into battle when being attacked. Mom’s Celtic linage is an ancient line of nomads who were difficult to govern and viewed as rebels prone to violence. But I inherited many good qualities from these two bloodlines: a sense for travel and spirituality rather than religion and a resilient self-confidence coupled with a selfcleansing psyche that loves life. Two years after I was born, my sister Joyce showed up on the scene. She was born on Friday the 13th, the same as Dad, but different months. I was blessed to have Joyce as my sister, for now anyway. Together, we tried to understand just how to survive in a classic dysfunctional family. Poor Mom had lost her three best friends to polio after I was born and became very depressed. She strived endlessly to be a Super 18\n\nMom of the ‘50s, wanting only the best from and for her children. Needless to say, her dream failed to materialize. Sadly, Mom seemed to thrive more on melodrama and the adrenaline rush of worry, fear and negativity, than on life itself. She would never find any kind of inner peace, until she was nearly at death’s door. Her ego was fast, always in fifth gear. It rubbed off on me, as I had to be prepared to respond instantly around her. My hasty spirit was already being formed. And Dad, being a doctor, seemed to have a shell around his heart and feelings. Maybe this was his way of dealing with other’s health problems and death, but he was emotionally not there much, for me or my sister. There wasn’t any hugging or “I love you” in our family. The phone was constantly ringing, always interrupting any kind of semblance of family life. To this day, I still react adversely to ringing telephones. Many nights my mom would take my bed, in her desperation to get sleep, forcing me to lie next to my snoring dad and that telephone next to the bed that would surely bring a 2 a.m. call from some hypochondriac patient. Being this doctor’s son was no fun. In Lowell grade school, I had a lunch box of Davey Crockett killing a bear and a decal of a newspaper with a headline asking, “What’s the Latest Dope?” This was a common saying in the ‘50’s, meaning, “What’s up?” Ironically, this would have various levels of interpretation in my later life. I was a Cub Scout too; Pack Seven, Den Five. Once, at a large assemblage of scouts, I was nominated to lead the flag salute, the sacred Pledge of Allegiance. This was my first experience of performing in front of a crowd and I froze up big time. I was so nervous that I couldn’t even remember the first word: “I.” Finally kids began whispering, “I” to me, so we could get this hellish ordeal over with. Who, at this point, would have ever thought I’d spend most of my life in front of audiences? I was off to a rough start. Mom became a den mother and was highly regarded by my peers. When I asked them why, they replied, “She is cool.” Little did they know how crazy she really was? They were only seeing one side of her Gemini personality. She was progressive and very different from their mothers, with her Lucy persona and war experience, and they enjoyed the change. Why was my mom such 19\n\na wild card? Would I end up like her? Being more of a female, right-brained person myself, I told my friends, “I feel very comfortable with your mothers, who are calmer and more of the June Cleaver/Harriet Nelson mold than my Lucille Ball mom.” “Well, we like your mom better!” they answered back. You’ll never know, until you’ve been there yourself…. On my fifty-fourth birthday, my son Sri Ram sent me greetings and a decent guard even wished me “Happy Birthday”. Then, on March 24, 2003, I was sentenced to prison in Superior Court by that same balding judge. This was the day I’d been anticipating. What would my sentence be? “How long did you get?” asked my cellie when he saw me return to our pod. “Two and a half years, with no fines or probation- only community supervision upon release,” I answered back. “That is the politically correct terminology for parole now.” The reality of this hadn’t sunk in yet at all. After this sentencing, I was officially upgraded to property of the State of Arizona, instead of Yavapai County, even though it would be another month before I’d be transferred to my new ADC yard. Returning to my pod, I was in shock, to say the least! I’d met earlier with a local probation lady, who supposedly influences the judge’s decision. “I know you won’t qualify for any minimum sentence, due to your priors,” she told me. “Well, I kind of figured that.” “I want to see you in a halfway house upon release, with five years of probation!” she sternly warned me. “Your destructive behavior and irresponsible drinking could have easily killed you, others or even Sri Ram.” 20\n\nGuilt, shame, fear and deep remorse set in strongly. I was trembling, I was so scared. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so scared. Oh God, what have I done? I feel so pitiful! I’ve created some very heavy karma and the scales must be balanced now. Remember, I told the judge that whatever he sentenced me to, I saw it as the will of God. I still respect his decision, as heavy as it was. The way I see it, I deserve it! It’s all good, as it’s all God and it’s all karma too. With good time, I’ll hopefully be out in twenty-three months instead of thirty; maybe. That still seems like a long time to me, right now, as the reality of all this settles in. It really seems like a long time! I’ve got to stay positive: Positive, Positive, Positive. Now, I just wonder when exactly, I’ll be transported out of this nut-house jail. One inmate told me a jailhouse truth. He said, “Dude, this is probably the only time in your life when you can’t wait to get to prison.” How appropriate! Then he said, “You’ll be sent to a DUI yard - much better than ‘real’ yards, where violence, politics and fear are the norm. And in some of those yards, you can actually make some money, working outside, as you’re considered a minimal risk.” “Wow, prison does sound a lot better than jail,” I replied, thankful for this ray of hope. “Oh, it is. You’ll see. And after the way you stood up against Red, verbally, when he tried to bust your balls, I think you’ll do just fine in prison. He could have smashed you, you know, but you nailed him with the truth.” “Yea, I sure hope you’re right, as it’s been a bit stressful mentally so far,” I responded, but more to myself than to him. This place is aging me already, I thought. Red and I did get into it; Red yelling obscenities, while I slashed him to the bone verbally. There was a huge crowd all around us. It got very heated and I was a bit worried. After all, I’m dealing with a crazy person here. “Just so you know, Rideout, if Red would have hit you, we would have been all over him.” 21\n\n“Thanks, that’s reassuring even after the fact.” During my second month of waiting, my dear old friends, the Harmon’s, finally wrote. Barb suggested that I move back with them and build a cabin for myself on their wooded acreage. This promising news was like a shot of divine adrenaline. It gave me hope with a capital “H”; just what I needed after my sentencing. I would definitely be writing Tony and Barb Harmon more, when I arrive at my new ADC home. That change occurred early on Friday, April 18, 2003. The guards shouted those infamous words, “Roll up!” and I knew I was now off to Alhambra- the Arizona Department of Corrections’ equivalent of Ellis Island in New York; a convict processing plant, for those newly entering the system. I’d already been fully warned about this place. Three other convicts were chained and shackled with me on our ride to Phoenix, in a heavily barred transport van. There were seven other inmates already in this van, from jails over in Prescott and up in Flagstaff. I hadn’t seen I-17 or the Verde Valley in two months, so even this ride was a simple treat for me. I joyously watched the scenery pass by from the rear view screened mesh window, on this one and a half hour road trip. Then, we stepped out of the van into another world. “God, even the hot Phoenix sun feels good,” I commented aloud, after being inside concrete buildings for so long. We were only allowed outside maybe once a week, for about twenty minutes, back at county jail. Then I noticed that the guards here all carried rifles with scopes, looking down from the rooftops of this classic institution. This was a maximum security yard, as many criminals here carry far worse records than a mere DUI. DUI’s are considered a minimal risk, but we receive far harsher sentences than car thieves, child molesters, rapists and burglars. Our crime is technically a traffic violation but we get a felony, a cross we’ll have to carry with us for the rest of our lives. Even though we did it to ourselves, it just doesn’t seem fair somehow, sometimes, but karma is karma and God knows, I’m trying to deal with mine. 22\n\nEverything has a beginning…. Herded inside like cattle at Alhambra, we were all instantly assaulted by a large team of staff who were moving about every which way and then finger printing us yet again. It was as crowed in here as Costco on Saturday afternoon, with new arrivals wondering which way to turn. Next, photos were taken of our clean-shaven faces for our personalized “license plate.” This ID card, with your notorious ADC number, will always stay the same. The new identification badge is to be worn at all times, in plain view, on our new orange jumpsuits. All tattoos were photographed and documented and this took some time, as many cons had “sleeves” on their arms or near-total torso coverage. I was questioned by a huge black NFL-looking intake officer about the Om sign, which looks like a squiggly three, on my wrist. “Is that tribal?” “Yeah,” I replied, yet laughing inside at my answer. “Tribal,” I thought. “That’s a good one!” To me, only a person of African descent would say something like that. He would probably never understand the Sanskrit symbol anyway. Little did I know at this point, just how political and tribal tattoos are in prison. Like Anglos had better not have feather tattoos, as only warrior chiefs were allowed that privilege. Sadly, I hardly met any “chiefs” I’d consider warriors. Alcohol had taken down their once-spiritual civilization in the 19th century but they still have plans to drink and party when they get out. I sometimes wonder if today’s Indians aren’t the very souls who persecuted the Redman, only to reincarnate this time around on the other end of the karmic scale. Next, we were all herded off for pee tests and eye exams. With hundreds a day being processed, these hurdles were done quickly. Anybody going to prison in Arizona must pass through Alhambra first. It was a rude awakening to see so 23\n\nmany others in trouble too. What do the personnel working here think, seeing daily, year in and year out, so many wounded souls passing under these gates of hell? Everybody is now just reduced to a number. If a name is used, it’s always your surname. “Hey Rideout, come over here right now!” shouted the C.O. “Yes Officer, I’m coming.” I’ve personally always preferred first names; much more intimate. I usually get some kind of a comment or snicker when people hear my last name, yet I’m always proud of it, since there are so few Rideouts in the whole world. One day, I will ride out of this place. But for now, the game is to accept “authority”, which I’ve always had a problem with, and slowly become institutionalized, without even knowing it. It happens. Finally, we were all assigned to rooms in a hallway called Dog Run- small yellow rooms with eight inmates in old tinny bunks and six more on the remaining floor space. One such room housed the criminally insane. These poor souls looked so lost, as they stared out the single barred window. I wonder if they even knew where they were, let alone where they’d be going or what they had done. An institutional stainless steel toilet sat in each room’s center, so everybody could watch you relieve yourself. This made peeing very hard for many nervous ones, me included. And you’d better damn well flush repeatedly when shitting, for the smell. I was blown away by how much toilet paper those guys used- like ten feet for each wipe. That is such a waste! But it’s just one of their ways of getting back at a system that they feel put them here. I know something that most of them don’t know yet. I know I put myself here, without a doubt. This prison is very old, built in the early 1900’s but looks like it weathered the Civil War. There are no books and don’t even consider TV. This was the adult experience of “nothingness.” There really wasn’t much to do but talk to each other and compare our horrible tales of woe. 24\n\n“Did your parents do weird shit when you were a kid?” asked a bored inmate. “Oh yeah, they sure did,” I responded. Whose parents didn’t do weird shit? “We took a family trip together, when I was about fourteen, to see my Grandparents in San Diego. I remember my dad sneaking out behind his parents’ backs to smoke a cigarette. Dad’s homely mother Grace was a dead ringer for the witch in the Wizard of Oz. His father Harry resembled a Native American chief. He had no idea that his serious doctor son smoked. That’s messed up, don’t you think? Well, my Grandma Grace was pumping pecan pie down me big time, as my dad was sneaking around outside. Give me a break! I learned then how to do my own thing, by not letting my parents catch on. If my dad did it, it was O.K., right?” “You got that right, Jack! My old man was the same way. They were teaching us to lie, unbeknownst to them.” “One of the scariest memories was when Mom left us, in her orange VW ragtop, to commit suicide. I think she might have been drinking as she was raving frantically as she drove away. She planned to drive off Chuckanut Drive into the ocean. And she let us know it loud and clear, by punching a hole in the back door before she left. Obviously, this was a call for help, love and healing. My sister Joyce and I cried and screamed, while our dad did nothing. He just waited silently. Mom returned later that night, after we’d cried ourselves to sleep. Thank God. Nothing was ever said about this later. That’s the way it is, in an alcoholic household.” “Yeah, I know all about alcoholic home fronts. I think most of us here do.” Once every three days we got to shower. There were about five working showers, in a small room with forty-five inmates waiting in line. When the prison towels became scarce, they passed out orange tee shirts to dry ourselves. One heavy biker dude asked me, “Did I ride with you up in Jerome?” 25\n\n“No, I don’t think so.” At least he thought I looked biker enough. Lunch, in-room always, was a plastic sack filled with two bad sandwiches, cookies, stale chips and a packet of lemonade. Then, we either napped or told our tales again until dinner. “Are you a Christian?” asked the small black dude next to me. He couldn’t wait to get to prison where he could have his Bible. “Wow, now that’s a loaded question,” I answered back hesitantly. “Yes, I am. But not in the way that you think.” I’ve pretty much been from A to Z with what I call, “Churchianity.” The Campus Crusade for Christ, my first girlfriend Jeanne and Art History at college, all influenced my conversion to Jesus. As our family never read the Bible, when I converted to Christianity, I became fanatic. I’ve always been an extremist and seem to take things to their limit. But I drove my poor parents up the wall, in desperation to save their souls. Didn’t they want to accept Jesus as their personal Savior and go to heaven with me? I studied Bible scripture so intensely, that I had visions of becoming a monk. Then my dad caught hepatitis from a patient and spent a month in bed, all jaundiced and yellowish. But I was there, at his bedside with the word of God and the teachings of Billy Graham! This did not improve our father-son relationship one iota. At the same time, I was playing music in a house-band, named David, at the most happening bar in Bellingham, the Iron Bull. This popular bar was a major college hangout, due to ten cent beer specials. During breaks, I’d hand out religious tracts to drunken students or stoners in the alley. Then I’d pray for them all, by myself, in our band room. Being a new Christian was a lot of work! Many resented me for my fanatic actions but danced away when I got back behind my drums. But now, I was being persecuted for being a Jesus promo man. I even appeared in an article about “New Christians” in a college newspaper. My friends started calling me the “scatter-brained prophet” and made jokes about throwing us Jesus freaks into the lions’ den- probably meaning the taverns where I played music. 26\n\n“Jesus man, you really did embrace the Lord,” commented the black inmate. “Well, there’s more to it,” I replied. When it was finally time to fly from the family nest, at twenty years old, I moved into a Christian male commune called “The Superior Cleaner.” This was a Christian teashop with us five monks residing upstairs. Previously, the building had been a vacuum repair shop, hence the name. Jesus was obviously the Superior Cleaner. Daily, I was quizzed on how many new Bible verses I had memorized, so I could use these new weapons of mass salvation on the unbelievers of Bellingham’s streets. “How many new Bible verses did you get down today, Rob?” I was asked yet again. “Jesus, I don’t know! All of this is causing a deep confusion and neurosis in me,” I answered back angrily. It was, and on some gut level I knew there was more to the story than I was experiencing with this Christian dogma. I also attended spirit-filled services in Seattle, at all black Pentecostal and Baptist churches, hearing people speak in tongues and roll on the floor for Jesus. The opposite of this was the Quaker service of “sitting” in silence with my girlfriend Jeanne, for one hour on Bellingham Sundays. Then one night after Bible study, a Christian psychic couple visited us budding monks. They placed their hands on me as I knelt and proclaimed, “You are very special, you will travel much and touch many souls in your life. If you really want to know God, He will take everything from you.” It seems that this prediction has pretty much come true for me, now that I’m here in prison. But I’ve had a whole lot of other losses, many, long before I ever came here. “Did the travel prediction come true? Did you end up traveling to foreign countries or did you just travel in the USA?” asked my new black friend. “Both. Let’s eat first, and then I’ll tell you some of it.” 27\n\nI had already been briefed about the chow here, considered great by prison standards but you were only given five minutes, if that, to cram it down. We were guard-led, of course, out of our yellow room on Dog Run across the yard of green grass to the chow hall. Then you swallowed as fast as you could, until you heard a guard yell, “Row 1, and pick up!” This hurried eating sure can’t be good for proper digestion? It’s not. Evidence was all the farting and constant constipation. The one delightful element here was the grossly overweight neutered Siamese cat, who obviously took his sweet time eating. We were also let out every other day for one hour of walking around the yard, with the cat. Here, I saw a few others I’d done time with up in county jail. These souls, sadly, would be going to real yards, not a DUI camp. Walking together and looking up, I noticed those same armed guards again, on the roof above the razor wire looking down at us with loaded rifles. “If my friends back home could only see me now!” I thought. But where is my home now? It must be in my heart and mind, as that’s all I seem to have left presently. And this whole experience, so far, was really making me face now, as there was no other place to escape to. And ironically, a part of me on high was watching and cherishing this experience, knowing that I would never pass this way again. “This place, Alhambra, never quits,” commented one inmate. “They just keep coming and coming.” How true. It, daily, processes new inmates as fast as it can. Most inmates spend on average a week here, before being transferred finally to one of Arizona’s thirteen other prisons. Some, luckily, spend only a few days, while others might be in boredom for well over a month. And some are actually doing their time here. Yuk! I luckily only spent six boring days. I was given paper, a child-size pencil and indigent status envelopes, so I could write Sri and my friends. They all got a blow-by-blow description of my journey through this part of my incarceration. We also had dental x-rays taken, DNA mouth swabs, blood tests for HIV/AIDS, prostate cancer exams and finally scholastic tests to measure abilities in math, English, IQ, and reading levels. The numerous Mexicans took this two28\n\nhour exam beneath Spanish-speaking headphones. Most of them had little schooling, so they would be required to take literacy classes and possibly GED classes in their new yards. Why? Many would be deported back to Mexico by INS after serving their time in Arizona anyway. I don’t even want to get started on this subject. There are always more Mexicans in prisons and jails than Indians, blacks and whites. Something really seems wrong with our system. That subject could be a book too, especially concerning sentencing. Anyway, I passed these scholastic tests with flying colors. Then, counselors evaluated each person’s rap sheet and job skills, to determine which yard they’d be classified tominimum, medium or maximum. I was assigned to a minimum DUI yard. I still wouldn’t know which one of the four in Arizona, until I was rolled up again for the infamous DOC bus ride. A black weight lifter inmate, named Vincent, was my cellie, and had come down from the Verde Valley with me on the transport van. He had robbed Circle K in Village of Oak Creek, and a pizza place in Rimrock. No gun; he just walked off with the cash register beneath his two massive black arms. Obviously, he was going to a real yard, not an adult day care center for alcoholics. However, he was serving only one year, while I’d be doing two and a half. See what I mean? Where is the justice in this ambiguous system? I got notice that on April 23, 2003, I was to be transported out of infamous Alhambra. Thank God! I could hardly sleep the night before, I was so excited. So at 4 a.m. on Friday, I was given only cold cereal and little to drink. We could be on this bus for up to sixteen hours, so full bladders were discouraged. Once again, we were all strip-searched one last time. Serious looking guards inspected our assholes, scalps and mouths. What a job they have. In two naked lines facing each other, shackled in leg irons, I saw every form of penis imaginable. You will lose all self-consciousness in humbling situations like this. Now, I know how the Jews probably felt, all lined up naked in Nazi concentration camps. And my karma with 29\n\nalcohol had provided me with this life changing experience. After being shackled and handcuffed together, we took short baby steps into the barred prison bus. Every driver passing us would see that this is the bus you do not want to be on – the one going to prison. So here I sat, happy as a clam at high tide. This was definitely a big day. I was finally going home- well, to my new temporary home anyway. That’s the only way I could see it. Prison has to become my home, as bizarre as that sounds, as I’ll be here awhile. We were told not to sit in the first two rows of seats. But as soon as I sat about midway in the bus, my last name was called loudly. “Rideout… you sit up front.” I knew then that I would be the first to reach my new yard and Phoenix West Prison was only about ten minutes away. “Good deal, right where I wanted to be!” I mumbled to myself. Others had told me about this yard in county jail. I felt very lucky, as this yard had serious outside jobs where one could possibly make and save some money. I really needed that, after alcohol’s drain on my financial status. I was the only DUI on this bus- a true minority amongst other crimes. There were a lot of car thieves and hackers on board. I learned that the Revlon nail file is a universal lock pick and that magnets from fifteen-inch speakers would suck the power from auto security systems when placed on car hoods. The lessons here never cease to amaze me. Finally, the bus was fired up and running. Off we went amongst the rumblings of inmates seated behind me. There were some scary dudes on this bus and egos were already starting to flare. It was quite embarrassing, as I made eye contact with people out the window; they stared at my nameless face with pity. Only those who wear chains know the joy of freedom, I thought to myself. Finally, I was taken to…. 30\n\nWhen we pulled into the parking lot of Phoenix West, I was told by many to submit a kite for transfer. “Look at that small fucking yard! This place sucks. You gotta get out of here man!” shouted one chained inmate behind me. Yea, buddy, you do your time and I’ll do mine. When the bus guards unlocked my chains, they accidentally spilled my entire beloved psyllium seed laxative all over the asphalt. A nurse at Alhambra had just given me this gift the night before. Some lame guard hadn’t screwed the lid on properly after checking it for contraband. And, I really needed this shit to shit! Oh well, maybe some real instant coffee would finally get my clogged bowels back to normal. What they called coffee at Alhambra was really chicory root. Waiting alone at intake to receive my new orange clothes, bedding and dorm room, I was suddenly brushed into medical for explanations on how H & R procedures worked here. I would have to pay three dollars for any medical business. But I could get a second pair of institutional eyeglasses for this price too. As I sat waiting, a white dude noticed I was a new fish, all decked out in my Alhambra transport jumpsuit. He gave me half a pouch of Top tobacco instantly. I was told that the “white wood” would take care of me. They did. “Oh boy, here we go again,” I thought. After two months of freedom from tobacco, I now faced every smoker’s dilemma: to smoke or not to smoke? I made the wrong choice and went for it, when a C.O. offered to light my fire outside. I mentally promised myself that I’d quit sometime during my lengthy stay here. But prison isn’t the easiest of places to quit, as I’d soon learn. Finally, I was taken to my new micro world of Dorm 4. I had a splitting headache and was freely given aspirin and Keefe instant java by other dormies. Everybody seems to honor a new face, as I was helped to feel at home on my first day here. My new “house” was the single temporary medical bunk against the wall, with no shelf or electricity. This suited me 31\n\nfine, as I had no present money or a desire for a TV. To my delight, I had nobody above me on this single rack. I was just so grateful, finally to be in this better environment, where the lights were dramatically dimmed at night and I could lay my head down on a green plastic pillow inside a cotton case. I even had two white sheets! I remember Mom, back in the ‘50’s, sun drying our bed sheets. I could smell summer sunshine when I went to bed. Wool blankets from South America were the finishing touch to this new luxury bed here. Later, I learned about stuffing newspapers under the low mattress dents, and even thought about smuggling in sand from the horseshoe pit, to help fill in these low spots. Soldier Jessica Lynch had used sand in her bed in Iraq. Maybe I should submit a kite to ADC about this pregnant idea. I doubt it would fly. One evening, a new miniseries was airing on TV. It was about Hitler and I really wanted to watch this on our English day room television. Most cellies here owned their own clear plastic color TV’s. In fact, our dorms kind of looked like a furniture store, which had nearly fifty TV’s on display. Big black Charles, who resembled Seattle’s BoBo the gorilla, got very upset about Nazis on the TV. He released his anger on me- verbally. “Hey, turn that shit off!” Ironically, most TV’s in the dorm had this show on. As I learned quickly, Nazis and blacks don’t mix well, especially in prison. Charles’s house was right across from mine. Now I had to walk on eggshells, as I was a marked “whitey” in his book of reality. I nearly got smashed, too, by three gang banger Chicano types and a Mexican, for farting in my bunk on my first night. The coffee was definitely doing its thing. I had crippling fear coursing through me, as I tried to hold the rotten smell under the wool blanket. Boy, I hate being here right now! Paranoia does strike deep. “Use the bathroom next time, asshole,” I was scolded. I so wish this Convict Code was published and available in the library! You just learn as you go along. Pod Fathers, of the various races in each dorm, explain the finer points of institutional living and help settle disputes between the races. 32\n\nBut the gas, that all inmates have, can be a real problem any time of day and a headache for not only the Pod Fathers. I soon made friends with David H., an old California hippie who was a short timer and soon to be released. He was a gentle soul, much like me, and had a similar warped twisted sense of humor. But he was indigent, meaning no money, and had recently broken both ankles. He looked like a gaunt version of actor Peter O’Toole. He also loved his coffee, and had unique ways of hustling it off of me. There are no secrets in prison. And it’s always a good policy to share here. You never know when you might need help, on whatever level. “I heard you talking about Europe. Have you been there?” asked David one afternoon. “Yeah, I drove through thirteen countries in ninety days, in a Volkswagen van with my classmate friend Randy in 1968. We’d both just finished our first year of college. You name it and we pretty much saw it.” This Grand Tour was…. My parents gave me this Grand Tour as an initiation into life. The Volkswagen bus, which cost $1900 new, was a gift which would later be sent home and travel the United States with me and the lady who’d become my first wife. We started our trip in Holland, where we saw Ann Frank’s upstairs hidden apartment, the famous “red light” district, numerous canals and tulips and learned all about how Edam cheese was made. Most of our trip, we survived on Edam cheese. Ann’s place and the girls of the night made quite an impression on us. In the museums of northern Europe, we viewed the art of Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Raphael, Da Vinci, Michelangelo, etc., to Cézanne, Picasso, Fra Angelico, etc. - yada, yada, yada. Before leaving Germany, we visited a huge beautiful stone castle from 853 A.D., Burg Hohenzollern, complete with three drawbridges and a moat. This place fit every image I ever had of a castle. The 33\n\ndoors were ten inches thick! But a day that I’ll never forget was visiting Dachau concentration camp. It’s now a fully restored museum, but you get the idea of what it once was: full on Hell and way worse than any prison. “Wow! That must have been heavy, just feeling the vibrations there,” remarked David. “It was.” After seeing the gas chamber valves at floor level, a beautiful butterfly crossed my path in front of the massive crematoriums. This was like seeing Beauty and the Beast at the same time. Walking through the yard, billboard-sized black and white photos captured images of emaciated Jewish prisoners piled, dead and rotting. How can men commit such atrocities? Is there any hope for mankind? Is there really a God, and, if so, how could He let this happen? These were some thoughts I had upon leaving Germany. I was only nineteen years old and seeing so much. “Where did you go next?” he asked, knowing well that I’d tell him. This is a good way to kill some more time. “After trying spaghetti in northern Italy, which was nothing like Mom’s, we ferried over to Greece, reaching the ruins and Oracle of Delphi as our first stop in this ancient land. Over a bottle of yellow wine that resembled piss, an ancient Greek mariner prophesized to me. He had traveled the world and said that I looked like I came from Chile.” “Yea, you do kind of have that Indian look.” “Well, maybe. I’ve always been told that I look part Indian or maybe Jewish. You know, they used Jews to play Indians in many of the early Westerns.” After scaling the Acropolis, where the 5th Century B.C. Parthenon sits overlooking the city of Athens, we drove up the western side of Italy, stopping at Rome, Pisa and Florence. The coliseum in Rome seemed to house most of the city’s feral cats, as we visited it in pre-dawn early light. At the Pope’s house, the 34\n\nVatican, we saw the Sistine chapel frescoes where Michelangelo had painted the ceiling from scaffolding lying on his fricking back! Again, we did yet more museums that left us exhausted. These museums are huge all day affairs. We were getting callous and burned out to the Masters of Western art. The underground Christian catacombs, however, were haunting and fun to explore. This labyrinth of tunnels, eight miles long, contained tombs and secret meeting chambers. A spooky feeling unfolded for me there. These early Christian sure could dig! There were 174,000 Christians buried around the Apian Way and Saint Sebastian, Peter and Paul were all buried here too. Now that’s far out! “It definitely is. Being a Christian, I would love to see all that stuff. Did you happen to see Pompeii? I saw photos of that place in National Geographic in our library,” enquired David. “Yeah, we did. After visiting the leaning Tower of Pisa, Venice with its black canal water and Michelangelo’s David and Pieta in Florence, we spent a long day at the Pompeii ruins outside of Naples. Volcanic Mount Vesuvius still looms in the background. Vesuvius erupted on August 24, 79 A.D. burying Pompeii in ash. Remember?” “I remember, but not the exact date. I’m sure it was in the magazine article but so what. Who’d remember that? Jesus, Rideout!” “Well, this archeological city was huge, dude! We saw frozen bodies of humans and dogs, screaming, as the volcanic ash turned them to stone forever. Pompeii affected us much like Dachau concentration camp had- memories that leave a lasting impression with some even frozen in stone!” “Man, you guys saw a lot of neat historic stuff,” exclaimed my friend. “You saw the real deal.” “Well yeah, we did.” “Is it hard to remember now, this many years later?” “What do you think?” 35\n\nAfter driving through the Italian Riviera, we sampled Monaco and the French Riviera, before heading on to Barcelona, Spain. Here, replicas of Columbus’s ships, the Pinta, Nina and Santa Maria, were docked for display. We were amazed at how very small Queen Isabella’s ships really were. And we heard flamenco music here, too. The guitars and flashing rapedo boot heels really stirred our Anglo blood. I’ve always loved Spanish music and in both Italy and Spain, we heard Tom Jones’s Dear Delia sung by everyone and recorded in numerous languages. “That’s an old corny song!” “It may be, but in 1968 it was very popular! Don’t you get off on romantic songs like the Mexicans listen to? I do and I especially love Julio Iglesias’s voice.” “You can have it as I’ll stick with good old rock n’ roll. It’s more my style.” In Barcelona too, we saw the famous ballet team of Rudolf Nureyev and Joan Fontaine perform at night, in a bullfighting arena. He held the record for high jumping, long distance style ballet and in ’68 they were both world famous superstars receiving a lot of media attention. We were very blessed and fortunate to have seen them. Also in the same bull arena, we saw six bulls killed in the matador’s death dance before 34,000 people. This was sad to watch but the crowd greatly enjoyed it. At least this gruesome sport had a happy ending; the orphans ate freshly killed beef that night. “That’s certainly something we don’t get here!” exclaimed David. “All the meat in this prison is made out of turkey. You know- turkey ham and turkey hot dogs.” “Well, it is probably healthier for us. I didn’t wanna tell you but I’ve been a vegetarian for thirty years. This is the first time I’ve eaten meat in three decades.” “Really, you’re not kidding?” “I felt it would cause too many problems with the other inmates to declare my vegetarianism. Also, it’s probably good for me 36\n\nmentally and spiritually to break my old mold and be able to eat meat now. When I finally get out, in about two years, I’ll be able to eat meat if I choose. But, knowing me, I’ll probably go back to being a vegetarian.” “Okay… whatever. I still love my meat,” David commented. In France, anti-American sentiment was strong. The Vietnam War was the cause. Graffiti of “Yankee Go Home!” was everywhere. This was strange when I saw the French wearing what appeared to be American Civil War caps. Poor Randy, my traveling companion, stood out like a sore thumb. He had that blondish brillo crew cut and apple pie look. I was usually mistaken for French, English, Jewish or Canadian. We had a Canadian flag on the van’s rear view window, German tourist license plates and a Netherlands decal near the exhaust pipe, so nobody knew quite how to take us. After four years of French classes, where I was called Robere Rideaux, I tried out my new tongue. The results were insane. They understood me perfectly, but their sexy-sounding replies to my standard questions were so fast that I shut down. Let’s stick with English, damn it! It’s the universal language and most Europeans speak it anyway, along with four or five other languages. I should be so lucky. “Yeah, I hear you. I hate it when the Mexicans speak Spanish and the Indians their language and I don’t know what they’re saying. I wish everybody spoke English in prison.” “Now you know where I’m coming from, David.” The Eiffel Tower, the Citadel of Love, was fairly impressive from a distance. Up close it was very rusty and in need of a paint job. The Louvre Museum was one of the biggest and best yet. Of course, we saw a lot more Flemish masters, Madonna and Child paintings, Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and a ton of French impressionism. All the best the world of art had to offer! How very fortunate we were. I was having so much fun. Despite their lack of affection, my folks had indeed given me a very great gift. When I finally got mail, I realized that I missed my family immensely. This was my first real time away from home for so 37\n\nlong, and being only 19 years old, I couldn’t wait to see them again- especially my sister, Joyce. “I know what you mean. I can’t wait to see my friends and family again, when I finally get out. And I’m just a short timer. I don’t have that long to go. You are going to be here for awhile, Rob. You’ll make some new friends. It always happens.” “You don’t have to remind me. I know. We also took in the Follies Bergere and Moulin Rouge- the prototype original seminude stage shows that would greatly influence Las Vegas. Are you going there when you get out? That seems like an inmate dream you’d pursue.” “Who knows? I’ll write you a postcard if I do,” replied David. “Yeah, I’ll bet. I do hope you get there, though. Well anyway, this was nudity with class, at its best and oh so French.” There was an authentic forty-foot tall waterfall on stage with beautiful topless ladies descending down on ropes from above, all in feathery costumes. This was a royal night out for us. We even wore ties, a first for me, as they enforced a strict dress code. After Paris, we ferried over to the iconic white cliffs of Dover, England. That August night we saw those infamous white cliffs gleaming under the moonlight. Now we couldn’t wait to finally try British fish and chips. We luckily found a vendor still open late at night. What a disappointment! Our greasy meal was wrapped in newspaper and the added vinegar made the ink come off all over our fingers, lips and food. In London, we came down with the Asian flu which was very popular that summer of ’68 but a real pain in the neck, literally. Our eyes felt like we had knives stuck in them. We’d tie our black dress socks around them to keep out the piercing light. We both had very high fevers and probably should have seen a doctor. But we just sweat it out in the van, taking aspirin and hotter Kool-Aid and tea. As a result of this flu, we didn’t see much of London. We didn’t see much of anything for awhile with those socks wrapped around our eyes. I remember wandering around Carnaby Street, all spaced out after our illness. Here we saw the Beatles’ Apple store, 38\n\nwhich had been previously painted in beautiful psychedelic colors. Now, it was all whitewashed over and had the word Jude scrawled across the windows. Was this anti-Semitic graffiti? It certainly looked that way, especially after the concentration camp tour and Ann Frank’s house still mentally on my mind. No, it was soon to be one of the Beatles most beloved songs, Hey Jude. “Did you go to Ireland or Scotland, after getting sick?” asked my intrigued friend. “No, we didn’t get to see where my mom’s bloodline came from.” We returned back to Holland, where we picked up Randy’s Texas friend Paul for the remainder of our European experience. He was a Mobile oil kid too. Now, we headed north through Germany again to Copenhagen, Denmark. Here we saw the famous Little Mermaid statue seated on a rock in the bay. She was donated as an art gift by Carlsburg Brewery, and later some fool decapitated her bronze head off. Is nothing sacred anymore? Carlsburg was very wealthy and a patron of the arts. His brewery had life-sized elephant statues supporting the entrance and gold plated handrails on the guided, gilded tour. We got roaring drunk in the tasting room and smuggled beer out in our jeans. “Wow that sounds like something I’d do too, being an alcoholic and all,” confided David. At that time, I didn’t even know the word alcoholic yet. We were just beginning our youthful experiments with alcohol on this trip. Randy was dry-heaving in a five-gallon bucket, as I somehow drove us to our campground. We were very lucky not to get a DUI in Scandinavia. Even in ’68, one could get imprisonment and loss of driver’s license for life! Here, drinking people took cabs; responsible drinking. I sure didn’t know then that drunken driving would be the demise of my golden years. We drank heavily again at Touberg brewery. But this time, we knew well how beer was made and could have cared less about the damn tour. We only came for that one free hour of all we could drink. To double our fun, we then did both brewery tours again, 39\n\nback to back. More vomiting resulted, but this time Randy wasn’t alone, as Paul and I retched right along beside him. “Wow that sounds messed up man! You did two tours in a row of your own personal Vietnam. But I probably would have done the same exact thing,” confessed David. “You guys were like kids loose in a candy store. Guys have gone wild.” “We were more like sick puppies.” After passing through Sweden quickly at night, we went on to Oslo, Norway and the Norwegian fiords. The people had that Viking look and the natural topography reminded me of my area of Washington State. In Vigeland Park, we saw many naked statues by the artist of the same name. There was a monolith about three stories high composed of piled up, naked sculptured bodies. Another couple of aging crones were on their knees, breasts sagging, looking up at the sky. These strange stone people reminded me in some ways of the real stone bodies we’d seen in Pompeii. Also in Oslo, we saw Thor Heyerdahl’s Kon Tiki raft in the local museum. Downstairs, we could view the small raft from underneath, in an aquatic mural setting complete with mounted fish. This raft actually fell apart at the end of Thor’s voyage between Peru to Tahiti. Here it was authentically reassembled for display. It’s amazing such a small raft actually crossed that large body of water. Thor’s diary was there too, from which he penned his acclaimed book, Kon Tiki! Across the Pacific by Raft. Real Viking ships were on display too, but not quite looking as glorious as the Hollywood versions. After ninety days abroad, I arrived back home a seasoned traveler, with a taste in my soul for more foreign travel. I found out that traveling is the greatest education, as you see for yourself how things actually are, instead of someone else’s interpretation in a book. “Yeah, you could say the same thing about prison.” “I guess you could, but in 1968 our world was still rather innocent and safe for travel. Today’s world for an American traveler is far different. Even by ’69, things had begun to change 40\n\nworldwide, especially due to drugs. I was lucky to see Europe in that window of opportunity I had, Dude. I will always be thankful to my parents, forever, for the Grand Tour of Western Europe. It certainly opened my eyes.” “Thanks for sharing your memories, Rob.” “Thanks you for being here for me, David. Birds of a feather do flock together and you are one of the only birds around here like me.” “Yeah, I know. I’m glad you’re here too, as ironic as that sounds.” When the student is ready…. After completing the required Stage I and II substance abuse classes, I was assigned my first job as dorm porter. This classy job paid ten cents an hour, to clean the bathroom sinks, toilets and showers, but I only received two cents per hour, after 80% for “kick out fee” and MADD Mothers was deducted. In two weeks, I might be able to afford a pouch of Top tobacco. David H. and I shared some cosmic humor, doing this shitty job together. He is one of the few I’ve ever met who understood or appreciated my bizarre sense of humor. It was fun to share my European memories with him too. It felt sad to see him leave, as a friend in prison, or anywhere for that matter, is a great gift. Friendships formed in difficult circumstances do seem extra special. David wrote me for awhile after release, and even put twenty bucks on my books as payback for all of his coffee hustles. Later, I saw in a Holbrook newspaper that he was back in court for failure to pay fines. I wrote him again but never heard back. He’s probably back in the prison system for violating his probation, as most here are. Or maybe he did make it to Las Vegas. I’ll certainly never know, unless I receive that postcard he promised.\n\n41\n\nWhen Nazi hating Charles was released, I moved into his house. A new friendship was to begin with my Bunkie, Randy Larkins, who lived above me on Memory Lane. He too hailed from Washington, near the Mount Rainier area, having worked in the logging business in his early years. Randy was ten years my junior, and had had his own construction company doing underground utility installations in the Phoenix metro area. He had lost all of this from alcoholism. He also loved cats as much as me, so I gave him many of Jolene’s cat cards from my mail call. Poor Larkins’ head and neck always hung low. He was very depressed and had mucho shame and guilt still to process. He also had a very deep fear of relapse, upon release. His alcohol track record was very heavy from an early age on. I was continually amazed at how many inmates here really had no real friends in their lives; only alcohol, who is no real friend at all. They had placed the bottle way above any effort to create and maintain real lasting friendships. How very sad. Now that the bottle was gone, they had nothing and seemed to be realizing that. Most of the mail they received was legal mail, an indication of potentially more trouble. I was so thankful for all the letters my real friends wrote me- letters of love. I could feel how jealous others were of me. I am truly a rich man, even here in prison. Bunkie Larkins was struggling a lot with his Catholic roots, recent Christian conversion and, as always, the Devil. He feared hell and damnation on a daily basis, and basically kept his TV tuned to Channel 4, the Christian station, for help. I personally feel it only made his matters worse. Fear, on many levels, is the teachings of these “Christians” who propagate from their interpretation of the Bible. What an illusion they preach! Larkins was like a small child, just beginning kindergarten lessons in religion. Spirituality was way beyond him. He thought I was totally crazy when I reminded him that heaven is here now. Jesus even says so! Sadly, not many here understand Now, the holy instant- the only reality and all that there is. Nor do they understand how to creatively use this 42\n\nprison experience to get well, now, while serving time inside these “walls of freedom.” Most only think about getting out, not getting well. Larkins had a revelation one day. “I was placed as your Bunkie, Rideout, to bring you back to Jesus, so you can be saved.” How cosmic! How comic? Then after getting to know me a bit better, he lays another one on me. “Like how did you get so weird, man? Not too many people in here think like you…you’ve got to realize that, right?” “I had a true life-changing experience Randy. It’s something that you probably would not understand.” “Try me,” he fired back. “Okay. But please don’t judge me on what I’m about to tell you.” “I’ll try not to, Rideout. I promise.” It all began when I met my first wife, Jolene. For my twenty-first birthday present, my folks gave me a ticket to Iowa City, to scout out the University of Iowa as a possible grad school for art history. Jeanne, my first girlfriend, and I were slowly drifting apart, mostly because I always envisioned myself with a Sophia Loren type of a woman. Already my ego was leading me astray. Sophia was to be the archetype goddess of most of the women in my life. Ironically, Jeanne’s father was my airline pilot on that flight to Iowa. I even got to stay overnight with him and a few other pilots in Kansas City. Neither he nor I had any idea then, that I would soon be breaking his lovely daughter’s heart. And forty years later, I’d still be regretting it and wondering where Jeanne’s at today. God truly does work in some very strange ways. After my birthday party, where I’d stayed up all night drinking hard liquor and smoking strong hash, I threw away my bag of pot in the airplane head. I now had such a hangover that I never wanted to use again – a pattern that would be repeated often in decades to come. You know what I mean. After landing in Iowa and renting a room at the Rebel motel, of all names, I helped a blind man to his room, where he sure didn’t need to find the light switch. Then I was on the campus prowl to score again. Back then, an ounce of joy went for ten 43\n\nbucks. I entered the commons building cafeteria to find many longhaired junkies strung out on heroin, listening to John Lennon scream his brains out on Cold Turkey. That was mind blowing, as I really didn’t expect to see long hair here and I knew very little about heroin. I had on my black leather motorcycle jacket, aviator glasses and haircut like Peter Fonda from Easy Rider – always in hip style. Unfortunately, the weed I scored was laced with heroin. Unknowingly, I smoked and experienced this demonic high. “Jesus, man! You smoked heroin?” interjected Larkins. “I only did it this one time in my entire life, asshole!” “Okay, don’t get pissed off about it. You don’t have to be all defensive.” Anyway, I lay flat out feeling sick in the grass and wanting to puke, as a warm current swam through me. Those bastards! I was not enjoying this at all. When I finally stumbled back in for coffee, to hopefully come down, a new song was playing on the jukebox. It sure sounded like my musical mentors, The Beatles. I scanned the room and saw a beautiful Italian student singing along, who appeared to be single. She obviously knew this song and looked a lot like Sophia Loren! Wow. I stumbled over nervously, asking if this were The Beatles we were hearing? She simply smiled and said, “Let it be.” I immediately fell in love. As soon as we looked into each other’s eyes, we both knew that we’d always known each other and had finally found each other again. Her name I soon found out was Jolene, a Catholic from Webster City, Iowa. She was born on April fool’s Day of 1949- exactly twelve days after me. Her father was a jazz sax player and presently taught band at high school level. Her grandfather had been found as a homeless baby against the wall of a convent in Italy, and raised by nuns. Later, he stole away with his bride on a ship bound for New York, where he too was a jazz musician. So Jolene was descended from musicians and I spent my next three days following her to classes. “Was she a babe?” “What do you think? I just said that she looked like Sophia Loren. Of course she was!” 44\n\nI told Jolene that I would write her weekly when I returned home, but she felt we’d never see each other again. Well, we did. It all took time, of course and a breakup with Jeanne, but Destiny and Karma had plans for Jolene and me. So, between Bible study and my college curriculum, I’d begun writing her weekly. We got to know each other a lot better through our correspondence. She also sent photos so I could visually remember her. During this same time frame, I was baptized a “Christian” in the YMCA’s shower, by a black charismatic soul singer named Walter. I first met Walter when he sat in with our band, singing “My God” to the tune of My Girl, with a voice like Smokey Robinson. I invited him to dinner at my parents’ house. “Guess who’s coming to dinner, Mom and Dad?” “That must have been something!” exclaimed Larkins loudly then clapping his hands. I could tell he wanted to hear more. “Oh, it was.” Walter’s being black and semi John the Baptist/ Billy Graham, blew my folks out of the water, to say the least. They were receiving an adult dose of Jesus around the dinner table tonight! Even Walter’s heavy trench coat had hundreds of small crosses embroidered in the design. He often fasted for days on end and prayed continuously, writing people’s names on his conga drum head so he could remember them in prayer while keeping the beat. After our breakup, he contacted Jeanne, asking her to be one of his many wives, at his New World utopia that the Lord had shown him in Hawaii. Jeanne declined- smart move, girl. I often wonder if Walter is still in the jungle or possibly a mental institution. Despite his extremism, he was truly one of the most charismatic and beautiful souls I’ve ever met. Religious fanaticism drives many crazy. Or maybe the crazies just become fanatic. “Yeah, you might be onto something there. Look at the 450 alcoholic fanatics we’re locked up with here. Most of us became fundamentalist drinkers. So what happened after that classic dinner party?”\n\n45\n\nDuring my novitiate training at the Superior Cleaner, the federal government notified me of my draft status for the Vietnam War: 1 A- ready to be drafted. Even my student deferment status wouldn’t help me now. Please, sweet Jesus, save me! I applied for conscientious objector status and could receive it, if I’d work in a hospital. I wrote back to the Feds that I had no national pride but only Washington State pride and refused their offer. Many of my friends and I had thoughts of draft dodging to Canada. Some did. While some played crazy or injured themselves to get out of this insane war. Luckily and karmic for me, my birthday was an exempt high number when displayed on the TV lottery that we all watched nervously from our living rooms. Thank you, Jesus! Maybe I’ve had many incarnations as a soldier before, which I often played out as a child, and now I don’t need to repeat the lessons of war. I feel I was always destined to become a spiritual warrior instead. “Do you really believe that reincarnation crap?” “I most definitely do. Just compare the water cycle as an analogy.” “Well I don’t know…I’ll have to think on that awhile.” While briefly touching on reincarnation, I sometimes wonder if I’m not my great grandfather Marion Guthridge. He survived the battle of Gettysburg, as a private at age 15, in the Confederacy. I owned his small red leather-covered bible that was carried through that tragic battle. More soldiers died there in three days than in seventeen years of Vietnam. Marion lived until the ripe old age of eighty-nine- nearly twice the life expectancy for that time! I used to hold that antique Bible as a teen ager and wonder if the four-leaf clover inside came from the fields of Gettysburg. I’ll never know. The clover is the Shamrock, sacred to the Irish and may have protected him. As with this Bible, I was fascinated with all things Civil War, even meditating on battle pictures and soldiers’ uniforms. Had I been there before? Somehow, I feel I was. I was probably a Rebel, as that seems to be my in nature and the name of one of my first bands. 46\n\n“Well, you are an inmate now, Mr. Rebel and a damn crazy one at that. So, tell me, did anything happen between you and Jolene?” Two other events transpired before we were reunited. I dropped out of college in 1970, at the beginning of my fourth year. This move really blew my folks away. Oh God, Rob! They were thinking, “See what drugs have done to our son!” It wasn’t drugs but music. Then I drove to the Grand Canyon with a friend and actually set up my full drum set at Hopi Point on the south rim. I played for three hours. It sounded like thunder reverberating through the canyon. Many people came and watched me, but I never made the TV news or Life magazine. As far as I know, I’m the only person to ever do that. Today, it would be virtually impossible. “God man, you are a trip!” “You don’t know the half of it, Randy.” The year 1970 marked a cosmic Christmas and life-changing event for me. After many long months of separation and letters, I sent Jolene a plane ticket to visit me. We both needed answers concerning our love and long-distance relationship. They were definitely coming. This was just the beginning of the most magical days of my life- the cosmic times. Synchronicity was in the air and not just for me alone. The Children of Love were starting to wake up, all over our planet. “I guess you were too young to remember that, right Larkins?” “It was different for me. Remember, I’m ten years younger than you. I do remember seeing a lot more long hair back then.” Well, George Harrison had gone solo after the Beatle’s breakup and had just released his masterpiece three-record set, All Things Must Pass. The song, My Sweet Lord from this recording, was and still is my all-time favorite song. For Christmas dinner, my folks served us crabmeat appetizers and the following day Jolene and I dropped psilocybin at my friend Peter’s house. He’d recently returned from India. Peter’s bedroom wall was plastered with Hindu calendar art of gods and goddesses, all very psychedelic, and looking like they came from some astral realm with those rain 47\n\ncloud eyes. Soon, Jolene and I had to crawl on our knees, as we were too stoned to walk upright anymore. Onto Peter’s bed we fell, into an out-of-body, near-death experience. In a peaceful dark void, we experienced telepathy between each other. I would think her name and then hear her call back to me. Next, we ascended through a tunnel of whirling colors, where memories of our whole lives flashed before us in the wink of an eye. Again, this was the “near death” or “little death” experience we would read about later, in our search to make sense out of what had happened to us on this holy day. Upward we shot, into a bright white light that was a million times more dazzling than our earth’s sun, but surprisingly didn’t hurt our eyes. The peace, joy and calm were indescribable. Then, in this light appeared the bust figure of a Holy One, who closely resembled Jolene or Mona Lisa. I later thought that it might have been Jesus, but with no beard and looking very feminine. After all, I’d been praying to him for answers. What gender was this vision? The Holy One had me crying from the depths of my soul, as I felt unworthy and impure to be in this Presence. Everything was communicated from the eyes telepathically and, to this day, I cannot remember what message may have transpired. I just knew that I knew this Holy One, with deep love, respect and honor. This vision occurred exactly when My Sweet Lord was playing on Peter’s phonograph. The words being sung were killing us. It wasn’t the voice of George Harrison any longer but the voice of our own souls. Talk about synchronicity. After returning to our physical bodies, Crosby, Stills and Nash were singing the words, It’s been a long time coming, it’s gonna be a long time gone. I knew then that we had been truly blessed and that this wouldn’t happen again, to this degree, anytime soon, if ever. We immediately opened Peter’s Bible at random and just happened to blindly point to the verse that reads, “The pure in heart shall see God.” Everything fit together like a complex jigsaw puzzle, with no accidents and no mistakes, just perfect synchronicity. What an appropriate affirmation to our vision of the Lord. We had just taken our first step onto the mystic path.\n\n48\n\n“But who did you see? Were you insane or seduced by Satan’s drug visions?” questioned Larkins. “The Bible warns about stuff like this.” “No, we were not insane or seduced. And just stuff your Bible beliefs for awhile, will you?” We tried to explain to Peter and others what had transpired for us, the Holy Instant, but soon found that we were casting pearls before swine. They tried to enter our dimension but couldn’t. We were too high. It wasn’t until a year or more that we’d get our answers as to whom we’d seen. Soon things got much heavier at my parents’ house. Poor Jolene nearly died the Big Death. She was allergic to the Christmas crabmeat we’d eaten the night before and bloated up nearly twice her size, with her heart failing fast. Thank God, my dad was a doctor! He shot her up with adrenaline right in her heart to keep her alive. Talk about heavy! We were all scared shitless and worried out of our minds. How could God take my beloved from me after all we’d just gone through? This was scaring the hell out of me. She miraculously survived, after much prayer and doctoring, to return to Iowa and complete her University graduation. We’d gotten the answers we needed to any questions about our relationship. We were destined to be together again, without a doubt. We now felt spiritually married. To back up about a year prior, I had another spiritual experience on LSD- a true ground breaking kind. I was at Betty’s house tripping. She would later be Jolene’s bridesmaid. On Betty’s floor, I had the kundalini spiritual force rise up my spine through all seven charkas. It felt like I was having an orgasm in every cell of my being. The waves of bliss were so intense and strong that I thought I would die or blow apart with the next surge. It took what seemed like forever to utter to Betty, “Who is this?” I was referring to the heavenly music on her phonograph. When she softly said the band’s name, It’s a Beautiful Day, the cosmic juice shot up my spine to my sixth chakra, or third eye, where brilliant golden letters appeared – GOD – pounding in my forehead, as the wavelets of bliss continued to surge. Then I saw myself naked, alone on a stage, looking up. It reminded me of Shakespeare’s words about the world being a stage, where we are all just actors. 49\n\n“You’ve definitely had some incredible trips, Rob,” commented Larkins. “I never had the guts to do acid. I guess that maybe I’m afraid of my own mind and what I might see. So I just stuck with alcohol. The shit seems much more predictable than acid, even if it did put us here. So, who did you see in that vision?” “You sure don’t forget, do you, Larkins. I’ll tell you in time. We’ve both got plenty of that still left to do. The point is that all of the brain washing and confusion of Christianity fell away. Jesus had answered my prayers, as you would say.” These experiences gave me an awakening into the spiritual realms of self-realization. All fear of death was gone now and I was no longer an agnostic, but a true believer. What is mind blowing, however, is that I ended up here, in prison. Of course, a lot of substance abuse and many unspiritual experiences contributed to that. Even though I believed in God, Jesus and the Great Ones, I was still misled by my own self-centered, hasty ego for many decades, ultimately ending up in this present incarceration. “Even if you don’t believe in reincarnation Larkins, you can’t deny incarceration!” “You’ve got me there, Rideout. However, you’re still a loser just like me,” he retorted. “I don’t believe I am a loser, like you. I’m willing to accept the mistakes I’ve made and forgive myself. It’s the only way to move on. That’s the difference between you and me, Larkins.” “What do you mean by that?” “Well, until you forgive yourself, the healing can’t begin. Ultimately, I know that’s why I’m here. What about you?” Did I get any mail today…. Mail call is very important in prison. You can get mail that either makes or breaks your day. My young Nebraska cellie in 50\n\ncounty jail, Daffer, wrote that meth-bully Red had been smashed well by six cons over in Prescott, for trying to dominate with his ugly intimidating aura. He was taken to the hospital in bad shape. Dark souls like Red have no idea about the cosmic law of karma. He’ll have a lot of hard prison time, hopefully to learn his lessons and confront his anger and fear. Inmates will teach him that. Sadly, I never heard from Daffer again. He may have been sentenced to four years in prison, for his twenty pounds of pot conviction, or he may have been released with ten years of probation. I’ll never know. Inmates cannot write other inmates in prisons. The only way to do that is to piggyback a letter through a third person on the outside. And I don’t know any of Daffer’s friends. Soon, I had very supportive mail arriving from my beloved son Sri and female friend Lyn to brighten my days. I’d been seeing Lyn prior to my incarceration. Both expressed missing me and the intention to come visit soon. And both were praying for me daily. A guy can’t get too many prayers, especially in here. Then the depressing mail arrived. Larry wrote that David Lee Bond died of heroin on June 15, 2003. I wasn’t really surprised by his death. I knew it was coming. I’d let Dave live with me for the last ten months before prison. Now I would never be repaid the five thousand dollars he’d promised me, or be made into a “fucking prince,” another promise. Goodbye dear Brother- you had a good con going, as much as I did love you. I attempted to find out about his “living will,” but got no results. Dave’s lawyer never even responded to the letters I wrote him, concerning Dave’s death. I even began to wonder if Dave hadn’t staged his death in order not to repay his debts. At this point, I wouldn’t put it past him. Writing letters was my only means of communication and it often became very frustrating when I didn’t get replies for weeks, and then, often, many unanswered questions. To top off the depressing mail, Michael finally wrote saying that he put my dog Shanti down and that he had lost my place! He never gave landlord Ken any forewarning of his departure, thus legally breaking the lease agreement. He assured me that all of my possessions were safe in a mini storage and the rent was 51\n\nbeing paid; but for how long? His letter blew me away. Every day I worried and tried desperately to process my fears. I was now smoking more. I wrote Michael back but got no response. Lyn was also lax on responding to my urgent questions, regarding what was left of my earthly possessions. In desperation, I wrote Roderick, Sri’s step dad, to call Lyn. Finally, she wrote that everything was fine and not to worry. I still had my doubts. I thought I was somehow beyond all this and wouldn’t be bothered. Wrong! I’d become attached to my vintage clothes, stereo, tapes, books, guitars, photos, P.A. system, religious trinkets and family heirlooms I’d been saving for Sri. Please, God, don’t let me lose these things! Of course, all of these “things” I called “mine” just mirrored how very stuck I still was, in attachment. Those words from my youth reverberated in my head, “If you want to know God, He’ll take everything from you.” Next to come was an intimidating letter from landlord Ken. He was very upset about Michael leaving and the ruined state of his rental unit. He also let me know loud and clear, in his parental way, how much pain my drinking had caused him. He would surely use my situation as a tax write-off, as he’s no fool business-wise. I’m sure his only pain was the Midas complex: worrying about his beloved dollar. Isn’t it easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven? Landlord Ken sent an exaggerated itemized list of repairs, cleaning and other sundry costs totaling about $750.00- to be paid and he’d be out for my life. This letter really stressed me out, as he had repairs listed that needed attention long before I ever moved in. Dewayne, an older retired real estate agent inmate, helped me compose a politically correct response to the landlord’s unfair demands. How could Ken expect to get blood from a turnip? Especially an orange turnip who earned ten cents an hour cleaning shitters in Dorm 4? I never heard from him again, just as Dewayne had predicted. Christian wrote too. She married Joya, my second wife, and I at her island home and later baptized our son, Sri Ram52\n\nasking God and the Great Ones to bless his young life. Christian shared that she’d had eight eye surgeries and other medical tests conducted. My heart goes out to all of my friends’ woes, as I contemplate my life here in prison. Life can be so heavy. Anything can happen to anybody. Jolene has come through with flying colors in supporting me here. She sent me the money for my color TV, as my birthday and Christmas presents for the next two years. She writes regularly and sends great internet jokes and hip humor. I send these jokes to others, using the backside for writing stationary. No waste here. It’s kind of ironic, but after thirty years, Jolene is proving to be one of my very best friends. Larkins and I so love those cat cards that she sends. Looking back, it’s a shame that she"
