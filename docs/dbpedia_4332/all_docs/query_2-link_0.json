This is an unfortunate translation between Indian and English culture, where to Indians, saying \"I'm Indian\" means \"I am accepted by and live with Indians\" whereas to the English, \"I'm Indian\" meant \"all my ancestors are Indian.\" His genealogy should make it clear that he was at the very most 1/4, and that's assuming that his grandmother Ann Jackson was full. That assumption is quite a stretch.\n\nCatawba Tribe (??)\n\nMentioned in his father’s Will:\n\nThomas Jackson will 1746\n\nJackson, Thomas. Bertie County.\n\nMarch 15, 1746.
