        "text": "When Singspiel galloped down the backstretch for the first time early this morning, he appeared full of energy. Then he disappeared into the fog that enveloped Hollywood Park, and began a four-furlong workout intended as his final prep for Saturday's $2 million Breeders' Cup Turf.\n\nMinutes passed. No Singspiel. Finally, minutes later, a horse appeared in the distance in the mist, his rider having dismounted. And as he drew closer, gingerly making his way back to the stables, Singspiel walked with obvious lameness in his right front leg. The image was a dark yet apt metaphor for a Breeders' Cup that is limping to the finish.\n\nSingspiel today became the latest and most noteworthy loss from Saturday's Breeders' Cup at Hollywood Park. He was determined to have a condylar fracture of the cannon bone in his right front leg, an injury that will require surgery, will end his glorious racing career and will send him to the breeding shed next spring.\n\n''This is not a life-threatening situation, barring complications,'' said Dr. Rick Arthur, one of the veterinarians who attended to Singspiel. ''He should have no problems at stud. He's not going to race again.''\n\nSingspiel was an international star who won major races in England, Canada, Japan and Dubai. He was second in last year's Breeders' Cup Turf, but since then had captured the Japan Cup on grass in Tokyo and the Dubai World Cup. The 5-year-old horse won 9 of 20 starts, including 8 of his last 12, and earned $5,950,217, a record for a horse based in Europe.\n\nHe was also the shortest-priced morning-line favorite for Saturday's seven Breeders' Cup races. On Wednesday, the Hollywood Park linemaker Russell Hudak had made Singspiel the 6-5 choice against 11 rivals in the one-and-a-half-mile turf race. On a Breeders' Cup program that had already lost such top runners as Formal Gold, Gentlemen and Twice the Vice, Singspiel was one of the few remaining marquee names.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
