Paula Allen joked with me when the going got tough. Vee Salabiye teased me through a local purge into writing the book. Vine Deloria, Jr., first catalogued \"Red Humor\" in Custer Died For Your Sins and later told me some choice ones. Alfonso Ortiz showed me a special part of the Pueblo Southwest where every sunrise brings a smile. Al Logan Slagle taught me about comic angles into reality. Rebecca Tsosie never wavered in her warm support, and Mark Monroe kept a family sense of humor through hard times. My brother Richard, Hal Marienthal, Alan Dunn, Hal Pruett, Karin Jones, Reed Wilson, Laura Coltelli, and my UCLA colleagues brought me back to finish the book when 1 was down for the count. Dozens of scholars responded to my inquiries about tribal language and laughter. J. Anthony Paredes sent many letters, more jokes. Calvin Bedient trained his hawkeye on the fine points of the arguments, and William Gleason was ever careful in his editorial suggestions, as well as assisting with the bibliography. My graduate students in American Indian Studies patiently endured long classroom hours of talk about Indi'n humor. Rachel, my daughter, has continued to be a comic blessing; and Jeannine Johnson stood by me when I had no laughter left. To all these extended family I say A-ho! and Mitakuye oyasin.

And so little understood?\" MOM ADA Y: \"It's probably been kept a secret. It's one of the strongest elements of language within Indian cultures. . . .Humor is really where the language lives, you know. It's very close to the center, and very important.\" N. SCOTT MOMADAY, in Charles L. Woodard, Ancestral Voice \"Indians? It's a good thing they weren't looking for Turkey.\" VINI; DELORIA, JR.\n\nOn the eve of the New World quincentennial, Euroamericans are rediscovering the \"Indian\" they created by mistaken cartography, then idealized to dispossess, and all but annihilated by military conquest. For American \"Indians\" a five-hundred-year holocaust exploded in the slipstream of Christopher Columbus. His wake vaporized 97 percent of the 75 to 100 million natives in the Western Hemisphere. Pre-Columbian, indeed, signifies a Native American world not discovered, but decimated. Yet some 2 million diverse \"Indians\" survive today and tribally control 53 million acres of reservation lands in the United States. Every twenty years or so, given an oil shortfall or another frontier revival, we rediscover them, while America enters a new coming-of-age crisis. Today the concerns seem to be ecology, the peace imperative, global power realignments, and the nagging question of national roots for a country essentially composed of immigrant exiles who keep drifting west. So the Pueblo farmer, the Hopi pacifist, the Iroquois statesman, and the Cherokee gentleman come into soft media focus, along with 3\n\n4\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nPrincess Tekakwitha (the canonized martyr) and Pocahontas (everyone's grandmother) next to the high gloss of a Rambo Sioux warrior and a drugged-out Yaqui shaman—these \"Indian\" phantasms shadow the intercultural ironies of red-white history and salt American Indian humor. Why—better, how—have Native Americans outlasted half a millennium of assault on two thousand indigenous cultures in the West? To be sure, it is not by casting themselves as victims, crucified in the name of the true cross. It is not in lamenting dispossession under the banner of Manifest Destiny, or in pitying themselves reserved through the odd idealism of our simultaneously obliterating and conserving national resources (\"reserves\" of virgin timber, wild animals, and Indians seem more accurately tourist prisoner-of-war camps). The noble savage, the \"poor Indian,\" the stoic warrior, the libidinous princess, the dogged squaw, the medicine witch, the cigar-store totem, the tearful ecologist, and the rainmaking shaman—these humorless stereotypes, ludicrous in themselves yet permeating American culture today, have been invented by non-Indians for roundabout reasons. Generally, they circle the messy aftermath of abuses of America's natives and nature-at-large, while advertisers continue to turn tricks and make bucks. Our \"fine feathered friends\" serve as the miner's canary of Western cultural devastation, as Felix Cohen noted forty years ago in the Handbook of Federal Indian Law. If they go, so do we. What do Indians make of a summer 1990 issue of People Weekly, featuring Louise Erdrich, the Chippewa writer, trimmed with GermanIndian silver jewelry and a jay feather in her borsolino, as one of \"The 50 Most Beautiful People in the World,\" along with Michelle Pfeiffer and Tom Cruise? What do they think of Siouxie and the Banshees, a British punk band, or the Mazda \"Navajo\" Jeep? After a decade of Hollywood antipathy toward Westerns with redskins, how do they react to the sudden spate of Rambo-Sherlock-Hiawatha films—Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves, Robert Redford's Dark Wind and Peltier, and John Fusco's Incident at Oglala and Thunderheartl The last features a half-Indian detective investigating murders on a reservation, only to discover his ancestral roots (spun off from the success of Tony Hillerman's Jim Chee fictions and Stephen King's Pet Semataryl). Fusco, working with Robert De Niro and recently \"adopted\" by Pine Ridge Sioux, told an interviewer that the script \"deals with the ongoing oppression and attempted genocide of the Indian culture, as well as the exploitation of the earth.\"1 Is this filmic news?\n\n(Pre)amble\n\n5\n\nIndians generally respond to these gold-rush crusades with sharp humor, a good dose of sarcasm, resigned laughter, and a flurry of ironic \"rez\" (reservation) jokes that travel the Moccasin Telegraph like wildfire. They laugh hard and deep among themselves and grimace around whites, exorcising the pain, redirecting their suffering, drawing together against the common enemy—cultural ignorance. They hold out for a day when the newcomers will settle down as natives in the Americas. This study tries to relay that complex of Indian humor to non-Indians. The approach borrows from the millennia-old tribal legacies of Trickster, an antiheroic comic teacher and holy fool, to fashion a new image of the surviving Indian as comic artist more than tragic victim, seriously humorous to the native core. There are many variants, hundreds of tribal points of view, thousands of differing styles and opinions on the subject. My own argument for tribal comic wisdom takes heart from the hey oka, or sacred clown, vision on the western high plains, among the Lakota where I grew up in Nebraska—the power to make live and the power to destroy, as imaged in the wooden bowl of sky water and the thunder-and-lightning bow. The powers to heal and to hurt, to bond and to exorcise, to renew and to purge remain the contrary powers of Indian humor, Lakota-based, tribally binding, universally human. They are specific to Native Americans, idiosyncratic to contemporary tribal cultures in renaissance today, imperative to their continuance—as well as to our own intercultural understandings of the Americas. Indi'n Humor focuses on ethnic literary humor, from jokes in bars and at meetings and in kitchens; to the quieter wit of old wise people; to historical ironies still salting intercultural politics; to the outrageous license of holy fools in mythic times and at contemporary Indian ceremonies; to the written literature of the Native American renaissance that began in the late 1960s. \"For a country so rich in native humor,\" John Lowe stresses, \"we have a paucity of truly analytical treatments of it, and in fact no book that deals exclusively with ethnic humor exists, except for jokebooks or anthologies.\"2 So what crops up in The Complete Book of Ethnic Humor under \"American Indian,\" but more of the timeworn slurs: \"Virgin Squaw: A wouldn't Indian\"; or ho-ho, \"Meanwhile back on the reservation, an Indian maiden did a naked rain dance and made the Creeks rise.\"3 Aside from culture-specific studies that dimple anthropology, American Indian humor remains a mystery, if not an oxymoron, to many: \"A book on what?\" people reply in disbelief to my research. W. W. Hill's\n\n6\n\nI N D I N HUMOR\n\nNavajo Humor (1943) may be a minor pioneering classic in the Southwest, but who has perused Julian Steward's doctoral dissertation, \"The Ceremonial Buffoon of the American Indian,\" tucked away in a scholarly journal?4 In response to my survey of scholars, J. Anthony Paredes, chairman of the Anthropology Department at Florida State University, wrote to me of his master's thesis under W. W. Hill at the University of New Mexico in 1964, \"Plains Indian Clowns: A Typological Study.\" He mentioned Steward's doctoral dissertation (read by how many others? Professor Paredes wondered). Along with several letters and some tribal jokes, he added another \"somewhat obscure reference\" to James Howard's \"The Dakota Heyoka Cult.\"5 And yet, he conceded, most people are probably interested in the jokes as living cultural quips. \"The best thing I can do in responding to your questionnaire,\" Professor Paredes wrote me, \"is send you some of the best jokes I recall.\" The person who pestered me to write this book, Velma Salabiye, UCLA's Navajo librarian, has told me the best jokes, and she wields her sense of humor as daily survival. There seems to be a cultural perspective behind the individual persona. \"A Navajo who can 'see' and express the humor of situations is highly cherished and appreciated as a family member, a guest, a visitor, or a fellow worker,\" Gary Witherspoon explains. \"Navajo humor emphasizes wit and is often very subtle. At the basis of this humor are creative thought and creative expression.\"6 When a Navajo child laughs out loud for the first time, the parents invite extended kin to a \"first laugh\" rite, where the child symbolically gives salt and bread to all. This crystalline cut of daily sustenance, good humor, and grace ensures lifelong generosity as a facet of Navajo tribalism. \"Eat bread and salt and speak the truth,\" goes a related Slovakian proverb. Trying to teach me a simple Navajo greeting, Ya-ah-teeh!, Vee Salabiye bantered a Navajo language-training phrase, translated \"The goat fell in the mud.\" Navajos laughed about driving into Gallup, New Mexico, to see the cowboy-and-Indian movie A Distant Trumpet. Indians would line up to hear a line from Monument Valley that the movie's star, Troy Donahue, could not translate: \"Just like a snake, you crawl in your own shit.\" Charlie Hill keeps the Moccasin Telegraph humming with one-liners on and off \"The Tonight Show.\" The first English immigrants, he snaps, were illegal aliens—\"Whitebacks, we call 'em.\" Hill imagines the Algonkians asking innocently, \"You guys gonna stay long?\" His\n\n(Pre)amble\n\n1\n\nCuster jokes are not printable (\"Look at all those f ing Indians!\"— a barroom nude painting of Ouster's last words). A Sioux fast-food chain: \"Pups on a Pole.\" Getting the \"munchies\" while watching \"Lassie\" on the tube, Hill's Sioux roommate ate the landlady's dog. Telling or penning a joke is risky business. Thus \"literate\" here means \"verbally skilled,\" in or out of the great tradition—and crafting a good joke, telling a comic story, or simply conveying one's humor may be the highest verbal (and transverbal) interactive art of all. Indeed, as Freud implied, joking is a kind of daily cultural poetry. Paula Gunn Allen wrote in response to my questionnaire on Indian joking: \"Not to make too much of it, but humor is the best and sharpest weapon we've always had against the ravages of conquest and assimilation. And while it is a tiny projectile point, it's often sharp, true and finely crafted.\"7 \"What's three feet high and a mile long?\" she tossed in among half a dozen other quips: \"A Pueblo Grand Entry.\" Pueblos are not especially tall people among Native Americans, contrary to the high-cheekboned Sioux stereotype. Their ceremonial entries go way back in time (several millennia at least) and include immensely complex clan and cultural kinship systems. To catch the joke, there's still no substitute for common sense and quick wit. \"Understanding the form and pressure of, to use the dangerous word one more time, natives' inner lives,\" Clifford Geertz writes, \"is more like grasping a proverb, catching an allusion, seeing a joke—or, as I have suggested, reading a poem—than it is like achieving communion.\"8 \"Spits straight up,\" goes the Japanese proverb, \"learns something.\" This may be concretely Japanese on a lotus-blossom day in Kyoto, but I suspect it's translatable across cultures and climates. The specific here encodes the universal integer. \"We were poor as Job's turkey during the Depression,\" my daughter's great-grandmother would say. About three thousand years of Jewish and Christian history glance off that allusion to Job's trials. The turkey seems more recently American, where emigres from everywhere began \"as poor as poor can be,\" survived that, and prospered to give thanks. And \"there goes the neighborhood,\" Native Americans are said to have said at Plymouth Rock. The humor (and hurt) of these intercultural discoveries make up the subject of this book. Indi'n Humor addresses multiple disciplines, overlaps special interests, and responds to intercultural questions. Methodologically mixed, the approach is a breed of its own. There is no ideal reader, but more a heterogenous audience of mixed opinions, cultural frictions,\n\n8\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nvarying motives, and incalculable differences about humor in literature and in life. My approach is associative, interdisciplinary, and phenomenological—ever suspicious of arrogating closure. I trust specific investigation, distrust academic overkill. My models in associative particularity—from Lao-tsu and Heraclitus long ago, through Bachelard and Heidegger a century back, to such as Kristeva and Geertz today—move my thoughts toward awareness, as they caution respect of the contextual field and illuminate the luminous details in the critical foreground. I do not write to exhaust the subject or to silence the reader, but to startle, or to disturb, or otherwise to trigger interactive dialogues. William Carlos Williams, the doctor-poet, first freed my scholarly attentions from pseudo-grids and proved the virtue of close attention, careful inquiry, and empathic probing. Dickinson, Yeats, Heaney, and other poets continue to convince me to focus closely and feel truly and trust the big picture to come through the fine particulars. Novelists like Toni Morrison or Vladimir Nabokov, Louise Erdrich or Ron Hansen, strike me as no less closely focused or clearly tuned. So Indi'n Humor takes its cues from literary craftspeople. It is less about criticism than culture, more in search of imaginative spark than speculative certainty. My critics will badger the lack of systematic tidiness. So be it. I'd rather not squeeze the sap from living thoughts—choose to activate the data, not to co-opt the cultures. This approach is open response, not a closed case. Caveat lector. I have included personal experiences as data, along with sociocultural scaffolding, literary theory, and textual analysis. Books record lives, simply said; they are not made up of thin air or of information merely retrieved from research files. And it would be folly to think our models and methods will not be revised, reversed, or reinvented as they become public property. Thus this study presumes no closure. It broadens literary context to include speaking people and lived situations, as well as recent theoretical constructions and deconstructions, in dialogue with American Indian verse and current popular fiction. Clifford Geertz calls for systematically modest assertions that place the whole realistically in context for what it is: here a non-Indian scholar advancing what he knows, guesses, and proposes about American Indian humor, comparative cultures, even nativist gender studies. The target is literature; the scope, intercultural and broadly humanist. The discussions include readers' tastes and tendencies. The focus remains words per se, as\n\n(Pre)amble\n\n9\n\nspoken and written by American Indians or advanced about them by non-Indians.\n\nIndi'n For me the language is an odd brand of English, mostly local, mostly half-breed spoken by the people around me, filled with elegance and vulgarity side by side, small jokes that are language jokes and family jokes and area jokes, certain expressions that are peculiar to that meeting of peoples who speak a familiar (to me) laconic language filled with question and comment embedded in a turn of phrase, skewing of diction, a punning, cunning language that implies connections in diversity of syntax and perception, the oddness of how each of us seems and sees. PAULA GUNN ALLEN, \"Autobiography of a Confluence\"\n\nBuffalo Bill Cody respectfully added the adjective \"American\" to \"Indian\" in his Wild West Show a hundred years ago. Rubrics such as \"Native American\" and \"First American\" advance academic ways of glossing what differing tribal peoples generically call \"Indi'n.\" 9 This contracted spoken icon, idiosyncratic of pan-tribal dialects, comes from the people with a purpose. Sociolinguistics helps sharpen the contrary argument's edge. Wsevolod W. Isajiw speaks of an ethnic \"double boundary\" drawn from both \"within\" a group and \"without.\"10 That is, \"ethnicity\" is intercultural, something like counterreflective mirrors, where \"in-group\" and \"out-group\" are seen (and joked about) from both sides. Tribal societies have named themselves variations on \"the people\" for millennia. For the past five hundred years, the Euroamcrican outsider has spoken roughshod over native names, from the misnomer \"Indian\" down to today's advertising icons. Labeling or, more accurately, misnaming some 75 to 100 million pre-Columbian natives glossed as \"Indians\" initiated a Euroamerican process of mistranslating and stereotyping that has persisted for centuries, Tzvetan Todorov argues in The Conquest of America (1984). Roger Williams in A Key into the Languages of America (1643) catalogued Euroamerican names imposed on American natives: \"Natives, Salvages, Indians, Wild-men (so the Dutch call them Wilden).\" Native languages were brushed aside, along\n\n10\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nwith their speakers. \"Abergeny men, Pagans, Barbarians, Heathen\" came to signify \"the other\" as aboriginal enantiomorph, at once inversely noble and savage, given shifting predispositions on the advancing Western frontier. Richard Bernheimer's Wild Man in the Middle Ages (1952) investigates the mythic imagining that preceded—indeed, precluded—cultural integrity to be granted \"Native\" America. Euroamericans transposed cathedral gargoyles onto American Indians, as easily as calling them savage children or consorts of Satan. So in the beginning Indians were most wildly \"other,\" as today they remain misunderstood, the West's noble icon and sentimental native. The word \"Indi'n,\" with its dialectal elision, crosses the first boundary between native tribal peoples and immigrant Euroamericans. America is not India, we all know by now, and these tribal aborigines are nominally not In-cft-ans. They do not spell or speak themselves as such; by inverse relation to \"proper\" English, indeed, they collate dialectally across a continent as differing peoples with hundreds of cultural tongues. \"Since dialect, at least to the oppressor, is part and parcel of the negative stereotype,\" John Lowe notes, \"pride in dialect constitutes inversion, transforming an oppressive signifier of otherness into a prideinspiring prism, one which may be used for the critical inspection of 'the other' \" (\"Ethnic Humor\" 448). Anthony Mattina predicates a panIndian spoken, even written, English that stretches from Colville Reservation oral narratives to Leslie Silko's 1977 novel Ceremony. \"I don't think it would be an overgeneralization to state that Red English is a pan-Indian phenomenon, with various subdialects, of course.\"11 Thus, to capsulize the point, in their own dialects of \"Red English,\" American Indians identify themselves apart from Euroamerican others.12 Their own varieties of spoken English are separatist, to a certain extent, as the reservation land base of 53 million acres remains set apart from mainstream America. From northern plains to southwestern deserts, from coastal forests to the Smokies, the pan-tribal term is spoken as \"Indi'n.\" It is an interesting twist on an old misnomer, \"Indians,\" as the pan-tribal word has been taken in and turned around. Such dialectal inversion—and ritual transformation—lie at the heart of Indi'n humor. Nationalist definitions further distinguish red from white cultures. Lakota and Navajo, for example, represent two of the largest Indian \"domestic dependent nations,\" as federally defined. Historically, these are tribal complexes in extended language families bonded over vast time and place. A dozen or more major language families extend far\n\n11\n\n(Pre)amble\n\nacross native North America, and some five hundred distinct tongues pool locally to differentiate cultures among particular tribes. In A Breeze Swept Through (1987), Luci Tapahonso writes with an idiomatic twist of serving her Navajo uncle American coffee: I sit down again and he tells me some coffee has no kick but this one is the one. It does it good for me. I pour us both a cup and while we wait for my mother, his eyes crinkle with the smile and he says yes, ah yes, this is the very one (putting in more cream and sugar) So I usually buy Hills Brothers coffee once or sometimes twice a day I drink a hot coffee and it sure does it for me. (\"Hills Brothers Coffee\")\n\nA more specific focus funnels down to a regional band: the Oglala Sioux of Pine Ridge, near my hometown; or Shungopavi village on the Hopi Second Mesa for Mike Kabotie; or Antelope clan at Acoma for Simon Ortiz. These enclaves within tribes remain identifiable by spoken dialects, products of cultural place and local history. In the poem \"Yaadi La,\" for example, Tapahonso tells a \"la-di-da\" Coyote story of marital betrayal with a slant on standard English, not to mention a microcourse in Navajo: she fed the kids fried potatoes and spam and they watched TV. later her sister came over, she said, he's gone, huh? ma'ii' alt'aa dishii honey, i won't do it again 'aach' eeh noo dah diil whod. (old coyote was probably saying in vain: honey, i won't do it again.) they just laughed and drank diet pepsi at the kitchen table. he came home the next evening and handed her his paycheck signed, the kids brought in his sacks of clothes and sat\n\n12\n\nINDI'N HUMOR back down to watch the flintstones. he sat at the table and said i deserve everything you do to me. you're just too good for me. she kept on washing dishes then she asked: ruthie's nits' aa' yooyeelwod? (she has run away from you?) she sat awhile not saying anything then went out to get some wood, she called her sister up saying: ma'ii nadza! want to go to town tomorrow? 'ayoo shibeeso holo, hey! (coyote's back and I have money to blow now!) 'inda ma'ii nachxoogo tloodi nagha jiin'. (they said the coyote walked around outside that night pouting.)\n\nSuch literary use of the spoken Indi'n word—an English sometimes mixed with tribal and regional inflections—frames this study in what Geertz calls \"local knowledge\" of the people's own understandings. Indian idiomatic play points toward a trickster's tolerance for deviance and a survivalist's native humor. The straightest local passage into tribal particulars leads through family and extended kin. When asked about his father's most distinguishing trait, the Kiowa Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and poet N. Scott Momaday replied: \"My father had a very well-developed sense of humor. And he loved to 'kid,' to use the term. When he was in such a mood, and that was very often, he would smile in a particular way. He would break into a smile and sort of squint his eyes. That's the first gesture that I remember.\"13 And from the other perspective, Freud suggests, the infant's primal smile (turning satisfied from a mother's breast) may signal the \"first gesture\" toward biological and familial bonds that evolve and constellate as cultural humor. \"The whole damn tribe is one big family,\" John (Fire) Lame Deer says of the Sioux at Rosebud, South Dakota. I4 Tongue here inflects hearth and home. Joking crackles from kitchen to toolshed, with humor truly the \"permitted disrespect\" of sibling rivalry or motherly affection or fatherly teasing or cousin cudgeling. And in this case, literature is a record of personal definitions from psychosocial perspectives. \"What's the Indi'n definition of a papoose?\" a Navajo friend asks me. \"A consolation prize for a chance on a blanket.\" Ethnicity comes through cultural self-definition and biological given, individual epis-\n\n13\n\n(Pre)amble\n\ntemology and collective history. As Werner Sollors contests in Beyond Ethnicity (1986), the written word is a sign of spoken heritage through both \"consent\" and \"descent.\"\n\nCharacters Yet the Indian is actually a very human person—humorous, sexy, sensitive, touchy and quick-tempered, a great gossip and practical joker, a born mimic, a politician from infancy, and an incorrigible lover of human society. STANLEY VESTAL, \"The Hollywooden Indian\"\n\nWith no small irony, regional dialects of red English bond hundreds of tribes across their own iconic buckskins, as do other English dialects in India or Africa today. \"I don't think it would be an overgeneralization,\" Anthony Mattina considers, \"to state that Red English, with various dialects of course, is a pan-Indian phenomenon, roughly analogous to Black English\" (\"Mythography\" 139). Racial and regional inflections of an emerging common tongue now extend worldwide, since perhaps half of humanity speaks some variant of English. More than half the books and three-quarters of the world's mail are written in English. 15 The Chinese are learning English several hours a day on television and radio in order to \"modernize\" and interact with the rest of the world. European communities all trade in English. Global English dialects, almost languages in themselves (black English from the streets of Harlem to those of Johannesburg), constitute intercontinental lingua francas, regardless of one's politics. New forms of English are redefining the tongue rapidly for all of us. The black novelist John Wideman describes how his ancestors created \"verbal icons\" from standard American speech, playing poetically with the spoken slippage: \"Africans took English sounds and with variation in tempo, rhythm, tone and timbre transformed them.\"16 Within these speech patterns lay the metrics, textures, and lyrics of cultural literacy. \"What makes a work 'Black'?\" Toni Morrison poses.17 \"The most valuable point of entry into the question of cultural or racial distinction, the one most fraught, is its language—its unpoliced, seditious, confrontational, manipulative, inventive, disruptive, masked and unmasking\n\n14\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nlanguage.\" This is pure Trickster poetics. \"I am a Black woman poet,\" Lucille Clifton defines herself in Contemporary Poets (1980), \"and I sound like one\": girls first time a white man opens his fly like a good thing we'll just laugh laugh real loud my black women children when they ask you why is your mama so funny say she is a poet she don't have no sense (\"Admonitions\")\n\nAcross cultures and gender chasms, the black poet Jay Wright musically mixes African, Caribbean, and American voices in his verse. \"This is my mitote, / batoco, areito, / my bareitote. / This is my bareitote, / areito, batoco, / my a-ba-mitote. / Corre, corrido navideno.\" (\"Rhythm, Charts and Changes\"). Literature rises from speech, patterns the daily inflections, and codifies a people's dialogue with itself. And humor alchemizes this emic speech into ethnic music, as with the three whoring muses of Toni Morrison's novel The Bluest Eye'. \"From deep inside, her laughter came like the sound of many rivers, freely, deeply, muddily, heading for the room of an open sea.\"18 Such a literate tradition of black dialectal humor courses through Langston Hughes's novel Not Without Laughter (1930) and his collection of short stories, Laughing to Keep from Crying (1952), as it spices his \"Jesse B. Semple\" dialogues in postwar America. Hanay Geiogamah, the Kiowa dramatist, instructs the actors for Body Indian, which premiered in 1972 at New York's La Mama Experimental Theater Club by the American Indian Theater Ensemble: 1. Lines must be delivered in a clipped fashion, a kind of talk characterized by a tendency to drop final g (\"goin' \"), to jam words together (\"lotta\"), to add a grammatically superfluous final s (\"mens\"), to leave a hiatus between a\n\n(Pre)amble\n\n15\n\nfinal and an initial vowel (\"a old one\"), and (in women's speech particularly) to lengthen vowels inordinately (\"1 ots\"). In no way whatever is anything negative or degrading intended; this is simply the way the characters in this play speak English. The actors should be warned against overplaying this \"Indian\" speech. It should never become garbled and unclear.19\n\nAs a Kiowa playwright listens closely in order to dramatize tribal talk, so could literary critics and social historians pay more attention to red English in America and, beyond that, to the dialogics and poetics of humor that define peoples among themselves. Differences are where we start to listen. \"Rather than changing the way Indians talk,\" Mattina defends the nonstandard dialects of red English, \"I advocate educating those who hear Indians talk. This is an old problem, plenty discussed with reference, for example, to Black English. Some will die thinking that Reds and Blacks better talk the way we do, by God; some will die shaking their heads\" (Golden Woman 9). Writers today are carving a Native American renaissance from regional dialects of red English—its concise dictions, distinctive inflections, loping rhythms, iconic imagery, irregular grammar, reverse twists on standard English, and countless turns of coiling humor. As Geiogamah says, no negative slur is here intended—\"this is simply the way\" tribal people speak, even joke. \"Thus, even in the most sacred of the ceremonies,\" Leslie Silko deduces from Emory Sekaquaptewa's remarks on clowns punning in English, \"traditional Hopis see no reason not to use an English word to get a laugh, a laugh being their sacred duty and a part of the whole overall ceremony.\"20 Serious men make good koshares, or clowns, the Hopi say, for in their language the word for \"clowning\" means \"to make a point.\" A \"smile is sacred,\" adds one elder in the film documentary Hopi Songs of the Fourth World (1988). Tribe to tribe, Indians speak distinct inflections of red English with regional senses of humor.21 Listen to N. Scott Momaday's fictional voices in peyote prayers spoken at the Holiness Pan-Indian Rescue Mission in Los Angeles: Henry Yellowbull: \"Be with us tonight. Come to us now in bright colors and sweet smoke. Help us to make our way. Give us laughter and good feelings always. . . .\" Cristobal Cruz: \"Well, I jes' want to say thanks to all my good frens here tonight for givin' me this here honor, to be fireman an' all. This here shore is\n\n16\n\nINDI'N HUMOR a good meetin', huh? I know we all been seein' them good visions an' all, an' there's a whole lot of frenhood an' good will aroun' here, huh? . . .\" Napoleon Kills-in-the-Timber: \"Great Spirit be with us. We gone crazy for you to be with us poor Indi'ns. We been bad long time 'go, just raise it hell an' kill each others all the time. An' that's why you 'bandon us, turn your back on us. Now we pray to you for help. Help us! We been suffer like hell some time now. . . .\" Ben Benally: \"Look! Look! There are blue and purple horses . . . a house made of dawn. . . ,\"22\n\nThese southwestern, California, and northern and southern plains voices sketch prayers to the spirits in cross-tribal red English. Speech patterns in this text tend to be glottal, end-stopped, or truncated in noun-verb clusters. In plain English, talk is to the point, terse. Verbs crop up sporadically, and adjectives are spare, adverbs even sparser. Subjects and verbs don't always agree. The rarified tenses—conditional, passive, perfect—seldom surface, and auxiliary verbs fade out. As with Tosamah's invocational mix of \"conviction, caricature, and callousness\" in House Made of Dawn, there appears a great deal of linguistic \"code switching,\" even dialect swapping. Framing devices shift within voices: \"Good evening, blood brothers and sisters, and welcome, welcome. Gracious me, I see lots of new faces out there tonight. Gracious me! May the Great Spirit—can we knock off that talking in the back there?—be with you always\" (HMD 86). So differences in culture register as separate tongues within a polyglot English. Considering that Navajo, a language of thirteen distinct tenses, corresponds little with the Latin grammar imposed on Germanic-based and French-overlaid English, and that Hopi in effect has no verb tenses as we know them, it seems no surprise that Indi'n English invents itself as distinct from the mainstream schoolings, European origins, and class proprieties of America. Vincent Crapanzano catches a pointillist cadence in a Navajo description of New York City: \"Big. Many cars. Everything over my eyes.\"23 In Sioux country farther north, Marnie Walsh sketches \"Bessie Dreaming Bear\" of Rosebud, South Dakota, in Voices from Wah'Kon-Tah (1960): we all went to town one day went to a store\n\n17\n\n(Pre)amble bought you new shoes red high heels\n\naint seen you since This is the native grammar (and humor) of lived situations. 24\n\nTerrain Ethnic humor has always formed a significant part of the world of American folklore and culture, partly because it provides pleasure, and partly because of its connection with mythical concepts of aggression, struggle, and our national passion play and ritual, \"Americanization.\" Humor, moreover, is absolutely central to our conception of the world. Despite this fact, we tend to become suddenly solemn when we begin to write, particularly for scholarly journals and books. To be funny indicates a lack of seriousness. Perhaps for this reason, histories and studies of ethnicity, assimilation, and ethnic literature have frequently ignored a vital aspect of their subject; for although minorities have often entered into full citizenship through long and arduous struggle, this procedure has sometimes been both shortened and sweetened when they have made up their minds to enter laughing. JOHN LOWE, \"Theories of Ethnic Humor\"\n\nJust a note on method: we do what we do. My approach angles from an American studies perspective, leans toward an ethnic studies persuasion, confesses an American Indian studies prejudice, and claims a northern plains predisposition. We are who we are, after all, and best to foreground this from the start. Most basically, my analysis works with American culture as its focus, moving on a path of \"focused wandering,\" as Howard Norman says the Cree speak of travel between villages. That is, the study designates goals and getting to them, all the while exploring along the way. Method is not a lockstep mode or an end in itself; theory goes in service of practice (\"the sway of usage,\" Martin Heidegger says in his 1971 study On the Way to Language). This means that the rooted \"target\" moves with the dialogue. So Indi'n Humor tracks regional dialects of \"red English\" pan-tribally in a Euroamerican setting. The approach comes up interdisciplinary\n\n18\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nwith a literary bias, starting with the English minim, the syllable of most basic sound and meaning. This acoustic minimalism begins as a phonetic or even musical process, at first listening for the sounds an \"other\" makes or doesn't make, as the case may be, where silence shapes speaking. Cultural parameters determine how speakers and listeners size up one another. Crapanzano says in The Fifth World of Forster Bennett, \"The Navajo don't talk much, and even for a Navaho Forster is quiet. His monotone makes him a master of understatement. Most white men, Gene tells me, think he's stupid and most Navajos consider him intelligent\" (105). In the beginning I'm uncritically \"-etic,\" listening from the outside in. As the listening goes along cultural lines, I slowly find myself bridging into the \"-emic\" insider's illusion that I know what's going on, or at least I flatter myself so, given a choice comic morpheme. This illusion soon dissolves. For syllable leads to syllable, building \"words\" in literary sequences, and eventually a syntax or phrasing starts to establish a \"line\" (rhythm, pitch, tone, cadence in the rippling of the phonemes). Where the sentence ends or the line breaks, pauses, or enjambs (ends but goes on) opens a set of syntactic questions about form—which leads to a third consideration: structure. Why do two lines make a couplet in Roberta Whiteman's Star Quiltl or five sliding beats blank verse in James Welch's Riding the Earthboy 407 or five shaped paragraphs an essay in Vine Deloria, Jr.'s Custer Died For Your Sinsi or so many chapters a novel in N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawril What dictates the Navajo pause in a Coyote telling, the clown's hop in the Pueblo kiva, the curve of the horizon from a Lakota vision pit on the mountain? How do crafted differences, in short, compose a whole beyond themselves? This kind of reflection leads into a fourth problem: style—how we do what we do. Is it the whole or the motion of the parts that targets our attention? What is the connection between product and process? Is Charlie Hill, the Indian comedian, continuously funny on stage, or is he funny only when we laugh? How does his \"humor\" encompass the particular one-liners that delight red and/or white audiences? Is Gerald Vizenor's hilarious video starring Charlie Hill, Warriors of Orange (1984), a clever bunch of Indi'n jokes or a \"comic form\" as Northrop Frye would define such? Does dancer or dance define the dancing movement? Perhaps style is the figure in cultural motion, and structure maps its going along. Style may be a way of describing what specifies\n\n(Pre)amble\n\n19\n\nthe cultural process we're caught up in—the personality of the maker, the character of the experience experienced. This preamble is clearly stamped with the author's personality and \"style,\" in imagined dialogue with an absent reader. But then things get complicated: What gives character or shape to personal experience? As culturally bound integers in time and space, don't we stylists \"project\" meaning onto things, aside from their inherent thingness? We \"read\" (into) things. And this is where cultural metaphors go to work, simile on one side (conceptual signs) and symbol hip-deep in things on the other (icons that speak beyond themselves). So this appears to be where undertone and overtone make the syllable or single note a harmonic (or disharmonic) chord. For the social scientist, these chromatics present symbolic registers of culture, the synchronic moments when we hear what's been going on diachronically for centuries with a people. For the aesthetician, it's harmony; for the humorist, the rippling interplay of time, space, and people across differences. If syntax seems in some way analogous to a lyric line or narrative sequence (moment by moment in timed space—the pacing of a joke), and structure composes the whole, as style is the more or less magic differential between Mozart and Mahler, then simile-to-symbol constitutes that subterranean complex of hidden thirds, fourths, half-tones, and sliding notes that give tone and texture to a text. It's the bubble behind the joke about to burst. In Insight and Outlook, Arthur Koestler describes this as \"in\"-sight that comes \"out\" to look. Freud sees it as a crafted \"release\" in joking, and Mary Douglas details the \"permitted disrespect\" of contextual codes that key such artistic release. Indians tell me it's what makes the fun funny, the clown with the bent arrows comic at a Sun Dance, or blackface \"Jesse Jackson\" katsinas jokable in orange wigs at Hopi ceremonies the year I started this study. Joking appears, in short, as culture-in-action. The cultural anthropologists, from Frazer, Boas, and Sapir, to Turner and Geertz, have much to tell us about how we read meanings into things. Indi'n humor, since it is so little discussed yet so widely acknowledged among tribes, projects a perfect inner circle or play-sphere, in Johan Huizinga's sense, to gauge how we read one another across the Buckskin Curtain. So lastly, I ask, what is the sense in all this? Why am I doing what I do, and to what end; and why did \"others\" basically so not do, or do a bit, or do so differently? Does it mean anything culturally significant or measurable, beyond my own personal interest? Might it make a dif-\n\n20\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nference in anyone's life? Should it be fun? These thorny questions of intention, use, and personal reward will never be answered to anyone's satisfaction. They seem in the fullest sense ultimate and irresolvable; but it pays to ask them at the end-of-the-beginning as a conditional check on how syllable led to syntax, to structure, to simile/symbol, to style, to sense. Theoreticians might periodically question both means and ends as self-reflexive \"suckholes\" (Cree freezing quicksand). Those cautions look back on how 1 thought I wrote this book—and now begin revising with a multitude of readers in mind, from Bakersfield to Boston to Rattlesnake Butte. We should never forget that we, the see-ers here (writer/reader), are seeing the seen (my pretext/our context/your text)—and that on the other side native \"seers\" peer back at us. Seeing is intercultural dialogue, especially when an Anglo writes about Indi'n humor. The ideal translator would be a breed of both, and many of the new Indian writers are just that, bicultural ethnographers. Such American \"native\" translators chart a process of symbolic interaction for all of us, a phenomenology of subjects and objects in kinetic tension going back centuries. We play seriously at understanding things, scientifically and humanistically. Surety and speculation need not conflict. Hence, a due measure of humility—and humor—is called for. \"Historians have found the first treaty the United States government ever signed with the Indians,\" says Frank Marcus, the Taos Pueblo fire chief. \"It states that the Indians can keep their land 'for as long as the river runs clear, the buffalo roam, the grass grows tall, and the mountains stand proud—or ninety days, whichever comes first.' \"25\n\n1 Red/White American Everything is funny as long as it is happening to somebody else. WILL ROGERS\n\nBack Home By the late 1960s, I had read Black Elk Speaks—a strangely troubling, still visionary story by John Neihardt about my northern plains home. During my last semester in graduate school, a Japanese-American friend lent me a new novel, House Made of Dawn, by a Kiowa writer as yet unknown (Momaday's Pulitzer was a few months away). Then in the spring of 1969 Playboy published \"Anthropologists and Other Friends,\" from Vine Deloria, Jr.'s outrageously titled Custer Died For Your Sins. The line was borrowed from a bumper sticker to goad missionaries. The Playboy essay was illustrated with a casually dressed contemporary Indian pinned in a specimen box. I read it in the city engineer's drafting room in Alliance, Nebraska, where I worked during college vacations. Alliance rednecks didn't consider Indians funny or literate; my callow stereotypes shattered. Little did I know of Scott Momaday's resonant sense of humor (in a month he would buy me a hamburger on Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue). Nor was I aware that Nick Black Elk, along with Joe Chips, had been heyokas, or sacred Sioux clowns, around my hometown. And I discovered that Deloria, a Standing Rock Sioux, not only was a skilled lawyer and satiric writer, but had been a Lutheran divinity student for four years. He was now publishing in an all-American glossy on Indian humor! I had a few things to learn. Indians do laugh a lot.1 Kitchen to back porch, tribal council to national caucus, the tribal \"cement\" of the pan-Indian movement today 21\n\n22\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\ncomes through Indi'n humor. Deloria says: \"When a people can laugh at themselves and laugh at others and hold all aspects of life together without letting anybody drive them to extremes, then it seems to me that that people can survive.\"2 This humor is both traditional and contemporary, tribal and geopolitical. Not only do Indians bond and revitalize, scapegoat and survive through laughter, but they draw on millennia-old traditions of Trickster gods and holy fools, comic romance and epic boast. There is, and always has been, humor among Indians—and some five hundred tribal variants in the contiguous United States, locally indigenous to climate and geography, genetics and history. Daniel Brinton, in The Myths of the New World, crowned the ubiquitous antihero, \"Trickster,\" the year of the 1868 Red Cloud Treaty. S. G. F. Brandon, in A Dictionary of Comparative Religions (1970), sees this lawless comic figure as the \"mythological portrayal of a kind of surd-factor,\" an original radical as clown of the creation, who proves both diverse and common across global cultures.3 While \"the\" Trickster is pan-Indian, and some forms of libidinous humor surface in many tribal creation myths (from African Ananse to Chinese Monkey King), Wichikapache remains specifically a Cree fool of the Canadian North who teaches survival through error. Wakdjungkaga, a near relative in northeastern Nebraska, breaks all the Winnebago rules to prove them. Pueblo koshares in the Southwest drink urine and bathe in dung to stretch the limits of the gods, inversely to relieve ceremonial tension (these spirits have no human limits). The Iroquois false-face creator in the Northeast illustrates the doublings of reality through true and false twins; and Navajo Ma'ii, or Coyote Old Man, helps both to re-create the Southwest as \"first-born\" creator and to rearrange or decreate it a bit. Always messing around, he is a comic \"changing\" spirit who continues the shape shiftings, just as the Mother Earth herself, Changing Woman, rejuvenates a cyclical world \"with grace and beauty\" (so goes the ideal formula for aging among the Navajo). The particularities here are not easy to assimilate for non-Indians, steeped in the American work ethic, plain moral styles, and a Puritan exclusion of humor from serious or sacred sites (as I grew up anyway). Specifics are not exactly intertribal. Navajo and Sioux and Hopi and Crow and Chippewa aren't much unified on anything but resistance to Anglo encroachment, as Deloria notes, considering the frequency of jokes about Columbus and Custer. Still, this study focuses on the ethnic\n\nRed/White American\n\n23\n\nglue of Indi'n humor. Some of the broader continuities and overlaps should dispel the antimyth that Indians have no humor. The tribal specifics of cases over time and terrain indicate just the opposite. Indians laugh with special significance among themselves—from the traditional Blackfeet Dung Suitor to James Welch's farting horse in Winter in the Blood (1974), from puckish Cheyenne jumping mice to shifty-eyed Paiute ravens, from pigeon-toed Chumash coyotes all the way to Louise Erdrich's lyric feminist humor in modern fiction and Momaday's wisecracking peyote priest, Tosamah, in House Made of Dawn (1968). To unify, to purge, to regenerate, Northrop Frye says in Anatomy of Criticism (1957), is to enact the muses of spring, the three fates of the comic spirit. These remain particularly native to America, Indian in origin, perhaps universally human. \"One of the best ways to understand a people,\" Deloria writes, \"is to know what makes them laugh\" (Custer 146). Indi'n humor may well be an undiscovered index to America's first peoples. In 1931, the year that John Neihardt listened to Nick Black Elk, Constance Rourke heard our national character in a distinctly \"American\" humor.4 Rourke felt that American humor tapped resilient and liberated resources, a frontier courage to face \"west\" toward the uncharted, the wild, the Indian in America. Out west, Vine Deloria, Jr.'s premises in Custer Died For Your Sins anticipate the audacity (and red humor) of his second tract, the claim that our native God Is Red (1973). Deloria's own work and life natively show that law, religion, literature, social science, and the comic spirit can have a common axis in Indi'n humor—an integrative spirit from Indian America—and reach a reading public outside academia. No stranger to theory or humor, Deloria writes and thinks with the best of quick-shot, trick-riding, literary marksmen. The art of his native humor provides telling examples of Freud's \"economy\" of release in dreams, jokes, and poetry. \"What did you call this country before Columbus?\" the Indian buff recycles the quip in Custer. \"Ours.\" It's a good thing Columbus wasn't \"looking for Turkey,\" Deloria testified in the Omaha federal court hearings on the 1868 Red Cloud Treaty. A submerged, then \"released,\" comic voice speaks here for \"the people.\" Americans-at-large these days are still looking for what to call this country: Is it finally ours, \"we the people,\" as Iroquis means? How united or divided do we remain in a pluralist democracy? What do \"natives\" among us have to say about communality and continuity?\n\n24\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nDeloria's red wit is honed by a human science, candid and engaging— real things lie at stake, cultural and self-definitional at the heart of matters. Johan Huizinga calls such the agon or ludic contest of \"play.\" All this can be tapped, if not measured, in Indi'n humor. History holds some intercultural texts worth resurrecting. \"Let us examine the facts,\" Corn Tassel exhorts \"brother warriors\" when whites come to \"the forest's edge\" in 1785 to draw up a treaty with the Cherokee for peace (and land). Having invaded in the dead of night and driven the tribes into the woods, now whites want to \"talk of the law of nature and the law of nations,\" Corn Tassel notes wryly, \"and they are both against you.\"5 Observing that whites arrogantly expect Indians to adopt white laws, religion, manners, and customs, Corn Tassel urges the Cherokee to consider the \"good effect of these doctrines,\" if any, rather than \"hearing you talk about them, or reading your papers.\" Talk's cheap. Indians already have law, religion, manners, and customs that make them Cherokee. If whites want Indians to farm as they do, \"May we not, with equal propriety, ask, why the white people do not hunt and live as we do?\" Corn Tassel's contrary logic carries the appeal of plain talk with an ironic dialogical twist: we are not \"your slaves. We are a separate people!\" Indian nations have been free-standing for millennia. Still, the \"great God of Nature\" has placed two peoples \"in different situations,\" Corn Tassel says. The best treaty here would be drawn from coexistent cultural tolerance; xenophobic arrogance makes no sense in either direction. Nature has stocked white lands \"with cows, ours with buffalo; yours with hog, ours with bear; yours with sheep, ours with deer.\" Your God has given whites the \"advantage,\" Corn Tassel concedes with no little irony, since \"your cattle are tame and domestic while ours are wild and demand not only a larger space for range, but art to hunt and kill them.\" The comic binocularity here—one profile straight-faced in the \"facts,\" the other side strategic in the survivalist \"art\" of humor—carries the argument for Corn Tassel two centuries later, historical conquest notwithstanding. Homo ludens, Huizinga argues, is Homo at his best—and she's even better-humored, feminists like Paula Gunn Allen (The Sacred Hoop [1986]) and Rayna Green (That's What She Said [1984]) reply with an Indi'n twist. \"What do you do for poison oak?\" a student in a large auditorium once asked Mabel McKay, the Cache Creek Pomo elder, interviewed as a native healer. \"Calamine Lotion,\" she shot back. When a middle-aged Stanford woman asked for \"spirit\" tips on how\n\nRed/White American\n\n25\n\nMabel stayed so youthful, the medicine woman suggested dying her hair.6 Louise Erdrich's richly humorous fictions set feminist arts into ludic play beside the writings of James Welch and N. Scott Momaday, suggesting \"humorous\" gender differences to be respected among Indians. Whereas Euroamerican women have sought equality for a century, tribal women were seldom disenfranchised in their cultures. The great majority of pre-Columbian tribes, perhaps 90 percent, seem to have been matrilocal.7 Rather than \"stealing\" back the language, as Alicia Ostriker sees feminists like Adrienne Rich doing to break into mainstream American poetry,8 literary Indian women like Paula Gunn Allen may simply be voicing their native birthright. \"Being a woman cannot be demonstrated, it must be felt,\" Helene Cixous contends; \"it must make itself felt, it is the experience of a pleasure.\" But just what do French feminists like Cixous and Kristeva mean by jouissance, and can we translate the concept toward ethnic feminist humor? \"When one talks woman to you, you must respond and respond as if to an accusation,\" Cixous challenges today's reader.9 Are these defensive lines equally drawn by Native American feminists parting the Buckskin Curtain? Humor tacitly, if not openly, declares \"the other\" game to be played with. \"Play, then, is a preliminary or divertive surface-life,\" Max Eastman theorizes, \"in which success is fun, but failure funny.\" 10 From a cyclical comic perspective, no one loses if they still play the game. In addition to survival and renewal, a comic vision in these terms can be amicably competitive, even pleasurably engaging. Deloria counts coup (to touch the enemy in plains battle) most sharply on those he has most hope for—anthros, clerics, Congress, curious readers—as Custer Died For Your Sins sets up the comic realism of cultural confrontations. The potshots make both sides think, if disagreeably, then finally dialogically. Between Indians and whites, this friction reconstitutes an exchange beyond satiric diatribe, for a change. In We Talk, You Listen (1970), Deloria writes with acerbic bite on treaty violations, and historical debate takes yet another turn. Such jibes spark serious play, a form of public teasing to raise Indian-white issues. Teasing is key to Indian bonding, Deloria notes; it serves as a daily check-and-balance on tribal norms. The word \"teasing,\" as we know it in Western terms, comes from the Anglo-Saxon taesan (\"pull\" or \"pluck\"). It once meant to raise a nap on cloth; now it means to annoy and/or entertain by aggressively focusing play toward\n\n26\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nextended kin. So tribal teasing, pan-Indian style with red English, targets issues with an attention that roughs its audience affectionately, Indian-to-white. We \"permit\" the disrespect, Mary Douglas argues, as something of a familial or social agreement. It's a way of circling pain, according to Freud, of encompassing reality's \"threat\" to the ego by using that very threat to open an audience to its common, if not bonding, values. \"One\" may tease oneself in an existential or academic vacuum, but as with most things human, a cultural \"other\" makes it more fun; and three draws a crowd. Henri Bergson, in \"Rire\" (1899), adds that laughter goes in need of an echo. So when Deloria quotes Custer shouting \"Take no prisoners!\" at the Little Big Horn, or cites AIMsters (American Indian Movement stalwarts) chanting \"We Shall Overrun\" in the 1970s, or warns Black Panthers against playing \"Cowboys and Blacks\"—this red satirist is inviting \"the others\" to joust and to interact with Native America. Historically, \"whites\" invaded \"reds\" with enslaved \"blacks\" (not to mention indentured \"browns\" and \"yellows\"). The native castles— roundhouses, wickiups, tipis, igloos, hogans—were sacked, good \"goods\" stolen, all but 3 percent of the population exterminated, the remaining few \"reserved\" for posterity as endangered species. \"Indian giver\" is probably the worst joke in our popular lexicon, appearing as a term of xenophobic guilt that inverts historical fact. An entire hemisphere was taken, not to be given back, and remnant Indians survive in reserves. Carter Camp, the Osage AIM warrior, recalls that staples were always critical at the Wounded Knee military occupation in 1973— ammunition, cigarettes, and especially toilet paper went in short supply. So \"thank God\" for those six little missionary churches in the hamlet and all the stacks of shiny new Bibles printed on rice paper! There's a bite in this Indi'n humor. George Custer (who got what glory he was after) offers reverse scapegoat release for Indian bitterness, beyond the pain of historical statistics, body counts, present-day poverty, and continued suffering. Warriors grow \"too old to muss the custard anymore,\" Deloria puns on Custer's folly. The triple play Custer/mustard/custard reduces this \"hero\" to flatulent flan (as generally known, \"too old to cut the mustard\" is an old midwestern crack about \"breaking wind\"). At a literary level, Deloria's syllabic nonsense frees the mind from too much sense. The pun distances personal emotions from wounded honor, scalp-taking, our losses, their betrayals, not to mention\n\nRed/White American\n\n27\n\nfears of aging and death. Like the redness of blood, or jokes about failure, dying remains a universal for all human beings (the last joke?). So Indian-white tragedies can be alchemized through the alembic of modern red humor; intercultural differences shift toward seriously playful texts, which tell us much about ourselves, American and Native American. \"Friend and Brother!\" the Iroquois Red Jacket greets Mr. Cram of the Boston Missionary Society in 1828; the sun is bright, our eyes and ears are open and unstopped, so for a change listen. \"Brother! You say there is but one way to worship and serve the Great Spirit. If there is but one religion, why do you white people differ so much about it? Why do not all agree, as you can all read the book?\" (NAT 70). The Iroquois, too, have faiths, Red Jacket assures the missionary, but \"we never quarrel about religion.\" The slippage here—the split planes of reference, overtly innocent, covertly ironic—is the kind of grainy humor Huck Finn senses when Colonel Sherburn faces down the lynch mob, like eating bread \"that's got sand in it.\" Back in Boston, Reverend Cram declines to shake Red Jacket's hand, since \"there could be no fellowship between the religion of God and the works of the devil.\" The anthologist Peter Nabokov recounts, \"The Iroquois are said to have smiled\" (69). By 1866 Cochise, a Chiricahua Apache leader, challenges General Gordon Granger at a truce talk where the Apache are pressured to surrender to the Tularosa Reservation. \"The white people have looked for me long. I am here! What do they want? If I am worth so much why not mark when I set my foot and look when I spit\" (NAT 223). God made Apaches \"not as you,\" Cochise says, but \"born like the animals, in the dry grass, not on beds like you. This is why we do as the animals.\" Cochise reasons: \"The Apaches were once a great nation; they are now but few, and because of this they want to die and so carry their lives on their finger nails.\" Red is divided from white with bladelike irony. \"Many have been killed in battle,\" Cochise goes on. \"You must speak straight so that your words may go as sunlight to our hearts. Tell me, if the Virgin Mary has walked throughout all the land, why has she never entered the wigwam of the Apache!\" (225, italics in original). The question is sharply cut. Cochise has \"no father nor mother; I am alone in the world. No one cares for Cochise.\" He chooses to stay in his native-born mountains, rather than surrender to white incar-\n\n28\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nceration on a new reservation. \"The flies on those mountains eat out the eyes of the horses. The bad spirits live there. I have drunk of these waters and they have cooled me; I do not want to leave here\" (225). These speeches serve as scattered flints of heroic resistence over the five-hundred-year terrain of frontier collision. Even in translation, the bivalent shifts between text and context raise an undiscussed historical humor that characterizes Indian continuity yet today.\n\nTerms An onion can make people cry, but there has never been a vegetable invented to make them laugh. WILL ROGERS\n\nSome schematic scaffolding is useful here, given the plethora of data across the Buckskin Curtain and paucity of understanding on both sides. Interweaving Indian particularity and Anglo theory dialectically tacks between detail and concept, as Geertz proposes in Local Knowledge, such that we read the particular within an intercultural context and spiral toward translation in both directions. The non-Indian audience sees the parameters and partitions of its categories against the data and worldviews of native cultures. Conversely, through modes of humor so far overlooked, Indians see us trying to \"see\" them. When Navajos began acculturating baseball in the mid-nineteenth century, for example, they positioned the diamond at the four cardinal points and ran the bases in reverse. Each player got four strikes (the cardinal number), and each team was allowed only one out per inning. So Navajos took to baseball on their own terms, and with a good measure of Navajo humor played the game contrariwise.'' Arthur Koestler, in writing on comic theory, coins the term \"bisociation\" to describe \"the simultaneous correlation of an experience to two otherwise independent operative fields.\" For an artistic moment, Koestler projects, these disassociated planes fuse as \"dual association.\"12 When incongruous parts edge each other, the superimposed slippage becomes comic—that is, playfully sensical. This \"geometrical pattern of two intersecting chains\" correlates in such play as \"any mental occurrence simultaneously associated with two habitually incompatible contexts\" (IO 25, 37, italics in original). Thus we might say\n\nRed/White American\n\n29\n\nthat a kind of comic double logic intersects sets of \"others\" in gaming intercultural congruence; things coalesce playfully to \"mean.\" \"ALCOHOLIDAYS,\" Freud puns in Jokes and Their Relationship to the Unconscious (1905). In bisociation there is a game of verbal conjunction, a form of festive palimpsest. Such (de)centering verbal and intercultural texts delight an audience in the play of non-sense through logical illusion; they overlap and double, or \"bisociate,\" without fusing in reality. Hence an audience experiences release from the weight of meaning, an escape into ludic fantasy or art. Reality's emotional charges tag along to play against the ludic illusion. As Freud reminds us, \"operation successful, patient dead\" telegrams aggressive nonsense as comically diffused fear. But the experience of bisociation can shift tragically when fate closes in on a character and the slippage between operative planes shuts down. In tragedy, irreconcilables fuse agonistically, rather than playfully, and \"reality\" dramatically shifts into dread pattern revealed—Oedipus murderous at the crossroads, tragically incestuous, finally self-blinded. Differently slanted, as in Don Quixote, Moll Flanders, and Ulysses, the plot twists toward a comic series of falls from which characters emerge to play again. The ironic, reverse slippage between two sets of coordinates—before comedy releases the tension or tragedy locks it into place—generates the ambivalent frisson that tonalizes and charges both modes bisociatively. And back to classical art we witness the double-faced masks of tragic and comic muses. Certain players animate the comic mode. In his Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye cites the Tractatus Coislinianus, kin to Aristotle's Poetics, to establish three comic types: the alazons, or imposters; the eirons, or self-deprecators; and the bomolochoi, or buffoons. 13 The first two types may emerge from the origins of Greek drama, the satyr plays between the tragedies. The bisociated pairing is akin to strophic-antistrophic rhythms of characters and chorus, a binary counterpoint between alazon and eiron, which in turn generates choral voices, or \"buffoons\" who look on (the audience performing on stage). In Ethics, Aristotle adds a fourth comic type—agroikos, or churlish rustic—so that buffoon and churl counterplay the classic overstater and understaler. From this perspective, the forms of comedy seem structurally contrapuntal, innocent to ironist, fool to philosophic. \"Comedy ranges from the most savage irony,\" Frye contends, \"to the most dreamy wish-fulfillment romance,\" while remaining dramatically and generically consistent (AC 177). The comic plot can take six turns,\n\n30\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nFrye argues: (1) the \"hero\" transforms a community toward some better end; (2) escapes an irredeemable situation; (3) frees the slave within a society; or (4) the wasteland greens, and summer wins out over winter; (5) characters rise above comic chaos to look down from an ordered view on disorder below; (6) the comic (doubling) world deconstructs (a decentering humor dissolves focus) as the oracles of a darker mystery take over. Interestingly enough, an epic poem such as Dante's Cornmedia or a novel like Huckleberry Finn will satisfy all these phyla—the ultimate Western spiritual drama or American \"comedy\" within a Euroamerican ethos. But Leslie Silko's Ceremony, an analogous American Indian fiction with \"mythic\" acculturations, forgoes the first four turns in plot and touches only half the fifth level, transcendent order over disorder (patterns-in-the-stars by the time of Tayo's ceremonial revelation of his destiny). The novel vaguely approaches the sixth oracular phylum (Silko's mythic \"medicine\" changes). Perhaps Ceremony spins a ritual comedy of another kind out of a tribal context in need of translation. Lagunas seem to be stuck, more or less, with the society they've had since \"time immemorial,\" according to Grandma and the myths in the fiction; escape, linear transformation, or \"freeing the slave\" is a bit unrealistic in Grandmother's view. Still, the desert buds \"green\" (bluish-green or turquoise in Ceremony) while it seems a \"waste\" land to white ranching eyes, and the mythic journey up the mountain of the water goddess, Ts'eh, sends Tayo back down into the tribal kiva. It might be a homely return to the realistic \"mess\" we live in, as Frye says, here both godlike and \"fallen,\" or comic in a regenerative cultural sense. At any rate, with this example Frye's comic emplotments seem only a partial template for native Americanist fictions. Postmodernist theory offers some intercultural models for dialogue here. Comic deconstruction poses a seriously playful way to say that things look different from variable human perspectives, heroic to demonic to humorous. From Aristotle, Plato, and Cicero through Descartes, Hobbes, Bacon, and Bergson, Arthur Koestler finds a Western tradition of \"degradation\" theorized in the laughter of Hobbes's Leviathan: \"at all times a component of malice, of debasement of the other fellow, and of aggressive-defensive self-assertion\" (IO 56). This theory of \"superiority\" tallies with Bergson's ideas on the comic as social corrective or Freud's sense of Witz (joking wit) in the aggressive desire of the sexual drive. If such trickster aggression, indeed, surfaces\n\nRed/White American\n\n31\n\nin Indian comic contexts, it seems mediated toward mythic play, social harmony, and ceremonial pleasure. \"One of the things that you will notice is that often in the stories there will be a movement toward a balance—the funny with the serious,\" Silko says of Laguna tales, \"—and this goes back, this balance and this inclusion, the all-inclusive dynamic goes back to the Creation, and back to one of the basic Pueblo religious concepts.\"14 The balanced \"comic\" world, as an Indian given, is not always so perceived in Anglo terms. Far from being a wasteland, the Southwest from a Pueblo perspective is home in Silko's Ceremony. Dry and hot (sun) has its rightful lower place (desert home) in balance with wet and cool (rain) on the sacred height (blue mountain). Indian ceremony as \"comic\" pattern is seldom linear escape or structural transformation or social liberation, but more a celebrative acceptance of what-is, a curve back home. This longer comic sense of the given-at-home pervades tribal cultures. \"'At Laguna I have an uncle who's very young,\" Leslie Silko told Laura Coltelli; \"he's only ten years older, he's just like a brother, and his wife and his sisters are very brilliant. They've traveled and gone places to school. They've all come back. They have funny ways of saying things; they like to laugh and tell horrifying stories, but the way they tell them is really funny, and you're laughing.\"15 The interview continued: Coltelli: Humor is one of the main features of modern American Indian literature, central to the real meaning of the story itself. Is there a difference between the use of humor in the old Indian stories and in the contemporary ones? Silko: You know I haven't really thought about whether there's a difference. I'm so attuned to seeing the many similarities. Same thing, referring to the same incident, especially areas in justice, loss of land, discrimination, racism, and so on, that there's a way of saying it so people can kind of laugh or smile . . . so you can keep their interest, so you can keep talking to them. Oftentimes these things are told in a humorous way. Even punning—you know, the people at Laguna have such a delight with language. ... So that in English they like to make puns, and they know a little Spanish, or a little Navajo, or a little anything. So their sheer delight in such things, that goes on and always has—that's an area where I can't see that there's been any big shift. (146-47)\n\nThus \"humor\" seems a more apt term for discussing Native American aesthetics than Frye's \"pregeneric\" comic forms. Compared with\n\n32\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nWestern linearity, Native American patterns appear more cyclical, periodic, and composite—less historically progressive, less personally transformational, less structurally end-stopped. Ceremony remains a case in point. In a mythic perspective, nothing has changed by the end. The protagonist accepts his mixed-blood or \"breed\" position as a transitional role; the \"hero\" does not arrogate power individually, so much as the \"healer\" takes a tribal position in relation to a common setting. And structurally the novel does not so much end as simply suspend interest in the action (Grandma has heard all this before). The story has talked itself out, the joke has sputtered, while Grandmother Spider, the creatrix, stitches away in the back of Southwest Indian perspectives. The traditional weave on Indian looms is double, as with overlapping patterns in fine Navajo rugs, yet contrasting designs on adjoining sides of the rug are made of one tightly woven thread. This creates a dually human work of art, a daily necessity when nights chill sun-baked desert bones. Grandmother Spider's weaving brings and keeps the people home. Humor—cognate with \"humus,\" or soil, and \"human,\" or person— implies a personality at ease and grounded in its own identity. The term assumes a perspective on things, as it were, one that enjoys flexibility. \"Humours\" in the late Middle Ages conjure up the fluids of personality—literally the flow of coloring spirits, the protean life force of water. Humors thus suggest the fluid resilience of life itself. Humor today might be thought of as the vision or psyche (\"spirit\") behind a specific joke; it fills in the interstices and lingers after a gathering has broken up, even laps about a room when the jokers go home. Whereas humor indicates the psychological (personal) and cultural (historical) tenor of a situation, a joke per se exists as a social act or event, a specific instance of humor-in-action. So, too, wit implies an aspect of character—a presence of mind, quickness, even quirkiness.16 Comedy, finally, codes a generic index for aesthetic or ideational categories— \"the comic\" is used here as a classificatory term. \"Divine Comedy,\" for example, implies a Christian context for a belief that all things work out for the best, that \"God\" knows all in His heaven and ordains earth as His province. With a Mother Earth corrective to Father Sky, Native American ceremonies so, too, project a faith in a right world or \"good\" reality. This implies belief in the order of things, an acceptance of what-is as naturally \"right\"—indeed, spiritually sanctioned in this world of the living. Then, too, there is room for making\n\nRed/White American\n\n33\n\nmistakes. Joking, wit, and comedy appear as socially specific, personally characteristic, and generically contextual evidences of cultural humor. They strike the human tuning fork of a tribal faith in survival and success, despite obstacles or momentary loss. As used in feminist Indian literature, humor may even be a distant cousin to \"home\"; at least in the popular lexicon, humor and home strike the ear as kin. And humor has something to do, surely, with a grounded sense of home, a domestic pivot. If home is secure, or relatively certain in one's psyche, regardless of how far \"away\" the homeless wander, humor is not far away. In tribal Greece three millennia back, when some two thousand cultural groups were settled in the Americas, Odysseus's twenty years at war and sea, always \"homing,\" are charted by a storytelling full of banquet goodwill, marriage proposals, and endless puns (\"How odd to see you,\" strangers say to the homeless hero, and puns from \"odd\" to \"ode\" are played on like musical chimes). No less than Navajo origin myths or Iroquois creation cycles, Greek epics register a homing sense of humor during times of unrest, as the story summons father home. Odysseus grows too old to compete physically with the younger athletes and warriors; his game, or \"odd,\" leg hobbles him, but adds a twist to his sense of humor, and it sets up his need to outwit the odds of physical engagement. So Odysseus tells stories, jokes, and tall tales of monsters, witches, and wild beasts. The fantastic can be comically gripping through its exaggerations, as the twentieth-century magical realists Borges and Marquez in other Americas, or Kundera and Calvino in Europe, reimagine the given. Hence in some cases, the line from Homer to our homes may not be broken—from homecoming epic humor to the contemporary West, from tribal Greece to Native Americans today. The sailor and the farmer, Walter Benjamin says in Illuminations (1955), have always been our tribal narrators—storytellers coming or staying home. Certainly, the Parry—Lord thesis of oral-formulaic composition in Homeric times also applies to extended Trickster tellings, from Algonkian clans to Zuni kivas. And the improvisator, the singer of tales, slings a joke in his quiver to sidestep pointless combat. Humor may be a key to the bricolage of extended singing. An audience sticks around longer with laughter to ease the listening—indeed, to sharpen the spirit, to loosen the ear, and to wake up our attending. Aside from its tragic counterpart (draw blood, draw a crowd), a comic come-on seems the quickest way\n\n34\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nto attract and hold an audience, then persuade it to come back paying attention. Jim Pepper, the Kaw-Creek jazz saxophonist, tells the story of his Indian and white names in a 1988 interview: My great grandfather was a big man, a big tall strong cat. Big Indian. And he didn't speak English. . . . I have the same name he does, Hung-a-che-eda, which means Flying Eagle. That name could have been phonetically written out, or he could have had a translation of his name, or a name of his choice. His favorite taste was this whiskey, James Pepper whiskey. So he named himself after whiskey, which is a bittersweet story. You can still get that whiskey down in Colorado and Texas. It's a small company. I saw a bottle one time in a bar and tried to buy it, but they wouldn't sell it to me. Those were the kinds of stories my grandfather told me. He never sat there and said the Great Spirit formed this or that from an eagle turd. None of that shit.17\n\nWhite Ideas Is it possible that love, hope, faith, laughter, confidence, and the will to live have therapeutic value? NORMAN COUSINS, Anatomy of an Illness\n\nAt the risk of further thickening the stew, we turn to twentieth-century theory, from psychoanalytic ideas at the top of the century to deconstructive intercultural projections at the bottom. Sigmund Freud, the century's psychological pioneer, fixated on joking and humor. Indeed, when Freud's close friend and associate Wilhelm Fliess read the proofs of The Interpretation of Dreams in the autumn of 1899, he was disturbed by the many jokes. Piqued by his arch colleague, Freud read Theodor Lipps's Komik undHumor and set out to define Witz in its relationship to the psychoanalysis of dreams. Witz, James Strachey admits, hardly translates as \"joking,\" but eighteenthcentury scholars were no closer in defining it as \"genteel ingenuity.\" Wit-at-large connotes the ability to make things up, to create on the go, to \"cobble\" reality. In its Viennese context, Witz suggests an alertness, a quick state of mind, more than gentility or the \"joke\" as comic relief. Thus Freud begins Jokes and Their Relationship to the Unconscious (1905) with a German philosopher defining joking as \"playful judgment.\" He ties joking mental play to finding \"hidden similarities,\" cites Lipps on the concept of \"bewilderment and illumination\" in joking\n\nRed/White American\n\n35\n\n(deriddling, depuzzling, or decoding jokes), and sets out to track the \"organic whole\" of comic disjecta membra: \"activity, relation to the content of our thoughts, the characteristic of playful judgment, the coupling of dissimilar things, contrasting ideas, 'sense in nonsense,' the succession of bewilderment and enlightenment, the bringing forward of what is hidden, and the peculiar brevity of wit.\"18 It's a tall order, even for Freud. Most theoreticians concur that joking involves some kind of insight, perception, or understanding (standing \"under,\" Joyce reminds us), when we move from bevw'Werment to a moment of illumination, as Freud underscores. This enlightenment prisms from wild to tamed, arcs from questionable to answerable. \"I think you had better put the Indians on wheels,\" Red Dog laconically counseled commissioners to the Sioux in 1876, the year of the Battle of Little Big Horn and the U.S. centennial. \"Then you can run them about whenever you wish\" (NAT 184). Over a hundred thousand Indians from twenty-eight eastern tribes had been \"removed\" west of the Mississippi River, with thirty thousand dying en route. The Winnebagos were \"relocated\" no fewer than five times in the mid-nineteenth century. So how does a non-Indian reader react to Red Dog's comment? The \"bewilderment\" of dispossession, satirically framed, shifts toward the ironic \"illumination\" of an unsettling double perspective in the image of \"Indians on wheels.\" The ironic transition from one plane of unknowing curiosity (a-waze-ment or decentered interest) to knowing clarity jars loose Koestler's \"bisociation.\" The doubling association superimposes disparate levels that overlap in the joke's twin templates, still incongruously played as one. As a result we see similarities and differences, Freud notes as he stresses the slippage in joke perception; the joker credits himself and his audience with decoding like and, especially, unlike designs. Joking is thus layered or bivalent understanding, an act of \"ironic\" perception that bisociates disparate sets of data. Things momentarily, if not ultimately, make sense. This is all a mind at play, knowing it is playing, not \"really\" worrying about making sense, or if judging and determining the \"real,\" doing so in the liberating spirit of improvisation. But the Reconstructive aspect remains. The play element and the joke make sense non-sensically, so that we get it both ways—not too seriously, so as not to wreck the playful construct on the rocks of reality, and yet seriously enough to engage the mind in Mwpuzzling the real. Red\n\n36\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nDog gives us something to reflect on: \"I think you had better put the Indians on wheels.\" So joking requires wit to decode reality. It seems to relieve us temporarily of the burdens of the serious, while honing our ability to \"read\" the world. In dreaming we do this \"sub\"consciously, Freud argues, and in art we create more consciously with play. Michel Foucault, in The Order of Things, defines the poet as one \"who, beneath the named, constantly expected differences, rediscovers the buried kinships between things, their scattered resemblances.\"19 The comic slant to such poetic kinships would italicize the scattered resemblances between things (\"metaphor,\" poetry's depth charge, literally means to \"bear\" from one place to another). Jokes bear the weight of differences in bisociated coincidences, while the \"comic\" plane remains an artistic displacement. \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe,\" the Belgian surrealist painter Rene Magritte wrote below a picture of a pipe—a doubling semiology, yes, but most critically a framed displacement with a \"pipe\" that is not a pipe (hence comic \"bisociation,\" or having it both ways). In a joke, then, displacement in the Freudian sense becomes framing in Erving Goffman's sociocultural rubric: a socially framed \"play\" sphere apart from the \"real\" world, or at least playfully relieved of its strictures and burdens. Intercultural exchange charges a \"liminal\" zone of bisociative play. For example, when the Jicarilla Apache discovered tlatsizis, or the whiteman's \"buttocks bags,\" in the nineteenth century, they asked, \"What do you put in?\" \"Why, you throw your buttocks in it,\" came the answer. So they tried hopping and leaping off cliffs into the bags, to no avail. An Apache observer noted: \"Then they tied the pants around themselves, but the leg part hung down behind. Some put the pants on backward; some had the legs hanging down in front. That's the way they went around. They put the shirts on. Some wore them in the right way; some put them on backward. The hats they used for carrying water\" (NAT 54). This buffoonery serves up pure parody of \"the other,\" a kind of childlike delight in the strangeness of strange customs. Humor here is an amazed play released in the exposed overlap and slippage between cultures. The viewer's comic insight discharges as laughter, while binary patterns stay bifurcated (though for the moment artfully bisociated). Humor remains parenthetical to the \"real,\" yet grounded realistically in differences, and still distinct from metaphor in not pressing to \"make sense.\" The poetry of jokes can reduplicate as a kind of\n\nRed/ White American\n\n37\n\nsacred clowning, a mediation of play and reality, as with the Sioux heyoka or Pueblo koshare. This is holy fooling in the presence of spiritual power. Fiction releases humor seriously through such play. In March 1886 the archaeologist Adolf Bandelier finished the first draft of Die Koshare (The Delight Makers), on Pueblo cultures and clowns. A century later, Barbara Babcock described the work as \"a comic dialogue constructed of bits and pieces of cultural debris,\" first published in German and English in 1890, the year that U.S. soldiers massacred three hundred Sioux men, women, and children at Wounded Knee Creek. \"Die Koshare was a seven-year imaginative effort to come to terms with that which was most alien, most other. In contrast to [Bandelier's] 'scientific' writing, fiction gave him the license to indulge in wish fulfillment, to recreate a very different cultural world that all the research in the world could not put back together or enable him to enter, and to talk about himself in relation to that Otherness.\"20 Babcock traces this \"monstrous jumble held together by an authorial presence\" to the powers of ritual Pueblo clowns: Less than a month after discovering El Rito de los Frijoles, Bandelier first encountered Cochiti clowns, whom he referred to as Koshare or entremeseros—the latter a Spanish term denoting those who perform farces between the acts of a play. Among the Keres themselves, these sacred clowns associated with the Turquoise Kiva are called Ku sha 'li. Their equivalent appears throughout the Rio Grande Pueblos. Among the Tewa they are called Kossa; among the Tiwa, Black Eyes or chifunane. His reaction to these nearly naked black and white apparitions with corn husk horns, creating a pandemonium of disorder and delight, was one of disgust, fascination, and characteristically detailed description. (\"Ritual Undress\" 191)\n\nBandelier's scenario of comic pandemonium initiated non-Indian readers into ceremonial Pueblo play, even if the Indian sense of humor would quickly be forgotten against the tragic stereotypes in Western folklore. Early in the twentieth century, at San Ildefonso, Alfonso Roybal (Awa Tsireh) was painting clowns crawling over rainbows, chased by turkeys, riding bulls, playing leapfrog, devouring watermelons, and helping Santa Claus hoist his bag of gifts. Today, Nora Naranjo-Morse from Taos and Santa Clara sculpts ceremonial clowns from clay: \"Koshare clowns, Pueblo women, village scenes, one-of-akind figurines, fetishes and animals,\" Stephen Trimble writes, \"all with\n\n38\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\nhumor, affection, and an abstracted and refined sophistication. Nora came to clay in her twenties, in 1976, after leaving New Mexico to sell firecrackers in South Dakota and to sort mail in Washington, D.C.\"21 And Barbara Babcock now travels and talks in performance with Helen Cordero, Cochiti creator of \"the Storyteller doll,\" whose ongoing tradition goes back through sacred fools.22 \"Pueblo clowns,\" Babcock writes of Bandelier's \"delight\" makers (a fey misnomer derived from his friend Frank Gushing), \"are among the most powerful of ritual personages, mediating between the worlds of the spirits and the living; controlling weather and fertility; associated both with curing and with warfare; given punitive and policing functions, particularly against witches; and in fact managing and supervising many of the ceremonies they appear to disrupt\" (\"Ritual Undress\" 192). There is something here in all clowns, many jokes, and much humor that I would call a comic double valence: it involves \"reversible\" play or reduplication with a twist. This double valence compounds the simple and riddles the surface artfully. It may be an all-too-human, bipedal fondness for having things more than one way—comic options, as it were. The anthropologist Frank Gushing, case in point, crosscostumed as a non-Indian Zuni koshare. The Pueblo \"striped\" him black-on-white with big rings around his eyes. Now in some unifocal sense this seems extraordinary and outrageous—a non-Zuni field researcher from the Bureau of American Ethnography in the Pueblo priesthood! Yet in another sense, bifocally comic, he is what he is: a \"white-faced\" clown, striped, as Dennis Tedlock suggests, in mockery of his incessant note taking.23 Gushing self-parodies the white man's penchant for writing things down, rather than remembering or doing them. Whether through his insistence and apparent sincerity, or Zuni curiosity and graciousness, Gushing was initiated into the sacred clown society with full comic honors, a holy fool among men. Yet the double valence makes him clown of a clown: white man in \"white face,\" striped or lined for writing (word-walking) all over private Zuni culture. He is coded strange, signed dangerous, caricatured comic: no Zuni could miss the message. Gushing thus enters Zuni doubly marked, comic to a second power—at once a \"clown\" and a white man clowning around with sacred tribal humor. This kind of italicized bisociation—having things both ways, sacred and profane—characterizes much ceremonial Indian humor, many good jokes, and every clown who \"plays\" at permitted disrespect, especially in the presence of the\n\nRed/White American\n\n39\n\ngods and concerned tribal audiences. Such play appears to be a place that Indians and non-Indians can don or drop the mask and intermingle without bitterness. This type of comic ceremony offers an ;7-lusion or \"in-play,\" as Huizinga shows in Homo Ludens (1944), where \"others\" play together at their best. To play seriously toward a structural, dialogical paradigm (a la Claude Levi-Strauss at one extreme and Julia Kristeva at the other) we can further plumb the pan-Indian joke about the invasion of America. \"What did you call this country before the whites came?\" a Mount Rushmore tourist again asks a modern-day Sioux. \"Ours,\" quips the fine feathered friend. Deloria's jibe, recycled in Gerald Vizenor's film Warriors of Orange, illustrates what I would call the gaming congruence of a good joke. A simplified joking formula helps to clarify the point in terms of a dialogic equation. The algebraic formula for the hypotenuse of a right triangle ( a2 + b2 = c2) bears a certain symmetry, as well as transformational energy crossing from one side to another.24 So change and balance, transformation and stability, constellate here as counterweights to dissimilarity and similarity, the bisociative polarities. The \"equal to\" sign indicates the active transference—the proportionate exchange between dissimilarities. We might diagram the comic equation thus: What did you call this country . . . before the whites came? = Ours. Or to abstract the algebra: primal land + invasion = predispossession common title (over half our states bear Indian names). The lead-in question naively implies the \"mystery\" of aboriginal tongues and minds, followed by a tacit admission of the post-Columbian present, answered curtly by a collective tribal pronoun, \"ours.\" The joke carries the bicultural context of Anglo-Indian rifts. Mary Douglas calls its \"context\" the social field of comic energy, the mediative dialogue between us and them, as Koestler speaks of \"bisociative\" comic irony in overlapping mental planes. This all turns on the gaming congruence of a simple \"American\" monosyllable, \"ours.\" From native perspectives, it serves as a footnote to what Francis Jennings has called the non-Indian \"invasion\" and Tzvetan Todorov the \"conquest\" of America. Structurally, the dialogue joke best illustrates gaming congruence. \"What does a dyslexic agnostic not believe in?\" a student quizzed me on an exam. \"Dog.\" In play, one part balances with another inversely; one mind-set transfers into a second, which results in a double perspective, a bisociative puzzle. It is a difference, always held in congruent\n\n40\n\nINDI'N HUMOR\n\ntension, that divides the parts, while they reach across the transformational zone. \"How is Halloween celebrated at the Bureau of Indian Affairs?\" Vee Salabiye asks. \"Trick or Treaty.\" This arcing \"between\" produces the joke, the either/both \"bisociation\" of likeness among dissimilar components. It is a slippage that implies connection. A joke supposes something coyly or conditionally (the gaming congruence). It predicates that it is not what it might be. For example, when the Lakota healer John (Fire) Lame Deer as rodeo clown dons the red wig, \"babies' bar\" pillowy breasts, and calico dress of \"Alice Jitterbug,\" he transsexually (and in the sacred clown's role of winkle) goes out to save men's lives. He plays but he is not a woman: he isn't what he might be. In Lakota the word win-kte is the conditional feminine, literally \"woman could-be.\" A man acts as a woman in binary metaphors of gender, some of the oldest jokes in drama. John Fire's humor suggests that it's okay to stretch the human definitions, play \"the other,\" be momentarily what a man is not, get a good laugh, and get away as \"Alice Jitterbug\" rescuing cowboys from brahma bulls. In fact, this may be a healthy imagining \"of\" the other to see oneself from another perspective. For in such play, the rules remain flexible and \"disrespect\" comes conditionally; that is, the game is \"permitted\" while everyone goes along with the anti-rite. Indeed, such playing with the boundaries—or \"stretching,\" the Apache tell Keith Basso—bonds the people in terms of their elastic social agreements. For this joking acts out the kinetic processes of tribe and gender, bonding through space and time—never fixed, always newly assumed, tested by conditions, ready to be played out. Such flexibility remains capable of what Freud in Jokes terms \"playful judgment.\" This bisociative humor tests tradition and keeps it honestly human. A note on cultural difference: When Levi-Strauss concludes in The Savage Mind (1962) that \"all\" intellects, expecially Stone Age ones, are binary, or Freud categorizes all jokes as economic mental releases from wounded feeling, Western theoreticians usurp the particulars of intercultural pluralism. What does Freud mean by \"economy\" in joking \"expenditure,\" and does this obviate psychic play? Is comedy the world over fiscally conservative? Does the ego ever relax? To adapt Freud's analogy, could humor turn on a kinetic exchange of psychic currencies, more cash flow than ledger entry? \"Why is semen white and urine yellow?\" the irrepressible Deloria wrote to me. \"So the Chippewas can tell whether they're coming or going.\"25 Freud's economy is surcharged\n\nRed/White American\n\n41\n\nwith scatology in the joke, serving a disrespect played among friendly tribal enemies; whereas the verbal formula is certainly \"economical,\" the words tap the prodigal stirrings of an emotive psyche-in-motion. Joking seems to spark an exchange between equationai complexes of feelings and thoughts—gaming congruences that temporarily play with similarity across a dissonantly charged, psychically wild field. When cultures collide, jokes mediate playfully, permitting the differences. We all may be capable of a sense of humor—and joking seems as endemic to human culture as sex or song—but why do individuals laugh, or not, in given cultural settings? Some subjects—sex, death, excrement, eating, money, mothers-in-law, and the gods—appear a priori capable of comedy, though not always in proper or mixed company. Anything humanly surcharged, it seems, carries a potential for humor. If it matters or moves us, it may be funny, because it is so essential. Where certain concepts or objects seem to have banked human interest, Freud's \"expenditure\" theories make sense. Jokes give us returns on the unrepressed energies of childhood; comedy doubles our interest in given and projected assets; humor amortizes suffering. But what determines what we laugh at?—a specific situation, the post-Freudian ethnologist Mary Douglas holds, shaped by social context, seasoned in history, compacted with others. Without cultural setting we have no permissions (or restrictions), no disrespects (or affections) to trigger our humor. A libido needs a superego to keep the psyche honest, Freud posits. So a citizen inversely enlists a clown to ground his social seriousness, and Indian wisdom is beholden to Trickster to keep the lessons conditionally open to human revision. What of art in this discussion? Novels grant us culture-specific contexts for such theoretical, intercultural questions: time, place, character, community, event, symbolic subtext. With such fictive data we may see how, in Winter in the Blood, James Welch writes for a generic, middleaged Blackfeet man caught today between tradition and town; but certainly Welch does not speak for all males, flatters few females, and represents fewer Pueblos. Momaday's House Made of Dawn presents Abel's confused sense of time, culture, and place in a postwar Southwest, Jemez Pueblo to Los Angeles, but he does not give us Erdrich's mothering metis (mixed-blood) sense of Turtle Mountain in Love Medicine (1984).
