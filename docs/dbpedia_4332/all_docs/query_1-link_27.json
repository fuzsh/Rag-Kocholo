        "text": "Delaware, OH — Leading owners Mickey and Sylvia Burke have been selected as the 36th Little Brown Jug Wall of Fame honorees by the Delaware County Fair.\n\nThe Burke’s are the principals of Burke Racing Stable who have owned a pair of Little Brown Jugs champs – Filibuster Hanover (2017) and Limelight Beach (2014) – and four Jugette queens – Warrawee Ubeaut (2019), Sassa Hanover (2015), Darena Hanover (2012) and Western Graduate (2007).\n\nMickey started driving harness horses as a hobbyist in 1956, campaigning around the fair circuits of Ohio and Pennsylvania, all while operating a successful car dealership in Western Pennsylvania for several decades.\n\nAfter selling the dealership in 1981, Mickey and his wife Sylvia started ‘full-time’ in the harness racing business. Between 1991 and 2008, Mickey was credited with 3,167 training wins and $35.5 million in earnings.\n\nMickey and Sylvia have five children, three of which are active daily in the sport. In 2009, Mickey turned his training operation over to his son, Ron, and Mickey, Jr. and Michelle oversee the operations of their Washington, PA\n\nComing into this year, Burke Racing Stable have entered 23 horses in the Little Brown Jug, winning $1.2 million in purses. Their success isn’t limited to the three-year-old colt classic. They have also won 10 heats of the Jugette, an Old Oaken Bucket, three Standardbred’s and seventeen Ohio Breeders Championship events.\n\n“We are extremely excited to welcome the Burke’s onto the Little Brown Jug Wall of Fame,” said Chip Thomson, chair of the Wall of Fame Committee. “They have been strong supporters of our events and we wish them continued success.”\n\nThe Burke’s will be presented the Wall of Fame plaque during the 2021 Little Brown Jug week (September 19-23).\n\nPhoto: Mickey and Sylvia Burke flank the great Foiled Again at his induction into the Harness Racing Hall of Fame."
