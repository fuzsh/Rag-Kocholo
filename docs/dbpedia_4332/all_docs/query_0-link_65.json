        "text": "FLORIDA THOROUGHBRED BREEDERS’ AND OWNERS’ ASSOCIATION Lonny T. Powell, CEO Tammy A. Gantt, AVP Membership Services & Events www.ftboa.com Congratulations to all the Eclipse Winners from all our Eclipse Winners 24552 An adaptation of original Remi Bellocq art\n\n100 The 53rd Annual Eclipse Awards, presented by FanDuel TV, John Deere, Keeneland, and The Jockey Club, and produced by the NTRA By David Grening In 2022, Cody’s Wish and his bond with a young man stricken with a rare genetic disorder gave racing its feel-good story of the year. Somewhat overlooked was the horse’s race record, which included four wins from five starts and a victory in the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile. While the bond between Cody’s Wish and Cody Dorman remained a major story in 2023, Cody’s Wish earned headlines for his supreme talent, which could very well carry him to an Eclipse Award as North America’s top older dirt male horse, leading male sprinter, and possibly Horse of the Year. In 2023, Cody’s Wish repeated as winner of the Grade 1 Big Ass Fans Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile, narrowly fending off the late run of Preakness winner National Treasure and withstanding an inquiry into a bumping incident in the stretch to earn the victory. That was just one of three Grade 1 triumphs for Cody’s Wish and four victories overall in 2023. In May, he won the Churchill Downs Stakes by 4 3/4 lengths over Hoist the Gold, a horse would come back and win two graded stakes in the fall including the Grade 2 Cigar Mile. In June, Cody’s Wish was the dominant 3 1/4-length winner of the Hill ‘n’ Dale Metropolitan Handicap versus arguably the deepest field in any race all year. The horses Cody’s Wish defeated in the Met Mile, won Grade 1 races in 2023 such as the Longines Breeders’ Cup Classic, Whitney, Awesome Again, and Carter; and Grade 2 stakes such as the Suburban, Cigar Mile, Woodward, Santa Anita Sprint Championship, and Phoenix. Cody’s Wish, a 5-year-old son of Curlin owned and bred by Godolphin Racing and trained by Bill Mott, proved to have limitations as he could only manage a third-place finish behind White Abarrio in the Whitney going 1 1/8 miles at Saratoga. But he bounced back with a workmanlike victory in the Grade 2 Vosburgh at Aqueduct and then his gutsy win in the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile. “It’s the icing on the cake. You couldn’t imagine a better ending,” Mott said after the Dirt Mile. “You know, wow, he’s done everything we’ve asked him to do. We were a little skeptical about the mile and an eighth in the Whitney, but he’s done everything else. You look at his record, you can’t fault him.” Over the last two seasons, Cody’s Wish went 8 for 10 and finished his career with 11 wins from 16 starts. While the Cody’s Wish story had a happy ending on the track, there was a sad one away from it. Cody Dorman, just one month shy of his 18th birthday, died on the flight home to Kentucky the day after the Breeders’ Cup. The bond he had with the horse, who would put his head in his lap when he saw him, likely contributed to Cody Dorman living to almost 18. In a statement issued the day after Cody Dorman’s passing, his father, Kelly, said, “The joy that his interactions with Cody’s Wish have brought him the last five years is indescribable.” For the racing industry, they’ll be unforgettable.

Elite Power snuck up on nobody in 2023, raising his game to another level, running some of the fastest races of the year and capping off his campaign with a repeat victory in the Grade 1 Qatar Racing Breeders’ Cup Sprint. While his four sprint victories from five starts, including two Grade 1 successes, will most likely earn him a second straight Eclipse Award as champion sprinter, those powerful performances also were good enough to earn him a berth as a finalist in the older dirt male category. A 5-year-old son of Curlin owned by Juddmonte and trained by Bill Mott, Elite Power began his 2023 campaign in Saudi Arabia – home country to the principal interests of Juddmonte – where he beat fellow American speedster Gunite by 3 3/4 lengths in the Group 3 Riyadh Dirt Sprint in February. Upon Elite Power’s return from the Middle East, Mott gave him a break and didn’t bring him back fully cranked for the Grade 2 True North at Belmont Park. Still, he was good enough to win it, beating California invader Anarchist by 1 3/4 lengths. In Saratoga, Elite Power might have run the best race any sprinter ran all year when he reeled in a seemingly home-free Gunite by a head in the Grade 1 Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap. It ran his overall winning streak to eight. “He got on his belly,” Mott said. “It was probably one of the most impressive performances I saw at Saratoga.” Gunite exacted a measure of revenge in the Grade 1 Forego, getting away with a relatively soft pace and defeating Elite Power by 1 1/4 lengths in the seven-furlong race. Elite Power and Gunite met for a fourth time in the Breeders’ Cup Sprint, and Elite Power, taking advantage of a swift pace, rallied from next to last under Irad Ortiz Jr. to defeat Gunite by 1 1/2 lengths. “It’s a difficult job to keep a horse going year after year,” Mott said. “To come back and win two Breeders’ Cups in a row says a lot about the durability of the horse and the luck that I have. We were lucky enough to have him, and he’s had a great career.” Elite Power, who was bred by Alpha Delta Stables LLC and purchased for $900,000 at the 2019 Keeneland September yearling sale, finished his career with nine wins from 13 starts and $3,775,711 in purse earnings. In 2024, he will stand his first year at stud at Juddmonte in Lexington, Ky. “Really, I have to thank Bill and all his staff at doing an absolutely masterful job in managing the horse and keeping him [sharp] because when this horse came good, by golly, did he stay good,” Juddmonte’s manager Garrett O’Rourke said after the Breeders’ Cup. “He’s gone out good now.” Elite Power Own: Juddmonte Ch. h. 5 (Feb) Sire: Curlin (Smart Strike) $225,000 Dam:Broadway's Alibi (Vindication) Br: Alpha Delta Stables, LLC (Ky) Tr: Mott William I(54 10 2 7 .19) 2023:(649 103 .16) Life 13 9 1 1 $3,775,711 111 2023 5 4 1 0 $2,370,000 111 2022 6 5 0 1 $1,398,380 101 0 0 0 0 $0 - D.Fst 12 8 1 1 $3,583,211 111 Wet(426) 1 1 0 0 $192,500 108 Synth(335) $0 Turf(288) 0 0 0 0 $0 - Dst(0) 0 0 0 0 $0 - 4ä23=11SA fst 6f 21© :44¦ :56§1:08¦ 3ÎBCSprint-G1 111 7 /8 4 7¨õ 3¦ô 3¦ô 1¦ô Ortiz I Jr 126 *1.70 99= 04 Elite Power¦ô Guniteô Nakatomi¦ 4w, reeled in foes 26Ý23= 7Sar fst 7f 23 :46¦1:09¨1:21§ 4ÎForego-G1 98 3 /5 3 3§ 3¦ô 2¦ô 2¦ö Ortiz I Jr 124 *.75 95= 10 Gunite¦ö Elite Power© High Oak§õ Ins turn,ask1/4,chased 29Û23= 8Sar slyø 6f 22¨ :45§ :57¦1:09¦ 3ÎAGVndbtH-G1 108 4 /7 2 6§ô 4¨ 2¦ô 1Ç Ortiz I Jr 126 *1.10 96= 13 Elite PowerÇ Gunite«õ Dean Deliversª 2-4p trn,rally,bid1/16 10Þ23= 3Bel fst 6ôf 23¦ :46 1:09¦1:15¨ 4ÎTruNrth-G2 102 4 /6 3 4§ 4§ 1§ 1¦ö Ortiz I Jr 124 *.75 94= 09 Elite Power¦ö Anarchist¨ö Strobe§ô 3-4w,rallied,lead3/16 25á23 K.

But a victory in the Grade 1 Whitney followed three months later by a score in the Longines Breeders’ Cup Classic made White Abarrio a finalist for the Eclipse Award in the older dirt male division. When their trainer Saffie Joseph Jr. was prohibited from racing in New York in the spring following the sudden death of two horses trained by Joseph in Kentucky, owners Mark and Clint Cornett needed another trainer to whom they could send White Abarrio in order to run in the Grade 1 Hill ‘n’ Dale Metropolitan Handicap in June at Belmont Park. They chose Dutrow, with Mark Cornett having had a previous working relationship with the trainer more than a decade earlier. Dutrow, a world-class trainer, had only three months earlier returned from a 10-year suspension handed him by racing regulators in New York for a checkered history that included several equine medication violations. White Abarrio, a 4-year-old son of Race Day bred by Spendthrift Farm and purchased for $40,000 at an Ocala Breeders’ Sales Co. yearling sale in 2021, was coming off an allowance win going seven furlongs at Gulfstream in March and was seemingly going to remain in one-turn races. In the Met Mile, White Abarrio ran a morethan-respectable third behind Cody’s Wish. After that race, Dutrow said he was pointing White Abarrio to the Grade 1 Forego, a seven-furlong race at Saratoga in late August. But as entry day for the Grade 1, $1 million Whitney on Aug. 5 drew closer, that field was shrinking. Upon learning there may only be five horses in the race, Dutrow and the owners altered course and ran in the Whitney. With the heavily favored Cody’s Wish unable to see out the distance, White Abarrio, under Irad Ortiz Jr., won the Whitney by 6 1/4 lengths, giving Dutrow a fabulous gift on his 64th birthday. White Abarrio hadn’t yet cooled out when Dutrow said the colt’s next race would be the $6 million Breeders’ Cup Classic on Nov. 4 at Santa Anita, three months away. “I looked at his [past performances], when he had time between races, he was very live, he ran big,” Dutrow said. By the time the field entered the starting gate for the Classic – with talented 3-year-olds Arcangelo and Geaux Rocket Ride unable to make the race – White Abarrio was the favorite. Sitting an up-close third under Ortiz, White Abarrio rallied past Arabian Knight in upper stretch and held a late-rallying Derma Sotogake at bay to win the Classic by one length. On the morning after the Breeders’ Cup, Dutrow was asked about the apparent race for divisional honors coming down between White Abarrio and Cody’s Wish. Cody’s Wish, Dutrow said, “has been going all year long and winning Grade 1s everywhere. I’m not putting my vote in for him, but if they give it to him, I will be behind him a million percent. We can do it with him next year, as long as he stays the way he is right now. He can get Horse of the Year next year.” Following the Breeders’ Cup, White Abarrio remained in Southern California to prepare for his 5-year-old campaign, which is scheduled to begin in the $20 million Saudi Cup on Feb. 24 in Riyadh.
