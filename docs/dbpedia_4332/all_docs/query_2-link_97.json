We can determine what infrastructure should be retained, what can be upgraded, and what needs to be replaced.\n\nBearheart Consulting provides a range of specialized IT guidance and support to restaurant and hotel operators who may not have the internal teams or bandwidth to effectively execute IT projects on their own. Whether your teams are overwhelmed with current workload, or you simply don’t have an IT team, Bearheart can step in to take the burden that IT projects present off your plate. We assist with project budgeting, planning, and execution of any hospitality-focused IT project regardless of size or complexity.\n\nEvery project is unique, and we dynamically price each project depending on the scope, technical requirements, and complexity of the engagement. We will work with you on an array of pricing models and levels of engagement so you have choices on how to best collaborate. We commit to providing competitive and fair pricing for all projects, and always deliver excellence regardless of a project’s budget.\n\nThe diversity of concepts, operations, and theories in the hospitality industry is what makes this work so exciting! Bearheart has experience opening and renovating everything from large resort hotels and conference centers to independent coffee shops. We welcome work in any type of restaurant, and the more unique or complicated, the more we enjoy the challenge!\n\nWe provide ongoing project support after opening, and are happy to engage with vendors on your behalf. We commit to ensuring that the vendors we bring to the table install and configure systems to your satisfaction. Bearheart has excellent relationships with industry-leading Managed Service Providers that provide best-in-class technical support services and are happy to make those introductions.\n\nRestaurant and hotel openings, rebrandings, and renovations are difficult enough, but the added onus of IT projects can be frustrating for operators. We take the stress and requirement to learn IT off your plate, so you can concentrate on what you do best: operations.\n\nBearheart provides direct training to management and staff on any systems that we install directly. We facilitate training between vendors, management, and front line staff for any third parties. We are always happy to jump in and assist on training where time allows!\n\nPlease reach out via phone, mail, or through our website's contact form. We will reply to schedule an initial consultation to discuss your goals, challenges, and requirements. We look forward to collaborating with you!"
