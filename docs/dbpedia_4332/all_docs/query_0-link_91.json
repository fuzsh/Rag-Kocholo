Each title covers a specific decade and offers a clear overview of its dominant cultural forms and influential texts, discussing their historical impact and cultural legacy. Collectively the series reframes the notion of ‘decade studies’ through the prism of cultural production and rethinks the ways in which decades are usually periodised. Broad contextual approaches to the particular decade are combined with focused case studies, dealing with themes of modernity, commerce, freedom, power, resistance, community, race, class, gender, sexuality, internationalism, technology, war and popular culture.

The seventies wasn’t really my area, professionally – I was much more at home in the nineteenth century (the Civil War, Mark Twain) or, at the very latest, the 1930s (Woody Guthrie). My scholarly work on the seventies was limited to a few articles and chapters on Kurt Vonnegut and anti-Nixon satire. So, even now, I wonder if what Martin really meant was: ‘Come on. You were there.’ If you can remember the 1960s, so the joke goes, you can’t have been there. Well, I can certainly remember the seventies, and not always fondly. I entered my teens in 1971 – not a period of unalloyed happiness for many people. My mother was recently widowed, a lowpaid secretary trying to support three boys through a string of job losses against a backdrop of high inflation and high unemployment: the previously unheard-of combination called ‘stagflation’. For a brief period my mother had a paid job in the local office of the anti-war pressure group, SANE; consequently, I often found myself in the midst of turbulent demonstrations in the waning years of the Vietnam War, including the May Day march on Washington in 1971. The war was Nixon’s, the battered economy was Carter’s, and the comedy was Gerald Ford’s (courtesy of Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live). In my home town of Montclair, New Jersey, I was in the first class of children to be bussed across town to a school that neither of my older brothers knew anything about and for reasons I only barely understood. After gym class one day in 1974, the locker room reverberated to the wild chants of ‘Ali! Ali! Ali!’ I watched Anita Bryant get hit in the face with a pie on national television. The girl next door asked me\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nix\n\nwhat I thought of this guy Springsteen’s new album, the one with the song about Rosalita on it. From Montclair Heights I watched the two skeletons of the World Trade Center gradually rise and overtake the Empire State Building, feeling vaguely affronted by the change to a familiar and beloved skyline. These and other ‘references’ have unavoidably fed into the writing of this book. I didn’t understand their significance at the time. This is where the scholarship has come in. I am grateful, first of all, to Martin Halliwell and to Nicola Ramsey at Edinburgh University Press for the opportunity to contribute this book and for their willing assistance throughout its composition. A number of colleagues and friends have pointed me to valuable material or honed my impressions through discussion. I’m grateful to Sämi Ludwig for his thoughts (and his work) on Toni Morrison; to Lynn Breeze for reminding me of the significance of the Last Whole Earth Catalog; to Nigel Wells for his gift of Sam Shepard’s Rolling Thunder Logbook; to Nick Selby for material on the Language poets; to Donald Morse for presenting me with his authoritative study of Kurt Vonnegut; and to Zoltán Abádi-Nagy for sharing his critical wisdom about Vonnegut, Robert Coover and other seventies writers during a delightful drive across the Hungarian countryside. I am especially grateful to have received from the hand of Kasia Boddy a copy of her masterful Boxing: A Cultural History which illuminated so much about Norman Mailer and the Ali–Foreman ‘Rumble in the Jungle’. My friends and, respectively, present and former colleagues, Jan Wardle and Heidi Macpherson, were always there when the work seemed to get on top of me. I appreciate the conference funding awarded by my department and faculty at the University of Central Lancashire. Finally, to my dear wife Sarah and our ace sons, Reuben and Theo . . . well, you know.\n\nChronology of 1970s American Culture\n\nxii\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\nDate\n\nEvents\n\nCriticism\n\nLiterature\n\nDrama\n\n1970\n\nPresident Nixon announces a partial withdrawal from Vietnam while ordering troops into Cambodia.

The first is the apparent arbitrariness of ‘the decade’ as a meaningful periodising marker. A major historian of the 1970s, Bruce J. Schulman, is aware of this problem, admitting: ‘It is easy to mock the overwrought chronologies that lay such heavy weight on years that end with zero.’1 Others would appear to agree. Why privilege ‘decade markers’, Stephen Rachman asks, when equally we ‘take our temporal cures from political transitions like changes in administration’?2 Music historian Greil Marcus is most dismissive of the arbitrary ‘decade marker’: As the formal end of the 1960s approached, in some circles dread over the supposed event was as great as the nagging feeling that upon the dawning of the first day of the year 2000 the world will be rendered unrecognizable, assuming it still exists. The notion was that as the clock struck midnight on January 31, 1969, some spirit of invention and resistance peculiar to the time would magically disappear . . .3\n\nIn the light of such scepticism over the value of placing interpretive weight on years beginning or ending in 0, some cultural critics and historians have opted for other strategies. At one extreme, for instance, Stephen Paul Miller takes his cue from Foucault, breaking down the decade into smaller components: ‘Michel Foucault’s The Order of Things (1967) uses the term “episteme” to describe an era’s prevailing mindset, its epistemological horizons . . . Epistemes graduate through micro-periods without losing their dominant discursive characteristics. For instance, roughly speaking, I micro-periodise the 1970s into 1970–1, 1972–4, 1975–7, and 1978–9’.4 Thus, while still paying fealty to the 0-ending ‘decade marker’, Miller places more significance on particular\n\n2\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\nperiods within the decade. At the other extreme, dismissing the concept of the ten-year marker outright, Schulman prefers to elasticise the period, opting for a cultural analysis based on what he calls ‘the long 1970s, fifteen malaise- and mayhem-filled years, from 1969 to 1984’, during which ‘the United States experienced a remarkable makeover. Its economic outlook, political ideology, cultural assumptions and fundamental social arrangements changed.’5 Schulman thus seizes on a number of significant events and processes that demonstrate to him ‘how during the Seventies, the tides of American life turned’, including, notably, the ‘great shift’ of ‘political power, economic dynamism, and cultural authority’ from the northern centres to the southern Sunbelt.6 Other recent scholars have played equally fast and loose with the ironclad ‘decade marker’. For Edward D. Berkowitz, the 1970s lasted from 1973 to 1981 – from the end of United States military action in Vietnam to the inauguration of Ronald Reagan – between which events the ground was prepared for the social and economic conservatism of the 1980s.7 Mark Hamilton Lytle’s time frame is even more slippery: as the subtitle of his cultural history indicates, the seventies were actually subsumed into a ‘Sixties Era’ that lasted ‘from Elvis to the Fall of Richard Nixon’.8 In his extremely dark assessment of the 1970s, Philip Jenkins maintains: The year 1970 is an especially implausible candidate for marking the end of an era, because so much of the unrest of the 1960s was peaking in that year, while critical events we think of as characterizing sixties liberalism actually occurred afterward. Though these historical markers are symbolic rather than real, I will argue that ‘the sixties’ began with the assassination of John Kennedy in 1963 and ended with the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974.9\n\nThe concept of a ‘great shift’ underlies another significant reading of the 1970s, that of J. David Hoeveler Jr, who argues that the decade marked – or was marked by – the transition from modernism to postmodernism, what he calls ‘the postmodernist turn’: The recurrent motif in 1970s culture is the dismantling of inherited forms, descriptive norms, sharp and inclusive modes of categorization; instead, we have the blurring of distinctions, the mixing of forms, a discomfort with preciseness in signification and representation . . . The 1970s arrived to its place of recognition in American intellectual history by a series of undermining acts.10\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n3\n\nThese characteristics of Hoeveler’s ‘postmodernist turn’ were, to some extent, identified and critiqued (with considerable dismay) by one of the decade’s most influential sociologists, Daniel Bell, who, in the midst of the 1970s, concluded that American society had experienced its own irrevocable turn, or shift, from the ‘industrial’ to the ‘postindustrial’ mode. For the most part, Bell uses the term ‘post-industrial’ to describe changes in the economy, the labour market (or ‘occupational system’) and the arena of technological development.11 However, as Bell argued in two highly polemical treatises – The Coming of Post-Industrial Society (1974) and The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism (1976) – ‘post-industrial society’ has its cultural corollary, which is ‘post-modernism’. Bell lamented what he perceived as ‘a widening disjunction’ between modern social structures and the culture – ‘the symbolic expression of meanings’ – generated by, or along with, them.12 Social structures, Bell felt, were ruthlessly rational and efficient, while culture, sadly, was fixated on the self rather than on the community at large. Bell’s alarming description of the rupture between culture and society preludes a devastating cultural critique: What I find striking today is the radical disjunction between the social structure (the techno-economic order) and the culture. The former is ruled by an economic principle defined in terms of efficiency and functional rationality, the organization of production through the ordering of things, including men as things. The latter is prodigal, promiscuous, dominated by an anti-rational, anti-intellectual temper in which the self is taken as the touchstone of cultural judgments, and the effect on the self is the measure of the aesthetic work of experience.13\n\nThus, in Bell’s sour estimation, culture is devoted to sensation rather than contemplation, to raw experience rather than value – in short, to ‘hedonism, the idea of pleasure as a way of life’.14 Such a blanket dismissal of American – or any – culture is, of course, sloppy and untenable. It seems to indicate, however, a desire on the part of cultural critics to encapsulate, to ‘nail down’ the tenor of a decade or, indeed, of an age. This is Graham Thompson’s major objection to Miller’s controlling definition of the 1970s as the decade in which ‘surveillance and self-surveillance’ became dominant American tropes.15 Thompson argues: ‘Producing a narrative of a decade that seeks to establish overarching definitions and to analyse specific cultural products and cultural production itself in light of these\n\n4\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\ndefinitions is to mistake American narratives for totalising narratives about America’.16 While heeding Thompson’s advice against the temptation to totalise about something as multivalent and, perhaps, arbitrarily marked as a ‘decade’, we can still identify a variety of moments, processes and narratives worth exploring. Schulman, for one, does just this in his discussion of how the 1970s ‘reshaped’ a host of American ‘landscapes’ – ‘race relations, religion, family life, politics, and popular culture’: One year alone, 1973, witnessed the end of American intervention in Vietnam, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, the exposure of the Watergate conspiracies, the Indian occupation of Wounded Knee, and the first Arab oil shock. Billie Jean King won the Battle of the Sexes, The Godfather swept the Academy Awards, and a young evangelical preacher named Jim Bakker appeared on the airwaves, intent on creating ‘God’s television’.17\n\nParticular events thus carry their own weight in helping to define a decade. For music critic Tony Parsons, transitions between decades can occur in a particular arena – due to a signal event – regardless of developments elsewhere. Reviewing the 1990 reissue of the New York Dolls’ first album (1973), Parsons wrote: ‘Until The New York Dolls a hangover from the sixties had permeated the music scene. That album was where a new decade began, where a contemporary version of the essence of rock ’n’ roll emerged to kick out the tired old men and clear the way for the New Order.’18 This seems to imply that, while it might still be the 1960s in, say, the political or economic sphere, it may already be the 1970s in music. Arguably, this way madness lies. One thing is certain: there are enough key cultural and historical moments to confound the conventional or stereotypical impression of the 1970s as the ‘undecade’ or as merely ‘the aftermath of the sixties’19 – ‘an eminently forgettable decade’, the decade of ‘bad clothes, bad hair, and bad music impossible to take seriously’.20 Such impressions threaten to overwhelm our sense of what precisely made the 1970s the seventies, as one of many recent cultural products indicates. The Fox Network’s long-running sitcom, That Seventies Show (1998–2006) situates its characters in a small Wisconsin suburb in the years 1976–9. What is it in particular that makes it a ‘70s show’, given that its teenage characters undergo crises and rites of passage that would be experienced by teens in other decades as well – sexual\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n5\n\nexploration, ‘hanging out’, family relationships, balancing school and after-school demands? Granted, the characters do play with such periodised topics as political scepticism and disenchantment with the Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter administrations, the oil crises and petrol rationing, the impact of second-wave feminism and drug use. But even more important are the visual and aural elements – fashion, hair styles, technological props (for example the Pong video game), period slang and diction. As Sherrie Inness argues, the show relies on the sort of ‘1970s iconography’ that informs larger trends in cultural nostalgia for the decade of the Bee Gees, Saturday Night Fever, ‘lava lamps, suede rugs, and beanbag chairs . . . polyester leisure suits’ – in short, the trappings of ‘a fantasy, but one that has had a strong impact on the United States’.21 To a large extent, as Derek Kompare suggests, the ‘rising cultural interest in the recent American past in the 1970s’ is due largely to what he calls ‘the television heritage’ prompted in no small part by the programming of reruns of actual seventies shows.22 Moving beyond the realms of parody, caricature or nostalgia, however, it is more useful to approach the 1970s – as Shelton Waldrep does – as ‘a period [that] exists in several parallel dimensions. It is a zone of generational memory, a boundary between times of political excess, a period of still underexamined cultural production that marks the beginning of a new plurality’ characterised by ‘popular and artistic diversity’.23 Approaching the decade thus will not only offer new and valuable readings of cultural texts and practices, but it will also offer ways in which to challenge the critical and intellectual negativity of Bell and like-minded thinkers who reduce the culture of the 1970s to a collective expression of narcissism, hedonism and solipsism.\n\nThe ‘Me Decade’? There were indeed cultural developments in the 1970s that must share some responsibility for the overarching misapprehensions of the decade as the decade of narcissism. It is, for example, easy to target a variety of ‘New Age’ or ‘personal awareness’ movements as the signal narcissistic expressions of the 1970s – ‘Est, Esalen, Rolfing, Zen, yoga, Arica, channelling, transactional psychology’ among them.24 Towards the end of the decade, Cyra McFadden, in her novel The Serial (1977), could look back at the previous few years to construct a cast of Marin County, California, self-obsessives who take ‘getting in touch with themselves’ to the heights of caricature:\n\n6\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\nFigure I.1 Seventies Pad (c.1975). Three Lions/Getty Images.\n\nNow Rita lived out in Woodacre with her old man, some other congenial freaks and a kiln. Deeply involved with the human-potential movement, she had like mutated over the years through Gurdjieff, Silva Mind Control, actualism, analytical tracking, parapsychology, Human Life Styling, postural integration, the Fischer-Hoffman Process, hatha and raja yoga, integral massage, orgonomy, palmistry, Neo-Reichian bodywork and Feldenkrais functional integration. Currently she was commuting to Berkeley twice a week for ‘polarity balancing manipulation’, which, she reported through her annual mimeographed Christmas letter, produces ‘good thinking’.25\n\nMcFadden’s parody has a critical counterpoint in an essay by Tom Wolfe, ‘The Me Decade and the Third Great Awakening’, first published in the New York Magazine of 23 August 1976. For better or worse, this essay – known generally as, simply, ‘The Me Decade’ – has influenced many people’s perceptions of the 1970s (and is the original source of the popular catchphrase that is so often used to describe the decade). As Wolfe writes: ‘The new alchemical dream is: changing one’s personality – remaking, remodelling, elevating, and polishing one’s very self . . . and observing, studying, and doting on it. (Me!)’26 Wolfe’s essay propelled the subject of American narcissism into the popular arena, but he was not alone in seizing on narcissism as the\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n7\n\nspirit of the age. Jim Hougan, Peter Marin, Edwin Schur and Richard Sennett all analysed the corrosive impact of narcissism on American society.27 Leading the discussion by far, and with the greatest force, was the cultural historian Christopher Lasch whose The Culture of Narcissism (1978) remains a key critical examination of America in the 1970s. The Culture of Narcissism (1978) Lasch sees narcissism in general as ‘a metaphor for the human condition’,28 but he also situates it in a particular time frame. Narcissism is the ‘personality of our time’, (31) related to specific social developments: Hardly more than a quarter-century after Henry Luce proclaimed ‘the American century’ [1941], American confidence has fallen to a low ebb. Those who recently dreamed of world power now despair of governing the city of New York. Defeat in Vietnam, economic stagnation, and the impending exhaustion of natural resources have produced a mood of pessimism in higher circles, which spreads through the rest of society as people lose faith in their leaders. (xiii)\n\nLasch argues that in consequence the American people have turned ‘the pursuit of happiness to the dead end of a narcissistic preoccupation with the self’ – ‘the apotheosis of individualism’ by which ‘strategies of narcissistic survival . . . present themselves as emancipation’. (xv, 66) The narcissistic ‘strategies’ that Lasch singles out – whether ‘the cult of expanded consciousness, health [or] personal “growth” ’ – are, to him, symptoms of profound despair and they have no doubt contributed to succeeding caricatures of the 1970s in popular culture and criticism: ‘Having no hope of improving their lives in any of the ways that matter, people have convinced themselves that what matters is psychic self-improvement: getting in touch with their feelings, eating health food, taking lessons in ballet or bellydancing, immersing themselves in the wisdom of the East, jogging, learning how to “relate”, overcoming the “fear of pleasure” ’. (4) For Lasch, all such strategies have led, in the first place, to ‘the trivialization of personal relations’. (187) The importance of child-rearing is eclipsed by eroticism, yet it is an eroticism in which ‘sex’ is separated from ‘feeling’: ‘The progressive ideology of “nonbinding commitments” and “cool sex” makes a virtue of emotional disengagement’ while ‘at the same time, people demand from personal relations the richness and intensity of a religious experience’. (194, 200) Lasch establishes an explicit connection between ‘the cult of personal relations’ at an individual level and a receding ‘hope of political solutions’ at the social level. (51) The ‘banality of pseudo-self-awareness’, he argues, is reflected in a ‘theatrics of politics’ without substance. (71) Politics thus\n\n8\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s becomes an empty exercise in therapy; American preoccupations have thus descended ‘from politics to self-examination’: ‘Having displaced religion as the organizing framework of American culture, the therapeutic outlook threatens to displace politics as well, the last refuge of ideology. Bureaucracy transforms collective grievances into personal problems amenable to therapeutic intervention’. (13–14) Even at the existing political level, Lasch argues, the preoccupation with the self is paramount. Politics has become a game of ‘self-promotion through “winning images” ’; (56) success – political or otherwise – must be ‘ratified by publicity’ (60) and truth thus takes a back seat to mere credibility: When politicians and administrators have no other aim than to sell their leadership to the public, they deprive themselves of intelligible standards by which to define the goals of specific policies or to evaluate success or failure. It was because prestige and credibility had become the only measure of effectiveness that American policy in Vietnam could be conducted without regard to the strategic importance of Vietnam or the political situation in that country. (78)\n\nPoliticians and administrators thus become both victims and agents of ‘the atrophy of competence’ and ‘the eclipse of achievement’. (59, 127) The professional and managerial elite, including politicians, may well be America’s ‘ruling class’, (221) but they have debased themselves in the corrupt pursuit of publicity: In a society in which the dream of success has been drained of any meaning beyond itself, men [sic] have nothing against which to measure their achievements except the achievements of others. Self-approval depends on public recognition and acclaim . . . Today men seek the kind of approval that applauds not their actions but their personal attributes. They wish to be not so much esteemed as admired. They crave not fame but the glamour and excitement of celebrity. (59)\n\nSuch criticisms are by now all too familiar in an age that has coined a term – ‘spin’ – to define the process that Lasch identified and critiqued in 1978; but one of Lasch’s most impressive contributions to the analysis is his situation of image-pursuit – of what we now call ‘spin’ – in its broad historical frame: In an earlier stage of capitalist development, industrialization reduced the artisan or peasant to a proletarian, stripped him of his land and tools, and stranded him in the marketplace with nothing to sell but his labour power. In our time, the elimination of skills not only from manual work but from whitecollar jobs as well has created conditions in which labour power takes the form of personality or intelligence. Men and women alike have to project an attractive image and to become simultaneously role players and connoisseurs of their own performance. (92)\n\nMany will no doubt find fault with Lasch’s merciless – and perhaps sweeping – generalisation; but many, too, will acknowledge the prevalence of the ills he first identified in the 1970s and which have persisted to the present: the ‘propaganda of commodities’ through which consumption is held up\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n9\n\nas ‘the answer to the age-old discontents of loneliness, sickness, weariness [and] lack of sexual satisfaction’, but which itself ‘creates new forms of discontent peculiar to the modern age’ (‘Is your job boring and meaningless? Does it leave you with feelings of futility and fatigue? Is your life empty? Consumption promises to fill the aching void’). (71–3) Lasch’s concern with ‘education as a commodity’ (151) will also ring true for many, even if their conclusion is less damning: ‘Sweeping social changes, reflected in academic practice, thus underlie the deterioration of the school system and the consequent spread of stupidity’. (127) Certainly, too, Lasch’s identification of ‘the dread of old age’ – reflected in the proliferation of ‘sciences and pseudo-sciences’ such as ‘geriatrics, gerontology, thanatology, cryonics [and] “immortalism” ’ (207) – will carry some weight for those familiar with the plethora of products and processes that remove wrinkles, hide age-spots and replace sagging skin. ‘The denial of age in America’, Lasch writes, is yet another symptom of the culture of narcissism; ‘the prolongevity movement, which hopes to abolish old age altogether’, is less ‘a cult of youth’ than ‘a cult of the self’, expressing ‘in characteristic form the anxieties of a culture that believes it has no future’. (217) In spite of such a dire conclusion (the tenor of which drives his whole book), Lasch holds out a thread of hope which actually deserves more prominence in any assessment of the American 1970s – the ground-swell of grass-roots activism, prompted by ‘the inadequacy of solutions dictated from above’: In small towns and crowded urban neighborhoods, even in suburbs, men and women have initiated modest experiments in cooperation, designed to defend their rights against the corporation and the state. The ‘flight from politics’, as it appears to the managerial and political elite, may signify the citizen’s growing unwillingness to take part in the political system as a consumer of prefabricated spectacles. It may signify, in other words, not a retreat from politics at all but the beginnings of a general political revolt. (xv)\n\nAs will be discussed below, Lasch was quite observant in his speculation on grassroots activism, even if he gave less credit to these ‘modest experiments’ than they rightfully deserved.\n\nThe narcissism that Bell, Wolfe and Lasch variously identify may be seen in a number of instances in which individuals in the 1970s appeared oblivious to the dangers of following certain quests for ‘selfimprovement’ or ‘self-awareness’. Cults like L. Ron Hubbard’s Church of Scientology, which had begun to attract significant numbers in the 1970s, continue to invite critical derision even in the present decade; but more threatening was the Korean missionary Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church – ‘the Moonies’ – whose recruitment of college-age adherents often relied on deceptive, highly orchestrated\n\n10\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\nbrainwashing campaigns. More sinister still, to a tragic degree, was the blindness of over nine hundred acolytes of the self-styled ‘Reverend’ Jim Jones, a delusional demagogue who, in 1978, led his followers through a ritual of mass suicide in the jungles of Guyana. At the other, more prosaic, extreme, technological developments conspired to turn people away from each other and into solitary consumers of culture. David A. Cook has explored the impact of the Sony Betamax and, latterly, the VHS-format video cassette recorder (VCR), a development he describes as an ‘historic shift’: At the beginning of the 1970s, the movies were primarily a collective experience – something seen regularly on large screens in specially designed theatres with masses of other people. By the decade’s end they had become something that could also be carried around in a briefcase or shopping bag for video playback at home.29\n\nJust as we now know, however, that the invention of the VCR in no way signalled the death knell of the collective cinema experience, we can also look back at the 1970s for substantial evidence with which to confound Bell, Wolfe and Lasch. Peter N. Carroll has argued passionately for the need to rehabilitate the reputation of the 1970s in the wake of such negative assessments: The times were not narcissistic; only certain people were. And by using them as the benchmark of the decade, writers like Wolfe diminished the value of those who lived otherwise . . . Such attitudes allowed little room for alternatives, for protest. Instead, the Me Decade became the standard by which normal behavior would be measured.30\n\nMiller likewise concludes that the 1970s deserves a better press than that given by Bell, Wolfe and Lasch, especially in view of the social advances that the decade witnessed: Of course, the seventies was a crucial period, if only because during this decade initiatives from the sixties in the women’s movement, civil and voting rights enforcement, affirmative action, and environmental regulation were established. Progressive forces brought into play in the sixties had their effect at national and grassroots levels.31\n\nAdded to this list would of course be the massive public activism against the Vietnam War, hardly a narcissistic enterprise.\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n11\n\nIt is in the context of such social and political developments that the intellectual and cultural contexts of the 1970s dovetail into one another. This cultural and intellectual integration can be observed, for instance, in the relationship between Vietnam, Watergate and expressions of popular criticism, as Miller argues: ‘The war and the scandal [are] related phenomena that enunciate relevant discourses related to government and the populace’s response to its workings.’32 Thus, there was more than merely a causal chain between the publication of the leaked Pentagon Papers by the New York Times in 1971 – exposing Defense Department corruption since the war’s onset – and the breakin at the Watergate offices of the Democratic National Committee in 1972, which ultimately led to President Nixon’s resignation in 1974. There was also a critical chain examining what political commentators called the ‘credibility gaps’ of the Nixon administration, a chain extending from the congressional debating halls to protest rallies to the comic-strip pages in the newspapers. What David Wyatt says about Vietnam – that it is both America’s ‘wound’ and a ‘great and terrible resource’33 – can also be applied to Watergate which, while it is a shameful story of corrupt power politics, is also the inspiration for some of the decade’s most important examples of political and cultural critique as well as investigative journalism. In this, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s All the President’s Men (1974) shares a critical edge with Garry Trudeau’s Doonesbury comic strip which, as Howard Sounes observes, was pointedly shifted by the Washington Post’s editors from the comics page to the editorial page with the explanation that ‘Trudeau had crossed the line from comic artist to political commentator’.34 The Watergate story may well be an example of the political narcissism of Richard Nixon, so evidently obsessed with the ‘enemies’ out to get him, regardless of the health of the body politic; but the wealth of cultural critiques spawned by Watergate indicates a determination to expose and condemn such narcissism.\n\nFacing the Limits of American Power Other events throughout the decade – political and economic – generated new areas of intellectual and cultural criticism. Watergate and the defeat in Vietnam occurred in the context of other crises that combined to demonstrate America’s economic vulnerability and political limitations. In October 1973, the Arab members of OPEC – the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries – placed an embargo on oil exports to the United States in retaliation against Washington’s\n\n12\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\npro-Israel bias. Petrol shortages, rationing and mile-long petrol station queues were the result – a situation that returned with a second OPEC oil embargo in the summer of 1979. President Nixon’s decision in August 1971 to uncouple the dollar from the gold standard, allowing its value to float freely against that of other currencies, resulted in wild global currency fluctuations. This, combined with a surge in domestic borrowing, marked a decline in American manufacturing, and global crop shortages resulted in mid-decade economic stagnation and lengthening unemployment lines. At the same time, rocketing prices – inflation – combined with joblessness to produce an economic scenario never before seen in America, ‘stagflation’, which particularly bedevilled the Ford and Carter administrations. ‘For the first time since the Great Depression,’ Schulman observes, ‘talk of limits and diminishing expectations filled presidential addresses and dinner table conversations.’35 Daniel Bell’s mid-decade assessment appears, in retrospect, desperately hopeful and, in some respects (with the benefit of hindsight), misjudged: It is all too soon to write off Western economic power. By the end of the decade, the dependence of the Western countries on Middle East oil may be largely reduced; there will be new and different sources and kinds of energy. For a period of time, there may be large-scale shift of capital to the Middle East countries, but the basic economic lead of the West is in high technology and management, and this is bound to reassert itself.36\n\nThe second OPEC embargo of 1979 put paid to Bell’s suggestion that ‘the end of the decade’ would see a large reduction of American dependence on Arab oil; but he was right in his conclusion: ‘What the international economic events of the 1970s revealed was a failure of political will to match the economic urgencies, and this is a different and more disturbing aspect of the instability of the international order’.37 The Iranian seizure of over fifty American Embassy personnel in Teheran in November 1979 – and their 444-day captivity that ended on the day of Ronald Reagan’s inauguration in January 1981 – can only have confirmed the sense of an unstable international order, at least for those prepared to assume that a stable international order subject to American dominance could ever be understood as the norm. Indeed, major critical treatises of the 1970s – academic as well as popular – suggest that assumptions of such a ‘norm’ were being challenged even as they were being proposed. Telford Taylor’s Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy (1970) outlined the\n\n13\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\nextent to which American involvement in Vietnam infringed aspects of international law, a charge broadened to include concerted American destabilisation efforts in Latin America and elsewhere in an exposé by Morton Halerpin and others called The Lawless State (1976). Anthony Sampson’s The Sovereign State of ITT (1973) argued that, in any event, the power of multinational corporations had begun to outstrip and transcend that of nation-states, including the United States. Robert Jowett and John Shelton Lawrence’s The American Monomyth (1977) situated American adventurism around the globe in the context of a cultural myth of America’s messianic capacity. In his Theory of International Politics (1979), the political scientist Kenneth Waltz proposed that the governing principle of international relations is in fact ‘anarchy’; American global dominance thus could not be construed as the norm. Examples such as these indicate a critical tendency to examine not only the workings but also the limits of American power and influence in the world. Among the most important and revolutionary of these interrogations of American power came not from the field of political science or international relations, but rather literary criticism: Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978). Although its primary focus is on European colonialism’s construction of the East as ‘other’, Orientalism raises a host of questions about American assumptions of a ‘stable’ world order and the place of the United States in that order. For those who have experienced the rise of Middle Eastern anti-Americanism and of Islamist fundamentalism in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, Said’s Orientalism offers many signposts on the road to that pass. Orientalism (1978) Said, a Palestinian-American professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, set out in Orientalism to theorise Western conceptions of the East, or ‘the Orient’, in what became a truly momentous study. ‘The Orient’, he writes, ‘was almost a European invention, and had been since antiquity a place of romance, exotic beings, haunting memories and landscapes, remarkable experiences.’38 Crucial to Said’s theory was the perception that the Western project of ‘Orientalism’ – ‘a way of coming to terms with the orient that is based on the orient’s special place in European Western experience’ – actually reflects as much, if not more, upon Western identity as upon the East itself: ‘The orient has helped to define Europe (or the West) as its contrasting image, idea, personality, experience.’ (1–2) The impact of such a belief system was the construction\n\n14\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s of a severe, politically charged ‘vision of reality’ based on a perceived ‘difference between the familiar (Europe, the West, “us”) and the strange (the Orient, the east, “them”)’. (44) Underpinning this binary ‘vision’ are real power structures with immense influence: None of this Orient is merely imaginative. The Orient is an integral part of European material civilization and culture. Orientalism expresses and represents that part culturally and even ideologically as a mode of discourse with supporting institutions, vocabulary, scholarship, imagery, doctrines, even colonial bureaucracies and colonial styles. (2)\n\nMost of Said’s study is devoted to European Orientalism spearheaded by the French and British colonialists; but the United States attracts increasing attention, Said argues, as ‘the vastly expanded American political and economic role in the Near East (the Middle East) makes great claims on our understanding of that Orient’. (2) America’s relatively late interest in the East, Said claims – barring the odd expressions of interest by individuals such as Melville and Twain, or a handful of Transcendentalists and theologians and members of the American Oriental Society established in 1842 – was due to the fact that ‘the American frontier, the one that counted, was the westward one’. (290) By the end of World War II, however, ‘the shift from British and French to American hegemony’ was secured; (25) the United States fitted itself ‘quite self-consciously – in the places excavated by the two European powers’ and now dominates and approaches both Orientalism and the orient ‘as Britain and France once did’. (4, 17) Said makes clear one further link between earlier European and later American Orientalism: ‘For a European or American studying the orient there can be no disclaiming the main circumstances of his actuality: that he comes up against the orient as a European or American first, as an individual second.’ (11) Given that ‘political societies impart to their civil societies a sense of urgency . . . where and whenever matters pertaining to their imperial interests abroad are concerned’, (11) in the case of the United States that ‘urgency’ is wrapped up in the security of the consumer economy: The Arab and Islamic world as a whole is hooked into the Western market system. No one needs to be reminded that oil, the region’s greatest resource, has been totally absorbed into the United States economy. By that I mean not only that the great oil companies are controlled by the American economic system; I mean also that Arab oil revenues, to say nothing of marketing, research, and industry management, are based in the United States. (324)\n\nThe cultural ramifications of this ‘one-sided’ market relationship are enormous; it is not simply that ‘the Western market economy and its consumer orientation’ has underwritten ‘a class of educated people whose intellectual formation is directed to satisfying market needs’. (325) More broadly, the reception of American culture in the Middle East is also a question of market dominance:\n\nThe Intellectual Context There is a vast standardization of taste in the region, symbolized not only by transistors, blue jeans, and Coca-Cola but also by cultural images of the orient supplied by American mass media and consumed unthinkingly by the mass television audience. The paradox of an Arab regarding himself as an ‘Arab’ of the sort put out by Hollywood is but the simplest result of what I am referring to. (324–5)\n\nThus, ‘the Arab world today is an intellectual, political, and cultural satellite of the United States. . . The Arab and Islamic world remains a secondorder power in terms of the production of culture, knowledge, and scholarship.’ (322–3) Even though ‘the powerful current of anti-imperialist Third World ideas that has gripped the region since the early 1950s has tempered the Western edge of the dominant culture’, (323) the structures of knowledge and culture are firmly dominated by the West. This is true even in the case of Arab studies: There is no major journal of Arab studies published in the Arab world today, just as there is no Arab educational institution capable of challenging places like Oxford, Harvard, or UCLA in the study of the Arab world, much less in any non-Oriental subject matter. The predictable result of all this is that oriental students (and oriental professors) still want to come and sit at the feet of American Orientalists, and later to repeat to their local audiences the clichés I have been characterizing as Orientalist dogmas. (323–4)\n\nThe ‘clichés’ of which Said writes are not merely those of Western television and cinema wherein ‘the Arab is associated either with lechery or bloodthirsty dishonesty’: ‘He appears as an oversexed degenerate, capable, it is true, of cleverly devious intrigues, but essentially sadistic, treacherous, low. Slave trader, camel driver, moneychanger, colourful scoundrel . . .’ (286–7) They are clichés also prompted by the turbulence of realpolitik, in which a hollowed-out part is allowed to stand for the complex whole: Most accounts of Arab oil equate the oil boycott of 1973–4 (which principally benefited Western oil companies and a small ruling Arab elite) with the absence of any Arab moral qualification for owning such vast oil reserves. Without the usual euphemisms, the question most often being asked is why such people as the Arabs are entitled to keep the developed (free, democratic, moral) world threatened. From such questions comes the frequent suggestion that the Arab oil fields be invaded by the marines. (286)\n\nAs befits a major scholar in Western literature, Said observes that the champions of Orientalism in the United States since the 1950s – in government agencies and think tanks dominated by pretensions to objective social science – have not availed themselves of material which might combat the clichés, stereotypes and ‘ideological fictions’ (321) that make Orientalism such an intellectually corrupt enterprise: One of the striking aspects of the new American social-science attention to the Orient is its singular avoidance of literature. You can read through\n\n15\n\n16\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s reams of expert writing on the modern near East and never encounter a single reference to literature. What seem to matter far more to the regional expert are ‘facts’, of which a literary text is perhaps a disturber. The net effect of this remarkable omission in modern American awareness of the Arab or Islamic Orient is to keep the region and its people conceptually emasculated, reduced to ‘attitudes’, ‘trends’, statistics: in short, dehumanized. (291)\n\nSaid’s unfortunate gender bias in this instance (the equation of dehumanisation with emasculation) should not obscure the gravity of the situation he describes, particularly with regard to the corrosive impact of Orientalist assumptions and influence on Easterners themselves. ‘Cultural domination is maintained’, Said writes, ‘as much by Oriental consent as by direct and crude economic pressure from the United States’. (324) This fact is in itself a ‘reason for alarm’: ‘the pages of books and journals in Arabic (and doubtless in Japanese, various Indian dialects, and other oriental languages) are filled with second-order analyses by Arabs of “the Arab mind”, “Islam”, and other myths’. (322) As Said makes clear, mythologising is a fundamental aim of Orientalist discourse; but the impact of Orientalism is far from mythological: the ‘Orient’ – whatever that may be – ‘is now less a myth perhaps than a place criss-crossed by Western, especially American, interests’. (26) As the Iranian revolution of 1979 was to prove, these interests would be increasingly and vigorously challenged.\n\nSaid’s Orientalism is rightly credited with inaugurating postcolonial criticism. But, in its exposition of negotiations between knowledge, description and power, it also illuminates the workings of oppositional processes that were taking place in the United States well before its publication. Such progressive processes as feminist and gay/lesbian activism undoubtedly contributed to conservative backlash and to the nostalgia for a ‘stable’ social order at home. It is significant that when President Carter, in the first of his televised ‘Fireside Chats’ (1 February 1977), hammered home to Americans that there was indeed an energy crisis and that their habits of consumption would have to change, he both hearkened back to and strategically updated the cosy radio broadcasts of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the midst of the Depression. Carter sat before the cameras, dressed in a cardigan (soon described by media wags as a ‘cartergan’) in a room warmly furnished with bookshelves and colonial-era oak furniture – and told Americans that the times, as well as their standard of living, had irrevocably changed.39 Two years later, on 15 July 1979, Carter appeared again on television to inform the public of the ‘almost invisible’ threat that he had perceived in the country:\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n17\n\nIt is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America.40\n\nCarter’s speech was, he said, inspired by some of the ‘voices of America’ to which he had listened at a Camp David gathering. As he was told by a cross section of Americans: ‘Some of us have suffered from recession all our lives’; ‘Some people have wasted energy, but others haven’t had anything to waste’; ‘Our neck is stretched over the fence and OPEC has a knife.’41 These vox pop enunciations might well justify Schulman’s perception of the 1970s as a malaise-filled decade. These expressions of powerlessness, however, if taken as the decade’s benchmark, belie the determination and the hard-won (if incomplete) advances made on a number of social fronts.\n\nGrass-roots Activism On 23 June 1972, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act went into effect, declaring: ‘No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.’42 While this achievement is typically discussed in terms of its impact on girls’ and women’s participation in school and collegiate sports, it actually represents a far broader feminist victory in terms of equality of opportunity across the educational sector. Title IX was perhaps the most visible indication of advances made by feminists also campaigning for equal opportunities in the workplace, in the health sector and in pay; and, given the persistence of unequal pay in the American workplace, the adoption of Title IX can be considered, at best, a partial victory. In the same year as its adoption, the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution (ERA) was introduced in Congress, with its opening provision: ‘Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.’43 Since that date, the ratification battle over this version of the ERA has continued, with a dogged reintroduction of the statute taking place in every subsequent Congressional session (the latest, as of the time of writing, being 27 March 2007). While the continued failure of three-quarters of the states to ratify the amendment has remained a source of immense\n\n18\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\nfrustration to the women’s movement, 1972 marked a watershed in that the amendment was finally adopted by the Senate and recommended to the separate states; it had taken forty-nine years even to reach the Senate floor. The following year, the Supreme Court’s highly controversial decision to legalise a woman’s right to abortion – Roe v. Wade – was made, not on the grounds of a woman’s right to choose, but rather on a woman’s ‘right of personal privacy’.44 Again, this continuously challenged Supreme Court provision indicates a feminist advance across a highly contested battlefield, the end of which is not yet in sight. Other important martial signals were sent out at the beginning of the decade, one of the most important being the feminist anthology edited by Robin Morgan, Sisterhood Is Powerful (1970). With over fifty ground-breaking essays by feminist activists in medicine, publishing, television, the military, academe, journalism, office administration, psychology, psychiatry and the sex industry, and with testimonies from across the racial and political canvas, the anthology is, as Morgan argues, both a call to arms and ‘an action’ reflecting other actions in the highly charged public sphere: It is now the spring of 1970. During the past few months, wildcat strikes by women workers at General Electric, Bendix, and the New York Bell Telephone Company surprised both management and labor; the women felt they had been sold out by the union which was more concerned about its male members. The first serious woman jockey was pelted by rocks before a major race . . . Instead of delivering her expected grateful goodbye speech on television, the outgoing Miss USA exposes the commercial way in which she has been used, and denounces her exploiters. Women are marching, picketing, and mounting a variety of actions against abortion laws in every state. Boycotts have been started against billionaire corporations like Procter & Gamble or Lever Brothers, which manipulate women as consumers but are blatantly discriminatory in their own hiring and salary practices.45\n\nThe project of second-wave feminism to demystify social relationships that may have for decades appeared ‘the norm’, but which are in fact staunchly defended patriarchal positions, extended – as the debate over abortion demonstrated – to women’s ownership of their own bodies. Miller describes the ‘exhilarating sense of exploration’ with which ‘women demystified their bodies’, citing as a crucial marker the publication of a still-revolutionary women’s health guide, Our Bodies,\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n19\n\nOurselves (1973), by the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective.46 This frank project to wrest women’s health care from the control of the male-dominated medical profession met with fierce opposition from conservative forces. Our Bodies, Ourselves (1973) In 1969, participants at a women’s conference in Boston gathered to discuss their experiences as women. For many of them, it was the first time that they had done so. They were, in their own words, ‘both a very ordinary and a very special group, as women are everywhere’: Our ages range from twenty-five to forty-one, most of us are from middleclass backgrounds and have had at least some college education, and some of us have professional degrees. Some of us are married, some of us are separated, and some of us are single. Some of us have children of our own, some of us like spending time with children, and others of us are not sure we want to be with children.47\n\nAs the group encounter progressed, the women realised that they shared a ‘similar feeling of frustration and anger toward specific doctors and the medical maze in general’; they all ‘wanted to do something about those doctors who were condescending, paternalistic, judgmental and noninformative’. (11) Knowledge of women’s bodies – their own bodies – was, they had found, the jealously guarded preserve of mostly male ‘experts’ whose guardianship of that knowledge conferred upon them an almost tyrannical power. Collectively, the women agreed what each of them had felt separately: ‘Our bodies are the physical bases from which we move out into the world; ignorance, uncertainty – even at worst, shame – about our physical selves create in us an alienation from ourselves that keeps us from being the whole people that we could be.’ (13) The women agreed to meet over a period of ten to twelve sessions, finding all the while that they could ‘discuss, question and argue with each other in a new spirit of cooperation rather than competition’ with medical experts. (11) In 1973, as the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective, they published the results of their sessions, the groundbreaking Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women. Part practical guide, part political manifesto and part intellectual statement, Our Bodies, Ourselves contained essays on a range of topics – anatomy, physiology, sexuality, reproduction, nutrition, childbearing, menopause. More defiantly, chapters on abortion, rape, birth control, venereal disease, self-defence and lesbianism challenged any assumption that women should remain passive objects at the mercy of microbes or men. Women’s anger – and their right to be angry – were explicitly justified and defended: ‘We have been asked why this is exclusively a book about women, and why we have restricted our course to women. Our answer is that we are women and, as women, do\n\n20\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s not consider ourselves experts on men (as men through the centuries have presumed to be experts on us).’ (12) Underlying the Collective’s anger was a situation that could not have been shared by men, as one of the book’s most resounding passages implies: Picture a woman trying to do work and to enter into equal and satisfying relationships with other people – when she feels physically weak because she has never tried to be strong; when she drains her energy trying to change her face, her figure, her hair, her smells, to match some ideal norm set by magazines, movies and TV; when she feels confused and ashamed of the menstrual blood that every month appears from some dark place in her body; when her internal body processes are a mystery to her and surface only to cause her trouble (an unplanned pregnancy, or cervical cancer); when she does not understand or enjoy sex and concentrates her sexual drives to aimless romantic fantasies, perverting and misusing a potential energy because she has been brought up to deny it. (13)\n\nOut of the shared realisation, the anger and the concerted effort to research and to pool their experiences in the development of a ‘critique’, the Collective reflected upon their ‘crucial and formative experiences’, sensing their ‘potential power as a force for political and social change’. (13) It is this correct assumption that makes Our Bodies, Ourselves one of the most important documents of the American 1970s. As one of the many poems interspersed with the essays declares: ‘Our anger is changing our faces, our bodies. / Our anger is changing our lives’ (15) The practical and political activism begins with an evaluation of ‘the institutions that are supposed to meet our health needs – the hospitals, clinics, doctors, medical schools, nursing schools, public health departments, Medicaid bureaucracies and so on’. (13) The doctors in particular come in for a stringent re-evaluation – one ultimately leading to an adjustment in power relations: Understanding the medical terminology means that we now can understand the things the doctors say. Knowing their language makes medical people less mysterious and frightening. We now feel more confident when asking questions. Sometimes a doctor has been startled to find us speaking ‘his’ language. ‘How do you know that? Are you a medical student?’ we heard again and again. ‘A pretty girl like you shouldn’t be concerned about that’. (25)\n\nThe re-evaluation – and the seizure of knowledge – was profound: ‘For some of us it was the first time we had looked critically, and with strength, at the existing institutions serving us’. (13) The project thus culminated in a series of practical, viable alternatives for women, underpinned by a ‘Model Patients’ Bill of Rights’ (355) and a series of models for grass-roots organising (fund-raising, mutual help groups, self-help groups, a homebirth and birth-centres movement), all intended to fight against ‘the inhumane legal restrictions, the imperfections of available contraceptives, the poor sex education, the highly priced and poorly administered health care\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n21\n\nthat keep too many women from having this crucial control over their bodies’. (13) One of the most significant aspects of Our Bodies, Ourselves is the voice it gives to the previously silenced, whose reflections run throughout the book: I wanted to be a doctor, but I was told in direct and indirect ways that my ultimate ambition should be marrying a doctor and raising a family. I gave up my dream. (18) Every time my husband has free time he sits down and reads a book. We both have a sense that this is really important. When I have free time I sit and crochet or read, and it feels as if I am doing nothing. (19) I went with other women on a trip south almost two years ago. This was the first time I had gone on a trip without my husband. Several things went wrong with the car on the trip. When I came back to Boston I decided that I really wanted to learn how to take care and be in control of a car myself. I learned about auto mechanics. It required a lot of work and discipline. In a way, I identify with the car. There is a connection between my feelings of wanting to take care and control of my life and the feelings of wanting to take care and control of my car. (22)\n\nThe publication of Our Bodies, Ourselves prompted a massive outcry from conservative and reactionary Americans. As Carroll explains: The issue of sexual censorship touched directly on feminist concerns. Historically, conservatives had used obscenity laws to prevent dissemination of birth control information, and in 1978 a Montana school district banned the feminist health publication Our Bodies, Ourselves. ‘I’m sick and tired of hearing the cry of censorship,’ stated a Helena prosecutor. ‘We’ve genuflected at the altar of free speech for too long.’48\n\nBut the reactions were clearly prompted by more than the frank discussions of birth control, masturbation, abortion and rape. As the Collective declared: ‘This kind of body education has been liberating for us and may be a starting point for the liberation of many other women.’ (12) This was not good news for the reactionary old guard, also flexing their muscles in the 1970s.\n\nThe concerted cultural assertion of the women’s movement was matched by the activism of other American victims of discrimination throughout the decade. In June 1970, five thousand gay men and women marched to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New York. The previous year, police officers had raided a gay bar, the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, prompting days of pitched battles on the streets. As Miller explains: Police often surveyed homosexual bars, but if a gay or lesbian frequenter of a bar such as Stonewall observed codes of sexual nuance and invitation, he or she was somewhat safe. However, in 1969, when numerous\n\n22\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\narrests were made at the Stonewall bar, it seemed as if even the observance of this code in the confines of a gay bar was little guarantee against the police’s interpretation of acceptable sexual communication and the rights of a certain group to assemble. Backed, in a manner of speaking, to the stone wall, ‘Stonewall’ began to connote not as much a shield against unwarranted inquiry as a stand for self-identity in the public realm.49\n\nThe Stonewall Riots are thus still remembered as a turning point in the struggle for civil rights among gays and lesbians; after all, as Michael Bronski recalls, ‘in the early 1960s, homosexuals were interviewed on television seated behind potted palms to hide their identities. In 1972, Jill Johnston, Village Voice dance critic, announced her lesbianism on the Dick Cavett Show, flashed a big smile, and waved “Hi Mom!” ’50 The watershed that was Stonewall ‘established a homosexual militancy and identity in the public imagination that was startling and deeply threatening’ to preservationists of an older order, who now had to accept the existence of the Gay Liberation Front.51 Gay rights and feminist activism combined in the early 1970s to prompt interrogations of masculinity, spawning what Schulman describes as ‘a vast, self-conscious men’s movement’, beginning with the establishment in 1970 of the country’s first centre for men in Berkeley, California, and developing into such practices as ‘men’s forums and consciousness-raising groups’, ‘weekend retreats in the woods, men’s studies sections in bookstores’ and other signals in response to this apparent crisis of male identity – a perceived ‘shift from John Wayne to Alan Alda . . . from the strong, silent type to the sensitive New Age male’.52 Contributing to the nascent ‘men’s movement’ were such tracts as Herb Goldberg’s The Hazards of Being Male (1976), a psychological study, and James Hillman’s Puer Papers (1979), an anthropological study on the archetype of the ‘eternal boy’. In addition to women’s and gay rights militancy, and spawning similar reactive trends, ethnic assertion in the 1970s marked a further arena of grass-roots activism. In East Los Angeles, Chicanos (Americans of Mexican descent) began the decade – in August 1970 – with a moratorium and a march of thirty thousand strong, not only to protest against the Vietnam War but also to emphasise the connections between the war abroad and racism at home. The ‘Brown Berets’, as the students in the vanguard of the moratorium called themselves, evoked a militant activism shared by other ethnic groups such as the\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n23\n\nAmerican Indian Movement (AIM), whose strategies throughout the 1970s included the mass seizure of Federal facilities that had begun with the occupation of Alcatraz Island in 1969, and climaxed with the occupation of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973. Militant groups such as these took some of their cues from the Black Panthers who, by 1970, had shifted from the project of black internationalism (spearheaded by co-founders Bobby Seale and Huey Newton) to that of ‘Black Power’. The militant activism of the Panthers at the end of the 1960s, exacerbated by shoot-outs among themselves and against the FBI and the police, resulted in a series of high-profile murder trials which, in turn, attracted a curious rash of celebrity attention. Tom Wolfe, Gail Sheehy and other journalists took note of the Panthers’ celebrity and the ‘Radical Chic’ that fed it. The phrase comes from Wolfe’s 1970 essay for New York Magazine describing a fund-raising event for the Panthers hosted by the composer and orchestra conductor, Leonard Bernstein: The Field Marshal of the Black Panther Party has been sitting in a chair between the piano and the wall. He rises up; he has the hard-rock look, all right; he is a big tall man with brown skin and an Afro and a goatee and a black turtleneck much like Lenny’s, and he stands up beside the piano, next to Lenny’s million-dollar chatchka flotilla of family photographs. In fact, there is a certain perfection as the first Black Panther rises within a Park Avenue living room to lay the Panthers’ ten-point program on New York Society in the age of Radical Chic.53\n\nAs Michael E. Staub observes, the ‘demonizing rhetoric’ that characterised public discussion of the Panthers eventually shifted to ‘trivializations [that] would finally present the Black Panther member more as oversexed media sweetheart than violence-prone social menace’.54 But it is important not to let such dramatic events (and their highly stylised coverage) obscure perhaps more significant events, such as the first presidential candidacy of an African American woman, Shirley Chisholm, in 1972, four years after she had become the first African American woman elected to Congress. Until the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in 2007, no other woman – black or white – had come closer to securing the nomination of the Democratic Party, which Chisholm ultimately lost to Senator George McGovern. All these developments indicate that diverse identity markers were being firmly posited, defended and advanced in the 1970s. But almost inevitably, as gender, sexuality and ethnicity emerged as subjectivities\n\n24\n\nAmerican Culture in the 1970s\n\nto be claimed and reinvented, in the midst of this drastic reformation of a culture out to foreground ‘diversity’, agents of reactionary conservatism rallied to defend their own conceptions of normality. As Staub argues, during the 1960s ‘sophisticated anti-Left strategies were already being tested and refined, and these trends intensified at the turn of the seventies’.55 Moreover, the decade saw the firm coupling of reactionary conservatism with Christian fundamentalism, setting in train an alliance that remains politically and culturally potent to this day.\n\nChristian Fundamentalism and Neoconservatism In 1970, Hal Lindsay published the book that would outsell all other non-fiction books in the United States in the 1970s, The Late, Great Planet Earth. With the book of Revelations as his primary road map, Lindsay offered a host of geopolitical predictions leading to the conclusion that ‘some time in the future there will be a seven-year period climaxed by the visible return of Jesus Christ’ – a seven-year period that ‘couldn’t begin until the Jewish people re-established their nation in their ancient homeland of Palestine’.56 Such fundamentalist belief has underpinned conservative American support for the defence of Israel consistently championed by such powerful American evangelists as Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Billy Graham, all of whom have claimed that Christians are better friends of the Jewish state than are most American Jews. As Falwell said, ‘It’s my belief that the Bible Belt in America is Israel’s only safety belt.’57 Schulman has reviewed ‘the mounting influence of evangelical Christianity’ in the 1970s: In 1976, Jimmy Carter, a born-again Baptist, became president of the United States. In 1980, revivalist Billy Graham’s newspaper, Decision, reached a circulation of 24 million. Religious radio stations numbered over a thousand, broadcasting the good news along with more than one hundred Christian television stations. The so-called televangelists – Jim Bakker, Pat Robertson, Jimmy Swaggart, Oral Roberts – became national figures, and later figures of national scandal. Polls revealed that nearly half of Americans regarded the Bible as the actual word of God. A sizeable majority claimed they had ‘no doubts’ Jesus would return to earth, and 80 percent expressed the belief that they would appear before God on Judgment Day.58\n\nEven the denizens of the left were not immune: the 1970s was the decade of Bob Dylan’s conversion to fundamentalist Christianity,\n\nThe Intellectual Context\n\n25\n\nculminating in his Christian-themed album, Slow Train Coming (1979), which Sounes calls ‘one of the most extreme career changes of any mainstream rock star of the decade’.59 Fundamentalist Christianity was one of the strongest forces to fill the vacuum left by the disintegration of what political theorists have called the post-war ‘liberal consensus’. In spite of the dominance of anti-Communism and Cold War hostility, liberal voters had managed to secure the election of a New Deal Democrat – Lyndon Johnson – over the Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. While Johnson’s presidency was overshadowed by the escalation of the Vietnam War, he is rightly credited with advancing much of the New Deal agenda into the 1960s and beyond through his ‘Great Society’ programme. The Civil Rights and the Voting Rights acts, the ‘War on Poverty’, Medicare, Medicaid, the national endowments for the arts and humanities and public broadcasting are all part of Johnson’s legacy. Reacting against what they perceived as left-wing social engineering, increasingly conservative critics, such as Irving Kristol, began to challenge the dominance of liberal policymakers as the ‘Great Society’ took hold. In 1965, Kristol had founded the journal The Public Interes"
