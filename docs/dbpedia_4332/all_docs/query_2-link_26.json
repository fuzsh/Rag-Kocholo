        "text": "Thank you so much for the information that you gave concerning Annie Elizabeth Hart.You are Correct she married George Sizemore son of Ed \"Old Ned\" Sizemore.She was the daughter of William Jackson and Winnie(Greene)Jackson.William Jackson took on this white name, it is my understanding, to blend in.His indian name was Chief Bear Hart.I am still trying to find proof and do more research on these wonderful families.The Greene's and Jackson's are of Native American decent. \"Aruna\" was Annie Elizabeth's indian name. We have found some information on the Greene's and they were cherokee. It is my theory that Chief Bear Hart, Aruna Hart (Annie Elizabeth Jackson)her mother Winnie Greene were cherokee."
