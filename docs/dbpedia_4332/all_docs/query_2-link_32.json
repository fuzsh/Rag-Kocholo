        "meta_description": "Check out this horse on Gavelhouse. *** UPDATE - NEMO HAS JUST BEEN SCOPED TODAY AND HAS A  PEEFECT GRADE 1 SCOPE ***\n\n\nFINDING NEMO is by Ekraar out of stakes placed Trudy Tee. He was looking like a very talented horse early in his career, he was an impressive trial winner who won very well on debut. He has also had a few placings including coming from last to run second on a premier race day. He has only had 10 starts so still has plenty of racing left in him. Since lockdown he has mixed his form, fresh up he ran a big race for second to crowning star. He then had a disappointing run before bouncing back again to run 4th. \n\nThis horse has more wins left in him. He is an absolute gem to have in work and is very easy to train. He has no vices, is correct, very sound and clean legged. Very good feet.  He is also great to use for working with babies etc. He is fit and ready to carry on racing straight away. Realistic reserve, we just need to move a few racehorses on to make way for the 2yos coming through otherwise we would continue with him.  \n\nPhotos etc taken after his last start so is his current body condition. \nAlso see walking video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHkeXd4oPB8",
