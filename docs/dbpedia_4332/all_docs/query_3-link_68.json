Muhlenberg College, Allentown, Pa,, September 23, 1936 No. 1 Dr. Robert C. Horn Remains In Office As Head of College Will Continue As Acting President For Present Term Dr. Haas Will Live in Town; Will Conduct Student Conferences SUCCESSOR TO OFFICE OF PRESIDENT UNNAMED Acting President Hi, Robert C. Horn will continue for ill least part of the present academic year in the capacity of acting president This announce- ment was made from the platform during the opening exercises of the college held in the Science auditorium, on Monday morning. Coupled with the announcement concerning the acting president is the r.otice which informs that President Emeritus Haas will be available to the student body, for conference periods, during the coming year. It is believed that the student-s will feel more at ease in calling upon Dr. Haas now than they would have been, had he re- mained in office. Dr. Horn served the college last year in the capacity of Dean, a position which he has filled during the past several years. In addi- tion to the office of Dean, Dr. Horn was the Mosser-Kock Professor of the Creek language and literature. The new acting-president was burn at Charleston, South Carolina and received his elementary educa- tion there. tie graduated from Muhlenberg with the class of 1000 and received his Master of Arts here in lOO.'i and at Harvard in 1904. He holds the degree of Doc- tor of Philosophy from the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania and that of Doctor of Literature from Muh- lenberg. His sen-ice as dean dates from 1330. At the present time no outstand- ing candidate for the presidency is being considered. Pep Smoker Scheduled For Lafayette Opener Mr K M.

All freshmen are required to be present; roll will be taken. The support of the upper classmen is also urged. A short snappy program has been planned which wilt include a ew words from Coach Julian and his assistants, Hillen and Carney. There is also a possibility that the team may be present. Outstand- ing alumni and friends of the Cardinal and Gray have been en- gaged to add color to the affair. The band and the new cheer lead- ing staff will be on hand to whoop things up. Pipes and cigarettes will be dis- tributed to provide the smoke; npples and pretzels will be used tu supply chewing material during the speeches. A pajama parade may follow the meeting in the Science auditorium. Chapel Choir Will Have Big Schedule Dr. Harold K.

Auditions were hold Friday and Monday afternoons, to which many new men together with former choristers responded. First tenors, as usual, were at a minimum. An- nouncements of the successful ap- plicant* will be made before Fri- day. Communications have already been received from churches in Matich Chunk and Quiikertown. In previous years an average of liftecn engagements, together with several brosnk-asts lias been the schedule of the forty members.

The in- stallation of three communion ser- vices during the year also met with the approval of the entire cabinet. In addition the enbincl sanctioned the work of the relig- ious committee in conducting daily morning devotions in the commons. The president instructed the social committee to take care of the pep smoker Friday night preceding the Lafayette garni-, aait nisi, tin- fnc- ulty reception. This morning at 11:00 o'clock a new series of chapel services will be inaugurated by a Communion service for the faculty, their wives and the student members of Muh- lenberg college. Formerly only one Communion service was held during the year that one being held on Ash Wed- nesday. During the year the M. C. A. i will sponger three Communion services for the college in the Eg- ner-Hartzell Memorial chapel. It is hoped that the students will turn out for these inspirational services. Another feature to this year's comm union services is that the professors' wives will also par- take of the communion. All the pastors of the college will help ad- minister the communion scrvieo which is particularly impressive in the college atmosphere. The Muhlenberg band starts this season with sixty members report- ing for the first rehearsal hist Thursday. Many of this large group are freshmen who have had previous experience as musicians. The comet and clarinet sections have increased considerably; how- ever there is still a demand for good drummers. The director, Prof. Soltys, told the members of several improve- ments and additions for the com- ing year. A \"Glockenspiel\" has been purchased for use in march- ing. Some very snappy numbers will be used this year in order to bring about still more precision and speed in drilling and the form- ing of letters. New lights have been installed in the band i on in and some college owned instru- ments have been repaired. Director Soltys and his enlarged band, inspired by their excellent drilling as photographed at the Ford bam game last November, will journey to I'enn State and West Point to displuy the same tech- nique. PRESENTS PICTURE OK MODERN STUDENT LIFE The \"Challenge of Democracy to E\"ocation\" was the address upon th< occasion of the opening of the college for the academic year — 1938-1037 by Dr. Carl W. Boyei , professor of Education, Monday nn-ining in the Science auditorium. Th\" professor, in reviewing an ar- ticl ■ appearing in \"Fortune\" mag- a/. , June 103(1, entitled \"Youth i-i liege\" asserted that the pie- tun was certainly not startling, bui i-ather lacked that goal which dem icraey urges. From the picture presented by the article — that of college students of to-day being interested in security; intellectual- ly i nious about the world; ten- di y to turn to new leaders; not ve radical, vaguely desirous of cul.ure and the Good of life; comes tl \" challenge — the challenge our form of Democracy makes upon the prevailing system of educa- tion, Dr. Buyer defined Demo- cracy \"as a government by the consent of those governed\". He ex- ph.ined that the challenges are Buttle on our Aims of modern Edu- Ci ii numely; Command of Fun- di eiitals; Health Education; W rthy Home membership; Civic I; -■risibility; Vocational Educa- tion; Worthy use of leisure time.

I will be very glad to see any students, who may have problems to discuss, baiweni the hour of ten and eleven o'clock. Definite appoint- ments can be made through my secretary, Mrs. Keller, in room 102 in the Administration Building. JOHN A. W. HAAS, President Emeritus. Gone are the days when l he clang of the fire bell stirred the blood of 'Berg students to madly dashing about the campus in search of the blaze. A siren, sim- ilar to that used by Dick Tracey of the famous \"G\" men and the Texaco Fire chief, now graces the first floor. There can be no excuse for not hearing it, as it sounds like a cow in trouble. The entire fire-alarm system has had its face lifted. No longer will the lovers of darkness find solace and comfort in the dormitory quadrangle. A spotlight, akin to an air-route beacon has been placed on the dormitories of West Berks, light- ing the campus surrounding the Dormitories. This is said to have been a preventive measure to keep the female admirers of the grid heroes off the campus. It is also reported that the light is visible from points north of Harris burg, on a clear night. By the looks of things in the stadium, great things are expected of Julian and his proteges, for ex- tra stands to accommodate 1400 people are being added at both ends of the field in back of the goal posts. It won't be long until the Cardinal and Gray gridiron will be entirely closed in by stands to entertain the anticipated crowds. All these things add to the glory of Muhlenberg \"University\" — the new rating given our fair institu- tion by the Saturday morning an- nouncer of the local radio station. The Information bureau, located in the Ad building lobby, was a helpful feature introduced this year and conducted by the M. C. A. Cabinet during Freshman Week. Its mission, that of aiding the new- men in adjusting themselves, -was an invaluable service to Registrar \"Haps\" Benfer, The \"M\" Handbook, printed this year for every student in the Col- lege, was distributed through this agency. A permanent Bureau fur future Freshman weeks will be establish- ed as a result of the success of the experiment. SYMPATHY The Weekly takes this first opportunity to express the deep sympathy both of the student body and tha staff to Acting President Robert C.

I'a.. September T.i, 193fi WELCOME Muhlenberg college cordially welcomes the class of 1940 to its campus. This year's freshmen class constitutes one of the largest classes to be enrolled at the opening of the school term, an indication that Muhlenberg is taking its stand as one of the foremost small colleges in eastern Pennsylvania. Whether Muhlenberg will continue to grow depends much upon you, class of 1940. If you came to college with the idea that it must give you everything without any effort on your part, it will be better that you change your minds, for reward comes only to those who labor. If you want to get anything out of your four years of college life, you must put something into it. There is much to be gained and nothing to be lost. You have the association of your classmates and upper classmen, of the alumni, and of the professors. You have a chance to develop yourselves scholastically, spiritually and athletically. Whether you will leave the walls of this college feeling that you have made something of yourself is entirely dependent on the foundation you are now building. It is only for you to take hold of everything offered you. The next four years will prove, we think, to be the most pleasant years you have lived through. True, there are problems In l>; met. but with the right will they can be MUtlly surmounted. Cooperation with your fellow students and with the professors will mean much to you. You must all pull together in order to attain your end. Once more we congratulate you upon your opportunity to enter Muhlenberg college. Its traditions are your tradi- tions, its friends are your friends. Here is a golden oppor- tunity for you— seize it and hold it. THETA KAPPA NU There was quite a representa- tion of colleges when the frater- nity house was open to men stu- dents of the summer school. Among the colleges represented were Muhlenberg, Notre Dame, Villanova, Northwestern, Temple, Gettysburg, and Lehigh. The an- nual summer meeting of Pennsyl- vania Epsifon chapter, when plans were formulated for the opening of school, was held on August 17, and was topped off in the evening with an informal party that was attended by many alumni, in addi- tion to the brothers. Brothers Roger Rohn, 'Berg '35, and Jack Greenawald, 'Berg \"i2, were both married during the past summer. Brother Alfred O. Breinig, '35, will be married on December 3, 1936. A s far as vocations were concern- ed. Brothers Boh Pharo and Justin Howere spent the latter part of the summer on a motor trip, which included a visit to the Cleveland and Texas Expositions; Archon Bianco sojourned at Lake Har- mony for two weeks ; Brother Tom- my Thomas enjoyed a two-week trip to various shore points in New Jersey; pledge Sully Stannick spent a few weeks in New York City at the home of brother Henry ! S. Walter. Scribe George J. Jo- seph was chosen the runner-up to the champion in the Lehigh Valley championship fox trot content at Dorney Park last month. An informal party was held at the house last Saturday night to welcome the brothers who are re- turning to school this year. The fraternity house will undergo a complete renovation, inside and out, and will be refurnished during the latter part of October. The house is now being put in order for a danee to be held the night of the Lafayette game. Lectures Dominate Assembly Program Dr. W. A.

The green grass may be fasti) turning to a withered brown, but that inspiring green is far from lacking on the Muhlenberg campus, one hundred and fifty freshmen (greener than the apples of Junr. but not as sour, we hope) having taken the campus by storm. Anyway, it sure does this old sophomore's heart good to ponder over a few of last year's ridings and rub his hands in de- lightful anticipation. Lest we forget. I am taking this occasion of reminding the class of '39 of a certain pledge tr< made at last year's freshmen banquet. And so a brotherly welcome to the class of '40. hut never forget the dink, button, black tie, matches. Alma Mater. Fair Muhlenberg, and back steps. • * * * • And they owe it at! to dear old Muhlenberg George J. Joseph, that old maestro of the ballrooms, and his titian-haired dancing part- ner were chosen as the prize couple In one of the eliminations of the Lehigh Valley fox-trot contest at Dorney Park this summer, while Gene Grossman, another one of the accomplished in the art of the slippery glides, was given a second prize in one of the eliminations. Georgie and Gene went on to compete in the finals, the grand finale finding brilliant titiaii-hair almost completely sirening the judges, George and his partner being adjudged the runners-up. When we con- sider the fact that two out of the eight couples who competed in the finals were commandeered by our own little 'Berg boys, we must admit that we're not doing so bad, after all, so hail to our heroes of the terji- sichorean world! ***** Last year this column explained the reason for a then-budding tend between Tommy Baker and Henry Philips as a certain 'Hubbies' whom they had both been (|uite acquainted with. Time marches on and so does Mussolini's army, hut what we're getting at is the fact that since then we have seen Tommy and Bubbles together at twenty-two dances, and during these twenty -two nights we have counted a total of two hundred and twenty rounds that they have danced together. Down your way, darling freshmen, they may call it \"gitlin' kinda fameelyar\", but » round here we have our own ideas. Our most tender sym pal hies to Philips; Baker is And we didn't have to go to the Rocky Mountains, either, to see the Grand Canyon. All we did was sit back and watch a certain frosh as he observed Rollin Shaffer going into his 'Muhlenberg Swing' on the football field a few days ago. That boy Shaffer sure can hold his audience; the gap in the frosh'a mouth was large enough to hold a carload of dixie melons, with plenty of room for the box ear. --Tommy Thomas and Sully Stanick arguing it out over a game of ping-pong. Jimmy Harps and his party craze. That grim, sober, silent conclave in the locker room before each Greek class. My first look-around in the college store wondering what sort of gift would be the matchirsl with red hair. The red hair eventually changed to blonde; women have such versatile trends, you know. DEVOTION. 4 LS PLANNED FOR COLLEGE COMMONS Daily devotional services, lack- ing for many years in our College Commons, have come to be a real- ity through the efforts of the Muhlenberg Christian Association. The religious committee an- nounced that the service to be in- augurated would consist of a prayer, hymn, and scripture read- ing. These devotions will be in charge of the members of the fac- ulty who will alternate throughout the week. The service which should prove to be of great value as an inspir- ational start for each day, will be- gin promptly at 7:30, when the doors are lucked. The students are already antici- pating these devotional services. They in themselves show the great Christian influence the col- lege maintains among its students. ATHLETIC OUTLOOK In a few days the 1936 edition of the Muhlenberg foot- bail squad will take the field against a team which represents a college about six times as large as our Alma Mater. A piti- fully small squad remains from the pre-season practices held at our first foothall camp sessions. Many familiar faces will be missing from the Cardinal and Gray line-up on Saturday. But, rest assured, the faces that do appear on the team will be the faces of men who have earned the right to be there. Coaeh Julian has started in the best manner; fooling and horsing around during practice is a thing of the past. He should know that the student body is all for him and his methods; we believe the team feels the same way. A glance at the schedule would convince a stranger that the team must be one of the nation's leaders, in order to play with such company. It is also regrettable that the students will have only three opportunities to observe their classmates in action on the home field. A note of warning should be struck for the henefit of those individuals who look for a Hashy eleven as the result of the coaching staff shake-up. Let it be remembered that the coach must use material remaining from the old regime. Let it also be remembered that the new coach has lost the ser- vices of many of last year's players. The new starting line- ups will be radically changed from those awaiting the kick- off signal last year. The main thing for the student body to do at present is to \"stand up and cheer.\" The playing of the team, in the second half particularly, will in part reflect the cheering of the undergraduates. The freshmen should remember that on Saturday they should not only be seen but most definitely heard. THETA UPSILON OMEGA The house was occupied by the girl summer school students throughout the summer, and fol- lowing the summer term the first Hoor of the house was completely renovated. Brother Herman Doep- per attended the wedding of his brother Paul in Wisconsin this summer. Paul is a Muhlenberg graduate and an alumnus of T. U. O. Lloyd Nelson spent two weeks vacationing in Miami, Florida. An informal party, for the bro- thers only, was held at the frater- nity house last Saturday evening. PHI KAPPA TAU The fraternity house was closed throughout the summer and under- went renovations in the form of a refurnished living room and re- painted rooms on the second floor.

Phil Hillen, former Villatiuva l collect star tackle and line coach at Muhlenberg under Coach C eorgo Hoist rom in the 1980 and 1931 seasons, has returned to net as line coach and first lieutenant to Alvin \"Doggie\" Julian. Hillen, who played four seasons of varsity football at Villa nova un- der Harry Stuhklrehcr, is a native of Carnegie, Pa, and played on the football, basketball and baseball teams coached by Birney Crum while the latter coached there. Hillen has been coaching the Carnegie High school football team for the past two seasons and has been associated with his father' in business there. The yearling eleven will be di- rected this season by Harold Car- ney of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Carney, a former Albright Col- lege line star, was Freshman coach at Albright last season, and in ad- dition has coached semi-pro learns in Reading. He played with the Providence Steam Rollers in pro- 1 fessionul football, after four years of varsity play at Albright under I t'oach Alvin Julian, now at Muh- lenberg. He graduated from Al- bright in Hi:i0. Alvin Julian, new head coach was delighted with the announce- ment that Carney had been select- ed. \"He'a a mighty good man to get,\" said Julian, \"and he'll fit in nicely with my plans. He knows my style of coaching and will be a big help in the development of players.\" The selection of Carney means an entire new coaching regime at Muhlenberg and all three are grad- uates of colleges other than Muh- lenberg. Julian comes here after coaching Ashland High to the state championship. He now has two assistants, one a complete stranger and the other returning after an absence of five years, to iiid him in lifting the face of 'Berg athletics. Football Training 1 Camp Big Success Many Former Varsity Players Absent Due To Injuries Or Hard Pressure The \"survival of the fittest\" adage was used by Berg's efficient coach at the football training camp, Camp Miller, located three miles from Stroudsbtirg, at Shawnee-on- the-Delaware; but \"Doggie\" be- lieves that the two weeks spent there have given hint a good nu- cleus to put on the field. For the first time in the history of the col- lege the team went to a camp for its pre-season workouts and for the first time, also, varsity letter- men as well as new-comers were i dropped from the squad or quit of their own accord because of the pressure. Since the squad encamped, ten players, several of whom saw a great deal of action in the previous two years of varsity competition, were shipped home. Coach Julian has been bearing down on (he team but he is satisfied that the two dozen players now on hand will prove to be in good condition. The Cardinal and Gray coaches held two practice sessions every day, the first starting at 8:30 in the morning and lasting until around noon, and the second start- ing at 2 o'clock and lasting until five, with blackboard talks in the evening. The spirit among the boys was the best and their willingness to pitch in and work hard helped a SCORE STORY Football relations have exist- ed between the Leopards of La- fayette and Muhlenberg for many ; rears. Since 1925 the Mules have never known victory over th ! Eastonniers. The scores of the gridiron contests between the two insti- tut ions since 1925 are as fol- lows; Year Muhlenberj; Lafayette 1926 14 20 1926 35 1 !«.*'! 7 38 1928 1) 5(5 1929 23 1 930 13 1 <Xi 1 26 1932 11 g 193:1 20 1934 19 1MB 7 great deal. Upon his return Julian was none too confident about the year's schedule, but ventured to My l hat 'Berg would at least play sixty-minute football. Injuries were numerous at the camp, with Ray Thompson, Claude Figgs and Lloyd Zimmerman, all linemen, being sent home early in the first week and Thomas Ken- nedy, John McKee and Dietrich being on the side-lines for a few days. However, it is expected that the latter three will see action early in the season. Among the non-players and coaches at camp were Doctor Clif- ford C. Trexler, trainer Scotty Renwlch and managers VVendling and Carretson.

DR. HOYER DELIVERS OPENING ADDRESS K:„iULnued from PiEft One* formal, Dt, Boyer chose 1. Crime, because we have the biggest Crime bill of any country in the world. \"Our educational philosophy has not met this challenge of \"estab- lishing justice\" or of providing \"do- mestic tranuuility\". 2. Economic Confusion. & Social Experimenta- tion, because our educational phil- osophy is not leading to life, lib- erty and the pursuit of happiness. 4. Religious Agnosticism and Atheism. 5. Scientific Dogmatism. H. Pragmatic Determinism. 7. Na- tionalistic Demoralization vs. In- ternationalistic Toleration. Professor Boyer concluded his results with the belief that a little spark of Rennnisance is on the horizon. \"We do not have to be ipjite as ashamed today as many were a few years ago — to say: Yes — I'm an American, I'm a patriot — I believe in America and by- heaven's I'll fight for it.\" The speaker considered one point of view as to the possible remedial measures through not- ability of education— the fitting of the aims, organization, content and methods to the particular needs, interests, capacities and skills of the individual learner. He urged that college or higher education should accept only those whose iri 1 1 s nt\" intelligence and strength foreshadow future leadership. Dr. Boyer concluded his address with the challenge to the entire student body — \"Will you be able, through the help of God, yourself, your friends and Muhlenberg col- lege, to stand erect, clear eyed and clear headed. Will you answer the challenge of democracy ? How will you answer it?\" STUDENT HANDBOOK IS PUBLISHED BY M. C. A.

If satisfactory arrangements can be made the date will be Novem- ber 13th and 14th. It is hoped that it will be made possible to take the delegates U> Lehigh uni- versity to see the Muhlenberg-Le- high football game on the Satur- day of that week-end. Other tent- ative plans call for several plays tn be presented Friday night, a pos- sible dance Friday night at the college and a formal banquet and dance at some point off the camp- js on Saturday evening. The staff of The Muhlenberg Weekly is putting forth all efforts to assure the visiting collegiate journalists an interesting wcck-i ml on the local campus. Not the least of the present plans designates the choice of a nationally-famous news- paperman as the speaker of the evening, at the Saturday evening banquet. All arrangements are an yet, however, in the state of being tent- ative plans, pending approval from association ollicinls. As soon as this approval is secured concrete steps will be taken and the rough spots smoothed in order that Muh- lenberg may prove to be a real host. Acting-President Horn and Ueg- ■ nir Bcnfcr are extending their belt effort* to give the convention >:ic best provisions while the dele- gates are making their temporary domes on our campus. Some idea of the extent of the convention may be gained when it is pointed out that the association numbers about thirty-five out- standing collegiate newspapers. Close to two hundred delegates will attend the convention. The spring convention of the association was held May 1 and 2. at the University of Delaware.

O. Combined Groups Will Give Three-Act Play The acceptance of the agreement between the Chimes club and the Mask and Dagger club for a joint production probably of three acts, and the election of a treasurer to succeed Joseph Osman were the main items of business conducted by the Mask and Dagger club at their first meeting of the year in charge of President Charles Diehl and Drs. Jackson and Brown, held last Thursday afternoon in room 109. A letter of thanks was read from Mrs. Conklin, wife of Dr. Conklin formerly of the college English department for the co- operation and the gifts received. Frank Griffith was elected treas- urer of the chili in the place of Jo- seph Osman, who has left school. Try-outs for the play to be given at the college theatre will be held in the near future by Miss Agnes Howe of Cedar Crest and Drs, Brown and Jackson of Muhlenberg, Last year's program consisted of two three-act plays and one one- act play, \"Luff That Off\", a com- edy, was presented in December and \"His House in Order\" was pre- sented in May, in cooperation with the Ladies' Auxiliary. \"Box and Cox\" was presented as the one-act feature in assembly during March.

William Griffin, former president of the inter-fraternity council, is tailing a meeting of that body at the Theta Upsilon Omega house on Wednesday at TtSO p. m. to de- termine the officers according to the new constitution. This consti- tution calls for rotation of the offices among the different frater- nities each semester. The council consists of a repre- sentation of each of the four na- tional and one local fraternity on the campus. Besides arranging the \"rushing\" dates the council al- so checks up on any infractions of the constitution of the body by any of its member organizations.

Nomination of class officers will be the important business of the group. It is expected that the Ciarla financial report will be pre- sented at this time. The Editor- in-Chief of the 1937 Ciarla was Rollin G. SchafTer. It is urgent that all seniors at- tend the first class meeting of the term. Strange and amusing tales from the football training charters, Camp Miller, are beginning to come to the surface as time march- es on. There is one particularly flue story concerning \"Woody\" Wend- ling and a bag of fruit. It seems that Phil Hillen, ass is i- ant coach, hail been laid up for a few days. He was given quarters in a mom apart from the rest of the staff so that he might have quiet. \"Woody\" knew that he was in this nil ml. And so . , . One night a couple of the managers left the camp for a bit of recreation, \"Woody\" among them. The next morning Woody went into the room Hillen occupied and saw Hillen was absent. Shortly after the manager was called on the carpet because, he was told, Hillen had been taken dangerously ill the night before and had to be rushed to the Stroudsbuig hospi- tal and \"Woody\" wasn't there to furnish the transportation. Wendling was all apologies and asked what be might do to moke amends. He was told it might help if he were to go into Stroudsburg and take Hillen a bag of fruit. tiff goes \"Woody\" with some other members of the staff for company. He drives to Strouds- burg and purchases a big bag of very tine fruit. Thence tn the hospital. Going tn the information desl; \"Woody\" requests the number of Hilleu's room. But . . . all the re- turn he gets is a look of \"never- heard-of-tlie-man\" from the nurse. No Hillen. Back to the camp — and was he thick. But hr was even thicker when he discovered that Hillen had moved back into the big room and I hat he had walked right hy him on his errand of mercy. N. B. . . .

They were soon re- leased, however. But that's not all. Chief of Polite Mensinger told a senior member of The Weekly staff that he bad eight of the yearlings in the station at the fair-grounds on Friday night. Several other boys made the close acquaintance of the police force during the eve- ning. But that still isn't all. Sev- eral enthusiastic frosh were put in a really bad spot when they rang in a false alarm from Cedar Crest college and succeeded in bringing most of the Allentown file fighters out on the Crest campus. And still that isn't all. On Saturday night the Fusion police apprehend- ed some of the dink-bearers who apparently had vicious designs against the Lafayette goal posts. As a result of all this pre and post-game activity it was an- nounced that all pep-parades in Allentown are at an end. This is a .safety measure for the peace of the community, the safety of the students and a big help to the breakage foe. WILL BE BROADCASTED BY COLLEGE STUDENTS Another forward step in the progress of The Muhlenberg Week- ly was tnnrkt d when the staff was assured of a definite time-period on the local radio station every week for the purpose of sending news flashes concerning activity on the Campus over the air. The program will be given every week on Wednesday afternoons 'from 4:15 to 4:.'i0 o'clock, as a \"Muhlenberg i>n the Air\" foatUH The time designated allows the most recent campus news imme- diate air-publicity, us the Weekly publishes every Wednesday morn- ing. The object is to stimulate closer relationship between the student body and the townspeople. Credit for having gained the time belongs to Dr. Carl Boyer, professor of education, who has been doing a great deal of work in the field of radio for the past fesv years. It was he who origin- ated the \"Muhlenberg on the Air\" programs, by wliieh means educa- tin n al features are given to the radio audience through the medium of several Muhlenberg professors, A trial news-Hash program was given recently, over the Allentown station, on a Saturday morning. A tiftoon-niinute period was devot- ed at that time to the broadcasting of items which later appeared in The Muhlenberg Weekly. The com- mentator at the trial program was Frank Roosevelt Boyer, a member of the junior class. Future pro- grams will have various students in that capacity. Thanks to the Allentown radio station. WCBA-WSAN, are also i-i order for the privilege of bringing these news items, in the most mod- ern manner, to the alumni and friends of Muhlenberg. The pro- grams should certainly be of the greatest interest to these groups. So listen for \"Muhlenberg on the Air\", every Wednesday after- noon with your classmates broad- cast ing news about your college. It NIMH MKKT1NG The Junior class will hold its first meeting this morning after assembly in the Science auditor- ium. Due to the resignation of Editor- iu-Chief Joseph Osman. a new staff will have to be elected to pub- lish this year's Ciarla. Osman ten- dered his resignation because he is not returning to school this year. Officers will also be nominated for the first semester. The meeting will be in charge of John C. Young.

Pl*Bl and negotiations are already under way in the program. A number of teams are being organized. Each team consists of three men, one preaching, one reading the service, and one who reads scriptures. All members of the student bully preparing for the ministry arc eligible. They make visits to nearby churches of all de- nominations and conduct services on Sundays throughout the school year. Everyone interested should get in touch with Charles Naugle, 209 W. Berks Hall. DR H. K. MARKS OFFERS NEW COURSE IN MUSIC Due to the desire on the part of several students to delve more deeply Into the construction of mu- sic, Dr. Murks has organized a Music Harmony class. The work of the class consists of studies on the keyboard, domnn- -troting various conbinations of tones, those that are acceptable and good and those that are not. It meets once a week throughout the year. The requirements for admis- sion are a knowledge of music and the piano keyboard. It is only to upper classmen. NOT SINCE 1918 Not since the year 1918 has a Cardinal and Gray foot- ball team been able to beat Lafayette. And now, of all years, the Mule suddenly jumps into life and kicks the spots off the [jeopard in a most decisive manner. The above briefly tells the story of a spectacle which put Muhlenberg grirlinin followers into ;i mild state of infinity last Saturday afternoon. A packed field started cheering ear- ly in the first quarter and kept up the enthusiasm until the final whistle. But there is another story to be told. It includes hot afternoons under a merciless sun at a camp in the Pocon ) mountains. It includes a fairly large squad cut by injuries f J * a rp ff p PontairiPrS and fatigue to a very small one. It includes untiring coaching Ugdl CllC _ IjUlliaillCI O in fundamentals last spring under a new coach. But most of all the story includes the golden word — courage. The courage of a coach who wasn't daunted by ap- parently hopeless odds and who brought with him a staff made up of the same stuff. The courage of a plucky team which had confidence in their coach and their ability. The courage of a student body which still stuck to a team which in the past held conference cellars. Of course the season isn't over. It has just begun. But regardless of what happens in the future — and we're sure it will be very satisfactory — there are twenty-three men who will still be making their huge and famous opponents wonder where it all comes from. A team and coach who have accomplished the nigh-im- possible deserve the best support. Let us continue giving it to them. Purchased By College PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1 \"Burglars Escape With $300,00\". \"Escaped Convict Kills Two In Getaway.\" \"Heir To Millions Kidnapped.\" \"Fa- tally Injured By Hit-and-Run Driver.\" So runs the gamut of the headlines in our daily news- papers. Such composes the reading material of the millions of people who scan the columns for \"news\". And thus it goes on In this endless course, increasing, sorry to say, rather t lit in ctcc fc.ii B i n K Why must these things be? Why can't America with its organized police force put her foot upon crime and its prob- lems ? It is because of the fact that there are a number of enemies of our nation's police; and politics is \"public enemy- No. I\" as declared last week by J. Edgar Hoover, director of the federal bureau of investigation. \"Too many times the local officer finds handcuffs on himself, instead of the crimi- nal, because of political influence.\" It is this demon, politics, which prevents many individ- uals from obtaining their just deserts. Only too often are speedsters pinched and not presented with a ticket because of their influence upon the administrative officials. Re- peatedly the officer is powerless to arrest an individual (an act which should in every case be carried out) just because he's a \"big shot\" in political circles. Politics, however, is only one of the \"public enemies\" to tfood, sound police protection. Low wages and poor training are also important factors to be considered. Naturally, there are very few people in this world who would do something for nothing. This, in a large extent, is prevalent in the police system. If we want a good police force we must give a reas- onable wage, for low wages are of a surety no incentive for good production, and they certainly do not attract the atten- tion of capable men seeking a career on the police force. Containers to be used for the dispensing of cigarette ashes and remains were received by the col- lege last week and have already been placed at convenient places throughout the college buildings. Dr. Horn, in his talk at the official opening of the college, in- formed the student body that smoking within the rampus build- ings will hereafter be allowed as long as the waste material is de- posited in proper places. The new waste receptacles purchased by the college are being used to that purpose. It is hoped that the men will, in the future, make use of the new containers. This is the first time in many years that students have the priv- ilege of smoking in the building. Heretofore smoking in the Ad building was not permitted. Any students desiring to smoke were , forced to use the basement. Sophs and upper-classmen take note: Perhaps these freshmen are just the slightest bit green; perhaps their ears are just the slightest bit curiously over-developed; perhaps they're even still looking for the gymnasium on the third floor of the library, or something or other, but turn 'em loose on a dance Hoor sometime and watch 'em go to town. It certainly didn't take Jack Bader or Christ Marias long to get ac- quainted at one of our local ballrooms last week; exactly two minutes, IS seconds, and 3 degrees after they had entered they were both danc- ing, and two hours later they were still dancing. * • * * * HOOK I.ARNIN\" The southern father was introducing his family of boys to the visiting governor. \"Seventeen boys,\" exclaimed the governor. \"And all good Re- publicans, I suppose.\" \"All but one,\" said the father proudly. \"They're all Republi- cans hut Jim the little rascal.

But since I've been so submissive and meek, I've meditated, debated, and contemplated, How will I ever pass Greek ? ? V ? ?

Fraternity Row THETA KAPPA NU Pennsylvania Epsilon chapter of Theta Kappa Nu annoances the pledging of Carlton Wermuth and William Everson, both of the class of 11139. Invitations were sent to all of the alumni to attend the Muhlen- berg-Lafayette game last Satur- day, and a large group of approx- imately fifty returned to renew ac- quaintances and visit the scene of old memories. Immediately after the conclusion of the grid battle there was an important meeting of the board of d hectors of the fra- ternity, and following this a din- ner was held in honor of the many alumni brothers present. The eventful day was topped off in fine style in the evening by an inform- al party and danee which was spoasored at the fraternity house by the active chapter. Plans to date indicate that ap- proximately ten of the brothers will leave on Friday afternoon for State College, Penna., where they will witness the Peon State-Muh- lenberg game on Saturday after- noon, and then return to AUentown early Sunday morning. Dates drawn by Pennsylvania Epsilon chapter for the rush dunce and smoker during rushing season were October ti and 13. Elaborate plans have been completed for these two affairs which the chap- ter will sponsor. The house has purchased a new and ultra-modern combination radio and victrola which will be used for entertainment when other facilities are not available. — G. J.

Wednesday, September 30, 1936 THE MUHLENBERG WEEKLY Nittany Lions Out After 'Berg Scalp 1934 Defeat Still Scorching Hides of Penn State Followers \"Beat Muhlenberg\"! is the war cry heard over the campus of Penn State this week. With the best team in eight years, the Nittany Lions, who in their^heavy schedule will take on Pittsburgh, Colgate and Villanova. are more than an- xious to change the story of their Waterloo suffered Oetober 14, 1!)34 at the hands of the UUmen. It was en that memorable day in the last quarter that the educated toe of Albert \"Reds\" Weiner sent the Higgin boys down the wide road of defeat. Playing a scoreless (tame throughout and lodged on the 42 yard line, \"Reds\" called for the field jrnsil piny. W.L'kins rlropp d back from his guard position, oitight and held the ball, while Weiner kicked 'Berg to victory. It was a breath-taking moment, a sample of Frank Merriwell stories. In that game the Muhls registered eight first downs to the Lions nine. It was behind a fiercely charging line led by Chris Rtely, Tinimy Watkins, Joe Rodgers, and Don Young coupled with the inspired defensive play by LcpVie and Wav- rek in the backfield. that gave the twice defeated Mulemen their rich- ly deserved 3 tn victory. The Cardinal and Gray teams have olayed Slate college but three times; once in tWU when George McCaa was coach, losing by a score of 22 to 0; the second time in 1U20 when William \"Bull\" Ritter was couch, then defeated 27 to 7; and in 1'J'AA when 'Berg clinched the game. Although there will be no \"Reds\" Weiner or Chris Riley, there will be John Young, Kenny Poust and Ralph Ragle, three linesmen who uill do things to the plays of the Nittany Lions, coupled with the inspired and improved Edward \"Scrapper\" Farrell, the varsity hack of last year, with Hill Hun- sicker and deer-like running of Henry Gutekunst. \"Barring injuries, the 'Bergmen will be at their best\" quotes Julian iff his lads. \"Penn State is strong, but I believe that our men are just as strong. \"We hope to repeat the \\ t934 performance.\" The squ;it!. coarbes ami mana- gers will leave for State college Friday morning at 8:00 A. M., stopping enroute at Lewistown where they will lunch. It is ex- pected that they will arrive on the campus of Nittany at 2:30 where the coaches will call a practice session. The New Beaver field will be given over to the 'Bergmen for two hours of practice.

A unique plan decided oti by the tribunal was to institute regular, weekly court sessions here, during which freshmen offender! of var- ious regulations will be arraigned before the tribunal, which has the power in such matters, to act as a governing board, In all proba- bility these court sessions will be held every Wednesday afternoon in the old, administration building assembly room. The offenders will be notified of their indictments and date of trial late every Tuesday afternoon by means of the bulletin board. These court sessions will he open events, and the student body at large is invited to attend. This year's tri- bunal has taken considerable pains to positively acquaint every fresh- man with the rules and regulations which he is subject to, consequent- ly any possible slip-up can only be a one-sided affair. A recent addi- tion to the freshmen regulations is the requirement of every fresh- ly h •., ri iiKiVc bis dink whenever he is within any building on the campus. Ed Sehifreen, \"17, chairman of the freshmen tribunal, has already explained mutter* to the freshmen class on several occasions, anil ha* even spoken to the sophomore class concerning their rights and privi- leges. In addition to its regular duties as a governing board over the class of '40, the tribunal will assist the Muhlenberg Christian Association in lite various pep smokers and parades, and will be in charge of the frosh activities during all of the home football games. As a result of the fine cheering done by the freshmen on Saturday the frosh have been allowed \"dates\" this week. This year's freshmen tribunal is comprised of Ed Sehifreen, ':)7, chairman; Bob Srhenek, \"M; Bernie Krell, \"18; Melvin Elting, 98; E. Hoover, *:ta; John McKee, '.'fit ; and Harry MclJonough, '39.

Pm. KOCH BROTHERS CENTRE SQUARE ALLENTOWN The young man at college will appreciate our efforts to serve him with the smart- est, college-bred styles. With the atmosphere permeated with pep and apple cores the M C. A. conducted the lirsl Pep S loo- ker of the season. Frederick J. C. tiiegorious, president, presided. Speakers of the evening were: Attorney Carl Cassone, of Allen- town, Rev. Conrad Wilker, \"Haps\" lie lifer and Conch Alvin Julian. Of most interest to the student liody was the appearance of the head coach for the first time. He ytated his policies clearly and in n very determined manner that in- voked a storm of applause and cheering from the entire group. He said \"I predict nothing def- inite tomorrow, hut promise that n jrrnup will be on the field Who can play 110 minutes of football. We are not out to tie or hold back any team whether it be Penn Stat.', Army or Fordham; but are out to win!\" he thundered. He asked the students to cheer most when the team needed them, not only when they were winning, but when they were on their own one-yard line. With a closing that struck home he pleaded, \"Don't be too tough on us if we don't win in the begin- ning.\" Attorney Cassone recalled past | days of the Muhlenberg teams. He reviewed previous games between 'Berg and Lafayette. He also re- called the days of Nivk Borelli and other greats playing on our grid- iron. Rev. Wilker presented several amusing jokes portraying the thought in a very interesting man- ner. The courage needed by both team and student body was stress- ed. \"Haps\" was in his usual great fusm. In a manner all his own the college registrar lamented the fact that a student body of -15' 1 could produce a football squad of HATS CLEANED SHOES CLEANED OR DYED only 83, He spoke of the great courage of our squad and of the determined attitude of those re- maining on the team. The college band and cheer lead- ers were on hand to lead singing and cheering which fairly rocked the auditorium. Apples and pretzels were pro- vided to gnaw on. Pipes and cigar- ettes created the smoky ozone. The freshmen were present in a body attired in their pajamas. Im- mediately afterward, led by the band, they paraded the streets of Allentown, as is the usual custom preceding the Lafayette game. As is stated elsewhere in this is- sue, there will be no more pep pa- rades in the future due to the en- thusiasm of the freshmen, which runs to a high pitch. tiring 12 x 10 inches, on 18 x 22 sheets. The entire work, there- fore, contains a minimum total of twenty-two hundred and twenty plates on Indian subjects. The binding is three-quarter Le- vant, gold top, and the portfolios are bound to match the book it- self. The books me edited by Mr. Ed- ward S. Curtis whose autograph appears in the first volume. Mr. Curtis represents the very best type of both observer and artist who spent twenty years in travel and research in order to produce this valuable and authentic set of books on the American Indian. ItiiMiL^ tlie last, years of his work Mr. J. P. Morgan became so inter- ested in Mr. Curtis's researches that he made possible the comple- tion of the field work and the pub- lication of the volumes. The books and plates have been placed in a special case in the Lob- by of the Library. Throughout the winter the plates will be taken out and shown on the special dis- play board in the Library.
