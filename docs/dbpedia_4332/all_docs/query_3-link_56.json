A Little Bird Tells Us When the brilliant spring sun sends the last of winter’s cold scampering northward, and robins set the campus vibrating with their songs, many students abandon their books to find recreation in the refreshing air. Hee & Sea gs 28D inl While spring causes some students to energetically romp in the out of doors, it infects others with that old malady, spring fever. They prefer to relax in a convertible, on the porch of the house, or under a shady tree. Still others visit the library, write letters home or plan shopping trips.

Great Artists ‘No composer—or audience—could ask for more,” said Norman Nadel, critic for the Columbus Citizen-Journal, in reviewing the New York Little Orchestra’s presentation of “The Infancy of Christ.” And another season of Mershon Great Artist concerts was being well received. The year was yet to bring such highlights as “Don Giovanni” sung in English by the Goldovsky Grand Opera Theater, and a concert by soprano Elizabeth Schwarzkopf of La Scala and the Milan Opera House. Members of the New York Little Orchestra Society, under the direction of founder, Thomas Scherman, rehearse for a production of Berlioz’s Sacred Trilogy, ““The Infancy of Christ.” Sse Antonio Janigro, conductor and cello soloist, plays a moving passage. .

Celebrity Series Lowell Thomas, Jr. opened the 1960 Celebrity Series program at Mershon Auditorium with a commentary on his adventure film, ‘Follow the North Star.’ Anna Russell added a night of comedy and satire. Dr. Wernher Von Braun appraised the United States’ missile program. And the musical skills of Pierre Cochereau, organist for Notre Dame Cathedral, and John Browning, concert pianist, were acclaimed. Rocket expert Wernher von Braun makes notes for his Mershon speech. Concert pianist John Browning rehearses before the night’s show. Kennedy bids for Ohio votes. Speaking from the statehouse steps, President-to-be LBJ has his say on campus. Nixon finds Hayes on his side. 70 Politics on Campus The presidential election year brought politics to Ohio State in full force. As the national campaign progressed, all major candidates appeared in Columbus. Buttons grew larger, the shouting louder. ‘“‘He shook my hand!” was heard after Johnson spoke from the Museum steps. A campus election indicated a Republican victory, but on election night students went to a Union Elections Party and watched a special 17-foot television screen show them otherwise. TV election returns bring many students to Union Ballroom. Expressions vary with news; but next day the dark circles are unanimous. 71 In “The Happy Time,” Papa performs his old vaude- ville act for Bebe, much to Mama’s consternation.

Homecoming 1960 Ohio State students made a dream come true for Marlene Owens, daughter of Olympic track champion Jesse Owens. Marlene was elected 1960 Homecoming Queen. In retrospect the campaign seems brief. But there are many who will long remember the hours of work, the frustrating details, and sleepless nights. For many Homecoming was a rally, a game—and a dance with a special date. But for the candidates and those who worked with them, Homecoming Week was an unforgettable experience. The Queen’s trophy becomes a shiny prize. Excitement runs high as Homecoming eliminations at Mershon narrow the field to 10 candidates. vol PILL A queen’s caravan starts a tour of the Oval. A candidate sees a friend—or a vote. Here is the campaign story: Its endless hard work and excitement, its anticipation and memories, its outcome in happiness for Marlene Owens—Homecoming Queen for 1960. = Va , : yt hay A sorority chorus line sings a limerick about their queen. The plea for votes sounds across campus. Magically, a living room becomes the ‘““Moulin Rouge.” Most of the time and hard work was devoted to the skits. There were scripts to be written, costumes to be made, and parts to be practiced. Then came a frantic two nights of dashing from house to house and from dorm to dorm. At last the skits were over, the candidates tried to relax everyone waited for the results. ... the last performance was over. After the elections, the five finalists dined at the Jai Lai. “Kemember, Darling, Thousands shared the pride of track immortal Jesse Owens, when he presented the homecoming queen tro phy to his daughter, Marlene. His closing words, “And remember, darling, it could happen only in America,” were echoed in news media throughout the world.

In a campus-wide election Ohio State coeds chose their man—Lou Vitucci. On the King’s court were Jim Kisling, Mike Harris, Dave Eckard and Ralph Thayer.

The Campus Scene Pe be The Democrats have their say at the Union’s “convention hall.” Though many weren't old enough to vote they made up for it with noise. Mock Political Convention Mixes Fun With Learning “Who cares if we aren’t old enough to vote? We can still campaign.” This was the thought that spurred Ohio State students to start the campaign season rolling with a Mock Political Convention. The Ohio Union Ballroom became a ‘‘convention hall” and the day was filled with speeches, demonstrations, and casting of ballots. At the day’s end Ohio State’s Young Democrats had nominated Adlai E. Stevenson, the Republicans had chosen Richard M. Nixon. ai Nixon fans take the floor—no subtlety here. A pretty face or two sidetracks the band. Greek Week Festivities for Greek Week began with a parade down 15th Ave. Led by the ever-present Phi Delt German Band the paraders marched to the Ohio Union where the oom pah pah music quickly changed to the smooth melodies of a dance band, sorority members snuggled up close to their favorite fraternity man and Greek Week was officially underway. The Phi Delt’s German Band leads the parade to the Union. The Greeks start their big week with a casual dance at the Union. Greeks chorus sings out at Mershon. Miss Conner shows a smile as big as her voice. Chris Conner at Mershon Other activities during the traditional Greek Week included a luncheon and an afternoon of workshops at the Ohio Union.

Campus activity is equally pictorial (right) at queen skit time when sororities and girl’s dorms can whip up a chorus line quicker than you can say ‘“May Queen Finalists.”” No matter what the tune, the words are always the same, “Vote For Me.” Honorary tappings initiated the May Week festivities. Visitors to the Carnival saw everything from hula hoops to hula skirts. r\\ Magoo Meandered Through May Week The fictional and nearsighted Mr. Magoo honored this year’s traditional May Week activities. The week began with the activities of the student honoraries—tapping cere- monies by chimes in Orton Hall, and Mirrors at the lake. The annual May Week supper was held in the Field House followed by a night of outlandish, but unforgettable fun at the carnival. A dart “champion” collects his reward at the May Week carnival. Corps Day Corps Day dawned bright and hot, as many of the ROTC men discovered. Even the trees were used as viewing stands as the Navy, Air Force, and Army units marched in review on the Oval. A few water balloons, the usual hecklers, and the sun took their toll. But Corps Day marchers will remember the row after row of green and blue uniforms—a traditional sight which. may soon disappear with the advent of the new voluntary reserve program.

Then—graduation! June ceremonies were held in the Ohio Sta- dium, the others in St. John Arena. The long wait in line until each student received his diplomas was characteristic of Ohio State; for the waiting, yes, but also for the personal attention to each student. Ohio State is one of the few if not the only school of its size that still hands out diplomas individually. It’s a personal touch worth the wait.

A Family Affair Graduation time is a family affair at Ohio State. No sooner has the ceremony ended than out pop the cameras, cigars and doting parents. Relatives and well-wishers by the score flock to praise each new possessor of an Ohio State sheepskin. Sociologists note too that graduates often come in pairs—brothers, sisters, man and wife. The latter, more often than not, have parked a couple of time-off-from-the- books problems with the University’s baby sitting service—a specialty of the occasion.

Faculty members have proven professional experience as well as sound educational backgrounds. The curriculum is designed, however, to make certain that the student gets a broad education in other fields besides journalism. Only about one-fifth of the classroom work leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree is in journalism; the rest is in the humanities and the social and natural sciences. Qualified students have an opportunity to work in their profession even before they graduate. Special internship arrangements with newspapers and radio and television stations make this possible.

By adding new quantitative courses such as Business Economics they are broadening their graduate program. Secondly, through the Bureau of Business Research, the college provides central facili- ties for faculty and graduate study and serves business through special studies. Thirdly, non- credit courses, workshops, and conferences in management development, labor education, labor research, and social work are held to develop attitudes and knowledge demanded in mature administrative and professional performance.

Graduates come not only from the main college, but also from specialized areas such as psychology and guidance, dental hygiene, and home economics. Early last fall, the Guidance Institute, presently under the direction of Dr. Herman Peters, was established as part of the college. Working in cooperation with the federal government, the college trains and certifies people in the field of education as school guidance counselors. In addition to the Welcome Week meeting for the Autumn Quarter freshmen, two other projects held in conjunction with the College Council were the student-faculty discus- sions and the campus tours for Future Teachers of America groups. itl a Fn: a seen ager nnn sine aes hile Sewer 5 ert senegncoes Ra ail Agpeepete DARI Beye toe -seag} So Rah A student music teacher starts the day with a song game.

First week of Winter Quarter: Since everyone is having a slight attack of panic, aspir- ing editors finally begin doing layouts. The last week of the last deadline: Every- one who hasn’t quit from exaustion stays up every night tying up loose ends.

Once a month the staff is lured into | 311 Ohio Union with the promise of peanut but- | ter sangies and Milwaukee’s finest. Of course there | is no food, and the beer turns out to be rubber : cement for pasteups, but editor Bill Teague ap- plies pressure.
