Hart became a cherished symbol of the romantic old West. For Hart himself, the untamed West was the real West, and he never tired of saying that his childhood on the plains and prairies of America’s closing frontier had taught him the truth about the nation’s westward experience. “I spent my boyhood out there when some of the earliest pioneers were yet living,” he said in 1921, at the crest of his career, “and I had direct from them much of the history of their early struggles. I have read, too, everything I can find on Western subjects, for it has been my ambition to try to reconstruct all that early history on the screen.” Hart vowed to make motion pictures that were authentic mirrors of frontier life and to capture all the “fascinating and colorful charm” of those unruly times. It was the picturesque, action-packed, alluring side of the frontier West that Hart chose to remember and that he portrayed. He never lost his nostalgia for the “redman, the buffalo, and those stalwart types of men who packed guns in the open.” Preserving the flavor of incidents he had glimpsed as a child became Hart’s mission. The actor exaggerated his knowledge of the West, and his exposure to life on the frontier was more as a circumspect tourist than as a longtime resident. Hart’s family was constantly on the move, and he developed an intimate acquaintance with few of the places they lived. Even so his memory was selective. Hart’s knowledge of Plains Indians was far more superficial than he liked to pretend. “I learned to hunt and track with the wisdom of my red friends,” he said. “We used to sail primitive Indian iceboats on the upper Missouri River” and “my early . . . relationship with the Sioux Indians enabled me to learn their tribal traits and history nearly as well as I know our own.”\n\nxi\n\nPreface As his career progressed, the actor buttressed his childhood experiences in the West not only with reading but also by cultivating relationships with flashy representatives of the late frontier era, most notably Charles M. Russell, Wyatt Earp, and Bat Masterson. He also had brushes with Al Jennings, Charles Siringo, and Buffalo Bill Cody and counted Will Rogers among his best friends. This distinctive clique added vigor and validation to Hart’s pose as a westerner, and he surrounded himself with an aggregation of Indian rugs and handicrafts, antique guns, cowboy accoutrements, buffalo robes, and a remarkable collection of western art. Bill Hart began acting at an early age and struggled for years to earn a modest living. He suffered the indignities that most members of his profession did in an era when itinerant actors were considered pariahs in respectable circles. Young Hart had the responsibility of supplementing his family’s income, and constant travel allowed him little opportunity to establish lasting relationships. The youth developed an insular temperament and appeared most comfortable with work and fantasy. He trained on the stage in Shakespearean tragedies and nineteenth-century melodramas, and he internalized theatrical excesses and a tragic stance until they framed his concept of life. Even though Hart had a paternity suit filed against him at the height of his fame, he was a moralist to the point of prudery. His good bad men on the screen were more opportunistic than evil, and the reformation his characters underwent by the final reel made his Westerns as much morality plays as action thrillers. Hart began making movies in 1914, shortly after the American frontier had reached its final phase. Western outlaws still operated in the first decade of the twentieth century, and the last big cattle roundups took place around 1907. Geromino, the great Apache chief, was still a prisoner at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1909. When Hart arrived in California, scores of cowboys who had worked the open range were drifting into Hollywood, hoping to find jobs in the infant movie business, where they could play cowboy when making a living in the dying Cattle Kingdom was no longer possible. To today’s audiences, except for the few rabid silent picture buffs who respect an earlier generation’s tastes in entertainment, William S.\n\nxii\n\nPreface Hart’s movies appear overdone and sometimes laughable. The old cowboy star’s acting, with its emphasis on semaphoric gestures and undulating glances, is difficult for modern filmgoers to take seriously. To them, much of Hart’s “realism” seems artificial and quaint. But Hart holds an honored place in cinema history, and his work is esteemed by western history scholars for its visual accuracy. Despite all the caricature and stale action, Hart’s films contain a look and an ambience of the frontier West, and their central character is both renegade and visionary. If Hart’s concept of the West was skewed, it is a view that popular culture has held in high regard. Cowboy stars who came after Hart (Tom Mix, Buck Jones, Ken Maynard, Charles Starrett, Sunset Carson, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, and the rest of the Saturday matinee idols) emphasized nonstop action and showmanship in their movies, with little or no transformation of character. Hart’s good bad men came to grips with moral issues, made decisions, and suffered the consequences. Not until the classic Westerns of John Ford, beginning with Stagecoach in 1939, and the adult Westerns that came on the heels of The Gunfighter (1950), High Noon (1952), and Shane (1953), did the genre reach maturity. For a generation that had never ridden in an airplane, received its news in a belated fashion, and moved at a generally slower pace than we in the twenty-first century, Hart’s silent Westerns offered excitement, lessons in righteous behavior, and stirring entertainment. Enveloped in darkness and riveted to the screen, with no distracting sound to lessen the visual impact, audiences—particularly those in the vast rural areas—thrilled at a reconstruction of a recent past that had crossed into lore. In darkened movie houses filled with music befitting the drama, unsophisticated audiences found in William S. Hart a hero they could revere. They could return to their mundane lives assured that good triumphed over evil and that even the bad were capable of redemption. Hart stands on the divide between fact and fiction. His films, like his life, were a combination of myth and reality. Many of the people Hart knew—Earp, Masterson, Russell, Jennings, Siringo—helped to shape the public’s romantic image of the late frontier West, and they, too, were men whose careers blended myth and reality. If Hart\n\nxiii\n\nPreface approached filmmaking as a realist, it was as a sentimental realist. His yarns were the type western cronies fancied and spun among themselves. Like Charlie Russell, Hart fell in love with the West at an early age and made it his career. He not only became a symbol of the frontier legacy, he convinced himself that he was a true westerner with a unique knowledge of the frontier’s role in American history. Like Frederick Jackson Turner, Hart regarded the westward experience as the central force that shaped the national character. But Hart’s West was laced with righteousness, high drama, and an abiding nostalgia that reflected secret longings of his puerile personality. I decided to write on William S. Hart for two major reasons. Despite Hart’s prominent reputation in film history, no previous fulllength life story of the actor exists aside from his autobiography, My Life East and West, which is a saccharine read and not an altogether reliable source. In the Seaver Center for Western History Research at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, however, there are some one hundred thirty boxes of William S. Hart papers, and that cache of material seemed to offer the makings for a solid biography. Unfortunately, most of the data contained in the Seaver collection deals with Hart’s later life and career. My Life East and West remains the primary source on his early years, apart from scattered newspaper items. Of necessity, the first three chapters of William S. Hart: Projecting the American West rely heavily on the actor’s published memoir. Try as I did to locate supplemental data, the discouragements were many. Early in my research, however, I had a stroke of luck. One evening while eating dinner in Los Angeles with producer Walter Seltzer and his wife, Mickey, I mentioned that I was thinking about writing a biography of William S. Hart. Mickey Seltzer voiced immediate surprise. Her reaction was soon explained when she told me that her mother, Jane Novak, a silent picture actress and one of Hart’s leading ladies, had once been engaged to Hart. I interviewed Mickey a few days later, and she loaned me a stack of photocopied love letters Hart had written her mother in 1921. Emotionally involved by the time I finished taking notes from Mickey Seltzer’s collection of letters, I had little choice but to proceed\n\nxiv\n\nPreface with this biography, although I was aware early in the research that the result would be an uneven book. The actor was a conscientious letter writer, so documenting the latter part of his career was partial compensation for the meager sources on his early years. His boyhood years and early adulthood remained difficult to trace, and in many instances voids were impossible to fill because of the peripatetic nature of his family. Thanks to the Aurora Public Library I was able to re-create Hart’s months in the Fox River Valley of Illinois through letters that came into the press at the time My Life East and West was published. After going through the one hundred thirty boxes of William S. Hart’s papers (some twenty of which consist of canceled checks), I still had trouble getting a handle on the actor’s personality. Somehow we did not connect to the degree I had with subjects of other biographies I had written in which oral history played an important role in my research. Between Christmas and New Year’s Eve in 1998, I drove to Durango, Colorado, to visit my friend Harry Carey, Jr., one of the few people still alive who knew Hart personally. Within twenty minutes he gave me what I thought was the key to Hart’s personal makeup. “Bill Hart was always ‘on,’” Carey said. “He was a ham actor who had learned his craft in melodrama. He talked in the declamatory way he’d learned during his years on the stage.” Suddenly all the letters I had read that were written by Hart made sense, and the pieces began to form a character. Like any author, I owe thanks to a host of people who helped make this book possible. My gratitude goes first to Mickey Seltzer, Harry Carey, Jr., Joe McNinch, and Diana Serra Cary, who supplemented archival research with personal recollections of Hart. John Cahoon in the Seaver Center of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County was a paragon of patience and guidance during my weeks there. Zandra Stanley at the William S. Hart Museum in Newhall, California, gave me a private tour of the Hart home that placed the silent cowboy star’s reclusive personality during his old age in a setting so powerful that I felt I had actually touched the man. Mary Ann Pirone at the Aurora Public Library supplied me with the data I needed to amplify Hart’s boyhood in the Fox River Valley.\n\nxv\n\nPreface Barbara Hall, head of special collections at the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, is a model of professionalism, as well as an engaging lunch partner. The entire staff of the Herrick Library makes doing research there a pleasure. Ned Comstock in the film and television archives of the University of Southern California remains a researcher’s dream. Ned is not only efficient and knowledgeable, but he remembers who is working on what project and stays in contact. My thanks extend to the staffs of the Library of Congress, the American Film Institute in Los Angeles, the theater section of the New York Public Library, the Columbia University Oral History Archives, the Nebraska Historical Society, the Huntington Library, Haden Library at Arizona State University, and Rita Forrester in the local history department of the public library in Newburgh, New York. Also helpful in Newburgh was local historian Patricia Favata, who called me with additional information after I returned to Dallas. Without my personal support system, it is unlikely that this book would ever have reached completion. Among that team are Judy Bland, who doubles as my secretary, Jane Elder, Tony and Ghada Colom, Brenda Cooper, Dana and John Pickett, Gail Alpert, Mary Jo and Bob Harding, Suzy Ruff, Robert Richmond, Sally Caldwell, Steve Simonson, and Bill Wylie. Marilynn Hill and Charles Cooper spent part of the summer of 1999 with me in Los Angeles, where we worked hard on our respective biographies, laughed our way through breakfasts and dinners, and bonded into a surrogate family that continues. Finally, I must give special recognition to Santiago Nambo, who has been my steadfast friend in work, travel, and play, and allowed me undisturbed time to do the writing I enjoy. It is appropriate that this book is dedicated to him.\n\nxvi\n\nWilliam S. Hart\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter One\n\nBoyhood Although William S. Hart became the prototype of the tough, guntoting westerner in silent pictures, he was born in Newburgh, New York. His birthdate is a matter of conjecture, since the town’s health department did not keep records until 1869. Accounts agree that Hart was born on December 6, but the year reported varies from 1862 to 1876. Most likely the date was 1864, for that is the year listed for Hart’s birth on records of the postal service, where the future cowboy star worked as a youth, and it jibes with census data indicating that his family lived in the Fox River Valley of Illinois in 1870 before he was old enough to attend school. Newburgh, on the west bank of the Hudson River a few miles north of West Point, was not an incorporated town until 1865. By then the community’s diversified manufacturing interests had entered a period of prosperity stimulated by the Civil War, and the surrounding farms were doing a lively trade in milk, butter, and fruit. Still, most of Newburgh’s streets remained ungraded, and the town’s population was concentrated in a compact area. Civic boosters liked to point out that General George Washington had made Newburgh his headquarters during the latter part of the American Revolution, and landscape architect Andrew Jackson Downing was a lifelong resident of the community. William S. Hart (the middle initial stood for Surrey, not Shakespeare, as some writers have maintained) was the third child and the first son of Nicholas and Roseanna McCauley Hart. Roseanna’s parents had emigrated to America from Northern Ireland when she was three\n\n3\n\nWilliam S. Hart years old. The girl grew into a hardworking, nurturing woman, whom her famous son described as a person “of gentle upbringing and refinement.” Nicholas was born in Liverpool and raised in the English Midlands. Quick-tempered and a good talker, Nicholas arrived in the United States as a young man, proud to be descended from a line of barristers. It is unlikely that Nicholas was a graduate of Oxford, as has been claimed, and to call him an engineer, as Bill Hart later did, would be an exaggeration. Throughout most of his son’s boyhood, Nicholas worked as a miller, more given to dreams and wanderlust than to achieving financial success, and he was never able to provide his family with more than a scant living. Roseanna grew up in Newburgh and met her husband there. At the time of their first son’s birth, they were living in a brick house close to the freight yard. The future cowboy actor was born at 45 Front Street, near the river and the docks. Much of the town’s business activity—the factories, the wholesale houses, the telegraph office, the coal and lumber yards—stood along Front and Water Streets, since that location gave them ready access to both the steamboat landings and the railroads. Although Newburgh’s economy was flourishing at the time of Bill Hart’s birth, his family benefited little from the prosperity. Dreaming of the perfect site for a flour mill that would earn him a fortune, Nicholas Hart decided to gather his brood and head west when his son was only a few months old. The Illinois Federal Census of 1870 states that Nicholas Hart, age thirty-seven, was living in Oswego Township, and the Edwards Aurora Census two years later confirms the presence of the Hart family. Bill’s two sisters, Mary Ellen and Frances, were both old enough to attend school. Bill Hart’s first recollection was of Oswego, where the family lived near the Parker grist mill on the Fox River. There were only two houses in the immediate vicinity, and the nearest farmhouse was a mile away. George Parker and his family lived in the house nearest the Harts, and Nicholas worked for Parker as head miller. Bill’s earliest memory was of springtime, when the ice was breaking up on the river and making its way downstream in slabs. Bill remembered how he and his father were in a rowboat, taking supplies to some sawmill\n\n4\n\nBoyhood workers marooned on the opposite bank of the raging, ice-filled stream. The family’s dog, a shepherd named Ring, spotted Nicholas and Bill from the shore, plunged into the water, and began swimming after them. Nicholas stopped rowing and managed to get the struggling dog inside the boat but not without hazard to his son and himself as they tossed about in the surging water. Bill recalled the episode in his autobiography in thrilling detail, almost as though he were acting the scene in a movie. After the star’s book was published in 1929, John Parker, son of the grist mill owner, remembered young Bill Hart, whom he called Willie, as “a round chunk of a boy” who used to show up at the Parkers’ door with his sister Frances whenever John’s mother baked cookies. Frances was “a very quick-spoken girl, much like her father,” John Parker recalled, “while Willie was more deliberate, taking after his mother, and he was somewhat bashful.” Nonetheless, Frances would push her little brother ahead to act as spokesperson in their quest for cookies, even though his halting words were not easily understood. “He says he likes cookies,” Frances would interpret, causing Mrs. Parker to smile since she knew from experience what the children’s mission was. Nicholas Hart, as John Parker remembered him, was “a man of dominant character,” of medium height and athletic build. He wore a well-trimmed sandy beard and glasses, usually colored, since he was having trouble with his eyes. A particle of steel from a mill pick had entered Nicholas’s eye while he was working in Oswego, and the inflammation spread to the other eye. His sight grew so bad that the family feared he might be going blind. “Hart was one of those self-confident men,” Parker said, “an expert in his line, very particular in his work and would brook no carelessness or negligence in others. He possessed a sharp tongue and never hesitated to speak his thoughts. He was bold and fearless, much like the characters his son portrayed in later years, and courageous in emergencies.” John Scheets, who worked under Hart at the mill, remembered Nicholas as “an able miller and an expert millstone dresser. He became sort of a rover or itinerant mill worker, dressing stone and repairing mill machinery.”\n\n5\n\nWilliam S. Hart Parker confirmed a story that the star related in his autobiography regarding Nicholas’s pursuit of some horse thieves who stole the mill team in the middle of the night. “Hart, clad in his night gown and armed with a butcher knife, chased the thieves until they abandoned the team up on the main road,” Parker remembered. Although Bill was too young to attend school in Oswego, he was developing into a self-reliant boy who seemed capable of taking care of himself. He often entertained himself in the vicinity of the mill and was well liked by the farmers who came from the surrounding countryside to get their wheat ground into flour. Mrs. Nellie Herren, who owned the farm on which the grist mill still stood in 1945, recalled that it was “a common sight to see eight or ten loads of grain waiting their turn.” The Fox River Valley was an idyllic place for a young boy with a taste for the outdoors. The river’s current was swift near the mill, and workmen from the neighboring sawmill used long poles with hooks at the ends for pulling logs into the desired place. On weekends in the spring, summer, and fall, fishermen gathered along the banks, and in the winter ice was harvested from the river and stored in sawdust in a nearby icehouse for sale during the summer months. Bill, like most of the children in the area, liked to suck and chew on sugarcane stalks that he grabbed off wagons taking cane to a nearby sorghum mill to be boiled into molasses. Sometimes his mouth and chin were red with the juice. When a misunderstanding arose between Nicholas and George Parker, Nicholas hastily resigned from the mill in Oswego and moved his family to Montgomery, a few miles away. Nicholas had ambitions of going farther west and starting a mill of his own in Iowa. He asked George Parker to allow his family to remain in the house in Oswego while he made a prospecting trip to the adjoining state, but the mill owner needed the dwelling for his successor. The argument that followed nearly destroyed a friendship, although in time the relationship was patched up. Hart changed his mind about going to Iowa and accepted a position with the Hard flour mill in Montgomery. The family’s house in Montgomery stood by itself, close to the mill, but there was a gen-\n\n6\n\nBoyhood eral store in between that sold candy. Nicholas’s vision had become so impaired that he could not find his way to the mill alone and had to rely on Bill or one of his daughters to guide him. When Bill’s turn came, he always stopped when they reached the store, which was a hint for his father to buy him a stick of candy. Before long the family moved again, this time to Aurora, Illinois, also on the Fox River, where Nicholas took a job at the city mill. Aurora was larger than its neighboring villages and later virtually absorbed them. The Harts lived a half mile from the flour mill in Aurora, close to the C.B.&Q. railroad tracks, the train depot, and the riverbank. Within a few weeks Nicholas’s eyesight proved so bad that the mill owners would not permit him to work for them any longer. Although Bill liked to say as an adult that his father was an expert at his trade and made a good salary, in truth the family lived in nearpoverty throughout most of the boy’s growing-up years. In his memoirs the aging William S. Hart viewed his childhood as a grand adventure, particularly his years in the West. He remembered playing outlaw and pretending that the fence around his family’s house was a robber’s cave. He conjured happy visions of romping with various dogs and the excitement he felt braving the unsettled West. He recalled privation, but in mawkish terms. In Aurora the family was so destitute that the children found only two pennies and a handful of raisins in their Christmas stockings from Santa Claus. “We were satisfied,” Hart wrote in his memoirs. “But how well I can remember . . . the drawn, pinched expressions of my father and mother!” Nicholas’s failure to become a prosperous, independent miller marked Bill for the rest of his life, yet in later years he defended his father and glossed over his inadequacies as a breadwinner. To the aging star, his father was a restless, reckless man, ready to battle for his rights and the rights of others. “I only know my fond memories are those of my youth,” Bill wrote John Scheets in 1929. William S. Hart developed an early capacity for romanticizing his life, and even as a child he seems to have retreated into himself emotionally, preferring loneliness over intimate family ties. Although he talked about his family in idealized terms, he found ways of distancing himself from prolonged contact. Later, Lotta, his baby sister born\n\n7\n\nWilliam S. Hart during the time the family lived in the Fox River Valley, would be the embodiment of saintly innocence for Bill, but that was when he was spending most of his time on the road and particularly after Lotta’s death. In his youth he viewed her far differently. “I would stick pins in my new baby sister to hear her cry,” he admitted as an adult. The Harts’ migratory life and precarious financial condition made their life sufficiently difficult that the boy’s retreat into fantasy is understandable. Faced with the possibility of blindness, Nicholas was obliged to travel alone to New York City for a series of operations. Eventually Dr. C. R. Agnew of the Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital cut deeply enough into the miller’s pupil, without impairing his vision, to find an infinitesimal particle of steel that was causing the trouble. Roseanna waited with the Hart children in Aurora for her husband’s return, strapped for money. “My mother used to tell us to mind her,” Bill recalled, “because our father was not there to take care of us, and then she would read letters and cry a little.” Roseanna seemed to cry a great deal during her marriage, for life on the western prairies never offered her the fulfillment or security that Nicholas had promised. By the time the family left Aurora, Roseanna had four youngsters to care for, Bill and the three girls, one of whom was a babe in arms. With his eye problem solved, Nicholas returned to Aurora and, since he could not work in the mills for a while because of the dust, took a job as night watchman at a silverplate factory. But in pursuit of his dream of pushing farther west, he soon decided to move to Portland, Iowa. Roseanna and the children were left behind while Nicholas explored the possibilities in Iowa. Once he was established, he wrote his wife to gather their brood and join him in Portland. “I remember being set off on the prairie—no station, just a pole with an iron arm for a mail bag,” Bill remembered. Nicholas was at the stop to greet them when they arrived. “We all laughed and we all cried,” Bill said. The family’s new home was a one-room wooden house with a false front; the building had once been a trading post. The flour mill and river were just across the road. The only other structure anywhere near was a half mile away, and that was a one-room shack used as a\n\n8\n\nBoyhood schoolhouse. Young Bill spent a great deal of time in Portland swimming in the river and following a teamster who hauled flour to Mason City, fifteen miles away. But once Nicholas had the millstones in shape for grinding and the mill in working order, he was ready to move on. Bill referred to his father as a “white gold” pioneer and said that he was known throughout the West as a finder of water power and a builder of flour mills. By nature Nicholas suffered from an itchy foot, yet in his admiring son’s imagination he represented the courageous breed of men who settled the country’s last frontier. “All pioneers were real men, big men,” Bill wrote an acquaintance in Aurora in 1929, “and no band of pioneers were bigger or more real than those men that wore the dusty clothes of the miller.” The Harts moved next to nearby Rockford, Iowa, then a settlement of about one hundred people. They lived in another house close to another mill on yet another river. But the hotheaded Nicholas and the mill owner in Rockford soon squabbled, and for the testy Nicholas arguments usually led to a fight. Young Bill stood watching in tears as his father slugged it out with the mill owner. Thinking that his dad was in danger, the boy took him a large, double-edged ax he could barely lift. Nicholas won the fight without his son’s help, but he also lost his job. For the third time in six months, the family uprooted. They left Rockford on a bitter-cold winter night. The children were carried to the train station by men wearing long blue army overcoats. “There were three of them,” Bill said, “big stalwart men that had fought under Grant. Fighting men always liked my father.” The wind was blowing so strong when they left Rockford that the men, each with a child in his arms, had to walk backward. Meanwhile Nicholas protected Roseanna and their baby from the cutting blizzard. This time the family settled in Minneapolis, already one of the great flour-milling centers of the country. The Harts found housing in two rooms over a saloon, just off Hennepin Avenue. The street was full of horses, oxen, and sleds loaded with cordwood, and the sidewalks were made mostly of planks. Indians walked the streets, some with baskets of goods on their backs, and lumberjacks were\n\n9\n\nWilliam S. Hart everywhere. The Harts were Episcopalian, and Bill remembered his father taking him to a little stone church in Minneapolis for services. The family stayed in the city until springtime. Then Nicholas made a seventy-five-mile trip to Trimbell, Wisconsin, to inspect another mill site, talking Bill with him. They walked the last twelve miles of the journey, and Nicholas had to ask directions from a stranger they met on the way. Trimbell at the time consisted of only three houses and a store that doubled as a post office. The mill there, owned by a half-breed Indian, was about two miles down the river. The Harts took up residence in a three-room house by the mill, near where the owner and his family lived. The owner’s mother was a full-blood Sioux, and his sister was a girl about twelve years old. The girl took a liking to Bill and spoke to him in the Sioux language, which intrigued the boy, as did the sign language that the old woman used. In time Bill became so fascinated by the woman and the girl that he followed them as they went about their chores. Eventually he came to understand some of what they said, and the old woman talked to him as if he were an adult, telling him tales of Indian deeds and bits of Indian lore. “I can only think and live in the past,” the woman said. “The white people have taken away all of the Indian’s future.” Bill made friends among the Sioux boys, accompanied one in particular as the lad hunted partridges in a thicket, and developed a respect for Indian ways that remained with him for the rest of his life. In Trimbell, Roseanna gave birth to another son, aided in the delivery by her Sioux neighbor since no doctor was available. Bill liked having a baby brother and enjoyed tickling him with a feather to make him laugh, but the child lived only a short time. Bill remembered the baby’s crib covered over with a blanket and the old Indian woman sitting beside the corpse all night, smoking. The infant was buried in a homemade coffin on a hillside overlooking the Mississippi River, near Red Wing, Minnesota. When construction began on a flour mill on the Orinoco River in Minnesota, Nicholas was offered a six-month job installing its machinery and dressing the burrs. Not willing to be separated from his wife and children, Hart moved them to Orinoco, a five-day trip\n\n10\n\nBoyhood from Trimbell. They traveled to their temporary home in a prairie schooner pulled by three yokes of steers. “How I envied the driver,” Bill said, “a strapping, curly-headed youth of about eighteen, as he curled his long-lashed bullwhip over his team.” Young Bill trudged along behind the schooner on the journey. At night he slept under the wagon with his father and his young idol, while the three girls and his mother bedded down inside. Orinoco, Minnesota, consisted of approximately fifty people who lived in a dozen houses. Bill acquired a dog named Prince and spent much of his time in Orinoco fishing. On one of his outings he stumbled onto a small Sioux village about four miles downstream from the mill where his father worked. The boy was surprised to learn that the Sioux did not like fish and only ate them in the winter when their food supply ran low. Nicholas’s work in Orinoco was not finished by the time winter set in, and he decided to send his family back to Trimbell without him. The return trip was faster than the going, as the wagon Roseanna and the children rode in was drawn by four spirited horses. Bill sat on the seat with the driver, a bewhiskered plainsman, and the lad enjoyed himself immensely and felt like the man of the family. After their return to Trimbell, Roseanna and the Hart youngsters lived for a while in a one-room log cabin nestled in a tract of timber, about three miles from the half-breed’s mill. Their nearest neighbor was a mile away through a dense woods. A cougar, smelling meat in the house, tried to get inside one night and tore some shingles off the roof. Even more frightening was the night Bill’s dog went mad from rabies. “He was running amuck all over the room among sleeping children,” Bill recalled. Somehow Roseanna got the beast out of the house without anyone being hurt. The next day Bill and his Indian friend tracked the dog in the snow until they were exhausted but never found him. By the time Nicholas rejoined the family, snow was piled high. The Harts survived an unusually severe winter living in one of the three houses in Trimbell. As the ice on the river grew thick, Bill and his sisters had to scrape frost from the window panes to see outside. There was no work, so Nicholas read to the children from his\n\n11\n\nWilliam S. Hart collection of Charles Dickens’s novels—Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, and Old Curiosity Shop. With no income, things became so desperate for the family that Roseanna sent Bill to the store to trade her most prized possession, a silver caster, for flour, sugar, and tea. When spring came and the streams began running again, the mill resumed operation. One night in early May, Nicholas got Bill out of bed and hurriedly sent him after the old Indian woman the family had come to respect. Roseanna was about to have another baby. By the time the boy got home, he had a new baby brother, whom his parents named Nicholas, Jr. But Roseanna did not respond to the Indian woman’s treatment after the birth and grew seriously ill. The Harts soon moved to Prescott on the St. Croix River, where there was a doctor among the town’s two hundred residents. Nicholas went to work as an extra hand in a flour mill in Prescott. But Roseanna’s need for better medical facilities became so critical that she soon returned to Newburgh with the girls and the baby. Bill remained with his father and remembered putting his mother and siblings on a train in Hastings and watching from the station platform as the railroad cars sped out of sight. Nicholas and Bill returned to Orinoco and boarded for a time at the Len Hanson Hotel. Lonely for his mother, sisters, and brother, young Hart filled much of his time riding horses and fishing. Since Nicholas was working at the mill all day and sometimes far into the night, Bill could largely do what he pleased. He sold most of the fish he caught and for a short time did odd jobs on a farm fourteen miles out of town. “I was doing a man’s work in the fields, plowing all day,” Hart said in his memoirs. During thrashing season, the boy drove a team that dragged straw away and lived with the farmers in tents. “I thought it pointed the way to becoming a cow-puncher and no school,” he said. Bill grew up with practically no schooling, and for years he did not even know the letters of the alphabet. In most places the family lived, schools were not available, which gave the boy ample opportunity to avoid formal education. He had no use for school and reveled in the lack of supervision he had enjoyed since his mother’s departure. But Orinoco had a school, and Nicholas insisted that Bill\n\n12\n\nBoyhood must attend when classes began. To prepare his son, the father began teaching him the alphabet. Bill preferred what he later called the “wonderland of the western outdoors” and the lessons to be learned from nature. As an adult Hart claimed that the frontier West shaped his personality and thinking. “The bigness of the West makes men quiet; they seldom talk unless they have something to say,” he wrote in his memoirs. “The altitude clarifies their brains and gives them nerves of steel.” Once he got used to school, the experience was somewhat less painful than young Hart had expected. He met other boys nearly as untutored as he was, and his teacher in Orinoco, a rancher’s daughter, could barely read and write herself. On the way to school one day Bill met a bear on the road, and that gave him an excuse not to go anymore. “My schooling was a failure,” he admitted in 1917. From a Sioux friend who lived in a nearby Indian village, Bill learned to hunt and track, use a bow and arrow, and shoot accurately with a rifle. He claimed to have become skilled at riding ponies bareback as well as with a saddle. During the winter, he and his Sioux companion sailed iceboats on the river, and in the summer he usually wore moccasins. Bill and his friend went for long swims in the river’s cool water during summer afternoons and then sat on the bank and told stories. “In short,” Hart later reflected, “I was a Western boy.” A rattlesnake bit him one day, and he credited an Indian woman’s knowledge of cures with saving his life. Young Hart mastered Indian sign language and a little of the Sioux tongue, which he used to his advantage once he became a star. He came to admire the simplicity of the Indians’ way of life and their regard for nature. “I always found them steadfast, loyal, and stoically grateful,” Hart said in 1925. He remembered his Sioux neighbors as kind, straightforward, and honest. When Nicholas received word that Roseanna was recuperating nicely under a doctor’s care in Newburgh, he decided to resume his search for a mill site that could become his family’s permanent home. He journeyed down into central Kansas, taking Bill with him, and checked out water power around Abilene, Ellsworth, Hays City, and Newton. “I did not care much for these places,” Bill recalled. In Abilene, Nicholas and Bill stayed in a hotel over a saloon. Young Hart\n\n13\n\nWilliam S. Hart was awakened one morning by the sound of his father’s loud, angry voice downstairs. Bill went to the top of the stairway and saw a man, whom he later discovered was named Three-Fingered Texas Jack, facing his father with his hand on a pistol. Nicholas shouted at the assailant, “My boy is sleeping in that bed with me, and you fellows try and pull any drinking bouts up there again and I’ll beat hell out of the whole crowd.” Bill remembered the lawlessness of the Kansas cattle towns and the southern drawls of the Texans who rode through the streets with their herds. For a week Nicholas joined a group of cowboys driving cattle to Fort Robinson, with Bill tagging along. The beef was being sent by the government to feed some Indians there. Bill recalled that the trail had been traveled so heavily that the grass was grazed off. “I made quite a hit with this outfit,” Hart boasted in his memoirs. “My father’s horse was cutting up a bit and I traded with him.” Failing to find a suitable mill site in Kansas, Nicholas decided to try Dakota Territory. He and Bill’s journey to the Black Hills took them through Julesburg, Colorado, and Sidney, Nebraska. Bill recalled seeing crowds of people in these towns, many speaking different languages and toting rifles or shotguns. “There were fathers and mothers with lots of children,” he said. “Many of the people were cooking and living in the streets,” which were clogged with soldiers, Indians, teamsters with bullwhips, cowboys, loose cattle, horses, mules, dogs, and prairie schooners. Furniture of all kinds was piled everywhere. “There were also young women wearing fancy short dresses covered with beads,” Bill said, “with a pretty colored shawl over their shoulders and a flower in their hair.” After traveling east on the Union Pacific railroad and north by stagecoach, Nicholas and his son came into the Black Hills. Gold had recently been discovered in the region, and miners from all over the world had poured in, causing the Indians in the area to grow apprehensive and restless. In response to reports of depredations, the government had increased the number of soldiers in the territory, but hostilities continued. Nicholas hoped to form a partnership with relatives of the halfbreed he had known in Wisconsin and build a flour mill on one of the\n\n14\n\nBoyhood swift-running streams in the Black Hills. Once the mill was in operation, he intended to send for Roseanna and his other children. “My father did not tell me his plans until we reached Sioux City,” Bill recalled, but the boy grew excited at the prospect of having his mother, sisters, and brother with him again. In Sioux City, Bill and his father were on their way to buy some horses early one morning when they saw a sheriff and two gamblers stumble out of a saloon and begin shooting. Father and son stood frozen in the crossfire, while the sheriff shot the gamblers but suffered a severe wound himself. Badly shaken, Nicholas took Bill back to their lodging without buying any horses. “I knew the bad men of those days,” William S. Hart would later claim. “I remember them perfectly. In those days the law was the law of guns.” Traveling by stagecoach, Nicholas and Bill continued on to Yankton in Dakota Territory. A French Canadian there supplied Nicholas with three saddle horses and two packhorses and escorted them northwest into the Indian country. After riding for two days they came upon a small army post. “After that,” Bill remembered, “we saw no towns, no white people, no log houses, no settlements.” One morning the threesome came over a rise in the prairie and saw a herd of horses in the distance. Nicholas looked through a pair of field glasses, noted that the animals were either standing or grazing, and determined that they were a band of wild horses. As the encroachers drew nearer, they heard a yell, and suddenly Indians in war paint seemed to leap on the backs of every horse and start racing toward them. Bill claimed in his memoirs that he “gaily started to chatter Sioux” as the leader approached, much to the Indians’ astonishment. “I was not a bit timid or afraid,” he said. “I can remember vividly their smiles and their humorous looks, each to the other, at my kid talk.” Nicholas was apprehensive as the riders drew near but finally decided that the Indians constituted a hunting party that had left their reservation in search of food. When the Indians showed no signs of hostility, Nicholas told them that he wanted to see Red Cloud or one of their chiefs. The leader signaled for the whites to continue on their way, and the painted band rode off. “To me,” Bill\n\n15\n\nWilliam S. Hart later wrote, “these men were Indians, and I played with Indians; they were my friends. . . . Indians always liked me.” Hoping to gain permission from a Sioux chief to establish a flour mill in the Dakotas, Nicholas worked his way north, following the west bank of the Missouri River. Bill remembered seeing very little game and no buffalo on the trip. He and his father passed several small Indian villages and came upon a larger one on the White River that consisted of thirty or forty lodges and some one hundred fifty people. None of the Indians they met gave them any trouble, and since winter was approaching, Nicholas decided to make camp a short distance from the White River settlement. “An hour after we arrived,” Bill recalled, “I had forgotten all about mill-sites . . . and was playing with the Indian children as though I had lived there all my life.” Nicholas tried to explain to the Indians how a mill could operate on the water power that came from the streams that emptied into the Missouri and how grain could be planted, grown, and turned into flour that could be sent down the big river to market. But the Sioux were hunters, not farmers, and had trouble understanding. Planting meant plows, and plows reminded the Plains Indians of what the government agents tried to send them instead of rifles and blankets. While his father talked business in the council lodge, Bill played with the Indian children from early morning until twilight. “The boys had many games that I had never seen,” he said. With the onset of winter, Nicholas realized that he and his son must leave Dakota Territory or be snowed in. The Indians gave them a farewell party, at which Bill was allowed to sit by his father’s side with the men. “I never shall forget the beautiful talk made by Lone Bear,” Hart wrote in My Life East and West. “It told of the troubles of the white and the red people; how they were climbing the same mountain on opposite sides.” One day, the chief predicted, the two races would reach the top of the mountain together, and there, “close to the roof of heaven,” the Great Spirit would talk to them and their troubles would end. As Bill and his father left the Indian camp, dogs were barking and Bill’s playmates came out to see him off. “There were no words\n\n16\n\nBoyhood spoken on either side when we left,” Bill said, “but it was felt to be a sad parting, and we had been there only a little over six weeks.” Nicholas had decided to return to Minnesota, a journey of about three weeks. He and Bill reached Rochester, Minnesota, by train, then hitched a ride with one of the mill teams to Orinoco. They arrived to find the Indians they had known there gone. By Christmas news came that Roseanna’s health had been restored and that she, the two younger girls, and Bill’s baby brother would be joining them in the spring. Meanwhile Bill was forced to attend school. Since no house was available in Orinoco, Nicholas decided to build one. He did the work himself, with Bill serving as errand boy. Trees were cut, and a log cabin was constructed and rough furniture made. By April all was ready for the family, and Bill and his father eagerly awaited the stagecoach that would bring Roseanna and the children the final lap of their journey west. “We saw the six-horse team coming splashing through the mud,” Bill recalled. “My mother was hugging me. She had my little brother in her arms and she was crying.” The eldest Hart girl, Mary Ellen, had been left in Newburgh with her grandmother so that she could receive better schooling. But the reunion was a glorious occasion nonetheless. Ever the wanderer, Nicholas soon decided to make another move. He had received an invitation from his former half-breed partner in Wisconsin, asking him to go in with him on building a mill on the Zumbro River. Bill was dispatched with a letter saying that his father would accept the offer. The boy traveled by stagecoach for the first forty miles of the trip but had to walk the last twenty. “When the stage drove away and left me at the crossing of the trails,” Bill recalled, “I did not feel so good.” A month later the family was established at Zumbro Falls. “It was hard to leave the little Orinoco log cabin,” Bill admitted, and his mother suffered even more. Roseanna remained frightened by life in remote places and missed the amenities of Newburgh, where there were doctors and decent schools and civilized talk. In Zumbro Falls, the Harts took shelter in an old store with a false front, much like what they had lived in earlier in Portland. Nicholas, overseeing twenty\n\n17\n\nWilliam S. Hart Indians, began supervising the building of a mill and a dam half a mile up the river. There was no school within twenty miles, much to Bill’s delight. For a few weeks he plowed fields for a nearby farmer, earning fifty cents a day and using fourteen-hundred-pound steers to pull the plow that broke the virgin soil. Hundreds of prairie chickens strutted to one side as he cut furrows through their flock, and young though he was, Bill realized that a primeval domain was nearing extinction. Tension increased on the northern prairie, as greater numbers of armed soldiers were sent west by the War Department. “In our immediate country,” Hart remembered, “while outnumbered by whites, there were enough Sioux to cause anxiety in the event of trouble.” Word came in June 1876 that General George Armstrong Custer and his troops had been annihilated at Little Big Horn, several hundred miles west of Zumbro Falls. Nearly all of the Sioux men that Bill and his father had met on the White River, including Lone Bear, were dead. “The whole village had moved to the Big Horn country,” Hart said as an adult. “They were a hunting party, with their women and children with them, and were in camp when attacked by the soldiers.” Roseanna hated the West, and the threat of Indian troubles made her life there unbearable. Before long she suffered a relapse. A doctor traveled many miles to attend her, but he informed Nicholas that his wife needed surgery. Otherwise her life was in danger. There was no choice but to send Roseanna and the children, including Bill to look after the women, back to Newburgh. The mill in Zumbro Falls was not finished yet, and no money was coming in. Nicholas turned over his share of the enterprise to his half-breed friend, and after putting Roseanna and the children on a train headed for the East, he took off for the western Indian country again, hoping that he could earn a better living and gain more independence in the Dakotas. Bill did not take kindly to living in the settled East. He continued to daydream about faraway outposts and the freedom he had enjoyed on the vanishing frontier. He missed romping with the Indian boys and tending the animals he had come to love. Although he left the\n\n18\n\nBoyhood old West as an early teenager, Bill Hart would spend the rest of his life romanticizing the life he had experienced there. “My youth had been spent in the open,” Hart later wrote. “The breath of the prairies nourished me throughout my early boyhood years.” William S. Hart claimed to know and understand the Indians far better than he in fact did and in his later years would assume the stance of an expert. “If an Indian looks straight at you when he’s talking, it’s good,” he wrote in My Life East and West. “If he looks past you, it is not so good.” By 1927 he had added an innocent flirtation to his memories of the half-breed girl he had admired in Trimbell. He was only ten years old at the time, she was about fifteen. “I thought she was the most beautiful creature ever created,” Hart said when he was a Hollywood star. In later years he embellished the wisdom and impact of the old Sioux woman he had known in Trimbell, turning her into a sage, a medical marvel, a primitive scholar, and a Socratic teacher. He boasted that his Sioux friends had given him the name Chanta Suta, meaning “Strong Heart,” and said that his friendship with the Indians had done much to strengthen his character and deepen his understanding of fundamental truths. “In fact,” he wrote in the foreword to Pinto Ben and Other Stories, “my early days of intimate relationship with the Sioux Indians enabled me to learn their tribal traits and history nearly as well as I know our own.” Hart professed to have encountered some of the frontier West’s most famous characters—outlaws, cattle rustlers, horse thieves, gamblers, grizzled prospectors, rowdy cowboys, and veterans of the Seventh Cavalry. He liked to talk about hearing the death cry of starving wolves during brutal winter nights on the northern plains and how he became a crack shot with the rifle and the six-gun. As he grew older, these stories had been repeated so often that they took on deeper hues. Bill would eventually tell fan-magazine writers that he spoke Sioux better than English as a boy and that he had been on friendly terms with Sitting Bull. Bill Hart saw enough of various aspects of frontier life to make an indelible impression on him. What he retained was more the color of the old West than a factual reality. To make a cinematic comparison, the West became William S. Hart’s Rosebud, a delicious memory from\n\n19\n\nWilliam S. Hart childhood that lingered and shaped his destiny, much as the sled from Charles Foster Kane’s boyhood dominated the subconscious of the dying tycoon in Orson Welles’s movie. In Hart’s mind he never completely left the West of his youth. He longed to go back—if only in fantasy. “My only regret is that our stay was so short up there on the prairie,” Hart said in 1926. Life in Newburgh was certainly not easy for teenage Bill. What money Nicholas managed to send the family went primarily for Roseanna’s medicine and doctor bills. After their return to Newburgh, the Harts initially occupied a two-room apartment in a frame house on Washington Street, opposite St. George’s Cemetery. Mary Ellen went to work in a soap factory, and Bill sold newspapers and shoveled snow off sidewalks to earn supplemental funds. He did not go to school because there was no money for books. The family was so poor that they soon had to move to cheaper quarters on Western Avenue. Bill hated everything about Newburgh, which in the 1870s was a town of about seventeen thousand people. Eastern boys did not understand Hart’s ways, thought him mannerless and uncouth, and laughed at his talk about Indians. Whereas boys in the East grew up playing baseball and football, Bill knew only Indian games. Fortunately he had developed into a husky youngster, and Nicholas had taught him how to box. After a few fights, Bill won the respect of his young Newburgh neighbors, but he preferred to remain apart from them. Roseanna insisted that her son be baptized and attend services regularly in Newburgh’s Episcopal church. For a time Bill was a choirboy at St. George’s Church, and longtime residents of the town remembered him singing a solo at a Christmas service. His young acquaintances said that he sang like a girl, which led to more fights, but Bill generally managed to hold his own in these brawls because of his size. The family’s financial predicament became so severe that Nicholas was at last forced to abandon his dream of owning a mill and return to Newburgh to support them. The stories he told them of recent happenings in the Indian country were sad indeed. The War Department had ordered cavalrymen to follow Indian bands and force them onto reservations. “Old people, women, and children were being\n\n20\n\nBoyhood attacked in their tipis and shot down in the snow and brush as they tried to run away,” Bill remembered his father saying. Nicholas found a job in Newburgh breaking stones with a sledgehammer, but the family’s poverty persisted. Bill carried ice and worked as a teamster, but he recalled standing in front of Duncan’s bakery during the winter, hungrily admiring the delicacies in the window and relishing in the heat that wafted up through a grate from the ovens in the basement. After Nicholas rejoined the family, the Harts lived in Cart Alley, a short dead-end street with stables for the horses and wagons of nearby store owners on one side and small frame houses on the other. The Harts lived on the second floor of one of the houses, above a mute cobbler. Within a few weeks the restless Nicholas bid his wife and children good-bye and took off for Troy, northeast of the state capital, where there were flour mills. He soon heard of a mill in West Farms, a suburb of New York City, that needed a stone dresser, and he worked as a hired hand in Troy just long enough to earn the money he needed for railroad fare to West Farms. When the ice broke up in the spring, his family took a barge down the Hudson River to join him. Bill claimed that in West Farms the family was prosperous and happy for a time. He attended school there, and after school hours his father taught him to dress millstones. Bill swam in the Bronx River during the summer and skated on the river in the winter. On Sundays the family attended Grace Church. Then Nicholas caught his hand in a conveyor at the mill, an accident that would have torn him apart had he not managed to yank his crushed arm free. Even so, the back of his hand was torn off, making it impossible for him to work for many weeks. During his recuperation, the Harts’ youngest son, Nicholas, Jr., died, and the family went into mourning. Bill remembered his mother awakening him night after night and telling him to go find his father. “I always found him with his mangled arm at the same place,” Bill said, “my little brother’s grave. His great heart was breaking!” Roseanna’s health did not improve, requiring the consultation of several doctors before another operation was deemed necessary. Roseanna remained in Women’s Hospital in New York for several\n\n21\n\nWilliam S. Hart weeks. Funeral expenses, hospital bills, and Nicholas’s prolonged unemployment combined to make it essential for Bill to find full-time work. For a while he was an errand boy for a butcher, but he gave up the job to become a helper on an express wagon. His duties required him to handle the horses and cart trunks into the city. The wagon passed Women’s Hospital every day, and Roseanna would wave to her son as he drove by. “Once every week I was allowed to go in and see her,” Bill recalled. Later young Hart made fifty cents a day as a delivery boy on a Bronx River ice wagon, working from three o’clock in the morning until three in the afternoon. “I cleaned and fed my team while the wagon was being loaded,” Bill said, “and we started for Harlem and Yorkville at about four o’clock each morning.” Untrained and uneducated, the stripling had to take whatever work he could find. When Roseanna was allowed to come home, she was still pale and weak. During Nicholas’s recovery, the mill where he had worked was sold, and the new owners brought in their own crew, which meant that Nicholas was again out of a job. “So my father took the big leap,” Bill said. “We moved to the big city, little dreaming that our Western hopes were never to be realized.” For two years the family lived at the Everett House at Seventeenth Street and Fourth Avenue. A block away from their new quarters was the Clarendon Hotel, which was under the same management as the Everett House. Bill became a messenger boy for both hotels. His duties required him to make two trips daily to the general post office for mail and run miscellaneous errands for the hotels’ clerks and bartenders. For extra money he carried messages for guests. Business was good for him since only a few telephones had been installed at the time. As a reward for his services, Bill sometimes received theater passes. The first play he saw was a melodrama, and the villains and the beautiful heroine in distress made a lasting impression on his fertile imagination. Bill loved the shows, and when he had no pass, he frequently paid fifteen or twenty cents to sit in the top gallery. Occasionally he was given tickets to grand opera. He saw Fanny Davenport, Annie Louise Cary, Tommaso Salvini, Etelka Gerster, and many of the\n\n22\n\nBoyhood other theatrical and operatic greats of the day, some of whom stayed at the Everett House. He delivered a bouquet of flowers to the legendary French actress Sarah Bernhardt on her opening at the Booth Theater, and she rewarded him with a pinch on the cheek. Bill later claimed that he had only two ambitions in life. One was to attend West Point, probably because of the academy’s proximity to Newburgh, although Hart liked to say that the notion stemmed from the forts and soldiers he had seen in the West. But since young Hart had virtually no formal education, West Point was out of the question for him. His other ambition was to be an actor. “The stage idea just came,” Bill said. He thought he might have a chance of becoming an actor since a gift for talk ran in the family. “My father was a wonderful orator,” he recalled. “That’s the best talent in the world to inherit for the stage. A great orator is necessarily a great actor. In his speech, his gesticulation, his graceful postures in delivery, you have the elements of acting.” Most of the acting Hart saw in his youth was of the declamatory style, in which celebrated performers exhibited themselves onstage in mesmerizing postures and vocalized in a bombastic manner. The broad, melodramatic approach was the vogue in nineteenth-century theater, and Hart would master that technique during his stage career and eventually internalize it in his private life. The roving spirit seized Nicholas again, and he took off for Hall County, Georgia, where he found a position running a small flour mill. He then moved to Kansas City and worked there for a while. Meanwhile the family had to find cheaper rent and relocated on Diamond Street in New York. When Nicholas returned to the family, the Harts moved again, this time to 152d Street and Third Avenue. Somehow the girls managed to stay in school, but Bill had to keep working. Since the lad was walking constantly, he developed a lively pace cutting through dark streets at night. He became so adept as a sprinter that he began pitting himself against horse cars. In time young Hart heard that contests were held in Madison Square Garden, and he decided to enter one. The yelling crowd and the glare of the lights\n\n23\n\nWilliam S. Hart distracted him, and he lost his first race. He began to train with some seasoned athletes and soon won a two-mile walk. For several months Bill worked for the Collender Billiard Table Manufacturing Company, pumping water by hand from the cellar to a tank on the roof. The job was so strenuous that he exhausted himself. Fortunately a Broadway tailor with a liking for professional athletes noticed the youth and gave him a better-paying job as an errand boy. Bill’s reputation as a sprinter grew as he won several medals and cups. The Manhattan Athletic Club accepted him into its ranks, and he became a member of the Cherry Diamond Track Team and went to meets in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Montreal. For a seventeenyear-old boy, the attention was heady and welcome. Another baby, a boy, was born into the Hart family but lived only a few hours. Nicholas eased his grief by taking off to the West again. For a brief time he ran a mill in Yankton, Dakota, but the financial situation of his family was so bad that he had to come home. Nicholas then found work as a janitor at an apartment house on West Fiftysixth Street. His salary was sixty dollars a month, and the family was allowed to live in the basement without charge. The better neighborhood would be the Harts’ home for three years. The girls continued their schooling, yet they were slighted by their classmates because they lived in a basement. Bill worked for a period at a nearby riding academy, exercising horses in Central Park. He liked the job and loved the animals, but his determination to become an actor had taken root. He knew that to accomplish his aim the rough edges of his bumptious personality would have to be refined. He lacked culture and needed the education he had never had. Although Roseanna saw nothing but disappointment and futility in Bill’s desire to go on the stage, Nicholas was supportive and advised him to take fencing and dancing lessons. Always eager himself for an excuse to travel, Nicholas told Bill that he should go to Europe, where he could observe centuries of art and meet learned people. “America is the flower of the human kingdom, the smile of the Sea,” Nicholas told his boy. “But America is new.”\n\n24\n\nBoyhood Dreaming of a career in the theater, eighteen-year-old Bill Hart decided to heed his father’s counsel and make a trip abroad. He had no money, so he worked his way to England on a cattle boat. “I guess I am the only actor who ever set forth on a mission of art acting as chambermaid to a shipload of long-horned Texas steers,” Hart said years later. Tall and in excellent physical condition, young Hart planned to do odd jobs and supplement his income by winning footraces. He intended to see as much theater as possible in Europe, take in the museums of London and Paris, and absorb the learning and culture that had not interested him earlier. If he couldn’t become a soldier and return to the West he loved, he would be an actor and travel wherever work was available. Europe, he felt, was the best place to acquire the background and polish that a successful actor needed.\n\n25\n\nChapter Two\n\nStruggling Actor On his first trip to Europe, Bill Hart walked from Liverpool to London. With his funds exhausted, he roamed the English capital in search of work and finally found a job as a delivery boy in a gun shop. During hours off, he visited art galleries, the Tower of London, and all the quaint, old places he could enter without paying a fee. He went to the theater and saw Henry Irving and Ellen Terry perform five times. “If I could have gotten in for a penny, I would have been there every night,” Hart said. Like his father, Bill was not inclined to stay in one place for long. He decided to save money for passage to Paris and later marveled at his nerve. “Here I was, an awkward, green, gawky, long-legged boy, all hands and feet, and not speaking a word of the French language,” he told a Hollywood reporter. “Strange to say, I had no difficulty at all.” In the France of the Third Republic he found work delivering goods to the English customers of a Parisian shopkeeper and supplemented his income by washing windows. He was up at daybreak every morning and in exchange for janitorial services, received fencing lessons at a private gymnasium. Determined to absorb as much culture as possible, Bill went to the theater in Paris almost every night. He saw many of the great French stars of the day and saturated himself with contemporary acting. The actress who stood out in his memory was Agnes Sorel. “She was one of the most beautiful women who ever lived,” Hart remembered. “You can imagine the effect she would have upon a lonely, clumsy, homesick [eighteen-year-old] boy. Looking down upon her from the\n\n26\n\nStruggling Actor galleries, she was installed in the place where I kept my ideals as an angel of light.” Hart returned to England and sailed for New York on the Helvetia. Lack of education still prevented him from securing the caliber of positions he would have liked, and theatrical agencies showed no interest in a gangly lad whose talk was bigger than any promise he showed. For several months he worked as a cashier at Caswell and Hazzard’s Drug Store and attended dancing school with his sisters. “I believe it did me much good,” Hart later said, although he looked more suited to a boxing ring than behind footlights. At nineteen Bill passed a civil service examination and became a clerk in the New York general post office. He worked there for more than three years. He stayed in good physical condition and won races at the Manhattan Athletic Club track. With Bill earning better wages, one of the Hart girls working as a dressmaker, and another employed as a telegraph operator, the family’s financial situation improved. Nicholas never adjusted to living in a big city and still entertained notions of returning to the West. When his girls complained that a man who sat on a neighboring stoop ogled them as they walked by, the irate father dashed out and walloped the offender. Nicholas took a job as a maintenance man in a Manhattan office building, and the Harts moved to an apartment on Sixty-second Street, near Ninth Avenue. Bill had begun to feel a surge of late adolescent cockiness and started hanging out at such dubious places as Tom Gould’s and the Haymarket. The twenty-year-old postal clerk was making a hundred dollars a month by then and had most of his evenings free. “It was a very narrow trail that I traveled,” Bill said later. “It was tortuous and ran along the edge of a cliff that shunted off into a mighty deep chasm.” Although young Hart did not drink liquor or smoke, he watched a friend at the post office become so enamored with a “lady of the evening” that the acquaintance started missing work and was eventually dismissed. Bill once spent a considerable sum of money himself taking some chorus girls to a horse show at Madison Square Garden. Nicholas noticed that his son was in danger of becoming a philanderer and sat him down for a talk. “Will,”\n\n27\n\nWilliam S. Hart Nicholas said, “there is so little time in life; none of it should be frittered away.” Nicholas advised his son to save his money, return to England, and make his bid for a stage career there. “With my father to decide on a thing was to do it,” Bill said, and within four months he was on his way back to England, this time as a cabin passenger. After returning to London, Bill found an instructor and paid five pounds for a course in acting. He saw Mary Anderson and ForbesRobertson in A Winter’s Tale at the Lyceum Theatre and determined to concentrate on the skills that would help him enter the acting profession. But after a few weeks the youth grew so lonely and homesick that he threw his clothes into a bag, caught a train to Liverpool, and boarded a steamship for home. In New York, Hart began studying with F. F. Mackey, a retired actor and respected teacher. “I am grateful that I fell into his hands,” Bill later wrote. The strapping lad exercised regularly at Wood’s Gymnasium and swam on the ocean side of Staten Island. “There was nothing there but the station,” he said, “no habitation whatever.” With no one to interfere, Bill did deep breathing exercises and spoke Shakespearean lines to the surf. “One day a dead man washed in on the tide while I was swimming,” he recalled. “The man had been shot through the head. I never knew what became of the case.” After answering endless advertisements, the aspiring actor landed a job in 1888 with Daniel E. Bandmann’s theatrical company, earning twelve dollars a week. “Everything I know about acting I learned from the boss of that old barnstorming troupe,” Hart later told a reporter. “He was the finest stage technician I have ever known. He had an absolute knowledge of the craft.” Bandmann, who had played engagements with Henry Irving in London, spent vacations on his ranch in Montana, and while the troupe waited for their star to join them, Bandmann’s leading lady, Louise Beaudet, supervised rehearsals. With Grover Cleveland in the White House and the West struggling to recover from drought and the winter of 1887, William S. Hart made his debut before an audience as Friar Lawrence in Romeo and Juliet, by coincidence at the opera house in Newburgh. On tour through the East, the company played the Shakespearean love story at matinees and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde at night. In New York City,\n\n28\n\nStruggling Actor the troupe opened at the People’s Theater in the Bowery with Tom Taylor’s Dead or Alive, which Bandmann renamed Austerlitz. Then the company took to the road again, journeying as far west as St. Louis. Bill Hart at age twenty-five spoke in a voice that was soft and low. From time to time Bandmann called the young actor into his dressing room and, in a thick German accent, complimented him on his studiousness and the ability he demonstrated during performances. But the old actor neglected to raise Hart’s salary, so the novice was forced to become adept at stalling hotel keepers for payment of bills and rustling cheap meals. Bandmann’s cast consisted mostly of beginners, and the company traveled with only a few antiquated side wings and a drop for scenery. In April 1889 the troupe played McVicker’s Theater in Chicago, where a critic for the Chicago Times wrote, “Mr. W. S. Hart acted with dignity and intelligence the part of a young physician.” After the Illinois engagement Bandmann returned to his ranch in Montana, leaving the rest of the troupe broke and stranded. Bill found himself in freezing weather, obliged to seek shelter under one of the Illinois Central’s depot sheds. He took a job peeling potatoes for two weeks to earn enough money to get himself back to New York. Tough though the life of an itinerant actor was, he thrived on the adventure it offered. Later in 1889 Bill was engaged by a company headed by actor Lawrence Barrett for a new play, Ganelon, that Barrett was producing. The expensive production was set in the Middle Ages, and Ganelon, played by Barrett, was a traitor who is run through by a Saracen chieftain’s spear at the end of the fifth act. Such spectacles attracted large audiences in the late nineteenth century, and although few of them were worthy drama, they allowed Bill Hart to learn his craft. As the Barrett troupe was preparing to leave New York, Hart saw the distinguished tragedian Edwin Booth (brother of presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth) at the ferry, preparing to go on the road as the star of another of Barrett’s companies. Although Ganelon was a success in the cities where it played, Barrett became sick and in Baltimore received word that he needed to have an operation to\n\n29\n\nWilliam S. Hart remove a large growth from his neck. The tour ended after an engagement in Washington, D.C., although Barrett decided to play repertory the final two weeks there. Such plays as Richelieu, The Merchant of Venice, Francesca da Rimini, Hamlet, and Julius Caesar were advertised for presentation. “Here was a special cast for a new play, instructed to costume, study, rehearse, and give a performance of at least twelve plays on two weeks’ notice,” Hart recalled. “The performances were given, and they were highly creditable, too!” In Hamlet Bill was assigned numerous supporting roles, but he was relieved when the engagement ended. Bill came back to New York and found quarters in an attic on Fourth Avenue, sharing sleeping accommodations with three other young actors. His father meanwhile had grown restless and was trying one last time to operate his own flour mill in the West. The husband of Bill’s middle sister had gone to the far Northwest and sent his father-in-law a favorable report on the opportunities there. “So once more our family, filled with high hopes, moved westward,” Bill said, although the struggling actor stayed behind to search for work. His family remained in the Pacific Northwest only a few months. When they returned to the East, Nicholas took a job in Brooklyn that included free rent, and Bill moved in with his parents and his two unmarried sisters for a short time. Since Hart found memorizing dialogue difficult, Mary Ellen, his oldest sister, whom he called Mamie, frequently held the script and prompted him as he learned his lines. Sometimes they worked together on plays ten hours a day. Bill could obtain free tickets to most of the shows in New York, and he usually took Mamie with him when he went to the theater. Mary Ellen had completed her college education, was a bright young woman, and gradually became an excellent judge of drama. She often advised Bill in his choice of material, and he grew to be quite dependent on her. For a time the budding actor played one-night stands with a stock company headed by Margaret Mather. The work was exhausting, and none of it lasted long. In 1890 Hart found a season’s employment with Robert Downing’s troupe, which included Dustin Farnum, another struggling actor whom Bill came to know well. Downing’s\n\n30\n\nStruggling Actor repertoire consisted of seven or eight plays, but Hart’s best role was Appius Claudius, a lascivious young aristocrat, in Virginius. The company opened in that play at the Grand Opera House in Philadelphia in December with mixed results. Bill got so carried away with his libidinous role that his wig became twisted over one ear and his patrician wreath was trampled in a skirmish with Virginius, who was trying to protect his daughter’s virtue. As the curtain fell, Bill heard the stage manager yell at him, “What in hell is the matter with you?” Try though he did to achieve a modicum of sophistication, Hart was still the bumpkin he had been when he went to Europe. Slowly Bill began to understand an actor’s need for discipline. He became a serious reader of stage history, and with experience his timing and projection improved. In April 1891 the Boston Trancript reported in its review of Virginius, “Mr. W. S. Hart was quite effective as Appius Claudius.” Although subtlety was never Hart’s strength as a performer, vigor and power were. He grew to love his chosen profession, even though he seldom had more than a few dollars to show for his early efforts. As a member of traveling stock companies, he had to pay his own hotel bills and incidental expenses, supply his own costumes, wigs, and footwear, and cover his own railroad fare to wherever rehearsals began. Between jobs he studied and exercised to maintain an athletic appearance. In the fall of 1891, with his beloved frontier all but gone, Hart was engaged by the Prescott-MacLean company as a leading man, earning forty dollars a week. His roles included Romeo, Antony, Iago, and Phasarius in Montgomery Bird’s Spartacus, a play American audiences admired at the time because it idealized the fight for freedom. The troupe rehearsed in Lexington, Kentucky, then played small towns in Alabama and Georgia. In early October the company performed at the opera house in Springfield, Missouri, where the local press said, “Mr. Hart’s rendition of Romeo was all but ideal.” A month later the players reached San Antonio. When the company performed Spartacus there, the press reported: “Mr. Hart is a really fine actor, who reads his lines well and who suits his actions to his words.” Spartacus, in a less than magnificent production, was performed at the Union Square Theater in New York City in December\n\n31\n\nWilliam S. Hart 1891, whereupon the New York Recorder said that Hart “created a more favorable impression” than R. D. MacLean, the company’s star. The critic went on to write that Hart, in Phasarius’s reconciliation with his brother and subsequent death, “showed a strength of dramatic feeling and truth of impulse that carried the audience by storm.” The rest of the cast was judged to be average. Bill’s notices in New York were good enough that he secured a leading man position the following season with a more noted company headed by Hortense Rhea (who billed herself as Madame Rhea in an attempt to gain greater respectability). Hart played Armand Duval, Pygmalion, Napoleon, and other challenging roles with Rhea, whom he regarded as “a delightful woman, never a great actress.” Yet Madame Rhea had spent a decade as leading lady at the Court Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, and had developed social skills that served her well. The actress gave parties almost every night after performances, during which Bill met interesting people and heard sophisticated conversation that he found both a treat and an education. In Washington, D.C., he was introduced to General Wade Hampton, the Southern cavalry officer, and enjoyed Hampton’s company throughout the engagement there. “I used to walk home with him at night,” Hart wrote in his memoirs. “He was an old man with a cork leg.” With difficulty Bill was acquiring a bit of finesse, and women particularly responded favorably to his gentle manner. Quibblers maintained that he spoke too fast in performances and tended to run his lines together. But most reviewers agreed that Bill had talent, cut a dapper figure with his rakish profile and solid physique, and was an intensely serious young man who had the drive necessary to advance his career. Hart stayed with Madame Rhea through the spring of 1895, playing with her in The Queen of Sheba, La Gioconda, Much Ado About Nothing, The Lady of Lyons, and other contemporary favorites. The company played cities around the Great Lakes, went west to the northern plains, and crossed over into Canada for stops in Montreal, Halifax, and St. John. In April 1895, near Manistee, Michigan, the train on which Rhea’s company was traveling derailed, and the locomotive turned over, trapping its engineer and fireman in the wreckage. Bill\n\n32\n\nStruggling Actor heard their call for help, dashed into the scalding steam that enveloped the two men, and bent steel to free them. The engineer’s arm was broken, but he recovered. The fireman died with Bill’s overcoat wrapped around him, as a special car backtracked to carry the injured men to Manistee. During Bill’s engagement with Rhea, his father’s health began to fail, and Bill persuaded him to go to England for a visit to his boyhood home. They agreed that Bill would go to Paris during his summer break from acting, visit the art galleries there, see as much French theater as possible, and meet Nicholas in Liverpool. The tone of his father’s letters from England became so alarming, however, that Bill cut his stay in Paris short. In Liverpool he took Nicholas to a doctor, who examined the ailing man, discovered an enlargement of the spleen, and advised him to go home to his family. Nicholas Hart died in New York on June 20, 1895. Bill, thirty years old at the time of his father’s death, felt keenly the responsibility of taking care of his mother and unmarried sisters, but his means remained limited. Fortunately he had been hired the previous spring as leading man on what would prove Helena Modjeska’s farewell tour. By then the Polish-born actress was a legend, and acting opposite the great Modjeska represented an enormous leap forward in Hart’s career. He was slated to play Macbeth, Angelo in Measure for Measure, the Duke of Malmsbury in a new play by Clyde Fitch, and other roles that would have shown his talent to good advantage. Modjeska opened her last season at the Garrick Theater in New York, played there for three weeks, then moved to the Montauk Theater in Brooklyn for a week’s engagement before going on tour. In Cincinnati the actress suffered a partial paralysis, which affected her side and arm, and the tour had to stop, leaving Hart desolate. His father had been dead only a few weeks, and Madame Modjeska’s stricken condition added to his grief and left him with no income. Toward the end of his life, Nicholas had apologized to his son for being such a financial failure and for leaving his family almost penniless. Bill loved his father, acquired many of his basic values and his love for the West from him, and sympathized with the disappointments he\n\n33\n\nWilliam S. Hart had faced in his life. As a token of his remorse, the sentimental Bill hired an undertaker’s wagon, rode with it to West Farms, disinterred his little brother’s body, and took Nicholas, Jr.’s remains to Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, where he placed them beside his father’s grave. With the family’s financial situation desperate, Bill joined Robert Mantell’s acting company for a week in Newark, New Jersey, where he played Iago, but business was so bad that he ended up with no salary. He fared better performing Shakespearean roles opposite an unnamed actress who had recently separated from her wealthy husband. “The lady was not a soiled dove by any means,” Bill said. “She was just a party fiend that never seemed to sleep.” Wild living and drink caused the woman to die young, but Hart earned a hundred dollars a week while working with her. Despondent and apprehensive that he might become the failure in life that his father had been, Bill appeared lost, uncertain about what direction to take. He shot pool, bowled, and roamed the streets of New York with his friend William Farnum until the wee hours of the morning. Bill later said that he and Farnum reveled in crazy pranks that should have landed them to jail. “It was anything, anywhere, except go home,” he said. Between engagements Bill coached a young girl who wanted to become an actress, but he went for weeks with no income at all. He played the hero in The Great Northwest, a melodrama that rehearsed for four weeks but played only three at the American Theater in New York. The production’s budget was so tight that he again received no money. He next went into William A. Brady’s production of Under the Polar Star, which was staged by the great producer-director-playwright David Belasco, the lion of Broadway at the turn of the century. The play had an able cast and eight huskies, which Admiral Robert Peary had brought back from the Arctic, to pull a sled onstage. “Hart’s acting as the hero is one of the bright spots in the cast,” the Brooklyn Times reported on January 5, 1897, “but his fitness almost clouds the efforts of Grace Henderson as the heroine and Cuyler Hastings as the villain.”\n\n34\n\nStruggling Actor Family responsibilities demanded that Bill earn more money, and he decided that the time had come for him to go on the road as a star. Hired by John Whitely, who had managed both the PrescottMacLean company and Madame Rhea’s troupe, Bill scraped together $250, and Whitely booked a tour for the 1897–98 season. Bill concluded that The Man in the Iron Mask, with its dual roles, was an ideal vehicle for him, even though he thought the story was a bit gloomy for popular audiences. He revised the third act of the drama and made a big enough hit of the play that he opened with it in most towns. The tour began in Traverse City, Michigan, then went through the middle western states and down into the Southwest. Hart’s repertoire included Camille and The Lady of Lyons, and while audiences seemed to like what they saw, he made no more than a bare living. Oklahoma was still Indian Territory when the troupe played the Turner Opera House in Muskogee. Streets in the town were dirt, with board sidewalks on either side of the main thoroughfare. During the engagement in Muskogee, Hart saw the bodies of two men hauled into town and was told that a new marshal was on his way to Oklahoma with orders to round up the notorious Jennings gang. Hart asked around and found that Al Jennings and his brother, Frank, were local gunmen and train robbers. Al was a small man, barely five feet tall, with sandy hair, steel blue eyes, and a craving for adventure that was matched by his keen sense of humor. Eventually Jennings would be sent to the Ohio State Penitentiary. One morning during his stay in Muskogee, Hart rented a horse and went for a ride through the outlying country. Around eleven o’clock he came upon four rough-looking men camped in some cottonwoods along a creek bank. He asked them directions to the nearest trail back into town. The foursome eyed Hart suspiciously at first but gradually relaxed and asked him to share their grub. Hart in turn invited the men to see his play that night as his guest. “I was very young at the time,” the actor told a Hollywood reporter years later, and “very proud of my status as a kid actor, so I talked quite a lot about myself.” As the immodest thespian was leaving, the leader of the group confessed that he was the infamous Al Jennings and that\n\n35\n\nWilliam S. Hart the fellows with him were members of his gang. Hart later claimed, “We shook hands and parted on the best of terms.” When Hart came onstage that night at the Turner Opera House, he recognized Jennings and his gang sitting in the front row. A few feet away, in a box decorated with flags and bunting, sat the new marshal who had sworn to arrest the outlaws, totally unaware that the men he sought were in the theater. “I still feel a certain satisfaction that Al got away with it,” Hart wrote later. In Hollywood, Jennings and Hart would run into one another again when they were both making movies. Continuing his first starring tour in Kansas, Bill arrived in Coffeyville, where five years earlier the famed Dalton gang had been shot attempting to rob two banks simultaneously. He acquired a dog there, and they had great times running across the prairie after jackrabbits, which brought back memories of the childhood he increasingly cherished. In Peoria, Illinois, the manager of the hotel where the company stayed would not permit the hound in the rooms, so he was tied in a checkroom downstairs. When he chewed the end off a leather trunk, the hound was shipped back to Kansas, much to Bill’s regret. With the tour making so little money, Whitely abandoned the company in Illinois and advised Hart to do the same. But Bill and the other players decided to continue the tour and fulfill a booking in Youngstown, Ohio. By the time they reached Youngstown, Bill had secured a contract for a week’s engagement at the People’s Theater on the Bowery in New York, where he had performed earlier in Under the Polar Star. The troupe opened the Bowery engagement with The Man in the Iron Mask, which attracted major critics and received good notices. Frank Dietz, a prominent theatrical manager, promptly offered to finance Bill on a short spring tour. Hart closed his first starring season of eight months showing a profit of only $2.60. After returning to New York, he and six other men shared one room in a boardinghouse on Fifteenth Street. Bill’s mother and unmarried sisters by then had moved to the outskirts of Asheville, North Carolina, where they lived virtually destitute in two rooms of an old brick house. Bill visited them and found his family in need of proper food and clothing. “I then and there resolved I would\n\n36\n\nStruggling Actor never again try to become a star at such an expense,” Hart wrote in My Life East and West. He made the rounds of the agents and producers in New York but found no work until the leading man playing opposite Julia Arthur, an established actress, committed suicide as Arthur’s company was about to go on tour. Hart was hired to take the actor’s place. The troupe had been in rehearsal for several weeks with a repertoire that included As You Like It, Pygmalion and Galatea, Romeo and Juliet, and Ingomar, so stepping into the dead man’s roles was an ordeal for Hart. The company left for Detroit on a Friday night, had a dress rehearsal on Sunday evening, and opened in A Lady of Quality on Monday. “How I got through [the performance] I don’t know,” Hart said, “but I did.” His salary was again one hundred dollars a week, although he did not have to supply his own wardrobe, which was the most magnificent the fledgling actor had worn. In Romeo and Juliet alone he had five changes, all heavy silks and fine brocades. For the first time in his career, Hart had a dresser to help with his costumes. After playing several weeks on the road, Arthur’s troupe went into New York for a lengthy engagement at Wallack’s Theater. Critics were kind; Hart’s Romeo was deemed romantic, youthful, and filled with fiery impetuosity. Playing the Veronese lover was “such a far cry from the Western prairies,” Bill said, “that somehow I wished my father could have been there.” On completing his stint with Julia Arthur, roles proved so scarce that Hart took a temporary job as a yard detective for a railroad. But soon he got his biggest break yet. In the spring of 1899 he was engaged by Klaw and Erlanger to play Messala in the original staging of Ben Hur. Based on Lew Wallace’s best-selling novel and dramatized by William Young, the Roman epic called for an elaborate production, a chariot race, a sea rescue, and an enormous cast. The deterioration of the friendship between Messala and Ben Hur, Roman and Christian respectively, is the spine of the drama, and in many respects Messala is the more complex and interesting of the two roles. Klaw and Erlanger’s company rehearsed under Ben Teal’s direction for six weeks with the author present, but pulling the unwieldy piece together had its trying moments. Broadway producer Charles Frohman watched one\n\n37\n\nWilliam S. Hart of the final rehearsals and left the theater saying, “I’m afraid you’re up against it. The American public will never stand for Christ and a horse race in the same show.” In the third act of Ben Hur, Hart was to drive a team of horses onto the stage among a cluster of dancing girls. On opening night the owner of the horses shaved off his mustache and doubled for the actor, fearing that the team might not behave well and become too much for Hart to handle. The climactic chariot race was created with two horses, a white and a black, side by side on double treadmills, supplemented with a mass of wheels, steel cables, levers, the sound of cracking whips, and a panorama of the Circus Maximus racing past as the two finalists struggled for victory. Ben Hur’s and Messala’s horses alternated in front of one another until they reached stage center, whereupon Ben Hur’s chariot slowly pulled ahead and Messala’s collapsed. The sea rescue was achieved by stagehands in the wings shaking pieces of cloth to simulate waves. Audiences left the theater dazzled by the spectacle they had seen. Ben Hur opened on Broadway on November 29, 1899, and proved a tremendous hit, ensuring the company of a run that lasted until the following May. Reviewers were less enthusiastic about the show than the general public was, and the distinguished critic and theater historian William Winter trashed the cast. “More bad elocution has never, surely, been heard in one performance,” Winter wrote in his notice. Still, after the first performance Lew Wallace told Hart, “I want to thank you for giving me the Messala that I drew in my book.” Sculptor Eden Musee made a wax figure of Hart as the Roman aristocrat, and the actor posed for the artist several times. If nothing else, Hart made a muscular Messala and was hired to play the part for a second season, supported by an almost completely new cast. In Boston, Hart’s friend William Farnum took the role of Ben Hur, and on at least one occasion Hart played the title role himself. When a friend from Asheville came to see the drama, Hart asked him what he thought of his interpretation of Messala. “Fine! Fine!” the slightly inebriated man replied. “The horses were great!” Hart’s second season with Ben Hur ended at the Columbia Theater in Brooklyn, and he went to Asheville to spend the summer with\n\n38\n\nStruggling Actor his family. They attended church services at Biltmore, George Vanderbilt’s nearby palatial estate, and Bill coached an amateur theater group at the Asheville Opera House to help pay the family’s outstanding bills. During his stay, he became almost a father to his baby sister, Lotta. Mary Ellen had assumed the major responsibility of caring for their aging mother and continued to be a companion and comfort to Bill. Hart recalled this brief respite as one of the happiest times in his life. As fall approached, he hated to leave his family, but he had to prepare for another tour. “It seemed so hard again to break the chain,” Hart wrote. “Dear little Lotta smiled through her tears until she could not stand it any longer.” The next season Hart was playing John Storm, a minister, in The Christian during a matinee in Providence, Rhode Island, when a telegram arrived informing him that Lotta was dying of typhoid fever. He caught a train back to Asheville and arrived to find his youngest sister in delirium, with a temperature of 105 degrees. She died three days later with Bill at her bedside. “My world could never be again the same,” Hart wrote, “a part of my life passed from me.” The family left Asheville together. Bill placed his mother and Mary Ellen in a boardinghouse in Brooklyn, stayed with them long enough to oversee the burying of his little sister beside their father and brother, and rejoined the company performing The Christian. In February 1902 the troupe was playing a one-night stand at the Grand Opera House in Great Falls, Montana. On the afternoon before the performance, Hart and several other members of the company were invited to meet cowboy artist Charles M. Russell at the Park Hotel in Great Falls. Still in bereavement over Lotta’s death, Hart seemed withdrawn and had little to say. Russell later commented on the “feller who doesn’t talk none” during the daytime but rendered such eloquent discourse during the evening’s performance. Hart saw some of Charlie’s paintings in a saloon when the troupe played Helena, and the vitality of the art impressed the actor deeply. “When I look at the"
