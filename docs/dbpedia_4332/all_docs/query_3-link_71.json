While all writers must anticipate the prospect of unsatisfactory or even infuriating interpretations of their work, Native authors face a bafflingly capricious literary critical landscape defined by what Muscogee Creek and Cherokee literary scholar Craig Womack calls “the interdependency of politics and literature” (17). Were Fredric Jameson to enter the “Homeric battlefield” of interpretation in Native American and Indigenous literary studies, he might find at least some pleasure in encountering a prioritization of “the political interpretation of literary texts” (13, 17). Yet Native texts, whether novels or newspaper columns, short stories or screenplays, resist efforts to read them as advocating singular political positions. Moments of startling militancy might erupt in a work conventionally understood as assimilationist, while a Red Power novel might contain retrograde views, for example, of women, gay men, or Mexican Americans. With equal attention given to both recovered and canonical texts, The Political Arrays of American Indian Literary History takes as its central focus what Native texts say and do politically and proposes that literary scholars approach single texts, collections of texts by the same author and by multiple Native authors, and conversations among Native and non-­Native writers about their works as political arrays: confounding but also generative collisions of conservative, moderate, and progressive ideas that together constitute the rich political landscape of American Indian literary history.1 I define literature capaciously in this book. In the Introduction to Literary Theory (1996), Terry Eagleton entertains the possibility that literature means “any kind of writing which for some reason or another somebody values highly” (9). The Political Arrays of American Indian\n\n- 1 -\n\n- 2 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nLiterary History adopts a position shared by many scholars who value all writing by American Indians for a wide range of formal and political reasons, whether the writing appears in private letters, periodicals, or petitions or between the covers of a novel or collection of poems. Cherokee literary studies scholar and creative writer Daniel Heath Justice speaks eloquently to the commitment within Indigenous literary studies to value and listen carefully to Indigenous voices wherever and however they appear. In response to Anishinabe poet Marie Annharte Baker’s observation regarding the silencing of her mother’s generation of First Nations women, Justice asserts: Our literatures are just one more vital way that we have countered those forces of erasure and given shape to our own ways of being in the world. Our mindful stories, in all their forms and functions—­and whether vocalized, embodied, or inscribed—­honour the sacrifices of those who came before us and who made it possible for us to continue the struggle today as specific peoples in relation with the world. They help us bridge the gap of human imagination between one another, between other human communities, and between us and other-­than-­ human beings. Fundamentally, they affirm Indigenous presence—­ and our present. (Why Indigenous Literatures Matter, xix)\n\nJustice situates Indigenous literatures, “in all their forms and functions,” as central both to the survival of Indigenous communities and to resistance to anti-­Indigenous forces. By defining all the forms of writing under my consideration as literature and as significant contributions to American Indian literary history, I claim for them a specific value—­ cultural, historical, and political—­deriving in part from the extraordinary effort required even to find a voice and make it heard in powerfully anti-­Indigenous cultural, historical, and political contexts, especially prior to the civil rights era. By politics, I mean the struggle for and conflict over power, which political scientist Robert Dahl defines generally as a relation among people in which some have the resources to force others to act or live in ways they otherwise would not, specifically in colonial and settler–­ colonial contexts.2 Eagleton concludes his meditation on the definition of literature by positioning the act of making value judgments as part of this struggle and conflict, since these value judgments, he argues,\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 3 -\n\n“refer in the end not simply to private taste, but to the assumptions by which certain social groups exercise and maintain power over others” (16). Justice addresses this struggle and conflict, too, in the passage quoted above and consistently and in specific detail throughout the book from which it comes, Why Indigenous Literatures Matter (2017). Indeed, he conceives of the book as “avowedly political,” and after drawing on Menominee poet Chrystos’s rejection of “poetry without politics,” he observes, “To argue for and produce Indigenous writing as such is necessarily to engage in political struggle and to challenge centuries of representational oppression” (xvii–­x viii). This struggle and conflict sit in the foreground of almost all scholarship in Native American and Indigenous literary studies. We ask, frequently first and foremost, how do writers participate in this struggle and conflict? It is an enduring and perplexing question, one uniting scholars in the field in a common purpose but also dividing us when we disagree not about the cultural or historical significance of a work of literature but about the political positions we judge an author, or our fellow critics, to have taken. The Political Arrays of American Indian Literary History introduces political arrays as a concept that helps answer this central question in the field by illuminating the nuances, ambiguities, and ambivalences of the politics of Native American and Indigenous writing. Textual evidence of these arrays exists in public, readily accessible places, such as in poems and novels or book reviews and journal articles, as well as in the not quite as convenient manuscripts housed in libraries. They appear as intratextual, intertextual, intratribal, intertribal, transracial, trans-­Indigenous, and transnational, for example, with the forms and genres used by American Indian authors shaping them in unpredictable ways. As readers, we cannot predict the politics of a personal letter or detective novel. No form or genre emerges as more conservative or progressive than another. Also, while some political arrays emerge in conversations among American Indian authors, scholars can stage these conversations by identifying and tracing political arrays, some discrete and others expansive and sprawling, across space and time. These diachronic political arrays generated by literary critics have their own politics, or, at least, the critics constructing them will have their own political goals driving their work. How we treat these political arrays as distinct from each other, or how we treat their relative significance or validity, depends, too, on our own political allegiances.\n\n- 4 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nConsider the array generated by Louise Erdrich’s novels in the mid-­ 1980s, when Erdrich, who as a citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa has carefully navigated the politicized world of American Indian literature throughout her career, became one of the highest-­ profile Native writers. This particular array originates in the richly textured political worlds of the novels, and it includes personal letters, in which Erdrich takes an explicitly pro-­Indigenous position in the struggle for and conflict over power in a settler–­colonial context, and a book review by revered Laguna Pueblo writer Leslie Marmon Silko. On August 15, 1984, Erdrich wrote to Peter Matthiessen, who during a prolific career wrote at times on American Indian and environmental causes and won the National Book Award three times, to thank him for his kind words about her novel Love Medicine (1984). She took the opportunity to comment on Matthiessen’s work: “I was at Leonard Peltier’s trial in Fargo, and found the verdict shameful and incredible. Your book In the Spirit of Crazy Horse prompted the same reaction in many, many people. Thank you for that, too” (Erdrich to Matthiessen, August 15, 1984). Peltier’s defense team and prominent supporters, including Matthiessen, believed that the federal government had framed the activist, but the jury found Peltier guilty of killing FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. Matthiessen’s book had sparked Erdrich’s memory of and outrage over the 1977 trial. The following year, Erdrich responded to Mathiessen’s invitation to join an event in support of Peltier. She tells him, with a hint of anxious regret: I would like to be of use where Leonard Peltier is concerned, and although I can’t come to Washington this June there may be some other way I can help. I’d like to help. I’ve contacted the Minneapolis support group for a list of people to whom I might write in support of Leonard’s case. I don’t know Leonard personally, but was at his trial in Fargo and was convinced that his trial was mishandled and manipulated by the government. (Erdrich to Matthiessen, May 18, 1985)\n\nIn response to a query from Matthiessen, she states that she did not model Love Medicine’s Gerry Nanapush on Peltier but adds that “after the trial I put some specific events that resembled what happened in South Dakota because the injustice rankled” (Erdrich to Matthiessen,\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 5 -\n\nMay 18, 1985). Erdrich refers here to the appearance of Nanapush, like Peltier a member of the American Indian Movement (AIM), at Pine Ridge. Nanapush kills a state trooper and, as Peltier did in July 1979, escapes from prison.3 Erdrich ends the letter with another apology for declining the invitation to the Peltier event and a comment on her work with her husband Michael Dorris on fetal alcohol syndrome, “which has become near epidemic on some reservations” (Erdrich to Matthiessen, May 18, 1985). The shift in focus from her inability to attend the Peltier event to her dedication to ameliorating the damage caused by alcohol consumption in Native communities indicates possible concern that Matthiessen might judge her as insufficiently committed to the Peltier cause. She wants to help with Peltier but cannot, and she implies that Matthiessen need not question her political or activist credentials. She has another, possibly more significant, social problem to face. The publication of Erdrich’s second novel, The Beet Queen (1986), which focuses primarily on a non-­Native family, elicited more correspondence, but without any discussion of explicitly political issues, between the two authors. In a letter handwritten in hybrid print and cursive, Erdrich tells Matthiessen, “You are tremendously kind to have written in response to The Beet Queen. It means a very great deal to me, and I thank you” (Erdrich to Matthiessen, January 21, 1987). Fetal alcohol syndrome must have been on Erdrich’s mind daily two years after her initial exchange of letters with Matthiessen. Upon her marriage to Dorris in 1981, she had become mother to his three adopted Native children with FAS, and Dorris was still deep in the project that eventually reached publication in 1989 as The Broken Cord and won a National Book Critics Circle Award. The sentiments expressed in this private component of the array contrast sharply with the public statements by Silko, who had a less sanguine view than Matthiessen of The Beet Queen. In her October 7, 1986, review of the novel, Silko compliments its aesthetics but condemns its deplorable politics: “Self-­referential writing has an ethereal clarity and shimmering beauty because no history or politics intrudes to muddy the well of pure necessity contained within language itself” (179). Silko implies in this passage a tension, perhaps irresolvable, between the clarity, beauty, and purity of Erdrich’s artistic expression and history and politics, represented figuratively as mud, in a U.S. colonial and settler–­ colonial context. She specifies Erdrich’s failures later in the review:\n\n- 6 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Erdrich’s hands, the rural North Dakota of Indian-­hating, queer-­ baiting white farmers, of the Depression, becomes magically transformed. . . . What Erdrich, who is half-­Indian and grew up in North Dakota, attempts to pass off as North Dakota may be the only North Dakota she knows. But hers is an oddly rarified place in which the individual’s own psyche, not racism or poverty, accounts for all conflict and tension. In this pristine world all misery, suffering, and loss are self-­generated, just as conservative Republicans have been telling us for years. (180–­81)\n\nSilko’s reading of The Beet Queen as a conservative literary document, as a perpetuation of the racial politics of Ronald Reagan’s administration, sits in stark juxtaposition to Erdrich’s political self-­representation in her correspondence with Matthiessen at the same time in the mid-­1980s. The review of The Beet Queen in the Washington Post by author, critic, and literary magazine editor Wendy Lesser contributes another node, and another political perspective, to the array: Whereas Love Medicine derived a great deal of its originality (and also, one fears, a portion of its critical success) from the fact that it chronicled the previously unexamined lives of American Indians, The Beet Queen uses the Chippewa stories only as it uses everything else—­as supporting material in the creation of fascinating personalities. Admittedly, the eponymous agricultural monarch—­a girl named Dot Adare—­is one-­quarter Chippewa; yet the most interesting part of her family is not the Kashpaws, but the crazy white Adares. (“Louise Erdrich’s Plains Song”)\n\nIn the parenthetical comment about the critical response to Love Medicine, Lesser laments that some readers valued a novel for its dedication to illuminating “the previously unexamined lives of American Indians.” To many readers, such an observation sounds uninformed, since it suggests a lack of familiarity with writers such as Silko, N. Scott Momaday (Kiowa), and James Welch (Blackfeet and Gros Ventre), among many others. At the same time, Lesser’s words resonate as politically reactionary, since she rejects precisely the reason why so many readers value the work of Native American and Indigenous writers: they\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 7 -\n\nchallenge what Justice calls “those forces of erasure” and break a coerced historical silence. Silko found herself at the center of another, similar political array several years after her review of The Beet Queen when fellow Laguna Pueblo writer Paula Gunn Allen objected to Silko’s use in Ceremony of Laguna Pueblo oral traditions. Allen claims, “To use the oral tradition directly is to run afoul of native ethics, which is itself a considerable part of the tradition. Using the tradition while contravening it is to do violence to it. The ethical issue is both political and metaphysical, and to violate the traditional ethos is to run risks that no university professor signed up for in any case” (379). The scholarly examination of the oral traditions in Ceremony exacerbates Allen’s dismay: “I believe I could no more do (or sanction) the kind of ceremonial investigation of Ceremony done by some researchers than I could slit my mother’s throat. Even seeing some of it published makes my skin crawl” (383). Allen offers the following ominous assertion in response to Silko’s ethical and political transgressions: “Telling the old stories, revealing the old ways can only lead to disaster” (384). This warning appears to draw upon one of the most compelling and frequently cited moments in Silko’s novel, the gathering of witches during which a powerful conjuror calls white people into existence. When the other witches express their fear of these violent thieves and killers, their powerful confederate tells them, “It’s already turned loose. / It’s already coming. / It can’t be called back” (138). While in the earlier array Silko characterizes Erdrich’s novel as a 1980s conservative Republican document, in this new array Allen positions Silko as a dangerous and potentially very destructive witch aligned with colonial and settler–­colonial forces, including academic ones.4 This array shares a node—­Peter Matthiessen—­w ith the first example. Allen’s article on Ceremony appeared in 1990 as Silko worked to complete Almanac of the Dead, a novel widely perceived as the most explicitly anticolonial and politically insurgent work of fiction by a Native American writer. Acoma Pueblo author Simon Ortiz read Almanac of the Dead the following fall, and in a letter to Matthiessen three months prior to its publication, he observes, “I am now reading the galley copy of Leslie Silko’s Almanac of the Dead. It is quite a novel, a dark wonder, insightful with a terrible and powerful rage, dealing with ‘white’ people and America as honestly as possible. Upon its release this fall, it will raise a storm I expect. I’ve only read the first 150 pages of a 1500 page\n\n- 8 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nbook, but I expect the rest is just as wonderful” (Ortiz to Matthiessen, August 24, 1991). This private praise from a legendary figure, honored as a poet but also as the author of the “foundational” essay “Towards a National Indian Literature: Cultural Authenticity in Nationalism,” coheres with the dust jacket blurb by Larry McMurtry on the novel’s first edition: “A brilliant, haunting, and tragic novel of ruin and resistance in the Americas. In a long dialectic, tinted with genius and compelled by a just anger, Leslie Silko dramatizes the often desperate struggle of native peoples in the Americas to keep, at all costs, the core of their culture: their way of seeing, their way of believing, their way of being.”5 Silko dedicated the book to McMurtry, whose “pathological” Blue Duck from Lonesome Dove (1985) appalled scholars of Native literatures such as Louis Owens.6 These letters, novels, reviews, articles, and paratexts form an array of political positions on and investments in American Indian literary expression, and they illustrate the political minefield into which all Native authors step when they begin to write. The tribal national, colonial, and settler–­colonial contexts in which they write produce urgency and anxiety in many readers, who often respond to an alleged textual lack as powerfully as they do to the words on the page. Silko comments, for example, on what she perceives as a glaring absence in The Beet Queen: “After all, the Wounded Knee Massacre is only 42 years and 400 miles south of Sita and the others in Erdrich’s novel” (Review of The Beet Queen, 182). Even a 763-­page novel with strong activist bona fides such as Almanac of the Dead faces similar criticism from Crow Creek Dakota scholar Elizabeth Cook-­Lynn, a luminary in Native literary studies. While she praises Silko’s Almanac for “engag[ing] in and insist[ing] upon the nationalist’s approach to historical events and in the process seems to put any so-­called pandering ordinarily required of the storyteller in its place,” Cook-­Lynn also asserts that the novel “fails in this nationalistic approach, since it does not take into account the specific kind of tribal/nation status of the original occupants of this continent” (Why I Can’t, 93). Silko demands explicit resistance from Erdrich; Cook-­ Lynn demands a better kind of resistance from Silko. The political stakes of Indigenous writing, of giving voice to Indigenous peoples and their histories, make John Updike’s first rule for reviewing books—­“ Try to understand what the author wished to do, and do not blame him for not achieving what he did not attempt” (xviii)—­sound naive.7\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 9 -\n\nWe might consider such responses not as condemnations, however, but as articulations of the desire for differently political Indigenous literatures. Silko’s and Cook-­Lynn’s political desires align them with many scholars of American Indian literatures, including this one, who also read for resistance and search for and find explicitly anticolonial and decolonial narratives, often in surprising places: in a petition posted by Abenakis outside an English fort in 1747; in the late 1830s or early 1840s in Rome, Italy, in a conversion narrative by Pablo Tac, a young Native man from California; in a letter between the quarreling lovers Gertrude Simmons and Carlos Montezuma in June 1901.8 Such narratives appear more readily identifiable during and following the civil rights era and the emergence of the Native American Renaissance, when the historical fact of direct action by Native activists, and the widespread coverage of it in the dominant media, coincides generally with an ostensibly greater number of Native writers getting their work into print and earning accolades. Yet as Silko and Cook-­Lynn suggest, and Erdrich’s correspondence with Matthiessen demonstrates, resistance even during the Renaissance takes many forms. The more dramatic acts of resistance take center stage in American Indian literary studies. An event such as the occupation of Alcatraz from November 20, 1969, to June 11, 1971, serves as a political touchstone that for some scholars shapes this new cultural and literary era. Sean Teuton’s Red Land, Red Power: Grounding Knowledge in the American Indian Novel (2008) and Dean Rader’s Engaged Resistance: American Indian Art, Literature, and Film from Alcatraz to the NMAI (2011), to take two inspirational studies as examples, foreground the significance of the occupation of Alcatraz in late 1969 as a key moment in Native American political and cultural expression. Following epigraphs from Clyde Warrior, a Ponca activist and one of the founders of the National Indian Youth Council in 1961, and Momaday, Teuton opens the introduction to his book at the beginning of a compelling moment of direct action: “On 9 November 1969, a young American Indian student dove from a borrowed sailboat into the frigid waters of San Francisco Bay and swam 250 yards against swift currents to reclaim Alcatraz Island as Indian land” (1). This moment works as the narrative catalyst for Teuton’s literary critical assertions: “During the era of Red Power, Native writers imagined a new narrative for Indian country, and they did so neither by longing for an impossibly timeless past nor by disconnecting Indians’\n\n- 10 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nstories from the political realities of their lives. Instead, writers of the era struggled to better interpret a colonized world and then offered this new knowledge to empower the people” (2). Teuton traces the roots of Red Power activism to Pontiac and Tecumseh, Ottawa and Shawnee leaders, respectively, who led intertribal military alliances against colonials and settler colonials. “Red Power activists,” Teuton argues, “developed a new, more sophisticated form of resistance to American imperialism. Boldly intellectual, they were better trained than their forebears to translate their culture-­specific tribal values to European Americans” (5). In the chapters that follow, Teuton identifies Momaday’s House Made of Dawn, Welch’s Winter in the Blood, and Silko’s Ceremony as Red Power novels. While he makes a persuasive argument, we could productively think of these novels also, or instead, as explorations and revelations of the roots of Red Power. All three authors set their novels before the Red Power era, and the novels do not, therefore, engage Red Power politics directly. As Teuton notes, too, House Made of Dawn appeared in print a year before the events at Alcatraz; some of it appeared as much as three years earlier, in Momaday’s “Three Sketches from House Made of Dawn” in the Autumn 1966 issue of the Southern Review, where the contributor’s note describes the novel as “recently completed” (933). The January 1967 issue of the progressive periodical the Reporter and the Summer 1967 issue of New Mexico Quarterly also published excerpts. It was complete prior to the founding of the American Indian Movement in Minneapolis in 1968, as well as before Richard Oakes made his now-­famous dive.9 The effort “to better interpret a colonized world” also involved healthy disagreement among Native writers, intellectuals, and activists. Revered scholars such as Alfonso Ortiz, an anthropologist from San Juan Pueblo, and Beatrice Medicine, an anthropologist from Standing Rock, along with Vine Deloria Jr., D’Arcy McNickle, Momaday, Simon Ortiz, and many others, attended the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars at Princeton University in March 1970, four months into the occupation of Alcatraz.10 The meeting produced a political array of entirely Native voices articulating an expansive constellation of views. In the discussion following his talk on American Indian philosophy, Alfonso Ortiz, convocation chairman, comments, “I’ve seen many nonIndian audiences addressed, particularly in California, by a really fiery Red Power type and, you know, I think nonIndian Americans have become so mesmerized in being insulted that many of them actually\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 11 -\n\nenjoy it. This is frightening, you know. They would rather be insulted than informed or intellectually stimulated” (Costo et al., Indian Voices, 21). “I think,” Ortiz concludes his thoughts on Red Power discourse, “that it really doesn’t touch them [nonIndians] inside” (22). Momaday, in the discussion after he delivered “The Man Made of Words,” also mentions Alcatraz: I had very little hope for it at first. I was very skeptical about it, because I thought it was going to be terminated very quickly, and that the Indian would be left holding the bag, and simply the scapegoat in that whole venture. It turned into something rather more serious than that, and there is no way at this point to realize just what it’s going to be. But symbolically, it’s very important at this moment, and the kind of sympathy for the Indian that has been generated in the Bay Area is really quite remarkable and quite impressive. (Costo et al., Indian Voices, 71)\n\nIn his presentation on Native American Studies programs, W. Roger Buffalohead, previously of UCLA’s American Indian Culture Program but at the time a new faculty member in the University of Minnesota’s Indian Studies Department, remarks on the destructive factionalism that had developed in the UCLA program over whether to focus on the “remedial or revolutionary material” (Costo et al., Indian Voices, 165). His contribution to the conversation following his talk includes this observation: “If you are going to teach students to be involved and to be activists, as was done at California, can you then draw a line and say to them: You’ve got to come back from Alcatraz and learn your lessons? Those of us who had approved this involvement at Alcatraz were caught in a fix. What could we say?” (172). During the same discussion, Medicine laments that her students at San Francisco State “who went to Alcatraz didn’t keep up their studies” and comments that the “revolutionaries . . . really aren’t doing much in terms of intellectual growth or in social movement either” (179). Rupert Costo, president of the Steering Committee, concludes the summation of his panel, titled “Forms and Uses of Tribal Government,” by objecting, “Some of the young Indian people are relentlessly alienating the older folks, who would normally be their staunchest supporters and allies. This is a needless posture to take. Not everybody can picket. Some of us are fighting just as hard,\n\n- 12 -\n\nIntroduction\n\non other fronts, in other ways, in directions equally important” (Costo et al., Indian Voices, 297). Medicine later delivered two talks at the convocation, including one entitled “Red Power: Real or Potential?” in which she asserts, “[Red Power’s] positive aspects have never been universal in the Indian world. Many Indian people consider it a misnomer; some consider it as action; picketing; destroying property; capturing islands. Some consider it stupid” (Costo et al., Indian Voices, 303). She adds that some students of Red Power “have not made the transition from confrontation politics to the exacting studies, which possibly are a better step to effective power” (303), before stating her preference for the cultivation of Native “intellectual power,” which “would stem from wisdom and an awareness of the structure of power in the dominant society” (305). As the chair of a panel titled “The Urban Scene and the American Indian,” Deloria refers to the “alleged Red Power movement, which is just in Stan Steiner’s head, and only occasionally outside of that area” (Costo et al., Indian Voices, 333–­34). Ortiz’s, Momaday’s, Buffalohead’s, Costo’s, Medicine’s, and Deloria’s distinct views on Alcatraz and Red Power, as well as the many positions expressed by the participants in the spirited conversations following Medicine’s presentation on Red Power and Deloria’s, titled “The Urban Scene,” demonstrate that the intellectual and political contexts of this era resist generalization. Rader draws the same direct correlation between grassroots activism and a new era of Native literary and other artistic expression. “Engaged Resistance: Alcatraz,” chapter 1 of Engaged Resistance, begins with an epigraph from a poem by an anonymous “poet-­occupier” at Alcatraz and a photo of a tepee on the grounds of the prison. Rader defines engaged resistance as “a fundamentally indigenous form of aesthetic discourse that engages both Native and American cultural contexts as a mode of resistance against the ubiquitous colonial tendencies of assimilation and erasure” (1). After a paragraph in which he comments on Simon Ortiz’s aforementioned essay, Rader continues, “The book demonstrates that Native-­produced texts like poetry, fiction, movies, paintings, and sculpture are fundamental products and processes of American Indian sovereignty” and “explores how Native cultural expression comprises a strategy of aesthetic activism fashioned by Natives for both Native and Anglo publics” (1). Alcatraz, Rader contends, makes this kind of aesthetic and literary activism possible: “I argue that Alcatraz marks a movement away from cultural segregation\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 13 -\n\nin favor of cultural engagement, enabling Natives to reclaim identity on their own terms. By ‘cultural segregation,’ I mean not only reservations but also various other ways of marginalizing Indians and even rendering them invisible or dead. The occupation of Alcatraz enables not only reclamation of identity but also public, visible, rhetorically sophisticated performances of this reclamation for both Native and non-­Native audiences” (3). Rader takes readers through the resistance at work in paintings, novels, films, poems, and public art before finishing with the National Museum of the American Indian. As with the three novels at the center of Teuton’s study, the first three novels under Rader’s consideration—­Charles Red Corn’s A Pipe for February (2002), Debra Magpie Earling’s Perma Red (2002), and Louise Erdrich’s The Plague of Doves (2008)—­have pre-­civil-­rights-­era settings. These Native authors also imagine acts of resistance—­singing an Ojibwe song, learning from an Osage elder, committing an act of vigilantism, or surviving—­before the Red Power era and illuminate the world that shaped these acts and circumscribed other forms of resistance.11 The literary critical and political act of marking a specific historical moment after which Native people imagined new narratives, interpreted the experience of colonialism more productively, moved from cultural segregation to cultural engagement, reclaimed their identities, and publicly performed those identities risks implicating previous generations—­and perhaps primarily the most immediately prior one—­in the failure to imagine, interpret, reclaim, and perform in particular ways. These literary critical and political acts also reinforce the perception of the Native American Renaissance as a rupture. The Political Arrays of American Indian Literary History does not question the literary, artistic, and political significance of either the Renaissance or the post-­Renaissance era from the mid-­1990s to the present.12 However, it seeks to challenge our understanding of the Renaissance as a literary and political break with the past. This book looks to the Native writers and intellectuals of the early and middle decades of the twentieth century for the literary historical and political contexts that informed the development of different forms of resistance by activists and writers of the next generation. It foregrounds continuities among the writers of the first two decades of the Renaissance and the writers of the generations to either side of the 1970s and 1980s. For example, Silko’s condemnation of The Beet Queen\n\n- 14 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nand Allen’s excoriation of Ceremony place both Erdrich and Silko in the company of many pre-­Renaissance Native writers who face the displeasure and dissatisfaction of late-­t wentieth-­and early-­t wenty-­first-­ century scholars over their lamentable politics, especially their failures to affirm an Indigenous identity culturally and politically distinct—­or distinct enough—­ f rom non-­ Natives. While Choctaw author Todd Downing does not center Indigenous identity and politics in his crime novels published in the 1930s, to the chagrin of critics such as Wolfgang Hochbruck, his novels are no less an expression of a Choctaw author interpreting the experience of colonialism or moving from cultural segregation to cultural engagement than Momaday’s House Made of Dawn or Silko’s Ceremony, or, to keep the comparison within the crime-­fiction genre, Choctaw author D. L. Birchfield’s Black Silk Handkerchief (2006) or Cherokee author Sara Sue Hoklotubbe’s series of Sadie Walela mysteries (2003–­14). We might also look to Cherokee writer John Milton Oskison’s cleverly subversive Tecumseh and His Times: The Story of a Great Indian (1938) as a work of nonfiction that anticipates Deloria’s Red Power–­era manifesto Custer Died for Your Sins (1969) in its expression of an enduring hope for an Indigenous future that runs from Tecumseh and Hiawatha to “the obscure Osage communicant in his peyote lodge today” and its celebration of the “long tradition of protest against subjection” of the Shawnees (Tecumseh, viii, 4). Oskison mentions at the end of the biography a prophecy of Tecumseh’s return, and he expresses a desire for a leader like him, one of the “champions of the ideal of Indian sovereignty” and “a crusader for Indian rights” (4, 80), capable of building the peyote “movement into one of active protest against a rubber-­ stamp Christian civilization” (236–­37). Such an emphatic statement leads readers to wonder what Oskison would have thought of some of the chapters in Deloria’s Custer or Red Earth, White Lies (1997). Downing’s crime novels and Oskison’s Tecumseh, among many other works in the twenty years before and after World War II, resist generalizations of these eras as literarily and politically impotent, tentative, or assimilationist. Just as the most revered writers of the Renaissance, such as Silko and Erdrich, produce literary moments that read as unsatisfying or dangerously conservative to other writers and prominent scholars, pre-­Renaissance writers produce literary moments that under the same political criteria read as satisfying: “Now Mexico is an Indian country,” Downing declares in 1940 in The Mexican Earth, “where the\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 15 -\n\nwhite man is rapidly being bred out” (320). Ewing Hartshorne, a young Choctaw writer whose “Indian Lore Quiz” appeared in a few issues of the monthly magazine the American Indian, included the following question in one of the quizzes: “When were battles and raids between the whites and Indians called massacres?” (August 1927, 4). His answer is a clever revelation of non-­Native control of dominant historical narratives and a reminder of successful Indigenous resistance: “When the Indians won” (6). Just as the literary works of the first two decades of the Renaissance do not consistently, explicitly, or rigorously express orthodox Red Power politics—­again, House Made of Dawn, Ceremony, and Winter in the Blood, to take three celebrated novels as examples, are set before Alcatraz and the rise of AIM—­their predecessors did not consistently, explicitly, or rigorously promote assimilation as the only course forward for Indigenous people. Even in hindsight in her memoir, Crazy Brave (2012), acclaimed first-­generation Renaissance writer Joy Harjo (Mvskoke) does not tell of a young adult life shaped by Red Power politics. Though Red Power emerged in her formative late-­teen years, she mentions Alcatraz only once. Instead, Harjo emphasizes what she calls at one point “the drudgery of survival”—­young motherhood, poverty, domestic abuse, alcoholism—­and her search to fulfill “the need for artistic expression” (135). In her own memoir, The Turquoise Ledge (2010), Silko acknowledges that “anyone who dared to reveal ceremonial secrets”—­the transgression that Allen accused Silko of committing in Ceremony—­“risked severe reprisals from the supernatural world” (51). However, she did not conceive of The Turquoise Ledge as a political work: “I had decided before I started the memoir that I wanted as much as possible to avoid unpleasantness and strife and politics” (170). This decision explains the absence of any references to American Indian activism, even in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when Silko attended the University of New Mexico and taught at Navajo Community College. All these authors, pre-­and post-­Renaissance, worked or continue to work in vexing and at times exciting political contexts. They generally respond to these contexts not with blunt political statements but with nuanced discussions of how Indigenous peoples might best navigate them. The Political Arrays of American Indian Literary History turns its attention to these textual and extratextual arrays to foreground the broad diversity of political voices in the most recent hundred years of American Indian literary history.\n\n- 16 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Politics of American Indian Literature Scholars in American Indian literary studies agree that literature by American Indians within colonial and settler–­colonial contexts always has an urgent political component. However, many unacknowledged assumptions about American Indian politics guide how scholars in the field evaluate literary texts. These assumptions originate in the central role played by the civil rights activism of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the early Native American Renaissance period, in defining what constitutes desirable or ideal political positions for American Indian authors to adopt and scholars in the field to endorse. One of the more common assumptions, for example, is that a literary work is not political, or not political enough, if it fails to convey explicitly prosovereignty and anticolonial messages. In American Indian literary studies, “political” almost always means “progressive,” and much of our understanding of a text’s value derives from the critical pressure that we exert to make it politically appealing. Contemporary Native American literary criticism does not, as Jameson would have it, so much “rewrite selected texts” (17), though that happens, as preselect texts for attention based on rather narrow political positions that often do not map well onto even the most radically insurgent piece of writing. The ahistorical treatment of politics, or the imposition of one era’s political contexts onto another era, often produces compelling—­and even important—­scholarship. However, it does not necessarily produce clarity about either the literary or political significance of works by American Indian writers. In addition, it obscures formal, cultural, and political continuities in American Indian literary history between pre-­ and post-­civil-­rights-­era writers.13 In its approach to writing by American Indian authors, The Political Arrays of American Indian Literary History resists this flattening of the politics of American Indian literary expression and, in so doing, joins a conversation among scholars such as Lisa Brooks, Kirby Brown, Joanna Hearne, Shari Huhndorf, Maureen Konkle, Joshua Nelson, Robert Dale Parker, Beth Piatote, Phillip Round, Cheryl Suzack, Kiara Vigil, Amy Ware, and Jace Weaver, many of whom appear in the following pages. As Huhndorf and Suzack explain in their introduction to Indigenous Women and Feminism (2010), Indigenous feminists have played an especially crucial role not only in diversifying Indigenous political activity, with sustained efforts to\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 17 -\n\nresist male dominance in American Indian activist organizations and tribal national governance and to draw attention to the “systematic disempowerment of Indigenous women” under colonialism and settler colonialism, but also in challenging reductive narratives of Indigenous politics (5). In fact, Huhndorf observes in “Indigenous Feminism, Performance, and the Politics of Memory in the Plays of Monique Mojica,” her contribution to Indigenous Women and Feminism, “Native cultural authenticity and political resistance have been gendered male” (183). The Political Arrays of American Indian Literary History takes into account the contemporary historical and political contexts to which American Indian authors respond, the political positions that they take in their writing, and the political perspectives that implicitly or explicitly shape the scholarship on their work. The book also insists on the historicizing of the political contexts in which authors write and will foreground the literary strategies authors use to represent and explore the political lives of American Indians. The Political Arrays of American Indian Literary History examines the full range of political expression by American Indian writers beyond the literature of the late 1960s and early 1970s that, by serving as the field’s primary political touchstone, has obscured the rich political diversity of the last hundred years of American Indian literary history. It challenges both the powerful assumptions about American Indian politics that structure scholarly discourse in the field and the literary criticism those assumptions produce. Despite what much of the criticism suggests, even the most revered American Indian writers of the civil rights era rarely incorporated Red Power politics into their work. Indeed, in their early Renaissance novels, Silko’s and Momaday’s main political concern is the interference by settler–­colonial forces (church, federal government, military) in Pueblo life in New Mexico during the interwar and early Cold War periods rather than pan-­Indian organizing against police brutality, treaty violations, or the incompetence of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and federally controlled tribal governments. American Indian literary history also includes, for instance, Gertrude Bonnin’s grassroots activism and antipeyotism, Will Rogers’s interwar noninterventionism, John Milton Oskison’s conservative Cherokee exceptionalism, Todd Downing’s Indigenous transnationalism, and Sherman Alexie’s and Thomas King’s simultaneously hopeful and skeptical liberalism.14\n\n- 18 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis Introduction and a Conclusion on the political alliances between Gerald Vizenor (White Earth Anishinabe) and Alexie (Spokane and Coeur d’Alene) frame chapters devoted to novels, short stories, films, letters, crime fiction, and columns and editorials published in the middle decades of the twentieth century. The book has particular sympathy for writers and texts neglected by mainstream American Indian literary criticism and therefore follows the lead of scholars, such as Brooks, Konkle, Parker, Piatote, Round, and Matt Cohen, who study Native voices in overlooked sites of writing and prepare some of the ground for identifying provocative political alliances, and sometimes less satisfying political tensions, among Native writers. Some of the literary and cultural productions under consideration in The Political Arrays of American Indian Literary History will enter the contemporary scholarly conversation for the first time in this book. Each chapter will also develop diachronic arrays by emphasizing links between pre-­ Renaissance and post-­Renaissance writers and filmmakers. While scholars of American Indian literary studies have opened the field to a wide variety of texts, from notes written on birch bark to winter counts and earthworks, nonfiction published in periodicals remains unexamined as significant Native writing. Periodicals produced and edited by American Indians contain a profusion of political arrays, with the implicit or explicit political views in editorials, columns, and advertisements, for example, often in tension with each other. “Indigenous Editing,” the first chapter, considers the American Indian Magazine (1913–­20), the publication of an intertribal organization called the Society of American Indians, and the American Indian, a magazine published in Tulsa from 1926 to 1931 almost entirely by an American Indian editorial board and staff. The former periodical was conceived specifically to influence federal Indian policy on the national stage and had as editors both Arthur C. Parker (Seneca) and Gertrude Bonnin (Dakota); the latter was a general-­interest publication attuned to the political, cultural, and economic concerns of a regional audience in northeastern Oklahoma. The American Indian, edited by Lee F. Harkins (Choctaw), contains the work of nearly unknown or entirely forgotten Native writers such as Joe Bruner (Creek), James Culberson (Choctaw), Ewing Hartshorne (Choctaw), Annetta Lohmann (Osage), Emily P. Robitaille (Chippewa), and Muriel Wright (Choctaw).15 These periodicals set the stage for journals such as the Indian Historian / Wassaja (1967–­80) and\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 19 -\n\nliterary magazines such as Sun Tracks, which ran as a periodical from 1971 until 1979 before becoming a book series. Chapter 2 considers transnational Cherokee political arrays in the work published in national periodicals by childhood friends Will Rogers and John Milton Oskison, with what Cherokee Nation scholar Kirby Brown calls the “trans/national stateswomanship” of their contemporary, Ruth Muskrat Bronson, as well as Brown’s scholarship on it, providing additional nodes in the array. While their childhood in the Cherokee Nation influenced their political views, they developed political identities later in life primarily in response to World War I and its aftermath. Rogers came to oppose both military and cultural intervention by the United States, and Oskison increasingly embraced ethnic nationalism. When he writes about Mexico, for example, Rogers expresses nostalgia for a simpler, premodern life while also constantly needling the U.S. federal government for its coercive and in some cases violent interventions in Mexican national life. While Rogers used his commentary on Mexico to promote noninterventionism, Oskison produces a familiar depiction of a turbulent, uncivilized Mexico and ignorant, incompetent Mexicans of various ethnic groups and social classes. Oskison’s political history, which suggests a concern for the social welfare of minority ethnic communities, does not prepare readers for such lamentable depictions. The politics of his posthumously published autobiography, “A Tale of the Old I.T.,” help contextualize his views of Mexico and Mexicans. His portrait of the Cherokee Nation in the autobiography distinguishes Cherokees from other Indigenous Americans and asserts rural forms of labor, elite eastern education, law and order, and literacy as the key features of national Cherokee life. Socially, culturally, and politically, Oskison aligns an exceptional Cherokee Nation with the United States rather than with other tribal nations. Their divergent representations of Mexico anticipate a post-­Renaissance political array with the same transnational focus in Silko’s and Momaday’s first novels as well as in Alexie’s incisive, and often playful, references to indigeneity in Mexico. Chapter 3 considers the surprising anticolonial politics of the shooting script of the Lynn Riggs and James Hughes film A Day in Santa Fe (1931) and of the film itself, and it identifies and develops a transhistorical array linking A Day in Santa Fe to films by late-­t wentieth-­and early-­t wenty-­first-­century independent Indigenous filmmakers. The European and immigrant European American interest in Indigenous\n\n- 20 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmerican artifacts within a historical context of colonial Spanish and Catholic dominance defines much of Part I of the script and film. Part II of the script and film, however, decenters the colonial authority and primitivist orientation of Santa Fe in Part I by asserting a specifically Pueblo way of being in and knowing the land. The chapter argues that the film is a work of both Indigenous primitivism and the Cherokee avant-­garde that challenges stereotypical caricatures in other silent films from the era, such as Redskin (1929) and The Silent Enemy (1930). Late-­t wentieth-­century and early-­t wenty-­first-­century films such as Arlene Bowman’s Navajo Talking Picture (1986) and Dustinn Craig’s experimental 4wheelwarpony (2008) consider remarkably similar concerns about privacy, cultural continuity, and the history of colonial violence in the Indigenous Southwest. Though biographers of Native writers such as Bonnin, McNickle, and Riggs draw heavily on their correspondence, there are few studies of the art and politics of personal letters by American Indian writers, with only Silko’s correspondence with poet James Wright earning mention by scholars.16 Wright initiated the correspondence with a remarkable letter dated August 28, 1978, in which he struggles to convey how much he admires Ceremony: “I think I am trying to say that my very life means more to me than it would have meant if you hadn’t written Ceremony” (in Anne Wright, The Delicacy and Strength of Lace, 3). In his next letter, Wright asks Silko to consider applying for a Guggenheim Fellowship and offers to write a letter of recommendation for her (Delicacy, 5). This invitation into a network of writers recalls Simon Ortiz’s request for a recommendation for the same award from Matthiessen: “Peter, this year I am applying for a Guggenheim, and I am submitting your name as a reference to make a comment about me and my work” (Ortiz to Matthiessen, August 24, 1991). Neither Silko nor Ortiz have won a Guggenheim, though Silko won a MacArthur Genius grant in its first year along with writers such as Cormac McCarthy, Derek Walcott, and Robert Penn Warren. This Renaissance-­era correspondence between Native and non-­Native writers replicates exchanges in the previous generation, such as the one between Charles Alexander Eastman and the Pulitzer Prize–­w inning writer Hamlin Garland, who, for example, wrote to Eastman with praise for Indian Boyhood (1902).17 The letters from Wright to Silko and Ortiz to Matthiessen evince the private, delicate diplomacy in which Indigenous writers engage\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 21 -\n\nas they navigate the settler–­colonial politics of what literary studies scholar James F. English calls “the economy of prestige (the economy of symbolic cultural production)” and the institutions controlling it (75). In their letters to scholars and fellow writers, including mutual non-­Native friend and University of Oklahoma English professor Walter S. Campbell / Stanley Vestal, John Joseph Mathews and Riggs speak frankly and eloquently about their lives and art while also working within but in opposition to the dramatically asymmetrical relations of privilege and power between self-­supporting Native writers and non-­Native writers employed at flagship universities. Though their letters, the subject of Chapter 4, do not produce public political arrays, they speak directly to the history and politics of literary studies in the academy. Their letters also add many more pages of writing to mid-­ twentieth-­century American Indian literary history, and they reveal, along with the surprisingly diverse bibliographies of southwestern literature produced by their correspondents and other scholars, their contributions to the emergence of a modestly progressive for the time, but to this point unrecognized, mid-­t wentieth-­century academic network inclusive of American Indian writers. The letters between Mathews and non-­Native Texas folklorist J. Frank Dobie provide a particularly intimate look into this network. Mathews’s social conservatism might have delayed his appreciation by scholars of American Indian literatures, but Dobie, along with other academics, advocated for him in the 1940s and 1950s. Mathews’s commitment to documenting Osage life eventually, following Robert Warrior’s Tribal Secrets (1995), made him a central writer and intellectual in American Indian literary studies at the end of the twentieth century. Riggs had equally rich if not as well documented friendships with Campbell and Pulitzer Prize–­w inning playwright Paul Green. He even sent his short drama manifesto about socially conscious theater as a seventeen-­page letter to the latter. The Vine Theatre, Riggs argued, would resist “the triumphant, arrogant state” that “by pogrom, by discriminatory laws—­ and the other tools of inhumanity and cruelty” crushes all opposition to it (Riggs to Green, March 5, 1939). Riggs’s friendship with Green and Mathews’s with Dobie extended into the 1950s. Late in that decade, Yvor Winters, who crossed paths with Riggs in the 1920s in Santa Fe and who expressed in his poetry admiration for if also an imperfect understanding of Indigenous cultures, became Momaday’s mentor at\n\n- 22 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nStanford.18 Momaday identifies this moment as his “first big break.”19 During the last few decades before the end of legal segregation and in an anti-­Indigenous settler–­colonial world, Mathews and Riggs established in their private correspondence with non-­Native writers a set of political arrays that anticipates and helps to contextualize later moments in American Indian literary history such as Momaday’s “first big break” and Ortiz’s appeal to Matthiessen. Chapter 5, “Crimes against Indigeneity,” examines the diachronic political arrays circulating within and among detective novels by Native authors, with a primary focus on Todd Downing, Sara Sue Hoklotubbe (Cherokee), and Carole laFavor (Ojibwa).20 In the golden age of detective fiction almost sixty years before the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act or U.S. Public Law 101-­601, Downing wrote several novels in which criminals steal Indigenous Mexican artifacts and human remains to sell on the black market to museums in the United States. By using crime fiction to illuminate the transgressions committed against Indigenous peoples and, in some cases, to expose a legal system indifferent or antagonistic to them, Downing anticipates the work of post-­civil-­rights-­era crime novels by American Indian authors, especially Hoklotubbe and laFavor but also Alexie, Thomas King, Louis Owens, Marcie Rendon (White Earth Anishinabe), and Ron Querry (Choctaw). The focus of these authors on crimes against Indigenous peoples and communities establishes a robustly progressive political array linking the pre-­and post-­Renaissance eras. The conclusion, “Speculative Arrays,” turns to an example that highlights the always self-­conscious, selective critical work informing the identification and development of any political array in American Indian literary history. In the collection of essays Mixedblood Messages (1998), Louis Owens observes, “Gerald Vizenor and Sherman Alexie are at opposite ends of the spectrum of contemporary Indian writing” (81). He objects in particular to Alexie “posing militantly while giving the white audience what it already knows and desires” (81). In subsequent interviews, Alexie confirms that he also sees a distinction between his work and Vizenor’s, commenting, for example, “If Indian literature can’t be read by the average 12-­year-­old kid living on the reservation, what the hell good is it? You couldn’t take any of [Vizenor’s] books and take them to a rez and teach them, without extreme protestation” (Purdy and\n\nIntroduction\n\n- 23 -\n\nAlexie, “Crossroads” 7). While significant formal and cultural distinctions exist between Vizenor’s and Alexie’s writing, they at times fall in the same place politically on Owens’s contemporary Indian spectrum. If we shift our focus from the spectrum model of politics and approach Vizenor’s and Alexie’s writing as full of arrays that both diverge and meet, however, we would produce an interpretation that more precisely conveys how their work takes, rejects, and explores a range of political positions for our consideration. Vizenor’s writing on Thomas James White Hawk in 1968 and Alexie’s 1996 novel Indian Killer, for example, approach the same political issues, especially assimilation, within the context of homicides committed—­or alleged to have been committed—­by Native people, and Vizenor’s reporting in the early 1970s on the American Indian Movement includes representations of activists and concerns about their tactics that align closely with Alexie’s representation of Native activists in Flight (2007).21 This discussion provides the final example of the way literary scholars elide the political diversity within single literary texts and among a single author’s various publications and obscure the political continuities among the works of Native writers, even ones as ostensibly distinct as Vizenor and Alexie. To draw a coherent picture of a Native writer’s politics—­of any writer’s politics—­requires isolating and emphasizing parts of texts and ignoring others and selectively organizing historical and cultural contexts to produce a convincing and compelling background. How might our view of the political array generated by Erdrich in the mid-­ 1980s change if we take into consideration “A Time for Human Rights on Native Ground,” an editorial in the New York Times published on December 29, 2000, on the anniversary of the massacre at Wounded Knee, in which she announces her “political leanings were all surface, consisting mainly of fashion statements” at the time of the Peltier trial (“A Time”). She also reveals that, following the trial, she was “ambivalent about Mr. Peltier and the attendant posturing of other leaders of the American Indian Movement” (“A Time”). While “not persuaded of his innocence,” Erdrich explains, “I was positive that on the basis of what I’d heard in court that there was reasonable doubt as to his guilt and that he should not have been convicted” (“A Time”). The publication of The Round House (2012), a National Book Award winner directly engaged with conversations about the Violence against Women Act (VAWA), as well as her New York Times opinion piece “Rape on the Reservation” on\n\n- 24 -\n\nIntroduction\n\nFebruary 26, 2013, makes situating Erdrich as a politically conservative writer quite the challenge. David Treuer’s still recent critique of Erdrich’s “syntactical concessions” in her use of Anishinabemowin in The Antelope Wife (1998) and other novels, however, serves as a reminder that very few if any Native writers will pass every litmus test of their insurgent credentials (Treuer, Native American Fiction, 60). As this book argues, critics in Native literary studies might productively bring these challenging political moments into conversation in an effort to demonstrate the full richness of the politics in American Indian literary history and Indigenous communities and to derive from that conversation ideas about how best to confront enduring, deeply entrenched settler–­colonial states.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nIndigenous Editing Gertrude Bonnin, Lee Harkins, and American Indian Periodicals As multimedia forms with distinct voices appearing alongside each other in every issue, periodicals often contain wonderfully rich political arrays. When under the control of Native publishers, editors, and writers, they provide an especially diverse range of political views within and among American Indian communities.1 This study begins with a reading of the political arrays in two American Indian periodicals, one national and the other local. They circulated during an era with a political landscape that Native literary studies scholars tend to overgeneralize as produced primarily by a small group of boarding school graduates committed to assimilation. Many Native writers and intellectuals of this period considered assimilation as one strategy to manage and survive the struggle for and conflict over power in a settler–­colonial context. However, debate always existed over what assimilation meant for Indigenous communities, present and future, and writers and intellectuals might give way in one arena (e.g., educational or economic) while holding firm in another (e.g., political, legal, or religious). They also changed their minds throughout their careers and adopted more or less progressive positions as they assessed new challenges. In addition, at times they expressed—­or, in the case of Indigenous editors of periodicals—­helped circulate, anti-­settler-­colonial political views. The polyvocality of these periodicals makes them ideal texts to demonstrate the concept of political arrays as a hermeneutic that illuminates the careful maneuvering of American Indian writers through always deeply vexed political contexts. American Indians already had a long history of printing newspapers and periodicals, as Daniel F. Littlefield Jr. and James W. Parins have documented, by the time the Society of American Indians (SAI) published the first issue of its quarterly journal on April 15, 1913. These periodicals contain a rich and undertapped reserve of Native writing and political\n\n- 25 -\n\n- 26 -\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\nperspectives. A few, such as the Cherokee Phoenix, make irregular appearances in scholarship, and literary scholars have examined the work of a handful of writers, such as John Milton Oskison (Cherokee), Alexander Posey (Creek), and Will Rogers (Cherokee), who published in newspapers and magazines.2 Robert Dale Parker’s Changing Is Not Vanishing: A Collection of American Indian Poetry to 1930 (2011), which contains the work of eighty-­t wo Native poets and information on approximately sixty more, demonstrates the extent of unexamined Native writing in periodicals. Parker observes, “Most of the poems in this collection come from newspapers and magazines, not from books of poetry,” and he comments on a “vast quantity of forgotten early American Indian fiction” uncovered in his research (7). In addition to poetry and fiction, periodicals contain editorials and other opinion pieces, biographies, legends, letters, short histories, personal testimonies, and examples of humor by Native writers. Indigenous editors, such as Carlos Montezuma (Wassaja, 1916–­ 22), Marie Mason Potts (Smoke Signal, 1948–­78), Howard Uyagaq Rock (The Tundra Times, 1962–­97), Jeannette Henry (The Indian Historian / Wassaja, 1967–­80), and Tim Giago (Lakota Times / Indian Country Today, 1981–­92; 1992–­98), also controlled the content of and therefore shaped the political debates in their periodicals.3 Gertrude Bonnin and Lee F. Harkins, as the editors of the American Indian Magazine (1915–­19; formerly the Quarterly Journal of the Society of American Indians), and the American Indian (1926–­31), respectively, published a wide range of Native voices and political perspectives. Bonnin approached editorial work as an extension of her community and political activism, in which she had been involved, most extensively with the Northern Utes on the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in Utah, for many years before joining the Society of American Indians. She differed from her friend and predecessor, Arthur C. Parker (Seneca), in exercising a less imperious editorial practice that allowed for a greater diversity of Indigenous political views.4 At the age of twenty-­ eight, Harkins became the founding coeditor of the American Indian after studying journalism at the University of Oklahoma and working on several newspapers.5 With the help of exclusively or almost exclusively Native editorial boards, Bonnin and Harkins used their magazines to make claims about Indigenous pasts, presents, and futures in tribal-­nation-­specific, pantribal, intertribal, trans-­Indigenous, transnational, and settler–­colonial contexts. They constructed a narrative\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\n- 27 -\n\nof Indigenous America culturally, historically, and politically distinct in content, if not always in form, from dominant beliefs about what Indigenous Americans had been (childlike, primitive, savage), currently were (still benighted, incompetent government wards unworthy of citizenship) and would become (indistinguishable from European Americans). At the same time, these dominant views appeared in both magazines, especially in Harkins’s, making generalizations about their political commitments difficult. Bonnin and Harkins worked as editors in the later years of an era, 1877–­1934, in which federal policies of assimilation targeted Native land as well as Native social, political, and cultural structures and practices and, therefore, radically compromised many sites of potential protest.6 At the same time, to advocate for assimilation into the settler–­ colonial state meant taking a progressive position against segregation and certain forms of institutional racism, if not necessarily against the deep-­rooted ideology of European and Anglo American superiority that informed the progressive as much as the reactionary position in the debates over Indigenous futures. While their periodicals promote this progressive agenda—­national belonging for American Indians in the United States within a cultural context overwhelmingly defined by capitalism, Christianity, and representative democracy—­and express varying degrees of condescension toward or rejection of Indigenous cultural beliefs and practices, this agenda is neither consistent nor monolithic. These periodicals also contain assertions of the rights of self-­determination and self-­representation as well as, for example, celebrations of resistance fighters and condemnations of non-­Native depredations. Political emphases shift within and between issues, in some cases on the same page and in a rather jarring fashion. The periodicals contain, in other words, arrays of Indigenous political views circulating through the urgent conversations orchestrated by the editors and authors about indigeneity in the 1910s and 1920s in the United States.\n\nGertrude Bonnin’s Activist Editing at the American Indian Magazine, 1915–­19 Bonnin’s literary reputation rests primarily on her work in the years 1900–­1902, when Bonnin, in her midtwenties and under the self-­g iven Lakota name Zitkala-­ Ša (Red Bird), published articles in Harper’s Magazine, Atlantic Monthly, and Everybody’s Magazine and a collection\n\n- 28 -\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\nof ohunkakan titled Old Indian Legends (1901).7 The articles were collected and published twenty years later as American Indian Stories (1921). Literary scholars have assessed Bonnin’s work by focusing their attention on this three-­year period of literary production that preceded her conversion to Catholicism, her role as an activist and public intellectual in the SAI, and her campaign against peyote with other prominent Native intellectuals, including Arthur C. Parker and Charles Alexander Eastman (Mdewakanton Dakota), and General Richard Henry Pratt, the non-­Native founder of Carlisle Indian Industrial School. The “old legends” and “stories” tell only a small part of Bonnin’s history. From 1915 to 1919, Bonnin was also a contributing editor and, for four issues, the editor general of the SAI’s magazine. A consideration of her service as an editor provides the opportunity to review her fiction and autobiographical essays within a broader political and intellectual context, and the expanded focus on her entire career as author and activist illustrates that her relationship to both Native and non-­Native cultural and intellectual traditions was a constant negotiation characterized by many shifts between acceptance of, resistance to, and compromise with those traditions. In many camps and, simultaneously, in a camp all her own, Bonnin participated in an array of divergent political scenes and networks. She moved between coalitions and alliances, western and eastern states, and tribal nations and pan-­Indian communities, in a career as activist and writer that continued until her death. Any attempt to characterize Bonnin as consistently defying or accommodating a single political position obscures the diverse strategic views she adopted throughout her career in her search for a viable future for American Indians in the United States. While her own writing and activism constitute a remarkably nuanced political array—­like, as Kirby Brown demonstrates, Ruth Muskrat Bronson’s—­the first part of this chapter focuses on the arrays she generates through her work as an editor of the American Indian Magazine. Bonnin worked as an editor near the end of the first of four major periods, as categorized by Robert Warrior, for public Native intellectuals in the twentieth century. During the first of these four periods, which for the purposes of Warrior’s study runs from 1890 to 1916, prominent Native intellectuals such as Eastman and Montezuma (Apache) helped form the SAI. The members of the SAI, Warrior explains, were part of a generation “faced with the prospect of total dispossession if Natives\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\n- 29 -\n\ncontinued to resist the U.S. government” (7), and their efforts to organize represented “the first coming together of Native intellectuals in a specific political project” (10). In her study of Bonnin and three other major Indigenous intellectuals of this period, Kiara Vigil describes this “coming together” as occurring variously within social, intellectual, political, and cultural networks. While scholars have understood the SAI’s project primarily as integrationist and assimilationist, as Vigil observes and challenges, the history of the organization’s magazine, called first the Quarterly Journal of the Society of American Indians and then the American Indian Magazine, reveals a lively public discussion among American Indians about what integration and assimilation meant.8 In particular, the accommodationist tone of the early issues shifted substantially when, in 1918, the year Carlisle closed as an Indian boarding school and the Native American Church incorporated in Oklahoma, Bonnin became the editor for four of the final five issues. Bonnin addressed a set of concerns shared by most Native intellectuals at the time: education, religious worship, literary self-­representation, political self-­determination, treaty rights, sovereignty, the legal status of Native Americans, the social and cultural status of Native women, and the social and cultural disruption of Native lives. She understood this disruption as the direct result of the Indian boarding school system, the government-­ward status of most American Indians, the dictatorship of a corrupt Office of Indian Affairs (OIA), the reservation system, and peyote use. Bonnin’s life, spent almost entirely in the era in which the federal government aggressively enforced assimilation as its official policy, spanned a series of often abrupt changes in Indian Country that helped define the historical context in which she addressed these issues. She was born in 1876, the year that Lakota and Cheyenne warriors under the command of the Hunkpapa Lakota leader Sitting Bull defeated General George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Greasy Grass.9 The military victory over invading U.S. troops did not lead to future successes for Indigenous communities on the plains or for the many bands of the Dakotas, including Bonnin’s own people on the Yankton Reservation.10 The assassination the following summer of the Oglala Lakota leader Crazy Horse and, in 1890, the assassination of Sitting Bull and the massacre of Big Foot’s band of Minneconjou Lakotas at Wounded Knee discouraged continued military resistance on the plains.\n\n- 30 -\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\nBonnin experienced firsthand the federal government’s assimilation policy as a student at missionary and boarding schools—­a bilingual Presbyterian school at Yankton; the Quaker-­r un White’s Manual Labor Institute in Wabash, Indiana; Santee Normal Training School, founded by the Reverend Alfred Riggs in Santee, Nebraska—­a nd as a teacher at Carlisle.11 She witnessed the height of Dakota participation in the Ghost Dance; the suppression of traditional Native religious practices, such as the Sun Dance on the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, where she spent fourteen years; and the creation of the Native American Church.12 She also defended in print her “pagan” beliefs, then converted to Catholicism.13 In the legislative arena, Congress passed both the Manypenny Agreement, which in 1877 claimed the Black Hills for the United States and reinforced Dakota dependence on the federal government, and the General Allotment Act, which instituted a policy that continued until 1934 of allotting tribal lands to families and individuals. Native Americans continued to face various challenges to efforts at self-­representation during this era. The Wild West shows, in which Sitting Bull participated, gained international popularity, while non-­Native scholars and “friends of the Indian” reform organizations dominated by non-­Natives continued to have a significant influence on the ways in which the general public viewed Indigenous people. The reform organizations also influenced federal policy. Immediately prior to the granting of citizenship to all Native Americans in 1924, Bonnin investigated the Osage Reign of Terror, during which non-­Natives murdered Osages for their oil headrights, and she saw the publication in 1928 of the Meriam Report, which contributed substantially to a reform of Indian policy that became the Indian New Deal.14 Before Bonnin died in 1938, the administration of John Collier began at the OIA, and, in 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act or Wheeler–­Howard Act, which, Standing Rock Dakota author Vine Deloria Jr. writes, “gave the reservations their first taste of self-­government in nearly half a century” (Custer, 55).15 This brief history should suggest neither unremitting disaster nor a life that ended at a point of clear reversal of the U.S. government’s policies of assimilation, treaty abrogation, land seizure, and cultural warfare. As a Native intellectual and community activist throughout her life, Bonnin actively engaged in this tumultuous history that shaped her writing and editorial work.\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\n- 31 -\n\nNegotiating with the Civilizing Machine, 1900–­1915 Two critical readings of Zitkala-­Ša’s work during the three years she published in mainstream magazines tend to dominate the scholarship on her. Scholars have an interest in her subversion of sentimental literary modes and in the ways in which her Atlantic Monthly essays overtly defy the federal government’s assimilation program in the Indian boarding schools. These articles assess Zitkala-­Ša in reference to Anglo women authors, with the exception of P. Jane Hafen (Taos Pueblo), who in “Zitkala Ša: Sentimentality and Sovereignty” situates Zitkala-­ Ša’s work within the context of her commitment to tribal sovereignty, and Dorothea Susag, whose article “Zitkala-­Sa (Gertrude Simmons Bonnin)” traces Zitkala-­Ša’s Native language and culture in the autobiographical essays.16 More recently, Bonnin’s biographer, Tadeusz Lewandowski, calls these essays “ ‘a political autobiography’ of sorts” (37). Generally, scholars view Zitkala-­Ša’s Old Indian Legends as an affirmation of Dakota culture and a subversive critique of colonialism. Jeanne Smith reads Old Indian Legends from a more specifically Native critical position by explaining the ways in which “Zitkala-­Ša explores both the enabling and the destructive potential of the trickster for the future of her culture” (47). These articles contribute to our understanding of Zitkala-­Ša within a contemporary critical context in which finding politically insurgent material in the work of marginalized authors is a common project. Zitkala-­Ša’s rejection of assimilation, of the violence of the “civilizing machine,” helps establish her reputation as, at least during this time of her life, an anti-assimilationist (Bonnin, American Indian Stories, 66). In the final line of her series of three essays about her experience as a student and teacher, she writes, “Few there are who have paused to question whether real life or long-­lasting death lies beneath this semblance of civilization” (99). Following her two years as a teacher at Carlisle, Bonnin intended to collect stories at Yankton in an effort of cultural affirmation that would have directly challenged her boarding school experiences. Bonnin’s literary career does not end with the publication of the legends and stories, her marriage at Yankton in 1902 to Captain Raymond T. Bonnin (Yankton Dakota), and her subsequent move to Utah. In addition to publishing poems in the SAI’s periodical, Bonnin collaborated in 1913 with William F. Hanson, a music professor at Brigham Young\n\n- 32 -\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\nUniversity, on The Sun Dance Opera.17 The opera negotiates Native and non-­Native cultural traditions in order to validate Native lives and beliefs within the context of a medium of creative expression privileged by the majority culture and, as Katherine Evans demonstrates, within the context of a particular kind of Native stage performance in the final two decades of the nineteenth century and first two decades of the twentieth.18 Hafen observes, “The Sun Dance Opera reveals the sometimes turbulent cultural waters that Bonnin navigated in her life. Often she seemed caught between validating her indigenous beliefs and seeking public approval” (Dreams, xx). The performance of a religious ritual in a Western medium and for a mostly non-­Native audience would have made the opera controversial even in the second decade of the twentieth century; this kind of public display of Indigenous religious practice frequently falls under scrutiny in early-­t wenty-­first-­century Native intellectual contexts. In Manifest Manners (1999), Gerald Vizenor comments on what he calls “the consumer sun dances” that for some members of the American Indian Movement became a performance of resistance rather than a serious spiritual ceremony (154). The consumer sun dances are also popular with “wannabes,” non-­Native cultural tourists who make playing Indian a weekend hobby.19 Religious ceremony in a nonreligious context—­on a theater stage, in front of television cameras, or for the benefit of tourists—­no longer qualifies as a religious ceremony, Vizenor argues. Though Bonnin and Hanson left places in the opera for the performance of Native songs and dances, the possibility of the exploitation of Native peoples and cultures might have troubled her future colleagues in the SAI, particularly Chauncey Yellow Robe (Sicangu Lakota), who contributed an article censuring Wild West shows to the magazine.20 The Sun Dance Opera relies on a sentimental plot with a male villain, Sweet Singer, and two women under duress, the abandoned Shoshone Maid and Winona; Winona loves Ohiya but must contend with Sweet Singer’s unwanted courtship. Contemporary Native scholars such as Craig Womack and Elizabeth Cook-­Lynn suggest that aesthetic success or failure might be less important for assessing the value of the opera to Native communities than the fact that Bonnin fashions a response to colonial incursions into Indian Country—­in this case, the suppression of the Sun Dance in Utah. Indeed, Lewandowski argues for the opera’s subversive “political dimensions” (88). This theatrical perfor-\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\n- 33 -\n\nmance of the Sun Dance also functions as a refusal either to capitulate to the majority culture’s aesthetic expectations or to surrender a tribal worldview.21 Vizenor’s observations on Luther Standing Bear (Oglala Lakota), the author, actor, teacher, and activist whose shifting challenges to and accommodations of the majority culture parallel Bonnin’s, apply equally well to Bonnin’s pre-­SAI work.22 In Manifest Manners, Vizenor identifies Standing Bear as his first example of a post-­Indian warrior and asserts, “The postindian warriors encounter their enemies with the same courage in literature as their ancestors once evinced on horses, and they create their stories with a new sense of survivance. The warriors bear the simulations of their time and counter the manifest manners of domination” (4). Zitkala-­Ša performs similar acts of courage in her early writing, as she works in her stories toward survival and resistance—­or, to use Vizenor’s term, survivance—­and she counters the domination of her culture and people by making strategic forays into the enemy’s territory: sentimental literature, opera.23 The opera is the only creative work Bonnin made public during her fourteen years in Utah, where her work in the community of Uintah-­Ouray eventually led to her membership in the SAI and a national presence in American Indian politics.\n\nLiberating the “Little Peoples,” 1915–­19 The SAI originated at a meeting organized by Fayette A. McKenzie, a professor of economics and sociology, in April 1911 at Ohio State University.24 McKenzie invited to campus a group of “progressives,” American Indians who desired a reform organization run by American Indians and who, Hazel Hertzberg explains, “believed in education, hard work, and in adapting their attitudes, values, and habits of life to those of the larger American society” (31).25 The organization began publishing the Quarterly Journal of the Society of American Indians in 1913, with Arthur C. Parker as the editor. In his discussion of the early years of the journal, Gregory Smithers identifies “education and citizenship,” specifically birthright citizenship, as the primary political concerns of Parker and the contributing authors (265). He also highlights Parker’s determination to keep the journal independent from the federal government, advertisers, and non-­Native reform organizations while refining “the journal’s message of uplift, self-­help, and race-­pride”\n\n- 34 -\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\n(276). Smithers asserts that to Parker and many other Native Americans at the time, “ ‘assimilation’ in the context of education and political activism meant giving Native Americans the cultural, linguistic, and civic foundations upon which to rise from ‘tribalism’ and unite to awaken the Indian ‘soul.’ To Indigenous readers of the journal, the invocation of the ‘soul’ bespoke a commitment to ‘traditional’ beliefs and cultural practices” (277). By situating “assimilation” within the context of Native political and cultural discourses in the second decade of the twentieth century, Smithers establishes a historically specific working definition of one of the key terms governing the discussion of any political array in Native American literary history. Parker, a great-­nephew of General Ely S. Parker, the author of the surrender ending the Civil War and the first American Indian to serve as commissioner of the OIA, edited the magazine during its first five and a half years of publication.26 In his editorials, Parker insists that the responsibility for solving the “Indian problem” rests with Indigenous people, who need to “awaken” and “improve” themselves. As Smithers explains, the magazine took the editorial position that Native traditionalists “should be divested of their local political power and cultural influence” in order to make this awakening and improving possible (Smithers, 265). This observation about the journal’s politics exists in uncomfortable tension with Smithers’s working definition of assimilation, and it suggests that readers of the journal under Parker would have heard mixed messages about their beliefs and ceremonies. Parker’s other interests included equal access to all levels of education and U.S. citizenship for all Native people. He also advocated for the creation of a court of claims specifically for American Indians, a codification of the laws and policies that applied to American Indians, and the gradual termination of the OIA. Most urgently, he believed in the value of the SAI as a pan-­Indian community and as a group of American Indians determining their own future, and he protected the SAI by demanding loyalty to the organization and struggling vigorously to obviate any factionalism. Bonnin became an editor during Parker’s tenure, and her editorial work establishes a political array with his vision for the magazine and his ideas about the future of American Indians. She did not as readily forgive attacks on Native Americans. She also more stridently condemned injustice and corruption and more directly pursued the resolution of local, tribal nation grievances rather than focusing on the\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\n- 35 -\n\norganization’s national platform. The magazine’s content, whether or not authored by Bonnin, became less conciliatory but more romanticized. As editor, Bonnin also foregrounded her interests in literature and community activism. In terms of policy, she used her position as editor to publicize her antipeyote stance, which developed in response to some appalling events at Uintah and Ouray.27 Finally, in the issues she edited, Bonnin gave a more prominent position to the Native and non-­Native women who played a role in local, national, and global affairs. An overall assessment of her editorial work suggests that she understood editing as a continuation of her role as an activist invested in the future of Native communities. However, as in her literary production, her editorial work neither consistently resisted nor consistently accommodated non-­Native attempts to compromise, assault, or annihilate those same Native communities. Parker’s voice dominates the magazine beginning with the first issue in January–­April 1913. Though the initially all-­male editorial board included influential thinkers and writers such as Montezuma and Oskison, Parker appears to have solely authored the frequently long editorials (twenty or more pages) that begin each issue. Parker establishes the political position of the magazine by focusing his editorials on the “uplift” of the race and its necessary assimilation into the society and culture of the United States. He claims in the “Editorial Comment” in the first issue that the aim of the all-­Native organization is “to place the race in the position of a constructing, producing factor in civilization” (7). Along with many of the writers published in the magazine, Parker saw education as the key to uplifting the race. By education, he did not mean the limited curriculum at Indian boarding schools but the formalized Western education to which many non-­Natives had greater access. The vocational education of the boarding schools, in the SAI’s opinion, inadequately prepared American Indians to compete in a world largely controlled by non-­Natives. Parker wanted access to more Western education. Parker develops a defensive, apologetic, and paternalistic argument for assimilation. In the April–­June 1913 issue, he opines, “The fundamental principle of Americanism since its earliest beginning has been to produce a uniform civilization. The base of that civilization, better termed ethnic culture, was and is English” (“The Editor’s Viewpoint,” 104). He continues by discussing a hypothetical immigrant from\n\n- 36 -\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\nFinland: “Later, as he became acculturated, he might return to a consideration of the ways of his fathers and seek to commemorate them, but purely as a matter of racial pride or patriotic interest, and not as something to be revived and made again an active culture to be lived and followed” (104). Parker assures his audience that American Indians have little interest in remaining Indians. Following complete assimilation, he suggests, they will identify as Indigenous biologically or historically but not culturally or politically. In this second editorial, in a section subtitled “The Social Tyranny of Tribal Life,” Parker even distances himself rhetorically from “the Indian people”: It is not difficult to see why the student carefully educated, trained and taught in all the ways of civilized life does not prosper as he should normally in normal communities when he returns to the reservation. He alone can not always compel all the rest of the community to see that he is right and that they are wrong. . . . This brings to the proposition, then, that to bring about the civilization we desire to the Indian people, where they are, we must make the social life of the reservation the same as that found in communities we are pleased to call civilized. (108)\n\nParker views Anglo culture as normative, and he sees no future for American Indians in the distinct cultural and political worlds on reservations. The SAI advocated for the settlement of land claims, but not in order to strengthen reservation communities. Instead, the SAI wanted the Department of the Interior to allow “competent” American Indians to control individual allotments.28 Throughout his tenure as editor, Parker qualifies his theories of assimilation and race relations by drawing contrasts between American Indians and African Americans or recent groups of immigrants, for example, but he steadfastly maintains his focus on the issues important to him and the SAI. Direct criticism of Anglo settlers, Indian agents, and other government officials occurs more frequently with each issue, both in his own editorials and in the articles. Parker delivers his strongest reproach to Europe while discussing World War I. In the January–­March 1917 editorial, he wonders if “the civilization of which the European has boasted is after all a defective thing” (8). But several issues later, he returns to commenting upon the ignorance and superstition of “savage\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\n- 37 -\n\ntribes” and insisting that complete loyalty to the United States is the only hope for American Indians (“Editorials,” 7). Fearful of creating factions within and political difficulties outside the organization, Parker attempted to avoid controversy by adhering tenaciously to the organization’s political platform.29 As soon as she became a contributing editor in the October–­ December 1915 issue, the last under the title Quarterly Journal of the Society of American Indians, Bonnin made her first appearance in its pages as a community organizer and activist. Her presence as a contributing editor did not lead to changes in the magazine’s format and content, with the exception of the promotion of her community-­center project and the publication of her poems. When he first mentions Bonnin, Parker uses her as an example of those Native people who have benefited from education in non-­Native schools. The next two references to her reveal Bonnin’s interest in publicizing her community work at Uintah–­ Ouray. In a section devoted to the SAI’s Fifth Annual Conference, held in Lawrence, Kansas, the editors note that the community center exemplifies what American Indians can do to help themselves. Regardless of Bonnin’s own ideas about the role of the center, the editors interpret her work according to the SAI’s platform of American Indian self-­help. Bonnin describes the community center from her own perspective in the same issue in “A Christmas Letter from Zit-­kal-­a-­sa: Describes Her Community Improvement Work among the Utes.” She expresses a primary concern for the welfare of the community’s women elders, for whom the community center sewing class made some garments, though Bonnin also requested that the women pay for the materials used. The sewing class also began serving lunch to Utes who came to the agency for the Monday disbursal of government checks. Prior to the intervention of the sewing class, the underpaid Native government employees at the agency faced an overwhelming number of requests for hospitality. The remainder of the letter describes what soon became her well-­k nown opposition to peyote, which she had already started to oppose publicly. In her discussion of peyote, Bonnin most closely approximates Parker’s patronizing tone toward American Indians on reservations: she describes the Utes as “easy victims because of their ignorance, superstitions and degradation” (“A Christmas Letter,” 324). She has, she notes, asked a state senator, a Mr. Colton, to join the SAI as an associate\n\n- 38 -\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\nmember and to help with legislation to prohibit the importing of peyote into Utah. Bonnin viewed her antipeyote position as intimately connected to her community-­center work. Her article “Chipeta, Widow of Chief Ouray, with a Word about a Deal in Blankets” appears in the July–­ September 1917 issue, following Ouray’s obituary. The inclusion of the obituary establishes the context for the antipeyote statement. First, Bonnin assures her readers that both Ouray and Chipeta befriended and even defended white settlers. Then she describes her visit to Chipeta to warn her of the destructive effects of peyote. Bonnin believes that neither Chipeta nor her brother, McCook, will stop using peyote because the government has not told them that, like liquor, peyote is unhealthy. After she criticizes the government’s attempt to honor Ouray’s widow with a gift of two trading-­store shawls that they require the Ute tribe, and therefore Chipeta, to purchase, Bonnin constructs Chipeta as an infantile and abused loyalist to the government and an uninformed abuser of peyote. As in her previous statements against peyote use, Bonnin uses the conventional social reform discourses of Native inferiority and helplessness. Her use of this discourse advances her political interest in prohibiting the use of peyote but undermines other attempts to demonstrate the strength of Native women. She concludes her article by explaining that water rights, title to Ute land, or a letter from the government against peyote use would have been better gifts than two shawls. This conclusion contains what we might call a microarray: a demand for sovereignty (water rights, land claims) but also a request for colonial imposition (prohibition of Native religious practices). Bonnin sees an American Indian future with self-­determination in terms of ownership and control of the land but without peyote use, which she believed threatened the ability to own and control the land wisely. Bonnin’s literary contributions to the magazine during her tenure on the editorial board promote the SAI’s stated goals, though occasionally they hint at challenging Parker’s more conciliatory position. “The Red Man’s America” offers revised lyrics to “My Country ’Tis of Thee” that change the song into a request for citizenship and voting rights and an overt demand for the passage of bills that would abolish a corrupt Indian Office and criminalize peyote use. “A Sioux Woman’s Love for Her Grandmother” appears in what came to be known as the “Sioux\n\nIndigenous Editing\n\n- 39 -\n\nNumber” in October–­December 1917. In the poem, set just prior to the Battle of the Greasy Grass, Bonnin focuses on the relationships between women as constitutive of Native community: a grandmother, defying Custer’s troops, remains behind to wait for her lost granddaughter as her community retreats. “The Indian’s Awakening” is Bonnin’s most politically nuanced literary contribution. The title draws on one of the most familiar words in "
