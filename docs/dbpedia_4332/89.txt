Jockey Sandy Hawley was hoping for post position No. 5, which is his lucky number and not a bad place to start in Saturday’s $2-million Breeders’ Cup Turf. Hawley would have even settled for the seven hole, which is his wife Lisa’s lucky number.

But post-position draws frequently don’t go the way horsemen want them to, and Wednesday, when entries were taken for Saturday’s seven-race, $11-million day at Woodbine, there were mixed results as 85 horses were named to run. In the 1 1/2-mile Turf, for example, Hawley’s horse, Chief Bearhart, drew the No. 12 post in a field of 14. Chief Bearhart, who finished second to Singspiel, one of the Turf favorites, at Woodbine a month ago, is a colt who likes to run behind the first flight of horses in the early going, but now Hawley fears that he might get fanned out in the 515-foot run to the first turn.

To win, Chief Bearhart will have to do what Northern Spur, Kotashaan, Miss Alleged, Pebbles and Theatrical did: Win the Turf after breaking from outside the No. 11 post. Singspiel, part of Sheik Mohammed’s four-horse entry, drew No. 10 and is the 9-5 favorite.

“If we beat Singspiel, I think we can win the race,” said Hawley, who was two lengths behind the sheik’s colt in the 1 1/2-mile Canadian International. Chief Bearhart, who has run seven of his nine races at Woodbine, is 12-1.

Not unexpectedly, the shortest-priced Breeders’ Cup horse is Cigar, who will open at 4-5 and break from the No. 7 post in the $4-million Classic, which has drawn a capacity field of 14.

Also predictable was that Ricks Natural Star, the refugee gelding from New Mexico, would be the highest-priced horse. In what might be an unprecedented line, Jim Bannon, the oddsmaker at Woodbine, made Ricks Natural Star 99-1 in the Turf. Linemakers usually give the worst horse in any race a courtesy 30-1 number, but Ricks Natural Star has won only two of 23 starts in the cheapest company and hasn’t raced in 14 months. The motley-looking 7-year-old was allowed to enter only after an inspection by a team of veterinarians and a grilling of his owner-trainer, William Livingston, by the three Woodbine stewards. Ricks Natural Star is a threat--a threat to break the Breeders’ Cup record held by Hot Number, who was 212-1 when he finished next to last in the 1993 Juvenile.

Cigar, trying to become the first horse to win the Classic twice, was flown to Toronto on Wednesday afternoon, after working four furlongs in 48 1/5 seconds at Belmont Park. His rivals include Yanks Music, a 3-year-old filly, and the Richard Mandella-trained entry of Dare And Go and Atticus, who are coupled for betting purposes at 6-1. Dare And Go beat Cigar in August in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar, ending a 16-race winning streak by trainer Bill Mott’s horse.

“He was sharp,” Mott said of Cigar’s last pre-Classic workout. “He was up on the bridle. He was anxious. The main thing is that he comes back good and looks good [Thursday]. We are trying to do everything right. We don’t want to make any mistakes, and we feel good about what we have done so far.”

Skip Away, who beat Cigar on Oct. 5 in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont, would have been a shorter price than the Dare And Go-Atticus entry, but he isn’t running. Owner Carolyn Hine and her husband, Sonny, who trains Skip Away, declined to pay a $480,000 supplementary entry fee that was needed to make their colt eligible.

Hawley, 47, doesn’t have a mount in the Classic, but he will ride Runaway Mary, a longshot in the $1-million Juvenile Fillies, which will be the first Breeders’ Cup race on the card. Hawley is an icon in Canada, having won four Queens Plates in the 1970s and, by his count, having ridden about half of his 6,400 wins at Woodbine. Hawley rode successfully in Southern California for a decade before he returned home in 1988 for the latest chapter in his Hall of Fame career.

“I rode my first winner right here,” Hawley said Wednesday in Woodbine’s track kitchen. “A colt named Fly Along, in 1968. He was my sixth mount. I know it was the sixth, because the rule was that you couldn’t use a whip the first five races you rode, and that was my first race with the stick.”

With more than 80 wins, Hawley ranks fifth in the jockey standings this season at Woodbine. He makes an annual winter pilgrimage to California, where he rides a few horses at Santa Anita, works as the off-ice official at Kings’ games and undergoes treatment for a skin cancer that he has been battling for 10 years.

“It’s a melanoma, and it was life-threatening,” Hawley said. “They seem to have it under control now. I had two major surgeries, and I go to California because it’s one of the few places where you can get these booster shots that I need. I get one shot a week for five straight weeks, and there are no side effects.”

Hawley’s agent, Mike Langlais, hands out business cards with the jockey’s weight of 107 pounds imprinted. “We don’t have to worry about printing up new cards,” Hawley said. “I’ve been that weight for a long time.”

Consequently, his horses Saturday will carry a lot of what is called “dead weight”--pads with lead that horses wear under their saddles. Chief Bearhart, for instance, will carry 14 pounds of lead, bringing his impost to the required 121 pounds.

Hawley is winless with eight Breeders’ Cup mounts. The best Breeders’ Cup horse he has ridden, Dance Smartly, was third in the 1990 Juvenile Fillies, then won the 1991 Distaff when she was ridden by Pat Day. Dance Smartly went on to earn $3.2 million, a North American record for a female that could be broken by Serena’s Song in Saturday’s Distaff.

Hawley is still in awe at the talent the Breeders’ Cup assembles. “I look at the Racing Form,” he said, “and it’s just amazing. All those horses, all those riders.”

Maybe it will strike Hawley some day that he’s one of them.

Horse Racing Notes

Lisa McFarland, an apprentice at Woodbine, was named at entry time to ride Ricks Natural Star. She replaces Sally Williams, a Remington Park jockey who had worked the horse there last week. Owner-trainer William Livingston said Williams isn’t riding because she couldn’t be at Woodbine today for a workout. Williams was quoted in the Daily Racing Form as saying that Ricks Natural Star “[wasn’t] ready for a race.” . . . Trainer Wayne Lukas has 10 Breeders’ Cup starters, including favored Honour And Glory in the Sprint. Other favorites are Storm Song in the Juvenile Fillies, Different in the Distaff, the entry of Mark Of Esteem and Charnwood Forest in the Mile and Ordway in the Juvenile. . . . There was intermittent rain Wednesday. Scattered showers are forecast today, with no rain expected Friday or Saturday. Temperatures are expected to reach the high 50s Saturday.
