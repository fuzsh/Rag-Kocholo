Fred grew up in South Salem NY, living across from “his girl next door”, Alice, who later became his wife of 59 years and together made an ever growing family rich with tradition. Just shy of celebrating their 60th anniversary in August 2008, Alice passed away. As his time grew shorter, he remained\n\ncontent. “I had a good run” he said, referring to all his accomplishments, including serving in the merchant marines at the helm of oil tankers sailing through the Gulf of Mexico, his career as an Arborist climbing trees, working a full career and retiring from the town of Lewisboro Highway Dept., then spending retirement working part time at Waccubuc Country Club and with his family. In Fred’s youth, he enjoyed playing varsity football and his love of motorcycle riding never left his blood. He played harmonica and accordion in a family band and also just recently with the senior citizens at Founders Hall. He would play for anyone just to make them smile. He could always be heard recounting his many life stories with family and friends. Fred lives on through\n\nhis son Michael, his daughter Paula, and their spouses, Jan and Tony. He had close In-laws including Margaret and Herb Norton and their family, also Fred’s brother Ralph and sister Evelyn, and many nieces, nephews, and cousins most still living in the area. He felt blessed having lived to enjoy his 4 grandchildren grow up and give him 7 Great-Grandchildren from 9 months up to 18 years old. Fred felt comforted in his final hours being surrounded by his family and knowing he was “going to be with Grandma again.”\n\nFamily will receive friends on Wednesday, September 3, 2104 at Clark Associates Funeral Home, Katonah, NY from 2 to 4 and 7 to 9pm.
