The killing occurred beside the Galena Lumber Company office on the corner of Fourth and Everett streets to which point he had enticed her on the plea of seeing their children, whom he said were at the Beha hotel. The murder and suicide took place at ten minutes of 10 o'clock while the streets were thronged with carnival and fair crowds and was done in sight of hundreds of people. The roaring and popping of automobiles however prevented the shots from being heard and for a few minutes only the eye witnesses were aware of the tragedy. Mrs Blair was shot three times, once while standing and twice after she fell. Blair shot himself twice, Two bullets passed through Mrs Blair's heart and one through Blair's. Mrs Blair lived but a few seconds after she was shot while Blair kicked around about five minutes before he died.\n\nBlair had been drinking and had been having trouble with his wife who it is said came to the county seat to see about obtaining a divorce. Blair purchased a revolver a the Brenan store a short time before the shooting.\n\nSeparate funerals were held at Chambers Saturday and the bodies buried apart.\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBlevins, Douglas F\n\nBorn April 16,1932, Huntington, WV\n\nSon of Daniel and Ida Steele Blevins\n\nMarried Feb 10,1971, Ines Cash Mitchell, London, Ohio\n\nDied April 17,2005 O'Neill\n\nBuried O'Neill Prospect Cem\n\nChildren: Harold, Douglas, Flora Louise\n\nStep children: Joyce Myers\n\nsisters: Lillian Jones,Virginia Roe\n\nbrothers: Clyde, Daniel\n\nUS Army April 27,1951 to March 2,1954\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBlinn, Robert\n\nborn June 1,1916 Atkinson\n\nson of Earl and Mina Johnston Blinn\n\nmarried Lee\n\ndied Feb 14,1999 Norfolk\n\ngraduated Cody HS\n\nchildren: Gazry, Lawnie Conton\n\nsister: Marge Watters\n\nUS Army\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBoelter, Fern M Parks\n\nborn April 27,1918 northeast of Foster\n\ndau of Henry O and Bertha M Ogan Parks\n\nmarried Oct 1,1936, Albert Boelter of Walnut - he died April 11,1984\n\ndied April 7,2008 O'Neill\n\nburied Grimton Cem, Orchard\n\nchildren: Merle, Vernon, Henry, Albert Lee\n\nbrothers: 9\n\nsisters: 5\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBoggs, Darrel Lomis Luzerene\n\nborn Aug 11,1913 O'Neill\n\nson of Isaac Newton and Ina Lorene Stevens Boggs\n\nmarried April 7,1941, Ruth Lyon, Taylor\n\nmarried\n\ndied May 14,2008\n\nchildren: Terry, Warren, Patti Hultgren\n\nsisters: Darrelene McGaughey, Opal\n\nbrothers: Page, Ike\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBogue, Hans Clifton\n\nJuly 24,2008 Atkinson Graphic\n\nborn Oct 18,1905 at Castana, Iowa\n\nson of Hans Nels and Elva Porter Bogue\n\nmarried Sylvia West\n\nmarried Marie Ries on May 31,1928 in Bassett\n\ndied July 19,2008 at Atkinson\n\nburied St Joseph Cem, Atkinson\n\nchildren: Theron\n\ngrandchildren: David; Doug and Dean\n\nsisters: Winnie Hupp, Mary Ellenwood, Elsie Britz, Verdettia O'Connell, Elva Schrader\n\nbrothers: Carl, Sylvester, Cecil, Ross\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBonenberger, Mary\n\nMarch 30,1899 Atkinson Plain Dealer\n\nThe little daughter born to Peter Bonenberger Friday morning only stayed to brighten their home a few short hours and passed on to the great beyond at an early hour Sunday.
