He had been appointed Brigade Sutler in one of the Divisions of the army of the Potomac-and had left home but a few weeks before his death to lay in his stock and commence operations in his new field of labor. From exposure necessarily attendant upon the duties of his position, he contracted a cold, and from inattention, without the means perhaps, of proper attentions, and possessed naturally of a weak constitution, he was brought suddenly and unexpectedly to an untimely grave. Again has arch death robbed the community of a cherished member, his associates of a warm and generous friend, his family of a devoted, loving husband and father. Again we are reminded that in the midst of life, we are in death, and that youth and vigorous manhood can no more with stand his arrows than can decrepit old age.\n\nTo those who knew him best, the virtues of the deceased were more apparent and better appreciated. Of a warm, genial and generous disposition he had secured the friendship of all with whom he was associated, and the love and esteem of those intimately connected with him.\n\nLet us hope, while we mourn his loss and wish that he could have been left with us a while longer, that our loss is his eternal gain, that his death is but a sweet sleep.\n\n\"The good died first,\n\nAnd those whose hearts are dry as Summer's dust\n\nBurn to the socket!\" Com.\n\nThe Genius of Liberty.
