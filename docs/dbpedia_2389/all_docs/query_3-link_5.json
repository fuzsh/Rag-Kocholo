ABBOTT.\n\nHenry Phillips Abbott, late of Allen Township, Washington county, was born in\n\nBrownsville, Fayette County, Pa., October 31, 1835, and was almost instantly killed by a\n\nfall of coal and slate in the Clipper coal mines, near the village of Allenport, Washington\n\ncounty, Pa., on the morning of June 29, 1891. In comemoration of an honored parent we\n\npay this tribute of respect to his memory.\n\nHis early manhood was spent in and near Fayette City, having for a number of years engaged in mining\n\nand before the day of steamboats, in boating coal from the\n\nMonongahela River to southern markets, a business full of variety and which he took a\n\ndelight. Twice previous to the fatal 29th of June, 1891, he was twice carried from the\n\nsame mine badly injured; at one time a leg broken, a second so severly injured in the back\n\nthat fears were entertained for his recovery.\n\nAt the age of 27 years at the country's call for volunteers to preserve the flag from\n\ndishonor, he enlisted under Captain Frank M. Nelson in Company B, 8th Regiment of\n\nInfantry, P.R.C. volunteers, and was enrolled on the 25th day of June, 1861, to serve three years or during the\n\nwar, and was discharged from service in this Company on the 18th day of June, 1863, at a camp near Alexander,\n\nVa. by reason of re-enlistment as a private in Company H, 191st Regiment Infantry, Pennsylvania veteren\n\nvolunteers, Enrolled on the 19th day of November, 1863, and served until the close of the war, being finally\n\ndischarged from the service of the United States the 28th day of June, 1865.\n\nAfter the close of this great National conflict he returned to his former home near Fayette City and\n\nresumed his former occupation and quiet life. Being a man of firm convictions and in everything consistant to the\n\n____ as he saw and believed the right, he renounced the political faith of his ancestery and became an unalterable\n\nRepublican, believing as lie had often said either he could not support by ballot the cause he had taken up arms\n\nagainst in more than four years of bitter struggle and privation. He was a thorough American and a radical\n\nprotectionist, never slaughtering his party and the common good of the people to appease a personal grudge; he\n\nlost sight of individuals in loyalty to the policy of his party and his country....\n\n....His remains are resting on beautiful Mt. Tabor cemetery; laid there by the loving hands, and with the\n\nritualistic ceremonies of his comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic.\n\n>Newspaper and date unknown-probably early July, 1891\n\nABBOTT, Henry Phillips Submitted by Tammy Knipp\n\n\"Beal Sup't Killed and One Injured\"\n\nWalking into an exploding charge of mine powder, Henry Abbott, aged 44, superintendent of the Beal Coal\n\nCompany's mine at Revere, Friday afternoon was instantly killed and Edward Farnhart, miner, of Uledi, was\n\nbadly injured and is now in the Uniontown hospital.\n\nMr. Abbott had been employed as superintendent of the plant less than one month. He was formerly mine\n\nforeman for the Eclipse mine and has lived the greater part of his life at Roscoe, where members of the family\n\nreside.\n\nThe two men had placed a charge in one of the workings and had retired to await the explosion. A similar\n\ncharge nearby went off, and the two men returned to the spot in the belief that their explosive had been fired.\n\nThey were within a foot of the charge when it let go.\n\nThe superintendent was badly torn and death was immediate. Barnhart was thrown a considerable distance and\n\nhis legs were crushed. Nearby workers carried the two men out and Barnhart was rushed to the Uniontown\n\nhospital. At that institution an X-ray examination will be made this morning to locate the fractures. The bones\n\nof the left leg were broken, it is believed, in four places and there are compound dislocation of the right leg.\n\nThe superintendent is survived by his wife, an adopted daughter, his parents and one brother, Alva Abbott of\n\nRoscoe. The remains were taken to the undertaking parlors of W.S. Nixon where they have been prepared for\n\nburial.
