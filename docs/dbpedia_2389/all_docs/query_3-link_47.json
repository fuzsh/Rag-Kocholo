The weary watch is over, the tillsome journey done, he has entered into his rest. For him no longer the prison house from which is shut out the light of the sun and the music of the birds. The earthy house of this tabernacle is dissolved. Now is the eternal building.\n\nHenry Fleming the oldest of seven brothers, was born in Morrow Co, Ohio, Oct 2,1820 and died at the home of his daughter, Mrs John Ingling, Saturday evening, Feb 6,1915, aged 94 years, 4 months 4 days.\n\nDec 8,1847 he was united in marriage with Sarah M Holmes. To this union was born 7 children, 3 girls and 4 boys, 3 of the children: and his wife preceded him in death. Mrs Fleming dying May 8,1895.One daughter, Mrs John Ingling, living in Atkinson, one son Perry in Tilden, one son in Los Angeles, Calif and one in Iowa.\n\nSept 17,1870 his family left Ohio for Iowa, he following Sept 17,1871. They removed to Nebr, Oct 9,1883, making their home at Atkinson.\n\nWhen Lincoln issued his first call for 300,000 volunteers, Mr Fleming enlisted in Co B, 43rd Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry and served 3 years and 3 months. He was a loyal staunch patriot. With heroic love for the flag he marched and fought , wrought and sacrified for his country. All honor to his memory. He will be missed from the GAR circle. Its ranks are thinning fast. The boys in blue are rapidly gathering for the great eternal encampment.\n\nAbout 50 years ago the deceased united with the Christian Church back in Ohio. After moving to Iowa, finding no organization of the Christian Church in the community where he located, he united with Baptist Church, upon his removal to Nebr he was united with Presbyterian Church, later receiving a letter from that church.\n\nWherever he might live, Mr Fleming cast in his lot with the people of God and thus sought to help in the Kingdom of Christ. Toward the last he had a great longing to depart this life.\n\nAltho of so great age Mr Fleming had a very retentive memory which served him well and which up until a few days before his departure was unimpaired. For a life well spent what a precious Bon! For the past four years he has been confined to his home. The last trip downtown was four years ago last election day. When he went to the polls to vote. During these years he has been tenderly cared for by his daughter and her family. This fidelity will not go unrewarded, for our heavenly Father knows our endeavors. Besides the above named relatives he leaves many grandchildren, great grandchildren: to mourn his going. Funeral services were conducted by Rev W S York Monday afternoon and interment was made in Woodlawn Cem.\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFocken, Donald Henry\n\nBorn July 9,1922 Atkinson\n\nSon of Henry and Sophia Fooken Focken\n\nMarried Oct 25,1950, Valentine, Beulah Maxine Brainard\n\nDied Dec 16,2003 Gregory, SD\n\nBuried Stuart Cem\n\nChildren: Alvin, Kenneth, Jerry, Shirley Koerperich, Roger\n\nSisters: Dorothy Schroeder, Lorena Lee, LaVerne, Iva, Doris\n\nBrothers: Clarence, Marvin\n\nUS Army - June 22,1945 to Nov 22,1946\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFolda, Ida Ahle\n\nborn 1903 Petersburg, Nebr\n\ndau of Anton Schulte Ahle\n\ngraduated St Joseph HS 1921\n\nmarried R J Folda, Aug 1928- he died May 1951\n\ndied Aug 1956\n\nchildren: Margaret Henderson, Rupert, Annette hendon, Roger, Joe\n\nbrothers and sisters: William, mary Pearce, Elsie Dvorak, Emma Gerwing, Theresa Ziska, Anna Ahle died Jan 8,1956\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFolden, Nora E\n\nmarried Rev J M Folden\n\ndied June 5,1911 Springview\n\nburied McPaul, Iowa\n\nchildren: son age 11, girl age 2\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nForbes, Orville L \"Boots\"\n\nborn Feb 14,1930 Amelia\n\nson of Lewis and Carrie Forbes\n\ngraduated Atkinson HS\n\nmarried Florence Wyllie\n\ndied March 3,2003\n\nburied Fort McPherson National Military Cem, Maxwell, Nebr.\n\nchildren: David, Bill, Jan Parsons\n\nsisters: Mable Black, June SKinner\n\nbrother: James Murray\n\nUS Navy Dec 1950\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFord, Harry \"Dutch\"\n\nborn Butte, April 20,1910\n\nson of Bob and Mable Ford\n\nmarried Margaret Gallagher, Oct 21,1935\n\ndied White Salmon, Wash, Jan 3,1990\n\nchildren: Nadine, Jacqueline\n\nsisters: Dora Murphy\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFord, John Claire\n\nborn Nov 30,1934 Atkinson\n\nson of Robert and Elizabeth Sterns Ford\n\nmarried Constance Hannon, 1953, Anaconda, Mont\n\ndied July 25,2005 Anaconda\n\nburied Sunset Memorial Park, Anaconda\n\nchildren: Deborah Jean Culbertson, Rosemarie Plumb, Peggy Barclay, Constance Jeanette Navarro, John Claire, Donna \"Lisa\" Jenkins\n\nsisters: Anita Anson, Ramona Wilson\n\nbrothers: Larry, Dallas, Bob\n\nstepfather: Jay Larson\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFord, Walter\n\ndied April 1970\n\nchildren: Florence Klinger, - 6 daughters, 1 son\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFoster, Mary Devine \"Dee\" Brennan\n\nborn Jan 25,1929 Fort Benning, Ga\n\ndau of Francis Michael and Mary Devine Brennan\n\ngraduated St Mary's O'Neill\n\nmarried Sept 8,1951, John Richard Foster, O'Neill\n\ndied Sept 16,2007 Storm Lake, Iowa\n\nburied St Mary's Cem, Storm Lake\n\nchildren: Thomas, Edward, Matthew, Andrew, John P, Ann Braly, Richard, Robert\n\nbrothers: John, Bert, Neil Francis\n\nsister: Patricia Clark\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFox, Carol Ann\n\nBorn Aug 24,1942, near Emmet\n\nDau of Charles and Elizabeth Fox\n\nDied April 7,2006 O'Neill\n\nBuried O'Neill Prospect Cem\n\nBrothers: Gilbert, Charles\n\nSisters: Esther, 1 died in infancy\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFox, Elizabeth Hoppens\n\nBorn Dec 21,1899 Glenvil, Nebr\n\nDau of Frank and Betty Classen Hoppens\n\nMarried Charles Fox, Jan 28,1920, Humbolt, Kan - he died 1975\n\nDied March 9,1989 O'Neill\n\nBuried O'Neill Cem\n\nChildren: Leonard, Wayne, Gilbert, Chuck, Robert, Larry, Lyle, Gordon, Raymond, Esther, daughter died at birth, Opal Bosn, Ruby Belzar, Marie Kelly, Carol\n\nGrandchildren: Mitch Bosn, Rex Fox\n\nSisters: Mary Lemkau, Tillie Meyers, Bertha Vaughan, Ruth Stahnke, Ida Nolda, Edna Elfring, Ruby Berleson, Helen Nelson\n\nBrother: Earl\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFox, Rex\n\nSon of Wayne Fox\n\nDied Oct 1965\n\nBrothers: Roy, - 2\n\nSister: 1\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFox, Theresa Frances Zakrewski\n\nborn Opportunity, March 18,1930\n\nmarried Leonard Fox, June 5,1947 O'Neill - he died 2003\n\ndied May 29,2008 Englewood, Colo\n\nburied St Theresa Cem, Clearwater\n\nchildren: Mary Ann Dounay, John, Linda, Doug, Joseph died in infancy, James died in infancy\n\nsisters: Helen, Margaret, Vicotira, Angela, Rose Podany, Verna Fox\n\nbrothers: Tom, Paul\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFranzen, Frank Charles\n\nBorn Jan 14,1957 Loup City\n\nSon of Richard and Arlene Schmidt Franzen\n\nDied Feb 1,2008 O'Neill\n\nBuried O'Neill Prospect Cem\n\nChildren: Nester Conato, Jacob\n\nStep children: Kerri Weidner, Cammie Cuhel, Alicia Weidner, Christina Weidner, Nickolas Weidner\n\nBrother: Randy\n\nSisters: Peggy Trew, Peggy, Patty Harpham\n\nUS Navy Dec 4,1979 to Oct 1,1996\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFreed, Alvin John\n\nJan 22,1915 Atkinson Graphic\n\nMay 28,1901- Jan 20,1915\n\nAlvin, aged about 13 years, son of Mr and Mrs Bert Freed, died at the farm home six miles east of Atkinson on Wednesday, Jan 20. He had been sick about ten days. The funeral services will be held Saturday, at St Joseph Catholic Church.\n\nFeb 5,1915 Atkinson Graphic\n\nOn Friday, the 22nd, Alvin Freed, our happy and cheerful schoolmate, was laid to rest in St Joseph Cemetery. He was born Mary the 28th, 1901, and since St Joseph Hall was built, Alvin has attended school here every year for a longer or shorter period. This year, too, he was planning to return, in order to prepare for confirmation, when a sudden illness prevented him and in a few days snatched him from our midst. All that parental love and medical skill could do, was lavished on the little sufferer, to retain him yet a little while, but God had disposed differently. He loved our Alvin best and took him home.\n\nIn every family He selects one tender bud, one full blossom that He calls before it can mature, so that it may bloom in unfading splendor round the throne of God. Thus He severs a tie on earth, that all may learn to look up to Heaven, where the eternal reunion awaits us. Alvin is gone before us, and we must hasten the moment when he enjoys the beatific vision and can intercede for us.\n\nHe did not shrink with dread from the dark passage, full well he had learned that death is but the Gate of Life, and when he realized his dangerous condition, he asked for his pastor Father Loecker, to receive those sacramental graces, which the church holds out to her children. Tuesday again he wished for his presence to prepare all the better to see his Creator. Wednesday God gave His beloved sleep, and even the stricken parents feel that they may well yield their dearest treasure to such wise, and loving keeping.\n\nAlvin, with his cheerful disposition and his unselfish willingness to help was truly the sunshine of his home. Especially the aged grandparents: will miss him, who has preceded them like a young herald to meet them, when their call comes. His only sister, Ruth and his little brothers: will keenly feel his loss, or rather the separation. In school too, we regret, not to have him with us and yet his bright example is to us a stimulant to follow steadfastly in the same principles.\n\nAt the funeral the school children: all were present to give their companion the last public tokens of affection. Henry Bauman carried the school banner draped in purple. Six altar boys were pall bearers and attended in white and purple sashes. All children: wore badges of their respective societies. Six little girls carried the floral tokens before the casket and the older pupils sang the beautiful liturgical chant of the requiem. Rev Father Loecker addressed the large assembly of old friends, gathered despite the inclement weather, in a well chosen sermon, coming from and therefore going to the heart.\n\nWhen the remains were taken out, the children: sang their favorite hymn, closing with the stanza, which may fitly end this obituary.\n\nWhile I do my duty\n\nStruggling through the tide.\n\nWhisper thou of beauty\n\nOn the Other side.\n\nTell who will the story\n\nOf our now distress!\n\nOh, the future glory!\n\nOh, the loveliness!\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFreed, John\n\nFeb 12,1915 Atkinson Graphic\n\nborn March 9,1826 - died Feb 9,1915\n\nAnother old soldier and old settler John Freed, passed away at the home of his son, Bert, 7 miles northeast of town Tuesday the 9th, aged 89 years.
