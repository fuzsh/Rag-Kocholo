Hewas prominent in G.A.R. circles, and active worker in Coal Center Methodist church.When the war broke out he enlisted in Company I, which was raised in California and Coal Center. This company was taken to Wheeling and encamped for a time on the island and became a part of the Second West Virginia regiment which afterward was called the Fifth West Virginia Cavalry. This regiment was sent into the mountains of West Virginia near Beverly and during the war was in over 30 battles, in nearly all of which Hiram Qualk took part until wounded through the right lung at the battle of Cloyd Mountain. He was taken to the hospital at Gallipolis, O.

Mr. Qualk celebrated his 97th birthday on Christmas day. He was probably the oldest odd-fellow and Mason in this part of the state, having joined the former organization 65 years ago.\n\nMr. Qualk was born in Philadelphia, Christmas Day, 1813. His father was a soldier in the War of 1812. His son, the subject of this sketch, was born while his father was away in the war. His mother afterward married a German named JOHN MYERS. With his mother and step-father, he came over the Allegheny Mountains in 1820 to Murraysville, Westmoreland County, remaining a year, and then the family removed to Allegheny County. One day a Washington County miller named Harper happened to be at the Myers home, and induced Mr. Myers to allow his son, Jacob, to come and live with him. It was agreeable with his step-father, who received $10 as a compensation for giving up the boy.\n\nJacob Myers, as he was then known, soon tired of living with the miller and tried to run away, but was caught and taken back. The second attempt was successful, the boy going to the neighborhood of Florence, Hanover Twp., where he agreed to live with one EDWARD HATFIELD. Jacob was not satisfied with his home, which was uncongenial, and the overseer of the poor indentured the little fellow to a man named Hanover, of Burgettstown. The understanding was that if Jacob should remain with the family until the decease of Mr. and Mrs. Hanover, who each were then over 70 years of age, he was to inherit the farm. This, it appears, did not please the grandchildren, who induced the boy to leave. He started away in the night and covered 15 miles before daylight, when he was met and went with a teamster who was taking a load of goods to his home at New Philadelphia, Ohio. There he remained some time and again returned to Washington County. He drifted to Pigeon Creek, where he heard of a man named Redd, who was to start a trip across the mountains. While passing along near the Redd home he met two girls who were picking berries by the side of the road. He stopped to talk with them, and in this way met SALLY REDD, who later became his wife.He remained with Mr. Redd for some time, and while there learned that his real name was \"Qualk\", which he adopted from that time on.\n\nMr. Qualk was married to Sally Redd in 1836, and for six years lived in the vicinity of Redd's Mill, going to Greenfield, now known as Coal Center, in 1840. For many years he followed boating. He made many trips on coal boats and barges, piloting them down the Monongahela and Ohio rivers to market points down below.For a period of 35 years Mr. Qualk served as constable, and was postmaster for several years. When elected constable, Mr.Qualk could not write, but after two week's instruction under a writing teacher, he was able to subscribe his own name. Under the instruction of his wife he came to master\n\nthe \"Three R's\".\n\nMr. Qualk and one of his sons, Hiram, enlisted in the same regiment and company in the Civil War. They went to Company I, 2nd West Virginia Infantry. Mr. Qualk served seven months, until crippled by lumbago, and his son saw three years' service.\n\nHe was a Democrat through life. He first voted for Andrew Jackson for President, in 1832. For more than 65 years he was an active and aggressive church worker being a member of the Methodist Episcopal church. It was with great pride that he frequently mentioned five men in particular who gave him strong and honest assistance in leading a manly life. These were Hiram Winnett, Richard Richardson, Cyrus and George Newkirk and Edward West.\n\nSix children survive. Mrs. UNDERWOOD of this place, Mrs. SARAH E.

His death ends a remarkable life. Th deceased was born in Philadelphia on Easter Sunday, April 16, 1810, lived for many years in McKeesport, and had been a reident of Pittsburgh for 11 years. At an early age he revealed a fondness for circus life, and began the career, which later gave him a world-wide reputation, by training circus horses for James Taylor, of McKeesport. In December, 1847, he was employed in the museum at Boston, where he first began his work as a clown. In company with the famous Dan Rice and other noted showmen he traveled with Maley & Olders circus through South America, Central America and Mexico. Upon his return to the United States he entered the service of Dan Rice, who started on the road with what would be called a one-horse show.\n\nAs a circus man Mr. Welser travled over the greater portion of the world, both in the capacity of wagon driver and clown, and had mastered several foreign languages. While most of the time he was with the largest circus companies of the country, for several years he conducted a small centriloquial and tumbling show of his own. He was well known to all the showmen in the Western Hemisphere, and kept a meorandum of all the famous circus people he had known and what befell them.\n\nHe will be especially remembered by the older residents of this vicinity for a remarkable voyage he made many years ago down the Monongahela river from Brownsville to Monongahela in a tub drawn by four large white geese. He was cheered by people who lined both banks of the river. Mr. Welser had been married three times. He was united to his first wife in Philadelphia, and to that union were born town sons, who survive him. He came to McKeesport in 1853. His second wife was Julia Stacey, whom he married in 1856 in McKeesport, and who died childless in 1886.
