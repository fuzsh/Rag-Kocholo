His obit was contributed to the Fayette County USGenWeb Project.(11)\n\nOn the 25th of February, 1861, at his residence in German township, Fayette county, Pa., Mr. JOHN POUNDSTONE, in the 71st year of his age.\n\nHe was an honest, industrious, upright citizen, and had enjoyed good health until about one year since, during which time he was a great sufferer; but we trust that his afflictions were sanctified to his spiritual well being, as his thoughts and mind were turned to spiritual and Heavenly things, and he has left behind him the testimony that he had gone to be with his blessed Savior. He has left a large circle of friends and relatives to mourn their loss, but let them not mourn as those who have no hope, but take Christ for their all, and be prepared to meet him where partings shall be no more. J.A.\n\nThe Genius of Liberty. Uniontown. Feb. 28, 1861.\n\nNancy L. POUNDSTONE ( -1923)\n\nNANCY L. POUNDSTONE\n\nMrs. Nancy L.

She was a daughter of the late David and Mary Coffman and had lived her entire life in German township. She is survived by three sons, A. J., Ewing B., and David Walter Poundstone, all of Balsinger, five grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. Funeral services will be held Thursday morning at 11 oclock from the home of Ewing B.

Lutheran Congregation in the old log (St. James') church, (known as the \"Dutch Meeting House\" by the common people) predecessor to the Jacob's English Ev. Lutheran church of German township.\n\nMother Poundstone's christian character was unexceptionable and her devotion to the cause of Christ steadily increased to the Evening of her days. Her mind and memory were unusually strong and clear. A few days before her demise, on the last visit of her spiritual counselor, she gave him the 5th verse of the 31st Psalm as an expression of her feelings and as a text from which she desired him to preach her funeral servicethus showing her strong faith and confidence in her Redeemer. She rests from her labors and her works do follow her.\n\nThe Genius of Liberty. Uniontown, Pa. Feb. 11, 1864.\n\nCol. Richard POUNDSTONE died in 1854.

Transcription may not be exact.\n\nUnable to help herself when her clothing caught fire from an open grate, Mrs. Jane Pratt, aged 83, of 134 Mill street, Thursday morning at 8 oclock, was burned to death in her bed. The remains, charred beyond recognition, were found by fire men who broke open a door at the three-room cottage.\n\nNeighbors who saw smoke coming from the house turned in the alarm. As the firemen dashed to the scene they were informed that Mrs. Pratt probably was inside the burning building. The fire ladies lost no time in going to the rescue. They found the victims bed on fire and her lifeless remains partly covered with the bed clothing.\n\nIt is the theory of Fire Chief George H. Litman that Mrs. Pratt arose earlier in the morning to stir up fire in the grate and to light a gas fire in another room and that in doing so, her clothing caught fire. The chief says that he thinks Mrs. Pratt was unaware of her burning clothing until she got in bed. The blaze no doubt was communicated to the bed clothing and when flames enveloped her, the aged woman was unable to save herself or to utter audible cries for assistance. That she had been out of bed was borne out by the fact that she still wore her bedroom slippers.\n\nSo quickly was Mrs. Pratt overcome by the smoke and flames that she did not have time to move. The bed clothing was found up in her waist. Above his her clothing was entirely burned from her body which was blacked by the ravages of the fire.\n\nThe fire loss was confined mostly to the bed in which Mrs. Pratt slept. It was almost entirely destroyed. The body was removed to Nixons morgue.\n\nMrs. Pratt had lived in 134 Mill street, between Berkeley and McConnick avenue for 86 years. Her daughters and grandchildren often made frequent visits to her.\n\nMrs. Pratt was the mother of Mrs. George Bundy and Mrs. James Courtney of Uniontown and Mrs. Jos. Arensburg and Mrs. Louisa Boord, of Ohio.\n\nMrs. Jane Cline Pratt was the daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth Foster Yarnell.

Brothers said, as he prepared to file formal murder charges against Price this afternoon. Mrs. Price, mother of a five-year-old girl, was shot in the chest by a bullet from a .32 calibre revolver early Saturday morning in her one-room home, one mile west of Morris Crossroads. Brothers established the time of the tradedy as between 1:20 and 1:30 a.m. He said a witness, Joseph Kury, 28, formerly of Masontown, now residing in Point Marion, said he had left the slain girl's room at 1:15 a.m.\n\nRefuses to Talk\n\nBrothers said Price, a Rosedale, W.

The woman's mother, Mrs. Gladys High, on whose property Mrs. Price lived, said she was awakened by Price shortly after the shooting. She said Price was screaming, Catherine's hurt, hurry, hurry! Mrs. High said when she went outside, the suspect was carrying her partly clothed daughter to his auto. Price took the victim to the Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, W. Va. He told authorities there that the woman shot herself. Price, an Army veteran, is being held in county jail.

Price, is being held under suspicion of murder. So far Price has denied the discharge of the weapon, refusing to offer any explanation of the death of the woman who was shot through the heart. Assistant County Detective Forrest C. Parks, yesterday performed a paraffine test which will determine definitely whether the lethal weapon was fired by Price. The suspect, who will be charged with murder under the instructions of Distict Attorney Fred L. Brothers, admits he entered the residence of his wife, in the rear of the home of her mother, Mrs. John High on the Larman road, near New Geneva, a short time after the departure of Joseph Kury, who had taken Mrs. Price to a movie show. Kury asserts that he left the home of Mrs. Price about 1:15 o'clock. A few minutes later Price told Chief County Detective William J. Long and State police that he arrived. As Mrs. Price asserted, well I'm going to bed and turned out the light, there was a flash and roar of the gun,: said Price. I stood about nine feet away. Then the explanation of the suspect halts. He declines to offer any further explanations. His car was parked about a quarter of a mile distant and apparently he had seen Kury leave. When shot, Mrs. Price was wearing the jacket of pajamas, an undergarment, shoes and hose. An autopsy showed the bullet pierced the upper part of the heart and lodged in the back just under the skin.

She met death under the following distressing circumstances, which we extract from a letter written by Mr. P. to her parents, Mr. and Mrs. H. Wiggins, Fayette county, Pa:\n\nHer clothes caught fire from the small stove in the bedroom. She tried to put it out and after she found that was impossible, she ran to the kitchen with the intention of going out of doors, but thought that would not do, so she called for relief; and before the inmates of the next room could reach her, her garments were nearly consumed, and her flesh almost all over her entire body, burned very badly - consequently her sufferings were very great, which she bore with christian fortitude for nearly a week; when she obeyed the voice of her savior, in whom she trusted, and breathed her last. She was in full possession of her right mind to the last.\n\nSeldom has it been our lot to record the death of one more esteemed than sister P. Naturally mild and affectionate; she was a devoted wife and mother, and endeared child and relation. During a revival of religion in the bounds of Mount Hope Congregation, in Stewart township, Fayette Co. Pa, during the winter of 1857-8; she in connection with her husband and many others, united with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in whose communion she lived an exemplary member until severed by death. She has left husband and two dear little children, a father, mother, brothers and sisters, and many relatives to mourn her untimely end. And now her spirit mingles - doubtless - mingles with Saints on high - and thus beckons to her dear ones left here, to meet her there. Oh, may the Lord bless the bereaved husband and children, and all she leaves here, and may they be prepared to meet her.\n\nIf Heaven be now her happy state,\n\nShe lives redeemed from care;\n\nThen let us try before to late,\n\nTo meet her spirit there.\n\nJ.

Charles Pringle, a colored man employed at Broad Ford, who has been boarding here, was killed by the second section of the westbound express trail at Broad Ford on Sunday morning. Pringle was on his way to work as usual at an early hour, and it is supposed that he did not hear the fast train coming behind until it was almost upon him. He was struck near where the Peemickey bridge crosses the Baltimore & Ohio tracks. The unfortunate man was brought here about a half hour after he was struck, and lived till he was placed in the baggage room of the Baltimore & Ohio depot. His head was badly crushed. He never spoke after he was struck by the train. On Pringles person was found a pay envelope, which he had received the last pay day. Deputy Coroner James Echard held the inquest, the jury rendering a verdict of accidental death. Pringle was about 26 years old. He came to this place about 6 months ago from Virginia. He engaged boarding and lodging at the home of Frank Williams, a colored man who lives on the corner of Baldwin and Mountain avenues. There he became attached to the daughter of his landlord, Miss Lizzie. His love was reciprocated and the two were to have been married in a short time. The grief stricken girl did not hear of her lovers fate until late on Monday.
