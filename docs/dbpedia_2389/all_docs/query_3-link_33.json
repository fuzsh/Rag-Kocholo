I, too, have seen and\n\nexperienced the incompetence and\n\nindifference displayed by VA personnel. Veterans' benefits and the VA's\n\ncapability to provide proper treatment\n\nhas been, and is still being, systemati-\n\naway by the self-serving\n\npoliticians we have been voting for\n\nduring the past 40 years.\n\nL.R. VanArsdale\n\ncally stripped\n\nCleveland, Texas\n\nI am tired of the VA bashing that\n\ntakes place regularly in The American Legion magazine. I am in the\n\nprocess of recovering from radical prostrate surgery for cancer and completing\n\na series of radiation treatments as a\n\nfollow-up. I can truthfully say that I\n\nhave never been treated better at any\n\nmedical facility, civilian or otherwise.\n\nErnest R. Ekstrom\n\ncourts, police departments, schools,\n\ncommitment\n\nchurches, families, morals, print and\n\nfilm media, Congress, money values,\n\nual couple,\n\nwork\n\nethic\n\nand on and on.\n\nGusFunk\n\nMarmora,\n\nAs\n\na priest\n\nand pastor,\n\nI\n\nN.J.\n\nwant\n\nto\n\nrespond to Bauer's assertions about the\n\neroding of our traditional values.\n\nUnlike the religious leaders he refers to\n\nas timid and afraid of being divisive, I\n\nam not afraid to speak out on behalf of\n\nour traditional Judeo-Christian values.\n\nFrankly, I believe very strongly in these\n\nvalues, and people like Bauer scare\n\nme silly with their ultra-right-wing\n\napproach to the issues.\n\nFor example, he says the gay community assaults the traditional values of\n\nour nation. In ministry to both the\n\nheterosexual and the homosexual, I\n\nfind that the basic values are not only\n\ndesired and practiced, they are\n\ncherished and loved. I see the same\n\nDenial of disability compensation to\n\nour distinguished former servicemen\n\ncan only be described as a total disregard for the suffering of these brave\n\nheroes. It is now time for Congress to\n\nfulfill its promises to veterans.\n\nJ. Edward Evans\n\nSpring\n\nHill, Fla.\n\nThe Values Front\n\nI\n\nread the interview with Gary Bauer\n\n(\"Battle Over American Values,\" February) with a great deal of interest.\n\nBauer says that once upon a time, students began the day with a prayer and\n\nthe Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.\n\nThis is so true. No more. Patriotism and\n\nmorals have been thrown out. We have\n\ntaken a three-letter word out of the\n\nclassroom and inserted four-letter\n\nwords.\n\nAmu Sanborn\n\nYantic,\n\nConn.\n\nhave watched our great nation\n\nI\n\ngoing down the road of Rooseveltian\n\nsocialism for most of my years. Bauer\n\nhas hit the target on every point. I put it\n\na different way, however. Socialism\n\nduring the past 60 years has rotted our\n\n4\n\neach other in a responsible, ethical\n\nand monogamous relationship, as I do\n\nin the bride and groom who come to me\n\nfor their wedding ceremony.\n\nTo imply that disagreement is an\n\nassault on our values, is, in many ways,\n\nan invitation for some to respond with\n\nviolence, and a blessing on their doing\n\nso. I am concerned about our values,\n\nbut I am also concerned about our\n\npriorities. Our freedoms come first.\n\nRev.

John R. Kasich, R-Ohio\n\nRep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri\n\nMaj. George C. Marshall,\n\nthe future World War II\n\nArmy chief of staff,\n\nnoted in 1923: \"We start in the making of\n\nadequate provisions and then turn\n\nabruptly in the opposite direction and\n\nabolish what has just been done.\" Symbolic of this change in direction is the\n\nstrong effort in Congress to kill the B-2\n\nSince the conclusion of\n\nthe Persian Gulf conflict,\n\nit\n\nhas\n\nbecome\n\nfashionable\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nof the B-2 Stealth\n\nto argue that the war with Iraq\n\nfor proponents\n\nBomber\n\ndemonstrates why we must spend\n\nanother $40 billion to complete the B-2\n\nprogram. I believe that based on mission\n\nrequirements, the projected future military threat, and our own serious budget difficulties, Congress acted wisely in deciding not to purchase any further\n\nB-2s in fiscal year 1992.\n\nIn the Gulf War, all U.S. military aircraft demonstrated\n\nsuch superiority that it is implausible to argue we need\n\nanother $10 billion for a nuclear bomber.\n\nOne of today's most popular B-2 rallying cries is that two\n\nB-2s could do the job of 75 conventional aircraft for less\n\nmoney. Unfortunately, those making this claim will never go\n\nso far as to say which 75 aircraft they will retire when those\n\ntwo B-2s come on line.\n\nThere should be no mistake about it. The B-2 was\n\nintended to be a nuclear bomber designed to penetrate the\n\nSoviet Union. And the original mission of the B-2 in the\n\nnuclear role was its purported ability to attack strategic\n\nrelocatable targets such as mobile missiles. By 1990, however, then- Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Larry D. Welch\n\nadmitted that the B-2's ability to attack such targets was not\n\na realistic near- or mid-term-capability, and would require\n\nprolonged development of advanced sensors.\n\nThe B-2's ability to perform conventional missions has\n\nbeen intensively publicized. We have no doubt it could\n\nperform such a mission, but we wonder about the costeffectiveness of an $860 million \"carpet bomber\" in an Iraqitype scenario, given our already abundantly demonstrated\n\nsufficiency in cruise missiles and air-delivered precision\n\nweapons.\n\nBomber.\n\nshould continue building the B-2 for two reasons:\n\nFirst, to realize a significant national investment in a\n\nrevolutionary weapons technology. And second, to hedge\n\nagainst possible unfavorable world developments in the\n\nStealth\n\nWe\n\nfuture.\n\nMuch the way the\n\nsubmarine transformed naval warfare in\n\nthe early part of this century, stealth technology has already\n\ntransformed air combat. We have entered the era of aircraft\n\nthat can be tracked by radar and those that cannot. The F- 1 1\n\nstealth fighter was the only allied plane to operate over\n\nBaghdad in the Gulf War, and it proved itself in combat.\n\nThe B-2 represents the most advanced evolution of stealth\n\ntechnology. It combines the survivability of the F-l 17 with\n\nthe payload and range of the B-52. One mission over Iraq\n\nrequired more than 65 aircraft to hit one target. Aircraft\n\nactually dropping bombs were less than half that number.\n\nThe rest were tankers, electronic aircraft and fighter escorts.\n\nTwo B-2s could have undertaken that operation. Lives and\n\nmoney can be saved by reducing the number of support\n\naircraft now needed to escort unstealthy aircraft.\n\nThose wanting to end more than 10 years work on the B-2,\n\ncite the end of the Cold War and budget deficits here at home.\n\nThey focus primarily on the B-2 program's high cost. Yet, it\n\nwould be penny wise and pound foolish to have completed\n\nall the engineering, tooling and production facilities, and\n\nkill the program after building only 15 planes. Bomber\n\nfunding follows a cyclical pattern. Initially high investment\n\nis followed by a longlasting payback in deterrence. Today's\n\nB-2 will be flying 35 years from now.\n\nThe world remains a dangerous place and the future is\n\nuncertain. In such an uncertain world the B-2 will provide\n\nflexibility— being able to\n\nperform both nuclear and\n\nVETVOICE 1-900-740-VETS\n\nconventional operations.\n\nTo voice your thoughts on anything In The American Legion magazine, call\n\nLet us heed George MarVETVOICE 1-900-740-VETS.

There was only one\n\nwater spigot for the 12,000 men and a\n\n12-hour wait to fill a canteen was the\n\nusual rule. After seven days the men\n\nreceived their first rations— one mess\n\nkit of rice and a can of sardines.\n\nThe Corregidor prisoners were\n\nforced to march through Manila on May\n\n23, 1942, having previously been\n\nforced to jump out of the barges which\n\nbrought them over from the island\n\nwhile they were still a hundred yards\n\nfrom the beach. Thus, said Col.\n\nMellnik, \"we were marched through\n\nManila presenting the worst appearance possible— wet, bedraggled, hungry, thirsty, and many so weak from\n\nillness they could hardly stand.\"\n\nThere were virtually no water\n\nfacilities at Camp O Donnell Prisoners\n\nFrequently, for\n\n#**\n\n,\n\nlike the\n\n>\n\n1\n\n§\n\ns\n\n'\n\n.\n\ndied in the barracks overnight.\n\nno apparent reason, the\n\nprisoners were forced to line up and\n\nstand in the sun for hours.\n\nAround June\n\nAmerican priswere separated from their Filipino comrades in\n\narms and moved to Cabanatuan Cononers at\n\n1\n\n,\n\nthe\n\nCamp O'Donnell\n\ncentration\n\nCamp\n\nin\n\nLuzon.
