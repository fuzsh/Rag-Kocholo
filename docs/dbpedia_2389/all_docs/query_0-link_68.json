HOLDCROFT\n\nOn Wednesday, July 21st, James P. Holdcroft of Ohio Township passed away rather unexpectedly despite his 93 years of age at UPMC Passavant Hospital with his family by his side. A member of the Bellevue Knights of Columbus. He was chronically young for his age. Jim, as he was most commonly known, was happily married for over 50 years to the love of his life, the late Ruth Anne Holdcroft. He was father of Kathryn Holdcroft Cauley, James P. Holdcroft, Jr. (Sara Maddern Holdcroft), and Kimberly Holdcroft and the last surviving sibling of the late Helen Fitzpatrick, Edward Holdcroft, Margaret Birsic, Mary Lou Roos, Robert, Paul and Daniel Holdcroft. Jim was the proud grandfather of Kimberly Cauley Eckel (Ryan Eckel) and Fiona Holdcroft Lynch (David Lynch) and great-grandfather of Asher Cauley Eckel, Eliot James Eckel and Sage Ruthanne Eckel. Jim was also the loving companion and aide-de-camp of his four-legged friends, Paddy, Buddy and Rusty. Jim served in the Navy during WWII. While in the Navy he was a Golden Gloves boxing champion and was trained and mentored by Joe Louis. Once home, he began his 40-year career helping others achieve better lives as union organizer, representative and highly effective negotiator. Jim loved life. Everything he did, he did with enthusiastic energy, joy, and integrity. Jim always believed that if something were worth doing it was worth doing well – and he was always doing something. For decades Jim was an active organic gardener who would joyfully spend endless hours outside planning and executing new projects, tending flower beds, pruning his many shrubs and bushes, and growing some of the best tomatoes around. Family and friends who visited Jim were usually always first greeted with a personally guided tour of his gardens which included an update on the latest developments for each of his favorite plants. Jim was an avid reader and a keen student of economics and politics. He relished a good conversation and thoughtful debate. Jim was a deeply religious man who was active in his church and happily put his faith into action. He was exceedingly generous of his time and money with those in need. Jim will be remembered most, however, for the great love he had for his family and his friends. For Jim, family started with his brothers and sisters, and rapidly expanded to their spouses and their children and on from there. His circle of family and friends was ever expanding. Finally, it should be noted that Jim was the undisputed champion bedtime storyteller for three generations with an unmatched ability to revise the classics to incorporate the doings and antics of whichever child, grandchild or great-grandchild that needed some comforting. Jim left a legacy for all who knew him by the example of his ways. His humor, his grace, and charm live on in the hearts of all he loved.
