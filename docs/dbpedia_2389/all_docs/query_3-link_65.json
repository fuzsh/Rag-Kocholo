        "text": "Our hearts and prayers go out to the family of our classmate Buzzie Dils on the passing of his wife, Pam.\n\nPamela Enoch Dils, 79, of Parkersburg, passed away Sunday, August 4, 2024, at her residence. She was born November 14, 1944 in Parkersburg and grew up on Washington Avenue, a daughter of the late Tessie McCroskey Enoch Jefferies and Preston Enoch. Pam was a joy to be around. From a tender age, her generous, fun-loving personality won her countless friends. Pam and her sister, Gloria, were also true beauties: as caring and sincere as they were attractive.\n\nIn school, Pam participated in the Girls' Athletic Association and Glee Club. She was a natural athlete who enjoyed many sports, especially tennis. Little did she know that she was in for the match of her life! Pam's future husband spied her playing tennis at City Park in 1962, not long after she'd graduated from Parkersburg High School; he asked her out the next time he saw her.\n\nPam married \"Buzzie\" Dils in October 1963, and they soon settled on Morningside Circle. Their home became one of the neighborhood's hospitality hubs; the cozy, den bar was the perfect place for the Morningside gang to shoot the breeze, often singing along to Neil Diamond or other 60's and 70's music. They regularly invited people over to watch WVU games and NASCAR races, too.\n\nDuring the warmer months, Pam and Buzzie took the party to their river park property. Family and friends will cherish all the fond memories of cookouts, music, and good times together on the river. Pam spent her last, precious day on earth with her loved ones at the river, watching the Olympics and occasionally telling Buzzie to be quiet, since bickering was the love language of their long marriage.\n\nPam was fiercely devoted to her family, striving every day to make their house a home. She took pride in preparing her children's favorite meals and dedicated herself to ensuring the holidays were special for them. She also faithfully attended her children's and grandchildren's extracurricular activities. Pam was a gentle woman of few words, but she would morph into a Mama Bear if anyone trifled with her family.\n\nPam also had a fulfilling job as a real estate agent and initially worked alongside her mother at the realty company Tess founded. Pam delighted in helping home buyers achieve their dreams, and she valued the friendships she cultivated throughout her fifty-year career. Pam�s sophistication, business savvy, and professionalism never failed to impress her clients or the community at large.\n\nPamela Dils is survived by: her husband of 60 years, Sherman \"Buzzie\" Dils III; her two children, Sherman \"Brett\" Dils IV (Julie) and Jan Dils (Chuck Hughes); her four grandchildren, Alexandra Dils, Branson Dils, Hayden Hughes, and Spencer Hughes; her niece, Cassandra Moore; her brother, Kevin Enoch; her sister-in-law, Vicki Dils; her great-niece, Zoie Dils; her many close friends, Lyn Snyder, Wanda and Steve Tatman, Bill Leachman, Seldon Wigal, and Lee Gardener Reed, among others.\n\nIn addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by: her sister, Gloria Enoch; her niece, Sunni Dils; her dear friends, Nancie Divvens Albright, Pat and Bob Hull, Jayne Leachman, and James Snyder.\n\nVisitation will be held Thursday, August 8, at Lambert-Tatman Funeral Home of Vienna from 2-4:00 p.m. and 6-8:00 p.m. The family will also receive visitors at the church one hour prior to services.\n\nFuneral services will take place at 11 a.m. Friday, August 9, at St. Andrew's United Methodist Church, Parkersburg with Pastors Ray Maleke and David Carrico officiating. Burial will follow at Mt. Olivet Cemetery, Parkersburg.

She always looked forward to going. Linda was instrumental in helping many family members and friends become Christians in a very quiet, kind way. She always put the needs of others before her own.\n\nLinda was a country girl, with a deep love for the outdoors and she dearly loved animals. She rode her horse, Prince, through the woods every day growing up. As an adult, she always had a dog by her side, usually one she had rescued as a stray. At her request, her husband Jim built her 4 chicken coops over the course of their marriage. Even as a granny, her love of animals was evident. She would walk to the bus stop to meet her oldest grandsons, Evan and Luke, with a big sheep and goat on a leash. And this wasn't in the country, it was through a neighborhood. This is an example of the kind of woman Linda was, happy and funny and one-of-a-kind. She loved her family and it always showed.\n\nLinda was an amazing cook, especially her hot rolls, which were the talk of the town. She loved baking pies and was generous in baking them for others.\n\nLinda was an incredibly selfless, loving mother who worked hard and sacrificed much so that her children and grandchildren could have a wonder-filled childhood with hikes in the woods, impromptu picnics, lots of home-cooked meals, and so much fun and so, so much love. Her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren were the joy of her life.\n\nIn addition to her husband, Linda is survived by three daughters, Jama Cay Davis (Marty) of Williamstown, WV, Brette Nicole Swarr (Chris) of Walker, WV, and Megan Noel Dougherty (Jason) of Vienna, WV.
