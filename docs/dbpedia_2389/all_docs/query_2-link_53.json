The man was apparently despondent, and hence not responsible for his actions. He had told his wife he would do the job this time where he could not be found, before he left Friday night. He had attempted to hang himself a few months ago, but was cut down by a neighbor, John Grahmann before he could strangle himself.\n\nAfter his disappearance was reported here, officers of the law headed by Sheriff Theo Long and Constable Bill Renger, and a large group of Boy Scouts, headed by Emil Svab, began searching the entire area around his home on the John Rothbauer property.

Death came to the mother and grandmother with calmness that she may have desired, leaving an only daughter, Mrs. Hannah Phillips, wife of E. M. Phillips, and three grandchildren, Eddie, Lois, and Elizabeth Bowman. She is also survived by one brother, Chas. Koepke of Ellinger and two sisters, Mrs. Kate Beyer of Brenham and Mrs. Annie Moellenberndt of Moulton.\n\nSunday afternoon the body was taken to the new cemetery and placed to rest next to that of herhusband who preceded her in death some years ago, and her daughter, Mrs. Katie Bowman who died near to three years ago. Rev. R. Heise officiated at the home and the grave, and many sympathizing friends were present, with the mourning relatives to pay their last respect to their relative and sincere friend.\n\nMrs. Moellenberndt, who maiden name was Friedericke Koepke, was born at Live Oak Hill, June 13, 1853. She was the widow of the late Hy. Moellenberndt, and lived in LaGrange for many years. The adversities of life spared her not; she witnessed the passing of her relatives and finally her husband; and three years ago, tired from the weight that has been placed upon her, gave up her other daughter, Mrs. Katie Bowman, from which blow it may be said she never recovered, yet sought to resign herself to the admonition that those whom God loves he shastetheth. In all of her unfortunate aflictions she remained steadfast, possessing that Christian faith that prompts one to believe that the cross of life must be borne with fortitude. In that humblness of spirit that encourages a faith, she lived on. And in mentioning her passing we hesitate ot to say: May the soil rest lightly on her body, and her soul basque in the sunshine of eternal happiness. For we are told, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, they shall see God.\"\n\nIn attendance upon the funeral, the follwing from out of town are mentioned:\n\nMr. and Mrs. Aug.

For several months he had not been in good health, ailing little bodily, from pain or derangement, but gradually growing weaker, until, a few days preceding his [demise], he took to his bed. Like a flickering candle with the wick's end reached, the faint spark of life held the threads together until Saturday afternoon, tired and exhausted, the last breath was taken, the body stretched and the eyes closed. The eternal sleep had come.\n\nMr. Moellenberndt, in moderate circumstances, always active and energetic, was very retiring in disposition and mingled with his friends only when his time was not in demand. He had many friends, he was a good, kind-hearted man, a neighbor in the truest sense. His remains were interrred at the new cemetery Sunday afternoon, Rev. R. Heise, officiating. The attendance from city and from other points attested to his good character.\n\nBesides his widow, two married daughters, three brothers and one sister are left to mourn his going hence. While we extend our sincere condolence to them, we also express the hope that the deceased will rest peacefully in his earthen home and that his spirit will find repose at the home of the Good Shepherd who said, \"Come unto me all ye who are heavy laden, and I will give thee rest.\"\n\nPhoto and obituary contributed by Lois Ferguson\n\nOLGA AMBERG MOELLENBERNDT\n\nLa Grange Journal\n\nThursday, December 18, 1947\n\nMrs. Moellenberndt, 88, Expires Here Sunday\n\nMrs. Olga Moellenberndt, 88, wife of Otto Moellenberndt, passed away at the family home here Sunday morning.\n\nMrs. Moellenberndt, nee Amberg, was born at Rutersville on Nov. 3, 1859, and on July 8, 1879 was united in marriage with Mr. Moellenberndt.Â They had been residents of La Grange since Sept. 1, 1889.\n\nThe deceased was a charter member of the St. Paulâs Luthern Frauen Verein here.\n\nBeside her widower she is survived by one son, Alfred of Houston; one daughter, Mrs. Chas.

M. Moore Succumbs After Short Illness\n\n(From The Elgin Courier)\n\nCharlotte Koehler, daughter of Louise Willrich and Emil Koehler, was born at La Grange, Texas, May 25, 1885, where she grew to young womanhood and was married there on August 4, 1905, to Alex M. Moore.Â She made her home in Elgin for some 30 years and has been identified with all the worthwhile things affecting our city in civic, church, school and social circles.Â She was converted into the Lutheran church early in life, but after her marriage came into the Methodist church with her husband that they might worship together, and was a devout Christian character, a person quiet and retiring in her associations but whose true worth and rare traits were quickly recognized and appreciated by everyone who came in contact with her.Â She was kind, sympathetic, generous to a fault, and ever had a friendly greeting and pleasant word for those who passed her way.\n\nShe was a devoted mother and grandmother; her whole life revolving about the lives of her two daughters, who afforded her untold joy and pride and the son-in-law, who had been a son to her in the true sense of the word.Â Her aim was to give them happiness and in so doing she knew peace and contentment in her lovely home.\n\nShe was a member of the Order of the Eastern Star and was held in high esteem by the personnel of the local chapter, which she attended and had taken active part in for years, her late husband having been a member of that order and the Shrine body, in which he was likewise much interested.Â Her passing will take from the ranks of the Methodist Missionary Society a fine and loyal member, one who was always ready and eager to do her part and more in any capacity.\n\nTo know Mrs. Moore was to admire her and her friendship were unlimited; everyone, old and young, was eager to call her friend.Â Any organization in need of an ally or assistant found a ready response from her.Â She was open to conviction and liberal in her consideration of the beliefs of others.\n\nAfter an illness of six days she succumbed to pneumonia following an attack of flu, at 4:40 oâclock Monday morning, December 28.Â She was thought by members of her family to be doing nicely but suddenly took a turn for the worse Monday night and all that loving hands and medical attention could do was to no avail.\n\nFuneral services were held Tuesday morning, December 29, at 10:00 oâclock from the First Methodist church, where she had worshipped so many years, with her pastor, the Rev. A. A. Carter giving a most touching and beautiful oration, paying high tribute to her memory.Â He was assisted by the Rev. G. M. McNeilly, pastor of the First Baptist church of this city, who read the scripture and also eulogized her life of love, and service.Â The casket rested before an arrangement of handsome floral pieces on chancel rail, altar and other points forming a background.Â The choir sang âAsleep In Jesusâ and âHaven of Rest.âÂ As the casket was taken from the church it moved through an aisle of Eastern Star members, each holding a beautiful floral offering.\n\nPall bearers were L. P. Cherry, Frank J. Swartz, Ben Davis, Joe H. King, Louis Lundgren, Pat Pfeiffer, A. J. Rankin, and Bee Keel.\n\nAt the Elgin cemetery, where interment was made, the Eastern Star had charge and under direction of Mrs. Daisy Smith, Worthy Matron, gave their impressive burial service.\n\nA large assembly of sorrowing relatives and friends were present for the last rites and the many lovely flowers sent from far and near as messengers of love and sympathy covered the mound of her final resting place and overflowed onto the lot.\n\nSurviving are two daughters, Mrs. Diana Davis, Elgin and Miss Margaret Moore, Tyler; one granddaughter, Bette Diane Davis and the son-in-law, Dale Davis; three sisters, Mrs. Anna Kirsch, Mrs. Elise Mensing and Mrs. Julia Gebhardt, all of La Grange; four brothers, Arthur Koehler, La Grange; George Koehler, West Point; Fritz Koehler, Houston, and Mannie Koehler, Schulenburg; and her mother, Mrs. Louise Koehler, La Grange.\n\nAmong relatives and friends here from out-of-town for the funeral were:Â Ade Kirsch, a nephew, Mrs. Arthur Koehler, Mr. Gebhardt and Mrs. Louise Koehler, of La Grange; Mrs. George Koehler, West Point; Mr. and Mrs. Horace Sowell and son Horace, Jr., El Paso; Mrs. Will D.

MOORE, an old and highly respected citizen.\n\nMr. Moore was born in Halifax county, North Carolina, on the 29th Jany, 1797, and in 1837, removed to Sumpter county Ala. and in 1839 he removed to Fayette County Texas, where he continued to reside up to his death.\n\nAs a man of sterling integrity and moral worth, Edwin L. Moore had but few equals.\n\nI have known him for 13 years, and in all his transactions during that period I have never known him to deviate from the path of rectitude. He has left his children a legacy in his good name, of which they can never be deprived.\n\nAs a husband he was kind and loving; as a father he pssessed an affection for his children known to but few men; as a friend his attachments were strong and could not be easily severed; as a citizen he was ever ready to perform all the duties devolving upon him; and last though not least as a Christian, he was devout and faithful.âThose who have known him longest, can best appreciate the qualities of his head and heart. Truly the ways of Providence are mysterious, and we must all bow to them however afflicting.\n\nMay the bereaved family remember, that, \"Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.\" Let the wife and mother grieve and weep not over him whom the Lord hath taken from her. Let the sons and daughters imitate the example of their father; and let each and all of them endeavor to meet with the departed spirit in that \"bourne from whence no traveller returns.\"\n\nGod help them in this hour of their sad bereavement.
