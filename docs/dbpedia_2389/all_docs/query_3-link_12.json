        "text": "In my research project, ‚ÄúTactical Fantasy Culture: The Rhetorical and Material Politics of Assault Weapons in America,‚Äù I seek to produce an academic monograph that examines the rhetorical and political consequences of the 2004 expiration of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. The expiration of the ban has allowed powerful, rapid-firing weapons to circulate broadly throughout the country. I will bring my perspective as a rhetorician and apply it to the cultural artifacts that surround a phenomenon that I call ‚Äútactical fantasy culture.‚Äù This study builds on prior work I have undertaken on rhetoric and guns, which has been wellreceived in my discipline. At the end of this research project I expect to have a manuscript to submit to either the University of Alabama Press, or South Carolina University Press, which are currently the top presses publishing monographs in rhetorical theory. Please see proposal for additional details about the theoretical approach I will bring to the project.\n\nMy research is on the fifteen symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich, widely recognized as the most significant composer of symphonies after Gustav Mahler. While various writers have explored Shostakovich‚Äôs biography and cultural contexts, no scholarly book in English is devoted just to the symphonies themselves.\n\nMy goal is to assemble such a book, comprised of fifteen essays translated from the Russian, featuring both Soviet and post-Soviet authors. The wide-ranging opinions, network of rich cultural references, and raising of provocative issues decades earlier than in the West will make this long inaccessible material essential reading for scholars and performers.\n\nThe introduction and commentaries will establish the pre-Soviet foundations of Russian scholarship on the symphony and will highlight the strategies by which the authors managed to elude Soviet censors and engage with music that did not neatly and unambiguously align with the Party‚Äôs aesthetic directives.\n\nSubjectivity and Signification: The Art of Jasper Johns is a book-length study of the American painter, Jasper Johns (b. 1930) with emphasis given to concurrent developments in the fields of psychoanalysis, genetics, and semiotics. Widely characterized as the most significant painter of the postwar period, Johns is also a key theorist of the visual image whose paintings ask incisive questions about art, subjectivity and, as I claim, the relationship between the two. An artist who comes of age in the mid-1950s as Modernism is giving way to Postmodernism, Johns is seen as a key player in art‚Äôs mid-century transformation, which is notably contemporaneous with the discovery of DNA‚Äôs double helix structure and Lacan‚Äôs seminars in Paris. My project brings these (and other) phenomena together for the first time for the purpose of exploring undertheorized links between Western conceptions of the image and individual in the postwar period, when each undergoes a significant and related shift.\n\n‚ÄúPicketwire‚Äù is at once place and story. Titled after the colloquial version of a watershed name, that of El Rio de las Animas Perdidas en Purgatorio, which originates in the 13,000-foot peaks of the Sangre de Cristo mountains and flows 196 miles across Southwestern Colorado, ‚ÄúPicketwire‚Äù the story explores a kaleidoscope of characters toward an understanding of my historical craft as rarely one of firm conviction; rather, for me, a process that requires an elastic suspension of moral certainty. Our most cherished characters, it seems, are often the most disturbing, and not simply for the charge they bring to a story. More often than not they carry forward the deeper work of illuminating the tangled qualities of historical actors, and provide an author the occasional opportunity, in rendering them human, to atone on their behalf, and perhaps, our own.\n\nSince the rise of the organic movement in the 1980‚Äôs, ethical eating has intersected with health and fad diets to enter the mainstream. Organic, fair trade, humane certified and other such labeled foods are now commonplace in supermarkets in the United States. Many geographers study the impacts of ecological health and ethical diets, but most are curiously silent on the topic of death in the food system. Of specific concern in this project is what or who is allowed to live and what is let die in the ‚Äúdoing of good‚Äù through ethical, ecological or health-driven diets. The original contribution of my project is to show how discourses and practices of ethical eating often (re)produce, at a distance, the socio-ecological harm most ethical consumers set out to avoid. With a Willson Fellowship, I will develop a book proposal, two draft chapters to submit to Duke University Press and a journal article to be submitted to Gastronomica: The Journal of Critical Food Studies.\n\nThis fellowship will support the completion of my first book, a microhistory of the French debates about Turkish literature that followed the 1728 expedition to the Ottoman Empire to collect manuscripts for the Royal Library. Moving between Istanbul and France, I draw from the disciplines of cultural history, history of the book, sociology of literature, and literary analysis to contrast the discourses about literature of French travelers to the Ottoman Empire with the demands of an emerging Orientalist French literary market. I present a new facet of Orientalism at the dawn of the Enlightenment and offer a critical analysis of the universalism of the concept of the Republic of Letters. Further, this project contributes to a broader discussion in the field of World Literature about the role of geopolitical imbalances in shaping the object of literature. The course release offered by the fellowship will allow me to complete archival research in France and finalize my manuscript.\n\nMy project focuses on a period of time prior to the encoding of Jacobite symbols into a romantic narrative of a past that never existed. British writers during the 1750s were struggling to articulate tolerance and to engage sympathetically with a Catholic sub-culture that had been vilified and denied civil rights since well before the Glorious Revolution. While Walter Scott‚Äôs Jacobite (from the Waverley novels) would be appropriated for nefarious nationalistic and racist agendas in the UK and beyond (the Ku Klux Klan is said to have fashioned its iconography based on Scott‚Äôs narratives), the Jacobite references prior to Scott chart a different path‚Äîone that is neither recidivist nor exclusionary. It is received wisdom in eighteenth-century literary studies that after Culloden Jacobite thought and Jacobites themselves were relegated to a fringe of a British society that had long since moved on. My project will challenge this orthodoxy.\n\nThe Italian Singers in Mozart‚Äôs Vienna: Their Voices and Roles examines the types of singers for whom Mozart wrote some of his most beloved operatic roles. While the period-instrument movement has come a long way in uncovering the playing techniques and sound of Mozart‚Äôs instruments, the nature of the voices of Mozart‚Äôs singers has remained elusive. Since, however, composers at that time still tailored their arias to the voices of their singers, it is possible to construct vocal portraits of some singers. The difficulty then is to construct the historical context in which to understand them. I have done much of this work in earlier books and articles, but in this final book, now in the writing stage, I will present the whole as a single argument, one that will alter how we view and sing Mozart‚Äôs operas.\n\nIs philosophy therapeutic or is it a sickness of the mind? Could it be both‚Äìtherapeutic in one mode and pathological in another? Using these as guiding questions, my project conducts a comparative study of models of philosophical therapy in ancient Greece and China. I focus on Plato and Zhuangzi, a formative figure in classical Daoism, on account of their compelling insights into this problem. Both thinkers share the idea that philosophy is like the art of medicine. Yet it is an important disjuncture between the two that exposes tensions inherent to models of philosophical therapy. While Zhuangzi associates therapeutic potential with limited philosophical activity, Plato stages his method as an unending quest for truth that he associates with the manic condition of eros. Does the success of philosophical therapy, then, depend on a timely suspension of the method itself? Or do philosophers inevitably risk succumbing to an erotic drive, thereby transforming from therapists into patients?\n\nSub-Present is a project consisting of paintings to be made in the spring of 2018, while Britton attends two artist residencies in Ireland. Both the Burren College of Art and the Ballinglen Arts Foundation have accepted Britton‚Äôs applications and confirmed the dates of the residencies. The paintings in Sub-Present propose to destabilize the knowledge of where the body is located from the sensation of its position in the landscape. In brief, the paintings use this dislocation to explore the human relationship to ecological conditions. The Sub-Present project will draw upon art historical issues and themes of romanticism in painting such as the representation of the sublime and the use of weather as a symbol of impermanence. The project culminates in a solo exhibition of Britton‚Äôs work in late 2018 at Ruth Bachofner Gallery in Santa Monica (one of five galleries in the US where his work is represented), and will comprise an application to Volta 2019 in New York, which is an international art fair.\n\nThis project looks at the transnational career of composer Kurt Weill (1900-1950) by examining his fascination with ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù as a concept. While a young man in the Weimar Republic, he was swept up in the ‚ÄúAmerikanismus‚Äù craze, and wrote a series of biting, satirical works that drew on the sounds and images of Hollywood gangsters to criticize the German government. But when Hitler came to power, the German-Jewish composer fled Europe for the United States. There, he found that his imagined ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù was nothing like the real thing, and set to work adapting his acidic style for American audiences. During the Great Depression, he became involved with the Leftist political theatre of the Popular Front, but when World War II began he moved toward the political center with a series of hit Broadway shows. After the war, he returned to writing socially conscious theatre, returning to the issues like racial equality and economic justice that he had championed in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe Willson fellowship has been invaluable for me at this critical juncture in the development of my book project on Writing Nature in Latin America. It allowed me to concentrate fully on my research during the spring semester of 2013. In reality, I am working on two books at once: the Writing Nature book and the Crisis Narrative in Mexico book. I have been researching both book projects intermittently over the last several years as I worked on other projects, and I have completed one chapter and a good chunk of the introduction of each of them. I plan to finish the introductions this summer and fall, and then submit proposals for both books to respected university presses. I also plan to use the progress I have made on these book projects during my tenure as a Willson fellow to apply for additional residential fellowships at the Library of Congress and the Research Triangle, as well as research grants from the NEH and the ACLS.\n\nThe Wilson Center Fellowship proved to be an invaluable contribution to my research. It helped to support several exhibitions and enabled me to participate in projects that I would not have been able to engage in while simultaneously teaching. By providing the course release, I was able to be in New York for several months to install and facilitate my exhibition there, to travel to San Francisco three times for an exhibition and the design of two public artworks, and to travel to Marfa, Texas for an exhibition and symposium. My participation in these events has also led to further opportunities including exhibitions in Munich, China, Los Angeles, several public art opportunities and the inclusion in an upcoming publication. In addition, I was awarded the best exhibition prize at the Dumbo Arts Festival. In all, this fellowship has been remarkably fruitful.\n\nMy Willson Center research fellowship allowed me to explore a hitherto under-investigated archive at the Hargrett Rare Books and Manuscript Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library and the Library of Congress: ‚Äúartist‚Äôs books,‚Äù or editions of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays and poems made by writers, binders, printers, painters and sculptors who use the book ‚Äì its covers, typography, page layout, and paper texture as well as, of course, the textual or illustrated content upon its pages ‚Äì as their preferred aesthetic medium. Shakespearean artist‚Äôs books such as Jan Kellett‚Äôs miniature herbals, Sue Doggett‚Äôs unique, collage, print, and hand-illustrated The Tempest, Leonard Baskin‚Äôs enormous lithographic Titus Andronicus and MacArthur-award winning book artist Claire Van Vliet‚Äôs monumental woodcut-illustrated King Lear use the form of the book to help readers understand Shakespeare‚Äôs words in fresh and sometimes challenging ways. Thanks to my Willson Center fellowship, I was able to consult these books first-hand and to experience their effect as physical, material objects in space, rather than as disembodied objects upon a screen. Turning the heavy, cream-colored pages of Van Vliet‚Äôs Lear, or unfolding the accordion fans of Kellett‚Äôs tiny masterpieces, helped me to understand that book artists turn Shakespeare‚Äôs words into exquisite or provocative mobile sculptures (books!) that make art through a performance ‚Äì a reading ‚Äì produced and delivered by reader, artist, and author. Such insights about Book Arts and Book History can help us navigate the rapidly changing terrain of emerging digital publication and performance in our own era.\n\nI am extremely grateful to the Willson Center for providing precious research time, which I applied to writing the book Arias for Stefano Mandini, Mozart‚Äôs First Conte Almaviva. As one of four case studies on Mozart‚Äôs singers, it constitutes the last big chunk of preparatory work needed to writing the book, The Italian Singers in Mozart‚Äôs Vienna: Their Voices and Roles. In gestation since 1991, the book aims to shed light both on the kinds of voices heard on the operatic stage in the late eighteenth century and on casting practices of the time in order to give singers and directors today a better sense of how to perform Mozart‚Äôs great operas in an historically aware way. Because of my workload during the academic year, the only chance I have for sustained writing is during the summers, which is not enough to maintain momentum in developing ideas to say nothing of producing a respectable publication record. Consequently the Willson Center Research Fellowship, which I have now received two times, has been critical to my progress as a scholar.\n\nThe Willson Center Faculty Research Fellowship has been instrumental in moving my research and writing forward this semester. As a junior faculty member, it is so important to have the opportunity to devote myself to writing. During most semesters this is difficult, and even few fellowships in the humanities allow for full-time writing support. Because of the Willson Center Fellowship, I have made considerable progress towards fulfilling my department‚Äôs expectations for tenure, and I have also made great strides towards completing a manuscript that I think will make an important contribution to scholarship in my field.\n\nThe Willson Center Faculty Research Fellowship has proven instrumental in driving my scholarship forward. Without this fellowship, I likely would have completed my manuscript in time for my tenure review‚Äîbut the manuscript would not be nearly as strong. Having the opportunity to really focus on the overall argument of the manuscript‚Äîan unglamorous but extremely necessary part of a scholar‚Äôs craft‚Äîhas made my project a much more important contribution to knowledge.\n\nWhile on research leave funded by the Willson Center for the Humanities in the fall of 2012, I completed research for my book project, Politics and Memory: Civil War Monuments in Gilded Age New York. My research campaign began during the summer in New York City, where I completed work in several archives, including the New-York Historical Society, Columbia University‚Äôs Avery Architectural Library, New York Public Library, and the city‚Äôs Muncipal Archives. During this trip, I also visited and photographed all of the monuments that will be included in my book. My research continued into the fall as I consulted several nineteenth-century newspapers for additional historical information for my project. I also began writing one chapter based on research from my summer trip to New York archives. I presented a paper titled, ‚ÄúThe Disappearance of Iconography from New York‚Äôs Civil War Monuments, 1864-1902‚Äù at the Southeastern College Art Conference in Durham, NC. This paper addressed one of the overarching themes of the book and will provide the basis for at least two book chapters. Early this spring I gave my Willson Center talk, which summarized the state of my work so far.\n\nA Willson Center Fellowship in the fall of 2012 provided me with the opportunity to move my project forward substantially. The gift of time is perhaps the most important thing for advancing publication of scholarly projects. Without this fellowship I would not have been able to gain traction on my project in order to move towards publication.\n\nThe time off provided through the Willson Center Research Fellowship enabled me to concentrate my efforts two ongoing creative projects. In January, during a three-week residency at Scuola di Grafica International I engaged in a project that employed multiple printmaking processes, including relief, plate lithography and monotype. My approach to the residency and the work created therein was open-ended. Upon arriving I immediately looked to the environment surrounding me for ideas. The result was an abstract accumulation of marks and imagery, which were literally and figuratively drawn from Venice. I viewed Venice as an accumulation of components ‚Äì a strange built environment in which the interstitial spaces revealed as much about the city as its colossal landmarks. My approach to pulling the prints was in many ways analogous to the city itself, in that they were some-what structured, somewhat randomized substrates for the accumulation of information. I embraced the inherent (natural) tendencies of printmaking processes, i.e. decay. These monoprints became raw material to be scavenged for the creation of a series of collages. Once again, the place imparted itself on the work. The spaces in between, which intersect the various components, provide (like mortar) structure and support.\n\nUpcoming projects and opportunities include a solo exhibition at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and a two-person exhibition at Washington State University in Pullman. I will be showing work executed during the residencies in Venice and Canada In both of these exhibitions. This summer I will be traveling to the University of Minnesota to engage students in a ‚ÄúPressure Sensitive‚Äù workshop similar the one I led in Canada. I am currently in the process of submitting the work created during my Willson Center Fellowship to multiple exhibition opportunities on the national and international level.\n\nThanks to a 2012-13 Willson Center Research Fellowship, I completed a revised draft of French poet S√©bastien Smirou‚Äôs second poetry volume, Beau voir, which I‚Äôm calling See About. Together he and I will finalize the translation this summer, when I‚Äôll return to Paris for two months. Thereafter I will set about seeking an appropriate publisher in the US. I have had preliminary offers from several American houses, including Counterpath Press and La Presse, to publish the book, but I‚Äôd like to wait until the manuscript is finished to my satisfaction before committing anywhere. Ideally, I would place the volume with a slightly more visible house; that, in turn, will involve waiting a few months on two national translation fellowships for which I have applied. Meantime, my translations of two of the book‚Äôs eight chapters have appeared in the American literary journals Aufgabe and Paperbag, and I have just sent a third to Conjunctions, which is preparing a feature on ‚Äúmenageries.‚Äù\n\nWillson Center Research Fellowships ‚Äì and this was my second such grant ‚Äì have been integral, irreplaceable aids to me in finishing translating Smirou‚Äôs two books. Even more important, however, is the time, funding, and permission these grants have provided to allow my mind to wander ‚Äìwith the kind of extreme concentration that‚Äôs only possible when unfettered by other obligations ‚Äì into unpredictable domains. An example. In July 2012, when the five photo-essays on Paris graffiti that The Poetry Foundation had asked me to write over summer concluded, I assumed that was the end of that. The series of photographs accompanied by my reflections on French graff were just a discrete, one-off endeavor. Once school started again, though, and the Willson grant coaxed me back into translating Smirou, I started becoming aware of how my formal Willson project was calling the graffiti venture back into play. It began dawning on me that examining graffiti, especially in French, implicates a hermeneutics less of reading or critical interpretation than of translation. Following that hunch, I delivered a Willson Center Fellows Lecture titled, ‚ÄúParis Photo Graff: Reflections on Shooting Graffiti in the City of Light.‚Äù Presenting this other project of mine was, for me anyway, a compelling way to articulate my ideas about translating, and ‚ÄúParis Photo Graff‚Äù has since moved into the forefront of my creative research. So I am indebted to this fellowship that supported me as I made significant progress on the project I set out to do. But I am more grateful for how the grant provided me an opening to elaborate one project in light of another obsession I hadn‚Äôt realized‚Äîand wouldn‚Äôt have realized, without the Willson‚Äîwas so related.\n\nReceiving the Willson Center Research Fellowship is a great honor and has been truly invaluable to me. By removing the constant pressure of preparing and teaching classes this semester, it has enabled me to lay the groundwork for a new book.\n\nIt brings together three topics‚Äîframing, causality, and evaluation‚Äîwhich have been widely studied in various areas of linguistic inquiry, including semantics, pragmatics, and cognitive linguistics. Through the analysis of naturally occurring Spanish discourse, the study aims to show how expressions of causality (e.g. relations of cause and consequence/effect and of justification and claim/conclusion/inference) are inextricably tied to speakers‚Äô ‚Äúframing‚Äù of the situation, both in terms of Gregory Bateson‚Äôs notion of framing, or how a speaker‚Äôs statement is intended to be interpreted, and Irving Goffman‚Äôs definition as the ‚Äúactivity‚Äù the speaker is participating in when speaking. Attributions of causality in the Spanish discourse will also be linked to the cognitive notion of knowledge frames (or schemata), originating from the work of Federick Bartlett, which captures the notion that our understanding and evaluation of experiences, including visual scenes and verbal texts, are ‚Äúexpectation-driven‚Äù and derived from previous experiences.\n\nThe Willson Center Research Fellowship has allowed me to develop these topics into the initial chapters of my book project, along with a tentative outline for the subsequent four chapters, forming a proposal to send to potential publishers of the book, as well as a more narrowly focused research article that closely examines the expression of semantic versus pragmatic causality in the retelling of a film by native Spanish speakers.\n\nAs a junior faculty member I cannot even begin to express what an incredibly positive impact this fellowship has already had on my young career. Having a semester to devote to research and writing allowed me to travel to conduct research overseas, meet with mentors and dedicate time to writing and editing.\n\nI spent several months in Mexico City researching a series of recently declassified documents. My findings enriched my book manuscript and allowed me to produce a new article forthcoming next summer in the Latino Studies Journal. In addition I have been invited to various institutions including Rutgers University, Harvard and Amherst to present my work with faculty and students, given that this research is, thanks to the Willson Center, new and groundbreaking.\n\nThis fellowship is extremely important for the advancement of research at UGA and I am just thrilled to have had the honor of receiving one.\n\nMy creative research explores the notion of three-dimensional drawings. My work is constructed with translucent mylar that is printed, hand-cut, and layered in such quantity that sculptural forms are created. In the past, the imagery in my work has been based on the iconography of Korean decorative art traditions.\n\nAs a professor in the University of Georgia Studies Abroad Program in Cortona in spring 2011, I had the opportunity to research the decorative patterns of cathedrals in Italy. In the fall of 2011, with the research focus provided by the Willson Center Research Fellowship, I began a series of artworks based on the frescoes of the Cathedral of San Rufino in Assisi.\n\nThis new body of work, entitled ‚ÄúThe Lens Series,‚Äù explores the notion of thresholds onto a transcendent space. A lens, which sharpens or alters vision, can transform the act of perception. The works in this series are scaled to suggest a window onto a private meditative space. The imagery, which is colored by hand on a translucent substrate, has the visual effect of stained glass. Fabricated with numerous layers of lasercut mylar, the artworks create a visual statement that is both pictorial and volumetric.\n\nMy work has been enormously enriched by the research focus provided by the fellowship. It was essential to the development of an innovative direction in my creative research in the visual arts. It also allowed me to introduce new technical processes such as rapid prototyping in my work.\n\nThus far in the term of my fellowship, I‚Äôve appeared at the annual international meeting of the Modern Language Association to give a talk related to my book on contemporary U.S. comics. While at the MLA in Seattle in January, I and a fellow panelist were interviewed live on NPR concerning the status and history of comics in the U.S.\n\nMy book, Arrested Development: Comics at the Boundaries of Literature, and several of its key topics were mentioned during the interview. The broadcast generated considerable local interest in Seattle‚Äôs comics scene, and some comics publishers based in the area subsequently attended the talk. Also in January, an article related to the book was confirmed for publication in ImageTexT, a peer-reviewed journal of comics studies. The article will be entitled ‚ÄúAutoclastic Icons: Bloodletting and Burning in Gilbert Hernandez‚Äôs Palomar,‚Äù and will appear later this year.\n\nThe Willson Center Research Fellowship has had a powerful impact on my research into U.S. comics. To begin with, it allowed time for substantial revisions to the ImageTexT article, which were requested very suddenly in mid-January. Of course, the main impact has been the benefit to the book project. My project seeks to correct a number of common misconceptions about the development of comics, and to understand how they have been affected by a traumatic history of censorship and suppression.\n\nThe Fellowship (in addition to allowing time for assembling the manuscript) will allow me to take two crucial research trips. The first will be to the Comic Art Collection at Michigan State University, one of the largest comics archives in the nation, where I will be examining a number of rare horror comics that were more or less censored out of existence in the 1950s. I‚Äôll also be examining the early cultural history of these comics as told in fanzines. The second trip will be to the Library of Congress, which has recently made available the papers of Dr. Frederic Wertham, one of the key crusaders against comics in the 1950s and the most well-known opponent of horror comics. I will be examining his papers in the hope of better understanding the theories of art that allowed Wertham to appreciate violent, disturbing material when presented in modern print literature while condemning very similar material when presented in comics. Neither of these trips would be possible without the support of the Willson Center, nor would the strong intervention I am attempting to make into the study of U.S. comics.\n\nThis fellowship has made it possible for me to sustain a high level of productivity going back to last summer. One of the advantages of being notified, last spring, that I was a Fellowship recipient, is that I was able to design the whole year for maximum yield.\n\nI therefore spent the summer working exclusively on my book Oblique Modernism, anticipating (correctly, as it turned out) that I could complete it around the end of the year, freeing me up to launch into a new project once the Fellowship began in spring term. Although I was teaching in the fall, a great boon of a Fellowship is that it permits light to shine through the looming window of a cleared space, as it were.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my support for the Willson Center Research Fellowship. The Fellowship provides an uncommon opportunity for UGA professors to be released from teaching, and therefore dedicate time to conducting and writing up research. This is particularly important in the arts, humanities, and related disciplines, in which opportunities for support are limited, even with large grants.\n\nGiven that I do research internationally in Panama, I have found my research and writing opportunities are stymied by the relatively little time I have available in the summer (and recently that time has been entirely dominated by grant administration). Given that UGA is a research university that does not support research sabbaticals, the role of the Willson Center is incredibly important for the research potential and retention of faculty.\n\nFor me personally, my Willson Center Research Fellowship has allowed me the time to work with colleagues in Panama to carry out and reflect on our collaborative linguistic project. In so doing, it has furthered the collaborative potential of our research and its theoretical contribution to the literature. In addition, the teaching release of the Fellowship has permitted me to take advantage of diverse opportunities. These include writing a supplemental proposal to the National Science Foundation, participation in Willson Fellow Fausto Sarmiento‚Äôs upcoming conference, and an invited talk at Columbia University.\n\nI used this time primarily to work on my manuscript (Disorientation: Islamic Identity in Anglophone Literature. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, forthcoming). This project explores the literary representation of Muslim immigrants and the challenges they face as they try to negotiate their religious identity in the secular states of the West.\n\nI argue that a number of novels written after September 11 highlight the predicament of the devout Muslim woman living in diasporic communities in England; these works pay particular attention to the identity crisis experienced by the Muslim woman, a process which I term ‚Äúdisorientation,‚Äù a temporary disruption of identity that challenges the fixity of one‚Äôs allegiances.\n\nWithout the support I received from the Willson Center it would not have been possible to finish the full draft of the manuscript. Having some time away from teaching allowed me to focus fully on my research, and to have a quick turnaround with my correspondence with the publisher."
