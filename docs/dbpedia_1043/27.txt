The Royal Australian Navy is the navy of the Commonwealth of Australia, formed upon the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901 as the Commonwealth Naval Forces. In 1911 the Permanent Naval Forces were granted the title of Royal Australian Navy, and the Citizen Naval Forces received the title of Royal Australian Naval Reserve.

Prior to 1913, Australian waters fell under the protection of the forces assigned to the Royal Navy's Australian Station. In that year the British Australian Station was replaced by the locally-administered Australian Fleet.
