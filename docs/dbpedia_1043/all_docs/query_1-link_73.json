        "text": "Six large and \"optionally crewed\" naval vessels heavily armed with missiles will be added to Australia's surface fleet under a dramatic $11 billion reshaping of the navy that will also see the acquisition of 11 new general-purpose frigates to be partly built overseas.\n\nLabor has unveiled its long-awaited \"Enhanced Lethality Surface Combatant Fleet\", which will include six Hunter-class frigates, reduced from an original plan of nine, as well as upgraded versions of the existing Hobart-class destroyers fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles.\n\nUnder the sweeping overhaul, Australia's current fleet of combat-ready warships would rise from 11 to 26, consisting of nine \"Tier 1\" frigates and destroyers and 11 smaller general-purpose frigates, as well as six optionally crewed vessels which will form a \"Tier 2\" force.\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles said that, while the optionally crewed vessels had \"the capacity to operate in an uncrewed fashion\", Australia's intention was to use crews.\n\nAustralia's oldest currently serving warship, HMAS Anzac, will be immediately retired ahead of the gradual replacement of the aging Anzac-class fleet with new frigates which will first be built in either Germany, Korea, Japan or Spain.\n\nThe planned number of Offshore Patrol Vessels being built in Western Australia will be halved to six and will eventually form part of a planned fleet of 25 minor war vessels dominated by Evolved Cape Class patrol boats.\n\nThe government will consider the eventual replacement for the Hobart-class destroyers \"in the context of the 2026 National Defence Strategy\" to align with a continuous naval shipbuilding strategy at Adelaide's Osborne Naval shipyard.\n\nReleasing the plan at Sydney's Garden Island Naval base, Mr Marles insisted the plan was \"fully funded\" and would inject an additional $1.7 billion over the forward estimates and $11.1 billion over the next decade into defence.\n\n\"The enhanced lethality surface combatant fleet will ensure the navy is optimised for operations in our current and future environment, underpinned by the meticulous assessment conducted by the Independent Analysis Team,\" Mr Marles said.\n\n\"This significant advancement in navy capability that will be delivered under this plan requires a strong, sovereign defence industry,\" Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy added.\n\nThe Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Mark Hammond, called it \"a serious investment and a serious challenge for our navy to step up and deliver\".\n\n\"This is a real shot in the arm in terms of understanding the important role that the Australian navy sailors play across the Indo-Pacific,\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"This will be the largest surface combatant force we've operated in generations. It will also be, in time, the most lethal.\"\n\nCoalition defence spokesman Andrew Hastie accused Mr Marles of weakness for failing to deliver enough short-term extra funding.\n\n\"The truth is that Richard Marles went to cabinet and lost to Jim Chalmers, Penny Wong and Katy Gallagher. He couldn't secure any more money,\" he said.\n\n\"Labor also has a major recruitment and retention crisis on its hands. Morale is at an all-time low â€¦ What is their strategy to find and hold talented young Australians to crew both our future submarines and our future fleet?\""
