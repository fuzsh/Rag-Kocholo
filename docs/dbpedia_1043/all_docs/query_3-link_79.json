In the interest of good economy therefore the Australian Government has developed the practice of purchasing defense equipment that has provision for certain facilities or features, but is not fitted with the afore said facilities or features. For example Guided Missile Frigates, without Guided Missiles. The idea being that should we even need them, we'll have plenty of time to procure them. And plenty of time will be needed, given the prodigiously spectacular lack of anything resembling movement at Russel Offices. The problem with this idea is of course that the enemy has on occasion been known to attack without letting their targets know (reference Blitzkrieg, Pearl Harbour, etc). This is referred to as a \"surprise attack\", because it is a surprise. The other problem is that we tend to buy equipment from the US, France, the UK, Sweden and other countries in the other hemisphere on the other side of the world. The ships and planes we'd need to import this equipment might not survive the voyage/flight, as they'd need to be escorted by frigates/fighters etc - most of which are fitted for, but not with key systems.
