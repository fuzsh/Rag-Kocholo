Defence and security cooperation was one of the key issues on the agenda during Prime Minister Modiâs Summit meeting with visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in New Delhi on Friday.\n\nA day before the first in-person India-Australia Summit, Prime Minister Albanese had also gone on board the Indian Navyâs indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant in Mumbai, Maharashtra.\n\nChief of Navy, Royal Australian Navy Vice Admiral Hammond is on a three-day official visit to India from March 9-11, 2023. The visit was marked by an impressive Guard of Honour on the South Block Lawns to welcome Vice Admiral Hammond.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Defence, the Indian Navy closely cooperates with the Royal Australian Navy on numerous issues, including operational interactions such as AUSINDEX, KAKADU and P8 operations. This is in addition to training exchanges, exchange of White Shipping Information and Subject Matter Experts in various fields, all of which are coordinated through the medium of Staff Talks meetings conducted annually.\n\nWarships from both Navies regularly make port calls at each otherâs ports and interact in multilateral exercises such as MALABAR, RIMPAC, LaPerouse. Both Navies have also been cooperating towards exploring new avenues for collaboration in the areas of Defence industries, Defence innovation and emerging Defence technologies in support of âMake in Indiaâ vision, the Ministry of Defence pointed out.\n\nThe ministry added that the visit by Australian Navy Chief Vice Admiral Mark Hammond is an important event in the continued and regular dialogue between Indian Navy and the Royal Australian Navy, and it reinforces the Navy to Navy cooperation in keeping with the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries."
