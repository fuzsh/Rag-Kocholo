        "text": "1. This Royal Australian Navy Discussions and Updates 2.0 thread is a continuation of the older thread (starting 20 Nov 2021). The older RAN thread at 1,500+ pages is a bit too long and further discussions should continue here. Some prior posts before this was moved here from the RAN thread to seed future discussions.\n\n2. The older RAN thread was locked for a week and now this 2.0 thread is reopened for discussion by all. Please take heed of the Red text warning that followed to closure of the 1.0 thread. In particular:\n\n​\n\n(a) the continual \"redesigning\" of the Hunter Class FFG, unending speculation on its dimensions, number of VLS cells, Centre Of Buoyancy, COG, and so on when the design isn't even finalised, has become repetitive and tiresome; and​\n\n​\n\n(b) posts on building a fourth Hobart Class DDG, arming the Arafura Class beyond what the RAN has already determined to be fitted, are to cease.​\n\n3. There are also daughter threads related to:\n\n​\n\n(a) submarines in Naval Ship & Submarine Propulsion Systems (that provides a 23 page overview with 2016 comments/predictions that proved to be accurate); and ​\n\n​\n\n(b) the more recent and topical 16 page, RAN Discussions on SSNs only, which is locked. If anyone intends to post an opinion on SSNs, please read all 16 pages of the prior discussion.​\n\n4. I note that the first major initiative under AUKUS is Australia’s acquisition of at least 8 SSNs. The Australian Government intends to build these submarines in Adelaide. No alternate universe discussions please, unless backed by sources. If there is any further attempt at speculation on Australia getting Block V Virginia-class submarines (as this takes the thread into fantasy land); or actions that violate US laws, this thread will be paused for at least 2 weeks or longer. Lack of discipline and failure to cite sources will see perfectly good discussion threads locked.\n\nNot so, the American inquiry into Savo was thorough and the report, delivered in 1943 was kept secret until long after the war.\n\n“The scholarly Admiral Hepburn, ex CNO, conducted a far reaching investigation travelling throughout the Pacific and Australia ( concentrating mainly on the USN)\n\n.........\n\nThe quote above is from Mike Carlton’s wonderful book, “Flagship” The Cruiser HMAS Australia and the Pacific war on Japan, a highly recommended and enjoyable, even unforgettable read for those interested in things Naval\n\nAll true. I have a copy of the book and it is excellent (although not as good as his \"Cruiser\" about HMAS Perth)\n\nMy comments are based upon a slightly more detailed analysis of US reports and attitudes by Bruce Loxton in\"The RAN in WWII\". As he points out Hepburn's report was solely concerned with the performance of the Cruisers and prepared for Admiral King. It certainly didn't acknowledge that Bagley torpedoed the Canberra nor analysed the breakdown in.allied airforce communication that caused the sighting of the Japanese not to be passed on.\n\nOn the other hand, based on a secret report not release to Australia until 1971 and the basis of a Study taught at the USN Newport War College, the blame was put on Crutchley, HMAS Canberra, the RAAF search aircraft and the RAAF communications - all based on completely false facts. And they certainly hadn't recognised that the damage to Canberra could almost only have been caused by Bagley (the ships tracks are shown in the book). It suggests the same report/study strongly influenced Samuel Morrison in writing \"The Struggle for Guadalcanal\" (I've not had time to go back and see to what extent it is reflected in his writing).. The bottom line is that several generations of US officers were brought up believing it was our fault on defective and incomplete facts.\n\nI gather the error has been recognised and that study dropped\n\nThe RAN website has a PDF factsheet available for the Hunter-class FFG available here. Unfortunately it is too large to upload.\n\nThe factsheet manages to answer several questions, while also raising a number of others. It appears that design will two 20 mm CIWS, which is presumably referring to a pair of Mk 15 Phalanx CIWS. Curiously though, there is also to be a pair of 30 mm short-range guns. That looks to me like the RAN is going to keep on going with several different small calibre guns across the fleet, as opposed to rationalizing the small calibre guns to easy the training, logistics and support demands. I would be interested in finding out if the 30 mm gun/mounting is going to be the MSI DS 30B with an Oerlikon 30 mm/75 gun like aboard the Huon-class MHC, or if an entirely different mounting and/or gun will be used. Given that the upcoming SEA 1180 vessels are to be armed with a 40 mm gun, IMO it would seem more sensible if the Future Frigates were to also be armed with the same small calibre gun...\n\nSide note; I still wonder if this is what the RAN website is referring to with the Future Ships & Boats entry for Patrol Ship, Offshore (PSO).\n\nThe MU90 torpedoes are also to arm the Future Frigate, though not having heard any work being done to fit the MU90 aboard either the MH-60R Romeo helicopters or P-8A Poseidon MMA, it would seem that the RAN/ADF plan on maintaining two completely separate stocks of LWT. The factsheet also mentions an advanced AShM, though whether that is another block/iteration of the Harpoon AShM, the NSM, or LRASM I have no idea, and no mention of AShM numbers either, though current plans do not seem to have any VLS AShM. No word on the number of Mk 41 VLS cells for ESSM or SM2, though having looked at some of the renderings posted by the RAN on their FB page, it does seem to be 32 VLS cells between the main gun and bridge and a pair of quad launchers like the Harpoon uses just aft of the stack.\n\nThe machinery is listed as CODLOG, with a pair of electric motors, four high speed MTU diesel generators, and a single RR MT30 gas turbine.\n\nMe being me, I would like the vessel to either have more than 32 VLS cells, or at least have the option (space and weight set aside) for additional cells to be added later on. Right now the current plans only seem to figure on ESSM and SM2 for the VLS, and if the count of 32 cells is accurate, then a likely full missile loadout would be something like 24 SM2 and 32 ESSM, which should provide enough missiles for 12 SM2 and 16 ESSM interceptions. If more cells can be added later on (or the initial cell count is higher) that could permit either more missiles for more interceptions, or additional types of missiles not currently in RAN service like LACM's, ASROC, or BMD missiles like SM3.\n\nTime will tell though.\n\nNow, for the bone I do have to pick about the decision and announcement, and this might not be popular with others... Me being me, I would have preferred it if the RAN had instead opted to have the class named after a historical RAN ship, and then to draw upon RAN history and re-use available ship names. Perhaps something like naming the Future Frigate class the Tasmania-class, after the S-class destroyer HMAS Tasmania from 1920, and then looking at names of RAN warships with battle honours like Torrens, and go from there.\n\nAs someone who has been directly involved in the SEA5000 CEP for the past three years I would like to firstly acknowledge the views, opinions and thoughts of those that have contributed to this thread. While I reflect back on them, I take solace no matter the bias or sway that sometimes is evident in the posters views, that I feel assured the RAN is going to going to not only get a world-class ASW capability it will be backed by a programme that will see an unprecedented involvement of Australian Industry SMEs and business enterprises that will continue to support the development of this ship as leading-edge and capability relevant and this will be the foundation of an Australian continuous ship building strategy.\n\nNoting the pedigree of some of the Defence Pro posters, and as someone who has been involved in Naval ship design, build, integration, test and in-service support for over 20 years, but more importantly someone who wants our Navy to have the best capability at sea, I am bursting at the seams with enthusiasm, with what the Hunter class ship will provide to the RAN. We love to talk about tactical capability and platform design, and frankly I enjoy it just as much, but without going into the details, the GCS-A platform will exceed the capabilities of just about every comparable surface combatant in-service and planned to enter service in the foreseeable future. You should note that all persons involved are subject to a Deed Poll agreement, and hence non-public disclosed information is not releasable.\n\nI know a lot of posters are fixated on specific weapons loadout or ‘insert my niche subject’ but that selected design meets all requirements set out in the CEP by CASG. For example, one of the misnomers, is the VLS cell count, the answer should be well known following any kind of investigative research on-line which should allow you to deduce the answer. While a keyboard warrior considers more is better, you need to appreciate the big picture of providing more (or less) to the overall package of capabilities sought by the CoA that are stipulated in the requirement set. If more, then where is the funding allocation to come from to justify the procurement of additional FMS equipment (the VLS launchers are not an inconsequential cost impact to the overall programme bottom line), noting the DoD must to put forward costs and budgetary submission through first and second pass endorsements to government to allow this to be realizable, and the budget had already been set. Ultimately what is the purpose of ‘more’ if insufficient birds are not planned for inventory. How does this compromise on other capabilities that are specified in the requirement set, which have been built around a set of conops and a doctrine of use? One of the most significant technical aspects of the GCS-A is the platforms inherent margins, which frankly have been engineered into the platform in ways that have not been widely employed before. They are nothing ground-breaking but are clever. So, should the CoA decide after building FOC, or anywhere during the drumbeat that it would like to double the cell load-out it can, and know that it’s going to have to a high level of confidence that this can be done without unacceptable loss of other capabilities, and furthermore and significantly so that this can be done within the drumbeat cycle and not halt the ‘continuous’ build cycle.\n\nIf you want to understand why this ship design was selected over any other you need to look at the primary objectives of the SEA5000 programme. They are freely available in public domain and are the opening statement of the RfP, if you should care to read them. The provision of 9 ASW frigates on a minimum change principal is only but one of them. Take each separately and consider what each and every specific aspect of each objective means, then you will start to understand the complexity of the task and the massive undertaking the CoA is seeking to meet with this programme. And for me, this is where the swell of national pride comes to the fore, as someone who can participate in this vision, knowing that we have selected the best overall package against all of those objectives, and too bonus, that the chosen design is undoubtedly a lethal, highly capable platform in not only ASW, but across the full spectrum of capability concurrently, just makes it the icing on the cake. In speaking with serving Navy and Australian Industry representatives I know they share the same feeling of positivity.\n\nWestern Australia to be Home of Hunter Class Training School\n\n(Source: Australian Department of Defence; issued June 29, 2018)\n\nWestern Australia will be home to a new Hunter class training and capability centre, known as ‘Ship Zero’, as part of a $670 million investment at HMAS Stirling and Henderson to support Australia’s new frigates.\n\nThe new frigates will provide our nation with one of the most advanced anti-submarine warships in the world - a maritime combat capability that will underpin our security for decades to come.\n\nThe warships will also be larger and have more complex systems than the existing ANZAC class frigates, and will require new and upgraded facilities at HMAS Stirling.\n\nAs part of this $670 million investment, the Government will:\n\n-- Extend the existing wharfs\n\n-- Construct maintenance and equipment storage buildings\n\n-- Construct new support facilities, including medical facilities and accommodation\n\n-- Construct a new Navy Training Systems Centre – West.\n\nShip Zero located at both HMAS Stirling and Henderson will include a headquarters, through-life test centre, ship and capability specific training school, and potentially a land-based test site for platform systems.\n\nShip Zero will transfer an increasing amount of the training that has traditionally been done at sea to land. This will mean each of our new frigates will be able to spend more time on operations and exercising with our allies and partners, and less time in port for crew training.\n\nHunter class frigate crew training will be based on a combination of classroom instruction, shore-based simulation, virtual reality training system and live training events ashore, centred at Ship Zero.\n\nThese upgrades to HMAS Stirling are in addition to the $300 million upgrades associated with the selection of Stirling as ‘Ship Zero’ for the Offshore Patrol Vessels, the $150 million upgrades to support the new Maritime Operational Support Capability vessels and the $367 million redevelopment of HMAS Stirling infrastructure. This ensure our ADF members have access to modern fit-for purpose facilities and will bring total investment at HMAS Stirling to well over $1 billion.\n\nThe successful prime contractor will be required to implement a Local Industry Capability Plan (LICP) that will ensure small-to-medium businesses in Western Australia have the best opportunity to compete and win work on the infrastructure to support the Hunter class."
