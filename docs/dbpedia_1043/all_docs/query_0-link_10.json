Campbell, AO DSC to pay respects to Her Majesty The Queen. \"On behalf of members of the Royal Australian Navy, we offer our deepest condolences to The Royal Family on the loss of Her Majesty The Queen. Her Majesty dedicated her life to public service. During her reign, she exemplified a life of duty and sacrifice, ever resilient in the face of adversity and dedicated to the peace and prosperity of the Commonwealth. The Royal Australian Navy has had a long and proud association with Her Majesty The Queen, which began following her coronation in 1953. All vessels within the Royal Australian Navy were recognised as Her Majesty’s Australian Ships. Her Majesty’s legacy will endure, and her remarkable contribution be revered, for generations to come.\" - Chief of Navy Vice Admiral Mark Hammond, AM RAN"
